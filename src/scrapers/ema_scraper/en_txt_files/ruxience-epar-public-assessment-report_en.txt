2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
About the product 
PF-05280586 (rituximab, Ruxience) has been developed as a biosimilar product of MabThera 
(rituximab). It belongs to pharmacotherapeutic group of antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, 
with ATC code: L01X C02.  
Mode of action 
Rituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein, 
located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is expressed on >95% of all B cell 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. 
CD20 is found on both normal and malignant B cells, but not on haematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells, 
normal plasma cells or other normal tissue. This antigen does not internalise upon antibody binding 
and is not shed from the cell surface. CD20 does not circulate in the plasma as a free antigen and, 
thus, does not compete for antibody binding. 
The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can 
recruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. Possible mechanisms of effector mediated cell 
lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting from C1q binding, and antibody 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or more of the Fcγ receptors on the surface of 
granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding to CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes has 
also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. 
The same indications were sought as for the reference product MabThera. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, the recommended indications were aligned with the indications of the 
originator MabThera, which had been extended as follows:  
Ruxience is indicated in adults for the following indications:  
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) 
Ruxience is indicated for the treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular 
lymphoma in combination with chemotherapy. 
Ruxience maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients 
responding to induction therapy. 
Ruxience monotherapy is indicated for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma who 
are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy. 
Ruxience is indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, 
prednisolone) chemotherapy. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 
Ruxience in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with previously 
untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. Only limited data are available on efficacy and safety for

patients previously treated with monoclonal antibodies including rituximab or patients refractory to 
previous rituximab plus chemotherapy. 
See section 5.1 for further information.  
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Ruxience in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe 
active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to other 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) including one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) 
inhibitor therapies. 
Ruxience has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and 
to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate. 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis 
Ruxience, in combination with glucocorticoids, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
severe, active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). 
Pemphigus vulgaris  
Ruxience is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV).  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Ruxience is a biosimilar medicinal product (reference product MabThera). It is presented as a sterile 
concentrate for solution for infusion containing 100 mg in a 10 ml vial or 500 mg in a 50 mL vial of 
rituximab as active substance. Rituximab is formulated with commonly used excipients: L-histidine, L-
histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, disodium edetate, polysorbate 80, sucrose and water for 
injections (WFI).  
Ruxience is provided in sterile, preservative-free, nonpyrogenic, single use Type I glass vials. Ruxience 
is supplied in packs of 1 vial for each strength. 
The necessary amount of Ruxience is aseptically withdrawn from the vial and diluted to a calculated 
concentration of 1 to 4 mg/mL rituximab into an infusion bag containing sterile, pyrogen-free sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% D-Glucose in water. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Rituximab, also referred to as PF-05280586, is a genetically engineered chimeric mouse/human 
monoclonal antibody representing a glycosylated immunoglobulin with human IgG1 constant regions 
and murine light-chain and heavy-chain variable region sequences. The antibody is produced by 
mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell suspension culture and purified by a series of 
chromatography, viral inactivation and filtration steps. 
The total molecular weight of rituximab with post-translational modifications is approximately 147 kDa. 
One N-linked glycosylation consensus site is present, which is occupied with mainly core-fucosylated, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020  
Page 10/76 
 
 
 
complex-type biantennary N-linked glycans with zero or one terminal galactose residues. Each light 
chain consists of 213 amino acids and each heavy chain 451 amino acids. 
Rituximab binds specifically to the transmembrane antigen, CD20, a non-glycosylated phosphoprotein, 
located on pre B and mature B lymphocytes. The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen 
on B lymphocytes and the Fc domain can recruit immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis. 
Possible mechanisms of effector mediated cell lysis include complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) 
resulting from C1q binding, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by one or 
more of the Fcγ receptors on the surface of granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Rituximab binding 
to CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes has also been demonstrated to induce cell death via apoptosis. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacture 
The manufacturing of the active substance takes place at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co 
KG, Birkendorfer Straße 65, 88397 Biberach an der Riss, Germany.  
Rituximab is produced using a recombinant CHO cell line. Cells are grown in suspension culture using 
chemically-defined (CD), animal-derived component-free (ACF) media. 
The main steps of the manufacturing process are cell culture, recovery and purification.  
A conventional two-tiered cell banking system is employed, consisting of a Master Cell Bank (MCB) 
from which Working Cell Banks (WCB) are derived.  
The active substance is manufactured in production bioreactors. One production bioreactor leads to 
one bulk active substance lot. Bulk active substance lots are not combined at the active substance 
stage. 
The manufacturing of rituximab PF-05280586 starts from a WCB, expansion of cell culture in 
flasks/bags followed by seed bioreactor, production culture in production bioreactor from which the 
active substance is harvested and purified using an affinity chromatography step, a virus inactivation 
step, ion exchange chromatography steps, virus retention filtration, ultra-/diafiltration (UF/DF) and 
final formulation and filtration.  
The active substance is provided in appropriate container closure systems. 
Control of materials 
No raw materials of animal or human origin are used during the active substance manufacturing 
process. 
The development of the dual gene expression factor for rituximab was described in sufficient detail. 
Key steps in the development of the PF-05280586 production cell line from the transfection event to 
the establishment of the WCB are described.  
The Master Cell Bank (MCB) was generated in accordance with cGMP and ICH Q5D. The WCB was 
generated in accordance with cGMP. Testing and characterisation of MCB and WCB lots were performed 
according to the ICH Q5D guideline.  
The sequence for rituximab was demonstrated to be present in MCB, WCB, and end-of-production 
(EOP) cells. The characterisation and testing of the expression constructs follow ICH Q5B.  
Any new WCB will be created from MCB, following established manufacturing procedures as described 
and will be qualified to ensure comparability to the existing WCB. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020  
Page 11/76 
 
 
 
Specifications of raw materials (compendial and non-compendial) have been provided.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Process controls for the cell culture / harvest and purification process have been listed and their 
analytical procedures described.  
Process validation 
The validation of the PF-05280586 active substance manufacturing process has been completed and 
includes four process verification batches (also referred to as PPQ) that are from four independent, 
consecutive thaws of the WCB. Results of in-process controls (IPCs) and process parameters for all unit 
operations are reported and show compliance with the proposed requirements. 
Removal of the following process-related impurities has been investigated: DNA, HCP, trace elements 
and organic compounds that were derived from the host cells, medium, or purification process. The 
observed levels of impurities were below acceptance criteria. Validation summaries for the analytical 
procedures used in these impurity removal studies have been provided.  
Holding times of process materials of several stages have been established. 
Transportation studies have been performed to show that a uniform temperature can be maintained to 
ship frozen active substance to the finished product manufacturing site. 
Manufacturing process development  
The applicant has developed the process in line with principles outlined in ICH Q8, Q9, Q10 and Q11. A 
science- and risk-based approach was used to develop the understanding of PF-05280586 critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) and a robust manufacturing process to consistently deliver the desired quality 
for this product.  
The PF-05280586 active substance manufacturing process was stated to be developed using the 
applicant’s platform host cell line and cell culture and purification processes and the applicant relied on 
prior knowledge. A summary of process development changes has been provided, showing that only 
minor changes throughout the process have been made from development batches to commercial 
batches. The target product quality attribute range has been established by the applicant, but 
proposed limits have been later amended when setting the release specification. CQAs have been 
defined and their criticality assessment provided, both for the active substance and finished product on 
their own and for similarity purposes with the licensed rituximab product. Most CQAs are controlled via 
release and stability testing or as IPCs. Non-criticality of other quality attributes has been adequately 
justified.  
The applicant has provided a general discussion on how criticality assessment was performed, using 
Cause & Effect Matrix, experimentation and FMEA approach. Upon request, the applicant further 
justified the development approach, criticality assessment, and process description.   
The provided information on the overall control strategy of the quality attributes is considered 
acceptable. 
Characterisation  
A comprehensive series of analytical methods have been used for the characterisation of Ruxience.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The PF-05280586 finished product is supplied as a liquid concentrate for solution for infusion. The 
active substance is formulated with L-histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, edetate 
disodium dihydrate, polysorbate 80, sucrose and water for injections. 
Both the 100 mg strength in 10 mL vial and 500 mg strength in 50 mL vial of finished product 
presentations are supplied in a clear glass vial sealed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an 
aluminium seal with flip-off plastic cap.  
The finished product contains no preservative and is for single use only. 
The composition of the finished product is sufficiently described. No novel excipients are used. The 
quality of the excipients is acceptable. The formulation is different from that of the reference product; 
the applicant sufficiently justified the proposed formulation.   
The QTPP and the CQAs have been provided. Development studies support the chosen commercial 
manufacturing process. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is straightforward and typical for a liquid biological medicinal product and 
involves active substance thaw, addition of formulation buffer, sterile filtration and aseptically filling 
into vials Information on the sterilisation of the container closure system components (vials and 
stoppers), including validation of the sterilisation cycle if not according to Ph. Eur. conditions, was 
provided. PF-05280586 finished product presentations are manufactured using the same process steps 
and controls. The only differences to produce the different presentations are the fill volume and vial 
size.  
The applicant has not identified any critical process parameters but has defined hold times and 
included several in-process tests. This is in line with development studies and the overall control 
strategy.  
The manufacturing process has been validated at commercial scale and demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The specification for the finished product includes control of appearance, pH, extractable volume, sub-
visible particles, protein concentration, osmolarity, charge heterogeneity, identity, purity and 
impurities, potency, endotoxin and sterility and other general tests. 
The control of finished product is well-assured.  
Upon request, several active substance and finished product specifications were tightened. Elemental 
impurities according to ICH Q3D are sufficiently discussed.  
Analytical procedures 
The description of proposed methods and their validation is acceptable.

Batch analyses 
The detail of batches manufactured to support the MAA requirements and process validation were 
provided together with batch analysis data for the 100 mg and 500 mg presentations. All batches met 
the acceptance criteria in place at the time of release. The results demonstrate consistency of the 
manufacturing process capabilities. All batches comply with the commercial acceptance criteria. 
Reference standard 
The reference standard used for analysis of the finished product is the same as that used for the active 
substance. 
Stability of the product 
Stability information for PF-05280586 finished product stored under recommended long-term condition 
of 5 +/- 30 C, accelerated condition of 25 +/- 20 C/60 +/- 5% relative humidity (RH), as well as 
thermal stress, thermal cycling, and photostability conditions were provided. The stability program has 
been designed to follow ICH guidelines for stability of finished product.  
Based on the review of the provided stability data the following shelf life and storage conditions of the 
unopened vial and diluted medicinal product are considered acceptable: 
- Unopened vial: 24 months (2°C – 8°C) protected from light.  
- Diluted medicinal product:  
•  After aseptic dilution in sodium chloride solution 
The prepared infusion solution of Ruxience in 0.9% sodium chloride solution is physically and 
chemically stable for 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C plus an additional 24 hours at ≤ 30°C.  
•  After aseptic dilution in D-glucose solution  
The prepared infusion solution of Ruxience in 5% D-glucose solution is physically and chemically 
stable for 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C plus an additional 24 hours at ≤ 30°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, the prepared infusion solution should be used immediately. If not 
used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user 
and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in 
controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
No material of animal or human origin have been used in the generation and preparation of the cell 
banks and during the manufacturing of the active substance. The MCB, WCB and EOP cells have been 
screened sufficiently for adventitious viruses. These tests failed to demonstrate the presence of any 
viral contaminant with the exception of intracellular type A retroviral particles, which is well known for 
rodent cells. This is acceptable since there is sufficient capacity within the Ruxience purification 
procedure for the reduction of this type of viral particles. Therefore, there are no concerns for the use 
of the WCB in the production process of Ruxience. The unprocessed bulks are further tested to be free 
of adventitious viruses by in vitro assay including cell line for detection of a broad range of viruses 
including MMV. The purification process of the antibody includes several steps for inactivation/removal 
capacity for enveloped viruses and removal of non-enveloped viruses. The virus safety of Ruxience has 
been sufficiently demonstrated.

Compliance with the TSE Guideline EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3 has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Biosimilarity 
General and methodological aspects  
The applicant performed three comparisons to support a global development (PF-05280586 (Ruxience) 
to EU-originator (MabThera), also described as rituximab-EU, reference product); PF-05280586  
(Ruxience) to US-originator (Rituxan, also described as rituximab-US); rituximab-EU to rituximab-US).  
The originator batches were sufficiently identified and described.   
A sufficient number of PF-05280586 active substance and finished product lots were produced at 
developmental and commercial scale and included in the similarity assessment.  
Analytical methods 
The applicant submitted extensive information on analytical methods, especially non-routine analytical 
methods, including summary information regarding qualification, in order ‘to demonstrate that the 
selected methods used in the biosimilar comparability exercise would be able to detect slight 
differences in all aspects pertinent to the evaluation of quality’.   
Impurities 
The general approach towards process-related impurities is considered in line with current guidance 
(which explicitly acknowledges that differences may be present, provided that levels are minimised as 
appropriate), and therefore acceptable.  
Results and discussion on analytical comparability 
- Identical primary structure/amino acid sequence has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
- Peptide map/microheterogeneity generally supports biosimilarity. Data presentation indicates that 
rituximab displays limited microheterogeneity.     
- Size distribution / purity is considered comparable (levels of dimers tend to be slightly lower in PF-
05280586 compared to the originator). 
- Comparable higher order structure has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
- Charge variants / hydrophobic heterogeneity; although differences in charge variants where found, 
these are mainly due to variants which are well-known to be clinically irrelevant.    
- Comparable strength/protein content has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
- Glycan analysis: total afucosylation and total galactosylation are within the same range and from that 
point of view comparable.  
- Binding properties have been extensively investigated in conjunction with in vitro biological 
activity/potency.  
- Taken together, the data on glycosylation, FcγRIIIa-158F receptor binding and ADCC assays are 
consistently pointing to a slightly higher affinity and biological activity. 
- In vitro biological activity/potency; CD20-binding and apoptosis; in vitro CDC and C1q binding; 
FcγRIIIa 158V binding and NK ADCC (V/V, V/F), FcγRIIa-binding, FcRn-binding, and a cell based 
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) reporter gene assay (RGA) are considered 
comparable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
PF-05280586 is a chimeric immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody (mAb) developed 
as a biosimilar product to the European Union (EU) approved reference product (RP), MabThera. The 
nonclinical pharmacology of PF-05280586 was compared to rituximab-US and rituximab-EU in a 
number of in vitro assays that were evaluated for fragment-antigen binding (Fab) and fragment-
crystallisable (Fc)-related biological activity. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Rituximab is a genetically engineered chimeric mouse/human monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 
antigen on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Rituximab is known to have multiple 
mechanisms of action (MoAs). The Fab portion of rituximab binds to CD20 target antigen and can kill 
target cells by apoptosis. Binding of rituximab to complement triggers Fc-mediated binding to C1q 
followed by CDC, which is also a known MoA for rituximab. Finally, also ADCC, which is mediated by 
FcγRIIIa (158V or 158F) receptors, is another known MoA for rituximab, while ADCP, mediated by the 
binding of FcγRIIa (131H or 131R) receptors, has been identified as a plausible MoA for rituximab.  
Comparable results of PF-05280586 with rituximab-US, and rituximab-EU were found in terms of their 
ability to bind to CD20 , for inducing apoptosis  and also for binding to C1q and inducing CDC .  
Using a primary NK cell ADCC assay,, comparable NK ADCC V/V, V/F activity between PF-05280586, 
rituximab-US, and rituximab-EU was demonstrated. Also binding to FcγRIIIa 158V (by SPR) was found 
to be similar but with respect to the binding to the low affinity FcγRIIIa 158F receptor a  higher affinity 
of PF-05280586 as compared to rituximab-EU was observed, which may be related to different 
glycosylation levels.   
An ADCC FcγRIIIa-158V reporter gene assay (ADCC RGA) assay was presented to assess the 
downstream signaling pathway.  
Binding to FcγRIIa (SPR), evaluated as a surrogate for plausible mechanisms of action of rituximab, 
the ADCP activity, was reported to be similar with respect to binding to FcγRIIa 131H  and 131R. To 
assess functional ADCP activity, a cell-based FcγRIIa ADCP reporter gene assay (ADCP RGA) was 
developed. PF-05280586 was found to have similar effects as the rituximab-EU and the ranges in ADCP 
activity (% EC50) were overlapping demonstrating similar functional ADCP activity between PF-
05280586 and licensed rituximab-EU.  
FcRn binding may affect antibody in vivo half-life. Slight differences in FcRn SPR binding activity were 
observed but additional lot testing showed that PF-05280586 lot results fall within the quality range as 
established with the rituximab-EU results.  
Similar binding was found to FcγRI, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIIb receptor. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two in vivo intravenously (IV) dosed monkey GLP studies were performed and toxicokinetic (TK) and 
anti-drug antibody (ADA) evaluations were conducted in support of single-dose TK/tolerability and 
repeat-dose toxicity/TK studies in cynomolgus monkeys with PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU. In these 
studies a commercial scale development batch of PF-05280586 in its final clinical formulation was 
used. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020  
Page 20/76 
 
 
 
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantitation of PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU 
in cynomolgus monkey serum was developed and sufficiently validated. Two electrochemiluminescence 
(ECL) assays were developed and adequately validated to detect the presence of ADAs in cynomolgus 
monkey serum.   
Toxicokinetic analysis was performed after a single 2, 10, or 20 mg/kg IV dose of PF-05280586 or 
rituximab-EU to male and female cynomolgus monkeys and after four weekly IV dosing of 20 mg/kg of 
PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU to cynomolgus monkeys . There were slight but not consistent 
differences in systemic exposure (Cmax, AUC) in both studies, which may have been influenced by 
ADA induction. There was a 100% (6/6 animals at each dose level) induction of ADAs to PF-05280586 
or rituximab-EU in this single dose study and a 79% (11/14 animals) and 43% (6/14 animals) for PF-
05280586 or rituximab-EU, respectively, in the 4 week repeated dose study. This seems lower than in 
the single dose study but it should be noted that the detection of ADAs appeared to be hampered by 
the presence of rituximab/PF-05280586 in the samples. 
The ADA induction in monkeys, which occurred following single dosing, is expected given the nature of 
rituximab (chimeric mouse/human IgG) and is much larger than the percentage ADAs induction, which 
have been found in humans. Given the inter-animal variability, the small number of animals and the 
low predictability for humans, the ADA induction and related influence on rituximab exposure (Cmax, 
AUC) is not considered of relevance for biosimilarity assessment. 
Overall, the systemic exposure and ADA induction for PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU seemed 
comparable. 
No formal studies on absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and drug-drug interaction were 
performed for PF-05280586, which is acceptable for a biosimilar and agreed by the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
In a single dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, PF-05280586 was compared to rituximab-EU. 
There were no adverse effects in any dose group, apart from the pharmacological effect of B-cell 
reduction which was similar for both PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU. Therefore, the safety profile after 
a single dose of rituximab up to 20 mg/kg is similar for the test item PF-05280586 as compared to the 
reference product rituximab-EU. 
Comparative single and repeated dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys were performed, to 
compare the safety profile of PF-05280586 with the reference product rituximab-EU. Monkeys were IV 
dosed with vehicle control or 2, 10 or 20 mg/kg PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU in the single dose study, 
and with vehicle control or 20 mg/kg PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU weekly for 5 doses in the repeated 
dose study. Both studies included a 13 week recovery period. No adverse effects were observed in 
either study apart from the expected effects related to the pharmacological effect of rituximab, which 
were comparable for both products. Therefore, the safety profile after single or repeated dosing of 
rituximab at up to 20 mg/kg/week is similar for the test item PF-05280586 as compared to the 
reference product rituximab-EU.  
The value of these studies in terms of biosimilarity assessment is limited however, since it is 
questionable whether any small differences would have been detected. In addition, it is noted that 
these studies are not required according to current guidelines, but were initiated prior to the revision of 
the biosimilar guidance.   
No studies assessing genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, local tolerance, phototoxicity, 
immunotoxicity or other toxicity have been performed, which is according to current guidelines.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies have been performed by the applicant (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
PF-05280586 is a monoclonal antibody consisting of naturally occurring amino acids. As such it is not 
expected to have any impact on the environment. The absence of further ERA studies is sufficiently 
justified. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Rituximab binds to the CD20 target antigen on normal and malignant cells. Binding to CD20 is the first 
step of the known mechanism of action (MoA) for rituximab. This binding is then followed by antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), in which antibody-coated malignant cells are killed 
through engagement of effector cells with active Fc receptors. In addition, the binding of the Fc portion 
of rituximab to the C1q molecule results in the assembly of the membrane attack complex on the cell 
surface (complement-mediated cytotoxicity, (CDC)). Binding of rituximab to the CD20 antigen on the 
target cells can also induce apoptosis via the caspase-dependent pathway. Antibody-dependent cellular 
phagocytosis (ADCP) has been identified as a plausible MoA, mediated by the binding of Fcγ receptors 
on macrophages to antibodies bound to antigens on the cell surface. 
CD20 binding, C1q binding, CDC and apoptosis activity support biosimilarity. In addition, binding to 
FcRn, FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIIb receptor was found to be similar. To assess functional 
ADCP activity, an FcγRIIa 158V ADCP RGA was developed demonstrating similar functional ADCP 
activity between PF-05280586 and licensed rituximab-EU. Also binding to FcγRIIIa-158V was found to 
be similar but with respect to the binding to the FcγRIIIa-158F receptor a higher affinity was found.  
Overall a comprehensive assessment of PF-05280586 and rituximab in multiple in vitro ADCC assays 
using various sources of effector cells and target cells was presented and the data points to similar, i.e. 
overlapping, ranges of responses for the  ADCC  assays when using the 158V/V or 158V/F genotype, 
except for the ADCC RGA-158V assay, for which a higher response was found with PF-05280586. NK 
ADCC data are in line with the FcγRIIIa-receptor binding data obtained with PF-05280586, where the 
binding affinity data of the 158fV genotype was overlapping with rituximab-EU, while the 158F-
genotype binding data were higher and only partly overlapping with rituximab-EU data range.  
In addition, the data, in line with literature reports, showed a positive correlation between 
glycosylation (afucosylation) and NK ADCC activity, for which the F/F genotype was found to be most 
sensitive for differences in glycosylation.  
These differences in ADCC activity are considered minor but its clinical relevance for patients having 
the F/F genotype is not studied and therefore , it was agreed  that ADCC t be controlled through 
release testing of PF-05280586. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that Ruxience is biosimilar to the rituximab MabThera. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Biosimilarity of Ruxience to Mabthera in terms of non-clinical aspects was demonstrated.

included data for all primary data endpoints and secondary endpoints.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In the pivotal biosimilarity study B3281001, Rituximab-US, rituximab-EU, and PF-05280586 exhibited 
similar PK profiles. More importantly, the 90% CIs for test to reference ratios of Cmax and AUC0-∞ were 
contained within the pre-specified acceptance boundaries of 80.00% to 125.00% for all of the pair-
wise comparisons among the 3 study drugs, demonstrating PK similarity among rituximab-US, 
rituximab-EU, and PF-05280586.  
Table  3 summarises the ratios of adjusted geometric means and the corresponding 90% CIs for the 
primary comparisons in the PP population. For the PK similarity comparisons of PF05280586 to each of 
the RPs (rituximab-EU and rituximab-US), the 90% CIs for the testto reference ratios of Cmax, AUC0T, 
AUC0-2wk and AUC0-∞ were within the bioequivalence acceptance criteria of 80.00% to 125.00%. For the 
comparison of rituximab-EU to rituximab-US, the 90% CIs of the ratios of Cmax, AUC0-T, and AUC0-∞ 
were also within 80.00% to 125.00%.

Effect of ADA on PK 
In RA patients (study B3281001), the serum concentrations of PF 05280586, rituximab-EU or 
rituximab US appeared to be lower in ADA positive subjects compared to ADA negative subjects; 
however, this observation should be interpreted with some caution given the small numbers of 
subjects who were ADA positive. The effect of ADA on PK in ADA positive subjects seems to be similar 
between rituximab-EU, rituximab-US, and PF-05280586. 
In LTB-FL patients (study B3281006), there did not appear to be a consistent trend for a difference in 
mean post-dose serum concentrations between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects in either 
rituximab-EU or PF-05280586 treatment group. However, upon a closer look it is noted that during the 
Week 13 ADA sampling, serum rituximab concentrations in ADA positive subjects were roughly 1.3-fold 
lower than in ADA negative subjects for the PF-05280586 treatment group, whereas this decrease was 
1.1-fold for the rituximab-EU treatment group.  Given the small numbers of ADA positive subjects and 
the variability in the PK parameters, this comparison between treatments should be interpreted with 
caution. Overall, there does not seem to be a major difference in effect of ADA on PK between PF-
05280586 and rituximab-EU. 
Bioanalytical methods 
All PK samples were measured with an ELISA method. This ELISA method with a calibration range of 
100-5000 ng/mL has been sufficiently validated with respect to precision, accuracy, selectivity, 
specificity, dilution linearity, ADA-interference, and tested stability. Accuracy and precision data using 
validation samples (VS) for rituximab-EU, rituximab-US, and PF-05280586 prepared at 5 
concentrations each met the usual acceptance criteria for ligand binding assays. 
All human samples collected for evaluation of immunogenicity were analyzed using two validated 
assays, one specific for PF-05280586 and one specific for the licensed rituximab. The employed three-
tiered strategy including a screening, confirmatory and neutralisation assay is in agreement with the 
Assessment report

Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo clinical use 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010). The methods were sufficiently validated and were cross-validated 
against the alternate antigen. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic outcome of CD19 positive B-cell count was routinely monitored in the 
comparative clinical trials of PF-05280586. 
Methods: Study B3281001 and B3281004 
The primary objective of study B3281001 was to demonstrate PK bioequivalence between PF-
05280586 and rituximab-EU and rituximab-US. The secondary objective was to demonstrate 
equivalence regarding PD. The study was performed in RA patients. In total, 73 subjects were assigned 
to rituximab-US, 74 subjects to rituximab-EU, and 73 subjects to PF-05280586. The patients received 
a single course of 2 x 1000 mg IV infusion, with a two-week interval, in line with the posology of the 
reference product. Subjects with an adequate clinical response could continue three courses of further 
treatment in extension study B3281004. Patients who were assigned to the Rituximab-EU or rituximab-
US in study B3281001 were switched randomly to PF-05280586 and patients who were assigned to PF-
05280586 in study B3281001 continued on this treatment. 
CD19+ cell counts of full blood samples were analyzed using a validated laser scanning cytometry 
(LSC) method. A secondary PD parameter was Serum IgM. CD19 positive B-cell counts and IgM were 
analysed on Days 1, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, and 169. Additional samples for analysis of 
CD19 positive B-cell counts were collected every 3 months during the follow–up period.   
Methods Study B3281006 
In efficacy and safety Study B3281006, 398 patients with low tumour burden follicular lymphoma 
(LTB-FL), were randomly assigned to PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU. The treatment consisted of 4 IV 
courses of 375 mg/m2 within 22 days. PD assessment of B-cell counts was one of the secondary 
objectives of this study. CD19 positive B-cell counts were determined prior to dose administration on 
Days 1, 8, 15, and 22. In long-term follow-up period after treatment, additional samples for analysis of 
CD19 positive B-cell counts were collected at Weeks 5, 13, 26, 39 and 52.

Results 
Study B3281001 and B3281004, RA patients 
The mean (±SD, n) CD19+ B-cell counts at Baseline were 94 (± 88, n=68), and 100 (±109, n=69), 
respectively, for PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU. A rapid depletion of CD-19+ B-cells occurred in all 3 
groups following the dose administration on Day 1. The mean CD-19+ B-cell count values decreased 
by 99.8% for both rituximab-Pfizer and rituximab-EU groups, at Week 25. In all groups, the CD19+ B-
cell counts remained low throughout the study duration of 25 weeks. There were no obvious 
differences among treatment groups regarding the CD19+ B-cell counts, or the mean change from 
Baseline in CD19+ B-cell counts. The median CD19 counts are shown in figure 3.3.2.1.  
Figure 1. The median CD19 counts (Study B3281001) 
At week 13 the percentage change of IgM from baseline is -11.5% and -22.2% for PF-05280586 and 
Rituximab-EU, respectively. At week 25 (End Of Trial point) this percentage was -24.2 and -21.0 
respectively. Similarity was shown for IgM between PF-05280586 and Rituximab-EU in the extension 
study.  
Also, reductions in RF (rheumatoid factor), ACPA (Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide Antibody), IgM and IgG 
were within the same range for PF-05280586 and Rituximab-EU assignment groups.  
Study B3281006 (LTB-FL patients): PD results 
At baseline, the serum CD19-positive B-cell counts results ranged from 0.6 to 2313.1 cells/uL across 
the 2 treatment groups. The median baseline CD19-positive B-cell count was 119.9 cells/uL in the PF-
05280586 group and 114.2 cells/uL in the rituximab-EU group. After the intensive treatment (4 IV 
courses within 21 days), CD-19-positive B-cell counts rapidly declined to near zero. The cell counts 
gradually recovered in the off-treatment follow-up (52 weeks).

PD results in ADA positive patients 
In Study B3281001, between 6-10 subjects in the three study arms were ADA positive.  
 In Study B3281001, the range of DAS28-CRP scores at Week 13 (mITT population) ranged from 1.15-
7.13 in the PF-05280586 group, and between 1.30-7.73 in the rituximab-EU group. The individual 
DAS28-CRP scores for ADA positive subjects listed in Table 3.3.2.1. The subgroups are considered too 
small to draw meaningful conclusions on the effect of ADA formation on efficacy and PD parameters.

Table 5. Mechanisms of Action of Rituximab Across Diseases 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PF-05280586 significantly and rapidly reduced CD19+ B-cell counts below the detection level, both in 
RA patients –with an in principle normal B-cell count at baseline-, as in patients with LTB-FL –with an 
increased B-cell count at baseline. PD response of PF-05280586 was overall similar to the comparator 
Rituximab-EU.  
Rituximab is known to effectively reduce the peripheral CD19+ B–cell counts. However, there is no 
strong correlation between the extent of peripheral B-cell reduction and clinical response in RA, as RA 
disease activity may still remain even at low B-cell counts. For lymphoma, the correlation is neither 
clear, since circulating B-cells may not directly reflect tumour mass, and CD19+ cell counts alone 
cannot be considered as a surrogate for the clinical response.   
Nevertheless, the comparative B-cell depletion data are considered as relevant supportive information 
for the assessment of bio-similarity and extrapolation to other non-investigated indications, since the 
B-cell levels indirectly reflect the potency of the drug of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
(ADCC), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and programmed cell death. The mechanism of 
action is the same for all indications and ADCP is considered a plausible MoA relevant for CLL.

Study B3281006 
A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study of PF-05280586 Versus Rituximab for the First-Line 
Treatment of Patients with CD20-Positive, Low Tumour Burden Follicular Lymphoma. 
Methods 
Study B3281006 is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled trial in patient with LTB-FL (low 
tumour burden follicular lymphoma). Patients were assigned to either the innovator product for the EU 
market (MabThera, called Rituximab-EU in this dossier), or the biosimilar product PF-052B0586, in a 
1:1 ratio. Patients were treated with an IV (intravenous) infusion course of rituximab at Day 1, 8, 15, 
22, in accordance with treatment guidelines.  
After the treatment period of 22 days, a visit was scheduled at Day 29, and every 3 months thereafter. 
The primary endpoint assessment took place at Week 26. The end of the study was Week 52.

Abbreviations: EU=European Union; R-EU=rituximab-EU; R-Pfizer=rituximab-Pfizer (PF-05280586) 
Study Participants 
Adult patients with histologically confirmed, Grade 1-3a, CD20-positive FL, containing no elements of 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, were eligible.  
The diagnosis was first made by the Investigator. Low tumour burden was assessed according to the 
Groupe d’Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) criteria (Brice, 1997).  
A nodal lesion must have been at least 11 mm x 11 mm OR ≥6 mm in the greatest transverse 
diameter (regardless of short axis measurement). An extra-nodal lesion must have been at least 10 
mm x 10 mm. 
Patients were in Ann Arbor Stage II, III, or IV. 
Patients with evidence of histologic transformation to high grade or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were 
excluded. Patients with poor prognostic factors, such as high lactate dehydrogenase and β2-
microglobulin, and B-symptoms (>10% unintended weight loss, fever and night sweats) were 
excluded.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020  
Page 29/76 
 
 
 
 
  
Patients had LTB-FL, defined as: a) Serum LDH ≤ 1.5 × ULN, b) β2-microglobulin ≤1.5 × ULN, c) 
Largest nodal or extra-nodal mass <7 cm in diameter, d) No more than 3 nodal sites with a diameter 
>3 cm, e) No clinically significant serous effusions detectible on chest radiography, f) Spleen 
enlargement ≥16 cm by computed tomography (CT) scan, g) No complications such as organ 
compression or impairment, h) No B symptoms (i.e.  fever >38°C for 3 consecutive days; recurrent, 
drenching night sweats; or unintentional weight loss exceeding 10% body weight in 6 months). 
Furthermore, in order to participate to the study, patients had to be in reasonably good condition, 
meeting performance ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) status of 0 to 1. 
Treatments 
Rituximab (PF-05280586 or rituximab-EU) was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m2 at Visits 2, 3, 4, 
and 5 (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22). The maximum dose of rituximab that could be infused on 1 day was 
1125 mg.  
Infusion instructions were followed as per the product labelling. In order to prevent infusion reactions, 
precautionary measures were taken as established in the SmPC of the Innovator, such as a low 
infusion rate at the first administration (50 mg/hour), which can be gradually increased to a maximum 
of 400 mg/hour for the following administrations, if no infusion reactions occurred. Furthermore, all 
subjects received paracetamol, antihistaminic and prednisone (100 mg intravenous methylprednisolone 
or its equivalent) as a prophylaxis to prevent infusion reactions. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective was to compare the efficacy of PF-05280586 to rituximab-EU when administered as 
a first-line treatment to subjects with CD20-positive, low tumour burden follicular lymphoma (LTB-FL).  
The hypothesis being tested in this study was that the efficacy (as measured by overall response rate 
[ORR] at Week 26) of PF-05280586 is equivalent to that of rituximab-EU. 
Secondary Objectives were: 
•To evaluate the safety of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU. 
•To evaluate the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU. 
•To evaluate the immunogenicity of PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU. 
•To characterize CD19-positive B-cell depletion and recovery in patients receiving PF-05280586 and 
rituximab-EU. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy outcome 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR at Week 26, based on central review which included 
radiographic assessment and review of clinical data (B-cell depletion and bone marrow biopsy results).  
The ORR was defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved either complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR), based on the Lugano Classification (Cheson et al, 2007, 2014).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020  
Page 30/76 
 
 
 
- Complete response at Week 26 defined as per the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma 
(based on central review). Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and 
disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. All nodal index lesions must have regressed to the 
size of normal lymph nodes. 
- Partial responder rates. The designation of PR at a subsequent time point requires a >50% decrease 
in the sum of the products of the diameters (SPD) of all index lesions. 
- Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. 
- Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from date of randomization to first progression of 
disease (PD, based on central review) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD. 
- Time to treatment failure (TTF) defined as the time from date of randomization to progression of 
disease based on central review, death due to any cause, or permanent discontinuation from 
treatment, or discontinuation from study for any reason, whichever came first. 
- Duration of response (DOR) defined as the time from date of the first documentation of overall 
response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of PD (central review) or to death due to any cause in 
the absence of documented PD.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 study treatment arms: arm A (PF-05280586) 
and arm B (rituximab-EU).   
The site could randomize an eligible subject using an automated web-based randomization system 
(IMPALA) provided by the sponsor. A computer-generated randomization schedule was used to assign 
subjects to the treatment groups.  
Randomization was stratified by low, medium, and high-risk subjects using the FLIPI2 score (Follicular 
Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2).  
Statistical methods 
Analyses of the primary endpoint 
The primary hypotheses were tested for ORR in order to show that PF-05280586 is equivalent to 
rituximab-EU, within an acceptance margin of -/+ 16%.  
The primary efficacy analysis for equivalence was performed after all randomized subjects (ITT) had 
had the opportunity to complete their Week 26 visit and the assessment of overall response. The 
estimated difference in ORR between PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU was computed (based on the 
stratified Mantel-Haenszel method), and the asymptotic 95% CI of the difference, as proposed by 
Miettinen and Nurminen (1985), was constructed. The FLIPI2 categorization (low, medium, and high) 
was considered as the stratification factor in the Mantel-Haenszel (for the estimated treatment 
difference) and Miettinen and Nurminen (for the 95% CI) methods.  
A missing value was defined as no post-baseline response assessment either due to loss to follow-up 
or withdrawal by subject or other reasons. In the primary analysis, if a post-dose response assessment 
was missing, the overall response was imputed as a non-responder instead of a missing value.  
When the -/+ 16% acceptance criterion was met, an additional analysis was required to be conducted 
to test equivalence using -/+ 14.9% as criterion, in accordance to requirements from the regulatory 
authority in Japan.

In addition, sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome was performed in the PP-population.  
The endpoints Complete Remission (CR) and Partial Response (PR) at Week 26 were analysed in a 
similar fashion as ORR. 
A log-rank test stratified by FLIPI2 risk was used to compare the treatment groups with respect to PFS 
at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. Progression-free survival was also summarized using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for the 1-year PFS rates, and the 2-sided 95% CI of the rates 
using the Greenwood’s formula were reported. In addition, a Cox model stratified by FLIPI2 was used 
to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% CI for the treatment effect. 
Similar methods as for PFS were used for the analyses of Overall Survival, Time to Treatment Failure 
and Duration of Response outcomes.  
Results 
Participant flow 
There were 394 subjects assigned to the double-blind treatment; 196 subjects in the PF-05280586 
group and 198 subjects in the rituximab-EU group. Of these, 393 subjects were actively treated 
including 196 treated subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 197 treated subjects in the rituximab-EU 
group (mITT). There was 1 subject who was assigned to the rituximab-EU group who withdrew from 
the study prior to receiving treatment. 
In total, 194 [99.0%] subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 196 [99.0%] subjects in the rituximab-
EU group completed the 4 weeks treatment course. 
In total, 340 subjects had completed Week 52 of the study (170 [86.7%] subjects in the PF-05280586 
group and 170 [85.9%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group.

There were 54 (13.7%) subjects who discontinued from the study (23 [11.7%] subjects in the          
PF-05280586 group and 28 [14.1%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group). The most frequent reason 
for discontinuation was progressive disease as assessed by the investigator (14 [7.1%] subjects and 
20 [10.1%] subjects in the PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU groups, respectively).

Disease characteristics 
The mean (SD) duration of FL since diagnosis was 0.69 (1.285) years, which was comparable between 
the treatment groups.  
The randomisation stratification factor FLIPI2 was balanced between the treatment groups. The 
majority had a FLIPI2 risk classification of medium and low at baseline. In line with inclusion criteria, 
LDH was normal or marginally increased. About 28% had bone marrow involvement.

Co-morbidity 
About 25% of the population had a history of cardio-vascular disorders. The use of any prior drug 
treatments was comparable between the 2 treatment groups, reported by 140 subjects (71.4% and 
71.1%) in the PF-05280586 group and rituximab-EU group, respectively.  
The most frequently reported concurrent drug treatments were agents acting on the renin-angiotensin 
system (23.9% and 20.9%), beta-blockers (9.6% and 13.3%), simvastatin (8.2 and 5.6%), and 
acetylsalicylic acid (11.7 and 8.6%) in the PF-05280586 group and Rituximab-EU group, respectively.  
Numbers analysed 
The ITT Population (394 [100.0%] subjects) was used for the primary efficacy analyses of the primary 
and secondary endpoints.  
The PP Population (342 [86.8%] subjects) was used for sensitivity analyses of the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 26. Reasons for exclusion from the PP Population are provided in 
the table below. The most frequent reason for exclusion from the PP Population was no evaluable Week 
26 assessment (based on central review) with 20 (10.2%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 14 
(7.1%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group.

Primary outcome 
The primary endpoint, i.e. the ORR by central review in the ITT population at Week 26, was 148 
(75.5%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group, and 140 (70.7%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group. The 
analysis of ORR showed an estimated difference of 4.66% (PF-05280586 minus rituximab-EU), with a 
95% CI of (-4.16%, 13.47%), which fell within the -16.0% to 16.0% pre-specified equivalence margin 
agreed to by the FDA and EMA. See Table below.

In the ITT Population, there was one (0.5%) subject who died in each treatment group. The cause of 
death was reported as disease progression for the subjects in both the PF-05280586 group and the 
rituximab-EU group. Neither event was considered by the investigator as related to treatment. Both 
cases were reported outside the protocol-specified active reporting period (through and including 28 
calendar days after the last study visit).

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses by age, gender, race and region, Ann Arbor Staging classification, bone marrow 
involvement, as well as by baseline FLIPI2 categorization were performed on the primary endpoint, the 
ORR at Week 26 (ITT). See plots in figure 3.3.5 and 3.3.6 below. In addition, also in a subgroup of 
very elderly, the data pointed at equivalence.

Supportive study(ies) 
Study  B3281001  and  its  extension  study  B3281004  were  conducted  to  compare  the  PK-PD  and 
immunogenicity of PF-05280586 with the EU and US rituximab innovator products.  
Study B3281001 
Study B3281001 was a blinded randomized study, in which subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 
ratio to one of the three treatment groups (PF-05280586, rituximab-EU, or rituximab-US).  
Primary objective of Study B3281001 was demonstrating PK bioequivalence. Secondary efficacy 
endpoints were disease activity scores using DAS28-CRP (mean change from Baseline),  LDAS (Low 
Disease Activity, defined as DAS28-CRP ≤3.2), Remission (defined as DAS28-CRP <2.6), EULAR 
responses , EULAR Response (categorized as no response, good response, and moderate response), 
HAQ-DI  and ACR assessments (ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responder rates).  
All randomized subjects (220 cases) received the study drug; 73 subjects (33%) rituximab-US, 74 
subjects (34%) rituximab-EU, and 73 subjects (33%) PF-05280586. A total of 192 of the 220 
randomized subjects (87.3%) completed the study. A total of 16 (7.3%) subjects discontinued before 
completing the study, including 5 (6.8%) rituximab-US subjects, 3 (4.1%) rituximab-EU subjects, and 
8 (11.0%) PF-05280586 subjects. The most frequent reasons for discontinuation from the study were 
‘no longer willing to participate in the study’ (6 [2.7%] subjects) and AEs (5 [2.3%] subjects). 
Statistics 
Descriptive statistics of all efficacy endpoints were provided without reporting confidence intervals. 
Additionally, the relative risk and its 95% confidence interval were computed for LDAS rate and 
DAS28-CRP remission rate for each pair-wise treatment comparison by visit, from the mITT population 
(defined as each randomised subject who received at least one dose of the study treatment). Missing 
data were imputed as non-responder for LDAS and remission rates. 
Results regarding efficacy Study 001:  
At inclusion, the mean DAS2CRP scores varied between 5.68 -6.22 between subgroups, indicating 
moderate-severe active disease stage. An imbalance in RA disease activity parameters at baseline was 
noted in Study B3281001, which was considerable higher for Rituximab-US versus the PF-05280586 
group. There was no relevant difference between Rituximab-EU group and PF-05280586 group in 
baseline disease activity.  
As after 16 weeks patients were able to leave for study B3281004, if the results of last visit before 16 
weeks (in this study week 13) were considered most relevant for efficacy assessment.  
The mean DAS28-CRP decreased from baseline with about 2 points and reached its plateau at Week 13 
in all 3 treatment groups. Such an improvement is considered a clinically relevant effect. The results 
were similar for PF-05280586 and Rituximab-EU. The 95% CIs of the differences between treatment 
groups regarding the decline of efficacy endpoints from baseline was not provided for any of these 
endpoints in the applicants dossier.

Table 18. Summary of DAS28-CRP baseline and change from baseline by visit (mITT 
Population)- Study B3281001 
From other secondary endpoints, LDAS scores, DAS remission rates and EULAR responses showed the 
same results as DAS28-CRP. At week 13, both LDAS rates and EULAR response for PF-05280586 and 
Rituximab-EU were 41.8% and 44.4% respectively. DAS remission rates at week 13 were 29.2% and 
28.4% for Rituximab-EU and PF-05280586 respectively. These remain stable till end of study at Week 
25. Relative risk analyses showed no statistical differences for LDAS and remission rates between 
treatments.  
Also, HAQ-DI and ACR responders (ACR20, 50 and 70) decline from baseline in all study groups, 
although at a lower extent for PF-05280586. At week 13 the percentage change in HAQ-DI scores for 
PF-05280586 was -14.6% and for Rituximab-EU -39.5%. ACR20 measures (non-responder imputation) 
for PF-05280586 and Rituximab-EU were 50.7% and 70.3% at week 13 respectively. At Week 25, the 
were 50.0% and 60.3%, respectively.  
Post-hoc analyses 
To match the subjects regarding the baseline in disease activity, applicant has conducted a post hoc 
Propensity Score (PS) analysis on request of the FDA, based on swollen joint count (66) and subject’s 
assessment of arthritis pain (VAS), and combined the rituximab-EU and rituximab-US groups. After 
propensity score matching, the baseline values and the outcomes regarding mean change from 
baseline of DAS28-CRP and HAQ-DI were similar for US reference product and PF-05280586. Also, 
efficacy responder rates indicated similarity. These data are only considered as supportive, as direct 
comparisons to the Rituximab-EU reference product are considered more relevant to establish 
biosimilarity for the EU target population and similarity was demonstrated as compared to the EU 
reference product). 
Study B3281004 
Design  
This was an extension study for subjects who had participated for in the prior Study B3281001. The 
objectives of the study were to provide access to continuous rituximab treatment in the participating 
RA patients, and to evaluate the overall safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of PF-05280586 
occurring after transition from a licensed rituximab product to PF-05280586.

Patient were eligible who completed the full study period for Study B3281001. In addition, patients 
could escape earlier to participation in extension study B3281004 after least 16 weeks, based on 
Investigator’s judgement and patient's willingness to comply with the extension study protocol. All 
subjects were offered three courses of study treatment. Subjects assigned to PF-05280586 in Study 
B3281001 continued to receive PF-05280586 throughout this study. Subjects who were assigned to 
the licensed products (Rituximab-EU or US) in Study B3281001 were assigned in a blinded manner 
(1:1) to receive either the previously assigned licensed product Rituximab-EU (E) or PF-05280586 (P) 
for the first course of treatment (E-PPP arm). The subjects who in the first instance were assigned to 
receive Rituximab-EU in Study B3281004, were also switched to PF-05280586 (E-EPP) in following 
courses.  
Results regarding efficacy Study B3281004: 
Overall, 185 subjects from 220 B3281001 Study subjects were randomized and included in Study 
B3281004. In total, 48/59 subjects completed the study for study arm P-PPP, and 30/33 for both study 
arms E-PPP and E-EPP, respectively. P-PPP refers to the group which received PF-05280586 in both 
Study B3281001 and extension study B3281004 (3 treatment courses) and were not switched, E-PPP 
group are the subjects which received Rituximab-EU in study B3281001 and PF-05280586 from the 
start of extension study. E-EPP refers to the group of subjects who received Rituximab-EU during study 
B3281001 and first course of Study B3281004, and then were switched to PF-05280586. 
Change from Baseline for DAS28-CRP score at course 3/ week 25 (end of trial) is shown below. The 
mean percentage changes in DAS28-CRP were -41.56%, -42.40% and -45.09% for P-PPP and E-EPP 
and E-PPP groups, respectively. 
Table 19. Summary of overall DAS28 and its components by treatment sequence and visit –

Similarly, to Study B3281001, LDAS rates, DAS remission rates in all groups showed equivalent 
efficacy regarding the mean changes from baseline in DAS28-CPR in Study B3281004. LDAS rates at 
week 25 (EOT) for P-PPP, E-EPP and E-PPP were 48.9%, 48.3% and 58.6% respectively (CIs are not 
provided). For the subjects who took all 3 courses of treatment, all treatment groups showed 
comparable profiles in DAS remission rate. The DAS remission rates at Course 3, Week 25 were 
34.0%, 37.9% and 41.4% in the P-PPP, E-EPP and E-PPP treatment groups, respectively. 
HAQ-DI mean percentage changes from baseline at week 25 (EOT) for P-PPP, E-EPP and E-PPP were -
23.7%, -37.7% and -48.7% respectively. At Course 3, Week 25 the ACR20 responders, for P-PPP, E-
EPP and E-PPP were 59.6%, 66.7% and 89.7% respectively.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study B3281006 in Patients With LTB-FL  
One pivotal randomised, double-blind, active controlled study was performed in an oncology model, to 
demonstrate equivalence of efficacy of the biosimilar product and the EU reference product. In 
addition, a randomised single dose study, followed by its extension study was performed in RA as a 
model of an auto-immune disorder. The RA study was only considered as supportive, since it was not 
powered to demonstrate equivalence of efficacy, while it was powered to demonstrate bioequivalence 
of PK.  
The pivotal study enrolled subjects with LTB-FL (low-tumour burden follicular lymphoma) who were 
asymptomatic for lymphoma specific B-symptoms, an early disease stage where either WW (watchful 
waiting without active treatment), radiotherapy or rituximab monotherapy could be applied according 
to the ESMO European treatment guideline (Annals of Oncology 27 (Supp 5): v83–v90, 2016). There is 
no clear evidence that starting rituximab early would improve overall survival. However, according to 
the European treatment guideline ESMO (2016), rituximab monotherapy could be an option for LTB-FL 
when taking into account the patient’s perspective, who may prefer early rituximab treatment as WW 
brings along uncertainties. In addition, radiotherapy may be associated with side-effects at certain 
locations, such as e.g. sicca syndrome or hypothyroidism at cervical location, or mucositis or 
myeloablative suppression due to abdominal radiation.    
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020  
Page 47/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The choice of the LTB-FL as a model is supported, as rituximab monotherapy allows for the assessment 
of biosimilarity without the potentially confounding factors that would be introduced by combining 
rituximab with chemotherapy in more advanced stage patients. MabThera is not authorised for the 
treatment of LTB-FL. However, the SAWP/CHMP agreed with the choice of LTB-FL as a mode to 
investigate equivalence, as it was considered as a more sensitive model to detect potential differences 
between the reference product and the biosimilar product.   
The design of the pivotal study (randomised, double blind) is considered adequate, and in accordance 
to the SAWP advice. The choice of the comparator, EU-sourced Rituximab, is supported; the lack of a 
placebo arm is considered acceptable, however, as assay sensitivity can be assumed given the large 
treatment effect (ORR difference versus placebo of >70%) that has been reported for rituximab in a 
similar population in literature (Ardeshna, 2014, Kahl, 2014). Notably, the ORR rates in the pivotal trial 
were similar as reported in studies from the literature.  
The choice of the primary endpoint (ORR at Week 26) is considered adequate for a biosimilar exercise. 
ORR is a sensitive and well-established endpoint for follicular lymphoma studies. Since overall survival 
is expected to be high in LTB-FL, it would require a very large and long-term study to establish an 
effect on overall survival. The end-of-treatment after 4 courses is already at Day 22, conform 
treatment guidelines. However, as the PD effects of rituximab are prolonged and it may take time 
before the tumours resolve. Therefore, it is agreed that the primary analyses were scheduled at Week 
26.   
As discussed in the SAWP in 2014, the equivalence margin of +/- 16 % was based on a single 
randomised controlled study in LTB-FL patients by Ardesha. The Ardesha study showed a large 
treatment effect of Rituximab versus the control of Watchful Waiting (78% versus 7%). The proposed 
equivalence margin of +/- 16% was based on both statistical and clinical arguments. The +/- 16% 
margin was agreed by the SAWP/CHMP in the scientific advice from 2014, provided that the ORR 
responder rates with PF-05280586 and EU-Rituximab would be in the same range as reported for 
Rituximab in the Ardesha study. This was indeed the case, which provides confirmation that differences 
within the equivalence margin of 16% will not likely overlap with the control. In addition, the clinical 
relevance of the confidence interval of -4.14% to 13.47 of the ORR was discussed. Considering the 
treatment effect observed for rituximab in LTB-Fl patients, differences within the equivalence margin of 
16% is considered reasonable from a clinical perspective. A slightly (numerically) higher ORR response 
was observed for the biosimilar product PF-05280586 versus the EU innovator product. However, this 
was not associated with differences in quality, PK, PD or Safety. 
The primary endpoint was assessed centrally by two independent readers. When there was 
disagreement between the two readers, a third adjudicated reader made the final diagnoses. The inter-
rater agreement of radiographic outcomes between the two readers was 80.2%. Treatment group 
differences in ORR at Week 26 were consistent with the total group analysis, with or without 
agreement among raters. 
For the primary analyses, the ITT population was chosen. PP-analyses were performed as sensitivity 
analyses. However, according to ICH E9 guideline, the use of the full analysis set in an equivalence 
trial is generally not conservative, and therefore, the differences between the ITT and PP analyses 
were further explored. A total of 22 (11.1%) and 30 (15.3%) of randomized subjects in the rituximab-
EU and PF-05280586 groups, respectively, were excluded from the PP analysis population. This 
included subjects without a measurable disease at baseline, as assessed by the central reader, i.e.  13 
(6.6%) of subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 9 (4.5%) of subjects in the rituximab-EU group.  
Given that response is expected to be high in subjects with no measurable disease at baseline, this 
may have slightly favoured the ITT population as compared to the PP population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020  
Page 48/76 
 
 
 
On the other hand, disproportionally more patients were excluded in the PF-05280586 arm because their 
radiography was considered invaluable by the central readers at Week 26. This occurred in 20 (10.2%) 
subjects  in  the  PF-05280586  group  and  14  (7.1%)  subjects  in  the  rituximab-EU  group.  Given  that 
subjects with no evaluable Week 26 assessment were imputed as non-responders in the ITT analysis but 
removed from the PP analysis, may have resulted in a favour of ORR the PF-05280586 group in the PP 
analysis. Despite the different approaches across the ITT and PP analyses, the conclusions from both 
analysis  populations  are  consistent.  Altogether,  there  is  no  indication  of  systematic  bias  regarding 
reasons for exclusion from the PP- analysis and the potential favourable/unfavourable effects for the PP 
and ITT populations appear to be balanced. Protocol deviations were reported, as might be expected in 
a multiple centre clinical setting. These did not impact the final results.    
The RA studies were only supportive for evaluating efficacy and safety. This can in principle be agreed, 
given that an adequately powered study has been performed in a sensitive model of lymphoma, 
without interference of background chemotherapy. For biosimilar products, it is not required to 
evaluate equivalence of efficacy in each indication separately, and extrapolation of studies in other 
models can be accepted, if adequately justified. For RA treatment, the same mode of action of 
rituximab applies, as for the lymphoma indication. For conclusions see also under Section 6 of this 
report, Biosimilarity assessment.  
The design of the RA studies, i.e. randomised and double-blinded, is considered adequate. The 
comparators (EU and US sourced Innovator product) are considered appropriate.  
In accordance with the labelling of the Innovator product, patients irresponsive to prior TNF-inhibitor 
treatment were included, indicating that the patients had quite advanced RA at baseline. Only sero-
positive patients (RF, or ACAP) were included, whereas the Reference product labelling does not 
exclude sero-negativity. Considering that seronegative RA patients are reported to have a lower 
response to rituximab, the study population is not fully representative for the whole RA population. 
However, because seropositive patients are more sensitive to the treatment, it is justified to exclude 
seronegative RA subjects from the study which is intended to show similarity.  
Primary endpoint of B3281001 study was determining PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-∞. Explorative 
efficacy outcomes were mean change of DAS28-CRP (and their mean change from baseline), DAS28-
CRP responder rates (LDAS ≤3.2, and remission <2.6), ACR responder rates and HAQ-DI were 
determined as secondary endpoints. However, DAS28-CRP as a continuous endpoint, has been 
recommended by the CHMP as a sensitive endpoint to establish biosimilarity in the Scientific Advice for 
this product. Post-hoc analyses indicated similarity of DAS28-CRP scores between PF-05280586 and 
rituximab-EU, within the margins of 0.6 points difference –which is generally considered as not 
clinically relevant.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study B3281006 in Patients With LTB-FL  
In total, 196 subjects were randomly assigned to PF-05280586 and 198 subjects to rituximab-EU 
treatment. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the two 
treatment groups.  
The vast majority completed the four weekly courses of rituximab monotherapy. The primary endpoint, 
i.e. the ORR by central review in the ITT population at Week 26, was 75.5% in the PF-05280586 
group, and 70.7% subjects in the EU-Rituximab group. The analysis of ORR showed an estimated 
difference of 4.66% (PF-05280586 minus rituximab-EU), with a 95% CI of (-4.16%, 13.47%), which 
fell within the -16.0% to 16.0% pre-specified equivalence margin agreed to by the CHMP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020  
Page 49/76 
 
 
 
The ORR consist of two components: complete responders (CR) and partial responders (PR, defined as 
>50% clearance of the tumours). These separate endpoints CR and PR also supported equivalence. 
Furthermore, equivalence criteria were also met for ORR in the sensitivity analysis (per-protocol), 
indicating robustness. Subgroup analyses also showed that the conclusions regarding equivalence were 
similar across subgroups.  
Another secondary outcome is PFS. The number of events (disease progression) was numerically 
higher for PF-05280586 (37 (18.9%) versus 28 (14.1%)) at Week 52. The hazards ratio of PFS was 
not statistically significant different in either ITT or PP analyses. In each study arm, there was one fatal 
case of disease progression. Censoring occurred in about 80% in each treatment arm. 
Extrapolation to other indications 
To what extent the equivalence of efficacy between a rituximab biosimilar and reference product –thus 
not the response itself- can be extrapolated from a lymphoma to auto-immune disorders is a matter of 
debate. On one hand, rituximab specifically targets the transmembrane CD20 antigen, in both normal 
as well as malignant B-cells, and binding to the CD20 epitope is similar for normal as well as malignant 
B-cells. This was demonstrated by the fact that CD19 cell counts –as a marker of CD20+ cells- rapidly 
declined to detection in both the RA studies, as well in the LTB-FL study that are part of this dossier.   
As discussed in the non-clinical section, binding of rituximab to CD20 leads to direct apoptosis, or Fc 
receptor mediated lyses (CDC, ADCC). Both ADCC and CDC are considered relevant for RA and 
NHL/CLL. ADCP may be relevant for CLL indication specifically.  
Considering this, it is accepted that only a single pivotal study in an oncology model, with an additional 
PK-PD study in RA, were chosen to demonstrate equivalence in efficacy for all indications in the study 
program of PF-05280586. The CHMP considered extrapolation of similarity to all indications for the 
other rituximab biosimilar products acceptable, based on those studies and the totality of evidence 
from Quality and in-vitro binding and functional assays.  
RA studies 
In general, the efficacy outcomes of Week 13 of Study B3281001 were considered most informative, 
given that patients could escape to the extension study early from Week 16.  
Although not formally tested, the following results supports the equivalence in efficacy between         
PF-05280586 and MabThera: in study B3281001 for DAS28 (CRP) the mean changes at 13th week were 
-2.0 for Ruxience and -2.1 for Rituximab-EU, LDAS rates were 44.4% for Ruxience and 41.8% for 
Rituximab-EU at the 13th week of the study. Also, DAS28-CRP remission responder rates were highly 
similar. In general, maintenance of response was observed in the extension studies for the efficacy 
outcomes, also after switching from Rituximab-EU to PF-05280586. However, the data should be 
interpreted carefully and rather considered as supportive, given that a selected population will continue 
treatment in the extension phase. Also, carry-over effects of prior treatment cannot be excluded after 
switching.  
A response in HAQ-DI and ACR20 response was observed in the studies, however, to a lesser extent 
for PF-05280586 as compared to Rituximab-EU. E.g. in Study B3281001, ACR20 was 70.3% in the 
rituximab-EU group versus 50.7% in the PF-05280586 group, and 60% versus 50% at Week 25. For 
HAQ-DI, a functional outcome, at week 13 the percentage change for Ruxience was -14.6% and for 
rituximab-EU -39.5%. The differences between ACR and DAS28 responder rates are probably due to 
HAQ-DI, as ACR includes HAQ-DI scores as a part of this composite endpoint, whereas the DAS28-CRP 
score does not include this scale. For other individual endpoints that are shared for the DAS28-CRP and 
ACR composite scores, such as number of painful/swollen joints, CRP-response, similar results were 
shown between treatment arms.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020  
Page 50/76 
 
 
 
Reassuringly, patients who were switched from Rituximab-EU to PF-05280586 in Study B3281004, 
maintained their relatively high HAQ-DI and ACR20 response as obtained after the first course of 
treatment with Rituximab-EU. This indicates that this apparent difference may be due to incomplete 
randomisation, rather than a true treatment effect. Notably, there were no differences observed in PK-
PD, ADA formation, and the more sensitive RA outcomes (DAS28-CRP), and these outcomes all 
support similarity. Furthermore, the study population included patients in advanced treatment stage 
(irresponsive to TNF-inhibitors), and there might have been limited room for improvement of physical 
function in these patients, due to permanent structural joint damage at baseline.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the pre-defined criteria for equivalence were met for the primary endpoint ORR in the pivotal 
trial in patients with LTL-FL. The outcomes of the RA studies were supportive for similar efficacy for 
Ruxience and the innovator product.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Comparative safety data of the biosimilar product and the European innovator product MabThera were 
obtained from three randomised clinical trials: one in low tumour burden follicular lymphoma (LTB-FL, 
Study B3281006), and two in RA (i.e. a single treatment course trial, followed by an extension trial 
with 3 other courses, including a switching arm).  
Safety data of the lymphoma study and the RA studies were not pooled, because of the differences in 
dosing schedule (an intense 3 weeks treatment course for LTB-FL, versus a relatively low dose chronic 
treatment for RA), and background therapy (none for LTB-FL, MTX for RA) of these two disorders. 
Patient exposure 
Study B3281006, in patients with low tumour burden follicular lymphoma 
Study B3281006 has a total of 394 subjects assigned to the double-blind treatment; 196 subjects in 
the PF-05280586 group and 198 subjects in the rituximab-EU group. Of these, 393 subjects were 
actively treated including 196 subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 197 subjects in the rituximab-EU 
group. No background therapy of cytostatic drugs was given. All subjects randomized and treated with 
at least 1 dose of study drug were included in all safety analyses. 
Overall, 390 subjects had completed study treatment (subjects would have completed protocol 
specified 4 weekly cycles of study treatment on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22).

Adverse events 
Study B3281006 – Subjects With LTB-FL 
The majority of all subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE, with 156 (79.6%) subjects in the PF-
05280586 group and 145 (73.6%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group reporting a total of 607 and 670 
events, respectively.   
Table 22. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (All Causalities) - Safety Population, Study 
B3281006 
The incidence of TEAEs (treatment emergent AEs) was generally comparable between treatment 
groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were infusion related reaction (49 [25.0%] subjects 
in the PF-05280586 group and 59 [29.9%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group), pruritus (13 [6.6%] 
subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 22 [11.2%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group), and 
headache (16 [8.2%] subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 19 [9.6%] subjects in the rituximab-EU 
group).  
The percentage of patients with grade 3-4 AEs were low a similar between groups. The most frequently 
reported Grade 3 TEAEs by PT were infusion related reactions in the PF-05280586 group (4 [2.0%] 
subjects) and hypertension in the rituximab-EU group (4 [2.0%] subjects). The only Grade 4 TEAE was 
neutropenia reported in 1 (0.5%) subject in the rituximab-EU group, which was considered related to 
treatment but was not associated with any signs or symptoms of infection. No Grade 5 events were 
reported in this study.

AEs of special interest (Study B3281006 – Subjects With LTB-FL) 
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  were  pre-defined  by  the  applicant  (Tier-1)  as  infections,  infusion 
related  reactions,  neutropenia,  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML),  and  tumour  lysis 
syndrome. These events were selected based on the established safety profile of rituximab.  
Infections (grade 3-4) 
In the PF-05280586 treatment group there were 5 subjects (2.3%) who experienced a Grade 3 
infection, including a Clostridium difficile infection, which was considered serious and treatment 
related. Three (1.5%) subjects in the rituximab-EU group experienced 4 Grade 3 infection events, 
none of which were considered related to treatment. 
No cases of PML occurred.  
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was reported in one (0.5%) subject in the PF-05280586 group and three (1.5%) subjects 
in  the  rituximab-EU  group.  The  one  subject  in  the  rituximab-EU  group  had  a  Grade  4  event  of 
neutropenia,  which  was  considered  related  to  treatment  but  was  not  associated  with  any  signs  or 
symptoms of infection. 
Infusion-related reactions 
The most frequently reported TEAEs of special interest were infusion-related reactions (IRRs). IRRs 
were reported for 49 [25.0%] subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 59 [29.9%] subjects in the 
rituximab-EU group.  
Tumour lysis 
No cases occurred.

Study B3281001 
Non-serious AE of special interest were defined as urticaria. There was a one case of urticaria in this 
study which happened in Rituximab-US group. 
Grade 3 treatment-related infections occurred in 4/73 (5.5%) patients in PF-05280586 group and 0/74 
(0.0%) patients in Rituximab-EU group. These 4 AEs consisted of: arthritis bacterial, bronchitis, 
bacterial sepsis and septic shock and sinusitis.  
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) occurred in 10/73 (13.7%) patients in PF-05280586 group and 5/74 
(6.8%) patients in Rituximab-EU group.  
Study B3281004

in E-PP group consist of 1 bronchitis and 2 cases of pneumonia. 
Course 3  
Grade 3 treatment related infections occurred in 2/48 (2.9%) patients in P-PPP group, 0/30 (0.0%) 
patients in E-EPP group and 3/30 (6.8%) in E-PPP group. 2 cases in P-PP group consisted of 1 case of 
arthritis infective and postoperative wound infection, each. 6 cases in E-PPP group consist of 1 case of 
bronchitis, wound infection staphylococcal, sinusitis and UTI, each and 2 cases of pneumonia. 
Infusion related reactions:  
In total, 6 subjects experienced an IRR during the study that were all assessed as related to the study 
treatment (3, 2 and 1 in the P-PPP, E-PPP, and U-PPP group, respectively). Five subjects who 
experienced IRRs that resulted in a dose reduction or temporary discontinuation, one of the subjects 
was withdrawn permanently.  
Course 1  
Among the subjects who received treatment during Course 1, the number of subjects (exposure-
adjusted incidence) reporting IRRs were 2/58 (6.9%), 0/32 (0.0%) and 0/33 (0.0%) subjects in the P-
P, E-E and E-P groups, respectively.  
Course 2  
Among the subjects who received treatment during Course 1 and Course 2, the number of subjects 
(exposure-adjusted incidence) reporting IRRs were 2 (3.8%), 0 (0.0%) and 1 (3.2%), subjects in the 
P-PP,E-EP and E-PP groups, respectively, by the end of Course 2.  
Course 3

Among the subjects who received 3 courses of treatment, the number of subjects (exposure adjusted 
incidence) reporting IRRs were 2 (2.9%),0 (0.0%) and 1 (2.3) subjects in the P-PPP,E-EPP and E-PPP 
groups, respectively, by the end of Course 3. The IRRs were throat irritation and infusion related 
reaction (1 subject each in P-PPP group) and infusion related reaction (1 subject in E-PPP). 
Neutropenia:  
In Study B3281004, during Course 2 there was a single case of neutropenia in P-PP group. (1/54) 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): 
PML was not reported in none of the RA studies.  
Other common TEAEs (not pre-defined as of special interest), Study B3281006 – Subjects 
With LTB-FL 
Tier-2 events were those that occurred in at least 6 subjects (3% or higher) in either treatment group 
and that were not Tier-1 events.  
The most frequently reported Tier-2 TEAEs by PT were headache (16 [8.2%] subjects in the PF-
05280586 group and 18 [9.1%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group), nausea (15 [7.7%] subjects in 
the PF-05280586 group and 16 [8.1%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group), diarrhoea (13 [6.6%] 
subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 12 [6.1%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group), and fatigue 
(12 [6.1%] subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 13 [6.6%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs Study B3281006 – Subjects With LTB-FL 
Overall, 17 (8.7%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 15 (7.6%) subjects in the rituximab-EU 
group experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE. The highest incidence of SAEs reported 
occurred in the Infections and infestations SOC (4 [2.0%] subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 3 
[1.5%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group) 
Concurrent solid tumours were reported for 3 [1.5%] subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 1 [1.0 
%] subjects in the rituximab-EU group.  
The Investigators considered the following SAE treatment related: Clostridium difficile infection and 
pyrexia (reported for PF-05280586), and a single case of Serious infusion reaction and serum sickness 
for rituximab-EU. The sponsor concurred with these assessments, except for the pyrexia case, as the 
reported event occurred after study drug was discontinued for 1 month.

Fatal cases, Subjects With LTB-FL 
Two deaths were reported (one for each study drug), and disease progression was described for each 
of the cases. The two cases are summarized below;  
Subject 10291002, a 65-year-old male in the PF-05280586 group, died on Day 128 due to disease 
progression. The last dose of study treatment was administered on Day 20. Approximately 2 months 
after the last dose of study treatment, the subject was hospitalized due to disease progression and 
died. An autopsy was not performed. 
Subject 11081001, a 76-year-old male in the rituximab-EU group, died on Day 573 due to disease 
progression. The subject had a medical history of papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum and 
squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The last dose of study treatment was administered on Day 22. 
On Day 485, the subject was diagnosed with high grade transformation to diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (stage 4) and commenced treatment. He did not respond well to treatment and 
subsequently died. An autopsy was not performed. 
RA studies 
An analysis with regard to the incidence of Grade 3 or higher treatment-related AEs is provided by the 
applicant. Treatment-related Grade 3 AEs were reported in a total of 6 subjects: 2 subjects in the 
rituximab-US group and 4 subjects in the PF-05280586 group. All AEs were assessed as non-serious 
and none of them were reported as Grade 4 or Grade 5. All AEs were considered recovered/resolved 
with the exception of 2 AEs of local swelling and bronchitis, both in the PF-05280586 group. 
B3281001: 
A total of 4 subjects (1.8%) were withdrawn from treatment due to an AE: 1 subject (1.4%),1 subject 
(1.4%), and 2 subjects (2.7%) receiving rituximab-US, rituximab-EU, and PF-05280586, respectively. 
A total of 10 (4.5%) subjects had an SAE including 1 (1.4%) subject receiving rituximab-EU, and 5 
(6.8%) subjects receiving PF-05280586 (Table 31). The one rituximab-EU subject had an SAE of 
thrombocytopenic purpura. Five PF-05280586 subjects had SAEs of cardiac failure (1 subject), 
intentional self-injury (1 subject), presumed bone neoplasm (1 subject), bacterial arthritis (1 subject), 
and bacterial sepsis and septic shock in 1 subject.

Table 25. Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred 
Term (mITT Population) 
There was 1 death in Study B3281001. Subject 11611005, a 66-year-old White female, was receiving 
PF-05280586 and experienced a Grade 5 presumed bone neoplasm 51 days after the first dose of 
study drug. The patient was discontinued from the study due to this AE and subsequently died.  
B3281004: 
The most frequent SAE was pneumonia in all 3 courses. Other SAEs in Ruxience and MabThera groups 
included anaemia, febrile neutropenia, pericarditis, bronchitis, subcutaneous abscess, UTI, 
staphylococcal wound infection, viral gastroenteritis, syncope, TIA, hydronephrosis, ureterolithiasis, 
COPD. In total in course 1 incidence of SAEs for PP group was 4/58 (13.7 n/PY*100), for EE group 
2/32 (13.7 n/PY*100) and for EP group 2/33 (13.7 n/PY*100). In course 2 total incidence of SAEs for 
PPP group was 6/54 (11.3 n/PY*100), for EEP group 1/30 (3.6 n/PY*100) and for EPP group 4/31 
(12.7 n/PY*100). In course 3 total incidence of SAEs for PPPP group was 4/48 (5.7 n/PY*100), for 
EEPP group 1/30 (2.4 n/PY*100) and for EPPP group 4/30 (9.1 n/PY*100) (Table 31).

Table 26. Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class, and 
Preferred Term – Subjects who received Courses 1, 2 and 3 treatment (mITT Population) 
No new or unexpected safety concerns emerged from Study B3281004, including in those subjects who 
switched from reference product to PF-05280586. There were 2 subjects experiencing AEs of malignant 
events in Study B3281004, basal cell carcinoma (Grade 2, non-serious and event considered not 
related to study treatment) was reported in a subject randomized to the E-PPP group. This case was a 
continuation of an event that began in Study B3281001; and squamous cell carcinoma (Grade 3, non-
serious and considered related to study treatment) was reported in a subject randomized to the E-PPP 
group. 
No death was reported for this study. 
Laboratory findings 
In general, there were no meaningful differences in clinical chemistry and haematology parameters 
between PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU in the pivotal trial in LTB-FL patients. LFT (liver function test) 
abnormalities were uncommon, as expected since rituximab is not thought to be hepatotoxic. Mild 
lymphopenia was commonly reported in this study (17.8% and 19.1%, for rituximab-EU and PF-
05280586, respectively), as may be expected considering the mode of action of rituximab.  
As reported before for rituximab therapy, neutropenia was common (18.8% and 20.6 for rituximab-EU 
and PF-05280586, respectively), although grade 3 was only reported for one subject in the PF-
05280586 group (0.5%). In the rituximab-EU group, grade 3 neutropenia was reported for two cases 
(1.0%), and one grade 4 case was reported (0.5%). 
There were no meaningful differences between clinical chemistry and haematology results in different 
groups in both 001 and 004 studies.

Safety in special populations 
One pregnancy occurred in the RA trial.  
One subject in the U-UPP treatment group of Study B3281004 reported a pregnancy which was found 
to be a blighted ovum later. The onset of the serious adverse event was 154 days after the most 
recent dose of study medication (PF-05280586). Concomitant therapy taken within 2 weeks before the 
onset of the event of blighted ovum included Cilest (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), folic acid, 
methotrexate, and naproxen. Subject had an obstetric history which included 1 miscarriage and 1 
normal birth. PF-05280586 was permanently discontinued in response to the event and the subject 
was discontinued from the study due to pregnancy. The case was not considered PF-05280586 
treatment-related by the Investigator. 
Immunological events 
Subjects with LTB-FL (Study B3281006) 
Overall, 38 (19.5%) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 37 (18.8%) subjects in the rituximab-EU 
group had at least 1 post-dose sample that tested positive for ADA.  
Overall, the percentage of subjects reporting immune-based adverse effects was comparable across 
both treatment groups, and also between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects (See Table 3.3.8.9 
below).

The number of ADA-positive patients (i.e. post-treatment ADA) was comparable for both treatment arms 
in the final Week 52 data set (PF-05280586: n=43 [22.1%]; rituximab-EU: n=39 [19.8%]). 
RA studies: 
B3281001: 
Samples that tested ADA positive after the first dose only (post-baseline only, at any time during the 
study) were reported for 10.9% and 10.8% of the subjects in the PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU 
groups, respectively.  
Of the 2 subjects with persistent ADA and the highest titres, 1 subject had CD19+ B-cells depleted 
post-dose for the entire study duration up to Day 169, while the CD19+ B-cells for the other subject 
were undetectable following dosing, and became detectable again after Day 85, reaching 
approximately 5% of the pre-treatment baseline on Day 141.

B3281004: 
At EOT point there was one ADA positive case in P-PPP group (N=48). There were no ADA positive 
cases reported for other arms of the study. 
No samples were tested postivie for Neutralizing Antibody (Nab) in any of the studies. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not applicable for biosimilars. Reference is made to the reference product.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Permanent discontinuations from the study due to AEs were low and comparable between the two 
treatment groups in each of the clinical studies.  
Study B3281006 – Subjects With LTB-FL 
There were 3 (1.5 %) subjects in the PF-05280586 group and 2 (1.0 %) subject in the rituximab-EU 
group who permanently discontinued the study due to AEs. For PF-05280586, this was a single case of 
infusion reaction including angioedema symptoms, and a case of maculopapular rash, and Grade 2 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which was not considered as related to study treatment by the investigator. 
For rituximab-EU, this was a SAE of serum sickness, and a SAE of bladder cancer, which was not 
considered by the investigator as related to study treatment.  
RA studies:  
Study B3281001: 
One rituximab-EU subject discontinued due to a TEAE of thrombocytopenic purpura, and two PF-
05280586 subjects discontinued due to AEs of bacterial sepsis and upper respiratory tract infection, 
respectively. 
Study B3281004: 
The TEAEs leading to withdrawal from study treatment among the subjects that received Course 1 
treatment were the following: 1/58 subject in the P-P group (rash papular),1/32 E-E group (transient 
ischaemic attack) and 1/30 U-P group (bacterial arthritis). Among the subjects that received treatment 
in Course 1 and Course 2, withdrawal cases were 1/54 subject in the P-PP group (cellulitis) and 2/29 
subjects in the U-UP group (oral candidiasis and blighted ovum). Among the subjects that received 3 
courses of treatment, there was 1/29 subject in the U-PPP group (cellulitis).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database size is rather small, and only provides insight in common AEs. For a biosimilar 
application, the numbers of subjects are considered acceptable and sufficient. Reference should be

made to the innovator for rare events, as these could not be evaluated in the relatively small 
equivalence studies. 
In Study B3281006 – Patients With LTB-FL, 1-year safety and immunogenicity data have been 
provided. Overall, the incidence, and nature of the AEs and SAE were similar between PF-05280586 
and rituximab-EU, in the pivotal trial in LTB-FL. The safety profile is in line what has been reported 
before for the innovator MabThera, with infusion reactions, infections and neutropenia as most 
common findings.  
Rituximab monotherapy is not specifically indicated for the treatment of LTB-FL according to the SmPC 
of MabThera. No unexpected safety issues emerged for rituximab in this setting.  
The rates of ADA-formation were balanced between PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU, As reported 
before for rituximab, there was no clear relationship between ADA-formation and infusion reactions.  
For historic data of NHL studies, lower rates of ADA were reported than in this study in LTB-FL. 
However, it is noted that for NHL, rituximab is given on top of combination chemotherapy, which was 
not provided in the LTB-FL study, combination chemotherapy may suppress ADA-formation. The rates 
of ADA-formation of rituximab monotherapy in patients with LTB-FL of Study B3281006 was however 
within limits as reported before for auto-immune disorders.  
Overall the safety profile of PF-05280586 was comparable with Rituximab-EU during RA studies. The 
safety profile was in line with the innovator rituximab-EU and no new concerns emerged from this 
study regarding rituximab. Although these studies in RA patients were not powered to confirm safety, 
the outcomes of them are considered relevant.  In line with earlier experiences, infections and 
potential infusion reaction related events were the most commonly reported AEs in the RA population. 
These were equally distributed in study arms. In the RA studies, the rate of ADA formation was higher 
for rituximab-EU than for PF-05280586 (6/73 versus 10/74). However, this does not necessarily 
indicate that similarity is at stake. The number of neutralising ADA was null for all the study arms. 
There was no clear relationship between ADAs and safety/efficacy. 
In the RA studies, there were numerically less ADA positive subjects in the PF-05280586 arm (10.9%) 
than in the two rituximab-arms (EU: 14.9%, US: 15.1%). No NAbs were detected in ADA positive 
subjects.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In general, the incidence and nature of the AEs were similar between biosimilar product and the 
Reference product. There were no new safety signals or unexpected findings. Immunogenicity was 
moderate and similar to the innovator product. The safety aspects as in the Mabthera PI are applicable 
to the product information of Ruxience.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
PF-05280586 (also called rituximab-Pfizer in the dossier) has been developed as a biosimilar product of 
MabThera (also called Rituximab-EU in this report).  
The same indications are claimed as established for the EU reference product MabThera, i.e. non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (advanced stage III-IV follicular lymphoma) on top of chemotherapy, CLL (chronic lymphatic 
leukaemia),  moderate-severe  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  in  the  second  line  after  TNF-inhibitor  failure, 
Granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis  and  microscopic  polyangiitis  (GPA  and  MPA)  and  Pemphigus  vulgaris 
(PV). 
At the time of this opinion MabThera is indicated for the treatment of adults only.  
Summary of biological data (Quality & Non-Clinical) 
An extensive physicochemical comparability exercise has been presented.   
Comparative in vitro data were presented on: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Binding of PF-05280586 and rituximab (EU/US) to the target, CD20 binding.

131H Reporter Gene Assay.  
The in vitro data were presented by the applicant in Module 3, however, some functional data were 
assessed in the non-clinical AR. 
Comparative in vivo data were presented on: 
- 
Toxicokinetics, safety, B-cell count and immunogenicity in cynomolgus monkeys (SD and 4 
week repeated dose).   
Clinical studies 
In total, three clinical trials were performed.  
Study B3281006 was a 52-week, randomised, double blind, controlled study in low-tumour burden 
follicular lymphoma (LTB-FL). The primary objective of this was to evaluate equivalence of efficacy. 
Patients were eligible in case of histologically confirmed, Grade 1-3a, CD20-positive FL, containing no 
elements of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The largest nodal mass was not allowed to exceed 7 cm in 
diameter, and the maximum number of nodal sites was 3. Patients with poor prognostic factors like B-
symptoms (fever, night sweats and weight loss), or high lactate dehydrogenase at baseline were 
excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to rituximab monotherapy with four weekly infusions of 
375 mg/m2 (n=198 to Rituximab-EU and n=196 to PF-05280586). Stratification factor was FLIPI1 risk 
category. The primary endpoint ORR (Overall Responder Rate, i.e. the sum of Complete Responders 
(CR) and Partial Responders PR (>50% reduction of the tumour load)), was established by two 
independent central reviewers at Week 26, based on radiological imaging. If there was no agreement,

a 3rd reviewer was assigned for final decision, taking into account clinical features such as CD19+ cell 
counts and bone-marrow involvement as well.  
In RA patients, Study B3281001 where a single treatment course was given, and its extension study 
B3281004 were submitted. The primary objective of Study 001 was to establish biosimilarity of PK, 
based on AUC0-∞ and Cmax as primary outcomes. PD measurement by CD19+ cell counts was 
secondary objective. The primary objective of Study 004 was to evaluate the effect of switching from 
licensed rituximab to PF-05280586. 
Study B3281001 was a randomised, double blind, study of 25 weeks duration. A standard dosage of 
two rituximab IV infusions (1000 mg) with a 14-day interval was given. Seventy-three subjects were 
assigned to Rituximab-US, 74 to Rituximab-EU, and 73 to PF-05280586. After 16-24 weeks, subjects 
from Study B3281001 could continue rituximab treatment in extension study B3281004. In total, 
59/73, 66/74 and 58/73 subjects from the Rituximab-US, Rituximab-EU ad PF-05280586 arms of 
Study B3281001 enrolled into Study B3281004, where three treatment cycles were given with a 16-24 
weeks interval, at the discretion of the prescriber. Subjects who received Rituximab-EU or Rituximab–
US at baseline of Study 004 were randomly switched to PF-05280586 in subsequent cycles.  
The RA studies were not powered to establish equivalence of efficacy, and only descriptive data were 
provided of secondary efficacy outcomes, such as disease activity scores DAS28-CRP (mean changes 
form baseline), its responder rate LDAS (low disease activity, defined as DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2) and 
remission (DAS28-CRP < 2.6), ACR20 responders and the functional score HAQ-DI. 
The clinical development plan was in accordance with the CHMP scientific advice. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality and in vitro pharmacology data 
- Identical primary structure/amino acid sequence has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
- Size distribution / purity is considered comparable (levels of dimers tend to be slightly lower in      
PF-05280586 compared to the originator). 
- Comparable higher order structure has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
- Charge variants / hydrophobic heterogeneity; although differences in charge variants where found, 
these are mainly due to variants which are well-known to be clinically irrelevant. 
- Comparable strength/protein content has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
- Glycan analysis: Total Afucosylation and Total Galactosylation are within the same range and in that 
respect comparable.γ. - In vitro biological activity/potency related to Fab functionality (CD20-binding, 
induction of apoptosis) or Fc functionality (C1q binding & CDC; FcγRIIa binding & ADCP 131H RGA; 
FcγRIIIa 158V & NK cell ADCC (V/V, V/F) and FcRn, FcγRI, FcγRIIb, and FcγRIIIb) are considered 
comparable.  
In conclusion, the analytical comparability data package is concise, and covers most of the relevant 
aspects of the product.  
Results supporting biosimilarity; Non clinical 
No significant differences in toxicokinetics, immunogenicity (ADA), safety and reduction in B-cell count 
were apparent in the single dose or 4 week repeated dose cynomolgus monkey study, and although 
limited the non-clinical data are considered supportive of the biosimilarity of the product to the 
originator.

Results supporting biosimilarity; Clinical Pharmacology 
In the pivotal biosimilarity study B3281001, the 90% CIs for test to reference ratios of Cmax and 
AUC0-∞ were contained within the pre-specified acceptance boundaries of 80.00% to 125.00% for all of 
the pair-wise comparisons among the three study drugs, demonstrating PK similarity among rituximab-
US, rituximab-EU, and PF-05280586. Furthermore, in all comparison cases, one (i.e. 100%) was 
always included in the 90% confidence interval (thus there were no “statistically significant differences 
in 90% CIs”) and all confidence intervals were in general evenly spread around one (100%). 
Therefore, based on the pharmacokinetics of this study B3281001 it is concluded that PF-05280586 
and rituximab-MabThera are biosimilar in RA patients. 
Drug concentration data from the Week 26 report for the Phase 3 study B3281006 in LTB-FL patients 
indicate similar rituximab serum concentrations at each time point between the two treatment groups 
and support the conclusion that PF-05280586 is biosimilar to rituximab-MabThera (EU) also in this 
disease population. 
Both in RA patients –with an in principle normal B-cell counts at baseline-, as in patients with LTB-FL –
with increased B-cell count at baseline, PF-05280586 significantly and rapidly reduced CD19+ B-cell 
counts below the detection level. In both disease models, the reduction of CD19+ B-cells was 
persistent for a long-term, for both PF-05280586 and Rituximab-EU. E.g. the CD19+ cell count 
remained reduced near detection level over 1.5 years of continued treatment (4 courses) of PF-
05280586 in Study B3281004.  
ADA (anti-drug antibody) formation was overall modest and balanced over the treatment groups; 
19.5% in the PF-05280586 vs 18.8% in the Rituximab-EU arm in LTB-FL patients at Week 26. and in 
8.2% in the PF-05280586 vs 13.5% in the Rituximab-EU arm, in RA patients with no impact on 
infusion related reactions or  CD19+ B-cell depletion or efficacy.  
Results supporting biosimilarity; Clinical Efficacy  
Study 006, LTB-FL patients 
In the pivotal efficacy trial 006, the primary outcome of ORR at Week 26 as established by central 
readers, was 75.5% in the PF-05280586 group, and 70.7% in the rituximab-EU group. The analysis of 
the ORR showed an estimated difference of 4.66% (PF-05280586 minus rituximab-EU), with a 95% CI 
of (-4.16%, 13.47%) (analyses in the ITT population). The difference of the primary endpoint ORR at 
Week 26 and its 95% CI were within the predefined equivalence margin of -/+ 16%. 
Equivalence of ORR was further supported by similarity of secondary endpoints (CR, PR, PFS) between 
the treatment groups, and the ancillary analyses demonstrating robustness of the primary endpoint 
over the diverse subgroups. The equivalence criteria were also met for the primary endpoint in the 
sensitivity analyses in the PP-subset (estimated difference 7.49, 95% CI -0.67, 15.80).  
Also at long-term follow up till 52 weeks, ORR and PFS remained similar between treatment groups. In 
the PP-analyses, ORR at 52 weeks was 68.2% for rituximab-EU and 68.1% for PF-052805 (difference -
0.15 (95% CI -10.10, 9.76). Hazard ratio of PFS after 52 weeks was 1.393 (95% CI 0.847-2.291) for 
the ITT population, with a p-value of 0.189. A similar outcome was reported for the PP population. 
Study B3281001 and B3281004, RA patients 
These studies were considered as supportive for efficacy. In Study 001, the mean change (SD) from 
baseline of DAS28-CRP was similar for PF-05280586 and Rituximab-EU at the short term at Week 13 (-
2.0 (1.43) and -2.1 (1.33), respectively, no formal statistic comparisons were performed). Clinical 
response reached its plateau at Week 13. The effect size is considered clinically meaningful, given 
mean baseline DAS28-CRP values of 5.68 (0.86) and 5.79 (0.95) for PF-05280586 and Rituximab-EU, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020

indicating moderate-severe disease activity. Clinical relevance and similarity are further illustrated by 
LDAS responder rates of 41.8% and 44.4% for PF-05280586 and Rituximab-EU, respectively, and 
DAS28-CRP remission rates of 29.2% and 28.4%, respectively. Maintenance of efficacy for these 
endpoints was observed in extension Study 004.  
Results supporting biosimilarity; Clinical Safety 
Overall, the nature and incidence of the adverse events was balanced between the study arms in the 
study in LTB-FL, as well as in the RA studies.  
As could be expected given the known safety profile of rituximab, infections and infusion reactions 
were commonly reported. In study B3281006, the incidence of infusion reactions was 29.9% and 
25.0%, for rituximab-EU and PF-05280586, respectively. Infections occurred in 32.0% and 26.5% of 
the subjects, respectively. Similar incidences were reported in the RA studies. These events were 
rarely reported to be serious. No new treatment related events emerged.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
•  Uncertainties; Quality and in vitro pharmacology 
 There are no uncertainties in terms of quality and in vitro pharmacology aspects. 
•  Uncertainties; Non-clinical in vivo data 
 There are no uncertainties in terms of biosimilarity on the non-clinical aspects. 
•  Uncertainties; Clinical Pharmacology 
There are no uncertainties in clinical pharmacology aspects. 
•  Uncertainties; Clinical efficacy and safety 
There are no uncertainties regarding clinical efficacy and safety data. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Quality 
The analytical comparability data package covers the relevant aspects of the product and supports the 
conclusion that high analytical similarity exists. The applicant satisfactorily addressed the Other 
Concerns raised during the procedure. From a quality point of view, biosimilarity with the reference 
product MabThera is considered demonstrated. 
In vitro Pharmacology 
The in vitro biological (pharmacological) activity of PF-05280586 was compared with Rituximab-EU, 
including most of the relevant modes of action (MoA) (apoptosis, CDC, ADCP and ADCC). It can be 
concluded that both compounds display similarity with respect to the ADCC F/F MoA.  
Clinical Pharmacology 
No relevant differences were noted regarding immunogenicity. There does not seem to be a major 
difference in effect of ADA on PK between PF-05280586 and rituximab-EU. Biosimilarity in terms of PK 
and PD was demonstrated. 
Clinical efficacy & Safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/155201/2020

In the RA studies, efficacy and safety were secondary objectives, and not formally tested. 
Bioequivalence of PK and PD was established in these studies. and the more sensitive RA outcome 
DAS28-CRP support similarity.  
There were no differences observed in PK-PD, ADA formation, other more sensitive RA outcomes and 
the study in LTB-FL, and these outcomes all support similarity.  
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Extrapolation of equivalence has to be made from the clinical studies in RA and LTB-FL, to approved 
indications NHL (higher grade than LTB-FL), CLL and the auto-immune disorder ANCA-vasculitis (GPA 
and MPA).  
On one hand, bioequivalence in PK and similarity in PD (reduction of B-cell counts), efficacy and safety 
has been demonstrated for PF-05280586 and Rituximab-EU, in two models (auto-immune disorder RA 
and haemato-oncology model LTB-FL). Similar study programs as for Ruxience, consisting of a 
supportive PK-PD study in RA and a pivotal clinical efficacy and safety in a lymphoma model, have 
been accepted before by the CHMP for other rituximab biosimilar products. The CHMP considered 
extrapolation of similarity to all indications for the other rituximab biosimilar products acceptable, 
based on those studies and the totality of evidence from Quality and in-vitro binding and functional 
assays.  
The comparative B-cell depletion, efficacy and safety and bio-equivalence between PF-05280586 and 
Rituximab-EU is considered relevant for the assessment of bio-similarity and extrapolation to other 
non-investigated indications, since this indirectly reflect the potency of the drug of antibody dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular 
phagocytosis (ADCP) and programmed cell death (apoptosis). These mechanisms of action may be 
applicable to all indications, irrespective whether these are malignant CD20+ B-Cells or normal CD20+ 
B-cells, as in auto-immune disorders. Yet, their relative contributions may vary among the different 
indications, e.g. ADCP may be more relevant for response in CLL (chronic lymphatic leukaemia). 
According to in-vitro assays, similarity between PF-05280586 and Rituximab was shown regarding 
these actions. . 
3.6.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Ruxience is considered biosimilar to Mabthera. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded.

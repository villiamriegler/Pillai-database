Scientific conclusions  
Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  Valdoxan,  the  scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
Data from PSUR 6 did not change the benefit-risk profile of the product.  
In  the  data  presented  efficacy  has  not  been  shown  in  patients  >  75  years  and  that  the 
recommendation was made agomelatine should not be used in this population. Respective changes in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC were recommended. 
Based  on  an  assessment  of  the  main  results  of  13  new  clinical  studies,  enrolling  approximately  5000 
patients with major depressive disorder, the overall efficacy of agomelatine based on outcomes on the 
HAM-D  scale  was  considered  modest,  but  generally  in  line  with  findings  from  previously  assessed 
studies that formed the basis for the EU approval in 2009.  
Hepatotoxicity remained the main safety concern. Data from this PSUR confirmed previous knowledge 
in this area. To clarify the recommendations in the SmPC, the PRAC considered that section 4.3 of the 
SmPC  should  be  updated  to  include  a  contraindication  in  patients  with  transaminases  exceeding  3  X 
upper  limit  of  normal.  Further  to  this, section  4.4 and  4.8  of  the  SmPC  should  be  updated  to  include 
information on cases of hepatic failure reported with fatal outcome or liver transplantation in patients 
with hepatic risk factors. Otherwise, the risk minimisation measures were  considered to be sufficient. 
The  MAH  was  in  the  process  of  performing  a  survey  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  these  risk 
minimisation measures, the results of which were to be discussed in the following PSUR.  
Skin reactions and suicide were still considered to be important potential risks of the product. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisations 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Valdoxan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal products containing the active substance agomelatine is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

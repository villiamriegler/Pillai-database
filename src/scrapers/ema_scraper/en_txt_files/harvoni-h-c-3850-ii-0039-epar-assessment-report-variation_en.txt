2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hepatitis C virus infection is a global health challenge; currently, an estimated 170 million individuals 
worldwide are chronically infected with HCV. The estimated prevalence of HCV infection in children is up 
to 0.4% in Europe and the US and up to 6% in resource-limited countries. Globally, there are estimated 
to be 6.6 million HCV RNA-positive individuals 15 years of age or younger. 
Recently, there has been a transformation in the treatment of HCV infection with the development of 
direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting viral proteins essential to viral replication. Recently approved 
DAA-based treatment regimens are generally well tolerated and result in high rates of sustained virologic 
response (SVR) at 12 weeks following completion of all treatment (SVR12) across most patient 
populations (> 90%). However, these newly available therapies are currently limited to the treatment of 
adults with HCV infection. 
The combination of LDV (NS5A inhibitor) and SOF (NS5B inhibitor) was first approved for commercial 
marketing in the United States (US) on 10 October 2014 and in the European Union (EU) on 17 
November 2014, for the treatment of genotype 1, 3 (EU), 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection.  
This application was submitted in support of an update to the marketing authorisation to expand the 
indication of LDV/SOF to adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years old) based on new safety, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and efficacy data from an ongoing Phase 2 study. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
This submission supports proposed updates to the approved Harvoni® (HVN; ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
[LDV/SOF]) prescribing information based on results from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical study in 
adolescent subjects (Group 1; 12 to < 18 years old) with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (Study 
GS-US-337-1116). Harvoni was first approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults in the 
United States (US) on 10 October 2014 and in the European Union (EU) on 17 November 2014. Harvoni is 
indicated for the treatment of genotype 1, 3 (EU), 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection [Gilead Sciences Inc 2016], 
[Gilead Sciences Inc 2015]. 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology program has been 
undertaken in support of the registration of LDV/SOF for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults. 
The results of these evaluations were presented in detail in the Nonclinical Overview included in the 
original LDV/SOF marketing application. Additionally, carcinogenicity data for LDV was subsequently 
submitted to the LDV/SOF marketing application. No new nonclinical data have been generated or 
deemed necessary to support approval of LDV/SOF in the adolescent population. 
According to the ICH M3 Guideline titled “Guidance on Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of 
Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals,” safety data from previous adult 
human experience represents the most relevant information to support use in paediatric subjects {ICH 
Harmonised Tripartite Guideline 2009}. Consistent with ICH M3 recommendations, to the well-defined 
Assessment report  
EMA/452304/2017 
Page 9/56 
 
  
  
and favourable safety profile of LDV/SOF in adults were carefully considered prior to the initiation of 
Study GS-US-337-1116 in adolescent subjects 12 to < 18 years of age. The findings of these nonclinical 
studies were previously submitted to the LDV/SOF marketing application. 
The agreed initial Paediatric Study Plan (iPSP; 13 December 2013) and Paediatric Investigational Plan 
(PIP; 10 October 2013) were submitted with the respective original marketing applications for LDV/SOF. 
Additionally, a paediatric Written Request (WR) was issued by FDA for LDV/SOF. 
The well-known nonclinical safety profile of LDV/SOF and safety profile observed in paediatric patients in 
(Study GS-US-337-1116) support a favourable benefit/risk profile for the proposed use of LDV/SOF for 
the treatment of chronic HCV infection in adolescent patients 12 to < 18 years of age. 
The CHMP considered that no additional non-clinical juvenile toxicity study is required to extend the use 
of LDV/SOF to adolescent patients (12 to <18 years). 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) was previously submitted for Harvoni (Ledipasvir 
[LDV]/Sofosbuvir [SOF]) as part of the EU initial marketing authorisation application (MAA). This ERA 
considered all available data relating to LDV and SOF in accordance with the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use that was adopted by the CHMP on 01 June 2006 (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), and 24 
June 2010 (Q&A EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010). 
The EMA guideline on the ERA states that “the evaluation of the environmental impact should be made if 
there is an increase in the environmental exposure, e.g. a new indication may result in a significant 
increase in the extent of the use.” The MAH provided a justification for not providing an updated ERA was 
within this application. The MAH predicts that the potential use of Harvoni in adolescent patients is not 
considered to significantly impact the predicted sales volume. 
The Phase II calculations used, predicted sales figures that took into consideration the forecasted use of 
LDV and SOF (as GS-331007) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) across the European (EEA) 
economic area. As detailed in the ERA submitted as part of the EU initial MAA, Risk Quotient (RQ) for SOF 
(as GS-331007) and LDV is less than 1 for compartments such as sewage treatment plant, surface water 
and groundwater, therefore an increase in sales for Harvoni of greater than 14 times would be needed to 
pose an unacceptable risk. The CHMP considered the existing ERA as applicable to this application. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No additional non-clinical juvenile toxicity study is required to extend the use of LDV/SOF to adolescent 
patients (12 to <18 years). 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections from a non-clinical point of view in regard to this extension of the indication in 
adolescents.  
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to a 
significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.  
Considering the above data, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics and PK modelling 
Bioanalytical Methods 
Validated bioanalytical methods for sofosbuvir, GS-331007 (validation report QPS 60-1323) and ledipasvir 
(validation report QPS 60-1433) were used. 
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Elimination Characteristics 
No new information was submitted. The CHMP considered acceptable as no difference in PK 
characteristics is expected in patients 12-18 years. 
Pharmacokinetics in Adolescent Subjects 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data was collected in GS-US-337-1116, an ongoing phase 2 open-label, 
multicohort, 2-part study designed to examine the PK, efficacy, and safety of LDV/SOF 90/400 mg FDC 
tablet (given once daily) +/- RBV (given as a divided dose twice daily) for a treatment duration of 12 or 
24 weeks in paediatric subjects aged 3 to < 18 years with chronic genotype 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection. 
The study consists of a PK lead-in and a treatment phase for each cohort. The pharmacokinetic analysis 
for adolescent patients was based on data collected from cohort 1 (12 to < 18 years). 
Plasma concentration data from all PK samples (intensive and sparse) were combined and used to 
generate PK parameters for all subjects in the study population utilizing a population PK model. Previous 
population PK models have been developed for SOF, GS-331007, and LDV after administration of 
LDV/SOF in adults. A population PK model is not currently available for GS-566500; as such, PK 
parameters for this analyte were not determined. Population PK models were developed to characterize 
the exposures of SOF, GS-331007 and LDV in adolescent HCV-infected subjects administered LDV/SOF 
90/400 mg FDC. These models considered models previously developed to describe PK in the adult 
population however; model development was performed using only data collected from the adolescent 
population. 
Sofosbuvir 
The SOF dataset included 570 plasma samples from 100 subjects. A portion of the samples (301 
samples) were below-LLOQ, thus were excluded from the analysis along with 17 measureable 
concentrations beyond 12 hours post dose. The remaining dataset included 252 measureable SOF 
concentrations from 70 subjects. 
The final SOF model used for the adolescent population was a 1-compartment model with a sequential 
first/zero order absorption model and linear elimination. No covariate effects were detected. Goodness-of-
fit plots and prediction corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPC) are displayed in Figure 1 and Figure 2, 
respectively. Moderate shrinkage was estimated for inter-individual variability on Vc/F (32.4%), and low 
shrinkage was estimated for the residual error (6.30%).

GS-331007 
The final GS-331007 PopPK model developed in adolescents, after administration of LDV/SOF 90/400 mg 
FDC, was best described by a 2-compartment model with zero-order input and first order absorption, 
linear elimination, inter-individual variability terms on CL/F, Q/F and D1 (duration of zero order input), 
IOV on Vc/F, Ka/F and D1 and an exponential error model. The covariates included in the final model 
were ethnicity and creatinine clearance on CL/F. Goodness-of-fit plots and pcVPC are displayed in Figure 
3 and Figure 4, respectively. Low shrinkage was estimated for IIV on CL/F (11.2%), and high shrinkage 
was estimated for IIV on Q/F (53.1%), D1 (58.1%) and residual error (33.0%).

The LDV dataset included 569 plasma samples from 100 subjects. No samples were below-LLOQ and all 
samples were used in the analysis for LDV. Based on the PopPK model developed in adults, a 2-
compartment model with first order absorption, first order elimination from the central compartment and 
an absorption lag time was considered as the initial base model. A zero order input (depot compartment) 
followed by first order absorption provided improved characterization of LDV absorption profile. The 
covariate analysis detected sex and weight (linear relationship) on CL/F, and weight (linear relationship) 
on Vc/F. A summary of the final parameter estimates is found in Table 3, and goodness-of-fit plots and

Model Predicted Steady-State Exposure Parameters 
Bayesian post-hoc model parameters estimated from the SOF, GS-331007, and LDV models were used to 
calculate steady-state plasma PK parameters (AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau as applicable) for SOF, GS-
331007 and LDV following administration of LDV/SOF 90/400 mg FDC for each adolescent subject in 
study GS-US-337-1116. A summary of the plasma exposures are provided in Table 4 in comparison to 
exposures observed in HCV-infected adults from the adult Harvoni Phase 2/3 Population. The revised 
models result in modest difference in overall exposure estimates in the adolescent population. Further, 
comparison of observed and model-generated exposures as presented in the pcVPC plots are similar, with 
SOF Cmax over predicted by 17% and SOF AUC under predicted by 8%, for GS-331007 and LDV, Cmax 
and AUCtau were predicted within less than 4%.

Subjects with all SOF PK samples below LLOQ were not included in the summary of SOF PK parameters. 
Evaluation of body size dependence 
Sofosbuvir 
The model derived individual SOF CL/F estimates (min, 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th and max) were 
adjusted for body weight (based on allometric scaling - CL*[BW/70]0.75) and used to generate 
associated prediction bands across 10 to 70kg body weight. Allometric scaling was used since body 
weight was not a significant covariate on CL/F in the final SOF model. Observed (intensive sampling; 
N=12) data from PK Lead-in portion of Study GS-US-337-1116 was used to calculate SOF CL/F values for 
both adolescent (12-17 yrs) and paediatric (6-11 yrs) subjects. A large overlap between model predicted 
and observed CL/F values (including low body weight individuals) is observed (Figure 7).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacodynamics of SOF is well established. This agent (a nucleotide HCV-polymerase inhibitor) 
has potent activity against all HCV-genotypes. Only one mutation of relevance for SOF resistance (S282T) 
has been found during in vitro studies. This mutation has been detected at a very low frequency in 
patients who failed a SOF-containing regimen through relapse, and in these cases the virus reverted back 
to wild type virus within short (i.e. viral fitness much hampered by this substitution). S282T has not been 
seen as a naturally occurring polymorphism. There is no cross resistance between NS5A inhibitors and 
SOF. SOF has been shown to retain its efficacy on retreatment. 
While enzymatic assays are not available as NS5A lack a known enzymatic function, LDV has been shown 
to select for mutations within the NS5A gene in the replicon system conferring a reduction in viral 
susceptibility. Furthermore, replicons with resistance mutations associated with other NS5A inhibitors are 
cross resistant to LDV. 
It was shown that LDV lacks activity against NS3/4A protease, NS3 helicase, NS5B polymerase, the HCV 
internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and a broad panel of kinases. 
The mean EC50 values for genotype 1a and 1b was 0.03 and 0.004, respectively. Since LDV is highly 
protein bound, EC50-values were around 10 times higher when adding 40% human serum to cell based 
assays. The in vitro activity to non-1 subtypes is lower and variable (see Table 5).

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The final models for prediction of SOF, GS-331007, and LDV PK parameters were the same structural and 
covariate model as identified in adults with comparable model parameter estimates. SOF, GS-331007 and 
LDV AUCtau and Cmax in adolescents were within the predefined PK equivalence boundaries of 50% to 
200% when compared with adults from Phase 2/3 studies. The upper bound of the 90% CI for LDV Ctau 
was modestly higher than 200% in adolescents (GMR [90% CI]: 184.4 [167.6, 202.8]); this difference 
was not considered clinically relevant based on established exposure-safety analysis for LDV. It is 
acknowledged that very little to no difference in drug exposure is expected in a paediatric patient 
population of ≥45 kg body weight) compared to the adult patient population.  
The use of previously developed population PK models for adult SOF, GS-331007, and LDV data, seems 
appropriate since the expectation is that the pharmacokinetics in adolescents, 12 to 18 years and with 
≥45 kg body weight, is similar to adults. In the current analysis no new covariates were found to describe 
the adolescent PK data. However, the submitted population PK report lack essential information such as 
parameter uncertainty values, shrinkage values for random effects parameters, and output files; hence a 
full assessment of the population PK analysis is not possible and the conclusion regarding similarity 
between adolescent and adult drug exposure is pending an updated report. ) 
In response to the first request for supplementary information, the Applicant provided a new population 
PK analysis where adult and adolescent data has been pooled. The population PK report was considerably 
more detailed than the reports provided at the time of the application submission. The CHMP guideline on 
reporting population PK reports has been taken into account, which was appreciated. The applicant has 
partially addressed the concerns raised and the new analysis provided did not solve the concerns. As a 
consequence the CHMP requested additional information.  
In response to the second request for supplementary information, the Applicant provided a new 
population PK analysis based on the adolescent data. The previously developed adult models were used 
as a starting point but subsequently revised to fit the adolescent data. The models were revised in terms

of absorption models and covariate relationships, and various random effects (inter-individual variability 
and inter-occasion variability) were tested but not found significant. Overall, the models fit the data 
slightly better with acceptable performance for individual predictions. Hence the models are descriptive of 
the present adolescent data, but not predictive for smaller patients. Models for SOF and GS-33007 do not 
contain any relationship to body size, which is seems adequate for the adolescents (12-17 years), 
although clearly show that a body size relationship is necessary to predict data from younger age groups. 
The MAH committed to provide refined models, including for example body size dependence to support 
dose selection in smaller children as a post-authorisation measure. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the models fit the data with acceptable performance for individual predictions. The models for 
SOF and GS-33007 do not contain any relationship to body size, which is seems adequate for the 
adolescents (12-17 years) population, however body size relationship is necessary for data prediction in 
younger age groups. Refined models to support dose selection in smaller children are required to support 
dose selection in smaller children. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Title of Study: A Phase 2, Open-Label, Multi-centre, Multi-cohort Study to Investigate the Safety and

Cirrhosis Status 
a During the enrolment period for Group 1, screening included genotypes 1, 3, and 4 according to the original protocol and amendments 1 to 3. 
The adult clinical dose of LDV/SOF 90/400 mg was chosen for evaluation in adolescent subjects (12 to < 
18 years old). The appropriateness of the adult dose for this age range was supported by the subsequent 
data from Cohort 1 of the PK lead-in phase of this study, which demonstrated that LDV, SOF, and GS-
331007 exposures were comparable between adolescent subjects in this study and adult subjects 
included in the Phase 2/3 population PK analyses. 
Subjects who participated in Cohort 1 of the PK lead-in phase continued in Group 1 (12 to < 18 years old) 
of the treatment phase with no interruption of study drug administration. Additional subjects were 
enrolled in the treatment phase after the appropriateness of the dose was confirmed. 
Subjects received the first dose of study drug at the study site at baseline/Day 1. At that time, subjects 
were provided with study drug for subsequent self-administration. The LDV/SOF tablet was administered 
once daily with or without food. Each subject was given instructions to maintain approximately the same 
daily dosing interval between study drug doses. 
Subjects were instructed that if vomiting occurred within 5 hours of dosing, an additional tablet should be 
taken. If vomiting occurred more than 5 hours after dosing, no further dose was needed.

If a dose was missed and it was within 18 hours of the normal time of administration, subjects were 
instructed to take the tablet as soon as possible and to take the next dose at the usual time. If it was 
after 18 hours then subjects were instructed to wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Subjects 
were instructed not to take a double dose. No subject in Group 1 (12 to < 18 years old) received RBV as 
part of their treatment regimen.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy

The key efficacy endpoint was SVR12, defined as HCV RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after discontinuation of the 
study drug, in the FAS. The key efficacy endpoint analysis (for SVR12) in this interim CSR was conducted 
after all subjects in Group 1 (12 to < 18 years old) completed the posttreatment Week 12 visit or 
prematurely discontinued from the study. The point estimate of the SVR12 rate and 2-sided 95% exact CI 
based on the Clopper-Pearson method were provided by treatment experience (treatment naive with or 
without cirrhosis, treatment experienced without cirrhosis) and overall. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included SVR4, SVR24, proportion of subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ by 
study visit, HCV RNA absolute values and changes from baseline through end of treatment, and 
proportion of subjects with virologic failure. 
All continuous endpoints were summarized using descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, SD, median, 
first quartile [Q1], third quartile [Q3], minimum, and maximum) by treatment experience (treatment 
naive with or without cirrhosis, treatment experienced without cirrhosis) and overall (as appropriate). All 
categorical endpoints were summarized by number and percentage of subjects who met the endpoint 
definition. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The previously established population PK model based on adult data was applied to the combined data 
from both intensive PK samples collected from subjects in Cohort 1 in the PK lead-in phase and sparse PK 
samples collected from all subjects in Group 1 in the treatment phase to characterize the PK of SOF, GS-
331007, and LDV. 
PK parameters (AUCtau, C max, and Ctau) were estimated from the SOF, GS-331007, and LDV concentration 
data using the population PK models. The population PK model-derived PK parameters for SOF, GS-
331007, and LDV were summarized and listed. 
The population PK model-derived PK parameters for SOF, GS-331007, and LDV were compared between 
the adolescent population from this study and the LDV/SOF FDC adult patient population (which includes 
population PK-derived PK exposure data from Phase 2 and 3 studies) following administration of LDV/SOF 
FDC. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) and its 90% CI were provided. I addition, PK parameters were 
summarized by statistically significant intrinsic covariates identified in the population PK models: SOF and 
GS-331007 PK parameters were summarized by quartiles of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR 
using the Schwartz formula), and LDV PK parameters were summarized by sex and quartiles of body 
mass index (BMI). 
Safety 
All enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in the Safety Analysis Set. 
Safety assessments included monitoring of AEs and concomitant medications, clinical laboratory analyses, 
Tanner pubertal stage assessments, height and weight measurements, vital signs measurements, and 
symptom-directed physical examinations. Safety data included all data collected on or after the first dose 
of any study drug up to the date of the last dose of study drug plus 30 days. Adverse events were coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), Version 18.1.

A total of 107 subjects were screened for Group 1, and 7 subjects (6.5%) failed screening. For the 4 
screen failure subjects who did not meet eligibility criteria, the 2 reasons for screen failure were α-
fetoprotein not within the acceptable range (75.0%, 3 subjects) and did not meet the inclusion criterion 
of weight of at least 45 kg for the PK lead-in phase (25.0%, 1 subject). Of the 3 screen failure subjects 
who did meet eligibility criteria, the reasons for not enrolling were outside of visit window (66.7%, 2 
subjects), and withdrawal of consent by subject or parent/guardian (33.3%, 1 subject). 
Of the 100 enrolled subjects, all 100 received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the 
Safety Analysis Set and FAS (80 treatment-naive with or without cirrhosis and 20 treatment-experienced 
without cirrhosis). 
The majority of subjects (99.0%) completed study treatment. Of the 100 enrolled and treated subjects, 1 
subject (1.0%) prematurely discontinued study treatment due to lost to follow-up. 
Conduct of the study 
Study GS-US-337-1116 was conducted under a US Investigational New Drug (IND) application and in 
accordance with recognized international scientific and ethical standards, including but not limited to the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the 
original principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. These standards are consistent with the 
European Community Directive 2001/20/EC, as well as other local legislation. 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses 
The original protocol (10 July 2014) was amended 4 times. 
Amendment 1 
The protocol was first amended on 07 October 2014 to reflect the following key changes that affected 
subjects in Group 1: 
•  Removed Russia from the list of study site countries participating in the trial 
•  Updated the futility rule to suspend enrolment if 3 or more of the first 10 subjects enrolled have 
viral breakthrough or are non-responders at or prior to Week 8 
•

Outcomes and estimation 
The key efficacy endpoint was SVR12, defined as HCV RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after discontinuation of the 
study drug, in the FAS. The key efficacy endpoint analysis (for SVR12) in this interim CSR was conducted 
after all subjects in Group 1 (12 to < 18 years old) completed the posttreatment Week 12 visit or 
prematurely discontinued from the study. 
Table 8.  GS-US-337-1116: SVR by Visit During Posttreatment Follow-Up for Group 1 (12 to < 18 Years 
Old) (Full Analysis Set) 
HCV RNA was analyzed using COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test v2.0 with limit of quantitation of 15 IU/mL. 
SVRx was sustained virologic response (HCV RNA < LLOQ) x weeks after stopping study treatment. 
A missing SVR value was imputed as a success if it was bracketed by values that were termed successes (ie, “< LLOQ TND” or “< LLOQ detected”); otherwise, 
the missing SVR value was imputed as a failure. TND = target not detected. 
The exact 95% CI for the proportion within treatment group was based on the Clopper-Pearson method. 
No subject had on-treatment virologic failure (ie, breakthrough, rebound, or nonresponse). A total of 3 of 
100 subjects (3.0%), all treatment naive, did not achieve SVR12: 
One subject completed the Week 4 visit (31 days of treatment), but has not returned for any subsequent 
study visits. The subject had HCV RNA < LLOQ at the Week 2 and Week 4 visits. 
One subject completed study treatment and the Week 12 visit, but did not return for any subsequent 
study visits and was lost to follow-up. The subject had HCV RNA < LLOQ at the Week 8 and Week 12 
visits.

One subject completed study treatment and the Week 12 visit, but has not returned for any subsequent 
study visits. The subject had HCV RNA < LLOQ at the Week 8 and Week 12 visits. 
One subject who achieved SVR and did not have HCV RNA measurements at the posttreatment Week 12 
visit was imputed to achieve SV12 based on bracketed success (achieving SVR4 and having observed 
HCV RNA values < LLOQ at the posttreatment Week 24 visit). 
Virology outcomes 
Resistance to NS5A inhibitors in genotype 1 HCV infection has been associated with amino acid variants 
at positions 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 38, 58, 92, and 93 in the NS5A protein. For the purposes of this 
report, NS5A LDV resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were defined as specific amino acid changes in 
genotype 1a or 1b that conferred > 2.5-fold reduced susceptibility to LDV. 
NS5B nucleoside inhibitor (NI) RAVs were defined as follows: S96T, N142T, L159F, E237G, S282any, 
M289L/I, L320F/I/V, and V321A/I. 
Baseline RAV analyses were performed at a 1% and a 15% threshold. Overall, for the 1% cut-off, LDV 
RAVs were detected in 8 of 97 subjects (8.2%). For the 15% cut-off, LDV RAVs were detected in 5 of 97 
subjects (5.2%).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Although the study is open-labelled and uncontrolled, it provides a good estimate of efficacy as very few 
patients are expected to spontaneously resolve their chronic HCV infection during a comparable time 
interval. Screening failures and protocol violations were few, indicating that the study data is reliable and 
applicable to real-world settings. 
Only GT1 patients were de facto included, and all but one subject were non-cirrhotic. However, the liver is 
enzymatically mature far earlier than  the age of 12 and the baseline factors such as viral load and 
fibrosis grade are generally more favourable in the paediatric population. Also, efficacy studies with 
interferon and ribavirin in the paediatric population indicates that cure rates were similar between adults 
and adolescents across genotypes (Wirth et al, Journal of Hepatology 2010).  
Therefore, it should be possible to extrapolate efficacy in children aged 12 to <18 years who are infected 
with other HCV genotypes, as well as cirrhotic patients, from adult efficacy data as long as the drug 
exposure is similar. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir is efficacious in the treatment of paediatric patients aged 12 
to <18 with chronic HCV at levels comparable to what is seen in adults, and should provide a valuable 
contribution to the pharmacological armamentarium for HCV infected adolescents. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In adults, the safety profile of the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir combination is considered favourable and well-
characterized in subjects with compensated liver disease and GFR > 60 ml/min.

Patient exposure 
In adults, the estimate of patient exposure since first marketing to the latest PSUSA Data Lock Point (09 
April 2016) is 105,243 patient-years. As of 09 April 2016, approximately 5,447 subjects have been 
exposed to SOF/LDV in clinical trials. 
In this study, the mean (SD) duration of exposure to the study regimen was 12.1 (0.81) weeks overall, 
12.0 (0.89) weeks for treatment naïve subjects, and 12.2 (0.32) weeks for treatment-experienced 
subjects. The majority of all subjects (89.0%) received study drug for 12 weeks. 
Adverse events  
The majority of subjects (71.0%) experienced at least 1 AE and all AEs were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 
(moderate) in severity. No subjects experienced Grade 3 or 4 AEs or SAEs, and no deaths were reported. 
No subject prematurely discontinued study drug due to an AE.

Chemistry 
Grade 3 chemistry laboratory abnormalities were reported for INR, creatine kinase, potassium, serum 
amylase, and total bilirubin, and 1 Grade 4 laboratory abnormality of increased AST was reported. 
A transient Grade 3 increase in INR was reported for 1 subject at Week 1, who had Grade 1 INR at 
baseline. 
A Grade 3 increase in creatine kinase was reported for 1 subject at Week 12, which was transient, 
asymptomatic, and reported by the investigator to be associated with intense exercise. This subject also 
had asymptomatic Grade 3 increased serum amylase at Weeks 2 and 4 (Grade 2 at baseline and all other 
visits). Lipase levels remained largely unchanged and were within normal limits. 
Two additional subjects experienced Grade 3 increases in serum amylase. One subject had an 
asymptomatic Grade 3 increase in amylase at Week 8, concurrent with Grade 2 increased lipase. This 
subject had Grade 1 or 2 increased amylase at baseline and all other visits prior to and after the Week 8 
visit. Lipase levels had returned to normal by posttreatment Day 82, and the abnormalities were not 
associated with any AEs. 
One subject had an asymptomatic Grade 3 increase in amylase at Week 8, with Grade 1 or 2 increased 
amylase at baseline and all other visits prior to and after the Week 8 visit. Lipase levels remained largely 
unchanged and were within normal limits. 
A Grade 3 increase in potassium was reported for 1 subject at Week 1, which was transient and isolated. 
A Grade 3 increase in total bilirubin was reported for 1 subject at Week 1. This subject had Grade 2 
increased total bilirubin at baseline and all other visits except for Week 8 (Grade 1). Direct bilirubin levels 
were within the normal range at all study visits. 
A Grade 4 increase in AST was reported for 1 subject. This subject experienced the Grade 4 elevated AST 
at the posttreatment Week 4 visit (posttreatment Day 28), which was also reported as a Grade 2 AE. The 
Grade 4 elevation was isolated, transient, and associated with the start of treatment with isotretinoin for 
acne on posttreatment Day 25. Concurrently, the subject had a Grade 2 elevation in ALT but no changes 
in bilirubin. The subject’s AST levels subsequently normalized with continued isotretinoin administration.

Additional clinical data 
No notable effects of study treatment on development or growth as assessed by changes from baseline 
through posttreatment Week 12 in Tanner pubertal stages, and by changes from baseline to 
posttreatment Week 4 in height, weight, and BMI were observed. 
No notable changes from baseline in vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or 
pulse) were observed during the study. 
No pregnancies were reported during the study for subjects enrolled in Group 1. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
In this limited paediatric dataset, there are no signs that the safety profile differs from what is previously 
known from studies of adult subjects and the post-marketing experience in adult patients. SOF/LDV was 
generally well-tolerated and very few severe or serious adverse events were observed. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile sofosbuvir/ledipasvir is favourable in paediatric patients aged 12-18 years. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

has the potential for decreases in LDV plasma 
concentrations, which may lead to reduced 
therapeutic effect of LDV/SOF. 
The SmPC (Sections 4.4 and 4.5) includes 
information of how administration of LDV/SOF 
with TDF+PK enhancer increases tenofovir 
concentrations, safety is not established, 
consider risks and benefits particularly in 
patients at increased risk for renal dysfunction, 
monitor for tenofovir-associated ADRs, and 
refer to SmPCs for Viread, Truvada, or Stribild 
for renal monitoring recommendations. 
The SmPC (Section 4.3, 4.5) includes 
information that use of rosuvastatin with 
LDV/SOF is contraindicated due to the potential 
for significant increases in rosuvastatin. 
The SmPC (Section 4.5) includes information 
that coadministration of LDV/SOF and digoxin 
should be used with caution due to the 
potential for an increase in digoxin 
concentration and that therapeutic 
concentration monitoring of digoxin is 
recommended. 
The SmPC states that the safety and efficacy of 
LDV/SOF in pediatric subjects have not been 
established and that LDV/SOF is not 
recommended for use in children and 
adolescents < 12 years of age (Sections 4.2, 
4.4, 4.8) and that the PK of LDV/SOF and GS-
331007 have not been established in children 
(Section 5.2).  
The SmPC (Sections 4.4 and 4.6) states that 
there are no or limited amount of data (less 
than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of 
LDV/SOF in pregnant women, that animal 
studies do not indicate direct or indirect 
harmful effects for reproductive toxicity or fetal 
development, and that, as a preventive 
measure, use of LDV/SOF should be avoided 
during pregnancy. 
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that there are 
no data in this population. No additional risk 
minimization measures are considered 
necessary for this population.

Development of resistance 
The SmPC (Sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2) states 
that no dose adjustment of LDV/SOF is 
required for patients with mild or moderate 
renal impairment and that the safety of 
LDV/SOF has not been assessed in patients 
with severe renal impairment eGFR < 30 
mL/min/1.73m2) or ESRD requiring 
hemodialysis.  
The SmPC (Section 4.4) states that in patients 
who fail treatment with LDV/SOF, selection of 
NS5A resistance mutations that substantially 
reduce the susceptibility to LDV is seen in the 
majority of cases. Limited data indicate that 
such NS5A mutations do not revert on long 
term follow up. The efficacy of ledipasvir as 
part of a retreatment regimen in patients with 
prior exposure and selection of resistance to a 
NS5A inhibitor has not been established. The 
need for risk minimization measures will be 
reassessed following the availability of the 
results from studies or from routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of an extension of indication to add treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adolescents 
aged 12 to < 18 years, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated in order to add 
information on posology, warnings, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics. 
2.7.1.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) is included in 
the additional monitoring list from the time of marketing authorisation.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Hepatitis C virus infection is a global health challenge; currently, an estimated 170 million individuals 
worldwide are chronically infected with HCV (WHO 2014).  
The estimated prevalence of HCV infection in children is up to 0.4% in Europe and the US and up to 6% 
in resource-limited countries (El-Shabrawi et al 2013). Globally, there are estimated to be 6.6 million HCV 
RNA-positive individuals 15 years of age or younger (El-Sayed et al 2015). 
Assessment report  
EMA/452304/2017 
Page 53/56 
 
  
  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Up to 85% of individuals infected with HCV fail to clear the virus and progress to chronic infection; over 
the ensuing 20 years, as many as 20% of patients with chronic HCV infection are estimated to develop 
complications, including cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In Europe, an 
approximately 86,000 deaths occur each year due to HCV infection (WHO 2011, Muhlberger et al 2009). 
The natural history of chronic HCV infection in children is generally similar to that in adults, although HCV 
infection in children is typically relatively mild. The primary mechanism of HCV infection in children is 
vertical transmission, with parenteral transmission secondary (Wirth et al 2011). 
Most children chronically infected with HCV are asymptomatic or have mild, nonspecific symptoms. 
Despite the overall more favourable prognosis compared to adults, approximately 4% to 6% of children 
with chronic HCV infection have evidence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and some children eventually 
require liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease as a consequence of HCV infection (Hu et al 
2010). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Paediatric treatment is controversial as the current treatment options are limited and severe side effects 
and tolerability can limit or preclude their use. Despite well-established guidelines for the treatment of 
HCV in adults, there is no universal consensus on when or if to treat chronic HCV infection in children. 
Currently approved treatments for HCV infection in adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years old) include 
regimens with IFN or Peg-IFN and weight-based RBV. Recommendations are that patients with genotype 
2 or 3 HCV infection be treated with Peg-IFN+RBV for 24 weeks and those with genotype 1 or 4 infection 
should receive Peg-IFN+RBV for 48 weeks (Wirth 2012). The concern for growth and development in this 
age group and the role that both Peg-IFN and RBV potentially play in reducing growth rates has initiated 
significant debate among paediatricians as to whether these treatments should even be considered in the 
paediatric population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study GS-US-337-1116 was designed is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of LDV/SOF±RBV in 
children and adolescents (3 to < 18 years old), and to assess the efficacy of LDV/SOF±RBV in this 
population. The open-labelled and uncontrolled design provided a good estimate of efficacy as very few 
patients are expected to spontaneously resolve chronic HCV infection. 
Efficacy studies with interferon and ribavirin in the paediatric population indicates that cure rates were 
similar between adults and adolescents across genotypes (Wirth et al, Journal of Hepatology 2010). As a 
consequence it is possible to extrapolate efficacy in children aged 12 to <18 years who are infected with 
other HCV genotypes, as well as cirrhotic patients, from adult efficacy data as long as the drug exposure 
is similar. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir is previously known to be efficacious in the treatment of 
adults chronically infected with HCV, and the data from this study gives a comparable estimate of efficacy 
also in children aged 12 to <18 years. Although only GT 1 non-cirrhotic patients were included in the 
study, it should be possible to extrapolate efficacy in paediatric patients infected with other HCV 
genotypes, as well as cirrhotic patients, from adult efficacy data as long as the drug exposure is similar.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No uncertainties of regulatory relevance have been identified. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile and tolerability of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir is favourable in adults, and there are no 
indications in this limited safety dataset that the safety profile is any different in children aged 12 to <18 
years. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The extrapolation from adults to adolescents is based on an acceptable PK bridge. The submitted popPK 
models display some deficiencies on a population level, however the prediction of individual exposures 
seems reasonable and the extrapolation from adults to adolescents is hence accepted.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir is expected to provide an important addition to the 
pharmacological armamentarium as the currently approved treatment options (pegylated interferon in 
combination with ribavirin) has a less favourable safety profile and lower efficacy. 
Unfavorable effects are generally few and in line with the safety profile in adults. No new safety signal has 
been identified. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The GS-US-337-1116 study shows that the combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir is effective in HCV 
GT 1 infected paediatric patients aged 12 to <18 years. The popPK model used to demonstrate that the 
dose is adequate also for the smaller and younger individuals is not currently acceptable. It is recognised 
that the pivotal study for this application did not show any emergent safety issues.  
The response to the major objection raised on the popPK in the second request of supplementary is 
satisfactory for the sought indication. As a consequence, efficacy and safety supported by adult data from 
clinical pivotal studies, can be extrapolated to provide a posology for paediatric patients aged 12 and 
above in all genotypes and clinical scenarios where Harvoni is currently recommended for use in adult 
patients. The use of Harvoni for 24 weeks is not anticipated to alter the safety profile, while the safety 
profile of ribavirin in children, as well as the safety of Harvoni in combination with ribavirin in adults, is 
well established. 
The CHMP recommends the MAH to provide refined pharmacokinetic models to support dose selection in 
smaller children as a post-authorisation measure. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Harvoni is positive.

The clinical efficacy and safety of JETREA for the treatment

II and PL 
of vitreomacular traction (VMT) was assessed in 3 double-
on the final CSR for study TG-MV-014 in fulfilment of 
the post-authorisation measure MEA 002. The SmPC 
updates also address PRAC recommendations in 
conclusion to PSUR 6 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010122/201510). The Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial 
changes in the annexes, to align the annexes with 
the latest QRD templates (v9.1 and 10) and to 
update the contact details of the local representative 
in Spain in the Package Leaflet. An updated RMP 
version 7b was agreed during the procedure. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
masked studies. For information on the design and main 
results of study TG-MV-014 please refer to section 5.1 of 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Over 1400 patients have been treated with the 
recommended dose of 0.125 mg of JETREA in interventional 
clinical studies. All adverse reactions were ocular. The most 
commonly reported adverse reactions were vitreous 
floaters, eye pain, photopsia and chromatopsia as well as 
conjunctival haemorrhage resulting from the injection 
procedure. The most clinically relevant adverse reactions 
included blindness transient, retinal tear, retinal 
detachment, lens subluxation and macular hole 
progression. For further information, please refer to section 
4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Ophthalmological examinations may be abnormal following 
the administration of JETREA. These include optical 
coherence tomography (OCT), ophthalmoscopy (foveal 
reflex), colour vision test (Roth 28-hue) and full-field ERG. 
This should be taken into consideration when using these 
tests for the diagnosis or monitoring of other conditions.

SmPC, Annex 
With this application, the (MAH) applied for a new 
ThromboGenics NV, submitted to the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) an application for a line 
extension for Jetrea to introduce a formulation with 
adjusted fill volume for Jetrea 0.375 mg/0.3 mL 
Annex I_2.(d) Change or addition of a new 
pharmaceutical form 
II, Labelling 
pharmaceutical form and strength, Jetrea 0.375mg/0.3ml 
and PL 
solution for injection, which no longer requires dilution prior 
to injection.  
The CHMP considered that the quality of Jetrea solution for 
injection was acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the product information.  
There was no new clinical or non-clinical data affecting the 
benefit-risk profile of Jetrea. However, there was a concern 
of possible medication errors upon introduction of the new 
formulation as the previously existing formulation 
(concentrate of solution for injection) requires dilution prior 
to injection, while the new formulation does not. Mix-ups 
between the two formulations could result in dilution errors 
and administration of inadequate doses. To mitigate this 
JETREA  
EMA/48166/2021 
Page 7/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
risk, the MAH confirmed the intention to remove existing 
stocks of the concentrate from user sites at the same time 
when the new formulating is launched. Furthermore, the 
packaging and labelling of the new formulation were 
designed in a way to clearly differentiate between the 
concentrate and the new solution for injection. In addition, 
the PRAC and the CHMP considered that a DHPC was 
needed in order to highlight the risk of inadvertent dilution 
of the new formulation prior to injection, which could lead 
to under-dosing and delivery of a sub-therapeutic dose.  
Overall, based on the measures described above, the CHMP 
was of the opinion that the benefits of Jetrea in the 
treatment of vitreomacular traction in adult patients, 
including when associated with macular hole of diameter 
less than or equal to 400 microns, continued to outweigh 
its risks and thus concluded that the benefit-risk profile 
remained favourable.

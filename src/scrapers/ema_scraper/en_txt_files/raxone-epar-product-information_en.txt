4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Raxone is indicated for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with 
Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician with experience in LHON. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 900 mg/day idebenone (300 mg, 3 times a day). 
Data regarding continuous treatment with idebenone for up to 24 months are available as part of a 
Natural History controlled open label clinical trial (see section 5.1). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No specific dose adjustment is required for the treatment of LHON in elderly patients. 
Hepatic or renal impairment 
Patients with hepatic or renal impairment have been investigated. However, no specific posology 
recommendations can be made. Caution is advised in treatment of patients with hepatic or renal 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impairment, since adverse events have resulted in temporary interruption or discontinuation of 
treatment (see section 4.4). 
In the absence of sufficient clinical data, caution should be exercised in patients with renal 
impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Raxone in LHON patients under 12 years of age have not yet been 
established. Currently available data are described in sections 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Raxone film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole with water. The tablets should not be broken 
or chewed. Raxone should be administered with food because food increases the bioavailability of 
idebenone.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Monitoring 
Patients should be regularly monitored according to local clinical practice. 
Hepatic or renal impairment 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing Raxone to patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
Adverse events have been reported in patients with hepatic impairment, which have resulted in 
temporary interruption or discontinuation of treatment. 
Chromaturia 
The metabolites of idebenone are coloured and may cause chromaturia, i.e. a reddish-brown 
discoloration of the urine. This effect is harmless, not associated with haematuria, and does not require 
any adaptation of dose or discontinuation of treatment. Caution should be exercised to ensure that the 
chromaturia does not mask changes of colour due to other reasons (e.g. renal or blood disorders).  
Lactose 
Raxone contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take Raxone. 
Sunset yellow 
Raxone contains sunset yellow (E110) which may cause allergic reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Data from in vitro studies have demonstrated that idebenone and its metabolite QS10 do not exert 
systemic inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 at 
clinically relevant concentrations of idebenone or QS10. In addition, no induction of CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 was observed. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vivo idebenone is a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4. Data from a drug-drug interaction study in 
32 healthy volunteers indicate that on the first day of oral administration of 300 mg idebenone t.i.d., 
the metabolism of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, was not modified when both medicinal products 
were administered together. After repeated administration Cmax and AUC of midazolam were increased 
by 28% and 34%, respectively, when midazolam was administered in combination with 300 mg 
idebenone t.i.d. Therefore, CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index such as 
alfentanil, astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, 
tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in 
patients receiving idebenone.  
Idebenone may inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) with possible exposure increases of, e.g., dabigatran 
etexilate, digoxin or aliskiren. These medicines should be administered with caution in patients 
receiving idebenone.  Idebenone is not a substrate for P-gp in vitro. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The safety of idebenone in pregnant women has not been established. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Idebenone should only be 
administered to pregnant women or women of child-bearing potential likely to become pregnant if it is 
considered that the benefit of the therapeutic effect outweighs any potential risk.  
Breast-feeding 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of idebenone in milk 
(for details see 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. . A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Raxone therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data concerning the effect of exposure to idebenone on human fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Raxone has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions to idebenone are mild to moderate diarrhoea (usually 
not requiring the discontinuation of the treatment), nasopharyngitis, cough and back pain.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No report of overdose has been received from the RHODOS, the LEROS and the PAROS studies. 
Doses up to 2,250 mg/day have been administered in clinical studies showing a safety profile 
consistent with that reported in section 4.8. 
There is no specific antidote for idebenone. When needed, supportive symptomatic treatment should 
be given.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psychoanaleptics, Other psychostimulants and nootropics;  
ATC code: N06BX13 
Mechanism of action 
Idebenone, a short-chain benzoquinone, is an anti-oxidant assumed to be capable of transferring 
electrons directly to complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thereby circumventing 
complex I and restoring cellular energy (ATP) generation under experimental conditions of complex I 
deficiency. Similarly, in LHON idebenone can transfer electrons directly to complex III of the electron 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transport chain, thereby bypassing complex I which is affected by all three primary mtDNA mutations 
causing LHON, and restoring cellular ATP generation. 
According to this biochemical mode of action, idebenone may re-activate viable-but-inactive retinal 
ganglion cells (RGCs) in LHON patients. Depending on the time since symptom onset and the 
proportion of RGCs already affected, idebenone can promote recovery of vision in patients who 
experience vision loss. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical safety and efficacy of idebenone in LHON have been assessed in one double-blind, 
randomised, placebo-controlled study (RHODOS). Long term efficacy and safety have been studied in 
a post-approval open-label study (LEROS). Long term safety has been studied in a non-interventional 
post-authorisation safety study (PAROS). 
In RHODOS a total of 85 LHON patients, 14-66 years of age, with any of the 3 primary mtDNA 
mutations (G11778A, G3460A or T14484C) and disease duration of not more than 5 years were 
enrolled. Patients received either 900 mg/day Raxone or placebo for a period of 24 weeks (6 months). 
Raxone was given as 3 doses of 300 mg daily, each with meals. 
The primary endpoint “best recovery of visual acuity (VA)” was defined as the result from the eye 
experiencing the most positive improvement in VA from baseline to week 24 using ETDRS charts. 
The main secondary endpoint “change in best VA” was measured as the difference between best VA 
in either the left or right eye at 24 weeks compared to baseline (Table 1).

Analysis according to Mixed Model of Repeated Measures  
One patient in the placebo group presented with ongoing spontaneous recovery of vision at baseline. Exclusion of this patient 
yielded similar results as in the ITT population; as could be expected, the difference between idebenone and placebo arm was 
slightly larger. 
*logMAR - Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution 
A pre-specified analysis in RHODOS determined the proportion of patients with an eye with baseline 
VA of ≤0.5 logMAR in whom the VA deteriorated to ≥1.0 logMAR. In this small subgroup of patients 
(n=8), 0 of 6 patients in the idebenone group deteriorated to ≥1.0 logMAR whereas 2 of 2 patients in 
the placebo group showed such a deterioration. 
In a single-visit observational follow-up study of RHODOS VA assessments from 58 patients obtained 
on average 131 weeks after discontinuation of treatment indicates that the effect of Raxone may be 
maintained.  
A post-hoc responder analysis was performed in RHODOS evaluating the proportion of patients who 
had a clinically relevant recovery of VA from baseline in at least one eye, defined as either: (i) 
improvement in VA from unable to read a single letter to able to read at least 5 letters on the ETDRS 
chart; or (ii) improvement in VA by at least 10 letters on the ETDRS chart. Results are shown in 
Table 2 including supporting data from 62 LHON patients using Raxone in an Expanded Access 
Programme (EAP) and from 94 untreated patients in a Case Record Survey (CRS).

In the EAP the number of responders increased with longer treatment duration, from 19 out of 62 
patients (30.6%) at 6 months to 17 out of 47 patients (36.2%) at 12 months.  
In LEROS; a total of 199 LHON patients were enrolled in this open – label study. Over half (112 
[56.6%]) had the G11778A mutation, whereas 34 (17.2%) had the T14484C mutation and 35 (17.7%) 
had the G3460A mutation. The mean age at Baseline (BL) was 34.2 years. Patients received 
900 mg/day Raxone for a period of 24 months. Raxone was given as 3 doses of 300 mg daily, each 
with meals. 
The primary endpoint in LEROS was the proportion of eyes that achieved a Clinically Relevant 
Benefit (CRB) (that is, in which there was either a Clinically Relevant Recovery [CRR] of VA from 
Baseline or a Clinically Relevant Stabilization [CRS]) at Month 12 in those patients that started 
treatment with Raxone ≤1 year after the onset of symptoms, compared to eyes of patients from an 
external Natural History (NH) control group. CRB was observed in 42.3% of eyes from LEROS 
patients, in contrast to 20.7% eyes from NH patients. Clinically, this represents a relevant 104% 
relative improvement compared to spontaneous CRB that may occur in the control NH eyes. The 
estimated difference between treatment and control was statistically significant (p-value 0.0020) in 
favor of Raxone presenting an Odds Ratio (OR) of 2.286 (95% confidence limits 1.352, 3.884). 
One of the secondary endpoints in LEROS was the proportion of eyes with CRB in patients treated 
with Raxone >1 year after the onset of symptoms, with CRR of VA from Baseline or CRS in which 
Baseline VA better than 1.0 logMAR was maintained at Month 12 compared to an external NH 
control group. CRB was observed in 50.3% eyes of LEROS patients and 38.6% eyes of NH patients. 
The difference between the two groups was statistically significant in favor of Raxone presenting a 
p-value of 0.0087 and OR [95% CI] of 1.925 [1.179, 3.173].  
A total of 198 patients received treatment with Raxone and were included in the Safety Population. 
The mean duration of treatment in the Safety Population was 589.17 days (range: 1 – 806 days), which 
was equivalent to a total exposure of 319.39 person-years. A total of 154 (77.8%) of the patients 
undertook treatment for >12 months. A total of 149 (75.3%) patients underwent treatment at the 
>18-month timeframe; at the >24-month timeframe, this was 106 (53.5%). A total of 154 (77.8%) 
patients reported Treatment Emergent Adverse Events. The Adverse Events (AE) reported were 
mainly of mild or moderate severity; 13 (6.6%) patients who received Raxone treatment reported 
severe AEs. Forty-nine (24.7%) patients reported AEs that were considered by the Investigator to be 
treatment-related. Twenty-seven (13,6%) patients experienced Serious Adverse Events and ten (5.1%) 
had AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. No new safety concerns have 
emerged in patients with LHON enrolled in the LEROS study.  
PAROS was a post-authorization non-interventional safety study designed to collect longitudinal 
safety and effectiveness data in routine clinical settings in patients prescribed with Raxone for the 
treatment of LHON. This study was conducted at 26 centres in 6 European countries (Austria, France, 
Germany, Greece, Italy and The Netherlands). 
In the long-term safety study PAROS, a total of 224 LHON patients with a median age of 32.2 years at 
baseline received treatments with Raxone and were included in the Safety population. Over half of the 
patients (52.2%) had the G11778A mutation; 17.9% had the T14484C mutation, 14.3% had the 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
G3460A mutation, and 12.1% had other mutations. Time in treatment of these patients is displayed in

The long-term safety profile of Raxone in the treatment of patients with LHON was evaluated when 
used under conditions of routine clinical care. 
A total of 130 patients (58.0% of the Safety population) reported 382 Treatment Emergent Adverse 
Events (TEAEs). Eleven (4.9%) patients reported severe Adverse Events (AEs). Fifty (22.3%) patients 
reported 82 TEAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be drug-related. Thirty-four (15.2%) 
patients had 39 TEAEs that led to discontinuation of Raxone treatment. Twenty-five (11.2%) patients 
experienced 31 serious TEAEs.  
There was one death in the study, in an 81-year-old male patient who died of terminal prostate 
carcinoma, which was assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to Raxone.  
No new safety concerns have been identified with long-term treatment with Raxone in patients with 
LHON when used under conditions of routine clinical care in the PAROS study. The safety profile of 
Raxone observed in PAROS was similar to that from a previous open-label study (the LEROS study). 
Paediatric population 
In clinical trials in Friedreich’s Ataxia, 32 patients between the ages of 8 and 11 years and 91 patients 
between the ages of 12 and 17 years received idebenone at ≥ 900 mg/day for up to 42 months.  
In RHODOS and the EAP in LHON, a total of 3 patients between the ages of 9 and 11 years and 27 
patients between the ages of 12 and 17 years received idebenone at 900 mg/day for up to 33 months. 
In PAROS, only nine patients under 14 years of age were included and received Raxone at 900 
mg/day.  
This medicinal product has been authorised under ‘exceptional circumstances’.  
This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information 
on this medicinal product. 
The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Food increases the bioavailability of idebenone by approximately 5-7-fold and therefore, Raxone 
should always be administered with food. The tablets should not be broken or chewed.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After oral administration of Raxone, idebenone is rapidly absorbed. On repeat dosing, maximum 
plasma concentrations of idebenone are reached on average within 1 hour (median 0.67 h range: 
0.33-2.00 h).  
Distribution 
Experimental data have shown that idebenone passes the blood-brain barrier and is distributed at 
significant concentrations in cerebral tissue. Following oral administration pharmacologically relevant 
concentrations of idebenone are detectable in the aqueous humor of the eye. 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism occurs by means of oxidative shortening of the side chain and by reduction of the quinone 
ring and conjugation to glucuronides and sulphates. Idebenone shows a high first pass metabolism 
resulting in conjugates of idebenone (glucuronides and sulphates (IDE-C)) and the Phase I metabolites 
QS10, QS6, and QS4 as well as their corresponding Phase II metabolites (glucuronides and sulphates 
(QS10+QS10-C, QS6+QS6-C, QS4+QS4-C)). The main metabolites in plasma are IDE-C and 
QS4+QS4-C.  
Elimination 
Due to the high first-pass effect, the plasma concentrations of idebenone were generally only 
measurable up to 6 hours after oral administration of 750 mg Raxone, given either as a single oral dose 
or after repeated (14 days) t.i.d dosing. The main route of elimination is metabolism, with the majority 
of dose excreted via the kidneys as metabolites. After a single or repeated oral dose of 750 mg 
Raxone, QS4+QS4-C were the most prominent idebenone-derived metabolites in urine, representing 
on average between 49.3% and 68.3% of the total administered dose. QS6+QS6 represented 6.45% to 
9.46%, whereas QS10+QS10-C and IDE+IDE-C were close to 1% or below. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
In phase I pharmacokinetic studies, proportional increases in plasma concentrations of idebenone were 
observed for doses from 150 mg to 1050 mg. Neither idebenone nor its metabolites showed time-
dependent pharmacokinetics. 
Hepatic or renal impairment 
No data are available in these populations.  
Paediatric population 
Whilst clinical trials experience in paediatrics with LHON is limited to patients of 14 years of age and 
above, pharmacokinetic data from population pharmacokinetic studies, which included paediatric 
Friedreich’s Ataxia patients of age 8 years and above, did not reveal any significant differences in the 
pharmacokinetics of idebenone. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development.

1. 
What Raxone is and what it is used for 
Raxone contains a substance called idebenone.  
Idebenone is used to treat vision impairment in adults and adolescents with an eye disease called 
Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON).  
- 
- 
This eye problem is inherited – this means it runs in families. 
It is caused by a problem with your genes (called a “genetic mutation”) that affects the ability of 
cells in the eye to produce the energy they need to work normally, so they become inactive. 
LHON can lead to loss of eyesight due to the inactivity of cells responsible for vision.  
- 
Treatment with Raxone can restore the ability of cells to produce energy and so allow inactive eye 
cells to work again. This can lead to some improvement in lost eyesight.  
2. 
What you need to know before you take Raxone  
Do not take Raxone  
- 
section 6).  
if you are allergic to idebenone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Raxone if: 
you have any blood, liver or kidney problems.  
- 
Change in urine colour  
Raxone may make your urine become reddish brown. This change in colour is harmless – it does not 
mean your treatment needs to change. However, the change in colour could mean that you have 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
problems with your kidneys or bladder.  
- 
- 
Tell your doctor if your urine changes colour.

while you are taking it.  
Children and adolescents

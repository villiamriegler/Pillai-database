2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
This application concerns an extension of indication to include the use of Opdivo in combination with 
cabozantinib in the first-line (1L) treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
The proposed posology for this new indication is either 240 mg nivolumab intravenous (IV) every 2 
weeks (Q2W) or 480 mg IV every 4 weeks (Q4W) in combination with 40 mg cabozantinib 
administered orally once daily (QD) (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Epidemiology 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents the sixth most common cancer in men and the eighth most 
common cancer in women, accounting for 3%-4% of all adult malignancies in the US (Siegel et al. CA 
A Cancer J Clin. 2019). The percentage of new cases across Europe in 2018 was 3.2%, with an 
estimated number of new cases over 136.000 and over 54.000 expected deaths (Globocan 2018). 
Well-known risk factors for RCC are cigarette smoking, obesity and hypertension (Chow et al. Nat Rev 
Urol. 2010).

Biologic features 
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, comprising 80-90% 
of all kidney tumours (2020 European Association of Urology [EAU] RCC guidelines). 
Approximately 2%-3% of all RCCs are hereditary and several autosomal dominant syndromes are 
described, each with a distinct genetic basis and phenotype, the most common one being von Hippel–
Lindau (VHL) disease (Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Many renal masses remain asymptomatic until the late disease stages. Currently, >50% of RCCs are 
detected accidentally by non-invasive imaging investigating various non-specific symptoms and other 
abdominal diseases (2020 EAU RCC guidelines; Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). In addition, 25-40% of 
the patients that are radically treated (nephrectomy) will eventually relapse. ‘Advanced’ RCC (hereafter 
simply referred to as advanced RCC) entails both locally advanced disease that is not amenable to local 
therapy, i.e. curative surgery or radiation therapy, as well as metastatic disease. Advanced RCC thus 
requires systemic treatment. All histological epithelial subtypes of RCC (clear cell, papillary, 
chromophobe) can present with sarcomatoid differentiation, which is the most aggressive form of RCC. 
A high proportion of RCC patients with sarcomatoid features presents with metastatic disease. These 
features are found in 5-8% of clear cell RCC.  
RCC with sarcomatoid features is characterised by limited therapeutic options due to its relative 
resistance to established systemic targeted therapy. Most trials report on a poor median OS of 5 to 12 
months. Studies have shown that sarcomatoid RCC express programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand 
(PD-L1) at a much higher level than non-sarcomatoid RCC, suggesting that blockade of the PD-1/PD-
L1 axis may be an attractive new therapeutic strategy (Pichler et al. Cancers (Basel). 2019). 
Management 
Current systemic treatment of advanced RCC 
Recommendations mainly relate to clear cell histology, since most of the pivotal trials have been 
conducted in this common histological subtype (Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). 
The clinical therapeutic scenario in advanced RCC changed radically in the last decade with the 
availability of targeted agents and, more recently, with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(Moscetti et al. ESMO Open. 2020). 
The choice of treatment is normally based on prognostic risk factors historically developed in the era of 
frontline vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
(UpToDate). The most commonly used prognostic model is the International Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) prognostic model (Heng et al. Lancet Oncol. 2013), that 
includes the following six adverse factors: 
-  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <80%; 
- 
- 
- 
- 
time from diagnosis to treatment <1 year; 
haemoglobin concentration less than the lower limit of normal; 
serum calcium greater than the upper limit of normal; 
neutrophil count greater than the upper limit of normal; and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 11/146 
 
 
  
 
- 
platelet count greater than the upper limit of normal. 
Patients with none (0) of these risk factors are considered good risk, those with one or two (1-2) are 
considered intermediate risk, and those with three or more (≥3) are considered poor risk. The 
estimated median overall survival (OS) for the patients in these risk groups is 43.2 months, 
22.5 months, and 7.8 months, respectively. 
The most appropriate time to start systemic therapy is not well defined. Because of the indolent course 
of some RCCs, a period of observation before starting treatment should be considered, especially in 
patients with limited tumour burden and few symptoms (Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). 
First-line systemic treatment 
The algorithm for first-line (1L) systemic treatment in ccRCC that is currently recommended by ESMO 
is presented in Figure 1 (eUpdate - ESMO RCC algorithm). Of note, all recommended medicinal 
products and combinations of medicinal products in this figure are approved by EMA, i.e. 
pembrolizumab + axitinib (Keytruda + Inlyta 1L RCC European public assessment report [EPAR]), 
sunitinib (Sutent 1L RCC EPAR), pazopanib (Votrient 1L RCC EPAR), tivozanib (Fotivda 1L RCC EPAR), 
nivolumab + ipilimumab (Opdivo + Yervoy 1L RCC EPAR), and cabozantinib (Cabometyx 1L RCC 
EPAR).

Abbreviation: ccRCC= clear cell renal cell carcinoma 
In addition, the combination of avelumab + axitinib has been approved by EMA for the 1L treatment of 
adult patients with advanced RCC (Bavencio + Inlyta 1L RCC EPAR). 
Plus, the combination of atezolizumab + bevacizumab has been tested against sunitinib in a phase 3 
study in the 1L RCC setting (Rini et al. Lancet. 2019). 
Previously EMA-approved medicinal products that are no longer recommended by ESMO for the 
treatment of RCC are not discussed here.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Opdivo (nivolumab) 
Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds to the 
programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 
receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of 
T-cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed 
by antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment, results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab 
potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-
L1 and PD-L2 ligands. 
Currently, Opdivo (nivolumab) is approved in the EU (Opdivo SmPC): 
- 
- 
- 
as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults; 
as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adults with melanoma with involvement of 
lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection; 
as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy in adults; 
-  as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced RCC after prior therapy in adults; 
- 
- 
- 
- 
in combination with ipilimumab for the 1L treatment of adult patients with 
intermediate/poor-risk advanced RCC; 
as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and treatment with 
brentuximab vedotin; 
as monotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head 
and neck (SCCHN) in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy; and 
as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma in adults after failure of prior platinum-containing therapy. 
Cabometyx (cabozantinib) 
Cabozantinib (XL184) is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 
implicated in tumour growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodelling, drug resistance, and 
metastatic progression of cancer. Cabozantinib has been evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a 
variety of kinases and was identified as an inhibitor of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) 
and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) receptors. In addition, cabozantinib inhibits other 
tyrosine kinases including the GAS6 receptor (AXL), RET, ROS1, TYRO3, MER, the stem cell factor 
receptor (KIT), TRKB, Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3), and TIE-2. 
Currently, cabozantinib as Cabometyx is approved in the EU for (Cabometyx SmPC): 
- 
the treatment of advanced RCC: 
o 
o 
in treatment-naïve adults with intermediate or poor risk; 
in adults following prior VEGF-targeted therapy; and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 13/146 
 
 
  
 
- 
the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adults who have previously been treated 
with sorafenib. 
As Cometriq, cabozantinib is approved for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (Cometriq SmPC). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
In an ongoing phase 1 study (CTEP-9681; Apolo et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020), the combinations nivo+cabo 
and nivolumab and ipilimumab with cabozantinib (nivo+ipi+cabo) are being evaluated in patients with 
previously treated advanced genitourinary cancers, including urothelial carcinoma (UC) and RCC. 
CTEP-9681 was the first clinical study evaluating the nivo+cabo combination and its results informed 
the nivo+cabo dose selection for CA2099ER (see next paragraph) the pivotal study for the current 
application. The primary objectives of CTEP-9681 were to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) 
and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of nivo+cabo and nivo+ipi+cabo in patients with 
genitourinary tumours. Patients were treated with a doublet regimen of nivo+cabo (1 mg/kg or 3 
mg/kg Q2W nivolumab in combination with 40 mg or 60 mg cabozantinib) which was found to be 
tolerable with no DLTs reported. However, a trend toward fewer treatment-related adverse events 
(AEs) and dose reductions for the lower 40 mg/day cabozantinib dose + nivolumab (1 mg/kg or 3 
mg/kg) compared to the 60 mg/day cabozantinib dose + nivolumab (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg) was 
observed. The recommended phase 2 dose from CTEP-9681 was nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W + 
cabozantinib 40 mg QD and expansion with this dose resulted in anti-tumour responses in 
genitourinary cancers, including RCC. This combination dose regimen was thus selected for study 
CA2099ER. 
CA2099ER (NCT03141177), a phase 3, randomized trial of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib in patients with 
previously untreated advanced RCC is the pivotal study for the current application, see 2.4.2. Main 
study. 
A summary highlighting the key aspects of the studies investigating nivolumab and cabozantinib in 
advanced RCC that are included or referenced in this application is provided in Table 1, see 2.3.1. 
Introduction. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH has provided a statement that the clinical trials included in this submission were performed in 
accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as defined by the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH). The clinical trials carried out outside the European Union (EU) 
meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

Environmental Risk Assessment studies under the 1 June 2006 “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). Nivolumab is not 
considered to pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Nivolumab as a protein is exempt from the need for ERA studies and is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The current submission concerns the extension of the indication for nivolumab in combination with 
cabozantinib for the treatment of subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The basis of this 
submission is study CA2099ER, a phase 3, randomized (1:1), open-label study, in which patients 
received nivolumab 240 mg Q2W in combination with 40 mg QD oral cabozantinib compared with 
sunitinib treatment. Exposure-response analyses were conducted to support cabozantinib’s contribution 
of components justification for the combination of nivolumab and cabozantinib (nivo+cabo) in study 
CA2099ER compared with previous nivolumab monotherapy studies and to provide a model-based 
bridge from nivolumab 240 mg Q2W + cabozantinib 40 mg QD (the dose and regimen evaluated in 
study CA2099ER) to 480 mg Q4W + cabozantinib 40 mg QD. Nivolumab immunogenicity data are also 
presented from study CA2099ER. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology of nivolumab and cabozantinib have been described in previously submitted 
clinical pharmacology packages and included single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters, 
drug-drug interaction potential, pharmacodynamics, QT prolongation potential, popPK analyses for the 
various tumour indications and exposure-response analyses. Nivolumab and cabozantinib 
pharmacokinetics from study CA2099ER were analysed and compared with historical pharmacokinetic 
monotherapy data. PopPK analyses were performed for both nivolumab and cabozantinib, adding data 
from the CA2099ER study into the existing popPK models for each drug with the combination effect 
added as a covariate, respectively. 
In this report the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab will be discussed with cabozantinib as covariate while 
in procedure EMEA/H/C/004163/II/0017 the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib are discussed with 
nivolumab as covariate. 
Bioanalytical methods 
The pharmacokinetic samples from subjects in study CA2099ER were analysed by the same validated 
assay as used previously. The bioanalytical methods for the assessment of (neutralizing) antibodies 
against nivolumab were also the same as presented in the previously submitted marketing application 
for nivolumab. 
Population pharmacokinetics (popPK) 
The purpose of the popPK analyses was to characterize the effect of cabozantinib on the 
pharmacokinetics of nivolumab in subjects with RCC, to determine the effect of key covariates on 
nivolumab pharmacokinetics and exposure, and to compare summary measures of nivolumab exposure 
for nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and for the proposed 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) 
posology in subjects with RCC when used with cabozantinib combination therapy. 
In study CA2099ER nivolumab pharmacokinetic samples were collected on Day 1: pre-dose, end of 
infusion (0.5 h), and prior to dosing on Weeks 7, 13, 29, 45, and every 16 weeks thereafter up to 
2 years.  
The nivolumab popPK analysis dataset included a total of 7 clinical studies, 9,263 nivolumab 
concentration values (1,407 nivo+cabo) from 1,542 subjects (315 nivo+cabo) with RCC and NSCLC 
who received nivolumab monotherapy and nivo+cabo (study CA2099ER). NSCLC data were included 
since this tumour type was the reference used in prior nivolumab popPK analyses, and it was 
previously demonstrated that subjects with NSCLC and RCC have similar nivolumab CL. The data 
included are from one Phase 1 study (CA209003 [multiple tumour types, only RCC and NSCLC 
included]), two phase 2 studies (CA209009 [RCC] and CA209010 [RCC]), and four phase 3 studies 
(CA2099ER Arm A [RCC], CA209017 [SQ-NSCLC], CA209025 [RCC], and CA209057 [NSQ-NSCLC]). 
The Arm B (nivolumab + ipilimumab + cabozantinib) from study CA2099ER was not included in this 
analysis as this arm was terminated. 
Model development consisted of re-estimating parameters of the previously developed final model 
(Zhang et al 2019, see also Procedure EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0019) excluding the effect of combination

regimen with ipilimumab and tumour type. The model was a 2-compartment, zero-order infusion 
model with time-varying total CL described using a sigmoidal Emax function with a proportional 
residual error model, random effect on CL, intercompartmental clearance (Q), VC, volume of 
distribution of peripheral compartment (VP), and EMAX and correlation of random effect between CL 
and VC. The full model was developed from the base model by incorporating additional covariates to 
assess the impact of combination with cabozantinib and tumour type (RCC versus NSCLC) on 
nivolumab CL. The following covariates were already included in the base model: for CL body weight, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), performance status, sex, race, albumin, lactate 
dehydrogenase, and tumour size, and covariates for the volume of distribution of the VC were body 
weight and sex. 
Figure 3 shows that the nivolumab CL was 17% lower in subjects receiving nivolumab with 
cabozantinib 40 mg QD compared to nivolumab monotherapy after accounting for the effects of other 
covariates with CL values of 8.95 mL/h vs 11.1 mL/h, respectively from post-hoc estimates. Nivolumab 
CL at steady state was ~7% lower for nivo+cabo compared with nivolumab monotherapy, 8.12 mL/h 
vs 8.76 mL/h, respectively from post-hoc estimates. The estimated effect of eGFR, race (Asian), PS, 
body weight, albumin, and sex on nivolumab CL were consistent with the previous analyses; the 
magnitudes of the effects on the parameters (CL and VC) were less than 20% for all other covariates 
except body weight and albumin.

Despite the lower baseline CL with cabozantinib administration, this did not result in meaningful 
differences in nivolumab exposures in patients with RCC (see Table 2), indicating cabozantinib did not 
have a clinically meaningful impact on nivolumab exposures.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Nivolumab exposure response analyses were conducted to support the administration of nivolumab 
240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W and cabozantinib 40 mg QD in subjects with previously untreated 
advanced RCC. 
Further, immunogenicity of nivolumab was assessed in study CA2099ER and this is discussed in the 
safety section (section 2.5. Clinical safety). 
Exposure-response analyses 
Nivolumab exposure-response analyses for efficacy in RCC 
PFS was selected as the response endpoint since this was the primary endpoint in study CA2099ER and 
PFS determined by investigator was used for previous nivolumab monotherapy studies. Nivolumab 
time-averaged concentration during the first dosing interval (Cavg1) was used as the exposure 
measure, due to nivolumab time-varying CL, to avoid biasing the exposure-response analysis with 
exposure measurements from later treatment cycles when treatment outcomes affect disease related 
changes in exposure. 
The exposure-response analysis of PFS included 1009 subjects with RCC from studies CA209003, 
CA209009, CA209010, CA209025, and CA2099ER including 315 subjects with mRCC treated with 
nivo+cabo in study CA2099ER and for whom estimates of nivolumab exposure (Cavg1) were available. 
A semi-parametric Cox-proportional hazards (CPH) model was used to characterize exposure-response

PFS. The model with nivolumab Cavg1 as a log-linear function had a lower BIC relative to the linear 
model of Cavg1 and this effect was included in the full model.  
Figure 4 is a graphical presentation of all the estimated effects in the full model, showing the HRs of 
PFS across the predictor ranges and the associated 95% CIs. Cabozantinib coadministration had an 
additive favourable effect on PFS compared with nivolumab single agent studies. Subjects with lower 
than the reference baseline CL (10.4 mL/h), higher than the reference BBWT (81.8 kg) or male 
subjects had up to 20% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death, while subjects with PS 
> 0 (KPS ≤ 90) had approximately 20% increased risk. In addition, cabozantinib coadministration 
interactions with the significant predictors in the full model were not significant, suggesting that the 
covariate effects were consistent across nivolumab monotherapy and nivo+cabo combination therapy. 
The 95% CI of the HR for other potential predictor/prognostic variables evaluated (age, baseline 
albumin, IMDC score, PD-L1 status, and region) included 1, indicating a lack of evidence for the effect 
of these variables on the risk of tumour progression or death.  
In addition, a sensitivity analysis of the full model evaluating line of therapy was performed. Line of 
therapy was not found to be significant and was highly correlated with cabozantinib coadministration 
given that nearly all of the first-line treated subjects were also administered cabozantinib.

The final model predictions of the probability of PFS by treatment are shown in Figure 5. In general, 
the model-predicted median (90% PI) probability of PFS was consistent with the observed KM of PFS in 
most nivolumab treatment arms across time.

cabozantinib 40 mg QD (N = 315) compared with nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg Q2W (N = 403) as 
the reference. The hazard ratio was 0.385 (90%CI 0.325-0.385) and independent of nivolumab 
exposure: hazard ratio at 5% and 95% Cave (21.5 and 42.8 ng/ml) was 0.380 and 0.390, 
respectively. 
Nivolumab exposure-response analyses for safety in RCC 
Gr2+ IMAEs were selected as the response endpoint for the exposure-response safety analysis, given 
the nature of immunotherapy, such that Gr2+ IMAEs are likely attributable to the treatment. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 22/146 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
exposure-response analysis of safety included 919 subjects with RCC from studies CA209003, 
CA209010, CA209025, and CA2099ER, including 315 subjects with mRCC treated with nivo+cabo in 
study CA2099ER and for whom estimates of nivolumab exposure (time-varying daily Cavg) were 
available from the popPK analysis. Study CA209009 is not included for safety analysis since IMAEs 
were not collected in this study. 
The relationship between nivolumab (time-varying daily Cavg) and time to first occurrence of Gr2+ 
IMAEs was described by a semi-parametric CPH model and included assessments of the modulatory 
effect of covariates on the exposure-response relationship with data from study CA2099ER Arm A and 
previous nivolumab monotherapy studies. Among the evaluated functional forms of exposure effect 
(i.e., linear, and log-linear), the model with a linear function of nivolumab time-varying daily Cavg had 
the lowest BIC value and was therefore selected for the full model for Gr2+ IMAEs. Interaction 
between exposure of nivolumab time-varying daily Cavg and cabozantinib addition were assessed; 
however, no interaction term was found to have significant impact on Gr2+ IMAEs. 
Figure 6 is a graphical presentation of all the estimated effects in the full Gr2+ IMAE model, showing 
the HRs across the predictor ranges and the associated 95% CIs. The effect of nivolumab exposure 
(daily Cavg) on the risk of Gr2+ IMAEs was not statistically significant since the 95% CI for the HR 
included 1 across nivolumab monotherapy and nivo+cabo studies. Only cabozantinib coadministration 
was identified as significant predictor of Gr2+ IMAEs in the full model. Subjects administered 
combination treatment of nivo+cabo had higher risk of Gr2+ IMAEs compared with nivolumab 
monotherapy.

observed KM of Gr2+ IMAE in most nivolumab treatment arms across time. Gr2+ IMAE occurred 
already early in treatment for the combination of nivolumab and cabozantinib.

Nivolumab exposures at 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W were predicted for subjects with RCC who 
received nivolumab and cabozantinib combination therapy (N = 315). The predicted concentration-time 
profiles were used to calculate the following 8 key summary measures of exposure: Cmin1, Cmax1, 
Cavg1, Cmind28, Cavgd28, Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cavgss. Comparison of these exposures between 
nivolumab 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W are presented in Table 3.

Percent difference in geometric mean of Nivo 480 mg Q4W relative to Nivo 240 mg Q2W. 
The geometric means of nivolumab exposure were higher with 480 mg Q4W dosing relative to 240 mg 
Q2W dosing for 5 of the 8 summary measures of exposure, namely: Cmin1, Cmax1, Cavg1, Cavgd28, 
and Cmaxss, with the greatest difference noted with Cmax1 (100% higher with 480 mg Q4W). The 
exposures were lower by approximately 20% for Cmind28 and Cminss with nivolumab 480 mg Q4W 
relative to 240 mg Q2W. As expected, there was no exposure difference in Cavgss. The geometric

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology for nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib for the treatment of subjects with 
advanced RCC has been supported by pharmacokinetic and exposure-response data. Nivolumab and 
cabozantinib pharmacokinetics from study CA2099ER were analysed and compared with historical 
pharmacokinetic and exposure-response monotherapy data of nivolumab and cabozantinib in 
treatment of RCC. In this report the pharmacokinetics and exposure-response analyses of nivolumab 
from the pivotal study CA2099ER have been discussed with cabozantinib as covariate while in 
procedure EMEA/H/C/004163/II/0017 the pharmacokinetics and exposure-response analyses of 
cabozantinib with nivolumab as covariate are discussed. Immunogenicity of nivolumab was assessed in 
study CA2099ER and this is discussed in the clinical safety section. 
Bioanalytical methods 
The same validated bioanalytical methods to analyse nivolumab or (neutralizing) antibodies against 
nivolumab have been used as evaluated in previous applications. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The nivolumab and cabozantinib pharmacokinetic assessment support lack of clinically relevant 
pharmacokinetic interaction between nivolumab and cabozantinib in study CA2099ER. Nivolumab 
popPK analysis showed that coadministration with cabozantinib 40 mg QD had a statistically significant 
impact on nivolumab baseline CL following the first dose, i.e. a lower baseline clearance of nivolumab.  
This may be partly due to different disease/health status of the patients population considering the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 27/146 
 
 
  
 
 
 
different line of treatment for nivolumab + cabozantinib vs nivolumab monotherapy. Even so, at 
steady-state nivolumab exposures were similar between nivolumab monotherapy and combination of 
nivolumab with cabozantinib and the magnitude of the difference following the first dose is considered 
not to be clinically relevant. 
Exposure-response analyses 
The exposure-efficacy (ORR, OS) relationships for nivolumab monotherapy for treatment of RCC 
(studies CA209003, CA209009, CA209010, and CA209025) have already been evaluated in procedures 
EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0005 and EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0036/G. Nivolumab clearance but not Cavg,ss 
was shown to be predictive of efficacy and a flat exposure-response over the dose range 1-10 mg/kg 
was concluded.  
In this procedure exposure-PFS relationship has been explored since PFS was primary endpoint of 
study CA2099ER. It should be noted that for PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies PFS is not always predictive for OS 
and is therefore not the preferred efficacy parameter for exposure-response analysis but PFS is in case 
of first line RCC considered an acceptable parameter (see efficacy discussion). In general, the model-
predicted median (90% PI) probability of PFS was consistent with the observed KM of PFS in most 
nivolumab monotherapy treatment arms across time (Figure 5). Since there was no significant 
interaction between cabozantinib administration and nivolumab Cavg1, a similar nivolumab flat 
exposure-efficacy correlation is expected for the combination of nivolumab + cabozantinib. The 
exposure-PFS model, however, cannot be used to elucidate the contribution of cabozantinib to the 
efficacy of the combination treatment because it is confounded by different line of therapies. The line 
of therapies were different for patients treated in study CA2099ER with the combination of nivolumab 
and cabozantinib (first-line) and patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy in studies CA209003, 
CA209009, CA209010, and CA209025 (second-line and later treatment). The respective contributions 
of cabozantinib and nivolumab to efficacy for the combination are discussed in the clinical efficacy 
section. 
Subjects administered combination treatment of nivolumab + cabozantinib had higher risk of Gr2+ 
IMAEs compared with nivolumab monotherapy, and Gr2+ IMAEs occurred already early in treatment 
(Figure 7). This is not unexpected given the overlapping safety profiles of nivolumab and cabozantinib 
e.g. hepatic events, diarrhoea, rash and hypothyroidism, which may also classify as IMAEs. The 
nivolumab exposure-Gr2+ IMAEs analyses showed that nivolumab exposure was not a significant 
predictor of Gr2+ IMAEs, the incidence of Gr2+ IMAEs and the probability across time was independent 
of the nivolumab concentrations over the dose range 0.3-10 mg/kg. 
Extrapolation to nivolumab 480 mg Q4W + cabozantinib 40 mg QD 
Besides the studied dosing in study CA2099ER of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W + cabozantinib 40 mg QD, 
the applicant also applies for a 4 weekly administration of nivolumab i.e. nivolumab 480 mg Q4W + 
cabozantinib 40 mg QD. Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W has already been approved for nivolumab 
monotherapy in second-line (and later) treatment of RCC based on the flat exposure-response efficacy 
and safety analyses for nivolumab monotherapy (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0036/G). Modelling and 
simulations demonstrated that the alterations in nivolumab pharmacokinetics between 240 mg Q2W 
and 480 Q4W i.e. higher Cmax and lower Cmin and comparable Cavg for 480 mg Q4W compared to 
240 mg Q2W (see also Table 3) did not result in an altered benefit or safety profile.  
The flat dose-responses and flat exposure-responses of nivolumab have been demonstrated in second-
line treatment of RCC and because binding of nivolumab to PD-1 receptor is independent of line of 
therapy, the flat exposure-response demonstrated in second-line treatment of RCC is also applicable to 
first-line treatment of RCC. This is further supported by the currently presented exposure-response 
analyses. There was no interaction between cabozantinib administration and nivolumab Cavg1 in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 28/146 
 
 
  
 
exposure-efficacy analysis, hence a similar nivolumab flat exposure-efficacy correlation is expected for 
the combination of nivolumab + cabozantinib. Therefore, the additional dosing option of nivolumab 480 
mg Q4W + cabozantinib 40 mg QD is considered acceptable. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics and exposure response relationships of nivolumab have been sufficiently investigated 
for the extension of the indication of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W+ cabozantinib 40 mg QD or nivolumab 
480 mg Q4W + cabozantinib 40 mg QD for 1L treatment of patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Dose selection for nivolumab combined with cabozantinib was based on an investigator-sponsored 
phase 1 trial (CTEP-9681; Apolo et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020), supported by the National Cancer Institute 
NCI/NIH evaluating the combination of cabozantinib with nivolumab (doublet) or cabozantinib with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab (triplet) in patients with previously treated advanced genitourinary cancers, 
including urothelial carcinoma (UC) and RCC. Among the primary objectives of CTEP-9681 was 
determining the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the 
nivo+cabo doublet in patients with genitourinary tumours. 
In the Part 1 dose escalation stage of CTEP-9681, 24 patients (6 per Level) were treated with the 
doublet regimen in 4 dose levels (Level 1: cabozantinib at 40 mg by mouth [PO], daily and nivolumab 
at 1 mg/kg Q2W; Level 2: cabozantinib at 40 mg PO, daily and nivolumab at 3 mg/kg Q2W; Level 3: 
cabozantinib at 60 mg PO, daily and nivolumab at 1 mg/kg Q2W; Level 4: cabozantinib at 60 mg PO, 
daily and nivolumab at 3 mg/kg Q2W) with 6 patients treated in each dose level. In the dose escalation 
stage of the study, no DLTs were reported for the doublet combination. However, a trend towards 
fewer treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and dose reductions for the lower 40 mg/day 
cabozantinib dose + nivolumab (33% cabozantinib dose reductions) compared with the 60 mg/day 
cabozantinib dose + nivolumab (75% cabozantinib dose reductions) were observed (Apolo et al. J Clin 
Oncol. 2020).  
Based on the overall tolerability, RP2D for the doublet regimen was cabozantinib 40 mg administered 
orally with nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered IV. Additionally, 25 patients were treated at the RP2D 
level in an expansion cohort and the data confirmed initial safety findings and further supported the 
RP2D safety and tolerability (Nadal et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018). Preliminary anti-tumour activities were 
also observed and reported among patients treated with cabozantinib 40 mg PO daily in combination of 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W (Apolo et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020; Nadal et al. J Clin Oncol. 2018). 
The lower 40 mg dose of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab is further supported by an 
exposure-response analysis of safety and efficacy endpoints from cabozantinib monotherapy data in 
the METEOR trial in previously treated, advanced RCC evaluating 60 mg cabozantinib vs everolimus 
(Lacy et al. Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology. 2018). Dose reductions to 40 mg and then 20 
mg were allowed and occurred in 60% of patients in the cabozantinib group. From the exposure-
response analyses, there was a higher risk for selected AEs fatigue/asthenia (Grade ≥ 3), palmar-
plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) syndrome [Grade ≥ 1], diarrhoea (Grade ≥ 3) and hypertension 
(HTN) with predicted HRs of 1.42, 1.49, 1.33, 1.36, respectively, based on the predicted steady-state 
average cabozantinib concentration for the 60 mg dose relative to a 40 mg starting dose. Given the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 29/146 
 
 
  
 
efficacy was predicted to be somewhat lower with a 40 mg monotherapy dose compared with the 60 
mg dose (higher risk of disease progression/death [HR 1.1], lower maximal median reduction in 
tumour size [-9.1% vs -11.9%] and lower ORR [15.6 % vs 19.1%]), the benefit-risk assessment was 
favourable for 60 mg cabozantinib single agent to maximize tumour response with safety management 
using dose modifications. However, the 60 mg dose, when given in combination with nivolumab, was 
expected to have combination effects of both efficacy and safety and, thereby, as a conservative 
measure, the 40 mg dose was chosen to increase tolerability, with the theory that any potential 
decreased efficacy would be supported by the effect of the combination. 
In study CA2099ER, a flat dose of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W was administered in combination with 
cabozantinib 40 mg/day (Arm A) in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC, because at the 
time of the study CA2099ER protocol initiation, only the nivolumab 240 mg Q2W dose was approved. It 
is noted that the doses of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W have been 
accepted to have a similar benefit-risk (B/R) balance for treatment of melanoma and RCC 
(EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0036/G).

See above Error! Reference source not found. 
Rationale for sunitinib dosing in Arm C 
As stated above, sunitinib was SoC at the start of study CA2099ER. The used standard dosing schedule 
of 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off is consistent with the sunitinib prescribing information 
as approved in the EU (Sutent SmPC). 
In both study arms treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed RECIST v1.1-defined progression 
was permitted if the patient had a clinical benefit and was tolerating study drug, as determined by the 
investigator (though nivolumab treatment was maximized at 2 years, see above). 
Objectives and outcomes/endpoints 
The research hypothesis of study CA2099ER was that treatment with nivolumab combined with 
cabozantinib (doublet regimen) would demonstrate an improvement in PFS per BICR compared to 
sunitinib monotherapy in patients with previously untreated mRCC. 
The objectives and endpoints of study CA2099ER are shown in Table 6.

randomization and the date of objectively documented 
progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy 
(including tumour-directed radiotherapy and tumour-directed 
surgery), whichever occurs first. For patients without document 
progression or subsequent therapy, all available response 
designations will contribute to the BOR assessment. Duration of 
response (DoR) is defined as the time between the date of first 
confirmed documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first 
documented tumour progression (per RECIST v1.1) or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who neither 
progress nor die will be censored on the date of their last 
tumour assessment. Responders who started anti-cancer 
therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored 
on the date of their last evaluable tumour assessment prior to 
the initiation of first subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Time to 
response (TTR) is defined as the time from randomization to 
the date of the first confirmed documented response (CR or

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were captured through the use of two validated self-reported 
questionnaires: the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy - Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI-19), and the EuroQoL Group’s EQ-5D-3L. Analysis of the 
FKSI-19 and EQ-5D-3L was restricted to randomized patients in Arm A and Arm C who had an 
assessment at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. 
The NCCN FKSI-19 (@ FACIT.org website; actual measure) is a 19-item scale that measures tumour 
specific HRQoL in RCC patients. The FKSI-19 uses 5 Likert-type response categories that range from 
“not at all” to “very much.” Patients are asked to circle the response category that best characterizes 
their response over the last 7 days on 19 items that include symptoms such as lack of energy, fatigue, 
appetite, coughing, shortness of breath, pain, nausea, and ability to work. The instrument yields a 
total score and three subscale scores: Disease Related Symptoms (DRS), Treatment Side Effects 
(TSE), and Functional Well Being (FWB). A higher score indicates fewer symptoms. 
The 3-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) will be used to assess treatment effects on perceived 
health status and to generate utility data for health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D-3L is a generic 
multi-attribute health-state classification system by which health is described in 5 dimensions (i.e., 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety) and depression (see EQ-5D-3L User 
Guide). Each dimension is evaluated using 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and severe 
problems. Responses to these 5 dimensions are converted into 1 of 243 unique EQ-5D health state 
descriptions, which range between no problems on all 5 dimensions [11111] to severe/extreme 
problems on all 5 dimensions [33333]. Using appropriate country-specific value weighting algorithms, 
a respondent’s self-described health state can be converted into a utility index representing the 
societal desirability of his/her own health. In addition, the EQ-5D includes a VAS allowing a respondent 
to rate his/her health on a scale 0–100, with 0 being the worst health state and 100 being the best 
health state imaginable.

Sample size 
Sample size justification for primary PFS endpoint 
The primary endpoint of PFS per BICR of Arm A vs Arm C analysis was conducted on all randomized 
patients. The PFS analysis was to occur after approximately 9-10 months minimum follow-up on all 
randomized patients by which approximately 350 events from Arm A and Arm C were observed. The 
350 PFS events were to provide at least 95% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.68 for PFS of 
Arm A vs Arm C with a type I error of 0.05 (two-sided). The HR of 0.68 corresponded to a 47% 
increase in the median PFS, assuming a median PFS of 18.2 months for Arm A and 12.4 months for 
Arm C. It was projected that an observed HR of 0.811 or less, which corresponded to a 2.89 months or 
greater improvement in median PFS (12.4 vs 15.3 months), would result in a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS for the Arm A vs Arm C comparison. 
Assuming a 25% screen failure rate, it was expected that approximately 850 patients were needed in 
order to randomize 638 patients (319 per arm) in a 1:1 ratio. This number of patients was chosen to 
achieve the 350 events in the projected time frames. To represent the normal frequency of favourable 
risk in mRCC, the favourable risk patient group was capped at approximate 25%. 
Sample size computation for secondary OS endpoint 
The secondary endpoint of OS in all randomized patients was for the comparison of Arm A vs Arm C. 
Among all randomized patients, approximately 254 events (i.e., deaths) in Arm A and Arm C was to 
provide at least 80% power to detect a HR of 0.70 for OS of Arm A and Arm C with an overall type 1 
error of 0.05 (two-sided). The HR of 0.70 corresponded to a 43% increase in the median OS, assuming 
a median OS of 47.1 months for Arm A and 33 months for Arm C. 
Two formal IAs of OS were planned for this study. 
• 
The first IA was planned at the time of final PFS and expected to observe 165 OS events (65% 
of the targeted OS events for final analysis). With 165 OS events, observed HR of 0.673 or 
less, which corresponded to a 16.0 months or greater improvement in median OS (33 vs 49 
months), would result in a statistically significant improvement in OS for the Arm A vs Arm C 
comparison. 
• 
In the event a first IA for OS was not statistically significant, the second IA was planned to 
occur after observing approximately 211 events (83% of targeted OS events needed for final 
analysis). With 211 deaths, an observed HR of 0.734 or less, which corresponded to a 12.0 
months or greater improvement in median OS (33 vs 45 months), would result in a statistically 
significant improvement in OS for the Arm A vs Arm C comparison. 
Note that, at the time of final OS analysis with 254 deaths, an observed HR of 0.774 or less, which 
corresponded to a 9.6 months or greater improvement in median OS (33 vs 42.6 months), would 
result in a statistically significant improvement in OS for the Arm A vs Arm C comparison. 
O’Brien and Fleming α spending function is used to determine the stopping boundaries at interim and 
final analyses. For the above specified number of events in Arms A and C, the respective stopping 
boundaries would be α=0.011 (two-sided), α=0.025 (two-sided), and α=0.041 (two-sided) for the first 
interim, second interim, and final analyses, respectively. 
Assuming a constant accrual rate (an average rate of 3 patients/month in the first 4 months, 
afterwards an average rate of 42 patients/month), the accrual would take approximately 19 months. 
The final PFS analysis was not to occur prior to these conditions being met: 
• 
at least 8 months minimum follow-up on all randomized patients; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 36/146 
 
 
  
 
• 
• 
at least 283 PFS events, which would provide at least 90% power to detect a HR of 0.68 for 
PFS of Arm A vs Arm C; and 
at least 149 OS events, which would provide 66% power if the target HR for OS was 0.60. 
(Note that if the analysis of first IA OS was to take place with 149 OS events, the alpha 
spending for the OS comparison would be 0.007 with a critical HR=0.643.) 
This expected PFS analysis was to occur at approximately 29 months from FPFV. 
Secondary endpoints (including both efficacy endpoints OS and ORR) were analysed at the time of the 
final analysis of PFS based on a hierarchical testing strategy: 1. the primary endpoint PFS (per 
BICR); 2. the secondary endpoint OS; 3. the secondary endpoint ORR (per BICR). In the event that the 
IA for superiority of OS is positive, final analyses were to be performed prior to achieving 254 deaths. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized between Arm A and Arm C in a 1:1 ratio and stratified at the time of 
randomization by: 
- 
- 
- 
IMDC prognostic score (0 [favourable risk] vs 1-2 [intermediate risk] vs 3-6 [poor risk]); 
Tumour PD-L1 expression (≥1% vs <1% or indeterminate); and 
region (US/Canada/Western Europe/Northern Europe vs rest of the world [ROW]). 
Tumour PD-L1 expression levels were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing by the 
central lab (classified as PD-L1 expression ≥1%, <1%, or indeterminate) prior to randomization by the 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system. Randomization was carried out via permuted blocks 
within each stratum. Randomization to IMDC favourable risk patients was capped at approximately 
25% to represent the typical frequency of favourable risk patients among mRCC. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, as study CA2099ER has an open-label study design. 
Statistical methods 
Description of analysis populations 
All analyses were performed using the treatment arm as randomized (intent to treat [ITT]), with the 
exception of dosing and safety, for which the treatment arm as received was used. All populations for 
analyses refer to patients in Arm A and Arm C. Patients randomized to Arm B prior to Revised Protocol 
01 were considered as part of the population of interest only for descriptive summary of efficacy and 
safety analyses. 
Statistical analyses 
Analyses were conducted according to the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that was developed and 
finalized before DBL (SAP v1 finalized in Jun-2019; SAP v2 finalized in Dec-2019; DBL: 30-Mar-2020), 
and described the selection of patients to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting 
for missing, unused, and spurious data. 
Efficacy analyses 
See Table 6 for the definitions of the endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 37/146 
 
 
  
 
Primary endpoint PFS (per BICR): 
The primary objective/endpoint of the study was to compare PFS per BICR using RECIST v1.1 of Arm A 
to Arm C in all randomized patients. For the primary analysis PFS per BICR were compared between 
the treatment groups via stratified log-rank test among all randomized patients at a two-sided α = 
0.05 level. The estimate of the PFS HR between treatment groups was calculated using a stratified Cox 
proportional hazards model, with treatment as the sole covariate. Ties were to be handled using the 
exact method. A two-sided 95% CI for the HR is presented. 
The primary definition of PFS was used in this analysis, i.e. PFS censored at subsequent therapy, 
including anti-cancer therapy, tumour directed radiotherapy, or tumour directed surgery. The 
censoring scheme for this primary definition of PFS is shown in Table 7. 
Table 7 Censoring scheme for primary definition of PFS 
The censoring scheme for the secondary definition of PFS (only used as a supportive analysis) is 
shown in Table 8. 
Table 8 Censoring scheme for secondary definition of PFS

The following sensitivity analyses of PFS were also conducted: 
• 
• 
• 
Investigator-assessed PFS. 
PFS using an unstratified log rank test. The HR associated with treatment was presented along 
with the associated two-sided 95% CIs. 
A stratified multivariate Cox regression model was used in order to estimate the treatment 
effect after adjustment for possible imbalances in known or potential prognostic factors. 
The influence of baseline and demographic characteristics on the treatment effect among all 
randomized patients will be explored via exploratory subgroup analyses. The median PFS based on 
KM product-limit method along with two-sided 95% CIs will be produced for amongst others the 
following subgroups: age categorization, sex, race, region, baseline IMDC prognostic score, and 
baseline PD-L1+ status based on a 1% cut-off. A forest plot of the unstratified PFS HRs (along with the 
95% CIs) will be produced for each level of the subgroups listed above. The analysis comparing 
treatment (i.e., HR) will be conducted if the number of patients in the subgroup category is more than 
10. 
Secondary endpoint OS: 
A secondary objective of the study was to compare the OS of Arm A to Arm C in all randomized 
patients. If the formal analysis of PFS was statistically significant, the formal IA of OS was to be tested, 
as per hierarchical testing procedure. 
OS was planned to be compared between the treatment groups at the first and possibly second 
interim, and the final analysis using a stratified log-rank test. The stratification factors were those used 
in the analysis of PFS. An O’Brien and Fleming α-spending function was employed to determine the 
nominal significance levels for the interim and final analysis. The stratified HR between the treatment 
groups was presented along with 100*(1- α)% CI (adjusted for interim). In addition, two-sided p-value 
was reported for the analysis of OS. 
OS was estimated using the KM techniques. A two-sided 95% CI for median OS in each treatment 
group was computed via the log-log transformation method. OS rates at fixed time points (e.g. 6 
months, depending on the minimum follow-up) were presented along with their associated 95% CIs. 
Minimum follow-up of OS for all randomized patients, defined as the time from last patient’s 
randomization date to the cut-off date for OS, was summarized in months. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for OS, for the same subgroups as used for PFS and by the same 
method, see above. 
Secondary endpoint ORR (per BICR): 
If the formal analysis of OS was statistically significant, the formal analysis of ORR would be tested, as 
per hierarchical testing procedure.  
The number and percentage of patients in each category of BOR per BICR (complete response [CR], 
partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD], or unable to determine [UTD]) 
were presented, by treatment group. Estimates of ORR, along with its exact two-sided 95% CI by 
Clopper and Pearson were presented, by treatment group. 
Similar analyses were repeated based on the investigator’s assessment of ORR. A cross tabulation of 
BICR best response vs the investigator best response was presented, by treatment group and by 
response categories. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 39/146 
 
 
  
 
DoR and TTR were also evaluated for patients who achieved confirmed PR or CR. The DoR for each 
treatment group was estimated using the KM product limit method and displayed graphically. 
Subgroup analyses were also performed for ORR. 
Exploratory endpoint HRQoL: 
The analysis of FKSI-19 and EQ-5D-3L was restricted to randomized patients in Arm A and Arm C who 
had an assessment at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. 
Planned analyses include: questionnaire completion rate; mean score and mean change from baseline 
(for both total and subscale scores) at each assessment time point; the number and percentage of 
patients endorsing each response at each assessment time point (for categorical data); figures 
summarizing the mean change from baseline (including 95% CI); and by patient listings of PRO 
responses at each assessment time point. 
Exploratory endpoint PFS2: 
The following censoring rules will be applied for PFS2: 
Results 
Participant flow 
The participant flow in study CA2099ER is shown in Figure 10. Overall, 1003 patients were enrolled 
and 701 were randomized, including 323 to the nivo+cabo arm and 328 to the sunitinib arm (and 50 
to Arm B, see below at Conduct of the study - Protocol amendments). Of these, 640 patients were 
treated in Arm A and Arm C: 320 with nivo+cabo and 320 with sunitinib. 
Of the 223/1003 enrolled patients (22.2%) who were not randomized, for 74/223 (33.2%), 116/223 
(52.0%), and 33/223 (14.8%) this was due to not meeting inclusion criteria, meeting exclusion 
criteria, or for other reasons, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 40/146 
 
 
  
 
 
The most common reasons for patients who were randomized but not treated was withdrawal of 
consent (1 for nivo+cabo, 6 for sunitinib). Of the 640 treated patients, 270 patients (42.2%) were 
ongoing in the treatment period at the time of 30-Mar-2020 DBL: 178 (55.6%) with nivo+cabo and 92 
(28.8%) with sunitinib. The percentage of patients who discontinued the treatment period were 44.4% 
and 71.3% in the nivo+cabo and sunitinib arms, respectively. The primary reason for not completing 
the treatment period was disease progression (243 patients, 38.0%): 89 (27.8%) with nivo+cabo and 
154 (48.1%) with sunitinib. Of these, 15 (4.7%) and 31 (9.7%) patients in the nivo+cabo and 
sunitinib arms, respectively, discontinued treatment due to study drug toxicity. 
Overall, 188 patients (29.4%) discontinued the study, and the most common reason for not continuing 
the study was death (146 patients [22.8%]: 62 patients [19.4%] with nivo+cabo and 84 patients 
[26.3%] with sunitinib).

(ii) to remove interim analysis for ORR resulting in revised

• 
CA2099ER Global Revised Protocol 01 (Dated 18-Dec-2017) 
Rationale for (i) to stop enrolment into Arm B: CA2099ER was revised to discontinue enrolment 
into Arm B since Study CA209214 (nivo+ipi vs sunitinib) demonstrated superior OS with nivo+ipi 
compared to sunitinib in patients with previously untreated, IMDC intermediate and poor risk mRCC 
(07-Sep-2017 BMS press release). In light of this, the CA2099ER trial design was no longer sufficient 
for the Arm B triplet regimen to demonstrate superiority over sunitinib, since the nivo+ipi combination 
within the triplet regimen had already been shown to be superior to sunitinib in CA209214. In the 
original protocol, the overall alpha for CA2099ER was 0.05 (two sided), split for each of two 
comparisons (Arm A vs Arm C, and Arm B vs Arm C) to evaluate PFS as the primary endpoint. The 
statistical plan was updated to reflect Arm B being removed in revised protocol 01, with the entire 
alpha allocated to Arm A vs Arm C comparison. The primary endpoint remained PFS (Arm A vs Arm C 
comparison). 
As of 18-Dec-2017, at the time this amendment was finalized, 15 patients had been randomized to 
CA2099ER (5, 4, and 6 patients to Arms A, B, and C, respectively). Implementation of CA2099ER 
Revised Protocol 01 (stopping enrolment to Arm B) was done at the site level when the revised 
protocol was approved at the site; thus, 50 patients had been randomized to Arm B as of the time of 
revised protocol implementation at the last site (Sep-2018). These patients previously randomized to 
Arm B continued with Arm B treatment and planned clinical evaluation, per protocol. Data collected for 
patients in Arm B were included in the submitted datasets and in the appendices of the CA2099ER 
clinical study report (CSR). However, results from Arm B are not included (or discussed) in this AR.

EMA/CHMP/159169/2021

Rationale for (ii) to include favourable risk patients (capped at 25%): given that in CA209214, 
nivo+ipi did not demonstrate a similar clinical benefit in favourable risk patients as was shown in 
intermediate and poor risk patients (Motzer et al. N Engl J Med 2018; Opdivo + Yervoy 1L RCC EPAR), 
a decision was made to broaden the 1L mRCC analysis population that may benefit from nivo+cabo in 
combination in CA2099ER to include all IMDC risk groups, including favourable risk. 
• 
CA2099ER Global Revised Protocol 02 (Dated 03-May-2019) 
Rationale for (i) to adjust the timing of the PFS and OS IAs with modified hypothesized OS HR, 
to increase the number of randomized patients: This protocol revision was based on the fact that both 
the CA209214 (nivo+ipi vs sunitinib; Motzer et al. N Engl J Med. 2018) and KEYNOTE-426 
(pembrolizumab + axitinib vs sunitinib, published Mar-2019; Rini et al. N Engl J Med. 2019) studies 
had shown clinically and statistically significant improvements in OS with immunotherapy-containing 
combinations compared with single agent sunitinib in previously untreated advanced RCC, with an OS 
HR of 0.63 (for intermediate/poor risk patients) and 0.53, respectively. To be more consistent with 
these emerging data (particularly, as KEYNOTE-426 data became available in addition to CA209214 
results), the hypothesized OS HR for CA2099ER was updated from 0.76 to a more clinically meaningful 
0.70, and the sample size was increased by 10% from 580 to 638, thereby increasing the power to 
detect a difference in OS from 75% to 80%, with less required overall clinical follow-up time. The 
statistical plan was updated to reflect a longer overall enrolment and accrual period. 
Rationale for (ii) to remove the IA for ORR resulting in revised overall alpha for PFS and OS 
endpoints: Based on results of the phase 3 studies mentioned above, the planned IA for ORR was 
removed, with the corresponding 0.001 alpha reallocated to the primary PFS analysis. 
These changes were based on emerging external data only, as Company personnel continued to be 
blinded to CA2099ER. No changes in eligibility or study procedures were made. As of 03-May-2019, at 
the time the amendment was finalized, 647 patients had been randomized to CA2099ER (321 and 326 
to Arms A and C, respectively).

# All randomized patients signed an initial informed consent form (ICF). 2 patients had clinical study 
procedures conducted prior to signing initial ICF (signed prior to randomization). 3 patients had 
incorrect ICF process: date of signatures were pre-populated, signature of illiterate patient was not 
done in accordance to site’s SOP, and PI’s signature was signed retrospectively. The remaining 56 
protocol deviations were related to delays in getting updated versions signed. 
## The deviations in the ‘Baseline procedure (PD-L1 test) not performed prior to randomization (per 
protocol)’ were mostly related to tests being performed out of window or tumour tissue did not meet 
requirements. 
### Unspecified PDs: Protocol Deviations sub-classified as unspecified were due to stratification errors 
and some missing protocol procedures. 
Relevant protocol deviations are those that are related to inclusion or exclusion criteria, study 
conduct, study management, or patient assessment that were programmable and could potentially 
affect the interpretability of study results. Relevant protocol deviations are predefined in the SAP, 
whereas significant protocol deviations were captured during monitoring. 
Overall, a single relevant protocol deviation was reported for one patient (0.3%) in the nivo+cabo arm. 
This patient had received prior anti-cancer treatment with pazopanib in the adjuvant disease setting 
(from 10-Jan-2012 to 12-Jan-2013). 
No patients were excluded from the ITT analysis. 
Baseline data 
Only three patients (0.5%) were documented to have non-clear cell components (besides the 
mandatory clear-cell component); of these, one patient (randomized to sunitinib) was documented as 
having translocation RCC and the other two (one randomized to nivo+cabo; one randomized to 
sunitinib) as having mixed histology with papillary RCC.

Prior anti-cancer treatment 
In Table 11 it is shown that 69.9% of patients had prior nephrectomy. Also, 14.0% had prior 
radiotherapy (14.2% in the nivo+cabo arm and 13.7% in the sunitinib arm). 
No prior systemic therapy for RCC was permitted with the following exception (see Study 
participants): “One prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy was allowed for completely resectable RCC 
if such therapy did not include an agent that targets VEGF or VEGF receptors and if recurrence 
occurred at least 6 months after the last dose of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy.”. Three patients 
(0.9%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 2 (0.6%) in the sunitinib arm received one prior systemic anticancer 
therapy, all of which were in the adjuvant therapy setting. These therapies were pazopanib (n=1), 
gemcitabine (n=1), interleukin-2 (n=1) and placebo (n=1) in the nivo+cabo arm, and placebo (n=1) 
and everolimus (n=1) in the sunitinib arm. It was considered a relevant protocol deviation that the one 
patient in the nivo+cabo arm received prior treatment with pazopanib (see Protocol deviations). 
Concomitant medications 
Most patients (98.1%) received concomitant medication(s) during the treatment period. However, the 
use of any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non-palliative radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents) was prohibited 
during the study per protocol and there was no use of prohibited concomitant medications (Table 10). 
For information on concomitant immune-modulating medications (IMMs) for the treatment of certain 
AEs, see the safety section. 
Subsequent anti-cancer treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 47/146 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subsequent anti-cancer therapy (radiotherapy, surgery, and/or systemic therapy) was received by 61 
patients (18.9%) in the nivo+cabo arm compared to 108 patients (32.9%) in the sunitinib arm. 
Subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy was received by 36 patients (11.1%) in the nivo+cabo arm 
and 91 patients (27.7%) in the sunitinib arm. Subsequent immunotherapy (anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 
therapy, anti-CTLA4 therapy or the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4) was received by 14 
patients (4.3%) in the nivo+cabo arm compared with 81 (24.7%) for the sunitinib arm. This included 
subsequent anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 therapy in 9 patients (2.8%) in the nivo+cabo arm compared with 67 
(20.4%) for the sunitinib arm. Subsequent antiangiogenic drugs were received by 31 patients (9.6%) 
in the nivo+cabo arm and 35 patients (10.7%) sunitinib arm. 
Numbers analysed 
Overall, 323 patients were randomized to the nivo+cabo arm and 328 to the sunitinib arm. Of these, 
320 patients in each arm received at least one dose of study medication, see also Figure 10. 
All analyses were performed using the treatment arm as randomized (ITT; i.e. 323 nivo+cabo vs 328 
sunitinib), with the exception of dosing and safety, for which the treatment arm as received was used 
(i.e. 320 vs 320). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The median follow-up (date of randomization to the last known date alive or death) was 15.70 months 
(range 0.0 – 27.8) for the nivo+cabo arm and 14.59 months (range 0.0 – 27.4) for the sunitinib arm. 
As of the 30-Mar-2020 DBL, the minimum and median follow-up for OS was approximately 10.6 and 
18.1 months, respectively. 
Primary endpoint PFS 
Primary analytical method 
Study CA2099ER met its primary endpoint at a pre-planned final analysis for PFS. 
In all randomized patients, nivo+cabo demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per 
BICR (primary definition) compared with sunitinib (Figure 11): HR = 0.51 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.64); 
stratified log-rank test p value <0.0001. Median PFS was longer with nivo+cabo compared with 
sunitinib: 16.59 (95% CI: 12.45, 24.94) vs 8.31 (95% CI: 6.97, 9.69) months, respectively (an 
increase of 8.28 months). 
At both 6 and 9 months, PFS rates were higher with nivo+cabo compared with sunitinib: 80.3% (95% 
CI: 75.4, 84.3) vs 60.1% (95% CI: 54.1, 65.5), and 68.3% (95% CI: 62.6, 73.2) vs 47.8% (95% CI: 
41.7, 53.6), respectively. 
At 30-Mar-2020 DBL, there had been 144 PFS events (44.6%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 191 PFS 
events (58.2%) in the sunitinib arm (Table 12). The number of patients censored for PFS was 179 
(55.4%) and 137 (41.8%), respectively, with “still on treatment” being the most common reason for 
censoring.

last evaluable tumour assessment prior to/on start date of subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Investigator-assessed PFS results using the primary definition were generally consistent with the 
BICR assessed results. Median PFS by primary definition was 19.38 months and 9.20 months for 
nivo+cabo and sunitinib respectively, HR = 0.46 (95%CI: 0.36, 0.57) for nivo+cabo vs sunitinib, p < 
0.0001. Concordance between BICR and investigator PFS assessments was 83.9% and 82.9% for 
nivo+cabo and sunitinib arms, respectively. 
Results for the sensitivity analyses of PFS by an unstratified analysis and by an analysis using 
stratification factors as covariates were consistent with the primary PFS analysis as well. 
Also in a multivariate analysis, the treatment effect of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib when adjusted for the 
following baseline factors: age ( <65, ≥65), gender (male, female), race, region, IMDC score (0, 1-2, 
3-6), Karnofsky performance status (100-90, <90), prior nephrectomy, LDH level (≤1.5* ULN vs 
>1.5*ULN), PD-L1 status (<1%, ≥1%), and number of organ with metastasis (1, ≥2) was consistent 
(HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.64; p <0.0001) with the primary PFS analysis. 
Secondary analytical method 
An analysis of PFS per BICR using the secondary PFS definition was consistent with the analysis for the 
primary PFS definition (Figure 12): nivo+cabo vs sunitinib: HR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.67. Median 
PFS was longer with nivo+cabo compared with sunitinib: 14.29 (95% CI: 12.29, 19.84) vs 8.31 (95% 
CI: 7.00, 9.69) months, respectively (an increase of 5.98 months).

Subgroup analysis 
In a subgroup analysis for all randomized patients (Figure 13), PFS HRs by primary definition for 
almost all subgroups favoured nivo+cabo vs sunitinib (HR <1) with the exception of patients ≥85 years 
of age and Asian patients. 
PFS benefit was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score and tumour PD-L1 expression 
status: 
•  Baseline IMDC prognostic score (CRF): 
-  0 (favourable risk): median PFS was not reached for nivo+cabo, and was 12.81 months for 
sunitinib, HR = 0.60 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.98) 
-  1-2 (intermediate risk): median PFS was 17.71 vs 8.38 months, respectively, HR = 0.54 (95% 
CI: 0.41, 0.73) 
-  3-6 (poor risk): median PFS was 12.29 vs 4.21 months, respectively, HR = 0.36 (95% CI: 
0.23, 0.58) 
• 
Tumour PD-L1 expression status (≥1%, <1%) (CRF):

Secondary endpoint OS 
Primary analytical method 
As the formal analysis of PFS was statistically significant, the formal (first planned) IA of OS was 
tested, as per hierarchical testing procedure. As this IA of OS crossed the pre-specified boundary for 
statistical significance (nominal significance level p < 0.0111), it is considered the final analysis and no 
additional analysis will be performed. 
In all randomized patients, nivo+cabo demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS 
compared with sunitinib (Figure 14): HR = 0.60 (98.89% CI: 0.40, 0.89); stratified log-rank test p 
value = 0.0010. Median OS was not reached in either treatment group. 
At both 6 and 9 months, OS rates were higher with nivo+cabo compared with sunitinib: 93.1% (95% 
CI: 89.7, 95.4) vs 86.2% (95% CI: 81.9, 89.5), and 89.9% (95% CI: 86.0, 92.8) vs 80.5% (95% CI: 
75.7, 84.4), respectively. 
At 30-Mar-2020 DBL, there had been 67 deaths (20.7%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 99 deaths (30.2%) 
in the sunitinib arm. The number of patients censored for OS was 256 (79.3%) and 229 (69.8%), 
respectively. Most patients who were censored in the nivo+cabo arm were “still on treatment” (178 
patients [55.1%]) and most censored patients in the sunitinib arm were “in follow-up” (118 patients 
[36.0%]). Of these patients “still on treatment”, there were patients who had already progressed 
(either radiographically or clinically) and these patients were thus being treated beyond progression: 
30 patients (9.3%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 16 patients (4.9%) in the sunitinib arm.

Subgroup analysis 
In a subgroup analysis for all randomized patients (Figure 15), OS HRs for most subgroups favoured 
nivo+cabo vs sunitinib (HR <1) with the exception of patients ≥75 years of age and Asian patients. 
OS benefit was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score and tumour PD-L1 expression 
status: 
•  Baseline IMDC prognostic score (CRF): 
-  0 (favourable risk): HR = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.99), median OS was not reached in both arms 
-  1-2 (intermediate risk): HR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.03), median OS was not reached in both 
arms

Secondary endpoint ORR 
Primary analytical method 
As the formal interim analysis of OS was statistically significant, the formal analysis of ORR was tested, 
as per hierarchical testing procedure. 
BICR-assessed confirmed ORR was statistically significantly higher with nivo+cabo than with sunitinib: 
55.7% (95% CI: 50.1, 61.2) vs 27.1% (95% CI: 22.4, 32.3); difference +28.6% (95% CI: 21.7, 
35.6); odds ratio = 3.52 (95% CI: 2.51, 4.95); stratified CMH test p value <0.0001 (Table 13). 
In the nivo+cabo arm compared with the sunitinib arm, a numerically higher proportion of patients had 
a best overall response (BOR) of CR (8.0% vs 4.6%) or PR (47.7% vs 22.6%), and a numerically lower 
proportion of patients had a BOR of PD (5.6% vs 13.7%) or unable to determine (UTD) (6.5% vs 
16.8%) due to various reasons including most commonly death prior to disease assessment (10 
patients [3.1%] vs 20 patients [6.1%]).

Investigator-assessed ORR was 59.4% vs 32.0% for nivo+cabo and sunitinib respectively. 
Concordance between BICR and investigator ORR assessments in the nivo+cabo arm was 80.8% for 
responders and non-responders and 69.0% for each response category vs in the sunitinib arm 80.4% 
for responders and non-responders and 65.7% for each response category.

Time to response 
The median time to response (TTR) per BICR for all confirmed responders was 2.83 (95% CI: 1.0, 
19.4) months with nivo+cabo vs 4.17 (95% CI: 1.7, 12.3) months with sunitinib. 
Subgroup analysis 
In a subgroup analysis for all randomized patients, the difference in unweighted ORRs per BICR (ORR 
difference >0%) favoured nivo+cabo vs sunitinib in all subgroups including patients of all age 
subgroups (e.g. patients ≥75 years of age: 44.8% vs 9.1%) and Asian patients (42.3% vs 28.0%). 
ORR benefit was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score and tumour PD-L1 expression

Exploratory endpoint biomarkers 
Tumour PD-L1 expression 
Across all efficacy endpoints (PFS, OS, and ORR), an efficacy benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib was 
observed regardless of tumour cell PD-L1 expression status (<1%, ≥1%), see above. 
Efficacy results with PD-L1 at 5% and 10% cut-off are consistent with the 1% cut off, see Figure 13 
and Figure 15. 
Exploratory endpoint health related quality of life (HRQoL) 
At baseline, 93.4% of patients completed the FKSI-19 in the nivo+cabo arm, while 97.2% of patients 
in the sunitinib arm had a baseline assessment. Completion rates were ≥80% in both treatment arms 
at all subsequent on-treatment assessments with sufficient data (≥10 patients), through Week 105 for 
the nivo+cabo arm and Week 97 for the sunitinib arm. Mean FKSI-19 total scores were 58.74 (SD: 
10.57) in the nivo+cabo arm and 58.39 (SD: 9.92) in the sunitinib arm at baseline. Mean changes 
from baseline were generally stable for the nivo+cabo arm, whereas patients in the sunitinib arm had a 
trend toward decreased scores (Figure 17).

Figure reports common time points for nivo+cabo and sunitinib arm (Q6W). 
At baseline, 94.1% of patients completed the EQ-5D-3L in the nivo+cabo arm, while 97.5% of the 
sunitinib patients had a baseline assessment. Completion rates were ≥80% in both treatment arms at 
all subsequent on-treatment assessments with sufficient data (≥10 patients, through Week 105 for 
nivo+cabo and Week 97 for sunitinib), with the exception of the nivo+cabo arm at Week 93 (76.6%). 
Mean baseline scores for the EQ-5D VAS were 74.23 (SD: 22.23) in the nivo+cabo arm and 75.68 
(SD: 20.92) in the sunitinib arm. Generic QoL measured by the EQ-5D VAS shows trends for 
improvement in patients treated with nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib. The mean EQ-5D 
VAS scores increased over time in the nivo+cabo arm, while in the sunitinib arm, mean EQ-5D VAS 
scores varied with a trend toward decline observed from Weeks 37-91 (Figure 18). For EQ-5D utility 
index (based on the UK value set), at baseline, the scores were 0.73 (0.29) in the sunitinib treatment 
arm and 0.77 (0.25) in the nivo+cabo arm. Patients in the nivo+cabo arm remained relatively stable, 
while patients in the sunitinib arm had a trend toward decline (Figure 19).

Exploratory endpoint PFS2 
For the definition of PFS after next line of treatment (PFS2), see Table 6. 
Median PFS2 per investigator was not reached in either treatment groups. The HR favoured the 
nivo+cabo arm over the sunitinib arm: 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.70). 
At 30-Mar-2020 DBL, there had been 74 PFS2 events (22.9%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 121 PFS2 
events (36.9%) events in the sunitinib arm.

Ancillary analyses 
Upon request, the MAH provided updated data from a 10-Sep-2020 DBL, including updated PFS and 
OS (ITT plus IMDC subgroups for both), PFS2, and subsequent anti-cancer treatment, see below. In 
addition, updated ORR and DoR analysis results were described. 
A summary of the provided updated efficacy data is presented in Table 14, side by side with the results 
from the 30-Mar-2020 DBL, for reference.

In a similar fashion (i.e. Sep-2020 DBL results side by side with Mar-2020 DBL results), Kaplan-Meier 
plots for PFS per BICR (primary definition), PFS per BICR (secondary definition), and OS are shown in 
Figure 21, Figure 22, and Figure 23. 
Also in the updated efficacy data, PFS benefit was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic 
score and tumour PD-L1 expression status. For the IMDC subgroups the original and updated PFS per 
BICR (primary definition) Kaplan-Meier plots are shown in Figure 24. For tumour PD-L1 expression 
status (≥1%, <1%) the updated results were (refer to pages 57-58 and/or Figure 13 for the 30-Mar-
2020 DBL results): 
- 
- 
PD-L1 ≥1%: median PFS was 13.08 vs 4.67 months, respectively, HR = 0.41 (95% CI: 0.27, 
0.61) 
PD-L1 <1%: median PFS was 18.23 vs 9.23 months, respectively, HR = 0.55 (95% CI: 0.43, 
0.71) 
Similarly, in the updated efficacy data OS benefit was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic 
score and tumour PD-L1 expression status as well. For the IMDC subgroups the original and updated 
OS Kaplan-Meier plots are shown in Figure 25. For tumour PD-L1 expression status (≥1%, <1%) the 
updated results were (refer to page 62 and/or Figure 15 for the Mar-2020 DBL results): 
- 
- 
PD-L1 ≥1%: HR = 0.86 (95% CI: 0.52, 1.41), median OS was not reached in both arms 
PD-L1 <1%: HR = 0.53 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.76), median OS was not reached for nivo+cabo, and 
was 29.47 months for sunitinib

Subsequent anti-cancer treatment 
At the 10-Sep-2020 DBL, subsequent anti-cancer therapy (radiotherapy, surgery, and/or systemic 
therapy) was received by 84 patients (26.0%) in the nivo+cabo arm compared to 128 patients 
(39.0%) in the sunitinib arm. 
Subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy was received by 56 patients (17.3%) in the nivo+cabo arm 
and 112 patients (34.1%) in the sunitinib arm. Subsequent immunotherapy (anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 
therapy, anti-CTLA4 therapy or the combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4) was received by 20 
patients (6.2%) in the nivo+cabo arm compared with 95 (29.0%) for the sunitinib arm. This included 
subsequent anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 therapy in 13 patients (4.0%) in the nivo+cabo arm compared with 
78 (23.8%) for the sunitinib arm. Subsequent antiangiogenic drugs were received by 44 patients 
(13.6%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 48 patients (14.6%) sunitinib arm.

Supportive studies 
To establish the contribution of the individual components nivolumab and cabozantinib to the 
nivo+cabo regimen in 1L advanced RCC, CA2099ER results were assessed relative to cabozantinib 
monotherapy data from the 1L CABOSUN trial and nivolumab monotherapy data from study CA209669 
in 1L advanced RCC, respectively. As, however, CABOSUN included only I/P-risk patients, data from 
METEOR, a phase 3 trial in 2L advanced RCC, are described to compare the efficacy of the favourable 
risk patients to those of the I/P-risk population to support the contribution of nivolumab in a favourable

risk population. Key details of the study design, primary and secondary objectives of CA2099ER, 
CABOSUN, CA209669, and METEOR are summarized in Table 1 Key aspects of studies investigating 
nivolumab and cabozantinib in advanced RCC. 
Contribution of nivolumab 
Primary assessment (CA2099ER and CABOSUN) 
The contribution of nivolumab to the nivo+cabo combination in CA2099ER is supported by comparison 
with cabozantinib monotherapy data from the CABOSUN trial (Choueiri et al. Eur J Cancer 2018; 
Cabometyx 1L RCC EPAR). Given that the same control (sunitinib) was tested in CA2099ER and 
CABOSUN, and nivolumab may be considered as ‘add-on’ to cabozantinib in intermediate/poor risk 
patients, it is possible to cross compare using both relative (i.e., hazard ratios) and absolute 
differences. The relative comparisons are important given that the absolute results in the overall 
CABOSUN population were different than most other studies of targeted therapy (i.e., TKIs) in the 
first-line setting. As CABOSUN included only I/P-risk patients, the comparison herein focuses only on 
the I/P-risk patients in study CA2099ER. 
A summary of key demographic and baseline characteristics for patients in the two studies is 
provided in Table 16. Baseline characteristics were similar, indicating comparable populations; 
however, it can be noted that the CABOSUN study included a relatively high proportion of patients with 
poor prognostic features not explicitly included in the IMDC criteria, including the presence of bone 
metastases (39% vs 22.9%). This is one of the possible explanations for the relatively short PFS in 
both groups in CABOSUN. 
The contribution of nivolumab efficacy in the nivo+cabo combination was based upon consideration of 
the totality of the data. Given the potential limitations of cross-trial comparisons, since ORR directly 
reflects drug activity by indicating tumour shrinkage, the results for the cross-trial comparison are 
provided below with ORR described first, and PFS and OS comparisons provide some context. Key 
efficacy results for CA2099ER and CABOSUN are presented in Table 17. There was a large cross-study 
difference in ORR between nivo+cabo (52.2%) and cabozantinib monotherapy (20%). The absolute 
ORR increase in CA2099ER was 29% (52.2% in the nivo+cabo arm minus 23.0% in the sunitinib arm) 
vs 11% (20% in the cabozantinib arm minus 9% in the sunitinib arm) in CABOSUN. In addition, in 
CA2099ER, the CR rate was 8.4% with nivo+cabo and 3.5% with sunitinib, compared to 0% with 
cabozantinib monotherapy and sunitinib in CABOSUN. The best overall response of PD was 6.4% with 
nivo+cabo and 16.8% with sunitinib in CA2099ER compared to 18% with cabozantinib monotherapy 
and 29% with sunitinib in CABOSUN. 
For PFS in both studies, the HRs (based here on BICR) were the same = 0.48. However, the increase 
in median PFS of 9.5 months in CA2099ER compared favourably to the 3.3 month increase in 
CABOSUN. 
Although median OS has not yet been reached in CA2099ER and the OS assessment in CABOSUN was 
not fully powered, having the same comparator (sunitinib) enables cross-study comparisons. The OS 
HR with nivo+cabo in CA2099ER was 0.56 vs 0.80 for cabozantinib monotherapy in CABOSUN. The 
upper bound of the 95% CI for nivo+cabo was 0.79, which was lower than the point estimate of the 
OS HR for cabozantinib monotherapy. In addition, the OS KM curves in CA2099ER show clear early and 
sustained separation (see Figure 14), whereas this was not the case in CABOSUN (see Choueiri et al. 
Eur J Cancer 2018).

Supportive evidence in favourable risk population (METEOR) 
It is acknowledged that the above primary assessment was limited to I/P-risk patients, as CABOSUN 
did not include favourable risk patients. To establish that the contribution of components demonstrated 
can be extrapolated to 1L favourable risk patients, additional supportive data from the METEOR study 
are provided to compare the effect of cabozantinib monotherapy in the favourable population to the 
intermediate or poor risk populations. METEOR was a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study that 
evaluated the efficacy of cabozantinib, as compared with everolimus, in patients with RCC who had 
progressed after VEGFR-targeted therapy. The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by BICR and 
secondary endpoints were OS and ORR (Choueiri et al. N Engl. J Med. 2015; Choueiri et al. Lancet 
Oncol. 2016; Cabometyx 2L RCC EPAR).

As presented in Table 18, cabozantinib monotherapy demonstrated improvement compared to 
everolimus in PFS, OS, and ORR across all IMDC risk categories. The ORR from cabozantinib 
monotherapy in METEOR was similar between the favourable risk subgroup and the intermediate and 
poor risk subgroups.

Contribution of cabozantinib 
Primary assessment (CA2099ER and CA209669) 
The contribution of cabozantinib to the nivo+cabo combination in CA2099ER is supported by 
comparison with nivolumab monotherapy data from Study CA209669 (Atkins et al. J Clin Oncol. 2020). 
Again, given the potential limitations of cross-trial comparisons, since ORR directly reflects drug 
activity by indicating tumour shrinkage, the results for the cross trial comparison are provided below 
with ORR described first, and PFS and OS comparisons to provide some context, as the study 
populations appear reasonably comparable. 
A summary of key demographic and baseline characteristics for the CA2099ER and CA209669 
(ITT population = all IMDC risk groups) is provided in Table 19 and key efficacy results are presented 
in Table 20. Baseline characteristics were similar among studies, except for the higher proportion of 
poor risk patients enrolled in CA2099ER compared with CA209669 (18.6% vs 9.8%). 
There was a large cross-study difference in ORR between nivo+cabo (55.7%) and nivolumab 
monotherapy (31.7%), with non-overlapping 95% CIs. In addition, in CA2099ER, the CR and PR rates 
were 8.0% and 47.7% with nivo+cabo compared to 5.7% and 26.0% with nivolumab monotherapy in 
CA209669, respectively. 
The median PFS of 16.59 (95% CI: 12.45, 24.94) months in CA2099ER was 2 fold longer than that of 
8.3 (95% CI: 5.5, 10.9) months in CA209669, with a difference of approximately 8 months and non-
overlapping 95% CIs, despite the higher proportion of poor risk patients in CA2099ER. Additionally, the 
PFS rate at 9 months with nivo+cabo therapy was higher than that of nivolumab monotherapy (68.3% 
vs 46.7%). 
In both CA2099ER and CA209669, given the current length of follow-up, the number of deaths relative 
to the population sizes remain relatively low and thus the OS medians have not yet been reached. It is 
in this setting, without the ability to compare HRs, that the 9-month survival rates are similar in 
CA2099ER and CA209669, at 89.9% and 87.9%, respectively. However, fewer early deaths were 
expected in the CA209669 study since there are proportionally half the number of IMDC poor risk 
patients compared to CA2099ER.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design. The randomised, open-label, sunitinib-controlled study design that was used in 
CA2099ER is considered adequate to evaluate the benefits and risks of nivo+cabo as 1L treatment in 
advanced RCC. The study was open-label which is acceptable given that the administration route and 
schedule of administration of nivo+cabo and sunitinib differ, and that the primary endpoint PFS was 
BICR-assessed and OS was a key secondary endpoint. 
Patient population. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for CA2099ER appear overall acceptable and 
it is noted that patients were enrolled regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score and tumour PD-L1 
expression status. It is, however, also noted that some medicinal-product-specific exclusion criteria did 
apply. The most important ones have been reflected in the respective SmPCs: patients with an 
autoimmune disease or any condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressive medications were excluded (nivolumab specific); and patients receiving 
concomitant treatment with anticoagulants were excluded (cabozantinib specific). Additionally, patients 
with any active brain metastases were excluded. In the absence of data, nivolumab in combination 
with cabozantinib should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the 
potential benefit/risk on an individual basis (See SmPC section 4.4). 
Only patients with RCC with a clear-cell component were eligible for CA2099ER and only few (three) 
patients were documented to also have non-clear cell components. Even if patients with only non-clear 
cell RCC were not included in the trial, they were not excluded from the sought indication, which is 
acceptable, since nivolumab has shown efficacy in non-clear cell RCC in the prospective study 
CA209374 (Vogelzang et al. Clin Genitourin Cancer. 2020; Opdivo SmPC), and cabozantinib has shown 
efficacy in non-clear cell RCC in a retrospective study (Martinez Chanzá et al. Lancet Oncol. 2019). In 
addition, the efficacy (and safety) of the nivo+cabo combination is being investigated in a prospective 
phase 2 study in patients with non-clear cell RCC (NCT03635892). 
Comparator. At the start of CA2099ER, i.e. in 2017, sunitinib was SoC for the treatment of advanced 
RCC across IMDC prognostic groups (Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2016). Therefore, this comparator is 
acceptable. 
Endpoints. PFS as primary endpoint of the pivotal study is acceptable. Prolonged PFS as such is 
considered to be of benefit to the patient, with OS reported as key secondary endpoint 
(EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). Secondly, several prior approvals in 1L RCC were based on pivotal studies 
with PFS (superiority) as primary endpoint (e.g. Sutent 1L RCC EPAR; Bavencio + Inlyta 1L RCC 
EPAR). OS and ORR as secondary endpoints are acceptable. However, the primary definition of PFS 
censors for subsequent therapy,  which is not in line with EMA recommended PFS definition 
(EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1)  Hence the secondary definition of PFS used in the study is considered 
more appropriate) (Table 8). Subsequent therapy is handled for ORR via the while-not-subsequent 
therapy, so targets the activity under the randomised treatment only, which is acceptable.  
The exploratory endpoint PFS2 could be of value, in case OS results are inconclusive or immature. 
However, it is noted that the start of third-line therapy is counted as an event as well. 
The fact that the pivotal study was open label could limit the value of the results of the exploratory 
endpoint HRQoL for the benefit-risk (B/R) assessment. 
Statistical analysis. The hierarchical hypothesis testing order was as follows: PFS - OS - ORR. The 
used stratification factors (i.e. IMDC prognostic score, tumour PD-L1 expression, and region) are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 87/146 
 
 
 
 
acceptable and were also used in other recent pivotal studies in 1L RCC (Opdivo + Yervoy 1L RCC 
EPAR; Rini et al. Lancet. 2019; Keytruda + Inlyta 1L RCC EPAR). The number of strata (3x2x2=12) is 
rather large, but can still be acceptable given the sample size (n=651). 
Other analyses as outlined in the SAP were appropriate given the type of endpoints. 
Study conduct. In a first revision of the protocol, the enrolment was stopped in Arm B (nivolumab + 
ipilimumab + cabozantinib) of CA2099ER and the study design was thus changed from three arms to 
two. Also, the type I error for the comparison of arm A (nivolumab + cabozantinib) vs arm C 
(sunitinib), was increased from 0.025 (two-sided) to 0.05 (two-sided). These changes were not pre-
planned according to e.g. an adaptive design. Although it cannot be excluded that major design 
changes in an open-label trial are informed by results of the trial, the impact of this is likely limited for 
the following reasons. This revision occurred quite early in the study. Therefore, the likelihood that 
these changes were (partly) informed by results from within the trial is small and leaving out these 
patients from the analysis would not change the results for PFS and OS. The rationale for this revision 
(i.e. nivo+ipi had demonstrated superior OS vs sunitinib in 1L I/P-risk RCC) is considered acceptable. 
Moreover, it can be understood that 50 patients had been randomized to Arm B by the time the 
revised protocol was implemented at the site level (Sep-2018; 9 months later). According to the MAH, 
the delay of inclusion in Arm B after the revised protocol was presented, was mainly due to 
dependence on the national approval process before implementation.  
In a second revision of the protocol, the timing of the PFS and OS IAs were adjusted (and the OS HR 
modified) and the IA for ORR was removed (Table 9). Compared to the original protocol one interim 
analysis for OS was added (at 83%) which suggests a more aggressive testing approach. This revision 
occurred very late in the study. The impact of this is likely limited for this trial for the following 
reasons. If the originally planned interim analysis (original protocol) was followed, the first (and only) 
interim analysis was at 65% of planned events (192 events) and in the changed protocol, the actual 
first interim analysis was conducted again on 65% of planned events (which were now 165 events). As 
the 165-events interim analysis became already statistically significant, the originally planned interim 
analysis would likely be statistically significant as well given the shape of the survival curves. 
Therefore, this design change is not considered to impact the study being positive, based on PFS and 
OS. 
Even though the number of ‘significant’ protocol deviations (275; Table 10) was large, this number was 
quite evenly distributed across both arms (149 vs 126) and, more importantly, the potential impact of 
these ‘significant’ deviations on the CA2099ER results is most likely very minor. Therefore, it is agreed 
that there was no impact of the reported protocol deviations on the interpretability of study results, i.e. 
it does not hamper the B/R assessment. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Demographics and other baseline characteristics. Regarding the randomized (ITT) patient 
population (Arm A and Arm C; n=651), there were no meaningful imbalances in patients’ demographic 
and baseline characteristics among treatment arms. The population enrolled is considered 
representative of the EU target population. The percentage of enrolled patients across IMDC prognostic 
score categories (i.e. 22.6% favourable; 57.6 intermediate; and 19.7% poor risk) is acceptable. 
At the original 30-Mar-2020 DBL, a relatively low percentage of patients had received subsequent 
systemic anti-cancer therapy (11.1% vs 27.7%), whereas considerably more patients in both arms had 
progressed (not died; 37.5% vs 46.0%). As the short duration of clinical follow-up (18.1 months) may 
be among the reasons for the majority of patients not yet having received subsequent systemic anti-
cancer therapy, the MAH provided updated data on subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy. The MAH 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 88/146 
 
 
 
 
provided data from a 10-Sep-2020 DBL, corresponding to a minimum follow-up of 16.0 months 
(instead of 10.6) and a median follow-up of 23.5 months (instead of 18.1). At this DBL, the 
percentages of patients who had received subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy had increased only 
slightly to 17.3% vs 34.1%. 
The MAH elaborated that using the number of patients that had discontinued as the denominator 
(Figure 10), 25.4% (36/142) in the nivo+cabo arm and 39.9% (91/228) in the sunitinib arm received 
subsequent systemic therapies. In addition, the MAH stated that the reason for the majority of patients 
not yet having received subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy may, in part, be the current amount 
of clinical follow-up as well as the geographic enrolment distribution (with lower rates of therapy in 
ROW vs in EU/US; data not shown). 
Primary endpoint - PFS. At the original 30-Mar-2020 DBL, reasonably mature PFS results (event rate 
nivo+cabo: 44.6%; sunitinib: 58.2%) showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS per BICR 
(primary definition) for nivo+cabo compared with sunitinib. There was a clear, early separation of the 
PFS KM curves that widened over time (Figure 11). The results of all sensitivity analyses (including e.g. 
PFS as assessed by the investigator) were consistent with the primary analytical method. This PFS 
benefit (HR = 0.51; gain in median PFS 8.28 months) could be regarded as being clinically relevant. As 
is stated above, the MAH provided updated data from a 10-Sep-2020 DBL. The updated PFS data were 
consistent with the primary data and thus confirmed the PFS benefit of nivo+cabo over sunitinib 
(Figure 21). 
In a subgroup analysis, PFS HRs for almost all subgroups favoured nivo+cabo vs sunitinib (HR <1). For 
example, PFS benefit was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score and tumour PD-L1 
expression status (Figure 13). Plus, PFS benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with tumours 
that had sarcomatoid features (11.5% of ITT), a subgroup with limited treatment options and poor 
prognosis. Only in the small subgroup of Asian patients (n=51; 7.8% of ITT) and the very small 
subgroup of patients ≥85 years of age (n=6; 0.9% of ITT) did the point estimate of the PFS HR 
(numerically) favour sunitinib (i.e. 1.29 and 1.22, respectively). The 95% CI for PFS HR was, however, 
wide for both these subgroups and, importantly, did encompass unity (‘1’). Further discussion on the 
very limited number of patients aged ≥85 (with only 1 PFS event in each arm) does not seem 
warranted. It is also considered that the subgroup of Asian patients is too small and the number of PFS 
events is too limited to draw any firm conclusions questioning the clinical benefit of nivo+cabo in this 
subgroup (see below also). Of note, in the pivotal avelumab + axitinib study there was no discordance 
of efficacy results for the subgroup of Asian patients (n=133; 15.0% of full analysis set; Bavencio + 
Inlyta 1L RCC EPAR). 
Whereas the censoring rules of the primary definition of PFS are not in accordance with the EMA 
preferred analysis (see above), the provided sensitivity analysis using the secondary definition of PFS 
is the EMA preferred analysis. Therefore, the results of this sensitivity analysis using the secondary 
definition of PFS could be regarded as the most important for regulatory decision-making.  The results 
of this sensitivity analysis were consistent with the analysis using the primary PFS definition (Figure 
12; HR = 0.54; gain in median PFS 5.98 months). Updated PFS results per BICR using the secondary 
definition were also consistent. Plus, at the 10-Sep-2020 DBL the difference between median PFS using 
the secondary vs the primary definition has decreased, aligning PFS results across definitions (Figure 
22). 
Secondary endpoint - OS. At the original 30-Mar-2020 DBL, rather immature OS results (death rate 
nivo+cabo: 20.7%; sunitinib: 30.2%; median OS not reached in either arm) did already show a 
statistically significant improvement in OS for nivo+cabo compared with sunitinib. There was a clear, 
early separation of the OS KM curves that persisted over time (Figure 14). This OS benefit (HR = 0.60) 
provides support for the primary endpoint PFS and the combination of PFS and OS benefit could 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 89/146 
 
 
 
 
certainly be regarded as being clinically relevant to patients. Also for OS, updated data from 10-Sep-
2020 DBL were provided (death rate nivo+cabo: 26.6%; sunitinib: 35.4%; median OS not reached in 
nivo+cabo arm) and these were consistent with the primary data confirming the OS benefit of 
nivo+cabo over sunitinib (Figure 23). 
In a subgroup analysis, OS HRs for almost all subgroups favoured nivo+cabo vs sunitinib (HR <1). OS 
benefit was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score and tumour PD-L1 expression 
status (Figure 15). Only in the small subgroup of Asian patients (n=51) and the small subgroup of 
patients ≥75 years of age (n=62) did the point estimate of the OS HR (numerically) favour sunitinib 
(i.e. 3.83 and 1.05, respectively). The 95% CI for OS HR was, however, wide for both these subgroups 
and, importantly, did encompass unity (‘1’). Further discussion on the only borderline unfavourable OS 
HR in patients aged ≥75 does not seem warranted considering the small size of the subgroup. It is also 
considered that the subgroup of Asian patients is too small and the number of deaths (4 vs 1, 
respectively) too few to question the clinical benefit of nivo+cabo in this subgroup, also acknowledging 
the fact that ORR results did favour nivo+cabo in this subgroup (see below). 
Secondary endpoints - ORR. At the original 30-Mar-2020 DBL, ORR per BICR was also statistically 
significantly higher with nivo+cabo than with sunitinib: 55.7% vs 27.1% (Table 13), plus in the 
nivo+cabo arm a numerically higher proportion of patients had a BOR of CR compared with the 
sunitinib arm: 8.0% vs 4.6%. The investigator-assessed ORR results were confirmatory. The median 
duration of response (DoR) also favoured nivo+cabo over sunitinib: 20.17 vs 11.47 months (Figure 
16). These ORR and DoR results provide further support for the primary endpoint PFS. 
In a subgroup analysis, ORR benefit was observed in all subgroups, e.g. regardless of baseline IMDC 
prognostic score and tumour PD-L1 expression status, and thus also in the subgroup of Asian patients 
(42.3% vs 28.0%, respectively). Though it is noted that this ORR in Asian patients in the nivo+cabo 
arm is still relatively low . 
The updated ORR and DoR results from 10-Sep-2020 DBL were consistent with the original data (Table 
14). 
An efficacy benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic 
score and tumour cell PD-L1 expression status (<1%, ≥1%). For these subgroups also, the updated 
efficacy data confirmed the original results. 
The updated data showed a benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic 
score although, the OS HR for IMDC favourable-risk patients increased slightly, i.e. from 0.84 (30-Mar-
2020 DBL) to 0.94 (10-Sep-2020 DBL) raising uncertainty on the OS benefit in this subgroup. 
However, updated OS data for this subgroup remain immature with only 15/74 vs 15/72 
deaths/patients, respectively. Furthermore, there is no apparent detrimental effect on OS in this 
subgroup, the PFS result remained clearly favourable for this subgroup (HR = 0.58 [95% CI: 0.36, 
0.93]; median PFS 24.71 vs 12.81 months) and ORR provided support (66.2% vs 44.4%, 
respectively). 
Exploratory endpoint – HRQoL. Even though PROs were captured through the use of two validated 
questionnaires (FKSI-19 and EQ-5D-3L), the HRQoL results are considered of a descriptive, 
hypothesis-generating nature only (see above). It is, nevertheless, noted that patients in the sunitinib 
arm had a trend toward decreased scores/decline, whereas the patients in the nivo+cabo arm did not. 
Exploratory endpoint – PFS2. Rather immature PFS2 results could nonetheless be regarded as 
providing some support for the primary endpoint PFS. Updated data from 10-Sep-2020 DBL were 
consistent with the primary PFS2 data (data not shown).

Proposed posology. The proposed posology, i.e. nivolumab 240 mg IV Q2W or 480 mg IV Q4W in 
combination with cabozantinib 40 mg PO QD is acceptable. Nivolumab is to be used up to 24 months in 
patients without disease progression in line with study CA2099ER, instead of indefinitely. The MAH has 
provided sufficient justification for the nivolumab posology and it is thus acceptable (refer Error! 
Reference source not found. and 2.4.1. Dose response study). For further information and 
discussion on the cabozantinib posology, see procedure EMEA/H/C/004163/II/0017. 
Contribution of individual components 
The ideal study design for two medicinal products A and B to be used in combination and a control arm 
C would be A vs B vs AB vs C (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5). However, studies powered for so many 
comparisons are often prohibitively large. Thus, if there is sufficient evidence to show efficacy for any 
of the individual components of the combination used as monotherapies, sometimes these can be 
omitted from the study design. This type of study does not include one or more monotherapy groups, 
but this should be justified based on available clinical and/or non-clinical data (Moscetti et al. ESMO 
Open. 2020). The pivotal study CA2099ER was conducted testing a new AB combination (nivo+cabo) 
against the standard of care C (sunitinib). This approach is similar to the pivotal studies of the three 
recently approved ICI combination treatments in the 1L RCC setting (Opdivo + Yervoy 1L RCC EPAR; 
Keytruda + Inlyta 1L RCC EPAR; Bavencio + Inlyta 1L RCC EPAR). 
Contribution of nivolumab. For substantiating the individual contribution of nivolumab, the MAH 
provided a cross-study comparison between CA2099ER and CABOSUN (Table 17). It is agreed that this 
indirect comparison provides sufficient evidence for the contribution of nivolumab to the nivo+cabo 
combination in 1L RCC in I/P-risk patients. The higher ORR (and/or larger increase in ORR) in 
CA2099ER vs CABOSUN is regarded as primary evidence. It can also be agreed that the consistent 
efficacy results of cabozantinib across all IMDC subgroups in the 2L METEOR study (Table 18; i.e. 
primarily ORR, with support from PFS and OS) suggest that favourable-risk patients in the 1L setting 
could have outcomes similar in magnitude to that observed for the I/P-risk populations. Despite the 
lack of cabozantinib efficacy data on favourable-risk patients in the 1L setting, it can be agreed that 
the overall evidence supports the contribution of nivolumab to the nivo+cabo combination for the 
(entire) patient population targeted by the proposed indication. 
Contribution of cabozantinib. The individual contribution of cabozantinib could be inferred from the 
fact that it is already approved for the 1L treatment of advanced RCC, albeit for I/P-risk patients only 
(Cabometyx SmPC). However, this approval is for a (recommended) dose of 60 mg cabozantinib QD, 
instead of the 40 mg QD used in CA2099ER. Thus, for substantiating the individual contribution of 
cabozantinib, the MAH provided a cross-study comparison between CA2099ER and CA209669 (Table 
20). It can be agreed that this comparison provides sufficient evidence for the contribution of 
cabozantinib to the nivo+cabo combination. Again, the higher ORR in CA2099ER vs CA20996 is 
regarded as primary evidence. 
Conclusion regarding contribution of individual components. The lack of monotherapy 
experimental arms in CA2099ER prevents a precise quantitative assessment of the contribution of each 
component of the nivo+cabo combination. Nevertheless, the additive efficacy of both individual 
components has sufficiently been shown in a qualitative sense based primarily on a substantial 
increase in ORR over the individual agents, even though based on cross-study comparisons only. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the single pivotal study CA2099ER, the nivo+cabo combination demonstrated a clinically 
relevant and statistically significant improvement in PFS per BICR (primary definition) compared 
with sunitinib treatment. This result was robust as results of all sensitivity analyses and of the analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 91/146 
 
 
 
 
of PFS according to the secondary definition in line with the EMA/CHMP guideline were consistent with 
the primary analysis. Nivo+cabo also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the 
secondary endpoints OS and ORR (per BICR) compared with sunitinib. 
An efficacy benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic 
score and tumour cell PD-L1 expression status (<1%, ≥1%). 
Updated results were confirmative but remain somewhat immature regarding OS. Thus, there remains 
some uncertainty regarding an OS benefit, particularly in the subgroup of IMDC favourable-risk 
patients. This is, however, acceptable as there is no apparent detrimental effect on OS in any 
subgroup, including the subgroup of IMDC favourable-risk patients that has clearly favourable PFS 
results with support from ORR. 
Regarding the contribution of the individual components, the additive efficacy of both individual 
components has been shown in a qualitative sense based primarily on an increase in ORR over the 
individual agents. This is considered acceptable despite the limitations of cross-study comparisons. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Summary of existing safety profiles 
The existing safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy (240mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W) has been 
established across several tumour types which includes previously treated RCC patients. In the pooled 
dataset of nivolumab 3 mg/kg as monotherapy across tumour types the most frequent adverse events 
(AEs) were fatigue (30%), rash (17%), pruritus (13%), diarrhoea (13%), and nausea (12%). 
Nivolumab is also associated with immune-related AEs. These include rash (26.4%), gastrointestinal 
AEs (13.1%) endocrine AEs, of which most within the thyroid disorder subcategory (9.6%), hepatic 
AEs (6.7%), hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (4.7%), pulmonary AEs (2.8%), and renal AEs (2.8%).  
The existing safety profile of cabozantinib (60 mg QD) is derived from patients in the treatment-naïve 
and previously treated advanced RCC and previously treated HCC setting. The most frequent AEs of 
any Grade in the RCC population included diarrhoea, hypertension, fatigue, AST increased, ALT 
increased, nausea, decreased appetite, PPES, dysgeusia, platelet count decreased, stomatitis and 
anaemia. Hypertension was observed more frequently in the treatment naïve RCC population (67%) 
compared to RCC patients following prior VEGF-targeted therapy (37%). Grade 3/4 AEs were observed 
with an incidence of 59%-68% in RCC patients. The most common serious adverse drug reactions in 
the RCC population are diarrhoea, hypertension, dehydration, hyponatraemia, nausea, decreased 
appetite, embolism, fatigue, hypomagnesaemia, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES). 
Other relevant AEs which have been observed with cabozantinib are GI perforation, GI fistula, 
thromboembolic events, haemorrhage, wound complications, osteonecrosis, reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), hypothyroidism and proteinuria. 
Clinical safety for new indication 
The safety data for this extension of indication in advanced RCC treatment-naïve patients is based on 
study CA2099ER (NCT03141177)  
No separate or integrated safety data was provided for the dose response study.

Patient exposure 
The DBL occurred on 30-Mar-2020. The subject disposition is reported in the efficacy section (see 
2.4.2. Main study - Results). Median follow-up (between randomization date and last known date alive 
or death date) was 15.70 months for the nivo+cabo arm and 14.59 months for the sunitinib arm. 
Overall, 1003 subjects were enrolled and 701 were randomized, including 323 to the nivo+cabo arm 
(Arm A), 328 to the sunitinib arm (Arm C), and 50 to the nivo+ipi+cabo arm (Arm B). Of the 651 
randomized subjects in the nivo+cabo (N = 323) and sunitinib (N = 328) arms, 640 subjects were 
treated: 320 with nivo+cabo and 320 with sunitinib. At the time of 30-Mar-2020 DBL, study treatment 
was ongoing in 55.6% of the subjects treated with nivo+cabo and 28.8% with sunitinib. The data for 
study arm B have not been provided. An end of treatment period summary is provided in Table 21. 
Table 21 End of Treatment Period Subject Status Summary 
The number of doses, cumulative dose, dose intensity and average daily dose are reported in Table 21. 
The median duration of treatment (defined as last dose date - start dose date + 1 day) of nivo+cabo 
was 14.26 months (range 0.2-27.3 months; 13.31 months for nivolumab, 13.78 months for 
cabozantinib), and 9.23 months for sunitinib (range 0.8-27.6 months). In total 60.3% of the patients 
had a treatment duration of >12 months in the nivo+cabo arm (nivolumab 53.8% and cabozantinib 
56.9%) and in the sunitinib arm this percentage was 40.3%. Excluding dose holds the median duration 
of therapy was 12.62 (range 0.2 - 26.9) months for cabozantinib and 6.05 (0.8 - 17.3) months for 
sunitinib. 
The median exposure time (range) using 30 days safety window was 14.31 (0.7, 27.3) months in the 
nivo+cabo arm and 9.76 (0.7, 27.3) months in the sunitinib arm. The median exposure time (range) 
using the 100 days safety window was 14.72 (0.7, 27.7) months in the nivo+cabo arm and 
11.09 (0.7, 27.3) months in the sunitinib arm.

Dose delays for the management of AEs during nivolumab, cabozantinib, or sunitinib treatment were 
allowed. Dosing of nivolumab could be delayed without delay of cabozantinib dosing if toxicity was to 
be related to only nivolumab, and vice versa. A dose was considered as actually delayed if the delay 
exceeded 3 days for nivolumab. For cabozantinib, daily dose of 0 mg entered with CRF reason 
"Adverse Event" was considered as a delay if cabozantinib was given daily. For sunitinib, a dose was 
considered delayed if subjects had 0 mg with a CRF reason "Adverse Event". 
•  Nivo+cabo arm: in total 71.9% of patients had delays for nivolumab only (50.4% of the 
nivolumab only delays were due to AEs for nivolumab), 68.1% for cabozantinib only delays, 
83.4% for either nivolumab or cabozantinib (all dose delays for cabozantinib and sunitinib were 
due to AEs by definition). 
•  Sunitinib arm: in addition to the planned 2 weeks off treatment, 51.9% of patients had dose 
delays. 
A summary of dose delays is provided in Table 23.

 Dose Delay Summary - All Treated Patients 
Dose reductions were not permitted with nivolumab treatment, but they were permitted with 
cabozantinib and sunitinib. Dose reductions (patients with at least 1 dose reduction) were reported as 
follows: 
•  Nivo+cabo arm: 56.3% of patients had dose reductions for cabozantinib 
•  Sunitinib arm: 51.6% of patients had dose reductions for sunitinib 
The most common reason for dose reduction for cabozantinib and sunitinib was also AEs. 
Dose reductions are summarized in Table 24 and Table 25.

An exposure-adjusted unique AE summary was provided by the Applicant as supplementary 
information. In general, this resulted in relative increases in the number of events in the sunitinib arm. 
When incidence rates were exposure-adjusted, all-causality AE incidence rates (events per 100 person-
years) were 1705.2 in the nivo+cabo treatment arm and 1852.6 in the sunitinib arm. 
The following was noted when comparing exposure-adjusted event data with non-exposure adjusted 
event data: 
•  AEs of diarrhoea, AST/ALT increased and hepatotoxicity, and rash remain more frequent in the 
nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm in the exposure-adjusted event data also. 
• 
In the exposure-adjusted data, relatively more events in Investigations, General disorders and 
administration site conditions (mainly due to fatigue), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(mainly due to a relative increase in PPE and rash), Nervous system disorders and Vascular 
disorders were counted in the sunitinib arm compared to the nivo+cabo arm, while the rate of 
events was comparable across the two study arms or higher in the nivo+cabo arm in the non-
exposure adjusted event data. 
Selection of specific adverse reactions from study CA2099ER to be presented in the proposed SmPC 
(Sections 4.4 and 4.8) for nivo+cabo was based on clinical relevance as determined by the Sponsor’s 
medical reviewer. PTs considered to be related to either nivolumab or cabozantinib monotherapy as 
shown in the respective SmPCs, and found to be related events (or not assessed) by the investigator 
for the combination of nivo+cabo, were selected for inclusion into the tabulated list for nivo+cabo in 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC. Certain terms were excluded from the list of related events. These were 
events which were overly general/non-specific, events where the sponsor’s medical reviewer did not 
suspect causal relationship to cabozantinib or nivolumab, and events which were captured under a 
different term. 
In addition, laboratory values worsening from baseline for PTs in which laboratory testing was 
performed routinely in CA2099ER per protocol were considered for inclusion. 
Updated safety data 10-Sept-2020 DBL 
The median duration (defined as last dose date - start dose date + 1 day) of nivo+cabo was 
17.99 months (16.13 months for nivolumab; 17.30 months for cabozantinib), and 9.15 months for 
sunitinib at the 10-Sep-2020 DBL. Study treatment was ongoing in 45.0% of subjects treated with 
nivo+cabo and 22.2% with sunitinib. The median number of doses received during the treatment 
period was as follows nivo+cabo arm: 34.0 doses nivolumab, 417.5 doses cabozantinib, sunitinib arm: 
166.0 doses sunitinib. 
Dose delays of study drug (proportion of subjects with ≥1 dose delay) were as follows, as reported on 
the exposure page of the CRF: 
• 
• 
Nivo+cabo arm: 73.1% of subjects had delays for nivolumab only, 81.9% for cabozantinib 
only, and 89.4% for either nivolumab or cabozantinib  
Sunitinib arm: 72.8% had dose delays 
Dose reductions (subjects with ≥1 dose reduction) were as follows, as reported on the exposure page 
of the CRF: 
• 
• 
Nivo+cabo arm: 59.4% had dose reductions of cabozantinib 
Sunitinib arm: 52.5% had dose reductions of sunitinib.

As of the 10-Sep-2020 DBL, there remained only one death reported due to study drug in the 
nivo+cabo treatment arm; the verbatim term for the cause of death per investigator was small 
intestine perforation. 
The proportion of patients experiencing all causality AEs leading to discontinuation was 31.6% (drug-
related 23.4%). In Table 29 a summary of safety data from the March 2020 and September 2020 cut-
off is shown.

Deaths 
As of the 30-Mar-2020 DBL, 67 (20.9%) patients in the nivo+cabo arm and 99 (30.9%) of patients in 
the sunitinib arm had died during the study. Disease progression was the most common cause of death 
in both arms (respectively 15.9% and 23.1%). 
Treatment related deaths 
Death in 1 (0.3%) patient due to small intestine perforation in the nivo+cabo arm, and 2 (0.6%) 
patients (due to respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory failure) in the sunitinib arm were 
considered as related to study drug toxicity by the investigator.  
Deaths attributed to other reasons 
Deaths attributed to other reasons were reported in 12 (3.8%) of patients in the nivo+cabo arm and 
17 (5.3%) of patients in the sunitinib arm. The verbatim terms and PT terms with relationship reported 
for the ‘other’ reasons for death in treated patients are provided in Table 33. For one patient who died 
from a GI bleeding and two patients who died from intestinal perforation a causal role of study therapy 
cannot be excluded or ascertained due to limited available information.

Adverse Events Leading to Dose Delay/Interruption or Reduction 
AEs leading to dose delays or reductions 
The numbers and percentages of patients with any-Grade all-causality AEs leading to dose delays or 
reductions were as follows:  
•  Nivo+cabo arm: 267 patients (83.4%) with AEs leading to delays or reductions of any study drugs 
−  Nivolumab only: 10 patients (3.1%) with AEs leading to delays of nivolumab only 
−  Cabozantinib only: 148 patients (46.3%) with AEs leading to delays or reductions of

−  Sequential: 20 patients (6.3%) with AEs leading to sequential delays or reductions of 
nivolumab and cabozantinib  
−  Unassigned: 21 patients (6.6%) were unassigned to any of the above categories due to lack of 
information on the study drug exposure CRF page 
•  Sunitinib arm: 232 patients (72.5%) with AEs leading to delays or reductions of sunitinib

•  Nivo+cabo: diarrhoea (24.4%), PPES (19.1%), and hypertension (10.6%), ALT increased (10.0%) 
•  Sunitinib: PPES (15.0%), diarrhoea (11.3%), hypertension (10.6%), thrombocytopenia (9.7%)  
Most AEs leading to dose delays or reductions were treatment-related AEs. 
Below a specification is given for dose delays and dose reductions. 
All-causality AEs leading to dose delays: 
Any-grade all-causality AEs leading to dose delays of any study drug reported as of the 30-Mar-2020 
DBL were as follows:  
•  Nivo+cabo arm: Any-grade and Grade 3-4 all-causality AEs leading to dose delays due to an

were as follows:  
•  Nivo+cabo: diarrhea (20.6%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) (15.9%), 
hypertension (10.0%), ALT increased (9.1%) 
•  Sunitinib: PPES (10.9%), diarrhea (9.4%), hypertension (8.8%), thrombocytopenia (8.4%) 
All-causality AEs leading to dose reductions: 
•  Nivo+cabo arm: Any-grade and Grade 3-4 all-causality AEs leading to dose reductions of 
cabozantinib occurred in 126 (39.4%) and 29 (9.1%) subjects, respectively. 
•  Sunitinib arm: Any-grade and Grade 3-4 all-causality AEs leading to dose reductions occurred 
in 90 (28.1%) and 28 (8.8%) subjects, respectively. 
The most frequently reported any-grade all-causality AEs leading to dose reductions (of any study 
drugs) were as follows:  
•  Nivo+cabo: PPES (7.8%), diarrhea (5.6%), proteinuria (3.1%), hypertension (2.8%) 
•  Sunitinib: PPES (6.3%), hypertension (3.1%), platelet count decreased (2.8%), diarrhea 
(2.5%). 
Select Adverse Events 
In order to characterize AEs of special clinical interest that are potentially associated with the use of 
nivolumab and/or ipilimumab, the MAH identified select AEs based on the following four guiding 
principles: AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-
immunotherapies; AEs that may require immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids) as part of their 
management; AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity and AEs for 
which multiple event terms may be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby necessitating the 
pooling of terms for full characterization. 
The total number patients with select AEs was 164 (57.5%) in the nivo+cabo arm and 136 (42.5%) in 
the sunitinib arm. The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories (any Grade) were as 
follows in each treatment arm: 
• 
• 
Nivo+cabo: skin (62.2%), gastrointestinal (57.5%), endocrine (42.8%), and hepatic (40.0%) 
Sunitinib: skin (47.2%), gastrointestinal (42.5%), and hepatic (21.9%). 
Refer to Table 34 for further information on drug-related select AEs in the nivo+cabo arm. In the 
sunitinib arm the frequencies of the other reported drug-related select AE categories (any Grade) were 
as follows: endocrine (33.1%), renal (8.1%), pulmonary (0.3%) and hypersensitivity (0.3%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 108/146 
 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AEs by preferred term (any Grade) were as follows in 
each treatment arm: 
• 
• 
Nivo+cabo: diarrhoea (56.9%), PPES (38.1%), and hypothyroidism (33.4%) 
Sunitinib: diarrhoea (42.5%), PPES (40.3%), and hypothyroidism (28.1%)  
The majority of Select AEs were Grade 1-2 and most were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported drug-related serious select AEs by preferred term (any Grade) were as 
follows in each treatment arm 
• 
• 
Nivo+cabo: diarrhoea (3.4%), pneumonitis (2.8%), and adrenal insufficiency (1.9%) 
Sunitinib: acute kidney injury (0.6%) 
For all causality related Select AE categories, the most commonly occurring Grade 3-4 drug-related 
Select AE category was skin and hepatic, which occurred in 10.6% and 10.3% of patients in the 
nivo+cabo treatment arm, respectively, compared to 7.5% and 3.4% in the sunitinib arm, 
respectively. 
Across the select AE categories established immune-related management algorithms were used to 
manage IMAEs (e.g. dose interruptions and immune-modulating medication, mainly systemic 
corticosteroids). Except for endocrine events, most drug-related select AEs with nivo+cabo had 
resolved (ranging from 65.8% to 100.0% across categories) at the time of 30-Mar-2020 DBL. Some 
endocrine select AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone 
replacement therapy. 
Data regarding Onset, Management, and Resolution of Drug-Related Select AEs are shown in Table 34. 
Note that some endocrine select AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for 
hormone replacement therapy.

Immune-mediated Adverse Events 
IMAE analyses included events, regardless of causality, occurring within 100 days of the last dose (i.e., 
with extended follow-up). These analyses occurred on patients who received immune-modulating 
medication for treatment of the event, with the exception of endocrine events, which were included in 
the analysis regardless of treatment since these events are often managed without 
immunosuppression. In addition, these events were identified by the investigator as IMAEs with no 
clear alternate aetiology and an immune mediated component.  
The most frequently reported IMAEs (any Grade) were as follows in each treatment arm: 
•  Nivo+cabo: hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (25.3%), hepatitis (10.0%), and rash (10.0%) 
•  Sunitinib: hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (9.7%) and hepatitis (2.2%)  
The frequencies of the remaining reported IMAEs (any-Grade) in the sunitinib arm were as follows: 
Adrenal insufficiency (0%), DM (0%), Hyperthyroidism (0.3%), Hypophysitis (0%), pneumonitis (0%), 
Diarrhoea/colitis (0.3%), Nephritis/Renal Dysfunction (0.6%), rash (0.6%) and hypersensitivity (0%). 
For more information on IMAEs in the nivo+cabo arm refer to Table 35. 
Across IMAE categories, established immune-related management algorithms were used to manage 
IMAEs (e.g. dose interruptions and immune-modulating medication, mainly systemic corticosteroids). 
Some endocrine IMAEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone 
replacement therapy. Some endocrine IMAEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need 
for hormone replacement therapy. Non-endocrine IMAEs occurred infrequent in the sunitinib arm.

Denominator is based on the number of patients who experienced the event. 
From Kaplan-Meier estimation. 
Symbol + indicates a censored value. 
Patients who experienced IMAE without worsening from baseline Grade were excluded from time to resolution 
analysis. 
Events without a stop date or with a stop date equal to the death as well as Grade 5 events are considered 
unresolved. 
Percentages are based on patients who were re-challenged. Numerator is the number of patients who had a 
recurrence  (or  a  positive  re-challenge)  and  the  denominator  is  the  number  of  patients  who  were  re-
challenged. A positive re-challenge/recurrence is defined as any occurrence of new event(s) or worsening of 
any severity Grade IMAE on or after study therapy re-initiation. 
For oral drugs, dose delays include delays and interruptions.

Other Events of Special Interest 
Other Events of Special Interest are defined as events that do not fulfil all criteria to qualify as IMAEs or 
select AEs. These events may differ from those caused by non-immunotherapies and may require 
immunosuppression as part of their management. Overall, OESIs were reported in 8/320 (2.5%) 
patients (14 OESIs) in the nivo+cabo arm and 1/320 (0.3%) patient in the sunitinib arm (see Table 
36). 
In the nivo+cabo arm, 11 of the 14 OESIs were resolved at the time of DBL, whereas three events 
were not (acute pancreatitis, pancreatitis, and myocarditis). Of the 11 resolved events, 8 resolved with 
IMM treatment. In the sunitinib arm, a single patient reported uveitis; there were no events in any 
other OESI categories. The single event of uveitis resolved with IMM treatment.

Events to Monitor for Cabozantinib 
A set of events to monitor (ETMs) has been defined for cabozantinib to track events known to be 
associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway 
inhibition, that may have potentially serious consequences, or that were determined to warrant 
ongoing routine surveillance. Refer to

Table 37 for a summary of these events.. Data on time to resolution of ETMs and on recurrence after 
reinititating therapy for ETMs is provided in Table 38 and  
Table 39. 
ETMs Grade≥3 
The most frequently observed ETMs with Grade 3 or higher (>5% in any treatment arm) events in the 
study population were PPES, hypertension, and venous and mixed thrombotic events. ETMs with Grade 
3 or higher events occurring at rates between 2 and 5% (in any treatment arm) were hepatotoxicity, 
proteinuria and haemorrhage. The remaining Grade 3 or higher ETMs included events at a rate of less 
than 2%. 
Grade 3 or higher ETM rates for nivo+cabo which were higher to those in the sunitinib treatment arm 
are venous and mixed thrombotic events (7.2% for nivo+cabo vs 2.5% for sunitinib) and 
hepatotoxicity (4.4% for nivo+cabo vs 1.3% for sunitinib). 
Serious ETMs 
The serious events in the venous and mixed thrombotic ETM showed an event onset range from 29 to 
430 days (approximately 40% of the events occurred beyond study day 100) and the highest severity 
was Grade 4. Approximately two thirds of these events were pulmonary embolism, which were 
generally successfully treated with low molecular weight heparins, as demonstrated by the short time 
(within 10 days) to event resolution. Although venous and mixed thromboembolic events are a well-
characterized risk for cabozantinib, some of the observed events included alternative aetiologies. 
Hepatotoxicity 
In order to monitor for more severe hepatic events, the hepatotoxicity ETM was established. The 
serious events in the hepatotoxicity ETM showed an event onset ranging from 44 to 70 days and the 
highest severity was Grade 4. They were short-lasting and generally resolved with the use of steroids 
for these events. The study drug actions with regard to cabozantinib and nivolumab (i.e. interruptions, 
delays or discontinuations) were variable across these events. 
Grade 5 ETMs 
Grade 5 ETMs had low and similar rates across treatment arms and consisted of different isolated 
events within each treatment arm. In the nivo+cabo treatment arm, the 5 reported events were all 
assessed as not related to study drug by the investigator. A GI perforation occurred on study day 20 
following an intestinal obstruction after having received only 1 nivolumab infusion and 5 days of 
cabozantinib therapy. An upper GI haemorrhage, leading to a hypovolemic shock, was observed on 
study day 264 and the last nivolumab and cabozantinib administration occurred 26 and 22 days, 
respectively, prior to the event. In the 3 remaining patients the observed causes for the fatal outcome 
were not specified: sudden death (patient was found dead on day 33), cardiorespiratory arrest (event 
occurred on day 21, 20 and 6 days, respectively after study drugs were discontinued for increased 
blood creatinine levels) and cardiac arrest (event occurred on day 180 in a patient who started 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim on day 170 for an unknown indication whilst being treated with a 
statin, ACE inhibitor and a tricyclic antidepressant). In addition, the patient with Grade 4 AE of small 
intestinal perforation died 51 days after the last dose of nivolumab and 46 days after the last dose of 
cabozantinib. The event was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug toxicity, and 
the narrative for this event is provided in the section on treatment related deaths.

Nivo+cabo: decreased absolute lymphocytes (6.9% Grade 3)  
Sunitinib: decreased absolute neutrophil count (10.3% Grade 3), decreased absolute 
lymphocytes (10.0% Grade 3), decreased platelet count (7.4% Grade 3), and decreased 
leukocytes (5.1% Grade 3) 
Liver function tests 
On-treatment liver function parameters that worsened relative to baseline are summarized in  
Table 40. ALT and AST increases were reported more frequently with nivo+cabo (78.8% and 77.3%, 
respectively) compared to sunitinib (39.0% and 57.1%, respectively).  
Of the 83 (26.2%) patients with ALT/AST of > 3X ULN in the nivo+cabo arm, the median (range) time 
to onset was 10.14 (2.0-88.3) weeks; 23 (27.7%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids. The 
abnormalities of AST/ALT > 3X ULN resolved in 74 (89.2%) patients, with the median (range) time to 
resolution of 2.14 (0.4, 83.6+) weeks. Of 32 patients who were re challenged with either nivolumab 
and/or cabozantinib (8 re-challenged with nivolumab only; 6 re-challenged with cabozantinib only, and 
18 re-challenged with both nivolumab and cabozantinib), 22 (62.9%) patients had no recurrence of 
ALT/AST > 3X ULN. There were 9 subjects who had no ALT/AST lab values indicating resolution to ≤ 3 
xULN. Four out of these had died due to disease progression. In four other patients the adverse events 
eventually resolved, while nivo+cabo or nivolumab was discontinued in these patients. One patient 
withdrew consent. 
Of the 35 (11.0%) patients with AST or ALT > 5X ULN (CTCAE Grade 3+) in the nivo+cabo arm, the 
median (range) time to onset was 8.29 (2.1 - 53.9) weeks, 14 (40.0%) were treated with systemic 
corticosteroids. The abnormalities of AST/ALT > 5X ULN resolved in 29 (82.9%) patients, with the 
median (range) time to resolution was 3.00 (0.4 - 81.6+) weeks. Of 14 patients who were re 
challenged with either nivolumab and/or cabozantinib (4 re-challenged with nivolumab only; 4 with 
cabozantinib only, and 6 re challenged with both nivolumab and cabozantinib treatment), 9 (60.0%) 
patients had no recurrence of ALT/AST > 5X ULN. 
A total of 4/317 (1.3%) patients in the nivo+cabo arm had concurrent ALT or AST elevation > 3X ULN 
with total bilirubin (TBili) > 2X ULN within 1 day and within 30 days of last dose of study. One 
additional patient in the nivo+cabo arm reported concurrent ALT or AST elevation > 3X ULN with total 
bilirubin > 2X ULN more than 30 days after last dose of either nivolumab or cabozantinib, and 
therefore not included in Table 42. 
A summary of patients with liver function abnormalities is provided in Table 42 and a summary of 
patients with concurrent ALT/AST > 3XULN and Bilirubin > 2 X ULN in Nivo+Cabo Group is provided in

Kidney Function Tests 
In the nivo+cabo and sunitinib arms, 31.2% of patients with at least 1 on treatment measurement had 
normal (Grade 0) creatinine values during the treatment reporting period. 
In both treatment arms, a similar amount of kidney function abnormalities was seen (Table 44). 4 
(1.3%) patients in the nivo+cabo arm and 2 (0.6%) of patients in the sunitinib arm had a Grade 3-4 
increased creatinine level.

Electrolytes 
On-treatment electrolyte laboratory parameters that worsened relative to baseline are summarized in  
Table 40. Any-Grade hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia were reported more 
frequently with nivo+cabo (54.8%, 49.7%, and 68.4%, respectively) compared to sunitinib (23.9%, 
28.9%, and 47.6% respectively). The following Grade 3 abnormalities in electrolytes were observed in 
≥ 5% of treated patients in either arm with on-treatment laboratory results: 
• 
• 
Nivo+cabo: hyponatremia (11.7%), hypophosphatemia (20.6%) 
Sunitinib: hyponatremia (11.9%), hypophosphatemia (6.8%) 
ECG abnormalities 
ECG abnormalities at baseline and on-treatment are shown in Table 46. The treatment emergent 
abnormalities with potential clinical significance under ‘Other’ were summarized in the following 
categories: 1) QT prolongation in 6 subjects with nivo + cabo and 3 with sunitinib; 2) Infarct/MI in 4 
subjects with nivo+cabo and 4 with sunitinib; 3) LAFB/LBBB/BIFASCICULAR in 7 subjects with 
nivo+cabo and 5 with sunitinib.

Table 46 Electrocardiogram Abnormality Frequencies - All Treated Subjects in CA2099ER 
Safety in special populations 
The MAH analysed frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivo+cabo arm and sunitinib 
arm for subgroups of age, gender, and geographic region. 
• 
• 
The following numerical differences were observed in the subgroups of gender within the 
Endocrine Disorder SOC: female patients reported more all-causality any Grade AEs than male 
patients for both treatment arms (nivo+cabo: 36.8% for males and 50.7% for females; 
sunitinib: 28.2% for males and 38.7% for females). Drug-related AEs also showed a higher 
incidence for female patients in Endocrine Disorders SOC. 
The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivo+cabo arm and sunitinib arm 
for the subgroup of geographic region (US/Canada/West Europe/North Europe) were similar to 
the AE frequencies reported for the rest of the world by treatment. 
•  Subgroup analyses comparing favourable risk patients with patients with intermediate/poor 
risk were reported. These data indicate that there are no large differences in all-causality (Any 
Grade, Grade 3-4) AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation between subjects with 
favourable risk versus the subgroup of subject with intermediate/poor risk for the nivo+cabo 
arm. 
Subgroup analyses for safety per age are presented in Table 47, Table 48 and  
Table 49.

Immunogenicity 
Of the 263 nivolumab ADA evaluable patients in the nivo+cabo arm, 12 patients (4.6%) were 
nivolumab ADA positive at baseline, and 13 patients (4.9%) were nivolumab treatment-emergent ADA 
positive after the start of treatment. For baseline positive patients in order to be categorized as 
treatment-emergent ADA positive, the titer post-treatment had to increase by 4-fold after start of 
treatment (Table 50). 
• 
• 
1 (0.4%) patient was considered persistent positive, and 1 (0.4%) patient was neutralizing 
ADA positive.  
Treatment-emergent ADA titers ranged from 2 to 16. The highest titer value observed in 
nivolumab ADA positive patients was 16, which occurred in 1 patient on Cycle 4 Day 1.

Comparison of safety data for nivo+cabo to safety data of monotherapy 
components 
Nivolumab Monotherapy 
In advanced RCC, nivolumab monotherapy safety data are available from two studies (CA209025 and 
study CA209669). 
CA209025 - Previously Treated Advanced RCC 
CA209025 was a phase 3 study of nivolumab (3 mg/kg Q2W) vs everolimus (10 mg PO QD) in patients 
with advanced or metastatic clear cell RCC who have received prior angiogenic therapy (n = 803 
treated [406 with nivolumab and 397 with everolimus. In this study AEs were reported by the 
Investigator, and were based on a 18-Jun-2015 DBL, with a minimum follow-up of approximately 14 
months (Table 52). All-causality AEs occurred in 97.8% of the patients in the nivolumab arm vs 97.2% 
of the patients in the everolimus arm. Severe all-causality AEs were observed in respectively 53.2% vs 
56.4% of the patients, all-causality SAEs in respectively 47.8% vs 43.6% of the patients and deaths 
due to study drug toxicity respectively in 0 vs 0.5%(n=2) patients.  
CA209669 - Previously Untreated Advanced RCC (unapproved indication) 
CA209669 was a phase 2, investigator-sponsored research, single-arm study of nivolumab 
monotherapy (240 mg Q2W for 6 doses, then 360 mg Q3W for 4 doses, followed by 480 mg Q4W) in 
previously untreated advanced RCC (n = 123 treated with nivolumab). Safety data presented from 
Study CA209669 are based on a 27-Apr-2020 DBL, with a median follow-up of 15.9 months (Table 
52). In CA209669, AEs were not reported according to select AE or IMAE criteria per standard 
nivolumab program definitions. Laboratory test abnormalities were not collected in CA209669. All-
causality AEs occurred in 100% of the patients, severe all-causality AEs were observed in 56.9% of the 
patients, all-causality SAEs in 26.8% of the patients and deaths due to study drug toxicity was 
reported in 0.8% (n=1) patient.  
Cabozantinib Monotherapy 
In advanced RCC, cabozantinib monotherapy safety data are available the METEOR and CABOSUN 
studies. 
METEOR - Previously Treated Advanced RCC 
METEOR is a phase 3, randomized, controlled study of cabozantinib (60 mg PO QD) vs everolimus (10 
mg PO QD) in patients with advanced RCC who had progressed after at least one prior VEGFR TKI 
therapy (n = 653 treated [331 with cabozantinib and 322 with everolimus]). Safety data from 
METEOR, presented in Table 52, comprise AEs as reported by Investigator, and are based on a 31 Dec-

2015 data cut-off date, with a median follow-up of 18.7 months. All-causality AEs occurred in 100% of 
the patients in the cabozantinib arm vs 99.7% of the patients in the everolimus arm. Severe all-
causality AEs were observed in respectively 68% vs 58% of the patients, all-causality SAEs in 
respectively 40% vs 43% of the patients and deaths due to study drug toxicity respectively in 0.3% 
(n=1) vs 0.6%(n=2) of the patients.  
CABOSUN - Previously Untreated Advanced RCC 
CABOSUN was a phase 2, randomized study of cabozantinib (60 mg QD) vs sunitinib (50 mg PO QD [4 
weeks on/ 2 weeks off]) in previously untreated advanced RCC (n = 150 treated [78 with cabozantinib 
and 72 with sunitinib]). Safety data presented from CABOSUN comprise AEs that are based on a 13-
Jan-2017 data cut-off date, with a median follow-up of 25.0 months. ALT/AST increases were only 
collected as AEs in CABOSUN (laboratory test abnormalities were not collected in these studies). All-
causality AEs occurred in 96% of the patients in the cabozantinib arm vs 99% of the patients in the 
sunitinib arm. Severe all-causality AEs were observed in respectively 68% vs 65% of the patients, all-
causality SAEs in respectively 49% vs 51% of the patients and deaths due to study drug toxicity 
respectively in 2.6% (n=2) vs 5.6%(n=4) of the patients. See also Table 52.

Hepatotoxicity 
Nivolumab Monotherapy 
In CA209025, all causality any Grade AEs of increased ALT and AST were reported in 6.4% (3.0% 
Grade 3-4) and 7.6% (2.7% Grade 3-4) of nivolumab-treated patients, respectively. Laboratory test 
abnormalities of increased ALT (21.7% any Grade; 3.2% Grade 3-4) and AST (32.8% any Grade; 
2.8% Grade 3-4) were mostly Grade 1-2 in severity. 
In CA209025, all causality hepatic select AEs were reported in 16% of nivolumab-treated patients 
(4.7% Grade 3-4),13 including the PTs ALT increased and AST increased (same frequencies and 
severities within ‘select AE category’ as using all-causality AE definition, above). The majority of 
hepatic select AEs were considered drug-related (11.3% any Grade; 2.7% Grade 3-4) by the 
investigator.  
In CA209669, the majority of all causality AEs of increased ALT (17.1% any Grade; 2.4% Grade 3-4) 
and AST (15.4% any Grade; 2.4% Grade 3-4) were Grade 1-2 in severity. 
Cabozantinib Monotherapy 
In METEOR, all causality AEs of increased ALT (16% any Grade, 2.4% Grade 3-4) and AST (18% any 
Grade, 1.8% Grade 3-4; see Table 7.2.1-1) as well as laboratory test abnormalities of increased ALT 
(68% any Grade; 3.3% Grade 3-4) and AST (74% any Grade, 3.3% Grade 3-4) were mostly Grade 1-
2 in severity. 
In CABOSUN, most of the all causality AEs of increased ALT (55% any Grade, 5.1% Grade 3-4) and 
AST (60% any Grade, 2.6% Grade 3-4) reported were Grade 1-2. 
Nivolumab + Cabozantinib 
Any Grade laboratory abnormalities of increased ALT and AST were reported in 78.8% and 77.3%. 
When comparing the Grade 3-4 lab abnormalities of increased ALT and AST with nivolumab (3.2% ALT 
and 2.8% AST) and cabozantinib (3.3% ALT and 3.3% ALT) monotherapies, a higher incidence of 
Grade 3-4 lab abnormalities of increased ALT (9.8%) and AST (7.9%) were noted with nivo+cabo in 
CA2099ER. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with nivolumab. No new 
information has been generated in support of this submission. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Any-Grade all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drugs were reported in 63 patients 
(19.7%) in the nivo+cabo arm, and 54 patients (16.9%) in the sunitinib arm (Table 53)

• 
21 patients (6.6%) discontinued nivolumab only due to AEs 
24 patients (7.5%) discontinued cabozantinib only due to AEs 
18 patients (5.6%) discontinued both nivolumab and cabozantinib due to the same AE at the 
same time

There were no subjects that had AEs leading to sequential discontinuation (subject had an AE which 
led to discontinuation of only one drug followed by another incidence of AE which led to the 
discontinuation of the other drug only) as of the 30-Mar-2020 DBL. 
The most common all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drugs were: 
• 
• 
Nivo+cabo: ALT increased (1.9%), AST increased (1.6%), proteinuria (1.6%), adrenal 
insufficiency (0.9%), malignant neoplasm progression (0.9%), and pneumonitis (0.9%) 
Sunitinib: malignant neoplasm progression (2.2%), proteinuria (1.9%), ALT increased (0.9%), 
AST increased (0.9%), blood bilirubin increased (0.9%), and PPES (0.9%) 
Grade 3-4 AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drugs were reported in 34 (10.6%) patients in 
the nivo+cabo arm and 32 (10.0%) patients in the sunitinib arm. 
Most AEs which lead to discontinuation were considered to be treatment related (Table 54).

Post marketing experience 
Nivolumab: 
• 
Nivolumab was first approved on 04-Jul-2014 in Japan for unresectable melanoma and has 
since been approved in multiple countries, including the US and in the European Union (EU), 
and for other indications as monotherapy. 
• 
Based on pharmacovigilance activities conducted by BMS WorldWide Patient Safety, review of 
post-marketing safety data is consistent with, and confirms the clinical trial safety data for 
nivolumab. 
Cabozantinib: 
• 
• 
Cabozantinib was first approved on 25-Apr-2016 in the US for the treatment of patients with 
advanced RCC and patients with HCC. 
Based on worldwide pharmacovigilance activities conducted by Exelixis Drug Safety, review of 
post-marketing safety data is consistent with, and confirms the clinical trial safety data for 
cabozantinib. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile for nivolumab (240 mg IV Q2W) and cabozantinib (40 mg PO QD) combination 
therapy has not been described previously and is based on the safety data from the open-label pivotal 
study CA2099ER which is an ongoing, phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study vs. sunitinib 
(database lock date 30 March 2020). It should also be noted that the pivotal CE2099ER study was 
performed open-label, which is a potential source of bias. 
Exposure  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 131/146 
 
 
 
 
 
In total 320 patients received treatment with nivo+cabo. Median follow-up was 15.70 months for the 
nivo+cabo arm and 14.59 months for the sunitinib arm. The overall median duration of therapy was 
longer in the nivo+cabo arm (14.26 months) compared to the sunitinib arm (9.23 months). In relation 
to the proposed target population the extent of exposure in the nivo+cabo arm is considered 
acceptable for the assessment of the B/R. Overall, 29.4% of patients discontinued the study (24.4% in 
the nivo+cabo treatment arm, 34.4% in the sunitinib arm). It is likely that the longer time on 
treatment seen with nivo+cabo is reflective of the improved efficacy over the control arm, as most 
patients who discontinued treatment did so due to disease progression (27.8% in the nivo+cabo arm 
vs 48.1% in the sunitinib arm). The long-term safety of the combination of nivo+cabo is not known, 
however this is considered acceptable considering the prognoses of these patients and the fact that 
many patients will receive subsequent therapies.  
Median daily dose cabozantinib was 29.55 mg, which is about 10 mg lower than the planned dose of 
40 mg. In comparison, the median daily dose of sunitinib was 28.42 mg, or about 5 mg lower than the 
planned dose of 33.33 mg/day (50 mg QD for 4 weeks followed by no treatment for 2 weeks). No 
study report has been submitted to support dose selection in the CA2099ER study, which was based on 
safety data from an investigator-initiated phase I dose escalation study (see Section 2.4.1). The dose 
finding study concluded on the 40 mg cabozantinib dose over the 60 mg dose, based on a trend 
towards less treatment related AEs and fewer dose reductions in the 40 mg dose groups (n=12) 
compared to the 60 mg dose groups (n=12). Lower doses of cabozantinib were not investigated (refer 
to procedure EMEA/H/C/004163/II/0017). 
Adverse events 
Nearly all study patients reported any-Grade all-causality AEs; 99.7% in the nivo+cabo arm and 
99.1% in the sunitinib arm. The most frequently reported any-Grade all-causality AEs in the nivo-carbo 
arm were diarrhoea (63.8%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES; 40.0%), 
hypertension (34.7%), hypothyroidism (34.1%), fatigue (32.2%), ALT increased (28.1%), decreased 
appetite (28.1%), nausea (26.6%) and AST increased (25.3%). Most of these AEs were considered to 
be treatment-related in the nivo+cabo arm. There were no large difference between the two study 
arms in frequencies of all causality AEs occurring in ≥ 20% of patients with, however, the exception of 
more frequently reported AEs of diarrhoea (63.8% vs 47.2%), an increased ALT (28.1% vs 8.4%), an 
increased AST (25.3% vs 10.9%) and rash (21.6% vs 8.1%) in the nivo+cabo arm, while anaemia 
(26.6% vs 45.6%) occurred more frequently in the sunitinib arm. 
Any-Grade treatment-related AEs occurring in ≥ 15% of patients were also reported in largely 
comparable frequencies between the two study arms, with the exceptions of the AEs listed in the 
previous paragraph plus pruritus (16.3% vs 4.1%) which occurred more frequently in the nivo+cabo 
arm compared to the sunitinib arm, whereas thrombocytopenia (5.9% vs 19.1%) and a decreased 
platelet count (5.3% vs 18.4%) occurred less frequently in the nivo+cabo arm. 
Grade 3-4 all-causality AEs occurred slightly more frequently in the nivo+cabo arm (70.3%) compared 
to the sunitinib arm (65.3%), particularly when treatment-related AEs were considered (respectively 
60.6% vs 50.6%). The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 all-causality AEs in the nivo+cabo arm 
were hypertension (12.5%), hyponatraemia (9.4%), PPES (7.5%), diarrhoea (6.9%), lipase increased 
(6.3%). Differences between the two study arms were mostly observed in SOCs metabolism and 
nutrition disorders (22.5% vs 12.8%) and blood and lymphatic disorders (3.1% vs 12.5%), but cannot 
be attributed to large difference in AEs by preferred term (PT). 
When AE incidence rates were exposure-adjusted, all-causality AE incidence rates (events per 100 
person-years) were 1705.2 in the nivo+cabo arm and 1852.6 in the sunitinib arm. A relative increase 
of events was thus observed in the sunitinib arm compared to the nivo+cabo arm, since exposure was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 132/146 
 
 
 
 
shorter in the sunitinib arm. Nevertheless, AEs of diarrhoea, AST/ALT increased and hepatotoxicity, 
and rash remain more frequent in the nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm in the exposure-
adjusted event data also. 
Thus, the toxicity profile for nivo+cabo has similarities to the toxicity profile for sunitinib, mainly due 
to events known to be associated with TKIs or VEGF pathway inhibition. However, AEs with 
overlapping toxicities for nivolumab and cabozantinib such as hepatotoxicity, diarrhoea and rash are 
observed more frequently with nivo+cabo treatment, as are immune-related events (discussed below), 
while haematological toxicity is less frequently observed with nivo+cabo treatment compared to 
sunitinib. 
No new safety concerns arise for nivo+cabo treatment compared to the established safety profile of 
monotherapy nivolumab and cabozantinib (60 mg QD) in RCC patients. Increases in ALT and AST 
(except in CABOSUN where these were solicited) and hypothyroidism appear to occur more frequently 
with nivo+cabo than with the both monotherapies. Diarrhoea with nivo+cabo was observed more 
frequent compared to nivolumab monotherapy, and rash with nivo+cabo was observed more frequent 
compared to cabozantinib monotherapy. These are overlapping toxicities for nivolumab and 
cabozantinib. The limitations of cross-trial comparison of different studies should be noted when 
comparing these numbers. The nivolumab SmPC has been updated with the safety profile for 
nivo+cabo and with warnings to reflect that higher frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST 
elevations have been reported and liver enzymes should be monitored before initiation of and 
periodically throughout treatment. Dose modifications for elevated liver enzymes specify: if ALT or AST 
> 3 times ULN but ≤ 10 times ULN without concurrent total bilirubin ≥ 2 times ULN, nivo and cabo 
should be withheld until these recover to Grades 0-1 (rechallenge with a single or both medicines may 
be considered); if ALT or AST > 10 times ULN or > 3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin ≥ 2 
times ULN, both nivo and cabo should be permanently discontinued. In these situations, corticosteroid 
therapy may be considered. Hypothyroidism is already adequately reflected in the nivolumab SmPC.  
The method for considering which ADRs to include in the tabulated list of Section 4.8 of the 
cabozantinib and nivolumab SmPC was based on clinical relevance as determined by the sponsor’s 
medical reviewer. For non-included events assessed as related by the investigator, the MAH has 
provided rationales for evaluation which is considered acceptable.  
SAEs and deaths 
The overall incidence of any-Grade all-causality SAEs was slightly higher in the nivo+cabo vs the 
sunitinib arm (respectively 46.3% vs 39.7%). The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs in ≥ 1% 
patients were diarrhoea (4.7%), malignant neoplasm progression (4.1%), pneumonitis (2.8%), 
pulmonary embolism (2.8%), pneumonia (2.2%) and hyponatraemia (2.2%) in the nivo+cabo arm. 
There were no large differences in frequencies of SAEs, except in SAEs of diarrhoea (4.7% in the 
nivo+cabo arm vs 0% in the sunitinib arm). All-causality SAEs resolved in 73.6% of the patients in the 
nivo+cabo arm and 65.4% of the patients in the sunitinib arm. 
During the study less patients died in the nivo+cabo arm (20.9%) compared to the sunitinib arm 
(30.9%). Most deaths were attributed to disease progression (15.9% vs 23.1%). The frequency of 
death from drug toxicity was low in both treatment arms; in the nivo+cabo arm a single death (0.3%) 
patient due to small intestine perforation was considered related to the study drug by the investigator, 
which is a known ADR for cabozantinib. In the sunitinib arm two deaths (0.6%; patients due to 
respiratory distress and pneumonia/acute respiratory failure) were considered related to study drug 
toxicity. Deaths attributed to other reasons were reported in 12 (3.8%) of subjects in the nivo+cabo 
arm and 17 (5.3%) of subjects in the sunitinib arm. For three of these deaths attributed to other 
reasons (a patient who died from a GI bleeding and two from intestinal perforation) a causal role of 
Assessment report

study therapy cannot be excluded or ascertained due to limited available information. This is somewhat 
unfortunate, however considering the small sample this uncertainty is not considered to influence the 
B/R balance. The cabozantinib SmPC already contains a warning/precautionary for serious GI 
perforations and fistulas (including fatal cases). 
Dose modifications 
In the nivo+cabo arm dose delays (83.4% for both nivo+cabo vs 51.9% for sunitinib) and dose 
reductions (respectively 56.3% [cabozantinib only] vs 51.6%) were more frequent compared to the 
sunitinib arm. Most dose delays (79.9% vs 100%) and reductions (76.3% vs 79.9%) were due to AEs. 
For respectively 20% and 18% of the patients the reason for dose reduction was not reported, thus it 
cannot be excluded that the actual number of dose reductions due to AEs is higher. 
AEs leading to dose modifications (delays + reductions) were seen more often in patients in the 
nivo+cabo arm (83.4%) compared to the sunitinib arm (72.5%), indicating less tolerance in the 
nivo+cabo arm. In the nivo+cabo arm the most frequently reported all-causality AEs leading to dose 
delays or reductions of any study drug were diarrhoea (24.4%), PPES (19.1%), and hypertension 
(10.6%), ALT increased (10.0%). Any-grade all-causality AEs leading to dose delays (delays and 
interruptions) occurred in 78.8% of the patients in the nivo+cabo arm, versus 65.3% patients in the 
sunitinib arm. Any-grade all-causality AEs leading to dose reductions of cabozantinib occurred in 
39.4% versus 28.1% of the patients in the sunitinib arm. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Any-grade all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug occurred at a slightly higher 
rate for the nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm; in total 19.7% of the patients discontinued 
any study drug due to an AE in the nivo+cabo arm (6.6% nivolumab only; 7.5% cabozantinib only; 
5.6% both drugs [due to the same AE at the same time]) vs 16.9% of the patients in the sunitinib 
arm. There were no subjects that had AEs leading to sequential discontinuation in the nivo+cabo arm. 
Most of the AEs leading to discontinuation were Grade 3-4 AEs (10.6% vs 10.0%). In the nivo+cabo 
arm ALT increased (1.9%), AST increased (1.6%), proteinuria (1.6%), adrenal insufficiency (0.9%), 
malignant neoplasm progression (0.9%), and pneumonitis (0.9%) were the most frequent reasons for 
discontinuation. 
AEs specific to nivolumab and cabozantinib 
AEs with potential immune-related aetiology consistent with the mechanism of action of 
immunotherapies/nivolumab (select AEs (57.5% vs 42.5%), immune-mediate AEs (IMAEs; total 
number not provided), other AEs of special interest (OESIs; 2.5% vs 0.3%) were observed more 
frequently in the nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm. 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AEs in the nivo+cabo arm (vs the sunitinib arm) were 
in the categories skin (62.2% vs 47.2%), gastrointestinal (57.5% vs 42.5%), endocrine (42.8% vs 
33.1%), and hepatic (40.0% vs 21.9%). The most frequent IMAEs in the nivo+cabo arm (vs the 
sunitinib arm) were hypothyroidism/ thyroiditis (25.3% vs 9.7%), hepatitis (10.0% vs 2.2%), and rash 
(10.0% vs 0.6%). The majority of these AEs were low grade and most AEs resolved, except for 
endocrine AEs due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy. Management consisted 
amongst others of dose delays and immune modulating medications (the latter per definition for 
IMAEs). In the nivo+cabo arm 11 of the 14 OESIs (almost 80%) had resolved at the time of 30-Mar-
2020 DBL, whereas three events did not resolve (acute pancreatitis, pancreatitis, and myocarditis) at 
the time of DBL. Information and warnings on these type of AEs and recommended management 
strategies are generally well reflected in the nivolumab SmPC. The MAH has stated in the nivolumab 
SmPC that the warnings (SmPC section 4.4) and recommended treatment modifications for these type 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 134/146 
 
 
 
 
of AEs (SmPC section 4.2) also apply for nivolumab only when given in combination with cabozantinib, 
however there are separate instructions/warnings for the nivo+cabo combination with regard to liver 
enzyme elevations (as mentioned above). 
Events to monitor (ETMs, i.e. events known to be associated with TKIs or VEGF pathway inhibition that 
may have serious consequences/ require surveillance) were observed at comparable rates in the 
nivo+cabo arm (78.1%) vs the sunitinib arm (72.8%). The majority of ETMs resolved prior to the 
database lock. However, considering the differences in time exposure between the treatment arms, the 
frequencies of ETMs are of uncertain relevance. The most frequently reported (≥20%) all-causality 
ETMs were PPES, hypertension and haemorrhage, all of which were reported with similar frequencies in 
both treatment arms (40.0%, 35.9% and 21.3% respectively in the nivo+cabo arm, and 40.6%, 
39.1% and 20.9% respectively in the sunitinib arm). The most frequently observed Grade ≥3 ETMs 
were PPES, hypertension, and venous and mixed thrombotic events. Grade 3 or higher ETM rates for 
nivo+cabo which were higher than in the sunitinib treatment arm were venous and mixed thrombotic 
events (7.2% vs 2.5%, respectively) and hepatotoxicity (4.4% vs 1.3%). Most of the PTs in the ETM of 
venous and mixed thrombotic events were pulmonary embolism (20/36 events, of which grade 3-4: 
17/20). There were five events of severity grade 4 in this ETM category. According to the MAH, these 
events were generally successfully treated with low molecular weight heparins, and had a short time 
(within 10 days) to event resolution. Thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism are a 
commonly occurring event with cabozantinib, and are adequately reflected in the cabozantinib SmPC. 
Similar rates of grade 5 ETMs were reported in both treatment arm. There were five (1.6%) grade 5 
ETMs in the nivo+cabo arm, all assessed as unrelated to study drug. The grade 5 ETMs in the 
nivo+cabo arm were: GI perforation, upper GI haemorrhage, sudden death, cardiorespiratory arrest, 
cardiac arrest. 
The ETM of hepatotoxicity includes the SMQs “Drug related hepatic disorders- severe events only”. 
Transaminase elevations, commonly observed during cabozantinib treatment, are not included in the 
hepatotoxicity ETM, but adequately reflected in the ADR tables as separate events of hepatitis (PTs 
hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis) in the Hepatobiliary SOC, and by the ADRs increased ALT, 
increased AST, increased alkaline phosphatase, and increased total bilirubin in the Investigations SOC.  
Laboratory findings 
Nivo+cabo and sunitinib have a different pattern of worsening of laboratory abnormalities relative to 
baseline. In the sunitinib arm haematology abnormalities were more frequent, while in the nivo+cabo 
arm liver function abnormalities, thyroid function abnormalities and certain electrolyte abnormalities 
(hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypophosphataemia) occurred more frequently. Grade 3-4 
electrolyte abnormalities were similar between the two study arms, except for Grade 3-4 
hypophosphataemia (20.6% vs 6.8%) which occurred more frequently in the nivo+cabo arm. This has 
been adequately reflected in the nivolumab SmPC. 
Laboratory abnormalities of ALT and AST increases were reported more frequently with nivo+cabo 
(78.8% and 77.3%, respectively) compared to sunitinib (39.0% and 57.1%, respectively), including 
grade 3 or 4 ALT and AST abnormalities (9.8% and 7.9% vs 3.5% and 2.6%, respectively). In the 
nivo+cabo arm, ALT or AST elevations > 3XULN, >5XULN, >10xULN and > 20XULN occurred for 
26.2%, 11.0%, 3.8% and 0.6% of patients, respectively. In most patients with abnormalities > 3XULN 
these resolved, however for the remaining 10.8% (n=9) of patients with AST or ALT abnormalities 
these did not resolve; four had died due to disease progression, in four patients the adverse events 
eventually resolved, while nivo+cabo or nivolumab was discontinued in these patients. One patient 
withdrew consent. In the nivo+cabo arm five patients met Hy’s law vs 6 in the sunitinib arm. In the 
nivo+cabo arm 4/5 patients recovered after corticosteroid treatment, dose delays or discontinuations.

As previously stated, the SmPC has been updated with information and warnings on liver function 
abnormalities. There are no large differences in the number of patients with ECG abnormalities on 
treatment in the nivo+cabo arm (40.6%) compared to the sunitinib arm (35%).  
Safety in special populations 
When assessing patients younger and older than 65 years there are no large differences between the 
nivo+cabo and sunitinib arm. The subgroup of patients ≥75 years, patients appeared to have worse 
toxicity in the nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm, however due to the small sample of 
patients ≥75 years and the non-randomized comparison (patients were not stratified according to age 
[categories]) a definite conclusions on the toxicity in these patients is not possible. Female patients 
also reported more AEs in the endocrine category than male patients for both treatment arms. There 
are no large differences in all-causality AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation between 
subgroups with favourable risk versus intermediate/poor risk for the nivo+cabo arm. 
Immunogenicity 
Of the ADA-evaluable patients in the nivo+cabo arm (n=263) 13 patients (4.9%) were nivolumab 
treatment-emergent ADA positive after the start of treatment. One (0.4%) patient was considered 
persistent positive, and 1 (0.4%) patient was neutralizing ADA positive. The latter number corresponds 
to rates reported for nivolumab monotherapy. ADAs did not appear to have a negative impact on 
safety or efficacy, but the small numbers hinder definite conclusions. 
Updated safety data 
Updated safety data with a 10-Sep-2020 DBL indicate comparable safety data to the 30-March-2020 
DBL, with the exception of longer exposure in the nivo+cabo arm, a higher proportion of subjects 
requiring at least one dose delay of cabozantinib (81.9% vs 68.11%) and sunitinib (72.8% vs 51.9%) 
more deaths due to disease progression in both arms and more discontinuations due to AEs in both 
arms (for nivo+cabo 31.6 vs 19.7%; for sunitinib 16.9% vs 19.4%) , all of which were to be expected 
and are considered acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In the 1L treatment setting of advanced RCC patients no new safety concerns have arisen for 
nivolumab and cabozantinib combination therapy. ALT and AST increases and hypothyroidism appear 
to occur more frequently with nivo+cabo than with the monotherapies, diarrhoea was observed more 
frequent compared to nivolumab monotherapy, and rash was observed more frequent compared to 
cabozantinib monotherapy. This is likely due to that these are overlapping toxicities for nivolumab and 
cabozantinib. This assessment is complicated by the lack of direct comparison in the pivotal study, and 
by the lower dose of cabozantinib (40 mg) employed with the combination compared to the cross-
referenced monotherapy trials. 
The toxicity of treatment with nivo+cabo is slightly worse compared to treatment with sunitinib in 
terms of a slightly higher rate of severe AEs, SAEs, dose modifications and discontinuations. The most 
important differences in toxicity profile pertain to the AEs of diarrhoea, elevated liver enzymes (AST 
and ALT) and rash, that were more frequently observed in the nivo+cabo arm compared to the 
sunitinib arm, while haematological toxicity was observed less frequently. The toxicity profile for 
nivo+cabo appears manageable with dose delays, dose reductions and, in case of immune-related AEs, 
immune modulating therapies.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- 
one. 
- 
- 
The general design and layout of the proposed PL have not changed compared to the tested 
The new proposed indication concerns the same route of administration. 
The safety profile remains similar to the currently approved indications. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This is an extension of indication for Opdivo in combination with cabozantinib for the first-line 
treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The medicinal products and combinations of medicinal products that are currently recommended by 
ESMO for first-line (1L) systemic treatment in ccRCC are the following (see Figure 1 or eUpdate - 
ESMO RCC algorithm): pembrolizumab + axitinib, sunitinib, pazopanib, tivozanib, nivolumab + 
ipilimumab, and cabozantinib. All are approved by EMA. 
RCC with sarcomatoid features is characterised by limited therapeutic options due to its relative 
resistance to established systemic targeted therapy. Most trials report on a poor median OS of 5 to 12 
months. Studies have shown that sarcomatoid RCC express programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand 
(PD-L1) at a much higher level than non-sarcomatoid RCC, suggesting that blockade of the PD-1/PD-
L1 axis may be an attractive new therapeutic strategy (Pichler et al. Cancers (Basel). 2019). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 140/146 
 
 
 
 
In spite of this (systemic) treatment armamentarium, both (median) progression-free survival (PFS) 
and OS for patients with advanced RCC are still rather limited, especially for patients in the 
intermediate and poor risk groups. There thus remains an unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The single pivotal study in this application is CA2099ER (NCT03141177), a phase 3, open-label, (1:1) 
randomized trial of nivolumab combined with cabozantinib (nivo+cabo, doublet regimen, Arm A) vs 
sunitinib (Arm C) in patients with previously untreated (1L) advanced RCC. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study CA2099ER met its primary endpoint at a pre-planned final analysis for PFS. Nivo+cabo 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS per BICR (primary definition) compared 
with sunitinib (Figure 11): HR = 0.51 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.64); p <0.0001. Median PFS was longer with 
nivo+cabo compared with sunitinib: 16.59 (95% CI: 12.45, 24.94) vs 8.31 (95% CI: 6.97, 9.69) 
months, respectively (an increase of 8.28 months). 
The results of all sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analytical method, and so were 
the results of the secondary analytical method of PFS per BICR (secondary definition) that is the EMA 
preferred analysis (Figure 12): HR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.67; median PFS 14.29 (95% CI: 12.29, 
19.84) vs 8.31 (95% CI: 7.00, 9.69) months. In a subgroup analysis, PFS HRs for almost all subgroups 
favoured nivo+cabo vs sunitinib (HR <1). 
Nivo+cabo demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the secondary endpoint OS 
compared with sunitinib (Figure 14): HR = 0.60 (98.89% CI: 0.40, 0.89); p = 0.0010. Median OS was 
not reached in either treatment group. In a subgroup analysis, OS HRs for almost all subgroups 
favoured nivo+cabo vs sunitinib (HR <1). 
The secondary endpoint ORR per BICR was statistically significantly higher with nivo+cabo than with 
sunitinib: 55.7% (95% CI: 50.1, 61.2) vs 27.1% (95% CI: 22.4, 32.3); difference +28.6% (95% CI: 
21.7, 35.6); odds ratio = 3.52 (95% CI: 2.51, 4.95); p <0.0001 (Table 13). In the nivo+cabo arm 
compared with the sunitinib arm, a numerically higher proportion of patients had a BOR of CR (8.0% 
vs 4.6%) or PR (47.7% vs 22.6%). The median duration of response (DoR) tended to be longer with 
nivo+cabo than with sunitinib: 20.17 (95% CI: 17.31, N.A.) vs 11.47 (95% CI: 8.31, 18.43) months 
(Figure 16). The median time to response (TTR) per BICR for all confirmed responders was 2.83 (95% 
CI: 1.0, 19.4) months with nivo+cabo vs 4.17 (95% CI: 1.7, 12.3) months with sunitinib. In a 
subgroup analysis, the difference in unweighted ORRs favoured nivo+cabo vs sunitinib in all 
subgroups. 
An efficacy benefit of nivo+cabo vs sunitinib was observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic 
score and tumour cell PD-L1 expression status (<1%, ≥1%). 
Updated results (~5.5 months additional follow-up) were confirmative (Table 14). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Notwithstanding the statistically significant improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR observed for nivo+cabo 
compared with sunitinib that were confirmed by the updated results, efficacy data in terms of OS 
remains overall somewhat immature. For example, in the updated results the death rate in the 
nivo+cabo arm was 26.6%; vs 35.4% in the sunitinib arm, with median OS only reached in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 141/146 
 
 
 
 
sunitinib arm (29.47 [28.35, NA] months), and a relatively low percentage of patients had received 
subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy (17.3% vs 34.1%). There thus remains some uncertainty 
regarding an OS benefit, for example in the subgroup of IMDC favourable-risk patients. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Similar frequencies of any-Grade all-causality AEs were reported in the nivo+cabo arm (99.7%) and in 
the sunitinib arm (99.1%). The overall incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs (respectively 70.3% vs 65.3%), 
SAEs (46.3% vs 39.7%) and treatment-related SAEs (24.4% vs 12.8%) was higher in the nivo+cabo 
vs the sunitinib arm. 
The most frequently reported any-Grade all-causality AEs in the nivo+cabo arm were diarrhoea 
(63.8%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES; 40.0%), hypertension (34.7%), 
hypothyroidism (34.1%), fatigue (32.2%), ALT increased (28.1%), decreased appetite (28.1%), 
nausea (26.6%) and AST increased (25.3%). Most of these AEs were considered to be treatment-
related in the nivo+cabo arm.  
Of the any-Grade all-causality AEs occurring in ≥20% of patients, diarrhoea (63.8% vs 47.2%), 
increased ALT (28.1% vs 8.4%), increased AST (25.3% vs 10.9%) and rash (21.6% vs 8.1%) were 
observed much more frequently in the nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm. Further, 
increases in ALT and AST (except in CABOSUN where these were solicited) and hypothyroidism were 
observed more frequently with nivo+cabo treatment compared to both nivolumab (study CA209205 
and CA209669) and cabozantinib monotherapy (METEOR and CABOSUN studies). Frequencies of 
diarrhoea noted with nivo+cabo were higher compared to nivolumab monotherapy, but lower 
compared to cabozantinib monotherapy. Frequencies of rash noted with nivo+cabo were higher 
compared to cabozantinib monotherapy, but lower compared to nivolumab monotherapy. 
The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 all-causality AEs in the nivo+cabo arm were hypertension 
(12.5%), hyponatraemia (9.4%), PPES (7.5%), diarrhoea (6.9%), lipase increased (6.3%). There was 
no large difference in frequencies of Grade 3-4 AEs between the nivo+cabo and sunitinib arm. 
The most frequently reported all-causality SAEs in the nivo+cabo arm were diarrhoea (4.7%), 
malignant neoplasm progression (4.1%), pneumonitis (2.8%), pulmonary embolism (2.8%), 
pneumonia (2.2%) and hyponatraemia (2.2%). There were no large differences in frequencies of SAEs 
between the two study arms, except for diarrhoea (4.7% in the nivo+cabo arm vs 0% in the sunitinib 
arm). 
In the nivo+cabo arm a single (0.3%) death due to small intestine perforation was considered related 
to treatment by the investigator, in the sunitinib arm two (0.6%) deaths due to respiratory distress 
and pneumonia/acute respiratory failure were considered related to treatment.  
Discontinuation of (any) study medication due to AEs occurred at a slightly higher rate in the 
nivo+cabo arm (19.7%: 6.6% nivolumab only; 7.5% cabozantinib only; 5.6% both medicinal products 
[at the same time, for the same AE]) compared to the sunitinib arm (16.9%). In the nivo+cabo arm 
ALT increased (1.9%), AST increased (1.6%) and proteinuria (1.6%) were the most frequent reasons 
for discontinuation. 
AEs with potential immune-related aetiology occurred more frequently in the nivo+cabo arm vs 
the sunitinib arm. The most frequently reported drug-related select AEs in the nivo+cabo arm (vs the 
sunitinib arm) were in the categories skin (62.2% vs 47.2%), gastrointestinal (57.5% vs 42.5%), 
endocrine (42.8% vs 33.1%), and hepatic (40.0% vs 21.9%). The majority of these AEs were low 
Grade and most AEs resolved with dose delays and/or immune modulating medication. An exception 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/159169/2021 
Page 142/146 
 
 
 
 
was endocrine select AEs, in this category most AEs were not considered resolved due to the 
continuing need for hormone replacement therapy. 
AEs potentially associated with TKIs or VEGF inhibition (“event to monitor” [ETMs]) were observed 
at comparable rates in the nivo+cabo arm (78.1%) vs the sunitinib arm (72.8%). Grade 3 or higher 
ETM rates for nivo+cabo which were higher than in the sunitinib treatment arm were venous and 
mixed thrombotic events (7.2% vs 2.5%, respectively) and hepatotoxicity (4.4% vs 1.3%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Median follow-up was 15.70 months for the nivo+cabo arm and 14.59 months for the sunitinib arm. 
Follow-up was relatively short in relation to establishing the long-term safety of the combination of 
nivo+cabo, even with the new safety DBL of 10-Sep-2020. 
It cannot be excluded that the open-label design of the pivotal study may have affected safety 
reporting. 
The contribution of each drug to the safety profile of the combination nivo+cabo was derived from 
cross-study comparisons of trials with the monocomponents in advanced RCC indications. Some 
important differences to these studies include different doses of cabozantinib (60 mg in the 
monotherapy studies vs. 40 mg in CA2099ER), differences in study populations and different methods 
to capture and report safety events. 
Longer duration of therapy in the nivo+cabo treatment arm (14.26 months) compared to sunitinib 
(9.23 months) could result in over-estimation of the magnitude of worse grade 3-4 event and SAE 
profile seen in the nivo+cabo arm relative to sunitinib.  
Few older subject ≥ 75 years participated in the pivotal trial, precluding any interpretation of possible 
differences in the safety profile between patients ≥ 75 years.  
The dose finding trial (CTEP-9681) did not explore lower initial dose levels than 40 mg of cabozantinib.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the single pivotal study CA2099ER, the nivo+cabo combination demonstrated a clinically relevant 
and statistically significant improvement in PFS per BICR (primary definition) compared with sunitinib 
treatment. This result was robust in the sense that the results of all sensitivity analyses and of the 
secondary analytical method of PFS (that is the EMA preferred analysis) were consistent with the 
primary analytical method. Nivo+cabo also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the 
secondary endpoints OS and ORR (per BICR) compared with sunitinib. An efficacy benefit was 
observed regardless of baseline IMDC prognostic score and tumour cell PD-L1 expression status. 
Updated results were confirmative, but remain somewhat immature regarding OS at this time. There 
thus remains some uncertainty regarding an OS benefit, for example in the subgroup of IMDC 
favourable-risk patients. This is, however, acceptable as there is no apparent detrimental effect on OS 
in any subgroup (including the subgroup of IMDC favourable-risk patients that has clearly favourable 
PFS results with support from ORR). 
Regarding the contribution of the individual components, the additive efficacy of both individual 
components has been shown in a qualitative sense based primarily on an increase in ORR over the 
individual agents, even though based on cross-study comparisons (only).

This is to be weighed against the toxicity profile for nivo+cabo which is only slightly worse compared to 
sunitinib, reflected by only slightly higher percentages of Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and dose modifications 
in the nivo+cabo arm. The most important differences in toxicity profile pertain to the AEs of 
diarrhoea, elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and rash that were more frequently observed in the 
nivo+cabo arm compared to the sunitinib arm, while haematological toxicity was observed less 
frequently. 
No new safety concerns were raised for nivolumab or cabozantinib, though increases in ALT and AST, 
and hypothyroidism appear to occur more frequently with nivo+cabo combination therapy compared to 
the monotherapy components separately. With nivo+cabo treatment diarrhoea was observed more 
frequently compared to nivolumab monotherapy, and rash was observed more frequently compared to 
cabozantinib monotherapy. The toxicity profile for nivo+cabo appears manageable with dose delays, 
dose reductions and, in case of immune-related AEs, immune modulating therapies. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The nivo+cabo combination demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in efficacy (PFS, OS, 
and ORR) compared with sunitinib treatment. This combination of an efficacy benefit across all three 
endpoints (PFS, OS, and ORR) is regarded as being clinically relevant. Even though an OS benefit is 
not yet established for all subgroups, this is acceptable since there is no apparent detrimental effect on 
OS in any subgroup. Treatment with nivo+cabo resulted in a slightly worse toxicity profile compared to 
sunitinib. No new safety concerns have arisen for the nivo+cabo combination and the toxicity profile 
for nivo+cabo appears manageable. It can be concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R for Opdivo in combination with cabozantinib for the first-line treatment of adult 
patients with advanced RCC is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Helicobacter Test INFAI 75 mg powder for oral solution 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
One jar contains 75 mg of 13C-urea powder. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
White, crystalline powder for oral solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Helicobacter Test INFAI may be used for in vivo diagnosis of gastroduodenal Helicobacter pylori 
infection in: 
adults, 
- 
adolescents, who are likely to have peptic ulcer disease. 
- 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional and under appropriate 
medical supervision. 
Posology 
Helicobacter Test INFAI is a breath test for single administration. Patients from the age of 12 must 
take the contents of 1 jar with 75 mg. 
Method of administration 
For performance of the test, 200 ml 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric acid in 200 ml water for patients 
from the age of 12 and older (as a pre-administered test meal), as well as tap water (for dissolving the 
13C-urea powder) are necessary. 
The patient must have fasted for over 6 hours, preferably overnight. The test procedure takes 
approximately 40 minutes. 
In case it is necessary to repeat the test procedure, this should not be done until the following day. 
The suppression of Helicobacter pylori might give false negative results. Therefore the test shall be 
used after at least four weeks without systemic antibacterial therapy and two weeks after last dose of 
acid antisecretory agents. Both might interfere with the Helicobacter pylori status. This is especially 
important after Helicobacter eradication therapy. 
It is important to follow the instructions for use adequately (see section 6.6), otherwise the reliability 
of the outcome will become questionable.

4.3  Contraindications 
The test must not be used in patients with documented or suspected gastric infection or atrophic 
gastritis, which might interfere with the urea breath test (see section 4.2). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
A positive test alone does not constitute indication for eradication therapy. Differential diagnosis with 
invasive endoscopic methods might be indicated in order to examine the presence of any other 
complicating conditions, e.g. ulcer, autoimmune gastritis and malignancies. 
There is insufficient data on the diagnostic liability of the Helicobacter Test INFAI to recommend its 
use in patients with gastrectomy. 
For children from the age of 3, Helicobacter Test INFAI for children aged 3 to 11 is available. 
In individual cases of A-gastritis (atrophic gastritis) the breath test may have false positive results; 
other tests may be required to confirm the Helicobacter pylori status. 
If the patient vomits during the test procedure, necessitating the repetition of the test, this should be 
done in fasted condition and not before the following day (see section 4.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Helicobacter Test INFAI will be affected by all treatments interfering with Helicobacter pylori status 
or urease activity. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
It is not expected that the test procedure may be harmful during pregnancy or lactation. 
It is recommended to take notice of the product information of eradication therapy products for their 
use during pregnancy and lactation. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Helicobacter Test INFAI has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
None known. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Due to the fact that only 75 mg of 13C-urea is delivered, an overdose is not expected.

For the amount of 75 mg 13C-urea, which is administered per unit in the course of the breath test, no 
pharmacodynamic activity is described. 
After oral ingestion the labelled urea reaches the gastric mucosa. In the presence of Helicobacter 
pylori the 13C-urea is metabolised by the enzyme urease of Helicobacter pylori. 
2H2N(13CO)NH2 + 2H2O     Enzyme urease      4NH3 + 213CO2 
The carbon dioxide diffuses into the blood vessels. From there it is transported as bicarbonate into the 
lung and liberated as 13CO2 with the exhaled air. 
In the presence of bacterial urease the ratio of the 13C/12C-carbon isotopes is significantly changed. 
The portion of 13CO2 in the breath samples is determined by isotope-ratio-mass-spectrometry (IRMS) 
and stated as an absolute difference (-value) between the 00-minute- and the 30-minute-values. 
Urease is produced in the stomach only by Helicobacter pylori. Other urease producing bacteria were 
seldom found in the gastric flora. 
The cut off point for discriminating Helicobacter pylori-negative and positive patients is determined to 
be -value of 4 ‰, which means that an increase of the -value by more than 4 ‰ indicates an 
infection. In comparison to bioptic diagnostics of an infection with Helicobacter pylori, the breath test 
achieved in clinical trials on 457 patients, a sensitivity in the range of 96.5 % to 97.9 % [95 %-CI: 
94.05 %-99.72 %], and a specificity range from 96.7 % to 100 %. [95 %-CI: 94.17 %-103.63 %], 
whereas in clinical trials on 93 adolescents from the age 12–17, a sensitivity of 97.7 % [90 %-CI: 
91.3 %], and a specificity of 96.0 % [90 %-CI: 89.7 %] were achieved. 
In the absence of bacterial urease, the whole amount of the administered urea after absorption from the 
gastrointestinal tract will be metabolised like the endogenous urea. Ammonia which is produced as 
described above by the bacterial hydrolysis is included into the metabolism as NH4
+. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The orally applied 13C-urea is metabolised to carbon dioxide and ammonia or is integrated into the 
body’s own urea cycle. Any increase in 13CO2 will be measured by isotopic analysis. 
Absorption and distribution of 13CO2 is faster than the urease reaction. Therefore, the rate-limiting step 
in the whole process is the cleavage of 13C-urea by Helicobacter's urease. 
Only in Helicobacter pylori-positive patients does the administration of 75 mg labelled urea lead to a 
significant increase of 13CO2 in the breath sample within the first 30 minutes. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No concerns in relation to the clinical use of the product.

The test is to be performed in the presence of a qualified person. 
Each patient should be documented according to the provided data sheet. It is recommended to 
perform the test with the patient being in a resting position. 
The test starts with the collection of samples for the determination of baseline-value (00-minute-
value): 
• 
Take the straw and the two sample tubes with the label 
“Sampling time: 00-minute-value” out of the test set. 
Remove the stopper from one of the sample tubes, unwrap the straw and place the straw 
into the container. 
Now the patient breathes gently through the straw until the inner surface of the sample 
tube steams up. 
By continuously breathing the patient must pull out the straw and immediately close the 
sample tube with its stopper. 
(If the sample tube remains open for more than 30 seconds, the test result might be 
falsified.) 
Hold the sample tube upright and stick the bar-code label marked “00-minute-value” 
round the sample tube, so that the lines of the bar-code are horizontal. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Fill up the second sample tube (Label “Sampling time: 00-minute-value”) with breath by 
following the same procedure. 
Now 200 ml of 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric acid in 200 ml water must be drunk by the 
patient without delay. 
Now the preparation of the test solution follows: 
• 
The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is taken from the test set, opened, and filled up to 
three quarters of its volume with tap water. 
Close the jar and shake it carefully until all the powder is dissolved. Pour the contents 
into a drinking glass. 
Fill the 13C-urea jar to the brim with water for a second and third time and add these 
contents to the drinking glass (total volume of tap water should be approximately 30 ml).

This test solution must now be drunk immediately by the patient, and the time of application 
must be noted. 
Thirty minutes after administration of the test solution (point 7), collect the 30-minute-value 
samples in the two containers which are left in the test package (Label “Sampling time: 
30-minute-value”), as described under steps 3 to 4. Use the bar-code labels marked “30-minute-
value” for these samples. 
Put the relevant bar-code label on the data sheet for patient documentation. Finally seal the 
package with the sticker. 
10.  The sample tubes have to be sent in the original packaging, for analysis, to a qualified 
laboratory. 
Analysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories 
The breath samples, collected in 10 ml glass- or plastic sample tubes, are analysed by isotope ratio 
mass spectrometry (IRMS). 
The analysis of the 13C/12C-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test 
Helicobacter Test INFAI. The accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath 
analysis. The specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity, stability (reference gas 
precision), and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system. 
It has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory. The method validated in 
the application is as follows: 
• 
Sample preparation for (IRMS) 
To determine the 13C/12C-ratio of carbon dioxide in breath by mass spectrometric analysis the carbon 
dioxide must be separated from the breath and introduced into the mass spectrometer. The automatic 
preparation system for isotope mass spectrometers which is dedicated for breath test analysis is based 
on a gas-chromatographic continuous flow separation technique. 
Water is removed from the sample by means of a Nafion water trap or the gas-chromatographic 
preparation system that separates the individual gases in a gas chromatographic column with Helium 
as eluent. Passing the column the separated gas species of breath are detected by an ionisation 
detector. The fraction of carbon dioxide gas, identified by its characteristic retention time, is 
introduced into mass spectrometer. 
• 
Mass spectrometric analysis 
To analyse the separated carbon dioxide sample gas its molecules must be ionised, formed into a 
beam, accelerated by an electric field, deflected in a magnetic field, and finally detected. These five 
processes take place in the analyser of a mass spectrometer, which consists of three separate sections: 
the source, flight tube, and collector. Ionisation, beam formation and acceleration all occur in the 
source, magnetic deflection takes place in the flight tube and detection takes place in the collector. 
• 
Sample inlet 
For introduction of the carbon dioxide into the analyser many sample inlet systems are available. For 
breath test analysis the individual balancing of the carbon dioxide of the sample to a reference 
standard gas is essential. This ensures the high accuracy of this system, as calculation of the isotopic 
content in carbon dioxide is done with respect to an independent standard. 
• 
Specifications for determining 13C/12C-ratios 
The breath test concept relies on the administration of a specifically 13C-labelled urea whose 
metabolite utilisation is monitored by measuring 13CO2 in the expired breath gas. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The mass spectrometer must be capable of: 
Multiple replicate analyses:  Minimum of 3 replicate analyses of the same sample during operation 
Security access: 
Storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to 
avoid later manipulation 
Adjustment: 
13C/12C-ratio with respect to Pee Dee Beliminate (PDB) 
Sample loop: 
< 200 µl 
The principal tests to verify the specifications are linearity, stability (reference gas precision), and 
precision of measurement. 
• 
All mass spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications: 
Linearity: 
 0.5 ‰ for breath samples varying between 1 % and 7 % 
CO2-concentration 
Stability: 
 0.2 ‰ on 10 consecutive pulses 
Precision of measurement: 
 0.3 ‰ for 13C at natural abundance using a 10 ml breath sample tube 
with 3 % CO2 breath concentration 
Helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13C/12C of baseline-value and 30-minute-
value exceeds 4.0 ‰. 
Alternatively, any other suitable-validated method may be used, carried out by any objectively 
qualified laboratory.

Analysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories 
The breath samples, collected in 100 ml breath bags, are analysed by non-dispersive infrared 
spectrometry (NDIR). 
The analysis of the 13C/12C-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test 
Helicobacter Test INFAI. The accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath 
analysis. The specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity, stability (reference gas 
precision), and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system. 
It has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory. It is recommended to 
measure as soon as possible after the breath collection, in any case not later than 4 weeks. 
The method validated in the application is as follows: 
• 
Sample preparation for Infrared Spectroscopy (NDIR) 
The determination of 13C/12C-ratio in the carbon dioxide of the breath samples is carried out directly in 
the breath. The breath from the bags will be introduced into the NDIR spectrometer using a variable 
gas pump. The water content of the breath sample will be kept mostly constant through Nafion water 
trap. For calibration and measurement necessary CO2-free air (zero-gas) will be produced via an 
integrated CO2-absorber in the analysator. 
• 
Infrared spectroscopic analysis 
To analyse the carbon dioxide in breath a broad band infrared radiation bunch emitted by an infrared 
radiation source is alternately sent through the measuring chamber and a reference chamber by means 
of a beam chopper. The modulated infrared beams then enter the infrared detectors, which are double 
layer transmission detectors with a front, and a rear chamber each filled with one of the isotopicly pure 
gases (13CO2 or 12CO2, respectively) to be measured. The infrared radiation in the measuring chamber 
is weakened by the gas component to be measured. Thus the radiation equilibrium between measuring 
and comparative beam is disturbed. In consequence there is a temperature fluctuation, which in its turn 
causes a fluctuating pressure in the front chamber of the infrared detector. A membrane capacitor 
connected with this chamber, which is exposed to a high resistance direct voltage, transforms these 
pressure fluctuations into an alternating voltage, which is a measure of the isotopic composition of 
breath carbon dioxide.

Sample Inlet 
A semi-automatic sample inlet system injects the measuring gas in definite amounts into the zero gas 
circulating in the gas circuit of the infrared spectrometer. This enables measurement of the 
13C/12C-ratio at any CO2 concentration above 1 %. 
• 
Specifications for determining 13C/12C-ratios 
The breath test concept is based upon the oral administration of 13C-labelled urea whose enzymatic 
hydrolysis is monitored by measuring 13CO2 in breath using non-dispersive infrared spectrometry. 
• 
Infrared spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications: 
Multiple replicate analyses:  Minimum of 3 replicate analyses of the same sample during operation 
Security access: 
Storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to 
avoid later manipulation 
For verifying the specifications linearity, stability, and precision of measurement have to be tested. 
Zero point adjustment of the detectors by means of the zero gas generated in the spectrometer. End-
point adjustment of the detectors by means of calibration gases of precisely known concentration. 
Linearity: 
 0.5 ‰ for breath samples varying between 1 % and 7 % 
CO2-concentration 
Stability: 
 0.3 ‰ at 10 consecutive pulses 
Precision of measurement: 
 0.5 ‰ for 13C at natural abundance using a 100 ml breath bag with 
3 % CO2 breath concentration 
Helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13C/12C of baseline-value and 30-minute-
value exceeds 4.0 ‰. 
Alternatively, any other suitable-validated method may be used, carried out by any objectively 
qualified laboratory.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  
Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 45 mg powder for oral solution 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
One jar contains 45 mg of 13C-urea powder. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
White, crystalline powder for oral solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 may be used for in vivo diagnosis of 
gastroduodenal Helicobacter pylori infection: 
- 
- 
- 
for the evalutation of the success of eradication treatment, or, 
when invasive tests cannot be performed, or 
when there are discordant results arising from invasive tests. 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This medicinal product should be administered by a healthcare professional and under appropriate 
medical supervision. 
Posology 
Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 is a breath test for single administration. 
Children from the age of 3 to 11 must take the contents of 1 jar with 45 mg. 
Method of administration 
For performance of the test, 100 ml 100 % orange juice for patients from the age of 3 to 11 (as a pre-
administered test meal), as well as tap water (for dissolving the 13C-urea powder) are necessary. 
The patient must have fasted for over 6 hours, preferably overnight. The test procedure takes 
approximately 40 minutes. 
In case it is necessary to repeat the test procedure, this should not be done until the following day. 
The suppression of Helicobacter pylori might give false negative results. Therefore the test shall be 
used after at least four weeks without systemic antibacterial therapy and two weeks after last dose of 
acid antisecretory agents. Both might interfere with the Helicobacter pylori status. This is especially 
important after Helicobacter eradication therapy. 
It is important to follow the instructions for use adequately (see section 6.6), otherwise the reliability 
of the outcome will become questionable.

4.3  Contraindications 
The test must not be used in patients with documented or suspected gastric infection or atrophic 
gastritis, which might interfere with the urea breath test (see section 4.2). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
A positive test alone does not constitute indication for eradication therapy. Differential diagnosis with 
invasive endoscopic methods might be indicated in order to examine the presence of any other 
complicating conditions, e.g. ulcer, autoimmune gastritis and malignancies. 
There is insufficient data on the diagnostic liability of the Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the 
age 3-11 to recommend its use in patients with gastrectomy and in patients younger than 3 years of 
age. 
In individual cases of A-gastritis (atrophic gastritis) the breath test may have false positive results; 
other tests may be required to confirm the Helicobacter pylori status. 
If the patient vomits during the test procedure, necessitating the repetition of the test, this should be 
done in fasted condition and not before the following day (see section 4.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 will be affected by all treatments interfering with 
Helicobacter pylori status or urease activity. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Not applicable. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
None. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
None known. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Due to the fact that only 45 mg of 13C-urea is delivered, an overdose is not expected. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other diagnostic agents, ATC code: VO4CX 
For the amount of 45 mg 13C-urea, which is administered per unit in the course of the breath test, no 
pharmacodynamic activity is described.

After oral ingestion the labelled urea reaches the gastric mucosa. In the presence of Helicobacter 
pylori the 13C-urea is metabolised by the enzyme urease of Helicobacter pylori. 
2H2N(13CO)NH2 + 2H2O     Enzyme urease      4NH3 + 213CO2 
The carbon dioxide diffuses into the blood vessels. From there it is transported as bicarbonate into the 
lung and liberated as 13CO2 with the exhaled air. 
In the presence of bacterial urease the ratio of the 13C/12C-carbon isotopes is significantly changed. 
The portion of 13CO2 in the breath samples is determined by isotope-ratio-mass-spectrometry (IRMS) 
and stated as an absolute difference (-value) between the 00-minute- and the 30-minute-values. 
Urease is produced in the stomach only by Helicobacter pylori. Other urease producing bacteria were 
seldom found in the gastric flora. 
The cut off point for discriminating Helicobacter pylori-negative and positive patients is determined to 
be -value of 4 ‰, which means that an increase of the -value by more than 4 ‰ indicates an 
infection. In comparison to bioptic diagnostics of an infection with Helicobacter pylori, the breath test 
achieved in a clinical trial on 168 patients from the age of 3 to 11, a sensitivity of 98.4 % [90 %-CI: 
≥ 93.9 %], and a specificity of 98.1 % [90 %-CI: ≥ 95.1 %]. 
In the absence of bacterial urease, the whole amount of the administered urea after absorption from the 
gastrointestinal tract will be metabolised like the endogenous urea. Ammonia which is produced as 
described above by the bacterial hydrolysis is included into the metabolism as NH4
+. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The orally applied 13C-urea is metabolised to carbon dioxide and ammonia or is integrated into the 
body’s own urea cycle. Any increase in 13CO2 will be measured by isotopic analysis. 
Absorption and distribution of 13CO2 is faster than the urease reaction. Therefore, the rate-limiting step 
in the whole process is the cleavage of 13C-urea by Helicobacter's urease. 
Only in Helicobacter pylori- positive patients does the administration of 45 mg labelled urea lead to a 
significant increase of 13CO2 in the breath sample within the first 30 minutes. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No concerns in relation to the clinical use of the product.

The test is to be performed in the presence of a qualified person. 
Each patient should be documented according to the provided data sheet. It is recommended to 
perform the test with the patient being in a resting position. 
The test starts with the collection of samples for the determination of baseline-value (00-minute-
value): 
• 
Take the straw and the two sample tubes with the label 
“Sampling time: 00-minute-value” out of the test set. 
Remove the stopper from one of the sample tubes, unwrap the straw and place the straw 
into the container. 
Now the patient breathes gently through the straw until the inner surface of the sample 
tube steams up. 
By continuously breathing the patient must pull out the straw and immediately close the 
sample tube with its stopper. 
(If the sample tube remains open for more than 30 seconds, the test result might be 
falsified.) 
Hold the sample tube upright and stick the bar-code label marked “00-minute-value” 
round the sample tube, so that the lines of the bar-code are horizontal. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Fill up the second sample tube (Label “Sampling time: 00-minute-value”) with breath by 
following the same procedure. 
Now 100 ml of 100 % orange juice must be drunk by the patient without delay. 
Now the preparation of the test solution follows: 
• 
The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is taken from the test set, opened, and filled up to 
three quarters of its volume with tap water. 
Close the jar and shake it carefully until all the powder is dissolved. Pour the contents 
into a drinking glass. 
Fill the 13C-urea jar to the brim with water for a second and third time and add these 
contents to the drinking glass (total volume of tap water should be approximately 30 ml). 
• 
• 
This test solution must now be drunk immediately by the patient, and the time of application 
must be noted. 
Thirty minutes after administration of the test solution (point 7), collect the 30-minute-value 
samples in the two containers which are left in the test package (Label “Sampling time: 
30-minute-value”), as described under steps 3 to 4. Use the bar-code labels marked “30-minute-
value” for these samples.

9. 
Put the relevant bar-code label on the data sheet for patient documentation. Finally seal the 
package with the sticker. 
10.  The sample tubes have to be sent in the original packaging, for analysis, to a qualified 
laboratory. 
Analysis of breath samples and testing specification for laboratories 
The breath samples, collected in 10 ml glass- or plastic sample tubes, are analysed by isotope ratio 
mass spectrometry (IRMS). 
The analysis of the 13C/12C-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test 
Helicobacter Test INFAI. The accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath 
analysis. The specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity, stability (reference gas 
precision), and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system. 
It has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory. The method validated in 
the application is as follows: 
• 
Sample preparation for (IRMS) 
To determine the 13C/12C-ratio of carbon dioxide in breath by mass spectrometric analysis the carbon 
dioxide must be separated from the breath and introduced into the mass spectrometer. The automatic 
preparation system for isotope mass spectrometers which is dedicated for breath test analysis is based 
on a gas-chromatographic continuous flow separation technique. 
Water is removed from the sample by means of a Nafion water trap or the gas-chromatographic 
preparation system that separates the individual gases in a gas chromatographic column with Helium 
as eluent. Passing the column the separated gas species of breath are detected by an ionisation 
detector. The fraction of carbon dioxide gas, identified by its characteristic retention time, is 
introduced into mass spectrometer. 
• 
Mass spectrometric analysis 
To analyse the separated carbon dioxide sample gas its molecules must be ionised, formed into a 
beam, accelerated by an electric field, deflected in a magnetic field, and finally detected. These five 
processes take place in the analyser of a mass spectrometer, which consists of three separate sections: 
the source, flight tube, and collector. Ionisation, beam formation and acceleration all occur in the 
source, magnetic deflection takes place in the flight tube and detection takes place in the collector. 
• 
Sample inlet 
For introduction of the carbon dioxide into the analyser many sample inlet systems are available. For 
breath test analysis the individual balancing of the carbon dioxide of the sample to a reference 
standard gas is essential. This ensures the high accuracy of this system, as calculation of the isotopic 
content in carbon dioxide is done with respect to an independent standard. 
• 
Specifications for determining 13C/12C-ratios 
The breath test concept relies on the administration of a specifically 13C-labelled urea whose 
metabolite utilisation is monitored by measuring 13CO2 in the expired breath gas.  
• 
The mass spectrometer must be capable of: 
Multiple replicate analyses:  Minimum of 3 replicate analyses of the same sample during operation 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Security access: 
Storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to 
avoid later manipulation 
Adjustment: 
13C/12C-ratio with respect to Pee Dee Beliminate (PDB) 
Sample loop: 
< 200 µl 
The principal tests to verify the specifications are linearity, stability (reference gas precision), and 
precision of measurement. 
• 
All mass spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications: 
Linearity: 
 0.5 ‰ for breath samples varying between 1 % and 7 % 
CO2-concentration 
Stability: 
 0.2 ‰ on 10 consecutive pulses 
Precision of measurement: 
 0.3 ‰ for 13C at natural abundance using a 10 ml breath sample tube 
with 3 % CO2 breath concentration 
Helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13C/12C of baseline-value and 30-minute-
value exceeds 4.0 ‰. 
Alternatively, any other suitable-validated method may be used, carried out by any objectively 
qualified laboratory.

Helicobacter Test INFAI. The accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath 
analysis. The specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity, stability (reference gas 
precision), and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system. 
It has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory. It is recommended to 
measure as soon as possible after the breath collection, in any case not later than 4 weeks. 
The method validated in the application is as follows: 
• 
Sample preparation for Infrared Spectroscopy (NDIR) 
The determination of 13C/12C-ratio in the carbon dioxide of the breath samples is carried out directly in 
the breath. The breath from the bags will be introduced into the NDIR spectrometer using a variable 
gas pump. The water content of the breath sample will be kept mostly constant through Nafion water 
trap. For calibration and measurement necessary CO2-free air (zero-gas) will be produced via an 
integrated CO2-absorber in the analysator. 
• 
Infrared spectroscopic analysis 
To analyse the carbon dioxide in breath a broad band infrared radiation bunch emitted by an infrared 
radiation source is alternately sent through the measuring chamber and a reference chamber by means 
of a beam chopper. The modulated infrared beams then enter the infrared detectors, which are double 
layer transmission detectors with a front, and a rear chamber each filled with one of the isotopicly pure 
gases (13CO2 or 12CO2, respectively) to be measured. The infrared radiation in the measuring chamber 
is weakened by the gas component to be measured. Thus the radiation equilibrium between measuring 
and comparative beam is disturbed. In consequence there is a temperature fluctuation, which in its turn 
causes a fluctuating pressure in the front chamber of the infrared detector. A membrane capacitor 
connected with this chamber, which is exposed to a high resistance direct voltage, transforms these 
pressure fluctuations into an alternating voltage, which is a measure of the isotopic composition of 
breath carbon dioxide. 
• 
Sample Inlet 
A semi-automatic sample inlet system injects the measuring gas in definite amounts into the zero gas 
circulating in the gas circuit of the infrared spectrometer. This enables measurement of the 
13C/12C-ratio at any CO2 concentration above 1 %. 
• 
Specifications for determining 13C/12C-ratios 
The breath test concept is based upon the oral administration of 13C-labelled urea whose enzymatic 
hydrolysis is monitored by measuring 13CO2 in breath using non-dispersive infrared spectrometry. 
• 
Infrared spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications: 
Multiple replicate analyses:  Minimum of 3 replicate analyses of the same sample during operation 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Security access: 
Storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to 
avoid later manipulation 
For verifying the specifications linearity, stability, and precision of measurement have to be tested. 
Zero point adjustment of the detectors by means of the zero gas generated in the spectrometer. End-
point adjustment of the detectors by means of calibration gases of precisely known concentration. 
Linearity: 
 0.5 ‰ for breath samples varying between 1 % and 7 % 
CO2-concentration 
Stability: 
 0.3 ‰ at 10 consecutive pulses 
Precision of measurement: 
 0.5 ‰ for 13C at natural abundance using a 100 ml breath bag with 
3 % CO2 breath concentration 
Helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13C/12C of baseline-value and 30-minute-
value exceeds 4.0 ‰. 
Alternatively, any other suitable-validated method may be used, carried out by any objectively 
qualified laboratory. 
Mass spectrometry (IRMS) 
The breath samples, collected in 10 ml glass- or plastic sample tubes, are analysed by isotope ratio 
mass spectrometry (IRMS). 
The analysis of the 13C/12C-ratio in carbon dioxide of breath is an integrated part of the diagnostic test 
Helicobacter Test INFAI. The accuracy of the test strongly depends on the quality of the breath 
analysis. The specification of breath analysis parameters like linearity, stability (reference gas 
precision), and precision of measurement are fundamental for the accuracy of the system. 
It has to be ensured that the analysis is carried out by a qualified laboratory. The method validated in 
the application is as follows: 
• 
Sample preparation for (IRMS) 
To determine the 13C/12C-ratio of carbon dioxide in breath by mass spectrometric analysis the carbon 
dioxide must be separated from the breath and introduced into the mass spectrometer. The automatic 
preparation system for isotope mass spectrometers which is dedicated for breath test analysis is based 
on a gas-chromatographic continuous flow separation technique. 
Water is removed from the sample by means of a Nafion water trap or the gas-chromatographic 
preparation system that separates the individual gases in a gas chromatographic column with Helium 
as eluent. Passing the column the separated gas species of breath are detected by an ionisation 
detector. The fraction of carbon dioxide gas, identified by its characteristic retention time, is 
introduced into mass spectrometer. 
• 
Mass spectrometric analysis 
To analyse the separated carbon dioxide sample gas its molecules must be ionised, formed into a 
beam, accelerated by an electric field, deflected in a magnetic field, and finally detected. These five 
processes take place in the analyser of a mass spectrometer, which consists of three separate sections: 
the source, flight tube, and collector. Ionisation, beam formation and acceleration all occur in the 
source, magnetic deflection takes place in the flight tube and detection takes place in the collector. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Sample inlet 
For introduction of the carbon dioxide into the analyser many sample inlet systems are available. For 
breath test analysis the individual balancing of the carbon dioxide of the sample to a reference 
standard gas is essential. This ensures the high accuracy of this system, as calculation of the isotopic 
content in carbon dioxide is done with respect to an independent standard. 
• 
Specifications for determining 13C/12C-ratios  
The breath test concept relies on the administration of a specifically 13C-labelled urea whose 
metabolite utilisation is monitored by measuring 13CO2 in the expired breath gas. 
• 
The mass spectrometer must be capable of: 
Multiple replicate analyses:  Minimum of 3 replicate analyses of the same sample during operation 
Security access: 
Storing of operating parameters and of results under security access to 
avoid later manipulation 
Adjustment: 
13C/12C-ratio with respect to Pee Dee Beliminate (PDB) 
Sample loop: 
< 200 µl 
The principal tests to verify the specifications are linearity, stability (reference gas precision), and 
precision of measurement. 
• 
All mass spectrometers for breath analysis must comply with the following specifications: 
Linearity: 
 0.5 ‰ for breath samples varying between 1 % and 7 % 
CO2-concentration 
Stability: 
 0.2 ‰ on 10 consecutive pulses 
Precision of measurement: 
 0.3 ‰ for 13C at natural abundance using a 10 ml breath sample tube 
with 3 % CO2 breath concentration 
Helicobacter pylori infection is present if the difference in 13C/12C of baseline-value and 30-minute-
value exceeds 4.0 ‰. 
Alternatively, any other suitable-validated method may be used, carried out by any objectively 
qualified laboratory.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Helicobacter Test INFAI is and what it is used for 
Helicobacter Test INFAI is for diagnostic use only. It is a breath test for adolescents from the age 
of 12 and adults to determine the presence of bacterium Helicobacter pylori in the stomach. 
Why do you need to take the Helicobacter Test INFAI? 
You may have a gastric infection caused by a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Your doctor has 
recommended that you have a Helicobacter Test INFAI for one of the following reasons: 
➢  Your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from Helicobacter pylori infection to 
help diagnose your condition. 
➢  You have already been determined as being infected with Helicobacter pylori and have been 
taking medication aimed to clear up the infection. Your doctor now wishes to find out if the 
treatment has been successful. 
How does the test work? 
All foods contain a substance called carbon-13 (13C). This carbon-13 can be detected in the carbon 
dioxide you breathe out of your lungs. The actual amount of carbon-13 in the breath will depend on 
the kind of food that you have eaten. 
You will be asked to drink the “test meal”. Following the meal, samples of your breath will be taken. 
See “Special instructions for use”. These samples will be analysed to measure the “normal” amount of 
carbon-13 content in the carbon dioxide in your breath. 
You will then be asked to drink a solution of carbon-13-urea. Further samples of your breath will then 
be taken 30 minutes later and the amount of carbon-13 in the samples measured as before. The results 
will be compared and a significant increase in the amount of carbon-13 in the second set of samples 
will suggest to your doctor that Helicobacter pylori is present.

2.  What you need to know before you take Helicobacter Test INFAI 
Do not take Helicobacter Test INFAI 
• 
if you have or suspect that you have a stomach infection or a certain inflammation of the 
stomach lining (atrophic gastritis). 
This inflammation of the stomach lining may cause incorrect positive results of your breath test. 
Further investigations may be required to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Helicobacter Test INFAI if you have any condition 
that can affect or be affected by the test. 
Even if the result of Helicobacter Test INFAI is positive, further tests might be necessary before a 
treatment of a Helicobacter pylori infection may be started. These are required to check for the 
presence of any other complications, such as: 
• 
• 
• 
stomach ulcer 
inflammation of the stomach lining caused by immune system 
tumours 
There is insufficient data on the reliability of the Helicobacter Test INFAI for recommending its use in 
patients with removal of parts of the stomach. 
If the patient vomits during the test procedure, repetition of the test is necessary. This should be done 
in fasted condition and not before the following day. 
Other medicines and Helicobacter Test INFAI 
Helicobacter Test INFAI is influenced by medicines influencing  
• 
• 
Helicobacter pylori (see section 3, second paragraph under “Method of use”) 
the enzyme urease, which stimulate the reduction of urea 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
It is not expected that performing the breath test during pregnancy and lactation has a damaging effect. 
Driving and using machines 
Helicobacter Test INFAI has no influence on the ability to drive or to use machines. 
3. 
How to take Helicobacter Test INFAI 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
You should perform the test in the presence of your doctor or another qualified person. 
The recommended dose is 
Patients from the age of 12 must take the content of one jar for one test. 
Method of use 
You must have fasted for 6 hours before application, preferably overnight. Ask your doctor, if fasting 
is a problem, for example for diabetic patients. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The test procedure lasts approximately 40 minutes. 
4 weeks after a therapy against a bacterial infection  
2 weeks after the last administration of a medicine to reduce release of stomach acid 
The test should be performed following at least: 
• 
• 
Both groups of medicines could influence the results of the Helicobacter Test INFAI. This is 
particularly after a therapy to remove Helicobacter pylori. It is important to follow the instructions for 
use exactly, otherwise the result may be questionable. 
Essential items not supplied with Helicobacter Test INFAI 
Before the breath test is performed a liquid test meal is taken to delay the stomach from emptying. The 
test meal is not provided within the kit. The following are suitable test meals: 
• 
• 
If you cannot take either of these test meals, please tell your doctor, who will suggest an alternative. A 
drinking vessel and tap water is required to dissolve the 13C-urea powder. If the test needs to be 
repeated, this should be done on the following day at the earliest. 
200 ml 100 % orange juice or 
1 g citric acid dissolved in 200 ml water 
Special instructions for use (for mass spectrometry) 
The test is to be performed after instruction by a healthcare professional and under appropriate 
medical supervision. The patient data should be documented using the provided data sheet. It is 
recommended that you take the test in a resting position.

7. 
The test should be carried out after having fasted 6 hours before application, preferably 
overnight. If the test needs to be carried out later in the day, only a light meal like tea and toast 
is recommended. 
The test begins with the collection of samples for determining the baseline values: 
• 
The straw and sample tubes labelled “sampling time: 00-minute-value” are taken from the 
test set. 
The stopper is removed from one of the sample containers and place the unwrapped straw 
into the container. 
Now the patient breathes gently through the straw into the sample tube until the inside of 
the sample tube steams up. 
The patient must continue to breathe through the straw while removing it from the sample 
tube, and then immediately seal the tube with its stopper. 
If the sample tube remains open for more than 30 seconds, the result could be inaccurate. 
The sample container should be held upright and the bar-code label marked “00-minute-
value” will be stuck round the sample container so that the lines of the bar code are 
horizontal. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Now the second sample container (labelled “sampling time: 00-minute-value”) has to be filled 
up with breath in the same way as described above. 
Then the patient must drink the recommended test meal (200 ml 100 % orange juice or 1 g citric 
acid in 200 ml water). 
Now the preparation of the test solution follows. 
• 
The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is removed from the test set, opened, and filled up to 
about three quarters with tap water. 
The jar is closed and carefully shaken until all the powder has dissolved completely. 
The contents are poured into a drinking glass, the jar filled a second and third time with 
water and the contents transferred into the drinking glass, so that approximately 30 ml of 
test solution is obtained. 
• 
• 
The patient should drink this test solution immediately. The time of intake must be noted. 
30 minutes after the test solution has been taken (point 6), the “30-minute-value” samples are 
collected in both containers, which remain in the pack (labelled “sampling time: 30-minute-
value”) as described under points 2 and 3. 
The bar-code labels marked “30-minute-value” must be used for these samples. 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
8. 
9. 
The corresponding bar-code label must be put on the data sheet for patient documentation. All 
breath sample containers should be placed back into the original packaging. This packaging 
should be sealed with the remaining sticker. 
The package must be sent to a qualified laboratory for analysis. 
Medical or healthcare professionals can find detailed information on the analysis of breath samples and 
the testing specifications for laboratories, in section 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
If you take more Helicobacter Test INFAI than you should 
Because only 75 mg 13C-urea is provided overdose is not to be expected. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

1.  What Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3 to 11 is and what it is used for 
Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 is for diagnostic use only. It is a breath test for 
children aged 3-11 years to determine the presence of bacterium Helicobacter pylori in the 
stomach or duodenum. 
Why do you need to take the Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11? 
You may have a gastric or duodenum infection caused by a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Your 
doctor has recommended that you have a Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 for one 
of the following reasons: 
➢  Your doctor wants to confirm whether you are suffering from Helicobacter pylori infection to 
help diagnose your condition. 
➢  You have already been determined as being infected with Helicobacter pylori and have been 
taking medication aimed to clear up the infection. Your doctor now wishes to find out if the 
treatment has been successful. 
How does the test work? 
All foods contain a substance called carbon-13 (13C). This carbon-13 can be detected in the carbon 
dioxide you breathe out of your lungs. The actual amount of carbon-13 in the breath will depend on 
the kind of food that you have eaten. 
You will be asked to drink the “test meal”. Following the meal, samples of your breath will be taken. 
See “Special instructions for use”. These samples will be analysed to measure the “normal” amount of 
carbon-13 content in the carbon dioxide in your breath. 
You will then be asked to drink a solution of carbon-13-urea. Further samples of your breath will then 
be taken 30 minutes later and the amount of carbon-13 in the samples measured as before. The results 
will be compared and a significant increase in the amount of carbon-13 in the second set of samples 
will suggest to your doctor that Helicobacter pylori is present.

2.  What you need to know before you take Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the 
age 3-11 
Do not take Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 
• 
if you have or suspect that you have a stomach infection or a certain inflammation of the 
stomach lining (atrophic gastritis). 
This inflammation of the stomach lining may cause incorrect positive results of your breath test. 
Further investigations may be required to confirm the presence of Helicobacter pylori. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 
if you have any condition that can affect or be affected by the test. 
Even if the result of Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 is positive, further tests 
might be necessary before a treatment of a Helicobacter pylori infection may be started. These are 
required to check for the presence of any other complications, such as: 
• 
• 
• 
stomach ulcer 
inflammation of the stomach lining caused by immune system 
tumours 
There is insufficient data on the reliability of the Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 
for recommending its use in patients with removal of parts of the stomach. 
If the patient vomits during the test procedure, repetition of the test is necessary. This should be done 
in fasted condition and not before the following day. 
Other medicines and Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 
Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 is influenced by medicines influencing 
• 
• 
Helicobacter pylori (see section 3, second paragraph under “Method of use”) 
the enzyme urease, which stimulate the reduction of urea 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
3. 
How to take Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
You should perform the test in the presence of your doctor or another qualified person. 
The recommended dose is 
Children aged 3-11 years must take the content of one jar for one test. 
Method of use 
You must have fasted for 6 hours before application, preferably overnight. Ask your doctor, if fasting 
is a problem, for example for diabetic patients. 
The test procedure lasts approximately 40 minutes. 
The test should be performed following at least: 
• 
• 
4 weeks after a therapy against a bacterial infection  
2 weeks after the last administration of a medicine to reduce release of stomach acid 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both groups of medicines could influence the results of the Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of 
the age 3-11. This is particularly after a therapy to remove Helicobacter pylori. It is important to 
follow the instructions for use exactly, otherwise the result may be questionable. 
Essential items not supplied with Helicobacter Test INFAI for children of the age 3-11 
Before the breath test is performed a liquid test meal is taken to delay the stomach from emptying. The 
test meal is not provided within the kit. The following is a suitable test meal: 
• 
If you cannot take this test meal, please tell your doctor, who will suggest an alternative. A drinking 
vessel and tap water is required to dissolve the 13C-urea powder. If the test needs to be repeated, this 
should be done on the following day at the earliest. 
100 ml 100 % orange juice 
Special instructions for use (for mass spectrometry) 
The test is to be performed after instruction by a healthcare professional and under appropriate 
medical supervision. The patient data should be documented using the provided data sheet. It is 
recommended that you take the test in a resting position.

The test should be carried out after having fasted 6 hours before application, preferably 
overnight. If the test needs to be carried out later in the day, only a light meal like tea and toast 
is recommended. 
The test begins with the collection of samples for determining the baseline values: 
• 
The straw and sample tubes labelled “sampling time: 00-minute-value” are taken from the 
test set. 
The stopper is removed from one of the sample containers and place the unwrapped straw 
into the container. 
Now the patient breathes gently through the straw into the sample tube until the inside of 
the sample tube steams up. 
The patient must continue to breathe through the straw while removing it from the sample 
tube, and then immediately seal the tube with its stopper. 
If the sample tube remains open for more than 30 seconds, the result could be inaccurate. 
The sample container should be held upright and the bar-code label marked “00-minute-
value” will be stuck round the sample container so that the lines of the bar code are 
horizontal. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Now the second sample container (labelled “sampling time: 00-minute-value”) has to be filled 
up with breath in the same way as described above. 
Then the patient must drink the recommended test meal (100 ml 100 % orange juice). 
Now the preparation of the test solution follows. 
• 
The jar labelled “13C-urea powder” is removed from the test set, opened, and filled up to 
about three quarters with tap water. 
The jar is closed and carefully shaken until all the powder has dissolved completely. 
The contents are poured into a drinking glass, the jar filled a second and third time with 
water and the contents transferred into the drinking glass, so that approximately 30 ml of 
test solution is obtained. 
• 
• 
The patient should drink this test solution immediately. The time of intake must be noted. 
30 minutes after the test solution has been taken (point 6), the “30-minute-value” samples are 
collected in both containers, which remain in the pack (labelled “sampling time: 30-minute-
value”) as described under points 2 and 3. 
The bar-code labels marked “30-minute-value” must be used for these samples. 
The corresponding bar-code label must be put on the data sheet for patient documentation. All 
breath sample containers should be placed back into the original packaging. This packaging 
should be sealed with the remaining sticker. 
The package must be sent to a qualified laboratory for analysis. 
Medical or healthcare professionals can find detailed information on the analysis of breath samples and 
the testing specifications for laboratories, in section 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ibrutinib, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on Acute kidney injury, which includes observed disproportionality from 
clinical trials, available number of spontaneous cases with two cases reporting both positive 
dechallenge and rechallenge, additional cases described in literature and plausible mechanism via 
VEGF inhibition also described in literature, the PRAC considers causal relationship between ibrutinib 
and Acute kidney injury to be at least reasonable possibility.  
In view of available data on Pyogenic granuloma from the literature, and spontaneous reports including 
in four cases a positive de-challenge and in view of a suggested mechanism of action through off-
target influence of ibrutinib, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between ibrutinib and Pyogenic 
granuloma is at least a reasonable possibility. 
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing ibrutinib should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ibrutinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ibrutinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Fingolimod1 (Gilenya) is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. Fingolimod is metabolised by 
sphingosine kinase to the active metabolite fingolimod phosphate. Fingolimod phosphate, binds at low 
nanomolar  concentrations  to  sphingosine  1-phosphate  (S1P)  receptors  1,  3,  and  4  located  on 
lymphocytes, and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to bind to S1P receptors 1, 3, and 5 located 
on neural cells in the central nervous system. By acting as a functional antagonist of S1P receptors on 
lymphocytes,  fingolimod  phosphate  blocks  the  capacity  of  lymphocytes  to  egress  from  lymph  nodes, 
causing a redistribution, rather than depletion, of lymphocytes. This redistribution is claimed to reduce 
the  infiltration  of  pathogenic  lymphocyte  cells  into  the  central  nervous  system,  where  they  would  be 
involved in nerve inflammation and nervous tissue damage.  
The following indication is initially applied for: disease-modifying therapy in adults for the treatment of 
patients  with  relapsing  multiple  sclerosis  to  reduce  the  frequency  of  relapses  and  to  delay  the 
progression of disability. 
The recommended dose of Gilenya is one 0.5 mg capsule taken orally once daily.  
Multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  is  a  chronic,  autoimmune  and  neurodegenerative  disorder  of  the  central 
nervous  system  (CNS),  characterized  by  inflammation,  demyelination,  oligodendrocyte  and  neuronal 
loss. MS represents the leading cause of non-traumatic neurologic disability in young and middle-aged 
adults  and  has  a  major  physical,  psychological,  social  and  financial  impact  on  patients  and  their 
families,  friends  and  institutions  responsible  for  health  care.  MS  affects  an  estimated  2.5  million 
individuals worldwide. The prevalence varies considerably, from regions with low prevalence (< 5 cases 
per 100 000 people) across much of central Asia, to areas with high prevalence (greater than 30 cases 
per 100 000 people) across the USA, Canada, Australia and large parts of Europe and northern Asia. 
The classification of MS into 4 distinct clinical categories was suggested by Lublin and Reingold shortly 
after the availability of the first disease-modifying treatments as a means to aid physicians in providing 
care. The following categories were included: relapsing-remitting (RR) MS, with clearly defined disease 
relapses  (clinical  attacks)  with  full  recovery  or  with  sequelae  and  residual  deficit  upon  recovery,  and 
with  periods between  relapses  characterized  by  a lack  of  disease  progression;  secondary–progressive 
(SP) MS, with continuous neurological decline with or without superimposed re lapses, that follows an 
initial  period  of  RR  disease;Primary–progressive  (PP)  MS,  characterized  by  a  slow  worsening  from 
onset,  without  superimposed  relapses;  and  progressive–relapsing  (PR)  MS,  indicating  slow  worsening 
from the onset, but with superimposed relapse events as well. 
Relapsing  MS  is  the  most  frequent  clinical  presentation  of  the  disease.  The  majority  of  patients  are 
females  (2:1  female  to  male  ratio)  diagnosed  between  the  ages  of  20  and  40.  At  diagnosis, 
approximately 85% of patients have relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), characterized by recurrent acute 
exacerbations (relapses) of neurological dysfunction followed by recovery. A significant proportion (42 
-  57%)  of  relapses  may  result  in  incomplete  recovery  of  function  and  leave  permanent  disability  and 
impairment.  After  6  -  10  years,  30  -  40%  of  patients  with  RRMS  have  progressed  to  secondary 
progressive  MS  (SPMS),  in  which  a  less  inflammatory  and  more  neurodegenerative  course  of  the 
disease  take  over.  SPMS  presents  with  steady  progression  in  disability  with  or  without  superimposed 
relapses.

Currently, no oral medication is approved for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. All available 
disease modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis are administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly or 
intravenously. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Composition 
Gilenia  is  presented  as  immediate-release  hard  gelatin  capsules  containing  0.56  mg  of  fingolimod 
hydrochloride as the active substance corresponding to 0.5 mg of fingolimod base.  Other ingredients 
include mannitol and magnesium stearate.  
The  proposed  formulation  is  a  white  to  almost  white  powder  filled  in  a  hard  gelatin  capsule  (size  3) 
with white  opaque  body,  bright  yellow  opaque  cap, radial imprint  with  black  ink  “FTY  0.5 mg”  on  the 
cap and two radial bands imprinted on the body with yellow ink. The capsules are packed in PVC/PVDC 
blister packs. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance  
Fingolimod  is  a  sphingosine-1-phosphate  receptor  modulator.  In  the  body,  fingolimod  is  metabolized 
by sphingosine kinase to the active metabolite fingolimod phosphate. 
Fingolimod  hydrochloride  has  not  been  previously  authorised  in  a  medicinal  product  registered  in  EU 
and  therefore  is  considered  to  be  a  new  chemical  entity  (NCE).  Neither  fingolimod  nor  the 
hydrochloride salt is described in Ph. Eur. and/ or USP. 
The chemical name of fingolimod hydrochloride is 2-Amino-2-(2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl)propan-1,3-diol 
hydrochloride and its molecular structure is presented in the figure below. 
It is a white to practically white powder.  The salt form of fingolimod is freely soluble in water and pH 
1.0 buffer, very slightly soluble in pH 4.0 buffer and practically insoluble in pH 6.8 buffer. This 
solubility profile can be seen as normal for a salt of a primary amine of relatively low molecular mass. 
Fingolimod  is  not  a  chiral  molecule  and  therefore  does  not  show  any  specific  rotation.  However, 
fingolimod  hydrochloride  exhibits  polymorphism.  The  active  substance  used  for  Gilenia  is  the 
polymorphic form I which is stable under the storage conditions specified in the SmPC and is routinely 
controlled in the specifications. 
Manufacture 
The manufacturing process of fingolimod hydrochloride consists of multi-step chemical synthesis and 
uses simple molecules as starting materials.

The levels of the specified impurities are supported by the results of toxicological studies and the 
solvents used in the synthesis have been shown to be efficiently removed during the purification and 
drying operations. Appropriate specifications have been set. 
Batch analysis results from 30 batches demonstrate that the route of synthesis is capable of reproducibly 
producing an active substance of the intended quality.  
The bulk drug substance fingolimod hydrochloride is primarily packed either in sealed triple laminated 
foil  bags  (polyethylene  /  aluminium  /  polyethylene  terephthalate)  or  in  quadruple  laminated  foil  bags 
(polyethylene / polyethylene terephthalate / aluminium / polyethylene terephthalate).  
The polyethylene material in contact with the active substance meets the requirements of monograph 
“Polyolefines”  in  the  current  Ph.Eur.3.1.3.  The  laminate  packaging  material  complies  with  the 
requirements of the EU Directive 2002/72/EC including later amendments. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  particle  size  (laser  diffraction) 
identification  (IR,X-ray  diffraction),  assay  (HPLC),  related  impurities  (HPLC,),  residual  solvents  (GC), 
loss on drying (Ph. Eur), heavy metals (ICP-OES) and microbial enumeration (plate count).    
An  adequate  justification  has  been  provided  for  the  choice  of  specification  limits  and  analytical  test 
methods.  The  acceptance  criteria  regarding  related  substances  are  either  in  line  with  toxicological 
batches results or with ICH Q3A, the residual solvents limits are in line with Q3C (R3) and the metal 
catalysts limits are in line with the EU Note for Guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4446/2000.  
Batch analysis results for over than 30 batches manufactured according to the intended for commercial 
manufacture route of synthesis comply with the set specifications. 
Stability 
Stability studies have been performed with three batches manufactured with the synthetic route 
intended for commercial production and packaged in either triple laminated foils or amber glass bottles 
with PP screw caps used for accelerated testing, shipping of small samples and reference. Samples 
have been stored in accordance to ICH Guidelines for up to 60 months at 25 oC/60% RH, 30 oC/65% 
RH and for 6 months at 40 oC/75% RH, 20 oC and 5 oC.  
The parameters tested included appearance by visual examination, identification by IR and X-ray 
diffraction, related substances by HPLC, loss on drying, clarity and colour of the solution and assay by 
HPLC. The analytical methods used were validated and stability indicating. In all cases the results met 
the predefined specifications. 
Photostability studies were conducted in one batch showing no discolouration or degradation. Results 
from stress tests showed no evidence of degradation.  
The results of the stability studies show that the active substance is very stable and a re-test period of 
5 years was granted when stored either in sealed triple laminated foil bags (polyethylene / aluminium / 
polyethylene  terephthalate)  or  in  quadruple  laminated  foil  bags  (polyethylene  /  polyethylene 
terephthalate / aluminium / polyethylene terephthalate).

The active substance is a micronised hydrochloride salt of fingolimod. The free base and ten different 
salts were evaluated for stability, solubility and morphic properties during development and the 
hydrochloric salt was chosen due to superior solubility and stability properties in a standard excipient 
mixture.  
The excipients were chosen based on compatibility studies and experience from development of similar 
formulations. The compatibility studies showed that the active substance interacts with several 
excipients. Mannitol was chosen as a filler due to the optimum degradation profile. It was also 
considered that the probability of producing a stable product was higher when developing a capsule as 
compared to a tablet. Therefore a hard capsule formulation was developed 
A standard direct blending was chosen for the manufacture of the capsule fill. In order to ensure 
content uniformity the active substance is micronised. 
Adventitious agents 
The gelatin in the capsules is of animal origin and meets the requirements of Ph. Eur. TSE issues for 
gelatin were addressed by submission of TSE CEPs. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is a standard process for these kind of formulations.  
All critical process parameters have  been identified and controlled by appropriate in process controls. 
The  validation  report  from  three  production  scale  batches  demonstrates  that  the  process  is 
reproducible  and  provides  a  drug  product  that  complies  with  the  in-process  and  finished  product 
specifications. 
Product Specification  
The specification for the finished product at release and shelf life includes tests for appearance, 
identification (TLC and HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), Dissolution, uniformity of 
dosage units (content uniformity by HPLC) and microbial enumeration (plate count method) 
All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. 
Batch analysis data from 3 stability and 3 process validation batches have been presented. All batches 
met the test limits as defined in the release specification and test methodology valid at the time of 
batch release. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  were  carried  out  on  3  production  scale  batches  of  tablets  according  to  the  ICH 
requirements. Samples were stored at 25oC/60 % RH and 30oC/75 % RH for up to 24 months and in 
40oC/75 % RH for 6 months.  
The parameters tested included appearance, dissolution (HPLC), assay and related substances (HPLC) 
and microbial limit tests using stability indicating analytical methods. 
In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the 
commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Gilenia is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical 
documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from EU 
and ICH requirements. 
The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  excipients  are  commonly  used  in 
these  types  of  formulations  and  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  The  packaging  material  is 
commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing process of the finished product is a standard

process  that  has  been  adequately  described.  Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH 
guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  At  the 
time  of  the CHMP  opinion,  there  was  a  minor  unresolved  quality issue  having  no impact  on  the  Risk-
benefit  balance  of  the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and  committed  to  resolve 
this  as  Follow  Up  Measure  after  the  opinion,  within  an  agreed  timeframe.  There  are  no  unresolved 
quality issues, which could have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
All  main  safety  pharmacology  and  pivotal  toxicology  studies  were  performed  according  to  Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP), as stated by the applicant. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Fingolimod (FTY720) has been evaluated in a series of in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tests used 
to  characterise  its  effects  on  biological  targets  and  selectivity,  and  on  lymphocytes  and  neural 
cells/astrocytes.  In  vitro  studies  primarily  investigated  receptor  binding  and  cellular  activity  on 
lymphocytes  and  neural  cells.  In  vivo  studies  mainly  included  evaluation  of  the  down  modulation  of 
S1P1  lymphocyte  receptor  induced  by  fingolimod  and  its  effects  on  experimental  autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis  (EAE)  disease  model  using  different  species  (rats,  mice).  In  vivo  secondary 
pharmacodynamic  studies  were  also  performed  to  investigate  effects  of  fingolimod  on  inflammation, 
immune and contractile responses. 
Some  of  the  studies  were  conducted  with  its  enantiomers  (AML629,  AML627)  and  its  active  moiety, 
fingolimod phosphate (FTY720-P). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Fingolimod  (FTY720)  is  claimed  to  be  a  novel  synthetic  Sphingosine  1-phosphate  (S1P)  receptor 
modulator  indicated  as  disease-modifying  therapy  in  patients  with  relapsing  multiple  sclerosis  to 
reduce the frequency of relapses and to delay the progression of disability. 
Mechanistic studies demonstrated that FTY720 is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase in a variety of 
cell types and organ cultures. The phosphorylated form (FTY720-P) is claimed to be the active moiety 
of the drug. In receptor binding assays, FTY720 did not bind to the human receptors S1P1-S1P5, but 
FTY720-P had good affinity to S1P1, S1P3, S1P4 and S1P5 receptors.  
Knock-out  studies  using  conditional  S1P  receptor-deficient  mice  have  suggested  S1P1  as  the  key 
receptor  responsible  for  the  therapeutic  effects  of  FTY720  in  an  EAE  model.  Furthermore,  in  vivo 
studies with FTY720 demonstrated a reduction in blood lymphocyte count, which correlated to a down-
modulation  of  S1P1  in  lymphocytes  which  further  slowed  down  the  S1P-S1P1  dependent  egress 
kinetics of CD4 and CD8 T-cells and B-cells from lymph nodes.  
Gilenya 
ASSESSMENT REPORT 
EMA/108602/2011

T-cells seemed to require S1P1 activation to be able to emigrate from the thymus and T- and B-cells 
seem  to  depend  on  this  receptor  to  egress  from  peripheral  lymph  organs.  Down-modulation  of  S1P1 
reduces the recirculation of lymphocytes from lymph nodes into blood and CNS. Also, PK/PD studies in 
rats showed a clear correlation between blood concentrations of FTY720-P and the degree of depletion 
of peripheral blood lymphocytes.  
FTY720  is  suggested  to  mimic  a  conditional  S1P1-deficiency  in  neuronal  cells  which  is  correlated  to 
reduced  glial  fibrillary  acidic  protein  staining  and  reduced  astrogliosis.  This  may  reduce  the  pro-
inflammatory activities of S1P and reduce negative effects on gap junctions in astrocytes. 
Fingolimod was studied in EAE disease model systems in Wistar rats, Lewis  rats, SJL/J mice and in a 
new  DA  rat  model  developed  and  validated  by  the  applicant.  FTY720  was  tested  in  both  prophylactic 
and therapeutic settings. 
In Lewis rats EAE model, a dose of 0.1 mg/kg completely prevented the onset of disease symptoms for 
a  2-week  treatment  period  and  protected  against  a  rebound  for  at  least  1  month.  In  Lewis  rats 
immunized  with  Myelin  Basic  Protein  (MBP),  therapeutic  treatment  with  FTY720  significantly  inhibited 
the progression of EAE and the disease-associated histological changes in the spinal cords.  
In  SJL/J  mice,  the  development  of  proteolipid  protein-induced  EAE  was  almost  completely  prevented 
and  the  infiltration  of  CD4+  T  cells  into  spinal  cords  was  suppressed.  Therapeutic  treatment  of  EAE-
diseased  SJL/J  mice  inhibited  disease  scores  and  demyelination,  and  the  numbers  of  CD4+  T  cells  in 
spinal cords were reduced. The therapeutic effects in SJL mice further correlated to a normalization of 
mRNAs  encoding  myelin  proteins  and  inflammatory  mediators.  Similar  therapeutic  effects  of  FTY720 
were observed in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE in C57BL/6 mice.  
In DA rats with severe-protracted EAE, FTY720 inhibited established disease (ED50  0.1 mg/kg) and 
the protective effect after discontinuation of FTY720 lasted for up to 2.5 months. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
A  number  of  off-targets  related  to  safety  pharmacology  were  identified  for  FTY720  in  a  radioligand 
binding assay comprising GPCRs, transporters, ion channels and enzymes. Ki values were between 1-
10 µM (well above human Cmax) with the exception of the histamine H2 receptor, where the affinity 
was slightly higher, with a Ki of 0.50 μM (172 ng/mL).  
In an in vivo murine model of allergen-induced inflammation, reduction of fluid MRI signals, related to 
plasma  leakage  and  mucus  secretion  was  mainly  explained  by  the  action  on  endothelial  barrier 
integrity through S1P1 receptors.  
In  non-human  primates  (NHP)  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  models  vaccinated  with  tetanus  toxoid  (TTx), 
FTY720  inhibited  the  induction  of  primary  TTx-specific  IgG  responses,  presumably  by  inhibiting  the 
migration of T and B cells from other sites to the antigen-draining lymph nodes.  
In  an  in  vitro  study  (dose  range  of  1  nM  –  10  μM),  none  of  FTY720,  FTY720-P  or  S1P  triggered 
contractile  responses  in  muscle-nerve  preparation  of  the  guinea  pig  (Dunkin-Hartley)  ileum  and 
trachea suggesting no facilitation of acetylcholine or histamine release.

No  in  vitro  effects  were  observed  on  platelet  aggregation,  cardiac  action  potential  in  sheep  or  rabbit 
purkinje  fibres,  QT  interval  prolongation  or  QRS  in  isolated  pig  hearts.  An  increased  sinus  frequency 
and a slight QT shortening (3%) were observed by both FTY720 and FTY720-P in isolated pig hearts.  
In isolated rabbit nodes,  FTY720-P slightly but significantly decreased the spontaneously beating rate 
in  sino-atrial  (SA)  node  in  two  different  studies  by  -8  and  -12  %  versus  baseline  and  on  atrio-
ventricular  (AV)  node  with  a  decrease  in  the  spontaneously  beating  rate  of  -9  %  versus  baseline  at 
1000 nM.  
Conduction velocity, amplitude and duration were not significantly modified. FTY720 inhibited hERG tail 
current  from  200  ng/mL  by  25.2  %  in  HEK293  cells  and  the  active  (S)-enantiomer  of  FTY720-P 
(AML629) inhibited hERG channel activity from 100 ng/mL by 18.1%, which is well above the human 
Cmax,ss at the therapeutic dose of 0.5 mg/day (3.4 ng/mL). 
In wistar rats, an increased diastolic and systolic blood pressure was observed at an oral dose of 1 and 
10 mg/kg of FTY720 and decreased heart rate and sinus arrhythmia were observed at 10 mg/kg.  
In  guinea  pigs,  an intravenous  dose  from  0.01  mg/kg  caused  sinus  arrhythmia  and  0.1 and  1  mg/kg 
decreased heart rate and blood pressure. The QT interval was prolonged as heart rate was decreased 
but there were no QTc prolongation observed.  
Oral administration in conscious dogs caused a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure at 0.3 and 
1 mg/kg. No clear effect on heart rate was observed. In another oral dog study, doses from 5 mg/kg 
showed a decrease in heart rate (minimal effects in individual animals at 1 mg/kg) and an increase in 
blood pressure from 2.5 mg/kg.  
In monkeys dosed at 10 mg/kg orally, there was an increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure 4-
72 hours after administration with maximum increase after 6 hr (133.3 and 135.8% respectively) and 
a decreased heart rate 8-12 hr after administration by approximately 22%, compared to baseline, and 
an increased ECG T-wave potential in 2/4 animals that peaked 2, 6 and 8 hr post dose. 
Intravenous  administration  of  the  active  (S)-enantiomer  of  FTY720-P  (AML629)  in  rats  showed  a 
marked  and  transient  sinus  bradycardia  with  concomitant  sinus  arrhythmia  and  sinoatrial  and/or 
atrioventricuar blocks and decreased heart rate at 0.1 mg/kg. There was a trend towards reversibility 
of these effects. 
 In  guinea  pigs  administered  intravenously  with  0.01  mg/kg  AML629,    a  decreased  heart  rate  and 
blood  pressure,  prolonged  PR  and  QT  interval  but  no  QTc  prolongation  was  observed.  At  0.1  mg/kg 
also sinus arrhythmia and ECG changes were noted. 
Respiratory system 
No  significant  effects  on  respiratory  minute  rate,  respiratory  minute  volume  and  respiratory  tidal 
volume were observed in anaesthetised dogs administered intraduodenally with 1 mg/kg FTY720. Also, 
no  effects  were  noted  on  respiratory  rate,  blood  pH,  blood  gas  tension  or  haemoglobin  oxygen 
saturation  in  monkeys  administered  orally  with  0.1,  1  or  10  mg/kg  of  FTY720.  Intravenous 
administration  of  AML629  to  rats  at  0.1,  0.2,  0.5  mg/kg  induced  dyspnea.  In  addition,  a  decreased 
respiratory  minute  volume  was  observed  at  0.003  mg/kg  and  a  tendency  to  decreased  respiratory 
minute  volume  and  respiratory  minute  rate  at  0.001  and  0.1  mg/kg,  however  not  statistically 
significant.  
CNS system 
FTY720  showed  some  decrease  in  motor  coordination  in  mice  and  mild  depressive  activity  in  the 
central nervous system in rats at 10 mg/kg. In rats a prolonged narcotic sleep time was observed on 
Phenobarbital-induced narcotic sleep at 1-week treatments from 10 mg/kg for 4 days and 4 mg/kg for

3  days.  This  is  considered  as  high  dose  effects.  In  a  variety  of  other  tests  on  central  nervous  effects 
FTY720 did not show relevant effects.  
Other systems 
FTY720 resulted in transient decreases in renal function (dogs) and urine output (rats) at 10 mg/kg.  
No  effects  were  observed  on  gastrointestinal  functions  in  rats  and  mice,  on  the  plasma  level  of 
corticosterone  in  rats  and  on  the  smooth  muscle  contraction  of  the  isolated  guinea  pig  ileum.  There 
was  a  slight  effect  on  the  contraction  of  the  gastrocnemius  muscle  in  rabbits  following  intraduodenal 
treatment. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  carried  out  with  fingolimod.  The  available 
supportive data were based on clinical studies and were considered sufficient to characterize the drug 
interaction profile of fingolimod. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  metabolism  of  fingolimod  were  investigated  using  five  animal  species: 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey. 
The  absorption  of  fingolimod  was  slow  and  almost  complete  after  oral  administration  in  most  species 
(≥  49%).  Cmax  was  reached  at  4-12  hours  following  a  single  oral  administration.    FTY720-P  in  the 
blood  was  present  almost  exclusively  (≥  94%)  in  the  form  of  the  (S)-enantiomer  (AML629).  The 
absolute oral bioavailability was high with > 50% of the dose in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. 
FTY720 and AML629 were highly bound to plasma proteins of the mouse, rat, dog, monkey (>99%).  
After i.v. or p.o. dosing of [14C]-FTY720, drug-related radioactivity was extensively distributed to most 
organs and tissues of mice, rats and dogs. The tissue distribution was consistent with the large steady-
state volume of distribution (Vss) of FTY720 observed in the mouse (17.3 L/kg), rat (21 L/kg), and dog 
(7.6 L/kg). 
FTY720  and  FTY720-P  crossed  the  blood-brain  barriers  of  several  species  (mice,  rats,  dogs  and 
monkeys). FTY720-P was found in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord of the rat almost exclusively in 
form  of  the  (S)-enantiomer  (AML629).  FTY720  and  its  metabolites  crossed  the  placental  barrier  of 
pregnant rats and rabbits. FTY720 and its metabolites excreted into the milk of lactating rats.  
In pregnant rats [14C]-fingolimod-related radioactivity penetrated readily into the placenta and fetuses 
after  a  single  oral  dose  of  0.45  mg/kg  [14C]-fingolimod  on  gestational  days  13  and  18.  In  pregnant 
rabbits  [14C]-fingolimod-related  radioactivity  penetrated  the  placental  barrier  after  a  single  oral  dose 
of  5  mg/kg  [14C]-  fingolimod  at  gestational  day  17,  reaching  radioactivity  concentrations  in  fetuses 
about  4-fold  lower  than  in  the  dam.  FTY720-related  radioactivity  slowly  passed  into  the  milk  after  a 
single  oral  dose  of  7.5  mg/kg  of  [14C]-fingolimod  in  rats,  reaching  maximum  radioactivity 
concentrations  (3.91  μmol/L;  1.2  μg-eq/mL)  24  hours  post-dose.  The  radioactivity  in  milk  consisted 
mainly of fingolimod and fingolimod-P (exclusively the (S)-enantiomer) and reached 2- to 3-fold higher 
concentrations in milk than in the blood of the dam. 
In rats, the highest radioactivity concentrations after multiple oral dosing of 2.5 mg/kg were observed 
in  the  glandular  stomach,  liver,  oesphagus,  kidney,  pituitary  gland,  spleen  and  adrenal  followed  by 
brain tissue, spinal cord and choroids plexus. Fingolimod-related radioactivity disappeared slowly from 
blood  and  most  tissues,  with  apparent  terminal  half-lives  of  about  30-60  hours.  The  elimination  of 
Gilenya 
ASSESSMENT REPORT

radioactivity  was  slower  from  brain  tissue  (t1/2  ~140  h),  eyes  and  white  fat  (t1/2  ~160  h),  nerves 
(t1/2 ~200 h), epididymis (t1/2 ~320 h), and testis (t1/2 ~460 h). 
In  an in  vitro  study  with  human liver  microsomes, M12  (8-hydroxyoctyl  metabolite)  was  identified  as 
the  major  metabolite  of  fingolimod.  The  biotransformation  of  fingolimod  occurred  by  three  primary 
pathways  for  most  of  the  drug-related  material  in  blood  and/or  excreta  across  all  studied  species 
(including  human):  reversible  phosphorylation  of  fingolimod  to  fingolimod-P  (the  pharmacologically 
active (S)-enantiomer AML629); CYP-dependent (mainly CYP4F2) hydroxylation at the octyl side chain 
to  metabolite  M12,  followed  by  further  oxidation  to  M1,  M2,  M3  and  M4  and  formation  of  ceramide 
analogs of FTY720 (M27-M30).  
Mainly  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1,  CYP3A4,  CYP4F2,  CYP4F3B  and  CYP4F12  were  shown  to  catalyze  the 
biotransformation  of  FTY720  to  M12,  M15-M20  with  measurable  turn-over,  of  which  CYP4F2 
contributed predominantly. All metabolites found in vivo in human blood were also detected in at least 
one animal species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog or monkey) with rat and monkey showing the most similar 
metabolite pattern.  
After  repeated  dosing  of  7.5  mg/kg  [14C]-fingolimod  for  14  days  to  male  rats,  fingolimod  was  more 
abundant  than  fingolimod-P  in  the  cerebral  cortex,  whereas  fingolimod-P  was  more  abundant  than 
fingolimod in the spinal cord. The ceramide analogue metabolites M28 and M30 were present in traces. 
Other unidentified radiolabeled components were detected in small amounts (<2% of radioactivity).  
Balance of excretion in urine and feces was almost complete (generally > 90% of the p.o. dose) after 7 
days  in  mice  and  rats,  and  after  10  days  in  dogs. In  monkeys,  the  balance  of  excretion  in  urine  and 
feces  was  incomplete  (72%,  after  p.o.)  due  to  loss  of  excreta  during  sample  collection.  In  bile  duct-
cannulated rats, 43, 17,  and 24% of  the radioactive dose was  recovered in the urine, bile, and feces 
within 72 hours post-dose, respectively.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity  
Acute toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats and dogs using oral and/or intravenous routes. The 
estimated lethal dose in 50% of animals (LD50) for acute intravenous toxicity of FTY720 in mice was 
25<LD50<50 mg/kg for males and >50 mg/kg for females. The LD50-estimation for acute intravenous 
toxicity of FTY720 in rats  was >50 mg/kg for males and 21 mg/kg for females. In acute  oral toxicity 
study  in  dogs,  no  considerable  clinical  signs  or  mortality  were  observed  mainly  due  to  dose  limiting 
effect (as expressed by vomiting) of the test compound at 2000 mg/kg. No effect on peripheral blood 
pressure  after  oral  single  dose  of  1  mg/kg  in  dogs  was  observed.  The  main  finding  was  lymphopenia 
which  was  seen  without  recovery  from  days  1  to  8  post-administration  and  correlated  with  atrophic 
changes in lymph nodes. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
Repeat dose studies were performed in mice, rats, monkeys and dogs using the oral route.  
In  mice,  the  “no  observed  adverse  effect  level”  (NOAEL)  after  4  weeks  of  dosing  was  set  at  0.3 
mg/kg/day.  
In  rats,  a  decrease  in  lymphocytes  in  peripheral  blood  was  seen  at  all  dose  levels  and  correlated 
histopathologically with dose-related atrophic changes of lymphatic organs and immunohistochemically

with  a  decreased  number  of  circulating  (intrasinusoidal/intravascular)  CD3-positive  T-lymphocytes  in 
the  liver  in  a  13  week  study.  Additionally,  interstitial  collagenization  was  seen  in  the  lungs  at  all 
FTY720  treated  groups  and  smooth  muscle  hypertrophy  in  bronchiolo-alveolar  junctions  at  5 
mg/kg/day.  Effects  on  lymphoid  organs  and  decreased  lymphocyte  counts  were  noted  for  all  treated 
groups in a 26 week study. Effects in the lungs and kidneys were observed and were associated with 
the pharmacological action of fingolimod in a 27 week study.  
In dogs, a dose-limiting effect (as expressed by vomiting), an increase in AST, and a decrease in body 
weight were seen at 30 mg/kg/day in a 2 week study. A decrease in lymphocyte counts and atrophy of 
lymph nodes were seen at dose equal or greater than 0.01 mg/kg/day in a 4 week study, the NOAEL of 
FTY720 was set at 0.001  mg/kg/day.  In a 26-week study, a decrease in total cholesterol, an increase 
in lung weights, alveolar macrophage infiltration of the lungs and vascular wall thickening of the heart 
were noted at 1 mg/kg/day in a 26 week study, the NOAEL was set at 0.01 mg/kg/day.  
In  cynomolgus  monkeys,  an  increased  incidence  of  insufficient  pulmonary  collapse  was  observed  in 
compound  treated  animals  and  generally  correlated  with  increased  lung  weights  and  histologic 
evidence of smooth muscle hypertrophy and/or increased collagen in a 43 week study at doses of 0.5 
or 3 mg/kg/day. Pulmonary smooth muscle hypertrophy/increased collagen was reduced after recovery 
periods  of  13  and  26  weeks,  indicating  partial  reversibility.  In  a  longer  52-week  study,  main  findings 
included  a  generally  dosage-related  effect  on  body  weight,  water  consumption  and  lung  weight,  the 
latter being associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle at the bronchiolo-alveolar junction and 
hyper-distension of the alveoli at all dose levels. Hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells with an associated 
increase  in  the  amount  of  collagen  in  the  walls  of  the  respiratory  bronchioles  and  alveolar  ducts  and 
the  entrances  to  the  alveolar  sacs,  together  with  aggregates  of  alveolar  macrophages  were  also 
observed in a number of animals.  
Genotoxicity 
The mutagenicity and clastogenicity of fingolimod was evaluated in vitro in an Ames test, DNA repair 
tests, and in a gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells. Rat and mouse micronucleus tests were 
also performed. All of these studies had negative results. 
Carcinogenicity 
The oncogenic potential of fingolimod was assessed in mice and rats following oral administration. 
In  104  week  studies  following  oral  administration  of  FTY720,  an  increased  incidence  in  malignant 
lymphomas  at  0.25  and  2.5  mg/kg/day  was  observed  in  mice.  No  tumorigenic  potential  up  to  the 
highest dose level of 2.5 mg/kg/day were noted in rats.  
In  mice,  dose  dependent  increased  incidences  of  hemangiosarcoma  in  the  liver  ≥  0.25  mg/kg/day  in 
males,  increased  incidences  of  hemangiosarcoma  for  the  total  body  at  2.5  mg/kg  in  males  and 
increased  incidences  of  hemangioma  for  the  total  body  in  females  at  2.5  mg/kg/day  were  also 
observed.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The effect of fingolimod on fertility and early embryonic development was assessed in male and female 
rats and in female rabbits.  
In  a  4-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  dogs,  all  males  showed  hyperspermatogenesis  in  tubuli  of 
testes  and  hypospermia  in  epidymis  at  30  mg/kg.    In  male  rats,  atrophy  of  prostate  and  seminal 
vesicle at 10 mg/kg (n=2), decreased prostate weight and secretion were observed in a dose related 
manner from 0.5 mg/kg. Howewer, fingolimod had no effect on sperm count/motility or on fertility in

male and female rats up to the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg), representing an approximate 150-fold 
margin based on human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 0.5 mg.  
In  rabbits,  maternal  toxicity  and  high  embryo-fetal  mortality  at  doses  equal  or  greater  than  10 
mg/kg/day were observed. In another study, a significant increase in embryo-fetal mortality in rabbits 
at doses equal or greater than 1.5 mg/kg  and a decrease in the number of viable fetuses as well as 
fetal growth retardation were noted at 5 mg/kg/day, in the absence of severe maternal toxicity. 
In pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant and lactating rats, FTY720 administered at doses 
of 0.05, 0.15 or 0.5 mg/kg/day resulted in maternal effects at 0.5 mg/kg/day which included slightly 
decreased food consumption and body weight parameters and, decreased F1 pup survival in the early 
postpartum  period  at  all  doses.  The  most  common  foetal  visceral  malformations  included  persistent 
truncus  arteriosus  and  ventricular  septum  defect.  Treatment-related  effects  in  neonatal/  juvenile 
animals  were  comparable  to  those  seen  in  adult  rats  at  that  dose  levels,  with  the  exception  of  the 
absence of smooth muscle hypertrophy in the lungs of the juvenile rats. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic  data  on  FTY720,  FTY720-P,  and  a  number  of  metabolites  were  collected  from 
pharmacokinetic or toxicology studies previously described.  
Exposure of all animals to FTY720, FTY720-P, and metabolites M2, M3, M29 and M30 was shown in the 
mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys. 
Across  all  studied  species,  systemic  exposure  to  FTY720  (Cmax  and  AUC)  increased  approximately 
proportional with the dose. Steady-state blood concentrations of FTY720 were reached generally after 
1-2 weeks of daily treatment. There was no apparent gender difference in exposure to FTY720, in all 
studied  species.  Brain/blood  concentration  ratios  were  different  between  species  and  dependent  on 
dose  and  treatment  period.  In  monkeys  at  0.5  to  10  mg/kg,  respectively,  the  brain-to-blood  ratios 
were approximately 117- or 346-fold at the end of a 13- and 39-week treatment period. 
Local Tolerance 
Following intravenous administration, local irritation at the injection site was observed in dogs and rats 
in studies investigating doses up to 5mg/kg. Other findings not related to local tolelance were similar 
to the previously described oral toxicity studies. 
Other toxicity studies 
FTY720 did not induce anti-FTY720 IgE antibody production in mice. In addition, FTY720 did not induce 
the production of antibodies specific to FTY720 or anaphylactic reactions in guinea pigs.  
FTY720  and  its  active  moiety  FTY720  did  not  absord  light  at ≥ 290  nm.  No specific  photoxicity  study 
has  been  performed.  Fingolimod-related  radioactivity  was  reversibly  taken  up  to  melanin-containing 
structures of the eye in pigmented rats.  
FTY720 did not induce anti-FTY720 IgE antibody production in mice. In addition, FTY720 did not induce 
the production of antibodies specific to FTY720 or anaphylactic reactions in guinea pigs. 
In  immunotoxicity  studies,  T  cell-dependent  antibody  generation  specific  to  Sheep  Red  Blood  Cell 
(SRBC) was still possible at FTY720 doses of 0.3, 1.5 or 7.5 mg/kg/day. FTY720 at 7.5 mg/kg/day, by 
dietary administration to rats, resulted in a reduction of cortical proliferating cells (undifferentiated T-
cells and thymocytes). An increase of CD3 positive (differentiated T-lymphocytes) medullary cells, with 
no proliferation, was also observed. In monkeys, FTY720 inhibited the induction of primary TTx-specific 
IgG responses, presumably by inhibiting the migration of T and B cells from other sites to the antigen-
draining lymph nodes (LN).

Transcriptomic studies were performed on rat and monkey lungs to elucidate the mechanism of action 
of  the  lung  toxicity  (hypertrophy/hyperplasia),  in  addition  of  other  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  studies.  The 
results of these studies showed that important modifications of the gene expression profiles, generally 
an increased expression of many categories of transcripts. 
No evidence of a mutagenic or clastogenic/ aneugenic potential on impurities was shown. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  ERA  according  to  CHMP  guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for 
human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, June 2006) was submitted. The physiochemical properties of 
fingolimod  are:  Molecular  mass:  343.94;  solubility  in  water>200g/l;  Log  Kow  (pH  6):  3.6,  Log  D 
(pH7): 2.6. Based on a daily dose of 1.25 mg fingolimod, the predicted environmental concentration in 
surface  water  was  PEC SURFACE  WATER  was  0.00625  μg/L  (<  0.01  μg/L).  No  Phase  II  studies  were 
performed. However, the Log D determination was questioned by the CHMP prior to any conclusion on 
the persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (BPT) properties of fingolimod. Following clarifications on the 
method used and LogD determination, the CHMP considered that a risk for the environment due to the 
intended use of fingolimod in patients with multiple sclerosis is not expected. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In mechanistic and receptor binding studies, fingolimod has shown to be phosphorylated to fingolimod-
P,  claimed  to  be  the  active  moiety.  Fingolimod  P  has  a  good  affinity  to  S1P1,  S1P3,S1P4  and  S1P5 
receptors. By acting as a functional antagonist of S1P receptors in its phosphorylated form, fingolimod 
has further demonstrated in vivo a reduction in blood lymphocyte count, which correlated to a down-
modulation  of  S1P1  in  lymphocytes  which  further  slowed  down  the  S1P-S1P1  dependent  egress 
kinetics  of  CD4  and  CD8  T-cells  and  B-cells  from  lymph  nodes.  This  mechanism  is  claimed  to  reduce 
the recirculation of lymphocytes from lymph nodes into blood and CNS. In vivo studies also indicated 
that fingolimod may also act via interaction with S1P receptors on neural cells. 
Several  EAE  disease  model  systems  were  used  in  both  prophylactic  and  therapeutic  settings. 
Fingolimod  showed  beneficial  effects  in  these  models  by  either  preventing  the  onset  of  disease 
symptoms,  protecting  against  a  rebound  effect  or  inhibiting  the  progression  of  EAE  and  disease-
associated  histological  changes.  A  number  of  other  secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  (e.g  immune 
and contractile responses) were also observed.  
The  safety  pharmacology  identified  several  cardiac  effects  (e.g  decrease  heart  rate,  increased  blood 
pressure,  ECG  changes,  arrhythmia,  sinoatrial  and  atrioventricular  blocks)  observed  in  different 
species. Respiratory effects (e.g dyspnea) were also reported in rats. 
The  results  of  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  animals  showed:  slow  oral  absorption,  extensive  tissue 
distribution (crossed the blood brain and placenta barriers), high protein binding and slow elimination. 
Fingolimod drug related material is excreted both in urine and faeces and notably in milk. 
The majority of the findings in the repeated dose toxicity studies were related to the pharmacological 
activity  of  fingolimod.  Main  target  organs  were  the  lymphoid  system  (lymphopenia  and  lymphoid 
atrophy), lungs (increased weight, smooth muscle hypertrophy at the bronchio-alveolar junction), and 
heart  (negative  chronotropic  effect,  increase  in  blood  pressure,  perivascular  changes  and  myocardial 
degeneration) in several species; blood vessels (vasculopathy) in rats only. 
An  initial  increase  in  vascular  permeability  in  concert  with  activation,  differentiation  and/or 
transmigration of phagocytes in the lungs and arterial wall leading to an increased secretion of soluble

markers  was  suggested  to  contribute  to  the  smooth  muscle  hypertrophy.  Increased  permeability  and 
vasculopathy were also seen in several other organs.  
In  the  2  year  carcinogenicity  studies  conducted  in mice  and  rats,  different  results  were  observed.  An 
increased  incidence  in  malignant  lymphomas  at  0.25  and  2.5  mg/kg/day  was  observed  in  mice 
representing  an  approximate  6-fold  margin  based  on  the  human  systemic  exposure  (AUC)  at  a  daily 
dose of 0.5 mg. No tumorigenic potential up to the highest dose level of 2.5 mg/kg/day were noted in 
rats  representing  an  approximate  50-fold  margin  based  on  human  systemic  exposure  (AUC)  at  the 
0.5 mg  dose.  FTY720  is  not  a  classical  immunosuppressive  drug  and  consequently  the  mechanism 
behind the increased incidence of lymphomas, and the clinical relevance of immunosuppression remain 
unclear. This issue is discussed under the clinical aspects. 
Taking into account the above non clinical findings, the long term effects of fingolimod on T cells and 
their  egression  to  the  peripheral  circulation  should  be  further  addressed  by  the  applicant  and  this  is 
discussed under the clinical aspects. 
There was no evidence of genotoxicity in a standard package of tests. 
In  a  4-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  dogs,  all  males  showed  hyperspermatogenesis  in  tubuli  of 
testes and hypospermia in epidymis at 30 mg/kg. In male rats, atrophy of prostate and seminal vesicle 
at 10 mg/kg (n=2), decreased prostate weight and secretion were observed in a dose related manner 
from 0.5 mg/kg. Howewer, fingolimod had no effect on sperm count/motility or on fertility in male and 
female  rats  up  to  the  highest  dose  tested  (10 mg/kg),  representing  an  approximate  150-fold  margin 
based on human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 0.5 mg.  
In  rabbits,  maternal  toxicity  and  high  embryo-fetal  mortality  at  doses  equal  or  greater  than  10 
mg/kg/day were observed. In another study, a significant increase in embryo-fetal mortality in rabbits 
at doses equal or greater than 1.5 mg/kg  and a decrease in the number of viable fetuses as well as 
fetal growth retardation were noted at 5 mg/kg/day, in the absence of severe maternal toxicity. There 
were some limitations in this study (e.g decreased number of viable foetuses) and the CHMP concluded 
that the teratogenic potential could not be fully assessed in rabbits.  
Fingolimod  was  teratogenic  in  rats  when  given  at  doses  of  0.1 mg/kg  or  higher.  The  most  common 
foetal visceral malformations included persistent truncus arteriosus and ventricular septum defect. 
Regarding  the  reduction  of  survival  in  F1  pups,  in  utero  effects  may  have  likely  induced  peri-natal 
deaths even though no cardiac abnormalities were found in the examined pups. Immature metabolism 
could also have contributed to the high mortality rate in F1 pups. However, the CHMP concluded that 
the  reduction  of  the  survival  of  F1  pups  at  all doses  in  the  pre  and  postnatal  development  study  has 
not  been  fully  elucidated.  Furthermore,  fingolimod  was  excreted  in  milk  of  treated  animals  during 
lactation  at  concentrations  2-3-fold  higher  than  that  found  in  maternal  plasma.  Fingolimod  and  its 
metabolites crossed the placental barrier in pregnant rabbits.  
Appropriate  recommendations  concerning  pregnancy,  lactation  and  breastfeeding  are  included  in  the 
SmPC. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  aspects  of  fingolimod  have  been  adequately  documented  and  meet  the 
requirements to support this application.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were derived from 14 phase I clinical pharmacology studies including a total 
number  of  372  volunteers:  253  healthy  volunteers,  88  renal  transplant  patients,  22  hepatic  impaired 
patients  and  9  renal  impaired  patients.  In  addition,  2  studies  have  been  performed  in  order  to 
investigate the potential for drug-drug interaction and included 14 psoriasis patients (cyclosporine) and 
22  healthy  volunteers  (ketoconazole).  The  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  profile  of  fingolimod 
was also investigated in a study including 112 healthy volunteers. 
Concentrations of fingolimod and its analysed metabolites (e.g fingolimod-phosphate) were measured 
in  whole  blood  using  LC-MS/MS  methods  in  the  PK  studies.  Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were 
determined  using  non  compartmental  models.  In  addition,  population  PK  analyses  using  nonlinear

mixed  effects  modeling  methodology  (NONMEM)  and  exposure-response  relationship  modelling  were 
also performed. 
Absorption  
Fingolimod  was  extensively  (≥  85%)  and  rapidly  absorbed  upon  oral  administration  as  it  could  be 
detected 0.5 to 1 h after administration. However, the absorption was slow (tmax of 12-16 hours). The 
absolute oral bioavailability appeared to be high (93%, 95%CI: 79-111%). 
The  extent  of  absorption  of  fingolimod  is  not  significantly  modified  by  food  intake  absorption.  The 
impact  of  food-intake  on  the  rate  of  absorption  is  less  clear.  A  34%  decrease  in  Cmax  was  observed 
with  the  active  metabolite  fingolimod-phosphate  and  was  considered  marginal  in  comparison  to 
average  blood  concentration  at  steady  state.  The  SmPC  recommends  that  Gilenya  may  be  taken 
without regard to meals. 
All phase II and III clinical studies were conducted using the formulation intended to be marketed.  
Distribution  
The  volume  of  distribution  estimated  after  administration  of  1  mg  fingolimod  by  IV  route  is  1200  ± 
260 l,  indicating  an  extensive  distribution  of  fingolimod  to  body  tissues.  At  blood  level,  a  high 
distribution  into  red  blood  cells  was  evidenced  with  a  fraction  of  86%  for  fingolimod.  Fingolimod-P 
showed  much  less  uptake  by  blood  cells  with  a  fraction  in  blood  cells  (<17%).    At  plasma  level, 
Fingolimod  and  fingolimod-P  are  extensively  bound  to  plasma  proteins  with  an  unbound  fraction  of 
0.15%  in  the  concentration  range  0.1-  100  ng/mL.  The  level  of  binding  was  similar  in  healthy 
volunteer and in patients with hepatic and severe renal impairment. 
Elimination  
Apparent Fingolimod blood clearance is low, 6.3±2.3 L/h, and the average apparent terminal half-life is 
long,  6-9  days.  Blood  levels  of  fingolimod-P  decline  in  parallel  with  fingolimod  in  the  terminal  phase 
yielding similar half-lives for both. 
After  an  oral  administration,  about  81%  of  the  dose  is  slowly  excreted  in  the  urine  as  inactive 
metabolites.  Fingolimod  and  fingolimod-P  are  not  excreted  intact  in  urine  but  are  the  major 
components  in  the  feces  with  amounts  representing  less  than  2.5%  of  the  dose  each.  As  expected 
from  high  protein  binding  and  high  volume  of  distribution,  hemodialysis  results in  only  a  minor,  14% 
decrease  in  fingolimod  blood  concentration.  After  34 days,  the  recovery  of  the  administered  dose  is 
89%. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies  
Fingolimod  and  fingolimod-P  PK  appeared  to  evolve  proportionally  to  the  dose  for  a  wide  range  of 
doses including the therapeutic dose range of interest i.e. 1.25 mg - 0.5 mg and lower doses.  
The  intra-individual  and  inter-individual  variability  (respectively  15%  and  30%  approximately)  was  in 
general  relatively  low  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  inter-subjects  variability  was  higher  in  patients 
(approximately 50-65 %).

Special populations  
Specific  phases  I  studies  evaluating  renal  and  hepatic  functions,  paediatric  population  and  effect  of 
race  were  conducted.  Other  data  related  to  age,  gender  were  derived  from  population  PK  analyses. 
Exposure- response relationship modelling in patients with RRMS was also performed. 
A  specific  study  was  conducted  in  subjects  with  stable  severe  renal  impairment  after  1.25  mg  oral 
single  dose.  Exposure  to  fingolimod  and  fingolimod-P  was  slightly  enhanced  in  severe  renal  impaired 
patient comparatively to healthy volunteers (increase of Cmax and AUC by 32 and 43 % for fingolimod 
and 25 and 14% for fingolimod-P). A 14-fold increase of exposure to M3 inactive metabolite was also 
observed. 
Specific  studies  were  conducted  in  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment  after  oral  single  dose,  at  1  mg 
dose for subjects with mild/moderate impairment and 5 mg dose for subjects with severe impairment. 
For  fingolimod,  AUC  was  increased  by  12%,  44%  and  103%  for  subjects  with  mild,  moderate  and 
severe  hepatic  impairment,  respectively.  The  apparent  elimination  half-life  was  unchanged  in  mild 
hepatic  impairment  but  was  prolonged  by  49-50%  in  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment.  For 
fingolimod-P,  AUC  was  increased  by  29%  in  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment.  There  were  no 
data on exposure to fingolimod-P in subjects with mild/moderate hepatic impairment. Recovery of the 
inactive  metabolite  M2  in  urine  over  the  first  4  days  post-dose  was  not  affected  by  mild  hepatic 
impairment  but  was  reduced  by  an  average  of  70%  and  53%  in  moderate  and  severe  hepatic 
impairment, respectively. M3 urine recovery was reduced on average by 47%, 68% and 65% in mild, 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. 
A  specific  study  was  conducted  in  Caucasian  and  Japanese  subjects  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  race. 
There were no significant differences observed between Caucasian and Japanese after single 1.25, 2.5 
or  5  mg  dose  and  multiple  5  mg  dose.  Additional  population  PK  analyses  in  renal  transplant  and  MS 
patients revealed no significant influence of ethnicity on pre-dose blood concentrations for fingolimod. 
There  are  limited  data  available  in  adolescent  population  that  included  7 children  above  11 years  of 
age with renal transplant. No conclusions could be drawn regarding the pharmacokinetic profile in this 
population. 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  did  not  reveal  any  significant  effect  of  gender  nor  age.  No 
conclusions could be drawn regarding the pharmacokinetic profile in the elderly population. 
Exposure-  response  relationship  modelling  in  patients  with  RRMS  showed  that  0.5  mg  dose  was  as 
beneficial as 1.25 mg dose. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In  vitro  studies  suggested  that  the  oxidative  metabolism  of  FTY720  is  mediated  predominantly  by 
CYP4F2  with  additional  contribution  of  CYP3A4  and  several  other  enzymes.  Lack  of  specific  identified 
CYP4F inducer or inhibitor in the submitted clinical studies did not allow drawing definite conclusion on 
CYP4F  interaction.  In  addition,  the  metabolism  of  FTY720  was  inhibited  in  vitro  by  ketoconazole,  and 
slight  inhibitions  were  observed  with  troleandomycin  (TAO),  being  a  well-known  mechanism-based 
inhibitor for CYP3A4. The inducing properties of fingolimod seemed to be low. In vitro studies indicated 
that fingolimod was not an inducing agent for isoenzymes/transporters regulated via PXR, CAR and the 
Ah-receptor pathways.  
The  potential 
interactions  were  studied 
in  humans 
for  the 
following  drugs:  ketoconazole 
(CYP3A4/CYP4F2 inhibitor) and cyclosporine (CYP3A4/MDR1 inhibitor). 
Gilenya 
ASSESSMENT REPORT 
EMA/108602/2011  
Page 23/117
 
 
 
In  the  study  with  ketoconazole,  the  AUCt  and  AUC  of  both  FTY720  and  FTY720-P  were  increased  by 
approximately  70%  in  co-administration  with  ketoconazole,  as  compared  to  FTY720  administered 
alone.  In  the  study  with  cyclosporine, there  was  no  influence  of  ciclosporine on  the  Cmax  or  AUCt  of 
fingolimod;  however  the  total  AUC  indicated  a  slight  increase  in  co-administration  with  cyclosporine, 
although not statistically significant. Also, fingolimod did not appear to be a substrate of the protein P-
glycoprotein transporter (P-gp). 
Considering  the  teratogenic  properties  of  fingolimod  and  the  lack  of  in  vivo  interaction  study 
investigating  the  inducing  effect  of  fingolimod  on  oral  contraceptives,  an  additional  study  evaluating 
the  interaction  between  fingolimod,  ethinyl  estradiol  and  levonorgestrel  was  performed  at  the  CHMP 
request. Following this co-administration, no changes were observed neither in the oral contraceptives 
exposure nor in fingolimod and fingolimod P. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
After oral dosing, fingolimod is phosphorylated in vivo by sphingosine kinase to form the active moiety 
fingolimod-phosphate (fingolimod-P). GTPγS binding assays revealed that FTY720-P can bind to four of 
the five known S1P receptors in vitro, namely S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 but not S1P2. 
Depending on the cell type, the concentration, and the time following administration, fingolimod-P may 
act  as  an  “agonist”  or  “functional  antagonist”  at  S1P  receptors.  The  key  claimed  pharmacodynamic 
effect of fingolimod relevant for MS is a dose-dependent reduction of the peripheral lymphocyte count 
mediated by down-modulation of the S1P1 receptor on lymphocytes.  
Under normal circumstances, lymphocytes exit from lymph nodes via S1P1 receptor signaling along a 
sphingosine  1-phosphate  gradient.  Both  T-  and  B-cells  require  this  receptor  for  emigration  from 
peripheral  lymphoid  organs  and  T-cells  selectively  require  S1P1  activation  for  emigration  from  the 
thymus.  
Fingolimod-P  is  claimed  to  act  as  a  functional  antagonist  of  the  S1P1  receptor  on  lymphocytes, 
inducing its uncoupling/internalization. The internalization of S1P1 renders these cells unresponsive to 
S1P,  depriving  them  of  the  obligatory  signal  to  egress  from  lymphoid  organs  and  recirculate  to 
peripheral  inflammatory  tissues.  Thus,  fingolimod-P  is  claimed  to  cause  a  re-distribution,  rather  than 
depletion, of lymphocytes. This reduces infiltration of pathogenic lymphocyte cells into the CNS where 
they would be involved in inflammation and nervous tissue damage. Other principal pharmacodynamic 
effects of fingolimod include effects on the heart (decreased heart rate, AV conduction block) and lung 
(increased airway resistance).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic effects of fingolimod on lymphocytes count, heart and lungs have been investigated 
in  healthy  volunteers,  patients  with  renal  transplant,  psoriasis,  moderate  asthma,  renal  or  hepatic 
impairment. Some of these studies were previously discussed in relation to the pharmacokinetic profile 
of fingolimod. 
Lymphocyte count

EMA/108602/2011

Single doses of fingolimod  0.5 mg resulted in a dose dependent decrease in lymphocyte count up to 
27%  of  baseline  at  3.5  mg.  This  decrease  occured  rapidly,  within  3-4  hours  of  the  oral  dose.  With 
single doses from 5 to 40 mg, there is a dose-dependent decrease in lymphocyte count between 74% 
and  90%  from  baseline.  With  multiple  dosing  (28  days)  of  fingolimod  from  0.125  mg  to  5  mg  there 
was  a  dose  dependent  decrease  in  lymphocyte  count.  Even  at  the  lowest  dose  of  fingolimod  tested, 
0.125  mg,  a  decrease  in  lymphocyte  count  can  be  detected  within  several  days  after  the  start  of 
treatment.  For  fingolimod  0.5  mg,  lymphocytes  counts  developed  an  average  decrease  of 
approximately 60% from the baseline and the recovery was not full at day 56 (one month later) with 
lymphocytes  count  achieving  80%  of  the  baseline.  At  doses  ≥  1  mg/day,  reductions  around  70%  to 
80% were observed. A full recovery was observed at day 56 for 0.125 mg and 0.25 mg. 
In a specific study in healthy volunteers, the capacity to mount a primary IgG and IgM response to a 
novel  T-cell  dependent  antigen  (Keyhole  limpet  hemocyanin  or  KLH)  was  reduced  by  approximately 
45% and 88%, respectively, in the fingolimod 0.5 mg treatment group as compared to placebo group. 
Similar findings were observed in relation to immune response to Pneumococcal vaccine (PPV-23), with 
a reduction by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively. Placebo and fingolimod 0.5 mg groups had 
similar capacity to mount a > 4 fold increase in IgG antibody level to PPV-23 immunization, 54% and 
41%, respectively. There were lower > 4 fold responder rates for both KLH IgG (57%) and PPV-23 IgG 
(10%)  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  group  compared  to  either  placebo  or  fingolimod  0.5  treatment 
groups.  Anti-tetanus  toxoid  IgG  levels  did  not  change  over  the  course  of  the  study  on  placebo  or 
fingolimod  treatment.  Skin  delayed  type  hypersensitivity  was  decreased  in  subjects  receiving 
fingolimod  treatment  compared  to  placebo  treatment.  While  the  fingolimod  0.5  mg  treatment  group 
had a DTH response similar to placebo, the fingolimod 1.25 mg treatment group manifested a clearly 
lower capacity to mount a DTH.  
The  use  of  short  course  of  corticosteroids  therapy  for  relapses  was  not  associated  with  an  increased 
risk  of  infection  in  MS  clinical  studies.  However,  no  further  investigation  of  pharmacodynamic 
interaction with other MS treatment modalities was performed.  
Cardiac effects 
Single doses of fingolimod 0.5 and 1.25 mg have a mean negative chronotropic effect especially on the 
first day of treatment. This effect began to attenuate after 14 days of dosing. With continued chronic 
dosing,  the  negative  chronotropic  effect  of  fingolimod  disappeared.  With  multiple  dose  administration 
of fingolimod 0.5, 1.25 or 5 mg, the negative chronotropic effect occurred especially on the first day of 
dosing. The transient acute decrease in heart rate after the first dose of fingolimod and the subsequent 
recovery was similar in Asian and Caucasian subjects after both single dose and multiple doses. 
Fingolimod  acts  synergistically  with  atenolol  inducing  severe  bradycardia  in  healthy  volunteers 
representing  15%  additional  reduction  of  heart  rate.  An  intense  bradycardia  was  present  during  the 
first 8 hours, and recurred at night time, when vagal activation was maximal. 
When fingolimod was used with diltiazem, there was no additional effect on heart rate over 12 hours 
compared with fingolimod treatment alone. 
Atropine  did  not  relevantly  antagonize  nor  prevent  fingolimod  induced  bradycardia  in  healthy 
volunteers. 
Fingolimod  induced  bradycardia  and  shift  the  dose  response  of  isoproterenol  to  the  right  in  healthy 
volunteers, acting similarly to beta-blocker agents.A titration regimen (0.125 – 1.25 mg) over the first 
week reduced the initial bradycardia induced by fingolimod.

In  addition  to  bradycardia,  treatment  with  fingolimod  is  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  AV 
block.  The  incidence  rate  of  2nd  degree  atrioventricular  block  with  fingolimod  doses  ≤1.25 mg  (7%) 
was approximately twice the incidence rate measured in placebo-treated subjects (3%). The duration 
of  the  blocks  were  longer  as  well  with  fingolimod.  In  most  subjects  receiving  fingolimod,  the  2nd 
degree  atrioventricular  blocks  occurred  within  6-8  hours  of  receiving  the  Day  1  dose,  when  the 
maximal  negative  chronotropic  effect  was  observed.  The  AV  blocks  were  typically  asymptomatic  and 
did not require treatment. No second degree Mobitz type II or wide complex 3rd degree heart blocks 
were observed. However, one subject received a supratherapeutic, single fingolimod dose of 15 mg on 
day  1  and  developed  within  several  hours,  a  2:1  and  transient  complete  heart  block  (CHB),  narrow 
QRS and rate of approximately 45 bpm. 
In  a  specific  study  in  healthy  volunteers,  fingolimod  treatment  at  1.25  and  2.5  mg  doses,  using  an 
escalating dosing schedule, resulted in a significant, mild prolongation of QTcI on Day 7, and the upper 
bound of the 90% CI was ≤13.0 ms.  
Pulmonary effects 
Fingolimod  treatment  with  single  or  multiple  doses  of  0.5  and  1.25 mg  for  two  weeks  was  not 
associated with a detectable increase in airway resistance as measured by FEV1 and forced expiratory 
flow rate (FEF) 25-75. However, single fingolimod doses ≥5 mg (10-fold the recommended dose) were 
associated with a dose-dependent increase in airway resistance.  
Fingolimod  treatment  with  multiple  doses  of  0.5,  1.25,  or  5 mg  was  not  associated  with  impaired 
oxygenation  or  oxygen  desaturation  with  exercise  or  an  increase  in  airway  responsiveness  to 
methacholine.  
Subjects on fingolimod treatment had a normal bronchodilator response to inhaled beta-agonists. 
In  a  specific  study  in  patients  with  moderate  asthma,  effect  on  pulmonary  function  was  observed  at 
doses higher than 0.5 mg. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  (absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  elimination)  of  fingolimod  has 
been studied in multiple sclerosis patients. PK comparisons between healthy volunteers subjects were 
carried out using fingolimod and fingolimod-P predose concentrations for the multiple sclerosis patients 
from phase II/III studies (D2201, D2301 and D2302). 
Bioequivalence was demonstrated between the clinical service formulation of 1.25 and 25 mg used in 
phase II and the final market image used in phase III of the renal transplant studies. 
No dosage adjustment is required for patient with renal impairment. A 14-fold increase of exposure to 
M3 was observed in severe renal impaired subjects but was not considered clinically relevant since this 
metabolite was pharmacologically inactive.  
Hepatic  impaired  subjects  were  not  sufficiently  investigated  to  allow  valid  dosing  recommendation  of 
use in this population. There were no data on exposure to fingolimod-P in subjects with mild/moderate 
hepatic  impairment.  The  exposure  to  fingolimod-P  was  increased  by  29%  in  subjects  with  severe 
hepatic impairment. Considering fingolimod is mainly eliminated via metabolism, a contraindication in 
severe  hepatic  impairment  and  a  warning  in  mild  to  moderate  to  moderate  hepatic  impairment  have 
been reflected in the SmPC.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not reveal any significant effect of gender nor age. However 
from  these  data,  no  conclusions  could  be  drawn  regarding  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  in  the  elderly 
population.  Due  to  the  lack  of  sufficient  information  in  this  population,  the  CHMP  accepted  the 
proposed  recommendation  that  Gilenya  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  aged  65  years  and 
over. 
There  are  limited  data  available  in  adolescent  population  that  included  7 children  above  11 years  of 
age with renal transplant. The comparison of these data to that of adult healthy volunteers is of limited 
relevance and no conclusions could be drawn regarding the pharmacokinetic profile in this population. 
This information has been reflected in the SmPC. 
There  were  no  significant  PK  differences  between  Caucasian  and  Japanese  subjects.  Additional 
population PK analyses in renal transplant and MS patients revealed no significant influence of ethnicity 
on  pre-dose  blood  concentrations  for  fingolimod.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  SmPC  adequately 
reflects this information. 
Co-administration  of  fingolimod  with  ketoconazole  resulted  in  an  1.7-fold  increase  in  fingolimod  and 
fingolimod-P exposure (AUC).  As further investigations on the role of CYP4F2/CYP3A4 are required, a 
cautionary  statement  concerning  potential  interactions  with  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (protease  inhibitors, 
azole  antifungals,  some  macrolides  such  as  clarithromycin  or telithromycin)  has  been  reflected  in  the 
SmPC. 
Co-administration  of  fingolimod  with  ciclosporin  did  not  elicit  any  clinically  relevant  change  in  the 
ciclosporin or fingolimod exposure. 
When  fingolimod  is  used  with  atenolol,  there  was  an  additional  15%  reduction  of  heart  rate  at 
fingolimod treatment initiation, an effect not seen with diltiazem. A  cautionary statement concerning 
treatment initiation with patients receiving beta blockers or other substances that may decrease heart 
rate  (class  Ia  and  III  antiarrhythmics,  calcium  channel  blockers  like  verapamil  or  diltiazem,  digoxin, 
anticholinesteratic agents or pilocarpine) has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Exposure-  response  relationship  modelling  in  patients  with  RRMS  showed  that  0.5  mg  dose  was  as 
beneficial as 1.25 mg dose.  
A dose-dependent decrease in lymphocyte count was observed. At doses equal or greater than 1 mg/ 
day,  reductions  around  70-80%  were  observed.  A  full  recovery  at  day  56  was  reported  for  doses  of 
0.125  and  0.25  mg.  Additionnally,  decrease  in  immune  responses  were  observed  using  different 
antigens. A contraindication of co-administration with anti-neoplastic, immunosuppressive or immune-
modulating therapies has been reflected in the SmPC together with a cautionary statement concerning 
switching patients from long-acting therapies with immune effects. In addition, the SmPC reflects that  
during  and  for  up  to  two  months  after  treatment  with  Gilenya,  vaccination  may  be  less  effective  and 
the use of live attenuated vaccines may carry a risk of infections and should therefore be avoided. On 
the  basis  of  the  available  data  to  date,  the  CHMP  recommended  to  further  investigate  the  risk  of 
immunodepression  by  monitoring  the  balance  between  Th1  effectors  and  T-regulators  in  a  post-
authorisation study. 
When  co-administered  with  inhaled  beta-agonist,  no  pharmacodynamic  interaction  was  reported  with 
the bronchodilator response. This has been reflected in the SmPC together with the findings related to 
effects on airway resistance and oxygenation. 
Considering  the  teratogenic  properties  of  fingolimod,  an  additional  study  evaluating  the  interaction 
between  fingolimod,  ethinyl  estradiol  and  levonorgestrel  was  performed  at  the  CHMP  request. 
Following this co-administration, no changes were observed neither in the oral contraceptives exposure 
nor in fingolimod and fingolimod P.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacological profile of fingolimod in human studies has been adequately documented 
and  meet  the  requirements  to  support  this  application.  Further  investigations  role  on  the  metabolism 
(role of CYP4F2/CYP3A4) and risk of immunodepression were requested by the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The following indication is initially applied for: disease-modifying therapy in adults for the treatment of 
patients  with  relapsing  multiple  sclerosis  to  reduce  the  frequency  of  relapses  and  to  delay  the 
progression of disability.  
The clinical development program comprises the following clinical studies: 
-  a  phase  II,  6  month,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  study  (D2201) 
evaluating efficacy and safety of fingolimod versus placebo in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. 
D2201 has an ongoing extension study (D2201E1). 
- a phase III, 24-month, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (D2301) 
evaluating efficacy and safety of fingolimod 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg administered orally once daily versus 
placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; 
-  a  phase  III,  12-month  double-blind,  randomised,    active-controlled,  parallel-group  study  (D2302) 
evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  0.5  mg  and  1.25  mg  fingolimod    administered  orally  once  daily 
versus  interferon  β-1a  (Avonex®)  administered  i.m.  once  weekly  in  patients  with  relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis; 
Another  study  (D2309)  is  currently  ongoing.  This  study  is  a  24-month  double-blind,  randomised, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group  evaluating the efficacy and safety of 0.5 and 1.25 mg of fingolimod 
administered orally once daily versus placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
One dose ranging study (D2201) using 5mg and  1.25 mg was performed including a total number of 
randomised  patients  of  187  patients  (n=94  for  fingolimod  groups,  n=93  for  placebo  group).  The 
population  studied  was  representative  of  the  MS  population  (RRMS,  SPMS)  with  70%  of  women  and 
98.2%  of  Caucasian  patients.  The  mean  age  was  around  38,  the  mean  duration  of  disease  was  8.8 
years and patients had two relapses in the previous two years.  
A  significant  improvement  in  MRI  measures  and  relapses-related  clinical  endpoints  was  observed  in 
fingolimod treated patients with relapsing MS. The total cumulative numbers of lesions per patient on 
post-baseline, monthly gadolinium-enhanced, T1 lesions were lower in both fingolimod groups than in 
placebo  group.  These  results  were  highly  statistically  significant  (p<0.001  for  the  1.25  mg  dose  and 
p=0.006  for  the  5  mg  dose).  There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  two 
fingolimod  treatment  groups.  The  analysis  using  the  ITT  population  leads  to  similar  results  and 
statistical significance to that seen with the evaluable population. 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  number  of  post-baseline  T1  weighted  lesions  in 
both fingolimod dose groups (1.25 mg and 5 mg) in the RRMS population. There was no reduction in 
both fingolimod groups as compared to placebo in the small SPMS population. However, this group was 
small (7 and 10 patients in the fingolimod 1.25 mg and 5 mg groups respectively and 7 patients in the 
placebo  group);  moreover  in  this  sub-group,  a  reduction in  the  number  of  post-baseline  T1  weighted 
lesions was observed.

At 6 months, the proportion of patients who were free of Gadolinium-enhanced lesions was greater in 
both  fingolimod  groups  (1.25  mg  and  5  mg)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (77%  and  82%  respectively 
versus 47%). The number of relapse free patients was significantly increased in both fingolimod groups 
(p=0.007  and  p=0.008  for  fingolimod  1.25  mg  versus  placebo  and  fingolimod  5  mg  versus  placebo 
comparisons respectively). The time to first relapse was increased in the two fingolimod groups versus 
placebo (p=0.007 for the 1.25 mg fingolimod group and p=0.012 for the 5 mg fingolimod group versus 
placebo). The annualized relapse rate was reduced in the fingolimod 1.25 mg group (0.35; p=0.009) 
and in the 5 mg fingolimod group (0.36; p=0.014) compared to placebo (0.77).   
At  6  months,  no  significant  differences  between  fingolimod  groups  and  placebo  were  observed  in  the 
change from baseline for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and MSFC z score. 
A dose response effect between 1.25 mg and 5 mg was not clearly observed. The 5 mg dose was no 
longer tested in phase III as it showed no efficacy benefit over the 1.25 mg dose and was associated 
with a less favourable safety profile.

randomization,  with  an  Expanded  Disability  Status  Scale  (EDSS)  score  of  0  to  5.5  inclusive  and 
neurologically  stable  with  no  evidence  of  relapse  or  corticosteroid  treatment  within  30  days  prior  to 
randomisation.

infarction within the 6 months prior to enrolment, history of angina pectoris, cardiac failure at time of 
screening, history of cardiac arrest, symptomatic bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome or sino-atrial heart 
block,  or  positive  tilt  test  from  workup  for  vasovagal  syncope,  resting  pulse  rate  <  55  bpm  prior  to 
randomization,  history  or  presence  of  a  second  degree  AV  block  or  a  third  degree  AV  block  or  an

medication);  any  pulmonary  disease  (especially  severe  respiratory  disease  or  pulmonary  fibrosis, 
tuberculosis, abnormal pulmonary function tests, asthma); white blood cell (WBC) count < 3,500/mm3 
(< 3.5 x 109/ L); lymphocyte count < 800/mm3 (< 0.8 x 109/ L). 
Treatments 
Fingolimod was given for 24 months at an oral dose of 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg (capsules). Patients were 
randomised to one of the three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. They received fixed one-a-day doses 
of study medication with no adjustment permitted. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives were to compare two doses of fingolimod (1.25 mg and 0.5 mg) with placebo 
and  to  demonstrate  that  at  least  1.25  mg  fingolimod  is  superior  to  placebo  in  terms  of  annualized 
relapse  rate  (ARR)  in  patients  treated  for  up  to  24  months.  This  was  measured  by  the  number  of 
confirmed relapses per year over 24 months.  
The key secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of fingolimod 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg relative to 
placebo on disability progression as measured by the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression 
in patients treated for up to 24 months. This was measured using the Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS).

Other  secondary  objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of fingolimod (1.25 and 0.5 
mg) compared to placebo in patients with RRMS treated up to 24 months and to determine the effects 
of fingolimod (1.25 mg and 0.5 mg) compared to placebo on a number of endpoints mainly related to 
relapses, disability progression and inflammatory disease activity. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary outcome measure 
Aggregate annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 24 months. 
Secondary outcome measures 
The key secondary endpoint was the 3-month confirmed disability progression up to 24 months ( 
Other secondary endpoints included: 
-  MRI  variables:  number  of  new  and  newly  enlarged  T2  lesions,  proportion  of  patients  free  of 
new/newly enlarged T2 lesions, proportion of patients free of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions, number of Gd-
enhancing  T1  lesions,  volume  of  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions,  proportion  of  patients  free  of  new 
inflammatory  activity  (no  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  and  no  new/  newly  enlarged  T2  lesions),  change 
and percent change from baseline in volume of T2 lesions, change and percent change from baseline in 
volume of T1 hypointense lesions, percent change from baseline in brain volume (atrophy). 
-  Relapses  variables:  time  to  first  relapse,  time  to  second  relapse,  frequency  of  corticosteroid  use  to 
treat relapses, frequency of hospitalizations due to relapses, proportion of relapse free patients. 
-  Additional  endpoints:  severity  of  relapses,  impact  on  daily  activities,  recovery  status,  duration  of 
relapse. 
- Disability progression-related variables: time to 6-month confirmed disability progression as, change 
from baseline on EDSS and the MSFC z-score to the end of the study. 
Sample size 
The  power  calculations  for  the  primary  endpoint  are  based  on  the  Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney  rank  sum 
test  to  compare  the  1.25  mg  vs.  placebo  using  the  hierarchical  method  to  adjust  for  multiplicity. 
Assuming that the annualized relapse rate at 24 months is 0.7 for placebo and 0.42 for fingolimod1.25 
mg arm, the relative reduction is 40%. Based on data from the Phase II study FTYD2201, its extension 
phase  and  other  historical  data  for  other  MS  treatment  studies,  the  common  standard  deviation  is 
assumed to be 1.06. With these assumptions, 416 patients per arm would provide 95% power at the 
two-sided significance level of 0.05. A simulation study confirmed that the sample size of 416 per arm 
would provide an adequate power for the primary efficacy analysis. 
The sample size and power calculations were assuming an absolute difference of 12% in the proportion 
of progressing patients at 24 months (30% of patients progressing in the placebo arm and 18% in the 
fingolimod  arms).  The  sample  size  required  for  each  treatment  group  was  312  using  a  0.05  level  of 
two-sided log-rank test for equality of survival curves with a power of 93%, assuming there were no 
drop-outs before month 24. It was planned to randomise a total of 1250 patients, i.e., approximately 
416 patients per arm, to allow for a drop-out rate of approximately 25% at 24 months.

Randomisation 
At  Visit  2,  all  patients  who  fulfill  all  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  will  be  given  the  lowest  available 
number  on  the  randomization  list.  This  number  assigns  them  to  one  of  the  treatment  arms.  The 
investigator or designated study personnel will enter the randomization number on the respective Case 
Report  Form.  A  randomization  list  will  be  produced  by  or  under  the  responsibility  of  Novartis  Drug 
Supply  Management  using  a  validated  system  that  automates  the  random  assignment  of  treatment 
arms to randomization numbers in the specified ratio.  
Blinding (masking) 
Study medication assignments were blinded for the entire double-blind treatment phase and remained 
blinded  until  the  database  lock  and  data  analysis  for  the  double-blind  treatment  phase  had  been 
completed.  Unblinding  only  occurred  in  the  case  of  patient  emergencies  and  at  the  conclusion  of  the 
double-blind  phase.  Emergency  unblinding  was  only  to  be  done  when  necessary  in  order  to  treat  the 
patient.  
Statistical methods 
Only  confirmed  relapses  were  considered  for  the  primary  analysis  and  were  defined  as  “relapse 
accompanied by an increase of at least half a step (0.5) on the EDSS or an increase of 1 point on two 
different functional Systems (FS) of the EDSS or 2 points on one of the FS (excluding Bowel/Bladder or 
Cerebral  FS)”.  The  primary  null  hypotheses  to  be  tested  were:  1)  there  is  no  difference  in  the  ARRs 
between  patients  treated  with  fingolimod  1.25  mg  and  placebo,  and  2)  there  is  no  difference  in  the 
ARRs between patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg and placebo. 
Efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT population, all randomized patients who had received at 
least one dose of treatment. Per-protocol population (PP) was only used for the supportive analyses of 
the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The  test  of  the  hypotheses  (p-value)  was  performed  based  on  a  negative  binomial  regression  model 
adjusting  for  treatment  group,  country,  baseline  number  of  relapses  in  the  previous  2  years,  and 
baseline EDSS as covariates, in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Two types of supportive analyses 
were provided for the primary endpoint: 1) negative binomial regression model using the per-protocol 
population  and  2)  rank  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  on  patient-level  ARR  using  ITT  population. 
Both models used the same covariates as the primary efficacy analysis. 
The  key  secondary  endpoint  was  compared  by  means  of  the  log-rank  test.  Cox  regression  with 
covariates  of  treatment,  country,  baseline  EDSS  and  age  was  performed  as  well.  Proportions  of 
disability free patients at 12 and 24 months were obtained using the Kaplan–Meier method. 
To control the overall type-I error rate of the study, the testing of fingolimod comparisons vs. placebo 
was performed in a hierarchical order as follows: fingolimod 1.25 mg (ARR); fingolimod 0.5 mg (ARR); 
fingolimod  1.25  mg  (3-month  disability  progression)  and  fingolimod  0.5  mg  (3-month  disability 
progression).  Each  testing  was  performed  at  a  significant  level  of  0.05  for  these  four  comparisons. 
However,  the  lower-rank  testing  was  performed  only  when  every  high-rank  testing  was  statistically 
significant. 
ARR  for  all  relapses  (confirmed  and  unconfirmed)  was  analyzed  similarly  to  the  primary  efficacy 
variable. For time to first relapse and time to second relapse, log-rank test and Cox regression with the 
same  covariates  as  in  the  primary  analysis  were  used.  The  proportion  of  relapse-free  patients  was

obtained from the Kaplan–Meier method. Fisher’s exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used for 
testing treatment differences for relapse characteristics. 
For  other  efficacy  disability-related  and  EDSS,  log-rank  test  and  Cox  regression  with  the  same 
covariates  as  in  the  key  secondary  analysis  were  used.  The  proportion  of  disability  progression-free 
patients  was  obtained  from  the  Kaplan–Meier  method.  Change  from  baseline  to  the  end  of  study  for 
EDSS, and change from baseline to the end of study for the MSFC z-score and subscales were analyzed 
using rank ANCOVA with covariates of treatment, country, the corresponding baseline value, and age. 
For the proportion type of MRI endpoints, the treatment comparisons were performed using the logistic 
regression  model  adjusting  for  treatment,  country,  and  the  corresponding  baseline  value  (when 
available). The number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions was analyzed using negative binomial model 
adjusted  for  treatment  and  country.  For  the  other  MRI  endpoints  (number  and  total  volume  of  Gd-
enhanced T1 lesions, change and percent change from baseline in total volume of T2 lesions, change 
and  percent  change  from  baseline  in  total  volume  of  T1  hypointense  lesions,  percent  change  from 
baseline  in  brain  volume),  rank  ANCOVA  with  covariates  treatment,  country,  and  corresponding 
baseline values (when available) were used for treatment comparisons.

Among the 292 patients who were assessed for eligibility but were not enrolled, some were excluded for more than 
one reason. For one patient receiving 1.25 mg of fingolimod faily who completed the study while receiving the study 
drug, the status was incorrectly recorded by the investigator as having discontinued the study while still receiving the 
study drug. Patients who discontinued the study drug include those who discontinued the study; the correct status is 
shown here.

Recruitment 
Study period was from 26 January 2006 to 30 July 2009. 
Conduct of the study 
Out  of  the  10  protocol  amendments,  4  were  related  to  study  design  and  evaluation.  These  included 
changes  in  the  eligibility  criteria  (revised  McDonald  criteria),  sample  size  (increased)  and  statistical 
plan analysis (use of the negative binomial regression according to CHMP scientific advice). 
Overall,  3.6%  of  patients  had  protocol  deviations  which  excluded  them  from  the  PP  population.The 
proportion  of  patients  was  4.4%  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  group,  3.3%  in  the  fingolimod  0.5  mg 
group and 3.6% in the placebo group.

Numbers analysed 
In total, 100% of randomized patients were included in the ITT and Safety populations.  
Table 6 
A total of 17 (1.3%) patients were excluded from the PP population due to treatment code unblinding 
(not  necessarily  protocol  deviations):  4  (0.9%)  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  group,  6  (1.4%)  in  the 
fingolimod 0.5 mg group and 7 (1.7%) in the placebo group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome measure 
Results are summarised in Table 7. 
Table 7.  Aggregate ARR up to Month 24 (confirmed relapses only) (ITT population) 
Aggregate ARR related to group-level annualized relapse rate. 
Aggregate ARR estimate (95% CI), ARR ratio, and p-value are calculated using negative binomial regression 
adjusted by treatment, country, number of relapses in the previous 2 years, and baseline EDSS. 
Log (time of study) is the offset variable. 
*Indicates two-sided statistical significance at 0.05 level. 
Results of the two supportive analyses (confirmed relapses for PP population and patient level ARR for 
ITT population) were consistent and confirm results in ITT population.

Table 8. Proportion of patients free of disability progression at Month 24 (ITT population) 
Abbreviation: CI = Confidence interval 
P value for proportion of patients free of progression was calculated using log-rank test. P-value for hazard ratio 
was calculated using Cox’s proportional hazards model adjusted for treatment, country, baseline EDSS and age. 
* Indicates two-sided statistical significance at 0.05 level. 
In  the  two  fingolimod  groups,  the  time  to  a  first  relapse  was  increased  as  compared  to  placebo 
(p<0.001). The risk reduction in relapses over 2 years was 62% for the fingolimod 1.25 mg group and 
52% for the fingolimod 0.5 mg group compared to placebo. 
The  percentage  of  patients  who  did  not  have  confirmed  relapse  during  the  study  was  highest  in  the 
fingolimod treatment groups (75.5% and 71.1%, for 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg, respectively) compared to 
the placebo group (47.8%). The percentage of patients who had 2 or more relapses was highest in the 
placebo  group  (21.5%)  compared  with  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg  treatment  groups  (7.0% 
and 8.2%, respectively).  
Overall  there  was  no  substantial  difference  between  the  two  fingolimod  doses  in  the  percentages  of 
patients  who  had  no  relapse,  or  at  least  1  or  2  confirmed  relapses.  These  findings  were  consistent 
when  taking  all  relapses  (both  confirmed  and  unconfirmed)  into  consideration.  The  total  steroid  dose 
and number of hospitalizations due to relapses are lower in the treated groups as compared to placebo.

The  proportion  of  patients  free  of  3-month  confirmed  disability  progression  was  greater  in  the  two 
fingolimod  groups  (83.4%  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  group,  82.3%  in  the  fingolimod  0.5  mg  group 
versus  75.9%  in  the  placebo  group).  The  reduction  of  progression  of  disability  was  small,  which  is 
expected taking into account that less than 24% of progression in the placebo group). 
The proportion of patients free of 6-month confirmed progression was higher in the fingolimod groups 
compared to placebo (88.5% for 1.25 mg, 87.5% for 0.5 mg and 81% for placebo).Regarding disability 
progression  that  was  confirmed  at  6  month,  the  risk  was  also  reduced  with  fingolimod  over  the  24-
month study period. The hazard ratio were 0.60 [95% CI: 0.41, 0.86, p=0.004] aand 0.63 [95% CI: 
0.44, 0.90, p=0.011] for 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg doses, respectively. 
Patients in either fingolimod group had significantly fewer new or enlarged lesions on T2 lesions at 6, 
12  and  24  months  (p<0.001  for  all  comparisons).  The  proportion  of  patients  free  of  new  /newly 
enlarged  T2  lesions  at  24  months  compared  to  baseline  was  more  important  in  patients  in  the 
fingolimod groups (51.9% and 50.5% at 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg) than in the placebo group (21.2%).  
Patients  in  both  fingolimod  groups  had  significantly  fewer  Gadolinium-enhancing  lesions  than  in  the 
placebo  group  at  6,  12  and  24  months  (p<0.001  for  all  comparisons).At  these  time  points,  the 
proportion  of  patients  free  of  Gadolinium-enhancing  T1  lesions  was  greater  in  the  fingolimod  groups 
compared to placebo. At 24 month, this proportion was 89.8% at 1.25 mg and 89.7% at 0.5 mg and 
65.1% in the placebo group. 
The  median  volume  of  lesions  on  T2  decreased  between  baseline  and  month  24  with  both  doses  of 
fingolimod but increased with placebo. 
Reduction in brain volume was smaller and statistically significant in the fingolimod groups (- 0.885 at 
1.25  mg  and  –  0.843  at  0.5  mg)  as  compared  to  placebo  group  (-1.306)  over  the  24  month  study 
period. 
2.5.2.2.  Study D2302 
This  was  a  12  month  double-blind,  randomised,  active-controlled,  parallel-group  study  evaluating  the 
efficacy and safety of fingolimod 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg administered orally once daily versus interferon 
beta-1a  (Avonex)  administered  i.m.  once  weekly    in  patients  with  relapsing  -remitting  multiple 
sclerosis with an optional extension phase (see Figure 4).

The  study  was  conducted  in  a  number  of  European  countries  and  also  in  non  EU  regions  (e.g 
Switzerland, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Argentina, Egypt, Korea and the United States). 
2.5.2.2.1.  Methods 
Study Participants 
Main inclusion criteria 
The  inclusion  criteria  were  the  same  as  for  those  for  the  D2301  study  except  that  patients  on 
treatment  with  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  or  glatiramer  acetate  could  be  randomised  without  a  wash-
period. 
Main exclusion criteria 
The exclusion criteria were the same  as for those for the D2301 study except the following exclusion 
criteria were added: history of epileptic seizures within 3 months of randomization, episode of severe 
depression within 3 months of randomization and relevant history of suicide attempt or patients who, 
in the opinion of the investigator, were at risk of suicide attempt. 
Treatments 
Randomised  patients  were  assigned  in  a  ratio  of  1:1:1  in  a  double-dummy  design  to  receive: 
Fingolimod  0.5  mg  orally  once  daily  plus  once-weekly  i.m.  interferon  beta-1a  matching  placebo 
Fingolimod 1.25 mg orally once daily plus once-weekly i.m. interferon beta-1a matching placebo. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare two doses of fingolimod (1.25 mg and 0.5 mg) with interferon 
beta-1a i.m. to demonstrate that at least 1.25 mg fingolimod is superior to interferon beta-1a i.m. in 
terms of annualized relapse rate (ARR) in patients treated for up to 12 months. This was measured by 
the number of confirmed relapses per year over 12 months. 
The  key  secondary  objectives  were  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  fingolimod  1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg 
over  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  in  patients  with  RRMS  treated  for  up  to  12  months  on  the  following 
endpoints:  time  to  3-month  confirmed  disability  progression  and  number  of  new/  newly  enlarged  T2 
lesions. 
Other  secondary  objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of fingolimod 1.25 mg and 
0.5 mg compared to interferon beta-1a i.m. in patients with RRMS treated for up to 12 months and to 
determine  the  effects  of  fingolimod  (1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg)  compared  to  interferon  beta-1a  i.m  on  a 
number of endpoints mainly related to relapses and inflammatory disease activity.

The two key secondary variables were the 3-month confirmed disability progression and the number of 
new/newly enlarged T2 lesions at 12 months.  
Other secondary endpoints included: 
-  MRI  variables:  proportion  of  patients  free  of  Gd-enhanced  T1  lesions,  proportion  of  patients  free  of 
new  or  newly  enlarged  T2  lesions  at  12  months,  number  of  Gd-enhanced  T1  lesions,  volume  of  Gd 
enhanced  T1  lesions,  proportion  of  patients  free  of  new  inflammatory  activity  (Gd-enhanced  lesions 
and new/ newly enlarged T2 lesions), change and % change from baseline in volume of T2 lesions at 
12  months,  change  and  %  change  from  baseline  in  volume  of  T1  hypointense  lesions  at  12  months, 
normalized brain volume at baseline and percent brain volume change from baseline at 12 months 
- Relapses variables: proportion of relapse-free patients  
-  Disability  progression-related  variables:  proportion  of  patients  with  3-month  confirmed  disability 
progression,  time  to  confirmed  disability  progression  sustained  until  last  observation,  time  to  severe 
disability (EDSS score ≥6.0), EDSS score, MSFC z-score, MSFC subscales. 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation used the Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney rank sum test to compare the fingolimod 
1.25  mg  group  with  the  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  group.  The  ARRs  for  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  and 
fingolimod  1.25  mg  group  were  assumed  to  be  0.55  and  0.33,  respectively (relative  reduction  40%). 
The  common  standard  deviation  (SD)  was  assumed  to  be  0.9.  With  these  assumptions,  368  patients 
per group would provide 90% power at the two-sided significance level of 0.05. Based on drop-out rate 
from  study  D2201,  57  patients  (15.5%)  were  added  to  each  group.  Therefore,  a  total  sample  size  of 
1275 was required (425 patients per group). 
The  mean  (SD)  for  the  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarged  T2  lesions  at  Month  12  for  the  interferon 
beta-1a i.m. group was chosen as 2.4 (4.1). It was assumed that the fingolimod 1.25 mg group would 
have  an  effect  size  of  25%  on  the  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarged  T2  lesions  at  12  Month  vs. 
interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  (i.e.  the  mean  is  1.375  or 25%  of  2.4).  With  the  sample  size  of  368  patients 
completing the 12-month study, the power to detect a treatment difference for the fingolimod 1.25 mg 
group vs. the interferon beta-1a i.m. group was 90% using a conservative Wilcoxon rank-sum test at a 
two-sided 0.05 significance level. 
It  was  also  assumed  that  15%  of  patients  in  the  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  group  would  have  3-month 
confirmed disability progression. With 425 randomized patients and 57 dropout patients in each group 
(exponentially distributed), assuming the 12-month progression rate for the fingolimod group was 12% 
(a  relative  reduction  of  20%  from  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.),  the  power  for  detecting  a  treatment 
difference was 22% using a log-rank test at a two-sided 0.05 significance level. 
Randomisation 
At  the  Visit  3,  all  eligible  patients  will  be  assigned  a  randomization  number  by  the  IVRS  that  assigns 
them to one of the treatment arms. The investigator or designated study personnel will call the IVRS 
and  confirm  that  the  patient  fulfills  all  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  The  IVRS  will  assign  a 
randomization number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will 
specify a unique medication number for the first package of study drug to be dispensed to the patient 
(The randomization number is not communicated to the caller). A randomization list will be produced 
by  the  IVRS  provider  using  a  validated  system  that  automates  the  random  assignment  of  patient 
numbers  to  randomization  numbers.  These  randomization  numbers  are  linked  to  the  different

treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication randomization 
list  will  be  produced  by  or  under  the  responsibility  of  Novartis  Drug  Supply  Management  using  a 
validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to medication packs 
containing each of the study drugs. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study medication assignments were blinded for the entire double-blind treatment phase and remained 
blinded  until  the  data  base  lock  and  data  analysis  for  the  double-blind  treatment  phase  had  been 
completed. In order to maintain the blind, patients were instructed to cover injection sites (e.g. with a 
plaster  or  appropriate  clothing  to  completely  cover  the  injection  sites)  before  all  scheduled  visits  and 
relapse-related neurologic examinations and not to discuss AEs (e.g. injection site reactions or flu-like 
symptoms) with the independent evaluating physician. Unblinding only occurred in the case of patient 
emergencies and at the conclusion of the double-blind phase. 
Statistical methods 
Only confirmed relapses were considered for the primary analysis. The primary null hypotheses to be 
tested  were:  1)  there  is  no  difference  in  the  ARRs  between  patients  treated  with  the  fingolimod  1.25 
mg  and  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.,  and  2)  there  is  no  difference  in  the  ARRs  between  patients  treated 
with  the  FTY720  0.5  mg  and  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  The  test  of  the  hypotheses  (p-value)  was 
performed  based  on  a  negative  binomial  regression  model  adjusting  for  treatment  group,  country, 
baseline number of relapses in the previous 2 years, and baseline EDSS as covariates, in the intent-to-
treat (ITT) population. 
Two types of supportive analyses were provided for the primary endpoint: 1) Per-protocol analysis was 
done  with  the  negative  binomial  regression  model  adjusting  for  treatment  group,  country,  baseline 
number  of  relapses  in  the  previous  2  years  and  baseline  EDSS  as  covariates  for  the  primary  efficacy 
variable.  2) Rank  Analysis  of Covariance  (ANCOVA)  using  treatment  group,  country,  baseline  number 
of  relapses  in  the  previous  2  years,  and  baseline  EDSS  as  covariates  was  used  with  the  ARR  as  the 
response variable. 
The number of new or newly enlarged T2 lesions at Month 12, in treatment groups (fingolimod versus 
interferon beta-1a i.m) was compared using a negative binomial model adjusting for treatment group, 
country, baseline number of relapses in the previous 2 years, and baseline EDSS.  
The  time  to  3-  month  confirmed  disability  progression  up  to  12  months  was  analyzed  using  the 
Kaplan–Meier  method  and  compared  by  means  of  the  log-rank  test.  Cox  regression  with  the  same 
covariates as in the primary analyses was performed as well. 
To control the overall type-I error rate of the study, the testing of FTY720 comparisons vs. interferon 
beta-1a  i.m.  was  performed  in  a  hierarchical  order  as  follows:  fingolimod  1.25  mg  (ARR);fingolimod 
0.5  mg  (ARR);  fingolimod  1.25  mg  (number  of  new  and  newly  enlarged  T2  lesions  at  12  months), 
fingolimod  0.5  mg  (number  of  new  and  newly  enlarged  T2  lesions  at  12  months),  fingolimod  1.25 
mg,(3  month  disability  progression)  and  fingolimod  0.5  mg  (3  month  disability  progression).  Each 
testing was performed at a significant level of 0.05 for these six comparisons. However, the lower-rank 
testing was performed only when every high-rank testing was statistically significant. 
Other efficacy relapse variables were analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy variable. Log-rank test 
and  Cox  regression  with  the  same  covariates  as  in  the  primary  analyses  were  used  for  the  time  to 
event variables. The proportion of relapse-free patients was compared between treatment groups with 
logistic  regression  adjusting  for  country,  baseline  relapse  rate  in  the  previous  2  years  and  baseline 
EDSS.

For  other  efficacy  disability-related  and  EDSS  variables,  both  the  naïve  estimate  of  the  proportions, 
regardless  of  when  a  patient  dropped  out  and  the  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  at  12  months  were  used. 
Wilcoxon rank sum test as well as ANCOVA on ranks were performed to compare the EDSS and MSFC 
z-scores at 12 months as well as the change from baseline between the treatment groups. 
For the proportion type of MRI endpoints, the treatment comparisons were performed using the logistic 
regression  model  adjusting  for  treatment,  country,  and  the  corresponding  baseline  number  of  lesions 
(when available). For the other MRI endpoints, summary statistics of actual values and changes from 
baseline were presented. Wilcoxon rank sum test and rank ANCOVA with covariates treatment, country, 
and corresponding baseline values (when available) were used for treatment comparisons.

Recruitment 
Study period was from 30 May 2006 to 11 November 2008. 
Conduct of the study 
Out  of  the  10  protocol  amendments,  5  were  related  to  study  design  and  evaluation.    These  included 
change  in  the  eligibility  criteria  (stricter  requirements  for  monitoring  and  prevention  of  pregnancies), 
statistical plan analysis (use of the negative binomial regression according to CHMP scientific advice). 
Overall,  3.7%  of  patients  had  protocol  deviations  which  excluded  them  from  the  PP  population.The 
proportion  of  patients  was  5.8%  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  group,  3.0%  in  the  fingolimod  0.5  mg 
group and 2.9% in the interferon beta-1a group.

Numbers analysed 
In  total,  99%  of  randomized  patients  were  included  in  the  ITT.  The  ITT  and  Safety  populations  were 
identical.  The  PP  population  included  all  ITT  patients  who  did  not  have  any  major  protocol  deviations 
and  96%  of  randomized  patients  were  included  in  this  population.  Overall,  12  (0.9%)  patients  were 
excluded from both the ITT and Safety populations because they were randomized in error and did not 
receive study drug (see Table 11).

* Indicates two-sided statistical significance at 0.05 level. 
Results of the two supportive analyses (confirmed relapses for PP population and patient level ARR for 
ITT population) were consistent and confirm results in ITT population. 
There  was  no  difference  in  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  regardless  age,  sex,  previous 
treatment or treatment naïve or EDSS at baseline. 
The  time  to  first  confirmed  relapse  was  prolonged  in  both  fingolimod  treatment  groups  compared  to 
interferon beta-1a i.m. 
The proportion of patients who were relapse-free at 12 months was higher in the fingolimod treatment 
groups (79.8% for fingolimod 1.25 mg and 82.6% for fingolimod 0.5 mg treatment groups) compared 
to  the  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  group  (69.3%)  and  this  difference  is  statistically  significant.The 
proportion  of  patients  who  did  not  have  a  confirmed  relapse  during  the  study  was  statistically 
significantly  higher  in  the  fingolimod  treatment  groups  compared  to  the  interferon  beta-1a  i.m. 
group.There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  fingolimod  treatment  groups 
(p=0.413).

There  were  less  relapses  in  the  two  fingolimod  treatment  groups  than  in  the  interferon  beta-1a  i.m. 
group.  
There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  3-month  confirmed 
disability progression as measured by EDSS among the three treatment groups for the ITT population.  
There  was  a  significant  improvement  in  the  mean  MSFC  z-score  and  MSFC  subscale  (PASAT-3)  at 
month 12 in both fingolimod groups compared to the baseline as compared to interferon beta-1a. 
At  12  months,  the  proportion  of  patients  free  of  Gadolinium-enhanced  T1  lesions  was  significantly 
reduced in both fingolimod groups (90.1% at 0.5 mg and 91.2% at 1.25 mg) compared to interferon 
beta-1a group (80.8%). The mean number and mean volume of Gd-enhanced T1 lesions at Month 12 
were  also  statistically  significantly  lower  in  the  FTY720  treatment  groups  compared  to  the  interferon 
beta-1a  i.m.  group  (p<0.001).  No  significant  change  for  the  0.5  mg  dose  was  observed  in  the  total 
volume  of  T1  hypointense  lesions  as  compared  to  interferon  beta-1a.  There  was  a  statistically 
significant lower reduction in brain volume in both fingolimod groups (-0.297 at 1.25 mg and -0.307 at 
0.5 mg) compared to interferon beta-1a group (-0.400). 
At  12  months,  mean  changes  from  baseline  on  PRIMUS-QoL  and  UFIS,  EQ-5D  utility scores  were  not 
statistically  significantly  different  among  the  three  treatment  groups.  For  all  three  treatment  groups, 
changes from baseline in EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale score at Month 12 were small (0.6 to 1.9) and not 
statistically significantly different. 
At 6 months, mean change from baseline scores on UFIS score for the fingolimod 0.5 mg group (-1.01) 
was  statistically  significantly  lower  compared  to  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  (0.84;  p=0.042);  the  mean 
change  from  baseline  in  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  group  (0.21)  was  also  lower  compared  to  interferon

Additional  post-hoc  analyses  on  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints    for  studies  D2301  and  D2302 
were performed taking into account previous treatment with MS drugs (interferons, glatiramer acetate), 
duration and discontinuation of prior MS treatment due to lack of efficacy or AEs.

A  multivariate  analysis  aiming  at  identifying  potential  interacting  factors  with  treatment  efficacy  was 
conducted. In both studies, a decrease in relapse rates and a reduction of the effect of fingolimod was 
observed  with  increasing  age.  Nonetheless,  no  reduction  of  the  effects  of  fingolimod  with  increasing 
age is observed on EDSS score nor on new/newly enlarged T2 lesions in study 2301, thus no additional 
information concerning elderly population in the SmPC is required at this point time. 
Additional post-hoc analyses on primary and secondary endpoints for studies D2301 and D2302 were 
also performed for different subgroups of patients, as defined by the applicant during the evaluation. 
At CHMP request, the subgroup analysis related to high disease activity (as defined by patients with 2 
or more relapses in the prior year and 1 more Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline) was also presented. 
Results are provided in the following tables. For the subgroup analyses, a simpler model was used that 
included only treatment and subgroup and a treatment*subgroup interaction. The overall mean of ARR 
ratio for fingolimod 0.5 mg dose versus placebo was therefore 0.44 in this model.

2.5.2.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Data  from  studies  D2301  and  D2302  were  pooled  for  analyses  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  the 
ARR,  specifically  for  subgroups  (Gd  lesions  at  baseline:  equal  to  0,  ≥1,  number  of  relapses  in  two 
years  prior  to  study  entry:  ≤2,  ≥3,  treatment  naïve  patients,  previously  treated  patients).  Otherwise 
no  pooling  of  data  across  studies  was  performed.    Results  were  consistent  with  those  of  the  two 
studies  (D2301  and  D2302).  Each  individual  study  was  strongly  demonstrative,  and  the  submitted 
pooled  analysis  did  not  add  significant  knowledge  as  compared  to  both  studies  being  considered 
separately (see Tables 21 and 22). 
Table 21 Aggregate ARR by age, gender and treatment (pooled ITT population) 
p-value was to compare the treatment difference by subgroup based on a negative binomial regression model 
adjusted for study. No other covariates were included in the model.

Additionally,  data  from  the  Phase  II  extension  study  (D2201E1)  and  Phase  III  D2301  and  D2302 
studies were pooled to evaluate the efficacy after withdrawal and possible rebound effect. This analysis 
included all patients from studies D2301, D2302, and D2201E1 who received a cumulative dose of at 
least  3  months  and  had  any  follow-up data  beyond  14  days  after  study  drug  discontinuation.  Results

2.5.2.6.  Clinical studies in special populations 
No trials have been performed in any special multiple sclerosis patient populations. 
2.5.2.7.  Supportive studies 
D2201E1 is an ongoing extension study of the phase II D2201. All patients who completed the Month 6 
visit  were  eligible  to  enter  the  extension  study.  The  objectives  were  to  evaluate  long-term  effects  of 
fingolimod on efficacy related outcomes and collect long-term safety and tolerability data. 
The  extension  consisted  of  two  phases:  a  double-blind  treatment  phase  and  an  open-label  treatment 
phase  (lasting  until  the  drug  becomes  available  on  the  market  in  the  specific  country  or  until  drug 
development discontinuation).  
During the blinded phase, all patients received four capsules per dose administration, i.e. patients on 
fingolimod  1.25  mg  received  1  x  fingolimod  1.25  mg  capsule  plus  3  x  matching  placebo  capsules, 
patients on fingolimod 5.0 mg received 4 x fingolimod 1.25 mg capsules. After switching all patients to 
fingolimod 1.25 mg, all patients received one capsule per day. 
Patients  who  were  randomized  to  fingolimod  1.25  mg  or  5.0  mg  qd  in  the  core  study  kept  the  same 
randomization number as in the core study and continued on the same dose of fingolimod during the 
first 6 months of the extension. Patients who were randomized to placebo in the core study were re-
randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  fingolimod  1.25  mg  or  5.0  mg  qd  during  the  initial  double-blind 
phase  of  the  extension.  After  all  patients  had  completed  the  Month  12  visit  (6  months  core  plus  6

months  extension),  treatment  with  fingolimod  5.0 mg  was  discontinued  and  all  patients  were  offered 
open-label treatment with fingolimod 1.25 mg. 
Results from the interim analysis at month 60 was submitted as part of the present application and are 
presented below. 
Table 26 Patients free of Gd-enhanced T1 weighted lesions by visit (ITT population, 60

A patient was defined as free of lesions if there were zero lesions. 
** Patients were on placebo up to Month 6. 
N* = number of patients with information recorded at visit. n = patients free of Gd-enhanced lesions. % =

1. A patient is defined as free of lesions if there were zero lesions. 
2. N* = Number of patients with T2 information recorded at scan. n = Number of patients free of new T2-weighted 
lesions. % = (n/N*)x100 
3. New T2 lesions at a specific visit are assessed relative to the previous visit scan. Exception: New T2 lesions at 
Month 24 were assessed relative to the Month 12 scan. 
4. Month 1-6 refers to the sum of all new T2-weighted lesions at Month 1 to Month 6 (the sum is missing if one of 
the assessments is missing). A patient is free of new T2-weighted lesions at Month 1-6, if the sum is zero. 
Table 28 Number of patients free from any inflammatory activity 
At Month 6, the percent of patients free from any inflammatory activity (i.e. had no new T2-weighted and no Gd-
enhanced T1-weighted lesions) in the FTY720 groups was 77.0 to 80.7% and in the placebo/FTY720 group was 
47.5%. At Month 60, 86.7% of all patients were free of any inflammatory activity.

With  respect  to  the  phase  II  study,  the  design  followed  the  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of 
medicinal products for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (CPMP/EWP/561/98 Rev.1). However, only 2 
doses were tested (5 mg and 1.25 mg) in multiple sclerosis patients and no clear dose-response effect 
was  observed,  questioning  if  the  minimum  effective  dose  was  achieved.  Exposure-  response

relationship  modelling  in  patients  with  RRMS  showed  that  0.5  mg  dose  was  as  beneficial  as  1.25  mg 
dose.  Considering  that  no  additional  beneficial  effects  were  observed  over  1.25  mg  dose,  0.5  mg 
(1/10th of 5 mg) was selected as an additional dose to be evaluated for the phase III studies.  
With  respect  to  the  phase  III  studies,  2  pivotal  studies  were  conducted:  a  single  2-year  placebo 
controlled  study  (D2301)  and  a  1-year  active-controlled  study  with  no  placebo  arm  (D2302).  The 
minimum duration of 2 years, as recommended in the above-referred guideline was therefore fulfilled 
in  study  D2301.  Addditionally,  the  primary  (ARR)  and  secondary  endpoints  (time  to  3  month- 
confirmed disability progression) were considered in line the recommendations from the above-referred 
guideline. 
In study 2301, the population was representative of the MS population with a large majority of women 
(70%) and Caucasian subjects (95.5%) included in the trial. The mean duration of the disease was 8.2 
years. The mean of relapses in the last year was 1.5 and in the last two years 2.1, and the mean EDSS 
score was 2.40. Slightly more than half of all patients were treatment naïve (approximatively 57-60% 
across  the  groups).  Among  those  who  had  been  previously  treated,  interferon  beta  had  been  most 
often commonly used MS drugs (70.6%).  
At 24 months treatment,  the aggregate ARR was statistically significantly lower with fingolimod at all 
doses  tested  (0.5  mg  :  0.18,    95%  CI:  0.15,  0.22;    1.25  mg:  0.16,  95%  CI:  0.13,  0.19)  versus 
placebo (0.40,  95% CI: 0.34, 0.47), representing relative reductions of 54% and 60%, respectively, 
in  the  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR  ratio:  0.40  and  0.46  for  1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg,  respectively). 
However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two doses in the ARR (p=0.226).  
At  24  months,  the  time  to  3  month-  confirmed  disability  progression,  was  statistically  longer  with  all 
doses  tested  than  with  placebo.  Fingolimod  reduced  the  risk  of  disability  progression,  confirmed  at  3 
months, over the 24-month study period (0.5 mg: HR= 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.93, p=0.017; 1.25 mg:  
0.5  mg:  HR=  0.70,  95%  CI:  0.52,  0.96,  p=0.024)  as  compared  to  placebo.  However,  there  was  no 
difference between the two doses using the ITT population (p=0.743). 
The proportion of patients free of progression was greater in the two fingolimod groups : 83.4% in the 
for 1.25 mg, 82.3% for 0.5 mg versus 75.9% for the placebo group.  All additional secondary efficacy 
parameters concerning relapses and MRI were supportive of the results on the primary endpoint. 
In study D2302, the population was also was representative of the MS population with a large majority 
of  women  (67%)  and  Caucasian  subjects  (94.1%)  included  in  the  trial.  The  mean  duration  of  the 
disease was 7.4 years. The mean of relapses in the last year was 1.5 and in the last two years 2.2 and 
the  mean  EDSS  score  was  2.21.  The  percentages  of  treatment  naïve  patients  and  previously  treated 
patients  were  respectively  43.3%  and  56.7%.  Patients  who  were  previously  treated  with  at least  one 
MS  therapy  could  be  considered  in  failure  according  to  the  study  protocol.  Approximately  47.6  %  of 
patients randomized to receive interferon beta-1a i.m. were already been receiving a form of interferon 
beta  within  the  3  months  prior  to  the  start  of  study  drug  treatment  and  27%  were  already  been 
receiving interferon beta-1a. 
At  12  months,    the  aggregate  ARR  was  statistically  significantly  lower  with  fingolimod  at  all  doses 
tested  (0.5  mg  :  0.16,    95%  CI:  ,  0.122,  0.212,  p<0.001  ;    1.25  mg:  0.20,  95%  CI:  0.157,0.264, 
p<0.001) versus interferon beta-1a  (0.33,  95% CI: 0.262, 0.417), representing relative reductions of 
52% and 38%, respectively, in the annualized relapse rate (ARR ratio: 0.62 and 0.48 for 1.25 mg and 
0.5 mg, respectively).  
At 12 months, both fingolimod treatment groups had a lower mean number of new or newly enlarged 
T2  lesions  compared  to  the  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  group,  which  reached  statistical  significance  for 
both the fingolimod 1.25 mg group (p<0.001) and the fingolimod 0.5 mg group (p=0.004). However, 
Gilenya

there was no difference between the two fingolimod treatment groups and the interferon beta-1a i.m. 
group in the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression as based on Kaplan-Meier estimates (0.5 
mg: difference=2.03, 95% CI: -1.42, 5.47, p=0.247, 1.25 mg: difference=1.30, 95% CI: -2.26, 4.86, 
p=0.498) .  
The proportion of patients who were relapse-free at month 12 was higher in the fingolimod treatment 
groups (79.8% for fingolimod 1.25 mg and 82.6% for fingolimod 0.5 mg treatment groups) compared 
to the interferon beta-1a i.m. group (69.3%) and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.001  
All  additional  secondary  efficacy  parameters  concerning  relapses  and  MRI  were  supportive  of  the 
results on the primary endpoint. 
Having  considered  these  data,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  study  D2301  had  an  adequate 
duration and methodology used. Efficacy results were considered consistent and robust for both tested 
doses  as  compared  to  placebo  on  both  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  as  well  as  a  number  of 
other secondary endpoints related to relapses and MRI. The effect on disease progression as measured 
by  EDSS  was  reassuring  even  if  modest  considering  the  relatively  low  active  population  of  RRMS 
patients  included  in  the  trial.  In  addition,  efficacy  was  also  confirmed  in  the  more  severe  group  at 
baseline (2-3 relapses in the last two years). In study D2302, there was no difference between the two 
fingolimod  treatment  groups  and  the  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  group  in  the  time  to  3-month  confirmed 
disability progression, however this might be expected taking into account the shorter duration of the 
study  as  compared  to  study  D2301  (one  year)  and  again  the  low  active  population  of  RRMS  patients 
included in the trial. Nonetheless, both fingolimod groups had a lower mean number of new or newly 
enlarged T2 lesions compared to the interferon beta-1a i.m. group, the other key secondary endpoint. 
Overall, efficacy results from study D2302 were also considered consistent and robust for both tested 
doses as compared to placebo on primary endpoint as well as a number of other secondary endpoints 
related to relapses and MRI. 
Regarding efficacy after withdrawal and possible rebound effect, there was no tendency for increase in 
ARR  in  the  fingolimod  groups  at  90  days  after  study  drug  discontinuation,  except  for  those  patients 
who  switched  from  5  mg  dose  to  1.25  mg  dose  which  can  be  expected.  After  study  drug 
discontinuation  in  the  placebo  group,  there  was  a  decrease  in  the  disease  activity  as  measured  by 
number of patients free of Gadolinium enhancing lesions (58% at baseline, 52% between day 15 and 
day 90 after discontinuation and 76.2% beyond 3 months).  In the fingolimod group, the decrease in 
the disease activity was smaller. (56% of patients free of lesions at baseline, 67% between day 15 and 
day 90 after discontinuation and 61% beyond 3 months).The effect of fingolimod as based on MRI data 
was observed only during the treatment (85% of patients free of lesions at the last MRI on treatment 
and 61% beyond 3 months after discontinuation). However, there was no obvious evidence of rebound 
effect based on MRI data. 
Considering the heterogeneous safety profile of fingolimod (see 3.6 clinical safety), the benefit risk of 
fingolimod  was  considered  negative  by  the  CHMP  in  the  indication  initially  applied  for:  “Disease-
modifying therapy in adults for the treatment of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis to reduce the 
frequency  of  relapses  and  to  delay  the  progression  of  disability”.  Subsequently,  post-hoc  analyses  in 
highly  active  subgroups  of  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis  were  performed  by  the  applicant  to 
evaluate  the  benefit-risk  in  a  restricted  population.  Results  of  these  subgroups  analyses  were 
consistent with those obtained in the overall population.  In light of these results and the subgroups of 
patients  defined  and  proposed  by  the  applicant    ,  the  CHMP  agreed  to  convene  a  SAG  meeting  to 
discuss the place of fingolimod in the multiple sclerosis therapy.

Additional expert consultation 
At the SAG Neurology meeting held on 12 January 2011, the applicant proposed indication under 
discussion was as follows: 
“Gilenya is indicated as disease-modifying therapy to reduce the frequency of relapses and to delay the 
progression of disability in adult patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS): 
- 
or 
- 
or 
- 
who have an inadequate response to an alternative MS therapy (at least 1 relapse while on an 
alternative therapy of at least 6 months duration) 
who stop an alternative MS therapy due to drug hypersensitivity or unacceptable adverse 
reactions such as persistent flu-like symptoms, laboratory abnormalities or injection site and 
infusion reactions or in those who decide to limit cumulative exposure to an alternative MS 
therapy 
who have active relapsing-remitting MS (at least 1 relapse in the prior year) and who have 
either gadolinium-enhancing lesion(s) or have accumulated MS-related neurological impairment 
(i.e. Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) ≥2.5).” 
The  applicant  clarified  during  the  meeting  that  the  proposed  definition  of  inadequate  response  (“at 
least  1  relapse  while  on  an  alternative  therapy  of  at  least  6  months  duration”)  meant  “at  least  1 
relapse after alternative therapy of at least 6 months duration”. 
 The main SAG conclusions were as follows: 
-  In  general,  fingolimod  is  an  efficacious  drug  and  potentially  a  valuable  addition  to  the  existing 
disease-modifying treatments in MS. However, there was concern about the safety profile of fingolimod 
such that fingolimod cannot be recommended for first line treatment. 
- The efficacy of fingolimod in the treatment of multiple sclerosis could be regarded as broadly similar 
to that of natalizumab. However, the efficacy and safety of fingolimod in relation to drugs other than 
Avonex used for treatment of MS could only be assessed by head-to head comparisons.  
- The group recognised that the oral route of administration of fingolimod is advantageous. 
-  The  group  considered  fingolimod  as  a  potential  therapeutic  option  for  patients  with  clinically 
aggressive  disease  (high  disease  activity)  causing  disabling  relapses  or  accumulating  disability  at  a 
stage before they have serious impairment. The group did not a priori see any reason to apply different 
indications for second line therapy drugs in MS. 
The difference in the nature and severity of the risk profile of fingolimod and natalizumab can not be 
used  to  differentiate  these  two  drugs.  There  was  no  specific  safety  evaluation  of  fingolimod  in  a  high 
disease activity group. 
- In general, the group recommended that the indication should be in line with that for natalizumab. 
-  With  regard  to  inadequate  response,  6  months  treatment  duration  was  considered  too  short  and  at 
least 1 year would be more appropriate. The group was concerned that the criterion of only 1 relapse 
may  be  too  sensitive  because  of  early  relapses  after  initiating  first-line  treatment  due  to  a  delayed 
onset of action of the first-line treatment. 
- Concerning the proposed indication for “high disease activity”, a significant increase in lesion load has 
not been well defined, and the MRI criteria may need to be revisited.  
- Intolerance to alternative MS therapy should include also Copaxone being tried. There are subjective 
issues involved in the reporting of intolerance including the attractiveness of an oral treatment. It is 
not consistent with the approved natalizumab indication to include intolerance to alternate MS therapy 
as a separate indication.  No evidence has been presented for the second part of the indication, i.e.

intolerance to alternative MS therapy. The group can not comment further on this issue in the absence 
of data. 
Furthermore,  the  SAG  recommended  to  convene  an  expert  group  to  draft  criteria  for  defining 
subpopulations eligible for second line treatment of multiple sclerosis. 
Following the SAG recommendations and having considered consistent treatment effects in highly 
active subgroups was demonstrated (see 3.5.2.3), the CHMP recommended to align the indication to 
the already authorised indication in the EU as second line treatment of multiple sclerosis, as follows: 
“GILENYA is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups:  
Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon.  
These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon. Patients should have had at least 1 
relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial 
MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion.  
A “non-responder” could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or 
ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year,  
or  
patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a 
significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI." 
The  applicant  accepted  the  wording  of  the  indication  as  recommended  by  the  CHMP,  in  line  with 
already authorised indication in the EU as second line treatment of multiple sclerosis. In addition, the 
CHMP recommended that the treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced 
in multiple sclerosis. 
Further long term data will be generated from ongoing studies and will be submitted by the applicant 
to monitor the benefit-risk balance of the product. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy in reducing the number of relapses was demonstrated in patients 
with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with high disease activity in the proposed dosing regimen for 
Gilenya (fingolimod). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
Studies submitted to support the safety of fingolimod included the following in patients with relapsing-
remitting  MS:  Two  pivotal  Phase  III  studies  applying  the  doses  0.5  mg  and  1.25  mg  daily  (D2301 
(placebo-controlled)  and  D2302  (active-controlled))  for  24  months  and  12  months,  respectively,  and 
one pivotal 6-month, placebo-controlled Phase II study (study D2201) applying the doses 5.0 mg and 
1.25  mg  daily,  supported  by  interim  safety  data  from  ongoing  open-label  extensions  to  two  of  the 
studies (D2302E1 and D2201E1) and a total of 29 Phase I clinical pharmacology studies. 
A number of additional clinical studies in MS patients are ongoing for which reports of deaths and SAEs 
are included and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation are also summarized. These are 3 double-
blind,  placebo-controlled  studies  (D2309;  D1201;  D2306),  the  long-term  extensions  to  two  of  these

(D2309E1;  D1201E1),  and  3  ongoing  long-term  extensions  of  studies  for  which  the  core  studies  are 
complete (D2301E1; D2302E1; D2201E1). 
Pooling of Phase II and III safety studies 
The  data  from  three  completed,  double-blind,  controlled  MS  studies  and  interim  data  from  two  long-
term  extension  studies  in  MS  patients  were  pooled  into  5  datasets  using  appropriate  cut-offs  to 
accommodate  differences  between  studies  in  duration  of  treatment,  doses,  and  comparators  and  are 
shown in the table below. Pivotal studies included only patients between 18 - 60 years.

Note: This table is an update from the [FTY720D-ISS Table 110].  
The duration of exposure is the total actual days patients took the study medication until cut-off date. * 
Patient PID D2201-0061-00012 in the FTY720 5-1.25 mg group has updated dosing data since the full 
submission which has introduced a period where he did not receive any study medication; hence, this has

reduced his duration of FTY720 exposure from 993 days as reported in the ISS to 957 days in this ISS 
Update. - Patients are counted by each level of the duration of exposure cumulatively. - Patient years is 
defined as the sum of the number of days on study drug for all patients in each dose group divided by 
365.25.  
- FTY720 5 mg-1.25 mg group includes patients who received either FTY720 5 mg alone or FTY720 5 mg 
switched to 1.25 mg.  
Across  the  3  completed  controlled  clinical  studies  in  MS,  a  total  of  2833  patients  were  treated,  1891 
with fingolimod, 511 with placebo, and 431 with IFN β-1a. Considering the extension phases, a total of 
2615  patients  received  fingolimod  at  doses  of  5 mg,  1.25  mg,  or  0.5 mg,  accumulating  more  than 
4582.6 patient-years of exposure to fingolimod.  
In all clinical trials in MS as of 30 November 2010, the applicant estimated that approximately 4,600 
patients had received at least one dose of fingolimod, approximately 10,000 patient-years.  
Clinical trials from the program studying FTY720 in renal transplantation provide multiple-dose safety 
data for FTY720 from approximately 1600 patients, of whom about 1500 received FTY720 (2.5 or 5.0 
mg/day) in combination with Neoral and corticosteroids.  
2.6.2.  Adverse events  
The AE profile for Group B, a 24-month treatment in 1272 MS patients, is considered representative of 
the FTY720 safety profile and included 2 fingolimod doses and placebo groups (see Table 32).

Preferred terms are sorted in descending frequency for the FTY720 1.25 mg group. 
A patient with multiple AEs within a primary SOC is counted only once in the total row. 
A patient with multiple occurrences of an AE under one treatment group is counted only once in the AE preferred 
term for that treatment group. 
This table contains AEs whose missing start dates were imputed as part of the analyses performed for the D2301 
CSR, contrary to the convention used for the other pooled analyses in this submission (Source: [D2301 PT-Table 
14.3.1-1.1] 
AEs  which  occurred  at  a  clinically  relevantly  higher  incidence  in  both  FTY720  groups  compared  with 
placebo  included  the  following  preferred  terms:  headache,  elevations  in  liver  enzymes,  back  pain, 
diarrhea, bronchitis, dizziness, sinusitis, dyspnea, and hypertension. For the two of the most common 
AEs  (nasopharyngitis,  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection)  there  were  no  noteworthy  differences 
among dose groups.  
In  the  pooled  analysis  of  clinical  pharmacology  studies,  FTY720  treatment  had  a  higher  number  of

Suicide 
In  completed  studies,  there  were  eight  deaths  in  MS  patients  exposed  to  FTY720  –  seven  in  patients 
who had been randomized to FTY720 1.25mg and one on FTY720 5 mg. No deaths have been reported 
in patients receiving the FTY720 0.5 mg dose.  
Three  of  the  deaths  occurred  while  the  patients  were  on  therapy  or  had  recently  discontinued 
(Depression/suicide,  herpes  zoster  disseminated,  herpes  simplex  encephalitis).  One  additional  patient 
of interest presented with symptoms consistent with a chest infection approximately 11  months after 
commencing FTY720 1.25 mg. Study medication was permanently discontinued. Three days later, the 
patient  developed  neurological  symptoms,  which  led  to  a  diagnosis  of  acute  disseminated 
encephalomyelitis by the investigator. However, CSF analysis was negative for JC virus. The patient’s 
neurological condition continued to worsen and approximately 6 months after discontinuing study drug, 
the  patient  developed  an  aspiration  pneumonia  due  to  progressive  neurological  decline  and 
subsequently died. 
In ongoing studies (cut off date: 30 September 2009), there were 5 deaths reported: 1 patient in the 
FTY720  5  mg  group,  2  patients  in  the  FTY720  1.25  mg  group,  and  2  patients  who  died  prior  to 
receiving the first dose of study medication. The 3 patients from the FTY720 treatment groups died of 
ovarian  cancer  (FTY720  5  mg  group),  rapidly  deteriorating  primary  progressive  MS  (FTY720  1.25  mg 
group) and road traffic accident (FTY720 1.25 mg group). 
From 1 October 2009 through 29 January 2010, 2 additional deaths were reported concerning 1 
patient in the FTY720 0.5 mg dose group and another patient whose study drug is still and blinded 
(see Table 34).

The  overall  proportion  of  patients  with  SAEs  was  higher  in  the  FTY720  5 mg-1.25 mg  group  and 
1.25 mg  group  compared  to  the  0.5 mg  group.  Of  note,  one  subject  in  the  FTY720  1.25  mg  group 
experienced a complete AV block that was accompanied by loss of consciousness about 3 hours after 
the first dose of study medication on extension Day 1. The patient recovered without any intervention. 
In the pooled datasets of Groups A, B, C, D and E, consistent with the mechanism of action, more SAE 
were  reported  in  the  FTY720  groups  as  compared  to  placebo  mainly  for  the  following  events: 
lymphopenia,  bradycardia  and  AV  block  (1st  and  2nd  degree),  liver  function  abnormalities,  macular 
edema and dyspnoea.  
In  clinical  pharmacology  studies,  one  2nd  degree  AV  block,  one  dyspnoea  and  one  hepatic  enzyme 
increase were reported as SAEs. 
In  an  ongoing  study  CFTY720D2306,  an  atypical  MRI  lesion  was  reported  as  SAE  according  to  the 
Investigator's Brochure. The patient remains clinically stable compared to baseline. 
Infections 
In group A, the rate of infections overall was not increased in patients treated with fingolimod 1.25 mg 
or  0.5  mg  for  up  to  12  months  as  compared  to  the  control  groups,  with  a  relative  risk  of  infection 
compared  to  placebo  of  0.94  (95%  CI:0.85-1.04)  for  fingolimod  1.25  mg  and  0.93  (095%  CI:0.84-
1.03)  for  fingolimod  0.5  mg  .  In  group  B,  similar  findings  were  seen  up  to  24  months  compared  to 
placebo.  However,  a  dose-dependent  increased  risk  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infections  (mainly 
bronchitis, few cases of pneumonia) was noted with fingolimod: 6.8%, 5.7% and 4.5% in Group A and 
11.4%, 9.6% and 6.0% in Group B for fingolimod 1.25 mg, 0.5 mg and placebo respectively. 
In  group  B,  a  risk  of  infection  with  lower  circulating  lymphocytes  count  has  been  observed  with 
progressive  higher  infection  rate  respectively  of  63.7%  when  lymphocytes  count  is  >  0.7x109/L  to 
82.6% when lymphocytes count is below 0.2 x109/L.  The proportion of patients with infections related 
AEs  was  greater  in  females  than  in  males  in  all  treatment  groups:  71.9  versus  61.2%  for  fingolimod 
1.25 mg; 76.0 versus 61.2 % for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 74.2 versus 66.7 % for the placebo. 
Analyses of the relationship of nadir blood lymphocyte counts and occurrence of infections in Group A 
showed that the proportion of patients with infections in the group with the lowest lymphocyte counts 
(< 0.2×109/L) was increased (61.6%) compared to those with higher cell counts on fingolimod (45.0-
56.6%).  
Additionally, a total of 3 cases of disseminated herpes infection were reported in patients treated with 
fingolimod  1.25  mg.  In  these  cases,  2  deaths  were  reported.  The  third  patient  had  disseminated 
herpes  zoster  with  pulmonary  involvement  and  made  a  complete  recovery  after  treatment  with 
aciclovir therapy.  
Malignancies 
Incidence of malignant neoplasm in all fingolimod treated patients (group E) is presented in Table 37.

Table 37  Number (%) of patients with malignant neoplasms in Group E 
(FTY720-treated safety population) 
There  have  been  a  total  of  3  reported  cases  of  lymphoma  in  the  fingolimod  MS  clinical  development 
program  and  a  causal  relationship  between  those  cases  and  treatment  by  fingolimod  can  not  be 
excluded.  Of  note,  one  of  the  lymphoma  cases  was an  EBV  associated  B-cell  lymphoma.  This  case  is 
particularly  worrisome.  EBV  infection  is  known  to  induce  malignancies  and  EBV  induced  cancers 
incidence is higher in immunodepressed patients. In the second case, fingolimod could have acted as a 
booster,  transforming  a  pre-cancerous  lesion  to  lymphoma,  1  year  after  initiation.  In  the  last  case, 
lymphoma occurred 13 months after treatment initiation. With a population more than 4,000 patients 
exposed to fingolimod (approximately 10,000 patient-years, the estimated incidence of lymphoma with 
fingolimod  is  3  in  10,000  patient  years  (95%CI:  0.6-8.8  per  10,000  patient  years).  In  contrast,  no 
lymphoma has been reported in the placebo arm nor in the interferon arm.  
Cardiac events 
Effects on heart 
In  group  B,  bradycardia  (including  sinus  bradycardia  and  bradyarrhythmia)  was  reported  as  an  AE  in 
16 patients in the FTY720 1.25mg and 0.5mg groups, and 3 patients in placebo group. Out of the 16 
patients  in  the  FTY720  groups,  13  of  them  had  bradycardia  AEs  during  the  day  1  first  dose 
administration period. No patients in the placebo group had bradycardia reported as an AE during the 
first-dose  monitoring.  Bradycardia  has  been  reported  in  0.6%  of  patients  in  fingolimod  0.5  mg  arm 
versus 0% in placebo group. 
In group B, greater proportion of patients with first degree AV block was reported in the FTY720 1.25 
mg group than in the FTY720 0.5 mg and placebo groups. First degree AV block was reported as an AE 
in 5 patients in the FTY720 1.25 mg group (1.2%), 2 patients in the FTY720 0.5 mg group (0.5%), and 
2 patients in the placebo group (0.5%). Out of the 7 patients in the FTY720 groups, 3 of them had first

degree AV during day 1 first dose administration, 2 in the FTY720 1.25 mg group (including one SAE) 
and one in the FTY720 0.5 mg group.  
Two  cases  of  second  degree  AV  block  were  reported  as  SAE  in  the  FTY720  1.25  mg  and  placebo 
groups,  respectively.  In  the  FTY720  1.25  mg  group  the  event  occurred  on  Day  1  of  treatment  and 
resulted in discontinuation of study drug. There were no AE reports of second degree AV block in the 
FTY720 0.5 mg group. 
A dose-dependent reduction in sitting pulse and heart rate on ECGs was observed following initiation of 
FTY720 treatment. In all groups, the decreases in sitting pulse peaked at 4-5 hours after the first dose 
administration but returned to baseline values by Month 1. There were no relevant differences between 
FTY720,  placebo  and  interferon  groups  in  mean  sitting  pulse  or  heart  rate  over  long  term  treatment 
period. 
Dose  dependent  increases  in  QTc  interval  was  also  observed  at  6  hours  after  the  first  FTY720  dose. 
When  adjusted  using  Fridericia’ s  formula,  there  was  no  evidence  of  QTc  prolongation  >60  ms  from 
pre-dose  or  any  QTc  interval  >500  ms  (males)  or  <520  ms  (females)  within  the  first  6  hours  of  the 
first  or  second  dose  administration,  except  for  one  patient  in  the  FTY720  0.5  mg  group  who  had  a 
Fridericia-corrected QTc increase of >60 ms at more than 6 hours after the first dose.  
Effect on blood pressure 
In group B, hypertension was reported in 6.3% in the 1.25 mg group and 6.1% in the fingolimod 0.5 
mg group compared to 3.8% with the placebo group. These increases were of 1mmHg  on average in 
mean  arterial  pressure,  generally  manifesting  2  months  after  treatment  initiation  and  persisting  with 
continued treatment. 
In group B, a higher percentage of patients in both FTY720 groups reported at least one notably high 
or notable increase in systolic or diastolic BP compared to the placebo group. In contrast, there were 
higher percentages of patients with notably low measurements or notable decreases from baseline in 
the placebo group compared to the FTY720 groups. 
In group E, changes in blood pressure appeared to be reversible and returned to baseline values within 
3 months after study drug discontinuation. 
Macular edema 
In  group  B,  macular  edema  was  reported  as  SAE  in  the  FTY20  1.25  mg  group  (n=3,  0.7%)  only. 
Macular  oedema  has  been  reported  in  0.4%  of  patients  in  fingolimod  0.5  mg  arm  versus  0.1%  in 
placebo group. 
Up  to  29  January  2010,  12  cases  of  macular  edema  were  reported  as  SAE,  of  which  8  have  been 
confirmed,  1  in  the  fingolimod  0.5mg  and  7  in  the  fingolimod  1.25mg  groups,  respectively.  The  8 
confirmed macular edema cases were reported in both male (n=4)  and female patients (n=4), were 
unilateral (n=6) or occurred in both eyes (n=2). Six of these cases were detected within the first 4 to 
16  weeks  of  treatment.  The  remaining  2  cases  were  detected  10  and  12  months  respectively  after 
commencing treatment with fingolimod 1.25 mg. The reported seriousness assessment for these cases 
included medical significant events (4 cases), disability (1 case), medically significant and disability (1 
case) and hospitalisation (2 cases). 
The  majority  of  cases  occurred  within  the  first  3-4  months  of  therapy.  Some  patients  presented  with 
blurred  vision  or  decreased  visual  acuity,  but  others  were  asymptomatic  and  diagnosed  on  routine 
ophthalmological  examination.  Generally, 
reported  macular  oedema 
improved  or 
resolved 
spontaneously after discontinuation of fingolimod.

Respiratory events 
In group B, cough and dyspnea were the most frequently reported respiratory AEs in the FTY720 1.25 
mg  and  0.5  mg  groups.  The  proportions  of  patients  with  cough  and  dyspnea  were  higher  for  the 
FTY720 groups compared to placebo. There was no evidence of dose-dependence and the proportions 
of  patients  experiencing  these  two  AEs  were  similar  between  the  FTY720  1.25  mg  and  placebo 
treatment group with 8.6% versus 8.1% and 5.4% versus 4.5 %, respectively for cough and dyspnea.  
Most dyspnea events occurred in the first six months of treatment, and resolved without concomitant 
treatment.  Dyspnea  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  study  drug  for  one  patient  (0.2%)  in  each  of  the 
FTY720  treatment  groups  and  for  2  patients  (0.5%)  in  the  placebo  group.  One  SAE  of  dyspnea  was 
reported in the FTY720 0.5 mg group.  
Neurological disorders 
Six  cases  of  severe  neurological  adverse  events  of  interest  were  reported  during  clinical  trials  with 
fingolimod:  2  cases  of  PRES  (Posterior  reversible  Encephalopathy  Syndrome),  one  fatal  case 
suggestive of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), one MS relapse, one fatal case of severe 
neurological degenerescence, one acute inflammatory neurological event possibly related to ADEM. 
2.6.4.  Laboratory findings 
Safety  analysis  from  group  B  is  presented  below.  Electrolyte  levels  were  not  analysed  in  the  MS 
studies, data are derived from a clinical pharmacoly study (D2113) and the renal transplant studies. 
Hematology parameters 
At 2 weeks post-baseline, the mean lymphocyte count in the FTY720 1.25 mg group was  reduced by 
approximately  74%,  and  in  the  FTY720  0.5  mg  group  was  reduced  by  approximately  70%. 
Lymphocyte. At 24 months, these were reduced by approximately 77% in the FTY720 1.25 mg group 
and 74% in the FTY720 0.5 mg group. In the placebo group, no relevant changes in mean lymphocyte 
counts  were  seen.  There  was  a  trend  towards  greater  mean  reductions  from  baseline  in  lymphocyte 
counts for females compared to males in both FTY720 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg groups. At Month24, mean 
lymphocyte count in females was reduced by approximately 78% (vs. 71% in males) for FTY720 1.25 
mg and by approximately 75% (vs. 72% in males) for FTY720 0.5 mg. 
At 2 weeks post-baseline, mean neutrophil counts were reduced from baseline by approximately 22% 
in the FTY720 1.25 mg group and by approximately 17% in the FTY720 0.5 mg group. At 24 months, 
these were reduced by approximately 29% in the FTY720 1.25 mg group and 20% in the FTY720 0.5 
mg group. In the placebo group, there were no relevant changes in mean neutrophil counts.  
At 2 weeks post-baseline, mean total WBC counts were reduced from baseline by approximately 35% 
in the FTY720 1.25 mg group and by approximately 31% in the FTY720 0.5 mg group at 2 weeks. At 
24 months, mean total WBC counts were reduced from baseline by approximately 41% in the FTY720 
1.25 mg group and 35% in the FTY720 0.5 mg group. There were no meaningful changes over time in 
mean total WBC counts in the placebo group. 
At  2  weeks  post-baseline,  mean  platelet  counts  were  relatively  reduced  by  approximately  6%  in  the 
FTY720  1.25  mg  group  and  approximately  4%  in  the  FTY720  0.5  mg  group.  At  3  months,    platelet 
counts  in  both  these  treatment  groups,  had  returned  to  levels  similar  those  at  baseline  with 
approximately  96%  and  98%  of  baseline  in  the  1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg  groups,  respectively.  In  the 
placebo group, no relevant change for mean platelet count was seen.

Chemistry parameters 
Mean  ALT,  AST  and  GGT  values  for  the  FTY720  1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg  groups  were  increased  from 
baseline  in  both  FTY720  groups.  At  24  months,  mean  increases  from  baseline  in  ALT,  AST  and  GGT 
values in the 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg groups were:  13.30 and 13.52 U/L (ALT); 4.77 and 5.34 U/L (AST); 
36.12  and  31.80  U/L  (GGT),  respectively.  There  were  no  meaningful  changes  over  the  treatment 
period for placebo group. Changes from baseline in ALT, AST and GGT values in the 1.25 mg and 0.5 
mg groups were greater for males than females, irrespective of the dose.  
Mean  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP)  slightly  increased  from  baseline  in  both  FTY720  groups.  At  24 
months,  mean  increases  from  baseline  in  ALP  values  in  the  1.25  mg  0.5  mg  groups  were  4.41  and 
2.65 versus 0.09 mmol/l in the placebo group. 
Mean  total  cholesterol,  HDL  and  LDL  cholesterol  slightly  increased  from  baseline  in  both  FTY720 
groups.  At  24  months,  mean  increases  from  baseline  in  total  cholesterol,  HDL  and  LDL  cholesterol 
values  in  the  1.25  mg  0.5  mg  groups  were:    0.411  and  0.355  (total  cholesterol),  0.147  and  0.1315 
(HDL cholesterol), 0.207 and 0.170 mmol/l (LDL cholesterol), respectively, versus 0.086 mmol/l (total 
cholesterol), 0.09 mmol/l (HDL cholesterol) and 0.002 mmol/l (LDL cholesterol) in the placebo group. 
Mean  levels  of  triglycerides  increased  from  baseline  in  both  FTY720  groups.  At  24  months,  mean 
increases  from  baseline  in  triglycerides  values  in  the  1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg  groups  were  0.137  and 
0.125 mmol/l, respectively and versus -0.011 mmol/l in the placebo group. 
Mean changes in glucose values increased from baseline in both FTY720 groups. At 24 months, mean 
changes from baseline were 0.245 mmol/L and 0.123 mmol/L for FTY720 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg groups, 
and versus -0.025 mmol/l in the placebo group. 
No clinically relevant changes were observed in electrolyte levels. 
In all safety groups, no differences in proportions of patients with proteinuria were seen. 
Safety in special populations 
No  trials  have  been  performed  in  any  special  multiple  sclerosis  patient  populations.  Patients  with 
diabetes  mellitus  (uncontrolled  diabetes  in  D2201),  significant  cardiovascular  or  pulmonary  disease, 
renal  impairment  and  hepatic  conditions  were  excluded  in  the  pivotal  studies.Recommendations  for 
patients with renal, hepatic impairment and other special population (paediatric, elderly) are discussed 
under clinical pharmacology aspects (see 3.4.4.) 
In  MS  clinical  studies,  females  of  childbearing  potential  were  required  to  have  a  negative  pregnancy 
test prior to entering the treatment period and to use 2 effective forms of contraception until 3 months 
after  treatment  discontinuation.  Nonetheless,  a  total  of  30  out  of  52  pregnancies  were  reported  in 
fingolimod-treated  patients  in  the  clinical  studies  including  a  total  of  2380  female  patients  as  of  29 
January 2010. Thirteen successful deliveries with 12 normal newborns and 1 case report of congenital 
shortening  of  the  right  leg  with  congenital  posteromedial  bowing  of  the  tibia  were  observed.   Limited 
information was available on abortions, however, one abortion was reported tostudie be due to Fallot’s 
tetralogy (fetal abnormality) in a female patient on fingolimod 1.25 mg.  
Subgroups  analyses  were  performed  on  differences  in  the  rate  of  AEs  by  gender,  age,  and  previous 
treatment status. A higher percentage of naive patients had high ALT values and high AST compared 
to pre-treated patients in the safety population group A (12 months treatment). A higher percentage of 
pre-treated  patients  presented  lymphocytes  count  <  0.2  x  109  /L    was  also  observed  compared  to 
naive patients in fingolimod 1.25 and 0.5 mg arms in group A and group E suggesting potential need 
for a therapeutic window after administration of other immunossupressive agent and before fingolimod 
initiation. Due to the half life of the fingolimod (6-9 days), a warning to ensure that a 6 week interval

period of wash-out is done after treatment has been included before initiation of natalizumab or other 
immunosuppressants. 
Drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific investigation has been conducted in multiple sclerosis patient populations.  
Considering  the  risk  of  additive  immune  system  effects;  co-administration  of  anti-neoplastic, 
immunosuppressive or immune-modulating therapies is not recommended. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations  from  study  drug  due  to  AEs  and  abnormal  laboratory  values,  when  taken  together, 
were notably more frequent on FTY720 1.25 mg (14.7%) and slightly more frequent on FTY720 0.5 mg 
(8.2%) compared with placebo (6.9%), these were possibly related to the dose response that could be 
observed  for  a  number  of  AEs:  macular  edema,  bradycardia  and  AV  blocks,  lymphopenia,  infections 
and  to  some  extent  elevations  in  liver  enzymes.  About  16%  patients  exposed  to  fingolimod  0.5mg 
required a more extensive monitoring than 6 hours.  
Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy were 4.2, 1.9 and  8.6%, for the FTY720 1.25 mg, FTY720  0.5 
mg and placebo groups, respectively.

2.6.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  fingolimod  has  been  characterized  with  data  from  2615  MS  patients,  comprising 
4582.6  patient-years  of  exposure.  Of  these  patients,  >1700  were  exposed  to  daily  doses  of  0.5  mg 
and 1.25 mg in the two completed pivotal Phase III studies, including 94 exposed to a higher dose of 
5.0  mg  in  the  MS  Phase  II  study.  However,  patients  with  diabetes  mellitus  (uncontrolled  diabetes  in 
D2201), significant cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, renal impairment and hepatic conditions were 
excluded in the pivotal studies. Very limited safety information has been received from pregnancy. 
In MS clinical studies, the overall incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was similar 
for fingolimod and matched controls (placebo, interferon beta-1a). However, specific events associated 
with  the  biologic  effects  of  fingolimod  were  reported  on  the  cardiac,  ocular,  immune,  hepatic,  and 
pulmonary systems. 
About 90% of patients experienced one or more AEs in all groups. The system organ class (SOC) with 
the  highest  proportion  of patients  with  AEs was infections  and  infestations. The  incidence  of infection 
and  infestation  SAEs  were  comparable  between  the  different  groups  during  the  12  month-treatment 
and  appeared  to  be  increased  during  the  24  month-treatment.  Additionally,  a  total  of  3  cases  of 
disseminated  herpes  infection  were  reported  in  patients  treated  with  fingolimod  1.25  mg.  In  these 
cases,  2  deaths  were  reported.  The  third  patient  had  disseminated  herpes  zoster  with  pulmonary 
involvement and made a complete recovery after treatment with aciclovir therapy.  
Among cases of malignancies reported in the fingolimod groups, there have been a total of 3 cases of 
lymphoma in the MS clinical development program and a causal relationship between those cases and 
treatment  by  fingolimod  can  not  be  excluded.  Of  note,  one  of  the  lymphoma  cases  was  an  EBV 
associated  B-cell  lymphoma.  This  case  is  particularly  worrisome.  EBV  infection  is  known  to  induce 
malignancies and EBV induced cancers incidence is higher in immunodepressed patients. In the second

case,  fingolimod  could  have  acted  as  a  booster,  transforming  a  pre-cancerous  lesion  to  lymphoma,  1 
year after initiation. In the last case, lymphoma occurred 13 months after treatment initiation. With a 
population  more  than  4,000  patients  exposed  to  fingolimod  (approximately  10,000  patient-years,  the 
estimated  incidence  of  lymphoma  with  fingolimod  is  3  in  10,000  patient  years  (95%CI:  0.6-8.8  per 
10,000  patient  years).  In  contrast,  no  lymphoma  has  been  reported  in  the  placebo  arm  nor  in  the 
interferon arm.  
Other  specific  AEs  that  were  reported  more  commonly in  MS  patients  treated  with  fingolimod  than  in 
placebo-treated patients included: reductions in white blood cell counts (lymphocytes and total WBC), 
bradycardia on treatment initiation (Day 1), elevations of liver enzymes (in particular increases in ALT 
and  GGT),  macular  edema,  hypertension  and  dyspnea.  In  addition,  a  number  of  cases  of  severe 
neurological  adverse  events  were  reported  including  2  cases  of  PRES  (Posterior  reversible 
Encephalopathy  Syndrome)  and  one  fatal  case  suggestive  of  acute  disseminated  encephalomyelitis 
(ADEM). 
In preclinical studies, fingolimod has shown a teratogenic potential. A total of 30 out of 52 pregnancies 
were  reported  in  fingolimod-treated  patients  in  the  clinical  studies  including  a  total  of  2380  female 
patients  as  of  29  January  2010.  Thirteen  successful  deliveries  with  12  normal  newborns  and  1  case 
report of congenital shortening of the right leg with congenital posteromedial bowing of the tibia were 
observed.  Limited information was available on abortions, however, one abortion was reported to  be 
due to Fallot’s tetralogy (fetal abnormality) in a female patient on fingolimod 1.25 mg. Considering the  
population  fingolimod  is  intended  to  be  used  for,  this  finding  is  considered  as  an  important  identified 
risk. A pregnancy exposure registry to prospectively collect outcome data on the babies born to women 
treated with fingolimod is part of the risk management plan. 
Discontinuations  from  study  drug  due  to  AEs  and  abnormal  laboratory  values,  when  taken  together, 
were notably more frequent on FTY720 1.25 mg (14.7%) and slightly more frequent on FTY720 0.5 mg 
(8.2%) compared with placebo (6.9%), these were possibly related to the dose response that could be 
observed  for  a  number  of  AEs  :  macular  edema,  bradycardia  and  AV  blocks,  lymphopenia,  infections 
and  to  some  extent  elevations  in  liver  enzymes.  About  16%  patients  exposed  to  fingolimod  0.5mg 
required  a  more  extensive  monitoring  than  6  hours.  Dose-dependent  toxicity  were  also  observed  for 
hypertension, leukopenia.  
In  general,  the  AE  profile  of  fingolimod  in  MS  patients  did  not  depend  on  gender  or  age.  However, 
there  was  a  trend  towards  greater  mean  reductions  from  baseline  in  lymphocyte  counts  for  females 
compared to males in both FTY720 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg groups. In addition, changes from baseline in 
ALT,  AST  and  GGT  values  in  the  1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg  groups  were  greater  for  males  than  females, 
irrespective  of  the  dose.    Differences  have  also  been  observed  regarding  haematological  parameters 
and hepatic enzymes in non-naive patients compared with naive patients. A higher percentage of naive 
patients had high ALT values and high AST compared to pre-treated patients in the safety population 
group  A  (12  months  treatment).  A  higher  percentage  of  pre-treated  patients  presented  lymphocytes 
count  <  0.2  x  109  /L    was  also  observed  compared  to  naive  patients  in  fingolimod  1.25  and  0.5  mg 
arms in group A and group E. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  fingolimod  exhibits  a  heterogeneous  and  complex  safety  profile. 
Safety concerns of fingolimod include bradycardia, AV- blocks, leukopenia, risk of increased frequency 
and seriousness of infections, occurrence of lymphoma related to its immunosuppressant effect, as well 
as neurological manifestations including Posterior reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), which 
could be due to the drug itself or the immune suppression. A risk of liver toxicity and strong signals of 
teratogenicity are also part of this unfavourable safety profile. Thus, the CHMP was of the opinion that 
the benefit risk balance in the initial indication applied for “Disease-modifying therapy in adults for the 
treatment of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency of relapses and to delay

the progression of disability” was negative. Subsequently, post-hoc subgroup analyses were performed 
by  the  applicant  to  evaluate  the  benefit-risk  in  a  restricted  population  and  a  SAG  was  convened  to 
discuss the place of fingolimod in the multiple sclerosis therapy. Having considered the efficacy results 
of  highly  active  subgroups  of  patients  with  relapse  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  and  the  SAG 
recommendations, the CHMP concluded that the indication should be restricted in line with the already 
authorised indication in the EU as second line treatment of multiple sclerosis (see 3.5.3). A number of 
measures have been proposed to ensure safe and effective use of the product in the risk management 
plan and were considered appropriate by the CHMP for this restricted indication. 
Hypertension,  liver  enzyme  elevation,  macular  edema,  infections  have  been  considered  as  important 
identified risks requiring additional pharmacovigilance activities. A 5 year post-approval safety (PASS) 
study will be conducted by the applicant to monitor these risks and potential long term complications. 
Other important identified risks such as bradyarrthythmia (including conduction defects) occurring first 
post dose, reductions in white blood cell counts and bronchoconstriction were considered manageable 
through  routine  pharmacovigilance  and  adequate  labelling.  Incidence  of  the  risk  of  bradyarrhythmia 
(including conduction defects) and risk factors will be further characterised via a specific safety study. 
Skin  cancer,  other  malignant  neoplasms,  thromboembolic  events  have  been  considered  as  important 
potential  risks  requiring  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities.  These  risks  will  also  be  monitored  in 
the  5  year  post-approval  safety  conducted  by  the  applicant.  In  addition,  further  investigation  on 
malignant  neoplasms  will  be  performed  in  a  long  term  observational  study  (D2339E1),  similar  to  the 
PASS  study.  Other  important  potential  risks  such  as  QT  interval  prolongation,  PRES  and  ADEM  like 
events, reactivation of chronic viral infections, decreased renal function and potential interactions with 
ketoconazole  and  atenolol  will  be  monitored  via  routine  pharmacovigilance  and  are  reflected  in  the 
Labelling. 
Details of these measures including additional pharmacovigilance activities such as post-authorisation 
safety studies and risk minimization activities are presented in section 3.7. 
In addition, further long term data will be generated from ongoing studies and will be submitted by the 
applicant to monitor the benefit-risk balance of the product. 
2.6.6.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary  of  Product  Characteristics.  Appropriate  measures  including  additional  pharmacovigilance 
activities and risk minimization activities (see 3.7) have been put in place to ensure safe and effective 
use of the product in the recommended indication. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance

labels: 
4-month, open-label, multi-center 
study to explore tolerability and 
safety and health outcomes of 
FTY720 in patients with relapsing 
forms of MS (Study D2316) 
SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.8 state 
that initiation of fingolimod 
treatment results in a transient 
decrease in heart rate and may 
also be associated with 
atrioventricular conduction delays. 
Observe all patients for a period of 
6 hours for signs and symptoms of 
bradycardia. Should post-dose 
bradyarrhythmia-related symptoms 
occur, initiate appropriate 
management and continue 
observation until the symptoms 
have resolved.  Fingolimod has not 
been studied in patients with 
sitting heart rate less than 55 bpm 
and in patients receiving 
concurrent therapy with beta 
blockers or in those with a history 
of syncope. At treatment initiation 
in patients receiving beta blockers, 
or other substances which may 
decrease heart rate, such as 
verapamil, digoxin, 
anticholinesteratic agents or 
pilocarpine, caution should be 
exercised because of the additive 
effects on heart rate (see also 
section 4.5). 
Should post-dose, 
bradyarrhythmia-related symptoms 
occur, appropriate management 
should be initiated as necessary 
and the patient should be observed 
until the symptoms have resolved. 
SmPC also states that fingolimod 
has not been studied in patients 
with 2nd-degree or higher AV 
blocks, sick-sinus-syndrome, 
ischemic cardiac disease, or 
congestive heart failure. Use of 
fingolimod in such patients should 
be based on overall benefit-risk 
assessment and careful 
observation during initiation of 
therapy is recommended due to 
potential for serious rhythm 
disturbances. Before initiation of 
treatment in these patients, advice 
from a cardiologist is 
recommended. 
Fingolimod has not been studied in 
patients with arrhythmias requiring 
treatment with Class Ia (e.g. 
quinidine, procainamide) or 
Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) 
antiarrhythmic medicinal products.

antiarrhythmic medicinal products 
have been associated with cases of 
torsades de pointes in patients with 
bradycardia. Since initiation of 
fingolimod treatment results in 
decreased heart rate, fingolimod 
should not be co-administered with 
these medicinal products. SmPC 
also states that if fingolimod 
therapy is discontinued for more 
than 2 weeks, the effects on heart 
rate and atrio-ventricular 
conduction may recur on 
reintroduction of fingolimod 
treatment and the same 
precautions should apply. 
Additional risk minimization 
activity: 
Educational material for physicians 
and patiens. A physician’s checklist 
prior to prescribing and a patient 
reminder card will describe this 
transient pharmacodynamic effect 
and will highlight that during 
initiation of Gilenya therapy, all 
patients should be observed for a 
period of 6 hours for signs and 
symptoms of bradycardia.  
Hypertension 
Routine pharmacovigilance, 
including cumulative review in 
PSUR. 
Risk addressed in SmPC sections 
4.4 and 4.8 and derived local 
labels: 
Post-approval 5-year safety study 
to monitor for potential long-term 
complications. 
Blood pressure should be regularly 
monitored during treatment with 
Gilenya. Patients with hypertension 
uncontrolled by medication were 
excluded from participation in 
premarketing clinical trials and 
special care is indicated if patients 
with uncontrolled hypertension are 
treated with Gilenya. 
In MS clinical trials, patients 
treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg had 
an average increase of 
approximately 2 mmHg in systolic 
pressure, and approximately 
1 mmHg in diastolic pressure, first 
detected approximately 2 months 
after treatment initiation, and 
persisting with continued 
treatment. In the two-year 
placebo-controlled study, 
hypertension was reported as an 
adverse event in 6.1% of patients 
on fingolimod 0.5 mg and in 3.8% 
of patients on placebo. 
Liver transaminase elevation 
Routine pharmacovigilance, 
including cumulative review in 
PSUR. 
Risk addressed in SmPC sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 and derived local 
labels: 
Post-approval 5-year safety study 
to monitor for clinically significant 
liver injury. 
SmPC states that during clinical 
trials, elevations 3-fold the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) or greater in 
liver transaminases occurred in 8%

of patients treated with fingolimod 
0.5 mg compared to 2% of placebo 
patients. Elevations 5-fold the ULN 
occurred in 2% of patients on 
fingolimod and 1% of patients on 
placebo. In clinical trials, 
fingolimod was discontinued if the 
elevation exceeded 5 times the 
ULN. Recurrence of liver 
transaminase elevations occurred 
with rechallenge in some patients, 
supporting a relationship to 
fingolimod. The majority of 
elevations occurred within 
3-4 months. Serum transaminase 
levels returned to normal within 
approximately 2 months after 
discontinuation of fingolimod. 
Gilenya has not been studied in 
patients with severe pre-existing 
hepatic injury (Child-Pugh class C) 
and must not be used in these 
patients (see section 4.3). 
Due to the immunosuppressive 
properties of fingolimod, initiation 
of treatment should be delayed in 
patients with active viral hepatitis 
until resolution. 
Recent (i.e. within last 6 months) 
transaminase and bilirubin levels 
should be available before initiation 
of treatment with Gilenya. In the 
absence of clinical symptoms, liver 
transaminases levels should be 
monitored at months 1, 3 and 6 on 
therapy and periodically thereafter. 
If liver transaminases riseabove 5 
times the ULN, more frequent 
monitoring should be instituted, 
including serum bilirubin and 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
measurement. With repeated 
confirmation of liver transaminases 
above 5 times the ULN, treatment 
with Gilenya should be interrupted 
and only re-commenced once liver 
transaminases values have 
normalized. 
Patients who develop symptoms 
suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, 
such as unexplained nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, 
anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark 
urine, should have liver enzymes 
checked and Gilenya should be 
discontinued if significant liver 
injury is confirmed (for example 
liver transaminase levels greater 
than 5-fold the ULN and/or serum 
bilirubin elevations). Resumption of 
therapy will be dependent on 
whether or not another cause of 
liver injury is determined and on 
the benefits to patient of resuming 
therapy versus the risks of

Although there are no data to 
establish that patients with pre-
existing liver disease are at 
increased risk of developing 
elevated liver function tests when 
taking Gilenya, caution in the use 
of Gilenya should be exercised in 
patients with a history of significant 
liver disease.

Educational material for physicians 
and patiens. A physician’s checklist

Macular edema 
Routine pharmacovigilance, 
including cumulative review in 
PSUR. 
Risk addressed in SmPC sections 
4.4 and 4.8 and derived local 
labels: 
4-month, open-label, multi-center 
study to explore tolerability and 
safety and health outcomes of 
FTY720 in patients with relapsing 
forms of MS (Study D2316) 
Post-approval 5-year safety study 
to monitor for this and other 
potential long-term complications. 
Macular edema with or without 
visual symptoms has been reported 
in 0.4% of patients treated with 
fingolimod 0.5 mg, occurring 
predominantly in the first 
3-4 months of therapy (see section 
4.8). An ophthalmological 
evaluation is therefore 
recommended at 3-4 months after 
treatment initiation. If patients 
report visual disturbances at any 
time while on therapy, evaluation 
of the fundus, including the 
macula, should be carried out. 
Patients with history of uveitis and 
patients with diabetes mellitus are 
at increased risk of macular 
edema. Gilenya has not been 
studied in multiple sclerosis 
patients with concomitant diabetes 
mellitus. It is recommended that 
multiple sclerosis patients with 
diabetes mellitus or a history of 
uveitis undergo an 
ophthalmological evaluation prior 
to initiating therapy and have 
follow-up evaluations while 
receiving therapy. 
Continuation of Gilenya in patients 
with macular edema has not been 
evaluated. It is recommended that 
Gilenya be discontinued if a patient 
develops macular edema. A 
decision on whether or not Gilenya 
therapy should be re-initiated after 
resolution of macular edema needs 
to take into account the potential 
benefits and risks for the individual 
patient.

Infections 
Routine pharmacovigilance,

Risk addressed in SmPC sections 
4.4 and 4.8 and derived local 
labels: 
Post-approval 5-year safety study 
to monitor for infections and other 
potential complications. 
SmPC state that the immune 
system effects of fingolimod 
therapy may increase the risk of 
infections. The SmPC will also state 
that two fatal herpetic infections 
occurred in patients on the 1.25 
mg dose. As could be considered 
for any immune modulating drug, 
before initiating fingolimod 
therapy, patients without a history 
of chickenpox or without 
vaccination against varicella zoster 
virus (VZV) should be tested for 
antibodies to VZV. VZV vaccination 
of antibody negative patients 
should be considered prior to 
commencing treatment with 
fingolimod, following which 
initiation of treatment with 
fingolimod should be postponed for 
1 month to allow full effect of 
vaccination to occur. 
SmPC recommendation to avoid 
the administration of live or live 
attenuated vaccines while patients 
are taking fingolimod and for 2 
months after discontinuation. 
SmPC states that before initiating 
treatment with fingolimod, a recent 
complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. 
within 6 months) should be 
available. Assessments of CBC are 
also recommended periodically 
during treatment, and in case of 
signs of infections. Absolute 
lymphocyte count <0.2 x109/L, if 
confirmed, should lead to 
treatment interruption, until 
recovery, because in clinical 
studies, fingolimod treatment was 
interrupted in patients with 
absolute lymphocyte count <0.2

Novartis seeks to obtain 
comprehensive data on the 
outcome of any pregnancies that 
occur during the use of fingolimod. 
Bronchoconstriction 
Routine pharmacovigilance, 
including cumulative review in 
PSUR. 
SmPC Section 4.4 and CDS Section 
6 state that a core 
pharmacodynamic effect of Gilenya 
is a dose-dependent reduction of 
the peripheral lymphocyte count to 
20-30% of baseline values. This is 
due to the reversible sequestration 
of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues.  
Further information relating to this 
risk is provided under infections 
above. 
Risk addressed in SmPC section 4.6 
and derived local labels: 
SmPC recommendation for females 
of child-bearing potential to 
practice effective contraception 
during treatment with fingolimod 
and for 2 months post-drug 
discontinuation to cover the period 
of elimination of the drug. SmPC 
also states that it should be 
confirmed that a woman is not 
pregnant at the time of initiation of 
treatment. If a woman becomes 
pregnant while taking Gilenya, 
discontinuation of Gilenya is 
recommended. 
Additional risk minimization 
activity: 
Educational material for physicians 
and patiens. A physician’s checklist 
prior to prescribing and a patient 
reminder card will outline the 
known teratogenic risks with 
fingolimod and explain the 
importance of avoiding pregnancy, 
confirmed by a negative pregnancy 
test,  when undergoing treatment 
with fingolimod. 
SmPC section 4.4 states that minor 
dose-dependent reductions in 
values for forced expiratory volume 
(FEV 1) and diffusion capacity for 
carbon monoxide (D LCO) were 
observed with Gilenya treatment 
starting at Month 1 and remaining 
stable thereafter.  Fingolimod 
should be used with caution in 
patients with severe respiratory 
disease, pulmonary fibrosis and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. Physicians are properly 
informed of this risk.

SmPC section 5.3 states that 
fingolimod increased the risk of 
developing lymphomas in animal 
studies.  SmPC section 4.8 states 
that three cases of lymphoma 
(cutaneous T-cell 
lymphoproliferative disorders or 
diffuse B-cell lymphoma including 
one fatal EBV positive B-cell 
lymphoma) have been reported in 
a population of more than 4,000 
patients (approximately 10,000 
patient-years) exposed to 
fingolimod at, or above, the 
recommended dose of 0.5 mg, 
during the clinical program in 
multiple sclerosis. This incidence of 
3 in 10,000 patient years (95% CI: 
0.6-8.8 per 10,000 patient years) 
compares to a background 
incidence of 1.9 in 10,000 patient 
years in the general population. 
Physicians are properly informed of 
this risk. 
SmPC section 4.8 states that rare 
events involving the nervous 
system which occurred in patients 
treated with fingolimod at higher 
doses (1.25 or 5.0 mg) including 
posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome. 
Neurological atypical disorders 
have also been reported, such as 
ADEM-like events. Physicians are 
properly informed of this risk. 
SmPC section 4.8 includes 
information on the small number of 
cases with possible 
thromboembolic events (including 
cerebrovascular and peripheral 
vascular events) observed in the 
fingolimod clinical trial program. 
SmPC Sections 4.4 and 5.1 include 
results of the thorough QT study 
which showed a prolongation of 
mean corrected QT interval, with 
the upper limit of the 90% CI 
≤13.0 msec on fingolimod

According to SmPC section 4.2, 
fingolimod has not been studied in 
patients with renal impairment in 
the MS pivotal studies. Based on 
clinical pharmacology studies, no 
dose adjustments are needed in 
patients with mild to severe renal 
impairment. 
According to SmPC section 4.5, co-
administration of fingolimod with 
ketoconazole resulted in a 1.7-fold 
increase in fingolimod and 
fingolimod phosphate exposure 
(AUC). Caution should be exercised 
with substances that may inhibit 
CYP3A4 (protease inhibitors, azole 
antifungals, some macrolides such 
as clarithromycin or telithromycin). 
According to SmPC section 4.5, 
when fingolimod is used with 
atenolol, there is an additional 
15% reduction of heart rate at 
fingolimod treatment initiation. At 
treatment initiation in patients 
receiving beta blockers, or other 
substances which may decrease 
heart rate, caution should be 
exercised because of the additive 
effects on heart rate. The potential 
risks and benefits of initiating 
fingolimod treatment in patients 
already on a substance which 
lowers the heart rate should be 
considered. 
According to SmPC Section 4.2, 
fingolimod should be used with 
caution in patients aged 65 years 
and over due to insufficient data on 
safety and efficacy. 
The safety and efficacy of 
fingolimod in children aged 0 to 
18 years have not yet been 
established. Currently available 
data are described in section 5.2 of 
SmPC but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made.

Proposed risk minimization 
activities (routine and 
additional) 
According to SmPC Section 4.6, 
before initiation of fingolimod 
treatment, women of childbearing 
potential should be counseled on 
the potential for serious risk to the 
fetus and the need for effective 
contraception during treatment 
with fingolimod. Since it takes 
approximately two months to 
eliminate fingolimod from the body 
on stopping treatment (see section 
4.4), the potential risk to the fetus 
may persist and contraception 
should be continued during that 
period. It should be confirmed that 
a woman is not pregnant at the 
time of initiation of treatment. 
While on treatment, women should 
not become pregnant and active 
contraception is recommended. If a 
woman becomes pregnant while 
taking Gilenya, discontinuation of 
Gilenya is recommended. 
Fingolimod is excreted in milk of 
treated animals during lactation. 
Because of the potential for serious 
adverse drug reactions in nursing 
infants from fingolimod, women 
receiving fingolimod should not 
breast feed. 
Recommendation in the SmPC 
Section 4.4 that patients with 
diabetes mellitus undergo an 
ophthalmologic evaluation prior to 
initiating fingolimod therapy and 
have follow-up evaluations while 
receiving fingolimod therapy. 
According to the SmPC section 4.2, 
fingolimod has not been studied in 
MS patients with concomitant 
diabetes mellitus. It should be used 
with caution in patients with 
diabetes mellitus due to a potential 
increased risk of macular edema. 
Recommendation in the SmPC 
Section 4.4 that patients with 2nd-
degree or higher AV blocks, sick-
sinus-syndrome, ischemic cardiac 
disease, or congestive heart failure 
the use of fingolimod be based on 
overall benefit-risk assessment and 
that they undergo careful 
observation during initiation of 
therapy due to potential for serious 
rhythm disturbances. Before 
initiation of treatment in these 
patients, advice from a cardiologist 
is recommended.

Based on the small numbers of 
cases and short duration of 
exposure, the relationship to 
Gilenya remains uncertain. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application is of the opinion that the following 
risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: 
The MAH shall ensure that, following discussions and agreement with the National Competent 
Authorities in each Member State where GILENYA is marketed, at launch and after launch all 
physicians who intend to prescribe GILENYA are provided with a physician information pack containing 
the following elements:

The physician’s checklist shall contain the following key messages: 
 
The need to monitor patient heart rate after the first dose of GILENYA (or when the last dose of 
GILENYA has been administered more than two weeks ago) for signs and symptoms of bradycardia 
during at least 6 hours. 
  GILENYA should not be co-administered to patients receiving Class IA or Class III anti-arrhythmic 
medicines. 
  Caution when using GILENYA in patients with a cardiac disease or those taking medicines 
concomitantly known to decrease heart rate. 
  GILENYA reduces peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. There is the need to check prior to initiation 
and to monitor during treatment with GILENYA the patient’s peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC).  
  GILENYA may increase the risk of infections. There is the need to delay treatment initiation in 
patients with severe active infection until resolution. Suspension of treatment during serious 
infections should be considered. Concomitant treatment with immunosuppressants or immune 
modulating medicines should be avoided. 
 
The need to instruct patients to immediately report signs and symptoms of infections to their 
prescriber during and up to two months after treatment with GILENYA.

Fingolimod  is  a  structural  analogue  to  endogenous  sphingosine,  phosphorylated  to  the  active  moiety 
FTY720-P  which  down-modulates  S1P1  receptors  on  lymphocytes  and  slows  down  the  S1P-S1P1-
dependent  egress  kinetics  of  CD4  and  CD8  T  cells  and  B  cells  from  lymph  nodes.  This  reduces  the 
recirculation of lymphocytes from lymph nodes into blood and CNS. In vivo effects were demonstrated 
in several EAE disease models. 
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and 
is the one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults. In humans, fingolimod 
leads to a dose-dependent decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count. This may potentially reduce 
the  infiltration  of  pathogenic  lymphocyte  cells  into  the  CNS  where  they  would  be  involved  in 
inflammation and nervous tissue damage.  
Currently, no oral medication is approved for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. All available 
disease modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis are administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly or 
intravenously. The drug product has the advantage that it can be administered orally without regard to 
food intake. The proposed dose is 0.5 mg daily. 
Study  D2301  was    a  2  year,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  randomized  study    in  patients  17  to  55 
years,  with RRMS and an EDSS score of 0 to 5.5 who had had at least one relapse in the previous year 
or  at  least  two  relapses  in  the  previous  two  years.  Overall,  this  pivotal  phase  III  study  of  adequate 
duration  and  methodology,  showed  consistent  and  robust  efficacy  of  fingolimod  (1.25  and  0.5  mg) 
both on the primary efficacy criteria (aggregate annualized relapse rate ARR) and all secondary clinical 
and  MRIs  efficacy  criteria  as  compared  to  placebo.  The  results  on  primary  efficacy  parameter  (ITT 
population)  showed  statistically  significantly  lower  aggregate  ARR  at  all  doses  tested  (0.5  mg  :  0.18,  
95%  CI:  0.15,  0.22;    1.25  mg:  0.16,  95%  CI:  0.13,  0.19)  versus  placebo  (0.40,    95%  CI:  0.34, 
0.47),representing  relative  reduction    of  54%  and  60%,  respectively  in  the  annualized  relapse  rate 
(ARR  ratio:  0.40  and  0.46  for  1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg,  respectively).  Results  on  the  key  secondary 
endpoint,  time  to  disability  progression  confirmed  at  3  months,  was  also  statistically  longer  with  all 
doses  tested  than  with  placebo.  Fingolimod  reduced  the  risk  of  disability  progression,  confirmed  at  3 
months, over the 24-month study period (0.5 mg: HR= 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.93, p=0.017; 1.25 mg:  
0.5  mg:  HR=  0.70,  95%  CI:  0.52,  0.96,  p=0.024)  as  compared  to  placebo.  Both  doses  showed 
consistent  efficacy  on  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints.  The  results  did  not  seem  to  evidence 
clinical difference of relevance in the efficacy results for the two doses, and the choice of 0.5 mg dose 
choice was considered appropriate. 
Study D2302 was a one year duration, phase III, double-blind, double dummy, 2 doses of fingolimod 
(1.5 mg and 0.5mg, once a day) active controlled randomized study of one year duration, in patients 
18  to  55  years  with  RRMS  and  an  EDSS  score  0  to  5.5  who  had  had  at  least  one  relapse  in  the 
previous  year  or  at  least  two  relapses  in  the  previous  two  years.  Overall,  this  well  design  active 
controlled  study  showed  superior  efficacy  of  both  doses  (1.5  mg  and  0.5  mg)  of  fingolimod  as 
compared to Avonex on primary efficacy criteria (ARR). For the ITT population the aggregate ARR was 
statistically  significantly  lower  with  fingolimod  at  all  doses  tested  (0.5  mg  :  0.16,    95%  CI:  ,  0.122, 
0.212,  p<0.001  ;    1.25  mg:  0.20,  95%  CI:  0.157,0.264,  p<0.001)  versus  interferon  beta-1a    (0.33,  
95%  CI:  0.262,  0.417),  representing  relative  reductions  of  52%  and  38%,  respectively,  in  the 
annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR  ratio:  0.62  and  0.48  for  1.25  mg  and  0.5  mg,  respectively).  Regarding 
key secondary endpoints, both fingolimod treatment groups had a lower mean number of new or newly 
enlarged  T2  lesions  compared  to  the  interferon  beta-1a  i.m.  group,  which  reached  statistical 
significance  for  both  the  fingolimod  1.25  mg  group  (p<0.001)  and  the  fingolimod  0.5  mg  group 
(p=0.004).  
There was no obvious evidence of rebound effect based on MRI data.

Additional  post-hoc  subgroup  analyses  in  highly  active  patients  with  RRMS  were  performed  by  the 
applicant  to  evaluate  the  benefit-risk  in  a  restricted  population.  Results  of  these  subgroups  analyses 
were consistent with those obtained in the overall population.   
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Regarding  key  secondary  endpoints,    there  was  no  difference  between  the  two  fingolimod  treatment 
groups and the interferon beta-1a i.m. group in the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression 
as  based  on  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  (0.5  mg:  difference=2.03,  95%  CI:  -1.42,  5.47,  p=0.247,  1.25 
mg: difference=1.30, 95% CI: -2.26, 4.86, p=0.498) . This may be explained by the shorter duration 
of  the  trial  D2302  (one  year)  and  low  active  population  included.  However,  efficacy  on  the  2  year 
placebo controlled study (D2301) is supportive on this aspect. 
Relapsing MS including both RRMS and SPMS that still experienced relapses was not studied. 
The elderly population was not studied. 
There  is  a  lack  of  information  concerning  disease  activity  (frequency  and  severity  of  relapses)  after 
discontinuation of fingolimod.  
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
Safety concerns associated with the biologic effects of fingolimod were reported on the cardiac, ocular, 
immune, hepatic, and pulmonary systems. These were also observed in the non clinical studies.  
Infection  is  an  important  identified  unfavourable  effect.  The  incidence  of  infection  and  infestation 
serious adverse events appeared to be increased during the 24 month-treatment. A total of 3 cases of 
disseminated  herpes  infection  were  reported  in  patients  treated  with  fingolimod  1.25  mg.  In  these 
cases,  2  deaths  were  reported.  The  third  patient  had  disseminated  herpes  zoster  with  pulmonary 
involvement and made a complete recovery after treatment with aciclovir therapy.  
Among the cases for malignancies reported in the fingolimod groups , a total of 3 cases of lymphoma 
in MS clinical development program were identified and a causal relationship between those cases and 
treatment by fingolimod can not be excluded. With a population more than 4,000 patients exposed to 
fingolimod (approximately 10,000 patient-years, the estimated incidence of lymphoma with fingolimod 
is 3 in 10,000 patient years (95%CI: 0.6-8.8 per 10,000 patient years). In contrast, no lymphoma has 
been reported in the placebo arm nor in the interferon arm.  
Other unfavourable effects that were reported more commonly in MS patients treated with fingolimod 
than in placebo-treated patients included: reductions in white blood cell counts (lymphocytes and total 
WBC), bradycardia on treatment initiation (Day 1), elevations of liver enzymes (in particular increases 
in ALT and GGT), macular edema, hypertension and dyspnea. In addition, a number of cases of severe 
neurological  adverse  events  were  reported  including  2  cases  of  PRES  (Posterior  reversible 
Encephalopathy  Syndrome)  and  one  fatal  case  suggestive  of  acute  disseminated  encephalomyelitis 
(ADEM). 
In preclinical studies, fingolimod has shown a teratogenic potential. A total of 30 out of 52 pregnancies 
were  reported  in  fingolimod-treated  patients  in  the  clinical  studies  including  a  total  of  2380  female 
patients  as  of  29  January  2010.  Thirteen  successful  deliveries  with  12  normal  newborns  and  1  case 
report of congenital shortening of the right leg with congenital posteromedial bowing of the tibia were 
observed.  Limited information was available on abortions, however, one abortion was reported to  be 
due to Fallot’s tetralogy (fetal abnormality) in a female patient on fingolimod 1.25 mg. Considering the 
Gilenya 
ASSESSMENT REPORT 
EMA/108602/2011  
Page 114/117
 
 
 
the  population  fingolimod  is  intended  to  be  used  for,  this  finding  is  considered  as  an  important 
unfavourable effect.  
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects. 
Considering the heterogeneous safety profile, further long term data are required and a post-approval 
5  year  safety  study  will  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  risk  management  plan  to  further  investigate  a 
number  of  risks  and  potential  complications  such  as  hypertension,  liver  enzyme  elevation,  macular 
edema, infections, thromboembolic events, skin cancer and other malignant neoplasms. 
Additional  data  are  required  to  further  document  the  potential  risk  of  malignancies  and  this  will  be 
additionally monitor in a long term observational study which is part of the risk management plan. 
PRES syndromes and other neurological atypical manifestations (ADEM) were reported, the relationship 
with fingolimod cannot be excluded and this concern has been identified as an important potential risk. 
Given  the  effect  of  teratogenicity  seen  in  rats  and the  embryo/fetotoxic  effect  in  rabbits,  an  effective 
contraception  is  recommended  during  treatment  and  2  months  after  treatment  discontinuation.  A 
pregnancy  exposure  registry  to  prospectively  collect  outcome  data  on  the  babies  born  to  women 
treated  with  fingolimod  is  an  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity  set  up  as  part  of  the  risk 
management plan. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  effects  demonstrated  versus  placebo  as  well  as  the  active  comparator  Avonex  were  considered 
clinically  relevant  in  the  overall  population.  Oral  administration  was  considered  to  be  of  particular 
benefit  given  that  the  currently  available  therapies  are  using  the  parenteral  route.  A  number  of 
important  safety  concerns  have  been  identified  related  to  the  mechanism  of  action  that is first in  the 
class.  The  safety  of  fingolimod  is  characterised  by  a  heterogeneous  profile  which  required  to 
recommend a restricted use in multiple sclerosis population as well as a number of measures to ensure 
safe  and  effective  use  of  the  product.  Consistent  treatment  effects  were  observed  in  highly  active 
group of RRMS patients as compared to the overall population and therefore this restricted population 
was recommended for the indication.. 
  Benefit-risk balance 
Having considered the benefits of this first oral treatment for multiple sclerosis over the potential and 
identified  risks,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  benefit  risk  balance  for  Gilenya  is  positive  for  the 
following indication: 
“GILENYA is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis for the following adult patient groups:  
Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon.  
These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon. Patients should have had at least 1 
relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial 
MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion.  
A “non-responder” could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or 
ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year,  
or  
patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more

disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a 
significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI." 
Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
- 
pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns 
- 
the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: 
The MAH shall ensure that, following discussions and agreement with the National Competent 
Authorities in each Member State where GILENYA is marketed, at launch and after launch all 
physicians who intend to prescribe GILENYA are provided with a physician information pack containing 
the following elements:

GILENYA has been administered more than two weeks ago) for signs and symptoms of bradycardia 
during at least 6 hours. 
  GILENYA should not be co-administered to patients receiving Class IA or Class III anti-arrhythmic 
medicines. 
  Caution when using GILENYA in patients with a cardiac disease or those taking medicines 
concomitantly known to decrease heart rate. 
  GILENYA reduces peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. There is the need to check prior to initiation 
and to monitor during treatment with GILENYA the patient’s peripheral lymphocyte count (CBC).  
  GILENYA may increase the risk of infections. There is the need to delay treatment initiation in 
patients with severe active infection until resolution. Suspension of treatment during serious 
infections should be considered. Concomitant treatment with immunosuppressants or immune 
modulating medicines should be avoided. 
 
The need to instruct patients to immediately report signs and symptoms of infections to their 
prescriber during and up to two months after treatment with GILENYA. 
  Specific recommendations regarding vaccination for patients initiating or currently on GILENYA 
treatment. 
 
The need for a full ophthalmologic assessment 3-4 months after starting GILENYA therapy for the 
early detection of visual impairment due to drug-induced macular edema. 
 
The need for ophthalmologic assessment prior to initiation and during treatment with GILENYA in 
patients with diabetes mellitus or with a history of uveitis.

 
The teratogenic risk of GILENYA: the importance of avoiding pregnancy when undergoing 
treatment with GILENYA and the need to confirm a negative pregnancy test result prior to 
treatment initiation. 
 
The need to advise women of child-bearing potential on the serious risk to a fetus and to practice 
effective contraception during and for at least two months following discontinuation of treatment 
with GILENYA. 
 
The need for a liver function test prior to treatment initiation and for liver function monitoring at 
months 1, 3 and 6 during GILENYA therapy and periodically thereafter.  
 
The need to provide patients with the patient reminder card. 
The patient reminder card shall contain the following key messages: 
 
The need to monitor patient heart rate after the first dose of GILENYA (or when the last dose of 
GILENYA has been administered more than two weeks ago) for signs and symptoms of bradycardia 
during at least 6 hours. 
 
The need to immediately report signs and symptoms of infections to the prescriber during and up 
to two months after treatment with GILENYA. 
 
The need to immediately report signs of visual impairment to the prescriber during and up to two 
months after treatment with GILENYA. 
  Women with childbearing potential must ensure effective contraception during and for at least two 
months following discontinuation of treatment with GILENYA. Any (intended or unintended) 
pregnancy during and two months following discontinuation of treatment with GILENYA must 
immediately be reported to the prescriber: where available contact details for teratogenic 
information services should be provided. 
 
The need for a liver function test prior to treatment initiation and for liver function monitoring at 
months 1, 3 and 6 during GILENYA therapy and periodically thereafter.  
2.9.   Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Gilenya as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: 
- Patients with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta-interferon.  
These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course 
(normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon. Patients should have had at least 1 
relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial 
MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion.  
A “non-responder” could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or 
ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year, 
or  
- Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more 
disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a 
significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
was favourable  and therefore recommended the granting of the  marketing authorisation.

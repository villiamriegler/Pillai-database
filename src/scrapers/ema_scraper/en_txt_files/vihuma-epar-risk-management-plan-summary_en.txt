PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for vihuma 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for vihuma. The RMP details important 
risks of vihuma, how these risks can be minimised and how more information will be obtained 
about vihuma’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
vihuma’s summary of product characteristics (SPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how vihuma should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  vihuma  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of vihuma’s 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
vihuma is authorized for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency). It contains simoctocog alfa as the active substance and it is 
given by intravenous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of vihuma’s benefits can be found in vihuma’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage.

II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of  vihuma,  together with  measures  to minimise such risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about vihuma’s risks, are outlined below.  
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition to these measures, information about adverse  reactions is collected  continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
 
If important information that may affect the safe use of vihuma is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A.  List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  vihuma  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of vihuma. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Evidence  for  linking

risk 
to 
The  formation  of  inhibitors  against  factor  VIII  is  the  most 
important complication in haemophilia treatment. Inhibitors are 
antibodies against factor VIII produced by the body’s immune 
system,  and  which  can  cause  the  medicine  to  stop  working, 
resulting  in  a  loss  of  bleeding  control  and  potentially  fatal 
massive bleeding episodes. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Inhibitors occur in up to 30% of patients with severe haemophilia 
A, most frequently in young children after less than 20 days of 
exposure (treatment). 
The main genetic risk factors are a family history of inhibitors 
and certain types of mutations on the factor VIII gene.

Risk  factors  and  risk 
groups 
Patients  with  existing  cardiovascular  risk  factors  -  like  raised 
blood pressure, raised blood sugar, smoking, and overweight and 
obesity - may have a higher risk of events involving the heart or 
blood vessels when being treated with factor VIII products like 
vihuma. 
The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and 
stroke  are  unhealthy  diet,  physical  inactivity,  tobacco  use  and 
harmful  use  of  alcohol.  These  risk  factors  may  show  up  in 
individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised 
blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. 
The  incidence  of  hypertension,  smoking  and  diabetes  may  be 
higher  in  haemophilia  patients  than  in  the  general  male

Risk  factors  and  risk 
groups 
In patients who receive vihuma via central venous access 
devices (CVAD), local blood clots may form at the catheter site 
which may increase the risk of subsequent bacterial infection at 
the catheter site. Clot formation may also result in a 
malfunction of the CVAD. Very rarely local blood clots may 
travel into the lungs and cause a life-threatening or fatal 
reaction. 
Risk factors for thromboembolic events: 
Obesity;  age 
(elderly);  hypertension;  diabetes  mellitus; 
hyperlipidaemia;  history  of  vascular  disease;  history  of 
thrombotic  episodes;  acquired  or 
thrombophilic 
disorders; prolonged periods of immobilisation; hypovolaemia; 
renal  insufficiency;  liver  disease  (cirrhosis,  impaired  liver 
function,  etc.);  atrial  fibrillation;  severe  muscle  haemorrhage, 
crush  injury,  or  orthopaedic  surgery  in  haemophilia  patients;

Especially  at  the  beginning  of  home  therapy,  errors  in  the 
administration  or  dosing  of  vihuma  may  occur  and  thorough 
training  is  needed.  The  package  leaflet  of  vihuma  clearly 
describes how the medicine should be given. Patients requiring 
treatment with vihuma may be trained to self-inject the clotting 
factor product or receive it by a trained family member.

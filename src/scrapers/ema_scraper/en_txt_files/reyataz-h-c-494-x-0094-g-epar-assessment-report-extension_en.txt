1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG, (MAH) submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 3 March 2015, an application for a grouping of variations in 
accordance with Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1243/208, consisting of an extension 
of the marketing authorisation, a type II C.1.6.a variation and a Type IB C.1.11.z. variation for 
Reyataz. 
The MAH applied for an extension of the marketing authorisation consisting of the addition of a new 
strength and pharmaceutical form (50mg oral powder) to support the extension of the target 
population covered by the authorised therapeutic indication for Reyataz to treat HIV-1 infected 
paediatric patients of at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg, in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products. 
The MAH applied for the following indication for the 50mg oral powder: 
REYATAZ oral powder, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1infected paediatric patients at least 
3 months of age and weighing at least 5kg (see section 4.2). 
Based on available virological and clinical data from adult patients, no benefit is expected in patients 
with strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (≥4PI mutations). The choice of REYATAZ in 
treatment experienced adult and paediatric patients should be based on individual viral resistance 
testing and the patient’s treatment history (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
For the approved 100mg, 150mg, 200mg and 300mg hard capsules, the applicant requested the 
following variations: 
Extension of Indication to include the treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 6 to less 
than 18 years with strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors (≥4PI mutations). 
As a consequence, sections section 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC were updated in light of 
new paediatric data.  
The Package Leaflet and the RMP (v.10) are updated in accordance. 
Update of the RMP (v.10) to address the requirement  of lack of long-term safety data and the 
inclusion of category 3 additional pharmacovigilance activities, interim long term safety reports from 
Stage 2 (follow-up part) of Studies AI424397 and AI424451 up to the study completion. This RMP also 
includes an update of paediatric-related data and minor revisions concerning nephrolithiasis. 
The requested variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I (point 2 c and d) thereof – 
Extension of marketing authorisation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Reyataz (atazanavir; ATV) is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI). The compound selectively 
inhibits the virus-specific processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing 
formation of mature virions and infection of other cells. It is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 
infected adults and children aged 6 years and older in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products.  
Reyataz is currently approved as 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg capsules of atazanavir. An oral 
Powder (50 mg/1.5 g oral powder, equivalent to 50 mg atazanavir free base) for use in adults only was 
approved but has not been marketed in the EU. 
The current capsule dosing recommendations for paediatric patients at least 6 years of age are 150, 
200, and 300 mg ATV (all with 100 mg RTV) for patients with body weights of 15 - < 20 kg, 20 - < 40 
kg, and ≥40 kg, respectively. The adult dose is 300 mg ATV, also with 100 mg RTV. 
An extension application (EMEA/H/C/494/X/58) for the addition of a sachet presentation for the oral 
powder, where each sachet contains 1.5 g oral powder equivalent to 50 mg atazanavir free base 
(containing aspartame 10%) for use in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients from 3 months to <6 years of 
age weighing 5 to <25 kg was submitted in 2009.  
However, during the initial evaluation, it was concluded that the dose selection of atazanavir boosted 
with ritonavir in the MAH’s claimed paediatric indication, i.e. in children above 3 months of age, was far 
from being adequately substantiated by the MAH in support of the claimed extension of indication in 
children. Indeed, both the clinical study AI424020 and the PPK analysis that supported the indication 
suffered from critical deficiencies. As a consequence a major objection was raised by the CHMP. 
The main concern was a greater peak-to-trough ratio in children as compared to adult patients. From 
the data provided by the MAH, it was confirmed that mean Cmax values were higher, whereas mean 
Cmin values were lower in younger patients compared to older patients. However, mean AUC values 
were similar for patients in the whole age range from 6 to 13 years.  Overall, it is clear that a greater 
peak-to-trough ratio was mainly observed in the youngest children and that in patients aged 6 years 
and older, this concern was quite alleviated with a significant less higher peak-to-trough ratio. 
In response to the CHMP concern, the MAH has only retained the limit of 6 years of age in its revised 
claim for the paediatric extension. The CHMP agreed with this proposal given the limitation of the data 
in younger children. In conclusion, on the basis of study AI424020, the indication of Reyataz was only 
extended to children ≥ 6 years of age with the current marketed capsules. 
The current application (EMEA/H/C/000494/X/0094/G) for Reyataz consists of:  
• 
• 
Line extension with the addition of an oral powder presentation (50 mg/sachet), 
Extension  of  indication  to paediatric  patient  at  least  3  months  of  age  and  weighing  at  least 5 
kg. 
This new application is supported by 2 clinical studies (AI424397 and AI424451) and a PK/PD analysis.

According the current approved protease inhibitors for use in the paediatric population, there is a 
clinical need for children under 2 years of age. Therefore, a line extension of Reyataz for infants and 
children ≥ 3 months of age and ≥ 5 kg is welcomed. 
Two studies, AI424397 and AI424451, evaluated the PK, dose regimen, and efficacy and safety of 
atazanavir following administration of the ATV oral powder formulation. Previously, the relative 
bioavailability of the ATV powder formulation (10% aspartame) initially used in paediatric clinical trials 
had been assessed in Study AI424025. A taste assessment study (AI424466) was conducted in healthy 
adult subjects to compare the initial 10% aspartame formulation with the proposed 4.2% aspartame 
containing formulation. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as oral powder containing 50 mg of atazanavir (as sulphate) as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are: aspartame (E951), sucrose and orange vanilla flavour. 
The product is available in polyester film/aluminum/polyethylene sealant film sachets, as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance, atazanavir sulphate, used in the manufacture of Reyataz powder for oral use is 
the same being used for the approved Reyataz 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg hard. No new 
information on the active substance has been provided within this line extension application.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of this line extension was to develop an alternative formulation to the currently marketed hard 
capsules, adequate for paediatric use (patients from 3 months to 6 years who may have difficulties in 
swallowing capsules) with a suitable strength to provide appropriate dose increments. 
The finished product is an off-white to pale yellow powder packaged in sachets containing atazanavir 
sulphate (equivalent to 50 mg of atazanavir base), aspartame and sucrose as sweeteners, and orange 
vanilla flavour. Each sachet dosage unit contains 1500 mg of oral powder. The lowest possible unit 
strength was chosen in order to achieve flexible dosing across all body weights. 
Atazanavir sulphate is a non-hygroscopic, ionisable compound, thus its aqueous solubility and partition 
coefficient are pH-dependent.  The solubility of atazanavir sulphate is pH-dependant. It is classified as 
a low solubility and highly permeable drug according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016 
Page 10/99 
 
 
 
 
 
(BCS class II). Atazanavir is produced as a non-solvate The oral powder manufacturing process does 
not have an impact on the active substance crystalline form.  
The strategy for formulation and process development followed a quality by design (QbD) approach. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) used to guide development was: a powder for oral use with 
acceptable taste containing 50 mg of atazanavir per sachet, targeted for patients ranging from 3 
months to 8 years. The product is to be packaged in PET/Al/LLDPE sachets and should offer rapid 
dissolution and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. It should meet the specifications and have a 
shelf-life of at least 24 months at room temperature.  
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the finished product are: appearance, identity, assay, content 
uniformity, impurities and microbial limits. 
The product development aimed at obtaining a powder of acceptable taste in the targeted paediatric 
population (3 months to 8 years), which could be easily poured from the sachet to ensure complete 
drug delivery, and showing rapid dissolution and absorption.  
A powder for oral multidose suspension was first considered.  The first prototype (prototype I) 
formulation was tested in a human relative bioavailability study which showed that its bioavailability 
was lower relative to the registered Reyataz hard capsules formulation with respect to atazanavir 
Cmax and AUC(INF). It was hypothesized that one of the excipients selected was responsible for the 
lower bioavailability. Therefore, the development of powder for oral suspension was discontinued.  
A modified dispersible powder formulation (prototype II) was thus developed.  A second relative 
bioavailability study with the revised formulation indicated similar bioavailability with respect to 
atazanavir AUC(INF) to that of the Reyataz hard capsules formulation. Therefore, the revised II 
formulation was selected for further development.  
This formulation was further modified to comply with the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) request 
from the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO) to reduce the level of one of the exicipients proposed to 
levels below the limit set by the EU Food Safety Authority acceptable daily intake for all recommended 
doses based on age/weight group. .  The formulation was adjusted to ensure an acceptable palatability 
and sweetness and the same drug substance to total excipient ratio were maintained. A number of 
prototype formulations using various high intensity sweeteners were further developed and evaluated 
for stability. Based on the outcome of the stability study, two prototype formulations were selected to 
be carried through in an adult taste studyagainst the previously revised formulation. Based on these 
results, the final formulation for further development and commercialisation was selected.  
A biowaiver for the reduced aspartame formulation used in Phase 3 clinical studies and proposed for 
commercialisation was requested and accepted based on: 
- Demonstration of high permeability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. 
 -Demonstration that the change in formulation will not affect gastric emptying, secretion, and/or 
pH;     
- Comparison of the compositions of the formulations, showing that the overall drug-to-total 
excipient ratio is unchanged. 
-Demonstration of similar dissolution profiles between the revised and final formulations in different 
media. 
The phase 2 and 3 clinical trials were conducted using a multi-dose bottle presentation. Later, phase 3 
clinical trials were conducted using 50 mg sachet dosage unit presentation. The sachet presentation 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016 
Page 11/99 
 
 
 
 
 
was developed to reduce the risk of adulteration and miss counting the number of scoops especially for 
doses ≥150 mg. The sachet presentation utilised the same bulk blend composition and manufacturing 
process as that used for the multi-dose bottle presentation. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients which are commonly used as taste masking 
agents in paediatric formulations. Aspartame and sucrose (sweeteners) comply with the requirements 
of the Ph.Eur. monographs. An in-house monograph was presented for the non-compendial excipient 
orange-vanilla flavor (flavouring agent). This was considered acceptable. However, the applicant is 
recommended to evaluate the feasibility to develop an alternative method for identity. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The assurance of the active and excipient 
compatibility is confirmed by the long term stability study of the finished product.   
In addition, in–use compatibility studies were conducted to support the stability of atazanavir sulphate 
powder for oral use dispersed in food vehicles. They are described in the stability section of this report. 
The manufacturing development was evaluated through the use of a failure mode effect analysis 
(FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an 
influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the experience 
from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. The development adequately 
addressed the impact of the milling/mixing process parameters on the quality attributes of the blend, 
performing a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and several design of experiments (DOE).Sachet 
filling has also been sufficiently studied. The proposed overfill has been adequately justified. The 
appropriateness of the filling process parameters were demonstrated by extensive sampling from nine 
commercial batches.  
With regards to the proposed QC dissolution method, attempts were made by the applicant to improve 
its discriminatory power. Method parameters that could potentially have an impact on the 
discriminating ability of the method were also assessed. The dissolution experiments performed 
indicate that the dissolution profile remains unaffected by altering the studied method parameters. 
Moreover the chosen conditions for the dissolution method were able to discriminate the prototype and 
final formulations which showed different in vivo behaviour, demonstrating the in vivo relevance of the 
method. Considering the formulation and the manufacturing process, the proposed QC dissolution 
method is deemed acceptable.The primary packaging proposed for marketing is foil laminated sachets 
made from PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate)/Al(Aluminium)/LLDPE (Linear Low Density Polyethylene). 
Appropriate testing standards have been described for the laminated foil of the sachet and for the 
LLDPE bag used to store the final powder blend. The sealant film of the sachet that comes in contact 
with the product as well as the LLDPE material of the bulk bag comply with in the EU 10/2011 directive 
and subsequent revisions.  
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process includes a series of high-impact milling and high-shear mixing operations 
followed by filling the final blend into sachet dosage units. As mentioned in the stability section of the 
report, bulk holding time was also validated.  
Transportation of the final blend from the site of manufacture to the site of sachet filling was validated. 
Overall, the manufacturing process description is sufficiently detailed and the process parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016 
Page 12/99 
 
 
 
 
 
ranges are in line with those defined during process development.  In process controls are deemed 
sufficient.  
Based on the amount on knowledge gained during development and since the manufacturing process is 
a standard process, in line with the EMA guideline on process validation 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1), a process validation scheme to be conducted at 
commercial scale prior to marketing has been presented.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (HPLC, IR:ATR), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur). The proposed acceptance 
criteria are supported by commercial batch results and stability data and are in line with ICH guidance 
where applicable.  
The proposed specification is supported by data from eleven commercial scale batches, stability data 
and formulation and process development data. The absence of a test for water content has been 
adequately justified.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay has been presented.  
Batch analysis results are provided for eleven commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (5 °C and 30 °C / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
at 40 °C / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches of medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
In addition, one batch was tested after exposure to the stress condition of 50 °C, seven  freeze-thaw 
cycles (between -20 °C and 40 °C / 75% RH ), and exposure to 30 °C / 75% RH and room light in an 
open sachet. 
A bulk stability study was also conducted on one batch of atazanavir powder for oral use packaged in 
the bulk container through 12 months of storage at 30 °C / 65% RH. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, related substances, aspartame degradant, water content 
and dissolution. Identification, content uniformity and microbial quality were also assessed in long term 
studies. The analytical procedures used have been appropriately validated and are stability indicating.  
No significant changes were observed in the long-term stability studies apart from a slight change in 
colour after 24 months storage at 30 °C / 75% RH with no impact on assay or degradation products.  
Stability results from accelerated studies also showed a change in powder colour after 6 months 
storage), and a slight increase of aspartame degradant within the specification limits. No trends were 
observed in any of the other parameters.

The results from the stress study showed an increase in aspartame degradant at 50 °C . No change 
was observed in any of the other parameters. In the freeze-thaw cycling studies all parameters 
remained with acceptance criteria and only a slight increase in total impurities was evidenced. The 
open-sachet studies showed an increase in water content in the light-exposed and protected samples, 
with no impact on the other parameters. They also showed that the powder is not sensitive to room 
light exposure. 
As mentioned in the manufacture section of the report, bulk holding time was also evaluated and 
validated. The results showed little or no change in mean potency, total impurities, water content or 
dissolution, and appearance.  A change in powder colour and a slight increase of aspartame degradant 
results were observed. Also, two leachables from the container were identified at the 12-month time 
point. The levels of these leachables were below the reporting level through 9 months storage. Other 
parameters showed no significant changes. The applicant investigated the possibility of using an 
alternative packaging material, but no alternative was found. Based on a toxicological evaluation of 
these leachables, it was concluded that the levels observed at the 12 month time-point present 
negligible risk to children.  Nevertheless, these are controlled in the finished product specification. 
Therefore, the proposed bulk container and bulk storage period of six months are deemed acceptable 
at the time of opinion. However, the applicant is recommended to continue the efforts to substitute the 
proposed bulk product container with a different container that does not generate them, while assuring 
acceptable bulk stability. Since the product is to be administered by dispersing the powder in food 
vehicles, compatibility in –use studies were also conducted on three batches of finished product after 
storage for 0, 12 and 24 months at 30 °C / 75% RH, using different vehicles for dispersion according 
to a matrixing plan. The product mixed with food/vehicle was stored for up to 2 hours at 30 °C / 75% 
RH room-light exposed or protected. The results from these studies demonstrated that the product 
mixed with food/vehicle is not sensitive to room light exposure. Also, there was no significant change 
in the parameters tested, except for an increase in aspartame degradant for the powder mixed with 
some of the vehiclesNevertheless, the estimated intake of this degradant is significantly below the ADI 
levels (FAO, WHO). These data support the recommendation in the SmPC (section 6.6) that 
administration should be done within one hour of preparation. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without special storage 
conditions, and the in–use shelf-life after mixing with food or beverage of up to 1 hour at temperatures 
not above 30 °C, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
All excipients used in the manufacture of the finished product are non-animal derived materials, with 
the exception of sucrose. In the processing of sucrose, animal-derived bovine bone charcoal is used as 
a filtering agent. The charcoal is covered by a valid TSE CEP.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No new information on the active substance has been provided within this line extension application. 
The active substance has already been assessed as active substance in the already authorised Reyataz 
100, 150, 200 and 300 mg hard capsules.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
Assessment report

uniform performance in clinical use. Nevertheless, the applicant is recommended to further evaluate 
the feasibility to develop alternative method for the identification flavouring agent orange vainilla 
flavor, and to continue his efforts to substitute the current drug product bulk container with an 
alternative container that does not generate the leachables observed.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
-Although the specifications for the non-compendial excipient are considerate adequate at the time of 
opinion, the applicant is recommended to evaluate the feasibility to develop an alternative method for 
identity testing.  
-The proposed bulk product container is deemed acceptable. It has been demonstrated that the 
leachables observed present negligible risk to children. However, the applicant is recommended to 
continue the efforts to substitute the proposed bulk product container with a different container that 
does not generate them, while assuring acceptable bulk stability. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has not submitted any new non-clinical data in support of this application, but has provided a 
short justification based notably on the lack of nonclinical findings that preclude the paediatric use of 
Reyataz and the available clinical data in the paediatric population.   
An extension application (EMEA/H/C/494/X/58) for the addition of a sachet presentation for the oral 
powder, where each sachet contains 1.5 g oral powder equivalent to 50 mg atazanavir free base, for 
use in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients from 3 months to <6 years of age <25 Kg was submitted 
2009. No non-clinical data have been submitted to support this variation (notably no toxicity study in 
juvenile animals of a relevant species). Therefore the CHMP stated that the MAH should provide an up-
to date non-clinical overview, highlighting what is new and what is form the initial marketing 
authorisation application, with all the relevant published and/or proprietary data to support the 
indication for children of 3 months of age and older up to 25 kg. The safety of the use of atazanavir 
should be discussed in particular for infants, toddlers and children.  
On 10 August 2009, the MAH informed the CHMP on his decision to withdraw the application for a unit-
dose sachet for the Reyataz oral powder for children 3 months of age and older up to 25 kg in the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
Despite the lack of answer to the toxicology concern raised during the last extension application 
(EMEA/H/C/494/X/58) in 2009, it appears that no specific concerns were identified by the NcWG during 
the Paediatric Investigational Plan agreed on 27 October 2010. Therefore the lack of specific toxicity 
studies in juvenile animals could be considered as acceptable. Moreover, it is noted that no major 
system known to develop significantly during childhood, e.g. CNS, reproductive system, skeletal

system, was identified as target organ in toxicity studies. No adverse effect on fertility was noted in 
rats (in spite of altered oestrous cycling in female), no teratogenic effect was reported in either rats or 
rabbits, and offspring development was not significantly affected in the peri /post-natal toxicity study. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated environmental risk assessment (ERA) for atazanavir was recently conducted as part of the 
atazanavir/cobicistat fixed dose combination MAA filing (EVOTAZ, EMEA/H/C/003904). Although 
paediatric patients ages 3 months to 6 years are being added to current patient population for 
atazanavir (6 years and older), this group of patients was not excluded from the prevalence values 
used in the most recent ERA for atazanavir (which used a conservative assumption for HIV-1 
prevalence of the total population) and has be considered in the PEC calculation in MAA filing 
EMEA/H/C/003904. 
The doses of atazanavir (200-300 mg/day) for the new formulation are lower than what was used in 
the most recent PEC calculation (400 mg/day); accordingly the PEC calculation shown below which 
uses 400 mg/day can be considered conservative. The most recent calculation is shown in Equation 1.

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in support of this application. Atazanavir is authorised 
(150, 200, and 300 mg hard capsules) and extensive non-clinical data are available with Atazanavir. 
There are also comprehensive paediatric clinical data that adequately support the proposed paediatric 
population and indication. The CHMP considered that no new non-clinical data are required in support 
of this application. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that there are no non-clinical objections and/or concerns that will preclude the 
approval of the extension application.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development plan for ATV in paediatric patients was initially based on findings from Study 
AI424020 (also designated as Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group 1020-A) that exhibited comparable 
safety of the combination of ATV/ritonavir (RTV) to those in the adult studies. 
The data from Study AI424020 were previously submitted and reviewed to support the currently 
approved ATV capsule dosing in paediatric patients 6 years and older in the European Union (EU) and 
other countries. 
Two studies, AI424397 (PRINCE I) and AI424451 (PRINCE II) as well as a relative bioavailability study 
in adults (AI424025), and the results of a taste assessment study in adult healthy volunteers 
(AI424466) were submitted in support of this application.  
PRINCE I and PRINCE II evaluated the PK, dose regimen, and efficacy and safety of atazanavir 
following administration of the ATV oral powder formulation, coadministered with ritonavir, in 
paediatric patients aged ≥ 3 months to < 11 years with HIV infection. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

It has to be underlined that as part of the response to the D120 LOQ, the POPPK dataset was updated 
with paediatric data from studies AI424397 and AI424451. Although the updated model supports the 
originally proposed oral powder dosing recommendations for ATV, the capsule dosing 
recommendations were revised:

Development 
Atazanavir powder for oral use was developed for use in paediatric patients who are unable to swallow 
a solid oral dosage form. The original ATV powder formulation contained 10% aspartame, which 
exceeded the acceptable daily intake of 40 mg/kg/day as determined by the European Food Safety 
Authority (EFSA) in paediatric subjects in lower weight bands. Based on a Paediatric Committee 
(PDCO) request, the ATV oral powder was reformulated with reduced aspartame (4.2%) and sucrose 
substitution. 
The relative bioavailability of the ATV oral powder that was initially used in paediatric clinical trials was 
assessed in Study AI424025. The other clinical PK studies provided were studies AI424397 (PRINCE I)

2.4.2.1.  Methods 
Analytical methods 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company conducted the bioanalytical assay for ATV using a validated high 
performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS method). This analytical 
method was used in the clinical pharmacology study, AI424025. Tandem Labs, a bioanalytical contract 
research organization, conducted the analytical assay for ATV and ritonavir (RTV) using this validated 
LC-MS/MS method. The analytical method was also used in the paediatric clinical studies, AI424397 
and AI424451. 
MAH Atazanavir plasma LC-MS/MS Method 
Atazanavir was measured in human plasma by a validated high performance LC-MS/MS method. All 
plasma samples were obtained from blood collected into tubes containing potassium ethylene-diamine-
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an anticoagulant and processed by an off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) 
method. The validated method fulfilled all requirements and recommendations regarding linearity, 
precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at the time of the study. The data from the method 
validation runs demonstrated that the range of reliable response was 1 to 1,000 ng/mL, with a lower 
limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 1 ng/mL. Stability data were established as follows: bench-top stability 
in human plasma for at least 24 hours, 2 freeze-thaw cycles, and long-term stability at -20°C for 2 
weeks. Samples from all studies were analysed within these periods of known stability.

current requirements and recommendations regarding linearity, precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and 
specificity. The data from the method validation runs demonstrated that the range of reliable response 
were 10.0 to 10,000 ng/mL, with an LLOQ of 10.0 ng/mL for ATV and 5.0 to 5,000 ng/mL, with an 
LLOQ of 5.0 ng/mL for RTV. Stability data were established as follows: bench-top stability for at least 
24 hours, 6 freeze-thaw cycles, processed sample stability for at least 143 hours at room temperature, 
and long-term stability at -20°C for at least 777 days. Samples from all studies were analysed within 
these periods of known stability.

Relevant pharmacokinetic parameters of ATV were estimated using a non-compartmental analysis 
(NCA). The following pharmacokinetic parameters were provided: AUCinf, Cmax, Tmax, T1/2 and relative 
bioavailability (calculated as 
). 
AI424397 (PRINCE I) and AI424451 (PRINCE II): 
At week 2, the following relevant pharmacokinetic parameters of ATV were estimated using a non-
compartmental analysis (NCA): 
•  Cmax, 
•  AUCtau (Area under the concentration-time curve, in 1 dosing interval from time 0 to 24 hours post 
observed dose), 
•  Cmin (Plasma concentration 24 hours post observed dose. Pre-observed dose concentration is used 
as an estimate of Cmin if sample 24 hours post dose is not collected.), 
• 
Tmax, 
•  CLT/F (calculated as Dose/AUCtau),  
•  CLT/F/Kg.

2.4.2.4.  Absorption 
Bioequivalence  
Study AI424025 compared powder and capsule formulations in different conditions. 
Study AI424025: was an open-label, randomized, 4-treatment, 4-period, single-dose, crossover 
study balanced for first-order residual effects to assess the bioavailability of a 400 mg dose of ATV in a 
12-g oral powder formulation (10% aspartame formulation) relative to the capsule formulation dose of 
400 mg. Eight healthy subjects received the following 4 treatments in a random sequence:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
400 mg ATV in a modified 12-g powder formulation mixed with 4 ounces applesauce, 
400 mg ATV in a modified 12-g powder formulation mixed with 50 mL water, 
400 mg ATV dose (2 x 200 mg capsules) with water (reference treatment), 
The contents of 2 x 200 mg ATV capsules mixed with 4 ounces applesauce. 
The  study  took  place  from  10/02/2000  to  16/12/2000.  This  study  was  performed  in  accordance  with 
GCP.  The  clinical  phase  was  conducted  at  the  Clinical  Pharmacology  Unit  of  the  BMS  clinical  research 
centre  (Hamilton,  NJ,  USA).  Assays  for  drug  concentration,  PK  analysis  and  statistical  analysis  were 
performed by BMS.

All treatments were administered within 5 minutes of completing a light meal. Each period was 
separated by 72 hours and < 2 weeks. Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at pre-dose and 
up to 24 hours after each dose of study drug. Samples were taken pre-dose and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 
1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hours after dosing, in labelled tubes containing K3EDTA. 
Sample size of eight subjects was justified. 
2.4.2.5.  Study conduct and results 
Eight subjects entered the study. One subject withdrew consent after having received the first period 
dose, and was not replaced. Seven subjects completed the study and were included in the PK analysis. 
All subjects were male, and their age ranged from 28 to 41 years old. 
Atazanavir was readily absorbed following oral administration of single doses of 400 mg of ATV in an 
oral formulation mixed with applesauce or water, as intact capsules, or as capsule contents mixed with 
applesauce. Median peak plasma concentrations were achieved in 1.5 to 2 hours, with a mean half-life 
of approximately 5 hours. 
Table 8: Summary statistics for ATV in Study AI424025 
Treatments: A = ATV 400 mg in 12 g oral powder formulation mixed with 4 oz of applesauce; B = ATV 400 mg in 12 g oral powder 
formulation mixed with 50 mL of water; C = ATV 400 mg (2 x 200 mg) in a capsule formulation; D = contents of 2 x 200 mg ATV 
capsules mixed with 4 oz applesauce 
Relative to the capsule formulation, ATV maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was approximately 
22%, 27%, and 28% lower, following administration of the oral powder mixed with applesauce, the 
oral powder mixed with water, and the capsule contents mixed with applesauce, respectively. 
However, ATV area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time in all 3 
test treatments was similar to the reference capsule formulation; the ratio of geometric mean 90% 
confidence interval (CI) for the oral powder mixed with applesauce and water was contained within the 
usual criteria to conclude bioequivalence (0.80 to 1.25) with regard to ATV AUCinf, while the lower 
bound of the 90% CI for ATV AUCinf was just below 0.80 for the capsule contents mixed with 
applesauce.

Table 9: Summary of results of bioequivalence for ATV PK parameters in Study 
AI424025 
Treatments: A = ATV 400 mg in 12 g oral powder formulation mixed with 4 oz of applesauce; B = ATV 400 mg in 
12 g oral powder formulation mixed with 50 mL of water; C = ATV 400 mg (2 x 200 mg) in a capsule formulation; 
D = contents of 2 x 200 mg ATV capsules mixed with 4 oz applesauce 
Although this study was small (N=7), and was not powered to assess bioequivalence, based on ATV 
AUCinf, the ATV oral powder appeared to provide similar overall systemic exposures (i.e., AUCinf) to the 
ATV capsule. While ATV Cmax was slightly lower with the powder relative to the capsule, Cmax is not the 
expected PK parameter driving efficacy. Therefore, this formulation (with 10% aspartame) was 
selected for development in paediatric subjects. Results from this study supported the further 
assessment of this ATV oral powder formulation in the paediatric dose-finding study, AI424020. This 
ATV oral powder formulation was also utilized in Studies AI424397 and AI424451. 
2.4.2.6.  Influence of food 
In study AI424025, the oral powder (10% aspartame) was given in fed condition, and was mixed with 
either applesauce or water. There was no strict bioequivalence test between those two arms, but the 
PK parameters were in similar ranges between the two arms. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In Studies AI424397 and AI424451, the PK of ATV were evaluated following administration of the ATV 
oral powder formulation (assessed in Study AI424025) in paediatric patients with HIV infection aged 3 
months to < 11 years. The dose range of ATV studied was 150 to 300 mg in subjects weighing 5 to < 
35 kg, stratified by body weight, administered with RTV. The dosing regimens for these studies were 
selected using a PPK modelling and simulation approach, and the model included covariates such as 
body weight on clearance and relative bioavailability of different formulations in paediatric subjects. 
This model was used to aid in selecting dosing regimens that were predicted to provide systemic 
exposures to ATV (when boosted with RTV) that were comparable to those observed in adults. 
RTV-boosted ATV systemic exposures in paediatric were subjects similar to those demonstrated to be 
efficacious in the adult population.

AI424397 (PRINCE I) 
Study AI424397 (PRINCE I) is an ongoing prospective, single arm, open-label, international, 
multicentre study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK of ATV oral powder boosted with RTV liquid 
with an optimized nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) background therapy in HIV-infected 
paediatric patients 3 months to < 6 years of age. A secondary objective of the study was to assess the 
PK profile of ATV oral powder with RTV in paediatric subjects in terms of ATV Cmax and area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). There are 3 treatment groups in the study, based on body 
weight:  
•  5 to < 10 kg treated with ATV 150 mg once daily (QD), 
•  10 to < 15 kg treated with ATV 200 mg QD, 
•  15 to < 25 kg treated with ATV 250 mg QD,  
Each with RTV 80 mg oral solution QD and with an optimized NRTI background therapy. These doses of 
ATV oral powder in paediatric subjects were selected based on ATV systemic exposures that were 
projected by PK modelling and simulation to be similar to those observed in adults treated with ATV 
300 mg capsule formulation given with RTV 100 mg QD. 
Study AI424397 consisted of 2 stages. In Stage 1, all subjects were administered ATV oral powder 
(with RTV) at doses according to body weight. Subjects entered Stage 2 when they either reached an 
age of 6 years, reached a body weight of 25 kg, or if they had received treatment with ATV oral 
powder for 48 weeks in Stage 1. Intensive PK assessments and trough PK samples were collected 
during Stage 1 only. 
Intensive PK sampling was conducted at Week 2 in all subjects with samples collected up to 24 hours 
post-dose. There were 20, 18, and 15 subjects with evaluable ATV PK data in the 5 to < 10 kg, 10 to < 
15 kg, and 15 to < 25 kg weight bands, respectively.

Geometric mean (CV) ATV Cmax, AUC(TAU), and Cmin in HIV-infected adult patients (N=10) treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg QD 
are 4422 (58) ng/mL, 46073 (66) ng.h/mL, 636 (97) ng/mL, respectively.

Following administration of ATV oral powder with RTV oral solution, ATV was rapidly absorbed, with 
median time of maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) across the groups ranging from 1.5 to 2 hours. 
Geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 1 dosing interval [AUCtau], Cmax, 
and plasma concentration 24 hours post-dose (Cmin) increased with increasing dose. Apparent oral 
clearance (CLT/F) of ATV was relatively similar between the 3 treatment groups, while ATV apparent 
oral clearance adjusted for body weight (CLT/F/kg) was highest in the lowest weight band (5 to < 10 
kg) and decreased as the weight bands increased.  
The variability in the ATV PK parameters from the lowest 2 weight bands was relatively high, with the 
10 to < 15 kg weight band demonstrating the highest variability, while variability was considerably 
lower in the highest weight band (15 to < 25 kg). The variability in ATV Cmin was relatively large for all 
weight bands, with the greatest variability observed within the 10 to < 15 kg weight band. 
An additional analysis was conducted for a subset of subjects in the 5 to < 10 kg weight band aged 3 
to < 6 months in order to explore age-related differences in ATV systemic exposures in very young 
subjects. 
Table 11: Summary statistics of ATV PK parameters in subjects aged 3 to less than 
6 months in Study AI424397 
In this subset (all subjects were in the 5 to < 10 kg weight band treated with ATV/RTV 150/80 mg 
QD), geometric mean values for ATV Cmax and AUCtau appeared to be slightly lower than those ATV 
systemic exposures of the broader treatment group (Table 10), while the geometric mean ATV Cmin 
value was similar to the geometric mean observed in the broader treatment group. Geometric mean 
ATV CLT/F and CLT/F/kg for this subset of subjects was higher than that observed for the broader 
treatment group; however, the range of ATV CLT/F and CLT/F/kg values observed in this subset was 
largely similar to that observed for the broader treatment group. Overall, the ATV systemic exposures 
for these 9 subjects were distributed within the range observed for the rest of the subjects in 
Treatment A. 
Overall, geometric mean ATV C max, AUCtau, and Cmin at the doses administered in each weight band 
increased with increasing ATV dose; however, individual ATV systemic exposure data for the 3 weight 
bands demonstrated considerable overlap. 
AI424451 (PRINCE II): 
Study AI424451 (PRINCE II) is an ongoing, prospective, single arm, open-label, international, 
multicentre study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK of ATV oral powder boosted with RTV with an 
optimized NRTI background therapy in HIV-infected paediatric subjects 3 months to < 11 years of age. 
A secondary objective of the study is to describe the PK profile of ATV oral powder with RTV only for 
subjects in an age/weight group or receiving a dose that did not have intensive PK assessed in Study 
AI424397.

Study AI424451 consists of 2 stages. In Stage 1, all subjects are administered ATV oral powder (with 
RTV) at doses according to body weight. Subjects enter Stage 2 when they either have received 48 
weeks of ATV oral powder treatment or reach a body weight of 35 kg. Intensive PK assessments and 
trough PK samples are collected during Stage 1 only.  
Intensive PK sampling was conducted at Week 2 only for subjects in an age/weight group as follows: 
•  Subjects who entered the study weighing 25 to < 35 kg.  
•  Subjects who became 6 years of age during Stage 1 of the study and received an increase in the 
ATV dose and had intensive PK sampling approximately 2 weeks after initiation of the new dose.  
•  Subjects who became 6 years of age during Stage 1, but did not increase their dose of ATV, and 
intensive PK sampling was conducted at a regularly scheduled Stage 1 visit.  
•  Subjects enrolled in the new 5 to < 10 kg weight band receiving ATV 200 mg with RTV 80 mg.  
Ten subjects in the 5 to < 10 kg weight band treated with ATV/RTV 200/80 mg had evaluable intensive 
PK. Twenty-five subjects with evaluable intensive PK data in Study AI424451 were between the ages 
of 6 and 11 years; 17 were in the 15 to < 25 kg weight band and treated with ATV/RTV 250/80 mg 
QD, and 8 were in the 25 to < 35 kg weight band and treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg QD. 
Intensive PK collection stopped for subjects who were between the ages of 6 and 11 years in Stage 1 
and treated with ATV/RTV 250/80 mg QD during the study, because a sufficient number of samples 
had already been collected to draw meaningful conclusions.

AI424451 
Geometric mean (CV) ATV Cmax, AUC(TAU), and Cmin in HIV-infected adult patients (N=10) treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg QD

Following administration of ATV oral powder with RTV, ATV was rapidly absorbed, with median Tmax 
across the 3 weight bands ranging from 1.6 to 3.4 hours, with the lowest weight band (5 to < 10 kg) 
exhibiting the most rapid absorption and the highest weight band (25 to < 35 kg) exhibiting the least

rapid absorption. While ATV Cmax in the 15 to < 25 kg weight band treated with ATV/RTV 250/80 mg 
seemed slightly higher than the other 2 weight bands, the geometric mean Cmax was comparable 
between the 5 to < 10 kg weight band treated with ATV/RTV 200/80 mg and the 25 to < 35 kg weight 
band treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg. Geometric mean ATV AUCtau was lowest in the 5 to < 10 kg 
weight band treated with ATV/RTV 200/80 mg while the highest geometric mean AUCtau was observed 
in the 15 to < 25 kg weight band, also treated with ATV/RTV 200/80 mg. The lowest geometric mean 
ATV Cmin was observed in the 25 to < 35 kg weight band treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg, while the 
highest geometric mean ATV Cmin was observed in the 15 to < 25 kg weight band treated with 
ATV/RTV 200/80 mg. Variability was high (%CVs of 64% to 127%); however, geometric mean ATV 
CLT/F was largely consistent between the 3 weight bands. When adjusted for body weight, geometric 
mean ATV CLT/F/kg was highest in the lowest weight band (5 to < 10 kg weight band treated with 
ATV/RTV 200/80 mg) and was comparable between the 15 to < 25 kg weight band treated with 
ATV/RTV 200/80 mg and 25 to < 35 kg weight band treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg. 
2.4.3.1.  Across-studies analysis 
Dose selection  
The ATV dosing regimens (when given with RTV) for the clinical studies were selected using a one 
compartment POPPK modelling and simulation approach, with covariates such as body weight on 
clearance and relative bioavailability of different formulations included in the model. The model was 
used to select ATV/RTV dosing regimens that were predicted to provide ATV systemic exposures in 
paediatric patients similar to those observed in the adult population.  
Doses proposed 
The following table summarises the proposed doses for the paediatric weight cohorts and the resulting

Table 14: Summary statistics of ATV oral powder PK Parameters for Studies 
AI424397 and AI424451 combined 
Subjects in the 5 to <10 kg weight band in Study AI424451 treated with ATV/RTV 200/80 mg 
demonstrated higher geometric mean ATV systemic exposures than those treated with ATV/RTV 
150/80 mg in Study AI424397. In particular, the higher dose provided an ATV Cmin that more closely 
resembles ATV Cmin in HIV-infected adults.  
Dose justification for the 10- <15 kg weight band 
Intensive PK sampling in 4397 (200/80 mg): systemic ATV exposures in this weight band were 
reported to be comparable to adults treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg. Mean ATV Cmin is similar to 
that observed in adults treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg (686 ng/mL versus 636 ng/mL). One of 18 
subjects (6%) in the 10 to < 15 kg weight band (ATV/RTV 200/80 mg) had an ATV Cmax that 
exceeded the 90th percentile of the prediction interval in adult patients. 
Dose justification for the 15- <25 kg weight band 
The PK of ATV in subjects weighing 15 to < 25 kg treated with ATV/RTV 250/80 mg QD were assessed 
in both Studies AI424397 and AI424451; subjects in this weight band in Study AI424397 were < 6 
years of age (range: 2.8 to 5.4 years), while subjects in this weight band in Study AI424451 were 
approximately 6 years of age and older (range: 5.9 to 9.6 years). 
Geometric mean ATV Cmax and AUC(TAU) in this group treated with ATV/RTV 250/80 mg in Study 
AI424451 were somewhat lower than the same weight band in Study AI424397 (same dose), where 
subjects were older; however, geometric mean ATV Cmin was very similar between the 2 groups, and 
when PK data for this weight band between the 2 studies were combined, the geometric mean ATV 
Cmax, AUC(TAU), and Cmin were largely consistent with those observed in adults treated with ATV/RTV 
300/100 mg QD. 
Dose justification for the 25- <35 kg weight band 
In these subjects, ATV Cmax and AUC(TAU) were similar to adults treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg. 
Geometric mean ATV Cmin in these subjects was lower compared to adult subjects (468 ng/mL relative 
to 636 ng/mL, respectively); however, variability was high at over 100%.

While Study AI424451 had an upper body weight limit of 35 kg, the proposed dose of ATV powder for 
subjects weighing more than 35 kg who cannot swallow ATV capsule is 300 mg (with 100 mg of RTV), 
the same dose as for subjects weighing 25 to < 35 kg. The currently recommended capsule dose of 
ATV in paediatric subjects weighing 40 kg or more is 300 mg as well, and given the similar 
bioavailability demonstrated in Study AI424025 between the oral powder and capsule, a dose of 300 
mg oral powder is expected to provide exposures in paediatric subjects between 35 and 40 kg that are 
similar to adults treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg. 
Exposure comparison to adults 
As part of the D120 LOQ, a major objection was raised since the dose selection was considered as 
inadequately substantiated by the PPK model. The applicant was asked to enrich and update the PPK 
model to ensure that the effects of weight and age were adequately captured in the model.  
A particular concern was raised for the lowest weight band (5-10 kg), with a small number of children 
to substantiate the dose (n=10) and a poor response rate observed (<20% of patients with HIV RNA 
<50 copies/ml at week 24 in PRINCE II). 
As part of the applicant’s responses to the D120 LOQ, the atazanavir (ATV) population pharmacokinetic 
(PPK) dataset was updated to include observed data from Studies AI424397 and AI424451 and the 
original one-compartment model, first-order absorption and elimination re-evaluated for goodness of 
fit with the updated dataset. The results of that investigation revealed some misspecification in the 
original model. The population PK dataset was enriched with the 89 subjects of studies PRINCE 1 
(AI424137) and PRINCE 2 (AI424397). The PPK model was then revised. In the revised PPK model the 
data were best described by a two-compartment model. As stated by the applicant, the two-
compartment model incorporated the key covariate elements from the one-compartment model. 
Specifically, the effect of gender and body weight on ATV CL/F and body weight on central volume 
(V2/F) were retained. The following additional covariate effects were subsequently explored and 
included in the final model: age (described with a maturation function) and age-dependent ritonavir 
(RTV) effects on ATV CL/F, RTV coadministration effects on relative bioavailability of ATV, and ATV 
formulation-dependent absorption lag-times.  
As discussed by the applicant, the original one-compartment C0-delinked PPK model predicted an 
approximate 35% reduction in ATV bioavailability from the powder formulation relative to capsule; 
however, it was postulated this finding was confounded with age because the powder formulation was 
predominantly used by younger patients who have higher ATV clearance (when adjusted for body 
weight). In the revised PPK assessment, in which the disposition of ATV is described by a 2-
compartment model incorporating gender, body weight, a maturation function, and RTV 
coadministration as a categorical covariate with a proportional shift in ATV CL/F based on 3 age groups 
(< 6 months, 6 months to < 1 year, ≥1 year), formulation had no significant impact on either the 
absorption rate constant or ATV bioavailability, suggesting similar exposures are expected from the 
powder and capsule. 
The applicant underlines that this is in line with the small BE study in adults (see Day 80 reports, a 
small (n=7) comparative bioavailability study (AI424025), between the capsule and the powder (10% 
aspartame) not powered to demonstrate BE but showing similar AUC and trend for lower Cmax with 
the oral powder).  
On the basis of this now assumed comparable bioavailability between the capsule and the oral powder 
formulation, the applicant is now reconsidering the capsule dosing regimen as detailed below for 
children below 25 kg, recommending to increase the dose from 150 mg to 200 mg in children from 15

to 20 kg and from 200 mg to 300 mg for children from 20 kg (while this adult dose was previously 
recommended from 40 kg). However, this puts more weight in PK simulation as compared to the 
cumulative clinical experience gained in children for years with the currently recommended schedule 
regimen.

Using the revised PPK model, tabulated exposures at several dose levels in the relevant age groups are 
presented. A visual comparison of observed paediatric data and observed adult data was provided, and 
predicted Cmin was evaluated against the similarity criteria applied for the paediatric line extension for 
the capsule formulation in 2009. Graphical comparison of predicted Cmax and AUC with adult data was 
not provided. Of note, the requested adult reference data was missing in the responses. It would be 
expected that the reference taken (mentioned target adult ATVC24 mean=631.88 ng/ml) is adequately 
substantiated by data derived from the optimal ritonavir boosted regimen. 
Based on these revised PK data submitted, the same dose of Reyataz powder (200/80 mg) is proposed 
for the 10-15 kg weight group, where the predefined PK criteria are met and the dose is considered 
acceptable for this weight band. In the 15-20 kg weight band, the 200 mg dose meets the predefined 
criteria while the 250 mg dose does meet C24 criteria, but exceeds AUC and Cmax criteria by a 
relatively small margin. The 250 mg dose is nevertheless proposed for the powder as it was the dose 
evaluated in both clinical studies, which seems reasonable. A dose of 200 mg is proposed for the 
capsule formulation and based on PK data does indeed seem preferable to the presently approved 150 
mg dose, which does not meet the similarity criteria. A dose of 200 mg in this weight band is not 
expected to be associated with higher Cmax and AUC than observed in the adult population or in in 
paediatric population (< 15 kg weight bands).

However, following the revised PPK model, it appeared that some concerns could be resolved for 
several weight bands: 
- In the 5-10 kg weight band, the revised model predictions result in lower mean C24 and Cmax 
compared to the earlier model. None of the predicted doses met acceptance criteria, however the 200 
mg dose matches criteria more closely and seems more appropriate than the 150 mg dose, particularly 
when taking the observed data into account as well. Predicted ATV C24 misses the similarity criteria by 
a minor margin, which is not considered clinically relevant, however Cmax is higher than considered 
acceptable. Of note, predicted Cmax was higher and C24 lower than observed values. It is of concern 
that the modelled and observed data do not match well in this age group, where clinical data have also 
proven to be very difficult to interpret. It would appear that further development of the model is 
required to support dosing in this age group. The applicant was required to investigate further 
development of the PPK model to improve the fit in this age group. A modified, or additional, 
maturation function may be required for the very young, alternatively the effect of ritonavir in these 
individuals may need modification in the model. Based on the available data as presented, the dose of 
200/80 mg may be acceptable.  
- In the 20-25 kg weight band, a dose of 250 mg/80 mg is proposed for the powder formulation and 
this does appear appropriate as it is the dose evaluated in the clinical studies and the PK criteria are 
met. For the capsule formulation, a dose of 300 mg/100 mg is proposed which requires further 
justification. Simulated data suggest that the presently approved 200 mg dose matches the predefined 
criteria and in addition this dose has been used in clinical practice for some time. The proposed dose of 
300 mg does not meet the predefined criteria and there is no supporting clinical data. Predicted 
exposure parameters are higher than in the adult population (there are no observed data). The 
applicant should clarify if post-marketing clinical data are available suggesting that the presently 
approved dose of 200 mg for the capsule formulation may be suboptimal in terms of efficacy and 
provide any other available data in support of the new dose proposal in this group. With the data 
available at present, a dose of 200mg (which is anyway given with a slightly higher dose of RTV of 
100mg compared to the 80mg administered when the powder formulation is used) may be more 
appropriate in this weight group. 
- In the 25-40 kg weight band, a dose of 300 mg is now proposed for both the capsule and the powder 
formulation. This does imply a 50% increase of the approved dose (for the capsule formulation), and 
there is extremely little clinical experience and hence safety data at this dose level. The same 
considerations with regard to observed efficacy with the approved dose, and evaluation of safety 
implications of the proposed higher dose outlined for the 20-25kg weight band apply here. If the dose 
for the capsule formulation is to be changed based on PK modelling only, it is of particular relevance 
that the model can be shown to be robust. Hence, observed and predicted PK parameters in these 
weight groups should be compared and model performance reported. Boxplots of observed and 
predicted ATV C24, Cmax and AUC relative to adult values should be presented for comparison for the 
200, 250 and 300 mg dose. Without sufficient supportive data, the proposed increase of the dose in 
these weight bands does not appear justified at present. 
The PPK model submitted was further revised to include a modified maturation function for the 
characterization of the age-related impact of RTV coadministration on ATV apparent oral clearance 
(CLT/F), as well as a new maturation function describing the impact of age on ATV bioavailability, 
resulting in an improvement in the characterization of the time-course of ATV concentrations in 
paediatric subjects. 
The comparison of simulated ATV exposures with adult reference values is below:

The proposed doses of Reyataz were as follows: 
Based on this newly revised PPK model, the ATV oral powder doses remained unchanged: 
- In the 5-10 kg and 10-15 kg weight bands, the revisions made to the PPK model result in better 
agreement between predicted and observed data in this weight band, and substantiate the dose of ATV 
oral powder 200 mg + RTV 80 mg. This dose meets the pre-defined target exposure acceptance 
criteria for ATV C24 (C24 > 75% of adult C24 [631.88 ng/ml], and PER C24 > 75%). 
- In the 15-20 kg and 20-25 kg weight bands, the dose of ATV powder 250 mg + RTV 80 mg meets 
the target acceptance criteria for ATV C24. The simulated Cmax in these weight groups are higher than 
those observed in adults (59% and 45% respectively), which may due to the under-estimation of the 
simulated adult Cmax. Indeed, the observed geometric mean ATV Cmax in subjects of these weight 
groups are respectively only 22% and 13% higher than the observed geometric mean ATV Cmax in 
adults. In addition, there is no trend between ATV exposure and severity of adverse events of interest. 
- In the 25-35 kg and 35-40 kg weight bands, the dose of ATV powder 300 mg + RTV 100 mg meets 
the target acceptance criteria for ATV C24 and Cmax. A dose of 250 mg would also be selected, but 
300 mg was chosen to be in accordance with the new proposed capsules doses in these weight bands. 
In addition, this dose was demonstrated to be safe in Study AI424451.

However, the ATV capsule doses were further revised: 
- In the 15-20 kg weight band, the currently approved capsule dose of ATV (150 mg) was updated to 
200 mg, consistently with the previous PPK model submitted for the D120 LOQ. Indeed, the newly 
revised PPK model still demonstrates that the 150 mg dose does not meet target acceptance criteria 
with regard to ATV C24 (the geometric mean ratio for simulated ATV C24 between pediatric and adult 
subjects is 0.67, below the minimum threshold of 0.75). Although there have been no reports of 
suboptimal or reduced efficacy with post-marketing use of this dose in this weight band, it is possible 
that a small percentage of patients could have suboptimal exposures to ATV using a 150 mg dose with 
RTV. A higher capsule dose of 200 mg in the 15 to <20 kg weight band meets target acceptance 
criteria for all three ATV PK parameters, including Cmax. No trend between ATV exposure and severity 
of adverse events of interest is expected based on this model. The dose of ATV capsule 200 mg is 
more closely resembles those of ATV powder, avoiding discrepancy in case of switch from powder to 
capsule formulation. 
- In the 20-25 kg weight band, the dose of ATV capsule at 300 mg proposed in the responses to the 
D120 LOQ is decreased at 200 mg (which is the current ATV capsule dose in this weight group). 
Indeed, a 300 mg dose does not meet target exposure acceptance criteria, particularly with regard to 
ATV Cmax, with simulated values that exceed the maximum acceptable threshold, and there is no 
available clinical data with this dose in this weight band. 
- In the 25-35 kg and 35-40 kg weight bands, the updated dose of ATV capsule at 300 mg is 
maintained. The newly revised PPK model demonstrates that ATV doses of 250 mg and 300 mg, when 
given with RTV, meet the target exposure acceptance criteria in these pediatric subjects, with one 
minor exception: in the 25-35 kg weight band, the geometric mean ratio of simulated ATV AUC in 
pediatric subjects to adults at a 300 mg dose is 1.36, slightly above the maximum threshold of 1.25; 
however the percentage of subjects with simulated ATV AUC between the 10th and 90th percentile of 
adult AUC is 77% and meets acceptance criteria. With the dose of 300 mg, no change in ATV posology 
will be required in case of switch from powder to capsule formulation, with a safety profile expected to 
be similar to that in adults.  
Finally the MAH proposed an intermediate position for the dosing recommendation, i.e. for the 35-40 
kg weight band to recommend a 300/100 mg for both the oral powder and the capsule formulations 
instead of a 250/80 mg for the oral powder and 200/100 for the capsule formulation. Indeed, the 
applicant considers that based on the updated PPK model, the 200/100 mg might be borderline for the 
capsule formulation.

2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
A PK/PD analysis was performed taking into account the subjects from PRINCE I and II studies 
(patients from 3 months to 11 years of age weighing 5 kg to <35 kg treated with RTV-boosted ATV 
powder). For more details on PRINCE studies, refer to efficacy section. 
Overall, 146 subjects are included in this PK/PD analysis: 72 (49%) were male and 74 (51%) were 
female. Forty subjects (27%) were White, 83 subjects (57%) were Black/African American, 1 subject 
was Asian, and 22 subjects (15%) were classified as “Other”. 
The following PK parameters were measured for ATV: 
•  Composite Ctrough (= within subject geometric mean of all available Ctroughs),  
•  Composite  IQ  (=  steady-state  ATV  Ctrough/protein  binding-adjusted  EC90  for  ATV  against  HIV  at 
baseline for each subject). 
Table 15: Summary Statistics for ATV Composite IQ and Baseline EC 90 
Following multiple daily dosing of ATV oral powder with RTV at doses of ATV that provide systemic 
exposures similar to adults treated with the recommended ATV/RTV 300/100 mg QD, ATV composite 
Ctrough was lowest in the 5 to < 10 kg weight band treated with ATV/RTV 150/80 mg. The lower 
composite Ctrough is consistent with a lower dose of ATV and is consistent with the intensive PK data 
reported in Study AI424397 that prompted an amendment to Study AI424451 to assess a higher dose 
of ATV (200 mg) in this weight band to determine whether higher ATV systemic exposures could be 
achieved. 
When ATV composite Ctrough was distributed into 4 quartiles (ATV quartile composite Ctrough, ATV QCC), 
this analysis demonstrated that ATV composite Ctrough was evenly distributed between the 4 quartiles in 
each weight band, with the exception of the 5 to < 10 kg weight band treated with ATV/RTV 150/80 
mg, where 40% of subjects had an ATV composite Ctrough in the lowest quartile and the 25 to < 35 kg 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 36/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weight band, where 63% of subjects had a composite ATV Ctrough in the highest quartile; however, the 
sample size was small in this weight band, and all 4 quartiles were still represented in this weight 
band.  
Geometric mean (%CV) composite ATV Ctrough in adult patients treated with ATV/RTV 300/100 mg QD 
from Study AI424089 was 670 (63) ng/mL. The geometric mean (%CV) composite Ctrough for all 
paediatric subjects combined in this analysis was 448 (77) ng/mL, approximately 33% lower than that 
observed in adult patients. However, geometric mean composite ATV Ctrough in paediatric patients still 
exceeds the population protein-binding adjusted 90% effective concentration (EC90) for wild type virus 
(14 ng/mL) and the protein-binding adjusted EC90s reported in paediatric subjects included in this 
assessment (44.3 ng/mL). 
Inhibitory quotient (IQ) links the efficacy-driven PK parameter with the sensitivity of the patient 
isolates of HIV. The composite IQ for all paediatric subjects combined was 10.1. This is markedly lower 
than the geometric mean composite IQ of 42 reported in HIV-infected adults treated with ATV/RTV 
300/100 mg in Study AI424089. This marked difference in IQ is likely driven by the differences in 
baseline protein-binding adjusted EC90 between the 2 populations as well as to a lesser extent by the 
difference in composite ATV Ctrough in the 2 populations (670 ng/mL in adults versus 448 ng/mL in 
paediatric subjects). Paediatric patients had a geometric mean baseline protein-binding adjusted EC90 
of 44.3 ng/mL, compared to 13 ng/mL in adult patients, suggesting that paediatric patients, in general, 
may have less susceptible virus than adults. However, Studies AI424397 and AI424451 enrolled both 
treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, while Study AI424089 only enrolled treatment-
naive adults. It is possible that prior treatment history could impact individual viral susceptibility to 
ATV. Nevertheless, with the exception of the 5 to < 10 kg weight band treated with ATV/RTV 150/80 
mg, the majority of paediatric subjects had a composite IQ between 10 and 100, suggesting that ATV 
powder doses administered in these paediatric trials are capable of achieving and maintaining 
suppressive ATV concentration margins over susceptible viruses. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
From previous studies mainly in the adult population the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir is known to 
exhibit a non-linear disposition with greater than dose-proportional increases in AUC and Cmax. 
Atazanavir is principally metabolised by CYP3A4 isozyme to oxygenated metabolites. Metabolites are 
then excreted in the bile as either free or glucuronidated metabolites, renal excretion of unchanged 
drug is low. The mean elimination half-life of ATV subjects was approximately 7 hours at steady state. 
Steady-state is achieved between Days 4 and 8, with an accumulation of approximately 2.3-fold. ATV 
should be taken with food. No difference in PK between treatment naïve and experienced subjects had 
been identified in the POPPK model, neither were race or gender identified as relevant for exposure. 
Paediatric PK data presented stem from the intense PK sampling performed during stage 1 of the study 
at around week 2. All data were generated with the ATV powder formulation containing 10% 
aspartame. The proposed formulation of ATV powder containing 4.2% aspartame was used in stage 2 
of the study in those subjects who remained on the powder formulation after stage 1. Intense PK data 
were not collected during stage 2.  Due to the minor change in formulation, CHMP had advised that a 
study demonstrating bioequivalence between the two ATV powder formulations is not required. 
In the present studies, the PK of atazanavir was evaluated after two weeks of treatment, under 
presumed steady state conditions. Intensive PK data were available from 88 subjects from 5 weight 
cohorts, with dosing was based on body weight. The variability in the PK observed PK data is high. As 
had been previously described in the paediatric population, absorption rate seemed be higher in 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 37/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
younger children and CLT/F/kg seems to be inversely related to age. As a result, Cmax tends to be 
higher and Cmin tends to be lower in children than in adults, so that greater peak/trough ratios are 
observed. This effect is more pronounced in the absence of ritonavir.  
AUC and Cmin (the latter being the most relevant PK parameter linked to PD) across the studies 
showed that the posology of ATV/RTV 200/80 mg (powder) is more appropriate than the ATV/RTV 
150/80 mg (powder) for the 5-<10 kg weight range. Additionally, PK/PD analysis show a lower rate of 
virologic success in the lowest ATV QCC, where a large proportion of subjects come from the 5-<10 kg 
(ATV 150 mg) group, suggesting a suboptimal virologic response of ATV 150 mg. 
However, despite an increased dose of ATV from 150 mg to 200 mg, it should be highlighted that PK 
parameters associated to efficacy (AUC and Cmin) are lower in the group 5-<10 kg than those of the 
other weight groups and in adults. 
Initially, a major objection was raised since the dose selection was considered as inadequately 
substantiated by the PPK model. The applicant was asked to enrich and update the PPK model to 
notably ensure that the effects of weight and age were adequately captured in the model.  
A particular concern was raised for the lowest weight band (5-10 kg), with a small number of children 
to substantiate the dose (n=10) and a poor response rate observed (<20% of patients with HIV RNA 
<50 copies/ml at week 24 in PRINCE II). 
As part of the applicant’s responses to the D120 LOQ, the atazanavir (ATV) population pharmacokinetic 
(PPK) dataset was updated to include observed data from Studies AI424397 and AI424451 and the 
original one-compartment model, first-order absorption and elimination re-evaluated for goodness of 
fit with the updated dataset. The results of that investigation revealed some misspecification in the 
original model. The population PK dataset was enriched with the 89 subjects of studies PRINCE 1 
(AI424137) and PRINCE 2 (AI424397). The PPK model was then revised. In the revised PPK model the 
data were best described by a two-compartment model. As stated by the applicant, the two-
compartment model incorporated the key covariate elements from the one-compartment model. 
Specifically, the effect of gender and body weight on ATV CL/F and body weight on central volume 
(V2/F) were retained. The following additional covariate effects were subsequently explored and 
included in the final model: age (described with a maturation function) and age-dependent ritonavir 
(RTV) effects on ATV CL/F, RTV coadministration effects on relative bioavailability of ATV, and ATV 
formulation-dependent absorption lag-times.  
As discussed by the applicant, the original one-compartment C0-delinked PPK model predicted an 
approximate 35% reduction in ATV bioavailability from the powder formulation relative to capsule; 
however, it was postulated this finding was confounded with age because the powder formulation was 
predominantly used by younger patients who have higher ATV clearance (when adjusted for body 
weight). In the revised PPK assessment, formulation had no significant impact on either the absorption 
rate constant or ATV bioavailability, suggesting similar exposures are expected from the powder and 
capsule. 
On the basis of this now assumed comparable bioavailability between the capsule and the oral powder 
formulation, the applicant is now reconsidering the capsule dosing regimen for children below 25 kg, 
recommending to increase the dose from 150 mg to 200 mg in children from 15 to 20 kg and from 200 
mg to 300 mg for children from 20 kg (while this adult dose was previously recommended from 40 
kg).  
Overall, it is of concern that the modelled and observed data do not match well in the 5-10 kg group, 
where clinical data have also proven to be very difficult to interpret. It would appear that further 
Assessment report

development of the model is required to support dosing in this age group.  The applicant should 
investigate further development of the POPPK model to improve the fit in this age group.  A modified, 
or additional, maturation function may be required for the very young, alternatively the effect of 
ritonavir in these individuals may need modification in the model. 
Moreover, the applicant should clarify if post-marketing clinical data are available suggesting that the 
presently approved dose of 200 mg for the capsule formulation may be suboptimal in terms of efficacy 
and provide any other available data in support of the new dose proposal in this group. The potential 
safety implications for such an increased dose will also have to be thoroughly evaluated. Given the 
increased exposures associated with this dose, particular concerns would be cardiac and hepatic effects 
as well as DDI. It is acknowledged that part of the rational for proposing the 300 mg dose is to prevent 
that subjects switching from powder to capsule should receive a lower dose, which seems reasonable. 
However, this could be achieved by discouraging switching for subjects < 25 kg (instead of <20kg) to 
avoid this scenario. 
Finally, the choice of the ritonavir dose, which was the same for all subjects < 25kg, was justified. 
Data suggest that effect of RTV on ATV bioavailability is not explained by an effect on CYP3A4 as it is 
consistent across the age/ weight range. The company should clarify if an effect of RTV on ATV 
bioavailability not resulting from CYP3A4 inhibition, has been described before for ATV or for other PIs. 
The MAH should discuss the potential mechanisms involved and present any corroborating data 
available. 
The PPK model was updated to include a modified maturation function for the characterization of the 
age-related impact of RTV co-administration on ATV apparent oral clearance (CLT/F), as well as a new 
maturation function describing the impact of age on ATV bioavailability, resulting in an improvement in 
the characterization of the time-course of ATV concentrations in paediatric subjects. This newly revised 
PPK model, like the Day 120 model, predicts that a range of doses will provide target ATV exposures, 
including the currently recommended capsule doses in most weight bands for children 6 years of age 
and older. This new model does appear more robust in particular for the 5-10 kg weight band, 
although some underprediction of C24 is still observed. 
Regarding the weight bands 5 to 25 kg, the exposure/response evaluations did not give rise to safety 
concerns as far as can be judged based on the model-predicted exposures at the time of any AE. The 
MAH has decreased the dose of capsule formulation for subjects weighing 20-25 kg from 300 mg to 
200 mg. This dose is the same as the already approved dose and hence supported by both clinical data 
and revised PPK model. 
The applicant proposed the higher dose of ATV/rtv 300/100mg for the weight bands 25 to 40 kg. Yet 
the similarity between observed PK parameters in this weight bracket with the 300mg dose to the PK 
parameters in adults is based on a very small group of subjects. Simulated data favour the dose of 
250mg. It is acknowledged that maintaining viral suppression is of the highest relevance in the target 
population, but it seems somewhat difficult to justify changing the dose of the approved capsule 
formulation from 200 mg to 300mg, in particular when considering that the 200mg dose has also been 
used in clinical trials with the capsule formulation and meets the target criteria for similarity, while the 
300 mg dose does not. In order to both minimize the gap when switching from the powder to the 
capsule formulation in children from 25 kg to < 35 kg and to avoid revising the capsule formulation 
given the experience gained, the CHMP recommended approving a dose of 250mg/80 mg for the 
powder formulation and to keep the dose for the capsule formulation unchanged at 200/100mg. It is 
acknowledged that the dose of 250 mg has not been evaluated in clinical trials in the 25 to < 35 kg 
weight band, but doses of 200mg and 300mg have been used in clinical trials in this population, even 
though the cohorts were very small as described above.

2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PPK model has been significantly improved from the original application, with updated PK data 
from the PRINCE studies as well as through the inclusion of additional covariates for notably covering 
modified maturation function for the characterization of the age-related impact of RTV co-
administration on ATV apparent oral clearance (CLT/F), as well as a new maturation function describing 
the impact of age on ATV bioavailability. This overall result in a good fit to data in all age groups. 
In conclusion, the final dosing recommendation for the oral powder and capsule formulation took into 
account the PPKPOP, the need to minimize the gap between oral and capsule formulation as well as the 
need to minimize the deviation from the original capsule dosing recommendation. It is acknowledged 
that these dosing recommendations mainly rely on PPKPOP and clinical experience.

2.5.1.  Main studies 
The pivotal studies for this line and indication extension of Reyataz are AI424397 (PRINCE I) and 
AI424451 (PRINCE II).  
The design of Study AI424451, apart from the inclusion of a higher weight band (i.e., 25 - < 35 kg 
dosed with 300 mg of ATV/80 mg RTV), differed from Study AI424397 in that the primary safety 
endpoint was revised to be evaluated once the last subject enrolled had reached a minimum of 24 
weeks duration in Stage 1 (it was originally 48 weeks). As such, not all subjects have reached 48 
weeks in this study. Another significant difference was the addition of a cohort of subjects weighing 5 - 
< 10 kg dosed with 200 mg of ATV powder formulation boosted with 80 mg RTV. This group was added 
to assess whether exposures could be enhanced above those observed at a dose of 150 mg ATV/80 mg 
RTV given to subjects in this weight band in Study AI424397.

Sample size  
Statistical 
methods 
Sample  size  was  not  based  on  power  calculations.  Approximately  50  subjects  distributed  among 
the 3 weight bands were planned for this study. A minimum number of treated subjects were to 
have been assigned per weight band: 
• 6 subjects between 5 - < 10 kg 
• 10 subjects between 10 - < 15 kg 
• 10 subjects between 15 - < 25 kg. 
A target sample size of 50 treated subjects can detect with 80% probability, a safety event that 
occurs at a per subject incident rate of 3.2%, and can produce an exact binomial 95% CI within ± 
14% for a response rate of 50%. 
No statistical comparisons between weight bands were conducted. 
Efficacy:  All  efficacy  endpoints  were  secondary,  and  focused  on  the  ATV  powder  formulation. 
Values  after  the  start  of  ATV  capsule  were  excluded.  The  response  rates  through  Week  48  were 
assessed with the Snapshot algorithm. Response rates through Week 48 for Week 48 ATV powder 
cohort (treated subjects who did not switch to ATV capsule at or before analysis Week 48) used a 
modified intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Response rates through Week 48 for treated subjects used 
observed values. Response rates were presented with exact binomial 95% CI. 
Safety: Safety evaluations were based on data on ATV powder through Week 48. 
PK: The derived PK parameters, Cmax, Tmax, AUC(TAU), Cmin, CLT/F, and CLT/F/kg obtained at 
the Week 2 visit for ATV and RTV were summarized by baseline weight band. 
Patient disposition 
Eighty-two subjects were enrolled, and 56 subjects (68%) were treated. Among these subjects, 46 
subjects (82%) completed the Stage 1 treatment period. Nine subjects (16%) discontinued ATV 
powder before Week 48, and the most common reason for discontinuation of ATV powder was AE (5 
subjects).Two subjects were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy, and one each due to poor compliance 
and withdrawal of consent. 
Of the 45 subjects entering Stage 2, 41 (73%) were still on ATV powder at Week 48, and 4 subjects 
had to transition from powder to capsules during stage 1. At database lock date of 07-Oct-2014, 31 
subjects (55%) were still ongoing in Stage 2. Eleven subjects (20%) have discontinued in Stage 2, and 
the most common reasons for discontinuation were subject withdrew consent and lost to follow up (5% 
each). 
Conduct of the study 
This study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. 
Overall, 6 subjects (11%) had on-treatment protocol deviations (2 subjects in each of the 3 weight 
bands): 4 subjects continued in the study after a study drug interruption > 14 days, and 2 subjects 
received prohibited concomitant medication > 3 days. 
There were 7 amendments to the protocol. The main major changes were:  
- additional visits;  
- the addition of an IDMC;  
- the switch in background NRTIs in case of confirmed viral rebound between 400 and 10,000 c/ml 
associated with a genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to one or more NRTI without genotypic 
and/or phenotypic resistance to ATV or due to treatment-limiting NRTI toxicity;  
- the change of the whole treatment regimen, including ATV, in subjects with confirmed virologic 
failure or virologic rebound above 1000 copies/mL; 
- the modification of the definition of virologic failure in accordance with the updated 2011 DHHS 
paediatric guidelines and clarified the virologic failure criteria to discontinue a subject in the study.

Demographics 
At baseline, the overall median age was 29 months (range: 3 - 65 months). The majority of subjects 
were Black/African American (57%), and half of the subjects were male. The majority of subjects were 
recruited in Africa (68%). The majority of subjects were ARV naive (61%) and this was similar in all 
weight cohorts. The overall median HIV RNA was 5 log10 c/mL, and the majority of subjects had HIV 
RNA > 100,000 c/mL (57%). Overall median CD4 count was 1,004 cells/mm3, and median CD4 
percent was 24%.

The mean (median) change from baseline in HIV RNA was -2.90 (-3.25) log10 c/mL and -2.52 (-2.89) 
log10 c/mL in ARV-experienced and -naive subjects, respectively. 
CD4 cell count changes from baseline 
At Week 48, the overall mean (median) change from baseline in CD4 cell count was 397 (363) 
cells/mm3. In the 5-<10 kg, 10-<15 kg, and 15-<25 kg groups, the mean (median) change from 
baseline in CD4 cell count was 550 (491), 225 (274), and 374 (363) cells/mm3 respectively. 
The mean (median) change from baseline in CD4 cell count was 182 (213) cells/mm3 and 493 (520) 
cells/mm3 in ARV-experienced and -naive subjects, respectively. 
Virologic resistance 
By Week 48, a total amount of 14 subjects met the criteria for virologic failure. Nine of these subjects 
had paired genotypic data (data at baseline and on treatment) and 6 had paired phenotypic resistance 
testing data. Six subjects (43%) were ARV experienced and 8 subjects (57%) were ARV naive. 
None of the subjects acquired phenotypic resistance to ATV, ATV/RTV, or any NRTI or NNRTI. None of 
the subjects developed any major PI substitution to ATV or ATV/RTV. One ARV-naive subject in the 10-

<15 kg weight band developed M36M/I and 1 ARV-naive subject in the 5-<10 kg weight band 
developed H69K/R. One ARV-experienced subject in the 15-<25 kg weight band developed I72I/V 
substitution, and 1 ARV-naive subject in the 5-<10 kg weight band developed L19I/R. 
Palatability 
Palatability survey on ATV powder (10% aspartame) and RTV oral solution was performed at each visit. 
Throughout the study, the majority of subjects took their dose of ATV mixed with milk or water. The 
majority of subjects had no trouble completing their doses of ATV and RTV (91% and 87%, 
respectively).

Objectives 
A  Prospective  Single  Arm,  Open-label,  International,  Multicenter  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Safety, 
Efficacy  and  Pharmacokinetics  of  Atazanavir  (ATV)  Powder  Boosted  with  Ritonavir  (RTV)  with  an 
Optimized  NRTI  Background  Therapy,  in  HIV  Infected,  Antiretroviral,  Naive  and  Experienced 
Pediatric Subjects From 3 Months to Less Than 11 Years. 
- HIV-infected pediatric subjects ≥ 3 months to < 11 years of age.  
- Weight between 5 kg and 35 kg at Day 1. 
- ARV naive or experienced (without prior exposure to ATV). 
- Genotypic sensitivity to ATV and to NRTI backbone. 
ATV powder (10% aspartame then 4.2% aspartame) + RTV oral solution + 2 NRTIs (excluding TDF) 
The  primary  objective  was  to  describe  the  safety  of  ATV  powder  formulation  boosted  with  RTV 
liquid-based  highly  active  antiretroviral  therapy  (HAART)  regimens  in  pediatric  subjects  dosed 
through 24 weeks. 
Secondary objectives are: 
•  To  describe  efficacy  of  ATV  powder  formulation,  as  measured  by  proportion  of  subjects  with  a 
virologic response (HIV RNA levels < 50 copies/mL and < 400 copies/ml) at Week 24 and Week 48. 
•  To  describe  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of  ATV  powder  formulation  with  RTV  in  pediatric 
subjects in terms of ATV Cmax, Cmin and AUC.

Outcomes/ 
endpoints 
Efficacy: The proportions of subjects with HIV RNA < 50 c/mL and < 400 c/mL are being evaluated 
at each scheduled visit through Week 24 and Week 48, including the change from baseline in HIV 
RNA, CD4 cell count, and CD4 percentages. 
Safety: Safety assessments include vital signs, physical measurements, deaths, AEs including CDC 
Class C AIDS events, laboratory measurements and ECG results. 
Pharmacokinetics: Intensive PK assessments for ATV Cmax, Cmin, and AUC(TAU) were conducted 
in paediatric subjects weighing ≥ 25 to < 35 kg and/or who were ≥ 6 to < 11 years of age, and for 
subjects enrolling in the new ≥ 5 - < 10 kg cohort (200 mg ATV and 80 mg RTV). Trough plasma 
concentrations (Ctrough) of ATV and RTV were also determined for all subjects from Week 4 though a 
minimum of 24 weeks and up through 48 weeks in Stage 1. 
Other: Palatability of ATV 10% aspartame powder and RTV oral solution is being assessed through 
a  survey  from  Weeks  1  to  48.  After  protocol  Amendment  07  approval,  subjects  ongoing  on  ATV 
10%  aspartame powder  in Stage 2  who  switched  to  ATV 4.2%  aspartame powder  had palatability 
survey  and  a  5-point  facial  hedonic  scale  (only  for  subjects  who  were  ≥  3  years  old  in  Stage  2) 
assessments  at  time  from  switch  and  afterwards,  as  long  as  the  subjects  were  on  ATV  4.2%

aspartame powder or up to maximum of 1 year. 
A total of approximately 95 subjects was planned for this study in order to treat approximately 10-
15  subjects  in  the  new  5-<10  kg  (200  mg  ATV  and  80  mg  RTV)  cohort  and  have  a  minimum 
number  of  56  treated  subjects  with  48  weeks  of  follow  up  on  ATV  powder  based  on  an  expected 
drop-out rate of approximately 30%. 
A  minimum  number  of  subjects  with  at  least  24  weeks  of  follow  up was  planned  for  the  following 
weight bands: 
- Minimum 5 subjects (on 150 mg ATV powder and 80 mg RTV) between 5-<10 kg 
- Minimum 6 subjects (on 200 mg ATV powder and 80 mg RTV) between 5-<10 kg 
- Minimum 10 subjects between 10-<15 kg 
- Minimum 10 subjects between 15-<25 kg. 
A  target  sample  size  of  95  treated  subjects  can  detect  with  80%  probability,  a  safety  event  that 
occurs at a per subject incident rate of 1.7%, and can produce an exact binomial 95% CI within ± 
10.5% for a response rate of 50.5%. 
No statistical comparisons between weight bands were conducted. 
Efficacy:  All  efficacy  endpoints  were  secondary,  and  focused  on  the  ATV  powder  formulation. 
Values after the start of ATV capsule were excluded. The response rates through Week 24 and Week 
48 were assessed with the Snapshot algorithm. Response rates through Week 24 for Week 24 ATV 
powder cohort (treated subjects who did not switch to ATV capsule at or before analysis Week 24) 
and  through  Week  48  for  Week  48  ATV  powder  cohort  used  a  modified  intent-to-treat  (ITT) 
analysis.  Response  rates  through  Week  48  for  treated  subjects  used  observed  values.  Response 
rates were presented with exact binomial 95% CI. 
Safety: Safety evaluations were based on data on ATV powder through Week 48. 
PK:  The  derived  PK  parameters,  Cmax,  Tmax,  AUC(TAU),  Cmin,  CLT/F,  and  CLT/F/kg  obtained  at  the 
Week 2 visit for ATV and RTV were summarized by baseline weight band.

Results  
Participant flow and numbers analysed 
Ninety-nine subjects were treated, and 67 subjects (68%) completed the Stage 1 treatment period. 
Thirty-two subjects (32%) did not complete Stage 1, and the most common reasons for 
discontinuation were a lack of efficacy (11%), AEs (7%), and withdrew consent (4%).

Four subjects (4%) had relevant on-treatment protocol deviations: 2 subjects used a prohibited 
medication for > 3 days (rifampicin and fluticasone) and 2 subjects continued in the study after study 
drug interruptions > 14 days. 
There were 8 amendments to the protocol. The main major changes were:  
- the increase of inclusion upper age limit from 7.5 years to < 11 years of age because a weight of 25 
to < 35 kg corresponds more to a HIV-infected paediatric child of approximately 10 years old; 
- the addition of a new 5-<10 kg cohort with a higher ATV dose (200 mg ATV and 80 mg RTV) to 
assess if exposures can potentially be enhanced with a higher ATV dose; 
- the switch of all subjects in Stage 2 who were still on the 10% aspartame ATV oral powder 
formulation to the new 4.2% aspartame ATV oral powder formulation and collected 
palatability/acceptability data at the time of switch and after the switch for a maximum duration of 1 
year; 
- the modification of the primary endpoint study duration from 48 weeks to a minimum of 24 weeks 
and key secondary objectives. 
- the change of the whole treatment regimen, including ATV, in subjects with confirmed virologic 
failure or virologic rebound above 1000 copies/mL; 
- the modification of the definition of virologic failure in accordance with the updated 2011 DHHS 
paediatric guidelines and clarified the virologic failure criteria to discontinue a subject in the study.

At baseline, the majority of subjects had normal laboratory test results. However, Grade 3 or 4 results 
were reported for some subjects: Grade 3 amylase (18%), Grade 3 ALT (3%), Grade 4 amylase (2%), 
Grade 3 low calcium, low chloride, and low sodium (1% each), and Grade 4 ALT and AST (1% each). 
At baseline, 29% of subjects had abnormal ECG findings (4 subjects [17%], 3 subjects [25%], 6 
subjects [29%], 12 subjects [34%], and 4 subjects [50%] in the 5-<10 kg [ATV 150 mg], 5-<10 kg 
[ATV 200 mg], 10-<15 kg, 15-<25 kg, and 25-<35 kg groups, respectively). The most common 
abnormal findings were left axis deviation or left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria only or 
sinus tachycardia; none were consistent with QT or PR prolongation, exclusion criteria for this study. 
Overall, 83% of subjects had used prior medications. The most commonly used prior medications were 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (61%), acetaminophen (58%), amoxicillin (44%), multivitamins 
(35%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (28%), and iron (21%). 
Virologic response – mITT analysis 
At Week 24 on the ATV powder cohort (n=99), 66% of subjects had HIV RNA < 400 c/mL and 47% of 
subjects had HIV RNA < 50 c/mL. In ARV-experienced and -naive subjects, the proportion of subjects 
with HIV RNA < 400 c/mL (65% and 68%, respectively) and < 50 c/mL (47% and 46%, respectively) 
was similar.

At Week 48 on the ATV powder cohort (n=80), 65% of subjects had HIV RNA < 400 c/mL and 45% of 
subjects had HIV RNA < 50 c/mL. In ARV-experienced and -naive subjects, the proportion of subjects 
with HIV RNA < 400 c/mL (60% and 73%, respectively) and < 50 c/mL (46% and 43%, respectively) 
was similar. 
HIV RNA changes from baseline 
The overall mean (median) change from baseline in HIV RNA was -2.53 (-2.80) log10 c/mL at Week 24 
and -2.71 (-2.90) log10 c/mL at Week 48. 
In the 5-<10 kg (ATV 150 mg), 5-<10 kg (ATV 200 mg), 10-<15 kg, 15-<25 kg and 25-<35 kg 
groups, the mean (median) change from baseline in HIV RNA was: 
- At Week 24: -2.10 (-2.17), -3.07 (-3.68), -2.69 (-3.17), -2.66 (-2.80) and -2.24 (-2.08) log10 c/mL, 
respectively. 
- At Week 48: -2.31 (-2.76), -4.06 (-4.06), -2.91 (-3.10), -2.70 (-2.62) and -3.97 (-3.97) log10 c/mL; 
respectively (Note: There was only 1 subject in the 25-<35 kg group and 2 subjects in the 5-<10 kg 
[ATV 200 mg] group.) 
CD4 cell count changes from baseline 
The overall mean (median) change from baseline in CD4 cell count was 214 (134) cells/mm3 at Week 
24 and 133 (215) cells/mm3 at Week 48.  
Virologic resistance 
By Week 48, a total amount of 36 subjects met the criteria for virologic failure. Twenty-one of these 
subjects had paired genotypic data (data at baseline and on treatment) and 17 had paired phenotypic 
resistance testing data. Eleven subjects (31%) were ARV naive and 25 subjects (69%) were ARV 
experienced. 
Five subjects developed a M184V mutation, and all 5 exhibited phenotypic resistance for emtricitabine 
(FTC) and lamivudine (3TC). One subject developed a major ATV mutation (I84V). This subject had 
ATV Ctrough values below the LLOQ due to rifabutin co-administration. 
Palatability 
Palatability survey on ATV powder (10% aspartame) and RTV was performed at each visit. Throughout 
the study, the majority of subjects took their dose of ATV mixed with milk or water, and 
palatability/acceptability of ATV powder was higher than for RTV: At Week 24, 87% and 81% of 
subjects did not have any trouble taking their doses of ATV and RTV, respectively. At Week 48, 83% 
and 74% of subjects did not have any trouble taking their doses of ATV and RTV, respectively. 
After the switch to ATV formulation with lower percentage of aspartame, the palatability survey on ATV 
powder (4.2% aspartame) and RTV was performed: At Week 24, 30/30 (100%) and 27/30 (90%) of 
subjects had no problem taking their doses of ATV and RTV, respectively. At Week 48, 15/15 (100%) 
and 14/15 (93%) of subjects had no problem taking their doses of ATV and RTV, respectively. 
The Facial Hedonic Scale was used to describe the palatability of the new ATV 4.2% aspartame powder 
formulation for subjects on ATV powder formulation in Stage 2 subjects who were ≥ 3 years old. At

Day 1/time of switch from ATV powder (10% aspartame) to the ATV powder (4.2% aspartame), 17 
subjects (65%) rated the ATV powder (4.2% aspartame) taste as “good” or “super good.” At 24 weeks 
of treatment with ATV powder (4.2% aspartame), 15/18 subjects (83%) rated the ATV powder (4.2% 
aspartame) taste as “good” or “super good.” At 48 weeks of treatment with ATV powder (4.2% 
aspartame), all 9 subjects rated the ATV powder (4.2% aspartame) taste as “super good.”

A total amount of 36 subjects met the criteria for virologic failure. Twenty-one of these subjects had 
paired genotypic data (data at baseline and on treatment) and 17 had paired phenotypic resistance 
testing data. One subject developed a major ATV mutation (I84V). This subject had ATV Ctrough values 
below the LLOQ due to rifabutin co-administration.

a Week 24 results are shown for the 200 kg weight group as only 1 subject had reached Week 48. 
The antiviral efficacy seems slightly higher in subjects with baseline viral load < 100,000 c/ml 
compared to ≥ 100,000 c/ml: at week 48, the rates of HIV RNA < 50 c/ml are 57% (36/63) and 46% 
(33/71), and the rates of HIV RNA < 400 c/ml are 73% (46/63) and 65% (46/71), respectively. As 
regards the baseline NRTI background, Kivexa was mostly used (58.2% of subjects), the other 
backgrounds mainly consisted of AZT/3TC (15%) and ABC/AZT (13.4%). The best response rates were 
observed with Kivexa (HIV RNA < 50 c/ml and < 400 c/ml at week 48 at 63% and 79.5%, 
respectively) compared to AZT-based NRTI backgrounds (HIV RNA < 50 c/ml and < 400 c/ml at week 
48 around 25-30% and 40-50%, respectively).

Table 27: Virologic Outcome at Week 24 - 5-<10 kg group - Week 24 ATV Powder 
Cohort (PRINCE I, PRINCE II, and Integrated) 
Although exposures were generally higher in the 5-<10 kg ATV 200 mg cohort compared to the 5-<10 
kg ATV 150 mg cohort, the virologic response as analysed by mITT was not improved overall in the 
ATV 200 mg cohort. A possible explanation for the low rate of success in the 200 mg ATV group was 
the rate of discontinuation before Week 24. Five (5/12) subjects in the 5-<10 kg 200 mg ATV cohort 
discontinued prior to Week 24 and were counted as virologic failures in the mITT analysis. In the 
observed analysis, where subjects who discontinued early are counted as missing, the differences 
between the 150 and 200 mg groups in virologic success rates (HIV RNA < 50 c/mL) analysis are less 
marked (38.9% and 47.6% in 150 mg ATV groups in PRINCE I and PRINCE II, and 28.6% in the 200 
mg ATV group in PRINCE II), while the rates of virologic suppression to HIV RNA < 400 c/mL were 
similar (66.7% and 71.4% for subjects receiving 150 mg ATV in PRINCE I and PRINCE II, and 71.4% 
for subjects receiving 200 mg ATV in PRINCE II). 
In addition, the median baseline viral load was notably higher in the 200 mg ATV cohort (5.43 log10; 
range 4.4 to 5.9) in PRINCE II compared with the 150 mg ATV cohorts from PRINCE I (5.0 log10; 
range 2.8 to 5.9) and PRINCE II (5.0 log10 (range 2.0 to 5.9). Furthermore, the mean log10 drop in 
viral load at Week 24 was slightly higher in the 200 mg ATV cohort (-3.07) in PRINCE II compared with 
the 150 mg cohorts in PRINCE I (-2.41) and PRINCE II (-2.10).  
Overall, in the 5- 10kg weight group, viral success was similar for the 150mg dose cohorts in PRINCE 1 
and 2, while the 200mg dose cohort had a considerably lower success rate. While there were some 
differences in baseline viral load and treatment experience, an effect on results cannot be concluded 
based on the available data in this very small group. 
There is no reason to assume that efficacy in this weight group, when given a dose of 200/80 mg, 
would be considerably lower than in other groups based on the C24 levels. The concern is if at this 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 60/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose level safety or tolerability problems may contribute to non- adherence or lead to adverse events 
and/ or treatment discontinuation. In this regards, the high number or dropouts in this group is of 
concern, however it appears that drop- outs were mostly not due to safety or tolerability issues. 
10-<15 kg weight group 
Comparison of individual study data showed a notably lower virologic response rate in the 10-<15 kg 
weight group in PRINCE II (30.0%) than PRINCE I (68.4%), and the lower response rate in PRINCE II 
appeared to be driving the lower rate of response in the 10-<15 kg group in the integrated analysis. 
The most likely explanation for the lower efficacy observed in the 10-<15 kg weight band in PRINCE II 
is viral blips that occurred in the Week 48 analysis window. A total of 15 subjects in PRINCE II had 
virologic failure at < 50 c/mL within the Week 48 analysis window. Of these, 7 subjects demonstrated 
virologic suppression to < 400 c/mL at this time point. These 7 patients recovered a viral load < 50 
c/ml after their virologic failure. This is further supported by the similar efficacy observed at Week 48 
using a virologic cut-off of < 400 c/mL of 73.7% for subjects in PRINCE I and 70.0% for subjects in 
PRINCE II. 
15-<25 kg weight group 
There do not appear to be significant differences in baseline characteristics between the subjects in the 
15-<25 kg weight band from PRINCE I and PRINCE II to account for decreased antiviral response in 
subjects in PRINCE II. However, the similarity of antiviral response (HIV RNA < 50 c/mL and HIV RNA 
< 400 c/mL) evaluated using an observed analysis suggests that the difference in response by the 
snapshot analysis is likely due to the number of subjects who discontinued the study or did not provide 
data during the Week 48 window. Seven subjects in this weight band in PRINCE II were counted as 
failures due to discontinuation for reasons unrelated to study drug. These subjects were included in the 
denominator for the snapshot analysis and excluded in the observed analysis. 
25-<35 kg weight group 
Only 2 subjects in the 25-<35 kg weight group had reached the Week 48 at the time of data cutoff, 
including one subject with VL < 50 c/ml. 
In summary, the exploration of the data did not show evidence that higher viral load, pre-existing PI 
mutations or the type of OBR affected results. The small numbers of subjects in the respective 
subgroups are the most likely reason for the inability to identify relevant associations. 
Supportive study 
Study AI424466 
A taste assessment study (AI424466) was performed to compare the sweetness and palatability of 2 
new ATV powders formulations (4.2% aspartame +/- sucralose) to the current ATV powder (10% 
aspartame) in 12 healthy subjects, and to select one ATV powder that has the sweetness most similar 
to the current ATV powder.

Methods 
This is a Phase 1 double-blind, randomized, 3-treatment, 3-period, 3-sequence crossover study in 
healthy adult subjects. Twelve subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment sequences. Three 
treatments were assessed: 
- Treatment A (15 mg/5 mL ATV powder current formulation [10% aspartame]; Reference),  
- Treatment B (15 mg/5 mL ATV in New powder 1 [4.2% aspartame]),  
- Treatment C (15 mg/5 mL ATV in New powder 2 [4.2% aspartame + sucralose]).  
On Day 1, subjects tasted 5 mL each of treatments in a double-blind, randomized sequence. Treatment 
tastings were separated by a washout period of at least 45 minutes, and after each tasting, subjects 
rinsed their mouths with water and ate 2 saltine crackers. 
The primary objectives were to compare the sweetness of 2 new ATV powders formulations to the 
current ATV powder in healthy subjects, and to select one ATV powder that has the sweetness most 
similar to the current ATV powder. The secondary objective was to compare the overall palatability of 
the 2 new ATV powders to the current ATV powder in healthy subjects. 
Subjects immediately scored the respective treatments for sweetness (during Taste Screening and 
Treatment Tasting) and overall palatability (during Treatment Tasting only) using the following scales: 
- Sweetness was assessed using a subjective sweet intensity scoring system: 0 = no sweet taste, 1 = 
mildly sweet, 2 = moderately sweet, 3 = very sweet. Subjects were permitted to select a whole or half 
score number (eg, 1.5) between the minimum score of 0 and the maximum score of 3.0. 
- Overall palatability was scored using a scale of 1 through 5, with 1 being least palatable and 5 being 
most palatable. Only whole score numbers were accepted.

Outcomes and estimation 
Sweetness 
The median score for all 3 treatment blends was mildly sweet. Treatments A and B had similar median 
and mean sweetness scores. One subject scored Treatment B as “no sweet taste;” a different subject 
scored Treatment C as “no sweet taste” and commented “it tastes bitter.” No subject scored Very 
Sweet for any treatment blend.

The sweetness of the 2 new ATV powder formulations was comparable to the current ATV powder 
formulation. The median sweetness scores and overall score variability suggest that 4.2% aspartame 
(Treatment B) tasted similar in sweetness to the 10% aspartame formulation (Treatment A). 
The median palatability score and overall score variability suggest that 4.2% aspartame (Treatment B) 
was more palatable than 4.2% aspartame plus sucralose (Treatment C). 
The median sweetness score from the 4.2% aspartame test formulation (Treatment B) was equal to 
the 10% aspartame reference formulation (Treatment A) score with similar minimum to maximum 
range; therefore, the 4.2% aspartame formulation (Treatment B) can be recommended as the new 
ATV powder formulation. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two studies, PRINCE I and II, were performed in order to describe safety, efficacy and PK of the new 
formulation ATV powder in children, boosted with RTV and in combination with 2 NRTIs. Both are 
relatively small studies enrolling HIV experienced and naïve paediatric subjects, which will affect 
interpretation of efficacy data, while in adults at least, there was no difference in PK between these 
groups. Subjects had to harbour virus susceptible to ATV and at least 2 NRTI. Subjects with a history 
of ≥ 2 PI failures were not eligible. Apart from subjects with any major PI mutations, those with 
combinations of minor resistance mutations were ineligible, with some differences between the studies 
in exclusion criteria, so that subjects harbouring virus with relevantly reduced susceptibility were not 
likely enrolled. 
These studies differ by the enrolled subjects: from 3 months to <6 years for PRINCE I and from 3 
months to <11 years for PRINCE II. Although in both studies the subjects were initially distributed into 
3 weight groups at the inclusion (5-<10 kg [ATV 150 mg], 10-<15 kg [ATV 200 mg] and 15-<25 kg 
[ATV 250 mg]), the PRINCE II study was afterward amended to enrolled subjects into 2 additional 
weight groups: 5-<10 kg (ATV 200 mg) and 25-<35 kg (ATV 300 mg). For these two weight groups, 
only Week 24 results are relevant. 
No specific guidance was given on the choice of the optimal background therapy (OBT), except that 
tenofovir, which is not recommended in children < 2 years of age, was not allowed. OBT may differ 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 64/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between different age (and hence weight) groups, with potential impact on PK and efficacy/ safety 
results. 
While PRINCE II was still ongoing (but PRINCE I was over), the level of aspartame in the tested ATV 
powder formulation had to be reduced from 10% to 4.2% in accordance to the PDCO request and the 
acceptable daily intake of aspartame determined by the EFSA. The CHMP has concluded that no bridge 
study was required and it is not expected that ATV exposure was affected. Palatability results, issued 
from the PRINCE studies and from the taste study AI424466, did not highlighted specific concerns with 
this new formulation. 
The HIV RNA assay had to be changed during the trials to Abbott Real Time HIV RNA-1 assay as the 
Roche Amplicor assay was discontinued. Although it is disputable to change the HIV RNA assay during 
study, based on the response to the D120 LOQ, the change of the HIV RNA assay did not significantly 
impact the efficacy results from PRINCE I (all subjects had already reached the 48 time point before 
the change occurred) and II studies (only small number of subjects involved). 
The majority of subjects enrolled in both PRINCE studies come from Africa, especially the youngest 
strata, have high viral load (HIV RNA > 100,000 c/ml, especially the youngest strata). There are more 
ARV experienced subjects in PRINCE II than in PRINCE I, especially in subjects weighing 5-<10 kg (10 
of the 12 subjects with the recommended 200/80 mg ATV/RTV dose), which could have a significant 
impact on the antiviral response. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The studies were not designed or powered to evaluate efficacy. Due to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria applied, the population enrolled in the clinical study may have been less likely to harbour virus 
with reduced susceptibility. 
The efficacy results of PRINCE I show a lower virologic suppression at Week 48 and a slower decrease 
of viral load are observed in subjects weighing 5-<10 kg, suggesting that 150 mg is suboptimal in this 
subgroup. This is in accordance with the PK results showing a lower ATV exposure in this subgroup. 
Overall, virologic suppression of HIV RNA < 50 c/mL was observed in 50% of ARV-experienced 
subjects vs. 54% of ARV-naïve subjects, and 62% of ARV-experienced subjects achieved HIV RNA < 
400 c/mL vs. 79% of ARV-naïve subjects. The greater rate of response in ARV-naive subjects in the 
paediatric studies is consistent with observations in adult and paediatric studies. It is increasingly 
recognised that dividing subjects by treatment history into naïve and experienced no longer 
appropriately defines the relevant treatment populations. It is more relevant do differentiate between 
subject harbouring HIV that is predicted to be fully susceptible to antiretroviral drugs (i.e. without 
mutations conferring drug resistance in their major viral populations, as determined by standard 
genotypic assays) and those that harbour virus not fully susceptible. It may be more informative to 
provide efficacy data for the different weight/ dose cohorts separated along those lines. 
Additional subgroup analyses were provided in an attempt to better interpret efficacy results 
depending on age, treatment experience, viral load. 
When combined the results of PRINCE I and II studies, the antiviral efficacy seems slightly higher in 
subjects with baseline viral load < 100,000 c/ml compared to ≥ 100,000 c/ml. As regards the baseline 
NRTI background, the best response rates were observed with Kivexa compared to AZT-based NRTI 
backgrounds. 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 65/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When focused on the group 5-<10 kg, the number of subjects treated with the endorsed ATV dose 
(200 mg) is very low, with only 12 subjects at week 24 and 1 subject at week 48. Therefore, only 
week 24 results can be interpreted. The percentage of subjects with HIV RNA < 50 c/ml and < 400 
c/ml is low (16.7% and 41.7%, respectively) and inferior to the results obtained with the lower ATV 
dose of 150 mg (38.6% and 61.4%, respectively). This could be due to a high rate of discontinuation 
before week 24 (5/12 subjects), considered as virologic failure in the mITT analysis. However, none of 
these subjects discontinued due to lack of efficacy or treatment-related toxicity. In addition, 10/12 
subjects had high baseline viral load ≥ 100,000 c/ml, versus 30/44 subjects.  
Overall, in the 5- 10kg weight group, viral success was similar for the 150mg dose cohorts in PRINCE 1 
and 2, while the 200mg dose cohort had a considerably lower success rate. While there were some 
differences in baseline viral load and treatment experience, an effect on results cannot be concluded 
based on the available data in this very small group. 
There is no reason to assume that efficacy in this weight group, when given a dose of 200/80 mg, 
would be considerably lower than in other groups based on the C24 levels. The concern is if at this dose 
level safety or tolerability problems may contribute to non- adherence or lead to adverse events and/ 
or treatment discontinuation. In this regards, the high number or dropouts in this group is of concern, 
however it appears that drop- outs were mostly not due to safety or tolerability issues. 
As regards the group 10-<15 kg, the rate of subjects at week 48 is low when considered the primary 
efficacy endpoint of HIV RNA < 50 c/ml (48.7%), but with a less sensitive criteria of HIV RNA < 400 
c/ml the overall virological response (68.7%) of combined PRINCE I and II studies better meets 
expectations. Of note, 7 patients reported blips < 400 c/ml within week 48. All of them recovered HIV 
RNA < 50 c/ml.  
In conclusion, the applicant has made some attempts to better understand efficacy results in the 
paediatric population. However, the limited size of the population challenges the interpretation of 
subgroup analyses. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It is accepted that dose considerations for the paediatric population should mainly be based on PK and 
PK/PD data, aiming to achieve exposures similar to the adult population. Efficacy data may be 
considered supportive. The results as provided are quite difficult to interpret as the studies were 
uncontrolled, weight cohorts were small and included both naïve and experienced patients and results 
are inconsistent between studies. 
With these caveats in mind, the efficacy results, while less favourable than seen with comparable  
treatment regimens, may not give reasons for major concerns in themselves provided PK and PK/PD 
data allow concluding that exposures in the paediatric age brackets are sufficiently similar to those in 
adults. Data are however also only of limited value in supporting the proposed doses, with particular 
uncertainties in the 5- 10kg weight band. Indeed, while the PK data are limited to substantiate the 
adequacy of the dose in children from 5 to 10 kg, the poor response rate observed at the 
recommended dose <20% of patients with undetectable viral load at week 24 can only call for further 
reservations.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical development plan for ATV in paediatric patients was initially based on findings from Study 
AI424020 that exhibited comparable safety of the combination of ATV/ritonavir to those in the adult

studies. The data from Study AI424020 were previously submitted and reviewed to support the 
currently approved ATV capsule dosing in paediatric patients 6 years and older. In this study, the 
safety profile of ATV/RTV in paediatric patients was consistent with that observed in adults, with 
predicted exposures to ATV that were comparable to adult exposures. 
As regards the powder formulation of ATV and the extension of indication in children <6 years of age, 
this document provides cumulative safety data from studies PRINCE I and PRINCE II in subjects using 
ATV oral powder boosted with RTV. The results of the Week 48 and cumulative safety analyses are 
included in this submission, as well as pooled data on subjects from both studies. 
Patient exposure 
The analysis population consists of enrolled and treated subjects in Studies AI424397 and AI424451 
grouped according to baseline weight bands. 
Overall, a total of 155 subjects were treated with ATV powder:

The median time on study therapy was 72 weeks (range: 1 - 192 weeks) for ATV powder and 72 
weeks (range: 1 - 192 weeks) for RTV oral solution. 
The numbers of subjects exposed to the 4.2% aspartame ATV powder formulation were 61 through 12 
weeks, 50 through 24 weeks, 42 through 36 weeks, and 30 through 48 weeks. 
Grade 3 or 4 results were reported for some subjects. (Note: In general, these test results were 
obtained at the randomization visit, not at the visit where subject eligibility was determined.): 
- Haematology: Grade 4 platelets (2 subjects [3%]) and Grade 4 absolute neutrophils (1 subject) 
- Serum chemistry: Grade 3 amylase (28 subjects [18%]), Grade 3 ALT (3 subjects [2%]), Grade 4 
amylase (3 subjects [2%]), Grade 3 lipase, low calcium, low chloride, and low sodium (1 subject 
each), and Grade 4 alkaline phosphatase, ALT, and AST (1 subject each). 
At baseline, 52 subjects (34%) had abnormal ECG findings, and 3 subjects (2%) had CDC Class C 
AIDS event (oral candidiasis, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis in 1 
subject each). 
Overall, 88% of subjects had used prior medications. Prior medications used by ≥ 20% of subjects 
were sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (60%), multivitamins (34%), nevirapine (36%), 3TC (33%), and 
lopinavir/RTV (22%).

Cardiac disorders 
Five subjects (3%) had cardiac disorder AEs while on ATV powder:  
- 3 subjects (8%) in the 10-<15 kg group had cardiac disorder AEs (Grade 1 ECG abnormal, ECG QT 
prolonged, and tachycardia in 1 subject each). Only the ECG QT prolonged was considered related to 
the study drug by the investigators.  
- 2 subjects (4%) in the 15-<25 kg group had cardiac disorder AEs (Grade 1 first-degree AV block) 
considered related to the study drug by the investigators. 
Rash

rashes. One Grade 2 - 4 related rash event (prurigo in 1 subject in the 10-<15 kg group) was 
reported. 
AIDS-related AEs 
Overall, 8 subjects (5%) had CDC Class C AIDS events while on ATV powder: 4 subjects in the 5-<10 
kg (ATV 150 mg) group, 2 subjects in the 10-<15 kg group and 2 subjects in the 15-<25 kg group. 
The most common event was pulmonary tuberculosis (3 subjects [1%]). None of these CDC Class C 
AIDS events was considered drug related by the investigators. 
Renal toxicity AEs 
Overall, 4 subjects (3%) had renal toxicity AEs while on ATV powder (1 subject each in the 5-<10 kg 
[ATV 150 mg] group had hematuria and proteinuria, 1 subject in the 5-<10 kg [ATV 200 mg] group 
had hematuria, and 1 subject in the 10-<15 kg group had dysuria). Only the hematuria in the subject 
in the 5-<10 kg [ATV 200 mg] group was considered drug related by the investigators.

Lactic Acidosis 
Overall, 7 treated subjects (5%) had lactic acidosis syndrome/symptomatic hyperlactatemia (LAS/SHL) 
events (6 Grade 1 hepatomegaly, 1 Grade 2 hepatitis). None of these events was considered related to 
the study therapy by the investigators. 
Lipodystrophy 
None of the subjects on ATV powder had lipodystrophy-related events. 
Cholelithiasis and nephrolithiasis 
No subjects had cholelithiasis or nephrolithiasis. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Grade 1 - 4 hematologic abnormalities were haemoglobin (50%), absolute neutrophils (41%), 
haematocrit (20%), platelets (7%), and white blood cells (2%). Grade 3 - 4 hematologic abnormalities 
were absolute neutrophils (9%) and haemoglobin and platelets (1 subject each). 
Liver function tests 
Grade 1 - 4 LFTs were total bilirubin (54%), ALT (38%), AST (14%), alkaline phosphatase (13%), and 
albumin (4%). Grade 3 - 4 LFT abnormalities were total bilirubin (16%), ALT (9%), alkaline 
phosphatase (3%), and AST (2%). Percent change from baseline in total bilirubin was consistent over 
time in all weight bands. These rates were higher compared to the adult population as represented in 
Study AI424138:

Potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was defined as transaminases (ALT or AST) > 3 x upper limit 
of normal (ULN) concurrent with total bilirubin > 2 x ULN at the same sampling time point. One case of 
DILI was reported in study AI424397, and one potential case of DILI was reported in study AI424451. 
Other serum chemistries 
The majority of subjects had normal serum chemistries, except for low bicarbonate (92%), high 
amylase (74%), and low sodium (50%). Other Grade 1 – 4 serum chemistry abnormalities were lipase 
(44%), fasting total cholesterol (45%), fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (35%), high calcium 
(24%), high potassium (17%), low non-fasting glucose and high non-fasting glucose (16% each), 
fasting low glucose (14%), blood urea nitrogen/urea (12%), high fasting glucose (10%), low 
potassium (9%), low calcium (5%), high sodium and uric acid (2% each), and low chloride (1 subject). 
While 92% of subjects had low bicarbonate levels, the majority were Grade 1 - 2. Many of the subjects 
exhibited low serum bicarbonate levels during the pretreatment period, likely due to a variety of 
causes. Some likely causes include concurrent dehydration due to diarrhea, vomiting, and poor 
nutritional status. 
In all subjects who had normal amylase/lipase levels at baseline and who had abnormal levels reported 
during the study period were on nucleoside backbone therapy of either ZDV/3TC or ABC/3TC. None of 
these subjects appeared to have clinical pancreatitis based on clinical symptoms and signs. In 2 
subjects, the abnormalities resolved on continued therapy, in 4 subjects, study therapy was 
discontinued, and in 3 subjects, the abnormalities resolved. 
Grade 3 - 4 serum chemistry abnormalities were amylase (33%), lipase (8%), low bicarbonate (1%), 
and fasting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting total cholesterol, high potassium, and uric acid 
(1 subject each). 
All of the Grade 3 low serum bicarbonate levels, 60% of the Grade 3 - 4 elevations, and 50% of the 
Grade 3 pancreatic amylase elevations occurred in subjects in the 5-<10 kg weight bands irrespective 
of dose (150 mg or 200 mg dose of ATV powder).

ECG findings 
At Week 48, all but 1 subject (in the 10-<15 kg group, QTc > 500 msec) had QTc intervals (Fridericia) 
≤ 450 msec, and 3 subjects (2%) had borderline values of PR interval (> 450 - 480 msec). 
At Week 48, the overall mean change from baseline in heart rate was -16.3 bpm (range: -66 to 28 
bpm), the overall mean change from baseline in PR interval was 5.7 msec (range: -38 to 50 msec) and 
the overall mean change from baseline in QTc interval (Fridericia) was 6.6 msec (range: -44 to 51 
msec). 
Safety in special populations 
Adverse events by geographic region 
While on ATV powder, 92% of subjects in Africa, 89% of subjects in North America, 88% of subjects in 
South America, all 9 subjects in Europe, and the 1 subject in Asia had AEs. Although baseline regional 
differences in AEs may exist due to varying living conditions, due to the small sample sizes, no 
conclusions can be drawn regarding these data. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Overall, 13 subjects (8%) had AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy while on ATV powder. 
The only AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy reported in ≥ 2 subjects were ALT increased, 
pulmonary tuberculosis, and vomiting (2 subjects [1%] each). 
Overdose and dosing errors 
There were 2 cases of ATV overdose in study AI424451 who received ATV 250 mg twice daily instead 
of 250 mg once daily, one subject during 7 days and one subject during 14 days. Some AEs (left 
ventricular hypertrophy at ECG and mild hyperbilirubinemia with total bilirubin at 1.5 mg/dl) were 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 73/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reported in the subject overdosed during 7 days. Both subjects did not receive treatment for these 
events, and no action was taken with regard to the study drug.  
Overall, 23.9% (37/155) subjects had 54 dosing interruptions > 3 consecutive days, and more than 
half (32 vs. 22 interruptions) occurred after Week 48. Three of these 37 subjects were receiving the 
ATV capsule at the time of a dose interruption. Causes of interruptions > 3 days were as follows: 
•  Dosing error/missed patient dose, and missed dose due to absent caregiver or other reason 
was the most common reason for dose interruption across dose groups (17.4% [27/155]) and 
occurred more often in the 5-<10 kg weight group (30.4% [17/56]), compared with the 10-
<15 kg group (10.0% [4/40]), and the 15-<25 kg group (11.8% [6/51]). 
•  Adverse events leading to dose interruptions > 3 days were reported for 5.8% (9/155) of 
subjects: 3.6% (2/56) in the 5-<10 kg group; 7.5% (3/40) in the 10-<15 kg group, and 7.8% 
(4/51) in the 15-<25 kg weight group. One subject had a dose interruption > 3 day due to an 
adverse event (AE) and a missed dose. Adverse events leading to dose interruptions were 
primarily laboratory abnormalities (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] elevations [3], alkaline 
phosphatase elevation [1]), or vomiting (1), rotavirus infection (1) or unspecified AE (3). 
•  Dosing error (unspecified) led to dose interruptions for 2 additional subjects. 
The dosing interruptions in PRINCE 1 and PRINCE II were not due to product design, errors in 
prescribing, difficulties with understanding how to administer the dose, or improper dose administered, 
but were omission errors (missed doses) or temporary interruption within the context of an AE. There 
is no evidence that these dose interruptions led to therapeutic failure, and overall, drug compliance 
was good in these studies. However, a significantly higher proportion of subjects with dose 
interruptions > 3 days was noted at one investigational site in South Africa. This was Site 1 in PRINCE 
I and Site 10 in PRINCE II, which was the same site participating in each study. This site accounted for 
22 of the 37 subjects with dose interruptions > 3 days. 
Post marketing experience 
A literature search performed by the MAH covering the period from 01-Sep-2013 through 31-Dec-2014 
confirmed that the safety profile of ATV in real-world clinical use in paediatric patients continues to be 
consistent with the safety profile that was established in clinical trials. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Previously, ATV powder was administered as part of the study AI424020 in 66 paediatric subjects from 
3 months to 13 years of age, but at different doses (310 mg/m² in combination with ritonavir). It was 
concluded that study AI424020 did not highlight new or unexpected safety findings related to ATV in 
this paediatric population, and there were no clinically relevant differences in the safety profiles of the 
ATV capsule and powder formulations. 
The safety database presented consists of 155 subjects, paediatric subjects above 3 months of age, 
weighing between 5 kg and 35 kg and treated by RTV-boosted ATV powder in combination with 2 
NRTIs (excluding TDF), who had a median exposure time of around 72 weeks to ATV/RTV. There were 
however considerable differences in median exposure between the weight cohorts, making 
interpretations of the safety profile considerably more difficult. In particular, the 5-<10kg (200/80 mg) 
group and the 25-35kg group had less than half the exposure duration of the remaining groups, and 
were also smaller (respectively 12 subjects weighing 5-<10kg received ATV dose of 200 mg and only 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 74/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
one has week 48 data available and 8 subjects in the highest weight group). Only 100 patients have 
been treated with ATV powder during at least 48 weeks (and 133 patients reached Week 24);  
AEs in these groups may underestimate the prevalence in general and compared to other groups. The 
relative lack of safety data in the higher dose 5-<10kg cohort is particularly problematic. Over a 
quarter of the 155 subjects enrolled did not complete phase one of the study. Discontinuations were 
most common in the 5-<10kg 200/80mg group, but this observation is based on very small numbers.  
The vast majority of subjects were recruited in Africa, and this percentage was higher in the 5-<10kg 
weight groups than in the older groups, which may affect comparison of AEs between cohorts and may 
not be entirely representative of the situation in the EU. 
The safety data are essentially based on exposure to the ATV powder formulation containing 10% 
aspartame, but it is not expected that the decrease in aspartame to 4.2% in the formulation proposed 
for marketing is associated detrimental effects on safety. 
Consequently, it seems difficult to fully interpret the safety profile of the weight-band doses of ATV 
powder in these paediatric subjects. Keeping in mind these limitations, the following issues could be 
raised: 
- PK data suggest that for safety events related to Cmax, if any, the safety profile of ATV in paediatric 
patients may be expected to be similar to that in adults. 
- The main ATV-related AEs were related to hyperbilirubinemia. This AE is dose-dependent and 
therefore reflect the ATV exposure. The frequencies of other ATV-related AEs (notably gastrointestinal 
disorders and ALT/AST increase) are low (<2%). There is no appreciable difference with adult data 
issued from pivotal study AI424138, where hyperbilirubinemia-related AEs, rash and gastrointestinal 
disorders were observed with a similar or higher frequency than in the PRINCE studies. 
- Abnormal chemistry laboratory (mainly hyperamylasemia) and ECG disorders were reported in some 
subjects at baseline. 
- The frequency of AEs seems consistent across the weight groups. 
- The profile of adverse events reported is in line with what can be expected in the study population, 
with some differences between age groups which seem in line with expectations. 
- ECG findings are coherent with the known cardiac safety profile of ATV, but could be biased by the 
increase of age in young subjects. QTc and PR interval prolongations may occurred with the use of 
ATV. It is unclear to what extent the level of cardiac toxicity in both studies could be regarded as 
expected based on knowledge in adults. In addition, the observed rate of adverse cardiac events, 
specifically PR prolongation, in the submitted paediatric studies is considerably less than previously 
reported in the paediatric population. As part of the D120 LOQ, the applicant was asked to further 
discuss this finding. It was argued that this may be due to the non-inclusion in the PRINCE studies of 
subjects with baseline cardiac abnormalities, including AV block. However, as no paediatric subjects 
with cardiac abnormalities were included, the cardiac risk of ATV observed in the PRINCE studies may 
be underestimated compared to real life. The exclusion criteria should be stated in the description of 
the PRINCE studies. 
- Low bicarbonate (92%), high amylase (74%), and low sodium (50%) were the most common 
abnormalities and are likely associated with GI adverse events, which in turn may or may not be drug 
related. The observed abnormalities have generally been observed previously as reflected in the SPC of 
the Reyataz capsule formulation. As part of the D120 the applicant was notably asked to further 
discuss those findings. It is agreed that these elevated rates compared to historical data in adults 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 75/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seems to be related to the dehydration and poor nutritional status of these paediatric subjects, which 
were mainly from South Africa. The great majority of subjects had abnormal biological values already 
at baseline. No increased risk of pancreatitis was observed in these studies.  
- The rates of function test (LFT) abnormalities (Grade 1-4 and Grade 3-4) were higher in the 
paediatric population as represented in PRINCE I and PRINCE II compared to the adult population as 
represented in Study AI424138. The attitude of the applicant to assign the higher rate of transaminase 
elevations in children as compared to adults to the effect of infectious diseases is more disputable 
when considering that transaminases elevations is an expected finding with ATV/rtv as for other 
protease inhibitors with primary hepatic metabolism. Moreover, transaminases elevations accounted 
for a significant part of the treatment discontinuations. Consequently, the more frequent elevation of 
transaminases in children than in adults should be stated in section 4.8. 
On the 37 patients with dosing interruptions > 3 consecutive days due to dosing error or missed doses, 
22 occurred in the same site investigation (Site 1 PRINCE I corresponding to Site 10 for PRINCE II of 
South Africa) and were mainly due to social or family reasons, such as the absence of caregiver. This 
finding indeed makes unlikely the causality of the product design.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, based on the original submission and the applicant’s response to the D120 LOQ, the 
safety profile of ATV powder can be regarded as being overall similar to that of ATV capsules in adults, 
and no new safety signal was detected. Some issues nevertheless to be highlighted in the SmPC (trend 
for higher rate of transaminase elevation, exclusion of children with cardiac abnormalities in the 
PRINCE studies).

the electrocardiogram in some patients. TRADENAME should 
be used with caution in patients with preexisting conduction 
system diseaseCaution should be used when 
coadministering TRADENAME with medicinal products known 
to induce PR interval prolongation (see 6 INTERACTION

existing conduction problems (second degree or higher 
atrioventricular or complex bundle-branch block), REYATAZ 
should be used with caution and only if the benefits exceed 
the risk (see section 5.1). Particular caution should be used 
when prescribing REYATAZ in association with medicinal 
products which have the potential to increase the QT

5.3 Preclinical safety data 
During in vitro studies, cloned human cardiac potassium 
channel (hERG), was inhibited by 15% at a concentration 
(30 μM) of atazanavir corresponding to 30 fold the free drug 
concentration at Cmax in humans. Similar concentrations of 
atazanavir increased by 13% the action potential duration 
(APD90) in rabbit Purkinje fibres study. Electrocardiographic 
changes (sinus bradycardia, prolongation of PR interval, 
prolongation of QT interval, and prolongation of QRS 
complex) were observed only in an initial 2-week oral 
toxicity study performed in dogs. Subsequent 9-month oral 
toxicity studies in dogs showed no drug-related 
electrocardiographic changes. The clinical relevance of these 
non-clinical data is unknown. Potential cardiac effects of this 
product in humans cannot be ruled out (see sections 4.4 
and 4.8). The potential for PR prolongation should be 
considered in cases of overdose (see section 4.9).

with food. Ritonavir is used as a booster of atazanavir 
pharmacokinetics (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). (See also 
section 4.4 Withdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive 
conditions). 
Patients with hepatic impairment: In case of withdrawal of 
ritonavir from the initial recommended ritonavir boosted 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 92/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 39: Risk Minimization Measures by Safety Concern 
regimen (see section 4.4), unboosted REYATAZ could be 
maintained in patients with mild hepatic impairment at a 
dose of 400 mg, and in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment with a reduced dose of 300 mg once daily with 
food (see section 5.2). Unboosted REYATAZ must not be 
used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Withdrawal of ritonavir only under restrictive conditions 
The recommended standard treatment is REYATAZ boosted 
with ritonavir, ensuring optimal pharmacokinetic parameters 
and level of virologic suppression. 
The withdrawal of ritonavir from the boosted regimen of 
REYATAZ is not recommended, but may be considered in 
adults patients at the dose of 400 mg once daily with food 
only under the following combined restrictive conditions: 
Absence of prior virologic failure 
Undetectable viral load during the last 6 months under 
current regimen 
Viral strains not harbouring HIV resistance associated 
mutations (RAMs) to current regimen. 
REYATAZ given without ritonavir should not be considered in 
patients treated with a backbone regimen containing 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and with other concomitant 
medications that reduce atazanavir bioavailability (see 
section 4.5 In case of withdrawal of ritonavir from the 
recommended atazanavir boosted regimen) or in case of 
perceived challenging compliance. 
REYATAZ given without ritonavir should not be used in 
pregnant patients given that it could result of suboptimal 
exposure of particular concern for the mother infection and 
vertical transmission. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other 
forms of interaction 
Other Interactions: If withdrawal of ritonavir is medically 
warranted under restrictive conditions (see section 4.4), 
special attention should be given to atazanavir interactions 
that may differ in the absence of ritonavir (see information 
below in Table 2).

before. No single dose of famotidine should exceed 20 mg, 
and the total daily dose of famotidine should not exceed 40 
mg. 
the need to consider that: 
▪ co-administration of voriconazole and REYATAZ without 
ritonavir may affect atazanavir concentrations 
▪ co-administration of fluticasone and REYATAZ without 
ritonavir may increase fluticasone concentrations relative to 
fluticasone given alone 
▪ if an oral contraceptive is administered with REYATAZ 
without ritonavir, it is recommended that the oral 
contraceptive contain no more than 30 µg of 
ethinyloestradiol 
▪ No dose adjustment of lamotrigine is required. 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Data on withdrawal of ritonavir from atazanavir boosted 
regimen (see also section 4.4) 
Study 136 (INDUMA) 
Eleven subjects (13%) in the unboosted REYATAZ group 
and 6 (7%) in the REYATAZ + ritonavir group, had virologic 
rebound. Four subjects in the unboosted REYATAZ group 
and 2 in the REYATAZ + ritonavir group had HIV RNA > 500 
copies/ml during the maintenance phase. No subject in 
either group showed emergence of protease inhibitor 
resistance. The M184V substitution in reverse transcriptase, 
which confers resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine, 
was detected in 2 subjects in the unboosted REYATAZ and 1 
subject in the REYATAZ + ritonavir group.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
So far, Reyataz is approved for use in the treatment of HIV infection for adults and children from 6 
years of age either in first line or in treatment experienced patients but with restriction in terms of PI 
resistance (<4 PI mutations).  
A new formulation for extending the use of Reyataz in younger children from 3 months of age is 
proposed. As a matter of fact, the Applicant has in the past (2009) already claimed an indication in this 
young population based on PK and clinical data derived from a clinical study AI424020, but the 
application was withdrawn in view of major objections raised by the CHMP on the critical deficiencies to 
substantiate the adequacy of the dose in children from 3 months of age. 
The clinical development in support of this new application is derived from two clinical studies: PRINCE 
I and PRINCE II. These two similarly designed studies enrolled a mix population of children with or 
without ARV experience, with different backbone regimen (excluding tenofovir, without active NRTI 
backbone and no ATV resistance) and with level of viremia exceeding 1000 copies/ml, with high level 
of viremia >100 000 copies/ml observed in very young children. These studies were multicentric, 
mainly performed in Africa especially for the younger children. 
From PRINCE I to PRINCE II, significant changes occurred that were addressed through specific 
amendments: 
Assessment report  
EMA/340991/2016  
Page 95/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Based on PK analysis from PRINCE I, the dose to be tested in very young children from 5-10 kg 
was adjusted after the PRINCE II started, from 150/80 mg ATV/RTV dose to 200/80 mg dose. 
Overall, only 10 patients in the 5-10 kg strata received the recommended dose.  
-  The to-be-marketed formulation with aspartame 4.2% was only introduced in PRINCE II but no 
children from 5-10 kg could receive it 
-  An additional age strata from 25-35 kg was lately introduced in the PRINCE II, with only 8 
patients being treated 
While in PRINCE I all patients have completed the 48 weeks visit, this is not the case for PRINCE II 
with 24 weeks visit being completed but 48 weeks not yet completed (only one patient achieved  week 
48 in the 5-10 kg weigh strata and 2 children from the 25 to 35 kg). 
Beneficial effects 
Reyataz (atazanavir), given together with ritonavir as a PK booster, in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products, is currently only indicated in HIV infected adults and children aged 6 
years and older either in first line or in treatment experienced patients but with restriction in terms of 
PI resistance (<4 PI mutations). 
A new formulation for extending the use of Reyataz in younger children from 3 months of age has been 
developed. This would be the first boosted Protease Inhibitor to be validated in such a young 
population. The new formulation intended to be marketed is an aspartame containing oral powder. The 
content of aspartame has been reduced over time from 10% to the 4.2% in the to-be marketed 
formulation. 
Atazanavir has pharmacokinetics that allow once daily dosing in adults and children ≥ 6 years old, 
which makes development of a formulation suitable for smaller children desirable as adherence could 
be expected to improve with such a regimen in this population.  
Limited clinical data indicate overall viral success rates which seem in a similar order of magnitude to 
those seen with other antiretroviral treatments in this population, albeit less favourable at the 50 c/ml 
level.  
Such a virological impact is observed while, as compared to other boosted PIs, this medicinal 
compound tends to have a lower potential to induce dyslipidemia.  
This medicinal product is a suitable formulation for paediatric use that could de added to the 
therapeutic armamentarium. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The clinical development of antiretrovirals in children focuses on the identification of the appropriate 
dose for children of all relevant age groups. The selected dose should achieve comparable exposures in 
children as those observed in adults, and it is expected that this will lead to a comparable efficacy and 
safety profile of the medicine.  
The dose selection was previously substantiated by a one compartment PPK model. The model was 
then revised to a two compartment model thanks to PK data derived from the PRINCE studies. During 
the procedure, the PPK model was further revised updated to include a modified maturation function 
for the characterization of the age-related impact of RTV co-administration on ATV apparent oral 
clearance (CLT/F), as well as a new maturation function describing the impact of age on ATV

bioavailability, resulting in an improvement in the characterization of the time-course of ATV 
concentrations in paediatric subjects. The final dosing recommendation for the oral powder and capsule 
formulation have been set as to take into account the PPKPOP, the need to minimize the gap between 
oral and capsule formulation and the need to minimize the deviation from the original capsule dosing 
recommendation. It is acknowledged that these dosing recommendations mainly rely on PPKPOP and 
clinical relevance. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Based on the clinical experience gained in adults, hyperbilirubinemia represents the most salient 
aspect of the safety profile of atazanavir. As in adults, hyperbilirubinemia accounts for a significant 
proportion of adverse events observed in children. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The paediatric safety database is not extensive, and in particular in the lowest weight group (5- 10 kg 
BW) receiving the higher (200 mg) dose, there is very little data available. Exposure time was short, 
and a disproportionately high proportion of subjects were discontinued from the study in this weight 
group, if mostly for AEs not considered treatment related.

Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The PPK model has been significantly improved from the original application, with updated PK data 
from the PRINCE studies as well as through the inclusion of additional covariates for notably covering 
modified maturation function for the characterization of the age-related impact of RTV co-
administration on ATV apparent oral clearance (CLT/F), as well as a new maturation function describing 
the impact of age on ATV bioavailability. This overall result in a good fit to data in all age groups. 
The final dosing recommendation for the oral powder and capsule formulation have been set as to take 
into account the PPKPOP, the need to minimize the gap between oral and capsule formulation and the 
need to minimize the deviation from the original capsule dosing recommendation. It is acknowledged 
that these dosing recommendations mainly rely on PPKPOP and clinical. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The CHMP considered the overall risk/benefit of REYATAZ in children weighing at least 5 kg is 
considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Reyataz co-administered with low dose ritonavir, is indicated in 
combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric 
patients at least 3 months of age and weighing at least 5 kg is favourable and therefore recommends 
the granting of the extension marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

Summary of Mode of Action: 
Futibatinib  is  a  kinase  inhibitor  that  irreversibly  inhibits 
FGFR 1-4 by covalent binding with IC50 values of less than 
4 nM.  Futibatinib  inhibits  FGFR  phosphorylation  and 
signalling  and  decreases  cell  viability  in  cells  expressing 
FGFR  genetic  alterations,  including  point  mutations, 
amplifications, and rearrangements/fusions.  
Futibatinib  exhibited  in  vitro  anti-proliferation  activity 
against  cancer  cell  lines  harbouring  acquired  FGFR2 
resistance  mutations  in  the  kinase  domain  (N549K/D/H, 
V564I/L, E565G, K659M).  
Futibatinib  demonstrated  anti-tumour  activity  in  mouse 
and rat xenograft models of human tumours with activating 
FGFR genetic alterations. FGFR2 rearrangements/fusions 
are  strong  oncogenic  drivers  and  are  the  most  common 
FGFR  alteration  occurring  in  10-16%  of  intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA).

and  Target 
Locally  Advanced  or  Metastatic  Cholangiocarcinoma  Harbouring  Fibroblast  Growth 
Factor Receptor 2 Gene Rearrangements, Including Gene Fusions 
CCA is an aggressive malignancy of the biliary system with poor overall prognosis and limited 
treatment options (Krook, 2020; Rizvi, 2017).  
CCAs are diverse epithelial tumours arising from the liver or large bile ducts with features of 
cholangiocyte  differentiation.  Anatomically,  CCA  is  classified  into  extrahepatic  and 
intrahepatic (i.e. iCCA) forms. The extrahepatic form is more common, accounting for 80% to 
90%  of  the  CCAs  (Blechacz,  2008).  Each  subtype  has  distinct  risk  factors,  molecular 
pathogenesis, therapeutic options, and prognosis (Banales, 2020; Rizvi, 2017). 
Symptoms of CCA are not usually apparent until the disease is at an advanced stage, and thus, 
most patients have incurable disease at diagnosis. Unresectable, locally advanced (stage III) or 
metastatic (stage IV) disease has a dismal prognosis (Krook, 2020; Rizvi, 2017) with the 5-year 
overall survival rates for patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease at 10% and 0%, 
respectively (Lamarca, 2014). 
Dysregulation  of  the  FGF/FGFR  signalling  pathway  has  been  associated  with  many 
developmental disorders and cancer, including CCA (Krook, 2020; Rizvi, 2017). The FGFR 
signalling  axis  has  been  well  characterised  for  its  role  in  proliferation,  differentiation, 
migration,  and  survival,  and  it  is  fundamental  to  embryonic  development,  regulation  of 
angiogenesis, and wound healing in adults (Turner, 2010). As such, the FGF/FGFR signalling 
axis play an important role in normal organ, vascular, and skeletal development. 
Incidence and Prevalence: 
CCAs  represent  the  second  most  common  malignancy  of  the  liver,  accounting  for 
approximately 15% of all primary liver cancers and approximately 3% of all gastrointestinal 
cancers (Banales, 2020). 
The  epidemiological  profile  of  CCA  and  its  subtypes  displays  significant  geographical 
variation, reflecting the exposure to different risk factors. Although in most countries CCA is a 
rare cancer (incidence less than 6 cases per 100,000 people), its incidence is exceptionally high 
in some countries and regions, including Chile, Bolivia, South Korea, and Northern Thailand 
(Banales, 2016; Banales, 2020).  
For example, the incidence of iCCA varies substantially worldwide with the highest known 
rates in the Northeast Thailand (more than 80 per 100,000 population). The Western world has 
lower rates of 1 to 2 per 100,000 population (Bridgewater, 2014; Buettner, 2017). The incidence 
in European countries is reported to range from less than 1 to 4 cases per 100,000 population 
(Banales, 2016; Banales, 2020).  
The incidence of iCCA has been rising worldwide. By contrast, the incidences of extrahepatic 
forms seem to be decreasing (Banales, 2016).

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
LYTGOBI (Futibatinib) 
The  incidence  of  iCCA  in  Europe  increased  over  the  past  decades  (1971-2009)  in  Austria, 
Germany, Italy, and United Kingdom (Banales, 2016), but not in Denmark (Bridgewater, 2014; 
Cardinale, 2018). This overall increase in the incidence has been to an extent linked to several 
emerging risk factors of the disease, including the rising prevalence of obesity (Banales, 2016). 
FGFR2 rearrangements (including fusions) occur in about 10% to 16% of patients with iCCA 
(Graham, 2014; Jain, 2018). 
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication – Age, Gender, Racial 
and/or Ethnic Origin and Risk Factors for the Disease: 
CCA  shows  a  considerable  geographic  variation  in  incidence  worldwide,  reflecting  the 
exposure to different risk factors. Although iCCA represents in most countries a rare type of 
cancer,  its  incidence  is  significantly  higher  in  some  countries  or  regions,  including  Chile, 
Bolivia, South Korea, and Northeast Thailand (Banales, 2016; Banales, 2020). 
In the Western world, the median age at presentation of CCA is more than 65 years, and it is 
only rarely diagnosed in patients below 40 years of age (except in patients with pre-existing 
primary sclerosing cholangitis). There is a slight male predominance for CCA (Blechacz, 2008). 
Baseline  demographics  of  CCA  patients  with  FGFR2  rearrangements  appear  to  differ  from 
those without, with a lower median age of 52 years than the reported median age of the overall 
CCA  population  (approximately  65 years)  and  a  female  preponderance  (13%  versus  4%) 
(Graham, 2014). 
−  Risk factors: 
Risk factors for the development of CCA are established (Banales, 2016; Banales, 2020; 
Bridgewater, 2014; Gupta, 2017; Ross, 2014), despite the fact that the majority of CCAs 
occur in the absence of an evident chronic liver disease or other risk factors (Banales, 2016; 
Blechacz, 2008). Known risk factors for CCA are only involved in approximately 20% of 
cases (Banales, 2020). 
− 
Infectious diseases (e.g. Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinesis infection [liver 
flukes], hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus-related liver disease).  
−  General  risk  factors  (e.g.  obesity  and  diabetes  mellitus  [i.e. metabolic  syndrome], 
− 
alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking). 
Inflammatory disease (e.g. primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatolithiasis, biliary tract 
stone disease, biliary-enteric anastomosis, and liver cirrhosis). 
−  Environmental  factors  (e.g. nitrosamine-contaminated  food,  asbestos,  dioxins,  vinyl 
chlorides, and thorotrast). 
−  Congenital  factors  (e.g. choledochal  cysts,  Caroli’s  disease,  and  congenital  hepatic 
fibrosis). 
Intrahepatic  CCA  occurs  more  frequently  than  the  extrahepatic  forms  in  patients  with 
chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis (Banales, 2016).

LYTGOBI (Futibatinib) 
Main Treatment Options: 
Surgery  with  complete  tumour  resection,  including  liver  transplantation  in  highly  selected 
cases, is the only curative therapy for CCA (Banales, 2020; Buettner, 2017). When the disease 
is unresectable, only palliative treatment is currently possible (Banales, 2020). 
In  patients  with  unresectable  tumours,  systemic  chemotherapy/targeted  therapy  can  be 
considered (Banales, 2020). 
−  Surgical resection: 
Approximately 25% up to 45% of the CCA patients have a resectable tumour at the time of 
diagnosis  (Banales,  2020;  Goldaracena,  2018).  Surgery  may  improve  both  survival  and 
quality of life, but comes with a substantial risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality 
(Buettner,  2017).  The  survival  rates  after  surgical  treatment  of  intrahepatic  as  well  as 
extrahepatic CCA have significantly improved, possibly reflecting a more careful patient 
selection, thereby achieving higher rates of negative margin resection (Blechacz, 2008). 
Survival  after  resection  mainly  depends  on  the  presence  of  tumour-negative  margins, 
absence  of  vascular  invasion  and  lymph  node  metastasis,  and  adequate  functional  liver 
remnant. Overall, 5‑year survival after resection has been reported in the range from 22% 
to 44% for iCCA (Banales, 2016). 
Adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine is recommended by the international guidelines 
for 6 months after surgical resection with curative intent in patients with iCCA (Banales, 
2020). 
−  Systemic therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapy): 
In  patients  presenting  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  disease,  systemic  chemotherapy 
remains the main palliative treatment modality (Banales, 2020). 
The first-line, standard-of-care treatment for patients with unresectable/metastatic disease 
is gemcitabine and cisplatin. Oxaliplatin may be substituted for cisplatin in the presence of 
renal function concerns (Valle, 2016). 
FOLFOX  combination  therapy  (folinic  acid,  5-fluorouracil,  and  oxaliplatin)  can  be 
recommended as second-line, standard-of-care chemotherapy (Banales, 2020).  
Pemigatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 
conditionally  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  second-line  treatment  of  adults  with  locally 
advanced or metastatic CCA with a FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement that have progressed 
after at least one prior line of systemic therapy.  
−  Liver transplant: 
Liver transplantation has been associated with rapid tumour recurrence and low survival 
(10-25%), and has historically not been recommended as treatment for unresectable CCA 
(Banales, 2016; Banales, 2020). 
Only  two  locations  of  CCA  have  been  identified  as  to  benefit  from  liver  transplant, 
including  perihilar  CCA  (a  subtype  of  extrahepatic  CCA)  and  ‘very  early’  iCCA 
Confidential 
Page 11 of 55 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
LYTGOBI (Futibatinib) 
(Goldaracena, 2018). In selected patients with an early-stage (I-II) perihilar CCA, the rate 
of recurrence-free survival after 5 years has been reported in the range from 65% to 68% 
after liver transplantation, following protocols using neoadjuvant therapy (Banales, 2016; 
Banales, 2020). Until recently, the presence of iCCA had been considered a contraindication 
for  liver  transplantation  due  to  historically  very  poor  results.  However,  an  international 
multicentre study showed a 5-year survival rate of 65% in patients with ‘very early’ iCCA 
(tumour  size <2 cm)  following liver transplantation  compared  to  45% in  the  ‘advanced’ 
group (tumour size >2 cm) (Sapisochin, 2016). 
−  Locoregional therapy: 
The  role  of  locoregional  therapies,  such  as  trans  arterial  chemoembolisation  and  trans 
arterial  radioembolisation,  has  increasingly  been  investigated  for  patients  with  CCA, 
showing some evidence of improved survival. Radiofrequency ablation seems to prolong 
the survival in inoperable CCA (Banales, 2016). 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the (Untreated) Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity: 
CCA is generally asymptomatic in early stages and the initial symptoms are often nonspecific 
and include abdominal pain, anorexia, and palpable abdominal mass lesions (Ross, 2014). Some 
patients present with painless jaundice (the most frequent clinical onset in extrahepatic CCA), 
when the tumour grows towards the biliary confluence (Banales, 2016; Banales, 2020; Buettner, 
2017).  
As  a  result,  most  patients  present  with  an  advanced  disease,  preventing  curative  treatment 
options. For the limited number of patients who do present with resectable disease, survival 
rates remain low mainly due to tumour recurrence (Krook, 2020). 
FGFR2 rearrangements (including fusions) occur in about 10% to 16% of patients with iCCA 
(Jain, 2018; Krook, 2020), and at a much lower incidence in patients with extrahepatic CCA 
(Arai, 2014; Jain, 2018). Additionally, retrospective studies indicate a longer survival of CCA 
patients  with  FGFR2  rearrangements,  suggesting  the  potential  utility  of  FGFR2  fusion 
identification as a prognostic marker (Graham, 2014; Jain, 2018). However, the natural history 
of CCA with FGFR alterations and its prognostic role is not yet fully characterised. 
The global mortality is estimated at 1-6 per 100,000 inhabitants per year (Banales, 2020). The 
median survival is less than 6 months for inoperable tumours and only 20% to 40% for patients 
who undergo surgery and achieve clear margins (Ross, 2014). The overall 5-year survival rate 
in patients eligible for surgery is reported to range from 30 to 35% (de Jong, 2011). The 5-year 
overall survival rates for patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease are 10% and 0%, 
respectively (Lamarca, 2014).

PART II: Module SII - Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification 
The  nonclinical  development  programme  for  futibatinib 
included  preliminary  dose 
range-finding,  repeat-dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity,  reproductive,  and  phototoxicity  studies  in 
mice, rats, and dogs, all using oral administration. 
The embryo-foetal toxicity of futibatinib was investigated in rats. Studies in rabbits were not 
performed as per the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)-S9 guideline.  
Carcinogenicity,  peri/postnatal  development  and  juvenile  toxicology  studies  were  not 
conducted in accordance with the ICH-S9 guideline. 
The full nonclinical development programme is described in the eCTD Module 2.4 (Nonclinical 
Overview). 
Table 1: Key Safety Findings from the Nonclinical Development Programme for Futibatinib 
Study Type 
Finding 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Hyperphosphatemia and ectopic 
mineralisation in various organs/tissues 
Increased inorganic phosphorus values in 
plasma and ectopic mineralisation in various 
organs and bone/cartilage lesions were the 
main toxicity finding in 3-week oral 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs 
(Studies 12CB24 and 12CB22, respectively). 
Increased inorganic phosphorus and calcium 
values in plasma and ectopic mineralisation in 
various organs and tissues, and bone/cartilage 
lesions were the main toxicity findings in 
4-week oral toxicity studies in rats and dogs 
(Studies B-7416 and B-7417, respectively). 
Except for the ectopic mineralisation, all these 
findings resolved during the recovery period 
in both rats and dogs. 
Results of the 13-week GLP toxicity study in 
rats and dogs (Studies B-8203 and B-8204, 
respectively) showed no new toxicological 
findings or exacerbation of known toxicities in 
comparison to the 4-week study. 
Reproductive and 
developmental toxicity 
Embryo-foetal toxicity and teratogenicity 
Futibatinib inhibited normal development of 
the rat embryo-foetus and resulted in 
embryo-foetal lethality (Study 18CC01). The 
dose of 10 mg/kg was lethal for 
embryos/foetuses.  
Futibatinib revealed teratogenic effects in rat 
embryo-foetus. The definitive visceral and 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Hyperphosphatemia is the most 
common adverse reaction 
observed in the clinical 
development programme for 
futibatinib, where a 
dose-dependent elevation in serum 
phosphate was seen.  
The increased inorganic 
phosphorus in plasma is likely to 
be a mechanism-based class effect 
of FGFR inhibition (Brown, 2005; 
Gattineni, 2009; Martin, 2012; 
Wöhrle, 2011) that has been 
shown to have an effect on 
mineral homeostasis, including 
calcium. Hyperphosphatemia is 
considered as an (non-important) 
identified risk of futibatinib (refer 
to PART II: Module SVII. 
Ectopic mineralisation in various 
organs is also attributable to 
FGFR inhibition-mediated mineral 
imbalance (Hierro, 2015). 
However, no significant serious 
adverse events or deaths attributed 
to the mineralisation of any organs 
(heart, aorta, kidney, and lungs) 
were identified and reported from 
clinical trials. 
Pregnant women were excluded 
from the clinical development 
programme for futibatinib and as 
such, the relevance of these 
findings to human use is unknown. 
However, embryotoxicity was 
reported in association with many 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(Abruzzese, 2014). Therefore,

embryo-foetal 
toxicity/teratogenicity represents 
an important potential risk of 
futibatinib (refer to PART II: 
Module SVII). 
The results of an in vitro 
mutagenicity study (Ames assay) 
and two in vivo genotoxicity 
studies (micronucleus test in rats 
and Comet assay in rats) suggest 
that the risk of genotoxicity in 
humans is low. 
The incidences of adverse events 
within the clinical development 
programme for futibatinib, 
involving cardiovascular, 
respiratory, and central nervous 
systems, were low. No significant 
risks were identified in 
cardiovascular 
(e.g. QT prolongation), 
respiratory, and central nervous 
systems.

skeletal abnormalities were observed at the 
doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg (Study 18CB09). 
Therefore, the NOAEL for embryo-foetal 
development was < 0.5 mg/kg. 
Futibatinib did not show a genotoxic potential 
in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests, 
including in vitro reverse mutation test and 
in vivo tests in the selected Salmonella 
typhimurium and Escherichia coli bacterial 
strains. However, futibatinib showed to have a 
potential for inducing chromosomal 
aberrations in vitro; however, a micronucleus 
test revealed that futibatinib did not show any 
clastogenic potential in vivo. 
Futibatinib suppressed the hERG current at 
concentrations of 10 µmol/L (4,185 ng/mL) or 
higher in vitro (Study 8215).  
The IC50 value for the hERG current of 
futibatinib was 7.42 µmol/L (3,105 ng/mL).  
There was no inhibition on the peak tail 
currents by futibatinib at a concentration of 
1 µmol/L.  
No cardiovascular effect was noted in an in 
vivo study using conscious dogs at doses up to 
the maximum tested dose of 10 mg/kg 
(Study 8214). Moreover, the IC50 value for the 
hERG current (i.e. 3,105 ng/mL) was more 
than 5-fold higher than the maximum plasma 
concentration of futibatinib observed at a 
severely toxic dose of 10 mg/kg (531 ng/mL) 
in a 4-week oral repeated dose toxicity study 
in dogs.  
Therefore, a risk of potential QT interval 
prolongation associated with arrhythmia was 
considered low. There were no effects seen in 
either the central nervous or respiratory 
system at up to 30 mg/kg (Studies 8212 and 
8213). Therefore, based on these nonclinical 
studies, no potential risks were identified for 
these systems.

The clinical data supporting the marketing authorisation application originated from 9 clinical 
studies  (2 studies  in  patients  with  cancer  and  7 clinical  pharmacology  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers). The integrated safety population (N=648) includes the following data sets (refer 
also to Figure 1): 
•  Safety Data Group 1 (SDG1; N=145):  
This group comprises patients with iCCA harbouring FGFR2 rearrangement and treated 
at a starting dose of 20 mg QD in Study TAS-120-101 (Phase 1 Expansion Part [N=42] 
and Phase 2 Part [N=103]). 
•  Safety Data Group 2 (SDG2; N=469):  
This  group  comprises  patients  with  all  solid  tumours,  at  any  dose  level  in  Study 
TAS-120-101 (Phase 1 Dose Escalation Part, Phase 1 Expansion Part, and Phase 2 Part) 
and Study 10059010 (Dose Escalation Part and Expansion Part). 
Additional outputs for SDG2 by dose and dosing regimen are provided for: 
−  Futibatinib 20 mg QD population (N=318)  
−  Futibatinib QD population (N=387) 
−  Futibatinib every other day (QOD) population (N=82)  
The futibatinib 20 mg QD population (N=318) comprises all patients with any tumour 
type who received a starting dose of 20 mg QD futibatinib and is included as supportive 
information.  
•  Safety Data Group 3 (SDG3; N=179):  
This  group  comprises  healthy  volunteers 
in  clinical  pharmacology  studies: 
TAS-120-102,  TAS-120-103,  TAS-120-104,  TAS-120-105,  TAS-120-106,

PART II: Module SIV - Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials 
SIV.1  Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development Programme 
The  main  exclusion  criteria  discussed  below  are  based  on  the  exclusion/inclusion  criteria 
established  for  the  Phase 1/2  pivotal  Study TAS-120-101  in  patients  with  advanced  solid 
tumours harbouring FGF/FGFR aberrations. 
Table 4: Important Exclusion Criteria from Pivotal Clinical Trials 
Criteria 
Reason for Exclusion 
History or current evidence of 
serious uncontrolled ventricular 
arrhythmias. 
Myocardial infarction, 
severe/unstable angina, 
symptomatic congestive heart 
failure (NYHA Class III or IV) 
within the previous 2 months; if 
> 2 months, cardiac function must 
be within normal limits and the 
patient must be free of cardiac-
related symptoms. 
QTcF > 470 ms on 
electrocardiogram conducted 
during Screening. 
Congenital long QT syndrome, or 
any known history of torsade de 
pointes, or family history of 
unexplained sudden death. 
AST and ALT ≥ 3.0 × ULN; if 
liver function abnormalities are 
due to underlying liver metastases, 
AST and ALT ≥ 5.0 × ULN 
Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN or 
≥ 3.0 × ULN for patients with 
Gilbert’s syndrome 
The potential for QT prolongation 
is a class effect of tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors but the clinical 
implications differ between 
individual agents. Cardiac toxicity 
is mainly seen with multitarget 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Porta-
Sanchez, 2017; Shah, 2015; Shah, 
2013). 
The nonclinical studies of 
futibatinib showed that a risk of 
potential QT interval prolongation 
associated with arrhythmia is 
considered low (refer to PART II: 
Module SII). 
The respective exclusion criteria 
were established as precautionary 
measures, limiting the number of 
at-risk patients who could 
potentially develop severe 
cardiovascular events. 
These exclusion criteria were 
established to minimise the 
potential confounding factors for 
evaluation of the efficacy, 
pharmacokinetics, and safety of 
futibatinib. 
Futibatinib is primarily 
metabolised in the liver. 
Is It Considered to Be Included 
as Missing Information? 
No 
−  Rationale:  
The clinical development 
programme showed low incidence 
of adverse events involving 
cardiovascular, respiratory, and 
central nervous systems. 
Based on the data collected from 
the overall development 
programme, the safety profile of 
futibatinib in patients excluded 
from the clinical development 
programme is not expected to 
differ from the general safety 
profile. 
No 
−  Rationale: 
Study TAS-120-108 included 
subject with mild, moderate, and 
severe hepatic impairment. Since 
the data pertinent to the use of 
futibatinib in patients with various 
degree of hepatic impairment has 
been provided during the initial 
marketing authorisation procedure, 
this topic is not considered 
missing information for the 
post-authorisation experience.

Table 4: Important Exclusion Criteria from Pivotal Clinical Trials 
Criteria 
Reason for Exclusion 
Creatinine clearance (calculated or 
measured value) ≤ 40 mL/min 
This exclusion criterion was 
established to minimise the 
potential confounding factors for 
evaluation of the efficacy, 
pharmacokinetics and safety of 
futibatinib. 
Pregnant or breastfeeding women 
These criteria represent standard 
ethical measures. 
Furthermore, the nonclinical 
programme showed embryo-foetal 
toxicity/teratogenicity of 
futibatinib in rats (refer to PART 
II: Module SII). 
Is It Considered to Be Included 
as Missing Information? 
No 
−  Rationale: 
The results of the mass balance 
study showed that only 6% of the 
administered single dose of 
[14C]-futibatinib 
(Study TAS-120-106) was 
recovered in urine, indicating it is 
a minor elimination pathway. 
Similarly, in patients with 
advanced solid tumours following 
a single dose of futibatinib, less 
than 0.1% of the dose was 
excreted in urine as an unchanged 
form (Studies TPU-TAS-120-101 
and 10059010).  
These results indicate that urinary 
excretion does not represent a 
significant mechanism of 
elimination for futibatinib and its 
metabolites, and therefore 
alterations in renal function are not 
expected to have any clinically 
significant impact on the 
pharmacokinetics of futibatinib. 
The safety profile of futibatinib is 
not expected to differ in patients 
with renal impairment. 
No 
−  Rationale: 
The effects of futibatinib on 
pregnancy are part of the 
important potential risk of 
embryo-foetal 
toxicity/teratogenicity and no 
missing information is applicable. 
There are no data regarding the 
secretion of futibatinib or its 
metabolites in human milk nor on 
their effects on the breastfed infant 
or on milk production. Because of 
the potential for adverse reactions 
in breastfed infants, breastfeeding 
should be discontinued during 
treatment with futibatinib and for 
1 week after the last administered 
dose.  
Considering the proposed target 
population, it is expected that 
futibatinib will not be used during

SIV.2  Limitations  to  Detect  Adverse  Reactions 
Programmes 
in  Clinical  Trial  Development 
CCA  is  a  rare  disease  and  as  such,  the  clinical  development  programme  for  futibatinib  is 
unlikely  to  detect  certain  types  of  adverse  reactions  such  as  infrequent  adverse  reactions. 
Furthermore, the programme is unlikely to detect adverse reactions with a long latency or those 
caused by prolonged or cumulative exposure.

Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP: 
−  Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, 
and for which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered 
by prescribers (e.g. actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member 
state where the product is authorised): 
Identified Risk: Hyperphosphataemia 
Hyperphosphataemia is a well-known on-target class effect of FGFR inhibitors, presumably 
linked to FGFR inhibition and its effect on phosphate homeostasis (Hierro, 2015; Wöhrle, 2011; 
Yanochko, 2013).  
The role of FGFRs in the transduction of renal FGF23/Klotho signalling was confirmed in vivo, 
providing evidence for their involvement in the maintenance of phosphate homeostasis. FGF23 
is a bone-derived mediator of phosphate homeostasis and loss of FGF23 function is associated 
with hyperphosphataemia. FGFR signalling in bone regulates Fgf23 transcription, ultimately 
leading to the modulation of systemic FGF23 protein levels (Wöhrle, 2011). 
Reversible increased phosphorus in plasma and irreversible ectopic mineralisation in various 
organs and tissues were the main adverse findings in the nonclinical programme for futibatinib 
(refer to PART II: Module SII). Hyperphosphatemia was the most common adverse event in 
the clinical development programme for futibatinib. 
the  SDG1 population  (N=145),  130 patients  (89.7%)  experienced  an  event  of 
In 
hyperphosphataemia,  of  which  40 patients  (27.6%)  experienced  at  least  one  Grade 3  event 
(defined as serum phosphate > 7 mg/dl irrespective of clinical symptoms) and there were no 
Grade 4  or  Grade 5  events.1 All  reported  events  were  assessed  as  treatment-related  by  the 
investigator.  Among  all  patients  in  the  SDG1 population,  121 patients  (83.4%)  received 
treatment with at least one phosphate binder for management of ≥Grade 1 event. Among the 
40 patients  with a  ≥Grade 3 event,  24 patients  (16.6%)  received treatment  with  a  phosphate 
binder and 16 patients (11.0%) received treatment with more than one phosphate binder. All 
1 The grading of hyperphosphatemia events did not use the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 but was conducted based on serum phosphate levels as specified in 
the corresponding study protocols and the ISS SAP. 
Grade 3  hyperphosphataemia  was  defined  by  serum  phosphate  levels  ≥ 7 mg/dl,  irrespective  of  any  clinical 
symptoms. 
Additionally, as an exploratory analysis, hyperphosphataemia toxicity grading based on CTCAE v5.0 was derived 
using the criteria summarized in the ISS SAP. Summaries of maximum post-baseline CTCAE grades using these 
criteria for hyperphosphatemia laboratory results are presented in ISS Table 14.3.3.8.1 and ISS Table 14.3.3.8.2 
for patients in the SDG1 and SDG2 populations, respectively.

events  resolved  in  both  groups  (i.e. patients  treated  with  a  phosphate  binder  versus  patients 
treated with >1 phosphate binder), with a median time to resolution to <Grade 3 of 7 days. Time 
to  resolution  to  <Grade 2  was  also  comparable  between  both groups  (median  of  8 days  and 
9 days,  respectively).  Time to  resolution  to  <Grade 1  was  shorter  for  patients  receiving  one 
phosphate binder (median of 8 days) than for patients receiving >1 phosphate binder (median 
of 15 days). 
the  SDG2 population  (N=469),  385 patients  (82.1%)  experienced  an  event  of 
In 
hyperphosphataemia,  including  280 patients  (88.1%)  who  received  20-mg QD  futibatinib 
(N=318).  All  events  in  the  total  SDG2  and  20-mg QD  populations  were  assessed  as 
treatment-related  by  the  investigator.  Among  patients  who  received  20-mg QD  futibatinib 
(N=318), 75 patients (23.6%) had a ≥Grade 3 event and no Grade 4 or Grade 5 events were 
reported.  Among  these  75 patients  with  a  ≥Grade  3  event,  44 patients  (13.8%)  received 
treatment with a phosphate binder and 28 patients (8.8%) received treatment with more than 
one phosphate binder. Median time to resolution to <Grade 3 was 7 days and median time to 
resolution to <Grade 2 was 8 days for patients receiving one or >1 phosphate binder. 
In the full SDG2 population (N=469), among the 88 patients (18.8%) with a ≥Grade 3 event, 
52 patients (11.1%) received treatment with a phosphate binder and 32 patients (6.8%) received 
treatment with more than one phosphate binder. Median time to resolution to <Grade 3 was 
7 days for patients receiving one or >1 phosphate binder. Similarly, median time to resolution 
to <Grade 2 was 8 days for both patient groups. 
Overall incidence rate trends were generally similar between SDG1 and SDG2 populations. 
The reported events were non-serious and manageable by standard phosphate lowering therapy, 
temporary  dose  interruptions  and/or  dose  reductions.  In  SDG1 population,  dose  reduction 
occurred in 26 patients (17.9%), of whose in 20 patients (13.8%) due to ≥Grade 3 event, and 
dose interruption in 27 patients (18.6%), of whose in 21 patients (14.5%) due to ≥Grade 3 event. 
In SDG2 population, dose reduction occurred in 41 patients (12.9%), of whose in 27 patients 
(8.5%)  due  to  ≥Grade 3  event,  and  dose  interruption  in  67  patients  (21.1%),  of  whose  in 
46 patients  (14.5%)  due  to  ≥Grade 3  event.  All  events  in  both  patient  safety  populations 
(i.e. SDG1 and SDG2) resolved and no patient discontinued study treatment due to the event of 
hyperphosphataemia. 
Unlike in animal models, soft tissue mineralisation/calcification was not observed in the clinical 
studies  with  futibatinib  or  pan-FGFR  inhibitors  (Hierro,  2015).  No  significant  undesirable 
clinical  outcomes  associated  with  hyperphosphatemia  were  observed  in  the  clinical 
development programme for futibatinib. 
Considering  the  routine  risk  minimisation  measures  in  place  for  this  risk  (i.e. monitoring  of 
phosphate  levels,  management  with  phosphate-lowering  therapy,  dose  modifications  in 
response  to  phosphate  levels),  representing  a  standard  clinical  practice  in  the  EU  for 
hyperphosphataemia, the well-established nature of hyperphosphataemia associated with FGFR 
inhibitors (Goyal, 2021) and the lack of clinically significant undesirable outcomes associated 
with hyperphosphataemia, this risk does not represent an important risk of futibatinib, requiring

monitored via routine pharmacovigilance. 
−  Risks  with  minimal  clinical  impact  on  patients  (in  relation  to  the  severity  of  the 
indication treated): 
Identified Risk: Nail Toxicities 
Nail toxicities are considered an off-target adverse events of FGFR inhibition and have been 
associated  with  the  treatment  with  FGFR  inhibitors,  especially  with  increased  duration  of 
treatment.  The  events  observed  include  onycholysis,  paronychia  or  less  frequent  nail 
discoloration,  nail  disorder,  nail  dystrophy,  nail  hypertrophy,  nail infection,  and  onychalgia 
(Goyal, 2021; Lacouture, 2021). 
Mild  to  moderate  nail  toxicity  was  observed  in  the  clinical  development  programme  for 
futibatinib. None of the reported events was assessed as serious. 
In the SDG1 population (N=145), 64 patients (44.1%) experienced an event of nail toxicity, 
all but 1 of which were assessed as treatment-related by the investigator. Only 2 patients (1.4%) 
experienced  Grade 3  event  of  nail  toxicity  (onychomadesis  and  paronychia  occurring  in 
1 patient [0.7%] each). There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 events. 
In the SDG2 population (N=469), 127 patients (27.1%) experienced an event of nail toxicity, 
the  majority  of  which  (123 patients;  26.2%)  were  assessed  as  treatment-related  by  the 
investigator. Among patients who received 20 mg futibatinib in the SDG2 population (N=318), 
94 patients (29.6%) experienced an event of nail toxicity. Most of these (91 patients; 28.6%) 
were assessed as treatment-related by the investigator. There were only 4 patients (1.3%) with 
a ≥Grade 3 event and no Grade 4 or Grade 5 events were reported.  
Overall incidence rate trends in the SDG2 population were generally similar to or lower than 
those described for the SDG1 population. 
Dose reductions and interruptions associated with nail toxicity were infrequent and only one 
patient (0.3%) discontinued study treatment due to the event of nail toxicity. No patient in the 
SDG1 population discontinued the treatment due to nail toxicity. 
Considering the nature of this risk in the context of the intended target population, this risk is 
not considered important and will continue to be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance.  
Identified Risk: Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysaesthesia Syndrome 
Palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (PPES)  often  presents  as  a  mild  to  moderate 
cutaneous  oedema,  erythema,  and  hyperkeratosis  with  FGFR  inhibitors  that  can  impact 
patients’ quality of life and can limit daily functioning and lead to a reduction of the duration 
and intensity of treatment or its discontinuation. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind 
these adverse events are not yet fully elucidated (Lacouture, 2021). 
In the SDG1 population (N=145), 33 patients (22.8%) experienced an event of PPES, all but 
1 of  which  were  assessed  as  treatment-related  by  the  investigator.  Eight  patients  (5.5%) 
experienced Grade 3 event and there were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 events.

20 mg futibatinib in the SDG2 population (N=318), 48 patients (15.1%) experienced an event 
of PPES and all but 1 of which were assessed as treatment-related by the investigator. There 
were 11 patients (3.5%) with a Grade 3 event and no Grade 4 or Grade 5 events were reported.

not considered important and will continue to be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance. 
Potential Risk: Gastrointestinal Toxicity (Diarrhoea, Nausea, Dry Mouth, Stomatitis, and 
Constipation) 
Various gastrointestinal adverse effects have been observed in association with FGFR inhibitors 
and their frequency depended on the selectivity of FGFR inhibitor (Mahipal, 2020). 
In 
the  SDG1 population  (N=145),  126 patients  (86.9%)  experienced  an  event  of 
gastrointestinal  disorder  and  31 of  these  patients  (21.4%)  experienced  ≥Grade 3  event.  The 
most  frequently  occurring  events  were  constipation  (37.2%),  diarrhoea  (33.8%),  dry  mouth 
(31.0%), and nausea (28.3%). 
Of  the  reported  events,  100 patients  (69.0%)  experienced  event assessed  as  related to  study 
treatment by the investigator. The most frequently occurring treatment-related events were dry 
mouth (27.6%), diarrhoea (25.5%), and stomatitis (22.1%). Additional treatment-related events 
that occurred in >15% of patients included constipation (15.9%) and nausea (15.2%). 
The nature and characteristics of the events in 382 patients (81.4%) who experienced an event 
of gastrointestinal disorder in the SDG2 population (N=469) and in 260 patients (81.8%) in 
the subpopulation who received 20-mg QD (N=318) was generally similar to that observed in 
the SDG1 population. 
Dose modifications and discontinuations were infrequent. Twenty-eight patients (19.3%) in the 
SDG1 population and 69 patients (14.7%) in the SDG2 population required dose modification 
in response to gastrointestinal events, including nausea, stomatitis, and vomiting. Three patients 
(2.1%)  in  the  SDG1 population  and  9 patients  (1.9%)  in  the  SDG2 population  discontinued 
treatment due to the gastrointestinal event. In the SDG1 population, 2 patients discontinued due 
to stomatitis and 1 patient each due to oesophageal ulcer, oesophagitis, and oral synaesthesia. 
In  the  SDG2 population,  2 patients  each  discontinued  treatment  due  to  diarrhoea,  nausea, 
stomatitis,  and  vomiting,  and  1 patient  each  due  to  duodenal  obstruction,  gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, oesophageal ulcer, oesophagitis, and oral synaesthesia.

Considering the nature of this risk in the context of the intended target population, this risk is 
not considered important and will continue to be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance.  
Potential Risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Mainly  asymptomatic  hepatic  enzyme  elevations  were  observed in  the  clinical  development 
programme for futibatinib. 
In the SDG1 population (N=145), 42 patients (29.0%) experienced an event of hepatotoxicity 
(Table 6), of which in 30 patients (20.7%) were assessed as treatment-related by the investigator 
(AST  increased  reported  in  28 patients  [19.3%],  ALT  increased  in  22 patients  [15.2%], and 
gamma-glutamyltransferase  increased  in  1 patient  [0.7%]).  Eighteen  patients  (12.4%) 
experienced at least one ≥Grade 3 event (assessed as treatment-related in 12 patients [8.3%]).

Dose modifications and discontinuations were infrequent. Dose reduction resulting from the 
event of hepatotoxicity was reported in 9 patients (6.2%) in the SDG1 population (in 7 patients 
[4.8%] due to ≥Grade 3 event) and 21 patients (6.6%) in the SDG2 population (in 16 patients

No patient discontinued study treatment due to any hepatic event. 
Overall,  the  majority  of  hepatic  adverse  events  were  Grade 1  and  Grade 2  in  severity  and 
resolved. No Grade 5 event was assessed as related to futibatinib. Hepatic adverse events in 
patients  treated  with  futibatinib  were  reversible  and  manageable  with  or  without  dose 
interruption and dose reduction. No event led to study treatment discontinuation. No events met 
the criteria for Hy’s law. 
Majority  of  reported  events  had  confounding  factors  for  the  hepatic  events,  including 
concomitant medications and underlying disease.

Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the 
Important Identified Risk(s): 
−  Serous Retinal Detachment 
Risk-Benefit  Impact:  Retinal  toxicities,  including  central  serous  retinopathy  and  serous 
retinal  detachment,  represent  class  effects  of  mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  (MEK) 
inhibitors (Francis, 2017; Urner-Bloch, 2016; Weber, 2016). FGFR acts upstream of the 
MEK kinase in the FGF-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and as such, 
FGFR  inhibition  leads  to  inhibition  of  the  MAPK  pathway  and  development  of  ocular 
toxicities (van der Noll, 2013). However, since FGFR inhibition has a much broader range

of  molecular  downstream  signalling  pathways  affected,  the  nature  of  retinal  toxicities 
associated with FGFR inhibitors may differ. 
Ocular toxicities were observed in clinical trials with various FGFR inhibitors (Alekseev, 
2021; Goyal, 2021; Morales-Barrera, 2020), including the clinical development programme 
for futibatinib where Grade 1 and Grade 2 events associated with retinal toxicities occurred 
in 6.2% of iCCA patients, none of which reporting serious event and all but one assessed as 
related  to  futibatinib.  All events  resolved  or  improved  with  dose  interruptions  and  dose 
reductions. Considering the limited information available for this risk and the lack of data 
on the long-term outcomes, this risk is considered important. 
Important Potential Risk(s): 
−  Embryo-Foetal Toxicity/Teratogenicity 
Risk-benefit impact: The FGFR signalling axis is fundamental for embryonic development 
and  the  nonclinical  studies  in  rats confirmed  the  futibatinib’s  potential  for embryofoetal 
toxicity. In the absence of comprehensive clinical data, the actual impact on pregnancy or 
foetal development is unknown, however, the impact on the benefit-risk of the product is 
significant, albeit acceptable in the intended target population.

Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks 
Important Identified Risk 1: Serous Retinal Detachment 
Potential Mechanism(s):  
FGFR  inhibition  leads  to  the  blockage  of  the  MAPK  pathway  and  adverse  ocular  events, 
including central serous retinopathy, are known class effects of inhibitors of MAPK pathways. 
Since FGFR inhibition has a much broader range of molecular downstream signalling pathways 
affected,  clinically  meaningful  differences  between  the  ocular  adverse  effects  of  FGFR 
inhibitors and MEK inhibitors are expected (Alekseev, 2021).

LYTGOBI (Futibatinib) 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:  
Retinal toxicities, including central serous retinopathy and serous retinal detachment, represent 
class effects of MEK inhibitors (Francis, 2017; Urner-Bloch, 2016; Weber, 2016). FGFR acts 
upstream of the MEK kinase in the FGF-MAPK pathway and as such, FGFR inhibition leads 
to inhibition of the MAPK pathway and development of ocular toxicities (van der Noll, 2013). 
Ocular toxicities were observed in clinical trials with various FGFR inhibitors (Alekseev, 2021; 
Goyal,  2021;  Morales-Barrera,  2020),  including  the  clinical  development  programme  for 
futibatinib where Grade 1 and Grade 2 events associated with retinal toxicities occurred in 6.2% 
of iCCA patients. 
Characterisation of the Risk: 
Frequency, Severity and Nature of the Risk (Including Reversibility and Long-Term 
Outcomes) 
During the conduct of the clinical development programme, there was no routine monitoring, 
to detect asymptomatic serous retinal detachment. Therefore, the incidence of asymptomatic 
serous retinal detachment with futibatinib is unknown. 
−  Safety Data Group 1 (N=145) 
Nine patients (6.2%) experienced the event associated with retinal toxicities2, all but one 
assessed as related to treatment by the investigator. All reported events were non-serious. 
The most commonly reported events regardless of causality were subretinal fluid (3 patients; 
2.1%)  and  chorioretinopathy  (2 patients;  1.4%). The  remaining  events  occurs  in a  single 
patient each. An overview of reported events in provided in Table 7.  
No ≥Grade 3 event associated with retinal toxicities was reported.  
Median time to onset of the event of any grade was 43.0 days. Three patients (2.1%) had 
≥Grade 2 events, all of which resolved to <Grade 2 with the median time to resolution to of 
25 days. All events resolved or improved with dose interruptions and dose reductions.  
Dose  reduction  occurred in  3 patients  (2.1%).  Dose  interruption  occurred in  in  3 patients 
(2.1%).  These  dose  modifications  concerned  Grade 2  events  of  chorioretinopathy, 
detachment  of  retinal  pigment  epithelium,  and  subretinal  fluid  (reported  1 patient  each 
[0.7%]). No patients discontinued study treatment due to the event of retinal toxicities.

Thirty-eight patients (8.1%) experienced the event associated with retinal toxicities, most of 
which  (36 patients;  7.7%)  were  assessed  as  treatment-related  by  the  investigator.  Only 
1 patient (0.2%) in the 20 mg group had a serious event of retinal detachment. This Grade 2 
event was assessed as related to study treatment by the investigator.

Among  patients  who  received  20 mg futibatinib  in  the  SDG2  population  (N=318), 
27 patients  (8.5%)  experienced  the  event  of  retinal  toxicity.  Most  of  these  events 
(25 patients;  7.9%)  were  assessed  as  treatment-related  by  the  investigator.  No  ≥Grade 3

Median  time  to  onset  of  the  event  of  any  grade among  patients  who  received  20 mg QD 
futibatinib was 40.0 days. Six patients (1.9%) had ≥Grade 2 events, all of which resolved to 
<Grade 2 with the median time to resolution to of 23 days. All events resolved or improved 
with dose interruptions and dose reductions.  
Dose  reduction  occurred  in  5 patients  (1.6%).  Dose  interruption  occurred  in  4 patients 
(1.3%).  Dose  modifications  concerned  Grade 2  events  of  retinal  detachment  (3 patients 
[0.6%]), chorioretinopathy, detachment of retinal pigment epithelium, and subretinal fluid 
(1 patient each [0.2%]), and a Grade 1 event of retinal detachment (1 patient [0.2%]). 
One patient (0.3%) discontinued study treatment due to Grade 2 retinal detachment.

LYTGOBI (Futibatinib) 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Retinal  toxicities  such as  serous  retinal  detachment  can  cause  symptoms  such  as  blurred 
vision,  visual  floaters,  or  photopsia  that  are  generally  mild  (Goyal,  2021).  There  is  not 
enough experience with FGFR-related retinal toxicities; however, multifocal subretinal fluid 
in MEK retinopathy is typically transient and non-vision-threatening (Alekseev, 2021). 
Despite often being mild and non-serious, ocular adverse effects have an impact on daily life 
in affected patients. 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
The specific risk factors and risk groups have not yet been established for futibatinib. 
Preventability: 
No preventive measures have yet been established for futibatinib. Careful consideration should 
be  taken  with  patients  that  have  clinically  significant medical  eye  disorders,  such  as  retinal 
disorders, including but not limited to, central serous retinopathy, macular/retinal degeneration, 
diabetic retinopathy, and previous retinal detachment. 
Ophthalmological  examination  should  be  performed  prior  to  initiation  of  therapy,  6 weeks 
thereafter,  and  urgently  at  any  time  for  visual  symptoms.  For  serous  retinal  detachment 
reactions, the following dose modification guidelines should be followed: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If an asymptomatic serous retinal detachment occurs that is stable on serial examination, 
futibatinib should be continued at current dose. Monitoring described above should be 
performed. 
If a moderate decrease in visual acuity occurs (defined as best corrected visual acuity 
20/40  or  better  or  ≤ 3 lines  of  decreased  vision  from  baseline), limiting  instrumental 
activities of daily living, futibatinib should be withheld until resolution. If improved on 
subsequent examination, futibatinib should be resumed at the next lower dose level. If 
it recurs, symptoms persist or examination does not improve, permanent discontinuation 
of futibatinib should be considered based on the clinical status. 
If  a  marked  decrease  in  visual  acuity  occurs  (defined as  best corrected  visual acuity 
worse than 20/40 or > 3 lines decreased vision from baseline up to 20/200), limiting 
activities of daily living, futibatinib should be withheld until resolution. If improved on 
subsequent examination, futibatinib may be resumed at 2 dose levels lower. If it recurs, 
symptoms  persist  or  examination  does  not  improve,  permanent  discontinuation  of 
futibatinib should be considered, based on clinical status. 
If a visual acuity worse than 20/200 occurs in affected eye, limiting activities of daily 
living,  futibatinib  should  be  withheld  until  resolution.  If  improved  on  subsequent 
examination, futibatinib may be resumed at 2 dose levels lower. If it recurs, symptoms 
persist or examination does not improve, permanent discontinuation of futibatinib. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
Ocular toxicities were observed in clinical trials with various FGFR inhibitors (Alekseev, 2021; 
Goyal,  2021;  Morales-Barrera,  2020),  including  the  clinical  development  programme  for 
futibatinib,  where  Grade 1  and  Grade 2  events  associated  with  retinal  toxicities  occurred  in

6.2% of iCCA patients, none of which reporting serious event and all but one assessed as related 
to  futibatinib.  All  events  resolved  or improved  with  dose  interruptions  and  dose  reductions. 
Considering the limited information available for this risk and the lack of data on the long-term 
outcomes, this risk is considered important. 
Public Health Impact: 
Not yet established for futibatinib. 
Important Potential Risk 1: Embryo-Foetal Toxicity/Teratogenicity 
Potential Mechanism(s):  
Teratogenic effects  of  futibatinib  are  potentially  a  consequence  of  its  mechanism  of action, 
causing  FGFR  inhibition  as  the  FGFR  signalling  axis  is  fundamental  for  embryonic 
development (Turner, 2010). 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:  
Teratogenicity may potentially be linked directly to the mechanism of futibatinib action since 
the  FGFR  signalling  axis  is  fundamental  for  embryonic  development  (Turner,  2010).  The 
nonclinical development programme showed reproductive toxicity associated with futibatinib 
in the rat, where visceral and skeletal abnormalities were observed (refer to PART II: Module 
SII).  
The clinical relevance of these findings is unclear since there is no experience with the use of 
futibatinib  during  pregnancy.  However,  embryotoxicity/teratogenicity  was  reported  in 
association with many tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Abruzzese, 2014), including FGFR inhibitors 
(e.g. erdafitinib). 
Characterisation of the Risk:  
Frequency, Severity and Nature of the Risk (Including Reversibility and Long-Term 
Outcomes) 
Not yet established for futibatinib. 
There were no cases of pregnancy reported from the clinical development programme for 
futibatinib. 
Impact on Quality of Life 
In general, teratogenic effects represent a significant complication of pregnancy with marked 
impact on both the mother and the foetus/child (Abruzzese, 2014). 
The  experience  with  tyrosine  kinase inhibitors-exposed  pregnancies,  which  completed to 
term,  showed  severe  malformations  in  the  newborns  leading  in  some  cases  to  premature 
death (Abruzzese, 2014).

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
LYTGOBI (Futibatinib) 
Risk Factors and Risk Groups: 
Any  women  of  childbearing  potential  who  receives  futibatinib  or  whose  partner  receives 
futibatinib are at risk of embryo-foetal toxicity associated with futibatinib. 
Preventability: 
Pregnant women should be advised of the potential risk to the foetus. Futibatinib should not be 
used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the women justifies the potential risk to 
the  foetus.  A  pregnancy  test  should  be  performed  before  treatment  initiation  to  exclude 
pregnancy.  
Women  of  childbearing  potential  should  be  advised  to  use  effective  contraception  during 
treatment with futibatinib and for 1 week after the last dose. Since the effect of futibatinib on 
the metabolism and efficacy of contraceptives has not been investigated, barrier methods should 
be applied as a second form of contraception, to avoid pregnancy. 
Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective 
contraception during treatment with futibatinib and for at least 1 week after the last dose. 
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product: 
The  FGFR  signalling  axis  is  fundamental  for  embryonic  development  and  the  nonclinical 
studies in rats confirmed the futibatinib’s potential for embryo-foetal toxicity. In the absence of 
comprehensive clinical data, the actual impact on pregnancy or foetal development is unknown, 
however, the impact on the benefit-risk of the product is significant, albeit acceptable in the 
intended target population.  
Public Health Impact: 
Not yet established for futibatinib.

PART VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary  of  risk  management  plan 
(futibatinib) 
for  Lytgobi 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Lytgobi. The RMP details important risks 
of  Lytgobi,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be obtained  about 
Lytgobi’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Lytgobi’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Lytgobi should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Lytgobi should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Lytgobi’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Lytgobi  is  authorised  for  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
cholangiocarcinoma  (CCA)  with  a  fibroblast  growth  factor  receptor  2  (FGFR2)  fusion  or 
rearrangement (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains futibatinib as the active substance and 
it is given by oral route of administration. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Lytgobi’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Lytgobi’s  EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Lytgobi, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Lytogobi’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
−  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
− 
−  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
−  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is  supplied to the patient  (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is  collected  continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Lytgobi is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Lytgobi are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken.  Important  risks  can  be

regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of 
a link with the use of Lytgobi. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of 
this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet 
and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be  collected  (e.g.  on  the  long-term  use  of  the 
medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Identified risk: Serous retinal detachment  
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
Retinal toxicities, including central  serous retinopathy 
and serous retinal detachment, represent class effects 
of  MEK  inhibitors  (Francis,  2017;  Urner-Bloch,  2016; 
Weber, 2016). FGFR acts upstream of the MEK kinase 
in the FGF-MAPK pathway and as such, FGFR inhibition 
leads  to 
inhibition  of  the  MAPK  pathway  and 
development of ocular toxicities (van der Noll, 2013). 
Ocular  toxicities  were  observed  in  clinical  trials  with 
various FGFR inhibitors (Alekseev, 2021; Goyal, 2021; 
Morales-Barrera,  2020), 
clinical 
development programme for futibatinib where Grade 1 
and  Grade 2  events  of  central  serous  retinopathy 
associated  with  retinal  toxicities  occurred  in  6.2%  of 
iCCA patients.

Potential risk: Embryo-foetal toxicity/teratogenicity 
Evidence  for  linking  the  risk  to  the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Teratogenicity seems directly linked to the mechanism 
of  futibatinib  action  since  FGFR  signalling  axis  is 
fundamental  for  embryonic  development  (Turner, 
2010).  The  nonclinical  development  programme 
showed reproductive toxicity associated with futibatinib 
in  the  rat,  where  visceral  and  skeletal  abnormalities 
were observed.  
The clinical relevance of these findings is unclear since 
there is no experience with the use of futibatinib during 
pregnancy.  However,  embryotoxicity/teratogenicity 
was reported in association with many tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (Abruzzese, 2014), including FGFR inhibitors 
(e.g. erdafitinib). 
Any  women  of  childbearing  potential  who  receives 
futibatinib or whose partner receives futibatinib are at 
risk  of  embryo-foetal 
toxicity  associated  with 
futibatinib.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Aliskiren is an anti-hypertensive agent, which acts by inhibiting the enzyme renin to block the 
conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, the precursor of angiotensin II. Aliskiren at once daily 
doses of 150 and 300 mg was approved in the EU on 21 June 2007, for use as monotherapy, or in 
combination with other anti-hypertensive agents, for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.  
On 20 November 2008, the new fixed combination aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide (Rasilez HCT), was 
approved in the EU for the treatment of essential hypertension in patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequately controlled on aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide used alone, and as substitution therapy in 
patients adequately controlled with aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, given concurrently, at the same 
dose level as in the combination.  
Based on preclinical data, it is known that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. A 
clinical study conducted independently by Tapaninen et al. explored the pharmacokinetic interaction  
between aliskiren and itraconazole (a P-gp inhibitor) in healthy volunteers. The results of this study 
show that the exposure of aliskiren is increased by itraconazole when both drugs are administered 
concomitantly.

This type II variation concerns an update of section 4.3 of the SPC to add a contraindication for the 
concomitant use of aliskiren and itraconazole, and section 4.5 of the SPC to add information regarding 
this interaction following the publication of a study in healthy subjects. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the annexes in line with the 
latest QRD template (version 7.3). 
This application was submitted for a Type II variation following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.

1.2.  Clinical aspects 
Interaction study in healthy volunteers 
Tapinen and co-workers performed a DDI study to investigate the effects of itraconazole on the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of aliskiren. In a randomized crossover study with 
2 phases and a washout period of 4 weeks, healthy volunteers took either 100 mg itraconazole (first 
dose 200 mg) or placebo orally twice daily for 5 days. On Day 3, following an overnight fast, they 
received their morning dose of itraconazole or placebo. One hour later, a single oral dose of 150 mg 
aliskiren was administered with 150 mL of water. Blood samples were blood samples for drug 
concentration measurements were drawn prior to and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 24, 34, 48, and 72 
hours after the administration of aliskiren. On Day 3, blood samples were also drawn (T = 0, 4 and 24 
hr post dose) for the determination of plasma renin activity. On Day 3, urine was collected up to 12 
hours to measure aliskiren. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were measured prior 
to and 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, and 24 hours after the administration of aliskiren. 
Time-courses of aliskiren plasma levels with or without itraconazole are shown in the following figure:

Aliskiren PK parameters with or without (placebo) itraconazole are shown in the following table: 
Itraconazole markedly increased aliskiren AUC and Cmax but did not change t1/2 or CL.  
The Cmax and AUC0-13 h of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole showed no significant correlation 
with the relative increase in the Cmax or AUC0-∞ of aliskiren.  
Plasma renin activity 24 hours after aliskiren intake was 68% lower during the itraconazole phase than 
during the placebo phase. No significant difference existed in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure or 
the heart rate between the itraconazole and placebo phases. 
The authors concluded that this interaction is probably mediated by inhibition of the P-gp-mediated 
efflux of aliskiren in the small intestine, with a possible, minor contribution from inhibition of CYP3A4. 
Considering that the reported change in aliskiren AUC induced by itraconazole in the presence of 150 
mg aliskiren is higher than that with cyclosporine, the MAH’s conclusion is that it is appropriate to 
consider itraconazole as a potent P-gp inhibitor and to advise against concomitant use in a similar 
manner to cyclosporine. 
Changes to the Product Information 
The following changes to the current aliskiren and aliskiren/Hctz product information are proposed by 
the MAH:

Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
The data from the study in healthy volunteers by Tapinen et al. further demonstrate that P-gp status 
has a very marked influence on the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren, thus justifying the precautionary 
approach to contraindicate concomitant use of aliskiren and potent P-gp inhibitors.  
The addition of a contraindication for the concomitant use of itraconazole is endorsed by the CHMP and 
the proposed changes to section 4.3 and 4.5 of the SPC can be agreed.  
The proposed changes to the annexes related to the implementation of the latest QRD template 
(version 7.3.1) are acceptable and the benefit/risk balance remains unchanged. 
2.  Conclusion 
On 23 September 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation following a worksharing procedure 
according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 to be acceptable and agreed on 
the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet (Attachment 1 - changes highlighted).

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Emend  (aprepitant)  is  an  oral  neurokinin  1  (NK-1)-receptor  antagonist.  Substance  P  (SP)  is  the 
dominating natural ligand to this receptor and belongs to the neuropeptide family of tachykinins. SP is 
abundantly and  widely distributed in the  mammalian CNS and  other tissues.  Mammalian tachykinin 
SP  that  binds  to  the  NK-1  receptor  has  been  associated  with  numerous  inflammatory  conditions, 
mediation  of  the emetic reflex and  modulation  of central  nervous  system  disorders. By blocking the 
NK-1 receptors, aprepitant prevents SP from interacting with the receptor and thus provides  a novel 
mechanism of action for the prevention of induced nausea and vomiting. 
On 12 November 2003, the European Commission issued a Marketing Authorisation valid throughout 
the  European  Union.  The  initial  approved  indication  was:  “Prevention  of  acute  and  delayed  nausea 
and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic  cisplatin-based  cancer  chemotherapy.  EMEND  is 
given as part of combination therapy”.  
In September 2004, the MAH submitted results from one pivotal study conducted in patients treated 
with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens in order to broaden the indication to encompass 
emetogenic chemotherapies in general. On 16 March 2005, the European Commission issued a 
Marketing Authorisation valid throughout the European Union. The currently approved indication is: 
“Prevention  of  acute  and  delayed  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  highly  emetogenic 
cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy.  
Prevention  of  nausea  and  vomiting  associated  with  moderately  emetogenic  cancer 
chemotherapy. 
EMEND is given as part of combination therapy (see section 4.2).” 
On 6 October 2005, the MAH submitted the present Type II variation requesting an extension of the 
indication for aprepitant to include the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in 
the 40 mg strengh. The application is based on data from two large, three-armed (aprepitant 125 mg, 
40 mg, or ondansetron) studies.  
This variation concerns an extension of the indication for aprepitant to include the prevention of post-
operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the 40 mg strengh. 
“EMEND is indicated for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting” 
This indication in based on data from two large, three armed, dose and active reference studies, which 
have been conducted by the MAH under the same protocol (one in US and one non-US site). The 
MAH has submitted in parallel with this type II variation, an  extension application (X/15) for Emend 
40 mg, which is intended to be used for PONV. The PONV indication only concerns the 40 mg 
strength.  
PONV constitutes an important remaining clinical issue despite availability of active therapies. 
Ondansetron and other 5-HT3 antagonists are considered to provide a better prophylaxis against 
emesis than nausea. To increase the activity, 5-HT3 antagonists may be administered in combination 
with dexamethasone or droperidol. 
Ondansetron may be administered prior to induction of anaesthesia or at end of surgery and the 
selected dose, 4 mg seems to be the most widely licensed, though a higher dose (8mg) is 
recommended in some EU Member States in patients with a history of PONV, etc. Some studies also 
indicate that the activity of ondansetron might be higher if administered at end of surgery, but this 
posology seems not to be licensed in most Member States.

II.      NON-CLINICAL ASPECTS 
In the present application, the dose is lowered to 40 mg, which is a dose that lowers the human 
exposure ~ 2.6-fold (AUC = 7751 ng.h/ml) compared to the previous 125 + 80 mg posology in 
Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV). The exposure margins to the clinically 
expected exposure are re-calculated to take the lower clinical exposure for this indication into account. 
III.  CLINICAL ASPECTS 
Pharmacokinetics 
The effect of a single dose of Emend 125 mg on iv midazolam (2 mg infused 1 h after Emend 
administration) was evaluated. Midazolam AUC increased with 47%, which is less than the effect on 
oral midazolam observed in previous studies (127% increase). In previous studies it has been shown 
that Emend 40 mg increased oral midazolam AUC by 22% and dexamethasone by 45%.  
Clinical Studies 
The clinical development of aprepitant for the PONV indication was based on two studies (Protocol 
090 and Protocol 091). These phase 3 trials were identical with respect to study design, study 
population, study treatments, efficacy and safety assessments, but differed in study hypotheses, and 
efficacy analyses. Therefore, efficacy data from the studies was presented separately, while safety data 
was combined.  
Additionally, the MAH submitted an interaction study evaluating the effect of a single dose of Emend 
125 mg on i.v. administered midazolam (P108). 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Procedures  
Both clinical studies, Protocol 091 and Protocol 090, were conducted according to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) guidelines and considerations for the ethical treatment of human subjects. Three 
investigative sites (Sites 0002 and 0029 in Protocol 091, and Site 0024 in Protocol 090) were 
identified as non-compliant with GCP requirements based on data review, routine monitoring, and/or 
site audits. Consequently, efficacy data from these study sites was not included in the primary mITT 
efficacy analyses, while safety data was included in all safety displays and analyses.  
Study 090 
Methods 
Study 090, which was conducted between 26-Sep-2003 and 24-Nov-2004, is a randomized, double-
blind, active comparator-controlled, parallel group study, which was designed to examine the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of 2 doses of aprepitant (125 mg, 40 mg) for the prevention of postoperative 
nausea and vomiting. This study was conducted in 29 centres across the USA. 
•  Inclusion criteria  
-  Patient scheduled to undergo open abdominal surgery requiring overnight hospital stay (24-hour 
hospital stay after end of surgery). 
-  Patient scheduled to receive general anaesthesia, with the following general anaesthetic regimen: 
• Premedication with benzodiazepine (e.g., IV midazolam 1 to 3 mg) or nil 
• Induction with any anaesthetic agent 
• Narcotics (e.g., fentanyl, morphine, or hydromorphone) 
• Neuromuscular blocking agents 
• Maintenance with N2O (50 to 70%) with volatile anaesthetic 
• Neostigmine 2 to 5 mg (A minimum dose of 2.5 mg was recommended.) 
-  Patient scheduled to receive postoperative opioids (e.g., morphine, or fentanyl) IM or IV, or patient 
controlled analgesia (PCA). 
-  Patient had an American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) physical status of I–III 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Exclusion criteria  
- Patient scheduled to receive propofol for maintenance of anaesthesia.  
- Placement of nasogastric or oral gastric tube intra- or postoperatively. 
- Patient expected to receive neuroaxial anaesthesia such as epidural, spinal, etc.  
- Patient expected to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or step-down unit after surgery. 
- Evidence of any clinically significant respiratory, metabolic, hepatic, renal dysfunction, or 
cardiovascular condition or congestive heart failure (CHF). 
- Patient had vomited within 24 hours prior to surgery. 
- Patient was taking, or had taken within 7 days of surgery the following CYP3A4 substrates: 
terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, mozidem.  
- Patient was taking, or had taken within 30 days of surgery the following CYP3A4 inducers: 
phenytoin or carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin or rifabutin 
- Patient was taking, or had taken within 7 days of surgery the following CYP3A4 inhibitors: 
clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole 
- Abnormal laboratory values: AST >2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT >2.5 x ULN, bilirubin 
>1.5 x ULN, creatinine >1.5 x ULN 
- Pregnancy or breast-feeding  
- Patient had taken an antiemetic within 24 hours before surgery, or was scheduled to receive an 
antiemetic during the study period 
Both, Protocol 090 and Protocol 091, were multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, active comparator-
controlled trials. Both trials included 3 arms (aprepitant 125 mg PO, aprepitant 40 mg PO, and 
ondansetron 4 mg IV, all three as a single dose). Aprepitant was administered orally 1 to 3 hours 
before the expected induction of anaesthesia. Ondansetron was administered intravenously 
immediately before induction of anaesthesia in accordance with prescribing information. 
Both studies, Protocol 091 and Protocol 090, had the same original primary efficacy hypothesis that 
aprepitant is superior to ondansetron with respect to Complete Response during the first 24 hours after 
surgery. The endpoint of Complete Response was selected because this was also the primary endpoint 
in the placebo-controlled, pivotal studies of the 5-HT3 antagonists that supported registration for 
PONV. 
•  Study medication  
Aprepitant Dose Selection and Timing of Administration: 
Both studies tested the 2 doses of aprepitant (125 mg and 40 mg) to permit assessing dose-dependent 
effects of aprepitant on the prevention of PONV. Data from the aprepitant CINV program had 
previously demonstrated a similar dose response between these 2 doses. Hence, these studies 
suggested that doses greater than 125 mg would not provide an additional benefit, while doses lower 
than 40 mg would not be sufficient to demonstrate a clinical beneficial. Since there were no other 
clinical studies conducted on the dose effect of aprepitant for the prevention of PONV, a similar dose 
range as applied for CINV was investigated.  
The recommended time point of administration of aprepitant is within3 hours prior to induction of 
anaesthesia. This recommendation is consistent with previously accepted recommendations for oral 5-
HT3 antagonists for prevention of PONV even when in the pivotal clinical trials the drug was 
administered at a fixed time in relation to surgery. The relatively long time interval was proposed in 
order to limit the number of patients excluded from the trial after administration of aprepitant due to 
changes in surgery start time 
•  Comparator Selection 
Ondansetron, selected as active comparator was administered intravenously in both, Protocol 091 and 
Protocol 090. Presently, ondansetron is the standard of care and the most commonly used agent for 
prevention of PONV. In earlier well-controlled studies, prophylaxis with ondansetron was associated 
with approximately a 20 to 30% absolute reduction in the incidence of PONV compared with placebo.

•  Treatments 
- Single oral administration of aprepitant (125 mg or 40 mg) 1 to 3 hours prior to induction of     
surgery.  
- Single IV administration of ondansetron (4 mg) immediately prior to induction of anaesthesia. 
Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (aprepitant 125 mg, 40 mg, or ondansetron) at 
each site using a stratified randomization schedule based on gender. Patients were treated with study 
medication only on Day 1 preoperative. Aprepitant (and placebo) capsules were supplied in 1 bottle 
(“Bottle A”), and ondansetron (or placebo) were dispensed in 1 vial (“Vial B”). Each patient received 
2 capsules (aprepitant and placebo, or 2 placebo capsules) and an IV (ondansetron or placebo) on the 
day of surgery. 
•  Objectives and Endpoints 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that aprepitant (125 mg, 40 mg) is superior to ondansetron 
in the prevention of PONV as measured by the proportion of patients with Complete Response in the 
24 hours following end of surgery. The primary endpoint was complete response, defined as no 
vomiting and no rescue medication given.  
The secondary objective was to demonstrate that aprepitant (125 mg, 40 mg) is superior to 
ondansetron in the prevention of PONV as measured by the proportion of patients with: 
1. No Vomiting (0 to 24 hours) 
2. No Rescue (0 to 24 hours) 
3. No Vomiting (0 to 48 hours) 
•  Definitions 
Vomiting was defined as one or more continuous vomits or retches/dry heaves. Episodes of vomiting 
were recorded by health care providers. Rescue therapy was offered to: (i) patients who requested it; 
(ii) patients who experienced more than 1 emetic episode; or (iii) patients who had nausea lasting for 
more than 15 minutes. No Rescue was defined as no use of rescue medications. Type of rescue therapy 
was not defined in the protocol. 
Nausea was assessed using the 11-point nausea verbal rating score (VRS). Zero (0) equals no nausea, 
and 10 equals nausea as bad as it could be. Nausea assessments were recorded by study personnel at 
prespecified times (2, 6, 24, and 48 hours postsurgery) and unscheduled times (prior to administration 
of rescue, and if the patient complained of nausea).  
Patients who did not vomit and did not take rescue medications were defined as patients with 
Complete Response. Efficacy assessments were recorded for 48 hours from end of surgery, but the 
time frame of primary interest was the first 24 hours after the end of surgery.  
•  Statistical methods  
All hypotheses were used at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 with the exception of the non-
inferiority and superiority hypothesis with regard to the Complete Response endpoint of Protocol 091, 
which was tested using respectively the lower bound of a one-sided 95% confidence interval and the 
upper bound one-sided significance level of 5%.  
A closed testing procedure was used to account for multiplicity related to the 2 primary hypotheses 
and a two-part hypothesis (non-inferiority followed by superiority) related to Complete Response in 
Protocol 091. A closed testing procedure was also used for the two treatment comparisons (aprepitant 
125 mg versus ondansetron, and aprepitant 40 mg versus ondansetron) in both studies 091 and 090.  
Comparisons between aprepitant (125 mg, 40 mg) and ondansetron were made using logistic 
regression that included factors for treatment, gender and study sites. A step-down procedure was used 
to account for multiple tests (2 doses compared to ondansetron) within the primary hypothesis.

The primary population used to assess efficacy was the mITT population, which included all patients 
who were randomized, took study drug, underwent surgery under general anaesthesia, and had at least 
1 post-treatment assessment. The patients were included in the treatment group to which they were 
randomized.  
The per-protocol (PP) population excluded patients who were identified as protocol violators 
(identified prior to unblinding of the study).  The definition of protocol violators included patients who 
did not receive N2O or postoperative opioids, patients who received propofol for maintenance of 
anaesthesia or neuroaxial anaesthesia, patients who received placement of nasogastric or oralgastric 
tube, patients who vomited within 24 hours prior to surgery and patients who took an antiemetic 
within 24 hour prior to surgery, or during the initial 24 hours after the end of surgery for emetic 
prophylaxis. 
Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for each of the treatment groups to describe the time to first 
vomiting (0-48 hours) in studies 091 and 090, the time to first vomiting or first use of rescue 
medication (0-24 hours) in study 091, and the time to first use of rescue medication to treat established 
nausea or vomiting (0-24 hours) in studies 091 and 090. A log-rank test was used for treatment 
comparisons.  
For the nausea analysis, an individual peak nausea score was calculated over the first 24 hours 
following the end of surgery. All scheduled and unscheduled nausea assessments over the first 24 
hours were included in this calculation. The single highest VRS score was used as the peak value. The 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used in comparing the treatment groups. 
Careful review of the outcome of study 090 led to the decision to revise the hypothesis structure, 
including the Data Analysis Plan (DAP) for study 091 prior to completion of this study and un-
blinding of the database. The revised protocol had two primary efficacy hypotheses. The first was that 
aprepitant is superior to ondansetron as measured by the proportion of patients with No Vomiting in 
the 24 hours following end of surgery. This endpoint was selected because previous PONV studies as 
well as Protocol 090 indicate that it is an objective and clinically relevant assessment in the surgical 
setting. The second primary efficacy hypothesis was that aprepitant is non-inferior to ondansetron as 
measured by the proportion of patients with Complete Response in the 24 hours following end of 
surgery. Based on published ondansetron - placebo comparative studies in women, the non-inferiority 
margin was set at an odds ratio of 0.65. The study had other exploratory objectives, such us, 
proportion of patients with “no rescue” 0 to 24 hours, distribution of peak nausea score 0 to 24 hours, 
time to first vomiting 0 to 48 hours, time to first vomiting or use of rescue 0 to 24 hours and time to 
first use of rescue 0 to 24 hours. 
Study 091 (Principle study) 
Study 091, conducted between 28-May-2004 and 20-April-2005, was a randomized, double-blind, 
active comparator-controlled, parallel group study, performed to examine the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of 2 Doses of aprepitant for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. This study 
was a multinational study with 42 sites.  
Methods 
•  Patient population 
A total of 922 patients from 16 countries worldwide including the US and the EU met the eligibility 
criteria at the screening visit and were enrolled in the study and randomized into 1 of 3 treatment 
groups (307 were in the aprepitant 40-mg group, 313 were in the aprepitant 125-mg group and 302 
were in the ondansetron group). A total of fifty-six patients were not included in either the safety or in 
the mITT efficacy analyses thereof 30 as they did not receive study drug, all of them due to 
discontinuation prior to scheduled administration of study drugs and this mainly due to change in 
planned surgery or anaesthesia.

•  Statistical plan 
See study 090 
Due to the outcome of study 090, the study protocol was revised 17 March 2005. The first step in the 
analysis was to show that aprepitant was superior to ondansetron with respect to “no vomiting”. If 
significantly better (p=0.05), the second step would be to show “non-inferiority” in terms of “complete 
control” (no vomiting, no use of rescue). Based on published ondansetron - placebo comparative 
studies in women, the non-inferiority margin was set at an odds ratio of 0.65. 
Primary objectives:  
(non-inferiority) 
“No vomiting” (superiority) and “complete control”, as defined in study 091 
Secondary objective:  
Exploratory objectives:  Proportion of patients with “no rescue” 0 to 24 hours. 
“No vomiting” for 48 hours (superiority) 
Distribution of peak nausea score 0 to 24 hours.  
Time to first vomiting 0 to 48 hours 
Time to first vomiting or use of rescue 0 to 24 hours 
Time to first use of rescue 0 to 24 hours 
Results for Studies Protocol 090 and 091 
•  Study population 
The study population of both protocols 091 and 090 consisted of patients receiving general anaesthesia 
(nitrous oxide, volatile anaesthetics and intra- and postoperative opioids) for open abdominal surgery 
requiring an overnight, post-surgery hospital stay. The majority of patients (~ 85%) were women 
undergoing gynaecological surgeries (81% and 92%, in Protocol 091 and 090, respectively). 
Populations were similar to those enrolled in previous pivotal PONV studies with 5-HT3 antagonist 
ondansetron.  
Specific exclusion criteria were ‘epidural anaesthesia’ and the use of a ‘nasogastric (NG)’, or oral-
gastric (OG) tubing. Surgeries requiring routine use of an NG/OG tube were not permitted in order to 
avoid any potential impairment of the absorption of orally administered aprepitant. Likewise, epidural 
anaesthesia was not allowed in order to ensure consistent exposure to postoperative opioids, an 
important risk factor for PONV.  
Based on the specific eligibility criteria, the majority of patients consisted of women undergoing 
gynaecological surgeries. In both studies, the most common category of surgery was hysterectomy 
plus salpingo-oophorectomy, and the specific types of surgery were generally similar across treatment 
groups.  
•  Sample Size  
The premeditated sample size for both studies was 720 patients, consisting of 240 patients per arm. 
Following revision of the primary hypotheses of Protocol 091, the sample size of study 091 was 
increased to 840 patients, with 280 patients per arm, to get an anticipated magnitude of statistical 
power of at least 80% of the two primary hypotheses.  
Initially Protocol 090 enrolled 805 patients in the US. In fact, the Modified Intent To Treat (MITT) 
population for all endpoints within the first 24 hours after surgery consisted of 866 patients (of 922 
randomized) for Protocol 091 and 733 patients (of 805 randomized) for Protocol 090. The MITT 
population for endpoints up to 48 hours after surgery consisted of 861 and 728 patients, respectively. 
Supportive per-protocol (PP) analyses were also conducted for the primary and secondary endpoints. 
•  Clinical Efficacy  
The great majority of randomized patients in both PONV studies completed the studies. The 
completion rate for all randomized patients was 96% in Protocol 091 and 93% in Protocol 090. The 
majority of patients who discontinued the study did so prior to receiving study drug, most commonly 
because the surgery was cancelled or rescheduled, the surgical or anaesthesia plans had changed, or

the patient became “ineligible” for the study. In Protocol 091, four dosed patients discontinued the 
study due to a clinical adverse experience.  
The US study (Protocol 090) failed to meet its primary objective to show superiority compared with 
ondansetron in terms of complete control of PONV (no emesis, no use of rescue, odds ratio about 1), 
but based on available data it is concluded that aprepitant is active in the prevention of PONV. The 
superiority objective, however, was met by the non-US study (091) (odds ratio 1.4). With respect to 
baseline characteristics, including type of surgery there are no obvious differences between studies.  
In protocol 090, aprepitant, although not meeting the statistical criteria for establishing superiority, 
was numerically better than ondansetron for Complete Response and was statistically not inferior 
based on a post hoc non-inferiority analysis during the first 24 hours after surgery. Aprepitant was also 
superior to ondansetron for the prevention and control of postoperative vomiting during the first 24 
hours (p<0.001) and 48 hours (p<0.001) after surgery.

A difference between both studies with regards to the use of rescue therapy was shown. Rescue 
therapy has been used more frequently across all study arms in the US study (Protocol 090), about 
55% vs. 35%, despite very similar nausea scores prior to administration of rescue. The percentage of 
patients without vomiting was also slightly higher in the US study, especially in the aprepitant groups. 
This might have been the effect of a more frequent use of rescue therapy in the US study. These data 
are also compatible with the seemingly better effect of rescue concerning vomiting in aprepitant-
pretreated patients.  
If study data are pooled the overall complete response rate in the aprepitant (40 mg) group 298/541 is 
slightly better than in the ondansetron group 258/526 (95% CI +12%; +0.0%).

A reasonable interpretation of the overall results would be that aprepitant is at least as effective as 
ondansetron for the prophylaxis of PONV. With regards to the dose, the 40 mg dose appears to be as 
effective as the 125 mg dose. 
An issue regarding section 5.1 of the SPC was identified. The MAH claims that aprepitant is superior 
to ondansetron in terms of its anti-emetic properties (and control of nausea). Following a request of 
CHMP in January 2006 the MAH addressed the issue of a potentially confounding effect by the use of 
rescue medication on the individual outcome measures (nausea and emesis). In order to provide 
further information possibly supporting claims related to superior effects as regards prevention of 
emesis, time to first emesis may be analysed censoring patients at time of rescue medication (studies 
091 and 090). Alternative ways to handle the confounding effects of rescue were requested from the 
MAH. The same analysis was also requested for nausea. The MAH agreed that, while the proportion 
of patients using rescue was similar between all treatment groups, the effectiveness of rescue 
medication theoretically may have varied depending on the randomized treatment received. The MAH 
performed three additional analyses: 
1.  The time to first vomiting or first rescue analysis incorporates patients who used rescue 
medication or had an emetic episode as treatment failures. 
2.  An analysis, which ignores the use of rescue medication in determining the time to first emetic 
episode. 
3.  An analysis in which the patient is censored at the time of rescue use.     
Protocol 091 
The time to first vomiting or first rescue analysis (1) was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier plot.

Table 3. Hazard Ratios and Reduction in Risk for No Vomiting Analyses, Protocol 091 
These three analyses show alternative ways to treat the use of rescue therapy: as an endpoint (=emetic 
episode), ignoring the use of rescue in the time to emesis analysis and censoring at the time of use of 
rescue. The results from all these analyses favour aprepitant. The outcome with respect to the protocol 
defined endpoint “percentage of patients without emesis” neglecting use of rescue is considered to be 
qualitatively supported by these analyses.  The estimated effect size according to the protocol analyses 
(odds ratio 2 – 3, p<0.001), however, should be interpreted with caution, nevertheless it is accepted to 
state that aprepitant provides better prevention against emesis than ondansetron.  
No analyses have been submitted supporting the claim with regards to superior control of nausea. No 
attempts were made by the MAH to support the claim in the originally submitted SPC that aprepitant, 
irrespective of use of rescue, provides better protection against nausea.   
The protocols were identical, but due to the non-superiority results of study 090, the analysis plan for 
study 091 has been revised. For the presentation of study data in 5.1, however, it was proposed that the 
results should be pooled and that results should be reported as “percentage of patients with complete 
response” (no use of rescue, no emesis), i.e. the original primary endpoint for both studies should be 
reported. It could be added that aprepitant offered a better prevention against emesis without further 
qualifications, as it is hard to define the optimal measure due to the confounding effect of use of 
rescue. The CHMP was of the opinion that the term nausea should be deleted from section 5.1.

With reference to the secondary and exploratory end points, rescue therapy was considered effective in 
the case of PONV. Both nausea and vomiting may trigger the use of rescue. A nausea score VRS>0 
was high enough to prompt the use of rescue if requested by the patient with consequent effects on 
vomiting and peak nausea. Similarly, early vomiting at a relatively low nausea score followed by 
administration of rescue may lead to a reduced peak nausea score. Provided that there is no major 
difference in the activity of rescue, the confounding effect of use of rescue should tend to reduce 
differences in terms of effects on the individual variables vomiting and nausea. In this study, however, 
rescue appears to be more active in the aprepitant arms resulting in “no vomiting”.  
If the possibly confounding effect of rescue is not accounted for, aprepitant appears to be more active 
against both emesis and nausea. Therefore, it is reassuring that there appears to be more patients with 
nausea score 0 in the aprepitant arms, i.e. an outcome measure unlikely to be confounded by use of 
rescue. It is notable that close to 50% of the patients reported a high nausea score (≥7/10) prior to the 
administration of rescue. The distribution of nausea scores prior to the administration of rescue was 
very similar to the distribution seen in study 090 despite less common use of rescue in study 091 
(about 35% vs. 55%) and despite a higher peak nausea score in study 090. The difference in use of 
rescue was established early and at 2 hours about 25% of the patients in the US study had received 
rescue versus about 15% in the non-US study.  
No vomiting (0-24 hours) 
Both studies demonstrated that aprepitant compared to ondansetron improved prevention of vomiting, 
and exhibited better anti-emetic control in the 24 hours following end of surgery, as indicated by the 
frequency of emetic events across treatment groups. In Protocol 091, on average, for each emetic 
episode recorded in each aprepitant group, there were about 2 episodes recorded in the ondansetron 
group. In Protocol 090, on average, for every emetic episode recorded in the aprepitant groups, there 
were at least 4 episodes recorded in the ondansetron group.  
Complete response (0-24 hours) 
The Complete Response aim comprises 2 separate hypotheses of non-inferiority and superiority.  
In Protocol 090, the primary hypothesis was that aprepitant is superior to ondansetron with respect to 
Complete Response. Although aprepitant gave numerically better Complete Response than 
ondansetron, the hypothesis was not met with statistical significant evidence.  
Post hoc analysis of data from Study 090 demonstrates that both doses of aprepitant were statistically 
non-inferior to ondansetron with respect to the proportions of patients with Complete Response in the 
24 hours following end of surgery (0.76 and 0.81 lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for 
aprepitant 40 mg versus ondansetron and aprepitant 125 mg versus ondansetron, respectively).  
In both protocols, per-protocol analyses of Complete Response (0 -24 hours) supported the primary 
analyses. Additional post hoc analyses for Complete Response were also conducted in both protocols 
using the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval as the decision rule for non-inferiority / 
superiority. Results of study 091 are sufficient to conclude that aprepitant has shown non-inferiority to 
ondansetron. Study 091 was considered confirmative for the hypotheses generated in study 090. 
No vomiting (0-48 hours) 
The results of the secondary endpoint of No Vomiting in the 48 hours following end of surgery in 
Protocol 091 are summarised in Table below. Results obtained in Protocol 091 were consistent with 
the results obtained in Protocol 090 and consistent with the Kaplan-Meier curves for the time to first 
emesis during the 48 hours following end of surgery for both studies.

Other efficacy endpoints  
No Rescue (0-24 hours) 
The percentages of patients with no use of rescue medication in the 24 hours following end of surgery 
were similar across treatment groups in both Protocol 091 and Protocol 090. However, the proportions 
of patients with No Rescue during the first 24 hours after surgery were higher in Protocol 091 (67%, 
65%, and 63% in the aprepitant 40 mg, aprepitant 125 mg and ondansetron group, respectively), 
compared with Protocol 090 (45%, 44%, and 46% in the aprepitant 40 mg, aprepitant 125 mg and 
ondansetron group, respectively). In Protocol 091 the peak nausea Verbal Rating Score (VRS) was 
lower with aprepitant 125 mg and 40 mg compared with ondansetron, while in Protocol 090 there 
were no significant differences in the distribution of peak nausea verbal rating scores between 
treatment groups. 
Time to First Emesis 
Kaplan-Meier curves for the time to first emesis during the 48 hours following end of surgery for 
Protocol 091 and Protocol 090 depict the cumulative percentage of patients who did not have emesis.  
Kaplan-Meyer estimates indicate that the proportions of patients who had a first vomiting episode 
within 2 hours following the end of surgery were more than double in the ondansetron group (9% and 
8% in Protocol 091 and protocol 090, respectively) compared to the aprepitant 40 mg (2% and 3% in 
Protocol 091 and Protocol 090, respectively), and the aprepitant 125 mg (4% and 2% in Protocol 091 
and Protocol 090, respectively) groups.  
Summary of Efficacy Results 
Results are consistent with those of previous preclinical studies and clinical data with NK1 
receptor antagonists other than aprepitant that had suggested that NK1 receptor antagonists 
would be more effective than 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in preventing PONV. Therefore, by 
virtue of its novel mechanism of action, aprepitant has demonstrated and increased efficacy in 
the prevention of PONV. This effect is considered important in medical practice.  
Clinical Safety 
•  Adverse events (AE) 
Aprepitant is licensed for the treatment of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting at a dose of 125 
(day 1) + 80 mg (Days 2 and 3). Overall aprepitant is well tolerated. In patients receiving cisplatin-
based chemotherapy the most commonly observed adverse reactions include: hiccups (5%), 
asthenia/fatigue (3%), ALT increased (3%), constipation (2%), headache (2%), anorexia (2%).

Out of 1727 randomized patients in the pooled PONV studies, 1120 patients received aprepitant and 
were included in the safety analysis. Both single doses of aprepitant were generally well tolerated. 
Clinical adverse experiences occurred in 60% of the patients in the aprepitant 40 mg group, and 64% 
of the patients in the aprepitant 125 mg group. Common clinical adverse experiences that occurred 
more frequently in the aprepitant 125 mg group compared with the aprepitant 40 mg group include: 
headache (5.0% in the aprepitant 40 mg group and 8.1% in the aprepitant 125 mg group), and 
tachycardia (0.7% in the aprepitant 40 mg group, and 2.0% in the aprepitant 125 mg group).  
One hundred forty two (142) of the 1658 randomized patients who received active study drug had one 
or more serious clinical adverse experiences. The most common criteria for the definition of ‘serious 
adverse events’ were hospitalisation and prolonged hospitalisation.

Table 5. Clinical Adverse Experience in Pooled PONV Studies with Protocols 090 and 091 
•  Serious adverse events and deaths 
There were three deaths, one in each of the treatment groups, none of these cases were reported to be 
drug related. The most common criteria for defining an AE as serious was hospitalization/prolonged 
hospitalization. 
The most common serious clinical adverse experiences were gastrointestinal disorders:  9 (1.6%) 
patients in the aprepitant 40-mg group, 15 (2.7%) patients in the aprepitant 125-mg group, and 14 
(2.6%) in the ondansetron group.  
Three serious adverse experiences were considered by the investigator as possibly related to study 
therapy (2 cases of constipation that required prolonged hospitalization and 1 case of development of 
subileus also required prolonged the hospitalization). The incidences of specific laboratory AEs were 
essentially similar between treatment groups. An increase in ALT levels e.g. was observed in 8/543 
(aprepitant 40mg), 7/528 (aprepitant 125mg) and 8/521 (ondansetron).   
Out of the 1658 randomized patients receiving study medications, two patients in the aprepitant 125 
mg group and one patient in the ondansetron group had one serious clinical adverse experience of 
special interest (hypoventilation, respiratory arrest). None of these serious events of special interest 
were considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drugs by the investigator. In the 
aprepitant 40 mg group, one patient developed respiratory depression, one patient had decreased 
respiratory rate, and one patient developed an over sedation. No formal analysis was conducted to 
assess the risk associated with administration of aprepitant 40 mg because a single 40 mg dose of 
aprepitant induces a weak inhibition of CYP3A4.  
13 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The incidence of specific laboratory adverse experiences was similar between the 3 treatment groups. 
The most frequent laboratory abnormality reported as laboratory adverse experience was a decrease in 
haemoglobin: 20 patients (3.8%) in the aprepitant 40-mg group, 28 patients (5.3%) in the aprepitant 
125-mg group, and 22 patients (4.2%) in the ondansetron group. Two patients who received study 
drug experienced a laboratory adverse experience that the investigator considered serious. The overall 
adverse event profile is similar to ondansetron. Administration of aprepitant 40 mg prior to induction 
of anaesthesia was well tolerated. 
The safety and tolerability of aprepitant in surgical patients was assessed in the combined safety 
database from both Study 091 and 090. Aprepitant (125 mg and 40 mg) was well tolerated when 
administered in the preoperative setting. The clinical and laboratory safety profile of aprepitant was 
similar to that of ondansetron and consistent with previous experience in cancer patients, as reflected 
in the current labelling. No new safety concerns have emerged in the PONV development program. 
Specifically, no definitive dose-dependent drug interaction concerns were identified, even though 
preoperative administration of aprepitant 125 mg may alter the metabolism of orally administered 
CYP3A4 substrates.  
The MAH was also requested to address the risk for pharmacodynamic interactions. The CHPM 
enquired if dose adjustments of anaesthetic agents were required in the aprepitant arm compatible with 
a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction. 
The receptor selectivity profile of aprepitant and its metabolites has been examined in a series of 
radioligand-binding assays at ion channels and receptors. These studies were conducted to characterize 
its NK1 receptor specificity and antagonist activity. Aprepitant had high affinity (IC50 0.1nM) and 
was highly selective for the G-protein coupled NK1 receptor. In contrast, the principal effects of 
general anaesthetics are thought to be mediated by ligand-gated (rather than voltage-gated) ion 
channels.  
Aprepitant was shown to be only a weak inhibitor of [3H] diltiazem binding to skeletal muscle L-type 
calcium channels (IC50 8000 nM) compared to diltiazem (IC50 370 nM). Therefore aprepitant had 
only a very weak in vitro functional effect on Ca2+ mediated contraction in guinea pig LM/MP 
preparation (Ka 5.5). The activity of aprepitant against acetyl cholinesterase and cyclooxygenase was 
not studied. These data suggest that a direct interaction between aprepitant and anaesthesia-related 
medications is unlikely. 
There have been no specifically designed experiments to address pharmacodynamic interactive effects 
between anaesthetic agents and aprepitant in humans. However, some data from the aprepitant PONV 
clinical program may be relevant. While intra-operative changes in anaesthetic doses were not 
measured, there were no reports of adverse experiences of intra-operative anaesthetic over-dose. The 
rate of recovery from anaesthesia serves as a surrogate marker for both pharmacodynamic and 
pharmacokinetics drug interactions. The awakening times and duration of recovery were similar in 
aprepitant and ondansetron groups. Serious adverse experiences related to excessive sedation were 
prescribed as being of special interest; in the 40 mg group, there was only 1 serious adverse experience 
adjudicated as excessive sedation. Finally, there was no clinically meaningful effect on other 
physiological parameters.  
CHMP  concluded  on  the  basis  of  these  data  that  an  interaction  on  receptor  levels  is  not  expected. 
Doses  of  anaesthetic  agents  were  not  specifically  monitored,  however,  there  were  no  reports  of 
adverse  experiences  of  intra-operative  anaesthetic  over-dose.  Time  to  awakening  and  duration  of 
recovery were followed according to the protocol.   
III.  DISCUSSION 
The  MAH  has  submitted  an  application  to  propose  aprepitant  for  the  prevention  of  PONV  as  an 
alternative  treatment  option.  Aprepitant  is  an  NK1  receptor  antagonist  that  blocks  the  emetic  reflex 
induced  by  substance  P,  which  is  a  novel  bio-mechanistic  approach  to  PONV.  Other  available  anti-
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
emetics antagonise one of the four neurotransmitter receptors implicated in the aetiology of nausea and 
vomiting:  serotonin  (5-HT3  receptor  antagonists),  dopamine  (butyrophenones,  benzamides, 
phenothiazines),  acetylcholine  (anticholinergics),  and  histamine  (antihistamines).  Ondansetron,  a  5-
HT3 receptor antagonist, is presently the standard of care for the prevention of PONV. 
The clinical development program consisted of two studies (studies 090/91) including more than 1500 
patients,  who  received  general  balanced  anaesthesia.  Study  090  did  not  meet  its  primary  objective. 
Additional post hoc analyses of this study generated hypotheses that were subject to confirmatory tests 
in study 091.   
Overall, the clinical effects of 2 doses of aprepitant (125 mg and 40 mg) were evaluated in more than 
1000 surgical patients, and compared with the efficacy provided by ondansetron IV. In both studies, 
the primary population used to assess efficacy was the mITT population, which included all patients 
who were randomized, took study drug, underwent surgery under general anaesthesia, and had at least 
1 post-treatment assessment. The rationale for using a mITT population for the primary analysis was 
based  on  ensuring  consistency  with  respect  to  the  emetogenic  stimulus,  similarly  to  the  approach 
followed in the aprepitant CINV studies.  
Study  091  demonstrated  that  aprepitant  was  not  inferior  to  ondansetron  with  respect  to  ‘Complete 
Response’ rate.  Even though the defined non-inferiority margin was questioned, the lower limit of the 
Confidence Interval was far above the defined non-inferiority margin.  
When administered as a single dose prior to surgery, the two doses of aprepitant had similar efficacy. 
In contrast, a pivotal CINV dose-range defining study observed maximal anti-emetic efficacy with the 
125  mg  regimen,  compared  to  sub-maximal  efficacy  observed  with  the  40-mg  dose  regimen.  The 
MAH  argues  that  different  dose-response  curves  observed  in  cancer  chemotherapy  patients  and  in 
surgical  patients  may  be  due  to  the  different  intensity  of  the  emetic  stimulus.  This  explanation  has 
been considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  recommended  dose  of  aprepitant  for  the  prevention  of  PONV  is  a  single  40  mg  dose  prior  to 
anaesthesia. In comparison to a higher dose of 125 mg, the lower 40 mg dose had similar anti-emetic 
and anti-nausea efficacy. However, the 40 mg dose may have a slightly better safety profile and it is 
likely to have a lower drug-interaction potential.  
Aprepitant 40 mg prior to induction of anaesthesia is considered  to be well tolerated, as the adverse 
event  profile  for  aprepitant  was  similar  to  ondansetron  and.  Nonetheless,  the  MAH  was  required  to 
provide additional information on older subjects. The MAH was requested to submit information on 
differentiated Awakening Time/Duration of Recovery/Excessive Sedation and Respiratory Depression 
for younger and older patients in Studies 090 and 091. The MAH is in agreement that physiological 
changes  associated  with  ageing  such  as  renal  and  hepatic  dysfunction  and  cognitive  decline  can 
complicate treatment options and pose a difficult challenge to surgeons due to higher incidences of co-
morbidity and poly-pharmacy. The MAH evaluated the following: 
•  Awakening time (time interval between the placement of the last suture and the patient’s 
ability to obey commands) was assessed every minute.   
•  The duration of recovery (time interval between the placement of the last suture and the 
patient’s achievement of the postanaesthesia recovery score ≥8 on a scale of 0 to 10) was 
assessed every 15 minutes.  
Other than a weak signal of prolonged awakening time in patients above 65 years of age treated with 
aprepitant 125mg, there are no signs of a dose – response relationship when comparing aprepitant 40 
and 125mg. In study 090 there were only 9 individuals over 65 and treated with aprepitant 125mg and 
mean awakening time was only 0.16 hours in this group.  The available limited data do not support the 
notion that there is an interaction between age, use of aprepitant and sedation.  
In  addition,  the  MAH  has  submitted  a  brief  overview  on  the  pharmacology  of  aprepitant  and 
anaesthesia-related  medications.  These  data  do  not  indicate  that  an  interaction  on  receptor  level  is 
expected.  
15 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The  adverse  event  profiles  were  dominated  by  events  expected  in  the  postoperative  setting  and  few 
events were regarded as drug related by the investigators. Dizziness, bradycardia and gastrointestinal 
events  were reported for  aprepitant and  are  labelled. No  new signals classified as  serious  or  general 
were  identified.  The  overall  adverse  event  profile  for  aprepitant  was  similar  to  ondansetron  and 
aprepitant 40 mg prior to induction of anaesthesia and was considered to be well tolerated. 
CONCLUSION 
It is concluded that aprepitant offers a positive benefit risk ratio in the "Prevention of post-operative 
nausea and vomiting (PONV)" and that the newly formulated strength of 40mg may offer advantages 
to the indicated population.

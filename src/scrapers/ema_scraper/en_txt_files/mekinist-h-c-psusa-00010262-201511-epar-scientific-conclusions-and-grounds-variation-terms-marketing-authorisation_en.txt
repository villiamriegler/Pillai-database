Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for trametinib, the 
scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Cumulatively, there are three reported cases of myocarditis in patients receiving 
trametinib in combination with dabrafenib. All three cases are reported as causally 
related to the trametinib/dabrafenib combination and were categorised as serious. 
One case was fatal and in the two non-fatal cases there was recovery after stopping 
the trametinib/dabrafenib combination. Based on the evidence presented the PRAC 
considered that causal relationship between myocarditis and the trametinib/dabrafenib 
combination is likely in each of the two non-fatal cases based on temporal 
relationship, positive de-challenge and the absence of compelling alternative causes.  
In addition, in the context of myocarditis being a potentially life-threatening event that 
can be misdiagnosed, the PRAC recommended that the existing warning on left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction/Left ventricular dysfunction should be 
updated to include specific reference to these cases of myocarditis in order to raise 
awareness of the possibility of this adverse reaction amongst prescribers, and 
highlight that stopping treatment resolved the myocarditis.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered 
that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing trametinib 
were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.  
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for trametinib the CHMP is of the opinion that 
the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing trametinib is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.  
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be 
varied.

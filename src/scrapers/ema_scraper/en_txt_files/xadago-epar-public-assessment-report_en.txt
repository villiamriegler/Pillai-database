2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder in which a progressive loss of nigrostriatal 
dopaminergic neurons leads to motor symptoms. In addition, several non-motor symptoms (e.g., fatigue, 
pain, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, constipation, and cognitive dysfunction) frequently occur 
prior to the occurrence of motor symptoms in PD, which may be due to dysregulation of other 
neurotransmitter systems in different brain areas. Glutamate and other neurotransmitters are believed to 
play important roles in the pathogenesis of primary symptoms, motor fluctuations, dyskinesias and 
possibly neuronal cell loss.  
The understanding that PD is a syndrome of dopamine deficiency led to the introduction to clinical practice 
of L-dopa, a precursor of dopamine that crosses the blood brain barrier use of dopamine agonists and 
MAO- inhibitors B, the major dopamine metabolizing enzyme in man. 
L-dopa is the most effective single therapy for PD. During the course of the disease motor fluctuations and 
dyskinesias occur. Whether this is related to long term L-dopa use, disease progression or both remains 
a matter of debate. In clinical practice, other dopaminergic treatments are used to reduce or delay the 
need for L-dopa therapy, or to improve the efficacy or moderate the side effects of L-dopa. E.g. dopamine 
agonists may be chosen in patients with a relatively early onset of PD (<60 years), to postpone the need 
for L-dopa. MAO-B inhibitors are use as monotherapy in early PD, or as adjunctive therapy to L-dopa, to 
improve motor functions. 
Safinamide has been developed by Newron Pharmaceuticals SpA as adjunct therapy for the treatment of 
subjects with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) as add-on to: 
• a single DA-agonist at a stable dose in early-stage non-fluctuating subjects and 
•  a  stable  dose  of  L-dopa  alone  or  in  combination  with  other  PD  medications  in  mid-  to  late-stage 
fluctuating subjects 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 50 or 100 mg of safinamide as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are: microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone type A, magnesium stearate, colloidal 
anhydrous silica , hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 6000, titanium dioxide (E171), iron oxide red (E172) 
and mica (E555). 
The product is available in PVC/PVDC/aluminium blister packs. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of safinamide is (+)-(S)-2-[[p-[(m-fluorobenzyl)oxy]benzyl]amino]propionamide 
monomethanesulfonate, and it has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 11/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure of safinamide was unambiguously confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, UV 
spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and single crystal 
X-ray diffraction. 
Safinamide is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic crystalline solid. It shows pH dependent solubility in 
aqueous buffers due to the secondary amine moiety, being soluble at acidic pH and practically insoluble 
at neutral pH. It is freely soluble in de-ionized water, methanol and DMSO but practically insoluble in 
non-polar organic solvents. 
Safinamide is chiral and possesses a single stereogenic centre. Three crystalline forms are known. The 
anhydrous form selected for commercialisation is the most thermodynamically stable form, whilst the 
others are either not physiologically relevant or have very similar dissolution profiles. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. Safinamide is synthesized in three main steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  The single chiral centre originates in a starting material and the minor 
enantiomer is controlled in its specification. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. Genotoxins used or generated in the process are controlled by the 
specifications of intermediates and are shown to be purged routinely by the manufacturing process. 
Heavy metals used in the process are purged and limited in the active substance specification. 
Polymorphic form and particle size distribution are controlled by the final crystallisation process. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are acceptable. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (IR, HPLC, 
precipitation test for methylsulfonate counter-ion), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
enantiomeric purity (HPLC), methanesulfonyl ester content (GC-MS), residual solvents (GC), heavy 
metals (in-house method), platinum (ICP-MS), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF) and 
particle size distribution (laser diffraction). The absence of a test for polymorphic form is justified given 
the similar solubility of the other relevant forms. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 12/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis data on 16 batches of the active substance manufactured at pilot to production scale and used for 
stability, validation, qualification and clinical studies are provided. The results are within the specifications 
and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on six commercial scale batches of safinamide manufactured using the proposed 
commercial process stored in the packaging chosen to simulate that planned for production for up to 48 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 
ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 12 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was also performed. 
Safinamide was also tested under stressed conditions including oxidation, heat, humidity, heat and 
humidity as well as high and low pH. The following parameters were tested: appearance, related 
substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and water content (KF). The analytical methods used were the same as 
for release and were stability indicating. 
During the formal stability studies, no significant changes to any of the measured parameters, other than 
a minor increase in water content in relation to the relative humidity, but all samples were still within 
specification. Hydrolysis was observed at high pH (13) and some degradation under strong oxidation 
conditions was observed. The active substance is not sensitive to light, heat, or aqueous solution up to pH 
10. The active substance deliquesces at high humidity but the long term data indicate that no specific 
storage condition is required. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
The applicant commits to the completion of all on-going stability studies under long term conditions up to 
the end of shelf-life. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Xadago is presented as orange, round, biconcave film-coated tablets embossed with “50” or “100” to 
distinguish the two strengths. 
Pharmaceutical development was carried out along Quality by Design (QbD) principles. The quality target 
product profile (QTPP) was defined as an orally-available, immediate release film-coated tablet in easily 
distinguishable 50 and 100 mg strengths. The finished product should have a unique appearance, contain 
the requisite amount of active substance, be stable over the intended shelf-life, have acceptable 
mechanical properties, and comply with pharmacopoeial requirements. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) 
were identified as appearance, mass uniformity, hardness, disintegration and dissolution.  
The active substance is highly soluble in acidic pH media but poorly soluble at pH 6.8 and is thus declared 
as BCS class II. The particle size of the active substance is therefore controlled in its specification to 
ensure a consistent dissolution profile. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Throughout the course of development, several iterations of dosage form were investigated from powder 
in bottle, to capsules, and finally to film-coated tablets. The manufacturing process and appearance of the 
tablets also changed over time. The process was successfully transferred to the proposed commercial 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 13/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
manufacturer. The switch from capsules to film-coated tablets was supported by in vitro dissolution data 
showing similar characteristics across the relevant pH range (1.2-6.8). The change in manufacturing 
process of the tablets was supported by a bioequivalence study. Further minor changes to formulation, 
appearance and manufacturing site were shown not to impact performance by comparison of dissolution 
profiles across the relevant pH range. 
A risk assessment was carried out by failure mode effects analysis (FMEA), based on prior knowledge of 
the process to identify potential critical steps impacting finished product CQAs. A series of multivariate 
experiments was carried out on potentially critical steps, resulting in a design space for the roller 
compaction step. On transfer to the proposed commercial manufacturing site however, it was no longer 
possible to remain within the identified operating ranges. Therefore, no design space or regulatory 
flexibility is claimed in the dossier. Nonetheless, the operating ranges declared in the dossier are 
well-justified. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated in relation to batches 
manufactured by varying CPPs. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PVDC/aluminium blister packs. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps including blending, granulation, compression and 
film-coating and is considered to be a standard process. Validation according to the validation scheme 
provided will be carried out before commercialisation. Despite the QbD principles applied during 
development, no design space or regulatory flexibility is claimed and the finished product is subject to 
final release testing. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for the production of 
Xadago film-coated tablets. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form and comprise tests for appearance (visual inspection), identification (HPLC, IR), assay (HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF) 
and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis results provided for one commercial scale and two pilot scale batches of each proposed 
strength confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. Batch analysis data on pilot and commercial scale batches of finished 
product, stored in different packaging, or made via old manufacturing processes, have been provided as 
supporting information. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on one production scale and two pilot scale batches of finished product of each strength 
from the proposed manufacturer stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 12 months, 
under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH and 30 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 12 months, and under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 6 months according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
In addition, stability data on six batches of finished product of each strength from a different 
manufacturer, but using essentially the same process stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 14/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for up to 48 months, under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH and 30 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 48 
months, and under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 6 months were provided as 
supporting data. The tablets were stored in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were 
tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution, water content and microbial limits. 
Three batches of each strength from the different manufacturer were also tested for enantiomeric purity 
(chiral HPLC) and sum of methanesulfonate esters (GC-MS). In addition, the same three batches of each 
strength from the proposed commercial manufacturer were tested for hardness, enantiomeric purity, 
disintegration, polymorphic form and sum of methanesulfonate esters. The batches in question were used 
for stability, validation, clinical studies and registration. 
No relevant change or trend to any of the measured parameters other than water content and assay was 
observed under the storage conditions investigated. Water content increases in relation to humidity, 
mainly during the first few months. Some variability in assay was observed for batches from the proposed 
commercial manufacturer, although no trend or evidence of degradation was detected. The applicant 
commits to investigate the source of this variability and update the dossier post-authorisation as 
required. 
One batch per strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No significant trends were observed which demonstrates that the 
finished product tablets are not susceptible to photo-degradation. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out on one batch of 50 mg tablets. Samples were exposed to light, 
heat, oxidant (H2O2), humidity, heat and humidity, and different pH levels (1, 7, 10, 13) in aqueous 
solution. Samples were tested for appearance, degradants, assay, enantiomeric purity, polymorphic form 
and where relevant, dissolution. Significant degradation was seen upon treatment with oxidant, at high 
pH, and at high heat and humidity. The product is resistant to racemization under all tested conditions. 
The analytical procedures were shown to be stability indicating. 
Bulk stability testing was carried out on one batch of each strength stored under long term conditions in 
PE bags inside HDPE drums for 12 months. No trends other than a slight increase in water content were 
observed, justifying the proposed bulk holding period of 12 months. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant should investigate variability of the finished product assay in batches manufactured at the 
proposed commercial manufacturing site and update the dossier as required. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Safinamide is an alpha-aminoamide derivative, structurally unrelated to any other drug for treatment of 
Parkinson’s disease.  
The pharmacology program was divided into two phases. Initially safinamide was identified as a novel 
state and use-dependent blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels for potential use as an antiepileptic 
agent. Studies were carried out in standard pre-clinical seizure models. Subsequently, its reversible and 
selective Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibition, and interaction with glutamate release were 
identified and this led to its evaluation as an anti-parkinsonian agent as reduction in dopaminergic striatal 
transmission and hyperactivity of the glutamatergic pathway in the basal ganglia are implicated in the 
progression of PD. Safinamide has shown efficacy in preclinical models of PD as discussed further in this 
document. 
Due to the inclusion of the MAO-B inhibition in the safinamide mechanisms, non-human primate models 
were preferred in the evaluation of PD-relevant pharmacology. In fact although some rodent models were 
employed in this phase, it was recognised that there are different neurochemical consequences of 
selective MAO-B inhibition in rodents compared to primates, since there is more widespread expression of 
MAO-A in the CNS of rodents than in humans and non-human primates. MAO-A can catalyse many of the 
same reactions as MAO-B but will not be inhibited by safinamide. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Dopaminergic effects:  
In vitro, safinamide showed approximately 5000 times higher selectivity for MAO-B than for MAO-A in rat 
brain homogenates and reversibly inhibited human platelet MAO-B with an IC50 of 9.3 nM (see Table 1 
below).  Differential sensitivity to inhibition was evident between brain and platelet MAO-B, however, with 
brain MAO-B IC50 values being almost 10 fold higher (i.e. less potent).

Table 1. In vitro MAO Inhibition in Rat and Human Tissues 
Safinamide is a reversible inhibitor of MAO-B as demonstrated in two sets of experiments using rat 
mitochondria.  MAO-B inhibition by safinamide was not time-dependent; there was no significant 
difference between the IC50 obtained with or without pre-incubation.  
Safinamide does not interact with enzymes involved in the levodopa metabolism AADC (aromatic 
L-amino-acid decarboxylase) and COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase), therefore it does not interfere 
with AADC and COMT inhibitors that are used in conjunction with levodopa to extend its duration of action 
and to provide benefits to PD patients suffering from motor fluctuations. 
Safinamide differs from MAO-B inhibitors currently used for PD therapy (selegiline and rasagiline) in its 
mode of inhibition (non-covalent and reversible for safinamide, as compared with covalent and 
irreversible for selegiline and rasagiline) and by its additional activity at non-MAO-B targets. 
In addition to MAO-B inhibition, drugs with pharmacological actions on several other molecular targets 
have been shown to enhance the efficacy of L-dopa on motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease and its 
animal models. To determine whether any of these targets might mediate safinamide’s dopaminergic 
effects in animal models (see below) a number of specific studies were performed. 
Stimulation of dopamine receptors types 1, 2 and/or 3 (D1, D2, D3) by dopamine agonists supplements 
the dopaminergic stimulation of neurons of the basal ganglia that is pathologically reduced in PD, and is 
the mechanism of action for several approved antiparkinsonian medications. Safinamide displayed no 
affinities for the different isoforms of D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5 dopamine receptor subtypes (-3% to 10% 
inhibition at 10 μM (study 0502001)).  
In vivo, administration of 80 mg/kg to rats did not affect striatal dopamine metabolism, consistent with 
evidence that MAO-A primarily metabolises dopamine. 
However dopaminergic effects of safinamide treatment on striatal neurochemistry have been 
demonstrated in primates, where dopamine is metabolised by MAO-B. Subchronic administration of 
safinamide (10-20 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks) produced an increase of dopamine levels in the striatum and 
a decrease of the DOPAC levels (dopamine metabolite). In parallel, MAO-B was significantly inhibited 
(study 0901003). Similar increase of dopamine levels in the striatum were measured after chronic 
treatment (8-20 mg/kg/day for 39 weeks, ES0714002). No changes in dopamine levels were found in the 
nucleus accumbens. The reason why nucleus accumbens dopamine levels were not affected was not 
discussed. The interaction with DA-releasing substances has not been addressed. 
Binding to the dopamine and serotonin transporters (DAT, SERT) was evaluated both in recombinant 
systems and naïve tissues, and functional studies were performed to measure the safinamide 
concentrations producing inhibition of the monoamine reuptake. Overall, the in vitro lowest 
concentrations affecting the monoamine transporter functions approximated 10 µM.  However an in vivo 
brain imaging study in baboons using the single positron emission computed tomography (SPECT) (study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 17/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TANDD_invivo_2011.013 (MNI-Safinamide-2 REV 01), demonstrated that no displacement at either DAT 
or SERT sites occurs even when plasma concentrations reached a Cmax of 22850 ng/ml, significantly 
above the mean total plasma concentration of 1234 ng/ml measured in PD patients taking safinamide 100 
mg/day dose. 
In vivo, behavioural effects expected to be due to central MAO-B inhibition have been observed in the 
MPTP-lesioned macaque monkey disease model.  
In Parkinson’s disease patients, years of daily L-dopa therapy coupled with progressing 
neurodegeneration leads to the state in which each administration of L-dopa can be followed by a period 
of uncontrolled involuntary movements, termed L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Attempts to manage 
this side effect usually include restriction of L-dopa usage, resulting in less effective control of the cardinal 
parkinsonian symptoms. The neurochemical changes underlying the dyskinetic state are not completely 
understood but altered glutamate and endogenous opioid signalling have been implicated. In a 
well-accepted preclinical model of LID, macaque monkeys are treated with individually tailored doses of 
the dopamine neuron-selective toxin MPTP to induce neuron loss comparable with that occurring in 
mid-late stage PD patients. After several months’ chronic treatment with L-dopa, a dyskinetic state is 
induced. (Jenner P. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 9, 665-677 (2008). 
Safinamide, given in a range of doses po from 3, to 30 mg/kg to L-dopa treated MPTP-lesioned 
parkinsonian macaque monkeys, produced a significant increase in the duration of the anti-parkinsonian 
efficacy of L-dopa and maintained the anti-parkinsonian and locomotor intensity of the L-dopa effect. The 
extension of the L-dopa effect was maximal at any dose and in all experimental settings (single dose and 
semi-chronic administration), suggesting that the high affinity target MAO-B is involved in mediating the 
pro-dopaminergic effects (study TANDD_invivo_2011.009; Gregoire L et al. Parkinsonism Relat Disord. 
2013 May;19(5) 508-14) (Figure 1below)).  
Figure 1 Effect of safinamide added to  L-dopa administered to MPTP monkeys as compared to L-dopa alone 
(pre and post safinamide) and vehicle 
In an independent experiment in the same model 20 mg/kg safinamide administered orally one hour 
before L-dopa extended the L-dopa induced ON-time by 40 min, without modifying the antiparkinsonian 
and locomotor intensity of the L-dopa effect. (Study TANDD_invivo_2011.010; Gregoire L et al. 
Parkinsonism Relat Disord. 2013 May;19(5) 508-14).

Another study showed that, when administered for a week at 10 mg/kg BID in combination with L-Dopa 
in MPTP monkeys, safinamide maintained the antiparkinsonian and locomotor intensity of the L-dopa 
effect and increased the duration of the antiparkinsonian effect of L-dopa by more than half an hour; all 
these effects were maintained during the one-week treatment. In addition, the L-dopa motor effect 
started earlier after administration of L-dopa on the 7th day of chronic safinamide, likely due to the 
accumulation of safinamide over the week of administration (study TANDD_invivo_2011.011 (work plan 
4); Gregoire L et al. Parkinsonism Relat Disord. 2013 May;19(5) 508-14).). 
Intraperitoneal safinamide (10-40 mg/kg, 30 min before MPTP injection) completely prevented 
MPTP-induced neurotoxic effects in MPTP-treated (40 mg/kg sc for 2 days) C57 BL mice.  Significant 
protection of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons was found even when the compound was 
administered 4 h after MPTP.  Safinamide (intraperitoneal 20 mg/kg) administered 15 days after MPTP 
significantly augmented (60% increase) the L-dopa induced elevation of striatal dopamine in mice.   
Non-Dopaminergic effects:  
In vitro, the properties of safinamide as a sodium (Na+) channel blocker were initially characterised in 
radioligand binding studies and in electrophysiology patch clamp studies performed in rat hippocampal 
and cortical neurons. Safinamide bound to voltage gated Na+ channels (NaV) from rat brain membranes, 
and inhibited Na+ currents in rat brain neurons, at low micromolar range and in a use-dependent manner, 
more potently than the anticonvulsants phenytoin and lamotrigine (study 970003; study 9750001; 
Salvati et al., J. Pharmac. Exp. Ther. 288:1151-1159, 1999). 
In a further study on cells expressing recombinant sodium channels subtypes Nav.x (Nav 1.1 to Nav 1.8) 
it was demonstrated that safinamide displayed only modest selectivity (<5 fold) across the NaV subtypes 
under physiologically relevant stimulation. There was however a clear state-dependent effect, with a 
substantial difference in potency between resting and inactivated channels: IC50 values were decreased 
to a range between 1.6 and 4.9 µM under depolarized condition, suggesting safinamide preferentially 
bound to the inactivated state of the sodium channel. Of these channels, Nav 1.1-1.3 and NaV 1.6 are 
highly expressed in the brain. 
Safinamide has been shown to inhibit calcium currents more potently than phenytoin and lamotrigine. 
This mechanism was theorised contribute to its non-dopaminergic and neuroprotective activity (study 
9750001; Salvati et al 1999). Binding studies showed a weaker affinity of safinamide for calcium channels 
(<25% binding at the single concentration 10 μM) respect to sodium channels (67% binding at the single 
concentration 10 μM) (study 8060252). The potency of safinamide to inhibit electrical field stimulation 
(EFS)-induced intracellular calcium mobilisation (an effect due to sodium channels) was higher than the 
potency to inhibit K+-induced calcium mobilisation (an effect due to calcium channels) (study 0604009). 
Glutamate is released in a calcium and sodium-dependent manner in response to nerve terminal 
depolarisation. In rat hippocampal synaptosomes safinamide inhibited the release of glutamate and GABA 
(gamma-aminobutyric acid) induced by high K+ (IC50 = 9.5 μM and 9.61 for the inhibition of glutamate 
and GABA release, respectively) (study 0203001-E).  
In in vivo microdialysis studies in rats, safinamide has been shown to decrease veratridine (sodium 
channel activator)-stimulated hippocampal glutamate release without affecting basal glutamate release. 
The active dose was 30 mg/kg i.p. that would produce a free plasma concentration of 0.6 µM. this 
concentration overlaps with the range of free plasma concentrations (0.26µM - 0.77µM) reached in PD 
patients taking 100 mg/day dose.  However, veratridine-induced glutamate release is an experimental 
condition not reflecting clinical practice and  rat brain/plasma ratios of safinamide concentrations exceed 
those of primates. It is therefore uncertain if therapeutic doses safinamide would lead to clinically relevant  
effects on glutamate release in PD patients.

In vivo, in a model of L-dopa induced dyskinesia (LID) in MPTP-lesioned macaque monkeys, safinamide 
treatment caused a significant dose-dependent reduction in dyskinesia scores, concomitant with the 
extension in duration of relief from primary parkinsonian symptoms. Monkeys in the LID studies showed 
plasma levels in the range of the plasma concentrations found in the rat at the effective dose producing 
inhibition of the glutamate release, however, brain-blood ratios in monkeys were lower than in rodents. 
In a similar model in cynomolgus monkeys, however, an antidyskinetic effect was not confirmed. 
“Wearing off” is a common treatment complication in PD, in which the duration of efficacy of a dose of 
L-dopa on motor symptoms is reduced, after a long period, usually years, of daily L-dopa therapy. In a 
model of this phenomenon in 6-OHDA unilaterally lesioned rats, rotations in response to a fixed dose of 
L-dopa are significantly reduced in number after 28 days of twice daily L-dopa administration. On day 29 
the number of rotations was increased significantly when L-dopa was co-administered with 20 mg/kg 
safinamide i.p., or with the reference inhibitor of NMDA-type glutamate receptors MK-801 at 0.1 mg/kg 
i.p., compared to vehicle (refer to study ES0610005). It was speculated that this increase may not be due 
to MAO-B inhibition but instead could be due to non-dopaminergic mechanisms including interference 
with glutamate signalling. 
The tremulous jaw movement model, is a rat model of parkinsonian tremor where repetitive vertical 
deflections of the lower jaw that resemble chewing, (but are not directed at a particular stimulus), can be 
pharmacologically induced by different agents such as DA antagonists, DA depletion, and cholinomimetics, 
and can be reversed by various antiparkinsonian drugs, including L-dopa, DA agonists, anticholinergics 
and adenosine A2A antagonists. Safinamide significantly reduced the number of tremulous jaw 
movements induced by galantamine, pilocarpine, and pimozide, with consistent effects across all three 
drugs at a dose range of 5.0–10.0 mg/kg i.p. Again, it was theorised that since MAO-B is not an important 
metabolic pathway for dopamine in the rat brain, it is likely that this effect on tremors may not be due to 
MAO-B inhibition but instead could be due to non-dopaminergic mechanisms including interference with 
glutamate signalling. 
2.3.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Efficacy has also been documented in several preclinical models of epilepsy. The maximal electroshock 
(MES) model is a validated pre-clinical test that is highly predictive of anticonvulsant activity, and has 
been demonstrated to identify drugs effective in the treatment of generalized seizures of the tonic–clonic 
(grand mal) type, that act by blocking sodium channels.  The ED50s of safinamide in the MES test after 
oral treatment were 8.0 mg/kg in mice and 11.8 mg/kg in rats (study 9650206). The correspondent 
pharmacodynamically available brain concentrations that produce the  anticonvulsant effect in the MES 
test are 2.5μM (mice) and 4μM (rats), that  overlap with the concentrations required to produce 
state-dependent blockade of the sodium channels in vitro. Yet, clinically, anticonvulsive activity of 
safinamide was not proven, as only open label studies comparing with baseline where provided. 
Exploratory studies 
In comparative in vitro studies with safinamide and its R-enantiomer on the MAO enzymatic activity 
(study 2003-66A; Strolin Benedetti et al., 1995), it was shown that The (R)-enantiomer was 
approximately 3-10 times less potent as MAO-B inhibitor (0.34 - 1.77 μM in the two studies, respectively) 
and 3-7 times more potent as MAO-A inhibitor (42 - 50 μM in the two studies, respectively) respect to 
safinamide. This was also demonstrated ex vivo 1 h after oral administration of 1,5,10 and 60 mg/kg 
doses.

A study was conducted to see if safinamide had an effect on slowing the retinal degeneration in the Royal 
College of Surgeon (RCS) rat strain. The efficacy of Safinamide was evaluated in the RCS rat to determine 
if it could slow the progression of the natural retinal degeneration. The potency / efficacy to prevent or 
slow down the retinal degeneration were assessed by measuring retinal DNA levels. Safinamide (15 or 30 
mg/kg ip) failed to prevent or slow the natural rate of retinal degeneration in RCS rats not exposed to a 
photic insult (study 1105005). 
Safinamide was investigated in the Tail Suspension Test in the mouse to evaluate its potential 
antidepressant activity. Safinamide 10, 40 and 100 mg/kg po, administered 60 minutes before the test, 
did not affect the duration of immobility as compared with vehicle control group, suggesting that it does 
not display anxiolytic-like or antidepressant-like activity (study 00803006 (03.243/2. 
2.3.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safinamide has been evaluated in several studies investigating central nervous, cardiovascular, 
respiratory, renal and gastrointestinal systems. Moreover, in vitro safety pharmacological investigations 
were conducted to investigate potential off-target effects of safinamide on various cell receptors, ion 
channels, transporters and enzymes. In addition to the safety pharmacological characterisation of 
safinamide, all 3 main human metabolites of safinamide and the R-enantiomer of safinamide (drug 
impurity) were also investigated in in vitro studies. 
Receptor Profiling 
In in vitro receptor profiling studies, possible effects of safinamide, its main human metabolites NW-1153, 
NW-1689 and NW-1689 AG, as well as its R-enantiomer (drug impurity), were investigated on up to 299 
potential human off-targets (studies 8920172, 8920174, 8920175, 8920177, 8920196, 8060252, 
8920254, 8920256, 8920286, 8920316, 8920326, 1205014). It was stated that if an off-target was 
affected to more than 50% of control binding at a final concentration of 10 μM a functional follow-up assay 
was performed to clarify whether receptor binding was translated into functional action.  
At 10 μM, safinamide inhibited the imidazoline 1 receptor (an anti-hypertensive target) by 73 %with no 
expected clinical relevance since the intended highest clinical dose is 22-fold below the test concentration 
used.  
The imidazoline 2 receptor, known as an allosteric binding site for the MAO-B, was inhibited by safinamide, 
and its main human metabolites NW-1153 and NW-1689 with IC50s of 0.72 μM, 0.8 to 1.4 μM or higher 
than 100 μM, respectively. The imidazoline 2 receptor may contribute to an inhibition of MAO-B and 
thereby to an increase in arterial blood pressure, but it has to be noted that there was absence of any 
effects on arterial blood pressure in conscious dogs and monkeys in the various safety pharmacological 
and toxicological studies. 
The muscarinic receptors, in particular M3 (IC50 = 0.25 μM), were also affected by safinamide. However, 
a follow-up functional study (study 8920196) revealed much lower potencies for M3- (EC50 > 10 μM) and 
M4- (EC50 > 30 μM) dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations than expected from the 
ligand binding data which represent a human safety margin of at least x22 and x66, respectively.  
Safinamide and its main human metabolite NW-1153 displaced specific ligand binding at sigma 1 and 2 
receptors and that is why the possible functional consequence of the safinamide binding to the sigma 1 
receptor was investigated by a guinea pig vas deferens bioassay (study 8920177). Safinaminde and its 
metabolites did not demonstrate an agonistic action in this model, but in contrast, an antagonistic action 
characterised by an inhibition of 14%, 41% and 74% was observed at 3, 10 or 30 μM safinamide, 
respectively. In one previous study in guinea pig vas deferens preparation safinamide had showed neither 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 21/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agonistic nor antagonistic effects on sigma non–selective receptors (study 0806010). Taken together 
according to the data it was concluded that neither safinamide nor its main metabolites NW-1153 and 
NW-1689 are likely to provoke pronounced adverse effects via sigma 1- and 2- receptors at the mean free 
peak plasma concentration of 0.4 μM safinamide in patients after administration of the intended highest 
clinical dose of 100 mg/day. 
Cardiovascular system (in vitro):   
Safinamide (1, 10, 100 μM) decreased hERG current in a dose-related and reversible manner with an IC50 
of 28.3 μM in GLP study 091104.NFS (x63 expected free plasma concentrations in humans administered 
the maximum proposed daily dose of 100 mg). In further studies, adequate safety margins were 
demonstrated for inhibition of ATP-dependent potassium channel Kir6.2/SUR2A (IC50 = 9.3 μM), the 
sodium channel Nav1.5 (phasic stimulation: IC50 = 34.1 μM, tonic stimulation: IC50 > 100 μM) and 
Kv4.3 (IC50 = 32.4 μM) by safinamide, and hence concluded to be of low clinical relevance. Results from 
three studies (study 1204014, study 100819.NFS and study 1204014) to investigate the potential 
inhibition of HCN4 (a pacemaker channel of the sinoatrial node), showed that it was unlikely that 
safinamide would inhibit the HCN4 ion channel at clinically relevant concentrations. 
In canine Purkinje fibres, the action potential duration (APD) was shortened dose-dependently by 
safinamide at 3 µM and above. APD shortening was dependent on the stimulation rate and was largest at 
a low stimulation rate (0.33 Hz). At 3 µM the APD was shortened by 32, 28 and 24% for APD50, APD70 
and APD90, respectively. At 30 µM these values were 89, 73 and 56%, respectively. In isolated guinea pig 
papillary muscles, the refractory period was reduced by -2.2 ± 0.8%, -7.5 ± 1.9%, and -18.8 ± 3.5%, at 
3, 10, and 30μM, respectively. The force of contraction was reduced by -15.7 ± 8.5%, -50.3 ± 5.3%, and 
-76.2 ± 2.6%, at 3, 10, and 30μM, respectively. 
At high concentration of 100 μM, a significant increase in ventricular conduction time and a prolongation 
of refractory period in rabbit ventricular strips, and a reduced spontaneous automaticity in rabbit right 
atria were observed. These effects were mostly reversible upon washout. (Study 7243-96-080) and at 
100μM considered to occur at concentrations far exceeding that expected in the clinic. 
Cardiovascular system (in vivo):  Safinamide showed no significant effect on mean arterial blood 
pressure in conscious and anesthetised rats administered oral doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg or 
intravenous bolus of 50 mg/kg safinamide (study 7243-97-016).  
The potential effect of safinamide on the neuronal uptake of noradrenaline or on adrenoreceptors (study 
2000-39) was investigated in the anesthetized rats. Safinamide had no effect on mean arterial blood 
pressure and did not affect the pressor response curve to noradrenaline. 
In conscious rats a study was conducted to investigate the potential for an interaction between safinamide 
and tyramine (study 2001-42). The selective MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline was used as a positive reference 
standard at an oral dose of 5 mg/kg. Safinamide, unlike clorgyline, did not influence the effect of tyramine 
on arterial blood pressure, suggesting that it does not interact with dietary tyramine and is unlikely to 
cause the “cheese effect” in patients. 
In conscious dogs after single oral administration, safinamide at 5 and 15 mg/kg did not cause any 
statistically significant effect on heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. At the dose of 50 mg/kg 
safinamide induced a very slight but significant increase in mean and diastolic arterial pressure and a 
decrease in QT interval duration at 1 h after treatment. In a second study in conscious dogs, the slight 
increase in heart rate at 50 mg/kg (p<0.05 vs. 0 min and vs. control) and a slight and dose-dependent 
decrease in QT interval of the ECG between 10 and 240 minutes (at 30 mg/kg: p<0.05 vs. 0 min; at 50 
mg/kg: p<0.05 vs.0 min and vs. control) was confirmed. However, no changes in arterial blood pressure,

respiratory rate, body temperature, saturation and blood parameters were observed. With regard to the 
high dose (50 mg/kg), total mean Cmax of the S-enantiomer safinamide in dogs was 7-fold above that in 
humans. The total mean Cmax values of the main metabolites NW-1153, NW-1689 and acyl glucuronide of 
NW-1689 in dogs were 19-, 32- or 6.7-fold, respectively, above the total mean Cmax values in healthy 
volunteers after single oral administration of 100 mg safinamide /subject/day. With respect to the 
R-enantiomer of safinamide, a safety margin of at least 150-fold can be determined. 
Safinamide caused mortality at high toxicological doses in cynomolgus monkeys (study 
9750238). In an exploratory safety pharmacological evaluation in anesthetized and conscious monkeys, 
intraduodenal administration up to 240 mg/kg did not show any effect on heart rate, arterial blood 
pressure, ventricular dP/dt, ECG parameters and respiration. Intravenous infusion resulted in 
hypotension, decrease in dP/dt, and death of the animals starting from cumulative total doses of 113 to 
171 mg/kg (corresponding to plasma concentrations of 37.3 - 57 µg/mL). Continuous intracisternal 
infusion of safinamide at total doses of 22.3 and 118.8 mg/animal had principally the same effects as the 
intravenous infusion but at much lower plasma concentration, i.e. 0.32 and 5.6 µg/mL, respectively. 
The Table 2 below summarises the results obtained in this cardiovascular study and compares the routes, 
respiration status, and plasma concentrations of safinamide.

had no pathophysiologically relevant effects on any of the parameters evaluated in a respiratory study in 
rats (study GSP0010RF).  
CNS: Irwin tests were conducted in mice (study 9750104 (858X) and rats (study 11.0016) and the 
rotarod test in mice (study 9650206) and rats (study n. 9650207). In rats, safinamide caused slight and 
dose-dependent sedative effects (decrease in activity and abdominal muscle tone) associated with 
mydriasis after oral treatment with 30 to 200 mg/kg. In general, these effects lasted up to 180 minutes 
after treatment.  
Possible effects of single oral doses of 10, 100 or 400 mg/kg safinamide on cognitive function were 
investigated in rats by using the passive avoidance procedure (study 9650207). Safinamide did not 
impair passive avoidance up to the highest tested dose of 400 mg/kg per oral.  
Renal function: Safinamide was given to conscious rats at single oral doses of 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg 
(study 9750236 (N856-Q1519)). No relevant effects were seen on renal function. 
Gastrointestinal Function: Safinamide was given to conscious mice at single oral doses of 30, 100 or 
300 mg/kg (study 9750274 (N859-Q1520)). No relevant effects on intestinal transit were seen.

2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Effects on Aromatic L-amino-acid Decarboxylase (AADC) and Catechol-O-methyltransferase 
(COMT) 
Safinamide, safinamide acid and N-dealkylated acid inhibited the rat brain AADC activity in the high µM 
range, with IC50s of 573, 94 and 97 µM, respectively. The rat liver AADC was not inhibited up to 600 µM. 
In the same  experimental conditions, carbidopa,  used  as reference  compound, inhibited the rat brain 
AADC activity with an IC50= 2 µM. (study 1205009). 
In vitro, safinamide did not inhibit COMT activity at concentrations up to 10 µM (study 0504005). 
The lack of pharmacodynamics drug interaction with COMT or AADC inhibitors was confirmed in vivo. 
When orally co-administered in rats, safinamide at 10 mg/kg with L-dopa (40 mg/kg) + carbidopa (10 
mg/kg), or with L-dopa (40 mg/kg) + carbidopa (10 mg/kg) + entecapone (10 mg/kg) did not affect the 
L-dopa metabolism, as shown by absence of an increase in plasma levels of L-dopa and its metabolite 
3-OMD (0405001(PR051740)) .  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
The pharmacokinetics of safinamide have been investigated  in vivo in rat and monkey and to a more 
limited extent in mouse, rabbit, dog and mini-pig. The kinetics of safinamide and its major metabolites 
(NW-1153, NW1689 and NW-1689 glucuronide) were  investigated  after IV and/or oral administration 
with  a  single  and/or  repeated  dose.  In  addition,  repeated  dose  studies  in  which  safinamide  was 
co-administered with other commonly prescribed Parkinson medications such as levodopa/carbidopa and 
pramipexole had been performed. 
Furthermore, in vitro studies investigating the absorption, plasma-protein binding, blood-to-plasma ratio, 
metabolism, transporters and potential drug interactions were performed with safinamide and in  some 
cases with metabolites of safinamide. 
2.3.3.1.  Methods of analysis 
HPLC methods 
A HPLC method with fluorescence detection was developed for the quantification of safinamide in mouse, 
rat, and monkey plasma (studies METPK 149/95; FCE26743S/101i; METPK 110/94; 9550130). Intra- and 
inter-assay accuracy and precision were within the validation criteria (≤15% and ≤20% at LLOQ).  
Exploratory mouse and monkey brain assays were developed in parallel with the plasma methods with a 
calibration curve of 20-4000 ng/g tissue, though these were not validated (studies METPK 149/95; METPK 
150/95). 
LC-MS/MS methods 
LC-MS/MS methods have been subsequently developed for the quantification of safinamide in plasma of 
mice, rat, rabbit and monkey to support non-clinical development.  
An  analytical  method  was  also  developed  for  the  analysis  of  safinamide  in  bile  and  urine  to  support 
non-clinical excretion studies with an LLOQ of 20 ng/mL in bile and 500 ng/mL in urine (study 98/01). 
Methods for quantification of safinamide, NW-1153 and NW-1689 were also developed in rat retinal tissue 
and fat to support toxicological investigations with LLOQs of 40 ng/g, 40 ng/g and 80 ng/g for safinamide, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 24/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NW-1153 and NW-1689 respectively (studies SOI0047 and SOI0051). Precision and accuracy were ≤15% 
for bile, urine, retinal tissue and fat tissue. 
Some of the developed LC-MS/MS methods for safinamide in rat, rabbit and monkey plasma have been 
additionally  validated  for  NW-1153  and  NW-1689  (studies  SOI0034;  P004/05;  P003/05;  0070/455; 
0070/457; 0070/456; 8200377; and 8224857) while separate LC-MS/MS methods for detection of the 
NW-1689 glucuronide in rat and monkey plasma were developed. Furthermore, an analytical method was 
developed for the analysis of NW-1199 in rat and monkey plasma (studies 0070/470 and 0070/471). The 
LLOQ was 1 ng/mL in rat and monkey plasma. Precision and accuracy were ≤15%. 
Analytical methods for co-medication 
Several HPLC methods were developed to quantify co-medications (levodopa/carbidopa and pramipexole) 
used in toxicokinetic studies with safinamide in rat, rabbit and monkey (studies 0070/470; 1000-0293; 
1004-071197;  1004-071199;  0070/471;  and  1004-071198).  Precision  and  accuracy  were  ≤15%. 
Storage stability and dilution integrity were shown. 
2.3.3.2.  Absorption 
The bioavailability after oral administration ranged from 33 to 92% in rats and does not seem to depend 
on the feeding status. The bioavailability was 76 to 95% in monkeys and 95% in humans. Clearance of 
safinamide was 1.7-2.8 L/h/kg in rat, but much lower in monkey (0.45 L/h/kg) and humans (0.077 
L/h/kg). The volume of distribution was larger than the water volume in rat, monkey and human, 
indicating wide tissue distribution. Gender differences were observed in mice and rat, but not in monkey. 
The half-life of safinamide is 1.2-2.1 hours in rat, 5.1-13 hours in monkey and 20-40 hours in humans. 
Furthermore, a half-life of 2.5 hours for NW 1153 and of 8.5 hours for NW-1689 was observed in rat. In 
monkey, a half-life of 11.4 hours for NW-1689 and of 10.5 hours for NW-1689 glucuronide was observed. 
Much longer radioactivity half-lives were observed (>77 hours). 
The exposure increases dose proportional in mice (100-375 mg/kg) and in monkey (7.6 to 70 mg/kg). In 
rat, the increases in Cmax and AUC were more than dose proportional from 5-150 mg/kg, but less than 
dose proportional at higher dosages. Metabolites NW-1153 and NW 1689 increase more than dose 
proportional compared to the administered safinamide dose in rat based on one study, but not in another 
study. Therefore, the results are inconclusive in rats. In monkey, the exposure to NW-1153 and NW 1689 
is dose proportional. 
After repeated dosing, safinamide accumulation occurred in rat up to 80 mg/kg while no change was 
observed at a dose of 125 and 200 mg/kg. Accumulation of safinamide was also observed in pregnant 
rabbits and monkeys. In addition, accumulation of NW-1153 and NW-1689 was observed after repeated 
dosing with safinamide in rat and monkey, but not for NW-1199. 
2.3.3.3.  Distribution 
Safinamide is moderately to highly bound to plasma proteins in mouse, rat, rabbit, mini-pig, dog, monkey 
and human, while metabolite NW-1153 is moderately bound and metabolite NW-1689 very highly bound 
(>99%). The plasma-protein binding is comparable across non-clinical species and humans, and 
concentration-independent. Safinamide and NW-1153 are more distributed to erythrocytes than to 
plasma in mouse, whereas they are approximately equally distributed between erythrocytes and plasma 
in rat, rabbit and dog. In monkey and human, safinamide and NW-1153 are mainly found in plasma. The 
metabolite NW-1689 is almost exclusively present in plasma in all species. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 25/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Drug-related radioactivity is widely distributed to tissues with highest concentrations were observed in 
the lachrymal gland, spleen, lung, salivary gland, epididymis, brown fat and tissues associated with 
absorption, metabolism and excretion of safinamide. Passage over the testis-blood barrier was observed. 
In addition, passage over the blood-brain barrier was observed with brain-to-plasma ratios ranged from 
4.5 in Cynomolgus monkeys to 20 in mice. Maximum brain concentrations occurred at 0.5 (mice) to 3 
(Cynomolgus monkeys) hours post-dose. Following repeated dosing, free concentrations of safinamide in 
rat brain corresponded roughly to free concentrations in plasma. Furthermore, reversible melanin binding 
was observed. Estimated terminal half-lives of total radioactivity are 34-40 hours in liver and lachrymal 
glands, ~50 hours in plasma, 51-59 hours in kidneys, 70 hours in adrenals, 65 hours in pigmented eyes 
and 91 hours in pigmented skin. Accumulation in these tissues is therefore possible after repeated 
once-daily dosing in humans. 
In vitro experiments indicate that safinamide is rapidly distributed to hepatocytes via passive diffusion 
and accumulates there due to lysosomal trapping. Lysosomal trapping is likely to occur in other cell types. 
2.3.3.4.  Metabolism 
Safinamide is extensively metabolised in the non-clinical species and humans. Several enzymes are 
involved in the biotransformation of safinamide, however not all enzymes involved were identified. The 
major route of biotransformation of safinamide to NW-1153 is via unspecified amidases. The company 
has shown that FAAH catalyses the formation of NW-1153 at extremely low rates. Therefore, significant 
contribution of other amidases to NW-1153 formation is likely and the applicant is requested to identify 
the major amidases involved in the NW-1153 formation. 
Thereafter, NW 1153 is further metabolised to Met-A and Met-X via an N-dealkylation by an unknown 
enzyme, which is followed by biotransformation to NW-1689. Safinamide is to a minor extent metabolised 
to NW-1199 via CYP enzymes. However, the enzymes involved were not identified. CYP3A4 and to a 
minor extent CYP2J2 and 2C19 are involved of the direct metabolism of safinamide to Met-A. Met-A is 
further metabolised by MAO-A to Met-X which is further metabolised to NW-1689 via ALDH2 and to a 
minor extent via ALDH7A1. NW-1689 is glucuronidated by UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A7, 1A9 and 2B15 to NW-1689 
glucuronide. NW 1199 is a minor human metabolite, therefore the Applicant is not warranted to 
investigate which CYPs are involved in the formation of NW-1199. As NW-1153 plasma levels are 
relatively low and NW-1153 is not expected to contribute significantly to the toxicity of safinamide, the 
enzyme(s) further metabolising this intermediate are considered to be of lesser importance and do not 
have to be elucidated. 
Considerable species differences exist in the metabolism of safinamide, with monkey being most 
comparable to humans. No unique human metabolites are formed. NW-1689 is generally the most 
important circulating component in plasma of all species.  
2.3.3.5.  Transporters 
Safinamide is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein. Based on preliminary data, safinamide is not a substrate 
for BCRP after it reaches the systemic circulation. However, it is unknown if safinamide is a substrate for 
BCRP in the intestine. In addition, safinamide is not a substrate for OATP1B1 and 1B3 after it reaches the 
systemic circulation, but it could be a substrate in the portal vein. Currently available data indicate that 
safinamide is not a substrate for OATP1A2 and 2B1, but the applicant was asked to provide the final study 
report of the in vitro substrate studies with  safinamide for BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3,  OATP1A2, and 
OATP2B1 when available.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 26/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NW-1153 is only a minor metabolite in plasma, but a major metabolite in urine (approximately 25%  of 
the recovered radioactivity in human urine). Drugs that are inhibitors of OAT3 given concomitantly with 
safinamide may reduce clearance of NW-1153, i.e., and thus may increase its systemic exposure. The 
systemic exposure of NW-1153 is low (1/10 of parent safinamide). This potential increase is of no clinical 
relevance as NW-1153, the first product in the metabolic pathway, is further transformed to secondary 
and tertiary metabolites.  No conclusions can be drawn for the transporters OAT1 and OCT2, since the 
investigated concentrations were higher than the Cmax,unbound. Final conclusions can be drawn when all 
data are submitted by the Applicant post-authorization. 
2.3.3.6.  Excretion 
In all non-clinical species except in dog, safinamide is mainly excreted as metabolites via renal excretion 
(~60-75%). Also in human, the majority of safinamide is excreted via renal excretion (~75%) and faecal 
excretion is almost absent. Faecal excretion is predominantly due to biliary excretion in rats. The 
metabolite profiles of the excreta cannot be used for interspecies comparison, as they are incomplete 
(due to a too short sampling period). 
The excretion of safinamide in milk has not been investigated. Mechanistic studies suggested that 
exposure to safinamide and/or its metabolites through the milk is the most likely cause for the observed 
neonatal hepatotoxicity. Further studies on excretion in milk are not warranted as the SPC states that 
safinamide should not be given to lactating women. 
2.3.3.7.  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Safinamide is not a CYP inhibitor at clinically relevant systemic concentrations (25 µM). It is an in vitro 
time dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, however in a clinical DDI study with caffeine, no clinically relevant 
DDIs were observed via CYP1A2 inhibition. No clinically relevant CYP inhibition was observed for NW-1153, 
NW-1689 and NW-1689 glucuronide. 
Safinamide and its metabolites are not CYP inducers in the non-clinical species. However, induction via 
PXR, CAR and AhR is species specific. In contrast, in humans safinamide and its metabolites may be an 
inducer of CYP3A4 at clinically relevant intestinal (99 µM) and portal vein concentrations (60 µM), but not 
at maximal systemic concentrations (25 µM). In addition, safinamide may be an inducer of CYP2B6 at 
clinically relevant portal vein concentrations. In a clinical DDI study, safinamide led to a 20% reduction in 
midazolam concentrations thus confirming that safinamide is a weak CYP3A4 inducer in humans. 
Safinamide and its metabolites NW-1153 and NW-1689 are not inhibitors of extracerebral levodopa 
decarboxylase, dopa decarboxylase and COMT. Safinamide, NW-1153, NW-1689 and NW-1689 
glucuronide are not ALDH inhibitors at clinically relevant systemic concentrations. 
Safinamide is an inhibitor of BCRP in the intestine, but not at systemic exposure. NW-1153 is only a minor 
metabolite in plasma, but a major metabolite in urine (approximately 25% of the recovered radioactivity 
in human urine). Therefore, information on the inhibition potential towards OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K 
was requested. The requested data were to be generated by an ongoing study (at the time of MAA), and 
were to be evaluated when the protocols would be presented as part of the recommended 
post-authorization measures. 
NW-1153 appears not to be an inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. However, conclusions can only be 
drawn when all data are submitted by the Applicant and it is clear how the experiments were performed 
(e.g. positive controls).

Several enzymes are involved in the biotransformation of safinamide (amidases, CYP3A4, MAO-A, ALDHs, 
UGTs and unidentified enzymes). Since, the extent of the involvement of each enzyme is not fully known, 
it is unknown if other drugs have a potential to lead to DDIs due to inhibition of enzymes involved in the 
metabolism of safinamide. In a clinical study, ketoconazole had no clinically relevant effect on safinamide 
and its metabolites when co-administered (see clinical assessment), indicating that the involvement of 
CYP3A4 in the biotransformation pathway is minor. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A large number of toxicology studies have been performed, probably reflecting the long period of 
development of the compound by different companies. Species differences among the non-clinical species 
and between the non-clinical species and humans are identified. Monkey is the most comparable species 
to humans for the metabolite profile. Between the rodent species, mice show a more similar metabolite 
profile to man than rats. In the assessment the focus was laid with those studies considered most 
relevant. 
It should be noted that safinamide contains a nitrogen atom that can be protonated and has a pKA of 7.4. 
Due to these characteristics it may accumulate in acidic cell compartments (Marceau et al., 2012), as was 
also suggested by a kinetic study with rat hepatocytes. 
CNS  
Adverse CNS effects, including tremors, abnormal coordination, clonic contractions and convulsions 
leading to death were seen at high doses in toxicity studies. Convulsions were encountered in monkeys 
(≥70 mg/kg/day, 39-wk), rabbits (50 mg/kg/day, embryo-foetal), rats (100 mg/kg/day, carcinogenicity) 
and mice (≥ 200 mg/kg/day, 4-wk & carcinogenicity). Various CNS signs (tremors, abnormal coordination 
etc.) were usually prodromal events to convulsions. These convulsions occurred at exposures that were 
greater than human exposure at 100 mg/day i.e. in monkeys x12.8 (AUC) and x16.8 (Cmax), in rabbits 
x3.2 (AUC) and x7.7 (Cmax), in rats x1.6 (AUC) and x3.9 (Cmax), and in mice x2.8 (AUC) and x4.9 
(Cmax). No mechanistic explanation was provided. Prolonged, high intracellular concentrations of 
safinamide/metabolites, eventually disrupting normal function could be a possible explanation. However, 
according to the Applicant, no pattern of treatment related seizures, seizure-like events or adverse CNS 
events has been reported in over 2000 PD patients, with over 900 subjects receiving safinamide 
treatment for 1 year or more. 
Biochemistry 
Reversible changes in some clinical chemistry parameters (i.e., increases in alkaline, phosphatase, ALT, 
urea, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides and decreased glucose, levels) were observed at doses as low 
as 30 mg/kg/day in rats and 50 mg/kg/day in monkey. At these dose levels, these changes were not 
associated with target organ toxicity, and may reflect some decrease in normal function of organs 
involved in metabolic homeostasis (liver, kidney, or endocrine tissues). 
Hepatotoxicity 
At higher dose levels, liver was a potential target organ in rats and mice but not in monkeys. At 4 weeks 
in rats, there was fatty change at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day, increased weight at ≥ 60 mg/kg/day, centrilobular 
hypertrophy and increased serum enzymes at ≥ 200 mg/kg/day. At 13 weeks, there was increased 
alkaline phosphatase at 80 mg/kg/day, increased liver weight was seen at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. There were 
no changes in the 26 week study (high dose, 45 mg/kg/day = NOAEL). In the 13-week 
pre-carcinogenicity studies, there was hypertrophy (rats and mice ≥ 100 mg/kg/day) and fatty change 
(mice 375/250 mg/kg/day). In the carcinogenicity studies, there was hypertrophy (rats & mice ≥ 50 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 28/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mg/kg/day) and vacuolation (mice ≥100 mg/kg/day). In rats, the safety ratios based on exposures at the 
animal NOAEL (45 mg/kg/day) and at the patient therapeutic dose (100 mg/day) were x1.3.  
Again no mechanistic explanation was provided, but chronic exposure and high intracellular 
concentrations of safinamide or metabolites could be a causative factor for the observed toxicity. 
Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug with strong lysosomotropic properties is associated with liver 
toxicity in humans (Schneider et al 1997). According to the Applicant, no systematic changes in liver 
function tests (LFTs) have been detected in over 2000 PD patients exposed to safinamide, of which 1100 
have been treated for >6 months, over 900 have been treated for 1 year or more and 300 subjects 
treated for 2 years or more. 
Immune system 
The presence of foamy macrophages was inconsistently noted in rats and with a lower incidence, in 
monkey studies. In rats minimal to moderate foamy macrophage infiltration was seen in repeat dose 
toxicity studies at doses of 60 mg/kg/day, while no effects were seen in 13- and 26-week toxicity studies 
at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day. Generally, foamy macrophages were limited to the lungs, although in a 
4-week toxicity study similar cells were seen in the thymus, liver, uterus and vagina. In monkeys, 
infiltration with foamy macrophages was seen in lymph nodes, thymus and spleen at doses of 80 and 120 
mg/kg/day in a 4-week repeat dose toxicity study. No effects were seen in subsequent monkey studies up 
to 39 weeks of duration at doses up to 70 mg/kg/day. In the second 26-week rat study, EM examinations 
showed that the alveolar macrophages contained concentric multi-lamellar, myeloid body-like inclusions 
in the cytoplasm, which were considered indicative of a phospholipidosis condition. Foamy macrophages 
are a typical finding for lysosomotropic compounds as has been described amongst others for chloroquine 
and suramin (Schneider et al 1997). 
Adrenal gland 
Adrenal gland changes were noted in both monkeys and rats. Increased weight and adrenal cortical 
hypertrophy occurred in different studies in rats at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day. Similar effects were seen in the 
4-week monkey studies at doses ≥40 mg/kg/day. In the subsequent sub-chronic and chronic toxicity 
studies at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day, lipofuscin inclusions were noted in the adrenal cortex of monkeys. 
Inconsistent results were obtained from the serum cortisol and ACTH level measurements performed in 
monkeys of two 4-week studies and one 39-week study. There were no clear adrenal cortical changes in 
mice, besides diffuse hypertrophy of the zona fasiculata in male dosed above MTD. Adrenal changes were 
shown to be reversible following an adequate withdrawal period. Again, no mechanistic explanation was 
provided, but the lipofuscin accumulation observed in monkeys suggests the possibility of 
lysosomal/autophagal dysfunction possibly associated with accumulation of safinamide in the tissue. 
According to the Applicant, this phenomenon should be seen as a "wear and tear" pigment, which 
accumulates in the adrenals and other organs over the life of an animal and is considered not 
toxicologically relevant. Furthermore, there was no evidence of altered adrenal function in clinical studies. 
Retina 
Thinning and degeneration of the outer retina layer were observed in the rodent repeated-dose toxicity 
studies and can briefly be summarized as time and dose dependent; occurring in pigmented and albino 
strains; exacerbated by high light intensity levels; not exacerbated by combination treatment with 
levodopa/carbidopa but slightly exacerbated by pramipexole combination treatment; not associated with 
melanin binding or undue sensitivity to UV light; correlating with changes in ERG and SD-OCT; apparent 
early photoreceptor changes at 24 hours after start of treatment by EM examination; reversible after 3 
days of treatment; safinamide is probably the causative toxicant and not the metabolites of safinamide.

The Applicant considered the retinal effects in rodents not relevant for humans, claiming that 
safinamide-related retinal atrophy occurs only in rodents and not in monkeys, even after long-term 
administration and even when combined with other drugs associated with retinal degeneration in rats and 
claiming that there was no increased risk of retinal degeneration in patients treated with safinamide.  
Generally safety margins if existent were low, especially for the retinal toxicity observed in rats, but in 
monkeys safety margins (6.6-9.5 based on AUC) were more acceptable. 
Genotoxicity, carcinogenicity 
A battery of genotoxicity assays were performed to assess the genotoxic potential of Safinamide, 
metabolites NW 1153, NW 1689 and NW 1689-AG, the acyl glucuronide form. Safinamide and its 
metabolites have shown no genotoxic potential. 
In two long term carcinogenicity tests in mice and rat, safinamide did not show tumorigenic potential. 
Fertility and pregnancy 
In rat male and female fertility studies no effects on fertility parameters were observed up to at least 3.8 
and 3-fold the anticipated maximal clinical exposure. However, at exposures above 1.4-fold the human 
clinical exposure, sperm abnormalities were observed. Considering the low safety margin and the 
differences between sperm levels in rat and in man, an effect on male fertility cannot be excluded. 
In embryo-fetal developmental studies in rats and rabbits malformations were induced at safinamide 
exposures 2 and 3-fold above human clinical exposure, respectively. In the rat study no NOAEL was 
established and at the lowest dose level slightly enlarged ureter(s), globular heart, oedema of hindlimbs 
and displaced testes were observed. In rabbits, malrotated limbs were observed. Although the incidence 
of these malformations was low, due to the low or absent safety margins, safinamide must be considered 
to be potentially teratogenic.  
In a pre- and postnatal developmental rat study, mortality, absence of milk in the stomach and neonatal 
hepatotoxicity was observed at dose levels similar to the anticipated clinical exposure. Mechanistic 
studies showed that pre-natal exposure and exposure through the milk induced the hepatotoxic effects in 
the pups. Women treated with safinamide should not breastfeed their children. 
Local tolerability 
Acute dermal and eye irritation studies in rabbits revealed that safinamide is not irritant to the skin while 
it is severely irritating to the eye. 
Dependence and abuse potential 
Dependence potential was addressed by the Applicant in response to the D120 LoQ. A behavioural study 
in rhesus monkeys showed that safinamide could enhance the discriminative stimulus of cocaine, which is 
explained by the Applicant as a consequence of its pharmacological activity of enhancing the 
dopaminergic transmission. It is concluded that there is little evidence to suggest that safinamide would 
pose a problem as regards abuse potential in PD patients. With respect to a potential interaction with DA 
releasing agents, there remains some uncertainty. It can be accepted that no further studies are 
performed at this stage.

A study determining the adsorption constant of the active has not been submitted. QSAR values were not 
accepted. The applicant was requested to complete the dossier and to submit an adsorption-desorption 
study using a Batch Equilibrium Method (OECD 106) 2 types of sewage sludge.  
The applicant was also recommended to determine the organic carbon content of the sludges. This study 
was ongoing at the time of the assessment. 
In case Koc sludge >10,000 L/kg, a soil risk assessment is triggered (see EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 
1). 
The water/sediment simulation study suggests that more than 10% of the compound shifted to sediment 
at or after 14 days. Therefore, a sediment risk assessment is triggered. The applicant committed to 
perform a study on sediment dwelling organisms to evaluate the potential risk to sediment organisms, but 
requested to conduct a study according to OECD 218 instead of OECD 219. This was recommended by the 
CHMP. 
As a sediment risk assessment is triggered, the applicant was recommended by the Committee to conduct 
an adsorption-desorption study using a Batch Equilibrium Method (OECD 106) using 3 soil types to enable 
calculation of PECsediment.  
To assist the persistence of a compound in the environment it is necessary to normalize the DT50 to an 
environmentally relevant outdoor temperature, which is agreed to be 12°C in the EU. The applicant was 
recommended to do so in the revised ERA. 
The DT50 values for safinamide and its metabolites, Met 1, Met 2 and Met 3 were recalculated from the 
data obtained at 20 ± 2°C in two aquatic sediment systems using the Arrhenius equation to DT50 values 
at 12°C, which will be added to the revised ERA. From these DT50 values it does not appear that 
safinamide or its metabolites, Met 1, Met 2 and Met 3, meet the persistence criterion in sediment or 
whole-system (DT50 < 120 days).All the above mentioned issues can be addressed with 
post-authorization measures as recommended by the CHMP.  
2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The reversible inhibition of MAO-B occurs at relatively low concentrations and also can be measured ex 
vivo after modest doses of safinamide in animals. Reducing dopamine catabolism by MAO-B inhibition is 
an established mode of action which substantiates the modest increase in ON-time in MPTP-lesioned 
cynomolgus or rhesus monkeys when these animals are treated with L-DOPA.  Taken together these 
non-clinical data support and explain the increase in ON-time observed in PD patients treated with 
safinamide as add-on therapy next to L-DOPA. However, efficacy or mode of action of safinamide for use 
as add-on therapy in PD patients next to a dopamine agonist has not been investigated non-clinically.  
Multiple modes of action next to safinamide’s action as a MAO-B inhibitor have been theorized, notably 
sodium channel inhibition, calcium channel inhibition, reduction of excessive glutamate release, and 
inhibition of dopamine and serotonine transporters. It is uncertain whether the brain concentrations in 
patients receiving a maximal daily dose of safinamide of 100 mg would be sufficient for these additional 
mechanisms to be demonstrated as meaningful in the therapeutic effect. 
Although the Applicant tried to argue by providing a justification based on PK/PD estimation of the 
pharmacodynamically available safinamide brain concentrations in humans and their possible correlation  
to in vitro concentrations and brain concentrations in animals at which relevant effects on sodium 
glutamate release were measured, from the assessment it was concluded that at therapeutic 
concentrations in humans inhibition of brain MAO-B was the most likely mechanism responsible for the 
increase in ON time in PD patients simultaneously treated with L-DOPA. For all other claimed mechanisms 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 32/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of safinamide the evidence provided was not considered convincing enough for the CHMP to conclude that 
these were relevant for PD patients treated with safinamide.  
A modest increase of ON-time could be demonstrated in MPTP-lesioned cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys. 
However, a reduction in dyskinetic score observed in the cynomolgus monkey was not replicated in an 
independent experiment in rhesus monkeys. Therefore the claim from the Applicant that safinamide can 
reduce dyskinesia associated with dopaminergic treatments in PD patients was considered by the 
Committee as not sufficiently supported by the non-clinical data. 
Outcome parameters assessed in cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies were only minimally 
affected and/or showed only changes at high safinamide doses or concentrations. These results indicated 
that safinamide did not pose an increased cardiovascular risk.  
Although initial binding assays suggested a potential interaction of safinamide and/or its metabolites with 
imidazoline receptor type 2, sigma receptors type 1 and 2, muscarinic receptor type 3 at clinically relevant 
concentrations, follow-up studies did not reveal agonist activity of safinamide and/or its metabolites and 
showed antagonist activity only at concentrations, which are not considered clinically relevant. The 
functional data can be considered to overrule the initial binding data. Consequently, a clinically relevant 
interaction with M3-antagonists in patients is not expected. Pharmacokinetically, the main issue is a lack 
of information on the identity of the amidases involved in the major routes of metabolism of safinamide, 
which is to be resolved by the respective measure introduced in the RMP i.e. a study to investigate in vitro 
which amidase enzymes are involved in its biotransformation to NW-1153.  
Furthermore information on transporters, with potentially relevant for drug-drug interactions is very 
limited, but this will also be addressed  by the CHMP recommendation to submit the reports of in vitro 
studies evaluating whether safinamide affects the function of several transporters.  
The CHMP considered that the questions about amidase enzymes’ involvement in the biotransformation of 
Safinamide to NW-1153, and the ones with regard to clinical DDI study with a BCRP substrate with a Tmax 
≤2 hours, needed to be addressed in specific measures included in the RMP, and linked to the relevant 
missing information. The Committee also recommended that the data from the studies on ERA (please 
see section

Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment) are provided post-approval. 
Discussion on retinal degeneration 
Based on the non-clinical data only, it could not be concluded whether the observed retinal toxicity was 
rodent specific. It was clear that rats show a greater sensitivity as retinal toxicity was consistently 
observed in them, whereas in monkeys only slight effects on mitochondria in photoreceptor cells were 
seen. In only one monkey at a mid-dose level of 10 mg/kg/day safinamide plus 2 mg/kg/day pramipexole, 
more extensive unilateral retinopathy was seen and this was interpreted as a spontaneous lesion by the 
applicant. The applicant tried to argue that these observations in monkeys were not to be considered 
toxicologically relevant, but for the CHMP they did introduce another level of uncertainty about the 
rodent-specificity of the retinal changes. Furthermore, conclusions on any findings in monkeys (or the 
lack of them) should be taken with caution because more detailed histological observations (counting of 
rows of nuclei in the outer nuclear layer) was only done in a few studies with 91 animals, and a more 
detailed electron microscopic investigation was only done in a single monkey study. 
The studies in rats provided a more elaborate and detailed structural and temporal description of the 
retinopathy, but a mechanistic explanation was lacking. This made it difficult to assess the relevance of 
the retinal lesions to any potential similar effects on humans in the setting of the intended clinical use. In 
an attempt to clarify mechanistically the observations, the lysosomotropic properties of safinamide were 
considered by the Applicant and the results demonstrated that the mechanism was not similar to 
chloroquine, a known lysosomotropic retinal toxicant. Yet high concentrations in other acidic 
compartments, e.g. in mitochondria, were not further investigated. Hypothetically, impaired 
lysosomal/autophagal function of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells may have deleterious effects on 
the photoreceptor cells (PRC) as has been proposed for chloroquine and other retinotoxic substances (see 
Audo & Warchol 2012, and references mentioned in this review). Additional experimental data submitted 
provided some evidence that phagocytosis by and cytotoxicity of RPE cells was not affected at clinically 
relevant concentrations of safinamide, although uncertainties on extrapolation of in vitro to in vivo data 
and vice versa remained. Also interference of safinamide with degradative processes within the RPE and 
subsequent potential accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment remnants and degradants had not 
been investigated. Therefore, although a direct effect on phagocytosis or acute cytotoxic effect on RPE 
cells seemed unlikely, potential interference with other elements relevant for the degradation and 
recycling of outer segment remnants by RPE could not be fully excluded on the basis of the experimental 
results provided. 
Another hypothesis explaining the findings could be that excess dopamine diffusing from amacrine cells, 
due to reduced re-uptake and/or reduced metabolism could be a contributory factor leading to oxidative 
stress (Toler 2012). The study investigating dopamine metabolism in rat retinas was considered 
inconclusive in this respect as dopamine and dopamine metabolite levels in the retinas were assessed 
only one hour after the administration of safinamide.  
Although retinal toxicity was present in rats, and its mechanism had not been elucidated, the lack of 
consistent similar findings in humans diminished the concern for potential similar effect on the patients. 
Nevertheless, based on the non-clinical evidence available, the CHMP was of the view that retinal 
degeneration should be considered as an important potential risk and followed up on through the 
proposed routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities, as described in the RMP.  
2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Safinamide is a reversible MAO-B inhibitor. Non-clinical data support a modest increase in ON-time when 
administered in combination with L-dopa/carbidopa.

From a non-clinical point of view it was considered that Xadago could be granted a Marketing 
Authorisation. With regards to the environmental risk assessment, the CHMP concluded that the dossier 
was not complete and recommended that several elements be investigated post-authorisation, as 
detailed in section 2.3.5. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
Safinamide is an α-aminoamide derivative. It was claimed to act through a multi-modal mechanism of 
action:  
- reversible and selective Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, which is more than 1000-fold selective 
over MAO-A. Inhibition of the MAO-B pathway is thought to prevent the breakdown of both endogenous 
and exogenous dopamine in the brain. 
-reduction of stimulated glutamate release in the basal ganglia, without affecting basal glutamate levels.  
-controlling the neuronal excitability by blocking voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels in a 
state-dependent manner. Safinamide also modulates calcium (Ca++) channels.  
At higher dosages, safinamide binds to monoamine transporters DAT, SERT, NET, which are responsible 
for the reuptake of their associated amine neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, 
respectively. 
The first in man Phase I study for safinamide was conducted in September 1999. Safinamide was initially 
explored in subjects with epilepsy. Safinamide has also been explored in cognitive dysfunction, but there 
was no intention to continue clinical development for either epilepsy or cognition at the time of this 
application. 
Because of its MAO-B inhibitory properties, an exploratory Phase II randomised placebo-controlled study 
in subjects with  early PD was performed in 2001, indicating an dose-dependent improvement of motor 
symptoms in a sub-group of patients using dopamine-agonist at baseline (study 009). Later, also studies 
were performed in advanced PD patients with motor fluctuations, with safinamide as add-on to levodopa 
therapy.  
The Phase III program consisted of two 24-week placebo-controlled studies add-on to a single DA-agonist 
in early-stage PD subjects (non-fluctuators), and two 24-week, placebo-controlled studies in mid- to 
late-stage fluctuating PD subjects on L-dopa and other concomitant anti-Parkinson’s medications. 
Subjects completing the 24-week trials could continue treatment in long-term (up to 18 months), 
double-blind, placebo-controlled extension studies, and/or enter an open-label study in which all subjects 
received safinamide. 
Safinamide was originally developed by Newron, but in 2006 Merck Serono acquired the rights.   
Merck-Serono interrupted the continuation of a prescheduled double-blind extension phase of a Phase III 
trial in early PD (MOTION Study) , as in the first placebo-controlled phase of 24 weeks the primary 
endpoint was not met. In 2012, Newron regained full global rights to safinamide from Merck-Serono. In 
April 2012 the Zambon Group gained rights to commercialise safinamide globally, excluding Japan and 
other key Asian territories, where Meiji Seika has the rights to develop and commercialise. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Assessment report

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
A request for GCP routine inspection was adopted by the CHMP for the clinical Study 27918 (MOTION trial). 
The inspection was performed and it was concluded that the study report could be used for evaluation and 
assessment of the application.  
2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) 
The absolute bioavailability of safinamide is high (mean 95%) after administration of 50 mg as tablets 
under fasting conditions. As the solubility is low (as described in the quality section) safinamide can be 
classified according the BCS as a Class II drug. Safinamide is not subjected to a significant first pass 
effect. 
After intravenous administration the estimated clearance is about 4.6 L/h and the volume of distribution 
174 L. The elimination half-life is about 26 hours.  
After administration of a single oral dose of safinamide 100 mg the maximum plasma concentration was 
found after approximately 2 hours, the Cmax was approximately 650 ng/mL and the AUC 19000 ng/mL×h. 
In several studies a secondary peak was observed. The second peak was seen about 45 minutes after the 
first peak. The secondary peaks are most probably due to the disposition of safinamide and although the 
most  obvious  explanation  would  suggest  this  may  be  due  to  intestinal  re-absorption  after  biliary 
elimination; i.e. associated with entero-hepatic cycling (EHC), data from the peaks observed after i.v. 
dosing contradict this supposition (Roberts M et al. 2002). 
Two food effect studies were conducted. In the first study (N=14) no food effect was found and in the 
second study (N=6) the Cmax was slightly lower (16%) after intake with food; in both studies the Tmax was 
delayed. Based on these studies it could be concluded that food does not have a significant influence on 
the bioavailability of safinamide. 
The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) is 165 L (Vz is 174 L indicating that safinamide is well 
distributed. This is in line with safinamide's lipophilicity and high permeability. 
The extent of protein binding in human plasma was concentration independent, the unbound fraction was 
11-12% for safinamide, and for the metabolites 25-29% for NW-1153, <.0.2% for NW-1689 and 2.6% 
for the acyl glucuronide of NW-1689 (NW-1689 AG). 
The total clearance was determined to be 4.6 l/h classifying safinamide as a low clearance drug. The mean 
elimination half-life was 26 hours with a range of 20-40 h, allowing for once a day administration. In the 
mass balance study, approximately 78% of the radioactivity was recovered within 192 h (76% in urine 
and 1.5% in feces); the recovery is consistent with the radioactivity elimination half-life of ~80 h 
(CRO-02-33). The excretion data and metabolic pattern confirmed that safinamide is extensively 
metabolized, only 5-7% of the administered dose was found unchanged in urine within 48-72 h and 
increased only slightly afterwards. 
A typical plasma-concentration-time curve is given below (Figure 2).

The metabolic pattern found in several studies submitted was in line with those found in animal studies. 
Safinamide is extensively metabolised in the non-clinical species and humans. The major route of 
safinamide biotransformation is via NW-1153 to Met A/Met-X to NW-1689. Safinamide is metabolised to 
NW-1153 via amidases, however the specific amidase involved had not been identified. The company had 
shown that FAAH was not the main amidase responsible for the biotransformation of safinamide, but had 
not evaluated the contribution of other amidases.  
Thereafter, NW-1153 is further metabolised to Met-A and Met-X via an N-dealkylation by an unknown 
enzyme. Safinamide is to a minor extent metabolised to NW-1199 via CYP enzymes. However, the 
enzymes involved were not identified. CYP3A4 and to a minor extent CYP2J2 and 2C19 are involved in the 
direct metabolism of safinamide to Met-A. Met-A is further metabolised by MAO-A to Met-X which is 
further metabolised to NW-1689 via ALDH2 and to a minor extent via ALDH7A1. NW-1689 is 
glucuronidated by UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A7, 1A9 and 2B15 to NW-1689 glucuronide.  
All relevant metabolites (NW-1153, NW-1189, and NW-1689 glucuronide) are considered inactive in 
terms of efficacy and safety. 
The main compound in plasma, exceeding the exposure of the parent drug is the metabolite NW-1689. 
The other two main metabolites NW-1689 glucuronide and NW-1153 present a smaller fraction 
accounting to about 20% and 10% of the parent drug exposure total radioactivity in plasma, respectively 
(Studies 28778, 28559, EMR 701165-21). NW-1153 is a minor metabolite in plasma and is actively 
excreted via OAT3 to the urine. The exposure to the metabolites of safinamide does not accumulate after 
repeated administration. In line with this, the metabolic ratio remains unchanged after steady state, 
compared to single dose administration. The half-lives of the metabolites are comparable to that of 
safinamide, i.e. 19.5 h, 25.3 h and 26.5 h for NW-1153, NW-1689 and NW-1689 glucuronide, 
respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 37/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In urine, the main metabolites were NW-1153 (14-22% of dose) and NW-1689 glucuronide (11-20% of 
dose), NW-1689 was detected only in trace amounts. In addition, a few minor metabolites 
(O-debenzylated safinamide (NW-1199), glycine-conjugated NW-1689 and traces of monohydroxylated 
safinamide derivatives were found in urine.  
Safinamide is a chiral compound, however, inter conversion of S-safinamide to R-safinamide is unlikely to 
occur in vivo as R-safinamide could not be detected (study CRO-02-33). 
The pharmacokinetics of safinamide were investigated over a wide range of doses (from 1.5 mg to 700 
mg) in different studies. The inter- and intra-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics of safinamide 
was 15-30% for the Cmax and AUC's. The mean safinamide concentrations found in patients were 
comparable with those found in healthy subjects. 
PK in special populations 
The effect of renal impairment on safinamide pharmacokinetics was investigated in an open-label, 
parallel-group, single centre, single oral dose (50 mg) study in 24 male and female subjects. Overall, 
increased exposure of safinamide metabolites was in accordance with available information on their 
elimination. According to the available data it was agreed by the CHMP that dose adjustment is not 
needed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment.  
The effect of hepatic impairment was investigated in an open-label, parallel group, single center, single 
oral dose study. The plasma pharmacokinetics of safinamide are comparable between healthy and 
Child-Pugh A subjects. An increase in AUC0-t and a longer half-life was observed in Child-Pugh B subjects 
which points to differences in the elimination between subjects with different hepatic functions. In the 
SmPC a dose recommendation is given for these patients. No data are available in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment, and that is why they are contra-indicated according to the SmPC. 
No formal studies were conducted on the intrinsic factors gender, age, weight and race. In the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of the safinamide data of the Phase III clinical studies no clinical significant 
effect of gender, age, weight and race was found.  
Age was tested as a covariate in the population PK model and was found not to affect safinamide 
pharmacokinetics significantly.  
The population analysis included the data of 209 elderly subjects see Table 4 below:

The Applicant did not investigate the effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of safinamide in a separate 
study or performed a subgroup analysis with the results of the studies in which subjects of either gender 
were used. However, the PopPk analysis did not show any  effect of gender. 
No information of the effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of safinamide was submitted by the 
company.  
In the pop PK study body weight was included as a covariate, in subjects over 100 kg the plasma levels 
were lower than in subjects with a weight of 70 kg.

Interactions 
In vitro 
The potential effect on COMT or dopa- decarboxylase, which is involved in the metabolism of L-dopa, and 
the ALDH inhibition potential of safinamide were investigated. No interactions were observed at clinically 
relevant systemic concentrations. 
The inhibitory potential of safinamide and its metabolites on the transporters P-glycoprotein, BCRP, BSEP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT4 was assessed. Based on the in vitro studies and Gastro-Intestinal 
Transit Time simulations, it was excluded that safinamide is an inhibitor of BCRP in the small intestine and 
could potentially lead to DDIs.  The CHMP recommended the conduct of a clinical DDI study with a BCRP 
substrate with a Tmax ≤ 2 hours (e.g. pitavastatin, pravastatin, ciprofloxacin, methotrexate, topotecan, 
diclofenac or glyburide) to evaluate this potential. Safinamide and its major metabolite, NW-1689, had no 
inhibitory potential for the other transporters. Based on available data, safinamide did not appear to be an 
inhibitor of OATP1A2 and 2B1, and NW-1153 was not an inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. 
In vivo  
Cyp-3A4 inhibitors: From the data available it was shown that the PK of safinamide and its metabolites 
is not altered when co-administered with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole. Small non-clinically 
relevant changes of the plasma concentrations of safinamide and metabolites were observed. 
Enzyme inducers: In study NW-1015/010/II/2002 the interaction with antiepileptic drugs was 
evaluated. In this study the plasma safinamide levels were about 30% lower in patients using enzyme 
inducing antiepileptic drugs when compared with those not using enzyme inducers. The data from study 
NW-1015/010/II/2002 did not support a reliable conclusion of the magnitude of effect of 
enzyme-inducing drugs on safinamide pharmacokinetics. However, given the range of concentrations 
observed in these patients, particularly on day 4 where a full concentration-time profile was characterised, 
and given the potent enzyme inducing drugs that were co-administered, the CHMP agreed that there was 
good evidence that there will not be a large impact of strong inducers on safinamide plasma 
concentrations. Therefore, it was considered acceptable not to conduct a specific study with 
co-administration of a strong enzyme inducer. 
CYP1A2 substrate: Concomitant administration of safinamide and the CYP1A2 substrate caffeine 
resulted in an increased plasma exposure of caffeine. It could be concluded that safinamide is a weak 
CYP1A2 inhibitor at the dose of 100 mg. This is in line with the results of the in vitro studies although the 
time dependent effect was not confirmed.  
CYP3A4 substrate: Safinamide is a weak inducer of CYP3A4, it decreased midazolam exposure by 20%, 
this effect was considered small and not of clinical relevance. These results were also in line with the 
results of the in vitro studies. 
L-Dopa: The results of interaction studies with L-dopa and safinamide in healthy volunteers and 
Parkinson patients show that safinamide did not affect the PK of L-dopa to a clinically relevant extent. 
Based on known safety profile and PK variability of levodopa, the acceptance boundaries for L-dopa were 
predefined at 0.75-1.33, which was considered acceptable. This was line with the results of the preclinical 
studies in which was also shown that safinamide did not affect the PK of L-dopa. The effect of L-dopa on 
the pharmacokinetics of safinamide has not been evaluated and was not required as the population PK 
data in Parkinson patients treated with L-dopa were in line with the safinamide PK data of healthy 
volunteers. 
Other medication used for Parkinson’s disease: No pharmacokinetic interaction study with 
dopamine agonists was performed. The clinical safety of combined use with dopamine agonists was

investigated. Based on the presented PD interaction evaluation it appeared that the risk of 
neuropsychiatric adverse events seemed to be higher in subjects taking dopamine agonists. This adverse 
event could be explained by the pharmacodynamic properties of both therapeutic agents. Safinamide is 
also expected to be co-administered with amantadine and parasympathicolytic Parkinson medication. No 
pharmacokinetic interaction studies were performed with this concomitant medication, although this 
medication was also evaluated in the PD interaction study. For amantadine worsening of PD including 
hallucinations was observed, for the parasympathicolytic Parkinson medication no safety issues were 
detected. Because pharmacokinetic interactions with dopamine agonists are not expected based on the 
pharmacokinetic properties of both agents the lack of a PK interaction study was considered acceptable. 
Proton pump inhibitors: As the solubility of safinamide is pH dependent a DDI study with a proton 
pump inhibitor was requested to be presented. As a response, the applicant performed a popPK analysis. 
The simulations predicted only a slight increase in safinamide Cmax and AUC of 4 and 10%, respectively, 
when co-administered with different PPIs. This effect was considered clinically irrelevant by the 
Committee.  
Antidepressants: As serious adverse events have been reported with the concomitant use of other 
MAO- B inhibitors and antidepressants it was agreed that concomitant use should not be recommended. 
Additional interaction studies were not required. 
Other co-medication: In clinical practice, it can be expected that safinamide will be used in an elderly 
population. Concomitant use of other medication is to be expected. The potential for pharmacodynamic 
interactions was evaluated in patients with early and late stage Parkinson’s disease, in a safety study. The 
Breslow-Day test was used to assess AEs in patients on specific concomitant medication. This test can be 
used to get a first impression of the safety of the combined use of medication, however it cannot be used 
to show that there are no drug interactions. Based on the results of the PD interaction study, it appeared 
that concomitant administration of XADAGO™ together with a broad category of commonly used drugs in 
this patient population (antihypertensive medications, beta-blockers cholesterol lowering drugs, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, etc.) was not associated with any increased risk for adverse 
events, however no definite conclusions on the lack of interaction could be drawn. Due to the low potential 
for interaction of safinamide via CYP and P-gp no additional pharmacokinetic studies with these drugs 
were considered required by the Committee. 
Distribution/Excretion 
As safinamide is not a substrate for P-gp and was found to be distributed into the brain tissue in animals, 
distribution into the human brain was also expected to occur. The in vitro substrate studies with 
safinamide for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP1A2, and OATP2B1 were ongoing at the time of MAA (only 
preliminary results were provided), and it was recommended by the CHMP to provide the full data when 
they become available post-approval. The available data indicated that it was unlikely that Safinamide 
was a substrate for BCRP, OATP1B1, 1B3, 1A2 and 2B1 after it reaches the systemic circulation. This 
indicated that the transporters OATP1A2 and 2B1 are most likely not involved in the active transport over 
the blood-brain barrier. NW-1153 is actively excreted in urine (most likely via OAT3). 
Elimination 
The total recovery found in the mass-balance study was moderate. It was not clear what the fate of the 
23% of the administered dose remaining undetected was. The applicant clarified that samples collection 
beyond 200 h resulted in only 80-90% in animal species and that similar pattern was to be expected in 
humans. That scenario was considered an acceptable explanation for the expected pattern in humans 
considering the long elimination half-life of 80 hours.

Metabolism 
Safinamide is extensively metabolised. Several enzymes are involved in the biotransformation of 
safinamide, however not all the involved enzymes were identified during the development programme. 
Although amidases appear to be the main metabolic enzymes responsible for the biotransformation of 
safinamide to NW 1153, the specific amidase involved had not been identified. Because metabolism of 
safinamide through NW-1153 is the main elimination pathway, and since in the future relevant inhibitors 
or inducers of amidases may become known, it was considered important the amidases involved in this 
process should be identified and this led to a recommendation from the Committee.  
Several other enzymes involved in the metabolism of safinamide were also not identified, however this 
was not considered a problem as these enzymes were involved in the minor routes of elimination. 
This might explain why safinamide metabolism was minimally (approx. 10%) inhibited by the CYP3A4 
inhibitor ketoconazole in vivo.  
At the time of this opinion there were no marketed drugs known to cause clinically significant drug-drug 
interactions through inhibition or induction of amidase enzymes. 
Dose proportionality and time dependent pharmacokinetics 
The half-life of safinamide after single and multiple doses was 23.4 h (EMR701165-021) and 23.8 h 
(IPAS-NW/LD-231-00), respectively.  The corresponding AUCs0-∞ after single and multiple oral doses 
were 19245 ng/ml/*h (EMR701165-021), and 19811 ng/ml/*h (Study 28559), respectively.  Using a 
dosing interval of 24 hours (once daily), steady state is reached after 5 days.  The data in humans indicate 
consistency in the time to steady state based on the reported half-life. 
After repeated dosing the pharmacokinetics of safinamide seem not to change in a significant way and the 
pharmacokinetics seem to be time-independent. The applicant did not provide a formal steady-state 
study in which the Ctrough values were measured over several days in steady state. However, in the Clinical 
Phase III studies 015 and 017, plasma concentrations were measured over a long period of time. From 
these data it was clear that the pharmacokinetics of safinamide could be considered as time independent.  
Pharmacokinetics in Patients 
In healthy subjects after administration of 100 mg/day a Cmax was found of 1200 ng/mL and in patients 
after administration of 50-100 mg (most patients received 100 mg) a mean concentration of approx. 
1000 ng/mL was found in the clinical study 015. However in the other clinical study 016 higher 
concentrations were found with a difference of 30% to the results from study 015. Even though no 
explanation (e.g. use of different analytical techniques, salt content versus free base, differences in 
administered dose and sampling time) was provided, the observed 30% difference in safinamide plasma 
concentration was not considered relevant for the comparison between patient and healthy volunteer 
data, as the uncertainty in the plasma concentrations of both studies was similarly high. Despite of this 
difference between clinical study 015 and 016 it could be concluded that overall the pharmacokinetics in 
Parkinson patients did not differ significantly from those in healthy volunteers. 
Special Populations 
Renal Impairment 
In subjects with renal impairment, the excretion in urine of safinamide was similar to that in subjects with 
normal renal function: 3.3% (moderate) and 4.9% (severe). Cumulative recovery of the metabolites was 
lower in subjects with renal impairment: 26.7% and 22.9% of the dose in subjects with moderate and 
severe impairment, respectively. In conclusion, safinamide dose adjustment was not considered needed 
in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment.

Hepatic Impairment 
An increase in AUC0-t and a longer half-life was observed in Child-Pugh B subjects which points to 
differences in the elimination between subjects with different hepatic functions. 
The formation of the metabolite NW-1689 was reduced in subjects with hepatic impairment as indicated 
by a decrease in Cmax. Terminal t1/2 was prolonged by approximately 20 h in Child-Pugh B subjects 
compared to controls demonstrating that the elimination of this metabolite was also affected. Overall, the 
net effect on AUC0-inf and AUC0-t is marginal as shown by comparable values across the three groups.  
2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Based on pre-clinical data, safinamide was speculated to act through multimodal mechanisms of action, 
including Monoamine Oxidase B inhibition, reduction of stimulated release of glutamate without affecting 
basal glutamate levels,  and reduction of the neuronal excitability by blocking voltage-gated sodium 
channels and at higher concentrations it inhibition of calcium channels.  
The MAO-B inhibitory effect of safinamide was evaluated in healthy volunteers and patients in several 
studies. In these studies, inhibition of the deamination of C14 –PEA in platelets by the study drugs was 
measured, as biomarker of central MAO-B activity. The outcomes are summarized in the Table 5 below:

Based on these data, it was concluded that safinamide at doses over 40 mg, induced a complete blockade 
of MAO-B activity in platelets, which is a biomarker for central MAO-B activity.  
In first-in-men study IPAS-PNU-194-99 in healthy volunteers, doses of 10 mg/kg did not affect MHPG 
(3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol) levels in plasma, a biomarker of MAO-A inhibition, compared to 
placebo. Three Phase I trials in healthy volunteers did not reveal a change in blood pressure at tyramine 
challenge, in contrast to the positive control phenelzine. Base on this it could be concluded that at 
therapeutic doses, safinamide has limited impact on MAO-A activity, and therefore no significant 
interaction with tyramine in food is expected.

Safinamide was also explored in epilepsy where in a short-term uncontrolled study a reduction of seizures 
compared to baseline was observed (an effect which was theorized to result from the activity of 
safinamide on sodium channels). However, it was difficult to draw conclusions from this study because of 
its open-label design.   
PK_PD analysis 
The relationship between ON-time and safinamide plasma levels was evaluated in a PK-PD model. The 
clinical data for this model were derived from Study 016.  No clear correlation between plasma levels and 
efficacy outcome was found. 
Potential pharmacodynamics interactions  
The risk of safinamide in combination with specific drugs of interest was explored in the pooled safety 
dataset of the main placebo-controlled trials. Amongst others, an increased risk of fractures and falls was 
observed in patients treated with safinamide and concurrent use of anxiolytics and antihypertensive 
drugs and an increased risk of psychoses with amantadine use.

# By Breslow-Day testing for a difference in AE-by-treatment odds ratios between the With Co-medication and Without Co-medication groups. A 
Tarone adjustment was applied for all tests due to small numbers of adverse events in most categories; Co-med= co-medication 
The analyses on pharmacodynamic interactions in the pooled dataset should be interpreted with caution, 
as there was no stratification for co-medication at baseline, and co-mediation was not kept constant over 
time.  Thus a negative signal from this analysis could not completely exclude interactions.  
When safinamide was added to L-DOPA, the incidence of dyskinesia increased, as may be expected as the 
dopaminergic load increases.  However, most of them were of mild-moderate nature. For other MAO_B 
inhibitors like rasagiline, impulse control disorders have been reported, often in combination with 
dopamine agonists. Since all the main studies were performed in an add-on setting, it would be difficult to 
disentangle whether there is an additive risk of safinamide on its own, as there was no safinamide 
monotherapy comparator group available.  
Safinamide inhibits serotonin-transporter enzyme (SERT) and may therefore display a serotonergic 
effect. Apparently, the combination with SSRI’s did not induce serotonergic symptoms like dizziness, 
hypertension or neuropsychiatric events in the safinamide trials (117 subjects used both drugs). 
Nevertheless, a warning - but no contra-indication- was included in the SmPC for the use of SSRI’s. This 
was supported, as serious adverse events have been reported for other MAO-B inhibitors used in 
combination with SSRI and other antidepressants.

2.6.4.  Discussion  and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general the pharmacokinetics of safinamide had been sufficiently characterized, however some 
deficiencies were noted in the dossier. PK interaction studies were still ongoing at the time of MAA to fulfill 
the information gap.   
Safinamide is quickly and almost completely absorbed and extensively metabolized into several inactive 
metabolites. The primary route of elimination is via unspecified amidases, which were not fully identified 
at the time of assessment. 
The potential for interaction of safinamide via CYP and P-gp is low, however the CHMP recommended that 
the company should still evaluate if safinamide may interact with BCRP substrates and submit the reports 
of several in vitro studies evaluating whether safinamide affects the function of transporters. 
The CHMP recommended the below listed post-authorization measures in order to provide the necessary 
information to address the abovementioned deficiencies:   
 


 
in vitro substrate studies with safinamide for BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP1A2, and OATP2B.   
in vitro performed studies to determine if NW-1153 is a substrate for OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3.  
in vitro performed studies to determine if NW-1153 inhibits OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K.  
in vitro performed studies to determine if safinamide is an inhibitor of OATP1A2 and 2B1. 
Safinamide is a potent and specific MAO-B inhibitor. No dietary measures regarding tyramine-rich food, 
which is a substrate of MAO-A, were considered needed. The main effect of safinamide appears to be due 
to its MAO-B inhibiting properties. MAO-B inhibition is already expected to be optimal at the lower dose of 
50 mg.  This might explain why in the clinical studies no consistent dose effect was shown at dosages 
between 50-200 mg/day. 
Safinamide also blocked sodium channels and modified glutamate release, which was initially theorized to 
have a favorable effect on dyskinesia symptoms. Based on the provided in-vitro data, it was debatable 
whether a relevant effect on the glutamate release could be expected at the therapeutic safinamide dose 
level of 50-100 mg per day. The role of sodium channel blockade in conditions like epilepsy and 
neuropathic pain is known but it has not been established in the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease. It was 
postulated that modification of Na+ channels may contribute to a favourable effect on dyskinesia 
symptoms.  The ultimate proof to further test this hypothesis would have been a head-to-head 
comparison of safinamide to a `pure` MAO-B antagonist, but such a study was not presented. As 
discussed in the clinical efficacy part of this report, safinamide had no relevant effect on dyskinesia scores 
in the overall study population.  
The claim in the SmPC that safinamide may act in late stage PD patients through both dopaminergic and 
non-dopaminergic mechanisms was therefore modified to reflect the above conclusions.  
2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
Safinamide has been developed for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson Disease (PD), as add-on therapy 
to dopamine agonists in early PD and as add-on therapy to L-DOPA and other anti-Parkinson agents in 
advanced PD patients. An overview of the overall clinical development plan is presented in the next Figure 
3.

dyskinesia and lack of worsening (≤ 30 minutes) 
2.7.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study 009 – Dose response  
Study 009 is a randomized, double- blind, dose finding, parallel-group study. PD patients without motor 
fluctuations were included. Both treatment naïve (de-novo) and patients on a stable dose of DA-agonist 
were eligible.  
172 PD patients were randomly assigned to 1 mg/kg dose, 0.5 mg/kg dose or placebo, for a period of 12 
weeks. Subjects on a stable dose of a single DA-agonist were allowed to maintain their treatment in the 
study. Primary endpoint was ≥ 30% improvement in the UPDRS III motor symptoms at 12 weeks.  
Mean safinamide dose was 78.1 mg (range 40-91kg) for the 1 mg/kg group, and 34.4 mg (16-40.5 mg) 
for the 0.5 mg/kg group.  
Baseline mean UPDRS score was 16.6 (SD 7.6), 15.9 (7.0) and 17.5 (7.9) for the 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 
and Placebo group, respectively.  
Responder rates defined as ≥30% improvement in UPDRS III motor symptoms, were significantly higher 
for the 1 mg/kg dose compared to placebo but not for the 0.5 mg/kg dose (as assessed by logistic 
regression taking subgroup and center into account, see Table 8 below). The overall effect was however 
clearly driven by the subgroup of patients on DA-agonist monotherapy. No effect was shown for the 
de-novo subgroup. Furthermore, improvement UPDRS- motor scores from baseline was in favor of both 
active treatments in combination with a dopamine-agonist.

Based on the overall higher response on motor symptoms in the subgroup of patients treated with 
DA-agonists, drug-development was continued as add-on therapy to DA-agonist, and not as 
monotherapy.  
Dose-finding was further evaluated in the confirmatory Phase III trials, where fixed oral doses of 50-200 
mg daily were applied.

2.7.2.  Main study(ies) 
2.7.2.1.  Early stage Parkinson Disease add-on to dopamine agonist 
2.7.2.1.1.  Study 015 (including extension study 017), and the MOTION Study. 
Methods 
Study 015 and the MOTION Study concern randomized, multi-center, multinational, placebo-controlled, 
multiple dose, parallel group studies in Parkinson patients without motor fluctuation. Duration of the 
double-blind period was 24 weeks. Safinamide was given on top of dopamine-agonist monotherapy.  
Main inclusion criteria specified patients with a diagnosis of PD of less than 5 (3 for MOTION) years 
duration, and a Hoehn-Yahr Stage of I-III, who were receiving treatment with a single dopamine agonist 
at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.   
During the 24-week Treatment Period, the dopaminergic background therapy of DA-agonist was kept 
constant. However, dose adaptation, change to other anti-Parkinson medication, was allowed if 
absolutely necessary to treat a worsening of the patient's condition. Decreases in the DA-agonist dose 
were also permitted if based on the occurrence of AEs. 
Main differences between these studies concern the active dose arms and number of subjects. The dose 
arms in study 015 were 50 -100 mg and 150-200 mg safinamide once daily. Patients in study 015 were 
titrated up to the maximal tolerated doses within their dose range arm. De facto, more than 90% of the 
patients received the maximal dose allowed in the range, i.e. 100 mg/day or 200 mg/day. The dose arms 
in the MOTION study were 50 mg or 100 mg safinamide once-daily. The total number of subjects was 269 
in study 015 and 679 in the MOTION study. 
Outcomes 
Primary outcome in both study 015 and the MOTION study was the change in UPDRS-III motor score at 
week 24 as compared to baseline. 
The secondary endpoints of study 015 and the MOTION study were the same although the order of 
importance differed : CGI-responders rates, UPDRS-III responders (≥ 20% or ≥ 30% improvement from 
baseline), MMSE, Euro-Quality of Life (Euro-QOL), UPDRS-IV (Complication of Therapy) and Cogtest, a 
test battery of cognitive function.  
Statistical methods 
The main analysis set was the ITT population in both studies. 
In study 015, the change in UPDRS III score was analyzed using a mixed model analysis of covariance 
with baseline UPDRS III score as covariate, treatment, visit and the treatment visit interaction as fixed 
effects, and country as random effect. The analysis was performed without imputation of missing data. 
Four sensitivity analysis based on imputation were used (Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), 
Retrieved Drop Out analysis (RDO), Observed Case (OC) and Observed Case and Retrieved Drop Outs 
(OC and RDO) for the handling of missing values. The RDO population incorporated all patients who 
discontinued study-treatment prematurely, but returned for their efficacy assessment in the designated 
window period. For secondary continuous outcomes, an ANCOVA was used with the Baseline value for 
each variable as covariate and treatment group and country as main effects. For dichotomous secondary 
endpoints the Cochran Mantel-Haenszel method weighted by country was used.  
In the MOTION study, the primary endpoint was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model on the change from Baseline to Week 24, with fixed effects of treatment and region and the

baseline value of the UPDRS III score as covariate. The treatment-by-region interaction and 
treatment-by-UPDRS Baseline interaction were evaluated. If the interaction was statistically significant (p 
< 0.1), then further subgroups analysis using a nonparametric ANCOVA main model was conducted.  The 
primary analysis of the change in UPDRS III score was based on the so-called “On-Treatment Approach” 
that is only the On-Treatment efficacy data were used for analysis. Efficacy assessment of subjects whose 
treatment was withdrawn, or whose background anti-Parkinson medication was changed were not taken 
into account.  Missing values for the week-24 endpoint were imputed by a Last Observation Carried 
Forward (LOCF) approach using the last post-Baseline On-Treatment value. The same ANCOVA model 
used for the primary efficacy parameter was used for the continuous secondary clinical parameters.  
Dichotomous endpoints were analyzed using a logistic regression model with treatment and region 
effects. 
A hierarchical procedure was pre-specified used for the comparison of the primary parameter between 
each safinamide dose to placebo. First, the highest safinamide dose was compared with placebo. If this 
comparison was found to be statistically significant, then the lowest safinamide dose was compared with 
placebo. In case the result for the highest dose was not significant the comparison of the safinamide 
50-mg/day dose to placebo was not performed.  In the MOTION study testing of the key secondary 
efficacy analyses was performed in a pre-specified order with key secondary endpoints being UPDRS-II 
(ADL), CGI-C responders, PDQ-39, Cogtest-PD-battery. All secondary endpoints tested sequentially, first 
for safinamide 100 mg/day versus placebo, and then for safinamide 50 mg/day versus placebo once all 
parameters completed the 100-mg/day test successfully. The test for the next parameter/dose was only 
to proceed if the test for the preceding parameter was significant. 
In the MOTION Study, Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed with different 
analyses datasets (Completer or Per Protocol), the analysis approach (On-Treatment or Observed Case), 
and the statistical modeling approach (MMRM). In the “On-Treatment Approach”, subjects whose 
treatment was withdrawn, or background anti-Parkinson medication was changed, were not taken into 
account.

Most frequent dopamine agonist used was ropinirole (around 45% study 015) and pramipexole (around 
55% in the MOTION study).  
In Study 015, routine monitoring of PK samples revealed that in 79 out of 90 subjects [88%] assigned to 
placebo-treatment tested positively for safinamide at various time points throughout the study, and 
wide-spread over the treatment centers. A root cause analysis, which was performed in the bio-analytical 
laboratory, excluded that this was due to a bio-analytical failure.  Analysis indicated that this probably 
occurred during filling of the bulk bottles with either placebo- or safinamide-capsules. No further concerns 
were raised on this issue, as the safinamide plasma levels in the contaminated placebo-controls were a 
fraction of the levels that were achieved at steady-state of safinamide, and as the Test drug safinamide 
was not favoured by a potential higher placebo control. 
Routine monitoring in the MOTION trial did not provide evidence of contaminated placebo samples. 
Efficacy  
The results for the primary endpoint, improvement in UPDRS-III score, and main secondary endpoints for 
study 015 and the MOTION study are presented the next Table 10. Overall the change in UPDRS-III score 
from baseline was modest.

Study 015:  
Primary endpoint 
The comparison of -0.4 points improvement in UPDRS-III scores for the 150-200 mg dose group versus 
placebo was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.65).  The improvement for the 50-100 mg dose 
group was larger as compared to the 150-200 mg dose group (-1.9 points, 95% CI -3.7, -0.1). The value 
for the comparison versus placebo - without any adjustments for multiple comparisons that should have 
been applied in this case - revealed a p-value of 0.0419.  
Secondary and tertiary endpoints 
There were some changes in the secondary endpoints like UPDRS-II and UPDRS-20% improvement 
responders in favor of the 50-100 mg dose that were statistically significant without adjustment for 
multiplicity. No statistically significant effect was observed the other secondary endpoints, or for any of 
these outcomes for the 100-200 mg dose level. There were no significant differences between study 
groups regarding tertiary endpoints like depression (HAMD 17-item total score), UPDRS Section I 
(Mentation, Behavior and Mood) scores, UPDRS Section IV (Complication of Therapy). MMSE (Mini-Mental 
State Examination) was actually significantly worse for the High Dose safinamide group compared to 
placebo (p=0.028), but no significant effect was shown for the Low Dose for this outcome. There were no 
significant differences for QOL scores between active treatment and placebo.  
MOTION study:  
Primary endpoint 
The comparison of -0.65 points of improvement in UPDRS-III scores for the 50 mg dose group versus 
placebo was not significant. For the 100 mg dose group, comparison of -1.04 points of improvement was 
neither statistically significant different from placebo.

There were no significant differences between study arms with respect to the Cogtest® PD Battery test 
(Strategic Target Detection Test and Auditory Numbering Sequence). The subsequent exploratory 
analysis of the other supporting cognitive endpoints showed no statistically significant safinamide versus 
placebo differences for either of the two doses for any of the ANS, Spatial Working Memory Test, or Tower 
of London measures. Of all the STDT endpoints, only the Two Shape Total Errors showed a statistically 
significant difference for the safinamide 50-mg/day versus placebo comparison, but not for the 
safinamide 100-mg/day group. 
Several of the other secondary endpoints did show statistically significant differences for the safinamide 
100-mg/day group versus placebo comparison. These included the following: CPTF - Proportion correct all 
conditions, Sum Correct Congruent, Sum Correct Incongruent, Sum Correct Neutral, Pr and Proportion 
incorrect all conditions. These differences were not seen in the safinamide 50 mg/day versus placebo 
comparisons. 
Sensitivity analyses  
In general the ancillary analyses gave the same picture. Two observations are worth mentioning:  
- 
In the MOTION study region appeared to be a relevant factor in the primary analyses as a 
subgroup analyses based on region showed statistical significant results for West-Europe, but 
reverse outcomes  for Eastern-Europe:   
Table 11 Results by region in the MOTION study 
- Further, in retrospective it was discovered that 11 subjects in the MOTION study used two DA-agonists 
instead of one at baseline, which was considered as a violation of the inclusion criteria.  Post-hoc 
exclusion of these subjects from the analysis resulted in a statistically significant difference in favour of 
the 100 mg/day dose group (see Table 12):

Study 017 
Methods 
Study 017 concerned an extension of study 015 for another 12 months. Patients of study 015 who were 
willing to enter study 017 remained in their original study arm. Placebo and double blinding was 
maintained.  Anti-Parkinson co-medication could be adapted. The dose of the DA-agonist could be 
increased or decreased, and L-Dopa, a second DA-agonist or any other Anti-Parkinson medication could 
be added, throughout the study.  
Primary efficacy endpoint was time to Intervention, i.e. the time from first administration of the study 
medication to change in background Parkinson co-medication defined as an increase in the dose of 
DA-agonist as compared to baseline or addition of another DA-agonist, Levodopa, or some other 
anti-Parkinson medication or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Secondary endpoints were the same 
as in study 015.  
All statistical analyses were performed for pooled data of the two safinamide dose groups (50-100 mg and 
100-200) mg. For the primary endpoint, a Cox regression model was applied, adjusting for explanatory 
variables in this model like treatment, duration of Parkinson’s disease, H&Y stage, region, baseline UPDRS 
score, gender and age.  
The secondary endpoints that were analyzed for a selected group - patients randomized at baseline of the 
prior Study 015, but did not continue the extension study 017, were excluded from these analyses.    
Results 
The retention rates were high, i.e. 76.6%, 88.9% and 86.7% of the subjects on 50-100 mg/day, 100-200 
mg/day or placebo in study 015 entered study 017. 
For time to Intervention, there was no significant difference between active treatmentand placebo. A 
Kaplan-Meier curve is presented in the next Figure 4. The median time to intervention was 559 days for 
the pooled safinamide groups versus 466 days in the placebo group (p-value Log Rank Test 0.3342).

Figure 4 Primary endpoint Study 017: Free of Intervention 
For the secondary endpoints also none of the differences were statistically significant in the pooled 
safinamide analyses.  The rate of interventions was 39.7% in the Safinamide group, versus 47.8% in the 
Placebo group (difference 8.1%, 95% CI -20.4, 4.3) 
Retrospectively in the evaluation of time to intervention, it was suggested that the Hazard Ratio of 0.83 
(CI 95% = 0.57-1.21) was not constant throughout the period. Moreover, the event rate was much lower 
than expected in both groups. Therefore, so-called Landmark analyses were performed. The follow-up 
time was split into two time-windows for which the proportional hazard assumption was supposed to hold 
i.e. 0-240 and 240-540 days. Moreover the study arms were analyzed separately.  
There was no significant difference in the proportion of interventions in the 50-100 mg/day dose group for 
the first 240 days. For the 50-100 mg dose group, there was a lower rate (25%) of intervention as 
compared to placebo (51%) in the period from 240 to 540 days ( p value < 0.05, Cox Regression Model). 
The landmark analyses for the 100-200 mg/day dose group was inconclusive (Figure 5).

For the secondary endpoints, additional analyses (Mixed Linear Analysis for High and Low Dose groups 
separately) were done for Responder Rates, using two additional definitions (> 20% and > 30% 
improvement in UPDRS III (Figure 6).  
Figure  6 Post-hoc analyses Mixed  Linear  Analyses  of Responder  Rates  (>  20%  and  >  30%  improvement  in

Finally the UPDRS I-IV, CGI, and Quality of Life (QOL) were analyzed for each subgroup separately, using 
both Mixed Linear Analysis and ANCOVA (LOCF) for the following categories:  
“ON Treatment” - Analysis: patient’s data are censored at the time of rescue medication intake 
(Intervention); 
“ON and OFF Treatment” - Analysis: all available data are analyzed, regardless of rescue medication 
intake (Intervention).

The main studies to support this indication are study 016 and the SETTLE study. In addition, there was 
double-blind extension of Study 016 i.e. Study 018 which is presented separately.

2.7.2.2.1.  Study 016 and the  SETTLE study 
Both studies concerned a randomised, multi-centre, multinational, placebo-controlled, multiple dose, 
parallel-group study in patients with Parkinson’s disease with motor fluctuations. Duration of the double 
blind was 24 weeks. Safinamide was given on top of L-dopamine, with or without or other anti-Parkinson 
medication. Total number of subjects was 669 in Study 016, and 549 in the SETTLE study. Main difference 
between Study 016 an the SETTLE Study was that in Study 016 there were two fixed dose arms 
(safinamide 50 mg/day, safinamide 100 mg/day),  whereas  in the SETTLE Study there was a flexible dose 
range 50-100 mg/day.  
Main inclusion criteria concerned  patients between 30-80 years of age, with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD 
of more than at least 5 years (study 16) or 3 years  (SETTTLE), a Hoehn and Yahr stage of I-IV during an 
OFF phase, and motor fluctuations with >1.5 hours of OFF time during the day. Patient must have been 
receiving treatment with a stable dose of L-dopa (3-10 doses per day of any L-dopa preparation) and may 
have been receiving concomitant treatment with stable doses of a DA-agonist and/or an anticholinergic 
and/or amantadine and/or a COMT inhibitor at the screening visit.  
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable in both studies was the change in daily ON time without troublesome 
dyskinesia at 6 months.  
An OFF phase was defined as lack of mobility (bradykinesia, or akinesia), whereas in an ON phase, the 
patient was functioning as well as can be expected for that patient, irrespective of whether he or she was 
having dyskinesias. This information was collected on the diary on the 5 days (study 016) or 3 days 
(SETTLE) preceding the scheduled visit, and the last 2 days of recording were used for data analysis 
purposes. 
The main secondary endpoints concerned responder (30% improvement in ON-time),  decrease in total 
daily OFF time,  change in UPDRS-III score in the ON-phase, CGI-C responder rates, Cogtest , UPDRS-II, 
DRS (Dyskinesia Rating Scale) score during ON-time, change in PDQ-39 score (a physical and mental 
functioning score specifically designed for Parkinson’s disease), EQ-5D (a QOL scale) , and L-dopa dose.   
Study 016:  
Analyses of the primary endpoint 
The primary analysis set in study 016 was the ITT population. The primary efficacy variable was analyzed 
using a mixed linear model with treatment, center and the treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects 
and baseline ON time as a covariate.  
The multiplicity issue for treatment groups was handled by using a sequence of comparisons approach. 
The safinamide 100-mg/day group was tested first, and only if there was a significant difference 
compared with the placebo group was the safinamide 50 mg/day group versus the placebo group to be 
tested.  
Sensitivity analyses using two mixed linear model analyses were performed on the ITT population: 
ON-treatment analysis and ON-and-OFF treatment analysis. In the ON-treatment approach, patients’ 
data were censored at the time of rescue medication intake or occurrence of RDO. In the ON-OFF 
approach, all available data were analyzed regardless of the intake of rescue medication and included 
RDO data. Rescue medication was defined as an increase in the total daily dose of the background PD 
therapy by 20% or the addition of a new anti-Parkinsonian medication.

Analyses of the secondary endpoints 
The secondary efficacy variables were evaluated in a hierarchical manner. Each of the variables was 
analyzed sequentially as long as a significant difference between the safinamide 100 mg/day group 
versus the placebo group was detected. If the difference between the safinamide 100 mg/day and placebo 
groups was not statistically significant for a particular variable, statistical tests on subsequent variables 
were performed only to obtain nominal p-values, but not for hypothesis testing. Analyses were performed 
on the ITT population, using the on-treatment approach and with LOCF imputation of missing data. The 
secondary efficacy analysis included the following parameters, ordered according to the hierarchical 
analysis approach decrease in total daily OFF time, as measured in the diary card—change from Baseline 
to endpoint, UPDRS III at ON, CGI–C, Change in cognition Cogtest, Decrease in mean OFF time following 
first morning dose of levodopa, Improvement in the DRS at ON, UPDRS II at ON, CGI-S and mean 
percentage change in levodopa dose. 
SETTLE:  
Analyses of the primary endpoint 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint (daily ON time) was performed based on the ITT Population 
using the On-Treatment Approach. This primary endpoint was analysed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model on the change from baseline to Week 24, with treatment and region effects and the 
baseline value of the daily ON time as the covariate.  
In addition to the primary analysis with the ANCOVA main model, supportive analysis using a mixed 
effects repeated measures model (MMRM was used to evaluate treatment, time, and treatment-by time 
interaction effects on the change from baseline to post baseline visits in daily ON time. Other sensitivity 
analyses of the primary endpoint were performed based on a combination of the analysis population (ITT, 
MITT, Completer, or Per Protocol), the analysis approach (On-Treatment or Observed Case), and the 
statistical modelling approach (ANCOVA or MMRM)  
Analyses of the secondary endpoints 
Testing of the key secondary efficacy analyses was performed in a hierarchical fashion i.e. daily OFF time, 
UPDRS III score in ON, UPDRS-II in ON, CGI-C-improvers and change in PDQ-39 score. Each of the above 
key efficacy endpoints was analyzed sequentially as long as a significant difference between the 
safinamide group versus placebo group was seen. The same ANCOVA model used for the continuous 
secondary clinical parameters with the baseline value as a single covariate. CGI-C-responders were 
analysed using a logistic regression model with treatment and region effects. 
Results study 016 /SETTLE study 
Population  
Study 016 (Table 14) was conducted at 35 sites in India, 7 sites in Italy, and 10 sites in Romania, with a 
target enrollment of 18 patients per center.  
The SETTLE study was conducted at study centers in India, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, 
Estonia, Slovakia, Canada, the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, 
Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.  
In the next Table 14 the number of subjects, participant flow, main baseline features of study 016 and the 
SETTLE study are presented.  
Mean age was about 60 years and duration of Parkinson’s disease ranged from 8-9 years. Patients were 
in an ON phase about half of the waking time of 18 hours. OFF phase was about 5 hours.  There was no 
apparent difference in distribution of baseline features over the study arms

Primary outcomes, Study 016 and SETTLE Study 
In study 016, the mean total daily ON time without troublesome dyskinesia over 18 hours increased over 
time for each of the 3 treatment groups. At the end of the study at week 24 the mean change from 
Baseline was 0.97 (SD 2.38) hours for the placebo group, 1.37 (SD 2.75) hours for the safinamide 50 
mg/day group, and 1.36 (SD 2.63) hours for the safinamide 100 mg/day group, respectively. The mean 
change from baseline was 0.72 hours for placebo, 1.23 hours for safinamide 50 mg/day and 1.28 hours 
for safinamide 100 mg/day.  Difference versus placebo was statistically significant for both dose groups 
i.e. 0.51(95% CI 0.07, 0.94)  hours for the safinamide 50 mg/day group [p = 0.023] and 0.55 (95% CI 
0.12, 0.99)  hours for the safinamide 100 mg/day group [p = 0.013]). For details see Table 15 below.  
In the SETTLE study the mean total daily ON time without troublesome dyskinesia over 18 hours 
increased over time for both placebo and treatment groups.  At week 24, the mean change from baseline 
was 0.56 (SE 0.15) hours for the placebo group and 1.52 hours for the (0.15) hours for the safinamide 
100 mg/day group. Difference versus placebo was statistical significant i.e. 0.96 hours for the safinamide 
100 mg/day group [p < 0.001].

Secondary outcomes Study 016 and SETTLE Study 
The OFF time decreased by 0.5 and 1.00 hour in study 016 and the SETTLE study, respectively. There is 
a statistically significant but slight improvement in UPDRS-III in the ON phase. Dyskinesia score in the ON 
phase did not improve. Responder rates are in favour of active treatment, although responder rates 
according to diverse post-hoc definitions (e.g. of >30 minutes improvement of ON-time), were mostly 
statistically significant.  
In Study 016, statistically significant (p=0.006) improvement (-2.2) was observed for the UPDRS II (ON 
phase) for the safinamide 100 mg/day group compared to placebo (-1.2). The proportion of patients rated 
as improved on the CGI-C was significantly greater in the safinamide 50 mg/day (66.4%, p=0.001) and 
100 mg/day (64.3%, p=0.009) groups, compared to placebo (55.4%). There were no statistically 
significant differences among the treatment groups in the mean change in Dyskinesia Rating Scale scores 
during ON phase, H&Y stage, HAMD, MMSE and Cogtest outcomes in study 016. Neither were UPDRSII 
scores significant for the 50 mg arm. 
In the SETTLE study statistically significant improvements in health-related quality of life and functioning, 
as assessed by the PDQ-39 and EQ-5D scales, were observed. For the UPDRS Section II, DRS and 
GRID-HAMD, there was no significant difference between groups in the change from baseline in total 
score. 
A post-hoc analysis of “responders”, demonstrated that treatment with safinamide 50 mg/day or 100 
mg/day was associated with a statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects, compared to 
placebo, experiencing clinically meaningful benefit, as defined below.

Based on these two trials, the Applicant concluded that safinamide at doses of 50 and 100 mg, was able 
to improve ON time and motor symptoms in mid- to late-stage PD patients on L-dopa therapy, without 
worsening dyskinesia.  
Study 018. 
Study 018 concerned a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month extension study of Study 016, where 
the efficacy and safety of safinamide 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day as add-on therapy to levodopa with or 
without other anti-Parkinson medication, was further evaluated for another 18 months in patients with 
motor fluctuations.  In total, from baseline of Study 016 on, the study duration was 24 months.  
Patients of study 016 willingly to enter study 018 remained in the same treatment group to which they 
were randomized in originally. The double blind was maintained.  
In total 78.8%, 84.8% and 80.3% of the subjects of the subjects who were randomized to placebo, 50 
mg/day and 100 mg/day in Study 016, entered study 018. Sixty-four percent, 64.3% and 67.0% of the 
subjects on placebo, 50 mg-day or 100 mg-day originally randomized in study 016 completed study 018. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in the Dyskinesia Rating Scale (DRS) during ON time 
from baseline (Study 016) to the endpoint (last visit in study 018)  
For all 3 treatment groups, the median duration of treatment was 2.0 years (016 and 018 combined).  The 
mean days of exposure were 674.4 days (range 166 to 842) for the placebo group, 647.1 days (range, 
134 to 814) for the safinamide 50 mg/day group and 679.0 days (range, 147 to 889) for the safinamide 
100 mg/day group. 
After a total of 24 months, a non-statistically significant mean improvement of –0. 51 and - 0.28 point 
was observed for safinamide 50 mg / daily dose and 100 mg/day as compared to placebo (see Table 16):

The Applicant argues that the trend for a DRS improvement in both the safinamide groups and the 
opposite trend i.e. DRS worsening observed for placebo, indicates efficacy.  
Post-hoc defined sub-group analyses in 32% of the patients, who presented moderate-to-severe 
dyskinesia at baseline (i.e. DRS score > 4), revealed a statistically significant difference for the 
Safinamide 100 mg/day group vs. placebo in the mean change from baseline of DRS score (p= 0.03). 
The results for the key secondary measures in study 018 are summarized in the next Table 17.  
Table 17 Study 018 summary secondary endpoints 
In conclusion, a significant effect on ON time was maintained at the end of the 24-month extension period 
for both safinamide doses compared to placebo. For the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups, p-values were 
respectively; p=0.0031 and p=0.0002. Hence, after 2 years of treatment, no worsening in ON time with 
troublesome dyskinesia or minor dyskinesia was observed.

Design 
This study was a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in patients with idiopathic PD 
with motor fluctuations, who were receiving a stable dose of levodopa. 
The total duration of the study was approximately 30 weeks, including the 
Screening period (10 days), a levodopa stabilization phase (4 weeks), the 
treatment period (24 weeks), and an optional 1-week taper phase. Eligible 
patients could receive treatment with either safinamide or placebo for a total of 
24 weeks. Patients who met the entry criteria at Baseline were randomized 
(1:1:1) to receive 1 of the 2 doses of safinamide or placebo.

Primary Analysis 
The analysis of the primary endpoint (daily ON time) was performed using a LOCF 
imputation and an ANCOVA model for the ON Treatment population (ITT population with 
censoring of data post rescue intervention). The population consisted of PD patients with 
at least 1.5 hours of daily OFF time, disease duration of at least 3 years, minimally 3 daily 
doses of L-dopa, a Hoehn and Yahr stage of 1-4 during an OFF phase, and the ability to 
maintain an 18-hour per day diary.

2.7.2.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis): 
For early stage PD (ESPD), pooled analyses were performed in the mITT population during the 
procedure. See the Table 23, Table 24 and Table 25 below. Only patients that had used a 50 or 100 mg 
dose were selected. The differences in dosing schedule (per mg/kg) and the short treatment duration of 
Study 009 (12 weeks) should not allow for pooling with the other trials (015 and MOTION, both 24 weeks 
trials). The pooling of MOTION and Study 015 would seem more rational, but still the dosing regimen was 
different in these two Phase III studies, rendering the value of the pooled data as exploratory only.

Table 25 Pooled ESPD Studies 009, 015, 27918 (MOTION): Responder Analyses for Clinical Global Impression 
of Change (CGI-C)  (mITT and Completer Populations) 
For late stage PD (LSPD), i.e. patients on levodopa with motor fluctuations, additional analyses were 
performed to compare the proportion of LSPD patients in the safinamide 50 and 100 mg/day dose groups 
vs. placebo that exhibit a clinically meaningful response to treatment. Clinically meaningful effects were 
defined using a series of responders definitions based on categorical changes from baseline to endpoint 
for ON time, OFF time, UPDRS III, PDQ-39, as well as the rating of change from baseline at endpoint on 
the CGI-Change (CGI-C). The responder analyses evaluated safinamide doses of 50 and 100 mg/day 
separately.  
Logistic regression analyses comparing proportions of responders were performed on the mITT 
population using data pooled from studies 016 and SETTLE. P-values from the analyses were based on 
Chi-square tests of the odds ratios of each safinamide treatment group compared to placebo, using a 
logistic regression model, with fixed effects of treatment and study.  
The results of these analyses are summarized below in Table 26:

Table 26 Responder Rates by Treatment Group - Late Stage PD - mITT Population 
The safinamide 100 mg/day dose showed a consistent pattern of statistically significant improvement 
compared to placebo, regarding categorical response in ON and/or OFF time, dyskinesia, PDQ-39 or 
UPDRS III and clinical global assessments performed by the physician (CGI-C). Although the proportions 
of responders in the 50 mg/day dose group were similar to those for the 100 mg/day dose, no statistical 
significance was achieved for the majority of the secondary endpoints. This lack of significance might be 
related to the lower number of patients in the 50 mg/day dose (n=236) compared with the 100 mg/day 
dose (n=467)). Moreover, the majority of patients in the 50 mg/day group came from Study 016, where 
the change from baseline was much smaller. 
2.7.2.5.  Supportive study(ies)  
Study 024 was a Phase II randomised, placebo-controlled exploratory multi-centre trial on the effect of 
safinamide 100 mg/day on cognitive functioning in 103 Parkinson patients with mild cognitive impairment 
on a stable treatment with other dopaminergic medicines. Mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment Total 
Score was 22.6 (SD 2.79) at baseline, indicating mild impairment (a final total score of 26 and above is 
considered normal). The primary efficacy parameter was the change from Baseline to Endpoint (Week 12 
or early discontinuation) in the total score for the Parkinson’s Disease Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS). 
The mean improvement from Baseline to Endpoint was similar between the two treatment groups. At 
Endpoint, the safinamide group had a mean (SD) change of 2.1 (7.37), and the placebo group of 2.4 
(7.64). The LS mean (SE) difference between the safinamide and placebo groups was -0.20 (1.547); this 
difference was not statistically significant (p=0.8969). Secondary endpoints of mood, sleep, and 
behaviour (including apathy) did not show an effect.  
Although there are some shortcomings in this study, e.g. its short duration and the fact that patients were 
only mildly cognitively impaired leaving little room for improvement, it could be concluded that

safinamide has no significant impact on cognitive functioning in the short term. This was also further 
confirmed in the main trials, where safinamide did not significantly change the scores of a cognition test 
battery in the longer term follow-up (6 months).  
2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
2.7.3.1.  Early Parkinson Disease 
2.7.3.1.1.  Design and conduct of clinical studies, efficacy data and additional analyses 
In support of the sought indication of “add-on therapy to a single DA-agonist at a stable dose in early 
stage non-fluctuating patients”, results of three randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
studies were provided: Study 009, Study 015 and the MOTION study. In addition, Study 017, a long term 
extension study of Study 015 was provided, wherein the blind and placebo-control was maintained till 18 
months.  
In Study 009, both treatment naïve patients and patients on treatment with DA-agonist were equally 
randomised to either safinamide 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg or placebo. Primary endpoint was ≥ 30% 
improvement in the UPDRS III motor symptoms at 12 weeks. Although the results from study 009 
indicated an effect for the 1 mg/kg dose (responder rate was significantly better than placebo – 37.5% vs 
21.4%), this was not considered as sufficient evidence to support the sought after indication. The study 
was small and its duration of 3 months was too short to provide robust evidence of efficacy on its own.   
In Study 015, 269 patients on stable level of DA-agonists without motor fluctuations, were randomised 
to either low dose safinamide (50-100 mg), high dose safinamide (150-200mg) or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. 
Primary outcome for study 015 was the change in UPDRS-III motor score at week 24 as compared to 
baseline. Formally, study 015 did not meet its primary objectives, as hypotheses testing should have 
been stopped, according to the pre-specified hierarchical testing schedule, because of the non-significant 
results for the 150-200 mg dose group (-3.9 vs -3.6 for placebo, p=0.06504). Thus, the results of this 
study remained inconclusive even if the difference in the lower dose group came out to be statistically 
significant.   
In addition to the methodological limitations, the effect size observed was small and was not considered 
to be of clinical relevance. The postulated effect size in the sample size calculations i.e. a difference of -3.3 
points is generally perceived as clinically relevant. This value is much larger than the observed difference 
of -1.9 points for the lower dose group. Moreover this difference did not translate into a beneficial effect 
in terms of UPDRS-III responder rates and CGI responders’ rates, two secondary endpoints that are 
commonly used to assess clinical relevance of an effect on the primary endpoint in Parkinson’s Disease.  
Overall, based on the study 015 results, conclusions on the efficacy of safinamide as add-on to 
dopamine-agonist monotherapy in early Parkinson disease could not be drawn as the methodological 
soundness and the clinical relevance were questioned.  
The MOTION study was a randomised double-blind placebo controlled study in 679 patients with early 
Parkinson’s Disease on dopamine-agonist monotherapy. Primary endpoint was the mean improvement 
from baseline UPDRS-III score. The MOTION study was an important study considering that it was large 
and included a substantial number of EU participants (45%). 
The observed differences versus placebo (UPDRS III Score difference safinamide 50/100 mg -1.6 and 
-1.9, placebo -0.95, P= 0.27 and P=0.07 respectively) were not statistically significant for the primary 
endpoint and for the responder results. A small, but statistically significant effect (-2.09, P=0.04) in the 
primary endpoint was achieved in post-hoc analyses excluding subjects who used two DA-agonists at

baseline, but the inclusion of subjects on two DA-agonists raised additional concerns about the study 
conduct as these subjects should not have been enrolled based on the inclusion criteria.   
In conclusion, the MOTION study appeared to provide similar results to those from study 015 and the 
clinical relevance of the observed effects was questioned for the same reason as put forward for study 
015. 
In the double-blind extension Study 017, subjects from Study 015 could continue their originally 
allocated study medication for another 12 months. The study was kept blind. Primary outcome was time 
to intervention defined by a change in treatment i.e. either an increase in dose of the background 
DA-agonist or addition of further concomitant anti-Parkinson medication.  
The results of study 017 were considered inconclusive by the CHMP since the low event rate and the 
prolonged median time to intervention of more than one-year questioned the sensitivity for change in this 
population. The results suggested that the Parkinson’s disease population that had been included were 
early stage well-controlled patients. However, whether this good control was achieved due to the 
dopamine-agonist used, due to the addition of safinamide, or due to the patients being in a mild stage of 
the disease with slow progression of symptoms, was impossible to determine. 
Considering the results from the pivotal trials, it was difficult to draw a conclusion regarding the optimal 
dose as no clear dose-response relationship could be established.  The company did not investigate the 
reasons for the lack of dose effect relationship, which apparently was present in study 009.  Some effect 
was observed in the 100 mg-day dose group (Study 015, MOTION study), but neither the 50 mg (MOTION 
study) nor the 200 mg /day (Study 015) where convincingly shown to be effective.  
During the assessment the applicant provided a standardised analysis for all individual studies in EPSD as 
well as pooled analyses of the studies. A more consistent treatment effect on the UPDRSR-III, in terms of 
statistical significance, was seen for the 100 mg/day in the combined analysis (studies 009/15/M0TION or 
015/MOTION – UPDRS III difference vs PBO was -1.2; P= 0.0003). However, the pooling of studies 
009/015/MOTION was considered inappropriate as the doses and dosing regimens used, as well as the 
duration of treatment, were different. 
In addition to the methodological limitations, in the MMRM analyses in the newly defined mITT 
populations, a significant effect was shown for UPDRS III at the 100 mg dose in all 3 studies (Study 009 
(n=33 included); change from baseline (p-values, CI not reported): -2.3 (p=0.0182), Study 015 (n=87 
included): -0.9 (p=0.0442), MOTION trial (n=227): -0.3 (p=0.0374). No significant effect was shown for 
the 50 mg dose in these post-hoc analyses. These outcomes are considerable smaller than what was 
defined a priori as a clinical relevant response of UPDRS III motor scores in the protocol (MOTION: 2.7, 
Study 015: -3.3). The observed changes in UPDRS III motor scores were not consistently supported by a 
significant improvement in daily functioning (UPDRS II ADL scores), illustrating that the clinical relevance 
of the change in motor scores was questionable.  
The increased statistical significance shown in the presented pooled data analysis did not address the 
issue about the clinical relevance of the results.  The observed effect sizes were considered small. In the 
pooled analysis  of the two pivotal studies in ESPD (015 & MOTION) the improvement in the UPDRS-III 
score was 2.0 points for the placebo group (baseline 20.1 points) and 3.0 points for the safinamide 100 
mg/day group (difference 1.0 CI 95% -1.6 ; -0.3, p=0.007). The applicant argued that for an add-on 
treatment to a dopamine-agonist, in this patient population, showing a greater effect size would be a high 
hurdle. Indeed it was recognized that there could be several arguments to expect less efficacy gains in 
this population, the question remained though, whether the observed additional effect was still clinically 
relevant and worth achieving. In both studies (study 015, MOTION) the predefined effect size, indicated 
as relevant in the power analysis, was not met. The results of the various responder analyses, including 
Assessment report

CGI-C responders were not consistent.  Differences in responder rates were rather small and never 
exceeded the 10%. Moreover within CGI-responders the percentage of subjects that improved much/very 
much was rather low with a difference in responder rate of 5%.  
In summary the promising results of the phase II study 009 could not be replicated in the broader 
Parkinson Disease population receiving dopamine agonists and both pivotal studies performed in early 
stage PD patients were considered as failed. This was because the methodological issues in the way the 
primary analysis results were achieved and because the clinical relevance of the additional observed 
effect of safinamide on top of dopamine–agonist treatment remained questionable. The pooled data 
analysis improved the statistical significance of the results but did not address the clinical relevance issue. 
Additionally, the principles according to which the pooled analysis was performed were questioned from 
a methodological point of view.   
2.7.3.2.  Late stage Parkinson Disease indication, Add-on to L-dopa  
2.7.3.2.1.  Design and conduct of clinical studies, Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In support of the sought indication of “as add-on to L-dopa, alone or in combination with other PD 
medication, in mid- to late-stage PD patients with motor fluctuations”, data of two 24-week, randomised, 
parallel, double blind, placebo-controlled studies were provided, i.e. Study 016 and the SETTLE study. 
Patients with Parkinson’s disease with motor fluctuations despite treatment with L-dopa -with or without 
other PD treatments, like anticholinergics, amantadine, DA-agonists or COMT inhibitors were eligible. 
Both studies lacked an active comparator. The primary endpoint was change in daily ON time without 
troublesome dyskinesias at 24 weeks, as recorded in the patient’s diary.  
The main difference between the pivotal trials in support of the late stage PD indication was that in Study 
016 and 018 there were two fixed dose arms (safinamide 50 mg/day, safinamide 100 mg/day) whereas 
in the SETTLE there was a flexible dose range 50-100 mg/day. However the majority of subjects in the 
SETLLE Study received and maintained the 100 mg daily dose. Another difference is that Study 016 was 
predominantly conducted in India (80%), whereas the SETTLE study was global.  
In addition, Study 018, the long-term extension study of study 016 was performed, wherein the blinding 
and placebo-control was maintained for another 18 months till a total duration of 24 months. 
Total number of subjects was 669 and 549 for Study 016 and the SETTLE Study, respectively. The 
measured baseline ON time ranged from 9.06 to 9.52 hours over the study arms.  
In study 016, the mean change from baseline to Week 24 of the ON-time without troublesome 
dyskinesias (primary endpoint) was 0.72, 1.23 and 1.28 hour for placebo, safinamide 50 mg and 100 mg, 
respectively. Differences versus placebo were 0.51 (CI95% 0.07; 0.9, p=0.0223) and 0.55 hours (CI95% 
0.12; 0.99, p=0.013) for the 50 mg and 100 mg safinamide dose, respectively.  
In the SETTLE study, ON time without troublesome dyskinesias at Week 24 improved by 0.56 and 1.52 
hours for placebo and safinamide 50-100 mg/dose group, respectively. Difference versus placebo was 
0.96 hrs (CI95% 0.56; 1.37; p <0.001).  
For both studies the observed effects in ON time were reflected in a reciprocal decrease in OFF-time.  
In general, the effects on secondary endpoints were consistent with the main results. Several post-hoc 
defined responders rates, e.g. 30 minutes improvement in ON time (without increase in dyskinesia) and 
OFF time were in favour of the 100 mg dose groups (i.e. 40.1 % for Placebo versus and 51.8% in 
safinamide 100mg group in Study 016, whereas no significant difference was achieved for the 50 mg dose 
group.

Dyskinesia score in ON did not improve, which is expected as ON and dyskinesias are related.  
It may be argued that dyskinesia would have been expected to worsen if the dopaminergic tone increases.   
As no active comparator was included, the magnitude of the observed treatment effects is difficult to 
appreciate.  One of the factors providing reassurance on the relevance were the results of the responder 
analyses in late stage PD patients. Moreover efficacy of safinamide was favourable in the comparison to 
historical data of other treatments such as pramipexole or rasagiline. The improvements of 0.51h or 1h in 
ON time, respectively, were deemed clinically relevant in this population of advanced patients with 
motor-fluctuations, however the claims with respect to a beneficial effect on dyskinesias could not be 
substantiated by data. Another point of discussion was the heterogeneity of the outcomes between the 
two pivotal studies in late stage PD patients. The differences in point estimates between the pivotal 
studies (016/ SETTLE) fell within the variability seen in studies with other treatment options, and were 
considered as probably due to differences in the study populations.  
Study 018 was the 18-month extension phase of Study 016. Patients of study 016 willing to enter study 
018 remained in the same treatment group which they were randomized in originally and the blinding was 
maintained. From the 667 patients of Study 016, 544 continued their allocated study treatment in Study 
018. The median duration of treatment was 2.0 years from baseline of Study 016.   
For the primary endpoint i.e. mean change in dyskinesia score during ON-time, a worsening of 0.32 points 
was observed in the placebo group (baseline 3.4 points). For the safinamide 50 mg group an 
improvement of 0.19 points (baseline 3.9) was observed. For safinamide 100 mg/day a 0.28 points 
improvement (from baseline 3.7 points) was observed. These differences were not statistically significant. 
The applicant argued that the observed trend in dyskinesia score, i.e. an improvement in the 50 and 100 
mg/d arms versus a worsening in the placebo arm, was indicative for efficacy, but to make such a claim 
it was considered that further confirmatory data would be needed.  
Overall, the L-dopa dose increased by 18%, 10% and 5 % in the placebo, 50 mg and 100mg/day group, 
respectively, which further illustrated maintenance of efficacy regarding the effect on improvement of 
motor symptoms.   
2.7.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
2.7.4.1.  Early Parkinson Disease add-on to dopamine-agonists  
Efficacy of safinamide in the treatment of early Parkinson’s disease in an add-on setting to DA-agonists 
was considered as not established. 
Both pivotal studies performed in early stage PD patients were considered failed as the primary analysis 
results were not statistically significant, and the clinical relevance of the additional effect of safinamide 
given on top of dopamine–agonist treatment remained questionable. The pooled data analysis improved 
the statistical significance but did not address the clinical relevance issue.  The data in early stage PD 
patients was not sufficient both from methodological and clinical points of view. 
2.7.4.2.  Late stage Parkinson Disease Add-on to L-dopa  
A statistically significant and clinically relevant effect of safinamide was demonstrated in the add-on 
setting to L-dopa, and other PD medication in late stage patients.  For both studies providing the data in 
support of this indication the differences in the observed treatment effects were statistically significant, 
and a dose response relationship was shown. The change in concomitant anti-Parkinson medication was 
not large and was considered unlikely to be affecting the results. The clinical relevance of the effect could 
be concluded from the results of the responder analyses in late stage PD patients, and from the more

favourable effect shown in the indirect comparison to other treatments used in this setting. 
2.8.  Clinical safety 
The analysis of the safety of Safinamide is based on the results of 37 trials, comprising 20 phase I trials, 
9 phase II trials, and 8 phase III trials. All data collected to date are included in the analysis of safety. 
There were no ongoing trials at the time of MAA. 
The dossier included two patient population i.e. patients with early stage Parkinson’s disease (ESPD) on 
a single dopamine agonist and patients with mid/late stage Parkinson’s disease (LSPD) using a stable 
dose of L-dopa, alone or in combination with other medications for Parkinson’s disease. 
2.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The safety population data consisted of analyses sets i.e. group 1: Subjects in the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase II and III trials (pooling of controlled trials with ESPD and LSPD patients) and 
Group 2: Open-label trials: treatment results of study 28850 which concerned a long term safety 
extension study of Safinamide in ESPD and LSPD(n=964).  
The number of patient exposed and duration of exposure is presented below (Table 27).  In total, 3169 
study subjects participated in the clinical development program of Safinamide.

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) for placebo-controlled trials (Group 1) and open label trials 
(Group 2) are summarised by organ system below.  Adverse event of specific interest are presented 
thereafter.  
Late stage PD patients in group 1 experienced more overall adverse events (AEs) than early stage PD 
patients in Group 1 and patients of Group 2 i.e. 82.4% vs. 70.3% and 73.1% respectively.  The 
occurrence rates of adverse events were in general similar for safinamide doses for ESPD patients. In 
LSPD patients, adverse events tended to occur more often for dosages of 50 mg safinamide per day 
(88.5%) compared to 100 mg safinamide per day (79.3%). 
Serious adverse events occurred in 6.9% of ESPD patients on safinamide treatment and in 5.0% of these 
patients on placebo treatment. For LSPD patients, these rates were 12.9% and 11.5% respectively. In 
ESPD patients, withdrawal due to side effects was 3.9% for a dosage of 50mg safinamide/day, 5.4% for 
100mg safinamide/day and 6.7% for 150-200mg safinamide/day. For LSPD patients these rates were 
9.1% for 50mg safinamide/day and 6.1% for 100mg safinamide/day. Mortality was <1% for ESPD 
patients. The mortality in LSPD patients who received 50mg and 100mg safinamide per day was 2.5% 
and 1.5% respectively.

Adverse events of special interest:  
2.8.2.1.  Nervous system disorders 
Approximately 30% of Group 1 ESPD patients and patients in open label studies experienced nervous 
system disorders, compared to 40-50% of Group 1 LSPD patients. With respect to ESPD patients, the 
occurrence of adverse events tended to increase with the dose (27.3% for 50mg safinamide; 32.6% for 
150-200mg safinamide), while a reverse effect has been observed for LSPD patients (59.7% for 50mg 
safinamide; 42.3% for 100mg safinamide). 
The most frequently (≥5%) observed AEs in ESPD patients were dizziness, headache, and somnolence. 
For LSPD patients, dyskinesias, headache, and tremor were observed most frequently. The occurrence of 
dyskinesias and headache tended to decrease with increasing safinamide dose. The occurrence of 
dyskinesias was much lower for ESPD patients (0-0.2%) compared to LSPD patients (12.9-31.3%).

2.8.2.2.  Psychiatric symptoms 
15-20% of ESPD and LSPD patients experienced psychiatric adverse events. The general occurrence rates 
for both ESPD and LSPD patients tended to decrease with increasing safinamide dose.  
Except for insomnia and anxiety, other psychiatric adverse events occurred in less than 5% of patients. 
The most frequently observed psychiatric symptoms were hallucinations, insomnia, depression, and 
anxiety. Impulse-control disorders, obsessive thoughts, compulsions and increased libido were hardly 
found in the Safinamide development program (< 0.5%).

Safinamide also was not associated with an increase in impulsive/compulsive behavior, as assessed by 
the QUIP (Parkinson's Disease Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders Questionnaire, a self-administered 
questionnaire specifically designed to assess the severity of symptoms of impulse control disorders (e.g. 
pathological gambling, buying, eating, and sexual behaviour) in patients with Parkinson’s disease. The 
QUIP was performed in two studies: Study 27918 (MOTION) and 27919 (SETTLE). Data analysed from 
overall Group 1 safety population of MOTION and SETTLE showed that changes from baseline in the QUIP 
scale were similar in the safinamide and placebo groups.

Among all subjects who received safinamide, 272 subjects (74.5%) showed no compulsive behaviour at 
baseline, as evaluated by the QUIP Scale; 49 subjects (13.4%) displayed one act of a compulsive 
behaviour and 44 subjects (12.1%) displayed 2 or more acts of compulsive behaviour at baseline. 
Post-baseline evaluations indicated no significant changes, showing that 55 subjects (15.1%) had one act 
of a compulsive behaviour and 46 (12.6%) displayed 2 or more acts of compulsive behaviour as worst 
post-baseline values. 
The incidence is similar to placebo patients. Similar shifts from baseline to worst post-baseline 
evaluations were observed in safinamide treatment groups, to those seen in the placebo group.

Between 22- 29% of the patients experienced gastro-intestinal adverse events. Nausea and constipation 
were the most common gastro-intestinal adverse events. The numeric occurrence rate of nausea was 
higher for ESPD patients (6.2-10.1%) compared to LSPD patients (4.1-6.5%). About 4.3% of the patients 
from Group 2 experienced nausea. For both ESPD and LSPD patients, nausea was more likely to occur 
with increasing dosages of safinamide. The same applies to vomiting. By contrast, diarrhoea was 
experienced less frequently with increasing doses of safinamide in both ESPD and LSPD patients. 
Constipation was experienced by 5-8.2% of LSPD patients compared to less than 5% of ESPD patients.

The higher occurrence rate of constipation among LSPD patients compared to ESPD patients probably 
partly reflects a disease-associated higher occurrence rate of constipation in LSPD.  
2.8.2.5.  Cardiovascular adverse events 
The occurrence of vascular disorders increased with the dose in ESPD patients (6.4% for 50mg 
Safinamide; 13.5% for 100mg Safinamide). This applies to both hypertension and orthostatic 
hypotension.   
The occurrence of orthostatic hypotension increases with increasing doses of Safinamide (2.1% for 50mg 
Safinamide; 2.5% for 100mg Safinamide). A reverse trend was observed for the occurrence of 
hypertension (8.2% for 50mg Safinamide; 4.8% for 100mg Safinamide). Arrhythmia and bradycardia 
occurred in less than 0.5% of patients.

Adverse events with an occurrence rate of ≥5% have been underlined 
Although the incidence of bradycardia and arrhythmia as adverse events was slightly higher in the active 
treatment arms as compared to placebo, there was no clear signal of abnormalities from the ECGs,  which 
were routinely monitored in the therapeutic clinical trials. There was no evidence of effect of safinamide 
on ECGs from the therapeutic clinical trials. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 
healthy subjects (trial 28559) the effects of Safinamide (100 and 350mg) on the QT/QTc interval have 
been investigated with Moxifloxacine (400mg) as a positive control. Safinamide was not associated with 
QTc prolongation in this trial. By contrast, in both the Moxifloxacin and supratherapeutic Safinamide 
group a mild PR shortening was observed (<4 msec for both groups). This level of effect, if caused by the 
drug, was considered of no clinical relevance.

2.8.2.6.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
For ESPD, the occurrence of skin and subcutaneous disorders decreased with increasing Safinamide 
dosage (50mg 11.7%; 150-200mg 4.5%). For LSPD patients, the occurrence rate was similar for 50 and 
100mg Safinamide: 11.5%. These rates were higher compared to placebo (9.9%).  
In the open label studies 10% of patients experienced skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. In this 
patient group, one patient experienced a melanoma. In the double-blind placebo-controlled trials none of 
the patients experienced melanoma.  
2.8.2.7.  Ocular adverse events 
In repeated-dose studies with Safinamide in rats retinal degeneration has been observed. In the chronic 
studies, these retinal alterations progressed to a stage where the outer nuclear layer disappeared and 
changes to the pigment epithelium. Loss of nuclei from the inner nuclear layer was also present. The 
lowest dose producing retinal atrophy was 15mg/kg/day. Thus far, these changes have not been noted in 
any human or non-human primate species in which ocular investigations have been performed. 
Once the potential of retinal degeneration had been observed, it was decided to introduce ocular 
investigations for the patients enrolled in the safinamide development program. Ocular examinations 
included: visual acuity, LogMAR assessment (chart to determine visual acuity), colour vision examination, 
funduscopy assessment, visual field assessment, global impression score of ocular function, occurrence of 
ocular TEAEs, ocular coherence tomography (OCT), and electroretinograms (ERG). The extent to which 
this was done differed between studies and research sites. Ocular images were assessed centrally by a 
neuro-ophthalmologist. 
As represented in  the next Table 37, 30 retinal degeneration was observed in 2.2% of ESPD patients 
treated with 150-200mg per day in Study 017, in which there were no baseline ocular assessments. 
Retinal degeneration has not been observed in other ESPD patients. Retinal degeneration (LSPD patients) 
was observed in 2.1% of patients treated with 50mg safinamide per day and in 0.2% of patients who 
received 100mg safinamide per day. Also one placebo-treated patient experienced retinal degeneration 
(0.2% from the Placebo group).  
Cataract occurred in 3.5-5.6% of ESPD patients, compared to 6.3-14% of LSPD patients. 
Conjunctivitis occurred in less than 2% of both ESPD and LSPD patients.

Ophthalmological examination 
As mentioned above, different ophthalmological assessments have been performed in a limited number of 
patients in different studies over time after the non-clinical findings were known. A number of these 
assessments have been done in studies 015 and 017, study 016 and 018, Motion, and SETTLE. In these 
studies, assessment results were similar for safinamide and placebo treatment. 
Ocular coherence tomography outcomes in ESPD:  
In study 27918 (MOTION) the change in thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in ESPD patients 
has been determined by OCT. The mean change in RNFL thickness for the dosage of 50mg safinamide/day 
was -0.4(SD 4.9) micrometre for the left eye and 0.2(SD 3.7) micrometre for the right eye. For the 
dosage of 100mg safinamide/day and placebo treatment these mean changes for the left and right eye 
were -1.2 (SD 5.2) and -1.9 micrometre (SD 3.6) and 1.5 (SD 4.2) and 0.8 (SD 3.8) micrometre 
respectively. 
In the same study, there was also no significant change in total macula volume in either eye during 
safinamide or placebo treatment. An analysis of electroretinograms of 20 patients did not detect any 
treatment-related adverse change for safinamide compared with placebo.

ESPD patients who completed the MOTION study entered a double-blind, placebo-controlled extension 
phase (study 27938, MOTION EXTENSION) and were treated for up to 18 months. Ophthalmological 
examinations were repeated at periodic intervals. The mean change in RNFL thickness (SD) compared to 
baseline for the left eye in the 50mg safinamide, 100mg safinamide, and placebo were: -0.1 (5.8), 
-1.1(5.3), and 1.0(5.4). The respective changes for the right eye were: -0.8 (4.5), -1.2 (4.6), and 
-0.9(5.1). Also for the change in OCT total macula volume (cubic mm) no significant changes have been 
observed in these studies.

OCT parameters in LSPD 
For LSPD, ophthalmological parameters have been determined in a limited number of patients in study 
27919 (SETTLE). This study had a duration of 6 months. In this study no significant differences between 
Safinamide and placebo treatment have been observed with respect to the parameters visual acuity, 
logMAR assessment, colour vision, funduscopy, and visual field. 
In the SETTLE study also the RNFL thickness (micrometre) and total macula volume (cubic mm) have 
been determined. These analyses showed a reduction of -0.9 and -1.0 for the left and right eyes, 
respectively, for Safinamide, and an increase of 0.1 in the right eye, but a reduction of -0.2 in the left eye 
for the placebo group.  
Results for changes in total macular volume were similar for Safinamide and placebo. Small mean 
reductions (-0.03 to -0.07) were observed for both the right and left eyes in both groups, indicating no 
effect of safinamide treatment.

Approximately 25% of ESPD and LSPD patients were under 55 years of age. Between 3.2 and 7.9% of 
ESPD patients were 75 years of age or older compared to 3.7 to 4.0% of LSPD patients. The majority of 
included patients (about 70%) were 55 to 75 years of age. 
The occurrence of adverse events during safinamide treatment was higher than during placebo treatment 
among patients aged ≥75 years or above. This was seen for both ESPD (86.2-100% vs. 59.1%) and LSPD 
(88.9-94.4% vs. 70.0%). Only in the oldest age group there was some evidence of a safinamide-dose 
dependent increase in occurrence of adverse events. The occurrence of adverse events per treatment 
dose increased with age in ESPD patients, but not in LSPD patients.

For subjects in the <55 years age category, the most commonly reported TEAE was somnolence and the 
incidence of migraine, motor dysfunction, paresthesia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, upper 
respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, muscle spasms, sleep disorder, blood creatinine, increased, blood 
glucose increased, protein urine present, WBCs urine positive, joint injury, limb injury, orthostatic 
hypotension, and micturition urgency was 2-fold higher in the combined safinamide group compared with 
the combined placebo group.  
For subjects in the 55-to-75 years category, the most commonly reported TEAE was back pain and the 
incidence of sciatica, visual field defect, rhinitis, chest pain, and decreased appetite was 2-fold higher in 
the combined safinamide group.  
For subjects in the >75 years age category, the most commonly reported TEAE was headache and the 
incidence of approximately one-quarter of the reported TEAEs was 2-fold higher in the combined 
safinamide group due to the relatively small number of subjects in the combined placebo group in this age 
category (n = 22). 
LSPD 
The most commonly reported TEAE was dyskinesia, which had an incidence that was about 2-fold higher 
in the combined safinamide group compared to the placebo group, for all three age categories; <55 years 
age category (safinamide: 30%; placebo: 17%), 55-to-75 years age category (safinamide: 23%; placebo: 
12%), and >75 years age category (safinamide: 19%; placebo: 0%).

For subjects in the <55 years age category, back pain, pyrexia, and insomnia also had an incidence that 
was 2-fold higher in the combined placebo group.  
For the 55-to-75 years age category, the incidence of hypoesthesia, muscle rigidity, protein urine present, 
anxiety, and cough was 2-fold higher in the combined safinamide group.  
For subjects in the >75 years age category, the incidence of most of the reported TEAEs was 2-fold higher 
in the combined safinamide group due to the relatively small number of subjects in this age category in 
the combined safinamide group (n = 27) and the combined placebo group (n = 20).

Deaths 
Mortality during the safinamide development program was determined during use of study medication, or 
within 30 days after last dose of study medication. In addition deaths that occurred more than 30 days 
after discontinuation of study medication, were included if the adverse event that led to the fatal outcome 
had an onset within 30 days of the final dose of study medication.  
A total of 61 patients died. The crude mortality rate during safinamide treatment was 2.6% (1.7 per 100 
person years) and during placebo treatment was 1.2% (1.3 per 100 person years). Most frequent causes 
of death were cardiac disorders, general disorders, infections and infestations:

The mortality rate in the open-label studies (Study 28850 and open-label phase of Study 024) in which all 
patients received safinamide was 2.7% (28 of 1025) patients. For the open-label studies the adjusted

Chemistry  
There was a small increase in AST levels at safinamide treatment. However, this was not associated with 
a change of other liver function parameters like ALT, bilirubin or GGT. Overall, the number of patients with 
clinically relevant changes in liver function was low and similar between safinamide and placebo (see 
Table 45 below).   
Table 45 Number of subjects with clinically relevant changes of liver functions test from baseline in LSPD 
patients 
A significant increase in creatine kinase has been observed in Late Stage PD patients. However, this was 
not observed in early PD patients. The raise in creatine kinase levels in the advanced PD patients might be 
a symptom of increased dyskinesia rates in this population. There were no signals of decreased renal 
function.  
2.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Female ESPD and LSPD patients of childbearing potential were excluded from study participation if they 
were found to be pregnant (serum and urine pregnancy tests were performed at visits specified in the 
protocols). Non-pregnant included patients received contraception beginning four weeks prior to 
enrolment, and continuing throughout the treatment period and for four weeks after the last dose of the 
study medication. It is not known if safinamide is excreted via breast milk; therefore, breastfeeding 
females were not included into studies. 
Since no pregnant and/or lactating ESPD and LSPD patients have been included in the development 
program of safinamide, the effects of safinamide in these human subjects are yet unknown. The main 
target population of advance PD patients consist of elderly women with no childbearing potential.  
Other special populations 
The safety of safinamide has not been determined in other special populations such as patients with 
severe cardiovascular disease, renal or liver insufficiency. Chronic non-life threatening concomitant 
disease was a contra-indication for study participation in different trials. For example, patients with a 
current diagnosis of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine, pulmonary or 
cardiovascular disease, including acute gastric ulcer, hypertension that is not well-controlled, cardiac

conditions (e.g. uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction), asthma, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), and Type I diabetes were not eligible for participation in the MOTION study. 
2.8.6.  Discontinuation due to AES 
Less than 5% of ESPD and LSPD patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. 2.4% Of 
Safinamide-treated Group1 ESPD patients discontinued treatment for this reason compared to 3.3% of 
placebo-treated ESPD patients in this group.  
Among LSPD patients, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was higher upon safinamide 
treatment compared to placebo treatment (3.7 vs. 2.4%). The most common adverse events among 
Safinamide-treated LSPD patients were: dyskinesias, dizziness, paraesthesias, asthenia, visual 
hallucinations, and vomiting (see Table 41).

2.8.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Efficacy and safety of safinamide treatment have been evaluated in different randomized, double-blinded 
clinical trials with a maximum duration of 24 months, as well as open label studies.  
Patients included in the studies concerned otherwise relatively healthy patients with Parkinson’s Disease. 
Patients with serious chronic systemic diseases (like e.g. severe hepatic disease) were excluded and the 
SmPC was adapted to reflect this by introducing appropriate contraindications in section 4.3.   
Between 66% and 89% of all patients experienced adverse events. Studies in the development program 
show that the occurrence of adverse events increased with advancing age in safinamide-treated patients. 
ESPD patients experienced fewer adverse events than LSPD patients although differences were not large. 
Serious adverse events were nearly twice as common among safinamide-treated LSPD patients compared 
to safinamide-treated ESPD patients (12-14% vs. 7-8%). Less than 0.5% of ESPD patients died during 
follow-up compared to 2-2.5% of LSPD patients, which might be due to the fact that advanced PD patients 
are overall more vulnerable.

From a safety perspective, more adverse events would have been expected with the increase of the dose 
of safinamide. However neither in the ESPD nor in the LSPD patient population there was a consistent 
dose-effect relationship regarding specific adverse events. 
The most frequently observed adverse events among ESPD patients concerned nervous system disorders 
(27-33%), gastro-intestinal disorders (22-29%), infections and infestations (19-29%) and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (19-24%). The most frequently observed types of 
adverse events among LSPD patients were: nervous system disorders (38-60%), gastro-intestinal 
disorders (22-27%), infections and infestations (18-22%), musculoskeletal disorders (20-30%), and eye 
disorders (16-27%). 
Frequently occurring neurological adverse events in both ESPD and LSPD patients were: dizziness, 
headache, somnolence and tremor. Dyskinesias have been observed more frequently in LSPD patients as 
compared to ESPD patients (13-31% vs. 0-0.2%) and probably were dependent on the disease stage 
and/or the use of L-dopa. The increased incidence of dyskinesias among LSPD patients was not 
considered to be a major issue since dyskinesias are normally associated with an increase in ON time and 
were usually mild.  The provided data about any increase in ON time without dyskinesias and ON-time 
with troublesome dyskinesia, in order to better assess the pros and cons of dyskinesia as an adverse 
event, confirmed that the overall incidence of troublesome dyskinesia was low and not different in the 
study arms.  
About 15-20% of the ESPD and LSPD patients experienced psychiatric adverse events. The general 
occurrence rates for both ESPD and LSPD patients tended to decrease with the increase in safinamide 
dose. The most frequently observed psychiatric adverse events in both ESPD and LSPD patients were: 
insomnia, depression, anxiety, and hallucination.  
Impulse control disorders and hyper sexuality disorders occurred in less than 0.5% of patients. For 
levodopa, psychiatric adverse events have been reported in 25% of patients.  
Nausea and constipation were frequently seen in both ESPD and LSPD patients 
Contrary to most other adverse events, the occurrence orthostatic hypotension tended to increase with 
increasing doses of safinamide in both ESPD and LSPD patients (ESPD 1.9-4.5%, LSPD 2.1-2.5%). Given 
the low incidence though it was not considered justified to conclude on a dose relationship.   
Between 3 and 6% of ESPD patients experienced cataract, compared to 6-14% of LSPD patients.  
Safinamide treatment was associated with increased ASAT enzymes, though this was often self-limiting, 
and ALT and bilirubin remained stable.  One of the important questions to be addressed was whether the 
incidence of adverse events increased with long-term exposure, or with age. Pooled safety data 
presenting the incidence and prevalence of adverse events for three different time periods of exposure 
(0-6 months, 6-12 months, and ≥12 months) were submitted, and demonstrated that the incidence of 
adverse events decreased over exposure time and that there was no evidence of new adverse events 
emerging with duration of exposure. It was noted that a limited number of older people was included in 
the trial, whereas the rate of adverse events increased with age. In the Risk Management Plan, the use in 
the older people is included as an important “missing information”, and will have to be further addressed 
in future PSURs. 
The adverse events for different combinations of polytherapy (L-Dopa alone, L-Dopa + Dopamine agonist, 
or L-Dopa + Dopamine agonist + amantadine), were also assessed and no different patterns of frequency 
or type of adverse events were observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 106/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of the cardiological examinations were difficult to interpret since only changes in conduction 
times between start and end of the study have been reported instead of the frequency of abnormal 
conduction times prior to and after treatment. However, since there was no signal of cardiovascular 
events in the trials, and safinamide does not prolong QTc in a dedicated study, this was no considered a 
major problem.  
After retinal degeneration had been observed in rats upon use of safinamide-treatment, ophthalmological 
examinations were introduced in the safinamide development program. Retinal degeneration has was 
observed in 2.2% of patients in the 150-200 mg/day group in Study 015, where there were no baseline 
ocular assessments, but has not been observed in other studies with treatment for longer duration. 
Systematic ophthalmological monitoring did not detect a risk of retinal degeneration in patients as 
compared to placebo, up to a period of 2 years.  
The CHMP agreed that the data provided from the ocular safety report did not indicate that there was a 
significant ocular safety issue. The most important parameters for evaluating potential effects of 
safinamide on the retina are the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and total macular volume as 
measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) as changes in these parameters precede 
abnormalities in fundoscopy, colour vision, visual acuity. Results for RNFL and total macular volume were 
highly inconsistent and did not point at an unfavourable effect of safinamide in a period of 1.5-2 years. Up 
to moment of assessment the OCT data did not indicate a problem that might preclude approval. However, 
ophthalmic safety and retina degeneration will remain subject of special interest in future PSURs. The 
Applicant has made a commitment to develop targeted questionnaires, which will allow the collection of 
information from spontaneous cases in a structured manner.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.8.8.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall the safety of safinamide was considered acceptable, as incidences of adverse events under 
safinamide treatment seemed quite low as compared to placebo. In the light of the animal findings, the 
CHMP was of the view that even though the clinical data did not indicate a risk in Parkinson’s disease 
patients, retinal deterioration should be considered as an important potential risk and followed up through 
the proposed routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities, as described in the RMP. Targeted 
questionnaires should be developed to facilitate future safety surveillance.   
2.9.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
2.10.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 9 is acceptable.  
During this procedure, in the period after the finalisation of the PRAC outcome and before the CHMP 
Opinion, certain changes were agreed regarding two issues:

-The inclusion of retinal degeneration as a potential risk with all appropriate sections amended 
accordingly. 
-The reflection of the two pharmacokinetic studies (in vitro study on amidase enzymes involved in the 
biotransformation of safinamide to NW-1153 and DDI study with a BCRP substrate with a Tmax < 2 
hours), both as category 3 and with a proposed date of submission of July 2015. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 9 with the following content: 
Table 47 Safety concerns 
Summary of safety concerns 
Important identified risk:   Adverse event of Dyskinesia in mid/late PD patients on concomitant use of 
L-Dopa, alone or in combination with other dopaminergic medication. 
Important Potential 
Risks:  
Increased incidence of ADRs relating to Dyskinesia in Mid-Late Stage PD 
on L-Dopa could be considered as a risk for patients exposed to 
safinamide. This is the most common AE in excess of placebo. 
Teratogenicity 
A comprehensive reproductive toxicity study programme indicates that 
Safinamide when given alone, or even more so when given in combination 
with dopaminergic drugs, is predicted to increase the risk of adverse 
developmental and perhaps reproductive outcomes in humans when used 
in accordance with the dosing information in the product label. Safinamide 
therefore should not be given during pregnancy, to lactating women, or to 
women of childbearing potential not practicing adequate contraception. 
Women of child bearing potential should be advised not to become 
pregnant during safinamide therapy. 
Risk of retinal degeneration in patients with PD treated with safinamide 
Retinal degeneration was observed in rat repeated-dose toxicity studies 
but not in monkey studies. The species most affected was the rat, in which 
a time and dose-dependent retinal atrophy was observed both in 
pigmented and non-pigmented animals. The lowest dose producing retinal 
atrophy was 15 mg/kg/day. Only mild retinal atrophy occurs in mice after 
life-time treatment in the carcinogenicity study at the highest dose tested 
(200 mg/kg/day). 
Monkeys were not affected by retinal changes (at doses up to 70 
mg/kg/day for 39 weeks); this was confirmed by an independent 
Pathology Working Group. In addition, no retinal changes were induced in 
monkeys treated for 13-week with combination of safinamide and 
L-dopa/carbidopa. Similarly, no retinal changes were present in another 
13-week monkey combination study with safinamide and pramipexole. 
The ocular effects of safinamide have been comprehensively evaluated 
using an ophthalmological examination in ~2000 patients in therapeutic 
studies, including the measurements of retinal change using Ocular 
coherence tomography (OCT) in over 300 patients on safinamide, and 
retinal function using electro-retinogram (ERG) in a single center in a 
limited number of patients. All results were reviewed by an independent 
rater blinded to the treatment condition. 
Review of the data, and detailed statistical analyses did not detect any 
systematic difference in the incidence of newly abnormal, or worsening 
ocular function in safinamide treated patients compared to placebo. 
There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events relating to the

Summary of safety concerns 
lens or the retina in safinamide treated patients compared to placebo. 
However, as patients with history of retinal disease, including inherited 
conditions were excluded from the studies, use of safinamide in these 
patients is considered a potential risk.  
Use in severe hepatic impairment. 
Results from the study performed in patients with hepatic dysfunction 
indicated higher exposures of safinamide, but without any clinically 
important changes in liver enzymes.  These findings led the Sponsor to 
conclude that safinamide should be contraindicated in patients with 
severe liver disease, and the maximum dose to be administered to 
patients with moderate liver disease is limited to 50mg, with the provision 
that if the liver dysfunction progresses from moderate to severe, the 
patients should discontinue treatment with safinamide [see SmPC section 
4.2, 4.3]. These precautions and warnings, adequately cover the risk for 
patients with liver disease who may be treated with safinamide. 
Impulse control disorders (ICDs) 
ICDs can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or 
dopaminergic treatments. Some reports of ICDs have also been observed 
with other MAO-inhibitors.  Safinamide treatment has not been associated 
with any increase in the appearance of ICDs. 
[See SmPC section 4.4: Special Warnings and Precautions for Use] 
Concomitant use of MAOIs, serotonergic drugs, and/or pethidine.  
Serious adverse events, including serotonin syndrome, have been 
reported with the concomitant use of MAOIs, serotonergic drugs, and/or 
pethidine.  As this may be a class effect, the concomitant administration of 
XADAGO and pethidine is contraindicated. 
Use in patients with history and/or presence of retinal disease  
Use of safinamide in patients aged<30 years and >75 years 
Effects of Overdose 
Patients with severe, disabling peak-dose or biphasic dyskinesia, or with 
unpredictable or widely swinging fluctuations.

disorder, or severe depression 
Long term use >3 years 
The use of safinamide concomitantly with BCRP substrate drugs.  A post 
authorisation study will be performed: until these results are available,  a 
time interval of 5 hours should be kept between dosing of Safinamide and 
drugs that are BCRP substrates with a Tmax ≤2 hours

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
MAO-B inhibitors are established in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and safinamide is a highly 
selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitor that does not cause a “cheese effect” linked to tyramine rich 
food. Safinamide has been shown at doses of 40mg, even lower than the minimal recommended dose of 
50 mg, to induce a complete blockage of MAO-B activity in platelets. For other MAO-B inhibitors these 
effects are non-specific and may exert MAO-A antagonism, causing hypertensive crisis at the time of 
intake of tyramine-rich food. However, the response to tyramine challenge was similar between placebo 
and safinamide at supra-therapeutic doses, and no specific measures were considered required for the 
use of safinamide with tyramine-rich food and drinks.  
Safinamide as add-on therapy to L-dopa alone or in combination with other PD medications in 
mid- to late-stage fluctuating patients 
The efficacy of safinamide in late stage Parkinson’s Disease as add-on therapy to L-dopa was evaluated in 
two randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 24 weeks, in patients with motor 
fluctuations at baseline. Safinamide 50-100 mg daily applied as add-on to levodopa, significantly 
increased the ON-time without troublesome dyskinesia with approximately 30 minutes per day in one 
study, and 60 minutes in the other study, as compared to placebo. This effect was considered clinically 
relevant, also taking into account the clinical response that has been reported in the literature for other 
registered treatment options in this setting.  
Maintenance of efficacy of the ON-time was established in a placebo-controlled extension phase of 24 
months. The treatment effect was overall more robust in the 100 mg dose arm: Several post hoc defined 
responders rates, e.g. 30 minutes improvement in ON with no increase in dyskinesia and OFF time, were 
in favour of the 100 mg dose group.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Apart from MAO-B inhibition, several other proposed mechanisms of action of safinamide, have been 
suggested by in-vitro data i.e. inhibition of dopamine and serotonin transporters, reduced stimulated 
release of glutamate without affecting basal glutamate levels, and reduction of the neuronal excitability 
by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels. The presented data did not allow for a clear conclusion on the 
extent to which the interaction with these pathways could contribute to the clinical effect of safinamide. 
Comparative studies with a ‘pure’ MAO-B inhibitor were lacking and no clinical effects that might be 
related to these mechanisms, such as a reduction in dyskinesia rating scores, were clearly evident in the 
clinical trials.  
Safinamide as add-on therapy to a single DA-agonist in early stage non-fluctuating patients 
The efficacy of safinamide was evaluated in three randomized placebo-controlled trials in patients with 
early Parkinson Disease without fluctuations, on a stable treatment with a dopamine-agonist. The primary 
outcome of these studies was an improvement in motor function from baseline, as compared to placebo, 
assessed by the UPDRS III scale. In the first study (009), a significant effect was shown in the short-term 
(at 12 weeks). However, this could not be confirmed by the longer-term pivotal confirmatory trials as the 
MOTION and Study 015 failed to meet the primary endpoints in their primary analyses (ITT, LOCF).  
Post-hoc re-analyses were performed in a pooling exercise where data from the studies were analyzed 
together. This was not considered valid from a methodological point of view, as there were differences in 
duration and dose regimens of the pooled studies, and rendered the interpretation of the observed results

difficult. In addition to these methodological shortcomings, the observed outcomes in the primary 
endpoint were considerably smaller than those defined a priori as clinically relevant, and not consistently 
supported by a significant improvement in daily functioning, illustrating that the clinical relevance of the 
results was debatable. In the MOTION Study - considered as the most important one among the three 
studies available as this was by far the largest study, the treatment effect was marginal and sensitive to 
different data imputation methods.  
Altogether the data presented in support of the indication in early PD patients has shown at best a 
marginal improvement of UPDRS motor scores, which was non-robust, and of questionable clinical 
relevance. The post-hoc analyses were not methodologically sound with regard to the pooling of data. 
Regarding the long-term effect of safinamide as add-on to a single DA-agonist in early PD patients 
safinamide did not significantly delay the time to the need for an increment of the background 
dopaminergic therapy.  
Safinamide as add-on therapy to L-dopa alone or in combination with other PD medications in 
mid- to late-stage fluctuating patients  
The inclusion of an active comparator would have helped to interpret the magnitude of the observed effect 
of increment of 30-60 minutes in ON-time in advanced PD patients, also considering that the treatment 
effect sizes on the primary endpoint showed considerable variability in the two trials. However, the 
committee concluded that the different point estimates of the pivotal studies fell within the variability 
seen in studies with add-on treatment with other MAO-inhibitors or dopamine-agonists in advanced PD 
patients, and were probably is due to differences in study populations. Although head-to-head studies 
with active comparators were lacking, the clinical relevance of the effect could be concluded upon from 
the favourable indirect comparison to other treatments with similar mode of action, used in this 
population.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In general, safinamide was well tolerated in early stage PD patients.  
Specific adverse events of interest 
Retinal degeneration 
Retinal degeneration was observed in studies in rats, which might have been due to accumulation of 
safinamide. Because of this risk, systematic ophthalmic monitoring was introduced in the trials, including 
routine testing of visual acuity, colour vision, peripheral field vision and fundoscopy, and Optical 
Coherence Tomography. Based on the data from the pre-clinical and clinical setting it could be concluded 
that treatment up to 2 years did not indicate an enhanced risk of ophthalmic events linked to the use of 
safinamide, as compared to placebo, in a group of 600 subjects. The ocular tomography measurements, 
which were considered as the most sensitive assay of the retina degeneration, did not indicate a trend of 
significant worsening thus far in a subgroup of 155 subjects with 1.5-2 years follow-up.   
CNS risks 
In the add-on setting to levodopa in late-stage PD patients, dyskinesias were twice as frequently reported 
at the use of safinamide than in placebo, however, they were rarely severe.  
Frequently occurring neurological adverse events in both early stage PD and late stage PD patients were 
dizziness, headache, somnolence and tremor, at similar frequencies as reported under placebo 
treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014 
Page 114/118 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most frequently observed psychiatric adverse events in both early stage PD and late stage PD 
patients were: insomnia, depression, anxiety and hallucination. Impulse control disorders and 
hypersexuality disorders occurred in less than 0.5% of patients.   
Hepatotoxicity 
Safinamide induced transaminase enzyme increments, though this was in general self-limiting, not 
associated with increments of bilirubin, AST or phosphatase. There were no cases of drug-induced liver 
toxicity.  
Cardiovascular risks 
Safinamide did not cause QTc prolongation in an active controlled study in healthy volunteers. Safinamide 
was not associated with cardiovascular risk in trials, though it is noted that a selected population at low 
risk was included. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Retinal degeneration 
Based on the concern raised from the non-clinical setting, ophthalmic safety and retinal degeneration 
remain an important issue in future safety monitoring. A targeted questionnaire is to be developed, which 
will allow the collection of information from relevant events in the post-marketing setting in a more 
structured manner. 
Special populations  
There is limited experience in elderly patients, patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment, and 
patients with serious chronic cardiovascular disease. Data in very elderly will be generated 
post-marketing. 
Furthermore, there is limited experience in patients at enhanced risk of retinal degeneration. As a 
precautionary measure, patients at risk of conditions such as (diabetic) retinopathy, uveitis, and 
hereditary retina disorders are excluded from the target population.  
Co-medication  
No relevant patterns in frequency or type of adverse events for the different co-medications including 
psychoactive drugs were observed in the trials. However, it is difficult to exclude interactions based on 
these observational data, as certain co-medications were infrequently used in the trials, and subjects 
were not stratified for the use of co-medications at inclusion.  
Based on in-vitro data it cannot be excluded that safinamide is an inhibitor of BCRP in the small intestine 
and could potentially lead to DDIs. As the concentration of safinamide in the gastrointestinal tract exceeds 
the inhibition threshold only for a short period of time, an interaction is only expected with BCRP substrate 
with a tmax ≤ 2 hours, when safinamide and the substrate with a tmax of <2 hours are taken at the same 
time.  
The potential for interaction of safinamide via CYP and P-gp is low, however the CHMP recommended that 
the company should still evaluate if safinamide may interact with BCRP substrates and submit the reports 
of several in vitro studies in which it should be investigated if safinamide affects the function of several 
transporters.  
Safinamide is extensively metabolised into several inactive metabolites. The primary route of elimination 
is via unspecified amidases, which suggests a potential for DDI pharmacokinetic interactions. In this 
Assessment report

context, the CHMP considered that the biotransformation of safinamide will be further investigated 
post-authorisation in an in vitro study on amidase enzymes, as reflected in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
There were no clearly demonstrated, clinically relevant benefits of safinamide applied as add-on therapy 
in the early stage Parkinson patients on a stable treatment with dopamine-agonists.  
The most relevant favourable effect of safinamide was the improvement of 0.5-1 hrs in ON-time without 
troublesome dyskinesia, when the drug was administered as add-on treatment to levodopa therapy in 
mid-late stage Parkinson patients with motor fluctuations.  
The most important adverse event is the higher risk of dyskinesia in advanced patients treated with 
levodopa, and the concern for a potential risk of retinal degeneration, as indicated by the non-clinical data 
in rats.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Safinamide as add-on therapy to a single DA-agonist in early stage non-fluctuating patients 
The benefits of safinamide in this setting, i.e. to non-fluctuating PD patients on a stable dose of a 
dopamine-agonist, were not robustly demonstrated. The treatment effects in the motor scores used as 
primary endpoints were below the targets that were pre-defined as clinically relevant in the protocol. 
Moreover, the observed changes were not consistently supported by a significant improvement in daily 
functioning, illustrating that the clinical relevance remained debatable. The use of safinamide did not 
significantly prevent a change in the dopaminergic background therapy in this setting. It remained 
unclear whether there are any criteria according to which patients that would benefit more from the 
treatment could be selected. The outcomes were not robust, and largely depended on how the assessed 
population was defined and on the methodology used to handle missing data.   
The applicant argued that there was probably very little room for improvement by enhancing dopamine 
levels via MAO-B inhibition in patients that are stable on their dopamine agonist treatment. Although this 
may be a reasonable explanation for the disappointing results, it is still not sufficient to justify the use of 
safinamide in this setting.  
During the assessment, the CHMP considered that the benefits of safinamide in the early PD setting were 
not robustly shown, and did not outweigh the risks. The Applicant did not pursue the indication in early PD 
any further during the marketing authorisation application procedure. 
Safinamide as add-on therapy to L-dopa alone or in combination with other PD medications in 
mid- to late-stage fluctuating patients  
Regarding the other pursued indication i.e. add-on to L-Dopa with/without additional anti-Parkinson 
medication, a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect was confirmed in both trials. The results 
with respect to secondary endpoints were consistent, and the positive effect was maintained in the 
long-term double-blind extension phase. The observed improvement of 0.5h or 1h in ON-time, 
respectively, was deemed clinically relevant in this population despite the lack of direct comparative data.  
A clear beneficial effect on dyskinesia was not shown in the overall study population. One the one hand, 
this was expected as MAO-inhibition causes a dopaminergic effect, and this could result in dyskinesia. On 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/393951/2014

the other hand, based on the other postulated mechanisms of action (reduction of neuronal excitability by 
blocking voltage/gated sodium, reduced stimulated release of glutamate) it was anticipated that 
dyskinesia should have been controlled better. Nevertheless, the fact that no beneficial effect on 
dyskinesia was demonstrated did not negatively influence the benefit/risk balance.  
Although an increased incidence of dyskinesia was noted, this is not necessarily a major issue considering 
that dyskinesias were usually mild and associated with an increase in ON-time. The overall incidence of 
troublesome dyskinesia was low and was not dose related. 
Retinal degeneration had been observed in rats after safinamide-exposure. After the results of the rat 
study were known, extensive ophthalmological examinations were introduced in the safinamide 
development program. Systematic ophthalmological monitoring up to 2 years did not indicate retinal 
degeneration as a problem: There was no signal of worsening in retina and macula thickness at retinal 
tomography, and there were no differences in visual acuity, colour vision, peripheral vision or fundoscopy 
scores compared to placebo. The gathered evidence was reassuring, although this will remain an adverse 
event of special interest in future monitoring.  
The overall benefit/risk balance of safinamide in the treatment of patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease as add-on to a stable dose of L-dopa only or in combination with other PD medications in mid- to 
late-stage fluctuating patients was considered positive.

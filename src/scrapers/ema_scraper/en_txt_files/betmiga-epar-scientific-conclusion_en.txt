Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
In post-marketing data, 305 cases of dizziness were reported. Two third had a compatible timeline and 
half  of  patients  developed  dizziness  within  7  days  of  administering  mirabegron.  Some  cases  had 
positive dechallenge and rechallenge. Therefore, dizziness should be included in the section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
An  important  number  of  constipation  cases  were  reported,  showing  disproportionality  criteria  and 
compatible timelines. Therefore, constipation should be included in the section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Headache is one of the most frequent events reported with a positive timeline. 47.8% of the cases had 
positive  dechallenge  with  a  2.2%  positive  rechallenge.  Therefore,  headache  should  be  included  in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Several  cases  of  diarrhoea  were  reported  with  a  compatible timeline.  At  least  6  cases  had  a  positive 
rechallenge. Therefore, diarrhoea should be included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
In  a  cumulative  review  of  hypertensive  crisis  cases,  3  of  the  9  evaluable  cases  were  associated  with 
ischemic cardiac events: 2 with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and 1 with coronary syndrome. 
In  addition,  1  patient  from  the  pre-authorisation  phase  was  hospitalized  due  to  hypertensive  crisis. 
Therefore, despite of the limited number of cases, hypertensive crisis should be included in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing mirabegron were warranted.

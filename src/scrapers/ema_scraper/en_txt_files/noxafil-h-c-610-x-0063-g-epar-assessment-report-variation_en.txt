2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in 
immunocompromised patients, especially in those considered at high risk for severe and prolonged 
neutropenia or those who have received HSCT. As in adults, the paediatric patients at risk for 
developing IFI, primarily due to neutropenia and T-cell dysfunction, include, but are not limited to, 
allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients, and patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplasia, severe 
aplastic anemia, and advanced-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The most common IFI in these 
immunocompromised children are aspergillosis, candidiasis and mucormycosis. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The incidence of IFI in paediatric patients ranges from <5% to 10%, depending on patient-related risk 
factors and pathogenic characteristics. Although a number of agents are approved for the prophylaxis 
and treatment of IFI in both adults and children, mortality remains as high as 20% in patients who 
develop IFI. Given the high morbidity and mortality of IFI in high-risk paediatric patients, antifungal 
agents for prophylaxis and salvage treatment of IFI are warranted. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Recognizing an IFI can be difficult, because nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms or isolated fever 
are frequently the only presenting features. Therefore, a high index of clinical suspicion is necessary in 
patients at increased risk of IFI, which requires knowledge of the paediatric patient population at risk, 
additional predisposing factors within this population, and the clinical signs and symptoms of IFI. 
The diagnosis of proven IFI can only be made by cultures obtained by sterile procedure or 
histopathologic, cytopathologic or direct microscopic evaluation of tissue specimens. However, tissue 
specimens are sometimes hard to obtain in patients receiving treatment for hematologic malignancies 
and HSCT patients due to thrombocytopenia and the potential risk of bleeding complications. 
Moreover, cultural-based methods have low sensitivity and specificity and are time consuming. 
Therefore, other diagnostic tools (radiologic, serologic and molecular methods) may be used for the 
diagnosis of IFI. 
2.1.4.  Management 
In contrast to adults, detailed information of PK and/or PD of many antifungal agents is lacking in 
paediatric patients, and antifungal agents that have demonstrated effectiveness in adults have not 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 7/91 
 
 
 
 
been licensed for use in paediatric patients. Few antifungal agents are approved for antifungal 
prophylaxis in children. However, given the need for managing IFI in paediatric patients, many 
antifungal agents in multiple classes are currently used for IFI prophylaxis and treatment in these 
patients. These include triazoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole), lipid 
amphotericin B, and echinocandins (caspofungin and micafungin), each with their own benefits and 
risks. The choice of antifungal prophylaxis for paediatric patients is limited by side effects profiles, 
drug-drug interactions and PK characteristics. More agents and studies on existing agents are needed 
to meet the need of individualized care of the diverse patient populations at risk of developing IFI.

2.2.  About the product 
Posaconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal compound which exhibits potent antifungal 
activity against a variety of yeasts and molds (Aspergillus species, Candida species, Coccidioides 
immitis, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, and species of Fusarium, Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Rhizopus), including 
strains resistant to amphotericin B and other triazoles. Posaconazole, like other azoles, blocks the 
synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal membrane, through the inhibition of the 
enzyme lanosterol 14α–demethylase (CYP51). 
Posaconazole is indicated for use in the treatment of the following fungal infections in adults: 
-  
Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or 
itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
-  
Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are 
intolerant of amphotericin B; 
-  
Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole 
or in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole; 
-  
Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or 
fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
- 
Oropharyngeal candidiasis: as first-line therapy in patients who have severe disease or are 
immunocompromised, in whom response to topical therapy is expected to be poor. 
Posaconazole is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following patients: 
- 
Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) 
or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are at high 
risk of developing invasive fungal infections;  
- 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose 
immunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing 
invasive fungal infections. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The development of an age-appropriate formulation and studies P032 and P097 are part of the 
currently agreed paediatric investigation plan and have been agreed with the PDCO.

The pharmaceutical form, Posaconazole PFS, subject to this line extension was developed for the 
paediatric population 2 to 18 years of age with the scope to avoid the food effect observed with the 
oral suspension formulation, but not observed with the tablet formulation.  
Powder 
The powder for oral suspension (PFS) is supplied as an off-white to yellow powder in sachets.  
The active substance used in the development and manufacture of powder for oral suspension is 
identical to that used in the marketed products tablet and oral suspension. 
The PFS formulation developed using the same key functional component used in the approved 
marketed tablet formulation, which does not present food interaction. The excipient HPMCAS is a well-
known pharmaceutical ingredient, also used in the tablet formulation, and its quality is compliant with 
USP-NF standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Principles consistent with ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 were used during development, including a quality 
target product profile (QTPP), to guide development, the use of quality risk management, process 
analytical technology tools and risk-based development studies across scales. The proposed control 
strategy for posaconazole PFS consists of process parameters, proven acceptable ranges in-process 
controls and release specifications. However, no design space was claimed. 
The powder is sacheted and co-packaged with a suspending vehicle and the ancillary components to 
produce the final product.  
The sachet packaging operation, the posaconazole powder is filled into foil sachets. 
The  primary  packaging  is  child-resistant  single-use  sachets  (PET/aluminium/LLDPE).  The  material 
complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Suspending vehicle 
The suspending vehicle used with the powder for oral suspension (PFS) is a cloudy, colourless 
liquid.The suspending vehicle (9 mL) is used to disperse Posaconazole PFS to obtain 10 mL total of 
suspension with a final concentration of approximately 30 mg/mL. 
The excipients used in the manufacture of the suspending vehicle are the subjects of current 
monographs in the USP/NF and/or Ph. Eur. and are tested and meet the requirements found therein 
prior to use, as applicable. Excipients which are not the subject of any compendial monographs meet 
the requirements of the in-house specifications. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 
2.1.1 of this report. The levels of the excipients in the suspending vehicle are well below acceptable 
daily intake (ADI) amounts.  
finished product constituted with the suspending vehicle is considered safe at the proposed levels of 
preservatives for the intended paediatric population.  
The primary packaging is HDPE oval bottle, a polypropylene closure with a foil induction seal liner inside 
the cap, is used to seal the bottle closed. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the 
intended use of the product.  
Posaconazole PFS is supplied with medical devices and ancillary devices, all of them are CE marked:

Compatibility and in-use testing have demonstrated acceptable compatibility with both the mixing cup 
and oral syringes used. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Powder 
The manufacturing process consists of 3 main steps, following by sachet packaging and co-packaging. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.  
Suspending vehicle

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The approval of POS PFS is supported by the comprehensive non-clinical programmes conducted for 
the marketed POS oral suspension and IV solution formulations. These programmes established a data 
set to characterize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology profile of POS. In addition, 
toxicology studies in neonatal/juvenile and young adult animals were completed with the marketed 
formulations, supporting the expanded indication of POS IV solution and the administration of POS PFS 
to a paediatric population ≥ 2 years of age. Therefore, additional non-clinical studies with POS PFS 
were not conducted. 
The non-clinical module submitted by the MAH was limited to discussion of the studies conducted in 
neonatal/juvenile and young adult animals with POS oral suspension or POS IV solution, e.g.  
• 
In juvenile rats: a dose-range finding and a pivotal 12-week toxicity studies conducted with the POS 
oral  suspension  (studies  no.  SN  07366,  SN  07193).  A  second  12-week  study  was  performed 
subsequently to clarify mammary gland and salivary gland findings (study no. SN 09005); 
In juvenile dogs: a dose-range finding and a pivotal 9-month toxicity studies conducted with the POS 
oral suspension, as well as a pivotal 6-week study conducted with the POS IV solution (studies no. SN 
07367, SN 07194, TT#12-9018). To clarify some concerns on the developing brain identified in the 
latter study, two additional 13-week studies were performed with the POS IV solution, one in juvenile 
dogs and the other in young adult animals (studies no. TT#14-1001 and TT#13-1062). 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
No additional pharmacology studies were conducted to support paediatric indications for POS IV 
solution and POS PFS. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No additional pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with POS to support paediatric indications for 
POS IV solution and POS PFS. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were submitted in support of the present application. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
No additional repeat-dose toxicity study was submitted. 
To support a previous application for approval of POS as oral suspension, repeat-dose toxicity studies 
were conducted in mice for up to 3 months with oral doses up to 90 mg/kg, in rats for up to 6 months 
with oral doses up to 45 mg/kg, and in dogs for up to 1 year with oral doses up to 30 mg/kg. A 1-year 
neuropathology study was also conducted in monkeys. To support approval of POS IV solution, a 1-
month study in monkeys with doses up to 12 mg/kg and a 3-month study in dogs with doses up to 9 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 15/91 
 
 
 
 
mg/kg were performed. The latter dog study is the study no. TT#13-1062 discussed above. Below is a 
short summary of the main findings detailed in the EPAR. 
In oral studies, treatment-related effects were reported in the adrenal glands of rats and dogs at 
exposure levels equal to or greater than those attained in humans (adrenal suppressive effects due to 
class-related inhibition of steroid hormone synthesis). Posaconazole was also shown to induce 
phospholipidosis in all species, where it was observed in several tissues as vacuolated macrophages 
(lungs), histiocytes (spleen, thymus, lymph nodes) and Kupffer cells (liver). Phospholipidosis in these 
tissues was not associated with functional effects, except pulmonary phospholipidosis in the 2-year 
carcinogenicity study in rats. In other species exposed to similar posaconazole levels, pulmonary 
phospholipidosis was less severe and not associated with overt functional changes. Moreover, 
phospholipidosis was observed in neural tissues of dogs only as vacuolation of neurons in the brain and 
Auerbach’s plexus of the intestine and welling axons in the brain and spinal cord. A neurotoxicity study 
showed that this was not associated with functional changes in central and peripheral nervous 
systems. The highest dose at which neuronal phospholipidosis without functional effects were observed 
in dogs was 30 mg/kg, which represents animal to human exposure multiples of approximately 3 fold. 
It was concluded that neuronal phospholipidosis seen in dogs is unlikely to be of clinical significance 
considering also the absence of this finding and lack of functional effects in the 1-year monkey study. 
In the 1-month intravenous monkey study, a non-dose related incidence of thrombus/emboli in the 
lung was seen. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
No additional studies were submitted. 
Posaconazole showed no genotoxic potential in in vitro and in vivo studies. In long-term carcinogenicity 
studies conducted in rats at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg/day and in mice at oral doses up to 90 
mg/kg/day, no finding indicative of a special hazard for humans was reported. Adrenal tumours were 
reported in rats as a consequence of a class effect of azole antifungals. 
2.5.4.4.  Fertility and early embryonic development, embryofoetal development, and pre and 
postnatal development 
No additional studies were submitted. 
DART studies conducted by the oral route to support the use of the previously approved oral 
suspension, and bridging studies conducted in rats and rabbits to support the IV formulation 
demonstrated similar exposure profiles via oral and IV route. Briefly, no effect was reported on male 
and female fertility in rats at up to 180 and 45 mg/kg (1.7-fold and 2.2-fold the human exposure). In 
embryo-foetal toxicity studies, there were increases in skeletal variations and malformations at 
subtherapeutic exposure levels in rats, and increases in resorptions and skeletal variations in rabbits; 
these effects were considered as related to azole-related effects on steroidogenesis. In the rat pre- and 
postnatal development study, dystocia, increased gestation length, reduced litter size and postnatal 
viability were observed with also foetal anomalies reported previously.

a) Dose Range Finding Oral (Gavage) Toxicity Study in the Neonatal Rat (SN 07366) 
This study was conducted to determine doses for the definitive study. The findings were consistent 
with those previously observed with POS in previous nonclinical studies, and there were no new POS-
related toxicities identified. The NOAEL was < 25 mg/kg/day due to the effects on body weight gain 
observed at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day and moribund condition and mortality at ≥75 mg/kg/day. 
b)  A Three-Month Oral (Gavage) Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study in Neonatal and Juvenile 
Rats with a Six-Week Recovery Period (SN 07193) 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of POS on growth, bone maturation, 
neurobehavioral and reproductive development when administered by oral gavage to rats daily for 12 
weeks from PND 7 to 91. Four groups of 60 rats per sex were gavage daily with posaconazole doses of 
0, 1, 5 or 20 mg/kg/day and assigned within each dose level to one of four subgroups (main study, 
recovery, reproductive or toxicokinetic) evaluating different parameters. Assessment of toxicity was 
based on mortality, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, clinical pathology, organ 
weights, and gross and histopathological examination. Additionally, femoral bone measurements, 
behavioral performance (auditory startle, motor activity and water maze assessments) and 
reproductive parameters (estrous cycle, mating and fertility, reproductive function and development) 
were evaluated. Pups assigned to the TK subgroup were dosed from PND 7 to 21, with determination 
of drug plasma levels on PND 21. 
There was no POS-related mortality, clinical signs or effects on body weight or food intake. A slight 
decrease in the day of vaginal opening was noted at 20 mg/kg/day, but the toxicological significance of 
this effect is uncertain since the value was within the historical control data range. There was no POS-
related effect on any of the behavioral assessments, on fertility, reproductive function, or development 
of the F2offspring. 
Minimal transient decreases were observed on PND 42 in red blood cell count, hemoglobin and 
hematocrit for females and males at all dose levels that correlated with slightly increased mean 
corpuscular volume values but were not associated with an increase in reticulocyte counts. The 
changes observed in the red blood cell counts may have been associated with the microscopic findings 
(extramedullary hematopoiesis) observed in the spleen at terminal necropsy. There were mild 
increases in cholesterol levels observed in males at 20 mg/kg/day and females at 5 and 20 mg/kg/day 
on PND 42. A comparable increase in cholesterol levels was also observed at the end of the dosing 
period (PND 92) in males and females at 20 mg/kg/day. On PND 42, slight increases in sodium were 
observed in males at 5 and 20 mg/kg/day and females at 20 mg/kg/day. Females at 20 mg/kg/day 
also exhibited significantly lower potassium levels. On PND 92, males at 20 mg/kg/day and females at 
5 and 20 mg/kg/day exhibited slight decreases in potassium and chloride levels. Minimal decreases in 
albumin and globulin levels resulted in slight decreases in total protein levels in males and females at 
20 mg/kg/day. In addition, on PND 92, females at 20 mg/kg/day showed statistically higher levels of

sodium concentration. At the end of the dosing period (PND 90 and 91), a marked increase in urine 
volume in females was noted, with a corresponding decrease in urine specific gravity and osmolality at 
20 mg/kg/day, in addition to a minimal increase in urine volume observed in females at 5 mg/kg/day, 
associated with a decreased osmolality. Following the recovery period (PND 134), no noteworthy 
differences in hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis were noted as compared to controls, 
indicating recovery of these parameters. 
Males and females administered 20 mg/kg/day exhibited a slight decrease in femur width when 
measured on PND 21/22. At the end of the dosing phase on PND 92, a decrease in femur width was 
observed only in females at 20 mg/kg/day. There were no POS-related differences in the femoral bone 
measurement (length and width) in the animals at the end of the recovery period. 
At the end of the dosing phase, there was an increase in the weight of the adrenal glands in females at 
all dose levels and in males at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day. The weight of the pituitary gland was increased in 
females at all dose levels. Other POS-related differences in organ weights were seen in males and/or 
females at 20 mg/kg/day and consisted of increased kidney, heart, spleen, ovary, testis and liver 
(female only) weights. POS-related macroscopic changes were limited to enlargement of the adrenal 
glands of the males at 20 mg/kg/day and females at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day at the end of the dosing phase. 
There were no macroscopic observations attributed to the administration of POS in the animals 
assigned to the recovery subgroup in this study. 
At the end of the dosing phase, POS-related microscopic findings were observed in adrenal glands of 
males and females at all dose levels (vacuolation: zona fasciculata and/or hypertrophy: cortical); in 
the liver (vacuolation: hepatocellular, inflammation) of males and/or females given ≥ 5 mg/kg/day as 
well as in the bone marrow (hypercellularity: hematopoietic), lung (macrophage accumulation), ovary 
(vacuolation: interstitial cell), heart (infiltration: mixed cell) and spleen 
(hematopoiesis/extramedullary: increased) of males and/or females at 20 mg/kg/day. In addition, 
minimal to slight renal tubular dilatation was noted in males and females at all dose levels. Microscopic 
findings with unclear toxicological/biological significance were present and consisted of mammary 
adenocarcinoma observed in one female at 1 mg/kg/kg and one female at 5 mg/kg/day and salivary 
gland carcinoma observed in one female at 5 mg/kg/day. No POS-related microscopic findings were 
noted in the bone of the animals assigned to the toxicokinetic study. 
At the end of the 6-week recovery period, there remained a slight increase of the weight of the adrenal 
glands and testis at 20 mg/kg/day. In addition, following the recovery period, POS-related microscopic 
findings were observed only in the adrenal glands (angiectasis) of females at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day and in 
the liver (vacuolation: hepatocellular) of females at 20 mg/kg/day. While adrenal gland organ weights 
suggested at least partial recovery 6 weeks after the end of dosing, minimal to slight angiectasis was 
noted in females at ≥ 5mg/kg/day. Liver findings of hepatocellular vacuolation was considered minimal 
and showing a trend towards recovery. There was a complete reversal of the other POS-related 
microscopic findings described in the main study animals. 
c)  POS Oral Suspension: A 12-Week Oral (Gavage) Toxicity and Toxicokinetic Study of POS in 
Neonatal and Juvenile Rats (SN 09005) 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of POS on growth and morphological 
development of the mammary and salivary glands when administered orally at 0, 1, 5, and 20 
mg/kg/day by gavage to rats (48/sex/group) for 12 weeks from PND 7 to 91. An assessment of 
toxicokinetics in 12 rats/sex/group dosed up to PND 21 was also conducted. Assessment of toxicity 
was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, physical development 
(days to vaginal opening), organ weights (epididymides and testis), gross examination and 
Assessment report

histopathologic examination (limited to salivary and mammary glands and tissues with macroscopic 
abnormalities). 
There was no POS-related mortality. There were no toxicologically significant POS-related clinical signs 
or effects on the body weight or food intake values. No POS related changes were observed in days of 
development of vaginal opening. 
An increase of the absolute testis and epididymis weight in males at 20 mg/kg/kg was noted. There 
was also an increasing trend of the absolute weight for the testis in males at 20 mg/kg/day. However, 
these observations at 20mg/kg were not considered biologically significant and were not considered 
adverse. Macroscopic observations attributed to the administration of POS were enlarged adrenal 
glands in males and females at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day. 
There were no microscopic findings attributed to the administration of POS in the salivary glands or 
mammary glands examined. POS-related microscopic findings were observed in tissues showing 
macroscopic abnormalities and included cortical hypertrophy and/or vacuolation of the zona fasciculata 
in the adrenal glands (males and females at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day); tubular dilatation in the kidney (females 
at 20 mg/kg/day) and interstitial cell vacuolation in the ovary (females at 20 mg/kg/day). The findings 
in the adrenal glands, kidneys, and ovaries were consistent with findings in from the previous study in 
juvenile rats. 
d) Conclusion on juvenile rat studies 
In a definitive neonatal/juvenile rat study, POS oral suspension was administered at single daily oral 
(gavage) doses of 1, 5 or 20 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks from PND 7 to Day 91, followed by a 6-week 
recovery period (SN 07193). There was no new toxicity noted compared to adult rats and the results 
from this study were consistent with the known effects of POS and/or azole antifungals. 
Mammary adenocarcinomas were observed at 1 mg/kg/day (1/15 females) and 5 mg/kg/day (1/15 
females), and a salivary gland carcinoma was observed at 5 mg/kg/day (1/15 females). These 
observations were considered spurious and not related to the test article due to a lack of dose-
response (not observed at the high dose level), inconsistency with existing carcinogenicity data, and 
considering the absence of histologic trend indicating neoplastic progression (no other main group or 
recovery animals had any proliferative, hyperplastic or hyper secretory activity of any organs). A 
second study in rats of the same age and using the same dose levels but with greater statistical power 
was conducted to assess potential effects on mammary and salivary glands (study no. SN 09005). 
Tumor findings were not replicated in this more extensive study. 
The NOAEL in both neonatal/juvenile rat studies conducted with POS oral suspension was 1 mg/kg 
based on multiple histopathology findings consistent with existing data with POS in adult animals. 
The CHMP considered that a 3-month study in rats was performed at doses of 5, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day 
as part of the initial MAA for Noxafil. The target organs reported at all dose levels were adrenal glands, 
bone marrow, Harderian gland, heart, liver, lung, ovaries, pituitary gland, spleen and examined 
lymphoid tissues. Bone effects were also observed at 30 and 60 mg/kg/day (fractures, thinning), and 
tooth findings (hypertrophy of the periodontal membrane) were seen at 60 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL had 
been determined at 5 mg/kg/day. 
The findings reported in the new 12-week juvenile rat study are generally consistent with those 
observed in the 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study submitted to support the initial MAA of Noxafil. No 
additional target organ was identified. Of note, histopathological findings seen in ovaries and testes 
weight changes did not impact on the reproductive capacity of animals exposed to posaconazole. In 
addition, the slight bone effects (decrease width) seen at 20 mg/kg/day were reversible.

In the first juvenile study (SN 07193), mammary adenocarcinoma was reported in 1/15 females at 
each the low and mid dose level and corresponded to the subcutaneous masses detected at 
macroscopic examination after 8-9 weeks of dosing (from PND 68/69). In addition, a salivary gland 
carcinoma was observed in 1/15 female at the mid dose level. The relationship to treatment of these 
findings was considered as questionable due to the lack of dose-relationship (not seen in the high dose 
group), and considering also the absence of concern for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity from studies 
supporting the original approval of posaconazole. To further clarify this issue, a second 12-week study 
was conducted in rats of the same age treated at the same dose levels. It was focused on potential 
treatment-related effects on mammary and salivary glands, using a higher number of animals at 
histopathological examination (48/sex/group). No adverse effects attributable to posaconazole were 
observed in these tissues. Therefore, the MAH’s position on this issue is considered as acceptable. 
Overall, the toxicological profile of posaconazole appears as similar in juvenile and adult rats. Exposure 
levels at the NOAEL in the juvenile rats (1 mg/kg/day) were below those reached in paediatric 
patients.

* based on AUC0-24 levels of 23,000 and 25,000 ng.h/mL in children aged 2 to <7 years and 7 to 17 years, 
respectively, treated with posaconazole gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension (see SmPC 5.2) 
The dose-range finding study in juvenile dogs (no. SN 07367) was conducted with POS oral suspension 
to determine doses for the definitive study. The findings were consistent with those previously 
observed with POS in previous nonclinical studies and there were no new POS-related toxicities 
identified. 
The objective the definitive study was to evaluate the potential for neurotoxicity of POS when 
administered orally via gavage to juvenile beagle dogs for 39 weeks beginning on PND 4 and to assess 
the toxicokinetics of POS. A recovery period of 3 months was included. This study targeted evaluation 
of the nervous system in order to address the finding of neuronal phospholipidosis observed in adult 
dogs. Animals were dosed once daily by oral gavage from PND 4 through 276 for the toxicology 
subgroup and from PND 4 to PND 32 for the toxicokinetic subgroup. Assessment of toxicity was based 
on mortality, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmologic examinations, 
neurobehavioral assessments (motor, sensory, and autonomic pathways), clinical pathology, and gross 
and histopathological examinations. 
There were no test article-related mortality and clinical findings mostly resolved during the recovery 
period; however, an increased incidence of clear discharge from the eyes was still seen in females at 
≥15 mg/kg/day. Lower mean body weight gains and subsequently lower mean body weights were 
observed vs. controls at the end of the dosing period (PND 276) in males at 60 mg/kg/day and at all 
dose levels in females. These effects did not correlate with decreases in food consumption and did not 
persist through the recovery period for males. However, body weights remained lower than the control 
group throughout the recovery period for females, and these effects was considered adverse due to the 
percent differences from the control group (>10%). 
Some clinical pathology changes were observed during the treatment period, but none persisted after 
the 91-day recovery period. There were no POS-related ophthalmologic findings. POS-related increases 
in blood pressure were observed in the 60 mg/kg/day-dosed males on PND 108 and 269. No 
neurobehavioral findings were observed at any POS dose level. 
Posaconazole-related microscopic findings were all considered non-adverse and were limited to 
vacuolation of macrophages consistent with phospholipidosis (observed in previous studies in adult 
animals) in the following tissues: the lamina propria in the ileum in the 15 mg/kg/day males and 60 
mg/kg/day dose males and females; the subpleural and perivascular alveoli of the lung at all doses; 
the neuronal bodies of the Auerbach’s plexuses in the ileum in males at all doses and in the colon in 
males at 15 and 60 mg/kg/day; the Auerbach’s plexuses in the ileum and colon in females at 15 and 
60 mg/kg/day; in the Peyer’s patches of the ileum and colon in all POS-treated dose groups; and in the 
neurons of the geniculate nuclei in the midbrain of one dog that died on PND 35. The neuronal 
vacuolation in the midbrain was similar to that observed in the Auerbach’s plexuses in dogs examined

from the primary necropsy but was not observed in any other dog. This neuronal vacuolation is likely 
test article-related but did not contribute to the death of this dog. 
After the 3-month recovery period, the only POS-related finding that persisted was cytoplasmic 
vacuolation of the neurons in the Auerbach’s plexus of both the colon and ileum in the 15 and 60 
mg/kg/day group females. The lower number of vacuolated neurons and less extensive vacuolation 
than noted at the primary necropsy indicated that recovery was ongoing.

•  Study TT#12-9018: An Age-Targeted 6-Week Intravenous Injection Toxicity Study of 
POS with a Five-Month Postdose Period in Juvenile Beagle Dogs 
The objective of this study was to determine the potential toxicity of POS IV Solution when given by 
daily intravenous injection to juvenile beagle dogs for 6 weeks beginning on PND 14, with an 
evaluation of reversibility following a 5-month recovery period. Assessment of toxicity was based on 
clinical signs, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, observation battery and neurological 
examination, clinical pathology parameters (hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry), gross 
necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathological examinations. 
POS related clinical sings included fur staining (on limbs and/or abdomen) and liquid and/or foamy 
material. In addition, thinness and prominent backbone were observed in 2 males; one of these males 
also exhibited labored breathing and the other had partially closed eyes. At Week 6 ophthalmologic 
examinations, there was a slight increase in incidence of serous ocular discharge. This was considered 
as a minor non-adverse finding, shown to be reversible. Compared to vehicle controls, POS-related 
reductions in body weight gains were observed beginning on PND 31 in males and on PND 38 in 
females that persisted until the end of the recovery period. Slight and reversible, POS-related clinical 
chemistry changes were also noted at Week 7 postpartum. 
At the end of the dosing period, POS-related histological changes included dilation of the lateral 
ventricles of the brain and findings consistent with phospholipidosis (neuronal vacuolation) in the brain, 
spinal cord, myenteric and/or submucosal plexi, small intestine, large intestine and urinary bladder; 
accumulation of alveolar macrophages in the lungs; and histiocytic vacuolation in the spleen, lymph 
node, Peyer’s patches and thymus. Additional histological findings attributable POS were observed in 
the adrenal glands (hyperplasia of the zona fasciculata and atrophy of the zona glomerulosa) and 
thyroid (increased amount of colloid). At the end of the recovery period, there were no POS-related 
gross, microscopic or organ weight findings, indicating recovery of all findings. 
In conclusion, daily intravenous administration of posaconzole at 10 mg/kg/day to juvenile beagle dogs 
from PND 14 to 56 resulted in adverse clinical signs at the end of the treatment phase and a reduction 
in body weight and/or body weight gain. Reversible changes in some serum chemistry parameters 
were noted. At the end of the treatment phase, POS-related histomorphologic changes were present in 
the brain, spinal cord, adrenal glands, thyroid gland, urinary bladder, lung, spleen, lymph node, small 
intestine, Peyer’s patches, large intestine and thymus; however, these changes were reversible by the 
end of the recovery period. Based on these findings a NOAEL was not established. 
•  Study TT#14-1001: Three-Month Intravenous Toxicity Study in PostWeaning Juvenile 
Dogs with a 9-Week Treatment-Free Period  
The purpose of this study was to determine the potential effects on brain and ventricle size of POS 
when administered intravenously at 0 or 10 mg/kg/day to juvenile dogs (approximately 10 weeks old 
at study start) once daily for approximately 3 months. The first 5 animals/ sex/group were designated 
for interim necropsy at the end of treatment phase, and the last 4 animals/sex/group were designated 
for final necropsy after a 9-week treatment-free period. Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, 
clinical observations, body weights, clinical pathology evaluations (one early-death animal only) and 
anatomic pathology evaluations. Drug concentrations in the plasma of treated and control animals 
were determined. In addition, exploratory measurement of drug concentrations in the CSF and brain 
samples from all groups were conducted. Exploratory MRI examinations were conducted on the brain 
to evaluate the brain ventricle volumes. 
A drug-treated female dog was sacrificed on Day 25, with clinical signs, clinical pathology findings, and 
postmortem changes consistent with hemorrhage secondary to physical injury. However, the role of 
the test article as a contributing cause for the hemorrhage could not be ruled out. Additional changes

in this dog included vacuolated macrophages in some lymphoid tissues (lymph node and Peyer’s 
patches), consistent with phospholipidosis, and changes secondary to hemorrhage and stress. 
There were no test article-related clinical observations or body weight changes. There were no test 
article-related brain weight changes or gross findings following 13 weeks of dosing or the 9-week 
treatment free-period. There were no test article-related histomorphologic findings in the brain 
following 13 weeks of dosing. 
There were no test article-related effects on brain ventricle volumes in the exploratory MRI 
examinations. In addition, POS mean concentrations in CSF and brain (exploratory) are presented in

•  Study TT#13-062: Three-Month Intravenous Infusion Toxicity Study in Dogs 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential toxicity (with a targeted evaluation of the 
brain) of POS administered intravenously for approximately 3 months at 0 or 9 mg/kg/day 
(4/sex/group) to young adult dogs (31 to 35 weeks of age at study start). Assessment of toxicity was 
based on mortality, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, gross examination, organ 
weight of brain, and thorough histomorphologic examination of brain. Drug concentrations in the 
plasma in the treated and control samples were determined. In addition, exploratory measurement of 
drug concentration in the CSF, and brain samples from all groups were conducted. Exploratory MRI 
examinations were conducted on the brain to evaluate the brain ventricle volumes. 
All animals survived to scheduled sacrifice. There were no test article-related clinical signs. There were 
no test article-related body weight or food consumption changes. 
There were no test article-related changes in brain weights or histomorphologic findings in the brain. 
The ventricles of the brain in treated dogs were similar to control dogs when evaluated by gross 
observation during trimming of the fixed brain and by histomorphology. There were multiple pale foci 
on the lungs of 7 of the 8 dogs treated with POS which were considered likely due to phospholipidosis. 
There were no test article-related changes in brain ventricle volumes as determined by MRI. No 
differences in brain ventricle volume were seen between groups. POS concentrations in CSF and brain 
are presented in Table 8.

c)  Discussion and conclusion on juvenile dog studies 
The definitive juvenile dog study (SN 07194) conducted orally targeted evaluation of the nervous 
system in order to address the finding of neuronal phospholipidosis observed in adult dogs. The results 
were consistent with those previously observed with posaconazole and there were no new 
posaconazole-related toxicities. Neuronal phospholipidosis was observed in the midbrain (1 female at 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 25/91 
 
 
 
 
60 mg/kg/day) and Auerbach’s plexus (males at all doses, females at ≥15 mg/kg/day); as with the 
neuronal phospholipidosis observed in the adult dogs, there were no effects on motor, sensory and 
autonomic pathways at all doses. The NOAEL was 15 mg/kg/day for males and ≤ 5 mg/kg/day for 
females based on decreased body weights (males at 60 mg/kg/day, females at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day) and 
vacuolation of macrophages in the ileum, colon, and/or Peyer’s patches at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day and the 
lungs at all dose levels consistent with phospholipidosis. After the 3-month recovery period, the only 
POS-related finding that persisted was cytoplasmic vacuolation of the neurons in the Auerbach’s plexus 
of both the colon and ileum in the 15 and 60 mg/kg/day group females. The lower number of 
vacuolated neurons and less extensive vacuolation than noted at the primary necropsy indicated that 
recovery was on-going. 
Two studies were then conducted with daily administration of the POS IV solution to juvenile beagle 
dogs at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks to preweaning juvenile dogs (study TT#12-9018), and for 
13 weeks to post-weaning juvenile dogs (study TT#14-1001). 
✓ 
In  study  TT#12-9018,  dogs  were  treated  from  PND  14  to  56.  The  age  of  animals  during  the 
treatment  period  generally  corresponds  approximately  to  a  human  developmental  age  from  3 
months to 2 years of age (Beck et al., 2006). The results from this study were consistent with the 
known effects of POS and/or azole antifungals with the exception of enlargement (dilatation) of 
the lateral ventricles of the brain. This finding was noted in 2/4 females and 3/4 males at the end 
of the dosing phase and was most likely attributed to POS IV solution, since it was not observed 
in  either  the  vehicle  or  placebo  control  groups.  There  were  no  neurologic  or  behavioral 
abnormalities in the juvenile dogs with enlarged ventricles, no histomorphologic changes in the 
surrounding brain parenchyma or in the ependymal cells of the lateral ventricles, no toxicologically 
relevant ophthalmic findings and, other than the expected neuronal phospholipidosis, there were 
no  other  abnormalities 
in 
the  brain.  Following 
the  5-month 
treatment-free  period, 
histomorphologic  dilatation  of  the  lateral  ventricles  was  similar  in  incidence  between  placebo 
control and POS IV solution-treated groups. 
✓  Study TT#14-1001 was conducted to further assess the potential effects of POS IV solution on the 
brain and ventricle size using older (post-weaning) dogs treated for 13 weeks from 10 weeks of 
age.  The  age  of  the  juvenile  dogs  during  the  treatment  period  corresponds  approximately  to  a 
human developmental age from 2 to 17 years of age (Beck et al., 2006). Ventricular development 
was evaluated in the brain during dosing by MRI following 4, 8 and 12 weeks of POS IV solution 
administration. The results showed that the lateral, third and fourth ventricles were no different 
from controls, as determined by MRI examination and confirmed by macroscopic and microscopic 
evaluation of the brain. 
Moreover, a 3-month study (TT#13-602) with targeted evaluation of the brain was conducted in young 
adult dogs (31 to 35 weeks of age at study start) dosed intravenously once daily at 9 mg/kg to 
evaluate the finding of ventricular dilatation. Results indicated that there were no test article-related 
changes in brain ventricle volumes as assessed by MRI evaluations following 3, 7 and 12/13 weeks of 
POS IV solution administration. The lack of enlarged ventricles was confirmed at necropsy. The 
ventricles of the brain in treated dogs were similar to control dogs when evaluated by gross 
observation and there were no histomorphologic brain findings. 
The results of these studies were consistent with the known effects of POS and/or azole antifungals 
with the exception of enlargement (dilatation) of the lateral ventricles of the brain observed only when 
POS IV solution was administered to juvenile dogs aged 2 to 8 weeks, which corresponds to human 
development from age 3 months to 2 years (Beck et al., 2006). 
It is important to note that development of the ventricles in the brain is markedly different between 
dogs and humans. In dogs, there is a period of rapid expansion of the ventricles relative to brain size 
from 3 to 10 weeks postnatal, whereas in humans this period of rapid ventricular expansion occurs in

utero (Kii et al., 1998; Knickmeyer et al., 2008; Roza et al., 2008). Thus, the developmental stage of 
ventricular growth differs markedly between dogs and humans, which makes it complex to translate 
the POS IV solution-related findings in very young juvenile Beagle dogs to humans. Brain ventricular 
enlargement was not observed during or after POS IV solution administration to post-weaning juvenile 
dogs aged 10 to 22 weeks, representing human development from 2 to 17 years of age. This finding 
was also not observed following POS IV solution administration to young adult dogs for 3 months or 
young adult monkeys for 1 month (study no. SN 08110, refer to POS IV solution Marketing 
Application), representing human development from 17 years through adulthood. Plasma 
concentrations observed in these studies exceeded those at which brain ventricular enlargement was 
observed. Therefore, the potential risk of enlarged ventricles is not considered relevant to adults (≥ 18 
years) or to children aged ≥ 2 to 17 years. 
In conclusion, the MAH believed that existing nonclinical study data as well as available human clinical 
study data (both adult and paediatric), support the safe administration of POS IV solution and POS PFS 
in paediatric patients ≥2 years of age. 
The CHMP noted that the findings of the 9-month oral juvenile dog study initiated in neonatal animals 
(4 days of age) were in line with those observed in adult dogs. Neuronal phospholipidosis was reported 
in the Auerbach’s plexus of both the colon and ileum at the end of treatment period, with recovery still 
ongoing after a 3-month recovery period in females dosed at 15 mg/kg/day and above. Neuronal 
vacuolation was also noted in the geniculate nuclei of the midbrain of one high dosed female dead 
prematurely. To further address this point, further sections of midbrain were obtained to fully evaluate 
the geniculate nuclei (medial and/or lateral) in the remaining dogs (when possible). Vacuolation of 
neurons in these sections or in any other section of brain were not observed in other animals. These 
findings were not associated with functional effects on motor, sensory and autonomic pathways at up 
to 60 mg/kg/day (x2.5-3.6 clinical exposure), as in adult animals where neuronal phospholipidosis 
seen in dogs was considered as unlikely to be of clinical significance. Of potential relevance for 
paediatric development is the decrease in body weight values seen in high dosed males and all treated 
females, shown to be non-reversible in females at all dose levels. At the NOAEL identified for males, 
exposure levels were either lower or slightly above the clinical exposure (x0.7-3.3) while there was no 
NOAEL for females. This study was reviewed previously by the CHMP, and constitutes the basis of the 
wording for SmPC section 5.3. 
Studies conducted by the intravenous route no. TT#12-9018 and TT#13-602 were discussed 
previously by the CHMP during the line extension procedure for approval of the intravenous 
formulation (EMEA/H/C/000610/X/33/G). At that time, the MAH did not apply for any paediatric 
indication and the following conclusions were made: “In the 6-week juvenile dog study, in addition to 
the well characterised POS toxicities, enlargement of the lateral ventricles in the brain was observed. 
There were no neurological or behavioural abnormalities in the dogs with this finding. These findings 
were not observed in adult dogs administered POS IV Solution for three months where similar or 
higher POS exposures were attained relative to the juvenile studies. In addition, a suspension 
formulation of POS (not further developed for clinical application) was intravenously administered to 
young adult rats and young adult monkeys for three month durations and was without brain ventricular 
dilation findings; POS systemic exposures were similar or exceeded those achieved in the juvenile dog 
study testing POS IV solution. The MAH hypothesised that observation of brain ventricular dilation 
following POS IV Solution administration in juvenile dogs, but not in other studies, suggests that 
potential interference to brain ventricle development may account for findings in the juvenile dog 
studies with POS IV Solution. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown, although the fact that 
the finding was reported in only one study provides reassurance. This finding is included in section 5.3 
of the SPC and the use of posaconazole in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended.”

EMA/702418/2021  
Page 27/91 
 
 
 
 
Since then, a 13-week study performed in dogs aged 10 weeks at treatment initiation and treated at 
the same dose level (10 mg/kg/day) was completed. Enlargement of lateral ventricles in the brain was 
not reported by MRI examination during the study and at necropsy by macroscopic and microscopic 
evaluation of the brain. This would confirm that in dogs, posaconazole-induced enlargement of brain 
ventricle occurs after exposure during the earlier stages of postnatal brain development (from PND14) 
but not at later stages (from 10 weeks of age, or in young adults). It is noted that this finding was not 
observed in the oral juvenile dog study initiated in 4 days old animals (as described in SmPC 5.3). 
The MAH discussed the translation to human infants of posaconazole-related enlargement of brain 
ventricle volume noted in the juvenile dog study #TT-12-9018 based on an interspecies comparison of 
brain ventricle development. In essence, it is suggested that this effect may not be relevant to children 
above 2 years of age since it occurs during a period of rapid ventricular extension which takes place 
from 3 to 10 weeks postnatal in dogs vs. prenatally (in utero) in humans. From the provided literature, 
it appears the onset of ventricular extension ranged from PND 23-32 in 14 dogs, this phenomenon 
progressing rapidly up to PND75 followed by a slower increase up to PND210 (Kii et al., 1998). In 
humans, both decreases and increases in ventricular size have been reported in utero (Roza et al., 
2008), with reports of a rapid increase of lateral ventricle volume by the first week of life (due to an 
increase in volume of CSF due to change from low fetal to high neonatal pressure circulatory state) 
followed by gradual increases during the following 6 months (Kii et al., 1998). Other authors report a 
large increase in volume of lateral ventricles during the first postnatal year followed by a decrease 
during the second year (Knickmeyer et al., 2008). Therefore, the CHMP considered that it would 
appear that the sensitive period for brain ventricle development in dogs would correspond to a 
developmental stage spanning the first post-natal year in humans.  
2.5.5.  Implications of the assessment of non-clinical data for the Safety 
Specification of the Risk Management Plan (RMP)  
The implications summarised in the table below were considered by the CHMP to be acceptable:  
Section 5.3 of the SmPC states that the clinical significance of this finding is unknown; therefore, the 
use of posaconazole to patients under 2 years of age is not recommended.

2.5.7.  Discussion and conclusions on non-clinical aspects 
To support the extension of indication of NOXAFIL intravenous solution to patients from 2 to 18 years 
of age, and approval of a new oral formulation for use in the same patient population, the MAH 
submitted a series of juvenile toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs by the oral route of 
administration, as well as studies wherein juvenile and young adult dogs were treated intravenously. 
In the pivotal 12-week rat and 9-month dog juvenile toxicity studies, treatment was initiated in 
animals of an age generally covering the paediatric population from birth (i.e. 7 days old rats and 4 
days old dogs). In these studies, the toxicological profile of posaconazole was consistent with that 
already defined in adult animals of each species. There was no additional target organ, or no new toxic 
effect of concern identified in any study. In particular, there was no treatment-related impact on the 
reproductive capacity of rats, and no effect on neurobehavioral parameters evaluated in both species. 
The latter aspect is of particular importance in dogs since neuronal phospholipidosis was reported in 
line with adult dog studies where it was considered as unlikely to be of clinical significance. A 
treatment-related effect on body weight was observed in juvenile dogs and was not reversed at all 
dose levels in females. NOAELs of 1 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day were determined in rats and in 
male dogs, respectively, whereas none could be determined in female dogs. Considering the 
toxicokinetic data in each study, it has to be considered that there was no safety margin in rats and

female dogs, while the exposure levels at the male dog NOAEL was either lower or slightly above the 
clinical exposure (x0.7-3.3).  
A 6-week juvenile toxicity study was conducted in dogs with the intravenous solution at a dose of 10 
mg/kg/day and evaluated previously by the CHMP. At that time, it was concluded that in addition to 
the well-characterised POS toxicities, enlargement of the lateral ventricles in the brain was observed in 
this study. There were no neurological or behavioural abnormalities in the dogs with this finding. It was 
pointed out that these findings were not observed in adult dogs administered POS IV Solution for three 
months where similar or higher POS exposures were attained relative to the juvenile studies. In 
addition, brain ventricular dilation was not reported in young adult rats and young adult monkeys 
dosed intravenously for three months with a suspension formulation of not further developed for 
clinical application at systemic exposures similar or exceeded those achieved in the juvenile dog study 
testing POS IV solution. The MAH hypothesised that observation of brain ventricular dilation following 
POS IV Solution administration in juvenile dogs, but not in other studies, suggests that potential 
interference to brain ventricle development may account for findings in the juvenile dog studies with 
POS IV Solution. The clinical significance of this finding was considered as unknown, although the fact 
that the finding was reported in only one study provides reassurance. This finding was included in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC with a statement that the use of posaconazole in patients under 18 years of 
age is not recommended.  
In the application covered by this Assessment Report, an additional 13-week study conducted in 
juvenile dogs with the POS IV solution at the same dose level of 10 mg/kg/day is submitted. Animals 
were 10 weeks of age at initiation. Brain ventricular dilation was not reported by MRI examination 
during the study and at necropsy by macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of the brain. This would 
confirm that in dogs, posaconazole-induced enlargement of brain ventricle occurs after exposure 
during the earlier stages of postnatal brain development (from PND14) but not at later stages (from 10 
weeks of age, or in young adults). It was noted that this finding was not observed in the oral juvenile 
dog study initiated in 4 days old animals, however lower systemic exposure levels were reached in that 
study. Section 5.3 of the SmPC now specifies that the use of posaconazole in patients under 2 years of 
age is not recommended. 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH discussed the translation to human infants of posaconazole-related enlargement of brain 
ventricle volume noted in the juvenile dog study initiated in 14 days old dogs based on an interspecies 
comparison of brain ventricle development. Further information was requested on this issue since 10 
week-old dog (not shown to develop the lesion) would correspond to children older than 2 years of age 
based on an overall developmental interspecies comparison (Buelke Sam 2003). The MAH explained 
that human risk assessment should rely primarily on specific organ system development. Since some 
literature data would suggest that the sensitive period for brain ventricle development in dogs would 
correspond to a developmental stage not exceeding the first post-natal year in humans, this position 
was viewed as acceptable. As the extension of indication is sought for patients from 2 years of age 
wherein no adverse effects indicative of morphological changes in the brain were reported, SmPC 
Section 5.3 now indicates that the clinical significance of this finding is unknown and that the use of 
posaconazole in children below 2 years of age is not recommended. It was also recommended that a 
common wording for juvenile toxicity findings should be included in SmPC 5.3 of any pharmaceutical 
formulation indicated in paediatric patients for consistency of the information provided to the 
prescriber. Therefore, a slight amendment of the SmPC Section 5.3 wording for Noxafil 300 mg 
concentrate for solution for infusion was carried out.

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.6.2.1.  Introduction 
Posaconazole (POS, MK-5992, NOXAFIL ®) is a broad spectrum systemic triazole antifungal that inhibits 
lanosterol  14  α-demethylase  (also  known  as  CYP51),  an  enzyme  essential  for  the  biosynthesis  of 
ergosterol comprising the cell membrane microorganisms. 
The currently marketed formulations of POS are an OS (oral suspension), an IV and an oral delayed-
release  tablet  (also  as  referred  to  as  a  gastro-resistant  tablet,  hereafter  referred  as  tablet).  The  POS 
tablet  was  developed  to  overcome  some  of  the  absorption  limitations  encountered  with  the  OS 
formulation including the need of BID or TID dosing administered with a meal or nutritional supplement 
in order to achieve target pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures. The POS IV formulation was developed to 
fulfil an unmet medical need for patients who are unable to take or absorb an oral formulation. 
POS is currently approved in many countries and regions including US and EU for prophylaxis and, in 
some countries, for salvage treatment of antifungal infections in adults. Specifically approved indications 
include the use as treatment of refractory IFI, prophylaxis of IFI in patients at high risk of developing 
these infections, and as treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OS only). 
The POS tablet is supplied at a dosage strength of 100 mg and the IV formulation as a solution containing 
300 mg POS per 16.7 mL solution (18 mg/mL). 
The recommended dosing regimen for IV and tablet in adults is 300 mg BID on the first day, as a loading 
dose followed by 300 mg QD as a maintenance dose. 
The key PK properties obtained from adults’ data are briefly summarized below: 
• 
POS tablets are absorbed with a median Tmax of 4 to 5 hours and exhibit dose proportional PK 
after single and multiple dosing up to 300 mg. F is 54%. 
• 
POS has a distribution volume of 261 L, indicating extravascular distribution and is highly protein 
bound (> 98%). 
• 
POS  primarily  circulates  as  the  parent  compound  in  plasma  and  does  not  have  any  major 
circulating metabolites. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are glucuronide conjugates 
of POS with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP40 mediated) metabolites. POS is primarily 
metabolized via UDP glucuronidation and is a substrate of P-gp efflux. 
• 
POS after administration of 300 mg POS IV is slowly eliminated with a mean half-life of 27 hours 
and CL of 7.3 L/h. Following tablet administration, POS is eliminated with mean half-life of 26 
to 31 hours and CL of 7.5 to 11 L/h. Steady-state is reached by Day 6 for both formulations. 
According to these past approvals, a wealth of PK information of POS in adults is available. Hence PK 
properties are considered as well known in adults. Consequently, this assessment report will focus on 
specific and relevant PK (and PD aspects) in association with the current submission: extension of the 
indications of POS in children and adolescent patients from 2 to < 18 years. 
As  part  of  the  paediatric  investigations,  an  additional  paediatric  formulation,  PFS,  also  referred  to  as 
powder for delayed release oral suspension has been developed. A relative bioavailability study in healthy 
adult volunteers was performed to investigate performance of this new formulation against the tablet 
formulation in clinical study P106. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 33/91 
 
 
 
 
PFS was supplied in sachets co-packaged with notch-tip oral dosing syringes, PIBA, suspending vehicle 
and  mixing  cups.  Prior  to  dosing,  the  PFS  is  dispersed  in  suspending  vehicle  to  obtain  a  10  mL  of 
suspension  with  a  concentration  of  30  mg/mL.    A  10  mL  syringe  can  only  deliver  a  maximum  8  mL, 
therefore the POS PFS kit can deliver a maximum dose of 240 mg. 
Both IV and PFS formulations were used in a Phase 1 b paediatric clinical study (P097), in support of 
expanding the POS indications using a PK and safety bridging strategy.  
Previously, the proposed PK bridging strategy, designed in consultation with FDA and EMA, have been 
already used to support extrapolation of the indications supported by OS to tablet and IV formulation in 
adults wherein efficacy was not a primary objective. The predefined exposure target was set at ≥ 90% 
of subjects achieving Cavg ≥ 500 ng/mL. 
Following  the  same  PK  bridging  strategy  (same  PK  exposure  target)  and  a  developed  Population  PK 
analysis (PPK), the dosing regimen initially proposed for IV and PFS in paediatric subjects aged 2 to < 
18 years is a weight-based according to: 
• 
• 
For all paediatric patients, the proposed dose should be taken BID the first day and QD thereafter 
IV route: 6 mg/kg (maximum dose of 300 mg)  
•  Oral route and BW ≤ 40 kg: 6 mg/kg PFS 
•  Oral route and BW > 40 kg: 300 mg tablet 
2.6.2.2.  Methods 
•  Analytical methods 
A HPLC/MS/MS assay procedure was used to quantify POS plasma concentration and was validated by 
PPD® (Middleton, WI and Richmond, VA). The plasma assay isolated POS and its internal standard from 
plasma using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatographic separations. This assay was used 
to support the clinical studies P097 and P106, and is presented in Table 9.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard non-compartmental (model independent) pharmacokinetic methods were used to calculate PK 
parameters. Concentration below the LLOQ observed before Tlast was set to 0 prior to the PK analysis. 
Estimated PK parameters were Cmax, Tmax (both observed), AUC0-24, AUC0-72, C0, Cmin, Cavg, CL 
and CL/F using Phoenix® WinNonlin® v.6.4 software (CertaraTM, Princeton, NJ).  
POS PK data following both IV and PFS formulation in the paediatric population were pooled to develop 
a  PPK  model  using  NONMEM,  version  7.2  (Globomax,  7250  Parkway  Drive,  Suite  430,  Hanover,  MD 
21076  USA).  The  applied  estimation  method  was  FOCE  with  an  additive  model  for  RUV  on  log-
transformed data. 
The  CHMP  considered  that,  generally,  based  on  the  validation  report,  the  used  bioanalytical  method 
developed  for  the  quantification  of  POS,  in  human  plasma  comply  with  acceptance  criteria  regarding 
selectivity, sensitivity accuracy and precision. Analytical validation report was provided with satisfactory 
results.  
Short and long-term stability of the analyte in biological matrix were tested and shown to be satisfactory. 
ISR were performed with satisfactory results (more than 99% of the studied sample) for all analytes.

Study P106 
Design 
This  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  3  period,  single-dose,  crossover  study  in  healthy  adult  male  and 
female subjects. This study was designed to estimate the relative bioavailability of POS PFS compared 
to  the  approved  POS  tablet  following  single-dose  administration  of  POS  under  fasting  conditions.  The 
effect of food on POS PK administered as the PFS formulation was also evaluated. 
13 subjects received the following three treatments in a randomized crossover design, with a minimum 
of 10-day washout between each treatment: 
- 
- 
Treatment A: 100 mg POS PFS (with water as diluent) fasted overnight for at least 10 hours 
Treatment B: 100 mg POS PFS (with water as diluent) following a standardized high-fat meal 
within 30 min prior to dosing 
- 
Treatment C: 100 mg POS tablet, fasted overnight for at least 10 hours 
POS product  
PK sampling  
Blood samples were obtained following each treatment and POS in plasma was quantified at predose, 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours post dose. In addition, dry blood spots (DBS) for determination of 
whole blood POS were also performed. 
PK results 
A  statistical  summary and  comparison  of  POS plasma PK for  each of  the 3 treatments is displayed in 
Table  10.  Arithmetic  mean  POS  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  in  healthy  adult  subjects  are 
illustrated in Figure 1 below. 
The  GMR  (90%  CI)  for  POS  Cmax  and AUC0-72  between  the  PFS  formulation  (Treatment  A)  and  the 
tablet formulation (Treatment C) under fasting conditions were 1.17 (1.04, 1.33) and 1.19 (1.10, 1.28), 
respectively.  The  results  indicate  that  under  fasting  conditions  the  POS  PFS  formulation  achieved 
approximately  20%  higher  exposure  (in  terms  of  Cmax  and  AUC0-72)  as  compared  to  the  tablet 
formulation. Median Tmax was similar for both treatments. 
The GMR (90% CI) of POS Cmax and AUC0-72 between fed and fasted conditions for the PFS formulation 
were 0.67 (0.59, 0.77) and 0.94 (0.87, 1.02). Consumption of a high-fat meal together with the POS 
PFS formulation had no significant effect on AUC0-72 and resulted in a moderate (23% to 41%) decrease 
in Cmax.

The CHMP noted that a dedicated clinical study (P106, n=13) was performed to determine the relative 
bioavailability of the new paediatric formulation (PFS), relative to the tablet formulation (marketed) in 
healthy adult. In addition, the effect of food on POS PK administered as PFS was also investigated.  
PK results indicate that the extent of exposure (AUC0-72) was 19% higher with the PFS compared to 
the tablet formulation with GMR of  1.19 (90% CI  1.10-1.28).  Results remain similar for Cmax with a 
GMR of 1.17 (90% CI 1.04-1.33) for PFS compared to tablet. Both 90% CI fell outside the 0.8-1.25 BE 
limits.  
Under fed conditions for PFS, only Cmax was moderately impacted (23 to 41% decrease) whereas AUC0-
72 remain similar. Therefore, the recommendation that PFS can be administered with or without food is 
acceptable. 
2.6.2.4.  Pharmacokinetics in target population 
This extension of the indications of POS in the paediatric population, aged 2 to < 18 years included one 
PPK analysis. This analysis was performed following the results from Study P097.

- Study P097 
Design 
This  was  a  non-randomized,  multicentre,  open-label,  sequential  dose-escalation  study  designed  to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of the IV and PFS formulations of POS in paediatric subjects with 
actual or anticipated neutropenia and who were at risk for developing IFI.  
118 subjects between the ages of 2 to < 18 years were enrolled and divided in two groups (2 to < 7 
years and 7 to < 18 years). Three POS dose levels were assessed, 3.5 mg/kg, 4.5 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg 
daily. 
In  each  dose  cohort,  paediatric  subjects  received  POS  IV  BID  on  Day  1,  then  QD  on  Days  2  to  10. 
Thereafter subjects received POS PFS QD or continued on IV if they were unwilling or unable to tolerate 
POS PFS. 
The maximum total duration of treatment was 28 days. The maximum dose was set to 300 mg. Steady 
state POS plasma concentration profiles based upon rich PK sampling were obtained after 7 to 10 days 
of dosing of each formulation. 
PK sampling 
For both formulations, after 7 to 10 days of continuous dosing steady-state POS plasma concentrations 
were determined at pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours post administration. 
Results 
Of the 118 enrolled subjects, 115 subjects started on IV treatment and 15 of those were not included 
in the PK analysis. Reasons for exclusion from the IV PK were PK concentrations not obtained (9/15), 
dose was not given within 6h of scheduled time (5/15), and PK outlier (1/15). 
Of 63 subjects who transitioned to the PFS treatment and received at least one PFS dose, 13 were not 
included in the PK analysis. Reasons for exclusion were PK data not obtained (10/13) and incomplete 
PFS dose taken (3/13). 
Non-compartmental PK analysis 
A  summary  of  mean  PK  parameters  based  on  NCA  by  dose  cohort,  age  group,  and  formulation  is 
presented in Table 11.

Table 11: Summary of POS plasma SS PK parameters values following multiple dose of IV or 
PFS formulations 
The CHMP noted that, for the 6 mg/kg dose cohort, for both age groups (2-<7 years and 7 to <18 years), 
Cmax,ss was approximately twice greater with IV compared to PFS (3060 vs 1510 ng/mL and 3340 vs 
1370 ng/mL). 
In  contrast  to  the  other  dose  cohort  (3.5  and  4.5  mg/kg)  where  Cavg,ss  appears  generally  similar 
between IV and PFS within each age group, for the 6 mg/kg dose cohort, such trend is not observed. 
Target attainment (PK bridging) 
The  exposure  target  specified  in  the  protocol  for  the  IV  and  PFS  formulations  was  to  identify  a  dose 
regimen  that  would  result  in  a  geometric  mean  Cavg  of  ~  1200  ng/mL  with  approximately  90%  of 
subjects having Cavg between 500 and 2500 ng/mL. These targets were discussed and agreed by FDA 
and PDCO. 
Bearing in mind these targets, Table 12 presents the observed PK target attainment. Overall Cavg data 
calculated by NCA indicate that the PK targets were not attained for the 3.5-mg/kg per day dose group. 
The PK targets were generally achieved for the 4.5- and 6.0-mg/kg per day dose levels for each age 
group and formulation. The higher exposure observed overall for the 6 mg/kg per day dose increases 
the proportion of subjects with posaconazole concentrations exceeding a value of 500 ng/mL associated 
with  efficacy  even  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  interval  (i.e.,  Cmin)  while  remaining  within  the  typical 
concentration range over which safety data have been obtained.

Dose was scaled by BW up to a maximum total dose of 300 mg, the recommended adult dose for both 
IV and oral tablet formulation. The BW above which subjects received 300 mg were 85.7, 66.7 and 50 
kg respectively for the 3.5, 4.5 and 6 mg/kg dose cohort. Individual and geometric mean Cavg for the 6 
mg/kg  per  day  dose  for  each  formulation  and  age  group  as  a  function  of  BW  is  shown  in  Figure  2. 
Subjects to the right of the vertical line received the maximum dose of 300 mg/day. Overall these plots 
show no obvious relationship between Cavg and BW particularly at 6 mg/kg per day, which supports the 
conclusion that the weight-based dosing approach used in Study P097 is appropriate.

The CHMP noted that the PK target (mean Cavg of ~ 1200 ng/mL with approximately 90% of subjects 
having Cavg between 500 and 2500 ng/mL) was mainly attained with the 4.5 mg/kg dose cohort, 
except for the IV and PFS group from low age (2 to < 7years) with Cavg below the 1200 ng/mL 
threshold. 
In contrast for the 6 mg/kg age group, except several subjects which were over-exposed with Cavg > 
2500 ng/mL (n=7), and one outlier with particularly low exposure (PFS, < 500 ng/mL), the 1200 
ng/mL threshold was not attained. 
Population Pharmacokinetic model 
Model development 
The analysis was conducted using data from study P097 only.  The concentration-time data for POS were 
modelled using a compartmental approach. Log transform PK data was considered. 
Covariates of interest of POS investigated were body weight (BW), body surface area (BSA), age, body 
mass index (BMI), gender, race, ethnicity, food status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, formulations. 
The PopPK model was built using nonlinear mixed effects model with the first order conditional estimation 
method (FOCE) in Nonmem 7.2. Since previous analysis of POS IV and PFS PK data in paediatric have 
used a 1 cpt model with first order absorption, a more complex model was not investigated. 
Except BW as used as part of the structural PK mode using allometric scaling, the other covariates were 
tested  using  a  stepwise/backward  selection  procedure.  Then  the  PopPK  model  was  evaluated  using  a 
pcVPC. 
In addition, in order to evaluate the final PK model, exposure parameters as Cavg and Cmin were derived 
from the post hoc EBE and compared to the available from NCA analysis. 
Then  a  simulation  exercise  was  performed  to  simulate  the  distribution  of  POS  exposure  in  both  age 
groups, in order to derive the following metrics (Cavg and Cmin) at specified time points (Day 10 and 
Assessment report

Day 28) under three dosing regimens (4.5, 6, 7.5 mg /kg) with a maximum absolute dose of 300 mg. 
The goal was to evaluate whether these dosing regimens for each route/formulation and without regards 
to meal provide exposures in each group that are associated with POS efficacy. 
Results 
The analysis  dataset included 1236 observations  from  114  paediatric  subjects aged 2 to 17  years.  In 
total,  80  samples  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  Of  these,  two  subjects  were  excluded  from  the 
analysis because of incomplete oral PFS dose intake (33 samples). For 31 observations, sampling time 
was not available. Furthermore, 13 samples had the same sampling time and were excluded as well.

The final base structural model was a one-compartment model with first order absorption, IIV on CL, Vc 
and F1, correlation between CL and Vc, estimated allometric exponent on CL and Vc, estimated F1 using 
a  logit  function  and  an  additive  error  model  in  the  logarithmic  scale.  All  model  parameters  were  well 
estimated, with RSE% values < 10% for the fixed effect parameters and <25% for the random effect 
parameters  (Table  15).  Estimates  of  the  allometric  exponents  for  body  weight  effects  on  CL  and  Vc 
(0.626  and  0.963,  respectively)  approximated  theoretical  values  (0.75  and  1,  respectively).  Eta-
shrinkage was low on CL (7%) and particularly high for both Vc and F1 (28 and 42% respectively). 
Overall the GOF plots presented in Figure 4 indicate that the structural PK model provide an adequate 
description of POS concentration time data, with no clear bias.

As BW was part of the structural PK model (with estimated allometric exponents), age, EGFR, sex and 
ethnicity effects were investigated on CL and V. Food effect was tested on F1. 
The  potential  effect  of  food  on  the  bioavailability  of  POS  PFS  was  assessed  after  completion  of  the 
stepwise covariate analysis (SCM). Food intake was captured through different covariates, an overview 
of which is included in Table 16. These different covariates captured information on food intake within 2 
hours prior to or up to 1 hour after the associated dose administration. In addition to the more granular 
covariate  categorizations  capturing  the  specific  pre-  or  post-dose  timing  as  well  as  meal  content,  an 
overall  food  covariate  was  created  (FOOD)  which  described  whether  the  dose  administration  was 
associated with any type of food intake between 2 hours prior to and 1 hour after the dose administration. 
Table 16: Description of food covariates tested after SCM analysis 
Results  of  this  analysis  are  provided  in  Table  17  below.  For  most  of  the  food  effect  covariates,  the 
inclusion of the covariate on F1 did not result in a statistically significant improvement in the fit of the 
population PK model per the defined criteria for covariate selection (P<0.01 as reflected by a decrease

in  OFV  of  at  least  6.63  for  the  addition  of  1  parameter,  or  at  least  11.345  for  the  addition  of  3 
parameters). For the 4-category overall food effect parameter, a statistically significant difference in OFV 
(-12.2) was observed; however, the food effect parameters were estimated with low precision (RSE > 
50%),  and  therefore  the  effect  was  not  maintained  in  the  final  model.  Therefore,  the  final  structural 
model without food effects is considered as the final model.

pcVPC are provided in Figure 5 (all data) and in Figure 6 split per age and formulations. Overall predictive 
performance are acceptable except for the 5th percentile which is probably attributable to low simulated 
values of F1, producing concentrations that are lower to those observed in the data.

Comparison between observed and predicted PK parameters 
Cavg and Cmin, respectively estimated and observed by NCA were compared to those predicted by the 
PPK model. Results are display in Figure 7 and Table 18. 
In general, Cavg and Cmin values after both IV and oral PFS administration approximate the identity line 
(black dashed line) for each of the included dose levels (3.5, 4.5 and 6 mg/kg), showing that the popPK 
model  is  able  to  reproduce  adequately  the  exposure  parameters  derived  from  the  NCA  analysis. 
Distributions of prediction errors for Cavg and Cmin derived from the PopPK analysis in comparison to 
those  from  the  NCA  analysis  were  summarized  by  the  MAH.  More  than  80%  of  the  individual  Cavg 
estimates  from  the  PopPK  are  less  than  20%  different  from  the  NCA-derived  values.  For  Cmin,  since 
based  on  a  single  concentration  value  per  individual,  deviations  between  the  estimates  from  the  two 
methods were somewhat larger, with up to 20% of estimates being more than 50% different. Overall, 
even  though  some  discrepancies  were  observed  between  NCA  and  PopPK  model  derived  exposure 
parameters,  these  were  not  indicative  of  any  particular  trend  of  a  bias  with  dose  or  route  of 
administration.

Simulation 
PK profiles for dose regimens of 4.5, 6 or 7.5 mg/kg BID IV dosing on Day 1 followed by QD IV up to 
Day 10 followed by QD oral PFS through Day 28 were simulated. Total dose was limited to 300 mg or 
less  to  avoid  any  paediatric  dose  that  exceeded  that  approved  for  adults  (300  mg).  Steady-state 
exposure parameters (Cavg, Cmin) were calculated after the last dosing of IV and PFS and the proportion 
of subjects achieving the target exposures were determined.  Distributions of Cavg and Cmin are also 
summarized in Table 19. Additionally, geometric mean Cavg and Cmin per dose, formulation and age 
group are summarized in Table 20.

Table 19: Proportion of subjects achieving specific ranges of simulated Cavg and Cmin at a 
dose regimen of 4.5, 6 or 7.5 mg/kg QD per age group 
As expected the proportions of Cavg above the target of 500 ng/mL were lower with oral than with IV 
administration in line with the bioavailability estimate of ~83% for the PFS administration. 
Table 20: Predicted geometric mean Cavg and Cmin at a dose regimen of 4.5, 6 and 7.5

Geometric mean Cavg are predicted to be above or around the target concentration of 1200 ng/mL at 
the dose regimens of 6 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg in both age groups and for both IV and PFS administrations. 
Overall, the simulation results for PFS and IV administration show that the dosing regimens of both 6 
mg/kg  and  7.5  mg/kg  achieve  the  required  steady-state  Cavg  values  (specifically,  greater  than  500

ng/mL  for  more  than  90%  of  subjects)  in  both  age  group  populations,  irrespective  of  the  route  of 
administration. 
Simulation of tablet vs PFS dosing regimens  
For POS tablets 300 mg/day, model-predicted Cavg achieved the PK target of Cavg > 500 ng/mL in 90% 
of subjects across the entire weight range is presented in Table 21. The distribution of model predicted 
Cavg shifted lower with increasing weight as shown in Figure 8. Compared to PFS, model predicted Cavg 
for the tablet was 20% lower for cohorts with body weights greater than 50 kg where the tablet and PFS 
dose were both 300 mg. This reflects the relative bioavailability (PFS/tablet = 1.2) of the 2 formulations. 
For  40  to  50  kg  body  weight  cohort,  model-predicted  Cavg  was  similar  between  the  tablet  and  PFS 
formulations and for the 30 to 40 kg cohort, model predicted Cavg was higher for tablet compared to 
PFS. These results reflect the fixed 300 mg dose for tablet and weight-based 6 mg/kg dose for PFS in 
these weight ranges.

PPK model 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  PPK  model  presented  by  the  MAH  is  based  on  PK  data  from  N=114 
paediatric  subjects  from  which  n=1236  PK  samples  were  available.  Then,  according  to  the  MAH  80 
samples were excluded for various acceptable reasons, and of these 2 subjects were excluded. Finally, 
during the model building several outliers were excluded, n=3. Therefore, based on this information it is 
expected N=112 paediatric subjects with n=1153 PK samples. However, based on the control stream, 
N=112 subjects with n=1187 PK observations were considered. 
The PPK model consisted of 1 cpt PK model parameterized in terms of CL, Vc, ka and F1. BW allometric 
scaling with estimated exponents (0.624 and 0.963 for CL and Vc) were considered. Ka was fixed, CL, 
Vc and F1 were estimated at 4.71 L/h, 112 L and 0.826, respectively with moderate IIV for CL and Vc 
(37.1 and 27.7 %), and particularly high for F1 (202%). Eta-shrinkage is acceptable for CL only (7%).  
The effect of food, investigated on F1 with eta-shrinkage of 47% is questioned. Any output of this analysis 
should be considered with cautions. 
Overall PK parameters were estimated with a good precision, GOF does not show a particular bias and 
pcVPC shows reasonably adequate predictive performance (except for the 5th percentile).  
Cavg and Cmin, NCA vs PPK 
Compared to Cavg estimated by NCA, Cavg predicted by the PPK model for both formulations and for 
both age group remain reasonable (more than 80% with RE below 20%). However, the PPK model seems 
to over-predict Cmin with PFS mainly for the 6 mg/kg dose cohort.

Simulation  
1) PK target attainment 
Result of the first simulation exercise show that the use of a 6 mg/kg dose fulfill the PK target of >90% 
of Cavg between 500 and 2500 ng/mL.  
Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the 2-<7 years aged group, a low but non negligible risk of 
6.8% of virtual paediatric patients are predicted to have a Cavg below 500 ng/mL with the proposed 6 
mg/kg dose with the PFS formulation. Whereas with 7.5 mg/kg dose which have never been tested in 
the paediatric population it is predicted a risk of 2.9% with Cavg below 500 ng/mL associated to an 
inflated risk of over-exposure for both formulation (> 2500 ng/mL). 
However, based on a Cmin target which can be considered as a more conservative PK parameter, 
which is currently used in clinical practice using TDM, there is a high risk of 30% and 20% of under-
exposure with the 6 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg dose respectively. This was identified as a concern, bearing 
in mind the EUCAST recommendation to target a Cmin of 700 ng/mL for prophylaxis and 1000 ng/mL 
for the treatment of IFD. This particularly questioned the use of a systematic TDM for POS and 
required a thorough discussion regarding if an increased dose per kg was warranted in the lower 
weight groups. [Q56 and 57 or D150] 
2) Tablet vs PFS dosing regimens 
Result of the simulation exercise support the use of a 300 mg dose for paediatric patient over a BW of 
40 kg for both PK target attainment and practical dosing administration (maximum dose delivery of the 
PFS kit of 240 mg). However, the CHMP considered that the MAH had not adequately presented the 
exposure in the youngest/lowest weight patients as the boxplots were only down to 30 kg. To this end 
boxplot and corresponding tables for paediatrics under 30 kg, in 5 kg intervals for both Cavg and Cmin 
were requested. 
To address the two requests above, the MAH provided the detailed PK data on the attainment of target 
trough levels of 700 ng/mL and 1000 ng/mL among participants from Study P097 who were 
administered a 6 mg/kg PFS dose, e.g. the observed PK data in patients, and also provided those 
following the simulation exercise following the 6 mg/kg and 7.5 mg /kg PFS dose. 
Values associated with the simulation exercise were presented in Figure 9.

The CHMP noted that the EUCAST targets based on Ctrough cannot be attained at a 6, (7.5) or 8 
mg/kg dose as shown in Figure 9. The MAH attributed such “failure” to the higher clearance in younger 
subjects. Therefore, by considering the fact that the developed PPK fits for purpose, it is expected that 
the same conclusion can be drawn with the observed PK data in patients (aged 2-7years who were 
administered a 6 mg/kg PFS dose). 
Therefore, instead of targets based on Ctrough, the MAH proposed to use targets based on Cavg, 
which was acceptable to the CHMP. It is important to note that the EUCAST targets were not used at 
the time of the PIP submission/modification. In addition, it should be noted that the last 
recommendation (EUCAST website, Clinical Breakpoints for fungi v10.0 [4 Feb 2020]) rely on a 
Ctrough target of 1250 ng/mL for curative treatment whereas a 1000 ng/mL target was set in the 
Clinical Breakpoints for fungi v9.0 [12 Feb 2018]. One also can argue that the Ctrough reported in the 
EUCAST are not truly a Ctrough (sampled just before the next drug intake) but rather a mean of POS 
concentration sampled 10 to 24h after drug intake at steady state and at several occasions (given the 
known prolonged half-life, and consequently the flat typical PK profile of POS).  
In order to attain the EUCAST targets (700 ng/mL for prophylaxis or > 1000 ng/mL for curative 
treatment) based here on Cavg in the paediatric subjects aged 2-7 years, the MAH is now proposing 
for PFS POS a dosing nomogram, where for subjects weighing 10 to 30 kg or 31 to 40 kg, a dose of 8 
mg/kg (a 33% increase in dose) or 6 mg/kg, respectively, is planned to be administered. 
For illustration, by visual inspection for virtual subjects weighing 10 to 15kg, with a 8 mg/kg dose, it is 
predicted that 50% and less than 25% of the subjects will reach a Ctrough of 700 and 1000 ng/mL 
respectively. However by considering a Cavg of 700 ng/mL or 1000 ng/mL, approximately more than 
75% of the subjects, whatever the weight group, fulfil both targets. More precisely, more than 92% of 
the subjects weighing 10 to 30 kg are predicted to have a Cavg over 700 ng/mL with a PFS dose of 8 
mg/kg.  
The proposed 8 mg/kg PFS dose in subjects age 2-7 years and weighing 10 to 30 kg is supported by: 
- Predicted Percent of subject with a Cavg < 500 ng/mL similar to that of patients weighing > 30 kg 
and receiving a 6 mg/kg dose of PFS, all paediatric subjects (2-18 y) receiving a 6 mg/kg dose of the 
IV formulation, and similar Cavg to that reported in adults following the recommended dose of 300 
mg/day (BID Day 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 54/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Adequate safety data, with the proposed 8 mg/kg dose, a mean Cavg of 1408 ng/mL is predicted in 
subjects aged 2-7years and weighing 10-30kg. This predicted Cavg level is covered by the available PK 
data from paediatric subjects (7-18 y or >30 kg) receiving PFS or IV and by those from the adults 
receiving tablet or IV POS where comparable or higher exposure were observed. 
- The proposed dosing nomogram clearly show that except for subjects weighing 10 to 13 kg where 
there is approximately a 14% chance of reaching a Cavg less than 700 ng/mL, the proposed 8 mg/kg 
dose (10 to 30 kg) and 6 mg/kg dose (30 to 40 kg) provide adequate Cavg (less than 14% or 3% of 
Cavg > 2500 and > 3750 ng/mL, respectively). 
- More importantly, there is an overlap between predicted distributions of median (10th-90th percentile) 
Cavg in subjects weighing 10 -30 kg who were administered PFS at 8 mg /kg (1408 [775-2587] 
ng/mL, IV at 8 mg/kg (1917 [1198-3116) ng/mL) or weighing 30 to 40 kg who were administered PFS 
at 6 mg /kg (1341 [718-2401] ng/mL) or IV at 6 mg/kg (1814 [1120-2920] ng/mL) with predicted 
Cavg in adults who were administered tablets or the IV formulation for prophylaxis 1550 [874-2690] 
ng/mL and 1890 [1100-3150] ng/mL, respectively. However for treatment of IFI, exposures in the 
paediatric subjects are generally lower to those from adults.  
The CHMP considered the answers from the MAH to be satisfactory. 
2.6.2.5.  Pharmacodynamics 
N/A 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In  support  of  this  extension  of  indications  of  posaconazole  (POS)  in  children  and  adolescent  patients 
from 2 to < 18 years, an additional  paediatric formulation (PFS) has been developed to the currently 
approved ones (solution for infusion and tablet) and tested in a clinical study (P097). Provided PK targets, 
a PK bridging strategy was performed to support the extrapolation of the indications from adults, using 
a PPK model. 
First a dedicated clinical study (P106) was performed to determine the relative bioavailability of the new 
paediatric formulation (PFS), relative to the tablet formulation (marketed) in healthy adult. In addition, 
the effect of food on POS PK administered as PFS was also investigated.  
PK results indicate that the extent of exposure (AUC0-72) was 19% higher with the PFS compared to 
the tablet formulation with GMR of  1.19 (90% CI  1.10-1.28).  Results remain similar for Cmax with a 
GMR of 1.17 (90% CI 1.04-1.33) for PFS compared to tablet. Both 90% CI fell outside the 0.8-1.25 BE 
limits.  
Under fed conditions for PFS, only Cmax was moderately affected (23 to 41% decrease) whereas AUC0-
72 remain similar. Therefore, the MAH recommendation that PFS can be administered with or without 
food is acceptable. 
A  PPK  analysis  was  performed  with  only  PK  data  from  Study  P097  (pooled  IV  and  PFS  PK  data).  A 
discrepancy between the claimed total PK observations and those used for the PPK analysis, however 
the issue is not pursued. Overall, the PPK model fit for purpose and is considered adequate to use for 
simulation. 
Two  simulation  exercises  were  performed,  one  to  handle  the  optimal  dose  to  be  administered  in  the 
paediatric  population  given  the  PK  bridging  target  (>90%  of  subjects  with  Cavg  between  500-2500 
ng/mL),  and  the  other  one  to  investigate  the  predicted  PK  of  POS  using  the  tablet  formulation,  a

formulation to note which have never been tested in the target population. For this last simulation the 
MAH set a relative bioavailability F of 1.2 (PFS/tablet =1.2) based on the results from study P106. This 
assumption is reasonable and is supported. 
Result of the first simulation exercise show that the use of a 6 mg/kg dose fulfill the PK target of >90% 
of Cavg between 500 and 2500 ng/mL.  
Nevertheless, it should be noted that in the 2-<7 years aged group, a low but non negligible risk of 6.8% 
of virtual paediatric patients are predicted to have a Cavg below 500 ng/mL with the proposed 6 mg/kg 
dose  with  the  PFS  formulation.  Whereas  with  7.5  mg/kg  dose  which  have  never  been  tested  in  the 
paediatric population it is predicted a risk of 2.9% with Cavg below 500 ng/mL associated to an inflated 
risk of over-exposure for both formulation (> 2500 ng/mL). 
However, based on a Cmin target which can be considered as a more conservative PK parameter, which 
is currently used in clinical practice using TDM, there is a high risk of 30% and 20% of under-exposure 
with the 6 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg dose respectively. And this remain a major concern bearing in mind 
the EUCAST recommendation to target a Cmin of 700 ng/mL for prophylaxis and 1000 ng/mL for the 
treatment of IFD. To this end it was requested: 
a) to provide detailed PK data on the attainment of these targets among participants from study P097 
and  following  the  PK  simulation  exercise  for  both  the  6  mg/kg  and  7.5  mg/kg  dose.  Such  PK  data 
(observed PK data) were not provided, only results from the simulation exercise were presented. These 
results clearly show that the EUCAST targets based on Cmin cannot be reached with a 6 mg/kg or a 8 
mg/kg  dose.  Therefore  the  MAH  proposed  to  consider  EUCAST  levels  based  on  Cavg,  this  could  be 
acceptable.  
b) to provide an in-depth  discussion on the possibility  of  increasing the  dose  per kg  in  the  paediatric 
subject aged 2 to < 7years. Such discussion was provided and the MAH proposed to increase the PFS up 
to approximately 8 mg/kg in subjects weighing 10 to 30 kg, while maintaining a 6 mg/kg PFS or IV dose 
in subjects weighing 30 to 40 kg. To this end for PFS, a dosing nomogram was proposed by the MAH 
(see below) for subjects weighing from 10 to 40 kg. 
Results of the associated simulations show an overlap between the predicted Cavg in paediatric 
subjects with those of the predicted exposures in adult subjects who were administered tablets in a 
prophylaxis context. For a curative treatment, the exposure predicted in the paediatric subjects are 
lowered compared to those from adults but remain generally over a Cavg of 1200 ng/mL. 
Result of the second simulation exercise support the use of a 300 mg dose with the tablet formulation 
for paediatric patient over a BW of 40 kg for both PK target attainment. However it should be noted 
that no clinical data in paediatric patients who were administered the tablet formulation are available. 
Of note, a Phase 2 study (P104) is ongoing to evaluate posaconazole (IV, tablet and PFS) in children 2

years to 17 years of age, as agreed within PIP EMEA-000468-PIP02-12-M06. The MAH is expected to 
submit PK and clinical data from this study once it is concluded and the report is available. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PPK analysis provides an adequate description of posaconazole PK in the paediatric 
population. The dosing regimen with both the IV/PFS formulation or tablet formulation (for subject >40 
kg) is agreed in the 2-17 years age group. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This paediatric extension of indication is based on a bridging strategy. Clinical studies were performed 
to assess the PK data in the new paediatric population, in order to reach effective and safe 
posaconazole exposures. 
Overall, two clinical studies were performed: study P032 and study P097. First, study P032 was 
conducted to assess 3 dose levels of the current posaconazole oral suspension (OS) formulation in 
immunocompromised paediatric subjects aged 3 months through <18 years. However, the PK 
exposure target was not met with any dose of the OS formulation and the study was terminated early. 
Thus, a new oral formulation (powder for oral suspension, PFS) was developed for paediatric patients 
and 3 dose levels were assessed in the study P097, which is considered as the main clinical study for 
this paediatric extension of indication.  
The objective of P097 study was to evaluate PK in children to show that IV formulation (POS IV) and 
the new oral formulation (POS PFS) can reach effective and safe concentrations. P097 is not an efficacy 
study and there is no efficacy endpoint. This study has included immunocompromised paediatric 
subjects with high risk of Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs). As posaconazole was given for prophylaxis 
of IFI in this study, the occurrence of AEs consistent with IFI and Day 100 survival were collected, as a 
surrogate marker of efficacy.

- Study P097 
Methods 
This is a Phase 1b, non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, sequential dose-escalation study, with 3 
doses cohorts (3.5, 4.5 and 6 mg/kg/day):

•  Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria: 
Subjects were male or female immunocompromised children between the ages of 2 years to 17 years 
(inclusive) with documented or anticipated neutropenia (ANC<500/mm3 [0.5 x 109/L]) expected to 
last for at least 7 days following start of study treatment in at least one of the following clinical 
situations: acute leukemia, myelodysplasia, severe aplastic anemia, recipients of Autologous HSCT, 
high risk neuroblastoma, advanced stage non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), recipients of allogeneic 
HSCT during the pre-engraftment (neutropenic) period, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. 
Subjects must have a central line (e.g. central venous catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter, 
etc.) in place or planned to be in place prior to beginning IV study therapy. 
Exclusion criteria: 
The main exclusion criteria were: a proven or probable IFI; a posaconazole treatment within the past 
10 days prior to screening; a moderate or severe liver dysfunction; a creatinine clearance < 30 
ml/min; a QTc prolongation (symptomatic QTc prolongation >450 msec for males or >470 msec for 
females, OR any QTc prolongation of >500 msec); pregnancy/breastfeeding; a history of anaphylaxis 
attributed to the azole class of antifungal agents. 
•  Treatments 
Two posaconazole formulations were administered, within 3 dose cohorts. Treatment allocation will be 
stratified according to the following factors: Age Group 1 (Young Children: 2 years to < 7 years of age) 
and Age Group 2 (Older Children/Adolescents: 7 years to 17 years of age). 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021

All doses of POS IV solution will be based on the subject’s age and the actual body weight as measured 
on Day 1, and will remain the same for all subsequent IV doses (through Day 10, or beyond Day 10, 
for subjects unable or unwilling to transition to POS PFS). Similarly, all doses of POS PFS will be based 
on the subject’s age and the actual body weight as measured on the first day of oral treatment, and 
will remain the same for all subsequent oral doses. There is no dose escalation for individual subjects. 
Patients receiving other systemic (PO or IV) antifungal agents as prophylactic therapy must 
discontinue those treatments prior to study drug administration. No other systemic anti-fungal agents 
may be administered during the POS treatment phase without Sponsor approval. 
•  Objectives 
Primary objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of POS IV solution and POS PFS 
administered to immunocompromised paediatric subjects (ages 2 years to 17 years) with neutropenia 
or expected neutropenia. 
Secondary and exploratory objectives: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of POS IV solution and 
POS PFS administered to immunocompromised paediatric subjects (ages 2 years to 17 years) with 
neutropenia or expected neutropenia; to evaluate the palatability and acceptability of POS PFS; to 
evaluate the PK of sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBEβCD). 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint is Cavg for both the POS IV solution and POS OGS. The Cavg is calculated by 
dividing the AUC with dosing interval. Additionally, Cmin, Cmax, Tmax, and AUC are also calculated for 
patients in each age group per dose cohort. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 61/91 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety is assessed based on adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory test 
results, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results. All subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment are included in the safety analysis. 
Palatability and acceptability parameters for the new POS OGS formulation are assessed in all subjects. 
In addition, the PK of sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBEβCD) is also assessed as an exploratory 
objective while on POS IV solution. 
There is no efficacy endpoint. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This was a non-randomized open-label study. 
•  Statistical methods 
A total of 70 subjects will be screened to obtain a minimum of 48 PK-evaluable subjects in the PK 
analysis. Only subjects who receive at least 7 days of POS IV solution therapy and complete the full 
POS PK sampling while on POS IV solution will be included in the non-compartmental PK analysis for 
the primary patient population. 
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analysis.  
There are no efficacy analyses planned for this study. 
The CHMP considered that the design of this study was endorsed within the posaconazole PIP, and is 
consistent with those of PK bridge studies.  
However, considering this design, the small number of patients and the prophylaxis indication of 
posaconazole in this study, a significant efficacy objective and endpoint cannot be defined. 
Nevertheless, as a surrogate marker of efficacy, the occurrence of IFI and survival status at Day 100 
are analysed. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 126 subjects were screened of which 118 were enrolled in the study. Eight subjects were 
screened and did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria. 
Of the 118 subjects enrolled, 115 subjects were dosed, 2 subjects were deemed as screen failures 
after enrolment, and one subject’s parent/guardian withdrew consent. 
Of the 118 enrolled subjects, 109 (92.4%) completed the study. The number/proportion of subjects 
who withdrew from the study were generally similar across dose cohorts in both age groups. 
Of the 115 subjects dosed with POS IV, 89 (77.4%) completed treatment. Of the 63 subjects who 
transitioned to POS PFS, 52 (82.5%) completed treatment.

The CHMP noted that the level of screen failure (6%) and study discontinuation (7.6%) are low for 
such paediatric population. However, the rates of treatment discontinuations are significant: 22.6% of 
subjects have discontinued from POS IV treatment, and 17.5% of subjects who have start the POS PFS 
formulation have discontinued. These treatments discontinuations were mainly due to adverse events 
and physician decision. Furthermore, the rate of treatment discontinuation for POS PFS in the younger 
subjects (Age Group 1) was higher in the 6 mg/kg cohort (7/14, 50%) than in the other age/dose 
cohorts (0% to 16.7%). Nevertheless, the number of subjects was too low to draw any conclusion from 
these discontinuation figures. 
•  Conduct of the study 
A total of 29 sites were open for enrolment, of which 24 centers in 11 countries enrolled at least one 
subject. 
Important deviations (i.e. those that may significantly impact the quality or integrity of key trial data 
or that may significantly affect a subject’s rights, safety, or well-being) were reported for 45 subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 63/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(39.1%). Overall, 12 subjects had important protocol deviations related to study intervention, 10 of 
which affected POS IV dosing and 2 of which affected POS PFS dosing. Subjects with deviations 
affecting study intervention were only excluded from PK analyses if based on the timing and nature of 
the deviation the subject did not satisfy prespecified Patient Acceptability Criteria. Subjects whose data 
were excluded from analyses. No important protocol deviations were classified as GCP compliance 
issues. 
Compliance with the study intervention regimen was high across the intervention groups, with the 
majority of subjects being >90% compliant (112 subjects [97.4%]) for POS IV treatment and >90% 
compliant (62 subjects [98.4%]) for POS PFS treatment.

•  Baseline data

The majority of subjects were white (83.5%) and male (58.3%). The most common underlying 
conditions that qualified subjects for enrolment were acute leukemia (44.3%), HSCT (44.3%), and 
high-risk neuroblastoma (13.9%). Younger subjects were more likely to have a medical diagnosis of 
neuroblastoma or aplastic anemia, and less likely to have a medical diagnosis of leukemia. 
The CHMP noted that large weights (from 10 to 101 kg, with a median at 28.6 kg) and ages (from 2 to 
17 years old, including 49 subjects <7 years old) categories were included, supporting the reliability of 
the PK assessment for such population. 
Nevertheless, baseline race and ethnicity are not well diversified, with notably a low proportion of 
African subjects (2.6%). Of note, based on Noxafil SmPC, there was a slight decrease (16 %) in the 
AUC and Cmax of posaconazole oral suspension in Black subjects relative to Caucasian subjects, but 
with similar safety profile. However, the population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that ethnicity 
have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole. 
•  Numbers analysed 
The PK analysis population included a total of 100 subjects for the IV treatment and 50 subjects for the 
PFS treatment for the primary endpoint. Of the 115 subjects started on IV treatment, 15 (13%) did not 
meet Patient Acceptability Criteria and were not included in PK analysis. Reasons for exclusion included 
the following: samples were not collected, or PK concentrations not obtained 9/15 (60%), dose was 
not given within 6 hours of the scheduled time 5/15 (33.3%), and outlier exclusion 1/15 (6.7%). 
Sixty-three subjects successfully transitioned to the PFS treatment and received at least one dose. Of 
these, 13 (20.6%) did not meet Patient Acceptability Criteria and were not included in PK analysis. 
Reasons for exclusion included the following: PK concentrations or samples were not collected 10/13 
(76.9%), and incomplete dose taken 3/13 (23.1%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 66/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety analyses were based on all 115 enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of study 
intervention. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
P097 was not designed as an efficacy study; however, efficacy data, ie, the occurrence of AEs 
consistent with IFI and Day 100 survival, were collected for the 115 subjects who were enrolled and 
received study therapy. 
Occurrence of IFI 
Two of 115 posaconazole-treated paediatric subjects (1.7%) experienced AEs consistent with IFI. Both 
subjects were in the 4.5 mg/kg/day dose cohort: 
- One subject experienced an AE of systemic mycosis, with onset on Day 11 as fever of unknown origin 
with computed tomography scan showing evidence of splenic and lung lesions possibly consistent with 
a fungal etiology. POS IV had been discontinued on Day 7 due to an AE of pyrexia with the investigator 
decision to start therapy with amphotericin B. 
- One subject had an AE of fungal infection with onset on Day 7 as fever and skin nodules. POS IV was 
discontinued, and the subject was started on amphotericin B.  
Both of these subjects had IV POS Cavg concentrations within the target therapeutic range (subject 1, 
1190 ng/ml; and subject 2, 1180 ng/mL), which were comparable to the mean Cavg for this dose/age 
group (mean Cavg 1240 ng/mL). Both AEs were considered resolved by the end of study follow up. 
No AEs consistent with IFI were reported in the 3.5 mg/kg/day or 6 mg/kg/day dose cohorts. 
The CHMP acknowledged that, as stated by the MAH, the rate of AEs consistent with IFI is comparable 
to those observed in prior prophylaxis studies with the tablet or OS formulation:  
- In a study of neutropenic adult patients receiving the posaconazole tablet (P05615), 1 of 210 
subjects (<1%) treated with the 300 mg daily dose was diagnosed with an IFI.  
- In one of the pivotal Phase 3 studies of the OS formulation (C/I98-316) in adult allogeneic HSCT 
recipients with acute or chronic GVHD, 5% of subjects (16/301) in the posaconazole group experienced 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 67/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an IFI at exposures equivalent to those expected in paediatric patients at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day with 
IV or PFS.  
- In the second pivotal study of the posaconazole OS formulation (P01899), in adults with prolonged 
neutropenia after cytotoxic chemotherapy for the induction of remission in primary or relapsed acute 
myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, 7/304 subjects (2%) experienced an IFI at 
exposures equivalent to those expected in paediatric patients at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day with IV or PFS. 
Furthermore, the two cases of IFI occurring in study P097 were not associated to suboptimal 
posaconazole exposure. 
Day 100 survival status 
The CHMP noted that, according to the MAH, the survival data for posaconazole IV and PFS 
formulations were comparable to the corresponding data previously reported from clinical trials of the 
posaconazole tablet and OS formulations for antifungal prophylaxis in adults (P05615: Day 65 survival 
rate at 91%; P01899: Day 65 survival rate at 87%; C/I98-316: Day 65 survival rate at 86%). 
•  Ancillary analyses 
No relevant subgroup analyses were performed. 
Palatability and acceptability parameters for the POS PFS formulation were assessed by questionnaire 
on Day 1 and Day 3-5 of POS PFS therapy and at the EOT visit. 
The majority of palatability assessment questionnaires were completed by a nurse or primary caregiver 
for Age Group 1 and by the subject for Age Group 2. Taste was assessed as “average,” “good,” or 
“very good” by the majority of assessors for both age groups and all doses at all time points. The 
majority of subjects in both age groups and all doses at all time points did not report any problems 
taking the PFS dose. Problems reported by a minority of subjects included refusing or spitting out the 
dose, vomiting or spitting up, and gagging. The majority of subjects administered the POS PFS 
formulation found the oral formulation to be palatable and acceptable.

•  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)  
The MAH performed a literature research on the post-marketing use of posaconazole OS, tablet, and IV 
formulations in paediatric patients since 2005. 
More than 100 studies and case reports have been published in the medical literature. Most of these 
publications describe the safe and effective use of posaconazole (OS, tablet and OV formulation) for 
the prevention and treatment of IFI in paediatric patients. Several of these reports have included 
plasma posaconazole levels, as well as preliminary efficacy data, and are described below: 
- Doring et al. (2017) reported on the efficacy and safety of posaconazole tablet or OS given as 
antifungal prophylaxis to children following HSCT at a single center, with posaconazole plasma levels 
measured. The study used a weight-based dosing regimen to provide posaconazole 100-mg tablets 
divided into 50-mg increments (from 100 to 300 mg). Thirty-two subjects (median age 14 years, 
range 3-17 years) received posaconazole tablet at dosages ranging from 5 to 7 mg/kg/day (BID on 
Day 1). After 14 days of therapy, 31 of 32 (96.8%) subjects had trough concentrations ≥500 ng/mL. 
The median treatment period was 91 days. During a median observation period of 106 days, there 
were no reports of proven, probable or possible IFI or deaths; furthermore, galactomannan values 
were normal among all subjects. 
- A recent retrospective study by Mauro et al (2020) of posaconazole tablet enrolled 28 
hematology/oncology patients at 6 sites in Italy (median age 15 years, range 5-18 years) who had 
undergone chemotherapy or HSCT and received posaconazole as either prophylaxis (21 patients) or 
treatment (7 patients) of IFI. Patients with a body weight of <50 kg received posaconazole tablet at 4 
to 6 mg/kg/day as a starting dose, with adjustments made on the basis of measured plasma 
concentration. Among the 13 patients who received posaconazole tablet as prophylaxis, with a median 
dosage of 5 to 6 mg/kg/day, median plasma concentrations at 7, 14, and 28 days after beginning 
treatment were 1300 to 1400 ng/mL, with a broad concentration range, primarily at the latter time 
points. None of these patients had evidence of IFI during prophylaxis. Among the 7 patients who 
received posaconazole tablet as therapy (2 patients) or salvage therapy (5 patients), starting a median 
of 21 days (range 7-204 days) after symptoms began, with a median dosage of 4 mg/kg/day, median 
plasma concentrations at 7, 14, and 28 days were 900 to 2700 ng/mL. Response outcomes were 
available for 6 of these patients: 4 had a complete or partial response, 1 had a stable response, and 1 
had worsened status. 
- Another recent retrospective study of posaconazole tablet among paediatric patients by Tragiannidis 
et al (2019), at a single paediatric oncology hospital in Germany, enrolled 34 patients (median age 12 
years, range 5-17 years) who were prescribed posaconazole tablet as primary or secondary 
prophylaxis; of these, 11 patients had had allogeneic HSCT, and 1 patient had polyarthritis, all of 
whom were receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Weight-dependent dosages were 300 mg QD (BID 
on Day 1) in 25 patients with body weight >30 kg, and alternating doses of 200 and 300 mg QD (300 
mg on Day 1) in 9 patients with body weight >20-30 kg. Dosages were subsequently increased or 
decreased in a total of 5 patients in both groups in order to maintain a trough concentration of ≥1000 
ng/mL and ≤5000 ng/mL. Approximately 90% of both children (aged 5 through 12 years) and 
adolescents (aged 13 through 17 years) had posaconazole trough concentrations ≥700 ng/mL. Over a 
median duration of 70 days of prophylaxis treatment (range 9-391 days), no IFI was observed among 
the 34 patients. 
- A recent publication by Nickless et al (2018) reported on the use of posaconazole IV at a single 
paediatric hospital between 2015 and 2017. Eligible children for this review weighed <40 kg, received 
≥5 doses of posaconazole IV and had ≥1 posaconazole level measured. Children were prescribed 
posaconazole IV if they could not tolerate posaconazole OS or were not able to take any oral therapy. 
The review identified 10 subjects from 1.5 through 11 years of age who received posaconazole IV for 
Assessment report

either treatment or prevention of an IFI. In this study, therapeutic drug monitoring of posaconazole 
levels was performed and the once-daily dose of posaconazole IV adjusted to maintain a minimum 
desired target. It was found that, in this patient population, posaconazole IV at doses of 5.3 to 13.5 
mg/kg/day (with a median minimum effective dose of 6.55 mg/kg/day) was generally successful in 
achieving a trough concentration of >700 ng/mL. 
The posaconazole exposures achieved in these studies have been associated with efficacy in adult 
studies of the OS formulation. Collectively, the results described above support the efficacy of 
posaconazole in children and adolescents (2 to <18 years of age). 
Currently, only voriconazole is indicated for the prophylaxis of IFI in children. Considering its side 
effects and drug-drug interaction profile, there is an off-label use of posaconazole in 
immunocompromised children. This literature research highlights the need to extend the indication of 
posaconazole for prophylaxis and treatment of IFI in paediatric subjects. The CHMP considered that 
these data support the efficacy of posaconazole for the treatment or prophylaxis of IFI. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Prior to this extension of indication, Posaconazole was indicated in the treatment and prophylaxis of 
the following IFI in adults: Invasive aspergillosis (in patients with disease that is refractory to 
amphotericin B or itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products); fusariosis 
(in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are intolerant of 
amphotericin B); chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma (in patients with disease that is refractory to 
itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole); coccidioidomycosis (in patients with 
disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or in patients who are 
intolerant of these medicinal products); oropharyngeal candidiasis (as first-line therapy in patients who 
have severe disease or are immunocompromised, in whom response to topical therapy is expected to 
be poor). 
The available antifungals approved in paediatric subjects at the time of this Assessment Report are: 
amphotericin B, caspofungin, micafungin, flucytosine, fluconazole and voriconazole. Only mycafungin 
(for candidemia), fluconazole (for candidemia and cryptococcosis) and voriconazole (for candidemia, 
aspergillosis and fusariosis) have a prophylaxis indication in immunocompromised children. The choice 
of antifungal prophylaxis for paediatric patients is limited by side effects profiles, drug-drug 
interactions, PK characteristics, antifungal spectrum and also availability of oral formulation for young 
children. Therefore, there is a medical need to extend the indication of posaconazole to paediatric 
subjects. 
This paediatric extension of posaconazole was discussed and approved within its PIP. Given no dose 
could be defined with the available oral solution (based on PK results of study P032), a new oral 
formulation (powder for oral solution) was developed and paediatric doses were defined within the 
study P097. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This paediatric extension of indication is based on the PK bridge study P097 performed in 
immunocompromised children. This PK approach to define a paediatric posology and the design of this 
sequential dose-escalation study, assessing 3 doses of posaconazole (3.5, 4.5 and 6 mg/kg/day), were 
approved by the EMA Paediatric Committee.   
This study was not design for efficacy assessment (all the more that posaconazole was administered in 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 70/91 
 
 
 
 
 
a prophylaxis indication, for which an efficacy assessment requires a large population), and a 
significant efficacy objective and endpoint cannot be defined. Nevertheless, as a surrogate marker of 
efficacy, the occurrence of IFI and survival status at Day 100 were analysed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, 115 subjects were included in the study, with large weights range (from 10 to 101 kg, with a 
median at 28.6 kg) and ages range (from 2 to 17 years old, including 49 subjects <7 years old), 
supporting the reliability of the PK assessment for such population. The majority of subjects were male 
(58.3% of male subjects) with immunocompromised status associated with acute leukemia (44.3%), 
HSCT (44.3%), or high-risk neuroblastoma (13.9%). The included population may be considered 
representative, although baseline race and ethnicity are not well diversified, with notably a low 
proportion of African subjects (2.6%). Of note, based on Noxafil SmPC, there was a slight decrease 
(16 %) in the AUC and Cmax of posaconazole oral suspension in Black subjects relative to Caucasian 
subjects, but with similar safety profile. However, the population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests 
that ethnicity have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole. 
The occurrence of IFI (2/115 subjects, 1.7%) is comparable to those observed in prior prophylaxis 
studies with the tablet or OS formulation in adults (1-2%). Similarly, the survival status (at Day 100: 
111/115 subjects, 96.5%) is comparable to those previously reported in clinical trials with the tablet 
and OS formulations for antifungal prophylaxis in adults (at Day 65: 86-91%). Furthermore, based on 
literature data, the efficacy of posaconazole in paediatric population was assessed and supported 
within several clinical studies. 
Importantly a paediatric formulation, the taste of the new oral formulation (powder for solution) seems 
to be well accepted by this paediatric population, with a high compliance within this study (98.4% for 
PFS treatment). 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
No new efficacy conclusion can be drawn with this paediatric PK bridge study. However, no efficacy 
concerns were highlighted among the 115 paediatric subjects (including 49 subjects treated with the 
recommended dose at 6 mg/kg), which is reassuring as regards the predicted and non-negligible 
percentage of paediatric subjects from 2 to <7 years old (6.8%) to have a Cavg below the target of 
500 ng/mL (see PK discussion).  
Considering that Noxafil (and posaconazole generics) are currently available as oral suspension, it is 
considered important to differentiate them from the new PFS formulation of Noxafil. Indeed, no 
paediatric dose could be defined with posaconazole oral solution throughout the study P032, as the PK 
exposure target was not met with any dose of this OS formulation. The co-marketing of two oral 
solutions may be confusing and potentially lead to dosing error. As Noxafil PFS was not developed for 
adults, it is important to well characterise the current Noxafil oral solution for adults only, and the new 
Noxafil PFS for paediatric subjects only. This is addressed via a one-time DHPC to inform on the 
availability and indication of the two formulations. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The  posaconazole  (POS;  Noxafil®;  MK-5592)  paediatric  clinical  development  program  is  ongoing  to 
evaluate the use of posaconazole in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older. The proposed indications 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 71/91 
 
 
 
 
 
are supported by a PK and safety bridging strategy to currently approved indications in adults, which 
may differ by country/region.  
The IV formulation of posaconazole (concentrate for solution for infusion) investigated in P097 is identical 
to that commercially available and approved for use in adults. A novel powder for oral suspension (PFS), 
also  referred  to  as  a  powder  for  delayed-release  oral  suspension  or  gastro-resistant  powder  for  oral 
suspension, referred to hereafter as PFS, has been developed to offer the improved bioavailability of the 
posaconazole delayed-release tablet in a formulation that is amenable for oral administration in younger 
children and for weight-based dosing. 
In addition to P097, the PK and safety of posaconazole in paediatric patients have also been studied in 
P032 (P03579), the first clinical study designed to identify a paediatric dose for posaconazole using the 
oral  suspension  (OS)  formulation  approved  for  use  in  adults.  P032  was  a  Phase  1b,  nonrandomized, 
multicenter,  open-label,  sequential  dose-escalation  study  of  the  PK,  safety,  and  tolerability  of 
posaconazole  OS  when  used  as  prophylaxis  in  immunocompromised  paediatric  subjects  (3  months  to 
<18 years of age) who were at high risk for invasive fungal infections (IFIs). The study was terminated 
early based on analysis of PK data demonstrating that the PK exposure target for the study was not met 
with any of the doses studied.  
Posaconazole OS was generally well tolerated in paediatric subjects age 2 to <18 years at all 
administered doses (12 mg/kg/day divided BID, 18 mg/kg/day divided BID and 18 mg/kg/day divided 
TID) in the P032 study. There was no apparent pattern to suggest a difference in the safety profiles 
among the three dosing schedules evaluated, nor between the younger (2 to <7 year old) and older 
age (7 to <18 years of age) groups. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Of  the  115 subjects  (P097)  treated  with  posaconazole  IV,  89  (77.4%)  completed  treatment.  Of  the 
63 subjects who transitioned to posaconazole PFS, 52 (82.5%) completed treatment. 
The  mean  overall  treatment  duration  (posaconazole  IV  and  posaconazole  PFS)  of  all  treated  subjects 
was  20.6 days  with  a  range  of  1  to  28 days.  The  mean  duration  of  posaconazole  IV  treatment  was 
14.3 days (range, 1 to 28 days), and the mean duration of posaconazole PFS treatment was 11.6 days 
(range, 2 to 18 days). 
Although there were differences in baseline characteristics between some groups, no clinically meaningful 
differences were observed between the groups. 
The  most  common  underlying  conditions  that  qualified  subjects  for  enrolment  were  acute  leukemia, 
HSCT, and high-risk neuroblastoma. Younger subjects were more likely to have a medical diagnosis of 
neuroblastoma or aplastic anemia, and less likely to have a medical diagnosis of leukemia. 
Across the two studies, 250 paediatric subjects aged 2 to < 18 years of age and 1 subject under 1 year 
of age were exposed to posaconazole for up to 28 days.  
The CHMP noted that, across the two studies (P032 and P097), 250 paediatric subjects aged 2 to < 
18 years of age and 1 subject under 1 year of age were exposed to posaconazole. 
In P097, 115 subjects were treated with posaconazole IV. Among them, 63 subjects transitioned with 
posaconazole PFS.

Overall rates of AEs, including rates of SAEs, deaths, and discontinuations due to AEs, were generally 
comparable  between  the  age  groups  for  both  P097  and  P032.  Therefore,  the  two  age  groups  are 
combined in subsequent data presentations in the remainder of the integrated analysis. Overall, a higher 
proportion of subjects enrolled in P032 reported, drug-related AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study medication than in P097. The rates of all other AE categories were similar between the two studies. 
- P097 
The frequencies of AEs  across all AE categories were generally similar between dose cohorts and age 
group.  Overall  AE  frequencies  were  lower  during  treatment  with  the  PFS  formulation  than  during  the 
initial treatment with the IV formulation. 
There  was  no  pattern  to  AEs  that  would  indicate  a  clear  difference  between  the  dose  cohorts  or  age 
groups. 
Reported  AEs  were  generally  consistent  with  those  expected  in  a  paediatric  oncology  population 
undergoing treatment for malignancy or with the known safety profile of posaconazole. 
There was no pattern to drug-related AEs that would indicate a clear difference among the dose cohorts 
or age groups. Reported drug-related AEs were generally consistent with the known drug-related AEs of 
posaconazole in adults.

The  most  common  AEs  (occurring  in  >20%  of  the  pooled  subjects)  were  pyrexia,  vomiting,  mucosal 
inflammation, febrile neutropenia, nausea, and diarrhea. Observed AEs were generally consistent with 
those expected in a paediatric oncology population undergoing treatment for malignancy, and with the 
established safety profile of posaconazole. 
For the combined pool of subjects, 26.7% reported drug-related AEs. Common drug-related AEs (those 
occurring in ≥5% of subjects in the combined population) were nausea, vomiting, and ALT increased. It 
is noted that there were more drug-related adverse events in study P032 (oral suspension) compared to 
P097 (PFS), and that these differences appeared to be driven by a greater incidence of GI-related AE 
(nausea/vomiting) with the OS formulation. 
The CHMP noted that no news AEs emerged in the paediatric population. Reported AEs were generally 
consistent with those expected in a paediatric oncology population undergoing treatment for malignancy 
or with the known safety profile of posaconazole. Adverse events incidence was high in all groups, which 
was expected in this critically ill population. 
AE frequencies were lower during treatment with the PFS formulation than during the initial treatment 
with the IV formulation. 
It is noted that there were more drug-related adverse events in study P032 (oral suspension) compared 
to P097 (PFS). 
Most  common  reported  AEs  (occurring  in  >20%  of  subjects)  were  pyrexia,  mucosal  inflammation, 
vomiting, diarrhea and febrile neutropenia. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
- Deaths 
Overall rates of deaths due to AEs were low in the combined  population (2.0%) and  in the  individual 
studies (1.7% in P097, 2.2% in P032). No subject in either study died due to a drug-related AE.  
In  P097,  a  total  of  4 subjects  died  after  the  end  of  study  treatment,  but  before  the  final  survival 
assessment  (allowed  range,  Day 90  to  110).  Three  of  the  4 subjects  died  before  the  Day 65  survival 
assessment. Two of these deaths occurred after the end of the AE monitoring period (through 14 days 
after  last  dose  of  study  treatment)  and  were  due  to  the  subjects’  underlying  malignancy.  Another 
2 subjects died due to a fatal AE of respiratory failure and veno-occlusive disease, both of which occurred 
after the end of study treatment. None of the deaths was considered to be related to study treatment 
by the investigator. 
The CHMP noted that 7 deaths were reported (4 in P097 and 3 in P032). None of the deaths was 
considered to be related to study treatment by the investigator. 
- Serious Adverse Events 
The overall incidence and distribution of SAEs were similar between age groups and dose cohorts. A total 
of  31 subjects  (27.0%)  experienced  SAEs:  19 subjects  during  posaconazole  IV  treatment  and 
13 subjects  during  posaconazole  PFS  treatment.  Reported  serious  AEs  were  generally  consistent  with 
those  expected  in  a  paediatric  oncology  population  undergoing  treatment  for  malignancy  or  with  the 
safety profile of posaconazole established in adults. 
Most  SAEs  were  reported  in  <1%  of  the  combined  population  with  the  exceptions  of  anemia  (1.2%), 
pyrexia (1.6%), and febrile neutropenia (6.8%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 75/91 
 
 
 
The CHMP noted that SAEs were reported in 27.0% of subjects. The most common SAE was febrile 
neutropenia (2.6%). Other SAEs occurring in >1% of subjects were veno-occlusive disease, pyrexia 
and vomiting. 4 experienced a drug-related AEs all resolved. These data were already analysed and 
validated as part of procedure EMEA/H/C/000610/P46/029. 
- Treatment-Related Serious Adverse Events 
The overall rate of drug-related SAEs (1.6%) was low in the combined pool and in the individual studies. 
This low rate is similar to overall rates of drug-related SAEs reported in adult studies (3% in P05615 with 
posaconazole  tablet  and  1%  in  P05520  with  posaconazole  IV  formulation.  Drug-related  SAEs  with  an 
incidence ≥ 0% in one or more treatment groups are presented in Table 3. No individual drug-related 
SAE was reported in >1 subject in either treatment group  
Table 24 – Subjects with serious drug-related adverse events (Incidence > 0% in One or 
More Treatment Groups) 
The CHMP noted that the overall rate of drug-related SAEs (1.6%) was low in the combined pool and in 
the  individual  studies.  This  low  rate  is  similar  to  overall  rates  of  drug-related  SAEs  reported  in  adult 
studies (3% in P05615 with posaconazole tablet and 1% in P05520 with posaconazole IV formulation. 
No individual drug-related SAE was reported in >1 subject in either treatment group. 
- Medication errors 
To ensure proper use of the newly introduced PFS formulation, the product labeling and package carton 
will clearly state that Noxafil OS and Noxafil PFS are not to be used interchangeably. Unlike Noxafil OS, 
which is a ready-to-use suspension, Noxafil PFS is provided as a powder that must be mixed with the 
suspending vehicle (also provided in the same product kit) before use. Notch-tip oral dosing syringes, a 
bottle of suspending vehicle, bottle adapter, mixing cups and a step-by-step Instruction for Use (IFU) 
are provided to guide the preparation and administration of weight-based dosing of the PFS. In addition, 
the Noxafil PFS kit and the additional syringe pack will be cross-labeled in the product labeling and the 
package cartons to ensure that the additional notch-tip syringes are supplied together with the PFS kit. 
A new PFS formulation (Powder for oral suspension, also called "Gastro-Resistant Powder and Solvent 
for  Oral  Suspension)  is  introduced.  However,  as  an  oral  suspension  already  exists  (and  is  not 
interchangeable with the PFS), there may be a risk of confusion between these formulations leading to 
potential dosing errors, patients receiving incorrect formulation and/or dose of posaconazole, or either 
lack of efficacy (due to subtherapeutic drug levels) or drug toxicity (due to supratherapeutic drug levels). 
The MAH proposed a DHPC addressing the non-interchangeability between the oral suspension and the 
GR powder and solvent for oral suspension, which was acceptable to the CHMP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 76/91 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the SmPC for the GR powder and solvent for oral suspension and respectively for the OS 
contain a statement of non-interchangeability. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
- Hematology and Chemistry Laboratory Values 
There was no pattern to laboratory toxicity grade changes that would indicate a clear difference between 
the dose cohorts or age groups. 
None of the subjects had liver function laboratory findings that met predetermined criteria for potential 
drug-induced liver injury. 
- Vital signs 
There  were  variable  increases  in  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  from  baseline  across  the  dose 
cohorts that were not considered clinically meaningful. No subjects died or discontinued study treatment 
due to hypertension. 
One subject in Age Group 2 of the 6 mg/kg Dose Cohort experienced an SAE of worsening hypertension 
that resolved  and was reported by  the investigator  as not related to study  treatment.  There were no 
other clinically  meaningful  findings in  vital  sign  measurements,  physical  examination  assessments,  or 
other observations related to safety in this study. 
- Electrocardiograms 
No subject in P097 met the protocol pre-specified criteria for prolonged QT (QTc ≥500 msec). 
- Exposure/Safety Analysis 
Despite a low incidence of drug-related AEs across dose cohorts, an exploratory analysis of drug-related 
AEs  by  steady-state  Cavg  concentrations  for  the  posaconazole  IV  and  posaconazole  PFS  formulations 
was performed. No correlation between drug-related AEs and posaconazole exposures was observed for 
either the posaconazole IV or posaconazole PFS formulations. 
The CHMP noted that, considering the laboratory values, no signal was found. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Safety and Suitability of Posaconazole IV Formulation for Paediatric Patients. 
The IV formulation of posaconazole is generally well tolerated and safe in adult and paediatric patients 
2 years of age and above in clinical trials, as well as in postmarket use (including off-label in paediatric 
patients) since 2015. 
Posaconazole IV formulation is an aqueous injectable solution containing 18 mg/mL of posaconazole to 
be diluted with sodium chloride 0.9% or 5% dextrose in water prior to IV administration. The primary 
excipient  in  posaconazole  IV  solution  is  sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin  (SBEβCD,  marketed  as 
Captisol®),  an  excipient  that  is  found  in  marketed  IV  products  including  voriconazole  IV  (VFEND®). 
SBEβCD has been associated with kidney toxicity in rat models. Also, SBEβCD is mainly excreted through 
the kidney; therefore, accumulation of SBEβCD is expected to occur when used in patients with moderate 
or severe renal impairment. 
The final concentrations of posaconazole and SBEβCD are 18 mg/mL and 400 mg/mL, respectively. By 
comparison,  the  concentrations  of  voriconazole  and  SBEβCD  are  10 mg/mL  and  160 mg/mL, 
respectively. The overall exposure to SBEβCD in paediatric patients treated with posaconazole IV solution 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 77/91 
 
 
 
is no greater than the exposure in those administered IV voriconazole. On a weight-normalized (mg/kg) 
basis, a daily maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg posaconazole IV QD would contain 133 mg/kg/day SBEβCD, 
whereas  the  approved  daily  maintenance  dose  of  8 mg/kg  voriconazole  IV  BID  would  contain 
256 mg/kg/day SBEβCD. The acceptable threshold for cyclodextrins (including SBEβCD) for parenteral 
route  of  administration  greater  than  2 weeks  is  200 mg/kg/day  per  the  Annex  to  the  European 
Commission guideline on ‘Excipients in the labeling and package leaflet of medicinal products for human 
use’  (SANTE-2017-11668),  published  22-NOV-2019.  The  daily  SBEβCD  exposure  associated  with 
administration  of  posaconazole  IV  at  maintenance  dose  of  6 mg/kg  QD  is  below  the  200 mg/kg/day 
threshold  in  the  EMA  guidance.  The  exposure  to  SBEβCD  for  those  who  weigh  >50 kg  is  less  than 
133 mg/kg/day as the maximum daily dose of posaconazole IV is 300 mg, QD. 
In support of a regulatory authority request to contribute data on paediatric cyclodextrin use, for which 
paediatric clinical trial data are lacking, the PK of SBEβCD was assessed as an exploratory objective in 
P097.  After  IV  administration  of  posaconazole  3.5,  4.5,  or  6.0 mg/kg/day  up  to  a  maximum  of 
300 mg/day, the steady state plasma PK parameter values of SBEβCD were highly variable, but exposure 
increased with increasing posaconazole dose and was generally similar in both age groups within each 
dose cohort. No apparent pattern to suggest a dose-related difference in the safety profile was observed 
in P097. The incidence of drug-related AEs by posaconazole dose was 11.4%, 25.8%, and 10.2% for the 
3.5,  4.5,  and  6 mg/kg  cohorts  (equivalent  to  78,  100,  and  133 mg/kg  SBEβCD),  respectively.  There 
were no drug-related events of renal toxicity or increased creatinine, reported in P097. 
The CHMP noted that there were no drug-related events of renal toxicity or increased creatinine reported 
in P097.  
To be noted, in procedure EMEA/H/C/000610/II/0057 for Noxafil, for the important identified risk “renal 
effects of cyclodextrin with IV infusion of posaconazole”, there were no reports of renal failure associated 
with intravenous infusion of posaconazole in the clinical development of posaconazole IV formulation and 
there has been only one post-marketing report of renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement 
therapy after receiving posaconazole IV infusion in the Company’s global safety database. Moreover, a 
routine risk minimization measure via product labelling is already mentioned in the PI.  Consequently, 
the MAH’s proposal to remove this safety concern from the RMP was accepted. 
- Palatability and Acceptability of PFS Formulation in Paediatric Patients 
The palatability and acceptability of the PFS formulation of posaconazole were assessed by 
questionnaire filled out by a nurse or primary caregiver for Age Group 1, and by the subject for Age 
Group 2, on Day 1 and Day 3-5 of PFS therapy and at the End of Treatment visit in P097. Taste was 
assessed as “average,” “good,” or “very good” by the majority of assessors for both age groups and for 
all doses at all time points. The majority of subjects in both age groups and for all doses at all time 
points did not report any problems taking the PFS dose. A minority of subjects experienced transient 
problems including refusing or spitting out the dose, vomiting or spitting up, and gagging. The 
proportion of subjects that experienced any of these problems in the 6 mg/kg dose cohort was 24% 
(6/25), 12% (2/17) and 12% (2/17) at Day 1, Day 3-5, and End of Treatment, respectively. The 
majority of subjects administered the posaconazole PFS formulation found the oral formulation to be 
palatable and acceptable. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
DDIs were not specifically evaluated in P097. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 78/91 
 
 
 
2.6.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall rate of discontinuation due to AE in the combined population was 19.9%, similar to rates 
reported in adult studies (18% in P05615 with posaconazole tablet and 19% in P05520 with 
posaconazole IV formulation). 
The CHMP acknowledged that the overall rate of discontinuation due to AE in the combined population 
was 19.9%, indeed similar to rates reported in adult studies. 
2.6.8.8.  Post marketing experience 
Posaconazole has been registered and approved for use in adults in more than 70 countries since its first 
approval  on  25-OCT-2005.  Currently  there  are  3  marketed  formulations  of  posaconazole:  oral 
suspension, delayed-release tablet, and concentrate for solution for IV infusion. There are no records of 
any  registration  being  revoked  or  withdrawn  for  safety  reasons.  The  benefit-risk  information  on 
posaconazole received by the MAH’s AE reporting and review system has been summarized in the PSUR 
on an annual basis since 2006. 
Cumulative post-marketing exposure for posaconazole was calculated from information provided by IMS 
Health,  the  MAH’s  internal  distribution  data  from  the  Worldwide  Financial  Reporting  System,  and  the 
Financial  Sharing  Area  databases.  Total  cumulative  patient  exposure  for  posaconazole  through 
25-OCT-2019  was  approximately  107,572  patient-years  of  treatment  (46,987  for  the  OS,  59,590  for 
tablets, and 995 for the IV formulation). 
As  of  25-OCT-2019,  there  were  6240  AE  reports  containing  13,091  events  (7725 nonserious,  5366 
serious) from spontaneous and non-interventional post-marketing study reports in the Company’s global 
safety database. 
The SOCs in which AEs were most frequently reported were General disorders and administration site 
conditions  (2630 cases);  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  (2019 cases);  and  Infections 
and infestations (992 cases). 
The most frequently reported PTs in the General disorders and administration site conditions SOC were 
adverse  event  (n=550  cases),  death  (n=497  cases),  no  adverse  event  (n=362 cases),  and  drug 
ineffective (n=348 cases). The other PTs reported in this SOC reflect the critically ill nature of patients 
receiving posaconazole. 
The most frequently reported PTs in the Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC were off-
label use (n=771 cases), product dose omission (n=355 cases), product use in unapproved indication 
(n=312 cases), and product use issue (n=143 cases). 
The most frequently reported PTs in the Infections and infestations SOC were pneumonia (n=140 cases), 
fungal infection (n=110 cases), sepsis (n=68 cases), and septic shock (n=55 cases). These and other 
PTs reported in this SOC reflect the critically ill nature of patients receiving posaconazole. 
A separate analysis of post-marketing reports of posaconazole use in patients under the age of 18 years 
within the MAH’s global safety database (cumulative of 25-OCT-2019), as well as literature reports of 
posaconazole  use  in  paediatric  patients,  revealed  a  similar  safety  profile  as  the  general  population, 
including the frequency of renal events. 
A cumulative analysis of post-marketing AEs, as of 25-OCT-2019, did not identify new safety issues for 
posaconazole. The safety profile revealed by the current analysis is consistent with those presented in 
PSURs submitted to date and those in the product label. The overall benefit-risk balance for posaconazole 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 79/91 
 
 
 
continues to be positive for use in the approved indications. The MAH will continue to monitor the safety 
of posaconazole through established routine pharmacovigilance processes. 
- Ovierview of AE Reports in Paediatric Patients 
There were 465 reports identified (162 non-interventional study reports and 303 spontaneous). The 465 
reports contained 1152 events: 367 (32%) were considered serious and 785 (68%) were nonserious. Of 
the 465 reports, 180 were female patients, 259 were male patients, and 26 were of unidentified gender. 
With regard to age, 29 reports concerned patients <2 years old, 153 concerned patients aged 2 to <7 
years old, and 283 concerned patients 7 years to 17 years old (inclusive) (mean: 8.53, median 8 [range: 
0.003-17] years). 
The 3 most common historical medical conditions were: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (34 stem 
cell,  19  bone  marrow,  and  12  allogeneic  cases),  acute  lymphocytic  leukemia  (15  cases),  and 
chemotherapy  (12  cases).  The  3  most  common  current  conditions  were:  antifungal  prophylaxis  (106 
cases),  acute lymphocytic  leukemia (86 cases),  and fungal  infection (49 cases).  The 3 most common 
comedications were formulations of amphotericin B (95 cases), voriconazole (40 cases), and caspofungin 
(29  cases).  Other  commonly  coadministered  medicines  were  vincristine  (28  cases),  the  calcineurin 
inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus, 18 cases), and methotrexate (14 cases). Four hundred and forty-
six reports involved the oral formulations and 23 reports involved the IV formulation (4 reports involved 
patients who received both oral and IV formulations). 
By number of events, the three most commonly affected SOCs were Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications; General disorders and administration site conditions; and Investigations. 
The  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  SOC  contained  409  (36%)  of  all  events:  9  were 
considered serious and 400 were considered nonserious. By number of events (n, % of all events), the 
three most common PT in this SOC were: off-label use (197 events, 17%), product use issue (77 events, 
7%) and product administered to patient of inappropriate age (45 events, 4%). The majority of these 
events pertained to posaconazole being used outside of the labelled paediatric use. 
The  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  SOC  contained  151  events  (13%):  47  were 
considered  serious  and  104  nonserious.  By  number  of  events  (n,  %  of  all  events),  the  three  most 
common  PTs  in  this  SOC  were  pyrexia  (35  events,  3%),  drug  ineffective  (21  events,  2%)  and  drug 
interaction (20 events, 2%). These AEs are not unexpected as pyrexia is inherent to the diseases being 
treated  in  this  population,  and  the  azole  antifungal  agents  as  a  class  are  not  100%  efficacious  in 
preventing  or  treating  IFI.  The  drug  interaction  events  involved  drugs  known  to  interact  with 
posaconazole (such as vincristine and acid reducing medications). 
The  Investigations  SOC  contained  113  (10%)  of  all  events;  19  were  considered  serious  and  94 
nonserious. By number of events (n, % of all events), the three most common AEs in this  SOC were 
blood  potassium  decreased  (18  events,  2%),  drug  level  below  therapeutic  (9  events,  1%),  and  drug 
level decreased and drug level increased (7 events, 1% for each). 
There  were  27  fatal  cases  (39  events  due  to  multiple  causes).  Among  the  27  fatal  reports,  16  were 
spontaneous and 11 were non-interventional study cases. The most commonly reported adverse events 
(PTs) with fatal outcome were: sepsis (or septic shock, Klebsiella sepsis) and multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome (7 cases), fungal infection (or Aspergillus infection, Candida infection, central nervous system 
fungal  infection,  mucormycosis,  systemic  Candida)  (8  cases),  drug  ineffective  (5  cases)  and  disease 
progression  (2  cases).  No  cause(s)  of  death  were  listed  in  8  reports;  5  of  those  8  children  had 
haematological malignancy, 2 had invasive mycosis, and 1 did not have any concomitant illness or cause 
of death listed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 80/91 
 
 
 
A review of adverse events reported in the paediatric population received from post-marketing use did 
not identify new safety issues. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  analysis  of  the  combined  AE  data  and  exposure-safety  relationship  from  studies  P032  and  P097 
demonstrates that the posaconazole IV and PFS formulations are generally well tolerated in the paediatric 
population aged 2 years and above. The safety profile of posaconazole IV and PFS observed in the two 
studies is consistent with that described in the product label.  
Previous studies with posaconazole in adults found no correlation between posaconazole exposures and 
safety profile across the range of posaconazole exposures observed/reported. Based on the range of the 
concentrations  (Cavg)  achieved  across  the  dose  regimens/formulations  evaluated  in  the  2  paediatric 
trials, exposure-response assessments (such as a quartile analysis of drug-related AEs by steady-state 
Cavg concentrations for posaconazole) provide a scientifically robust method to assess the potential for 
exposure  dependent  trends.  The  lack  of  trends  observed  between  drug-related  AEs  and  the  mean 
posaconazole  Cavg  in  the  pooled  population  of  participants  in  P097  and  P032  is  consistent  with  that 
observed in adults. 
The evaluation of post-marketing experience indicates that, whether used for treatment or prophylaxis, 
posaconazole is generally well tolerated in paediatric patients under 18 years of age. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The analysis of safety data and exposure-safety relationships from prospective clinical studies (P032 
and P097), literature reports of observational studies, and AE reports from post-marketing use 
demonstrate the overall safety profile of posaconazole in the paediatric population is similar to that 
established for posaconazole in adults. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The MAH submitted an RMP version 17.2 (data lock point 25 October 2019, dated 10 May 2021) with 
this application to support the line extension for a new Gastro-Resistant Powder for Oral Suspension 
(PFS) formulation and the proposal to expand the indication for Noxafil to include paediatric patients 
from 2 to <18 years of age. 
2.7.1.  Safety concerns

Discussion on safety specification  
Safety  concerns  were  evaluated  in  the  procedure  EMEA/H/C/000610/II/0062.  According  to  this 
procedure the MAH will modify the safety concerns accordingly.  
Moreover, the following safety concerns were added: 
- Medication error – related to substitution between different formulations (oral suspension and powder 
for oral suspension). 
The missing information experience in children was replaced by safety in children below 2 years of age. 
Conclusions on the safety specification  
Having considered the data in the safety specification, the following issues were addressed: 
• 
 “Medication error – related to substitution between different formulations (oral suspension and 
powder for oral suspension)” was added as a safety concern. 
The following safety concern “Experience in Children” was replaced by “Safety in children below 2 
years of age”. 
2.7.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
Since a newly PFS formulation is introduced with non-interchangeability between the already existing 
Noxafil Gastro-Resistant Powder and Solvent for Oral Suspension and Noxafil Oral Suspension risk 
minimisation measures a one-time DHPC letter was requested to the MAH in order to inform healthcare 
professionals about this newly PFS formulation and the associated risk of medication error. It was 
asked to the MAH that the packaging should also alert HCP to avoid medication error. A DHPC 
communication plan was also requested to the MAH. 
Subsequent to the MAH responses, providing all requested information, the PRAC considered that the 
MAH  updated  the  Part  VI  “Summary  of  activities  in  the  risk  management  plan  by  medicinal  product” 
satisfactorily. 
2.7.3.  Risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC considered that the following additional risk minimisation measures  were necessary for the 
safe and effective use of the product:  
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 82/91 
 
 
 
 
A  one-time  DHPC  addressing  the  potential  risk  of  medication  error  related  to  substitution  between 
different formulations (oral suspension and Gastro-Resistant Powder and Solvent for Oral Suspension) 
as these two formulations are not interchangeable. 
The MAH included the DHPC in Annex 6 of the RMP, along with list of DHPC recipients as listed in the 
DHPC communication plan, as requested. 
2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 17.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Significance of paediatric studies 
Study PN097, which is contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan, P/0101/2020, has been 
completed after 26 January 2007, is considered as significant. 
2.10.  Product information

As a result of this procedure, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC, as well as the corresponding 
sections of the package leaflet, are updated.  
Annex II was also amended to include a new batch release site (N.V. Organon, Kloosterstraat 6, 5349 
AB Oss, The Netherlands), added as the manufacturing site responsible for the batch release of the 
new pharmaceutical form: gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension. 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The Package Leaflet for Noxafil 300mg gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension was 
adapted from that for the existing Noxafil formulations, with the addition of Instructions for Use to 
provide guidance on how to take the powder and solvent for oral suspension. On behalf of the MAH, a 
contractor conducted a User Test in line with the EU guidance. Methodology and quality aspects were 
in accordance with readability requirements. 
The results of User Testing demonstrated that at least 90% of the participants were able to find each 
point of information. It also showed that at least 90% of those participants were able to understand 
the information. Overall, the outcome of the user testing for the patient leaflet is considered positive. 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in 
immunocompromised patients, especially in those considered at high risk for severe and prolonged 
neutropenia or those who have received HSCT. As in adults, the paediatric patients at risk for 
developing IFI, primarily due to neutropenia and T-cell dysfunction, include, but are not limited to, 
allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients, and patients with acute leukemias, myelodysplasia, severe 
aplastic anemia, and advanced-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The most common IFI in these 
immunocompromised children are aspergillosis, candidiasis and mucormycosis. 
Posaconazole is indicated for use in the treatment of the following fungal infections in adults: 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 85/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  
Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or 
itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
-  
Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are 
intolerant of amphotericin B; 
-  
Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole 
or in patients who are intolerant of itraconazole; 
-  
Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or 
fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
- 
Oropharyngeal candidiasis: as first-line therapy in patients who have severe disease or are 
immunocompromised, in whom response to topical therapy is expected to be poor. 
Posaconazole is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following patients: 
- 
Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) 
or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are at high 
risk of developing invasive fungal infections;  
- 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose 
immunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing 
invasive fungal infections. 
As a result of this paediatric extension of indication and the introduction of a new oral formulation 
(PFS), posaconazole (with the exception the oral suspension) will be indicated in children from 2 years 
of age for the prevention and treatment of fungal infections, including IFI, with an expected decrease 
of mortality. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Several antifungal agents are approved for antifungal prophylaxis or treatment in children. These 
include triazoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole), lipid amphotericin B, and 
echinocandins (caspofungin and micafungin), each with their own benefits and risks. The choice of 
antifungal prophylaxis or treatment for paediatric patients is limited by side effects profiles, drug-drug 
interactions and PK characteristics. More agents and studies on existing agents are needed. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This paediatric extension is based on the PK bridge study P097. This is a Phase 1b, non-randomized, 
multicenter, open-label, sequential dose-escalation study, with 3 doses cohorts (3.5, 4.5 and 6 
mg/kg/day) of POS IV or oral (new formulation PFS). Overall, 115 immunocompromised children (2 to 
<18 years old) were treated with POS for prophylaxis of IFI. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The use of a 6 mg/kg dose of POS (IV or PFS) in paediatric subjects from 2 years of age is associated 
to an adequate POS exposure, within the endorsed Cavg target between 500 and 2500 ng/mL. The use 
of a 300 mg dose with the POS tablet formulation for paediatric patients over a weight of 40 kg is also 
endorsed as regards this PK target attainment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 86/91 
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study P097 was not designed to assess clinical efficacy of POS for the prophylaxis of IFI in paediatric 
immunocompromised patients. This is not an efficacy study, there is no comparison of POS vs an 
active comparator (such as voriconazole).  
With the initially proposed dose of 6mg/kg, a non-negligible percentage of paediatric subjects from 2 
to <7 years old (6.8%) is predicted to have a Cavg below the target of 500 ng/mL, and therefore be 
potentially treated with a suboptimal POS dose. 
However, with the increased dose for the age group with body weight of 10-30kg of 8mg/kg, a Cavg 
above 500ng/ml, only a predicted 1.4% of patients 10 to 30kg will reach a Cavg below the 500ng/ml 
target. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  analysis  of  the  combined  AE  data  and  exposure-safety  relationship  from  studies  P032  and  P097 
demonstrates that the posaconazole IV and PFS formulations are generally well tolerated in the paediatric 
population aged 2 years and above. The safety profile of posaconazole IV and PFS observed in the two 
studies is consistent with that described in the product label. 
The overall rate of drug-related SAEs (1.6%) was low in the combined pool and in the individual 
studies. This low rate is similar to overall rates of drug-related SAEs reported in adult studies (3% in 
P05615 with posaconazole tablet and 1% in P05520 with posaconazole IV formulation. No individual 
drug-related SAE was reported in >1 subject in either treatment group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
To ensure proper use of the newly introduced PFS formulation, the product labelling and package 
carton will clearly state that Noxafil OS and Noxafil PFS are not to be used interchangeably. However, 
an oral suspension already exists and is not interchangeable, especially there is a risk of confusion 
between these formulations leading to potential dosing error. Such switch may therefore lead to 
possible risks associated with patients receiving incorrect formulation and/or dose of posaconazole 
include either lack of efficacy due to subtherapeutic drug levels, or drug toxicity due to 
supratherapeutic drug levels”. The current SmPCs, packagings, and leaflets already contain warnings 
on Non-Interchangeability between Noxafil Tablets and Noxafil Oral Suspension, and a DHPC had been 
sent at the time when this issue arose. In line with these previous measures, a one-time DHPC letter 
and warnings in the product information (including the packaging) will be disseminated prior to 
launching the PFS formulation in order to prevent potential medication errors. 
3.6.  Effects Table 
Not relevant for this PK bridging application. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
With the new paediatric PFS formulation, an oral POS regimen is available to ensure an adequate POS 
exposure within the therapeutic range, and therefore an effective antifungal activity for a prophylactic 
Assessment report  
EMA/702418/2021  
Page 87/91 
 
 
 
or curative treatment of IFI in immunocompromised children from 2 years of age. The IV formulation is 
also concerned by this paediatric extension.  
A new PFS formulation is introduced. To ensure proper use of the newly introduced PFS formulation, 
the product labelling and package carton will clearly state that Noxafil OS and Noxafil PFS are not to be 
used interchangeably. However, in order to prevent medication errors, a one-time DHPC letter will be 
disseminated and warnings introduced in the product information (including the packaging). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
With the new PFS paediatric formulation and the proposed dosing regimen, children from 2 years of 
age will benefit of a treatment for the prophylaxis and treatment of IFI, similarly to the adult 
population. Although no efficacy data were available in this paediatric population, it has been 
demonstrated through a PK bridge study than POS exposure with this new oral formulation is similar to 
that observed in adults and within the therapeutic range. In order to attain a target Cavg of more than 
500 ng/ml, a different dosing regimen is proposed based on body weight: 8mg/kg for paediatric 
patients of 10-30kg bw and respectively 6mg/kg for patients 31-40 kg bw.  
The safety profile of POS observed in this paediatric population is consistent with that described in the 
product information. As another POS oral formulation is available on the market, the potential risk of 
confusion and dosing error between these formulations is mitigated by clear information in the product 
literature and dissemination of a one-time DHPC. 
In conclusion, considering the limited available therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of 
IFI in paediatric subjects, and the high mortality rate of such infections, the benefit-risk balance for 
this paediatric extension is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Noxafil is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP, by consensus, is of the opinion that Noxafil is not similar to isavuconazonium sulfate within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix on similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Noxafil 300 mg gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension 
(PFS) is favourable in the following indications: 
Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension is indicated for use in the 
treatment of the following fungal infections in paediatric patients from 2 years of age (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1):

CHMP also adopted an extension to the existing indications for Noxafil gastro-resistant tablets and 
Noxafil concentrate for solution for infusion as follows (New text as bold): 
- Noxafil gastro-resistant tablets are indicated for use in the treatment of the following fungal 
infections in paediatric patients from 2 years of age weighing more than 40 kg and adults 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.1):

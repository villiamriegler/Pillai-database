Introduction 
On 22 June 2016, the MAH submitted the completed paediatric study M11-328 for Humira, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. This submission also fulfils 
the MAH obligation listed in the Humira Risk Management Plan to submit the final CSR for Study M11-
328, as a required additional pharmacovigilance activity, by July 2016. 
A short clinical overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study M11-328 is a stand-alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Humira 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection for paediatric use 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for M11-328: “A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study 
of the Efficacy and Safety of Adalimumab in Pediatric Subjects with Enthesitis Related Arthritis” 
Study M11-328 was a Phase 3, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled, multicenter study with an open-
label (OL) period conducted in Canada, Mexico, and Europe in paediatric subjects with enthesitis-
related arthritis (ERA), who were at least 6 years but less than 18 years of age at Baseline. 
Approximately 45 paediatric patients with ERA were planned to be enrolled. 
An interim CSR with a data cut-off of 29 November 2012 (Week 52 visits were complete for all 
subjects) was previously written and submitted in December 2013; this CSR was the basis for approval 
of the variation (EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0127) to extend the indication for adalimumab for the treatment 
of paediatric subjects with ERA, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or 
are intolerant of, conventional therapy in September 2014. 
The final CSR for the study is provided with the current submission and contains additional safety data 
up to Week 204 and additional efficacy data up to Week 156. 
1.3.2.  Clinical study 
M11-328: “A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study of the Efficacy and Safety of 
Adalimumab in Pediatric Subjects with Enthesitis Related Arthritis” 
Description 
This was a Phase 3, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled, multicenter study with an open-label (OL) 
period in paediatric subjects with ERA.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab given 
subcutaneously (SC) every other week (eow) as compared with placebo in paediatric subjects with ERA 
and to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of adalimumab following SC 
administration in this subject population. 
Study design 
The study included a 30-day Screening period, a 12-week DB placebo controlled treatment period with 
an early escape option, and an OL adalimumab eow treatment period with a maximum duration of 192 
weeks, and a follow-up phone call 70 days after the last dose of adalimumab. 
Subjects who met enrollment criteria were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either adalimumab 
(body surface area [BSA] dosing 24 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 40 mg) eow or matching placebo via 
SC injection. An early escape option at Weeks 4 and 8 was provided for subjects who either 
experienced a worsening of disease or failed to improve. 
The option for early escape was available in case a subject experienced a decline in disease status, 
defined as an increase in the number of active joints by ≥30% with a minimum of at least 2 additional 
active joints compared with Baseline, at the Week 4 visit or had failed to improve, as defined as <30% 
improvement in the number of active joints compared with Baseline, at the Week 8 visit. 
For subjects who completed the blinded period, the OL period began at the Week 12 visit. 
For subjects who met the criteria for early escape, the OL period began at the Week 4 or Week 8 visit 
(depending on when the criteria were met). During the OL period, each subject received OL 
adalimumab eow for a maximum of 192 weeks. The OL period continued until Week 204 or until a 
subject completed 108 weeks of treatment (from Baseline) and adalimumab received country and local 
(if applicable) regulatory approval for ERA and all applicable local reimbursement procedures were 
completed.  All subjects not continuing on adalimumab after the end of the study had a 70-day follow-
up phone call to obtain follow-up information on any new or ongoing adverse events (AEs).

Treatments 
Study drug (adalimumab or placebo) was provided as a sterile, preservative-free solution for SC 
injection contained in 0.8 mL single-use vials. Study drug was to be administered SC by subject, 
parent or legal guardian, or qualified designee eow at approximately the same time of day. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the number of 
active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with LOM + pain and/or tenderness). 
The efficacy of adalimumab compared to placebo was evaluated using the following secondary (ranked) 
variables at Week 12: 
1. Number of sites of enthesitis 
2. Tender joint count (TJC) for 72 joints 
3. Swollen joint count (SJC) for 68 joints 
4. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric (Pedi)30 response 
5. ACR Pedi50 response 
6. ACR Pedi70 response 
The OL period began at the Week 12 visit for subjects who completed the DB period. For subjects who 
met the criteria for early escape, the OL period began either at Week 4 or Week 8 (depending on when 
the criteria were met). 
In addition to the Week 12 visit, subjects were to visit the study site at Weeks 16, 20, 24, 28, 36, 44, 
52, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, 168, 180, 192, and 204 (Final Study Completion Visit), or 
if they terminated early from the study. 
Assessor’s comment: 
No efficacy data was collected beyond Week 156. 
Efficacy variables (other than the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 12) included the 
following (Table 1 below):

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 5/21 
 
 
 
 
Table 1: 
Non-ranked secondary efficacy variables analysed by category  
Statistical Methods 
The analysis of all data through the Week 52 visit (DB period plus the first 40 weeks of the OL period) 
was conducted after all ongoing subjects in the study completed Week 52 and the data were cleaned. 
This efficacy and safety analysis was the only and final analysis of data from this time period. 
Efficacy analyses were to be conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set. Missing or incomplete 
data were handled using the nonresponder imputation (NRI) method, as observed cases, and the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) methods as appropriate. The safety analysis was to be conducted 
on the safety analysis set.  
OL period 
Analysis of results from the 192-week OL period is descriptive. Results in the OL period were reported 
stratified by the treatment the subject was randomized to in the DB period and overall. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The data through the Week 52 visit (DB period plus the first 40 weeks of the OL period) has been 
reported and assessed previously as part of the approval procedure to extend the indication for 
adalimumab for the treatment of paediatric subjects with ERA (see EMEA/H/C/481/II/127). 
Long term effectiveness of adalimumab during the OL period was analyzed. This is further discussed 
below. Key results from the DB and early OL part of the study will be included for reference.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 46 paediatric subjects with ERA were randomized at 16 study sites located in Canada, 
France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. 
Seventeen subjects discontinued from the study, all during the OL period; 4 of these subjects 
discontinued due to sustained remission. Seven subjects (3 randomized to placebo, 4 randomized to 
adalimumab) early escaped from the DB period to the OL period. See Table 2 below.

Baseline data 
The majority of subjects in the ITT analysis set were male (67.4%) and white (76.1%); mean age was 
12.9±2.9 years. Subjects reported having had symptoms of ERA for a mean of 2.6 years and had been 
diagnosed with ERA for a mean of 1.9 years prior to Baseline. A total of 91.3% of subjects previously 
used DMARDs for their ERA, 100.0% previously used NSAIDs, and 56.5% previously used 
corticosteroids. No statistically significant differences were observed between treatment groups. 
PK results 
PK results and conclusions have been presented previously in a separate PK report (R&D/13/011). 
Assessor’s comment: 
Adalimumab trough levels were obtained at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 52; see 
EMEA/H/C/481/II/127. PK data in children with ERA was considered to be similar to children with 
polyarticular juvenile arthritis. Similarly, data on immunogenicity was collected up to Week 52 and 
assessed previously. These data will not be further discussed here.

Table 5: 
Sensitivity analyses for percent change from Baseline at Week 12 in number

Assessor’s comment: 
The primary efficacy variable was in favour of adalimumab (mean percent decrease of –62.6% in 
subjects in the adalimumab group compared to –11.6% in subjects in the placebo group (P = 0.039; 
LOCF). This finding was supported by sensitivity analyses using as observed data, as well as non-
parametric methods and numerically improvement observed in the PP analysis set (for details see 
EMEA/H/C/481/II/127).

Ranked secondary variables 
Results for number of sites of enthesitis, TJC, SJC, ACR Pedi30 response, and ACR Pedi50 response 
were numerically superior in favour of adalimumab; Results for the 6th ranked secondary efficacy 
variable, ACR Pedi70 response, reached statistical significance at Week 12. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The ranked secondary variables were tested in hierarchical order for statistical significance between 
the groups at Week 12. That is, statistically significant results (P value ≤ 0.05) must be achieved for a 
comparison in the higher rank in order to initiate the next comparison in the lower rank. As illustrated 
by the table, the key secondary endpoints did not reach statistical significance even though the 
adalimumab group tended to show improvement of variable size (see Table 6 below).  
During the approval procedure for this indication (EMEA/H/C/481/II/127), it was considered that the 
greater difference between the treated and placebo group observed for ACR Pedi50 and 70 as 
compared to Pedi30 pointed towards a true treatment effect with adalimumab compared to placebo, 
and this was considered supportive of the primary endpoint. In this regard, it should be noted that the 
final CSR states the following:  
“After the blind break, it was discovered that the statistical conventions for calculation of ACR Pedi30/50/70 
responses specified in the SAP were inconsistent with the published methodology and expert opinion for calculation 
of the response rates. Specifically, the following convention was noted in the SAP Amendment 1: 
If hs-CRP values at both Baseline and comparison visits are within the normal reference range, hs-CRP values will 
not be used to evaluate ACR Pediatric response.  
Additionally, handling of baseline values of "0" was not described in the SAP. Thus, ACR Pedi30/50/70 response 
rates presented in this report were re-calculated: 
 - The hs-CRP was handled as a continuous variable, regardless of whether or not it was within normal limits at both 
Baseline and comparison visits. 
 - A change of "0" was reported as a percent change of "0" regardless of the baseline value.  
In addition to the analyses defined in the final SAP, an additional sensitivity analysis was performed removing a 
subject from the PP analysis. During preparation for the final database lock, an additional protocol deviation with 
potential impact on the primary endpoint was identified for this subject.” 
Consequently, the ACR Pedi30/50/70 response data were recalculated and therefore slightly differ (and 
are numerically somewhat more in favour of adalimumab) as compared to the previously reported 
results (through Week 52 only) in EMEA/H/C/481/II/127.  
However, these changes are not considered to have impact on the B/R.

Decreases in the mean percent change from Baseline in the number of active joints with arthritis 
continued through Week 156, with an average of only 0.9 active joints with arthritis at Week 156 as 
compared to 7.8 at Baseline (see Table 7 below).

Assessor’s comment: 
As noted by the MAH, a step down procedure was used to handle multiplicity regarding the primary 
and the ranked (key) secondary endpoints (i.e. at Week 12). All other comparisons were to be 
considered as exploratory analyses.  
Results beyond Week 12 reflect the switch from placebo to OL adalimumab. Results for observed cases 
were similar (Table 14.2_2.1.2.2 in the final CSR); at Week 156 (the last visit for collection of efficacy 
data, 12 of the 15 placebo patients (80%) and 26 of the 31 adalimumab patients (84%) had remained 
in the study.  
•  Number of sites of enthesitis 
During the DB period, numerically (not statistically significant) larger decreases from Baseline were 
seen at Week 12 in the number of sites of enthesitis for subjects randomized to the adalimumab group 
compared to placebo using the LOCF approach (ITT). During the OL period, decreases in the number of 
enthesitis sites continued to be seen to Week 156 in subjects with any exposure to adalimumab, with 
an average of only 2.1 active sites of enthesitis at Week 156 compared to 8.1 at Baseline.

• 
Tender joint count (TJC) 
During the DB period, a numerically, but not statistically significantly greater decrease in mean change 
from Baseline in TJC was seen at Week 12 in subjects randomized to the adalimumab group compared 
to the placebo group using the LOCF approach (ITT). During the OL period, decreases in mean change 
in number of joints with pain/tenderness continued to be seen through Week 156, with greater than 
85% mean improvement from Baseline in subjects with any exposure to adalimumab.

• 
Swollen joint count (SJC) 
During the DB period a numerically, but not statistically significantly greater decrease in mean change 
from Baseline in SJC was seen at Week 12 in subjects randomized to the adalimumab group compared 
to the placebo group using the LOCF approach (ITT). 
During the OL period, decreases in mean change from Baseline in the number of joints with swelling 
continued to be seen through Week 156 with greater than 85% mean improvement from Baseline in 
subjects with any exposure to adalimumab. 
Table 10: 
Change from Baseline in SJC (ITT; LOCF) 
•  ACR Pedi30/50/70 
During the DB period using the NRI approach on the ITT analysis set, statistically significant results 
were observed for the more stringent ACR Pedi70 response in favour of the adalimumab treatment 
group. Responses for ACR Pedi30 and ACR Pedi50 responses were numerically superior in favor of 
adalimumab; however, no statistically significant differences were observed between the proportion of 
subjects randomized to the adalimumab group or the placebo group at Week 12. During the first 12 
weeks of the OL period (Week 24), the percentages of ACR Pedi30/50/70 responders increased and 
then were maintained through Week 156 with over 75% of subjects achieving ACR Pedi30/50/70 
responses at Week 156 (Tables 11-13 below).

Assessor’s comment: 
As noted previously, also in the previous assessment, the study is limited by its small sample size. 
However, it appears that the improvements and trends towards improvements observed for 
adalimumab during the DB period and the early open-label period generally were maintained. The 
tables above summarize the ITT set using LOCF but results were similar for observed case only data.

Safety results 
Mean duration of treatment with adalimumab was 78.5 days during the DB period and 1147.1 days for 
subjects who received adalimumab at any time during the study. 
During the DB period, a greater percentage of subjects who received adalimumab (21/31, 67.7%) 
reported at least 1 AE compared with subjects who received placebo (8/15, 53.3%) (Table 12 below). 
The most frequently reported AEs (reported by ≥2 subjects in any treatment group) included upper 
respiratory tract infection, headache, gastroenteritis, injection site pain, nausea, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased, abdominal pain upper, and syncope (Table 13 below).  
All AEs were considered mild or moderate in severity by the Investigator and most subjects (n = 16) 
reported AEs that were considered by the Investigator to be not related or probably not related to 
study drug. Nine subjects in the adalimumab treatment group reported possibly or probably related 
AEs compared to 4 subjects in the placebo group. Two serious AEs (SAEs) were reported by 1 subject 
in the adalimumab treatment group (abdominal pain upper and headache).

Table 13: 
Most frequently reported TEAEs (≥2 subjects in any treatment group) – DB  
period (Safety analysis set) 
When including the OL period, all subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab at any time 
during the study experienced at least 1 AE. The most frequently reported AEs (reported by ≥ 15% of 
subjects) included upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, headache, diarrhea, 
gastroenteritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (worsening of ERA), pharyngitis, and 
pharyngotonsillitis.  
Seven subjects in the any adalimumab set reported at least 1 severe AE (disseminated tuberculosis; 
latent TB; pustular psoriasis; JIA [worsening of ERA]; second degree burns and third degree burns [in 
the same subject]; blood pressure increased and weight increased [in the same subject]; and diffuse 
vasculitis, pneumonia, and JIA [worsening of ERA, in the same subject]).  
Twenty-nine subjects reported AEs that were considered possibly or probably related to study drug by 
the Investigator. Related events that were reported by more than 2 subjects were nasopharyngitis, 
pharyngotonsillitis, and injection site erythema (3 subjects each); otitis media and upper respiratory 
tract infection (4 subjects each); and injection site pain (5 subjects). 
No deaths were reported. Overall, 6 SAEs in 5 subjects were considered by the Investigator possibly or 
probably related to the study drug (upper abdominal pain and headache [in the same subject], 
disseminated TB, appendicitis, urinary tract infection, and diffuse vasculitis).

Assessor’s comment: 
Ten subjects reported a total of 19 SAEs. One subject  reported a SAE of active TB (disseminated TB) 
during the OL period, which led to discontinuation of study drug and was considered as probably 
related to study drug by the Investigator. Two subjects reported treatment emergent latent TB in the 
OL period. One event was a nonserious event of latent TB that was considered probably related to 
study drug by the Investigator. The other event was an SAE of positive tuberculin test that was 
considered to be probably not related to study drug. One subject developed an SAE of diffuse vasculitis 
on Day 433 and subsequently developed progressive respiratory distress, congestive heart failure and 
pneumonia. Study drug was discontinued as a causal relationship with study drug could not be ruled 
out. 
None of the following events of special interest were reported during the study: 
Legionella infection, reactivation of hepatitis B, opportunistic infection, oral candidiasis; progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), malignancies (including lymphoma, 
NMSC, melanoma, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma [HSTCL], and leukemia), lupus-like syndrome, 
demyelinating disease, hematologic events, diverticulitis, intestinal perforation, intestinal stricture, 
pulmonary embolism, interstitial lung disease, adalimumab error related events and maladministration, 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, pancreatitis, sarcoidosis, autoimmune 
hepatitis, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS). 
Seven subjects prematurely discontinued due to AEs, all during or following OL treatment 
(disseminated TB; Ps; JIA [worsening of ERA] and pain; dermatitis allergic; pustular Ps, injection site 
pain and injection site pruritus; and diffuse vasculitis and congestive heart failure). 
Assessor’s comment: 
All AEs leading to discontinuation were considered by the Investigator to be possibly or probably 
related to the study drug, with the exception of the 2 events leading to the discontinuation of a subject  
(JIA [worsening of ERA] and pain). 
During the DB period changes from Baseline in laboratory parameters were small and not clinically 
significant in both treatment groups. For subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab at any 
time during the study the majority of hematology parameters demonstrated infrequent shifts from 
Baseline to the Week 204 visit with the exception of platelets which demonstrated a shift from high to 
normal values in 13 subjects and eosinophils from high to normal values in 7 subjects.  
Shifts in clinical chemistry parameters were infrequent and not considered clinically meaningful in the 
DB period. For subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab at any time, the majority of 
clinical chemistry parameters demonstrated infrequent shifts from Baseline to the Week 204 visit with 
the exception of creatinine which demonstrated a shift from low to normal in 14 subjects, BUN, from 
high to normal in 10 subjects, and albumin from high to normal in 10 subjects.  
Seventeen subjects had at least 1 potentially clinically significant liver function test (LFT) value.  
Assessor’s comment: 
This was defined as ALT, AST and/or alkaline phosphatase ≥2.5 x ULN or total bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN. 
Elevated liver enzymes are listed as common ADRs in the current SmPC.

Three subjects experienced elevations in ALT and/or AST > 5 × ULN that improved to only mild 
elevation or normalized at the last visit value for this final report.  All other subjects had mildly 
elevated and mostly transient elevations in LFTs. 
•  One Subject  (randomized to adalimumab) had mildly elevated ALT values at almost every 
visit, with maximum ALT elevation of 6.36 × ULN occurring at Day 57 at which time AST was 
also elevated at 4.29 × ULN. ALT was mildly elevated (1.23 × ULN) at the final visit (Day 
1415, 14 days posttreatment). Slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase values were also 
observed at almost every visit beginning at the Screening visit with all values < 1.5 × ULN. 
•  One Subject  (randomized to adalimumab) had transient elevations in ALT (maximum 2.83 × 
ULN on Day 168 [Day 83 of the OL period] and AST (maximum 6 × ULN on Day 852 [Day 767 
of the OL period]) that normalized by the last visit (Day 1428, 1 day posttreatment). Mild 
elevations in alkaline phosphatase values (all < 2 × ULN) were observed at 17 consecutive 
visits beginning at Screening; the values normalized by Day 852 (Day 767 of the OL period) 
and remained as such by the last visit (Day 1428, 1 day posttreatment). 
•  One Subject  (randomized to placebo) had a single elevated value for both ALT (6.83 × ULN) 
and AST levels (5.43 × ULN) on Day 673 (Day 589 of the OL period). Study drug was not 
interrupted and the subject continued on OL therapy. ALT and AST levels returned to normal at 
the next visit and remained normal through the final visit (Day 1423; 6 days posttreatment). 
Overall, while 6 subjects had CTCAE toxicity grade ≥ 3 hematology or clinical chemistry value during 
the study, all were considered not clinically meaningful, and with the exception of 1 subject who 
continued to have mildly elevated ALT, all resolved by the last visit for each subject. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted the completed paediatric study M11-328 for Humira, in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. This submission also fulfils the MAH obligation listed in 
the Humira Risk Management Plan to submit the final CSR, as a required additional pharmacovigilance 
activity. M11-328 was a Phase 3, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled, multicenter study with an 
open-label (OL) period. The initial data through the Week 52 visit (a 12-week DB period plus the first 
40 weeks of the OL period) has been reported and assessed previously as part of the approval 
procedure to extend the indication for adalimumab for the treatment of paediatric subjects with ERA 
(EMEA/H/C/481/II/127).  
The primary efficacy variable was mean percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the number of 
active joints with arthritis, which was achieved in favour of adalimumab with mean percent decrease of 
–62.6% in subjects in the adalimumab group compared to – 11.6% in subjects in the placebo group (P 
= 0.039; last observation carried forward [LOCF]). This finding was supported by a number of 
sensitivity analyses using as observed data, non-parametric methods and numerically, but not 
statistically significant improvement observed in the PP analysis set. Results for the ranked secondary 
efficacy variables (number of sites of enthesitis, TJC, SJC, ACR Pedi 30, Pedi50, and Pedi70 response) 
were numerically superior in favour of adalimumab but none reached statistical significance at Week 
12. However, they were considered to be supportive of the primary endpoint and observed to be 
sustained or improving further during the OL period through Week 52. 
The final CSR provided with the current submission contained additional safety data up to Week 204 
and additional efficacy data up to Week 156. 
As noted previously, the interpretation of the study is limited by its small sample size. Most patients 
were retained in the study, however. At Week 156 (the last visit for collection of efficacy data, 12 of

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

the 15 placebo patients (80%) and 26 of the 31 adalimumab patients (84%) had remained in the 
study.   
Reviewing the additional OL efficacy data, it can be concluded that the improvements observed for 
adalimumab during the DB period and the early OL period (through Week 52) were generally 
maintained during the remainder of the open-label period. Improvement in number of active joints 
with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through Week 156 of the study. Similarly, 
improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, TJC, SJC, Pediatric ACR 50 
response, and Pediatric ACR 70 response was generally maintained. 
In the final CSR, the MAH reported that the statistical conventions for calculation of ACR Pedi30/50/70 
responses specified in the SAP were inconsistent with the published methodology and expert opinion 
for calculation of the response rates.  Consequently, the ACR Pedi30/50/70 response data had been 
recalculated (numerically somewhat more in favour of adalimumab) as compared to the previously 
reported results in EMEA/H/C/481/II/127. This is not considered to have impact on the overall outcome 
of the study. 
In light of the findings, it is considered appropriate to amend Section 5.1 of the SmPC as follows: 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
The safety……….Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL 
period through Week 52 156 of the study for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the Humira group 
who remained in the study. 
From a safety perspective, the pattern of adverse events observed during this small study was 
consistent with previous data and is considered sufficiently covered by the existing product 
information. No new safety signals were observed.  
In summary, the results from the finalized CSR for study M11-328 are consistent with previous 
conclusions. The Benefit-Risk for Humira is unchanged. 
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The results from the finalized CSR for study M11-328 are consistent with previous conclusions. The 
Benefit-Risk for Humira is unchanged. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
The MAH is requested to submit a variation to amend the product information as follows: 
Section 5.1 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
The safety……….Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL 
period through Week 52 156 of the study for the 26 of 31 (84%) patients in the Humira group 
who remained in the study.

A multi-centre, open-label, single-group paediatric study 
adolescent males (14 years and older) with 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, in combination 
with human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) for 
Elonva, based on final results of the paediatric study 
P043. Study P043 was an open-label, non-
comparative, multi-center safety and efficacy study 
of corifollitropin in association with hCG in male 
adolescents with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, 
part of the paediatric investigation plan; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 10 of the 
RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to implement some minor editorial and 
formatting changes throughout the PI.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or 
was performed that evaluated the treatment of 
corifollitropin alfa (CFA) in combination with human 
Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) to induce and/or restore 
puberty and induce and/or restore spermatogenesis with a 
total maximum duration of 73 weeks in 17 adolescent 
males aged 14 years and older with hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism. 
The applied regimen of 12 weeks of pre-treatment with CFA 
and subsequently 52 weeks of CFA combined with hCG 
showed adequate induction of testicular development 
(measured by increase in testicular volume from 
prepubertal to mid pubertal size) in adolescent males with 
HH. Important findings on development of secondary 
sexual characteristics at week 64 included increased 
testosterone levels, growth velocity and progression of 
puberty (Tanner III, IV and V) indicated appropriate 
responses to hCG. Decreasing anti-Mullerian hormone 
levels and increases in Inhibin B levels were suggestive of 
initiation of spermatogenesis. The use of CFA appeared to 
be well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile and 
without unexpected safety signals over a treatment period 
of 64 weeks.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC were implemented to reflect a new indication and 
recommendations of use for the treatment of adolescent 
males (14 years and older) with hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism, in combination with human Chorionic 
Gonadotropin (hCG) and to include the final study results of 
the paediatric study.

women who weigh more than 60 kilograms, regardless of 
age, and women who weigh 50 kilograms or more and who 
are older than 36 years of age. Women older than 36 years 
of age who weighed less than 50 kilograms were not 
studied. 
The integrated safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic 
information from an integrated analysis of the phase III 
studies PURSUE, ENSURE, ENGAGE and TRUST has been 
updated in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the Elonva SmPC, 
respectively. 
With regard to immunogenicity, of the 2,511 women 
treated with Elonva who were evaluated for the formation 
of post-treatment antibodies, four (0.16%) had evidence of 
antibody formation, including three who had been exposed 
once to Elonva and one who had been exposed twice to 
Elonva. In each case, these antibodies were non-
neutralizing and did not interfere with the response to

stimulation or the normal physiologic responses of the 
Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) axis. Two of these 
four women became pregnant during the same treatment 
cycle in which antibodies were detected, suggesting that 
the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies after 
stimulation with Elonva is not clinically relevant.

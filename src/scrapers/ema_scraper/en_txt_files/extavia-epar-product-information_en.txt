CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Extavia is indicated for the treatment of: 
• 
Patients with a single demyelinating event with an active inflammatory process, if it is severe 
enough to warrant treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, if alternative diagnoses have been 
excluded, and if they are determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite multiple 
sclerosis (see section 5.1). 
Patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and two or more relapses within the last two 
years. 
Patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease, evidenced by 
relapses. 
• 
• 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The treatment with Extavia should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of the disease. 
Posology 
Adults and adolescents from 12-17 years of age 
The recommended dose of Extavia is 250 microgram (8.0 million IU), contained in 1 ml of the 
reconstituted solution (see section 6.6), to be injected subcutaneously every other day. 
Generally, dose titration is recommended at the start of treatment. 
Patients should be started at 62.5 microgram (0.25 ml) subcutaneously every other day, and increased 
slowly to a dose of 250 microgram (1.0 ml) every other day (see Table A). The titration period may be 
adjusted, if any significant adverse reaction occurs. In order to obtain adequate efficacy, a dose of 
250 microgram (1.0 ml) every other day should be reached.

The optimal dose has not been fully clarified. 
At the present time, it is not known for how long the patient should be treated. There are follow-up 
data under controlled clinical conditions for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis for up 
to 5 years and for patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis for up to 3 years. For 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, efficacy has been demonstrated for therapy for the first two 
years. The available data for the additional three years are consistent with sustained treatment efficacy 
of Extavia over the whole time period. 
In patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis, efficacy has been demonstrated 
over a period of three years. 
Treatment is not recommended in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who have 
experienced less than 2 relapses in the previous 2 years or in patients with secondary-progressive 
multiple sclerosis who have had no active disease in the previous 2 years. 
If the patient fails to respond, for example a steady progression in Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS) for 6 months occurs or treatment with at least 3 courses of adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH) or corticosteroids during a one-year period is required despite Extavia therapy, treatment with 
Extavia should be stopped. 
Paediatric population 
No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. 
However, limited published data suggest that the safety profile in adolescents from 12 to 17 years of 
age receiving Extavia 8.0 million IU subcutaneously every other day is similar to that seen in adults. 
No data are available on the use of Extavia in children under 12 years of age and therefore Extavia 
should not be used in this population. 
Method of administration 
The reconstituted solution is to be injected subcutaneously every other day. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Immune system disorders 
The administration of cytokines to patients with a pre-existing monoclonal gammopathy has been 
associated with the development of systemic capillary leak syndrome with shock-like symptoms and 
fatal outcome. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Cases of pancreatitis were observed with Extavia use, often associated with hypertriglyceridaemia. 
Nervous system disorders 
Extavia should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders, 
in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal 
ideation are known to occur with increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in 
association with interferon use. Patients treated with Extavia should be advised to immediately report 
any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting 
depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Extavia and treated appropriately. 
Cessation of therapy with Extavia should be considered (see also sections 4.3 and 4.8). 
Extavia should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to patients receiving 
treatment with anti-epileptics, and in particular to patients with epilepsy who are not adequately 
controlled with anti-epileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
This medicinal product contains human albumin and hence carries a potential risk for transmission of 
viral diseases. A risk for transmission of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) cannot be excluded. 
Laboratory tests 
Regular thyroid function tests are recommended in patients with a history of thyroid dysfunction or as 
clinically indicated. 
In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, 
complete blood and differential white blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistries, 
including liver function tests (e.g. aspartate aminotransferase serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 
(SGOT), alanine aminotransferase serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) and gamma 
glutamyltransferase), are recommended prior to initiation and at regular intervals following 
introduction of Extavia therapy, and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. 
Patients with anaemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia (alone or in any combination) may require 
more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. Patients 
who develop neutropenia should be monitored closely for the development of fever or infection. There 
have been reports of thrombocytopenia, with profound decreases in platelet count.

Hepatobiliary disorders 
Asymptomatic elevations of serum transaminases, in most cases mild and transient, occurred very 
commonly in patients treated with Extavia during clinical trials. As for other beta interferons, cases of 
severe hepatic injury, including hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with Extavia. 
The most serious events often occurred in patients exposed to other medicinal products or substances 
known to be associated with hepatotoxicity or in the presence of co-morbid medical conditions (e.g. 
metastasising malignant disease, severe infection and sepsis, alcohol abuse). 
Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury. The occurrence of elevations in serum 
transaminases should lead to close monitoring and investigation. Withdrawal of Extavia should be 
considered if the levels significantly increase or if they are associated with clinical symptoms such as 
jaundice. In the absence of clinical evidence for liver damage, and after normalisation of liver 
enzymes, a reintroduction of therapy could be considered with appropriate follow-up of hepatic 
functions. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and haemolytic anaemia (HA) 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or 
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta 
products. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central 
nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings 
suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical 
features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and 
renal function is recommended. Additionally, cases of HA not associated with TMA, including 
immune HA, have been reported with interferon beta products. Life-threatening and fatal cases have 
been reported. Cases of TMA and/or HA have been reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. If TMA 
and/or HA is diagnosed, and a relationship to Extavia is suspected, prompt treatment is required (in 
case of TMA considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Extavia is 
recommended. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Caution should be used and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta to 
patients with severe renal failure. 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), minimal change disease (MCD), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during 
treatment with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment 
and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs 
or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function, is recommended, especially in 
patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and 
discontinuation of treatment with Extavia should be considered. 
Cardiac disorders 
Extavia should also be used with caution in patients who suffer from pre-existing cardiac disorders. 
Patients with pre-existing significant cardiac disease, such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery 
disease or arrhythmia, should be monitored for worsening of their cardiac condition, particularly 
during initiation of treatment with Extavia. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While Extavia does not have any known direct-acting cardiac toxicity, symptoms of the flu-like 
syndrome associated with beta interferons may prove stressful to patients with pre-existing significant 
cardiac disease. During the post-marketing period very rare reports have been received of temporary 
worsening of cardiac status at the start of Extavia therapy in patients with pre-existing significant 
cardiac disease. 
Cases of cardiomyopathy have been reported. If this occurs and a relationship to Extavia is suspected, 
treatment should be discontinued. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions (severe acute reactions such as bronchospasm, anaphylaxis and 
urticaria) may occur. If reactions are severe, Extavia should be discontinued and appropriate medical 
intervention instituted. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions, including injection site infection and injection site necrosis have been reported 
in patients using Extavia (see section 4.8). Injection site necrosis can be extensive and may involve 
muscle fascia as well as fat and therefore can result in scar formation. Debridement and, less often, 
skin grafting are occasionally required and healing may take up to 6 months. 
If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of 
fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with his/her physician before 
continuing injections with Extavia. 
If the patient has multiple lesions Extavia should be discontinued until healing has occurred. Patients 
with single lesions may continue on Extavia provided the necrosis is not too extensive, as some 
patients have experienced healing of injection site necrosis whilst on Extavia. 
To minimise the risk of injection site infection and injection site necrosis, patients should be advised 
to: 
− 
− 
use an aseptic injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each dose. 
The incidence of injection site reactions may be reduced by the use of an auto-injector. In the pivotal 
study of patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis an auto-injector was used 
in the majority of patients. Injection site reactions and necroses were observed less frequently in this 
study than in the other pivotal studies. 
The procedure for self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically, especially if 
injection site reactions have occurred. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. In controlled clinical trials 
serum samples were collected every 3 months for monitoring of development of antibodies to Extavia. 
In the different controlled clinical trials, between 23% and 41% of the patients developed serum 
interferon beta-1b neutralising activity confirmed by at least two consecutive positive titres. Between 
43% and 55% of these patients converted to a stable antibody negative status (based on two 
consecutive negative titres) during the subsequent observational period of the trial concerned. 
The development of neutralising activity is associated with a reduction in clinical efficacy only with 
regard to relapse activity. Some analyses suggest that this effect might be more pronounced in patients 
with higher titre levels of neutralising activity. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the study of patients with a single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis, neutralising 
activity measured every 6 months was observed at least once in 32% (89) of the patients treated 
immediately with Extavia. 60% (53) of these patients returned to negative status based on the last 
available assessment within the 5-year period. Within this period, the development of neutralising 
activity was associated with a significant increase in newly active lesions and T2 lesion volume on 
magnetic resonance imaging. However, this did not seem to be associated with a reduction in clinical 
efficacy (with regard to time to clinically definite multiple sclerosis [CDMS], time to confirmed EDSS 
progression and relapse rate). 
New adverse events have not been associated with the development of neutralising activity. 
It has been demonstrated in vitro that Extavia cross-reacts with natural interferon beta. However, this 
has not been investigated in vivo and its clinical significance is uncertain. 
There are sparse and inconclusive data on patients who have developed neutralising activity and have 
completed Extavia therapy. 
The decision to continue or discontinue treatment should be based on clinical disease activity rather 
than on neutralising activity status. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
Latex-sensitive individuals 
The removable tip cap of the Extavia pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. 
Although no natural rubber latex is detected in the cap, the safe use of Extavia pre-filled syringe in 
latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied and there is therefore a potential risk for 
hypersensitivity reactions which cannot be completely ruled out. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
The effect of alternate-day administration of 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) Extavia on drug 
metabolism in multiple sclerosis patients is unknown. Corticosteroid or ACTH treatment of relapses 
for periods of up to 28 days has been well tolerated in patients receiving Extavia. 
Due to the lack of clinical experience in multiple sclerosis patients, the use of Extavia together with 
immunomodulators other than corticosteroids or ACTH is not recommended. 
Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes 
in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when Extavia is administered in combination 
with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. anti-epileptics. Additional caution should be exercised 
with any co-medication which has an effect on the haematopoetic system. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1 000 pregnancy outcomes) from interferon beta registries, national 
registries and post-marketing experience indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies, 
after pre-conception exposure or exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, the duration of exposure during the first trimester is uncertain, because data were collected 
when interferon beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and treatment was likely interrupted 
when the pregnancy was detected and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the second and 
third trimesters is very limited. 
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly increased risk for spontaneous abortion. The 
risk of spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to interferon beta cannot adequately be 
evaluated by means of the currently available data, but the data suggest no increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Extavia may be considered during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon beta-1b into breast milk, together with the 
chemical / physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests that levels of interferon beta-1b 
excreted in human milk are negligible. No harmful effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant are 
anticipated. 
Extavia can be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No investigations on fertility have been conducted (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
Adverse events related to the central nervous system associated with the use of Extavia might 
influence the ability to drive and use machines in susceptible patients. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
At the beginning of treatment adverse reactions are common but in general they subside with further 
treatment. The most frequently observed adverse reactions are a flu-like symptom complex (fever, 
chills, arthralgia, malaise, sweating, headache, or myalgia), which is mainly due to the 
pharmacological effects of the medicinal product, and injection site reactions. Injection site reactions 
occurred frequently after administration of Extavia. Redness, swelling, discolouration, inflammation, 
pain, hypersensitivity, infection, necrosis and non-specific reactions were significantly associated with 
250 microgram (8.0 million IU) Extavia treatment. 
The most serious adverse reactions reported include thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and 
haemolytic anaemia (HA). 
Generally, dose titration is recommended at the start of treatment in order to increase tolerability to 
Extavia (see section 4.2). Flu-like symptoms may also be reduced by administration of non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medicinal products. The incidence of injection site reactions may be reduced by the 
use of an auto-injector. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunostimulants, interferons, ATC code: L03AB08 
Interferons belong to the family of cytokines, which are naturally occurring proteins. Interferons have 
molecular weights ranging from 15,000 to 21,000 Daltons. Three major classes of interferons have 
been identified: alpha, beta, and gamma. Interferon alpha, interferon beta, and interferon gamma have 
overlapping yet distinct biological activities. The activities of interferon beta-1b are species-restricted 
and therefore, the most pertinent pharmacological information on interferon beta-1b is derived from 
studies of human cells in culture or human in vivo studies. 
Mechanism of action 
Interferon beta-1b has been shown to possess both antiviral and immunoregulatory activity. The 
mechanisms by which interferon beta-1b exerts its actions in multiple sclerosis are not clearly 
understood. However, it is known that the biological response-modifying properties of interferon 
beta-1b are mediated through its interactions with specific cell receptors found on the surface of 
human cells. The binding of interferon beta-1b to these receptors induces the expression of a number 
of gene products that are believed to be the mediators of the biological actions of interferon beta-1b. A 
number of these products have been measured in the serum and cellular fractions of blood collected 
from patients treated with interferon beta-1b. Interferon beta-1b both decreases the binding affinity 
and enhances the internalisation and degradation of the interferon-gamma receptor. Interferon beta-1b 
also enhances the suppressor activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
No separate investigations were performed regarding the influence of Extavia on the cardiovascular 
system, respiratory system and the function of endocrine organs. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS) 
One controlled clinical trial was performed with Extavia in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis and able to walk unaided (baseline EDSS 0 to 5.5). In patients receiving Extavia there was a 
reduction in the frequency (30%) and severity of clinical relapses and in the number of hospitalisations 
due to disease. Furthermore, there was a prolongation of the relapse-free interval. There is no evidence 
of an effect of Extavia on the duration of relapses or on symptoms in between relapses, and no 
significant effect was seen on the progression of the disease in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. 
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS) 
Two controlled clinical trials were performed with Extavia involving a total of 1,657 patients with 
secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (baseline EDSS 3 to 6.5, i.e. patients were able to walk). 
Patients with mild disease and those unable to walk were not studied. The two studies showed 
inconsistent results for the primary endpoint time to confirmed progression, representing delay of 
disability progression: 
One of the two studies demonstrated a statistically significant delay in the time to disability 
progression (Hazard Ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (0.55, 0.86), p=0.0010, corresponding to a 
31% risk reduction due to Extavia) and in the time to becoming wheelchair-bound (Hazard Ratio = 
0.61, 95% confidence interval (0.44, 0.85), p=0.0036, corresponding to a 39% risk reduction due to 
Extavia) in patients who received Extavia. This effect continued over the observation period of up to 
33 months. The treatment effect occurred in patients at all levels of disability investigated and 
independent of relapse activity. 
In the second trial of Extavia in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, no delay in the time to 
disability progression was observed. There is evidence that the patients included in this study had 
overall less active disease than in the other study in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In retrospective meta-analyses including the data of both studies, a statistically significant overall 
treatment effect was found (p=0.0076; 8.0 million IU Extavia versus all placebo patients). 
Retrospective analyses in subgroups showed that a treatment effect on disability progression is most 
likely in patients with active disease before treatment commences (Hazard Ratio 0.72, 95% confidence 
interval (0.59, 0.88), p=0.0011, corresponding to a 28% risk reduction due to Extavia in patients with 
relapses or pronounced EDSS progression, 8.0 million IU Extavia versus all placebo patients). From 
these retrospective subgroup analyses there was evidence to suggest that relapses as well as 
pronounced EDSS progression (EDSS >1 point or >0.5 point for EDSS >=6 in the previous two years) 
can help to identify patients with active disease. 
In both trials there was a reduction (30%) in frequency of clinical relapses in patients with secondary 
progressive multiple sclerosis patients receiving Extavia. There is no evidence of Extavia having an 
effect on the duration of relapses. 
Single clinical event suggestive of multiple sclerosis 
One controlled clinical trial with Extavia was performed in patients with a single clinical event and 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features suggestive of multiple sclerosis (at least two clinically 
silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI). Patients with monofocal or multifocal onset of the disease 
were included (i.e. patients with clinical evidence of a single or at least two lesions, respectively, of 
the central nervous system). Any disease other than multiple sclerosis that could better explain signs 
and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded. This study consisted of two phases, a placebo-
controlled phase followed by a pre-planned follow-up phase. The placebo-controlled phase lasted for 
2 years or until the patient developed clinically definite multiple scleroiss (CDMS), whichever came 
first. After the placebo-controlled phase, patients entered a pre-planned follow-up phase with Extavia 
to evaluate the effects of immediate versus delayed start of Extavia treatment, comparing patients 
initially randomised to Extavia (“immediate treatment group”) or to placebo (“delayed treatment 
group”). Patients and investigators remained blinded to the initial treatment allocation. 
In the placebo-controlled phase, Extavia delayed the progression from the first clinical event to 
clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
manner, corresponding to a risk reduction of 47% (Hazard Ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval 
(0.39, 0.73), p<0.0001). Within the study period of two years, CDMS occurred in 45% of the placebo 
group compared to 28% of the Extavia group (Kaplan-Meier estimates). Extavia prolonged the time to 
CDMS by 363 days, from 255 days in the placebo group to 618 days in the Extavia group (based on 
the 25th percentiles). This treatment effect was still evident after the additional year of follow-up at 
which stage the risk reduction was 41% (Hazard Ratio = 0.59, 95% confidence interval (0.42, 0.83), 
p=0.0011). Within the study period of three years, CDMS occurred in 51% of the delayed treatment 
group compared to 37% of the immediate treatment group (Kaplan-Meier estimates). The persistence 
of the treatment effect was observed although the majority of patients from the placebo-group was 
treated with Extavia in the third year of the study. 
The robustness of the treatment effect was also shown by the delay of progression to multiple sclerosis 
according to the McDonald criteria. In two years, the risk was 85% in the placebo group and 69% in 
the Extavia group (Hazard Ratio = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (0.46, 0.71), p<0.00001). 
After 3 years, a pre-planned interim analysis showed EDSS progression (confirmed increase in EDSS 
of greater than or equal to 1.0 compared to baseline) occurred in 24% of the patients in the delayed 
treatment group compared to 16% in the immediate treatment group [Hazard Ratio = 0.6, 95% 
confidence interval (0.39, 0.92), p=0.022]. There is no evidence for benefit in terms of confirmed 
disability progression in the majority of patients receiving “immediate” treatment. Follow-up of 
patients is continuing in order to provide additional data. No benefit, attributable to Extavia, in quality 
of life (as measured by FAMS – Functional Assessment of MS: Treatment Outcomes Index) was seen. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup analyses according to baseline factors demonstrated evidence of efficacy in all subgroups 
evaluated. Significant effects were also obtained in patients with less disseminated and less active 
disease at the time of the first event. The risk for progression to CDMS within two years in patients 
with monofocal onset was 47% for placebo and 24% for Extavia, without gadolinium (Gd-) 
enhancement 41% and 20%, with less than 9 T2 lesions 39% and 18%. Further subgroup analyses 
indicated a high risk for progression to CDMS within 2 years in monofocal patients with at least 9 T2-
lesions (55% risk for placebo, 26% for Extavia) or Gd-enhancement (63% versus 33%). In multifocal 
patients, the risk for CDMS was independent from MRI findings at baseline, indicating a high risk for 
CDMS because of the dissemination of the disease based on clinical findings. However, the long-term 
impact of early treatment with Extavia is unknown even in these high risk subgroups as this study was 
mainly designed to assess the time to CDMS rather than the long-term evolution of the disease. 
Furthermore, for the time being there is no well established definition of a high risk patient, although a 
more conservative approach is to accept at least nine T2 hyperintense lesions on the initial scan and at 
least one new T2 or one new Gd-enhancing lesion on a follow-up scan taken at least 1 month after the 
initial scan. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified as high risk. 
Therapy with Extavia was well accepted in the study of patients with a single clinical event as 
indicated by a high rate of trial completion (92.8% in the Extavia group). To increase tolerability of 
Extavia in the study of patients with a first clinical event, a dose titration was applied and non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products were administered at start of therapy. Moreover, an 
autoinjector was used by the majority of patients throughout the study. 
RR-MS, SP-MS and single clinical event suggestive of MS 
In all multiple sclerosis studies Extavia was effective in reducing disease activity (acute inflammation 
in the central nervous system and permanent tissue alterations) as measured by magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). The relation of multiple sclerosis disease activity as measured by MRI and clinical 
outcome is currently not fully understood. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Extavia serum levels were followed in patients and volunteers by means of a bioassay that was not 
completely specific. Maximum serum levels of about 40 IU/ml were found 1-8 hours after 
subcutaneous injection of 500 microgram (16.0 million IU) interferon beta-1b. From various studies 
mean clearance rates and half-lives of disposition phases from serum were estimated to be at most 
30 ml·min-1·kg-1 and 5 hours, respectively. 
Administration of Extavia injections every other day does not lead to serum level increase, and the 
pharmacokinetics do not seem to change during therapy. 
The absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously administered interferon beta-1b was approximately 
50%. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No acute toxicity studies have been performed. As rodents do not react to human interferon beta, 
repeated dose studies were carried out with rhesus monkeys. Transitory hyperthermia was observed, as 
well as a significant rise in lymphocytes and a significant decrease in thrombocytes and segmented 
neutrophils. 
No long-term studies have been conducted. Reproduction studies with rhesus monkeys revealed 
maternal toxicity and an increased rate of abortion, resulting in prenatal mortality. No malformations 
have been observed in the surviving animals. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No investigations on fertility have been conducted. No influence on the monkey oestrous cycle has 
been observed. Experience with other interferons suggest a potential for impairment of male and 
female fertility. 
In one single genotoxicity study (Ames test), no mutagenic effect has been observed. Carcinogenicity 
studies have not been performed. An in vitro cell transformation test gave no indication of tumorigenic 
potential.

1.  What Extavia is and what it is used for 
What Extavia is 
Extavia is a type of medicine known as interferon used to treat multiple sclerosis. Interferons are 
proteins produced by the body that help it fight against attacks on the immune system such as viral 
infections. 
How Extavia works 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), 
particularly the functioning of the brain and spinal cord. In MS, inflammation destroys the protective 
sheath (called myelin) around the nerves of the CNS and stops the nerves from working properly. This 
is called demyelination. 
The exact cause of MS is unknown. An abnormal response by the body’s immune system is thought to 
play an important part in the process which damages the CNS. 
The damage to the CNS can occur within an MS attack (relapse). It can cause temporary disability, 
such as difficulty walking. Symptoms may disappear completely or partly. 
Interferon beta-1b has been shown to change the response of the immune system and to help to reduce 
disease activity. 
How Extavia helps fight your disease 
Single clinical event indicating a high risk of developing multiple sclerosis: Extavia has been 
shown to delay progression to definite multiple sclerosis. 
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: People with relapsing-remitting MS have occasional attacks 
or relapses during which symptoms become noticeably worse. Extavia has been shown to cut down the 
number of attacks and make them less severe. It reduces the number of hospital stays due to the 
disease and prolongs the time without relapses. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: In some cases people with relapsing-remitting MS find 
that their symptoms increase and they progress to another form of MS called secondary progressive 
MS. With this, people find themselves becoming increasingly impaired, whether or not they have 
relapses. Extavia can reduce the number and severity of the attacks, and slow the progression of 
disability. 
What Extavia is used for 
Extavia is for use in patients  
►  who have experienced for the first time symptoms which indicate a high risk of developing 
multiple sclerosis. Your doctor will rule out any other reasons which could explain these 
symptoms before you are treated. 
►  who suffer from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with at least two relapses within 
the last two years. 
►  who suffer from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with active disease shown by 
relapses. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Extavia 
Do not use Extavia 
- 
if you are allergic to natural or recombinant interferon beta, human albumin or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you currently suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts (see “Warnings and 
precautions” and section 4, “Possible side effects”). 
if you have a severe liver disease (see “Warnings and precautions”, “Other medicines and 
Extavia” and section 4, “Possible side effects”). 
- 
- 
►  Tell your doctor, if any of the above applies to you. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Extavia: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If you have monoclonal gammopathy. This is a disorder of the immune system where an 
abnormal protein is found in the blood. Problems with your small blood vessels (capillaries) 
may develop (systemic capillary leak syndrome) when using medicines like Extavia. This can 
lead to shock (collapse) and even be fatal. 
If you have had depression or are depressed or previously had thoughts of suicide. Your 
doctor will closely monitor you during treatment. If your depression and/or suicidal thoughts are 
severe, you will not be prescribed Extavia (see also “Do not use Extavia”). 
If you have ever had seizures or if you are taking medicines to treat epilepsy (anti-
epileptics), you doctor will monitor your treatment carefully (see also “Other medicines and 
Extavia” and section 4, “Possible side effects”). 
If you have severe kidney problems, your doctor may monitor your kidney function during 
treatment. 
If you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. The tip cap of the pre-filled syringe 
contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. Therefore, the tip cap may contain natural rubber 
latex. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor also needs to know the following whilst you are using Extavia: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If you experience symptoms such as itching all over your body, swelling of your face 
and/or your tongue or sudden shortness of breath. These may be symptoms of a serious 
allergic reaction, which may become life threatening. 
If you feel noticeably more sad or hopeless than before the treatment with Extavia, or if 
you develop thoughts of suicide. If you become depressed while you are on Extavia, you may 
need special treatment and your doctor will closely monitor you and may also consider stopping 
your treatment. If you suffer from severe depression and/or suicidal thoughts, you will not be 
treated with Extavia (see also “Do not use Extavia”). 
If you notice any unusual bruising, excessive bleeding after injury or if you seem to be 
catching a lot of infections. These may be symptoms of a fall in your blood cell count or in the 
number of platelets in your blood (cells, which help the blood to clot). You may need extra 
monitoring by your doctor. 
If you experience loss of appetite, tiredness, feeling sick (nausea), repeated vomiting, and 
especially if you notice widespread itching, yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the 
eyes, or easy bruising. These symptoms may suggest problems with your liver. Changes to 
liver function values occurred in patients treated with Extavia during clinical studies. As for 
other beta interferons, severe liver damage, including cases of liver failure, have been reported 
rarely in patients taking Extavia. The most serious were reported in patients taking other 
medicines or who were suffering from diseases that can affect the liver (e.g. alcohol abuse, 
severe infection). 
If you experience symptoms such as irregular heartbeat, swelling such as of the ankles or 
legs, or shortness of breath. This may suggest a disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) 
which has been reported in patients using Extavia. 
If you notice pain in your belly which is radiating to your back, and/or you feel sick or 
have a fever. This may suggest an inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which has been 
reported with Extavia use. This is often associated with an increase in certain blood fats 
(triglycerides). 
► 
Stop using Extavia and tell your doctor immediately if any of these happens to you. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other things to consider when using Extavia: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
You will need blood tests to determine your blood cell count, blood chemistry and your liver 
enzymes. These will be performed before you start using Extavia, regularly after treatment 
with Extavia has been initiated and then periodically during treatment, even if you have no 
particular symptoms. These blood tests will be in addition to the tests which are normally done 
to monitor your MS. 
If you have a heart disease, the flu-like symptoms which often occur at the start of 
treatment may prove stressful to you. Extavia must be used with caution, and your doctor will 
monitor you for worsening of your heart condition, particularly at the start of treatment. Extavia 
itself does not affect the heart directly. 
The functioning of your thyroid gland will be checked regularly or whenever thought 
necessary by your doctor for other reasons. 
Extavia contains human albumin and therefore carries a potential risk for transmission of 
viral diseases. A risk of transmission of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) cannot be ruled out. 
During treatment with Extavia your body may produce substances called neutralising 
antibodies, which may react with Extavia. It is not yet clear whether these neutralising 
antibodies reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. Neutralising antibodies are not produced in 
all patients. Currently it is not possible to predict which patients belong to this group. 
During treatment with Extavia, kidney problems that may reduce your kidney function, 
including scarring (glomerulosclerosis), may occur. Your doctor may perform tests to check 
your kidney function. 
Blood clots in the small blood vessels may occur during your treatment. These blood clots 
could affect your kidneys. This might happen several weeks to several years after starting 
Extavia. Your doctor may want to check your blood pressure, blood (platelet count) and the 
function of your kidneys. 
Pale or yellow skin or dark-coloured urine, possibly accompanied by unusual dizziness, 
tiredness or shortness of breath may occur during your treatment. These may be symptoms 
of a breakdown of red blood cells. This might happen several weeks to several years after 
starting Extavia. Your doctor may perform blood tests. Inform your doctor about other 
medicines that you are taking at the same time as Extavia. 
Injection site reactions 
During Extavia treatment you are likely to experience injection site reactions. Symptoms include 
redness, swelling, change in skin colour, inflammation, pain, and hypersensitivity. Infection around 
the injection site and skin breakdown and tissue damage (necrosis) are reported less frequently. 
Injection site reactions usually become less frequent over time. 
Injection site skin and tissue breakdown can result in scars forming. If this is severe a doctor may have 
to remove foreign matter and dead tissue (debridement) and, less often, skin grafting is required and 
healing may take up to 6 months. 
To reduce the risk of getting injection site reactions, such as an infection or necrosis, you must: 
− 
− 
use a sterile (aseptic) injection technique, 
rotate the injection sites with each injection (see Annex Self-Injection procedure). 
Injection site reactions may occur less frequently if you use an auto-injector device and by rotating 
injection sites. Your doctor or nurse can tell you more about this. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you experience any break in the skin, associated with swelling or fluid leaking out from the 
injection site: 
► 
Stop injecting Extavia and talk to your doctor. 
► 
► 
If you have only one sore injection site (lesion) and the tissue damage (necrosis) is not too 
extensive you may continue using Extavia. 
If you have more than one sore injection sites (multiple lesions) you must stop using Extavia 
until your skin has healed. 
Your doctor will regularly check the way you inject yourself, particularly if you have experienced 
injection site reactions. 
Children and adolescents 
There have been no formal clinical trials undertaken in children or adolescents. 
However, there are some data available in adolescents aged from 12 to 17 years which suggest that the 
safety of Extavia in this group is the same as in adults. Extavia should not be used in children under 
12 years of age as there is no information available for this age group. 
Other medicines and Extavia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
No formal interaction studies have been carried out to find out whether Extavia affects other 
medicines or is affected by them. 
Using Extavia with other medicines that modify the immune system response is not recommended, 
except anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids or the adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH). 
Extavia should be used with caution with: 
- 
medicines which need a certain liver enzyme system (known as cytochrome P450 system) for 
their removal from the body, for example medicines used to treat epilepsy (such as phenytoin). 
medicines which affect the production of blood cells. 
- 
Extavia with food and drink 
Extavia is injected under the skin so any food or drink you consume is not thought to have any effect 
on Extavia. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
No harmful effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Extavia can be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Extavia may cause side effects in the central nervous system (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). If 
you are especially sensitive, this might influence your ability to drive or use machines. 
Extavia contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, i.e. essentially 'sodium-
free'. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use Extavia 
Treatment with Extavia should be started under the supervision of a doctor who is experienced in the 
treatment of multiple sclerosis. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is every other day (once every two days), 1.0 ml of the prepared Extavia 
solution (see Annex “Self-injection procedure” in the second part of this leaflet) injected under the 
skin (subcutaneously). This equals 250 microgram (8.0 million IU) interferon beta-1b. 
In general, treatment should be started at a low dose of 0.25 ml (62.5 microgram). Your doses will 
then be increased gradually to the full dose of 1.0 ml (250 microgram). 
The dose should be increased at every fourth injection in four steps (0.25 ml, 0.5 ml, 0.75 ml, 1.0 ml). 
Your doctor may decide together with you to change the time intervals for dose increase depending on 
side effects you may experience at the start of treatment. 
Preparing the injection 
Before injection, the Extavia solution has to be prepared from a vial of Extavia powder and 1.2 ml 
of liquid from the pre-filled solvent syringe. This will either be done by your doctor or nurse or by 
yourself after you have been carefully trained. 
Detailed instructions for self-injection of Extavia under the skin are provided in the Annex at the 
back of this leaflet. These instructions also tell you how to prepare the Extavia solution for injection. 
The injection site must be changed regularly. See section 2 “Warnings and precautions” and follow 
the instructions under “Rotating injection sites” in the Annex at the back of this leaflet. 
Duration of treatment 
At present it is not known how long treatment with Extavia should last. The length of treatment will 
be decided by your doctor together with you. 
If you use more Extavia than you should 
Giving many times the dose of Extavia recommended for the treatment of multiple sclerosis has not 
led to life-threatening situations. 
►  Talk to your doctor if you inject too much Extavia or injected too often. 
If you forget to use Extavia 
If you have forgotten to give yourself an injection at the right time do it as soon as you remember and 
then follow on with the next one 48 hours later. 
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten individual dose. 
If you stop using Extavia 
Talk to your doctor if you stop or wish to stop treatment. Stopping Extavia is not known to cause acute 
withdrawal symptoms. 
► 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.

Annex: SELF-INJECTION PROCEDURE 
The following instructions and pictures explain how to prepare Extavia for injection and how to inject 
Extavia yourself. Please read the instructions carefully and follow them step by step. Your doctor or 
nurse will help you to learn the process of self-administration. Do not attempt to inject yourself until 
you are sure that you understand how to prepare the injection solution and give the injection to 
yourself. 
PART I: STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS 
The instructions include the following main steps: 
A)  General advice 
B)  Getting ready to inject 
C)  Reconstituting and drawing up the solution for injection, step by step 
D)  Making the injection manually (to make an injection with the ExtaviPro 30G auto-
injector, refer to the instructions for use provided with the auto-injector) 
A)  General advice 
• 
Getting off to a good start! 
You will find that within a few weeks your treatment will become a natural part of your routine. As 
you get started, you may find the following tips helpful: 
- 
- 
- 
Set up a permanent storage area in a convenient location out of the sight and reach of children 
so that your Extavia and other supplies are always easy to find. 
For details on storage conditions see section 5 of the leaflet, “How to store Extavia”. 
Try to give yourself the injection at the same time each day. This makes it easier to remember 
and easier to plan a block of time when you will not be interrupted. 
Please refer to section 3 of the leaflet, “How to use Extavia”, for further details on how to use 
Extavia. 
Prepare each dose only when you are ready for an injection. After mixing Extavia, you should 
administer the injection immediately (if this medicine is not used immediately, see section 5 of 
the leaflet, “How to store Extavia”). 
• 
Important tips to keep in mind 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Be consistent - use this medicine as described in section 3 of the leaflet, “How to use Extavia”. 
Always double-check your dosage. 
Keep your syringes and syringe disposal unit out of the sight and reach of children; lock the 
supplies away if possible. 
Never re-use syringes or needles. 
Always use a sterile (aseptic) technique as described in here. 
Always place the used syringes in the proper disposal unit.

B)  Getting ready to inject 
• 
Choosing an injection site 
Before preparing your injection, decide where you are going to inject. You should inject this medicine 
into the fatty layer between the skin and muscle (that is, subcutaneously, about 8 mm to 12 mm under 
the skin). The best places for injections are where the skin is loose and soft, and away from joints, 
nerves and bones, for example the abdomen, arm, thigh or buttocks. 
Important: 
The tip cap of the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. Therefore, the tip cap 
may contain natural rubber latex. If you are allergic to latex, talk to your doctor before using Extavia. 
Do not use any area where you can feel lumps, bumps, firm knots, pain or an area that is discoloured, 
indented, scabbed, or where the skin is broken. Talk to your doctor or nurse about these or any other 
unusual conditions you may find. 
You should rotate the injection site at every injection. If some areas are too difficult for you to reach, 
you may need a family member or friend to help you with these injections. Follow the sequence 
described in the schedule at the end of the Annex (see Part II “Rotating injection sites”) and you will 
come back to your first injection site area after 8 injections (16 days). This will give each injection site 
a chance to fully recover before receiving another injection. 
Please refer to the rotation schedule at the end of this Annex to learn how to choose an injection site. 
An example of a medication record is also included (see Annex Part III). This should give you an idea 
of how you can keep track of your injection sites and dates. 
•  Medicine 
You will need the medicine: 
• 
• 
1 Extavia vial (with powder for solution for injection) 
1 pre-filled syringe of solvent for Extavia (sodium chloride solution) 
To reconstitute and inject your medicine you will need to use an ExtaviPro 30G application kit 
(supplied separately to your medicine), which contains the following components and instructions on 
how to use them: 
• 
• 
• 
Vial adapters for use when reconstituting your medicine 
30-gauge needles for injecting your medicine 
Alcohol swabs 
You will also need a disposal unit for used syringes and needles. 
The 30-gauge needles provided with the application kit for the administration of this medicine can be 
used either for manual injection OR with an ExtaviPro 30G auto-injector. 
For skin disinfection use an appropriate disinfectant recommended by your pharmacist.

C)  Reconstituting and drawing up the solution for injection, step by step 
1 - Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before beginning 
this process. 
2 - Remove the flip off cap from the Extavia vial. It is best to use your 
thumb rather than your nail, as your nail could break. Put the vial on 
the table. 
3 - Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab, moving the swab in 
one direction only. Leave the swab on top of the vial. 
4 - Peel back and remove the cover from the vial adapter packaging. 
Do not remove the vial adapter from its packaging. 
5 - Remove the swab from the top of the vial. 
Use the packaging to handle the vial adapter. Attach it to the vial by 
pushing down until the vial adapter penetrates and locks around the 
top of the vial. 
6 - Holding the edges securely, remove and discard the packaging 
ensuring the vial adapter remains on the vial. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 - Take out the pre-filled solvent syringe from its package. Snap off 
and discard the tip of the syringe. 
Note: Be careful not to touch the exposed end of the syringe. Do not 
push the plunger. 
8 - Holding the vial and adapter securely, screw the syringe fully onto 
the vial adapter. 
This forms the syringe-vial assembly. 
9 - Hold the syringe-vial assembly at a slight angle. Push the plunger 
down slowly so that the liquid runs down the inside of the vial. 
Transfer all the solvent to the vial. 
Note: Do not shake the vial as this may cause excessive foaming. 
10 - Hold the vial between your thumb and fingers. Swirl the syringe-
vial assembly gently until the powder is completely dissolved. 
Note: Do not shake the vial. 
11 - Examine the solution carefully. It should be clear and contain no 
particles. 
Note: If the solution is discoloured or contains particles, discard it and 
start again with a new syringe and vial from your package. 
If excessive foaming is present – which can happen if the vial is 
shaken or swirled too vigorously – let the vial sit undisturbed until the 
foam settles. 
12 - Ensure the plunger stays fully pushed in before proceeding to the 
next step, as it may have moved. 
13 - Turn the syringe-vial-assembly so that the vial is at the top. 
Slowly pull the plunger back to draw all of the solution into the 
syringe. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 - Remove any excess air bubbles by gently tapping the syringe. 
Push the plunger to the 1 ml mark (or to the volume prescribed by 
your doctor). 
Note: It may be necessary to adjust the plunger position back and forth 
a few times to ensure the excess air bubbles are gone and there is 1 ml 
of solution in the syringe. 
15 - Unscrew the syringe, leaving the vial adapter on the vial. 
Dispose of the vial and the remaining unused portion of the solution 
into the disposal unit. 
16 - Take the needle out of its wrapping and screw it firmly onto the 
top of the syringe. 
17 - Leave the needle cap on. You are now ready to manually inject 
yourself or to use the ExtaviPro 30G auto-injector for the 
administration of Extavia. 
Storage after reconstitution 
If, for some reason, you are not able to inject Extavia immediately, you can refrigerate the 
reconstituted solution for up to 3 hours before using it. Do not freeze the solution, and do not wait 
longer than 3 hours to inject it. If more than 3 hours pass, discard the medicine and prepare a 
new injection. When you use the solution, warm it up by holding the syringe or vial in your hands 
before injecting to avoid pain. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
D) 
Making the injection manually (to make an injection with the ExtaviPro 30G auto-
injector, refer to the instructions for use provided with the auto-injector) 
1 - Choose a site for the injection (refer to the section “Choosing an 
injection site” and the diagrams at the end of this leaflet) and make a 
note of it in your medication record. 
2 - Use an alcohol swab to wipe the skin at the injection site. Let the 
skin air-dry. Throw the swab away. 
3 - Remove the cap from the needle by pulling and not twisting it. 
4 - Where possible gently pinch the skin together around the disinfected 
injection site (to raise it up a little). 
5 - Holding the syringe like a pencil or a dart, push the needle straight 
into the skin at a 90˚ angle with a quick, firm motion. 
6 - Inject the medicine (by pushing the plunger slowly and steadily all 
the way in until the syringe is empty). 
7 - Discard the syringe in the disposal unit.

PART II:  ROTATING INJECTION SITES 
You need to choose a new site for each injection to allow the area time to recover and help prevent 
infection. Advice on which areas to choose is given in the first part of this Annex. It is a good idea to 
know where you plan to inject before you prepare your syringe. The schedule shown in the diagram 
below will help you to vary the sites appropriately. For example, give the first injection into the right 
side of the abdomen, choose the left side for the second injection, then move to the right thigh for the 
third, and so on through the diagram until all suitable areas of the body have been used. Keep a record 
of where and when you last gave yourself an injection. One way to do that is to note the injection site 
on the enclosed medication record card. 
By following this schedule, you will come back to your first area (e.g. the right side of the abdomen) 
after 8 injections (16 days). This is called a Rotation Cycle. On our example schedule each area is split 
again into 6 injection sites (which adds up to 48 injection sites altogether), left and right: upper, 
middle and lower part of each area. If you come back to an area after one Rotation Cycle choose the 
most distant injection site within this area. If an area becomes sore, talk to your doctor or nurse about 
choosing other injection sites. 
Rotation schedule 
To help you rotate the injection sites appropriately, we recommend that you keep a record of the date 
and location of your injection. You can use the following rotation schedule. 
Work through each rotation cycle in turn. Each cycle will be 8 injections (16 days), given in area 1 
through to area 8 in turn. By following this sequence, you will give each area a chance to recover 
before receiving another injection. 
Rotation Cycle 1: 
Rotation Cycle 2: 
Rotation Cycle 3: 
Rotation Cycle 4 
Rotation Cycle 5: 
Rotation Cycle 6: 
Upper left section of each area 
Lower right section of each area 
Middle left section of each area 
Upper right section of each area 
Lower left section of each area 
Middle right section of each area

PART III:  EXTAVIA Medication record 
Instructions for keeping track of your injection sites and dates 
− 
− 
− 
Start with your first injection (or your last injection if you are not a new Extavia user). 
Select an injection site. If you have already been using Extavia start with the area that has not 
been used during the last rotation cycle (i.e. the past 16 days). 
After your injection, fill in the used injection site and date in the table in your injection record 
(see the example: Keeping track of your injection sites and dates).

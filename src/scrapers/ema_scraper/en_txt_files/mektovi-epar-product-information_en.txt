CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Binimetinib treatment in combination with encorafenib should be initiated and supervised under the 
responsibility of a physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of binimetinib is 45 mg (three 15 mg tablets) twice daily, corresponding to a 
total daily dose of 90 mg approximately 12 hours apart. 
Dose modification 
The management of adverse reactions may require dose reduction, temporary interruption or treatment 
discontinuation (see below, Table 1 and Table 2).  
For patients receiving 45 mg binimetinib twice daily, the recommended reduced dose of binimetinib is 
30 mg twice daily. Dose reduction below 30 mg twice daily is not recommended. Therapy should be 
discontinued if the patient is not able to tolerate 30 mg orally twice daily. 
If the adverse reaction that resulted in a dose reduction is under effective management, dose 
re-escalation to 45 mg twice daily may be considered. Dose re-escalation to 45 mg twice daily is not 
recommended if the dose reduction is due to left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) or any Grade 4 toxicity. 
Dose modifications recommendations in case of adverse reactions are presented below and in 
Tables 1 and 2.

If treatment-related toxicities occur when binimetinib is used in combination with encorafenib, then 
both treatments should be simultaneously dose reduced, interrupted or discontinued. Exceptions where 
dose reductions are necessary for encorafenib only (adverse reactions primarily related to encorafenib) 
are: palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), uveitis including iritis and iridocyclitis and 
QTc prolongation. 
If one of these toxicities occurs, see section 4.2 of encorafenib Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) for dose modification instructions for encorafenib. 
If binimetinib is temporarily interrupted, encorafenib should be reduced to 300 mg once daily during 
the time of binimetinib dose interruption (see Tables 1 and 2) as encorafenib is not well-tolerated at 
the dose of 450 mg as a single agent. If binimetinib is permanently discontinued, encorafenib should 
be discontinued.  
If encorafenib is temporarily interrupted (see section 4.2 of encorafenib SmPC), binimetinib should be 
interrupted. If encorafenib is permanently discontinued, then binimetinib should be discontinued.  
For information on the posology and recommended dose modifications of encorafenib, see section 4.2 
of encorafenib SmPC.

reactions 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment should continue until the patient no longer derives benefit or the development of 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Missed doses 
If a dose of binimetinib is missed, it should not be taken if it is less than 6 hours until the next dose is 
due. 
Vomiting 
In case of vomiting after administration of binimetinib, the patient should not re-take the dose and 
should take the next scheduled dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is required for patients aged 65 years and older (see section 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A).  
As encorafenib is not recommended in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) or severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh C), administration of binimetinib is not recommended in these patients. (see 
section 4.2 of encorafenib SmPC).  
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of binimetinib in children and adolescents have not yet been established. No 
data are available.

. 
Method of administration  
Mektovi is for oral use. 
The tablets are to be swallowed whole with water. They may be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Binimetinib is to be given in combination with encorafenib. For additional information on warnings 
and precautions associated with encorafenib treatment, see section 4.4 of encorafenib SmPC. 
BRAF mutation testing 
Before taking binimetinib in combination with encorafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation 
confirmed by validated test. The efficacy and safety of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib 
have been established only in patients with tumours expressing BRAF V600E and V600K mutations. 
Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib should not be used in patients with wild type BRAF 
malignant melanoma. 
Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib in patients who have progressed on a BRAF inhibitor 
There are limited data for use of the combination of binimetinib with encorafenib in patients who have 
progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor given for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
with BRAF V600 mutation. These data show that the efficacy of the combination would be lower in 
these patients. 
Binimetinib in combination with encorafenib in patients with brain metastases 
There are limited efficacy data with the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib in patients with a 
BRAF V600 mutant melanoma which have metastasised to the brain (see section 5.1). 
Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) 
LVD defined as symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction can occur when 
binimetinib is administered.  
It is recommended that LVEF is assessed by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan 
before initiation of binimetinib, 1 month after initiation, and then at approximately 3-month intervals 
or more frequently as clinically indicated, while on treatment. The occurrence of LVEF decrease can 
be managed with treatment interruption, dose reduction or with treatment discontinuation (see 
section 4.2).  
The safety of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib has not been established in patients with a 
baseline LVEF that is either below 50 % or below the institutional LLN. Therefore, in these patients, 
binimetinib should be used with caution and for any symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, 
Grade 3-4 LVEF, or absolute decrease of LVEF from baseline of ≥ 10 %, binimetinib should be 
discontinued and LVEF should be evaluated every 2 weeks until recovery. 
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhages, including major haemorrhagic events, can occur when binimetinib is administered (see 
section 4.8). The risk of haemorrhage may be increased with concomitant use of anticoagulant and 
antiplatelet therapy. The occurrence of Grade ≥ 3 haemorrhagic events should be managed with dose 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interruption, reduction or treatment discontinuation (see Table 2 in section 4.2) and as clinically 
indicated. 
Ocular toxicities 
Ocular toxicities including RPED and RVO can occur when binimetinib is administered. Uveitis 
including iridocyclitis and iritis have been reported in patients treated with binimetinib in combination 
with encorafenib (see section 4.8). 
Binimetinib is not recommended in patients with a history of RVO. The safety of binimetinib has not 
been established in patients with predisposing factors for RVO including uncontrolled glaucoma, 
ocular hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or a history of hyperviscosity or 
hypercoagulability syndromes. Therefore, binimetinib should be used with caution in these patients.  
Patients should be assessed at each visit for symptoms of new or worsening visual disturbances. If 
symptoms of new or worsening visual disturbances including diminished central vision, blurred vision 
or loss of vision are identified, a prompt ophthalmologic examination is recommended.  
The occurrence of symptomatic RPED can be managed with treatment interruption, dose reduction or 
with treatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in section 4.2). 
Binimetinib should be permanently discontinued with the occurrence of RVO (see Table 1 in 
section 4.2). 
If during treatment patient develops uveitis, see section 4.2 of encorafenib SmPC for guidance.  
CK elevation and rhabdomyolysis 
Asymptomatic CK elevations are seen in patients treated with binimetinib (see section 4.8), and, 
rhabdomyolysis was uncommonly reported. Special attention should be paid to patients with 
neuromuscular conditions associated with CK elevation and rhabdomyolysis. 
CK and creatinine levels should be monitored monthly during the first 6 months of treatment and as 
clinically indicated. The patient should be advised to maintain an adequate fluid intake during 
treatment. Depending on the severity of symptoms, degree of CK elevation or creatinine elevation, 
dose reduction, dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of binimetinib may be required (see 
Table 1 in section 4.2). 
Hypertension 
Hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, can occur with the use of binimetinib. Blood 
pressure should be measured at baseline and monitored during treatment, with control of hypertension 
by standard therapy as appropriate. In case of severe hypertension, temporary interruption of 
binimetinib is recommended until hypertension is controlled (see Table 2 in section 4.2). 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
VTE can occur when binimetinib is administered (see section 4.8). Binimetinib should be used with 
caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of VTE.  
If during treatment patient develops VTE or pulmonary embolism, it should be managed with dose 
interruption, reduction or treatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in section 4.2). 
Pneumonitis/Interstitial lung disease 
Pneumonitis/ILD can occur with binimetinib. Treatment with binimetinib should be withheld in 
patients with suspected pneumonitis or ILD, including patients presenting new or progressive 
pulmonary symptoms or findings such as cough, dyspnoea, hypoxia, reticular opacities or pulmonary 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infiltrates (see Table 1 in section 4.2). Binimetinib should be permanently discontinued in patients 
diagnosed with treatment related pneumonitis or ILD.  
New primary malignancies 
New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with 
BRAF inhibitors and can occur when binimetinib is administered in combination with encorafenib 
(see section 4.8). 
Cutaneous malignancies 
Cutaneous malignancies such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) including 
kerathoacanthoma has been observed in patients treated with binimetinib when used in combination 
with encorafenib. 
Dermatologic evaluations should be performed prior to initiation of therapy with binimetinib in 
combination with encorafenib, every 2 months while on therapy and for up to 6 months following 
discontinuation of the combination. Suspicious skin lesions should be managed with dermatological 
excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Patients should be instructed to immediately inform their 
physicians if new skin lesions develop. Binimetinib and encorafenib should be continued without any 
dose modifications.  
Non-cutaneous malignancies 
Based on its mechanism of action, encorafenib may promote malignancies associated with activation 
of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Patients receiving binimetinib in combination with 
encorafenib should undergo a head and neck examination, chest/abdomen computerised tomography 
(CT) scan, anal and pelvic examinations (for women) and complete blood cell counts prior to 
initiation, during and at the end of treatment as clinically appropriate. 
Permanent discontinuation of binimetinib and encorafenib should be considered in patients who 
develops RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Benefits and risks should be carefully 
considered before administering binimetinib in combination with encorafenib to patients with a prior 
or concurrent cancer associated with RAS mutation. 
Liver laboratory abnormalities 
Liver laboratory abnormalities including AST and ALT elevations can occur with binimetinib (see 
section 4.8). Liver laboratory values should be monitored before initiation of binimetinib and 
encorafenib and at least monthly during the 6 first months of treatment, and then as clinically 
indicated. Liver laboratory abnormalities should be managed with dose interruption, reduction or 
treatment discontinuation (see Table 1 in section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Liver metabolism mainly via glucuronidation is the primary route of elimination of binimetinib (see 
section 5.2). As encorafenib is not recommended in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) and severe 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), administration of binimetinib is not recommended in these patients 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Lactose intolerance 
Mektovi contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other medicinal products on binimetinib 
Binimetinib is primarily metabolised through UGT1A1 mediated glucuronidation. The extent of drug 
interactions mediated by UGT1A1 is unlikely to be clinically relevant (see section 5.2); however, as 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this has not been evaluated in a formal clinical study, UGT1A1 inducers (such as rifampicin and 
phenobarbital) and inhibitors (such as indinavir, atazanavir, sorafenib) should be co-administered with 
caution. 
While encorafenib is a relatively potent reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1, no differences in binimetinib 
exposure have been observed clinically when binimetinib is co-administered with encorafenib (see 
section 5.2). 
Inducers of CYP1A2 enzymes (such as carbamazepine and rifampicin) and inducers of Pgp transport 
(such as Saint John's wort or phenytoin) may decrease binimetinib exposure, which could result in a 
decrease of efficacy. 
Effects of binimetinib on other medicinal products 
Binimetinib is a potential inducer of CYP1A2, and caution should be taken when it is used with 
sensitive substrates (such as duloxetine or theophylline). 
Binimetinib is a weak inhibitor of OAT3, and caution should be taken when it is used with sensitive 
substrates (such as pravastatin or ciprofloxacin). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with binimetinib 
and for at least 1 month following the last dose. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of binimetinb in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Binimetinib is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of childbearing potential not using contraception. If binimetinib is used during pregnancy, or if 
the patient becomes pregnant while taking binimetinib, the patient should be informed of the potential 
hazard to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether binimetinib or its metabolite are excreted in human milk. A risk to the breastfed 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue Mektovi therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and 
the benefit of therapy for the mother.   
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect on fertility in humans for binimetinib. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Binimetinib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Visual disturbances have been 
reported in patients treated with binimetinib during clinical studies. Patients should be advised not to 
drive or use machines if they experience visual disturbances or any other adverse reaction that may 
affect their ability to drive and use machines (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of binimetinib (45 mg orally twice daily) in combination with encorafenib (450 mg orally 
once daily) (hereafter referred to as Combo 450) was evaluated in 274 patients with BRAF V600 
mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma, based on two Phase II studies (CMEK162X2110 and 
CLGX818X2109) and one Phase III study (CMEK162B2301, Part 1) (hereafter referred to as the 
pooled Combo 450 population). At the recommended dose (n = 274) in patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma, the most common adverse reactions (> 25 %) occurring in patients treated with 
binimetinib administered with encorafenib were fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, retinal 
detachment, abdominal pain, arthralgia, blood CK increased and myalgia. 
The safety of encorafenib (300 mg orally once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg orally 
twice daily) was evaluated in 257 patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma (hereafter referred to as the Combo 300 population), based on the Phase III study 
(CMEK162B2301, Part 2). The most common adverse reactions (>25%) occurring in patients treated 
with encorafenib 300 mg administered with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea and diarrhoea.

twice daily (Combo 300) in study CMEK162B2301-Part 2, the frequency category was lower 
compared to the pooled Combo 450 population for the following adverse reactions: anemia, peripheral 
12 
 
neuropathy, haemorrhage, hypertension, pruritus (common) and colitis, increased amylase and 
increased lipase (uncommon).

Grade 3 in 1.8 % (5/274) of patients. Most events were reported as retinopathy, retinal detachment, 
subretinal fluid, macular oedema, and chorioretinopathy and led to dose interruptions or dose 
modifications in 4.7 % (13/274) of patients. The median time to onset of the first event of RPED (all 
grades) was 1.5 month (range 0.03 to 17.5 months).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest dose of binimetinib evaluated as single agent in clinical studies was 80 mg administered 
orally twice daily and was associated with ocular (chorioretinopathy) and skin toxicities (dermatitis 
acneiform).  
There is no specific treatment of overdose. If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively 
with appropriate monitoring as necessary.  
Since binimetinib is highly bound to plasma proteins, haemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the 
treatment of overdose with binimetinib.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EE03 
Mechanism of action 
Binimetinib is an ATP-uncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of the kinase activity of mitogen-activated 
extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. In cell free system, binimetinib inhibits 
MEK1 and MEK2 with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)’s in the 12-46 nM. MEK 
proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which 
promotes cellular proliferation. In melanoma and other cancers, this pathway is often activated by 
mutated forms of BRAF which activates MEK. Binimetinib inhibits activation of MEK by BRAF and 
inhibits MEK kinase activity. Binimetinib inhibits growth of BRAF V600 mutant melanoma cell lines 
and demonstrates anti-tumour effects in BRAF V600 mutant melanoma animal models.  
Combination with encorafenib 
Binimetinib and encorafenib (a BRAF inhibitor, see section 5.1 of encorafenib SmPC) both inhibit the 
MAPK pathway resulting in higher anti-tumour activity.   
Additionally, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib prevented the emergence of treatment 
resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in vivo. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
The safety and efficacy of binimetinib in combination with encorafenib were evaluated in a 2-part 
Phase III, randomised (1:1:1) active-controlled, open-label, multicenter study in patients with 
unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 E or K mutant melanoma (Study CMEK162B2301), as 
detected using a BRAF assay. Patients had histologically confirmed cutaneous or unknown primary 
melanoma but those with uveal or mucosal melanoma were excluded. Patients were permitted to 
receive prior adjuvant therapy and one prior line of immunotherapy for unresectable locally advanced 
or metastatic disease. Prior treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors was not allowed.  
Study CMEK162B2301, part 1 
In part 1, patients in the study were randomised to receive binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily plus 
encorafenib 450 mg orally daily (Combo 450, n = 192), encorafenib 300 mg orally daily (hereafter 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
referred to as Enco 300, n = 194), or vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily (hereafter referred to as 
Vem, n = 191). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation 
was stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage (IIIB, IIIC, IVM1a or IVM1b, 
vs IVM1c) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1) and prior 
immunotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease (yes vs no).   
The primary efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) of Combo 450 compared 
with vemurafenib as assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). PFS as assessed by 
investigators (investigator assessment) was a supportive analysis. An additional secondary endpoint 
included PFS of Combo 450 compared with Enco 300. Other secondary efficacy comparisons between 
Combo 450 and either vemurafenib or Enco 300 included overall survival (OS), objective response 
rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR) and disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by BIRC and by 
investigator assessment. 
The median age of patients was 56 years (range 20-89), 58 % were male, 90 % were Caucasian, and 
72 % of patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0. Most patients had metastatic disease 
(95 %) and were Stage IVM1c (64 %); 27 % of patients had elevated baseline serum lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), and 45% of patients had at least 3 organs with tumour involvement at baseline 
and 3.5 % had brain metastases. 27 patients (5 %) had received prior checkpoint inhibitors (anti-
PD1/PDL1 or ipilimumab) (8 patients in Combo 450 arm (4 %); 7 patients in vemurafenib arm (4 %); 
12 patients in Enco 300 arm (6 %) including 22 patients in the metastatic setting (6 patients in Combo 
450 arm; 5 patients in vemurafenib arm; 11 patients in Enco 300 arm) and 5 patients in the adjuvant 
setting (2 patients in Combo 450 arm; 2 patients in vemurafenib arm; 1 patient in Enco 300 arm. 
The median duration of exposure was 11.7 months in patients treated with Combo 450, 7.1 months in 
patients treated with encorafenib 300 mg and 6.2 months in patients treated with vemurafenib. The 
median relative dose intensity (RDI) for Combo 450 was 99.6 % for binimetinib and 100 % for 
encorafenib the median RDI was 86.2 % for Enco 300 and 94.5 % for vemurafenib. 
Part 1 of study CMEK162B2301 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the 
patients treated with Combo 450 compared with patients treated with vemurafenib. Table 4 and 
Figure 1 summarise the PFS and other efficacy results based on central review of the data by a blinded 
independent radiology committee. 
The efficacy results based on investigator assessment were consistent with the independent central 
assessment. Unstratified subgroup analyses demonstrated point estimates in favour of Combo 450, 
including LDH at baseline, ECOG performance status and AJCC stage.

An interim OS analysis of study CMEK162B2301 Part 1, (cut-off date 07 November 2017) 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for Combo 450 compared with 
vemurafenib (see Table 5 and Figure 2).  
A similar proportion of patients in each treatment arm received subsequent treatment with checkpoint 
inhibitors, mainly pembrolizumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab (34.4 % Combo 450 arm, 
36.1 % encorafenib arm, 39.8 % vemurafenib arm).

Quality of Life (QoL) (cut-off date: 19 May 2016) 
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M), the European Organisation for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer’s core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the 
EuroQoL-5 Dimension-5 Level examination (EQ-5D-5L) were used to explore patient-reported 
outcomes (PRO) measures of health-related Quality of Life, functioning, melanoma symptoms, and 
treatment-related adverse reaction. A definitive 10% deterioration in FACT-M and in EORTC 
QLQ-C30 was significantly delayed in patients treated with Combo 450 relative to other treatments. 
The median time to definitive 10 % deterioration in the FACT-M score was not reached in the 
Combo 450 arm and was 22.1 months (95 % CI: 15.2, NE) in the vemurafenib arm with a HR for the 
difference of 0.46 (95 % CI: 0.29, 0.72). An analysis of time to definitive 10 % deterioration in 
EORTC QLQ-C30 score provided with similar results. 
Patients receiving Combo 450 reported no change or a slight improvement in the mean change from 
baseline EQ-5D-5L index score at all visits, whilst patients receiving vemurafenib or encorafenib 
reported decreases at all visits (with statistical significant differences). An evaluation of change over 
time in score yielded the same trend for EORTC QLQ-C30 and at all visit for FACT-M.     
Study CMEK162B2301, part 2 
Part 2 of study CMEK162B2301 was designed to assess the contribution of binimetinib to the 
encorafenib and binimetinib combination. 
The PFS for encorafenib 300 mg orally daily used in combination with binimetinib 45 mg orally twice 
daily (Combo 300, n = 258) was compared to the PFS for Enco 300 (n = 280, including 194 patients 
from Part 1 and 86 patients from Part 2). Enrolment in Part 2 started after all Part 1 patients were 
randomised.  
Preliminary Part 2 data at a cut-off date of 9 November 2016 demonstrated the contribution of 
binimetinib with an improved median PFS estimate of 12.9 months (95 % CI: 10.1, 14.0) for 
Combo 300 compared to 9.2 months (95 % CI: 7.4, 11.0) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2) per independent 
central review (BIRC). Similar results were observed per Investigator assessment.  
The confirmed ORR per BIRC was 65.9 % (95 % CI: 59.8, 71.7) for Combo 300, and 50.4 % (95 % 
CI 44.3, 56.4) for Enco 300 (Parts 1 and 2). Median DOR for confirmed responses per BIRC was 
12.7 months [95% CI: 9.3, 15.1] for Combo 300 and 12.9 months [95 % CI: 8.9, 15.5] for Enco 300. 
The median duration of treatment was longer for Combo 300 vs. Enco 300, 52.1 weeks vs 31.5 weeks. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In the safety analysis of pooled studies of encorafenib 450 mg once daily in combination with 45 mg 
binimetinib twice daily (Combo 450), the incidence of new QTc prolongation > 500 ms was 0.7 % 
(2/268) in the encorafenib 450 mg plus binimetinib group, and 2.5 % (5/203) in the encorafenib single 
agent group. QTc prolongation of > 60 ms compared to pre-treatment values was observed in 4.9 % 
(13/268) patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group, and in 3.4 % (7/204) in the encorafenib 
single agent group (see section 5.1 of encorafenib SmPC). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
binimetinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of binimetinib were studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumours 
and advanced and unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma. After repeat twice-daily dosing 
concomitantly with encorafenib, steady-state conditions for binimetinib were reached within 15 days 
with no major accumulation. The mean (CV %) Cmax,ss was 654 ng/mL (34.7 %) and mean AUCss was 
2.35 ug.h/mL (28.0 %) in combination with encorafenib as estimated by population PK modelling. 
Binimetinib pharmacokinetics have been shown to be approximately dose-linear. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
After oral administration, binimetinib is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 1.5 hours. Following a 
single oral dose of 45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, at least 50 % of the binimetinib dose 
was absorbed. Administration of a single 45 mg dose of binimetinib with a high-fat, high-calorie meal 
decreased the maximum binimetinib concentration (Cmax) by 17 %, while the area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) was unchanged. A drug interaction study in healthy subjects 
indicated that the extent of binimetinib exposure is not altered in the presence of a gastric pH-altering 
agent (rabeprazole). 
Distribution 
Binimetinib is 97.2 % bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. Binimetinib is more distributed in 
plasma than blood. In humans, the blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.718. Following a single oral dose of 
45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, the apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of binimetinib 
is 374 L. 
Biotransformation 
Following a single oral dose of 45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, the primary 
biotransformation pathways of binimetinib observed in humans include glucuronidation, 
N-dealkylation, amide hydrolysis, and loss of ethane-diol from the side chain. The maximum 
contribution of direct glucuronidation to the clearance of binimetinib was estimated to have been 
61.2 %. Following a single oral dose of 45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, approximately 
60 % of the circulating radioactivity AUC in plasma was attributable to binimetinib. In vitro, CYP1A2 
and CYP2C19 catalyse the formation of the active metabolite, which represents less than 20 % of the 
binimetinib exposure clinically. 
Elimination 
Following a single oral dose of 45 mg [14C] binimetinib in healthy subjects, a mean of 62.3 % of the 
radioactivity was eliminated in the feces while 31.4 % was eliminated in the urine. In urine, 6.5 % of 
the radioactivity was excreted as binimetinib. The mean (CV %) apparent clearance (CL/F) of 
binimetinib was 28.2 L/h (17.5 %). The median (range) binimetinib terminal half-life (T1/2) was 8.66 h 
(8.10 to 13.6 h). 
Medicinal product interactions 
Effect of UGT1A1 inducers or inhibitors on binimetinib 
Binimetinib is primarily metabolised through UGT1A1 mediated glucuronidation. In clinical study 
sub-analysis, however, there was no apparent relationship observed between binimetinib exposure and 
UGT1A1 mutation status. In addition, simulations to investigate the effect of 400 mg atazanavir 
(UGT1A1 inhibitor) on the exposure of 45 mg binimetinib predicted similar binimetinib Cmax in the 
presence or absence of atazanavir. Therefore, the extent of drug interactions mediated by UGT1A1 is 
minimal, and unlikely clinically relevant; however, as this has not been evaluated in a formal clinical 
study, UGT1A1 inducers or inhibitors should be administered with caution.  
Effect of CYP enzymes on binimetinib 
In vitro, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 catalyse the formation of the active metabolite, AR00426032 (M3) 
by oxidative N-desmethylation.  
Effect of binimetinib on CYP substrates 
Binimetinib is a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of transporters on binimetinib 
In vitro experiments indicate that binimetinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP). Inhibition of P-gp or BCRP is unlikely to result in a clinically important 
increase in binimetinib concentrations as binimetinib exhibits moderate to high passive permeability.  
Effect of binimetinib on transporters 
Binimetinib is a weak inhibitor of OAT3. No clinicallly significant drug-drug interactions caused by 
binimetinib on other transporters is expected. 
Binimetinib is metabolised by UGTs and CYP1A2 and is a substrate for Pgp. Specific inducers of 
these enzymes have not been studied and may result in a loss of efficacy. 
Special populations 
Age, body weight 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age or body weight do not have a clinically important 
effect on the systemic exposure of binimetinib. 
Gender 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, the PK of binimetinib were similar in males as 
compared with females. 
Race 
There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the exposure of binimetinib by race or 
ethnicity. 
Hepatic impairment 
As binimetinib is primarily metabolised and eliminated via the liver, patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment may have increased exposure. Results from a dedicated clinical study with 
binimetinib only indicate similar exposures in patients with mild impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) 
and subjects with normal liver function. A two-fold increase in total binimetinib exposure (AUC) was 
observed in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) and severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.2). This increase expends to three fold in both moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment when considering unbound binimetinib exposure (see section 4.2). 
Gilbert’s syndrome 
Binimetinib has not been evaluated in patients with Gilbert’s disease. The main route of hepatic 
transformation of binimetinib being glucoronidation, the decision for treatement should be made by 
the treating physician taking into account the individual benefit-risk. 
Renal impairment 
Binimetinib undergoes minimal renal elimination. Results from a dedicated clinical study showed that 
patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), had a 29 % increase in exposure 
(AUCinf), a 21 % increase in Cmax, and a 22 % decrease in CL/F compared to matching healthy 
subjects. These differences were within the variability observed for these parameters in both cohorts of 
this study (25 % - 49 %) and the variability previously observed in patient clinical studies, hence these 
differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant. 
The effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of binimetinib in combination with 
encorafenib have not been evaluated clinically.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated oral administration of binimetinib in rats for up to 6 months was associated with soft tissue 
mineralisation, gastric mucosal lesions and reversible minimal to mild clinical pathology changes at 7 
to 12.5 times human therapeutic exposures. In a gastric irritation study in rats, an increased incidence 
of superficial mucosal lesions and of hemorrhagic ulcers were observed. In cynomolgus monkeys, oral 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration of binimetinib was associated with gastro-intestinal intolerance, moderate clinical 
pathology changes, bone marrow hypercellularity and microscopic findings of gastrointestinal 
inflammation, reversible at the lowest doses which were below human therapeutic exposures. 
Carcinogenic potential of binimetinib was not evaluated. Standard genotixicity studies with 
binimetinib were negative. 
The potential embryo-foetal effects of binimetinib were evaluated in rats and rabbits. In rats, lower 
gestational body weight gain and fetal body weights and a decreased number of ossified fetal 
sternebrae were noted. No effects were noted at 14-times the human therapeutic exposure .  
In rabbits, mortality, maternal physical signs of toxicity, lower gestational body weight and abortion 
were noted. The number of viable foetuses and foetal body weights were reduced and 
post-implantation loss and resorptions were increased. An increased litter incidence of foetal 
ventricular septal defects and pulmonary trunk alterations was noted at the highest doses. No effects 
were observed at 3times the human therapeutic exposure.   
Fertility studies were not conducted with binimetinib. In repeat-dose toxicity studies, no concern in 
terms of fertility was raised from pathological examination of reproductive organs in rats and 
monkeys. 
Binimetinib has phototoxic potential in vitro.  
A minimal risk for photosensitisation was shown in vivo at an oral dose providing 3.8-fold higher 
exposure than that achieved with the recommended dose in humans. These data indicate that there is 
minimal risk for phototoxicity with binimetinib at therapeutic doses in patients.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Mektovi is and what it is used for 
Mektovi is an anti-cancer medicine that contains the active substance binimetinib. It is used in adults 
in combination with another medicine containing encorafenib to treat a type of skin cancer called 
melanoma when it has 
• 
• 
a particular change (mutation) in a gene responsible for producing a protein called BRAF, and 
spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. 
Mutations in the BRAF gene can produce proteins that cause the melanoma to grow. Mektovi targets 
another protein called “MEK” that stimulates cancer cell growth. When Mektovi is used in 
combination with encorafenib (which targets the changed “BRAF” protein), the combination slows 
down or stops the growth of your cancer. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Mektovi  
Before starting treatment your doctor will check for BRAF mutation.  
As Mektovi is to be used in combination with encorafenib, read the encorafenib leaflet carefully as well 
as this leaflet.   
Do not take Mektovi  
- 
  if  you  are  allergic  to  binimetinib  or  any  of  the  other  ingredients  of  this  medicine  (listed  in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Mektovi about all of your medical conditions, 
particularly if you have any of the following:   
•  heart problems 
•  bleeding problems or if you are taking medicines that may cause bleeding  
• 
eye problems including glaucoma or increased pressure in your eyes 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  muscle problems 
•  high blood pressure 
•  blood clots 
• 
• 
lung or breathing problems 
liver problems  
Tell your doctor if you have ever had blockage in the vein carrying blood away from the eye (retinal 
vein occlusion), as Mektovi is not recommended in such cases. 
Tell your doctor if you have had a different type of cancer than melanoma, as binimetinib when taken 
with encorafenib may worsen certain other types of cancers. 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you get the following while you are taking this 
medicine: 
•  Heart problems: Mektovi can make your heart work less well, or make existing heart problems 
worse. Your doctor will check that your heart is working properly before and during your 
treatment with this medicine. Talk to your doctor immediately if you have any symptoms of 
heart problems such as feeling dizzy, tired, lightheaded, if you have shortness of breath, if you 
feel like your heart is pounding, racing, beating irregularly or if you have swelling in the legs. 
•  Bleeding problems: Mektovi may cause serious bleeding problems. Talk to your doctor 
immediately if you have any symptoms of bleeding problems such as coughing up of blood, 
blood clots, vomit containing blood or that looks like “coffee grounds”, red or black stools 
that look like tar, passing blood in the urine, stomach (abdominal) pain, unusual vaginal 
bleeding. Also tell your doctor if you have headache, dizziness or weakness.  
•  Eye problems: Mektovi can cause serious eye problems. Talk to your doctor immediately if 
you get blurred vision, loss of vision or other vision changes (such as coloured dots in your 
vision), halo (seeing blurred outline around objects). Your doctor will examine your eyes for 
any problems with your sight while you are taking Mektovi.  
•  Muscle problems: Mektovi can cause breakdown of muscle (rhabdomyolysis). Your doctor 
will run blood tests to check for muscle problems before and during treatment. As a 
precaution, drink plenty of fluids during treatment. Talk to your doctor immediately if you get 
muscle pain, cramps, stiffness, spasm, dark urine. 
•  High blood pressure: Mektovi can raise blood pressure. Your doctor or nurse will check your 
blood pressure before and during treatment with Mektovi. Talk to your doctor immediately if 
you get severe headache, feel dizzy, lightheaded or if your blood pressure measured on a home 
blood pressure device is much higher than usual. 
•  Blood clots: Mektovi can cause blood clots in your arms or legs, and if a clot travels to your 
lungs it could lead to death. Talk to your doctor immediately if you get chest pain, sudden 
shortness of breath, trouble breathing, pain in your legs with or without swelling, swelling in 
your arms and legs, or a cool, pale arm or leg. If necessary, your doctor may interrupt your 
treatment or stop it altogether. 
•  Lung or breathing problems: This medicine may cause lung or breathing problems including 
inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease); signs and symptoms can 
include: cough, shortness of breath or fatigue. If necessary, your doctor may interrupt your 
treatment or stop it altogether.  
•  Skin changes: Mektovi, when taken with encorafenib, may cause other types of skin cancer 
such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Your doctor will check your skin before initiation 
of treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months after you stop taking 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these medicines to look for any new skin cancer. Tell your doctor immediately if you detect 
any skin changes during and after the treatment including: new wart, skin sore or reddish 
bump that bleeds or does not heal, or a change in size or colour of a mole. 
Additionally, your doctor needs to check for squamous cell carcinoma on your head, neck, 
mouth and lymph glands, and you will have CT scans regularly. This is a precaution in case a 
squamous cell carcinoma develops inside your body. Genital examinations (for women) and 
anal examinations are also recommended before the initiation and at the end of your treatment. 
•  Liver problems: Mektovi can cause abnormal blood tests related to your liver (raised levels of 
liver enzymes). Your doctor will run blood tests to check your liver before and during 
treatment.  
Children and adolescents 
Mektovi is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This medicine has 
not been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Mektovi 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The therapeutic indication originally applied for by the applicant was: 
Treatment of pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adult patients on haemodialyis, 
including patients where other treatment options have failed. 
Chronic pruritus is defined as itch lasting 6 weeks or more. Stemming from a wide variety of causes 
ranging from primary dermatologic to secondary effects of underlying medical conditions, chronic 
pruritus can be a debilitating condition that significantly decreases quality of life and affects mood, 
sleep, personal relationships, and self-esteem. Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP), or 
uremic pruritus, is a frequently underdiagnosed but severely distressing condition that occurs in 
greater than 60% of patients undergoing dialysis. With between 20 and 40% of patients reporting 
intense, generalized systemic itching in the moderate-to-severe range, CKD-aP has been associated 
with depression, worsened sleep quality, increased risk of infection, decreased quality of life, and an 
increased risk of death.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Of the over ~460,000 patients undergoing HD in the United States (US) (2019, USRDS), >60% have 
some degree of pruritus, with 20-40% suffering from moderate-to-severe CKD-aP. Comparable 
proportions are reported worldwide and in the major countries of the European Union (EU). However, 
CKD-aP is often under-recognized and under-treated by physicians and clinical staff.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
While the pathogenesis of CKD-aP is still incompletely understood, four major hypotheses have arisen: 
1) uremic toxin (such as Vitamin A, aluminium, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium) deposition in 
the subcutaneous tissue, 2) peripheral neuropathy secondary to dysautonomia, 3) immune system 
dysregulation and 4) opioid imbalance. The last, endogenous opioid imbalance has been the focus of 
many new therapies for this condition. Specifically, it has been proposed that chronic pruritus, in 
general, may result from an imbalance in receptor activity between the mu- and kappa- opioid 
receptors. Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) activation has been shown to be pruritus-inducing, whereas 
kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) activation has been shown to be largely antipruritic. MOR upregulation 
and KOR downregulation has been reported in chronic itch of many etiologies, including uremic pruritus 
and cholestatic itch. In addition, this seems to explain why pruritus is a common side effect of both 
prescribed opioids for pain management (such as morphine, oxycodone, oxycontin, and 
hydromorphone) and commonly abused opioids (such as heroin), as they tend to exert larger 
activating effects on the MOR, inducing a MOR/KOR imbalance. This dichotomy also suggests that 
reversing the MOR/KOR imbalance, through decreasing MOR activation and/or increasing KOR 
activation, may be an effective treatment target for minimizing pruritus.

EMA/152430/2022  
Page 8/89 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
CKD-aP is characterized by a generalized and intractable itch. This systemic pruritus does not originate 
from skin lesions, but rather is a persistent itch sensation that often leads to considerable mechanical 
skin damage due to a continuous and uncontrollable urge to scratch. Patients with CKD-aP suffer from 
severely impaired physical and mental health, including sleep disturbance, insomnia, chronic fatigue, 
shame, social isolation, and an increased incidence of depression. Scratching often leads to an 
increased risk of infections (e.g., cellulitis, sepsis, bacteraemia, and infections of the dialysis access). 
Severe itching is also independently associated with an increased risk of mortality, including higher 
rates of cardiovascular-related mortality and infection-related mortality, relative to patients undergoing 
HD without CKD-aP. Patients with CKD undergoing HD have a shortened life expectancy and lower 
quality of life compared with the general population. Their quality of life (QoL) and life expectancy may 
be further reduced when they suffer from CKD-aP. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The prevalence of CKD-aP remains high despite improved efficiency of dialysis techniques, improved 
skin hydration with emollients, and use of phosphate binders and calcimimetics. There is currently no 
medicinal treatment approved specifically for CKD-aP in the EU. Several medications have been used 
largely as off-label treatments for CKD-aP (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, gabapentin, and 
pregabalin). However, these off-label therapies are not always well tolerated by patients, and the 
evidence of their antipruritic efficacy is limited and lacking support from randomized, well-controlled 
studies. Taken together, the severe impact and consequences of CKD-aP and the lack of safe and 
effective treatment options underscore a significant unmet medical need for patients undergoing HD. 
2.2.  About the product 
According to the applicant, difelikefalin is a selective and full agonist at kappa opioid receptors, with no 
identified off-target activity. As such, difelikefalin has no binding or functional activity at mu opioid 
receptors the main target of opioid analgesics. The selective activity of difelikefalin at KORs avoids mu 
opioid associated side effects, such as respiratory depression, dependence, and euphoria. The 
physiochemical properties of difelikefalin (e.g., hydrophilic, synthetic D-amino acid peptide with high 
polar surface area and charge at physiological pH) minimizes passive diffusion or active transport 
across membranes, thus having limited permeability into the central nervous system (CNS). 
The pathophysiology of CKD-aP is not fully understood but is thought to be multifactorial, including 
systemic inflammation and an imbalance in the endogenous opioid system (e.g., overexpression of 
MORs and concomitant downregulation of KORs). Opioid receptors are known to modulate itch signals 
and inflammation, with KOR activation reducing itch and producing immunomodulatory effects. 
The pharmacological actions of KOR agonists on peripheral sensory neurons and immune cells are 
considered mechanistically responsible for the antipruritic and anti-inflammatory effects and was the 
basis for the development of difelikefalin for the proposed indication. Difelikefalin preferentially 
activates KORs expressed outside of the CNS, mitigating side effects such as dysphoria and 
psychomimetic effects associated with the activation of centrally located KORs. 
The proposed indication for difelikefalin is the treatment of pruritus associated with chronic kidney 
disease in adult patients on HD, including patients where other treatment options have failed.

Difelikefalin is formulated as a parenteral solution for intravenous (IV) injection (0.05 mg/mL) and is 
intended to be administered as an IV bolus injection (0.5 mcg/kg dry body weight per dose) 3 times 
per week, following each HD session. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing 50 microgram/ml difelikefalin as 
active substance. The product contains difelikefalin acetate. 
Other ingredients are: acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, sodium chloride and water for injections. 
The product is available in in a single use 2 mL glass vial (type I), with a bromobutyl rubber stopper, 
an aluminium seal and a blue flip-off plastic cap, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.3.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of difelikefalin is N-[(2R)-1-{[(2R)-1-{[(2R)-6-Amino-1-(4-amino-4-carboxy-1-
piperidinyl)-1-oxo-2-hexanyl]amino}-4-methyl-1-oxo-2-pentanyl]amino}-1-oxo-3-phenyl-2-propanyl]-
D-phenylalaninamide corresponding to the molecular formula C36H53N7O6. Difelikefalin acetate has a 
relative molecular mass of 679 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of difelikefalin was elucidated by 1H and 13C NMR spectra, molecular weight and 
amino acid sequence was confirmed by fragmentation and sequence analysis by MS/MS.  
The active substance is an amorphous solid oligopeptide with approximately 1 to 2 mols of acetic acid 
per mol of peptide.  
Difelikefalin is a lyophilised white to off-white powder; it is very hygroscopic and freely soluble in 
water. The measured pH is between 6 and 8.  
Difelikefalin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of several chiral centres. 15 potential 
isomers (diastereomers and the enantiomer) can be formed by epimerisation during peptide synthesis 
or by carry-over of the chiral impurity from the starting materials, these are controlled at the level of 
starting materials, process parameters and active substance specification.  
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 10/89 
 
 
 
 
 
Specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.) of the active substance has been investigated. The chirality of the 
individual amino acids has been confirmed by GC-MS on the reference standard, confirming the 
relative and absolute stereochemistry of difelikefalin and demonstrating that the amino acids Phe, Leu 
and Lys had the D-configuration. Chirality is controlled at the level of the starting materials and 
stereoisomeric impurities are controlled in the specifications of the active substance. 
Polymorphism has been assessed by XRPD. No crystalline or polymorphic forms are known for the 
lyophilised amorphous difelikefalin. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Difelikefalin is synthesised in four main stages: synthesis of the peptide on the resin, cleavage from 
the resin, purification and lyophilisation of the peptide as highlighted in Scheme 1. The manufacturing 
process uses well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications; with the exception of SM-1, 
all the starting materials are well established commercially available staring materials, commonly used 
in solid phase peptide manufacture. SM-1 is a custom synthesised small molecule with acceptable 
specifications and, as such, it is accepted as starting material, it is supplied by two suppliers. All 
starting materials are single amino acid derivatives in D-configuration except (4-carboxy-4-amino)-
piperidinyl residue (which has no chiral centre). 
Scheme 1: active substance manufacturing process  
The manufacturing method uses the well-established Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) which 
is based on sequential assembly of protected amino acids, see Scheme 2. The growing peptide chain is 
anchored to a solid polymeric support, which allows for efficient removal of excess starting materials 
and reagents between each reaction step. After incorporation of the last D-phenylalanyl residue, the 
assembly of the resin-bound peptide is complete. The combination of side chain protection and the 
linker selection enables concomitant deprotection and cleavage from the solid support at acidic 
conditions (with TFA/water). Purification and concomitant acetate conversion of the difelikefalin crude 
in solution are performed by reverse-phase HPLC, see Scheme 3. Ion exchange of the crude peptide 
solution is achieved by applying isocratic aqueous ammonium acetate buffer, then purification is 
performed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water containing acetic acid buffer. Fractions that 
meet the main pool criteria are pooled together and concentrated, the solution is filtered through a 
0.2 μm filter prior to lyophilisation. Isolation of the active substance is performed by lyophilisation. The 
bulk active substance is jar milled.

During the procedure, the manufacturing description has been updated with details on the amounts of 
reagent solution and solvents used in the process. Pooling of fractions is critical for the final purity of 
the peptide and details regarding fraction sizes, selection and pooling have been included in the 
description of the purification process. Reprocessing is not proposed as part of the application.  
Critical steps have been identified and are controlled by adequate in-process controls during the 
synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and 
reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. All the 15 potential diastereomers were investigated, of which 
only two of the were detected; however, four diastereomers are included as specified impurities in the 
active substance specification since they may potentially be present due to the presence of the chiral 
impurity up to 0.2 % in the starting materials. The remaining potential isomers are adequately 
controlled by starting material specifications and process parameters and can, if present, be detected 
by the analytical method used for testing the purity of the active substance. Insertion and deletion 
impurities have been investigated and are adequately controlled by the proposed specification. 
Process related impurities have been investigated. Two t-butyl derivatives, obtained by the reaction of 
an amino group on the peptide with the tert-butyl cation formed during Boc cleavage, are controlled by 
IPC and in the active substance specification (as unspecified impurities).  
The reagent trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is used in the cleavage and deprotection process step to remove 
the peptide protecting groups. The reagents and solvents used in purification are ammonium acetate, 
ammonium hydroxide, acetic acid (AcOH), acetonitrile (ACN) and water. TFA, AcOH and ACN are 
controlled by the active substance specifications. A risk assessment has successfully demonstrated that 
benzene is not a potential impurity in acetonitrile, hence the absence of its control is justified. 
In summary, potential and actual impurities were well-discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. 
The manufacturing process has been developed in parallel with the clinical development program, 
using a combination of conventional univariate studies and elements of QbD such as risk assessment. 
Critical quality attributes (CQAs), critical material attributes (CMAs) and critical process parameter 
(CPPs) were identified and the impact of the CMAs and PPs on the CQAs was investigated, focusing on 
minimising critical impurities that are difficult to resolve and remove during the chromatography 
purification process.  
Each step of manufacturing process for difelikefalin active substance was optimised separately. As a 
result of the optimisation exercise, the proposed commercial manufacturing process is robust and 
under a state of control to ensure the identity, assay, purity and quality of difelikefalin active 
substance. Confirmation of the successful optimisation was demonstrated through the manufacture of 
6 consecutive commercial scale Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) batches. The quality of the 
active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be comparable with 
that produced by the proposed commercial process.  
The active substance is packaged in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene (PP) 
screw closure which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The plastic 
container is placed in a heat-sealed aluminium foil pouch. The secondary packaging component provides 
additional protection from moisture.

(ICP-MS, Ph. Eur.), water content (KF – Ph. Eur.), acetic acid content (LC-UV), microbial examination 
(Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.).  
The specification contains tests expected for a peptide active substance. The tests clarity (Ph. Eur. 
2.2.1) and colour (Ph. Eur. 2.2.2) of the solution, which are able to detect impurities at levels not 
detected by the impurity methods, have been included. Four diastereomers are included as specified 
impurities since they may potentially be present due to the presence of the chiral impurity in the 
starting materials. 
The pH acceptance criteria have been tightened during the assessment in line with batch data. During 
characterisation of the active substance the chiral purity of each amino acid has been demonstrated by 
chiral GC; therefore, it is acceptable that a test for enantiomeric purity is not included in the 
specification; optical rotation is included as specification test to demonstrate the identity of the chiral 
difelikefalin active substance and to demonstrate the absence of the racemate. 
Specification limits are in line with ICH Q3A and have been satisfactorily justified from a reaction 
mechanistic point of view. 
Limits for residual solvents (TF, ACN and AcOH) and catalysts (Pd) have been included in the 
specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on six commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.  
Stability 
Stability data from 6 batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long term (-20°C) and intermediate (5°C) 
conditions and for up to 24 months under accelerated conditions (25°C / 60% RH) according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. Batches were manufactured using SM-1 from both suppliers. 
All results comply with the proposed specifications and no special trends are observed. An unidentified 
impurity was detected at -20°C with at a content of 0.09 % after 48 months storage. An increase in 
unspecified impurities is observed under accelerated conditions. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The active 
substance is not light sensitive.  
Results on stress conditions (i.e.  exposure to heat, aqueous solutions of neutral, acidic and basic pH 
and oxidation) have been provided. The results of the stress stability show that difelikefalin was 
degraded by exposure to dry heat (80°C for 7 days) and by exposure to oxidative stress (3 % H2O2 at 
25°C for 15 hours). None of the degradants were identified during long-term stability studies;

however, two acetylated forms, which were identified after dry heat exposure, were also observed 
after 12 months storage at accelerated conditions (25°C /60% RH).  
Additionally, the impact of repeated cycling from long-term storage conditions (-20°C) to ambient 
temperature (25°C) conditions (5 cycles) has been studied. There was no change in any of the 
parameters tested for the 5 cycles. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months when stored at -
20°C in the proposed container. 
2.3.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is solution for injection, containing 50 µg of the active substance difelikefalin. 
Other ingredients are acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, sodium chloride and water for injection. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product focused on the choice of buffer, investigation 
on the solution density and the effect of concentration and fill volume on formulation stability.   
The choice of excipients is justified, and their functions has been explained and it is satisfactory. All 
excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients, and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.  
Only fill volume and concentration of the active substance have been changed during the development 
of the finished product. Minor optimisation of the manufacture of the active substance has been 
conducted during the development of the finished product but no major changes to the synthesis of the 
active substance have been implemented. The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as 
that intended for marketing, hence no bioequivalence study has been conducted and this is acceptable. 
The development of the manufacturing process has been described in detail. To address a major 
objection raised during the procedure, the sterilisation method now includes an additional terminal 
sterilisation step at compendial conditions (≥121°C, ≥ 15 min) performed on the aseptically filled 
product.  
The finished product as a ready to use single dose IV solution is drawn from the vial by the use of a 
sterile, single-use syringe and needle. No dilution or reconstitution prior to administration is needed. A 
compatibility study was conducted to evaluate the stability of the dosing solution in polypropylene 
syringes. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities and pH. Testing was conducted with 
the validated HPLC method for assay and impurities or by compendial methods for appearance (and pH 
value. Results met the release specifications demonstrating compatibility with the polypropylene 
syringes. 
The primary packaging is clear glass vials single use 2 mL glass vial (type I), with a bromobutyl rubber 
stopper, an aluminium seal and a blue flip-off plastic cap. The glass vial is a 2 R hydrolytic type I, the 
material complies with Ph. Eur. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main stages: compounding, biorburden reduction, sterile 
filtration, aseptic filling, terminal sterilisation. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Initially, critical steps in the finished product manufacturing process have been identified and they 
included sterile filtration and aseptic filling, which was the originally chosen sterilisation process for the 
finished product. No additional critical steps were proposed for the introduction of the additional 
terminal sterilisation step since it is performed at compendial standards. The manufacturing process 
has been successfully validated through enhanced monitoring, sampling, and testing of three 
consecutive commercial scale batches of the aseptically manufactured finished product intermediate. 
Since the product is further terminally sterilised at compendial conditions, validation of the terminal 
sterilisation is not required to be submitted in the MAA and it will be completed prior to marketing. 
Nevertheless, data for two commercial batches manufactured with terminal sterilisation have been 
included in the dossier. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls 
are adequate for this type of pharmaceutical form/ manufacturing process and consist of measuring of 
pH, pre/post-filtration integrity test (bioburden reduction and sterility) and fill weight test. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (in house), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), particulate contamination (Ph. Eur.), 
visible particulates in injections (Ph. Eur.), container closure integrity (USP), test for extractable 
volume of parenteral preparations (Ph. Eur.), identification of difelikefalin (UV-VIS and HPLC), 
determination of difelikefalin content (free base, RP-HPLC), related substances (RP-HPLC), sterility (Ph. 
Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (LAL – Ph. Eur.). 
Overall, the finished product specification has been adequately set in accordance with ICH Q6A and 
Ph. Eur. During the procedure, the limit for the assay at the end of shelf life has been brought in line 
with the release limit. Following the implementation of the terminal sterilisation method, a specified 
impurity has been added to the specification. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on three batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for identification, assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for one production scale batch manufactured by terminal 
sterilisation; supportive data on three production scale batches, which underwent aseptic filling, have 
been provided, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture 
to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from one full scale batch of the terminally sterilised finished product stored for up to 
three months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to three months under 
accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Additional 
supportive stability data on three full scale process validation batches of the aseptically filled finished 
product intermediate stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Satisfactory stability data on a number of pilot batches of the finished product prior to and 
after terminal sterilisation has also been provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Stability data generated with the terminally sterilised pilot batches show a decrease of the assay value 
after the terminal sterilisation. However, the effect of the sterilisation is compensated with a respective 
manufacturing overage in order to meet the assay specifications. Exposure to terminal sterilisation 
results in a maximum single impurity/degradation product, which has been identified and specified as 
related substance . Apart from this difference, the batches that are terminally sterilised behave during 
stability like the batches that are manufactured aseptically. Hence, the data provided for the 
aseptically sterilised batches is accepted as supportive. Three full scale commercial batches of the 
terminally sterilised finished product have been put on stability   
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No trends or significant changes in any stability 
parameters have been observed. However, it should be noted that there is an inherent variability of 
the assay results of approximately 2% observed between different time points which is typical of 
oligopeptides. An excursion outside this variability was observed at t = 9 months and it was linked to 
the change in reference standard.  
In addition, two batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes have been observed, all attributes 
evaluated have met the specifications: the finished product is not light sensitive. 
A thermal degradation study to identify degradation products resulting from heat stress was performed 
on a simulated finished product solution containing difelikefalin active substance at a higher 
concentration of 1 mg/mL, exposing it to 121 °C, but for a longer time period of 4 h in order to 
generate a sufficient amount of degradation products.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years, without any special storage 
conditions, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has revised the sterilisation method from 
aseptic filling to compendial terminal sterilisation, thus resolving the Major Objection raised. The 
results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Not applicable. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Difelikefalin, a small synthetic peptide and full agonist at kappa opioid receptors (KORs), is being 
developed for the treatment of chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) in adult patients 
undergoing haemodialysis, including patients where other treatment options have failed. Chronic 
kidney disease-associated pruritus is a common, distressing, and underrecognized condition that 
affects more than 60% of patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD), with 20 to 40% of patients 
reporting moderate-to-severe pruritus. It is characterized by a generalized, persistent, and intractable 
itch that affects their ability to sleep and results in chronic fatigue, feelings of shame, increased social 
isolation, and an increased incidence of depression. The pathophysiology of CKD-aP is not fully 
understood but is thought to be multifactorial, including systemic inflammation and imbalance in the 
endogenous opioid system. Opioid receptors are known to modulate itch signals and inflammation, 
with KOR activation reducing itch and producing immunomodulatory effects which is the basis for the 
development of difelikefalin for the proposed indication.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Five in vitro pharmacology studies were conducted to determine the binding characteristics, functional 
activity and anti-inflammatory effects of difelikefalin. Binding affinity assays showed that difelikefalin 
binds to human recombinant KOR expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) with an 
inhibitory constant (Ki) and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.32 and 0.799 nM, 
respectively. Difelikefalin also exhibited significant affinity for the rat recombinant KOR expressed in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells resulting in 93% inhibition of control specific binding at 10 µM. In a 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 17/89 
 
 
 
 
 
binding kinetic study conducted in CHO cells transfected with human recombinant KORs, the binding 
half-life (t½) of difelikefalin was estimated at 92 minutes with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) 
of 0.14 nM. Together, these three in vitro studies demonstrated that difelikefalin is a potent and full 
agonist at human and rat KORs with a slow receptor off-rate that might contribute to a long duration of 
activity in vivo.  
The potency and efficacy of difelikefalin were assessed in an in vitro functional cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) production assay using thymoma cells expressing mouse KORs and a reporter 
gene assay in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with cDNA for human KORs. The concentration of 
difelikefalin necessary to produce 50% of the maximal response (EC50) in the assays was 0.048 nM at 
the mouse KORs and 0.16 nM at the human KORs, with 96 and 99% efficacy, respectively. Thus, 
difelikefalin is a potent full agonist at the human and mouse KORs. Difelikefalin also displayed anti-
inflammatory activity. In vitro, difelikefalin at 2.0 to 50 nM reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine 
production (e.g. IL-1, TNF-α, granulocyte colony stimulating factor) by human monocyte-derived 
macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and IFN-γ.  
The in vivo pharmacological activity of difelikefalin was evaluated in several mouse and rat studies. 
Also, a high degree of overall homology for KORs, MORs, DORs and orphanin FQ (or nociception) 
receptors exists across vertebrate species. The key models used to evaluate the antipruritic and anti-
inflammatory activity of difelikefalin are well-characterized and commonly used in drug evaluation. 
Hence, the choice of animal models is considered suitable.  
In vivo, i.v. difelikefalin displayed potent, dose-dependent, long-duration antipruritic effects in two 
well-characterized mouse models of chemically-induced itch using the kappa antagonist, 5' 
guanidinonaltrindole (5' GNTI), and the mast cell secretagogue, compound 48/80. Difelikefalin dose 
necessary to reduce scratching activity in the neck region of male mice near the pruritogen injection 
site by 50% (ED50) was 0.05 and 0.08 mg/kg i.v. for 5' GNTI and compound 48/80 induced itch 
behaviour, respectively. A time-course study, which evaluated the anti-scratching activity of 
difelikefalin pre-treatment against compound 48/80-induced itch at an estimated submaximal ED80 
dose (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), demonstrated a statistically significant mean percent inhibition of scratching of 
approximately 70% or more compared with the control value through 12 hours post dose. At the doses 
evaluated, the effect of difelikefalin was similar to the effect of nalfurafine, a centrally acting KOR 
agonist and partial MOR agonist approved for the treatment of CKD-aP in HD patient. The two models 
evaluating the antipruritic effect of difelikefalin were relevant as they are sensitive to the effect of 
other kappa agonists, such as nalfurafine, a centrally acting KOR agonist and partial MOR agonist. 
The anti-inflammatory activity of difelikefalin shown in vitro was also characterized in two in vivo 
studies. Inhibition of LPS-evoked pro-inflammatory cytokine release was demonstrated in vivo in a 
mouse model of sepsis (endotoxemia). Difelikefalin dose dependently reduced the release of TNF-α 
compared with the mean vehicle control value when administered by s.c. injection prior to LPS 
challenge, with a minimum effective dose (MED) of 3 mg/kg and an efficacy similar to the positive 
control, prednisolone (3 mg/kg). Difelikefalin, administered by s.c. injection at 10 mg/kg prior to LPS 
challenge, decreased a panel of cytokines in a qualitatively similar pattern to prednisolone, significantly 
reducing TNF-α, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-12 production by 19 to 47% 
compared with the vehicle control. Pre-treatment with difelikefalin prior to intraplantar injection of 
carrageenan also resulted in a dose-related anti-inflammatory effect in rats as indicated by a 
significant reduction in hind paw swelling. The MED for difelikefalin was 0.3 mg/kg i.v., with an effect 
in the inflammatory pain model similar to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen (100 
mg/kg s.c.). 
The peripheral action of difelikefalin was investigated in a chemically induced pancreatitis and spinal 
nerve ligation model. The antinociceptive activity of difelikefalin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was significantly 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 18/89 
 
 
 
 
inhibited in male rats following i.p. administration of naloxone methiodide or the selective KOR 
antagonist nor-BNI in chemically induced pancreatitis. Inhibition of the difelikefalin effect by nor-BNI 
demonstrates that the mechanism of action is mediated through KOR. The inhibitory effect of the 
peripherally restricted mu and kappa antagonist, naloxone methiodide, supports that difelikefalin is 
acting via the activation of peripherally located opioid receptors. The anti-allodynic effect of difelikefalin 
(1 mg/kg; i.v.) in a spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model was reversed by intraplantar administration of 
nor-BNI into the affected paw of male rats, further indicating that difelikefalin acts primarily by 
activating KORs located on primary afferent sensory neurons outside of the central nervous system. 
The lack of tolerance to the antinoceptive effect of difelikefalin was supported in two in vivo studies. 
Sustained anti-allodynic activity was observed in SNL male rats following repeat daily i.v. 
administration of difelikefalin (1 mg/kg/day), with a statistically significant increase in paw withdrawal 
threshold (PWT) compared with daily baseline values observed across all days. There was a slight 
downward trend in efficacy by approximately 28% to 33% from Day 1 beginning Day 5 through Day 7. 
To ascertain whether the diminution in the difelikefalin response could be related to technical issues 
associated with repeat i.v. injections, the 7-day repeat-dose administration of difelikefalin was 
repeated using the p.o. route of administration instead of i.v. and no decrease in efficacy was observed 
on Day 7 compared with Day 1. Overall, the data support that there is no tolerance to the anti-
allodynic effect of difelikefalin in the rat SNL model. 
Overall, these in vitro and in vivo studies were relevant in relation to the disease to be treated and the 
proposed indication. Proof of concept and mode of action of difelikefalin were demonstrated and this is 
endorsed.  
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The in vitro binding of difelikefalin at 10 µM was assessed across five studies to characterize the 
potential secondary pharmacodynamics activity in a comprehensive panel of ion channels, enzymes, 
transporters, and receptors including the human MOR, DOR, and ORL1. The studies demonstrated that 
difelikefalin is unlikely to exhibit biologically relevant activity at any target tested, except the intended 
KOR target. Furthermore, difelikefalin up to 1 M exhibited no activity at the at MORs and DORs in a 
functional assay. The data indicate that difelikefalin is highly selective for the rodent and human KORs 
and is unlikely to exhibit biologically relevant secondary pharmacodynamics activity at any of the 
targets tested.  
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The potential effects of difelikefalin on the CNS were evaluated in both, mice and rats. Difelikefalin i.v. 
administered to mice at doses up to 0.1 mg/kg was not associated with any effect on locomotor 
activity. A statistically significant, dose-dependent decrease in total locomotor activity through 1 hour 
after dose administration compared with the vehicle control was observed in mice at ≥0.3 mg/kg. 
A functional observational battery (FOB) GLP study in rats was conducted 2 and 24 hours after 
administration of i.v. difelikefalin at 1 to 25 mg/kg. An effect on all functional domain groups evaluated 
in the FOB was noted across all dose groups, with an effect designated as adverse based on 
magnitude, duration, and/or dose response relationship. The adverse effects included decreased 
activity and arousal in the open field, decreased rearing and posture abnormalities (CNS parameters); 
increased urination and miosis (autonomic nervous system effects); delayed tail flick response 
(sensorimotor effects); gait impairments or abnormalities, surface righting, and air righting 
(neuromuscular effects); and decreased body temperature. Difelikefalin-related effects had resolved or 
were resolving within 24 hours of dosing, and animals appeared normal by 48 hours post dose. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 19/89 
 
 
 
 
increased urination and decreased behavioural and motor effects are consistent with a pharmacological 
response to the activation of KORs, occurring at large multiples (>300-fold) of the human exposure at 
the clinical dose to treat CKD-aP in HD patients. The lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) was 
considered to be 1 mg/kg, which is approximately 386-fold higher than the anticipated Cmax in CKD-aP 
patients undergoing HD administered the proposed clinical dose of 0.5 µg/kg. 
In addition, five other CNS safety pharmacology studies in mice and rats evaluating the safety 
potential of difelikefalin were presented and the results are outlined in the table below. Their results 
were in line with the two aforementioned pivotal CNS studies.

pharmacology studies evaluating the effects of difelikefalin on the central nervous, respiratory and 
cardiovascular systems were conducted in compliance with GLP.  
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
A pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction study was conducted to investigate the potential additive or 
synergistic effect on locomotor activity when difelikefalin is co-administered with the antihistamine, 
ketotifen. The study was undertaken because HD patients with CKD-aP often take antihistamines, and 
antihistamine can induce drowsiness and decrease motor function. Difelikefalin at 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg 
administered by i.v. injection or ketotifen at 30 mg/kg administered orally to rats resulted in a 
statistically significant decrease in mean locomotor activity compared with the vehicle at the three-
time intervals evaluated: 0 to 10, 10 to 20, and 20 to 30 minutes. The i.v. administration of 0.3 mg/kg 
difelikefalin 30 minutes after administration of ketotifen exhibited neither synergistic nor additive 
effects when compared with ketotifen alone.  
At a dose of 0.6 mg/kg, difelikefalin appeared to significantly potentiate the 30 mg/kg ketotifen-related 
decrease in locomotor activity. It is stated that these effects occur at high exposure multiples to the 
MRHD. However, in the pooled data of two well-controlled Phase 3 studies, subjects who used an 
antihistamine prior anti-itch medication (most common drugs used were antihistamines 
diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine) showed a higher risk of somnolence indicating that there is a drug-
drug interaction. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of difelikefalin was evaluated in relevant animal species including mice, rats, rabbits and 
monkeys.  
Absorption: Difelikefalin PK following a single intravenous dose demonstrated peak plasma 
concentrations at the first timepoint post dose that declined with time in a biexponential pattern 
characterised by a relatively fast distribution phase followed by a slower elimination phase. Exposure 
measured by area under the concentration vs time curve (AUC) generally increased in a roughly dose-
proportional manner. Elimination half-life was relatively short and tended to be slightly longer in the 
rat compared to the monkey. The clearance was moderate in the rat and low in monkey. Several 
single- and repeat-dose toxicokinetic analyses of difelikefalin were performed on samples collected 
from male and female rats and monkeys following i.v. bolus administration in toxicology studies. In the 
general toxicology studies, rats received daily difelikefalin doses at 0.25 to 25 mg/kg/day for up to 26 
weeks by i.v. injection and monkeys were administered daily i.v. doses of 0.25 to 4 mg/kg/day for 4 
weeks or 0.06 to 1.0 mg/kg/day for up to 39 weeks. Repeat-dose toxicokinetics were also determined 
in pregnant rats at 0.25 to 25 mg/kg/day and in pregnant rabbits at 0.025 to 0.1 mg/kg, where 
difelikefalin was administered through the period of organogenesis.  
In both, rat and monkey, i.v. exposure to difelikefalin increased in a dose-proportional to slightly 
greater than dose-proportional manner. Accumulation was generally not observed in the rat, but when 
noted, it was only minor (<2-fold) and occurred only at the high dose.  
There was no consistent pattern of gender-related effects on any toxicokinetic parameters in either 
species. 
The kinetics of and exposure to difelikefalin in pregnant rats from gestation day (GD) 7 through GD 17 
was similar to that reported in nonpregnant animals. Qualitatively similar kinetics to the pregnant rat 
was observed in the pregnant rabbit administered difelikefalin from GD 7 through GD 19 characterised 
by a dose-proportional increase in exposure and plasma concentration that exhibited a biexponential 
decline following maximum concentration.

In general, toxicokinetic data for difelikefalin in the intravenous repeat-dose studies demonstrated that 
exposure for both Cmax and AUC was roughly dose-proportional to slightly greater than dose-
proportional, independent of sex and with a short half-life. 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetic studies by the s.c. route were conducted to support carcinogenicity testing in 
mouse and rat, as well as chronic administration in the rat. Mice were administered difelikefalin by s.c. 
injection at doses of 3 to 33 mg/kg/day in a dose-range finding study and 3 to 30 mg/kg/day in a 26-
week transgenic carcinogenicity study. Rats were administered difelikefalin by s.c. injection at doses of 
10 and 50 mg/kg/day in a 10-day preliminary study, 1 to 25 mg/kg/day in a 26-week study, and 0.25 
to 1.0 mg/kg/day for up to 183 days in a 2-year carcinogenicity study toxicokinetic cohort. Absorption 
in both mice and rats was relatively quick (tmax = 0.25 to 0.5 hours and 0.25 to 1 hour, respectively). 
Exposure to difelikefalin increased with increasing dose resulting in a wide range of exposures for both 
species. In the mouse, there was minimal to no accumulation with repeat dosing and no 
gender-related differences. In the rat, marked accumulation and/or increase in difelikefalin plasma 
concentration with repeat dosing was observed. Gender-related differences (i.e., ≥2-fold difference) 
were dependent on dose in the rat, with no differences following repeat dose administration at 5 and 
25 mg/kg/day but with females exhibiting notably greater exposure than males following repeat dose 
administration at doses of 0.25 to 1 mg/kg/day. 
Distribution:  Protein binding of difelikefalin was low across all species (<50% in mice, rats, monkeys, 
and humans) as assessed via equilibrium dialysis and/or ultracentrifugation of radiolabelled difelikefalin 
in vitro and by ultracentrifugation in plasma samples from monkeys following a single i.v. dose. Results 
of the studies demonstrated that in vitro protein binding ranged from 15.8 to 36.8% at 1 μM and 17.7 
to 49.1% at 10 μM difelikefalin in plasma from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys and humans. The ex vivo 
plasma protein binding in monkeys was approximately 17.3 to 17.8% at 0.5 and 2 hours, respectively, 
following i.v. dose administration of 1 mg/kg of [14C]-difelikefalin. Assessment of difelikefalin general 
tissue distribution was conducted in rats and monkeys using whole tissue dissection and quantitative 
whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) or qualitative whole-body autoradiography (ARG) methods. Four 
comprehensive tissue distribution studies were conducted in rats following a single i.v. administration 
of 1 mg/kg [14C]-difelikefalin in male albino rats and male pigmented rats, as well as male and female 
SD rats, and following 7 days of difelikefalin i.v. administration. In monkeys, qualitative head and 
whole-body ARG was conducted following a single i.v. dose of 1 mg/kg [14C]-difelikefalin. Additional 
studies were conducted to further characterise the potential distribution to whole brain and other 
nervous tissues in rats and distribution to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in rats and monkeys. Overall, 
the distribution studies in both species and across all studies demonstrated a similar kinetic profile 
following an i.v. injection of radiolabelled difelikefalin in both the rat and the monkey, the highest 
levels of radioactivity were observed in difelikefalin excretory organs including the kidney (urine 
primary excretory route) and to a lesser extent the liver (faeces minor excretory route). In all other 
tissues the tissue:blood ratios were generally <1 at all timepoints. 
Distribution of radioactivity to CNS tissues protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was negligible, 
even at exposures based on Cmax and AUClast that are ≥400-fold and ≥40-fold higher, respectively, 
than the exposure in subjects with CKD-aP undergoing HD at the clinical dose of 0.5 mcg/kg IV every 
2 to 3 days. 
In general, the studies demonstrated a similar distribution profile in albino and pigmented rats, no 
gender-related differences were noted, and comparable tissue radioactivity concentrations after a 
single dose and daily doses for 7 days suggest that repeat dosing does not impact distribution. The 
QWBA results were considered qualitatively similar to the tissue dissection studies in rats. 
Transplacental transfer of difelikefalin was demonstrated in pregnant rats with foetal:maternal plasma 
ratios ranging from 0.025 to 0.027.

Metabolism: The metabolism of difelikefalin was negligible in vitro and in rats and monkeys with no 
major metabolites identified consistent with data from a human ADME study in healthy and HD 
subjects using [14C]-difelikefalin. 
Excretion: The excretion of difelikefalin was evaluated in rats and monkeys administered a single i.v. 
dose of 1 or 3 mg/kg [14C]-difelikefalin. The main route of excretion for difelikefalin was in the urine 
with a mean cumulative excretion of the radioactive dose through 168 hours post dose of 57.1 to 74 
and 70.1% in the rat and monkey, respectively. In monkeys, the urinary excretion was underestimated 
compared to the aforementioned studies. Through 168 hours post dose, the percent of the radioactive 
difelikefalin dose excreted in the faeces ranged from 13 to 37.2% in the rat and was 12.7% in the 
monkey. In bile duct cannulated animals, 65, 13, and 2.6% of radioactivity was excreted in urine, bile, 
and faeces, respectively, through 48 hours after dosing. 
Faecal excretion was reported to be 13 to 37, 12.7 and 11.3% of the total radioactive dose in rats, 
monkeys, and humans with normal renal function, respectively. As expected, the amount of 
difelikefalin excreted in the urine was notably lower (11.2%) in HD subjects. The total percent of the 
radioactive dose recovered from the dialysate was 19.5%, whereas faecal excretion represented 
58.8% of the radioactive dose. The percentage of the radioactive dose excreted in the faeces of HD 
subjects is greater than that observed in either the rat or monkey. Based on the doses administered in 
the rat and monkey chronic toxicology studies that were not associated with any hepatic or biliary 
lesions (i.e., the high dose of 25 and 1 mg/kg/day, respectively), the total dose excreted via the bile 
into the faeces compared with HD subjects (0.5 µg/kg every 2 to 3 days) would result in a bile 
concentration exposure multiple of greater than several thousand-fold and approximately 32.2-fold in 
the rat and monkey, respectively. The data in the rat and monkey, therefore, support that the increase 
in faecal excretion of difelikefalin in CKD patients on HD would represent negligible to no safety risk, 
which is supported. The potential milk transfer of difelikefalin in relation to plasma exposure was 
investigated in lactating rats on lactation day 14 in addition to plasma levels of the nursing pups. The 
data indicate that difelikefalin is transferred to the milk when lactating rats were administered 
difelikefalin with milk:plasma ratio of 0.044, 0.051, and 0.042 at 0.6, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg/day, but 
detectable levels of difelikefalin were not measured in the nursing pups. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions: A battery of in vitro assays evaluating the potential effect of 
difelikefalin on CYP induction and inhibition, UGT inhibition, transporter test systems (substrate or 
inhibitor) as well as low protein binding (in vitro and in vivo) was undertaken to determine the 
potential for drug interactions. 
Overall, the study results indicated that permeability was similar in the presence and absence of the 
efflux-transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-inhibitor, verapamil, and difelikefalin did not result in 
appreciable inhibition of a P-gp substrate (digoxin) efflux, suggesting that difelikefalin is not a 
substrate nor inhibitor of P-gp. 
In transporter test systems, difelikefalin at concentrations up to 10, 30 or 300 μM (approximately 7 to 
200 µg/mL) was not a substrate or inhibitor of the bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance 
associated protein 2 (MRP2), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporter 1 
(OAT1), OAT3, organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), OCT2, OCT3, organic anion transporting 
polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), OATP1A2, OATP1B3, multidrug and extrusion (MATE) transporter 1 
(MATE1), MATE2K, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), and peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) or 
PEPT2. Furthermore, difelikefalin is not a substrate of the apical sodium-dependent bile acid 
transporter (ASBT), OAT2, OATP2B1, organic cation/carnitine transporter 1 (OCTN1), OCTN2, and 
organic solute transporter α/β (OSTαβ). 
The totality of the in vitro drug interaction studies showed that difelikefalin was not a substrate (<2-
fold difference in uptake) or an inhibitor (<22% inhibition) of any major human drug transporter. The 
Assessment report

effect of other drugs on difelikefalin pharmacokinetics have not been directly evaluated, but the low 
degree of plasma protein binding and lack of interaction of difelikefalin with common drug transporters 
and metabolic enzymes in vitro suggest a low likelihood of drug interactions that could impact the 
safety or efficacy of difelikefalin or concomitantly administered drugs based on pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions. Therefore, the potential risk of interaction between difelikefalin and other drugs is 
considered minimal, and this is endorsed by the CHMP. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
No other pharmacokinetic studies were conducted.  
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
Mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys were considered pharmacological relevant species for toxicity studies 
due to findings from the conducted pharmacology and toxicology studies in addition to a high degree of 
KORs homology across vertebrate species. Due to the extensiveness for the submitted data, only 
selected studies considered essential for the sought indication were assessed. The test article used in 
the pivotal nonclinical studies are according to the applicant comparable to the drug substance used in 
the clinical trials and in the drug substance to-be-marketed. Additionally, no new excipients are used 
and the excipients in the formulation (i.e., compendial sodium chloride, sodium acetate, and acetic 
acid in water) are at concentrations at or below currently approved products.  
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats and monkeys with i.v. administration. The rat 
and monkey study were made with i.v. infusion over a 5-minute interval. The mouse study was 
conducted to GLP, as it is part of a dose-range finding for the micronucleus test, whereas the 
remaining rat and monkey study are non-GLP. This is acceptable. The single-dose toxicity studies are 
generally conducted as a part of a dose range finding studies for either the micronucleus test or 
repeat-dose toxicity studies. This is supported, as stand-alone single-dose studies are not encouraged 
from a 3R perspective in accordance with ICH M3(R2).  
Primary difelikefalin-related observations were lethargy in all the species even at the lower doses 
(mouse and rats ≥50 mg/kg/day, monkeys ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day) and reduced food consumption, leading 
to a dose-dependent effect on body weight gain primarily in male rats (and female rats at 75 
mg/kg/day). Clinical signs generally increased in number and severity with increasing doses in all 
species.   
Mortality was seen for all mice receiving 200 mg/kg/day i.v. and veterinary intervention was needed 
for a monkey in the 16 mg/kg/day group (ataxia, loss of body temperature, emesis resulting in 
Naloxone treatment). MTDs of 100 mg/kg/day and 8 mg/kg/day in mice and monkey is therefore 
supported, however, it should be noted that adverse effects of varying severity were still observed at 
these doses. An MTD in rats were not established but could be set to 100 mg/kg/day, using criteria as 
lack of mortality and highly severe illness. However, observations of reduced food consumption and 
body weight (BW)/BW gain led to a reduction of the high dose for the repeat-dose study in rats to 25 
mg/kg/day, which is supported.    
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The choice of repeat-dose studies as pivotal are generally supported according to ICH M3(R2) 
guideline. Of the non-pivotal studies, the dose range finding study in rats and in monkeys are 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022

considered relevant in support of the doses used for the repeat-dose studies. The SC repeat-dose 
studies in mice and rats supports the conducted CARC studies.  
Rats: A maximum difelikefalin doses of 25 mg/kg/day for i.v. administration in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats was determined based on data from the dose range finding study. The dose was 
generally well tolerated, however, transient lethargy, lower BW gain and reduced food consumption 
was detected. Decreased activity were detected in all dose groups during the first week of dosing in 
the 28-day rat study. Generally, male rats appear to be more prone to adverse effect even though no 
gender-related difference was observed in exposure. In male rats, a reduction in BW and reduced food 
consumption were noted already at 5 mg/kg/day, compared to female animals primarily showing 
reduced BW gain. In the 13- and 26-week rat studies similar findings of transient decrease in activity, 
food consumption and BW were noted during the first weeks of IV administration difelikefalin, 
especially in male animals. However, the effect on reduced BW and food consumption appeared to 
normalize over longer periods of administration. 
Testicular and epididymal changes were noted in the 4-week study with reduced testicular weight at 25 
mg/kg/day and germinal epithelium degeneration at doses ≥5mg/kg/day. Changes were most 
pronounced in the 25 mg/kg/day group but mostly resolved after recovery. The effect observed in the 
lower dose groups appeared to mitigate due to changes in housing from wire-bottomed to solid-
bottomed cages in the subsequent 13- and 26-week studies. However, atrophy and/or degeneration in 
seminiferous tubular and cell debris in epididymis were still seen at doses of ≥25 mg/kg/day in the two 
longer-term studies. In the 4-week and 26-week study, the effect was bilateral and even though it 
mostly resolved after recovery, a difelikefalin-related effect on the spermatogenesis cannot be 
excluded. The changes in the 13-week study were, however, only observed unilaterally and a link to a 
systemic effect of difelikefalin is therefore more uncertain. A reduction of ovary weight of 33% was 
seen in female rats in the 26-week study, however, no correlating histopathological findings were 
noted. 
In the kidneys, non-reversable tubular basophilia were seen primarily in male rats at 25 mg/kg/day in 
both the 13- and 26-week study, as an example of rodent-specific chronic progressive nephropathy 
(CPN). Red pigment granules in pars convolute were noted in female rats in both the 13- and 26-week 
study from doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day in addition to hyaline droplet in males in the 26-week study. 
However, since the changes was reversible and not associated with histopathological lesions in the 
surrounding tissue, the Applicant did not consider them to be toxicologically important. This is 
supported. Additionally, in the 13-week i.v. rat study urinary output was transiently decreased from 
doses of ≥2.5 mg/kg/day, however, this could not be reproduced in the 26-week study, where a 
tendency toward increased urinary output were seen, if any. An effect on organ weight (i.e., decreased 
liver, heart, kidney, spleen and prostatic weight) were noted in males in the 4-week study, which could 
be related to the decreased BW. In female rats, a decrease in thyroid, thymus and heart weight were 
seen (significant at 25 mg/kg/day in the 4-week study), however, no corelating gross or 
histopathological findings were noted to explain the finding.  
The lowest NOAEL were set to 2.5 mg/kg/day in male rats based on testicular/epididymal changes in 
the 26-week study, whereas a NOAEL of 25 mg/kg/day were general for female rats across all three 
studies. The NOAEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day ensured a clinical exposure margin of approximately 211-fold, 
which is considered acceptable. All pivotal studies were conducted to GLP, as required according to 
guideline.   
Monkeys: An MTD of 4 mg/kg/day was estimated in a non-GLP i.v. dose range finding study in 
monkeys. However, it should be noted that rather severe clinical signs were still observed at this dose 
(i.e., lethargy, decreased activity, decrease faeces, reduced food consumption and BW in addition to 
sporadic occurrence of emesis, ataxia and intermittent tremors). Four pivotal GLP compliant repeat-

dose monkey studies were conducted with IV administration of difelikefalin, a 4-week, a 13-week and 
two 39-week studies. The two 39-week studies differed only by i.v. administration given as slow bolus 
or infusion respectively, however, major findings were to a large degree comparable between the 
studies. Mortality was noted in one female receiving 1 mg/kg/day in the 39-week study. Common for 
all four monkey studies, was the initiation of transient clinical signs of decreased activity, lethargy, 
decreased responsiveness, hunched position, sporadic vomiting and reduced food consumption with 
corresponding decreased BW primarily from dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day. The clinical signs exhibited a 
dose-dependent increased in incidence, duration and severity, but they were all transient and 
normalized over 1-3 weeks. This indicated that IV administration of difelikefalin may require some time 
of habituation and may be associated with discomfort during the first weeks of administration. 
However, as the findings were transient, they did not affect the determination of the NOAELs.     
A dose-dependent decrease in heart rate from dose of ≥0.25 mg/kg/day were noted primarily in 
female monkeys in the 4-week study. However, since no effect were seen on ECG or at histopathology 
and no corresponding findings were noted in the 13- and 39-week study at similar dose levels, the 
issue will not be further pursued.    
An effect on ovarian and uterus weight were seen the 4-week monkey study at dose ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day 
but not in any of the longer-term studies conducted in monkeys. Similar finding was noted in the 26-
week rat study, however, as no corresponding histopathological changes were noted, the relationship 
to difelikefalin is unclear but a potential link is expected to be further enlightened in the reproductive 
studies. Conversely to the rat studies, no testicular changes were observed in the monkeys.     
A significant decrease in urine volume were seen at dose of 0.06 mg/kg/day in the 13-week and in one 
of the 39-week monkey studies. It is acknowledged that the urine output normalized during the study. 
Similar findings were seen in the 13-week rat study and the applicant has provided a discussion, where 
dehydration due to decreased water consumption was highlighted as the main cause in rats.  
Pigment depositions corresponding to hemosiderin in lamina propria of the duodenum and in 
macrophages in the liver and spleen were sporadically occurring across all groups including the control 
group in the 4-week and the two 39-week studies. The findings were therefore considered to be a 
monkey-specific background finding, which was supported by literature. Additionally, presence of 
lipofuscin pigment in pars recta/pars convoluta of the renal proximal tubules, appeared to show a 
duration and dose-dependent pattern with occurrence at studies from 13-weeks of duration at doses 
from 0.25 mg/kg/day. However, the lipofuscin findings were considered non-adverse, as they were not 
associated with corresponding histopathological lesions, no effect was noted on kidney function and 
literature was presented in supported of the findings as background lesions.  
The lowest NOAELs in the conducted monkey studies were set to 0.25 mg/kg/day in the 4-week and in 
the 39-weeks studies. In the two remaining studies NOAEL≥1 mg/kg/day. Especially, in the 39-week 
study determination of NOAEL≥0.25 mg/kg/day was due to a potential difelikefalin-related death at 1 
mg/kg/day and clinical observations pronounced enough to require a single day dosing holiday. The 
NOAELs of 0.25 mg/kg/day ensured a clinical exposure margin of at least 50-fold in the 4-week study 
and much higher in the 39-week study, which is considered acceptable. All pivotal studies were 
conducted to GLP, as required according to guideline.   
Subcutaneous studies in mice and rats to support CARC: Studies with s.c. administration was 
conducted in mice and rats. For the current indication of i.v. difelikefalin treatment, the studies are 
mostly assessed with regards to dose support for the conducted CARC studies and the lack of GLP-
compliance for three out of four studies are therefore acceptable. Transient findings of decreased 
activity, impaired general condition and reduced food consumption with effect on BW were noted even 
at lower doses (≥1 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥3 mg/kg/day in mice) during the first weeks of 
administration in both mice and rats and corresponded largely with findings from the i.v. rat studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 27/89 
 
 
 
 
As previously addressed, this confirmed that both s.c. and i.v. administration of difelikefalin may be 
associated with discomfort during the first weeks of treatment and require some time of habituation. 
However, as the findings were transient it did not affect the setting of the NOAEL of 25 mg/kg/day in 
rats and an MTD in mice of 33 mg/kg/day, which is supported. Findings of CPN (i.e. evidenced by 
tubular basophilia) were also noted at long-term s.c. administration in rats with increasing severity 
and/or incidence compared with controls at doses of 25 mg/kg/day. CPN is an adverse effect in rats 
possibly exacerbated by the difelikefalin treatment, however, CPN is considered rat-specific and 
therefore not relevant to humans.    
In conclusion, the s.c. repeat-dose studies supported a maximum dose of 30 mg/kg/day in mice and 1 
mg/kg/day in rats for long-term treatment in the conducted CARC studies.   
Interspecies comparison: Safety margins was addressed in an extensive interspecies comparison table, 
comparing exposure (AUC) at NOAEL levels for the majority of non-clinical studies with human clinical 
exposure. As human patients are dosed at 3 days interval after HD, only human AUC0h-72h values were 
obtained. In order to compare animal AUC0h-24h with human AUC0h-72h for calculation of safety margins 
the following equation AUClast x 3/human AUC0h-72h was applied. This is accepted.     
The lowest safety margins based on exposure, observed in the repeat-dose studies in rats and 
monkeys were 211-fold and 50-fold respectively, which is considered acceptable. Safety margins for 
the conducted carcinogenicity and reproductive studies are also considered acceptable with the 
majority of studies being well above the clinical exposure, giving rise to many-fold safety margins. The 
lowest observed safety margin is in the embryofoetal developmental study in rabbits (5 to 30-fold), 
which is still considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of difelikefalin was studied in accordance with guideline (ICH S2(R1), 2011) and did 
not show mutagenic or clastogenic potential in Ames test, in vitro chromosome aberration test in 
human PBL cells and in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice. Ames test was conducted with 
the required bacterial strains with and without metabolic activation (S9). The use of concentration dose 
up to 5000 mcg/mL in the PBL cell study is accepted according to the old guideline (ICH S2A, 1995), 
under which the study was conducted. In conclusion all tests were GLP-compliant and considered 
adequately performed. No evidence for a relevant genotoxic potential of difelikefalin was detected.    
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Two GLP compliant carcinogenicity studies were conducted in accordance with ICH guideline S1B, a 26-
weeks transgenic mouse study and a 2-year study in SD rats. Both studies were conducted with s.c. 
administration, even though the intended clinical route of administration is IV. This was, however, 
sufficiently addressed by the applicant and considered acceptable, mainly based on the argument that 
TK assessments indicated that adequate exposure could be achieved by s.c. injection. In the 2-year rat 
study. The only significant neoplastic finding was an increase of pheochromocytomas in adrenal gland 
at mid dose in males only. This effect was not dose dependent and did not meet the significance level 
recommended for common tumours in rats (P≤0.0204 vs p≤0.01 for common tumours). Irrelevance of 
this single dose effect of adrenal pheochromocytoma in males is therefore acceptable. No other 
significant neoplastic findings were observed. In the medium-term transgenic bioassay in Tg.ras H2 
mice no treatment related effects on neoplastic or pre-neoplastic lesion were observed. The positive 
control exhibited the expected tumorigenic response showing validity of the study. 
A higher number of clinical adverse effect were noted in the transgenic mouse study compared to the 
rat study. However, this is expectable as the maximum dose of 30 mg/kg/day in the mice was close to 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 28/89 
 
 
 
 
the MTD determined in the s.c. repeat-dose studies, whereas the maximum dose in the rat CARC study 
was significantly lower than the NOAEL of 25 mg/kg/day estimated based on the s.c. repeat-dose 
studies in rats. As argued by the applicant, doses in the transgenic mouse were based on toxicity 
endpoints, whereas doses in the rat were based on PK endpoints (i.e., with an exposure multiple of ≥
25-fold over the exposure at the clinical dose), which is considered acceptable. The clinical signs noted 
in the transgenic mice were to a large degree comparable with previous observations, as were the 
transient clinical signs in the rats. Renal lesions of infarcts and/or tubular degeneration was observed 
to a larger degree in difelikefalin treated mice than in control animals, which potentially could be 
concerning as the intended difelikefalin patient group already is kidney compromised. However, it is 
agreed with the applicant that a clear relationship between the renal lesions and difelikefalin-treatment 
cannot be established in the mice, as the lesions generally were unilateral (not bilateral, as excepted 
due to systemic effect), without clear dose-response relationship and not associated with evidence of 
vascular events.  
In conclusion, difelikefalin was not carcinogenic in either male or female transgenic mice or SD rats 
compared with the concurrent control animals. 
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproduction and development were assessed in a fertility and early embryonic development study in 
rats, two embryofoetal development study in rats and rabbits, respectively, and a pre- and postnatal 
development study in rats. The conducted studies covered all stages of the reproductive process from 
premating to conception through weaning to sexual maturity of the F1 generation. All pivotal studies 
were conducted in accordance with GLP regulations and the current ICH S5 guideline.  
Fertility and early embryonic development: Findings of altered testicular weigh and 
testicular/epididymal degeneration was noted in the repeat-dose studies in rats. However, in the 
fertility and early embryonic development study, male fertility was evaluated based on mating 
performance, sperm assessments (morphology, motility, concentration), reproductive organ weight 
parameters (epididymides, prostate, seminal vesicles, testes), and histopathology of the 
testes/epididymides and no changes were noted in any of the parameters. Normal progression of the 
spermatogenic cycle and the expected cell associations and cell proportions in the various stages of 
spermatogenesis were present. Similar, for female animals, no effect was noted on fertility, pregnancy 
indices, or ovarian or uterine parameters. Persistent diestrus were noted, reaching statistical 
significance at doses ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day and resulting in a decreased number of estrous cycles per 14 
days and an increased in the mean number of days to mating. However, since the days to mating were 
within historical control and the fertility and pregnancy parameters where comparable across all 
groups, the relevance of the finding was considered to be of little toxicological concern. Nevertheless, 
the persistent diestrus was still taken into consideration when determining the NOAEL of 0.25 
mg/kg/day for female mating, which is supported.  
Clinical signs were transient and corresponded to findings from the repeat-dose studies in rats. As for 
the repeat-dose studies, a higher incidence and severity of clinical signs were noted in male rats and 
often at lower doses. The effects of difelikefalin were most prevalent during the first two weeks of the 
dose period, and in most cases, the clinical signs and effects on body weight gain had resolved before 
the initiation of mating. 
NOAEL for male and female fertility and EED was determined to 25 mg/kg/day, whereas the NOAEL for 
female mating was reduced to 0.25 mg/kg/day based on a potential effect on diestrus. Clinical 
exposure margin for fertility were several 1000 folds, whereas it was 15-fold for female mating.

Embryo-foetal development: In accordance with the ICH S5(R3) guideline, EFD studies was conducted 
in a rodent (rat) and a non-rodent species (rabbit) and difelikefalin was administered by IV injection 
from implantation to closure of the hard palate (GD7-17 in rats and GD7-19 in rabbits).  
In rats, doses of 0.25, 2.5 and 25 mg/kg/day was selected for the pivotal rat EFD study based on 
preliminary dose-range finding study, which is supported. No evidence of teratogenicity or difelikefalin-
related effect on embryofoetal development or maternal reproductive parameters (i.e. effects on 
ovarian or uterine parameters) were seen at any dose. The observed increased incidence of skeletal 
variations (i.e. wavy ribs and incomplete ossified ribs) were not considered adverse and did therefore 
not affect the EFD NOAEL of 25 mg/kg/day, which is in line with the ICH S5(R3) guideline for this type 
of changes and provides a safety margin to clinical exposure levels of 2133-fold.Clinical signs, 
corresponding with finding from the repeat-dose studies, were seen in the mother animals at doses of 
≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day and calling them transient is slightly misleading, as they occurred almost throughout 
the dosing period due to the short duration of the study. Thus, no maternal toxicity NOAEL was 
determined. NOAEL of the maternal reproductive function were determined to 25 mg/kg/day.  
In rabbit, doses of 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 was selected for the pivotal EFD study based on a combined 
tolerability (1st phase) and dose-range study in pregnant rabbits (2nd phase). The choice of a 
maximum dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day for the pivotal EFD study is supported, as maternal toxicity and 
foetal loss was detected at doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day. Nevertheless, in the 0.1 mg/kg/day group in the 
pivotal EFD study two animals died, respectively, prematurely at GD16 or aborted and was euthanized 
at GD23, most likely due to difelikefalin-related reduction in food consumption and severe BW loss.    
No evidence of teratogenicity or difelikefalin-related effect on embryofoetal development (i.e., survival, 
foetal body weights, gender distribution, external/soft tissue/skeletal abnormalities or ossification 
sites) was detected in the rabbit offspring. However, as for the rats, most findings were related to 
maternal toxicity initiating already at the lowest dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day with decreased BW/BW gain 
and food consumption, thin body condition and dehydration. The magnitude and persistence of the 
effect on BW and food consumption prevented the establishment of a NOAEL for maternal toxicity.     
Fewer pregnancies were observed at 0.1 mg/kg/day and a test article-related effect is suspected. 
However, it was speculated that the implantation disruption at 0.1 mg/kg/day could be secondary to 
the notable maternal toxicity observed at the high dose and not a direct foetal effect. An EFD NOAEL of 
0.1 mg/kg/day is therefore supported due to the lack of findings in the offspring and provides a safety 
margin to clinical exposure of 30-fold. Due to the reduction in pregnancies at 0.1 mg/kg/day but an 
absence of effect on ovarian or uterine parameters, the NOAEL for maternal reproductive function was 
determined to be 0.05 mg/kg/day. 
The pre- and postnatal developmental study was conducted in accordance with ICH S5(R3) guideline 
and covered an exposure period with dose of 0.6, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg/day from pregnancy in F0 
animals (GD7) through lactation (LD20) and the potential subsequent effect on F1 weaning, mating, 
implantation and gestation with evaluation of F1 foetuses (F2 animals). Hence, covering the full pre- 
and postnatal developmental period.  
As for the other studies, the most significant finding was clinical signs of transient maternal toxicity 
with a dose-dependent pattern from doses of ≥0.6 mg/kg/day and a persistent effect on BW/BW gain 
from dose of ≥2.5 mg/kg/day. NOAEL for F0 maternal toxicity was therefore determined to 0.6 
mg/kg/day. A potential effect on increased duration of gestation and number of stillborn pups at ≥2.5 
mg/kg/day were dismissed, as it is within the historical control of the facility, did not correspond with 
EFD findings and were mostly related to a high number of dead pups in a single litter. This explanation 
is considered acceptable.

No difelikefalin-related effect was seen in F1 animals including reproductive endpoints of the 
generation and no effect was noted in the F2 fetuses. The NOAEL for pre- and postnatal development 
were therefore determined to 10 mg/kg/day, which is supported. Data indicative of placental transfer 
of difelikefalin were noted in addition to evidence that difelikefalin is excreted into milk. Findings of 
excretion to milk is sufficiently addressed in the SmPC section 4.6. 
2.4.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics of difelikefalin was investigated in the pharmacokinetic studies, see section 2.4.3. 
2.4.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Perivascular irritancy of difelikefalin was considered to be slight but reversible, based on data from a 
SC local tolerance study in rabbits and evaluation of the local tolerance parameters from the conducted 
toxicity studies. Acute and chronic inflammation with fibroses and vessel necrosis/degeneration were 
seen in the 28-day i.v. monkey study, however, similar findings were not seen in the longer-term i.v. 
repeat-dose studies. Stand-alone local tolerance studies are generally not endorsed according to the 
ICH M3 guideline and the necessity of the rabbit study for the current indication is unclear.   
2.4.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity: Findings in the 4-week i.v. monkey study of thymic and splenic lymphoid depletion 
suggested a potential immune toxic effect even though similar findings were not detected in longer-
term monkey studies. However, based on the assessment of immune system parameters from the 13-
week rat and monkey studies, no difelikefalin-related immunotoxicity was expected at clinically 
relevant doses. 
Abuse potential and dependence: Abuse liability studies to study drug discrimination, self-
administration and withdrawal were conducted in accordance with ICH M3 guideline, as difelikefalin 
exhibits activity through the opioid receptor family even though only peripherally. The lack of GLP 
compliance and the use of rodents for the studies was considered acceptable according to guideline 
and the selected doses was based on prior PK/toxicology studies in rats in addition to dose range-
finding phases in the drug discrimination and self-administration studies.   
The conducted studies showed no evidence to support self-administration of difelikefalin with levels 
similar to saline control, difelikefalin did not induce a place preference and no signs of the withdrawal 
symptoms, as seen for the positive control, was noted for difelikefalin. The drug discrimination study 
demonstrated only a weak partial generalization (35% at 0.125 mg/kg) for difelikefalin indicating that 
difelikefalin did not share discriminative cues with (-)-pentazocine to the same extent as observed for 
butorphanol. Overall, it was concluded that difelikefalin was not likely to present a risk of physical 
dependence or a meaningful risk of an abuse potential at clinically relevant exposure, which is 
supported based on the submitted studies. The results correlated with difelikefalin being a selective 
KOR agonist with poor CNS penetration. Additionally, the results are also in line with the outcomes of 
the analysis of AEs from Phase 1 and Phase 3 clinical studies and a dedicated human abuse potential 
study.    
Impurities: No stand-alone toxicity studies have been conducted to qualify impurities and the 
impurities are therefore more thoroughly addressed in other parts of the report. Most of the impurities 
do not exceed the qualification limit of ICH Q3A(R2) and do not exceed the threshold of toxicological 
concern (TTC) of 1.5 mcg/day as set in ICH M7(R1), which is considered acceptable.

2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) covering phase I was submitted evaluating the potential 
environmental risks of difelikefalin (as the acetate) for IV treatment of pruritus associated with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD-aP) in adult patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD). The log Dow of difelikefalin 
(as the acetate) were determined experimentally as a function of pH to -2.11 at pH 5.0, -2.12 at pH 
7.0 and -1.74 at pH 9.0. The following method was used to determine the log Dow experimentally: 
Difelikefalin was mixed with octanol and buffered aqueous solution to form a mixture with a top 
organic solvent layer and a bottom aqueous buffer layer. Upon tumbling at room temperature for 24 
hours, an equilibrium of the distribution of difelikefalin between the two layers was reached. The two 
layers were then separated, and the partition coefficient was determined by means of LC-MS. The 
calculation of Fpen on a worst-case scenario is supported and it is agreed that a phase II assessment is 
not triggered based on the PECSURFACEWATER calculation (PECSURFACEWATER difelikefalin = 0.00045 µg/L), as 
the value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Furthermore, the Applicant has provided an evaluation 
of repeat-dose and reproductive toxicity studies showing that no evidence of endocrine disruption was 
seen for difelikefalin, which is supported.

Difelikefalin (as the acetate) PECSURFACEWATER value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a 
PBT substance as log KOW does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, difelikefalin is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The binding properties, functional activity and anti-inflammatory effects of difelikefalin were adequately 
characterized in pharmacodynamic in vitro and in vivo studies. A series of in vitro binding assays 
demonstrated that difelikefalin is a potent and full agonist at human, rat and mouse KORs with a slow 
receptor off-rate that might contribute to a long duration of activity in vivo. 
In vitro difelikefalin also displayed anti-inflammatory activity by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine 
production (e.g. IL-1, TNF-α, granulocyte colony stimulating factor) by human monocyte-derived 
macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and IFN-γ. The anti-inflammatory activity of 
difelikefalin is relevant to the antipruritic effect because CKD-aP in HD patients comprise an 
inflammatory component.  
The in vivo pharmacological activity of difelikefalin was evaluated in several mouse and rat studies. 
Species in which the drug was pharmacologically active. In addition, a high degree of overall homology 
for KORs, MORs, DORs and orphanin FQ (or nociception) receptors exists across vertebrate species. In 
vivo, i.v. difelikefalin (0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg) displayed potent, dose-dependent antipruritic effects in 
chemically induced mouse itch models when mice were dosed 15 minutes prior to administration of the 
Assessment report

pruritogens 5'-GNTI (KOR antagonist) and compound 48/80 (mast cell activator). The effective dose of 
compound at 50% of the ED50 value in the 5'GNTI- and compound 48/80-models was 0.05 and 0.08 
mg/kg i.v., respectively. Thus, the in vivo pharmacology studies also support that difelikefalin effect is 
mediated by peripheral KOR and suggest a lack of tolerance development. 
In vitro studies characterised potential secondary pharmacodynamic activity/binding and the data 
indicated that difelikefalin is unlikely to exhibit biologically relevant off-target activity. In addition, 
difelikefalin displayed no activity at the mu opioid receptors and delta opioid receptors in a functional 
assay.  
The safety pharmacology assessment of difelikefalin was carried out in accordance with the ICH S7A 
and ICH S7B guideline. In general, the effects on the CNS, including decreased locomotor function and 
abnormal posture and/or gait, occurred at doses that represented large exposure multiples of the 
maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) in the CKD-aP subjects undergoing HD at the 
proposed clinical dose of 0.5 µg/kg every 2 to 3 days. However, more relevant exposure multiples 
based on HED and AUCs were only 5-fold in a Pentobarbital Sleeping Duration study in mice, 13-fold at 
the LOAEL (lowest dose, 1 mg/kg) in the FOB in rats based on AUCs, which were bridged from a rat 
repeat-dose toxicity study at 1 mg/kg. Given that effects were already seen at the lowest dose in the 
FOB and no NOAEL could be determined, safety margins would even be lower at a no effect dose. 
Studies in rats of Sleep-Wake Cycle resulted in no safety margins based on AUC. These findings are in 
line with findings in all repeat-dose toxicity studies across species where CNS effects were reported 
already at the lowest doses. In addition, reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in placebo controlled 
and uncontrolled Phase 3 clinical trials were somnolence (1.1%), paraesthesia (including hypoesthesia, 
paraesthesia oral and hypoesthesia oral) (1.1%), dizziness (0.9%), headache (0.6%), nausea (0.7%), 
vomiting (0.7%), mental status changes (including confusional state) (0.3%) and diarrhoea (0.2%). It 
appears that even at clinically relevant doses, difelikefalin has CNS effects albeit only to a small extent 
with mild or moderate severity in patients. The data also indicated that difelikefalin represented a 
negligible risk for any notable adverse effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal 
systems. The SmPC and the RMP have been updated with appropriate warnings and measures to 
monitor these by the healthcare professionals and minimise the impact on patients. 
A pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction study was conducted to investigate the potential additive or 
synergistic effect on locomotor activity when difelikefalin was co-administered with the antihistamine, 
ketotifen. At a dose of 0.6 mg/kg, difelikefalin appeared to significantly potentiate the 30 mg/kg 
ketotifen-related decrease in locomotor activity. It is stated that these effects occur at high exposure 
multiples to the MRHD. However, in the pooled data of two well-controlled Phase 3 studies, subjects 
who used an antihistamine prior anti-itch medication (most common drugs used were antihistamines 
diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine) showed a higher risk of somnolence indicating that there is a drug-
drug interaction. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Toxicokinetics from pivotal toxicology studies were carried out in accordance with GLP consistent with 
the guideline S3A. In general, data in the intravenous repeat-dose studies in rats and monkeys 
demonstrated that exposure for both Cmax and AUC was roughly dose-proportional to slightly greater 
than dose-proportional, independent of sex and with a short half-life. Accumulation was generally not 
observed in rats, but moderate accumulation was observed in male and female monkeys. Following an 
i.v. injection, difelikefalin was relatively quickly distributed to tissues; highly distributed to the kidney, 
especially the renal cortex; and minimally distributed to the central nervous system in brain regions 
protected by the blood brain barrier. It was concluded that there were no gender-related differences in 
distribution of difelikefalin in rats and monkeys. Overall, the metabolism of difelikefalin was negligible 
in vitro and in rats and monkeys with no major metabolites identified, which is consistent with data 
from a human ADME study in healthy and HD subjects using [14C]-difelikefalin. The main route of 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 33/89 
 
 
 
 
excretion for difelikefalin was via the urine (57 to 74%) with lesser amounts found in the bile (13%) 
and faeces (13 to 37%) in rats and monkeys. 
In the i.v. repeat-dose studies in rats, the lowest NOAEL were determined to be 2.5 mg/kg/day in the 
26-week study due to degenerative changes in testis/epididymis of in male rats. A general NOAEL of 
25 mg/kg/day existed for female rats across all three studies. However, this still ensured an acceptable 
safety margin of 221-fold to clinical exposure for the lowest NOAEL. In monkeys, the lowest NOAELs 
were set to 0.25 mg/kg/day based on the 4-week and 39-weeks study and this ensured an acceptable 
clinical exposure margin of at least 50-fold for the 4-week study and much higher for the 39-week 
study. Transient signs of decrease activity, lethargy, decreased responsiveness and reduced food 
consumption with corresponding effect on BW gain were noted across species during the first weeks of 
difelikefalin administration at all doses, especially in male animals. However, as the findings were 
transient, they did not affect the setting of the NOAELs but indicated that a habituation period may 
exist for the treatment. Reassuringly, repeat-dose studies conducted with s.c. administration in mice 
and rats supported the dose selection for CARC studies and similar findings as for i.v. administration 
was noted. No evidence for a relevant genotoxic potential of difelikefalin was detected and no evidence 
for tumorigenic potential of difelikefalin was identified.  
No effect was seen on fertility, early embryonic development, teratogenicity in rats or rabbits, 
embryofetal development in rats or pre- and postnatal development. Maternal toxicity consistent with 
the transient findings from the conducted repeat-dose studies were detected at most doses in all 
studies. Local tolerance studies in rabbits showed a slight but reversible perivascular irritancy to 
difelikefalin. Furthermore, it was concluded that difelikefalin was not likely to present a risk of physical 
dependence or a meaningful risk of an abuse potential at clinically relevant exposure, which is 
endorsed by the CHMP. No concern regarding immunotoxicity, phototoxicity or impurities were 
identified.  
Difelikefalin PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, difelikefalin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacodynamic studies of difelikefalin demonstrated proof of 
concept and mode of action. Both the role of peripheral KORs in mitigating itch and inflammation, but 
also the effect of difelikefalin at these receptors was shown. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
indicated that difelikefalin displayed no off-target activity. From the safety pharmacology studies, no 
safety concern was identified. In general, the effects on the CNS occurred at doses that represent large 
exposure multiples of the Cmax in HD subjects with CKD-aP at the proposed maximum dose of 0.5 
µg/kg every 2 to 3 days. No pharmacodynamic drug interactions were expected. The 
pharmacodynamic and safety profile of difelikefalin was characterised in mice, rats, or monkeys, 
species in which the drug was pharmacologically active. In addition, there was a high degree of overall 
homology for KORs, MORs, DORs and orphanin FQ receptors across vertebrate species. 
The toxicokinetic data by intravenous route in rats and monkeys demonstrated that exposure for both 
Cmax and AUC was roughly dose-proportional to slightly greater than dose-proportional, independent of 
sex and with a short half-life. Accumulation was generally not observed in rats, but moderate 
accumulation was observed in male and female monkeys. Protein binding was low across all species. 
Distribution of difelikefalin to the CNS protected by the BBB was negligible in rats and monkeys with no 
increase in distribution over time. Metabolism of difelikefalin was negligible in animals with no major 
metabolites identified, consistent with data from a human ADME study in healthy and HD subjects

using [14C]-difelikefalin; the major route of elimination in animals was via urinary excretion. A battery 
of in vitro assays also suggested that clinically relevant drug interactions with difelikefalin was unlikely. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed that difelikefalin was well tolerated in relevant animal 
species and no major concerns was identified and the agreed SmPC adequately reflects the non-clinical 
profile of this medicinal product. Difelikefalin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods utilising LC-MS/MS analysis were validated to quantify the concentration of 
difelikefalin in K2EDTA plasma and in urine. Sample analysis were conducted at multiple analytical 
sites. The percentage of below limit of quantification (BLQ) samples in the oral studies were rather 
high and most BLQ samples occurred in the elimination phase. The PK parameters for difelikefalin were 
estimated using non-compartmental methods with WinNonlin. Pop PK analyses were conducted via 
nonlinear mixed effects modelling in NONMEM. A population PK data set was developed from the 
pooled data across difelikefalin studies with available PK information including oral and IV 
administration. The full analysis dataset was comprised of 811 subjects, contributing a total of 22,332 
observations. Of these, 3,488 samples were BLQ (15.6%). The BLQ samples were mainly from the oral 
studies (83%). Population and individual model parameters were estimated using stochastic 
approximation expectation maximization followed by Monte Carlo importance sampling. The final model 
parameters were re-estimated using Bayesian methods run across four chains, each with up to 5000 
burn-in iterations followed by 10,000 post-burn-in iterations. Parameter estimates were summarized 
across all four chains. A three-compartment population PK model with a first order rate of elimination 
could describe the exposure of difelikefalin i.v. data. Residual random effects were described by a 
proportional error model. Fixed effects of body weight were included on all CL and V terms using the 
typical values of 0.75 and 1, respectively. A full covariate model was constructed and included effects 
of age, AST and BILI on CL, and of MDRD on CL and V. 
The typical patient was 47 years old, weighed 78 kg, had an MDRD value of 83.502, a BILI value of 
8.552 and an AST value of 19. 
Absorption/distribution/metabolism/elimination: The applicant conducted a mass balance study to 
investigate the ADME characteristics of difelikefalin in healthy and HD subjects. Difelikefalin was 
eliminated primarily in the urine in healthy volunteers (80.5%) and primarily in faeces and dialysate, 
58.8 % and 19.5 % respectively, in HD subjects.  As expected, the Cmax was similar, but AUC 
increased for HD subjects compared with healthy subjects. Metabolism appears to be minimal as the 
most prevalent metabolite (MP1) accounted for 0.48% and 0.10% of total plasma exposure in healthy 
volunteers and HD subjects respectively. 
Plasma protein binding was evaluated in two clinical studies: in subjects with normal renal function and 
subjects with mild, moderate and severe impairment of renal function, and in subjects on 
haemodialysis. Plasma protein binding of difelikefalin ranges from 24 to 32 % and remains unaffected 
by renal impairment. Mean volume of distribution at steady state ranged from 145 to 189 mL/kg in 
healthy subjects and from 214 to 301 mL/kg in HD patients. 
The primary route of elimination for difelikefalin in the target population, HD patients, is faecal, 
accounting on average for about 59 % of the dose; about 19 % were recovered in dialysate; and about 
11 % were found in urine. In healthy subjects, the primary route of elimination for difelikefalin is renal, 
accounting for about 81 % of the dose being excreted in urine as compared to 11 % via faecal 
excretion. In HD patients mean total clearance decreased and half-lives increased about 10-fold with 
ranges of 5.3 to 7.5 mL/h/kg and 23 to 31 hours, respectively, compared to healthy subjects (54 to 71 
mL/h/kg and mean half-lives from 2 to 3 hours). Difelikefalin is not metabolized in neither HD nor 
subjects with normal kidney function. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency: There was a proportionate increase in PK exposure 
between the 8.0 mcg/kg and 24 mcg/kg difelikefalin dosages in female subjects when administered the 
day following elective laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomy. Dose proportionality was also established 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 37/89 
 
 
 
 
across the dose range studied (0.5 to 2.5 mcg/kg) in haemodialysis patients on both day 1 and at 
steady state. PK analysis from two phase 2 studies in the target population showed steady-state 
concentrations were generally observed 44 hours after the first dose. Accumulation of difelikefalin with 
respect to AUC values was low; mean relative accumulation (RA) values varied between 1.08 and 1.33 
for the 3 dose levels. The mean RA for Week 8 Cmax was also low and varied between 0.873 and 1.28 
across all doses. 
Minimal accumulation was observed (mean accumulation ratios: 1.0 to 1.2) in the target population. 
After an initial distribution phase, plasma concentrations of difelikefalin in HD subjects decrease slowly 
until mostly cleared during HD. Data on accumulation is reported from all 3 studies with repeated 
administration in HD subjects. Although AUC accumulation is mild, there is a great variability of 50 to 
70% in this parameter among patients. While the usual dosing regimen includes 3 doses per week, the 
applicant enables to use one extra dose if 4th haemodialysis during a week is performed. Based on the 
dossier review, it however seems that PK data for such a situation are not available.  
Variability: The intraindividual variability data shown from the Pop-PK model were low with 18.2%. The 
interindividual variability in healthy volunteer’s single dose studies was low, with most coefficient of 
variation values <20% for all parameters across all doses. interindividual variability data are shown 
from the Pop Pk model and mostly explained by few covariates. The available data on interindividual 
variability suggest that it is usually high (above 30%) in HD subjects at 0.5 mcg/kg. For example, in 
the study 2101 the CV% was at week 8 around 40% for AUC, 76% for Thalf and 76% for Cmax. 
However, the number of subjects in two PK evaluations was low (7 and 9 subjects) which could 
increase the variability itself. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In study 1003 the mean CL values of difelikefalin in HD subjects (8 to 16 mL/min) were significantly 
less than in normal subjects resulting in a t½ that was ~10-fold longer (17.9 to 24.3 hours) with 
plasma exposures that were ~3- to 6-fold higher than those established at comparable doses in normal 
subjects. Dialysis clearance was similar across the 3 and 6 mcg/kg dose groups and was substantially 
higher than plasma clearance (128 and 143 mL/min, respectively). The target population for 
difelikefalin i.v. formulation is subjects with CKD undergoing HD. The PK properties of difelikefalin were 
assessed in subjects with normal renal function as well as those with CKD who require HD. There were 
9 clinical studies where the PK of difelikefalin was evaluated in subjects with normal renal function, 
seven studies were conducted in the HD patient population and one study evaluated the PK of 
difelikefalin in subjects with normal renal function as well as mild, moderate and severe renal 
impairment. Difelikefalin was substantially, but incompletely cleared from plasma by a 4-hour dialysis 
session. On average, a 4-hour dialysis session resulted in a 79% (CV=4.15%) reduction in plasma 
difelikefalin concentration. Mean t½ following oral and IV dosing was 26.6 and 22.9 hours, 
respectively. The mean (SD) Cextracted% was 79% (3.26). Individual reduction values ranged from 70.3 
to 82.1%. The mean (90% CI) absolute bioavailability of difelikefalin was 0.085 (0.044, 0.160). 
Special populations 
PK in special populations has been investigated in patients with severe renal impairment and Japanese 
patients. The Pop-PK model was used to describe PK in special populations further. No other special 
population studies were conducted. Hepatic function has little impact on the PK of difelikefalin since it 
is essentially not metabolized. There are no standalone studies evaluating i.v. difelikefalin in 
hepatically impaired patients. However, the population PK model indicated that difelikefalin exposure in 
subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was similar to those with normal hepatic function. 
Therefore, no dose adjustments are recommended for HD subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment. Because insufficient PK data are available for HD subjects with severe hepatic impairment, 
Assessment report

PK and any dose adjustments in this patient population could not be assessed or predicted. The SmPC 
is adequately updated. 
The posology for difelikefalin is weight-based and any impact of weight therefore already considered. It 
is planned to market a 1 mL vial in EU. With the weight-based dosing, subjects above 104 kg dry body 
weight will need two vials. Since weight has not been included as a covariate in the PopPK model, the 
impact on weight on exposure is unknown. The PK development programme encompasses weights 
from 40 to 129 kg in i.v. studies.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Results of in vitro studies indicate that difelikefalin is metabolically stable and is not a significant 
inhibitor or substrate for clinically relevant enzymes and transporters. No drug-drug interaction studies 
have been performed. Because difelikefalins major clearance pathway is excretion of the unchanged 
parent compound into urine dialysate, and/or faeces and difelikefalin is not a 
substrate/inhibitor/enhancer of any CYP enzymes or transporter proteins, it should not significantly 
affect the clearance and/or metabolism of any co -administered drug and the clearance and/or 
metabolism should not be impacted by the co-administration of other drugs.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Not applicable. 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Difelikefalin is a selective KOR agonist with no activity at mu and delta-opioid receptors, and no off-
target activity detected at a comprehensive panel of >120 additional receptors, ion channels, or 
transporters, as demonstrated by binding and/or functional assays. Difelikefalin has been shown to 
have minimal to no penetration into the CNS in non-clinical studies.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
A phase 2 proof of concept study 2005 showed statistically significant reduction in itch intensity as 
measured by the change from baseline to the average of Week 2 worst itching scores (P=.02) and 
improvement in itch-related quality of life (QoL) (based on the Skindex-10 scale) (P=.03) with 
difelikefalin treatment in HD subjects with moderate-to-severe pruritus which supports the claimed 
mode of action. 
Difelikefalin had aquaretic effects in healthy male subjects, with a statistically significant increase in 
the volume of urine excreted over the 12 hours after dosing for all doses of the substance in 
comparison to placebo, with the exception of the lowest dose of 0.002 mg/kg of difelikefalin. The 
increase in urine output did not appear to be associated with a decrease in vasopressin levels, 
increased urine osmolality or increased electrolyte excretion. Thus, this change is of no concern in the 
target population with little to no kidney function. 
In a phase 1 study in healthy subjects difelikefalin caused a rapid and marked increase in serum 
prolactin concentrations. Prolactin levels returned to normal within 12 to 24 hours and were of no 
clinical concern. No TEAEs potentially indicative of the effects of hyperprolactinemia were reported. In 
phase 2 study PR-13A9-P2-A in subjects undergoing HD and experiencing CKD-aP, a dose-dependent 
drop in levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone was observed on the fourth dialysis day of the 
administration period in the dose groups 1 and 1.5 μg/kg, however this decrease had resolved at the 
end of the observation period. No changes were seen in the 0.5 μg/kg group. Only few thyroid related 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 39/89 
 
 
 
 
AEs were reported and there is no concern regarding the impact of difelikefalin on the hypothalamic-
pituitary-thyroid axis. 
A 4-way crossover study assessing the abuse potential of difelikefalin in healthy, recreational polydrug 
users with lifetime and recent hallucinogenic use, showed that difelikefalin produced some “drug liking” 
compared to placebo, however significantly lower Drug Liking VAS Emax, with no evidence of a dose-
relation when compared to pentazocine (a C-IV KOR agonist/MOR partial agonist). 
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects undergoing haemodialyis was 
conducted to assess the potential of physical withdrawal from difelikefalin. Patients treated with 
difelikefalin for 3 weeks, switching to placebo for 2 weeks did not elicit clinical signs or symptoms of 
withdrawal, as measured by maximum COWS total score, relative to subjects who continued treatment 
with difelikefalin. Data of the randomised, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled, four-way 
crossover study to assess the effects of CR845 at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses on cardiac 
repolarization (QTc) following single IV dose administration relative to placebo in healthy adult male 
and female subjects showed no clinically significant effect of CR845 on heart rate, PR interval, or QRS 
duration. The largest placebo corrected change from baseline for heart rate was 8.0 bpm, occurring in 
the 3.0 mcg/kg treatment group 4 hours following dosing.  
Dose-response relationship: Dose-response relationship was investigated a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study where 3 dose levels of difelikefalin (1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 mcg/kg) were evaluated 
relative to placebo in HD subjects with moderate-to-severe pruritus. The systemic exposure of 
difelikefalin increased with dose, however dose proportionality over the 0.5 to 1.5 mcg/kg dose range 
could not be concluded. Both, the Cmax and AUC for 0.5 and 1.0 mcg/kg doses were proportional, but 
both parameters for the 1.5 mcg/kg dose were lower than expected at the highest dose. The reason 
for this behavior and difference from historical data is unknown.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic properties of difelikefalin were studied in a multitude of studies described in the 
dossier. Overall, the studies are considered appropriately designed and conducted, especially PK data 
from the target population was collected which is endorsed. The study populations contain different 
ages, sex, weight, race and are considered in whole representative for the population to be treated as 
well as adequate for exploring the pharmacokinetic properties of difelikefalin. Difelikefalin penetration 
into the central nervous system has been studied in the non-clinical setting and is assumed to be very 
limited and of no clinical concern. However, CNS-related adverse events like mental status changes, 
dizziness and somnolence are observed and the relevant information has been included in the SmPC 
for the healthcare professional treating the patients. 
Mild to moderate hepatic impairment seemed not to have any impact on the PK of difelikefalin. It is 
therefore acceptable that the SmPC does not provide dose recommendations for the mild to moderate 
hepatically impaired. It is acknowledged that difelikefalin is not metabolized, but there is no clinical 
data on the pharmacokinetics of difelikefalin in HD subjects with severe hepatic impairment and this is 
reflected in the SmPC including relevant recommendation for prescribers. A fixed effect of weight was 
used in the Pop PK model. The posology for difelikefalin is weight-based and any impact of weight 
therefore already considered.  
The PK development programme encompasses weights from 40 to 129 kg in IV studies. The applicant 
provides dosing recommendations also for patients whose weight is above 129 kg. Weight has been 
included as a covariate in the POP PK model through allometrically scaled model parameters. This 
approach might be appropriate for dose determination in obese patients, especially considering 
physical and PK characteristics of difelikefalin. Dose-capping was implemented by the applicant at 200 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 40/89 
 
 
 
 
kg in order to prevent excessive exposure in obese patients. The applicant showed with simulation that 
this approach leads to exposures comparable with non-obese patients. The pop PK showed no effect of 
subject race or gender on difelikefalin exposure. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of difelikefalin is 
not altered in the elderly. The investigated patients ranged from 25 to 80 years of age and thus, the 
population is considered appropriate to conclude that no dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly. 
There are no data available in paediatric subjects. The date for completion of the PIP is March 2026. 
The lack of information on the paediatric population is reflected in the SmPC. 
The applicant discussed the potential for abuse comprehensively. The results from the abuse liability 
study in humans showed that increasing the dose of difelikefalin to 15 µg/kg did not increase the small 
drug liking signal, whereas drugs of abuse usually show strong dose-response functions. Along with not 
producing physical dependence and the fact that difelikefalin is administered by hospital staff after 
dialysis only, the conclusion that it does not hold abuse potential is accepted.  
For patients with intact blood-brain-barrier the potential for pharmacodynamic interactions with other 
medicinal products or substances is considered to be very low. However, concerns have been raised 
regarding the observed CNS symptoms in the target population. Relevant wording has been added in 
section 4.4. of the SmPC. Although AUC accumulation is mild, there is a great variability of 50 to 70% 
in this parameter among patients. A statement on variability has been added in Section 5.2 of the 
SmPC: “The available data on interindividual variability in haemodialysis subjects receiving 0.5 
microgram/kg difelikefalin suggest that variability of AUC can exceed 30%.” 
The selection of a difelikefalin dose of 0.5 mcg/kg for the Phase 3 studies seems meaningful as the 
efficacy seen across dose groups was similar and dose-response trends observed in the safety results 
achieved the most favourable benefit-risk profile. Doses greater than 0.5 mcg/kg did not appear to 
provide any additional treatment benefit and the selection of the minimally effective dose is endorsed. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology testing concerning PK, PD effects of difelikefalin is sufficient and results are 
adequately reflected in the product information and in the agreed RMP. The CHMP did not considers 
any measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology in the post-marketing phase. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Difelikefalin full clinical development programme, consisted of 18 completed clinical studies. The 
efficacy evaluation focuses on results of the 2 pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, CR845-CLIN3102 and 
CR845-CLIN3103, which evaluated the efficacy of difelikefalin versus placebo in double-blind treatment 
periods of 12 weeks duration (see table below). Study CR845-CLIN3102 was conducted in the US while 
CR845-CLIN3103 was a global study with sites in the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.  
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 41/89 
 
 
 
 
2.5.5.1.  Dose response studies 
In the supportive dose-ranging study CR845-CLIN2101, which examined the efficacy of 3 doses of 
difelikefalin (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mcg/kg), IV treatment with difelikefalin after each HD session (3 
times/week) over an 8-week period resulted in a significant reduction in itch intensity in HD subjects 
with moderate-to-severe pruritus, which was further supported by significant improvement in multiple 
itch-related QoL measurements (e.g., sleep, mood, and social functioning) compared with placebo. 
This study included a post-hoc evaluation of the percentage of subjects achieving a ≥3 or ≥4-point 
improvement in the WI-NRS. The percentage of subjects with ≥3-point improvement in the weekly 
mean WI-NRS score by Week 8 was significantly higher for the 0.5 mcg/kg (62.4%, P=.003) dose 
group compared with placebo (29.5%). The percentage of subjects with ≥4-point improvement in the 
weekly mean WI-NRS score by Week 8 was significantly higher for the 0.5 mcg/kg (48%, P=.019)

difelikefalin group. No apparent dose-response in antipruritic efficacy was observed among the 3 doses 
(0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mcg/kg) studied in CR845-CLIN2101. Based on the similar efficacy across dose 
groups and dose-response trends observed in the safety results, a difelikefalin dose of 0.5 mcg/kg 
appeared to achieve the most favourable benefit-risk profile and was thus selected as the dose to be 
further evaluated in the phase 3 studies.  
2.5.5.2.  Main studies 
Title of study: CR845-CLIN3102 and CR845-CLIN3103: A Multicentre, Double-Blind, 
Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous 
CR845 in Haemodialysis Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Pruritus, with a 52-Week Open-
Label Extension 
Methods 
Studies CR845-CLIN3102 and CR845-CLIN3103 were Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, 12-week 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of difelikefalin at a dose of 
0.5 mcg/kg. Difelikefalin was administered after each HD session 3 times a week in subjects with 
moderate-to-severe pruritus (due to end stage renal disease) who were undergoing HD. Both studies 
included a double-blind phase and an OLE phase (see figure below). During the double-blind phase in 
both studies, an interim analysis was conducted in order to adjust for final sample size. 
The eligible subjects at the end of the 7-day Run-in Period were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either difelikefalin 0.5 mcg/kg or placebo in the double-blind treatment period. Subjects were stratified 
according to their use or non-use of concomitant medications to treat pruritus during the week prior to 
randomization (Run-in Period), as well as the presence or absence of specific medical conditions (e.g., 
falls/fractures due to falls, gait disturbance, and mental status change). 
Interim Analysis: During the double-blind phase an interim analysis was planned to be conducted when 
approximately 50% of the planned sample size was randomised. The interim analysis was performed 
by an independent data monitoring committee with a prespecified charter. The IDMC was to 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022

recommend extending, or maintain, final sample size dependent on the conditional power obtained 
from an unblinded interim analysis and a set of predefined ranges of the conditional power. This 
together with masked descriptive and comparative results, i.e., actual name of treatment group 
masked, was provided to the Applicant. 
Open-label Extension Phase: Subjects who received at least 30 doses of study drug (either placebo or 
active) during the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period and continued to meet other eligibility 
criteria had the option to receive open-label difelikefalin for an additional period of up to 52 weeks. 
Each subject received difelikefalin at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg after each HD session, 3 times per week, 
regardless of whether he/she had been previously administered placebo or difelikefalin. Whenever an 
extra dialysis was performed, the study drug was administered after each additional dialysis session up 
to a maximum of 4 times per week. 
Follow-up Period: For all subjects in both studies, a follow-up visit of 7 to 10 days was planned after 
the End-of-Treatment/Early Termination Visit. 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria: The eligible subjects were male or female, 18 years of age or older, with end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) and had been undergoing HD 3 times per week for at least 3 months prior to the 
start of screening, had a prescription dry body weight between 40.0 and 135.0 kg inclusive, had at 
least 2 single-pool measurements ≥1.2 for [dialyzer clearance of urea × dialysis time] / volume of 
distribution of urea (or Kt/V), or at least 2 urea reduction ratio measurements ≥65%, or 1 single-pool 
Kt/V measurement ≥1.2 and 1 urea reduction ratio measurement ≥65% on different dialysis days 
during the 3-month period prior to screening, had completed at least 4 WI-NRS worksheets prior to 
randomization, had a mean baseline WI-NRS score >4 (CLIBN3102) or ≥5 (CLIN3103), defined as the 
average of all non-missing pre-randomization scores for the seven daily assessments before 
randomisation. 
Exclusion Criteria: A subject was excluded from the Double-blind Phase of the study if he/she was 
scheduled to receive a kidney transplant during the study; had known history of allergic reaction to 
opiates, such as hives; had a concomitant disease or a history of any medical condition such as known 
or suspected history of alcohol, narcotic, or other drug abuse, or substance dependence within 12 
months prior to screening, significant systolic or diastolic heart failure, severe mental illness or 
cognitive impairment, any other relevant acute or chronic medical or neuropsychiatric condition within 
3 months prior to screening; had received new or changed treatment for itch, including antihistamines, 
corticosteroids, opioids, gabapentin, or pregabalin within 14 days prior to screening; had received 
another investigational drug within 30 days prior to the start of screening or was planning to 
participate in another clinical study while enrolled in this study; in the opinion of the investigator, had 
pruritus attributed to a cause other than ESRD or its complications; had localized itch restricted to the 
palms of the hands; had pruritus only during the haemodialysis session; was receiving ongoing 
ultraviolet B treatment and anticipated receiving such treatment during the study; had participated in a 
previous clinical study with difelikefalin.  
•  Treatments 
Subjects received difelikefalin at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg or placebo after each haemodialysis session, 
generally 3 times per week for up to 64 weeks (12 weeks as double-blind treatment and 52 weeks as 
open-label treatment). A maximum of 4 doses per week was allowed.  
•  Objectives 
Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of IV difelikefalin 0.5 mcg/kg in reducing the intensity of itch.  
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 44/89 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary: To evaluate the efficacy of IV difelikefalin 0.5 mcg/kg in improving the itch-related quality 
of life and to evaluate the safety of difelikefalin 0.5 mcg/kg. 
For all comparative analyses covered by the control of family wise type 1 error, the hypotheses tested 
was formulated as superiority. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint in the two phase 3 studies was the event of 
achieving at least 3-point reduction (i.e., improvement) from baseline with respect to the weekly mean 
of the daily 24-hour WI-NRS at Week 12 of the Double-blind Treatment Period. At most 3 daily 
assessments were required to construct the average, if not it was set to missing. Subjects were in the 
screening period instructed/trained on the use of the PRO tools. For the WI-NRS, it was documented 
how it was constructed and shown fit-for -purpose prior to the phase 3 studies. Daily assessments in 
WI-NRS were instructed to be performed at a similar time at day, whether at home, or during dialysis 
days, at site. 
Secondary endpoints: Key secondary endpoints are listed in table below: 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, using a central IWRS. Randomization was stratified according 
to their use or non-use of concomitant medications to treat their itch during the week prior to 
randomization (run-in period) as well as the presence or absence of specific medical conditions (History 
of fall or fracture (related to fall), confusional state or mental status change or altered mental status or 
disorientation, Gait disturbance or movement disorder) for a total of 4 strata. During the Double-blind 
Treatment Period, subjects, investigators, study staff, and the sponsor were blinded to study drug 
assignment.  
Both studies included a planned single IA for sample size re-estimation, which was agreed as 
appropriate by the FDA, to be conducted after approximately 50% of the first 350 randomized subjects 
either completed the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period or discontinued study drug prematurely. 
The IA was implemented by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) who could decide 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 45/89 
 
 
 
 
  
either to keep the original sample size of 350 or to increase it to up to 500 subjects based on the 
conditional power of the primary and key secondary endpoints of the protocols, and the respective 
IDMC charters. The study team was blinded to IA results until after the database lock. 
•  Statistical methods 
Sample size: The planned sample size of 350 subjects (175 per treatment group) in each trial was 
chosen to provide up to 96% power to detect a treatment difference between placebo and difelikefalin 
for the proportion of subjects with a ≥3-point improvement from baseline in WI-NRS scores at Week 12 
using a 2-sided continuity corrected Chi-square test, assuming a placebo response of 30% and a 
difelikefalin response ranging from 46% to 50% (based on estimates of response consistent with 
results from Phase 2 study CR845-CLIN2101). This sample size also provided adequate power (≥80%) 
to detect a treatment difference with respect to the proportion of subjects with a ≥4-point improvement 
from baseline. According to IA for sample size re-estimation, for CR845-CLIN3102, the sample size 
was not increased (378 subjects were included in the intent-to-treat [ITT] population). For CR845-
CLIN3103, the planned sample size was increased to 430 as per recommendation from the IDMC (473 
subjects were included in the ITT population).  
Analyses: To counter the bias associated with the interim analysis and to maintain control of the family 
wise error rate on the statistical inference at the end of the study, test statistics and estimates on 
treatment effects and their difference were adjusted according to Hung, Lawrence respectively Cui, 
Hung, Wang. 
Missing values of weekly averages of WI-NRS was imputed using a multiple imputation approach within 
each treatment group: intermittent missing values by MCMC and otherwise by monotone regression 
using baseline scores, stratification factors and non-missing scores during treatment. The applied MI 
process was completely independently among subjects contributing the interim results and those 
following the interim analysis. The family wise error rate was controlled by applying a hierarchical test 
strategy for the primary and key secondary endpoints as they are listed in the table above. Treatment 
groups were compared by means of logistic regression, modelling the probability being a responder 
(i.e. having a reduction of at least 3 in average weekly WI-NRS scores), with effects representing 
treatment, baseline score and stratification factors.  
Sensitivity analyses: A series of sensitivity analyses was performed using the same modelling, but for 
different approaches on handling missing values: 
• 
Early discontinuations and/or termination of drug use regarded as being non-responders 
•  Multiple imputation, assuming not missing at random: intermittently missing by MCMC, and 
otherwise either by sampling from baseline distribution, in case discontinuation was done due 
to presence of an AE, or for other reasons by the observed WI-NRS profile from non-missing 
scores in the same time period within the corresponding treatment group. 
• 
Tipping point analysis: a variant to the MI used for the primary analysis, in which non-
intermittent missing values in the active treatment groups are imputed progressively in a 
series of analyses with different shift parameters in order to investigate any departures from 
the missing at random assumption. 
•  No adjustment for interim: similar to primary analysis by without adjustment of estimates and 
test statistic. 
• 
Per protocol population analysis 
Analyses on key secondary binary endpoints: Missing values for of weekly average WI-NRS scores for 
secondary endpoints will imputed in an identical manner as was applied to the primary endpoint. 
Missing values of 5-D Itch and Skindex-10 will be imputed for each domain within a questionnaire in a 
manner identical to the weekly average WI-NRS scores. The 5-D Itch and Skindex-10 total scores at 
week 12 was compared between treatment groups by means of an ANCOVA model, with effects

Page 46/89 
 
 
 
 
corresponding to treatment, baseline score, region and stratification. For sensitivity purpose a Mixed 
Model Repeated Measurement model were used without any imputation. Key secondary endpoints of 
same nature as the primary, i.e., derived from weekly average of WI-NRS at some time point and 
using a threshold for the responder definition, was analysed by the same model and method of 
imputation as was used for the primary analysis. 
Subgroups: Pooled analyses for the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint of ≥4-point 
improvement in WI-NRS was conducted for the ITT population on the following subgroups: age 
categories (<65 years, ≥65 years), gender (male, female), race, geographic region, stratification 
factors (anti-itch medication use during the Run-in Period, presence of specific medical conditions).

•  Conduct of the study 
For CR845-CLIN3102, prior to the interim analysis, minor changes to the SAP were made regarding 
data handling for subjects who reported WI-NRS scores after discontinuing study drug; all changes 
were finalized prior to the interim analysis, and no additional changes were made to the primary 
analysis between Versions 1.1 and 2.0 of the SAP. For CR845-CLIN3103, all changes were finalized 
prior to the interim analysis, and no changes were made to the primary alpha-controlled analysis 
between Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the SAP. 
•  Baseline data 
CR845-CLIN3102: Sixty-one percent (61.0%) was male, and the median age was 58.0 years (range 22 
to 88 years). The majority of subjects (214 subjects [56.8%]) were in the age group ≥45 to <65

years; 30 subjects (8.0%) were age 75 years or older. 10.6% of subjects aged ≥75 years were enrolled 
in the placebo group versus 5.3% in the difelikefalin group. The predominant races were white 
(48.8%) and black or African American (41.6%), and the predominant ethnicity was non-Hispanic/non-
Latino (64.5%). The median prescription dry body weight was 84.00 kg (range 42.0 to 135.0 kg). The 
median duration of CKD-aP for all subjects was 2.50 years (range 0.1 to 26.5 years), and the median 
WI-NRS score at baseline was 7.14 (range 4.1 to 10.0). At the baseline, 39.8% of subjects were using 
anti-itch medications (a stratification factor), and 14.1% reported at least 1 of the specific medical 
conditions used for stratification (History of fall or fracture (related to fall), confusional state or mental 
status change or altered mental status or disorientation, or gait disturbance or movement disorder). 
The median time intervals since the diagnoses of CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for all 
subjects were 5.45 years (range 0.3 to 42.9 years) and 3.92 years (range 0.3 to 28.7 years), 
respectively. The median time interval of undergoing chronic HD was 3.32 years (range 0 to 26.5 
years). The most common (≥20% of all subjects) aetiologies of CKD were hypertension (71.1%) and 
diabetes (53.3%), although multiple aetiologies could be reported. 
CR845-CLIN3103: Males represented 58.2% of population (274 out of 471 total subjects), and the 
median age of all subjects was 60.0 years (range 23 to 87 years). Slightly over half of subjects (243 
subjects [51.6%]) were in the age group ≥45 to <65 years; 68 subjects (14.4%) were age 75 years or 
older. The predominant races were white (70.3%) and black or African American (19.3%), the 
predominant ethnicity was non-Hispanic/non-Latino (69.9%), and the predominant regions were the 
US (59.0%) and Eastern Europe (24.2%). The median prescription dry body weight was 78.00 kg 
(range 42.0 to 135.0 kg). The median duration of CKD-aP for all subjects was 2.28 years (range 0.0 to 
58.4 years), and the median baseline WI-NRS score was 7.13 (range 4.5 to 10.0). At baseline, 36.5% 
of subjects were using anti-itch medications (a stratification factor), and 16.6% reported at least 1 of 
the specific medical conditions used for stratification. The median time intervals since the diagnosis of 
CKD and ESRD for all subjects were 7.53 years (range 0.3 to 48.3 years) and 4.03 years (range 0.3 to 
30.2 years), respectively. The median time interval of undergoing chronic HD was 3.86 years (range 
0.3 to 30.2 years). The most common (≥20% of all subjects) aetiologies of CKD were hypertension

•  Outcomes and estimation 
CR845-CLIN3102 - Primary endpoint 
In Study CR845-CLIN3102, 51.0% of difelikefalin subjects versus 27.6% placebo subjects met the 
primary efficacy endpoint by achieving a ≥3-point improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS at Week 12 
(odds ratio = 2.72; P <.001).

CR845-CLIN3102 – Key secondary endpoints 
At the end of Week 12, change from baseline in the total 5-D Itch Scale score for difelikefalin and 
placebo were (LS mean) -5.0 and -3.7, respectively (P <.001) (Table 20) and change from baseline in 
the total Skindex-10 Scale score for difelikefalin and placebo were (LS mean) -17.2 and -12.0, 
respectively (P <.001) (Table 17). The proportion of subjects achieving a ≥4-point improvement in WI-
NRS from baseline at Week 12, were consistent with the primary endpoint; 38.9% (LS mean) of 
subjects treated with difelikefalin and 18.0% subjects treated with placebo achieved a ≥4-point 
improvement in WI-NRS from baseline (odds ratio = 2.89; P <.001).  
CR845-CLIN3103 - Primary endpoint 
In Study CR845-CLIN3103, the percentage of difelikefalin and placebo subjects achieving a ≥3-point 
improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS at Week 12 were 54.0% and 42.2% (odds ratio = 1.61; P = 
.020).  
The proportion of ITT subjects achieving a ≥3-point improvement in the mean 24-hour WI-NRS scores 
from baseline at Week 12 by use of anti-itch medications at baseline (stratification variable). The 
subjects using anti-itch medications at baseline had a greater treatment difference (odds ratio = 2.15; 
95% CI, 1.09 to 4.25) favouring difelikefalin than subjects not using anti-itch medications at baseline 
(odds ratio = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.84 to 2.20). 
CR845-CLIN3103 – Key secondary endpoints 
For the first key secondary endpoint, a greater proportion of subjects who received difelikefalin than 
placebo achieved a ≥4-point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline at Week 12 (41.2% versus 28.4%; 
odds ratio = 1.77; P = .010). 
A greater percentage of difelikefalin subjects than placebo subjects achieved a ≥3-point improvement 
(reduction) in WI-NRS at Week 8 (49.0% versus 36.2%; P = .010) and Week 4 (38.3% versus 23.8%; 
P = .002). For a ≥4-point improvement in WI-NRS, there were 36.1% difelikefalin subjects versus 
23.7% placebo subjects at Week 8 (P = .010) and 26.1% versus 16.7% at Week 4 (P = .036). With

respect to the time course of WI-NRS improvement, treatment group differences in favour of 
difelikefalin were observed as early as Week 2 for a ≥3-point reduction and as early as Week 3 for a ≥4-
point reduction, which were maintained throughout the remainder of the Double-blind Treatment 
Period (Figure below).    
The final 2 secondary endpoints in the hierarchy were change in the total Skindex-10 Scale score and 
the total 5-D Itch Scale score from baseline to the end of Week 12. At week 12, the treatment group 
difference for LS mean reduction in total Skindex-10 Scale score was -1.8 (P = .171). Subsequently, 
the reported LS mean change reduction in the total 5-D Itch Scale score (ANCOVA) at the end of Week 
12 could not be tested (nominal P value was 0.002). 
•  Ancillary analyses 
The subgroup analyses were conducted using the pooled data from CR845-CLIN3102 and CR845-
CLIN3103 only with respect to ≥3- and ≥4-point changes in the WI-NRS at each timepoint and 
specifically at Week 12. Post-hoc analyses have been performed to analyse efficacy according to 
baseline itch severity. Given the small number of subjects with a very severe baseline score and the 
fact that difelikefalin is proposed for the treatment of moderate to severe CKD-aP, the following 2 
categories were considered regarding the baseline itch intensity: WI-NRS ≥4 to <7: moderate itch; and 
WI-NRS ≥7: severe itch. Difelikefalin was shown to be effective for both CKD-aP subjects with 
moderate baseline itch and CKD-aP subjects with severe baseline itch. 
The Applicant has performed post-hoc analyses in subjects with ≥3-point improvement and with ≥4-
point improvement in the WI-NRS by region (EU versus non-EU) in the pooled ITT population. 
Regarding the ≥3-point improvement at Week 12, the treatment effect in the EU was at least as large 
(OR (CI) of improvement with difelikefalin versus placebo 2.56 (1.26-5.19)) as in the other regions 
(OR (CI) 1.81 (1.32-2.48)) and it was statistically significant in both the EU (p=0.009) and the other 
regions (p<0.001). Regarding the ≥4-point improvement at Week 12, a similar relation was observed; 
i.e., the treatment effect in the EU was at least as large as in the other regions (EU: OR (CI) 2.47 
(1.17-5.21), p=0.018; non-EU OR (CI) 1.99 (1.41-2.82), p<0.001)). 
Long-term effectiveness data were explored in the OLE of CR845-CLIN3102 for up to 52 weeks. The 
OLE of CR845-CLIN3103 was stopped early by the sponsor and only 5 patients completed 52 weeks of

treatment. For CR845-CLIN3102- OLE, after 52 weeks of Open-label treatment, the LS mean (standard 
error [SE]) change from baseline in total 5-D Itch Scale score was -6.9 (0.39) and -7.8 (0.39) for 
placebo/difelikefalin (n = 94) and difelikefalin/difelikefalin subjects (n = 90), respectively. Pooled OLE 
population reached 712 patients, see below. 
To further support clinical relevance of the treatment response in patients with very severe 
baseline pruritus, additional post-hoc analyses were performed based on the classification of the 
response using relative thresholds of 30% and 50%, as see below.

2.5.5.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The placebo estimates varied between studies by more than 10%. The proportion of subjects on 
placebo who also achieved a ≥3-point reduction from baseline in the WI-NRS at Week 12 was higher in 
the global pivotal study CR845-CLIN3103 (42.2%) than in the US only study CR845-CLIN3102 
(27.6%). A meta-analysis comparing active treatments versus placebo in chronic dermatological

conditions with pruritus, showed that placebo treatment significantly reduced itch compared to 
baseline, with an overall reduction in itch severity of 24% (Van Laarhoven, et al 2015). Thus, itch can 
be reduced by placebo in a variety of chronic pruritic conditions by as much as 1.3 points out of 10 
(95% CI 1.02-1.61) (Van Laarhoven et al, 2015). Placebo response rates in US subjects were also 
higher in CR845-CLIN3103 (37.3%) than in CR845-CLIN3102 (27.6%). CR845-CLIN3103 was a larger 
study (n = 473) and included more sites (75) than CR845-CLIN3102 (n = 378; 56 sites). The number 
of study sites may have influenced the placebo response. There is literature evidence to suggest that 
more study sites may inflate placebo responses in randomized controlled studies (Meske et al, 2019). 
Proportion of Subjects Achieving ≥3- and ≥4-point Improvement in WI-NRS by Study Week 
The analyses of ≥3- and ≥4-point changes in the WI-NRS at each time point were also conducted using 
the pooled data from CR845-CLIN3102 and CR845-CLIN3103 (see figures below).

Not applicable. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The initially proposed indication for difelikefalin has been requested by the CHMP to be amended on 
CHMP’s request as follows “the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic 
kidney disease in adult patients on haemodialysis” in order to reflect the population truly treated in the 
clinical trial. The recommended dose of difelikefalin is 0.5 micrograms/kg dry body weight (i.e., the 
target post-dialysis weight) by intravenous bolus injection three times per weekThe evidence of the 
efficacy of difelikefalin is based on data from the double-blind parts of two phase 3 clinical trials 
(Studies CR845-CLIN3102 and CR845-CLIN3103). Maintenance of the effect is based on open label 
extensions of these studies. However, OLE periods are not sufficient for continued evaluation of 
efficacy beyond 12 weeks due to very early termination of one of the studies and also no reporting on 
the scale used for primary endpoint in the double-blind phases. Dose finding was performed in the 
dose-ranging study CR845-CLIN2101 which examined the efficacy of 3 doses of IV difelikefalin (0.5, 
1.0, and 1.5 mcg/kg) treatment after each HD session (3 times/week) over an 8-week period. The 0.5 
mcg/kg dose was selected for the Phase 3 studies given the similarities in efficacy results across doses 
and a more favourable safety profile over the higher doses. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of the pivotal trials is 12-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel group 
confirmatory trial. Overall, the design for double-blind phase could be considered acceptable for this 
treatment/indication. The provision of potentially un-masked comparative results from the interim 
analyses were questioned, no impact on study integrity was observed. 
The studies consisted of screening (7-28 days), Run-in (7 days), double-blind treatment (12 weeks) 
periods in the double-blind trial phase, and open-label treatment (up to 52 weeks) with safety follow 
up (7-10 days) periods in the open-label extension phase. In CR845-CLIN3102, the double-blind 
treatment period was followed by a 2-week discontinuation period designed to assess potential 
signs/symptoms of drug withdrawal, during which subjects did not receive any study drug. The study 
was overseen by and independent data monitoring committee (IDMC).  
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either difelikefalin 0.5 mcg/kg or placebo as 
an IV bolus after the end of each HD session, generally 3 times per week (maximum 4 doses per 
week), in the Double-blind Treatment Period. Subjects were stratified according to their use or non-use 
of concomitant medications to treat pruritus during the week prior to randomization (Run-in Period), as 
well as the presence or absence of specific medical conditions (e.g., falls/fractures due to falls, gait 
disturbance, and mental status change). 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria can generally be considered suitable to define a relevant patient 
population. Eligible subjects were males or females aged 18 years or older undergoing in-center 
haemodialysis 3 times a week for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Prior to randomization, subjects had 
to have completed at least 4 WI-NRS worksheets during the Run-in Period and have a mean baseline 
WI-NRS score >4 for CR845-CLIN3102 and ≥5 for CR845-CLIN3103, defined as the average of all non-
missing pre-randomization scores, to ensure moderate-to-severe pruritus at baseline. They were not 
eligible if they had pruritus attributed to a cause other than ESRD or its complications, in the opinion of 
the investigator. The subjects were excluded from the Double-blind Phase of the study if they were 
scheduled to receive a kidney transplant during the study; had known history of allergic reaction to 
opiates, such as hives; had a concomitant disease or a history of any medical condition such as known

or suspected history of alcohol, narcotic, or other drug abuse, or substance dependence within 12 
months prior to screening, significant systolic or diastolic heart failure, severe mental illness or 
cognitive impairment (e.g., dementia), any other relevant acute or chronic medical or neuropsychiatric 
condition within 3 months prior to screening (e.g., diagnosis of encephalopathy, coma, delirium); had 
localized itch restricted to the palms of the hands; had pruritus only during the haemodialysis session 
(by subject report). Both treatment naïve and previously treated patients were enrolled, however, 
patients were excluded if they had received new or changed treatment for itch, including 
antihistamines, corticosteroids (oral, IV, or topical), opioids, gabapentin, or pregabalin within 14 days 
prior to screening; had received another investigational drug within 30 days prior to the start of 
screening or were planning to participate in another clinical study while enrolled in this study; were 
receiving ongoing ultraviolet B treatment and anticipated receiving such treatment during the study. 
Upon query the Applicant added warning in section 4.4. of SmPC on treatment of patients with 
clinically important disruptions to the BBB (e.g., primary brain malignancies, CNS metastases or other 
inflammatory conditions, active multiple sclerosis, advanced Alzheimer’s disease) due to a potentially 
higher risk for difelikefalin entry into the CNS. Kapruvia should be prescribed with caution in such 
patients taking into account their individual benefit-risk balance with observation for potential CNS 
effects. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥3-point improvement from 
baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour WI-NRS at Week 12 of the Double-blind 
Treatment Period. The WI-NRS scale is considered relevant, and the Applicant performed the validation 
of the scale in this indication. The cut off of 3 points was determined as minimal clinically significant 
change by the Applicant. FDA noted that “a success (or responder) defined as a ≥4-point improvement 
from baseline on an 11-point NRS has been proposed for other indications”, “the definition of a 
clinically meaningful change in the WI-NRS should be based on an absolute change rather than a 
percentage change from the baseline value”, and “recommended that a 4-point improvement be used 
as a threshold for the primary efficacy endpoint instead of a ≥3-point improvement from baseline”. The 
choice of ≥3-point improvement instead of ≥4-point improvement from baseline as minimal clinically 
meaningful change on WI-NRS is not queried further as analyses with both revealed significant results. 
Different sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary analysis using interim or post-interim 
analysis subjects, counting early discontinuations as non-responders, using multiple imputation and 
tipping point analysis. Additional post-hoc tables of ≥3-point and ≥4-point improvements of the WI-
NRS have been generated based on the daily scores, rather than on the weekly scores, which have 
also supported the primary analyses. 
The list of key secondary endpoints and their hierarchical testing differ between the two pivotal 
studies. For CR845-CLIN3102, secondary endpoints were change from baseline in total 5-D Itch Scale 
score at week 12, change from baseline in total Skindex-10 Scale score at week 12, and ≥4-point 
improvement from baseline in WI-NRS at week 12. For CR845-CLIN3103, there were 7 secondary 
endpoints in hierarchy which included 3 or 4 points or more improvements from baseline to weeks 12, 
8 or 4, together with total Skindex-10 Scale score and total 5-D Itch Scale score. In general, the scales 
and analyses used for key secondary/secondary/ exploratory endpoints are relevant to the indication. 
According to testing hierarchy in SAP, the primary endpoint was to be tested first at α = 0.05 in the 
overall ITT population. If the primary endpoint was statistically significant in the ITT population, each 
secondary endpoint was tested with a hierarchical order differing between trials. Thus, there was strict 
control on the family wise error rate for all endpoints covered by the pre-specified test strategy.  The 
sample size of 350 subjects (175 per treatment group) in each trial was chosen to provide up to 96% 
power to detect a treatment difference between placebo and difelikefalin for the proportion of subjects 
with a ≥3-point improvement from baseline in WI-NRS scores at Week 12 using a 2-sided continuity 
corrected Chi-square test, assuming a placebo response of 30% and a difelikefalin response ranging 
from 46% to 50% (based on estimates of response consistent with results from Phase 2 study CR845-
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 62/89 
 
 
 
 
CLIN2101). This sample size also provided adequate power (≥80%) to detect a treatment difference 
with respect to the proportion of subjects with a ≥4-point improvement from baseline. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study CR845-CLIN3102 randomized subjects at 56 sites and was conducted exclusively in the US, 
whereas study CR845-CLIN3103 randomized subjects at 75 sites and was conducted in the US, 
Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Despite planned target population size of 350 subjects in each trial, the pre-
planned interim analysis for sample size re-estimation resulted in an advice from Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee to increase sample size for CR845-CLIN3103. A total of 503 subjects were 
screened in the US, of whom 125 failed screening, 378 were randomised (intent-to-treat [ITT] 
Population), and 377 received at least 1 treatment with difelikefalin (189 subjects) or placebo (188 
subjects) during the Double-blind Treatment Period. A total of 332 subjects (88.1% of the 377 subjects 
randomized and exposed to study drug) completed the Double-blind Treatment Period. Forty-five 
subjects (11.9%) discontinued early, 14.3% in difelikefalin group and 9.6% in the placebo group. The 
most common reasons for early discontinuation were AE (6.1%) and subject withdrawal of consent 
(3.7%).  
In CR845-CLIN3103, a total of 620 subjects were screened (in US, Canada, Germany, UK, Hungary, 
Poland, Czech Republic, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, and South Korea), of whom 161 failed 
screening, 473 were randomised (ITT Population), and 471 received at least 1 treatment with 
difelikefalin (235 subjects) or placebo (236 subjects). A total of 429 subjects (91.1% of the 471 
subjects randomized and exposed to study drug) completed the Double-blind Treatment Period. Forty-
two subjects (8.9%) discontinued early, 12.3% in the difelikefalin group versus 5.5% in the placebo 
group. The most common reason for early discontinuation was AE (4.2%). Overall, study population 
reflects the intended indication. The study arms were in general comparable with respect to median 
values for demographic characteristics and the baseline characteristics. Slight differences between 
placebo and active groups are not expected to have significant impact on the primary endpoint and key 
secondary endpoints. Across both Phase 3 studies, males represented 59.6% of the ITT population, 
and the median age was 60.0 years for difelikefalin subjects and 59.0 for placebo subjects (range 22 
to 90 years). The majority of subjects were <75 years old (88.4%). 106/377 and 172/471 patients 
were at or above the age of 65. The predominant races were white (60.8%) and black or African 
American (29.3%), and the predominant regions were the US (77.2%) and Eastern Europe (13.4%). 
EU patient data comes from CR845-CLIN3103 and 63 patients who were recruited in Europe were 
exposed to difelikefalin treatment. Around 37% of the population treated with difelikefalin were using 
another anti-itch medication and the study populations were stratified for this factor. This supports the 
inclusion of all de-novo or previously treated CKDaP patients in the indication. Treatment compliance 
seems to be different in terms of range between two pivotal studies, however mean and median values 
are comparable between the studies. Study CR845-CLIN3102 is considered a positive study to show 
the efficacy of difelikefalin in the treated population, in line with the estimations in the study design. 
In Study CR845-CLIN3102, 51.0% of difelikefalin subjects versus 27.6% placebo subjects met the 
primary efficacy endpoint by achieving a ≥3-point improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS at Week 12 
(odds ratio = 2.72; P <.001). Absolute baseline scores were 7.2 (SD 1.61) for placebo and 7.1 (SD 
1.44) for difelikefalin groups. The change at 12 weeks was -2 for placebo and -3.2 for active arms with 
a treatment difference of -1.1. The sensitivity analyses of primary analysis reached statistical 
significance (<0.05) and were supportive. Per protocol analysis results removed some concerns around 
the protocol deviations. Primary analysis results for interim and post-interim populations or for 
subjects using anti-itch medication or not did not differ significantly. Secondary endpoints were met in 
study CR845-CLIN3102. At the end of Week 12, change from baseline in the total 5-D Itch Scale score 
for difelikefalin and placebo were (LS mean) -5.0 and -3.7, respectively (P <.001) and change from 
baseline in the total Skindex-10 Scale score for difelikefalin and placebo were (LS mean) -17.2 and -
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 63/89 
 
 
 
 
12.0, respectively (P <.001). The proportion of subjects achieving a ≥4-point improvement in WI-NRS 
from baseline at Week 12, were consistent with the primary endpoint which was reassuring; 38.9% 
(LS mean) of subjects treated with difelikefalin and 18.0% subjects treated with placebo achieved a ≥
4-point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline (odds ratio = 2.89; P <.001) 
Primary endpoint was met in study CR845-CLIN3103, however, there are some concerns and limited 
support from sensitivity analyses of the primary analysis, analyses with interim/post-interim 
populations and secondary endpoints with scales other than WI-NRS. In Study CR845-CLIN3103, the 
percentage of difelikefalin and placebo subjects achieving a ≥3-point improvement (reduction) in WI-
NRS at Week 12 were 54.0% and 42.2% (odds ratio = 1.61; P = .020). Absolute baseline scores were 
7.1 (SD 1.36) for placebo and 7.3 (SD 1.36) for difelikefalin groups. The change at 12 weeks was -2,5 
for placebo and -3.1 for active arms with a treatment difference of -0.6. Primary analysis results for 
interim and post-interim populations did differ substantially with insignificant treatment differences 
(OR 1.88 (p=0.62) and 1.42 (p=0.152)). Sensitivity analyses with patients who discontinued early 
being treated as non-responders resulted in a non-significant difference between active and placebo 
arms. This was concerning given the high discontinuation rate in active arms compared to placebo 
especially in this study. However, reasons for discontinuations were not related to safety or efficacy 
issues, thus they did not raise concerns regarding safety or lack of efficacy. Other two sensitivity 
analyses were supportive. The subjects using anti-itch medications at baseline had a greater treatment 
difference (odds ratio = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.09 to 4.25) in favour of difelikefalin than subjects not using 
anti-itch medications at baseline (odds ratio = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.84 to 2.20). 
Secondary endpoints differed from study CR845-CLIN3102 in the extent and hierarchical order. The 
significant results seen with the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥4-point improvement in WI-NRS 
from baseline at Week 12 and also with ≥3-point improvement at week 8 and week 4 are supportive 
of the results for the primary analysis. The total 5-D Itch Scale score and the total Skindex-10 Scale 
score were first two secondary endpoints for study CR845-CLIN3102, but this was not the case with 
study CR845-CLIN3103 and Skindex-10 Scale gave insignificant results and stopped the testing at that 
level.  
The subgroup analyses were conducted using the individual or pooled data from CR845-CLIN3102 and 
CR845-CLIN3103 only with respect to ≥3- and ≥4-point changes in the WI-NRS at each timepoint and 
specifically at Week 12. A subgroup analysis of efficacy according to the baseline itch severity was 
presented: categorised to two groups - WI-NRS ≥4 to <7: moderate itch; and WI-NRS ≥7: severe 
itch. Based on these post-hoc analyses from week 12, it can be concluded that the primary and 
secondary endpoints have been achieved regardless of the baseline itch severity. The small observed 
differences on primary endpoint (and also achievement of ≥4-point improvement from baseline in WI-
NRS at Week 12) between treatment arms in patients above 65 years (n=279) were not considered 
significant. The regional analysis of primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint addressing 
proportion of subjects achieving a ≥4-point improvement from baseline in WI-NRS at Week 12 in EU 
region was consistent with overall results. No paediatric patients have been treated with difelikefalin. 
The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of difelikefalin has not been formally 
studied. Long-term effectiveness data were explored in the OLE of CR845-CLIN3102 for up to 52 
weeks. After 52 weeks of Open-label treatment, the LS mean (standard error [SE]) change from 
baseline in total 5-D Itch Scale score was -6.9 (0.39) and -7.8 (0.39) for placebo/difelikefalin (n = 94) 
and difelikefalin/difelikefalin subjects (n = 90), respectively. 
Pooled analyses were performed, however, were not prespecified. Some concerns are summarized 
here. In general, for the primary endpoint, there is a significantly higher amount of missing data in 
difelikefalin group in both pivotal studies despite similar number of patients per arm (24 and 29 
patients in placebo groups versus 32 and 53 patients in difelikefalin groups, Table 12). There is 
minimal difference in primary endpoint for difelikefalin arms in between two pivotal trials (50.9% 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 64/89 
 
 
 
 
versus 53.4%). The placebo estimates varied between studies by more than 10%. The difference 
between placebo arms of the pivotal studies is 14.3% (28.3% vs 42.6%) which is significant (larger 
than the effect size observed for primary endpoint in CR845-CLIN3103 (10.8%) and similar to the 
effect size in pooled dataset (15.9%)). A meta-analysis comparing active treatments versus placebo in 
chronic dermatological conditions with pruritus, showed that placebo treatment significantly reduced 
itch compared to baseline, with an overall reduction in itch severity of 24% (Van Laarhoven, et al 
2015). Thus, itch can be reduced by placebo in a variety of chronic pruritic conditions by as much as 
1.3 points out of 10 (95% CI 1.02-1.61) (Van Laarhoven et al, 2015). In the light of variability in 
placebo response, the Applicant discussed the clinical relevance of the 15.9% increase in responders 
for primary endpoint and 3 points difference as a cut off for primary endpoint. The Applicant has 
provided cumulative distribution function of the unimputed weekly WI-NRS change from baseline at 
Week 12 by baseline WI-NRS score and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) categories in 
pooled data of both clinical studies CR845-CLIN3102 and CR845-3103. In a group of very severe 
baseline pruritus (WI-NRS ≥9) for PGIC “minimally or much improved”the median WI-NRS change 
was -3.17.   
A post-hoc analysis was performed documenting WI-NRS score improvement according to the location 
of measurement (dialysis unit vs home), showing no substantial difference between the measurements 
conducted at dialysis unit and at home in terms of WI-NRS score improvement. Further post-hoc 
analyses were conducted by the applicant following the list of questions. The ≥3 points improvement 
in WI-NRS by baseline pruritus severity was demonstrated. This analysis has shown that although not 
statistically significant (p=0.065), the proportion of patients in the very severe subgroup (WI-NRS ≥9) 
achieving ≥3 points improvement was comparable to the overall population, 53 % vs 51 % 
respectively. Additionally, when the ≥4 points improvement in WI-NRS by baseline pruritus severity 
was analyzed, the highest proportion of subjects achieving this endpoint was in the very severe 
subgroup (WI-NRS ≥9) and this was statistically significant. Similarly, the highest proportion of 
subjects achieving ≥5 points improvement was observed in this subgroup as well and this was 
statistically significant. It was also this subgroup where the highest mean reduction in WI-NRS points 
was observed from baseline. Furthermore, the applicant conducted post-hoc analyses based on the 
classification of the response using relative thresholds of 30% and 50%. These analyses have shown 
that the response is similar in the overall population and very severe subgroup, although not 
statistically significant in the latter. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
All phase 3 confirmatory studies for difelikefalin met their primary endpoints. The individual or pooled 
data from CR845-CLIN3102 and CR845-CLIN3103 with respect to ≥3- and ≥4-point changes in the WI-
NRS have shown a modest but clinically relevant treatment effect for difelikefalin for patients with 
moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adult patients on haemodialysis. 
The OLE studies are regarded as supportive.  
2.5.8.  Clinical safety 
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In the primary safety pool, almost 80% (79.7%, n=338) of difelikefalin treated patients had at least 
three months of treatment and 85.1% (n=361) of placebo patients. In the difelikefalin exposure safety 
pool, 412 HD patients were exposed to difelikefalin for at least 12 months, which is sufficient according 
to the ICH E1 guidance on population exposure. However, only three months exposure was placebo-
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 65/89 
 
 
 
 
controlled.  In the Primary safety pool, a total of 13.2% and 7.3% discontinued treatment early for 
difelikefalin and placebo, respectively during the 12 weeks study. Adverse events were the primary 
reason for early treatment discontinuation, and more so for the difelikefalin treated patients (6.4%) 
compared to placebo treated patients (3.8%). Only 1 patient was lost to follow-up. During the long-
term treatment, in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool, 26.4% of patients discontinued treatment 
early (excluding the stopping by sponsor). Adverse events were one of the primary reasons for early 
treatment discontinuation in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool (9.3%) but also the other category 
(6.8%). The adverse event category has been pooled and consist of AEs, pregnancy, safety of subject 
may be compromised, and sponsor requested subject to discontinue due to safety concerns. Almost 
1/3 of the population in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool did not complete the treatment because 
the studies CLIN3101, CLIN3102, and CLIN3103 was stopped early by sponsor due to filing to the FDA 
for Breakthrough therapy Designation. The stopping of the trials was unrelated to safety for these 
patients. 
2.5.8.2.  Adverse events 
In the primary safety pool, slightly more difelikefalin treated patients than placebo treated patients 
reported TEAEs, i.e., any TEAE, non-fatal serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study 
treatment and TEAEs of special interest (fall, gait disturbance, mental status changes, dizziness, 
somnolence, seizure, syncope, unusual feeling/sensation, mood altered, tachycardia, and palpitations). 
Around 2/3 of patients reported at least one TEAE. 71.2% and 65.3% for difelikefalin and placebo, 
respectively. Although, slightly more patients treated with difelikefalin reported more adverse events, 
the placebo treated patients also had a high reporting of adverse events. This is in line with the rather 
comorbid patient population of patients treated with haemodialysis reporting hypertension (97.4% and 
94.8% of pooled difelikefalin and pooled placebo subjects, respectively), anaemia of CKD (78.8% and 
73.8%), diabetes (62.5% and 55.7%), hyperphosphataemia (58.0% and 56.6%), hyperparathyroidism 
secondary (51.9% and 54.0%), hyperlipidaemia (45.5% and 37.5%), gastroesophageal reflux disease 
(39.4% and 42.7%), hypotension (38.9% and 40.6%), iron deficiency anaemia (36.1% and 35.4%), 
nausea (35.6% and 40.1%). Non-fatal serious TEAEs were reported by 25.2% and 22.6% for 
difelikefalin and placebo, respectively. TEAEs of special interest were reported more in the difelikefalin 
group (17.7%) compared with placebo (13.0%). Severity and relatedness of TEAEs were almost similar 
between difelikefalin and placebo groups.Five (n=5; 1.2%) placebo treated patients died during the in 
the two phase 3 pivotal placebo-controlled studies compared with three (n=3; 0.7%) in the difelikefalin 
group. Overall, any TEAE, TEAEs leading to death, and nonfatal serious TEAEs was reported more in 
the difelikefalin exposure safety pool than in the primary safety pool, due to the longer observation 
time. Incidence rates are calculated for the events in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool due to 
different observation times in the studies and to be able to compare to historical data. 
The most common (≥15% of the subjects) system organ classes of TEAEs were gastrointestinal 
disorders (25.9% for difelikefalin and 19.1% for placebo), infections and infestations (21.7%, and 
21.5%, respectively), nervous system disorders (20.3% and 14.2%), and general disorders and 
administration site conditions (15.3% and 12.0%). The most common TEAEs reported by ≥ 2% of 
difelikefalin patients and with ≥1 percentage point higher than placebo was diarrhoea, dizziness, 
nausea, hyperkalemia, headache, somnolence and back pain. 10% or less of patients in the 12 weeks 
DB placebo-controlled study period reported these preferred terms. Most of these events were mild to 
moderate in severity. The incidences of diarrhoea, dizziness, and nausea were higher in the pooled 
difelikefalin group than in the pooled placebo group. Diarrhoea (9.0% for difelikefalin and 5.7% for 
placebo), dizziness (6.8% and 3.8%, respectively), and nausea (6.6% and 4.5%). Constipation was 
also reported by 2.6% and 1.7% for difelikefalin and placebo, respectively. The incidences of SAEs 
were low: diarrhoea – 0.7% for difelikefalin and 0.7% for placebo; dizziness – 0.2% and 0%, 
Assessment report

respectively; somnolence – 0.2% and 0%; hyperkalaemia – 1.9% and 1.9%; There were no reports of 
serious TEAEs with nausea, headache, or back pain. During long term treatment in the difelikefalin 
exposure safety pool, diarrhoea and nausea were reported by up to 17% of difelikefalin treated 
patients. Vomiting by up to 13%. Fall was reported by up to 15% and dizziness by up to 13%. 
Constipation was reported by 4.4%. Most (>60%) were mild to moderate in severity. Somnolence was 
reported by less than 5% of patients. Hence, the most commonly reported adverse events in the safety 
pools presented here are GI-events diarrhoea and nausea; nervous system disorders dizziness, 
headache and somnolence, see table below. 
More than 50% of reported TEAEs were of mild to moderate severity. Less than 14% reported a severe 
TEAEs in both the difelikefalin and placebo. In line with the longer exposure in the difelikefalin 
exposure safety pool, the nature of the severe TEAEs is different from the Primary safety pool. More 
infections (sepsis and pneumonia) rated as severe were seen over time along with cardiovascular 
events. 
The phase 2 dose-finding study (CR845-CLIN2101 Part A) in HD patients with CKD-aP receiving 0.5, 1 
or 1.5 mcg/kg for 8 weeks, did not show any dose effect on overall TEAEs. Treatment-emergent AEs 
with a dose-dependent increase were mental status change, somnolence, paresthesia, fatigue, and 
hypertension. In the other two phase 2 studies (CR845-CLIN2005 Part A, and PR-13A9-P2-A) 
evaluating different difelikefalin doses (treatment duration 1-2 weeks) in HD patients with CKD-aP, a 
higher incidence for TEAEs were seen for the 1.5 mcg/kg dose, although the differences were small. 
Preferred terms of TEAEs that appeared to show dose-related increases in incidence were vertigo, 
constipation, increased blood prolactin level, and decreased free thyroxine in PR-13A9-P2-A. Treatment 
discontinuations were higher in the 1.5 mcg/kg group in studies CR845-CLIN2101 Part A and PR-13A9-
P2-A. Based on the dose-response trends observed with difelikefalin in CR845-CLIN2101 and the 
similar efficacy seen across dose groups, the 0.5 mcg/kg dose was selected for further development in 
the Phase 3 studies in subjects undergoing HD. 
In the primary safety pool, the median time to onset was shorter (<10 days) for difelikefalin treated 
patients compared to placebo for TEAEs of special interest (dizziness, falls, mood changes, palpitations, 
seizures, somnolence, syncope and tachycardia), as well as for the selected TEAEs diarrhoea, 
hyperkalaemia and hypotension. Nausea and vomiting occurred earlier in the placebo group. See table 
below for the time to onset for the preferred terms listed in SmPC section 4.8 (except headache). 
Placebo and difelikefalin (DB) is from the Primary safety pool and difelikefalin (OL) is from the 
difelikefalin exposure safety pool:

The median event duration for any category of TEAE of special interest in the pooled difelikefalin group 
of the Primary Safety Pool ranged from 0.80 day for syncope to 20.50 days for somnolence, with the 
upper limit of the range being consistent with that in the pooled difelikefalin group in the  difelikefalin 
Exposure Safety Pool. Palpitations and gait disturbance had a longer median duration in placebo 
treated patients.

The incidence and prevalence were evaluated for patients with continuous exposure for 6 and 12 
months. Both the incidence and prevalence diminished over time for dizziness, somnolence, diarrhoea, 
nausea and vomiting. Falls were reported at a constant rate throughout the studies. 
Overall, the median duration of the adverse drug reactions listed in SmPC section 4.8 is a few days 
except for somnolence, with a median duration of around 3 weeks (range 1-86 days in primary safety 
pool and 0.2-312 days in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool). However, the median duration of 
somnolence in the placebo group was even longer 29.5 days (range 1-84 days). In addition, incidence 
and prevalence of somnolence seemed to diminish over time. Somnolence was reported by 4.2% of 
difelikefalin patients compared to 2.4% of placebo treated patients. Although, median duration for 
somnolence was the same for both placebo and difelikefalin, the TTO was shorter for difelikefalin. 
Adverse events of special interest: TEAEs of special interest included fall, gait disturbance, mental 
status changes, dizziness, somnolence, seizure, syncope, unusual feeling/sensation, mood altered, 
tachycardia, and palpitations. Data from the primary safety pool showed that dizziness and 
somnolence were reported more in the difelikefalin treated patients compared to placebo. These two 
preferred terms have been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Also falls were reported by around 5% 
of patients, although equally in the two treatment arms. Gait disturbance and mental status changes 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022

were also reported more in the difelikefalin treated group, although small numbers (<2%). Mental 
status changes are included in the SmPC in section 4.8. In the long-term safety evaluation, 11.2% of 
difelikefalin patients reported falls. Incidence rates for falls were similar in the Primary safety pool and 
the difelikefalin exposure safety pool (IR difelikefalin 265.2 and 255.1 events/1000 PY; IR for placebo 
was 207.8 events/1000PY). In addition, the Applicant has referenced literature that shows even higher 
fall rates among patients treated with HD than found in these studies. In conclusion, the AESIs have 
been evaluated further by looking at custom MedDRA queries (CMQs), since the standardised MedDRA 
queries (SMQs) for the areas of interest were found too broad. The fall and potentially drug-related 
injury CMQ was comparable in difelikefalin and placebo treated patients (7.8% for difelikefalin and 
6.4% for placebo), as well were the incidence rates. Hence, there is no indication that the occurrence 
of falls is related to study treatment and acceptable not to include in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Based on adverse events seen in the pivotal phase 3 double-blind studies, SMQs for acute central 
respiratory depression, cardiac arrythmias, cardiac failure and vestibular disorders have been 
evaluated. In the SMQs, there is an imbalance for serious TEAEs for atrial fibrillation in the Primary 
Safety Pool with an incidence rate (IR) of 30.6 events per 1000 PY in the difelikefalin treated patients 
compared with an incidence rate of 9.9 events/1000 PY in placebo patients. In the difelikefalin 
exposure safety pool, the IR for serious TEAEs of atrial fibrillation is 13.6 events/1000 PY and the 
literature suggests an IR of 12.5 events/1000 PY (Abbot, 2003). Hence, the IR for serious adverse 
events for AF was higher in the Primary safety pool. However, the overall number of patients is small: 
3 difelikefalin (n=424) and 1 placebo (n=424) patients reported an SAE of atrial fibrillation (PT) in the 
placebo-controlled phase, and 11 in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool (n=1306). The IR is higher in 
difelikefalin patients (30.9 events/1000 PY) compared to placebo (9.9 Events/1000 PY), the 
difelikefalin exposure safety pool (13.6 events/1000 PY) and the literature (12.5 events/1000 PY for 
hospitalisation for AF), but as mentioned, this higher IR in the placebo study is based on 3 vs 1 
patient. 
IR for cardiac failure (SMQ) SAEs were also higher in difelikefalin treated patients: 49.5 events/1000 
PY for placebo, 102 and 72.7 for difelikefalin in the DB and OL phase, respectively. USRDS data from 
2013 suggest a rate of 140 events/1000 PY for hospitalisation for heart failure in HD patients. Hence, 
although there is a higher incidence rate of serious adverse events of heart failure (cardiac failure 
SMQ) in the difelikefalin patients vs placebo patients (49.5 vs 102 events/1000 PY), this rate is lower 
than the IR seen in the background population (based on USRDS, 2013). 
Treatment emergent adverse events considered related to study drug: In the primary safety pool, any 
event of TEAEs were considered related to study drug for 6.4% placebo patients and 8.0% difelikefalin 
patients. In the difelikefalin exposure safety pool 6.6% patients reported TEAEs that was judged to be 
related to study drug. In the Primary safety pool, the most common (≥1% of subjects) preferred terms 
of related TEAEs in the pooled difelikefalin group were somnolence (1.9% for difelikefalin and 0.9% for 
placebo) and dizziness (1.4% and 0.2%, respectively). The incidence of both of these related TEAEs in 
the pooled difelikefalin group was at least twice that in the placebo group. Same picture was seen in 
the difelikefalin exposure safety pool: The most common (≥0.5% of subjects) preferred terms of 
related events were somnolence (1.1%), dizziness (0.9%), nausea (0.7%), headache (0.6%), vomiting 
(0.5%), and paraesthesia (0.5%). Some patients also reported related constipation, 2 patients in both 
the placebo and difelikefalin group, and 5 patients in the pooled difelikefalin group.  
Adverse drug reactions: Somnolence, dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, mental status changes 
(including confusional state), vomiting and paraesthesia (including paraesthesia, hypoesthesia, 
paraesthesia oral and hypoesthesia oral) were included in section 4.8 as adverse drug reactions.

2.5.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
During the two pivotal double-blind studies, 107 subjects (25.2%) in the pooled difelikefalin group 
reported at least 1 nonfatal serious TEAE (SAE), compared to 96 subjects (22.6%) in the pooled 
placebo group. In total, 200 and 188 SAEs were reported and the incidence rates (IR) for SAEs were 
2040 and 1860 events/1000 PY, for difelikefalin and placebo, respectively. Hence, more difelikefalin 
treated patients reported a serious adverse event compared with placebo during the 12 weeks DB 
period. The IR of any SAE in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool was 1824.3 events /1000 PY, same 
IR as placebo group. 
In the Primary safety pool, the most common (≥4% of subjects) system organ classes of SAEs in 
patients treated with difelikefalin were infections and infestations (8.3% for difelikefalin and 7.1% for 
placebo); cardiac disorders (4.5% and 1.9%, respectively); and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal 
disorders (4.5% and 3.8%). As also seen in the standardised MedDRA queries (SMQs) discussed 
earlier, events classified as cardiac disorders were reported more frequently in the pooled difelikefalin 
group than in the pooled placebo group (incidence rate of 244.8 and 128.6 events/1000 PY, 
respectively).  
The most common (≥1% of subjects) preferred terms of SAEs were chest pain (1.9% for difelikefalin 
and 0.9% for placebo), hyperkalaemia (1.9% and 1.9%, respectively), pneumonia (1.4% and 1.7%), 
sepsis (1.2% and 1.7%), mental status changes (1.2% and 0.5%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (1.2% and 0.5%). The incidences of the SAEs mental status changes, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease in the pooled difelikefalin group were at least twice those in the pooled placebo 
group; however, the number of subjects reporting any of these events was generally small (n ≤8 in 
either pooled treatment group). The picture of serious adverse events reported, corresponds well to 
the patient population in question, and there are imbalances that both disfavours difelikefalin and 
placebo. Apart from an imbalance in cardiac disorders, which are discussed later, the profile for SAEs 
reported are as expected.

Looking at the long-term safety in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool, 41.5% reported at least one 
SAE, which is, as expected, higher than the around 25% in the placebo-controlled studies of 12 weeks 
duration. As stated above the overall IR was comparable to placebo in the 12 weeks placebo-controlled 
studies: the IR of any SAE in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool was 1824.3 events /1000 PY, and in 
the placebo group it was 1860 events/1000 PY. The most common (≥8% of subjects) system organ 
classes of SAEs in the pooled difelikefalin group of the Difelikefalin Exposure Safety Pool aligned with 
those in the pooled difelikefalin group of the Primary Safety Pool. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE):  Primary safety pool: Patients experiencing a MACE 
event (MACE event includes non-fatal stroke and MI, CV-death, heart failure and revascularisation) 
was 16 patients (3.8%, IR 193.8 events/1000 PY) vs 10 patients (2.4%, IR 128.6/1000 PY), in the 
difelikefalin and placebo group, respectively. The MACE events were driven by cardiac heart failure and 
myocardial infarction, and less by cerebrovascular events. In the difelikefalin exposure safety pool, 119 
(9.1%; IR 199,7 events/1000 PY) patients experienced at least one MACE event (in total 162 MACE 
events). The IR of 199.7 events/1000 PY is in line with the IR seen for MACE in the primary safety pool 
(IR 193.8 events/1000 PY), despite the shorter observation time in the primary safety pool. The MACE 
events were driven by myocardial infarction and heart failure. Overall, a higher incidence of MACE was 
seen in the difelikefalin treated patients compared with placebo. 
Looking at the SMQ for cardiac failure in the Primary safety pool, 20 difelikefalin patients (IR 234.6 
events/1000 PY) vs 14 placebo patients (IR 158.3 events/1000 PY) reported event(s) of cardiac failure 
SMQ. For SAEs in SMQ for cardiac failure in the Primary safety pool, the incidence was 9 (2.1%, IR of 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 72/89 
 
 
 
 
 
102/1000 PY) and 4 (0.9%, IR of 49.5/1000 PY) for difelikefalin and placebo, respectively. USRDS data 
from 2013 suggest a rate of 140 events/1000 PY for hospitalisation for heart failure in HD patients. 
Hence, although there is a higher incidence rate of SAEs of heart failure (cardiac failure SMQ) in the 
difelikefalin patients vs placebo patients, this rate is lower than the IR seen in the background 
population based on USRDS, 2013. 
Within the SMQ of cardiac failure, patients are reporting TEAEs within the different PTs. The imbalance 
between difelikefalin and placebo pertains to a few more difelikefalin patients reporting events of 
cardiac failure and cardiac failure acute (N=4). 3 of these 4 events are serious with one being fatal. 
The events were reported by patients with known comorbidities including previous heart failure. All 
events occurred concurrently with other significant medical events.  
The applicant has evaluated the cardiac failure SMQ further by looking at the reporting of cardiac 
failure SMQ for patients who was treated with placebo in the DB phase and then crossed over to 
difelikefalin in the open label phase of the two pivotal studies. The incidence of TEAEs in the Cardiac 
Failure SMQ remained the same for placebo subjects who crossed over to difelikefalin treatment. 3.0% 
during the Double-blind Phase and 3.0% during the first 3 months of the Open-label Extension Phase. 
Similarly, there were no events of cardiac failure or acute cardiac failure in the placebo group during 
the double-blind treatment Phase and once subjects crossed over to difelikefalin for the first 3 months, 
there were no events of cardiac or acute cardiac failure. The rates for the other common preferred 
terms showed no notable increase over those in the Primary Safety Pool. The serious TEAE of acute 
myocardial infarction (26 subjects [2.0%]) in the Difelikefalin Exposure Safety Pool was driven by 13 
subjects in CR845-CLIN3101 (4.5% of the study Safety Population; Table 12), in which study the 
patients had a longer period on dialysis, which may have contributed to increased adverse cardiac 
outcomes. Pharmacologically, KOR agonists as aquaretic agents promoting diuresis in patients with 
normal functioning nephrons and potentially could be cardiac protective. In conclusion, small 
imbalances are consistently seen for adverse events related to cardiac safety. The information on 
cardiac safety was reflected in the SmPC and in the adopted RMP. 
Adverse events leading to death: In total (all studies pool), 59 patients treated with difelikefalin died 
while on treatment with difelikefalin (3.1%; n=1879; IR 69.0 events/1000 PY) compared with 6 
patients on placebo (0.8%; n=714; IR 50.8 events/1000 PY). All deaths occurred in patients treated 
with HD. Note that placebo patients were observed for a maximum of 12 weeks, whereas difelikefalin 
treated patients had a much longer observation time (up to 15 months), why it is difficult to compare 
the incidence rates for placebo and difelikefalin for the long-term effects such as fatal events. Since 
there are no placebo control longer than 12 weeks, a literature reference to incidence rates for e.g. 
deaths and cardiovascular events is needed in order to be able to evaluate if difelikefalin has any 
impact on these kinds of events. The Applicant has used references from different sources, e.g. the 
United States Renal Data System (USRDS), which is a database on patients treated with haemodialysis 
in the US. Overall, cardiac events and infections were the primary reasons for the fatal events, in line 
with what is known as the primary causes if deaths in patients on HD. For the 6 placebo treated 
patients, 1 patient died from cardiac arrest and 3 from infections. Of the 59 patients, who died on 
difelikefalin treatment, 28 patients died from cardiac disorders and 13 patients from infections. All fatal 
events in the studies were also evaluated as not related to study treatment by the investigator.  
Nevertheless, for deaths within cardiac disorders SOC, the IR was 3 times higher for difelikefalin than 
placebo (33.1 vs 8.7 events/1000 PY in HD patients, all studies pool).  
Hence, there is an imbalance in deaths due to cardiac disorders disfavouring difelikefalin, with 
incidence rates for deaths due to cardiac disorders being trice the IR seen in placebo patients. 
However, short observation times in the placebo studies (up to 12 weeks), are for the occurrence of 
deaths a rather short observation time, and therefore the IRs are difficult to compare to the longer 
Assessment report

exposure time for difelikefalin treated patients. To have a reference of IRs for this patient population of 
HD patients, the USRDS (United States Renal Data System) has statistics on e.g. CV events in HD 
patients.  
The incidence rate of fatal TEAEs in the overall difelikefalin group, 69.0 events/1000 PY, is consistent 
with or lower than death rates reported in the literature for patients undergoing HD, eg, 167 
events/1000 PY (unadjusted IR of death in US patients undergoing HD; USRDS, 2019) or 132 
events/1000 PY (all-cause mortality of European HD patients, Stirnadel-Farrant, 2019). 
In the All studies pool, the most common preferred term leading to death was cardiac arrest (11 
subjects [0.8%, IR of 13.6/1000 PY]) and cardio-respiratory arrest (3 subjects [0.2%, IR of 3.7/1000 
PY]). The USDRS reports cardiac arrest as the most common reason for death in subjects undergoing 
HD, with an incidence of 53.5/1000 PY (USRDS, 2019). Hence, the IR for cardiac arrest are 
comparable with those data reported in the literature. 
In addition, the Study CLIN3101 had the highest number of cardiac-related deaths (12 [4.2%]) 
compared to the other studies (CLIN3102 DB +OLE: 7 [2.0%] and CLIN3103 DB+OLE 7 [1.6%]); 
there were no cardiac-related deaths in Study CLIN3105, (12 weeks study). Of note, patients in 
CLIN3101 had a slightly longer dialysis vintage, with a mean duration of 6.21 years compared to 
subjects in the other Phase 3 studies, which ranged from a mean of 4.59 years in CLIN3102 DB+OLE 
to 5.42 years in CLIN3105. 
In conclusion, more deaths occurred in the difelikefalin group compared with placebo, mostly due to 
cardiovascular events and infections. Due to shorter observation times in the placebo-controlled 
studies, the IR on deaths cannot easily be compared between difelikefalin and placebo. When 
comparing to historical data from large databases on dialysis patients, e.g. the USRDS, the IR of CV 
deaths are in line with what you would expect in this patient population.  
2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
In the studies, haemoglobin was defined as high if exceeding a value of 14 g/dL. It is recommended in 
guidelines, e.g. from KDIGO that haemoglobin levels should be kept lower than in healthy subjects, 
due to increased risk of thromboembolic events. In the primary placebo pool, more difelikefalin 
patients had a haemoglobin value above 14 g/dL than placebo 7 (1.7%) vs 3 (0.8%) patients, but no 
one experienced a thromboembolic event in the DB phase. In the difelikefalin exposure safety pool 39 
patients (3.1%) had a haemoglobin value above 14 g/dL, and 3 patients experienced a serious event 
of thrombosis.  Potassium was also evaluated, the critical high value being >7 mmol/L. In the primary 
safety pool, this critical value was observed in 11 (2.8%) and 4 (1.0%) patients for difelikefalin and 
placebo, respectively. No one reported any TEAE within cardiac disorders in the DB phase. In the 
Difelikefalin Exposure Safety Pool, 54 subjects (4.4%) experienced a treatment-emergent potassium 
value >7 mmol/L. Two subjects had a mild, concomitant TEAE of atrioventricular block first degree 
reported at the time of the increased potassium. Both TEAEs were considered not related to study drug 
It is expected that co-morbidities, such as lower Gi bleeding, pneumonia and multi-organ failure, are 
the likely reasons for the observed liver abnormalities, including the fact that the patient was treated 
with difelikefalin for almost one year, with normal liver parameters. Hence, difelikefalin does not seem 
to impact liver parameters to a clinically relevant extent. 
Blood pressure and heartbeat were measured throughout the studies. As expected, these parameters 
fluctuated over the time course of the studies, in both the placebo and difelikefalin groups. No safety 
concerns aroused from the vital signs picture. A thorough QT/QTc study did not show any effects from

difelikefalin on heart rate, PR and QRS interval duration, cardiac repolarization, or other ECG 
parameters. 
2.5.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
The Applicant has presented a number of subgroup analyses in the Primary safety pool evaluating 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the incidence of TEAEs (65 and ≥65 years, sex, race, renal and hepatic 
impairment and other pre-existing specific medical conditions; geography, use of prior ant-itch 
medication, concomitant use of opioids and CNS-depressant medication and use of other drugs [drug-
drug interactions]).  
Overall, these data do not suggest that a dose adjustment is necessary based on intrinsic/extrinsic 
factors subgroup analyses of TEAEs and serious TEAEs evaluated. A few differences in the reporting of 
TEAEs was noted, e.g. more headache in female patients compared to male patients treated with 
difelikefalin and more somnolence in patients ≥65 years of age, patients with prior use of anti-itch 
medication and concomitant use of opioids. 
Renal and hepatic impairment: Difelikefalin is intended for use in the dialysis population. Oral 
difelikefalin was evaluated in patients with CKD stages 3-5, and no unexpected safety signals were 
observed. Likewise, was oral difelikefalin well tolerated in patients with mild, moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Around 2/3 of patients in the Primary safety pool were aged <65 years. Patients ≥65 years of age 
reported a few more TEAEs than patients <65 years of age. Somnolence was reported more by the ≥
65-year-old patients, patients treated with prior use of anti-itch medication and patients with 
concomitant use of opioids.  
Use in Pregnancy, Lactation and Fertility: For difelikefalin no or very limited amount of data on 
pregnant patients are available. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to reproductive toxicity.It is unknown whether difelikefalin is excreted in human breast milk. 
Animal studies have shown excretion of difelikefalin in breast milk. 
Overdose: Single dose of difelikefalin up to 12 times and multiple doses of difelikefalin up to 5 times 
the clinical dose of 0.5 mcg/kg were administered in clinical studies in subjects undergoing HD. A dose-
dependent increase in adverse events including dizziness, somnolence, mental status changes, 
paraesthesia, fatigue, hypertension, and vomiting, was observed in study CR845-CLIN1003. 
Difelikefalin is cleared by dialysis, however the use of dialysis as a treatment for difelikefalin overdose 
has not been studied. 
Drug Abuse: The clinical data include a systematic review of AE preferred terms suggestive of the 
potential for abuse in all clinical studies in subjects who received at least 1 dose of difelikefalin and a 
dedicated human abuse-potential study in healthy recreational polydrug users with opioid and 
hallucinogenic drug experience in which difelikefalin doses 10- and 30-fold the planned clinical dose 
were evaluated relative to pentazocine, a mixed partial mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist/antagonist 
with KOR agonist activity, and placebo (Study CR845-CLIN1006). The human abuse potential study in 
recreational polydrug users with opioid and hallucinogen experience demonstrated that difelikefalin, at 
doses of 5 and 15 mcg/kg IV (resulting in peak exposures that were 10.5- and 28.6-fold higher that at 
the proposed human IV dose of 0.5 mcg/kg in subjects with CKD-aP undergoing HD) had an abuse 
potential profile that was significantly lower than with pentazocine. There were no dysphoric or 
euphoric effects reported that would be consistent with CNS-penetrant kappa agonists or mu opioids, 
respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 75/89 
 
 
 
 
In all clinical studies of difelikefalin, there were no AE reports related to misuse, abuse, diversion, or 
dependence with IV difelikefalin at dose up to 80-fold the clinical dose for the proposed indication. 
Paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, dizziness, somnolence and sedation (not confirmed by sedation scale) 
were the most commonly and consistently potentially abuse-related TEAEs reported following single 
and repeated administration of IV difelikefalin in healthy subjects (pooled population of 376 subjects) 
at doses resulting in peak and area-under-the-curve exposures up to 60-fold and 25-fold those at the 
proposed human IV dose of 0.5 mcg/kg in subjects with CKD-aP undergoing HD, respectively. 
Dizziness and somnolence were also the most common and dose-related abuse-related TEAE in 
subjects with CKD-aP undergoing HD, followed by events of paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia occurring 
at much lower incidence compared to healthy subjects. 
Confusional state was reported at a higher incidence in subjects with CKD-aP undergoing HD, 1.4% 
among difelikefalin-treated subjects compared with 0.5% in placebo-treated subjects but did not 
appear to be dose-related. 
Withdrawal and rebound: Clinical assessments of physical dependence of difelikefalin were conducted 
in two double-blind clinical studies, including assessment of a 2-week Discontinuation Period in a phase 
3 study of subjects with CKD-aP undergoing HD (CR845-CLIN3102) and a dedicated physical 
dependence study in which subjects undergoing HD were randomized in a double-blind fashion to 
withdrawal of difelikefalin (CR845-100303). The results of the clinical assessments of physical 
dependence in 2 double-blind clinical studies indicated that abrupt discontinuation of difelikefalin was 
not associated with physical withdrawal signs or symptoms. The overall incidence of Discontinuation-
emergent Adverse Events was similar between placebo and difelikefalin treatment groups in double-
blind studies utilizing the IV formulation in CKD-aP subjects undergoing dialysis, as well as studies 
utilizing the oral formulation in subjects with chronic pain or CKD. 
2.5.8.6.  Immunological events 
Difelikefalin is a small molecule, and an immunological assessment is not relevant. 
2.5.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies are performed. The major pathway for clearance of 
difelikefalin is excretion of the unchanged parent compound into urine dialysate and/or faeces. 
Nonclinical data suggest that difelikefalin exhibits negligible potential for PK drug-drug interactions 
based on the cytochrome P450 metabolic profile. Similarly, the absence of difelikefalin interactions with 
multiple transporter proteins suggests that difelikefalin will have no interactions with other drugs that 
are substrates for these clinically relevant transporters. In the primary safety pool, somnolence and 
dizziness was reported more by patients with prior use of anti-itch medication and patients with 
concomitant use of opioids. 
2.5.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, less than 10% of patients discontinued study drug due to adverse events during the 12 weeks 
of treatment in the DB, placebo-controlled primary safety pool and the up to 52 weeks treatment in the 
difelikefalin exposure safety pool. More difelikefalin treated patients discontinued study drug compared 
to placebo-treated patients. In the primary safety pool, dizziness, nausea, headache, anxiety, insomnia 
and mental status changes were reported as reasons for discontinuing the study treatment, although in 
less than 1% of patients in both difelikefalin and placebo patients. In the difelikefalin exposure safety 
pool, difelikefalin patients reported reasons for discontinuing difelikefalin dizziness and nausea along 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022

with cardiovascular events and deaths, somnolence and respiratory failure. All events in less than 1% 
of patients. Hence, study treatment was discontinued due to adverse events that are related to the 
study treatment as well as for reasons related to the study population, i.e. cardiovascular events, 
which occurs frequently in these patients treated with haemodialysis. 
2.5.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
Difelikefalin has not been marketed in the EU yet. 
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety of difelikefalin was evaluated in 18 completed clinical studies and 1879 patients received at 
least 1 dose of difelikefalin, of whom 1592 were undergoing Haemodialysis (HD), the target population 
for difelikefalin in this MAA. Safety data were pooled in 5 relevant study groupings for the safety 
assessment. The two pivotal studies were placebo-controlled (primary safety pool), but only for 12 
weeks, hence for the more long-term adverse events e.g. deaths, the safety profile was to be 
evaluated against historical data.  
Four clinical studies comprised the evaluation of long-term safety (difelikefalin exposure safety pool), 
and sufficient number of patients (n=412) were exposed to difelikefalin in at least 12 months, in 
accordance with the ICH E1 guidance. However, the early treatment discontinuation rates were rather 
high in three of the studies (24-34%); in addition, several categories have been pooled, so the early 
discontinuation reasons were not entirely clear, but this was not further pursued by the CHMP. 
Adverse events of special interest related to the pharmacology of difelikefalin as a kappa opioid 
receptor agonist was evaluated along with the abuse potential, although there seems to be a limited 
CNS penetration. In addition, due to the occurrence of cardiac events, cardiac safety was also 
evaluated separately. Overall, the safety data seem robust, and the applicant has addressed the safety 
issues thoroughly. 
Adverse events: The safety profile observed is to be seen in the light of the rather co-morbid patient 
population of dialysis patients where >80% were above 45 years, the median number of years since 
diagnosis of ESRD was 3.99 years (range 0.3 to 30.2 years), with a median of 6.64 years (range 0.3 to 
48.3 years) since diagnosis of CKD, and a median of 3.67 years (range 0.0 to 30.2 years) on chronic 
HD. The most common (≥20%) of subjects’ aetiologies of CKD were concomitant diabetes and 
hypertension (26.5%); hypertension only (25.2) and diabetes only (20.5%).  Around 65.3% placebo 
patients and 71.2% difelikefalin patients reported at least one TEAE during the 12 weeks double-blind 
phase. Diarrhoea, nausea, paraesthesia, dizziness, hyperkalemia, headache, and somnolence were the 
most commonly reported events. Hyperkalaemia has been reflected in section 4.4. of the SmPC, 
monitoring of patients is advised. Most were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (few 
days) except for somnolence that had a median duration of 3 weeks.  
Somnolence and paraesthesia (including paraesthesia, hypoesthesia, paraesthesia oral and 
hypoesthesia oral) were evaluated as a common adverse drug reaction. Dizziness, headache, nausea, 
diarrhoea, vomitting and mental status changes as uncommon ADRs listed in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Overall, the median duration of these adverse drug reactions is a few days except for somnolence that 
has a median duration of around 3 weeks (range 1-86 days in primary safety pool and 0.2-312 days in 
the difelikefalin exposure safety pool). The median duration of somnolence in the placebo was even 
longer 29.5 days (range 1-84 days). In addition, incidence and prevalence of somnolence seemed to 
diminish over time. Somnolence was reported by 4.2% of difelikefalin patients compared to 2.4% of 
placebo treated patients, and more by the ≥ 65-year-old patients, patients treated with prior use of 
Assessment report

anti-itch medication and patients with concomitant use of opioids. Although, median duration for 
somnolence was the same for both placebo and difelikefalin, the time to onset was shorter for 
difelikefalin. The observed CNS related adverse events indicate some distribution to CNS. However, 
dizziness and somnolence were commonly present in the medical history of the CKD-aP subjects and it 
is generally accepted that the CNS TEAES seen in the studies are prevalent in the population treated. 
Serious adverse events: During the 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, 107 subjects (25.2%) in the 
pooled difelikefalin group reported at least 1 non-fatal serious adverse event (SAE), compared to 96 
subjects (22.6%) in the pooled placebo group. In total, 200 and 188 SAEs were reported and the 
incidence rates (IR) for SAEs were 2040 and 1860 events/1000 PY, for difelikefalin and placebo, 
respectively. In the difelikefalin exposure safety pool, 41.5% reported at least one SAE. More 
difelikefalin treated patients reported a serious adverse event compared with placebo during the 12 
weeks DB period. The IR of any SAE in the difelikefalin exposure safety pool was 1824.3 events /1000 
PY, same IR as placebo group. Although it is difficult to compare the IR due to different observation 
times in the two safety pools, it does not seem that the incidence of SAEs increases over time. 
Cardiac safety: Cardiac safety was evaluated with cardiac disorders system organ class and preferred 
terms (SOC and PT), cardiac failure and cardiac arrhythmias SMQs and an evaluation of MACE events. 
The most frequently reported serious adverse events were related to cardiac disorders and infections, 
in line with the expected co-morbidities in the target population of HD patients. Small imbalances are 
consistently seen for adverse events related to cardiac safety, but no association of the cardiac events 
with the timing or dosage of difelikefalin treatment was seen. A causal relationship between 
difelikefalin and the cardiac events cannot be conclusively established – neither excluded. 
Mechanistically and due to nonclinical and clinical data of KOR agonists, the selective activation of 
KORs is not expected to adversely alter cardiac function in CKD-aP subjects. The applicant has 
committed to provide additional safety data from the planned Phase 3 trials of oral difelikefalin in other 
indications, avoiding the high background incidence of cardiac events confounding factors of the HD-
population, post-approval (see RMP). This is agreed by the CHMP. 
The underlying medical history, particularly the change of treatment (i.e. discontinuation or missing 
treatment) of atrial fibrillation in HD patients is considered as potential risk, which is included as a 
warning in the section 4.4 of the SmPC. Cardiac failure imbalances in SAEs in the cardiac failure SMQ 
(4 placebo and 9 difelikefalin patients) were observed, although total number of patients were few. IR 
for cardiac failure SMQ SAEs were higher in difelikefalin treated patients: (IR 49.5 events/1000 PY for 
placebo (n=4), and IR 102 events/1000 PY (n=9) and IR 72.7 events/1000 PY (n=59) for difelikefalin 
in the DB and OL phase, respectively. USRDS data from 2013 suggest a rate of 140 events/1000 PY for 
hospitalisation for heart failure in HD patients. Hence, although there is a higher incidence rate of SAEs 
of heart failure (cardiac failure SMQ) in the difelikefalin patients vs placebo patients, this rate is lower 
than the IR seen in the background population based on USRDS, 2013. The applicant has evaluated 
the cardiac failure SMQ further by looking at the placebo patients in the DB phase that crossed over to 
difelikefalin in the open label phase of the two pivotal studies. The incidence in the cardiac failure SMQ 
remained the same for placebo subjects who crossed over to difelikefalin treatment. Around 3.0% 
during the Double-blind Phase and 3.0% during the first 3 months of the Open-label Extension Phase.  
MACE: Patients experiencing a MACE event were 16 patients (3.8%, IR 193.8 events/1000 PY) vs 10 
patients (2.4%, IR 128.6/1000 PY), in the difelikefalin and placebo group, respectively. In the 
difelikefalin exposure safety pool, 119 (9.1%; IR 199,7 events/1000 PY) patients experienced at least 
one MACE event (in total 162 MACE events). The IR of 199.7 events/1000 PY is in line with the IR seen 
for MACE in the Primary safety pool (IR 193.8 events/1000 PY), despite the shorter observation time in 
the Primary safety pool. The MACE events were driven by cardiac heart failure and myocardial 
infarction, and less by cerebrovascular events. The imbalance was driven by 13 patients in CLIN3101 
(OL study) who have had longer time on dialysis, and hence more prone to adverse cardiac events.

Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The clinical safety profile of difelikefalin was evaluated in 1879 subjects receiving at least one dose of 
difelikefalin, of whom 1306 haemodialysis patients with CKD associated pruritus received 0.5 µg/kg 
difelikefalin. By the entirety of available data, the safety profile of difelikefalin is considered favourable, 
although imbalances are seen for adverse events related to cardiac safety. This is adequately reflected 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC and the adopted RMP.  Treatment emergent adverse events related to study 
drug and listed in SmPC section 4.8 are somnolence (1.1%), paraesthesia (including hypoesthesia, 
paraesthesia oral and hypoesthesia oral) (1.1%), dizziness (0.9%), headache (0.6%), nausea (0.7%), 
vomiting (0.7%), diarrhoea (0.2%) and mental status changes (0.3%) and is considered satisfactory 
by the CHMP.

2.6.1.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.4 is acceptable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 23 August 2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kapruvia (difelikefalin) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which was not contained in any

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP), or uremic pruritus, is characterised by a 
generalised and intractable itch, a frequently underdiagnosed but severely distressing condition that 
occurs in greater than 60% of patients undergoing dialysis. The aim of new treatments is to improve 
symptoms, whilst minimising the toxicity. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The prevalence of CKD-aP remains high, despite improved efficiency of dialysis techniques, improved 
skin hydration with emollients, and use of phosphate binders and calcimimetics. There is currently no 
medicinal treatment approved specifically for CKD-aP in the EU though several medications have been 
used largely as off-label treatments for CKD-aP (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, gabapentin, and 
pregabalin). The antipruritic efficacy of these therapies is limited and currently lacking support from 
randomised, well-controlled studies. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is two phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies 
(CR845-CLIN3102 and CR845-CLIN3103) comparing IV difelikefalin 0.5 mcg/kg (n=189 and 236) vs. 
placebo (n=189 and 237) in newly diagnosed or previously treated adult patients with end stage renal 
disease, undergoing haemodialysis and experiencing moderate-to-severe pruritus. The two studies 
were comparable in design, but subjects were included if they had WI-NRS scores of >4 for study 
CR845-CLIN3102 conducted in the US and ≥5 for study CR845-CLIN3103 conducted in US and 10 other 
countries. Patients received difelikefalin or placebo after each haemodialysis session, generally 3 times 
per week for up to 12 weeks (some continued up to 52 weeks as open-label treatment). Study CR845-
CLIN3102 continued as planned with all subjects rolling over to open-label treatment for up to 52 
additional weeks. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dose finding was performed in the dose-ranging study CR845-CLIN2101 which examined the efficacy 
of 3 doses of IV difelikefalin (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mcg/kg) treatment after each HD session (3 
times/week) over an 8-week period. The 0.5 mcg/kg dose was selected given the similarities in 
efficacy results across doses and a more favourable safety profile than the higher doses. 
In both pivotal studies the primary efficacy endpoint was met. In Study CR845-CLIN3102, 51.0% of 
difelikefalin subjects versus 27.6% placebo subjects achieved a ≥3-point improvement (reduction) in 
WI-NRS at Week 12 (odds ratio = 2.72; P <.001). In Study CR845-CLIN3103, the percentages were 
54.0% for difelikefalin and 42.2% for placebo (odds ratio = 1.61; P = .020). The change at 12 weeks 
for absolute scores showed a treatment difference of -1.1 and -0.6 for each study respectively.   
Secondary endpoints were met in study CR845-CLIN3102. At the end of Week 12, change from 
baseline in the total 5-D Itch Scale score for difelikefalin and placebo were (LS mean) -5.0 and -3.7, 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 81/89 
 
 
 
 
respectively (P <.001) and change from baseline in the total Skindex-10 Scale score for difelikefalin 
and placebo were (LS mean) -17.2 and -12.0, respectively (P <.001). The proportion of subjects 
achieving a ≥4-point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline at Week 12, were consistent with the 
primary endpoint which was reassuring; 38.9% (LS mean) of subjects treated with difelikefalin and 
18.0% subjects treated with placebo achieved a ≥4-point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline (odds 
ratio = 2.89; P <.001) 
Secondary endpoints for CR845-CLIN3103 differed from study CR845-CLIN3102 in the extend and 
hierarchical order. Only the secondary endpoints related to WI-NRS had given significant results 
(proportion of subjects achieving a ≥4-point improvement in WI-NRS from baseline at Week 12 and ≥3-
point improvement at week 8 and week 4). 
Around 37% of the population treated with difelikefalin were using another anti-itch medication and 
the study populations were stratified for this factor. This supports the inclusion of all de-novo or 
previously treated CKDaP patients in the indication. 
Long-term effectiveness data were explored in the OLE of CR845-CLIN3102 for up to 52 weeks. After 
52 weeks of Open-label treatment, the LS mean (standard error [SE]) change from baseline in total 5-
D Itch Scale score was -6.9 (0.39) and -7.8 (0.39) for placebo/difelikefalin (n = 94) and 
difelikefalin/difelikefalin subjects (n = 90), respectively.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
All scales used for primary and key secondary endpoints are informant-based scales and do not include 
input from treating physician.The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving a 
≥3-point improvement from baseline with respect to the weekly mean of the daily 24-hour WI-NRS at 
Week 12 of the Double-blind Treatment Period. The WI-NRS scale is considered relevant, and the 
Applicant performed the validation of the scale in this indication. The cut off of 3 points was 
determined as minimal clinically significant change by the Applicant, this is questionable, but 
significant results with 4 points cut off for overall population are reassuring.     
The pivotal studies were designed assuming a placebo response of 30% and a difelikefalin response 
ranging from 46% to 50% for the primary endpoint. The actual placebo response varied between 
studies by more than 10%. The proportion of subjects on placebo who also achieved a ≥3-point 
reduction from baseline in the WI-NRS at Week 12 was higher in the global pivotal study CR845-
CLIN3103 (42.2%) than in the US only study CR845-CLIN3102 (27.6%). Placebo response rates in US 
subjects were also higher in CR845-CLIN3103 (37.3%) than in CR845-CLIN3102 (27.6%), but this 
does not impact the overall efficacy. 
Key secondary endpoints using scales other than WI-NRS have failed to show significant differences in 
favour of the difelikefalin therapy for CR845-CLIN3103 (total 5-D Itch Scale score and the total 
Skindex-10 Scale score). Some sensitivity analyses for primary analysis also failed to reach 
significance in this study. Data for EU patients is coming from this study only. Regarding the ≥3-point 
improvement at Week 12, the treatment effect in the EU was at least as large (OR (CI) of 
improvement with difelikefalin versus placebo 2.56 (1.26-5.19)) as in the other regions (OR (CI) 1.81 
(1.32 2.48)) and it was statistically significant in both the EU (p=0.009) and the other regions 
(p<0.001). Regarding the ≥4-point improvement at Week 12, a similar relation was observed, i.e., the 
treatment effect in the EU was at least as large as in the other regions (EU: OR (CI) 2.47 (1.17-5.21), 
p=0.018; non-EU OR (CI) 1.99 (1.41-2.82), p<0.001)). 
Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022  
Page 82/89 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance of the effect is based on open label extensions of these studies. However, OLE periods are 
only supportive for continued evaluation of efficacy beyond 12 weeks and post-authorisation phase will 
monitor the efficacy beyond (see RMP). 
There were additional questions regarding the clinical relevance in a very severe population (WIN-NRS 
≥9), however, the applicant has provided sufficient data in a form of post-hoc analyses supporting 
efficacy in this subgroup. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety profile of difelikefalin in HD patients with CKD-aP appears favourable, although a 
number of unfavourable effects and uncertainties were identified. Long-term safety was evaluated in 
open-label studies of up to 12 months treatment, hence no placebo beyond 12 weeks to compare with. 
Common (>2% in difelikefalin and >1%-point higher than placebo) AEs were observed in both 
difelikefalin and placebo treated patients. Nausea, diarrhoea, and headache were considered adverse 
drug reactions, i.e. related to difelikefalin treatment. These adverse drug reactions were mostly mild to 
moderate in severity and resolved within few days, and also diminished over time. Less than 1% of 
patients discontinued treatment with difelikefalin due to these events. Due to the pharmacological 
effect of kappa opioid receptor agonism, a number of adverse events of special interest were 
evaluated. This evaluation showed that dizziness, somnolence and mental status changes were more 
frequently reported by difelikefalin treated patients. These events are considered related to difelikefalin 
and could be caused by central effects of difelikefalin. Median duration of these events was confined to 
a few days, except for somnolence with a median duration of 3 weeks. Most were mild to moderate in 
severity. For mental status changes, 2% were reported as serious. 
The target population of haemodialysis patients has an inherent increased risk of cardiovascular events 
and deaths, which are the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in patients treated with 
haemodialysis. Overall, small, but consistent imbalances disfavoured difelikefalin for cardiac disorders 
SOC, MACE, and serious adverse events of cardiac arrhythmias SMQ and cardiac failure SMQ compared 
to placebo.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Sufficient number of patients have been exposed to assess long-term safety. The uncertainty is related 
to the lack of placebo control beyond 12 weeks, and that the rates of adverse events of difelikefalin is 
to be evaluated against literature data from large databases, i.e. not in a controlled setting of the 
clinical trial. For example, for MACE events, a small imbalance was seen compared to placebo (3.8% vs 
2.4%), but the observation time was only 12 weeks, which is short in relation to a possible impact on 
MACE events. Hence, the number of events observed in the long-term setting are comparable to 
literature data. The databases that collect information and health data on dialysis patients are large 
and hold comprehensive information about mortality rates, causes of death, comorbidities etc. which 
are comprehensive enough for comparison. Small numerical imbalances disfavoured difelikefalin for 
cardiac disorders, and a causal relationship could not be excluded nor confirmed. Cardiac failure and 
cardiac arrythmias have been included as important potential risks in the RMP, along with medical 
history of atrial fibrillation. Difelikefalin is not supposed to give any effects from the CNS, due to 
allegedly low distribution over the blood brain barrier. However, Somnolence, dizziness and mental 
status change were reported more in difelikefalin treated patients than placebo patients and were also 
considered related to difelikefalin. Indeed, somnolence was reported more by patients >65 years of 
age 7% vs 2.8% for < 65 years of age as well as for patients with concomitant use of opioids and prior

use of anti-itch treatment. Both somnolence and dizziness were commonly reported in the medical 
history and included in SmPC section 4.8.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Pruritus is burdensome for a large proportion of patients in haemodialysis. There are no approved or truly 
effective treatments and the treatments used in clinical practise tend to have adverse events including CNS 
effects. There is a clear unmet medical need. Both in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacodynamic studies of 
difelikefalin has demonstrated proof of concept and mode of action, both the role of peripheral KORs in 
mitigating itch and inflammation, but also the effect of difelikefalin at relevant receptors. Difelikefalin is 
proposed to act mainly peripherally, on the imbalance of mu-opioid versus KOR activity, which has been 
shown to arise in uraemia and cause pruritus.  
The main clinical evidence come from two randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted in a 
population relevant to the target population, i.e. both treatment naïve and previously treated patients. 
In the study CR845-CLIN3103 conducted outside of the US and with a slightly more affected study 
population, the primary endpoint was met. In both studies, the placebo response was considerable, especially 
in the non-US study where more than 40 % in the placebo group were responders. A high placebo response 
is well-known in pruritus studies.  
Treatment with difelikefalin is symptomatic and would be expected to be continued long-term in patients if a 
clinical effect is experienced. Though the studies were limited to 12 weeks, OLE studies and pooled analyses 
bring some evidence for maintenance of effect beyond 12 months though the efficacy measure in OLE is the 
5-D Itch Scale and not WI-NRS.  
The overall safety profile of difelikefalin appears favourable, but comparative safety data are only available 
for 12 weeks treatment. Distribution to CNS is expected to be minimal in subjects with intact blood-brain 
barrier, but the identification of CNS related adverse events, somnolence, dizziness and mental status 
change, questions if this also apply to the HD population. “Use in patients with impaired blood-brain barrier” 
has been identified as missing information in the RMP.

Given the pharmacology of difelikefalin it is reassuring that there were no signs for potential abuse.  
Cardiovascular events are together with infections the most common causes of mortality and morbidity in 
haemodialysis patients, and there are small but consistent imbalances in MACE, cardiac failure and cardiac 
arrythmia. A thorough QTc study did not show any influence of difelikefalin on the cardiac repolarisation. 
There is no mechanistic likely explanation for an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Important potential 
risks for cardiac failure and cardiac arrythmias have been included in the RMP. The underlying medical 
history, particularly the change of treatment (i.e. discontinuation or missing treatment) of CV conditions in 
HD patients has been identified as a potential risk and it has been proposed to be included as a warning in 
the section 4.4 of the SmPC and in the adopted RMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the conducted nonclinical programme and in the clinical trials, a clear benefit of Kapruvia was 
demonstrated with respect to easing the burden of pruritus in patients with CKD. Primary and most 
secondary objectives of the trials were met. The safety is manageable and overall favourable although limited 
to 12 weeks data, which will be further expanded pot-authorisation. The applicant has satisfactorily 
addressed the concerns of the CHMP and PRAC and the benefit-risk balance is positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Kapruvia is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the benefit-risk balance of Kapruvia is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Kapruvia is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease 
in adult patients on haemodialysis (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
Kapruvia Assessment report  
EMA/152430/2022 
Page 88/89 
 
 
 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any 
agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency. 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that difelikefalin is to be qualified as a 
new active substance in itself as it is a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

1.  Introduction 
On December 8, 2018, the MAH submitted the 12 week primary analysis, paediatric clinical study 
report for Exviera and Viekirax, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study M14-748, An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the 
Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Efficacy of Ombitasvir (OBV), Paritaprevir (PTV), Ritonavir (RTV) With or 
Without Dasabuvir (DSV) and With or Without Ribavirin (RBV) in Pediatric Subjects With Genotype 1 or 
4 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection (ZIRCON), is a stand-alone study. 
Study M14-748 is an ongoing Phase 2/3, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety of ombitasvir (OBV)/ paritaprevir (PTV)/ ritonavir (RTV) 
with or without dasabuvir (DSV) and with or without ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
genotype (GT)1 or GT4-infected pediatric subjects of ≥ 3 to 17 years of age. The study aims to assess 
3 drug formulations in the pediatric population, and was designed in accordance with the Pediatric 
Study Plan (PSP) and Pediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) for OBV/PTV/RTV and DSV for the treatment 
of HCV infection in pediatric patients 3 to 17 years of age. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The approved adult formulation of the 3-DAA (OBV/PTV/RTV and DSV) regimen (for GT1) or the 
approved adult formulation of the 2-DAA (OBV/PTV/RTV) regimen (for GT4) was administered to 
subjects in the ≥ 12 to 17 year old age group with weight ≥ 45 kg who were willing to swallow the adult 
formulations (the formulations of the 3-DAA and 2-DAA regimens are also referred to collectively as 
the adult formulations).  
The pediatric formulation, comprising separate tablets of OBV, PTV, RTV, and DSV, was administered 
to subjects in the ≥ 3 to 8 year old age group with a weight ≥ 15 to 29 kg and to subjects in the ≥ 9 to 
11 year old age group with a weight ≥ 15 kg. The pediatric formulation was designed to allow for dose 
adjustments on an ongoing basis, based on available PK and clinical data to achieve therapeutic 
exposures that have been safe and efficacious in adult subjects. 
Adult formulations 
OBV/PTV/RTV was provided by the sponsor as 12.5 mg/75 mg/50 mg tablets. 
OBV/PTV/RTV was taken orally as 2 tablets every morning which corresponded to an OBV 25 mg/PTV 
150 mg/RTV 100 mg dose once daily (QD). 
DSV was provided by the sponsor as 250 mg tablets. DSV was taken orally as 1 tablet twice daily 
(BID), which corresponded to a 500 mg daily dose.

Pediatric formulation 
OBV, PTV, and RTV were provided by the sponsor as separate tablets. OBV, PTV, and RTV were taken 
orally and were dosed QD based on body weight. 
DSV was also provided by the sponsor as a separate tablet. DSV was taken orally and was dosed BID 
based on body weight. 
RBV 
RBV was provided to the investigative sites by the sponsor as 200 mg tablets for subjects who were to 
be dosed with the adult formulations. For subjects who were to be dosed with the  pediatric tablets, 
RBV was provided as a 40 mg/mL oral solution. RBV was administered as weight-based, with the total 
daily dose divided into morning and evening doses. Management of RBV in renally-impaired subjects 
(creatinine clearance [CrCl] < 50 mL/min) was left to the physician's discretion in consultation with the 
TA MD. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a primary analysis (SVR12) report for: 
• 
M14-748, An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and 
Efficacy of Ombitasvir (OBV), Paritaprevir (PTV), Ritonavir (RTV) With or Without Dasabuvir 
(DSV) and With or Without Ribavirin (RBV) in Pediatric Subjects With Genotype 1 or 4 Chronic 
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection (ZIRCON) 
2.3.2.  Clinical study M14-748 
Description 
Study M14-748 is an ongoing Phase 2/3, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety of ombitasvir (OBV)/ paritaprevir (PTV)/ ritonavir (RTV) 
with or without dasabuvir (DSV) and with or without ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
genotype (GT)1 or GT4-infected pediatric subjects of ≥ 3 to 17 years of age. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objectives of this study were: 
• 
To assess the PK (non-compartmental analysis) of different OBV, PTV, RTV and DSV 
formulations with or without RBV in treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic, GT1 HCV-infected pediatric 
subjects in Part 1.

Page 4/17 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
To assess the efficacy (percentage of subjects with sustained virologic response 12 weeks 
post-treatment [SVR12]) and safety of OBV/PTV/RTV with or without DSV and with or without 
RBV for 12 or 24 weeks in HCV GT1 or GT4-infected TN and TE pediatric subjects with and 
without compensated cirrhosis in Part 1 and Part 2.  
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the percentage of subjects with SVR12 by formulation, age and weight group and 
across all subjects on the adult formulations.  
To evaluate the percentage of subjects with sustained virologic response 24 weeks post-
treatment (SVR24) and the percentage of subjects with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
normalization by the end of treatment, by formulation, age and weight group, across all 
subjects, and across all subjects on the adult formulations.  
a. Includes pediatric formulation (3-DAA regimen) and adult formulations.  
b. Adult formulations include the 3-DAA regimen and the 2-DAA regimen 
Study design 
The study aims to assess 3 drug formulations in the pediatric population. The approved adult 
formulation of the 3-DAA (OBV/PTV/RTV and DSV) regimen (for GT1) or the approved adult 
formulation of the 2-DAA (OBV/PTV/RTV) regimen (for GT4) was administered to subjects in the ≥ 12 
to 17 year old age group with weight ≥ 45 kg who were willing to swallow the adult formulations (the 
formulations of the 3-DAA and 2-DAA regimens are also referred to collectively as the adult 
formulations). The pediatric formulation, comprising separate tablets of OBV, PTV, RTV, and DSV, was 
administered to subjects in the ≥ 3 to 8 year old age group with a weight ≥ 15 to 29 kg and to subjects 
in the ≥ 9 to 11 year old age group with a weight ≥ 15 kg. 
For Part 1, the PK study, approximately 36 treatment-naïve (TN), noncirrhotic, HCV GT1-infected 
pediatric subjects were to be enrolled. In the ≥ 12 to 17 year old age group, at least 12 subjects were 
to receive the 3-DAA adult formulation. In each of the ≥ 3 to 8 and ≥ 9 to 11 year old age group, at 
least 12 subjects were to receive the pediatric formulation. Up to 12 additional subjects may have been 
enrolled to receive the pediatric formulation if needed to adequately characterize the PK of a particular 
age group or subgroup. 
Subjects in the ≥ 12 to 17 year old age group began enrollment first. HCV GT1-infected noncirrhotic 
subjects received 12 weeks of treatment with the 3-DAA adult formulation, with or without RBV 
depending on the HCV GT1 subtype. Subsequent enrollment into the ≥ 9 to 11 year old age group 
began with the pediatric formulation when the dosing recommendation for the 3-DAA adult formulation 
was available and continued with enrollment of the ≥ 3 to 8 year old age group with the pediatric 
formulation once the dosing recommendation for the ≥ 9 to 11 year old age group was available. HCV 
GT1-infected noncirrhotic subjects received 12 weeks of treatment with the pediatric formulation of 
OBV, PTV, RTV and DSV with or without RBV depending on the HCV GT1 subtype.

Table 1.  Treatment Regimn and Duration – Part 1 
Enrollment in Part 2, the safety and efficacy study, began once the doses of the 3-DAA adult 
formulation for GT1-infected noncirrhotic adolescents were confirmed based on the PK and clinical data 
from Part 1 of the study. A total of 26 HCV-infected adolescent subjects ≥ 12 to 17 years of age with 
HCV GT1 or GT4 infection, who were TN or treatment-experienced (TE) with interferon (including 
standard interferon or pegylated-interferon [pegIFN], with or without RBV) with or without cirrhosis, 
were enrolled to receive the adult formulations in Part 2. Depending on their genotype, subtype, and 
cirrhosis status, HCV GT1- and GT4-infected subjects received the 3-DAA or the 2-DAA adult 
formulations with or without RBV for 12 or 24 weeks. 
Table 2.   Treatment Regimen and Duration – Part 2 (For Subjects ≥12-17 Years of Age) 
In Part 3, the long-term follow-up, all subjects who have completed PT Week 24 in either Part 1 or Part 
2 of the study will be followed to assess the durability of viral response, the emergence and 
persistence of resistant viral variants, growth and development outcomes, and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) related to study drug for an additional 120 weeks until PT Week 144. The results will be 
reported in a final CSR.

Study population /Sample size 
A total of 64 subjects were enrolled at 19 study sites located in the United States (and its territory, 
Puerto Rico), Belgium, Germany, and Spain. These included 38 subjects in Part 1 and 26 subjects in 
Part 2 of the study. All subjects in Part 1, including 12 adolescent subjects ≥ 12 to 17 years of age, 12 
pediatric subjects ≥ 9 to 11 years of age and 14 pediatric subjects ≥ 3 to 8 years of age, were TN, 
noncirrhotic, and had HCV GT1 infection. In Part 2, 26 adolescent subjects ≥ 12 to 17 years of age (19 
with GT1 and 7 with GT4 infection) were enrolled, of which 13 were TN and 13 were TE with interferon 
or pegIFN with or without RBV. One subject with compensated cirrhosis who was between 12 to 17 
years of age and HCV GT1a infected was enrolled in Part 2. All 64 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
the study drugs. One subject prematurely discontinued study drug due to noncompliance. Two subjects 
discontinued from the study after completing study treatment and being followed up for at least 12 
weeks in the post-treatment period (1 subject withdrew consent and 1 subject discontinued for other 
reasons). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary PK endpoints from Part 1 were: 
•  Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-
time curve (AUC) following dosing on Week 2, and trough concentration following dosing on 
Week 2 and Week 8 for OBV, PTV, DSV, and RTV.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was: 
• 
The percentage of subjects with SVR12 among all subjects. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints in Parts 1 and 2 were: 
• 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects with SVR12 by formulation, age and weight group and across all 
subjects on the adult formulations. 
The percentage of subjects with SVR24 by formulation, age and weight group, across all 
subjects, and across all subjects on the adult formulations (to be reported in the final CSR). 
The percentage of subjects with ALT normalization during treatment, defined as ALT ≤ upper 
limit of normal (ULN) at the final treatment visit for subjects with ALT > ULN at baseline by 
formulation, age and weight group, across all subjects, and across all subjects on the adult 
formulations. 
The following additional efficacy endpoints in Parts 1 and 2 were analyzed by formulation, age and 
weight group, across all subjects, and across all subjects on the adult formulations: 
• 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects with virologic failure during treatment. 
The percentage of subjects with Post-Treatment relapse (Relapse12 defined as confirmed HCV 
RNA ≥ lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] between end of treatment and 12 weeks after last 
actual dose of active study drug). 
The percentage of subjects who relapsed after achieving SVR12 (Relapse24; to 
be reported in the final CSR).

Baseline data 
An overview of genotype distribution, IL-28B genotype and treatment experience is given below.  
Table 3.  Baseline Characteristics (ITT Population) 
Pharmacokinetics results 
The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis. 
The primary PK endpoints for Part 1 were the Cmax and AUC following dosing on Week 2 and the 
trough concentrations following dosing on Week 2 and Week 8 for OBV, PTV, DSV, and RTV. These PK 
parameters are summarized by weight group in Table 4 below. 
The individual Cmax and AUC values in the present study were also compared with the individual 
values from historical data from 3 studies in adult HCV-infected subjects that had intensive PK 
assessment. Figure 1 below shows that the individual Cmax and AUC values from the 3 weight groups 
of pediatric subjects overlap with the values from adults which have been shown to be safe and 
efficacious.

Figure 1 . Comparison of Individual Cmax and AUC Values between Historical Data in Adults and 
Pediatric Weight Groups (continued) 
PK results from the study demonstrated that weight-based pediatric doses for the DAAs and RTV 
provided generally comparable exposures across the weight groups of 15 to 29 kg, 30 to 44 kg, and 
≥45 kg. The exposures in HCV-infected pediatric subjects were also comparable with those in HCV-
infected adults. 
CHMP comment: 
The PK section is described at an acceptable level and the conclusions made are supported by the 
presented results.  
Efficacy results 
An overall SVR12 rate of 98.4% (63/64) with a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of 91.7% to 
99.7% was observed among all subjects in the ITT population.  
There were no virologic failures across the ITT population. One subject did not achieve SVR12 due to 
reasons other than virologic failure, a 3-year-old female with GT1a HCV infection, discontinued study 
drug prematurely on Study Day 9 due to difficulty in dosing. 
CHMP comment: 
Given that SVR12 was 98.4% and that no virologic failures were seen, it can be concluded that efficacy 
seem comparable to that seen in the adult studies and that subgroup analyses are futile.

Safety results 
Adverse events 
The majority of subjects experienced 1 or more AEs. Most subjects with AEs had events with a 
maximum severity of Grade 1 (mild). The most frequently reported AEs (≥ 10.0% of subjects overall) 
were headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, and 
pruritus. 
Within the 12 to 17 year age group, headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, pruritus, and upper 
respiratory tract infection were the most common (≥ 10.0%) AEs. 
Within the 9 to 11 year age group, headache, fatigue, vomiting, pyrexia, nausea, diarrhea, 
nasopharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain upper, flatulence, neutropenia, rhinorrhea, and seasonal 
allergy were the most common AEs. 
Within the 3 to 8 year age group, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, pyrexia, cough, and 
gastroenteritis viral were the most common AEs. 
Table 5.   Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety Population) 
No subject experienced a Grade ≥ 3 AE related to DAA, AE leading to discontinuation of study drug, or 
died during the study. One subject (9 to 11 year age group) experienced SAEs of leukopenia and 
neutropenia on Study Day 31; both events resolved on Study Day 37 and were considered not related 
to study drug. One subject (3 to 8 year age group) experienced an AE of viral gastroenteritis on Study 
Day 31 that led to study drug interruption for 2 days; the event resolved on Study Day 41 and was 
considered not related to study drug.

Table 6.  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Grade ≥3 in Severity (Safety Population) 
Adverse Events Leading to Premature Discontinuation of Study Drug 
No subject had an AE leading to premature discontinuation of study drug. 
Adverse Events Leading to Interruption of Study Drug 
One subject (3 to 8 year age group) experienced an AE of viral gastroenteritis on Study Day 31 that 
led to study drug interruption for 2 days; the event resolved on Study Day 41 and was considered not 
related to study drug. 
Adverse Events Leading to RBV Dose Modification 
One subject (9 to 11 year age group) experienced AEs of hyperbilirubinemia (Grade 3) and decreased 
hemoglobin (Grade 2) on Study Day 14 that led to RBV dose modification; the events resolved on 
Study Days 120 and 28, respectively, and were considered related to RBV. 
Haematology 
Potentially clinically significant (PCS) hematology values experienced by ≥ 10% of subjects in any age 
group were low hemoglobin in 12 to 17 year age group females: 11 subjects, 44.0%; 12 to 17 year 
age group males: 2 subjects, 15.4%; and 3 to 8 year age group: 2 subjects, 15.4%, and low total 
neutrophils in 9 to 11 year age group: 2 subjects, 16.7%.

Values During the Treatment Period (Safety Population) 
CHMP comment: 
In this limited dataset, the safety appears comparable to the safety profile established in adults. Most 
AEs, particular those related to haematologic abnormalities, are likely related to RBV. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetic results from this study demonstrated that weight-based pediatric doses for the DAAs 
and RTV provided generally comparable exposures across the weight groups of 15 to 29 kg, 30 to 44 
kg, and ≥45 kg. The exposures in HCV-infected pediatric subjects were also comparable with those in 
HCV-infected adults, based on comparison to historical data in adults. The new formulations  are not 
assessed, as very limited information is presented in the study report. 
The efficacy and safety of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir with or without dasabuvir and with or 
without ribavirin in hepatitis C virus GT1 or GT4-infected pediatric subjects of ≥ 3 to 17 years of age 
appear comparable to that in adults. 
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
Pharmacokinetic results from this study demonstrated that weight-based pediatric doses, administered 
orally, for the DAAs and RTV provided generally comparable exposures across the weight groups of 15 
to 29 kg, 30 to 44 kg, and ≥45 kg. 
The MAH has presented results from part 1 and part 2 of the M14-748 study. There are no remaining 
issues to be resolved within this procedure, but the MAH should provide a final CSR including long-term 
follow-up data when the study is completed. 
Given that these products do not currently have a pediatric indication, and that the MAH does not 
apply for any, the proposal to leave the SmPC unchanged is endorsed.

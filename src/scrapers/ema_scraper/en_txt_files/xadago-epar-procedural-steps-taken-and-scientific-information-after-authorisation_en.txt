1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

safinamide and rosuvastatin, following results from 
study CRO-PK-17-318. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing

update the list of local representatives for Ireland in 
the Package Leaflet and to include editorial changes 
in the English, German and Spanish product 
information.

drug-interaction studies in human, a weak interaction was 
observed with rosuvastatin (AUC increase between 1.25 
and 2.00 fold) but no significant interaction was found with 
diclofenac.  It is recommended to monitor patients when 
safinamide is taken with medicinal products that are BCRP 
substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, 
ciprofloxacin, methotrexate, topotecan, diclofenac or 
glyburide) and to refer to their SmPCs to determine if a 
dose adjustment is needed.

and whether safinamide is a substrate for BCRP, OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3 were investigated. Based on the results of 
this and previous studies, it can be concluded that 
safinamide did not show any non-specific binding and 
safinamide is not a substrate for BCRP, OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. Safinamide 
is, however, an inhibitor of OCT1 at clinically relevant portal 
vein concentrations and may lead to interactions with 
concomitantly taken drugs that are also substrates of 
OCT1. Therefore, Information that Safinamide may lead to 
interactions when taken concomitantly with drugs such as 
metformin, acyclovir, ganciclovir was added to Section 4.5 
of the SmPC.

Safinamide may transiently inhibit BCRP in vitro. However, 
introduce information on safinamide effects on BCRP 
based on the results of a drug-drug interaction study

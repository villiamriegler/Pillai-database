Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of medicinal product to be 
implemented by the member states 
The Member States shall agree the final educational material with the Marketing Authorization Holder 
(MAH) prior to launch of the product in their territory. 
The Member States shall ensure that the MAH provides all physicians who are expected to prescribe or 
use Eurartesim a healthcare professional educational pack containing the following: 
• 
• 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
The Patient Information Leaflet 
The Physician Leaflet including the Contraindicated Conditions of Use and Contraindicated 
Concomitant Medication checklist 
The Physician Leaflet should contain the following key messages: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
That Eurartesim has a potential to prolong the QTc interval that may lead to potentially lethal 
arrhythmias.  
That piperaquine absorption is increased in the presence of food, therefore to reduce this risk of 
QTc interval prolongation, the patients should be advised to take the tablets with water, without 
food, no less than three hours after the last food intake.  No food should be taken within 3 hours 
after each dose. 
That Eurartesim is contraindicated in patients with severe malaria according to WHO definition and 
in patients with a history of clinical conditions that may lead to QTc interval prolongation, and in 
patients taking drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval. 
The ECG monitoring recommendations. 
The scope and use of the Contraindicated Conditions of Use and Contraindicated Concomitant 
Medication checklist 
That there is a potential risk of teratogenicity and so Eurartesim should not be used in situations 
where other suitable and effective anti-malarials are available. 
The need to counsel patients on important risks associated with Eurartesim therapy and appropriate 
precautions when using the medicine.  
That patients should be advised to contact their doctor about adverse events and that 
physicians/pharmacists should report suspected adverse reactions to Eurartesim, and in particular, 
those associated with a QT prolongation. 
The existence and scope of the pregnancy register and details of how to enter patients in it. 
In Member States where the EU safety registry will be available, the educational materials should 
include details on the registry and how to enter patients in it.

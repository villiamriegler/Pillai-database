2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lucentis (ranibizumab) has been approved in the European Union (EU)/ European Economic Area via the 
Centralised Procedure for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age related macular degeneration (wAMD) in 
2007, for the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) and retinal vein 
occlusion (RVO) in 2011 and for choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia (PM) in 
2013.  
Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanised immunoglobulin IgG1 κ isotype monoclonal antibody fragment 
that selectively binds and neutralises vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Binding of VEGF-A to its 
receptors on the surface of endothelial cells triggers angiogenesis and neovascularisation by promoting 
vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration. It also causes increased vascular permeability.  
Abnormal growth of new blood vessels below the sub-retinal pigment epithelium or into the subretinal space 
characterises CNV and may lead to exudation of intra- and subretinal fluids with subsequent atrophic 
changes (e.g. wAMD and PM) as well as macular oedema (DME and RVO), all of which can lead to visual 
impairment. By inhibiting VEGF, ranibizumab prevents angiogenesis and decreases vascular permeability, 
thereby preventing vision loss, restoring vision, and/or improving visual function. 
Lucentis is administered as monthly injections until maximum visual acuity is achieved and/or there are no 
signs of disease activity. Initially, at least 3 monthly intravitreal (IVT) injections may be needed for 
treatment of wet AMD, DME and RVO, while for PM one or two injection in the first year might be sufficient. 
Patients should be monitored and treatment resumed when disease activity occurs.  
Problem statement 
With the present application, the MAH proposed an extension of the indication of Lucentis to the ‘umbrella’ 
indication treatment of visual impairment due to CNV. This indication would also cover the previously 
approved use in CNV secondary to PM, while AMD was proposed to remain as stand-alone indication.   
For wAMD and CNV due to PM, the two most common causes of CNV, a treatment benefit of Lucentis has 
previously been demonstrated. Based on the same mechanism of action, ranibizumab is thought to also 
have a potential in the treatment of CNV due to any cause. Other causes than wAMD and CNV are usually 
rare and include angioid streaks, post-inflammatory retinochoroidopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy 
(CSC), idiopathic CNV, and other miscellaneous diseases. They typically occur in young, working age 
persons, and can be multifocal, binocular, and recurrent. CNV may cause vision loss from the exudation of 
intra- or subretinal fluid, haemorrhage or fibrosis. 
For many of these rare conditions no or only suboptimal treatment options are available and there is no 
established standard of care.  
For CNV secondary to angioid streaks, argon-laser treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin, 
or a combination of the IVT application of triamcinolone with PDT all failed to show clear effectiveness; 
furthermore, increased or persistent subretinal haemorrhage following PDT has been reported. Thus, the 
prognosis for CNV due to angioid streaks remains particularly poor.  
The core treatment of uveitis/ocular inflammation is based on suppression of the inflammation, generally 
using steroids with or without immunosuppressants. CNV in younger patients is an uncommon complication 
associated with uveitis involving the posterior segment. Treatments that have been reported for the CNV 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 6/57 
 
  
  
associated with uveitis include photocoagulation, PDT, and surgical removal, usually once the ocular 
inflammation has been controlled with anti-inflammatory agents. 
CSC is a disease hallmarked by presence of serous detachment of the neurosensory retina in the posterior 
pole, sometimes associated with a serous retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detachment. Chronic CSC can be 
complicated by CNV. Different treatment modalities including PDT with verteporfin, and submacular surgery 
have been reported, with variable success. Anti-VEGF agents have been reported to be used and effective in 
the treatment of CSC patients with CNV complication (Carneiro et al 2011). 
Idiopathic CNV patients are currently treated with laser photocoagulation or surgical removal of subfoveal 
CNV, however neither intervention appears to show a clear benefit. It has been demonstrated that these 
patients may benefit from anti-VEGF therapy with a mean gain of visual acuity up to 2.2 lines (11 letters on 
ETDRS chart) at 6-month follow-up (Gunther and Altawheel 2009; Heier et al 2011; Fan et al 2014). 
In addition, anti-VEGF therapy has been investigated in several case (series) reports to treat CNV associated 
with rare causes such as adult-onset vitelliform dystrophy (Mimoun et al 2013), atypical choroidal nevus 
(Cavalcante et al 2014), blunt-head trauma (Artunay et al 2009) or macular telangiectasia type II (Kovach 
and Rosenfield 2009). Based on its anti-VEGF mechanism of action, any CNV lesion may also potentially 
benefit from treatment with ranibizumab, including CNV associated with these rare conditions. 
Development program 
In order to support this application, the MAH submitted one pivotal, 12-months phase III study (study 
CRFB002G2301, hereafter also referred to as study G2301 or MINERVA) investigating efficacy and safety of 
0.5 mg ranibizumab in the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV (due to other causes than wet AMD 
and PM). Supportive data from an observational study (CRFB002GFR01, hereafter also referred to as study 
GFR01) in patients with ocular complications secondary to a pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) was provided 
as well. The development program has previously been discussed in a scientific advice and covering the 
broad label of CNV in a common development program was agreed with a caveat regarding heterogeneity of 
the patient population and sham as comparator was essentially agreed by the CHMP.  
Despite a PIP waiver had been granted to all subsets of the paediatric population, study G2301 was open for 
inclusion of adolescent patients in an open-label separate cohort where all subjects received treatment. By 
submitting the full study report (12-months) data, the MAH fulfilled the requirement as per Article 46 of the 
Paediatric Regulation.   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In line with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), since ranibizumab is a protein and unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment, there is no need for ERA studies.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic data have been provided to support this application.  
However, blood samples have previously been collected in patients with AMD in several clinical trials with 
ranibizumab as well as in trials for other conditions. Following monthly IVT administration of ranibizumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 8/57 
 
  
  
 
0.5 mg/eye to patients with wAMD, serum concentrations of ranibizumab were generally <5 ng/ml and thus 
below the ranibizumab concentration necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF by 50% (IC50 = 11 
to 27 ng/ml). Serum ranibizumab concentrations in DME and RVO patients were similar to those observed in 
wAMD patients. 
Tong et al (2006) compared aqueous humour concentrations of VEGF in patients with active macular 
polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, patients with CNV related to AMD, patients with CNV secondary to PM, 
and control subjects. VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in the three disease states versus 
control. The rank order of mean VEGF concentrations from lowest to highest was control < PCV < PM < AMD. 
Likewise, Chan et al. (2008) observed higher baseline aqueous VEGF concentrations in patients with CNV of 
AMD compared to patients with myopic CNV before treatment. 
From these cross-indication comparisons, the MAH drew the following conclusions:  
(1) aqueous humor VEGF concentrations in patients with CNV of PM were not higher than those in patients 
with CNV of AMD, and  
(2) serum ranibizumab concentrations were similarly low for patients treated with ranibizumab for AMD, 
DME, and RVO. 
Consequently, vascular permeability and ranibizumab transfer from the vitreous to the serum in patients 
with visual impairment due to CNV of PM should not be greater than what has been previously measured in 
other diseases (AMD, DME, RVO).  
Immunogenicity 
No new data has been provided. 
In AMD studies, the pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to ranibizumab across treatment groups 
was 0% to 3%. After monthly dosing with ranibizumab for 12 to 24 months, antibodies to ranibizumab were 
detected in approximately 1% to 8% of AMD patients. In a DME study, the pre-treatment incidence of 
antibodies to ranibizumab across treatment groups was 0% to 2% and after monthly dosing with 
ranibizumab for 12 months, antibodies to ranibizumab were detected in approximately 2% to 4% of DME 
patients. In RVO studies, the pre-treatment incidence of antibodies to ranibizumab across treatment groups 
was 2% to 3% and after monthly dosing with ranibizumab for 12 months, antibodies to ranibizumab were 
detected in approximately 4% to 5% of RVO patients. The clinical significance of pre-existing 
anti-ranibizumab antibodies is unclear. 
Given the low incidence and lack of a relationship to clinical outcome, immunogenicity to ranibizumab was 
not assessed in the clinical program to support the use of ranibizumab in the treatment of visual impairment 
due to CNV. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of ranibizumab is to bind and neutralise VEGF, thereby decreasing permeability of 
leaking blood vessels and reducing neovascularisation. This basic mechanism of action is valid independent 
on whether targeting choroidal vessels in AMD, in PM or in other cases of visual impairment due to CNV. No 
additional pharmacology studies have been conducted and none are needed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 9/57 
 
  
  
2.3.4.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
No additional pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in support of this 
application. No relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of ranibizumab are expected in the new 
population (patients with CNV) with respect to the patient populations previously studied (wAMD, DME, RVO, 
PM). Dose and method of administration are the same as for other approved indications. With this in mind, 
and in view of the common mechanism of action, and the low and similar systemic exposure across the 
previously investigated conditions, the lack of additional studies was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The main support for the efficacy of ranibizumab in the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV was 
derived from the randomised controlled phase III trial G2301 (MINERVA). 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No new dose finding studies have been conducted by the MAH. The rationale for the dose (0.5 mg) and 
posology used in study G2301 was based on previous experience in AMD, DME, and RVO.  
The MAH stated that the 0.5 mg/injection dose has been shown to have the best benefit-risk balance in 
previous wAMD and RVO dose-finding studies. It is approved dose for all indications of Lucentis (RVO, AMD, 
DME, and CNV secondary to PM). Evidence from previously conducted AMD, DME, and RVO studies 
suggested that there were individual differences in treatment response and need for re-treatment. To allow 
for a balance of efficacy, safety and treatment burden for patients and taking into consideration the 
heterogeneity of the associated CNV aetiologies, an individualized ranibizumab treatment regimen was 
chosen for the ranibizumab treatment arm based on disease activity. 
The minimum dosing interval of 1 month (4 weeks) is based on pharmacokinetic data for ranibizumab and 
previously collected clinical data of patients with AMD and is the same as approved for the other indications. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study CRFB002G2301 (MINERVA): A 12-month, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, 
multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal 
injections in patients with visual impairment due to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
driven choroidal neovascularization (CNV).  
2.4.2.1.  Methods 
MINERVA was a 12-month, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, multicentre study in adult 
patients with visual impairment due to CNV, including a non-randomized, open-label group of adolescent 
patients.  
The study was divided into four periods (see also Figure 1): 
- Screening period, 
- Treatment period 1 (double-masked for adults; open-label for adolescents), 
- Treatment period 2 (open-label for adults and adolescents), 
- Post-treatment follow-up period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 10/57 
 
  
  
Consenting patients participated in an up to 14 day screening period. In addition to screening and baseline, 
there was a visit on Day 8, followed by monthly visits from Month 1 to Month 12. 
Treatment period 2 commenced at Month 2, when all adult patients assigned to the sham arm switched to 
ranibizumab open-label treatment. Thus, as of Month 2, both adult and adolescent patients received 
open-label individualized ranibizumab IVT injections.  
S = screening; R* = randomization at 2:1, including stratification by type of underlying ocular pathophysiologic 
mechanisms (angioid streaks vs. others); BSL = baseline; EOT = end of treatment; EOS = end of study.

ranibizumab 0.5 mg/0.05 mL from baseline. At Month 2, all adult patients randomized into the sham group 
switched to as-needed treatment with open-label ranibizumab.  
Study eye: If both eyes were eligible at screening and baseline, the eye selected as the study eye was the 
one the investigator deemed to be more appropriate for study treatment and the study, based on the most 
appropriate active CNV lesion characteristics in addition to visual impairment. 
Re-treatment criteria: Patients could receive additional treatment based on evidence of disease activity as 
judged clinically or based on morphology / imaging (e.g. VA impairment, intra-/sub-retinal fluid, 
haemorrhage or leakage).  
Rescue therapy: vPDT could be administered to adult subjects only at Month 1, according to standard clinical 
practice according to the decision of the evaluating (masked) investigator, if the patient had VA loss of 
>5 letters due to disease activity from baseline to Month 1. ‘Rescued’ patients continued in the study and 
could obtain study treatment (ranibizumab) at Month 2. Adolescent patients did not receive 
protocol-specified rescue since they received ranibizumab from baseline. 
Prohibited concomitant medication included, for example, systemic CS for > 15 days, systemic 
anti-angiogenic drugs, IVT or peri-ocular pharmacological treatment for CNV. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that an individualized regimen of IVT injection of 0.5 mg 
ranibizumab has superior efficacy compared to sham treatment in adult patients with visual impairment due 
to VEGF-driven CNV.  
The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of ranibizumab by additional assessments of changes 
in BCVA, changes in central subfield thickness (CSFT), central subfield volume (CSFV) and presence of 
intra-/sub-retinal fluid by OCT, presence of active chorioretinal leakage by FA, requirement for rescue 
treatment Month 1, number of ranibizumab treatments, reasons for treatment decisions and safety. This 
included the evaluation the efficacy of ranibizumab by original treatment assignment by assessing data up 
to Months 12. 
Exploratory objectives included evaluation of functional and anatomical outcomes of ranibizumab treatment 
by the underlying categories of ocular pathophysiologic mechanisms, by baseline BCVA and age, patient 
reported outcomes and the efficacy and safety in adolescent patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in BCVA from baseline to Month 2. 
The secondary endpoints based on BCVA were: 
•  BCVA change from baseline by visit up to Month 2. 
•  Average BCVA change from baseline to Month 1 through Month 6 and 12. 
• 
Proportion of patients with gain or loss in BCVA ≥ 1, ≥ 5, ≥ 10 and ≥ 15 letters or reaching 84 letters 
from baseline at Month 2 and 6 and 12. 
BCVA (tested at all visits) was tested at 4 meters starting distance using ETDRS charts. 
Secondary efficacy parameters based on anatomical markers were: 
•  Change in CSFT (within 1 mm around the foveal centre) and central subfield volume (3 mm field 
centred around the fovea) assessed by OCT from baseline over time to Month 2 and by visit.

• 
• 
Presence of intra-/sub-retinal fluid (yes/no) assessed by OCT at Month 2, 6 and 12. 
Presence of active chorioretinal leakage (yes/no) assessed by FA at Month 2, 6 and 12. 
Anatomical parameters were evaluated by a central reading centre. 
Other secondary efficacy parameters included: 
•  Requirement for rescue treatment at Month 1. 
• 
The number of ranibizumab treatments and re-treatments. 
•  Reasons for treatment decision. 
Exploratory variables evaluated changes in health-related quality of life with the National Eye Institute 
Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) vs. baseline. 
Subgroups analyses by baseline BCVA (≤60, >60 letters), age (≤60, >60 years), type of underlying ocular 
pathophysiological mechanism/baseline aetiology in study eye (Angioid Streaks, Central Serous 
Chorioretinopathy, Idiopathic Chorioretinopathy, Post-inflammatory Retinochoroidopathy, Miscellaneous), 
and by type of OCT-machine used ((time domain vs. spectral domain) were conducted. 
Exploratory subgroup analyses of anatomical outcomes based on the above criteria were also conducted. 
Sample size 
Literature data formed the basis for the sample size calculation. To allow for an identification of an 8-letter 
(ETDRS) treatment difference between treatment arms, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 15 letters in 
both treatment arm (Cordero Coma et al 2007; Arevalo et al 2009; Weiss et al 2009; Carneiro et al 2011), 
and using a randomisation ratio of 2:1, an alpha of 0.025 for a single, and one-sided comparison, a sample 
size of 112 subjects in the ranibizumab treatment arm and 56 patients in the sham treatment arm would 
result in a power of 89.7%. The sample size was increased by 5% to account for missing data, i.e. the study 
population was planned to consist of approximately 177 adult patients. 
Randomisation 
Adult subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio (ranibizumab:sham) via interactive response technology. 
Randomization was stratified by the type of underlying ocular pathophysiologic mechanisms (angioid streaks 
versus others). All adolescent patients were assigned to receive treatment with open-label 0.5 mg 
ranibizumab IVT injections. 
Masking 
Masking was limited to the adult population. Patients, investigator staff (excluding the treating investigator, 
see below), and persons performing the assessments remained masked to the identity of the treatment from 
the time of randomization until database lock. The MAH’s trial team was unmasked after the Month 6 
database lock; however, masking to the original treatment assignment was maintained at the site level 
(including patients) until Month 12. 
There were at least two investigators involved into the study: the masked (evaluating) investigator who 
performed all assessments and captured data in the electronic Case Report Forms and an unmasked 
(treating) investigator who administered the randomized study treatment when needed according to the 
protocol. The masked evaluating investigator performed all the monthly clinical and ancillary assessments 
during the course of the study. The treating investigator treated the patient based on the three re-treatment 
assessments provided by the evaluating investigator and the randomized treatment group.

Statistical methods 
The results of the study were analyzed at two time points, i.e., after Month 6 and after Month 12: 
1.  Month 6 database lock included analyses from Day 1 to Month 2 and from Day 1 to Month 6. 
2.  Month 12 database lock included analyses from Day 1 to Month 2, from Day 1 to Month 6, and from 
Day 1 to Month 12.  
Data were summarized with respect to demographic and baseline disease characteristics, efficacy, drug 
exposure, and safety observations and assessments. Descriptive statistics were provided by treatment 
group unless otherwise specified. Where appropriate, estimates of treatment group differences, confidence 
intervals and p-values were presented. Efficacy analyses were based on the study eye only. 
Unless otherwise specified, confidence intervals (CIs) were 2-sided and at a 95% level and hypothesis tests 
were evaluated at a one-sided 0.025 level of significance. 
The primary efficacy variable (change in BCVA from baseline to Month 2) was analysed using a Mixed-Effect 
Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) with treatment group, visit, type of underlying ocular pathophysiologic 
mechanism (angioid streaks versus others) as factors in the model. Baseline BCVA was fitted as a continuous 
covariate and the interaction terms ‘treatment group by visit’ and ‘visit by baseline’ were included. A term for 
visit was included in the repeated statement (in SAS PROC MIXED) and an unstructured correlation matrix 
was used thus allowing adjustment for correlations between time points within patients. 
Secondary variables were either analysed using MMRM (changes in anatomical markers over time) or by 
using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). For consistency with the MMRM model, the restricted likelihood 
method was used for the ANCOVA as this would give the same results as least squares (LS) provided all of 
the variables in the model were fixed effects. Efficacy variables recorded as binary and used for statistical 
inference were analysed using logistic binary regression containing important baseline variables (underlying 
pathophysiology, baseline BCVA) on the multiple imputation dataset or on observed data, if multiple 
imputation fails. Descriptive statistics were used for the estimation of ranibizumab use. 
Descriptive statistics were used for exploratory variables. 
Missing values were handled as follows: 
• 
For continuous data, no imputation of missing data was made for the primary analysis (MMRM model 
to be valid if data are missing at random - MAR). If the number of patients with missing baseline data 
was large or severely unbalanced between treatment arms, the mean value-last observation carried 
forward (MV-LOCF) single imputation was included. MV-LOCF categorise missing data as monotone 
(no other measurements of that variable at any future visit) or non-monotone (at least one 
observation for that variable at a later visit). Monotone missing data were imputed by the LOCF 
value and non-monotone values were imputed by the mean of the last observed value before and 
the first observation after the missing data. 
• 
For binary data, missing binary data used for statistical inference was imputed by multiple 
imputation assuming MAR. 
Subgroup analyses (based on the FAS) were performed for adult patients only based on the following 
criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
type of underlying ocular pathophysiologic mechanisms (angioid streaks, post-inflammatory 
retinochoroidopathy, CSC, idiopathic chorioretinopathy and miscellaneous), 
baseline BCVA (≤ 60 letters, > 60 letters), and 
age (≤ 60 and > 60 years).

Analysis sets 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprised all randomized patients to whom treatment regimen had 
been assigned. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were analyzed according to the 
treatment regimen they were assigned to at randomization.  
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) consisted of all patients in the FAS who followed the treatment 
regimen as randomized and completed the study period for the analysis of the primary variable 
without clinically important protocol deviations.  
The Safety Set consisted of all adult patients who received at least one application of study 
treatment and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment.  
The Adolescent Full Analysis Set consisted of all adolescent patients assigned to treatment. 
The Adolescent Safety Set consisted of all adolescent patients who received at least one 
application of study treatment and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. 
All efficacy evaluations were carried out on the full analysis set (FAS) and the Adolescent FAS. The analysis 
for the primary efficacy evaluation was carried out on both the FAS and the PPS. For the sensitivity analysis, 
the model options repeated the options for the main analysis for the primary variable for the PPS and 
FAS-MV-LOCF.  
For exposure and safety, patients that were reported in the sham treatment arm for the period up to Month 2 
were split into the sham with ranibizumab group and the sham without ranibizumab group for the period up 
to Month 6 and Month 12. Patients in the sham with ranibizumab group received at least 1 injection in the 
study eye at or after Month 2, while patients in the sham without ranibizumab group received no 
ranibizumab injection(s) in the study eye. 
2.4.2.2.  Results 
Participant flow 
Overall, 194 patients were screened. Of these, 16 patients were screening failures, mainly due to failure 
meeting the diagnostic/severity criteria (8 patients) followed by patients who had an unacceptable past 
medical history/concomitant diagnosis (3 patients) or withdrew consent to participate in the study 
(3 patients). Patient disposition is summarised in the below table.

Table 1 – Patient Disposition 
Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 19 -Sep-2013 and the last patient completed the 12-month period on 
11-Nov-2015 (last patient last visit).  
The study recruited subjects from 60 centres from 13 EU countries, Australia, Canada, Peru, Russia, South 
Korea, Switzerland and Turkey.  
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended once (4 May 2014), primarily to align the protocol-specified re-treatment criteria 
with current medical practice for the management of patients with visual impairment due to VEGF-driven 
CNV and 2 additional CNV conditions considered sub-categories of wAMD, PCV and RAP lesions in patients ≥ 
50 years were excluded. Thus, patients with these conditions were included in the study prior to the 
amendment. In addition, the eligibility criteria were relaxed and editorials changes were made. The 
amendment was made when 28 subjects had been recruited. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of the adult patient population was 53.7 years and 21% of all patients were younger than 
40 years. The majority of patients (89.3%) were Caucasian and the ratio was approximately 1:1 males to 
females per treatment arm (see Table 2)

The treatment arms were generally well balanced with respect to baseline ocular characteristics of the study 
eye. In addition, subjects were fairly well balanced between treatment arms with regards to intraretinal 
fluids, intraretinal cysts and pigment epithelium detachment. Somewhat more subjects in the ranibizumab 
treatment arm compared to placebo (16 versus 10%) had evidence of vitreomacular traction. The majority 
of patients (78%) did not have the margin of the optic disc involved. All but 2 subjects that couldn’t be 
graded (one per treatment arm) had no capillary loss. Similarly, all but 1 subject that couldn’t be graded 
(ranibizumab arm) had no peripheral neovascularisation. 
Medical history 
The proportion of patients with a relevant ocular medical history of the study eye was 26.9% in the 
ranibizumab arm and 22.0% in the sham arm. The most frequent ocular medical history conditions (≥5% in 
any arm) were cataract (9.2% in ranibizumab and 11.9% in sham), cataract operation (6.7% in ranibizumab 
and 6.8% in sham), vitreous opacities (2.5% in ranibizumab and 5.1% in sham), and myopia (1.7% in 
ranibizumab and 5.1% in sham).  The proportion of patients with active ocular medical conditions of the 
study eye was 15.1% in the ranibizumab arm and 20.3% in the sham arm. The most frequent active ocular

(0.8% in ranibizumab and 5.1% in sham) 
Overall, 65.2% of patients were reported with an active non-ocular medical condition, most frequently 
related to the system organ class (SOC) of vascular disorders (38.8%), metabolism and nutrition disorders 
(25.8%), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (18.0%). A total of 65 (36.5%) patients were 
reported with hypertension and 18 (10.1%) patients with hypercholesterolemia.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 32 patients (18.0%) were recorded with at least one protocol deviation up to Month 12, 20 patients 
in the ranibizumab arm and 12 patients in the sham arm. A total of 11 patients (ranibizumab 7, sham 4) 
recorded protocol deviations with impact on the analyses and were excluded from the PP set. Important 
deviations were: did not satisfy entry criteria (n=2), wrong treatment or incorrect dose (n=4), prohibited 
medication (n=1), procedural deviations (n=3) and accidental unmasking (n=1). 
Overall, all but one randomised subject (99.4 %) completed 2 months and 97.8 of all patients completed 6 
months. Two patients discontinued the study due to an adverse event (AE).

Outcomes and estimation 
Extent of exposure 
The mean number of ranibizumab or sham injections received in the study eye prior to Month 2 was similar 
with approximately 75% of patients in each treatment arm received 2 out of 2 possible injections. The 
number of patients treated with ranibizumab decreased over time in the ranibizumab group. A similar

Throughout the 12 months, 7 patients received injections in the fellow eye in the ranibizumab group, and 
8 patients in the sham with ranibizumab group. The mean number of ranibizumab injections received in the 
fellow eye prior to Month 12 was 5.1 in the ranibizumab group and 3.8 in the sham with ranibizumab group. 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
For the primary efficacy variable, BCVA change from baseline to Month 2, statistical superiority of 
ranibizumab compared sham was shown (one-sided p-value <0.001), with a between-treatment difference 
of 9.9 letters.

n is the number of patients with data available in the analysis: One patient in the ranibizumab arm and 2 patients 
in the sham arm did not have BCVA values recorded at either Month 1 or 2 and are not included in the analysis 
(1) Analyzed using MMRM, which contains scheduled visit, the type of underlying pathophysiologic mechanism 
(angioid streaks vs others) and treatment group as fixed effect factors, centered baseline BCVA as a continuous 
covariate and treatment group by visit and visit by centered baseline BCVA interactions. 
The outcomes of sensitivity analyses within the FAS with imputation for missing observations using MV-LOCF 
and in the PPS were consistent with the primary analysis. In the FAS/MV-LOCF and PPS analyses, the 
treatment effect sizes were 9.8 letters (95% CI: 6.9, 12.7; p<0.001) and 10.0 letters (95% CI: 6.9, 13.1; 
p<0.001), respectively. 
For the subgroups (baseline BCVA, age, and CNV aetiology), a consistent positive treatment effect in favour 
of ranibizumab was observed throughout the analyses. The magnitude of the treatment effect (LS adjusted 
means) across the 5 different CNV aetiology subgroups ranged from a gain of 5.0 to 14.6 letters. Patients 
with a lower baseline BCVA score, as well as patients 60 years of age or younger, had larger treatment effect 
with ranibizumab at Month 2, see Figure below.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
•  Visual acuity 
The mean BCVA change from baseline over time to Month 12 showed that the initial improvement in BCVA 
was maintained with a 11.0 letter change from baseline in the ranibizumab treatment group. In the sham 
arm, BCVA was unchanged at Month 2, after which patients could receive ranibizumab open-label. 
Thereafter BCVA improved up to Month 4 and the mean improvement was 9.3 letters at Month 12.

The average change (SD) in BCVA from baseline up to Month 12 was 6.6 (10.7) and 10.0 (11.5) in the sham 
and ranibizumab treatment groups, respectively. 
Seven patients never received ranibizumab throughout the study. Among the 4 patients of these subjects 
that completed the study, 1 patient in the miscellaneous aetiology group has a stable BCVA without 
ranibizumab treatment, 2 idiopathic CNV patients and 1 CSC patient gained 27, 13 and 12 letters at Month 
12 in comparison to baseline, respectively.

•  Anatomical variables 
The central subfield thickness (CSFT) representing the average retinal thickness (Bruch’s membrane to 
inner limiting membrane) of the circular area within 1 mm diameter around the foveal centre on OCT showed 
a statistically significantly greater mean reduction from baseline to Month 2 in the ranibizumab arm 
compared to sham (LS difference -87 μm; 95% CI for difference: -126, -48; p<0.001). At Month 6, the 
mean changes from baseline were -89 and -86 μm in the ranibizumab and previously sham treated subjects, 
respectively. At Month 12, the corresponding changes were -103 and -92 μm in the respective groups. 
A summary of additional anatomical variables is provided in the following table.

*Adjusted for baseline covariates 
The mean reduction in macular volume from baseline to Month 6 and 12 was similar in both treatment arms.  
At Month 6, intra-retinal fluid present at baseline resolved in 75.6% of the patients in the ranibizumab arm 
and 59.1% in the sham arm. At Month 12, intra-retinal fluid present at baseline resolved in 75.6% of the 
patients in the ranibizumab arm and 65.2% in the sham arm. 
At Month 6, subretinal fluid present at baseline resolved in 63.0% of patients in the ranibizumab arm and 
60.4% in the sham arm. At Month 12, sub-retinal fluid present at baseline resolved in 67.4% of patients in 
the ranibizumab arm and 73.5% in the sham arm. 
At Month 6, active chorioretinal leakage present at baseline resolved in 64 patients (60.4%) in the 
ranibizumab arm and 29 patients (64.4%) in the sham arm. At Month 12, active chorioretinal leakage 
present at baseline resolved in 80 patients (79.2%) in the ranibizumab arm and 37 patients (78.7%) in the 
sham arm. 
•  Other secondary and exploratory efficacy evaluations  
One patient in the sham arm was given rescue treatment with vPDT as per protocol at Month 1. No patients 
in the ranibizumab arm required rescue treatment at Month 1. 
The number of treatments is summarised in Table 5. For the majority of patients (approximately 90%), the 
primary reason for treatment up to Month 12 was abnormality as observed with OCT, as per assessment 
provided by the investigator. 
The mean change (improvement, 95% CI) in the NEI-VFQ-25 composite score from baseline at Month 2 was 
2.7 (1.24, 4.26) in the ranibizumab arm compared to -0.1 (-3.41, 3.13) in the sham arm. At Month 6, the 
corresponding figures were 5.4 (3.51, 7.31) and 3.2 (0.06, 6.25). At Month 12, the change in the composite 
score from baseline was 4.6 (2.47, 6.70) in the ranibizumab arm versus 2.7 (-0.58, 5.94) in the sham arm. 
Up to Month 2, ranibizumab was also favoured (~4 units difference or more between treatment arms) with 
regards to general health, near activities and driving. Smaller improvements, but numerically in favour of 
ranibizumab were observed for general vision, ocular pain, distance activities, social functioning, mental

health, role difficulties, colour vision and peripheral vision. Ranibizumab was not favoured with regards to 
dependency.

Baseline is defined as the last available non-missing value collected just prior to the start of treatment. 
n: number of patients with a value for both baseline and the specific post-baseline visit for the given sub-group. 
In the miscellaneous subgroup of patients (n=37), 15 different aetiologies were represented. Data from 
single or a few subjects were obtained for some of the aetiologies and in many cases, the randomisation to 
the two treatment groups was uneven. An overall benefit of ranibizumab was observed, but for a few of the 
aetiologies no or a very limited benefit was indicated. 
The mean change in CSFT from baseline to Month 2 by subgroups that included baseline BCVA (≤60 and 
>60 letters) and the 5 CNV aetiology categories (including miscellaneous) were consistent with the analysis 
in the full data set and ranibizumab was favoured in all subgroups. The reductions in CSFT were larger in 
patients with baseline BCVA ≤60 letters. Across the 5 different CNV aetiologies, the mean changes ranged 
from -65 to -97 μm in ranibizumab arm, and the treatment effect (between-treatment difference) was 
between -60 and -167 μm.  
With regards to macular volume, results in the subgroups were consistent with the outcome in the full data 
set and again ranibizumab was numerically favoured in all subgroups and there was a larger reduction in 
subjects with a baseline BCVA ≤60 letters. 
For subretinal fluids, the data were too limited to draw any meaningful conclusions in subgroups.

Primary efficacy evaluation based on observed data without any imputation 
for missing data may be questioned, however, missing data and major 
protocol deviations very limited. Outcomes in sensitivity analyses based on 
MV-LOCF and the PP were essentially identical as in the primary analysis. 
The effects observed in the ranibizumab treatment arm at month 2 were 
maintained at month 6 and 12 and improvements were observed in the 
previously sham-treated patients after switching to ranibizumab, but with 
regards to the effects on BCVA, the magnitude of the effect was slightly 
inferior compared to subjects that received ranibizumab from baseline.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Study G2301 included a non-randomised, open-label group of adolescent patients who were 12 years of age 
and older. One of the exploratory objectives of the trial was to describe the efficacy and safety of 
ranibizumab in adolescent patients by assessing the same efficacy and safety objectives as planned for adult 
patients where applicable and depending on the number of adolescent patients enrolled. 
For details on the study design and methodology see section 2.4.2.   
Results 
Overall, 5 adolescent patients were enrolled. All adolescent patients completed the 12-month study period 
and no patient discontinued from study drug. The age of adolescents ranged from 13 to 17 years at 
screening. Baseline aetiology was Best disease (CNV –miscellaneous) and idiopathic chorioretinopathy in 2 
cases each and optic disc drusen (CNV –miscellaneous) in 1 case. 
The results for change in BCVA and the key anatomical endpoint, CSFT (study eye) is shown below.

Supportive study(ies) 
A number of published, retrospective and prospective studies evaluating ranibizumab in the treatment of 
CNV secondary to other causes than AMD or PM have been provided by the MAH. Overall, they provide 
support for an effect on BCVA and retinal thickness.

In addition, the MAH provided the synopsis of study GFR01, an observational study of the efficacy, tolerance, 
and usage conditions of Lucentis in patients with CNV secondary to a pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) 
conducted in France.  
•  Study CRFB002GFR01  
Title of study: Observational study of the efficacy, tolerance, and usage conditions of Lucentis in 
patients with ocular complications secondary to a pseudoxanthoma elasticum  
Efficacy Objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients and of eyes with secondary to 
PXE that were treated with ranibizumab 
To describe the average number of ranibizumab injections, reasons for re-administration, the 
treatments other than ranibizumab and the average number of patient follow-up visits  
To describe the functional and anatomical changes in the patient/eye treated with ranibizumab (VA, 
spread of neovascularisation, retinal haemorrhages, retinal central thickness)  
Methodology: This was a national, multicentre, observational historical/prospective and 
prospective/dynamic cohort study performed in France by ophthalmologists. The purpose of the study was 
to describe and monitor patients, under the conditions of current medical practice. Participation in the study 
was voluntary and treatments and follow-up were according to the physician discretion. Physicians 
participating in the study identified patients through medical record review (retrospective review from 
7-Oct-2011, the date of temporary reimbursement), or prospectively during routine consultation. 
Table 13 - Study scheme 
Both eyes of each patient were followed-up in this study, even if only one eye was eligible. 
No specific patient planned calculation was performed due to the observational study design. A total of 75 
patients were enrolled and data for 72 patients were analysed. Patients were exposed from 7-Oct-2011 
(historical part). 
First patient enrolled: 05-Jun-2013, Last patient completed: 23-Sep-2014 (prospective part). 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Any patient with ocular complications secondary to PXE who had 
received at least one injection of ranibizumab no earlier than 7-Oct-2011 and signed the informed consent 
were eligible for inclusion. There were no specific exclusion criteria other than those who did not match those 
for inclusion. 
Test product, dose and mode of administration: IVT injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab  
There was no primary efficacy endpoint for this study. Observational data was collected and descriptive 
analyses conducted on the “patient” and “eyes” populations.

Results 
Demographic and background characteristics 
The majority of patients were men (54.2%), the mean age was 59.6 ± 8.3 years at the time of the consent, 
and 44.4% had complications secondary to PXE other than ocular. Prior to the first injection of the first 
treated eye, the majority of patients had ocular symptoms (90.3 %) and angioid streaks (91.7%). At the 
time of the first injection of ranibizumab, the mean VA was 65.4 ± 19.4 ETDRS letters for the treated eye, 
88.9 % of patients had CNV that were mainly subfoveal (37.5 %) and juxtafoveal (35.9 %), and 47.2% had 
ocular haemorrhages, of which 100% were retinal. On average, the initiation of first treatment with 
ranibizumab occurred within 1.4 years after the first ocular symptoms and within 0.9 years after the CNV 
diagnosis.  
The reasons for initial treatment with ranibizumab in the “patient” population were mainly due to diagnosis 
of ocular complications secondary to PXE (58.3%), followed by growth of neovascular activity (34.7%) and 
signs of exudation (31.9%), loss of VA (25.0%), haemorrhages (22.2%) and the systematic treatment 
matching a treatment of “precaution” without formal signs of CNV (15.3%).  
In the “eyes” population, overall, 35 eyes had received previous treatments prior ranibizumab initiation: 
22.4% of eyes were treated with an anti-VEGF other than ranibizumab, 17.3% with Visudyne, 9.2% by 
thermal laser, and 5.1% with corticosteroids.  
Efficacy results:  
While 98 eyes were available for analysis at the first injection, the number of eyes available for analysis 
decrease over time (N=72 eyes at 1 year follow-up, N=60 eyes at 2 years of follow-up, and N=28 eyes at 4 
years of follow up).  
The median number of ranibizumab injections or any other treatment was 4 treatments per year for the 
“patient” population and 3 treatments per year for the “eyes” population. The median number of monitoring 
visits per year was 8. 
The mean VA for the “eyes” population (N = 72) was relatively stable from first injection (64.6 ± 21.0 ETDRS 
letters) to the 2-year follow-up (N=58; 62.3 ± 20.4 ETDRS letters), and even up to 4-years of follow-up 
(N=24; 60.5 ± 20.3 ETDRS letters). Moreover, at 1 and 2 years, 59.7 % and 54.8 % of the “eyes” 
population, respectively, had a change in VA between -15 letters and 15 letters. The number of patients with 
blindness or visual impairment was limited to 29 patients during the course of the study. At the end of the 
study, 24 patients still had visual impairment, while VA was improved in 5 patients. Anatomically, the 
presence of CNV, angiographic leakage, and incidence of haemorrhages decreased during treatment with 
ranibizumab from the time of first injection through follow-up after 1, 2, and 4 years.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of ranibizumab for the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV due to any cause was 
supported by one single pivotal trial (study G2301, MINERVA).  
Apart from wAMD and PM, which have been studied separately and were assessed previously, the incidence 
and prevalence of individual CNV conditions are very low. As VEGF is suspected to be the common factor 
playing a key role in their pathophysiology, patients with various CNV conditions were grouped into the 
MINERVA study. This approach of combining all patients into a single study has previously been agreed by 
the CHMP in a scientific advice. As the study population was expected to be highly heterogeneous, 
randomization was stratified by the type of underlying ocular pathophysiologic mechanisms (angioid streaks 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 31/57 
 
  
  
versus others) and subgroups by aetiology and/or inflammatory status were predefined in order to at least 
have analysis groups with a potentially reduced heterogeneity. The subgroups included patients with CNV 
associated with angioid streaks, post-inflammatory retinochoroidopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, 
idiopathic chorioretinopathy and miscellaneous. In the miscellaneous subgroup, subjects with, for example, 
retinal angiomateous proliferation, macular/juxtafoveal telangiectasia Type 2 and trauma were included. 
However, some of the underlying conditions within the miscellaneous subgroup were represented by single 
or very few patients. From these limited data, no robust conclusions regarding the treatment effect can be 
drawn (see also discussion on efficacy results below). On the other hand, the anti-VEGF mechanism of action 
of ranibizumab in the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV is well characterised, whereby ranibizumab 
targets choroidal vessels irrespective of the underlying disease aetiology including rare conditions. Based on 
this as well as the results of the MINERVA trial and previously conducted studies in AMD and PM, an 
extrapolation to the full CNV indication including very rare aetiologies was considered justified. 
No dose-response study was conducted. Ranibizumab is intended to be administered in accordance with the 
dose (0.5mg) and method of administration (IVT) already included in the EU SmPC. No relevant PK 
differences were expected with respect to relevant groups of patients previously studied (i.e. AMD and PM 
populations) and the individualised posology (allowing monthly or less frequent injections) based on disease 
activity, as applied in the pivotal MINERVA study, was chosen to allow adjusting treatment to patients’ needs 
as the different conditions underlying the CNV may require different frequency of injections for an optimum 
treatment effect. The CHMP agreed in principle to the individualised patient treatment as it would prevent 
from administration of unnecessary IVT injections and derived risks. However, it constitutes another source 
of variability at the time of analysis. 
Overall, the inclusion criteria were considered acceptable, however, subjects without any visual impairment 
(83 letters) were allowed for inclusion and 4 such subjects were recruited (and randomised into the 
ranibizumab arm). According to the MAH, eligible patients also must have had active CNV with macular 
involvement, i.e. a condition that would be expected to lead to visual impairment, and that visual 
stabilisation is the treatment target in these patients. Visual stabilisation or a further improvement of BCVA 
was in fact achieved in the afore-mentioned 4 subjects. While not fully logical to include these subjects, it 
would not have affected the study outcome in favour of ranibizumab, nor does it impact on the proposed 
indication “treatment of visual impairment due to CNV”. 
The exclusion criteria were in line with those applied in previous studies with ranibizumab and considered 
largely reasonable and thus agreed. Two additional CNV conditions (PCV and RAP in subjects ≥50 years) 
were excluded in a protocol amendment since they were considered to be sub-categories of wAMD. Although 
the classification of these two conditions may not be clear cut, there are no objections to the strategy. The 
cut-off for previous treatment with intravitreal CS that may well have an effect on retinal thickness (and 
consequently VA) was set to 6 months which seems short in view of the long-lasting effect of available 
formulations of IVT fluocinolone acetonide (≥12 months) and the early evaluation of efficacy in MINERVA. 
However, no such prior use was reported for the study eye. 
As in previous studies with ranibizumab, patients in the control arm were given an imitation of an IVT 
injection using an injection syringe without a needle (sham). From Month 2, the sham-treated patients were 
allowed to switch to as-needed treatment with open-label ranibizumab, resulting in a rather short controlled 
study period (see discussion on primary efficacy assessment below). The need for re-treatment was based 
on clinical, anatomical or functional criteria of disease activity (e.g. BCVA impairment, intra-/sub-retinal 
fluid, haemorrhage or leakage). The strategies for treatment, re-treatment and rescue therapy (vPDT), were 
overall considered acceptable.  
Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were, as in previous trials based on BCVA and anatomical 
variables which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. Due to the short controlled duration of the trial, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 32/57 
 
  
  
exploratory ranking of vision-related quality of life (NEI-VFQ-25) is reasonable. Standard methods were 
used to assess/measure the endpoints.  
The evaluation of primary efficacy at Month 2 was early for a chronic condition and given the variable natural 
course of the different conditions involved in the trial a longer double-blind, controlled period would have 
been desirable. However, it is recognised that previous studies showed the onset of action of ranibizumab to 
be rapid and data for the previously approved CNV-associated conditions (wAMD and CNV) did not suggest 
that the effect would be of limited durability. The MAH’s arguments relating to the risk of a rapid worsening 
of the condition and the feasibility issues related to a longer controlled period are also recognised. Taken 
together, the strategy is accepted.  
A total of 178 patients were randomised (2:1) to the two treatment groups. Since no phase II study was 
performed, the sample size calculation was based on published data applying a 5% adjustment for missing 
data, which is endorsed in view of the primary efficacy evaluation at Month 2 (i.e. assuming only few missing 
data for such short time period). Measures to maintain masking are in line with previous trials with 
ranibizumab and acceptable. However, the fact that the majority of patients are expected to be on 
open-label ranibizumab from Month 2 onwards may make the benefit of the masking less reliable for 
follow-up visits as the patient may recognise the differences between a sham and a true IVT injection. 
The choice of statistical methods, i.e. MMRM and additional sensitivity analyses using ANCOVA, both 
assuming MAR for the missing data, was considered acceptable. A more conservative sensitivity analysis for 
estimating the treatment effect, with baseline observations carried forward, would have been preferred. 
However, all but 1 patient (sham) completed the 2 months and at Month 6 and 12, only 4 (1 ranibizumab and 
3 original sham patients) and 11 (7 ranibizumab, 4 sham) patients, respectively, had discontinued. Also, the 
number of critical protocol deviations was limited. The issue of multiple comparisons was not addressed in 
the protocol and there was no control for multiple testing. Formally, only the primary endpoint analysis can 
be considered confirmative. However, given that the secondary endpoints evaluating the anatomical 
variables were highly significant and consistency was observed with regards to other outcomes (see below), 
overall the conduct of the study was considered acceptable. 
Baseline demographics as well as ocular characteristics were overall reasonably balanced between 
treatment arms. In view of the overall robust outcome of the study (see discussion below), the few 
imbalances observed were considered unlikely to alter the results to a major extent. Considering the 
diversity of the diagnoses included, it is difficult to conclude whether the study population fully represented 
the spectrum of the target population. It is on the other hand recognised that some of the disease aetiologies 
are very rare and as previously discussed, the study population was considered adequate to support an 
umbrella CNV indication. The most common CNV subtype was located subfoveal (57% of patients) which is 
consistent with a population with impaired VA. Finally, concomitant medication use was as expected for the 
study population. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Two months after treatment initiation, statistically significant (at the one-sided alpha-level of 0.001) and 
clinically relevant differences were observed in favour of ranibizumab compared to sham. Mean changes of 
BCVA from baseline were +9.5 and -0.4 letters in the respective treatment arms [p (one-sided) < 0.001]. 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the data which would be expected in view of the limited 
number of premature withdrawals and major protocol deviations. After 2 months, the gain in BCVA 
essentially plateaued in the ranibizumab treatment group, and was maintained up to the end of the study at 
12 months. In the previously sham-treated group (could receive ranibizumab from Month 2 onwards), the 
12 months mean gain in BCVA did not fully reach the same magnitude as in patients treated from study start 
(11.0 vs. 9.3 letters). These results suggest an added value of early treatment initiation. However, the mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 33/57 
 
  
  
difference between treatment arms at Month 12 was limited with less than 2 letters, and the clinical 
relevance of such difference is questionable. 
The secondary efficacy outcomes related to VA also consistently favoured ranibizumab. The proportion of 
patients that experienced a clinically relevant gain in BCVA was larger in the ranibizumab treatment group 
with 19% and 28% more patients compared to sham gaining ≥15 and 10 letters in BCVA by Month 2. At 
Month 6 and 12, the proportions of patients with relevant gains in BCVA had increased further and almost 
half of the patients (45 and 49% at Month 6 and 12, respectively) that were treated with ranibizumab from 
study start had gained ≥15 letters in BCVA. Very few patients lost ≥10 or 15 letters in BCVA. However, some 
subjects in the sham group (8/57, >10%) had gained ≥10-15 letters (or reached 84 letters) at Month 2 
although conditions with a high likelihood of spontaneous resolution were to be excluded. Further review of 
these subjects clarified that 4 of them gained ≥ 10 letters in BCVA without reaching 84 letters and 4 reached 
84 letters. Furthermore, 5 of these subjects had close to normal BCVA at baseline (i.e. only a few letters 
change would be needed to reach the ceiling of 84 letters) and 5 needed treatment from Month 2 or later. 
This indicates that some subjects improved in BCVA without treatment despite the inclusion requirement of 
having an active CNV with macular involvement. Notably, there were 7 patients in the study, who never 
received ranibizumab during the study and 4 of them completed the study. For these patients, overall, the 
mean final gain in BCVA was similar compared to subjects from the sham-treatment group that did receive 
ranibizumab from Month 2. From the available data it was however not possible to identify a definite 
subgroup of patients who may improve without treatment. Also, the number of patients was very limited and 
variability was high and although these data provide some information on the BCVA pattern without 
treatment, no further conclusions can be drawn since any efficacy comparison between these 
non-randomised subgroups will be subject to bias. In any event, patients that do worse would be more likely 
to receive ranibizumab.  
Overall, the CHMP considered that, while in some subsets of patients a prompt treatment might be indicated, 
it may not be critical to initiate treatment as soon as possible in all subjects. Rather, the available data 
suggest that some CNV patients may not require treatment in order to maintain good vision. The decision 
when to initiate treatment may be best left at the discretion of the treating physician, weighing the potential 
benefit of early treatment against exposure to unnecessary treatment. The individualised dosing regimen 
based on disease activity is expected to lower the risk of unnecessary injections and the CHMP was of the 
view that no further recommendation could be given at the time of this report. The SmPC already states that 
if, in the physician’s opinion, visual and anatomic parameters indicate that the patient is not benefiting from 
continued treatment, Lucentis should be discontinued and this also applies to CNV of any cause. 
With regards to anatomical variables such as central subfield thickness (CSFT), presence of 
intra-/sub-retinal fluids and active leakage, a treatment effect in favour of ranibizumab was observed at 
Month 2 and the observed treatment differences compared to sham were highly statistically significant 
(p<0.001). A mean reduction of approximately 80 μm in CSFT was observed between baseline and Month 2 
in the ranibizumab-treatment group, which was of similar size as the reduction observed in the RADIANCE 
study, the pivotal trial supporting the use of ranibizumab in CNV secondary to PM. The initial declines in the 
CSFT, macular volume, intra- and subretinal fluids and leakage were maintained or slightly decreased 
further throughout the study. Analyses of the anatomical variables thus supported a beneficial effect of 
ranibizumab in CNV.  
Ranibizumab was also clearly favoured over sham in all subgroups, irrespective of disease aetiology, thus 
showing overall internal consistency of the study. At Month 2, the difference in BCVA change between 
treatment groups was largest in the subgroups with angiod streaks (14.6 letters), idiopathic 
chorioretinopathy (11.4 letters) and miscellaneous (10.6 letters), but ranibizumab was also favoured in the 
group with post-inflammatory retinochoroidopathy (6.5 letters) and in subjects with central serous 
chorioretinopathy (5.0 letters). While ranibizumab remained clearly in favour over sham, a smaller effect 
size was observed in elderly patients (> 60 years, 5 letter difference between treatment arms) compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 34/57 
 
  
  
younger patients (13.2 letters in the subset ≤ 60 years) and in those with higher baseline VA (8.1 letter 
difference in subjects with a baseline BCVA > 60 letters versus 13.7 letters in subjects with a baseline BCVA 
≤ 60 letters). These results were within the range observed in the RADIANCE study for the PM indication. 
Further, additional analyses of the 6 and 12 months data, maintenance of the benefit of ranibizumab was 
confirmed in all investigated subgroups and consistency across subgroups based on gender, disease 
characteristics and lesion location has been shown. The CHMP however noted that in the subgroup of 
patients with CNV - miscellaneous and in subjects with an extrafoveal location of the lesion, the initially 
sham-treated subjects appeared on average to have no, or a very limited effect of treatment after receiving 
ranibizumab from Month 2 onwards. But these data represents a rather limited number of patients and the 
variability was high. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that these subsets represent populations where 
treatment should be initiated at the time of diagnosis. 
Among the 15 different baseline aetiologies in the heterogeneous CNV-miscellaneous subgroup of patients 
(n=37), while overall a benefit of ranibizumab over sham was observed, for a few of the aetiologies no or a 
very limited beneficial effect was seen. However, these are data based on a single or few subjects and there 
were inconsistencies with regards to response to treatment and the randomisation to the treatment groups 
was uneven. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusions from these data applicable to a specific 
aetiology. As previously discussed, based on the underlying pathophysiology of abnormal growth of leaky 
vessels which is common to CNV irrespective of the cause and the anti-VEGF mechanism of action of 
ranibizumab, a broad CNV indication is still considered acceptable. The CHMP furthermore agreed to the 
MAH’s proposal for SmPC section 4.1; that is to list separately indications for wAMD and CNV (including PM), 
as compared to most of the other CNV conditions, wAMD occurs in an older population with additional risk 
factors and requires intense treatment. 
With regards to treatment frequency, on average half of the maximum number of injections was 
administered over the 12 months period of the trial, but the range was large. Some subjects received only 
one injection, while 13% (ranibizumab treatment group) to 19% (initially sham-treatment group) of 
subjects received monthly treatment. The CHMP was therefore of the view that section 4.2 of the SmPC 
should be updated to reflect the fact that some patients may only need one injection during the first 6 
months, while others may need monthly treatment. 
While maintenance of efficacy of ranibizumab has been shown for a duration of 12 months, given that at 
least in some subsets of patients, a chronic treatment might be required, long-term data beyond 12 months 
would have been desirable. The MAH argued however that the ongoing LUMINOUS study has and will provide 
long-term data in patients with wAMD and CNV due to PM. The 3-year observational CRFB002F2401 study 
will provide further data for patients with CNV secondary to PM. In addition, the observational PIXEL study 
study (CRFB002GFR01) provided data on 72 patients with ocular complications secondary to a 
pseudoxanthoma elasticum (with CNV being one of them) who received IVT ranibizumab for more than 
1 year under standard medical practice conditions. Overall, patients were observed to have stable VA up to 
2 years after study start based on functional observation (ETDRS), and in a smaller subset (n=24) up to 
4 years. CNV regression and/or stabilization was observed, as well as a decrease in angiographic leakage, 
and a decrease in the incidence of ocular haemorrhages during treatment with ranibizumab from the time of 
first injection through follow-up up to 4 years. The results suggest a beneficial effect of ranibizumab and 
were considered supportive in the context of this application. But given the existing differences between the 
PIXEL study population and the target population of the new indication as well as the uncontrolled design of 
the PIXEL study, the results should be interpreted with caution. Finally, the MAH referred to available 
long-term data in the scientific literature and emphasised the common role of VEGF in CNV independent on 
underlying aetiology. In view of the substantial experience gained with ranibizumab in subjects with CNV 
(although mainly from patients with wAMD) so far, the CHMP agreed that no further study was needed. 
Finally, with regards to the group of 5 adolescent patients, it would be expected that the efficacy profile 
would be largely in line with that in adults since the eye is fully developed in adolescent patients and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016

underlying disease mechanism are expected to be similar. While the data were to limited to draw firm 
conclusions, the observed mean gain in BCVA was almost 17 letters at Month 6 and 12 (with a range from 5 
to 38 letter gain at Month 12), which exceeded the number of letters gained in adults and was thus 
encouraging. The reduction in CSFT and SCFV was similar as in the adult population. Relevant data in the 
adolescent population were reflected in SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that, despite some limitations, the available data supported a robust and 
clinically relevant effect of ranibizumab in the treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to CNV 
when administered based on disease activity and when using an individualised treatment regimen. The 
observed gain in vision in the primary analysis of the pivotal MINERVA trial was highly convincing and further 
supported by secondary analyses addressing other aspects of functional outcomes as well as anatomical 
variables. Consistency among the different disease aetiologies as well as maintenance of the effect up to 
12 months has been shown. The CHMP therefore concluded that the available evidence for clinical efficacy 
was adequate to support the present application. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Lucentis has been approved and is marketed in the EU since 2006. The overall safety profile of Lucentis is 
well characterised. The majority of adverse reactions reported following administration of Lucentis are 
related to the IVT injection procedure. Based on previously conducted clinical trials, the most frequently 
reported (very common) ocular adverse reactions are vitritis, vitreous detachment, retinal haemorrhage, 
visual disturbance, eye pain, vitreous floaters, conjunctival haemorrhage, eye irritation, foreign body 
sensation in eyes, lacrimation increased, blepharitis, dry eye, ocular hyperaemia, eye pruritus and 
intraocular pressure (IOP) increased. The most frequently reported (very common) non-ocular adverse 
reactions are nasopharyngitis, headache and arthralgia. Less frequently reported (common), but more 
serious, ocular adverse reactions include retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogen traumatic cataract. 
Less frequently reported (common) non ocular adverse reactions are urinary tract infection, anaemia, 
hypersensitivity, anxiety, cough, nausea and allergic reactions. Rarely reported (uncommon) ocular adverse 
reactions include endophthalmitis, blindness, hypopyon, hyphamia, keratopathy, iris adhesion, corneal 
deposits, corneal oedema, corneal striae, injections site pain, injection site irritation, abnormal sensation in 
eye and eyelid irritation. 
There is also a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and myocardial infarction, 
following IVT use of VEGF inhibitors. In the wAMD phase III studies, non-ocular haemorrhages, an adverse 
event potentially related to systemic VEGF inhibition, was slightly increased in ranibizumab-treated patients 
compared to sham, however, without a consistent pattern among the different haemorrhages. An increased 
risk for death, cardiovascular accident and vascular death following monthly dosing of ranibizumab in DME 
patients compared to sham and laser treatment, has been shown (studies RIDE and RISE, and Avery et al., 
2015). 
The safety evaluation of the present application was conducted based on the known safety profile of Lucentis 
and the main new data assessed were derived from G2301 (MINERVA). Supportive data from the 
observational PIXEL study (GFR01) were also taken into consideration. 
Safety assessments in study G2301 consisted of collecting all adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events 
(SAEs), with their severity and relationship to study drug and/or ocular injection, and pregnancies. They 
Assessment report

included regular monitoring of ophthalmic examinations, haematology, blood chemistry and urine tests 
performed at central laboratory and regular assessments of vital signs. AEs were coded using the current 
MedDRA version available at the time of submission (Version 18.1). 
All safety analyses were performed in patients in the safety set (see section 2.4.2.1. for study methods). 
Safety and tolerability of 0.5 mg ranibizumab were compared to safety and tolerability of sham injections up 
to Month 2. For exposure and safety, patients’ data that were reported in the sham treatment arm for the 
period up to Month 2 were split into the sham with ranibizumab group and the sham without ranibizumab 
group for the period up to Month 6 and Month 12. Patients in the sham with ranibizumab group received at 
least 1 injection of ranibizumab in the study eye at or after Month 2, while patients in the sham without 
ranibizumab group received no ranibizumab injection(s) in the study eye. 
Patient exposure 
Exposure to ranibizumab over the course of study G2301 is summarised in Table 5. Briefly, 119 subjects 
have been treated with ranibizumab for up to 12 months, and of the 59 subjects who received sham up to 
2 months, 52 patients were treated with ranibizumab between Month 3 and 12. Seven subjects did not 
receive any administration of ranibizumab in the study eye during the reporting period. Prior to Month 6 the 
mean number of injections in the study eye was 3.7 out of 6 possible injections in the ranibizumab group and 
2.7 out of 4 possible injections in the sham with ranibizumab group. Up to Month 12, the mean number of 
injections in the study eye out of 12 possible injections was 5.8 in the ranibizumab group and 5.4 in the sham 
with ranibizumab group. Overall, 15 patients (12.6%) received the maximum possible 12 injections in the 
ranibizumab group, 10 patients (19.2%) received the maximum possible 10 injections in the sham with 
ranibizumab group, corresponding to monthly injections.  
Prior to Month 6, 6 patients in the ranibizumab group, 5 patients in the sham with ranibizumab group, and 
none in the sham without ranibizumab group, received injections in the fellow eye. The mean number of 
ranibizumab injections received in the fellow eye prior to Month 6 was 3.8 in the ranibizumab group and 3.4 
in the sham with ranibizumab group. In the ranibizumab group, 5 of the 6 patients received 1 to 6 injections 
in the fellow eye. In the sham with ranibizumab group, 5 of the 5 patients received 3 or 4 injections in the 
fellow eye. Up to Month 12, the mean number of injections in the fellow eye out of 12 possible injections was 
5.1 in the ranibizumab group and 3.8 in the sham with ranibizumab group.  
Patient disposition and baseline demographics of study G2301 are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Baseline 
disease (ocular) characteristics are shown in Table 3. Baseline aetiology was dominated by CNV-idiopathic 
chorioretinopathy in both treatment groups (31.1% in ranibizumab group and 44.1% in sham group). The 
CNV-miscellaneous group was almost twice as large in the ranibizumab group (24.4%) as in the sham group 
(13.6%). 
In study GFR01, 72 patients had an average duration of treatment with ranibizumab of 2.4 ± 2.2 years 
(median: 2.1 years) and the average number of injections was 4.1 ± 4.0 (median: 3). 
Adverse events 
Ocular adverse events 
•  Study eye 
A total of 14 (11.8%) and 11 (18.6%) patients in the ranibizumab and sham arm, respectively, experienced 
ocular adverse events (AEs) in the study eye up to Month 2, regardless of study drug relationship.  
At Month 12, the frequency of ocular AEs of the study eye was 25.2% (30 patients) in the ranibizumab 
group, 42.3% (22 patients) in the sham with ranibizumab group, and 42.9% in the sham without 
ranibizumab group.

•  Relation to study drug 
Up to Month 2, there were no ocular AEs of the study eye reported, which were suspected by the investigator 
to be related to study drug, neither in the ranibizumab arm nor the sham arms. From Month 2 to Month 6, 
3 ocular AEs which were suspected to be related to study drug were reported for 2 patients in the 
ranibizumab group (retinal cyst, vitreous floaters, and IOP increased) and 1 ocular AE was reported for 
1 patient in the sham with ranibizumab group (retinal pigment epithelial tear). No ocular AEs which were 
suspected to be related to study drug were reported in the sham without ranibizumab group. No ocular AEs 
of the fellow treated eye were suspected by the investigator to be related to study drug up to Month 6. Up 
to Month 12, no additional ocular AE suspected by the investigator to be related to study drug was reported. 
•  Relation to ocular injection 
Up to Month 2, the most commonly reported (≥2%) ocular AE of the study eye, suspected to be related to 
ocular injection was conjunctival haemorrhage (4.2% vs 1.7% in the ranibizumab arm and sham arm, 
respectively). Up to Month 6, the most commonly reported (≥5% in any arm) ocular AE was conjunctival 
haemorrhage (5.9% and 9.6% of patients in the ranibizumab group and the sham with ranibizumab group, 
respectively and none were reported in the sham without ranibizumab group). 
Up to Month 2, out of the 8 patients treated in the fellow eye, 2 patients experienced AEs related to ocular 
injection (conjunctival haemorrhage and increased IOP). Up to Month 6, 11 patients were treated with 
ranibizumab in the fellow eye including 6 in the ranibizumab group and 5 in the sham with ranibizumab 
group. Of these, 3 patients experienced ocular AEs in the fellow eye including 2 patients in the ranibizumab 
group (one with conjunctival haemorrhage and one with IOP  increased) and 1 patient in sham group 
(lacrimation increased and ocular hyperaemia). 
Up to Month 12, 12.6% of patients in the ranibizumab group, 23.1% of patients in the sham with 
ranibizumab group, and 14.3% of patients in the sham without ranibizumab group experienced an ocular AE 
of the study eye suspected by the investigator to be related to the ocular injection. The most commonly 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 39/57 
 
  
  
 
reported (≥ 2%) ocular AE suspected to be related to the ocular injection was conjunctival haemorrhage 
(5.9% and 11.5% of patients in the ranibizumab and the sham with ranibizumab groups, respectively and 
none of the patients in the sham without ranibizumab group). 
Up to Month 12, a total of 15 patients were treated in the fellow eye (7 in the ranibizumab group, 8 in the 
sham with ranibizumab group, and none in the sham without ranibizumab group). No additional ocular AEs 
were suspected by the investigator to be related to the ocular injection from Month 6. 
•  Severity 
Ocular AEs of the study eye up to Month 2 and up to Month 12 were predominantly of mild severity, 
regardless of study drug relationship. Up to Month 6, 14.3%, 23.1% and 28.6% of patients experienced mild 
AEs in ranibizumab, sham with ranibizumab and sham without ranibizumab, respectively. Up to Month 6, 1 
patient in the sham with ranibizumab group experienced severe reduced VA which was not suspected to be 
related to study drug. Up to Month 6, 1 patient in the ranibizumab group experienced severe retinal 
haemorrhage, which was not suspected to be related to study drug.  
From Month 2 to Month 6, 1 patient in the ranibizumab group experienced severe diabetic retinal oedema in 
the fellow untreated eye. From Month 6 to Month 12, 1 patient in the ranibizumab group experienced severe 
retinal detachment in the fellow untreated eye. Neither was suspected to be related to study drug.  
Non-ocular events 
A total of 28 patients, including 18 patients (15.1%) in the ranibizumab arm and 10 patients (16.9%) in the 
sham arm, experienced non-ocular AEs up to Month 2, with no AE preferred term being observed in at least 
5% of the patients in either treatment arm. The most frequently reported MedDRA system organ class (SOC) 
was gastrointestinal disorders (5.9% in the ranibizumab arm and none in the sham arm) with all AE 
frequencies <1%, followed by infections and infestations (3.4% in the ranibizumab arm and 6.8% in the 
sham arm) with all AE frequencies <2%. A total of 67 patients (45 [37.8%] in the ranibizumab group, 19 
[36.5%] in the sham with ranibizumab group, and 3 [42.9%] in the sham without ranibizumab group) 
experienced non-ocular AEs up to Month 6. The most commonly reported preferred term (≥5% in any 
group) was nasopharyngitis (7.6%, 11.5%, and 14.3% in the ranibizumab, sham with ranibizumab, and 
sham without ranibizumab arms, respectively). 
Back pain, hypertension, and headache were observed in at least 5% of the patients in the sham without 
ranibizumab group. Each of these three AEs was experienced by 1 patient (14.3%) in the sham without 
ranibizumab group (7 patients). In the other 2 groups (ranibizumab and sham with ranibizumab), the 
incidence of these events was <5%.  
Non-ocular AEs observed in at least 5% of patients in the ranibizumab group experienced AEs originating 
from the SOC gastrointestinal disorder, musculoskeletal and connective disorders and nervous system 
disorders. 
A total of 95 patients (67 [56.3%] in the ranibizumab group, 25 [48.1%] in the sham with ranibizumab 
group, and 3 [42.9%] in the sham without ranibizumab group) experienced non-ocular AEs up to Month 12 
(see below table). The most commonly reported preferred term was nasopharyngitis (11.8%, 17.3%, and 
14.3%, respectively). Influenza, back pain, sinusitis, and headache were also observed in at least 5% of the 
patients in the ranibizumab or sham with ranibizumab group.

Coded with MedDRA version 18.1. 
•  Relation to study drug 
No non-ocular AEs were suspected by the investigator to be related to study drug up to Month 2. Up to 
Month 6, 2 AEs were reported for 1 patient in the ranibizumab group (arrhythmia of moderate intensity and 
blood pressure increased of mild intensity) which were suspected by the investigator to be related to study 
drug. From Month 6 to Month 12, no additional non-ocular AE suspected by investigator to be related to 
study drug was reported. 
•  Relation to ocular injection  
Up to Month 2 and up to Month 6, there were no non-ocular AEs reported for patients treated with 
ranibizumab, which were suspected by the investigator to be related to the ocular injection procedure. Up to 
Month 12, 1 non-ocular AE (headache) was reported for a patient in the sham without ranibizumab group, 
which was suspected by the investigator to be related to the ocular injection procedure.  
•  Severity 
Up to Month 2, non-ocular AEs experienced by patients in the ranibizumab and the sham arm were 
predominantly of mild severity. One patient in the ranibizumab arm experienced a severe AE of foot fracture. 
No other severe AEs were reported up to Month 2.  
Up to Month 6 and 12, the majority of non-ocular AEs experienced by patients in the ranibizumab group and 
the sham with ranibizumab group were of mild or moderate severity. From Month 2 to Month 6, 2 additional 
severe non-ocular AEs occurred in the ranibizumab group (1 patient with sciatica and 1 patient with 
parkinsonism, also reported as an SAE), and in 1 patient in the sham with ranibizumab group (fecaloma, also 
reported as an SAE). From Month 6 to Month 12, 2 additional severe non-ocular AEs occurred in the 
ranibizumab group and 1 additional AE occurred in the sham with ranibizumab group including peripheral 
artery stenosis, invasive lobular breast carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.  
Supportive safety data from study GFR01 
Of the 72 study participants, 14 patients (19.4%) experienced at least one AE. The most frequent AEs 
observed by MedDRA SOC were eye disorders (10 patients, 13.9%), nervous system disorders (3 patients, 
4.2%) and infections and infestations (2 patients, 2.8%). The most frequently reported AEs were ocular pain 
(3 patients, 4.2%) and decreased VA (2 patients, 2.8%). All other AEs occurred occasionally with a

frequency equal to 1.4% (1 patient). Six patients (8.3%) reported at least one SAE, including ischemic 
cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack. No deaths were reported.  The non-serious AEs (n = 14) were 
mainly ocular (13/14), the majority were mild in severity (12/14) and were considered unrelated to study 
drug by the ophthalmologists (for those for which causality was available). However, 7 of them were 
considered potentially related to the IVT procedure (amaurosis fugax, retinal artery spasm, conjunctival 
haemorrhage, 2 cases of eye pain, blurred vision, and eye irritation). Among the non-ocular AEs cerebral 
vascular events were reported in 2 subjects (vertebral artery occlusion, carotid artery stenosis, ischemic 
cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack)

(ii) ocular AE of the untreated fellow eye, where n is the number of patients with an untreated fellow eye. 
Serious Adverse Events (ocular and non-ocular events) 
No SAEs were reported in any treatment group up to Month 2. Up to Month 6, a total of 6 patients 
experienced non-ocular SAEs, 3 patients in the ranibizumab group and 3 patients in the sham with 
ranibizumab group. Two of these SAEs, Parkinsonism and fecaloma, were severe in intensity; none of the 
SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment or ocular injection. Up to Month 12, there were no 
ocular SAEs in the study eye or in the fellow treated eye. One patient experienced an ocular SAE (retinal

detachment) in the fellow untreated eye judged as not suspected to be related to the study drug and ocular 
injection. Up to Month 12, a total of 12 patients experienced non-ocular SAEs, 8 patients in the ranibizumab 
group and 4 patients in the sham with ranibizumab group.

Immunological events 
Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 1.7% of the patients in the ranibizumab group and 3.4% in the 
sham group up to Month 2. Up to Month 6, 1 patient reported contrast media allergy in the ranibizumab 
group.  
Supportive safety data from study GFR01 
A total of 10 SAEs (recurrence of chronic macular oedema, ischemic cerebral infarction, transient ischemic 
attack, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic dilatation, vertebral artery occlusion, carotid artery stenosis, 
endophthalmitis, pilonidal cyst and visual acuity reduced) were reported in 6 patients. Five of the 10 SAEs 
(cerebral protuberance ischemic infarction, aortic dilatation, vertebral artery occlusion, carotid artery 
stenosis, and endophthalmitis) were severe in intensity. The causality of one SAE cerebral protuberance 
ischemic infarction was considered to be related to ranibizumab. The case of endophthalmitis was 
considered to be possibly related to the IVT procedure. None of these SAEs were attributed to the use of 
other treatment. No death was reported during the study.

Laboratory findings 
Overall, no shifts in haematology parameters were observed. One patient reported low platelets (criterion: 
<50x10E9/L) in the ranibizumab arm at baseline but they recovered during treatment. 
There were also no shifts in biochemistry values: In the ranibizumab arm, 1 patient had low sodium values 
(criterion: <120 mmol/L) at baseline which returned to normal post-baseline. An additional patient had high 
potassium values (criterion: >6.0 mmol/L) at baseline, which recovered with treatment at Month 2, but was 
elevated again at Month 6. 
Only sporadic changes were found in the urinalysis parameters over time. 
Vital signs, electrocardiogram and other observations related to safety 
Low pulse and high systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were observed in three patients in the 
ranibizumab arm up to Month 6. No electrocardiograms were performed in the study. No notable changes in 
vital signs were observed up to Month 12. 
Intraocular pressure 
Three patients in the ranibizumab arm met the criteria of IOP of 30 mmHg or greater of the study eye at any 
time post-baseline, with one of these incidents being reported post-baseline but pre-injection. There were 
no patients with IOP of 30 mmHg or greater in the fellow eye at any time post-baseline.

There were no patients with IOP of ≥ 30 mmHg in the study eye at any time post-baseline. 
Aetiology subgroups 
Based on baseline aetiology, there were no AEs which occurred up to Month 2 that constituted ocular safety 
concerns in 2 of the 5 subgroups: patients with angioid streaks and post-inflammatory retinochoroidopathy 
CNV. In patients with CNV-CSC and with idiopathic chorioretinopathy, 1 patient each in the ranibizumab and 
the sham arm experienced intraocular inflammation up to Month 2 (CNV-CSC: 5.9% and 16.7%; Idiopathic 
chorioretinopathy: 2.7% and 3.8%, respectively). In the subgroup of patients with miscellaneous disorders, 
1 patient (3.4%) in the ranibizumab arm experienced a non-ocular risk of non-myocardial arterial 
thromboembolic events up to Month 2.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
There was one pregnancy reported during the 12 Month period of study G2301. The patient was discontinued 
accordingly. Pregnant women were excluded from the study as were women of childbearing potential unless 
they used effective methods of contraception during dosing of study drug.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
An overview of discontinuations due to AEs is given in Table 17. Up to Month 2, one patient with idiopathic 
chorioretinopathy CNV, in the sham arm reported ocular AEs (macular oedema and reduced visual acuity) in 
the study eye on Day 4 of the study. The patient was discontinued from the study. The events resolved 80 
days later. The investigator considered these AEs not to be related to study drug. There were no patients 
who discontinued from the study due to non-ocular AEs up to Month 2. 
Up to Month 6, overall 3 patients discontinued permanently due to an SAE or AE. One patient discontinued 
permanently from study drug due to a non-ocular SAE in the ranibizumab group (benign pituitary tumour, 
assessed by investigator as unrelated to study drug). Two patients discontinued permanently from study 
drug due to AE, one patient discontinued due to an ocular event in the study eye in sham without 
ranibizumab group, and one patient discontinued due to a non-ocular AE in the ranibizumab group.  
No further patients discontinued from the study due to an AE up to Month 12.  
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing experience from use of Lucentis in the broad CNV indication including angioid 
streaks, post-inflammatory retinochoroidopathy, CSC, idiopathic choroidopathy and CNV-miscellaneous. 
Lucentis (ranibizumab) is approved for the treatment of wAMD since 2007, for the treatment of visual 
impairment due to DME and RVO since 2011 and for CNV secondary to PM since 2013. The estimated

cumulative post-marketing patient exposure since the International Birth Date i.e. from 30 June 2006 
through to 31 December 2014 is 3.7 million patient years (based on the number of ranibizumab vials and 
ranibizumab pre-filled syringes sold worldwide, PSUR 12). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main support for the safety evaluation of the present application was derived from the 12 months data 
of the pivotal controlled trial G2301 (MINERVA), including comparative data (ranibizumab versus sham) for 
the first 2 months of the study. The safety database comprised a total of 178 patients with visual impairment 
due to CNV and the vast majority of these (167 patients, 93.8%) completed Month 12. The submitted 12 
Month data also included data from five adolescent patients receiving open-label ranibizumab. In addition, 
supportive safety data from the observational study GFR01 (PIXEL) in patients with ocular complications 
secondary to PXE was submitted. Patients included in this study are closely related to some of the conditions 
covered by the MINERVA study and the proposed new indication of CNV, and a relevant number of subjects 
have been recruited and continued in the study up to 4 years. Thus, the data were considered supportive for 
the purpose of this application. 
Generally, the ocular AEs reported in the MINERVA study were few and mild in severity, usually occurring in 
single patients with a frequency of <5%, except for injection related conjunctival haemorrhage, reported up 
to Month 6 in 5.9%, 9.6% and 0.0% of the patients in the ranibizumab, the sham with ranibizumab (i.e. 
patients originally assigned to sham with at least 1 ranibizumab treatment at or after Month 2) and the sham 
without ranibizumab group (i.e. patients originally assigned to the sham group  with no ranibizumab 
treatment at or after Month 2), respectively. Up to Month 12, the pattern for conjunctival haemorrhage 
remained unchanged. In addition, conjunctivitis was reported in 3 patients (5.8%) in the sham with 
ranibizumab group compared to 2 patients (1.7%) and no patients in the ranibizumab and sham without 
ranibizumab group, respectively. Both conjunctival haemorrhage and conjunctivitis are known adverse 
reactions of Lucentis with a very common and common frequency, respectively. 
Cases of increased IOP were rare and the increase in pressure was transient. IOP increase is a very common 
adverse reaction of IVT ranibizumab and is an important identified risk addressed in the RMP of Lucentis. 
Overall, no new ocular adverse events or any change to known ocular adverse reactions of Lucentis were 
detected. However, the SmPC includes a warning in section 4.4 concerning risk factors associated with the 
development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after ant-VEGF therapy for wet AMD, including a large 
and/or high pigment epithelial retinal detachment. Pigment epithelial detachment is not uncommon in many 
disorders underlying CNV e.g. chorioretinopathy, high myopia, angioid streaks, central serous 
chorioretinopathy, and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, which may well be complicated by a retinal 
pigment epithelial tear. Thus, the risk factor applicable to wAMD may also be valid to the CNV indications and 
the CHMP was of the view that the warning should be updated by adding reference to other forms of CNV. 
Non-ocular AEs in MINERVA were generally few and mild in severity and reported in <5% of patients, except 
for nasopharyngitis. At Month 12 nasopharyngitis was reported in 11.8%, 17.3% and 14.3 in ranibizumab, 
sham with ranibizumab and sham without ranibizumab treated patients, respectively. Nasopharyngitis is 
already included in section 4.8 of the SmPC of Lucentis as a very common adverse reaction. 
Hypersensitivity reactions were reported (1.7% in ranibizumab vs 3.4% in the sham group) to a similar 
extent as in previous clinical trials. The significance of immunogenicity assessments is unknown since 
intraocular sampling for local immunogenicity is not acceptable and, consequently, no correlations to 
intraocular inflammation can be made. No increased risk for immunogenicity would be expected for the CNV 
population. The lack of additional assessment of immunogenicity is therefore found acceptable.

The arterial thromboembolic events reported by one patient and the case of non-myocardial arterial 
thromboembolic event in the ranibizumab group were of interest in light of the previously recognised 
theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and myocardial infarction with IVT 
anti-VEGF inhibitors. However, no further conclusions could be drawn based on the limited data in this 
application. 
No deaths were reported. By the end of the MINERVA study, 12 patients experienced SAEs, all of which were 
non-ocular events including 8 patients in the ranibizumab group and 4 patients in sham groups. None of the 
events was considered related to the drug.  
There was one pregnancy reported during the 12-months period of the study. The patient was discontinued 
accordingly, but the outcome has not been reported. VEGF is a major angiogenic factor involved in the 
formation of new blood vessels during embryonic and foetal development and placentation, and ranibizumab 
can reach the systemic circulation and inhibit VEGF systemically. Although the systemic exposure of 
ranibizumab is low the target population of CNV includes women in child-bearing age. Ranibizumab should 
not be used during pregnancy and it is recommended that women wait at least 3 months after last dose 
before conceiving a child. This is adequately addressed in the SmPC. The MAH should report the outcome of 
the pregnancy in next PSUR. 
With regards to the safety in the 5 adolescent patients, the data presented were far too limited to draw any 
conclusions on possible differences in the AE profile between adults and adolescents. It would be expected 
that the safety profile would be largely in line with that in adults since the eye is fully developed in adolescent 
patients, the systemic exposure of ranibizumab is overall low, and the underlying disease mechanism is 
expected to be similar. Overall, the AEs reported in the adolescents were mainly due to the injection 
procedure, which is in line with what has been observed with the use of Lucentis adults. This was considered 
reassuring. 
The clinical safety profile in the observational PIXEL study in patients with PXE was generally in line with the 
known safety profile of Lucentis, with the majority of AEs being ocular and potentially related to the injection 
procedure. Among the non-ocular AEs, cerebral vascular events were reported in 2 patients (vertebral artery 
occlusion, carotid artery stenosis, ischemic cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack). According to the 
MAH, as cardiovascular impairment and haemorrhages are part of the vascular manifestations of the 
disease, an increased risk of vascular events in patients with PXE treated with VEGF inhibitors cannot be 
ruled out. This may be a specific source of concern in this population. Furthermore, closely related terms 
such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, non-myocardial ATE and venous thromboembolic events are 
important potential risks in the RMP of Lucentis. No immediate action was required; the issue should be 
followed in future PSURs. 
Overall, no new AEs were identified. Ocular and non-ocular key safety concerns are few and AEs were 
consistent throughout the study periods. Although the data are limited due to the small size of the studies 
and number of injections, the data was considered by the CHMP generally reassuring. However, there were 
too few exposed subjects per condition for a reasonable detection of common AES. Aetiology subgroup data 
is limited and uncertainties remained if there was varying vulnerability of the different aetiological 
subgroups. In light of the low prevalence of some of the conditions the CHMP considered that the issue would 
best followed up in future PSURs. 
The CHMP also noted that Lucentis has been approved for more than 10 years including for use in wAMD 
(since 2006) and PM (since 2013), the most common causes of CNV. From previous clinical trial and 
post-marketing data, substantial knowledge of the safety of the use of Lucentis in these conditions, in 
particular wAMD, has been gained. Compared to the already approved CNV related indication wAMD, the 
broad CNV population proposed with the present application (i.e. CNV due to any cause) is generally younger 
and fewer IVT injections are expected to be administered. Although CNV due to any cause is heterogeneous 
with mixed aetiologies (some isolated eye disorders, whereas others include systemic disorders), with some 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 47/57 
 
  
  
of the underlying conditions being rare, overall, the CHMP agreed that the safety data base consisting of the 
newly presented clinical data from MINERVA and PIXEL, together with the experience of the use of Lucentis 
in the already approved indications, was sufficient to support the present application.  
As already discussed in section 2.4.3, further long-term safety data beyond 12 months would have been 
desirable given the need for chronic treatment in at least some subgroups of CNV patients. The LUMINOUS 
study including patients of all indications is ongoing but at a late stage, so that the new indication could not 
be included. Given the substantial experience gained with ranibizumab in subjects with CNV (although 
mainly from patients with wAMD) so far, and since VEGF plays a key-role in the pathophysiology of CNV, the 
CHMP agreed that no further study was needed. 
Finally, the need for additional Pharmacovigilance measures with regards to the RMP safety concern of AEs 
related to paediatric off-label use was reviewed. While previously a PIP waiver had been agreed with regards 
to CNV, as it was not considered feasible to recruit a sufficient number of children in a clinical study with 
Lucentis in this indication, concerns remained about the safety of IVT injections in children, which are known 
to occur in clinical practice. A cumulative review of known cases of use of Lucentis in paediatric patients 
provided by the MAH, showed retinopathy of prematurity as the dominating indication in almost 50% of the 
patients treated. A study is already ongoing to investigate the use for ranibizumab in neonates with 
retinopathy of prematurity, which was considered reassuring as these patients represent a very vulnerable 
population in which the eye is not fully developed. To improve the reporting of cases, the Pharmacovigilance 
and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) furthermore decided on implementing a targeted follow-up 
questionnaire as part of the routine pharmacovigilance activities including age of child, condition being 
treated, dose regimen used, and any efficacy data if available. The results should be reported in future 
PSURs. Other means to gather additional data such as a prospective registry or a drug utilisation study were 
considered not feasible and potentially even promotional. The CHMP endorse the PRAC position. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety assessment was based on limited data due to the small size of the study, limited study duration 
and number of injections. Also, the CNV population is heterogeneous with several different aetiologies of 
CNV, some of which are very rare. However, no new safety concerns were detected and, despite the 
limitation of the data, the safety profile of Lucentis in CNV patients appeared to be broadly in line with that 
reported in the previously approved indications.  
In conclusion, the CHMP was of the view that the available safety data were sufficient to support the 
application for extending the indication of Lucentis to treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due 
to CNV. Considering the limitations of a small heterogeneous population, the CHMP was furthermore of the 
view that the safety profile should continue to be monitored in future PSURs.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated 
(see below) and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Changes to SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2 and 
4.4 are shown below (additions are shown in bold und underlined, deletions are shown a strike-through). 
For all other changes, please refer to attachment 1 of this report. 
SmPC section 4.1 
Lucentis is indicated in adults for: 
• 
The treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
•  The treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) 
• 
• 
• 
The treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) 
The treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion 
(branch RVO or central RVO) 
The treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to 
pathologic myopia (PM) 
SmPC section 4.2  
(…) 
The treatment of visual impairment due to CNV should be determined individually per patient 
based on disease activity. Some patients may only need one injection during the first 6 months; 
others may need monthly treatment. For CNV secondary to pathologic myopia (PM), many 
patients may only need one or two injections during the first year (see section 5.1). 
In the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM, many patients may only need one or two 
injections during the first year, while some patients may need more frequent treatment (see section 5.1).

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Lucentis in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not 
been established. Available data in adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with visual 
impairment due to CNV are described in section 5.1. 
The safety and efficacy of Lucentis in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis 
of a bridging report making reference to Lucentis PI. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been 
found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Wet AMD followed by PM are the most common causes of CNV. Other causes of CNV, e.g. angioid streaks, 
post-inflammatory retinochoroidopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, idiopathic CNV, and other 
miscellaneous diseases are rare. They typically occur in young, working age persons, and can be multifocal, 
binocular, and recurrent. Although a highly heterogeneous group of patients in which different rates of 
progression would be expected, CNV irrespective of the underlying aetiology is associated with abnormal 
leaky vessel formation as well as vision loss by disturbing the retinal neurosensory structure, due to 
exudation of intra- or subretinal fluid, haemorrhage, and fibrosis formation. Currently, treatments for CNV 
related to these various conditions include submacular surgery, laser photocoagulation, and off-label 
photodynamic therapy with verteporfin and locally administered VEGF-inhibitors. While published data in the 
scientific literature suggest a beneficial effect of VEGF-inhibitors, the efficacy with the other treatment 
modalities is reported as limited. There is thus a clear need for effective treatment options. 
Amongst other indications, ranibizumab is currently authorised in the EU for the treatment of wAMD as well 
as visual impairment due to PM. For these indications, efficacy of ranibizumab has been demonstrated in 
three (wAMD) and one (PM) pivotal controlled clinical trials. Based on its anti-VEGF activity, since VEGF is 
suspected to be the common factor playing a key role in the pathophysiology of CNV in general, ranibizumab 
is also thought to be effective in CNV due to other causes than wAMD and PM. To support this claim, the MAH 
conducted one pivotal 12-months study (study G2301, MINERVA) comparing IVT ranibizumab with sham in 
patients with various CNV conditions.  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the pivotal MINERVA trial, ranibizumab was superior to sham at Month 2 in the primary efficacy endpoint, 
change of BCVA compared to baseline. Ranibizumab-treated patients had a mean (LS) gain in BCVA of 
9.5 EDTRS letters at Month 2 compared to a loss of 0.4 letters in patients receiving sham. The difference 
between treatments was 9.94 letters (one-sided p-value <0.001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the 
robustness of the primary analysis data which is not surprising given the limited number of premature 
withdrawals and major protocol deviations. In the ranibizumab treatment group, the gain in BCVA 
essentially reached maximum levels at Month 2 and was maintained for the total duration of the study up to 
12 months. In the previously sham-treated group, i.e. patients who received sham up to Month 2 and 
thereafter ranibizumab, a gain in BCVA of 9.3 letters was achieved by Month 12.  
The secondary efficacy outcomes consistently favoured ranibizumab and at Month 2, 31.4% (37/118) of 
patients treated with ranibizumab experienced a ≥15 letters improvement in BCVA versus 12.3% (7/57) of 
patients on sham. At 12 months, the proportions with relevant gains in BCVA had increased further and close 
to half of the patients (55/128, 48.79%) that were treated with ranibizumab from study start and slightly 
less (23/55, 41.8%) in patients who initially received sham had gained ≥15 letters.  
With regards to anatomical variables such as central subfield thickness, presence of intra-/sub-retinal fluids 
and active leakage, ranibizumab was consistently favoured over sham and the effects were highly 
statistically significant (p<0.001, one-sided). Ranibizumab was further consistently favoured in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/757247/2016 
Page 52/57 
 
  
  
subgroups by various CNV conditions, by age (≤60 years, >60 years) and baseline BCVA (≤60 letters, > 
60 letters). The differences between treatment groups were largest in the subgroups with angioid streaks 
(14.6 letters), idiopathic chorioretinopathy (11.4 letters) and miscellaneous (10.6 letters), but ranibizumab 
was also favoured in the group with post-inflammatory retinochoroidopathy (6.5 letters) and in subjects with 
central serous chorioretinopathy (5.0 letters). The treatment effect was maintained over time in all 
subgroups.  
Finally, given that the anti-VEGF mechanism of action of ranibizumab is valid regardless of the underlying 
cause of CNV, data from previous studies with ranibizumab in the approved indications, and in particular in 
patients with wAMD and visual impairment due to PM, were considered of relevance for understanding the 
treatment of CNV due to various aetiologies and supportive in the context of the present application. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
This application was based on a single pivotal study of limited size (178 randomised patients). Considering 
the diversity of the aetiologies included, it was difficult to conclude whether the study population was fully 
representative of the spectrum of the target population. However, given that some of the conditions are very 
rare, the approach to group all aetiologies into a single study was agreed by the CHMP. Furthermore, in light 
of the consistent results across all aetiology subgroups as well as previous studies in wAMD and PM, all of 
which favouring ranibizumab over sham, and since the inhibition of VEGF is thought to be the common 
mechanism of action in CNV regardless of the underlying cause, the CHMP considered the available data 
sufficient to support a broad CNV indication. 
This was despite the fact that within the 15 different disease aetiologies represented in the CNV subgroup 
miscellaneous, for a few of the aetiologies no or only a very limited benefit was indicated. However, some of 
these findings were based on a single or very few subjects and there were uneven randomisation to 
treatment and inconsistencies in the treatment effects observed, so that it was not possible to draw firm 
conclusions. It is however of importance to avoid unnecessary treatment. In this context, the CHMP noted 
that a number of subjects in the sham group (14%) had gained ≥10-15 letters or reached normal BCVA 
(84 letters) at Month 2 despite evidence of an active CNV with macular involvement and despite exclusion of 
CNV conditions with a high likelihood of spontaneous resolution. Similarly, over the course of the study, a 
few subjects who did not receive ranibizumab after Month 2 maintained or gained BCVA over the course of 
the study. However, from the available data it was not possible to identify a definitive subgroup of patients 
who may improve without treatment. The patient population represents a heterogeneous group of patients 
with not necessarily similar clinical pictures regarding clinical manifestations, prognosis or expected 
response to treatment. Data from patients initially receiving sham, in fact suggest a benefit of early 
treatment initiation. In the previously sham-treated group the 12 months mean gain in BCVA did not reach 
the same magnitude (+9.3 letters) as in patients receiving ranibizumab from study start (+ 11.0 letters). 
However, the mean difference between treatment arms at Month 12 was limited with less than 2 letters, and 
the clinical relevance of such difference is questionable. The individualised dosing regimen based on disease 
activity was considered appropriate for a heterogeneous patient population like this, as it will allow the 
physician to decide on a case by case basis when best to initiate treatment. At the same time, although it 
cannot be excluded that some unnecessary treatment may be given, the individualised dosing regimen is 
expected to lower this risk. The SmPC (section 4.2) already states that, if, in the physician’s opinion, visual 
and anatomic parameters indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, Lucentis 
should be discontinued, a recommendation also considered valid for CNV due to any cause.  
The study period was another source of uncertainty. An early switch of patients in the control arm to active 
treatment was made and from Month 2 onwards all patients received ranibizumab. Thus, only 2 months 
active comparison of ranibizumab versus sham was available. In light of the variable natural course of the 
different conditions involved in the trial a longer double-masked, active controlled period would have been

EMA/757247/2016 
Page 53/57 
 
  
  
desirable as long-term treatment is foreseen in many of these patients. However, given the rapid onset of 
action of ranibizumab and the favourable effect shown over placebo across the efficacy analyses, the 2 
months data were overall considered satisfactory.  
In terms of long-term data, the MINERVA study was limited to a maximum 12 months observation period 
and seeing that, at least in some subsets of patients, chronic treatment may be needed, data beyond this 
period would be desirable. A substantial experience of the long-term use of ranibizumab has however been 
obtained in patient with wAMD. Additional data in patients with CNV due to PM are under way in LUMINOUS 
and in the 3-year observational study. Given the common role of VEGF in CNV irrespective of the underlying 
aetiology, long-term data in patients with wAMD and PM were considered by the CHMP to be also relevant for 
CNV due to any cause. Further, some additional, although mainly safety related data has been generated 
through the PIXEL study as well as from published data where subjects relevant for the now targeted CNV 
indication have been treated with ranibizumab for up to 4 years. Altogether, the data were considered 
reassuring and no further studies were considered necessary. 
Unfavourable effects 
Risks 
The most commonly reported adverse events up to Month 12 in the MINERVA trial were conjunctival 
haemorrhage and nasopharyngitis. Conjunctival haemorrhage was reported up to Month 12 in 5.9%, 11.5% 
and 0.0% in ranibizumab, sham with ranibizumab and sham without ranibizumab group, respectively. 
Nasopharyngitis was reported in 11.8%, 17.3% and 14.3% in ranibizumab, sham with ranibizumab and 
sham without ranibizumab group, respectively.  
Overall the safety profile observed in MINERVA was consistent with the known safety profile of Lucentis. The 
main concerns of IVT use of ranibizumab relate to important identified ocular risks including 
endophthalmitis, ocular inflammation, retinal detachment and tear, retinal pigment epithelial tear, vitreous 
haemorrhage as well as IOP increased and cataract. Further, because of the theoretical risk of arterial 
thromboembolic events with IVT anti-VEGF inhibitors, relevant important potential risks are myocardial 
infarction and non-myocardial arterial thromboembolic events. Within the safety database relevant to the 
present application, i.e. clinical trials in patients with CNV secondary to PM (RADIANCE) and due to any 
cause other than wAMD and PM (MINERVA), AEs for most of these risks were only observed in few or in no 
patents at all. However, the limited size of the safety database in CNV patients precludes the detection of 
rare events and realistic frequency estimations.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The broad, heterogeneous population of patients with CNV have not been studied before, and some of the 
conditions are potentially linked to risk factors for ocular safety concerns; for example, the experience of 
ranibizumab use in post-inflammatory conditions is especially limited. There are too few exposed subjects 
per individual condition for a reasonable detection of common AEs and there may be differences in incidence 
and severity between the different aetiologies. However, no obvious clustering of any AE in a specific 
aetiology group was observed and thus a higher vulnerability in any aetiology subgroup was not shown. 
However, considering the limited data of the respective subgroup in the study and the low prevalence of 
these conditions, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Further surveillance in PSURs is expected. This also 
includes monitoring of patients with PXE, i.e. patients that already have an increased risk of vascular events. 
In general, the safety database was limited due to the small study size, limited duration up to 12 months and 
limited number of injections. However, given the substantial experience gained with ranibizumab in subjects 
with CNV (although mainly from patients with wAMD) so far, and since VEGF plays a key-role in the 
pathophysiology of CNV, regardless of the cause, the CHMP agreed that the data were sufficient to support 
this application.

(1) Patients in the sham group received double-blind sham up to Month 2 and thereafter switched to open-label 
ranibizumab 0.5 mg as needed. All but 7 sham-treated patients received ranibizumab at or after Month 2. 
(2) The limited size of the safety database in CNV patients precludes the detection of rare events and realistic frequency 
estimations. The unfavourable effects displayed above therefore represents the integrated data for the CNV indication 
including the 12-month data from study F2301 (RADIANCE) for CNV secondary to PM, i.e. a total of 343 patients. Due to 
the difference of the comparator period (MINERVA study had primary endpoint assessment at Month 2 and F2301 at 
Month 3), and it’s limited duration, a comparison of the 12-month data is provided. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The pivotal MINERVA trial showed a mean difference of 10 letters in BCVA between ranibizumab and sham 
after 2 months of treatment based on disease activity in this rare and heterogeneous patient population. This 
beneficial effect on vision was mirrored by the rate of patients with a relevant gain in vision under treatment 
(≥15 EDTRS letters in BCVA) with 31.4% (37/118) of patients receiving ranibizumab compared to 12.3% 
(7/57) of sham treated patients. These clinically relevant gains in VA were maintained until the end of the 
study, i.e. up to Month 12. Furthermore, the observed functional improvements in vision were supported by 
clear effects on anatomical variables including a reduction in central subfield thickness with a -86.79 µm 
difference between treatment groups at Month 2, which shows that ranibizumab reduces fluid accumulation 
in the retina, the main cause of vision loss in CNV patients. The observed effects were statistically compelling 
and of clear clinical value in particular for those conditions for which no or only suboptimal treatment options 
were available, e.g. CNV due to angioid streaks. The consistent effect of ranibizumab across all subgroups 
including those by disease aetiology further supports robustness of the study outcome. While some of the 
underling conditions were too rare to demonstrate a beneficial effect, in light of the totality of the available 
data including previous studies in wAMD and PM, all of which favouring ranibizumab over sham, and since 
the inhibition of VEGF is thought to be the common mechanism of action in CNV regardless of the underlying 
cause, the CHMP considered the available data sufficient to support a broad CNV indication. 
Despite some limitations of the safety database supporting this application, due to the limited number of 
patients and injections, study duration and the rarity of some of the CNV aetiologies, the safety profile as 
observed in MINERVA was reassuring and consistent with the previously reported safety profile of Lucentis. 
The overall safety profile of Lucentis is well characterised. With treatment, there is a risk of injection-related 
adverse events that may be serious (e.g. endophthalmitis, retinal detachment). However, in the new CNV 
patient population, the mean number of injections administered would be expected to be fewer than in 
previously studied conditions including wAMD. There is also a risk of serious non-ocular adverse events, 
potentially related to systemic VEGF-inhibition. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The observed benefits of ranibizumab in the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV, namely an 
improvement of visual acuity by an average of 10 letters and a reduction in retinal thickness and fluid 
accumulation, outweigh the risks of mainly ocular adverse reactions which were largely related to the 
injection procedure.  
Uncertainties arising from the rarity of some of the aetiologies and the limited study size were at least to 
some extent addressed by the well characterised anti-VEGF mechanism of action of ranibizumab which is 
common to the treatment of conditions involving growth of abnormal leaky vessels including wAMD and CNV 
secondary to PM, indications in which a positive benefit-risk balance of ranibizumab has previously been 
demonstrated. Furthermore, an individualised dosing regimen by disease activity will allow physicians to 
adjust treatment to the needs of a heterogeneous patient population, including early treatment initiation in

patients at risk of vision loss. At the same time, such treatment regimen would be expected to reduce the 
risk of unnecessary injections.  
The CHMP furthermore agreed to list separately indications for wAMD and CNV due to other causes 
(including PM). Compared to most of the other CNV conditions, wAMD occurs in an older population with 
additional risk factors and requires intense treatment.

Extension of Indication to include treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) 
based on data from the pivotal study CRFB002G2301 (MINERVA). Consequential changes have been 
implemented in SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. An updated RMP version 16.2 was agreed during the procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Xofigo 
in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Annex II 
The study results do not show an increase in the risk of 
EMEA/H/C/PSR/S/0034 – Variation 
death or cancer–specific death within the scope of the 
currently authorised therapeutic indication (third and later 
lines of therapy or in patients ineligible for any available 
systemic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
treatment). Therefore, in view of available data regarding 
the PASS final study report, the PRAC considered that 
removal of the condition of the marketing authorisation and 
respective changes to the Risk Management Plan were 
warranted.

Please refer to the assessment report: Xofigo EMEA/H/A-
726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
30 November 2017 the opinion of the European 
Medicines Agency further to analyses of preliminary 
data of a clinical trial evaluating Xofigo in a patient

population with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic 
prostate cancer (ERA-223), found that the incidences 
of treatment emergent fractures and deaths were 
increased in the treatment arm (radium-223 
dichloride plus abiraterone acetate and 
prednisone/prednisolone) compared to the control 
arm (placebo plus abiraterone acetate and 
prednisone/prednisolone). The CHMP was requested 
to assess the impact thereof on the benefit-risk 
balance of Xofigo and to give its recommendation 
whether the marketing authorisation of this product 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
As the request results from the evaluation of data 
resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the 
CHMP opinion should be adopted on the basis of a 
recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk 
Assessment Committee. 
The notification for the procedure is appended to this 
recommendation.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Xofigo 
in the approved indication remains favourable, but 
recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
Page 6/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
grounds: 
• 
Results from an ad-hoc analysis of study 15396 
(EudraCT 2013-003438-33) involving the use of Xofigo in 
combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone 
in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic 
metastatic CRPC indicated that there may be an increased 
incidence of fractures and deaths among patients receiving 
Xofigo in combination with abiraterone acetate and 
prednisone/prednisolone compared to patients receiving 
placebo in combination with abiraterone acetate and 
prednisone/prednisolone.  
• 
At its November 2017 plenary, PRAC agreed that a 
thorough evaluation of the issue should be within a 
procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. 
This procedure has not concluded but may result in the 
introduction of specific risk minimisation measures or an 
obligation for the MAH to undertake a post-marketing study 
to gather further safety data that may impact on the 
benefit risk balance of the product. 
• 
At the March plenary meeting PRAC agreed that 
provisional routine risk minimisation measures in the form 
of updates to the product information would be necessary 
to minimise the risks of fractures and death associated with 
the use of radium-223 dichloride treatment initiated 
concurrently with abiraterone acetate and 
prednisone/prednisolone treatment. These changes include 
amendments to sections 4.3, 4.4, and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The PRAC considered that radium-223 dichloride should be 
contraindicated in combination with abiraterone acetate 
and prednisone/prednisolone. Further warnings and 
precautions of use relating to the risks of fracture and 
death among patients receiving Xofigo in combination with 
Page 7/14 
 
 
 
 
 
abiraterone acetate and prednisone/prednisolone were also 
included together with important information that the 
safety and efficacy of combination with second generation 
androgen receptor antagonists (e.g. enzalutamide) have 
not been established.

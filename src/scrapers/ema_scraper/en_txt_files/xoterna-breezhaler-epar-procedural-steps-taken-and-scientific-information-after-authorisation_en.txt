are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Results of the study showed that a statistically significant 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Submission of the final study report of the Category I 
Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) 
CQVA149A2402 (Multinational database cohort study 
in Europe in COPD patients, to assess the incidence 
rates and hazard ratios of various safety outcomes in 
new users of indacaterol/glycopyrronium compared 
to new users of comparator drugs (at the drug-class 
level).  
The Product Information has been updated by the 
removal of the black triangle and amendments in 
Annex II.D (Conditions or restrictions with regard to 
the safe and effective use of the medicinal product). 
The RMP version 5.0 has been submitted accordingly. 
C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required 
II and PL 
increased incidence of all-cause mortality was identified for 
the QVA149 treatment cohort when compared to the Fixed-
/Free LABA+LAMA. There was a tendency towards more 
patients treated with QVA149 as compared to the other 
Fixed/Free LABA+LAMA cohorts, developing a Major 
Cardiovascular Endpoint. There is no mechanistic or 
biologic reason to believe that QVA149 should increase 
mortality compared to other fixed or free combination (-
product)s of LABA+LAMA therefore the observed imbalance 
does not represent a true safety finding. In addition, 
despite including real-world data and including a high 
number of patients in each treatment cohort, a number of 
limitations were observed with the study and generalisation 
of the results cannot be made. Overall, the study is 
confounded with multiple biases limiting any firm 
conclusions. Routine pharmacovigilance activities are 
considered sufficient. 
Changes in the product information relate only to the 
deletion of the PASS commitment in Annex II and 
consequent removal from the list of additional monitoring 
(black triangle) in the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

Labelling and 
the MAH, following the conclusion of two recent clinical 
PL 
studies, CQVA149A2339 and CQVA149A2318 led to the 
Update of section 4.8 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) to add dysphonia and to 
bring up to date the list of adverse drug reactions 
and frequencies following a MAH’s comprehensive 
review of all safety data. Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
was updated with regards the warning on paradoxical 
bronchospasm accordingly. The Package Leaflet (PL) 
is updated accordingly. The MAH also took this 
opportunity to update the Product Information as per 
the latest QRD template. 
A new Risk Management Plan (RMP) version (version 
2.1) has been approved. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
update of all listed adverse drug reactions in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. Hypersensitivity, Hyperglycaemia and diabetes 
mellitus and Bladder obstruction and urinary retention are 
now listed as common reported ADRs. Gastroenteritis and 
musculoskeletal pain are now listed under uncommonly 
reported ADRs and paraesthesia as a rare ADR. The 
warning regarding paradoxical bronchospasm is updated to 
reflect that this may happen during treatment as with other 
inhalation therapies. 
Dysphonia is identified as a new ADR uncommonly reported 
during the treatment and is added to section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
The PL is updated accordingly and Annex II, Annex IIIA 
have been brought in line with the latest QRD template.

study objective of non-inferiority in rate of all COPD 
exacerbations (mild, moderate or severe) compared to 
fluticasone/salmeterol. The number of all COPD 
exacerbations/patient-years was 3.59 for QVA149 (4,531 
events) and 4.03 for fluticasone/salmeterol (4,969 events). 
QVA149 further showed superiority in reducing the 
annualised rate of all exacerbations by 11% versus 
fluticasone/salmeterol (p=0.003). 
Results also showed a significant effect on health related 
quality of life measured using the St. George’s Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ) as indicated by a reduction in SGRQ 
total score at 52 weeks compared to fluticasone/salmeterol 
(LS mean treatment difference  1.3, p=0.003).

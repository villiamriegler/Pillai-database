2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Voncento (previously Biostate) contains human plasma derived Factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand 
factor (VWF) as active substances. VWF and FVIII are two distinct glycoproteins that circulate in plasma 
in the form of a non-covalently bound complex. Both factors are essential for normal haemostasis in 
humans. Deficiencies in FVIII or VWF lead to two distinct hereditary coagulation disorders: haemophilia A 
and von Willebrand disease (VWD). 
Voncento belongs to the pharmacological class of hemostatic agents. The product is administered by 
intravenous infusion to raise FVIII and VWF levels in patients with corresponding deficiencies.

Von Willebrand Disease 
Clinically, VWD is a heterogeneous group of disease variants, each characterized by distinct quantitative 
or qualitative abnormalities in VWF, resulting in defective or deficient function. Patients with VWD are 
classified into Types 1, 2, and 3. Type 1 is the most commonly documented form of VWD, accounting for 
70-80% of cases, Type 2 accounts for approximately 20% of all diagnosed cases, and Type 3 the rarest 
form, accounts for 1-3% of cases. The main VWD classifications and subtypes can be described as 
follows: 
Type 1: A quantitative defect, in which there are proportional reductions in the levels of the VWF Antigen 
(VWF:Ag) and VWF function as measured by VWF Ristocetin Cofactor activity (VWF:RCo) or Collagen 
Binding capacity (VWF:CB); reduced level of factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C). Type I VWD is an 
autosomal dominant disorder.  
Type 2A: Qualitatively defective VWF in which the levels of VWF:RCo and VWF:CB are low compared to 
the levels of VWF:Ag and characterized by absence of HMW multimers; reduced or normal level of 
FVIII:C. Type 2A VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder. 
Type 2B: Qualitatively defective VWF in which the levels of VWF:RCo and VWF:CB are low compared to 
the levels of VWF:Ag; increased affinity to platelet glycoprotein Ibα results in loss of HMW multimers and 
thrombocytopenia; reduced or normal level of FVIII:C. Type 2B VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder.  
Type 2M: Qualitatively defective VWF in which the levels of VWF:RCo and VWF:CB are low compared to 
the levels of VWF:Ag; no loss of HMW multimers, reduced or normal level of FVIII:C. Type 2M VWD is an 
autosomal dominant disorder.  
Type 2N: Qualitatively defective VWF in which there is a decreased affinity (abnormal binding) to FVIII; 
reduced level of FVIII:C. Type 2N VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder. 
Type 3: Severe deficiency of VWF characterised by VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and FVIII:C levels typically <5% 
(or virtually immeasurable). Type 3 VWD is an autosomal dominant disorder. 
In general, patients with Type 1 VWD and sometimes those with Type 2 N VWD may be treated 
satisfactorily with DDAVP, which releases endogenous VWF from endothelial cells, but for the other types 
of VWD use of a VWF/FVIII concentrate is necessary in order to achieve hemostasis during bleeds or 
surgery. Fibrinolytic inhibitors such as tranexamic acid are frequently also used during bleeds and 
surgery. 
Hemophilia A 
Patients with hemophilia A have a hereditary deficiency of blood clotting FVIII, caused by mutations in the 
gene for FVIII. Inheritance of the defective gene on the X chromosome leads to hemophilia A in males 
and to carrier status in females.  
Hemophilia A is classified as severe, moderate, or mild depending on the plasma concentration of FVIII. 
Severe hemophilia A is defined as having plasma FVIII:C level of < 1%, and moderate as having plasma 
FVIII:C level of > 1% to 5%. Depending on the severity of the disease haemophilia A can lead to a 
tendency to excessive haemorrhage. 
Replacement therapies for FVIII deficiency consist of either plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII 
concentrates. So far, the main advantage of recombinant products is the higher viral safety. The major 
complication in the treatment of haemophilia A is the occurrence of inhibitors against FVIII (neutralising 
antibodies) in about 30% of patients, usually within the first 100 exposure days. Patients with severe 
haemophilia A are at a far higher risk to develop an inhibitor. 
Treatment of VWD and haemophilia A should be supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment 
of haemostatic disorders. The decision on the use of home treatment for an individual patient should be 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 6/91 
 
  
  
made by the treating physician who should ensure that appropriate training is provided and the use is 
reviewed at intervals. 
The ratio between FVIII:C and VWF:RCo in a vial is approximately 1:2.4. 
Details about the posology in the different conditions are provided in the SmPC. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Voncento is presented as a sterile, freeze-dried preparation of a human plasma protein fraction that 
contains the glycoprotein FVIII co-purified with VWF.  
FVIII and VWF are two distinct plasma glycoproteins found associated as a non-covalent complex in 
plasma. Plasma FVIII has a molecular weight of 330 kDa consisting of a 80 kDa light chain and a 90-250 
kDa heavy chain. VWF is a multimeric protein composed of covalently-linked dimeric subunits of about 
500 kDa. Each dimer consists of two identical protein chains of about 255 kDa each, also covalently 
linked. In normal human plasma, the levels of FVIII and VWF are about 0.2 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL, 
respectively, or 1 IU/mL for each of the components. This results in a molar FVIII/VWF ratio of about 1:50 
(0.7 nM/35 nM) based on monomer units. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Manufacturing Process 
The Drug Substance (S400 Bulk) is defined as Human Coagulation Factor FVIII/VWF Complex, purified 
and stabilised with albumin. The starting material for manufacturing human FVIII/VWF complex, human 
plasma, complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph 0853: “Human Plasma for Fractionation” and is described 
in the CSL Behring Plasma Master File (EMEA/H/PMF/000001/04). The first step in the commercial 
manufacturing process, processing frozen plasma to cryoprecipitate is performed at CSL Behring’s 
manufacturing site in Bern, Switzerland. All subsequent steps are performed at CSL Biotherapies’ 
manufacturing facility in Broadmeadows, Australia.  
The drug substance manufacturing process has sufficiently been described and a flow chart has been 
provided. Voncento is purified from human plasma. Briefly, to process the plasma to cryoprecipitate 
frozen plasma is thawed with stirring. The cryoprecipitate is isolated by centrifugation and then frozen. 
Frozen cryoprecipitate is thawed and a precipitation step is conducted to remove unwanted proteins. The 
precipitate is discarded. The FVIII supernatant undergoes a second precipitation step and the precipitate 
is reconstituted and then treated with solvent/detergent to inactivate enveloped viruses. The solvent 
detergent reagents are removed by passing the mixture through a size exclusion chromatography 
column. The eluate of this column is concentrated and formulated with albumin. 
Process parameters and in process controls  
With respect to the in process controls, the applicant had initially performed a risk assessment using 
own/non-standard definitions of process parameters and quality attributes.  These definitions were used 
in further defining whether these parameters or attributes were critical or non-critical. Many obviously 
critical parameters were risk assessed as being non-critical. This issue was raised as a major objection. 
Following the request, the applicant repeated the risk assessment using ICH definitions for Critical Quality 
Attributes (CQAs) and Critical Process Parameters (CPPs), supplemented with own definitions to further 
divide non-critical quality attributes and process parameters in Key (KQAs and KPPs, affecting process 
performance or consistency) or Other/General (GQAs, OPPs) variables. Criticality of the quality attributes 
was assessed by judging whether the attribute affected safety, quality or efficacy (CQA). To evaluate 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 7/91 
 
  
  
criticality of process parameters (PPs), it was determined whether the parameter affected product safety 
(CPP) or the product’s quality attributes.This approach is acceptable. On request some adjustments were 
made to the criticality assessment of bioburden throughout the manufacturing process. The actions taken 
if limits (alert limits/action limits for critical and non-critical quality attributes; and for critical and 
non-critical PPs) are exceeded have been described.  
Manufacturing process validation 
The manufacturing process of cryoprecipitate was validated retrospectively for 30 consecutive 
manufacturing batches. Acceptance criteria were met. Also all acceptance criteria for the validation of the 
processing of manufacturing scale cryoprecipitate to Drug Substance were met. The provided data show 
that the process is able to produce a consistent product which meets its specifications. The equipment 
used to thaw the intermediates cryoprecipitate and Factor VIII precipitate has been qualified and 
validated. Further evaluation of the validation batches was performed to assess product impurities and 
contaminants (fibrinogen, fibronectin, FII), physicochemical properties (VWF multimeric analysis, FVIII 
immunoblotting, size exclusion HPLC and SDS page) and yield.  
 Manufacturing process development 
Non-clinical and clinical studies performed for registration in Europe started in 2009. The main changes in 
the manufacturing process introduced since 2009 give no reason for concern and are covered by the 
validation studies. An important change introduced since 2009 concerns the addition of strengths 500 and 
1000 IU FVIII/vial (100 IU/mL), by doubling the FVIII and VWF concentration without changes to 
excipient levels.  
Voncento is manufactured from USA plasma, processed to cryoprecipitate at CSL Behring’s Bern facility 
(product used in the pivotal clinical studies). Human Coagulation FVIII/VWF product supplied to Australia 
and New Zealand (and other countries within Asia) is manufactured from country specific plasma, 
processed to cryoprecipitate at CSL Behring’s Broadmeadows facility (product used in supportive clinical 
trial). A combined quality-clinical major objection was raised as product characteristics (i.e. ratio 
VWF:RCo: FVIII, specific activity of VWF:RCo and VWF multimer distribution) changed during product 
development. It was unclear whether the commercial product is comparable to the product used in clinical 
trials. In response the applicant provided further data related to the introduction of two filtration steps to 
enhance the prion reduction capacity in 2007 and a comparison of the different source of cryoprecipitate. 
Based on the provided information, the product before and after implementation of the prion filtration 
step is considered comparable. The comparison of the different cryoprecipitate sources shows a difference 
in VWF:FVIII ratio that is maintained throughout the manufacturing process.  
The difference is explained by differences in the cryoprecipitation process. From a quality point of view the 
drug products manufactured from Bern cryoprecipitate and Broadmeadows cryoprecipitate are therefore 
not fully comparable. However, this difference is not expected to influence clinical efficacy or safety. It is 
noted that the commercial product will only be manufactured from Bern cryoprecipitate.  
Impurities 
The presence of a number of protein impurities (fibrinogen, fibronectin, FII, immunoglobulins, anti-A and 
anti-B haemagglutinins) and non-protein impurities (process impurities) was studied at Drug Substance 
or Drug Product level and is sufficiently controlled. Specifications are set for fibrinogen content (Drug 
Substance), anti-A and anti-B haem-agglutinins, process impurities (all Drug Product). Potential 
contamination during processing is controlled by bio-burden measurements during the production 
process and virus validation studies. 
Control of Drug Substance 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 8/91 
 
  
  
An overview of the Drug Substance specifications has been provided. The specifications for the Drug 
Substance have been derived from the requirements set out in ICH Topic Q6B. This is acceptable. Batch 
analysis data and an adequate overview of the analytical methods used for testing the Drug Substance 
are provided. 
Container Closure System 
The container closure system for the active substance has been sufficiently described. Sterilised (gamma 
radiation) storage bags are used as primary packaging for the Drug Substance. Compatibility with the 
Drug Substance is demonstrated by stability studies and further supported by studies which were 
conducted to measure extractables and leachables following storage of the Drug Substance. The provided 
information did not give reason for concern.  
Stability 
Storage of the Drug Substance for the proposed shelf life and storage conditions (52 weeks at  
-70°C protected from light) has been appropriately validated. Stability of the cryoprecipitate under stress 
conditions (e.g. higher temperatures, exposure to light) has not been addressed. Upon request, this was 
justified by the review actions (safety, quality, identity, potency) that are taken if cryoprecipitate storage 
temperature conditions are breached. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Manufacturing Process 
The drug product manufacturing process consists of dilution of Drug Substance with a formulation buffer 
containing constituents already present in the Drug Substance, sterile filtration, filling into vials, freeze 
drying and heat treatment for viral inactivation. The drug product manufacturing process is in general 
deemed sufficiently described and validated; on request, several issues were resolved, e.g. the critical 
parameters/steps of the freeze drying were better laid down in the dossier. The applicant will apply the 
bioburden limit of 10 cfu/100 mL before sterile filtration instead of the proposed 1 cfu/mL. However, given 
the relatively small Drug Product batch size, a sample size of 10 mL will be used. This can be accepted. It 
is recommended that the applicant appropriately validates the testing method prior to implementation.  
Process validation 
The validation data include a number of specific studies, and the manufacture of 3 or 4 validation batches 
of each presentation. The validation covers the complete manufacturing process (Drug Substance and 
Drug Product) and shows that the process is able to produce a consistent product which meets its 
specifications. On request,  compliance with validation requirements described in Ph. Eur. <2298> (vWF) 
was demonstrated. The specific validation studies gave no reason for concern.  
An overview and discussion was provided of the changes made to the manufacturing process during 
development. This information showed that the commercial product is comparable to the product used in 
the pivotal clinical trials CSLCT-BIO-07-47 and CSLCT-BIO-08-54.  
Control of excipients 
The excipients present in the drug product are specified as Ph. Eur. and tested in accordance with the 
methods and requirements of the relevant Ph. Eur. monographs.  
Human albumin 25% w/v is added in the drug substance manufacturing process to stabilise the drug 
substance. This excipient is itself a finished product, manufactured at CSL Behring in Bern, Switzerland 
and complying with the Ph. Eur. monograph for “Human albumin solution”. Human Albumin 25% (Alburex 
25 is the brand name) is currently registered in Switzerland and within the MRP in Denmark and Italy. It 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 9/91 
 
  
  
is manufactured from the same starting material as Human Coagulation FVIII/VWF Complex, covered by 
the CSL Behring Plasma Master File (EMEA/H/PMF/000001/04). 
Human Albumin 25% is within its shelf life when used in the manufacture of Voncento. The applicant has 
sufficiently justified that synchronisation of the shelf life of albumin and Voncento is technically not 
feasible.  
Control of Drug Product 
An overview of the Drug Product specification and analytical test methods has been provided. A global 
justification for the choice of tests has been provided, and specification limits have been sufficiently 
justified with data: an overview of historical data and complete data for batches used in clinical studies. 
Some limits were tightened upon request. The applicant has provided sufficient justification that the 
product complies with the potency requirements of the Ph. Eur. monograph of FVIII <0275> only (FVIII 
estimated potency 80-120% of stated potency; VWF estimated potency 60-140% of stated potency). The 
request to adjust the 60-140% potency requirement for vWF potency to 80-120% in order to comply with 
the Ph. Eur. monograph of vWF was therefore not maintained. Upon request, the applicant re-assessed 
the lower release limits for vWF and concluded that the limits should be maintained. Based on the 
provided information it could not be determined whether this proposal is valid. However, stability data 
show only limited decrease of VWF:RCo potency over time suggesting that the current release limit may 
sufficiently ensure that batches will meet the Ph. Eur. potency requirement during the entire shelf life. 
Also, it is noted that the company has previously agreed to monitoring the stability batches for VWF: RCo 
results that fall between the 60-80% lower limit and reviewing the lower limit for VWF when sufficient 
batches and data points are available. It was therefore considered not necessary to request additional 
information.  
A number of method descriptions were initially deemed too concise and upon request the Applicant 
submitted improved descriptions. In addition, additional validation data (especially addressing 
robustness) were submitted. In general, the description and validation of the analytical methods is 
deemed sufficient, however, a number of minor Outstanding Issues remained. These issues were 
appropriately addressed by the applicant. It is recommended to the applicant to implement and validate 
the Atomic Absorption Spectrometry method to determine sodium levels in Voncento. In addition, it is 
recommended that CSL Broadmeadows and Marburg participate in formal inter-laboratory proficiency 
studies for standardisation of FVIII potency assay. 
The requested information on the International reference standards used was provided and deemed 
satisfactory. The protocols (including acceptance criteria) used to calibrate in-house standards have been 
submitted and laid down in the dossier.  
Container Closure System 
The drug product is supplied in a 24 mL capacity glass vial (Type I, Ph. Eur. 3.2.1) closed with a latex-free 
butyl rubber stopper (Type I, Ph. Eur. 3.2.9) and sealed with an aluminium seal incorporating a red plastic 
flip-top cap. The container closure system is sufficiently described and deemed acceptable. The product is 
packaged with a vial of sterile WFI and an administration kit containing a reconstitution device 
(‘Mix2Vial’). 
Stability 
Based on the results of the stability studies, the proposed shelf life (24 months (104 weeks) stored at or 
below 25°C ± 2°C, protected from light) is approvable for the Drug Product.  
The applicant was requested to further substantiate this proposal with data from additional 
physico-chemical analysis. In response, extensive potency data and associated statistical analysis were 
provided. In addition, SEC-HPLC and vWF multimer analysis was performed on batches after storage of > 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 10/91 
 
  
  
2 years at 2-8°C or 25°C. No differences were observed between the storage conditions. Although the 
ability of these assays to identify any differences may be limited, currently there are no other analytical 
methods available to obtain further information on stability of the product. As potency data have 
historically been considered acceptable as main stability indicating parameter, and some supportive 
SEC-HPLC and multimer data are available, the proposed shelf life can be accepted. With respect to in-use 
stability, a satisfactory stability study was submitted to support the proposed in-use stability period (8h).  
Adventitious safety evaluation 
Overall, the applicant has sufficiently evaluated the adventitious agents’ safety. The solvent detergent 
mixing validation did not include the mixing of the detergent. Upon request, it was clarified that 
homogeneity of the SD solution prior to the start of the incubation cycle was validated. Measures taken to 
reduce the risk of virus contamination of Voncento include donor selection criteria, testing of donations 
and plasma pools, and two dedicated virus reduction steps in the manufacturing process (SD treatment 
and Dry Heat treatment of the freeze-dried product). Adequate virus validation studies have been 
performed to evaluate selected manufacturing steps for their capacity to remove or inactivate various 
viruses. Measures taken to reduce the risk of prion contamination include donor selection criteria, and two 
filtration steps in the manufacturing process. Investigational studies showed acceptable mean prion 
reduction factors over the manufacturing process of 4.0 log10 and 4.9 log10. Acceptable virus and prion 
safety of the excipient albumin has also been demonstrated.   
With respect to virus safety, the applicant concluded that the measures taken are considered effective for 
enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV and for the non-enveloped virus HAV; the measures taken 
may be of limited value for the non-enveloped virus B19V. This conclusion can be endorsed.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In general, the product Voncento is of acceptable quality. Its manufacture and control comply with 
current requirements and guidance. The information provided in the application demonstrates consistent 
batch-to-batch production of Voncento achieving a well-defined quality for the drug substance and the 
drug product. The quality of the drug substance and drug product is controlled by adequate test methods 
and specifications. Safety with regard to transmissible agents, such as human TSE and enveloped and 
non-enveloped viruses has been demonstrated in compliance with the relevant CHMP guidelines. 
All outstanding Quality issues have been solved with a number of recommendations. The quality related 
issues in the SmPC have been solved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
From a quality perspective the application for Voncento is approvable.  A number of recommendations are 
noted. The Quality related sections of the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
It is recommended that: 
1.  The applicant monitors the stability batches for VWF:RCo results that fall between the 60-80%

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Conventional non-clinical testing has not been undertaken during development of Human Coagulation 
Factor VIII/VWF Complex. Studies in safety pharmacology, local tolerance and single dose toxicity have 
been submitted.  The pharmacological studies were performed in anaesthetised, spontaneously respiring, 
male Beagle dogs. 
GLP aspects 
Safety pharmacology (study no. ZNA32393.001), local tolerance (study no. C67987) and single dose 
toxicity (study no. C67976) studies were Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) compliant.   
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
No primary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In-vivo safety pharmacology studies 
The Applicant has submitted an IV safety pharmacology assessment of Voncento on haemodynamic and 
electrophysiological, cardiovascular (e.g. blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular pressure, ECG) as 
well as respiratory (e.g. respiratory rate, tidal/minute volume, oxygen saturation rate) parameters in 
anaesthetised, spontaneously respiring, male Beagle dogs (study no. ZNA32393, GLP).  There were 2 
treatment groups, each consisting of 4 dogs.  Animals received 0.51, 2.06, 5.14 and 12.9 ml/kg vehicle 
(0.9% saline) or 50, 200, 500 and 1250 IU/kg Voncento as 4 intravenous infusions (total cumulative dose 
of 2000 IU/kg IV).  Each dose was administered over 30 min, using an infusion pump, and the dose 
volume for each treatment was 0.51, 2.06, 5.14 and 12.9 ml/kg, respectively.  The dose levels for this 
study were selected based on the therapeutic dose of 50 IU/kg, the highest recommended clinical human 
dose of 200 IU/kg, as well as 2 supra-therapeutic doses of 500 and 1250 IU/kg.  The total cumulative dose 
of 2000 IU/kg IV was designed to allow for a 10-fold clinical safety margin. 
The administration of 50, 200, 500 and 1250 IU/kg Voncento did not markedly affect haemodynamic and 
electrophysiological, cardiovascular or respiratory parameters.  The no observable adverse effects level 
(NOAEL) was considered to be a cumulative dose of 2000 IU/kg Voncento.

•  Study No. C67976: Single Dose Intravenous (Bolus) Toxicity Study in the Wistar Rat (GLP) 
The objective of the study was to assess acute toxicity following a single IV dose of Voncento injection into 
the tail vein to Wistar rats of both sexes at dose levels of 50, 200, 500 and 2000 IU FVIII per kg body 
weight.  A control group was treated similarly with 0.9% saline.  Each group consisted of 5 animals of each 
sex, including an additional 6 per sex (2 per sex for the control group) for plasma level 
determination/toxicokinetic evaluations.  Animals were examined for clinical signs of toxicity, food 
consumption and change in body weight.   
Analysis of hematology parameters six days following the treatment showed signs of a mild anaemia in 
males treated with 200, 500 or 2000 IU/kg, such as reduced numbers of erythrocytes and an increase in 
the numbers of early reticulocytes. Nonetheless, a clear dose-dependency was lacking. Also in females 
treated with the test item, slightly reduced erythrocyte numbers were noted, but a statistical significant 
effect was only seen in the group treated with 200 IU/kg. These effects might be related to the presence 
of a high protein load due to high concentrations of the test item. As no clinical signs of toxicity were noted 
during and after the treatment and all animals were in a good condition at the end of the 6-day

observation period, the small changes in haematology parameters were not considered of adverse 
nature. 
In males treated with 2000 IU/kg, the plasma concentration of potassium was slightly increased. As the 
treatment with the test item was generally well tolerated by these animals, this minor change is not 
considered adverse. No test item-related changes in urinary parameters were evident at the end of the 
observation period. 
Slightly increased spleen weights were noted in both sexes at all dose levels at the end of the observation 
period. However, the changes were only small, mostly without achieving statistical significance. As there 
was also no microscopic correlate for this finding it is considered not of adverse nature. 
Finally, there was no histological evidence of toxic effects in a variety of organs and tissues in animals 
treated once with the test item at 500 or 2000 IU/kg. At the injection site, no signs of local toxic effects 
of the test item were observed. 
In conclusion, based on the results of this study, no local or systemic adverse effects of Voncento were 
evident during a 6-day observation period after single intravenous injection of 50, 200, 500 or 2000 IU/kg 
into the tail vein of Wistar rats of both sexes. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
No repeat dose toxicity studies have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Genotoxicity 
No studies on the genotoxic potential of Human Coagulation Factor VIII/VWF Complex have been 
submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproduction toxicity studies have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Toxicokinetic data 
•  Single dose pharmacokinetic study of Voncento after intravenous administration to rats (Study no.: 
PSR 02/10) 
A toxicokinetic study in rats applying dosages between 50 and 2000 IU/kg was submitted. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of Voncento after intravenous administration of doses between 500 and 2000 
IU/kg demonstrated an increase in the plasma levels of coagulation factor VIII activity. At the highest 
dose of 2000 IU/kg body weight suitable activity levels were found, hence adequate exposure to Voncento 
could be demonstrated. 
Local Tolerance  
• 
Local tolerance study in rabbits 4 days after intravenous, peri-venous and intra-arterial injection 
(Study no. C67987, GLP) 
Local reaction after unintentional administration of Voncento through the peri-venous (PV) or 
intra-arterial (IA) route of administration was assessed in the New Zealand White rabbit and compared to 
Assessment report

the intended intravenous route of administration, with the drug product intended to be marketed.  A total 
of 9 rabbits were included in the study, 3 animals per route of administration (1 male and 2 female).  
Each rabbit was administered with either 0.5 ml Voncento (49 IU/animal, 16-24 IU/kg, PV route) or with 
1 ml (97 IU/animal, 32-48 IU/kg, IV and IA) injected into the right ear.  The left ear served as the control 
as it was injected with vehicle using the same volume injected for Voncento.  Clinical signs were recorded 
twice daily on test day 1, 2, 3 and 4.  There were no signs of toxicity or ill health in any treated animal 
during the observation period. There were slight observations of increased erythema in all the PV treated 
rabbits on days 3 and 4.  No changes were seen for IV or IA rabbits.  Macroscopically, there were no gross 
lesions.  In the microscopic findings noted after the three types of injection, there were no substantial 
differences between right ear (test item) and left ear (control item).  Changes seen in macropathological 
and histological findings were considered related to the different routes of administration rather than to 
be an effect caused by Voncento. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity 
•  Study No DRP029: Evaluation of Neoantigen Generation in Voncento using a Rabbit Immunogenicity 
Model (non-GLP) 
A study to detect possible differences in the immunological properties (formation of new epitopes) 
between AHF (High Purity, HP) and Voncento was performed in rabbits according to the method published 
by Ronneberger (1986). 
Groups of 5 adult New Zealand White rabbits (male and female) were immunised intravenously daily with 
1 IU Factor VIII of either AHF (High Purity) or Voncento on days 1-4 and 15-18.  Rabbits were bled via the 
marginal ear vein before the initial immunisation (pre-bleed) and also one week after the final 
immunisation.  The serum was then isolated and the immunoglobulin (Ig) fraction from rabbit sera was 
purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation.  Immunoglobulins from rabbits immunised with AHF (High 
Purity) and Voncento was analysed by double immunodiffusion (Ouchterlony) and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for reactivity with the respective immunogen and alternate antigen. 
Double immunodiffusion: All immune Ig fractions from rabbits immunised with Voncento demonstrated 
reactivity with both Voncento antigen and AHF (High Purity) antigen, and vice versa. Antibody reactivity 
of all immune Ig with the immunogen was completely removed by preincubation with the alternate 
antigen. 
Elisa: Reduction in reactivity of rabbit Ig to immobilised antigen was observed for all antigen-absorbed 
samples with the greatest reduction occurring with the highest amount of antigen used. Even at the 
lowest concentration of antigen significant reduction in antibody binding was observed compared to the 
non-absorbed positive control. In addition, identical reduction in reactivity of each Ig was seen after 
absorption with the immunogen and with the alternate antigen. 
The results of the rabbit immunogenicity model did not reveal any changes in the immunological 
characteristics of Voncento [as compared to AHF (HP)] suggesting that the manufacturing process did not 
induce the formation of new epitopes or make the product more immunogenic than AHF (HP). No 
antigenic differences were observed between the FVIII proteins in Voncento and AHF (HP). 
Impurities 
No studies on impurities have been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No studies on the primary and secondary pharmacodynamic effects of Human Coagulation Factor VIII/ 
VWF Complex have been submitted. The complex is an endogenous human compound with known 
pharmacological action, and the lack of studies is therefore acceptable. 
The newly conducted safety pharmacology, single dose toxicity and local tolerance studies were 
conducted in compliance with GLP. The additional toxicokinetics study was not GLP compliant. This is 
accepted due to the nature of the study. The neoantigen generation study was also not performed in 
compliance with GLP. However, the study was scientifically sound and adequate conclusions could be 
drawn. 
No treatment-related findings were observed in the safety pharmacology study on cardiovascular and 
respiratory parameters in beagle dogs.  
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed. Animal data are not needed because 
human plasma derived factor VIII/VWF factor concentrates have a well-established physiologic effect in 
humans. 
No non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies have been performed. These studies are not considered 
necessary due to the human origin of Human Coagulation Factor VIII/VWF Complex, the relatively long 
history of its clinical use, and the evaluation of the pharmacokinetic aspects of Human Coagulation Factor 
VIII/ VWF Complex in clinical trials.   
Voncento was well tolerated in male and female rats up to 2000 IU/kg.  Slight effects were seen in some 
parameters, including mild anaemia and increased reticulocytes, increased plasma potassium in males, 
and increased spleen weights. These effects can all be attributed to increased protein load, leading to 
nonspecific toxicity. No new or unexpected toxicity was observed.  
Voncento contains FVIII and VWF as active ingredients which are derived from human plasma and act like 
endogenous constituents of plasma. Non-clinical studies with repeated dose applications (chronic toxicity 
and carcinogenicity) cannot be reasonably performed in conventional animal models due to the 
development of antibodies following the application of heterologous human proteins (see SmPC section 
5.3). Moreover no studies on the genotoxic potential of Human Coagulation Factor VIII/VWF Complex can 
be performed as the constituents of Human Coagulation Factor VIII/VWF Complex are physiological 
human plasma proteins and potential genotoxicity is not expected.  This is in line with ICH S6 (R1) 
guideline for preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. 
No studies for reproductive and developmental toxicity have been submitted.  Adverse effects on fertility, 
postnatal development and reproduction as well as teratogenic effects are not expected in humans. 
Experience in the treatment of pregnant or lactating women is not available. Voncento should be 
administered to pregnant or lactating women only if benefit outweighs the risks (see SmPC section 4.6 
and Risk Management Plan) taking into consideration that delivery confers an increased risk of 
haemorrhagic events in these patients. 
A separate toxicokinetic experiment was performed. Adequate exposure to the complex was 
demonstrated in rats in line with the results from the single dose toxicity study. 
Local tolerance has been assessed in a dedicated local tolerance study in rabbits.  The Applicant has 
justified the use of rabbits for this study based on their sensitivity and widespread use to assess local 
tolerance. Voncento is considered to be well tolerated in rabbit at clinically relevant doses.

EMA/404213/2013

The Applicant has used a rabbit immunogenicity model to compare the immunogenic properties of AHF 
(High Purity) and Voncento and identify the possible formation of new epitopes in factor VIII molecules of 
Voncento generated during the manufacturing process.  There are no concerns that new epitopes are 
generated with the Voncento manufacturing process as compared to AHF (HP). Nevertheless, the issue of 
neoantigen formation and subsequent development of inhibitory antibodies in treated patients should be 
monitored carefully in the clinic (see Clinical aspects). 
The process reagents tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP) and polysorbate 80 (P80) (utilized as the 
solvent/detergent mixture in the first virus inactivation step) have been widely used for viral inactivation. 
Based on the maximum recommended dose of 200 IU/kg/day of Human Coagulation Factor VIII/VWF 
Complex a patient may receive up to 100 μg P80/kg/day for the 100 IU/ml strengths and 200 μg 
P80/kg/day for the 50 IU/ml strengths. The maximum level of P80 from Human Coagulation Factor 
VIII/VWF Complex is 0.4% of the dose that caused a transient drop in the blood pressure in cats, rabbits 
and monkeys (Moore J, 1984). Thus, total anticipated exposure to P80 from Human Coagulation Factor 
VIII/VWF Complex are well below the minimum dose that caused toxicity in animals. Based on the 
maximum recommended dose of Human Coagulation Factor VIII/VWF Complex a patient may receive up 
to 20 μg TNBP/kg/day for the 100 IU/ml strengths and 40 μg TNBP/kg/day for the 50 IU/ml strengths. 
These dose levels are well below the minimum dose that caused toxicity in animal studies. The maximum 
level of TNBP from Human Coagulation Factor VIII/VWF Complex is 0.1% of the LD50 in mice via the IV 
route. Daily administration of TNBP at concentrations 10 times higher than in Human Coagulation Factor 
VIII/VWF Complex have been shown to cause no pathology when administered IV to rabbits for 13 weeks 
(Vandekar M, 1957). In conclusion, no safety issues are expected due to these excipients. 
The applicant has not performed an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) in accordance with the 
“Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of the medicinal products for human use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) – as Voncento is a naturally derived substance and a protein, unlikely to 
result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Voncento contains FVIII and VWF as active ingredients which are derived from human plasma and act like 
endogenous constituents of plasma. Preclinical studies with repeated dose applications (chronic toxicity 
and carcinogenicity) cannot be reasonably performed in conventional animal models due to the 
development of antibodies following the application of heterologous human proteins. No studies on the 
genotoxic potential of Human Coagulation Factor VIII/VWF Complex were performed as the constituents 
of Human Coagulation Factor VIII/VWF Complex are physiological human plasma proteins and potential 
genotoxicity is not expected. 
This information is included under section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Voncento. Experience in the treatment of 
pregnant or lactating women is not available. Voncento should be administered to pregnant or lactating 
women only if clearly indicated (see SmPC section 4.6 and Risk Management Plan). 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The claimed indications for Voncento are for the prevention and treatment of haemorrhage or surgical 
bleeding in patients with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or 
contraindicated and for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A, in adults 
and adolescents from 12-18 years.

GCP  
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.  
A GCP inspection of two investigator sites of study SLCT–BIO -08-54 was requested and conducted. As a 
result of the identified GCP inspection findings, the applicant conducted a series of activities including 
independent site audits (incl. patient selection, dosing, source data verification), and database audits 
against source documentation, for a majority of trial sites. The documentation and responses provided by 
the Applicant after the inspection upon request by the Rapporteurs (including the results of internal audit 
and re-analysis) were considered satisfactory and the CHMP concluded that the findings identified did not 
have a significant  impact on key trial parameters such as diagnosis or efficacy and safety evaluations.  
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

•  Study BIO-07-47 (Hemophilia A) - Pharmacokinetic data 
The pivotal PK, safety, and efficacy study BIO-07-47 was conducted in Eastern Europe in 2009/2010 (see 
Main Studies for detailed description and efficacy results).  
Subjects who had been diagnosed with hemophilia A and had FVIII levels of ≤1% in the absence of factor 
replacement according to their medical history were included. Subjects who were actively bleeding, or 
had received an infusion of any FVIII product, whole blood, plasma or desmopressin acetate in the 4 days 
prior to day 1, or had a known history of FVIII inhibitors were excluded from PK part.  
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 18/91 
 
 
  
  
The study included a PK component with an initial PK assessment in a double-blind, crossover design to 
assess the bioequivalence between Voncento reference product (RP) and Voncento study product (SP), 
and a repeat PK assessment about 6 months after the initial assessment (Voncento SP). Voncento 
reference product (RP), was the initial product, used in clinical studies until May 2003, and Voncento 
study product (SP) was the product with an additional filter (a filtration step to enhance prion clearance), 
used as the IMP since March 2009 (start of the clinical development of the IMP in Europe). 
Voncento dose of 50 IU/kg was to be administered on Days 1 and 8. Repeat PK assessment included 15 
subjects who had initial PK assessment and consisted of a single dose of 50 IU/kg Voncento SP on Day 
180.  
Blood samples for the PK assessment for comparison of Voncento RP and Voncento SP were taken on 
Days 1 and 8, at pre-infusion and at 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 28, and 48 h after the end of the infusion of 
Voncento. FVIII plasma concentrations were determined by a central laboratory. 
Results 
A total of 81 subjects, including 3 adolescents (as required according to the approved PIP 
EMEA-000312-PIP01-08), were enrolled into the study; 17 adult subjects participated in the PK 
component (16 were evaluable for the initial PK assessment and 15 for the repeat PK assessment). All 
subjects of the PK population were male Caucasians and mean age was 36.5 years with a range of 18 to 
57 years. 
A comparison of FVIII pharmacokinetic parameters following the initial administration of Voncento SP in 
16 subjects with severe hemophilia A is shown in table 3.

1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) treatment had been ineffective, 
contraindicated, or not available (see Main Clinical Studies). Pharmacokinetics was studied after the first 
administration of Voncento 80 IU/kg in 15 subjects with VWD.  
Blood samples were collected to assess the PK for VWF:RCo, Von Willebrand factor: Antigen (VWF:Ag), 
Von Willebrand factor: Collagen Binding capacity (VWF:CB), and factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) 
following an initial single dose of 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo at pre-infusion, and at 15 min, 1, 3, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30, 
48 and 72 h post-infusion. The PK parameters calculated for VWF and FVIII included half-life, incremental 
recovery, AUC, Cmax, tmax, Cmin, Cl, Vss, and MRT. In addition, the PK samples obtained from the Type 3 
VWD subjects (prior to dosing, 15 min and 6 h after infusion) were used to investigate the multimer 
distribution of VWF. 
Repeat PK assessment occurred at least 6 months after the initial assessment (after at least 2 further 
doses of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and at least 5 days after the last Voncento SP dose) and 
was performed in the 8 subjects with Type 3 VWD who participated in the initial PK assessment. The 
Voncento SP dose, blood sampling time points, and PK parameters were the same as for the initial PK 
assessment.

The relative HMW VWF of Voncento compared to normal human plasma was on average 86%.  The 
relative expression of HMW VWF multimers in VWD patients after infusion of Voncento was approximately 
10% (using a semi-quantitative multimer analysis).

No studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic studies were not conducted for human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex since the 
pharmacodynamics of the FVIII/VWF complex in humans is well documented and its efficacy has been 
demonstrated.   
VWF and FVIII are 2 distinct glycoproteins that circulate in plasma in the form of a non-covalently bound 
complex. Both factors are essential for normal hemostasis in humans. A deficiency or abnormality in VWF 
can interfere with the formation of the temporary platelet plug (primary hemostasis) and also affect the 
normal survival of FVIII, which ultimately can interfere with the production of fibrin and stabilization of 
the clot (secondary hemostasis). Individuals with VWD, therefore, have difficulty in forming blood clots 
and as a result, may bleed for longer periods of time than normal. Bleeding can sometimes occur 
spontaneously. In hemophilia A, primary hemostasis is normal, but secondary hemostasis is impaired 
because the primary hemostatic plug is not stabilized due to the FVIII deficiency and re-bleeding occurs. 
VWF is a multimeric, adhesive, plasma glycoprotein that is synthesized in megakaryocytes and 
endothelial cells as a 260 kDa precursor. The precursor (ie, pro-VWF) forms intracellular dimers, which 
are in turn glycosylated and then further associated into multimers ranging from 500 to 20,000 kDa, 
before being released into the plasma as ultra-large VWF multimers. 
Exogenously administered human plasma-derived VWF behaves in the same way as endogenous VWF. 
Administration of VWF allows correction of the haemostatic abnormalities exhibited by patients who suffer 
from VWF deficiency (VWD) at two levels: 
- 
VWF re-establishes platelet adhesion to the vascular sub-endothelium at the site of vascular 
damage (as it binds both to the vascular sub-endothelium and to the platelet membrane), 
providing primary haemostasis as shown by the shortening of the bleeding time. This effect occurs 
immediately and is known to depend to a large extent on the level of polymerisation of the protein. 
- 
VWF produces delayed correction of the associated FVIII deficiency. Administered intravenously, 
VWF binds to endogenous FVIII (which is produced normally by the patient), and by stabilising this 
factor, avoids its rapid degradation. 
Because of this, administration of pure VWF (VWF product with a low FVIII level) restores the 
FVIII:C level to normal as a secondary effect after the first infusion with a slight delay. 
- 
Administration of a FVIII:C containing VWF preparation restores the FVIII:C level to normal 
immediately after the first infusion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 24/91 
 
  
  
In hemophilia A, exogenously administered human plasma-derived FVIII behaves in the same way as 
endogenous FVIII. The FVIII/VWF complex consists of two molecules (FVIII and VWF) with different 
physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, FVIII binds to VWF in the patient’s 
circulation. Activated FVIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX accelerating the conversion of factor 
X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts 
fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed.  
High molecular weight (HMW) multimers of VWF seem to be essential for its hemostatic function. In VWD 
type 3 subjects after administration of Voncento SP, VWF high molecular weight multimers were present 
as approximately 10% of total VWF multimers, which seemed low compared to normal plasma (~25% 
HMW). Nevertheless, based on the observed hemostasis in study BIO-08-54, the HMW VWF multimer 
expression appeared to be high enough to exert an adequate clinical effect. 
Repeat PK results as seen in pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-07-47 and supportive study CSLCT-BIO-95-41 
were comparable. Concordance between initial and repeat PK of mean incremental recovery (0.021 and 
0.022 kg/mL) and mean half-life (13.49 and 13.16 h) indicated that inhibitors had not developed with 
repeated exposure to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex during the conduct of study 
CSLCT-BIO-07-47. 
The overall PK data are considered to comply with the CHMP guidelines for both Factor VIII and VWF 
products.  In addition PK studies demonstrated comparability between Voncento SP and Voncento RP and 
results were comparable to literature reports. 
The PK of FVIII:C was rather different in VWD type 3 subjects compared to haemophilia A subjects. 
FVIII:C levels remained high longer in VWD subjects probably due to stabilisation of the endogenous 
produced FVIII by the added VWF complex as production of FVIII is not impaired in VWD. Such an effect 
on FVIII:C in VWD subjects is product specific. In VWD, usually 40-80 IU/kg of von Willebrand factor 
(VWF:RCo) and 20-40 IU/kg of FVIII:C are recommended to achieve haemostasis and the appropriate 
dose should be re-administered every 12-24 hours. At 12-24 hours FVIII:C concentrations are still at 
maximum levels, therefore, accumulation may occur after repeat dosing and may thus increase the risk 
of thromboembolic events.  
When using a FVIII-containing VWF product, the treating physician should be aware that continued 
treatment may cause an excessive rise in FVIII:C. In patients receiving FVIII-containing VWF products, 
plasma levels of FVIII:C should be monitored to avoid sustained excessive FVIII:C plasma levels which 
may increase the risk of thrombotic events, and antithrombotic measures should be considered (see 
SmPC section 4.3). 
A statement that especially FVIII:C levels should be closely monitored especially when high doses of 
Voncento (e.g. during surgery in case of Von Willebrand disease) are needed, is included in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC and the risk of thromboembolic complications is highlighted in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
No interactions of human von Willebrand factor and human coagulation factor VIII with other medicinal 
products have been reported (see SmPC section 4.5). 
No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients younger than 12 years (see SmPC section 5.2).

2.5.2.  Main studies 
•  Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (von Willebrand’s disease indication) 
Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 (NCT00941616) was an open-label, multi-centre study design to assess the 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of human coagulation factor VIII / von willebrand factor in subjects 
with Von Willebrand disease. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: 
•  Male and female subjects who were at least 12 years of age. 
•  Diagnosed with severe VWD where VWF:RCo was <15% at screening (after a minimum of 5 days 
since last VWF treatment) or the subject had a history of VWF:RCo <10% documented in their 
medical notes at enrolment. 
•  Where DDAVP treatment was ineffective, contraindicated, or not available. 
•  Required a VWF product for prophylactic therapy or to control a non-surgical bleed (NSB) event. 
Main exclusion criteria: 
For participants of the PK component: 
•  Were actively bleeding immediately prior to the initial PK period. 
•  Received DDAVP or a VWF product in the 5 days prior to their first dose of study product. 
•  Had Type 2B, 2N, or 2M VWD. 
For all subjects: 
•  Required a VWF product for a planned surgical procedure at enrolment i.e. a planned surgery should 
not have been the reason for inclusion into the study. 
•  Received aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 7 days prior to 
their first dose of study product. 
•  Known history of or were suspected to have VWF or FVIII inhibitors. 
•  Subjects with impaired liver function at screening, i.e. bilirubin >1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), 
and/or aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) >2.5 x ULN (referring to the 
limits of the laboratory that performed the determination). 
Treatments 
The study consisted of 3 periods (Figure 2): 
1. Screening period of up to 28 days. 
2. PK component of up to 183 days (PK subjects), which consisted of: 
A single dose of Voncento on Day 1; A repeat single dose of Voncento on Day 180, at least 6 months after 
the initial infusion (repeat PK for Type 3 VWD PK subjects only); PK samples were collected on Days 1, 2, 
3, and 4, and on Days 180, 181, 182, and 183; All PK subjects were to enter the efficacy component of the 
study at the completion of the initial PK period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 26/91 
 
 
 
  
  
3. Efficacy component (all subjects) of up to 12 or 24 months; depending on the treatment arm subjects 
participated in: 
Arm 1 (prophylaxis arm): Subjects  were to receive Voncento as prophylaxis therapy for 12 months.  
Subjects who were being treated on a set prophylaxis regimen with a VWF product at the time of study 
entry, or who were not on a set prophylaxis regimen but in whom prophylaxis treatment was justifiable in 
the opinion of the investigator, were enrolled into Arm 1 and received Voncento as part of a prophylaxis 
regimen as determined by the severity of their disease for a period of 12 months. Arm 1 subjects 
completed the study with a final visit at month 12. 
Arm 2 (on-demand arm): Subjects were to receive Voncento as on-demand therapy for 12 months. 
Subjects who were not on a set prophylaxis regimen with a VWF product at the time of study entry, and 
who required a VWF product for the treatment of NSB events (spontaneous or trauma-induced), were 
enrolled into Arm 2 and commenced using Voncento as on-demand therapy for the treatment of NSB 
events. At the Month 12 visit, Arm 2 an assessment was made, based on the extent and location of any 
bleeding events, for eligibility to be switched to a set prophylaxis regimen with Voncento for an additional 
12 months (Arm 3). Subjects who were not eligible to enter Arm 3 completed the study with the final visit 
at month 12. 
Arm 3: Subjects, who completed treatment (on-demand therapy with Voncento) in Arm 2 and who at the 
Month 12 visit qualified to be switched to a set prophylactic regimen according to the criteria prespecified 
in the study protocol, entered Arm 3 and started Voncento treatment as prophylaxis therapy for an 
additional 12 months. The prophylaxis regimen was determined by the extent and location of NSB events 
during the preceding 12-month on-demand therapy period. The total treatment duration for subjects in 
Arm 3 was up to 24 months.

In the PK component of the study, subjects received 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo based on the subject’s body 
weight.  
For each subject in the efficacy component of the study, the frequency and dose of Voncento was 
determined by the Investigator (Table 5).  The dose was based on the subject’s clinical condition, previous 
FVIII/vWF concentrate requirements, response to therapy, body weight, and reason for usage.

Objectives 
The primary objectives were to investigate the initial and repeat PK profile of Voncento in subjects with 
severe VWD, to assess the haemostatic efficacy of Voncento in subjects with VWD who require a VWF 
product to control an NSB event and to assess the effectiveness of a prophylaxis regimen as compared to 
on-demand therapy with Voncento in preventing NSB events. 
The secondary objectives included the assessment of the safety of Voncento used both as on-demand 
therapy to treat NSB events and as prophylactic therapy and the assessment of the haemostatic efficacy 
of Voncento for subjects who undergo surgical procedures during the study period.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
No particular efficacy variable was defined as primary for this study. 
Efficacy measurements 
The clinical efficacy parameters assessed in the study were haemostasis assessment (overall every 3 
months by the investigator and for each non-surgical bleed (NSB) and surgical event by the investigator 
and subject), study product usage, blood product transfusion requirements, and surgeon’s assessment of 
blood loss during a surgical procedure. 
The severity of NSB events was assessed by the investigator as major or minor. Major NSB events 
included any bleeding into a joint or muscle, or a mucosal bleeding of the gastro-intestinal tract 
(excluding nasal or oral bleeding). All other NSB events were classified as minor unless the investigator 
assessment noted otherwise.  
Haemostasis assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 29/91 
 
 
  
  
Overall clinical assessments of haemostatic efficacy for both prophylaxis and on demand treatment were 
based on a 4-point Efficacy Grading Scale (Table 6) by both the subject and the investigator throughout 
the efficacy component of the study. 
Table 6: Efficacy grading scales 
Sample size 
To complete the guideline requirements (November 2005 CHMP guideline, CPMP/BPWG/220/02) 12 
subjects with VWD to take part in a PK study, 6 of whom should have Type 3 VWD were required. In 
addition, data on at least 10 NSB events, of which 5 were to be major mucosal NSB events, were required. 
Subjects who required prophylaxis therapy with a VWF product were also required; 2-5 subjects fulfilling 
this requirement were planned to be enrolled. 
Hence, 25 subjects were expected to enrol into the efficacy component to ensure 
• 2-5 subjects receiving a set prophylaxis therapy with Voncento for a period of 12 months, and 
• a minimum of 10 evaluable NSB events, including at least 5 events classified as major mucosal NSB 
events. An evaluable NSB event was an event that required treatment with Voncento and had undergone 
at least 1 haemostatic efficacy assessment by the investigator. 
This estimate of 25 subjects included 16 VWD subjects to be enrolled in the PK component (10 of these 
diagnosed with Type 3 VWD) to ensure ≥12 evaluable subjects who complete the initial PK sampling and 
6 subjects with Type 3 VWD who complete the initial and repeat PK sampling. 
Randomisation

Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
An interim analysis was performed after the completion of Part 1 with a PK Study Report being prepared 
and released based on the analysis of the data from this component of the study. No formal statistical 
tests were performed. 
Two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for PK analyses only. All analyses were 
considered exploratory, and thus no adjustments for multiplicity were applied. 
In general descriptive statistics were used to summarise efficacy data by treatment arm and overall.  
Missing data were not replaced and therefore summaries were based on the observed data.

The statistical analysis was based on the following analysis populations: 
• Safety population: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study product. 
• PK population: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study product and had at least 5 analyzable 
samples (including the pre-infusion sample) to evaluate the PK profile of Voncento. 
• Efficacy population: all subjects who participated in the efficacy component of the study (either for set 
prophylaxis or have experienced at least 1 NSB event) and who received at least 1 dose of study product 
and who have at least 1 post-baseline haemostasis assessment by an investigator. 
• PP population: all subjects of the efficacy population who completed the study without any major 
protocol deviations and who attended all required study visits.

Recruitment 
A total of 22 subjects received study drug in 6 centres in Brazil, Bulgaria, Poland (2), Russia and Ukraine. 
The first subject was enrolled on 30 June 2009 and the last subject completed their 12 month visit on 6 
March 2011.  
Arm 3 which includes 8 subjects on regular long term prophylaxis was still ongoing at the time of the 
submission.  
Conduct of the study 
Three substantial amendments and 1 non-substantial amendment were issued after the study protocol 
had been finalised on 10 October 2008. Main changes from these amendments are outlined below: 
Substantial amendment 1 was issued on 15 December 2008, before the enrolment of any subjects, and 
included the following main changes; All subjects had their VWD phenotype confirmed at the screening 
visit; the duration of the screening period was increased to up to 21 days to allow sufficient processing 
time for the phenotype assessment; reduced blood volumes for adolescents were inserted; introduction 
of a Data Safety Monitoring Board. 
Substantial amendment 2 was issued on 23 April 2009, before the enrolment of any subjects, and 
included the following main changes: reduction in the volume of blood taken for both adults and 
adolescents (the same volumes required for adults and adolescents); removal of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus testing at screening; modification of the requirements for Hepatitis C testing at 
screening; the duration of the screening period was increased to up to 28 days to allow sufficient 
processing time for the phenotype assessment; confirmation that a urine pregnancy test rather than a 
serum pregnancy test was to be performed in females of childbearing potential at screening; bicarbonate

testing was deleted from Biochemistry determinations; clarification regarding Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B 
eligibility testing at screening and pre-dose vaccination requirements. 
Substantial amendment 3 was issued on 15 December 2009. At that time, 13 subjects had already been 
enrolled into the study. The further conduct of the study for already enrolled subjects was not affected by 
this amendment. The following main changes were included: adjustment of wash-out period prior to the 
screening visit; adjustment of safety assessments with regard to suspected inhibitor formation. 
Non-substantial amendment 4 was issued on 29 July 2010. At that time, 21 subjects had already been 
enrolled into the study; however, the further conduct of the study was not affected by this amendment. 
The following main changes were included: subjects were allowed to start with prophylaxis treatment 
regardless of the previous regimen; criteria for the interim analysis were adapted. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics and baseline disease characteristics are summarised in tables 7 and 8 
respectively.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 22 subjects, including 3 adolescents, were treated in the study and thus comprise the safety 
population. 
Twenty-one subjects were not eligible for the prophylaxis arm (Arm 1, n=1) but required a VWF product 
for the treatment of NSB events and thus comprise the on-demand arm (Arm 2) of this study. One subject 
in Arm 2 did not have an evaluable NSB event and was therefore excluded from the efficacy population.  
One further subject was excluded from the PP population (n=20) due to a major protocol violation. 
Efficacy results in the PP population were similar to those in the efficacy population and unless stated 
otherwise are not specifically mentioned in the following section.  
Since there was only 1 subject in Arm 1, the prophylaxis arm, efficacy results are summarised in the 
following tables for both treatment arms combined, ie, for the overall efficacy population (N=21).  Thus 
the total number of patients evaluated for efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events was 21.  
•  Outcomes and estimation 
3-monthly assessment of haemostatic efficacy  
The investigator’s 3-monthly assessment of haemostatic efficacy is summarised in Table 9.  
For each 3-month interval the subject’s haemostatic efficacy was assessed as either excellent or good, 
with 1 exception each at Month 6 and Month 12, where 1 subject’s haemostatic efficacy was assessed as 
moderate. These 2 assessments of moderate haemostatic efficacy were both related to the subject in the 
prophylaxis arm; the only other available haemostatic efficacy assessment for this subject was 
“excellent” at Month 9. The subject had 2 NSB events each during the first, second, and fourth 3-month

period; however, as the subject did not alter the prophylactic treatment scheme, none of these events 
were treated with Voncento. These NSB events were not assessed for haemostatic efficacy. 
Table 9: Investigator’s 3-monthly haemostatic efficacy assessment (efficacy population) 
Non-surgical bleeding events 
A total of 538 NSB events were reported during the study. The median number of NSB events per subject 
was 19 and ranged from 2 to 82; 534 (99.3%) of NSB events were spontaneous, 527 (98.0%) were 
minor, 422 (78.4%) were mucosal, and 380 (70.6%) were treated at home.  
Seven subjects had a total of 132 NSB events that did not require treatment with Voncento and which 
were therefore considered not evaluable and consequently not assessed for haemostatic efficacy.  
In addition to the above mentioned 132 non-treated NSB events, 1 minor mucosal NSB event experienced 
at home by one subject and for which 2 Voncento infusions were administered was also not assessed by 
the investigator for haemostatic efficacy. 
Of the 538 reported NSB events, haemostatic efficacy was assessed for 405 events treated with Voncento 
(Table 10), which all occurred in the on-demand arm (Arm 2). Subject’s assessment of haemostatic 
efficacy per day of bleeding event is shown in table 11.

Major non-surgical bleeding events 
In the efficacy population, 5 subjects had 11 NSB events that were considered as major by the 
Investigator. All events were spontaneous and mucosal with the exception of 1 trauma bleeding that 
affected the muscle. None of the 3 major NSB events of one subject (Arm 1) were treated on-demand with 
Voncento; these events were therefore not evaluated for haemostatic efficacy. 
The overall haemostatic efficacy for the 8 evaluable major NSB events was assessed by the Investigator 
as excellent in 2 cases and as moderate in the remaining 6 cases. These 6 events were all major 
mucosal/uterine NSB events experienced by 2 subjects; for 4 of these events, the investigator assessed 
the haemostatic efficacy as good on at least 1 bleeding day. The duration of the major NSB events varied 
from 8.2 h to more than 12 days. One subject who had 3 major NSB events was excluded from the PP 
population due to a time window violation. 
Surgical events 
Four subjects, including 2 adolescent subjects underwent 1 surgery each during the study prior to the 
date of database lock. All 4 surgical events were minor and included 3 cases of tooth extraction and a 
biopsy of the cervix. The investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy at discharge from the hospital 
was available for 3 surgical events and was assessed as excellent for 2 surgical events and as good for 1 
event. For the event with missing haemostatic efficacy assessment at discharge, the Investigator rated 
the post-surgery haemostatic efficacy as excellent. 
Usage of the study product 
Subjects in the on-demand arm (Arm 2) had a median number of 19.5 infusions (range: 3-92) at a 
median Voncento dose of 39.0 VWF:RCo IU/kg (range: 15-53 IU/kg). Results were similar when only 
considering infusions given for a NSB event. The one subject included in the prophylaxis arm (Arm 1) of 
the study had 142 infusions with 20.0 VWF:RCo IU/kg Voncento per infusion administered every 2-3 
days. The vast majority of NSB events required 1 single infusion of Voncento; 8 subjects experienced a 
total of 25 NSB events that required more than 1 infusion of Voncento. 
Blood loss during surgical events 
The blood loss during the 4 surgical events in the efficacy population was assessed by the investigator or 
surgeon as less than expected (in a subject without a bleeding disorder) for 1 surgical event and 
equivalent to the expected loss for 3 surgical events. 
Blood product transfusions 
One subject in the efficacy population required blood product transfusion: 600 mL of packed RBCs each 
for 2 cases of major uterine bleeding that occurred about 2 months apart. About 1 month after the second 
of these events, the subject experienced a third major uterine NSB event that did not require any blood 
product transfusion.

Ancillary analyses 
The efficacy data of the 3 adolescent subjects (2 aged 15 and one 16 years) have been submitted by the 
applicant. All were on-demand treatment. The 3 adolescent subjects in the study received 12 infusions of 
Voncento with an average dose of 32.9 IU/kg, 21 infusions with an average of 41.8 IU/kg, and 4 infusions 
with an average dose of 27.3 IU/kg. 2 Adolescents required minor surgery during the course of the study. 
Haemostatic efficacy was assessed as either good or excellent for all NSB and surgical events for which 
Voncento was administered.

Treatments 
The study consisted of 4 periods: 
•  Screening period of up to 14 days. 
• 
• 
• 
Part  1  of  the  study  was  a  Phase  II,  multicentre,  double-blind,  randomised,  cross-over  study  to 
evaluate the PK and safety of Voncento SP compared to Voncento RP.  
Part 2  of up to 6 months of Voncento SP therapy as required, for a minimum of 50 exposure days 
(efficacy component, all subjects). If the 50 exposure days did not occur in the predicted 6-month 
period,  the  subject  was  allowed  to  continue  in  the  study  until  he  required  the  administration  of 
Voncento on at least 50 separate occasions/events. 
Part 3 of up to 8 days (repeat PK assessment of the PK component, PK subjects only) consisted of a 
single dose of Voncento SP on Day 180 with PK  samples collected on Days 180, 181, and 182. A 
minimum of 4 days was required from the last dose of Voncento SP prior to receiving the single dose 
of Voncento SP for the purpose of Part 3 PK assessment. 
A final follow-up safety visit occurred on Day 187, which also constituted the final visit, if the subject had 
a minimum of 50 exposure days. Otherwise the final visit was to occur within 7 days after the last dose of 
Voncento SP. The individual duration for the total study was at least 32 weeks for subjects participating 
in the PK and efficacy components and at least 29 weeks for subjects participating in the efficacy 
component only. 
In the PK component of the study subjects received 50 IU/kg FVIII of Voncento RP or Voncento SP based 
on the subject’s body weight. 
For each subject in the efficacy component (Part 2) of the study, the frequency and dose (loading and 
maintenance) of Voncento SP was determined by the Investigator.  The dose was based on the subject’s 
clinical condition, previous FVIII concentrate requirements, response to therapy, body weight, and reason 
for usage (on-demand treatment for a haemorrhage or surgery or as prophylaxis) during the 6-month 
efficacy period (for a minimum of 50 exposure days). 
Prophylaxis was intended for subjects who had been on a set prophylaxis regimen with a FVIII product at 
the time of study entry or for subjects who were eligible to receive prophylaxis treatment based on the 
severity of their disease. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study were the assessment of the efficacy of Voncento SP in subjects with 
haemophilia A and the assessment of the comparability of the PK of Voncento RP and Voncento SP in 
subjects with haemophilia A. 
The secondary objective was to assess the safety of Voncento SP in subjects with haemophilia A. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The clinical efficacy parameters assessed in the study were study product usage, haemostasis 
assessment (by the subject and Investigator), blood product transfusion requirements, and surgeon’s 
assessment of blood loss during a surgical procedure. 
Study product usage 
The following information was collected on the administration of both Voncento RP and SP, for each dose 
that the subject received: reason for use; dose of Voncento (FVIII:C [IU/kg]); total number of vials used; 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 38/91 
 
  
  
batch number(s) of each vial; infusion start and stop times; total volume infused; number of infusions per 
day (frequency); total days of treatment required. 
Haemostasis assessment 
Overall clinical assessments of haemostatic efficacy were based on the 4-point Efficacy Grading Scale 
(presented in main study of VWD indication) by both the subject and the Investigator throughout the 
efficacy (Part 2) component of the study. 
Blood product transfusion requirements 
The type of blood product, and the number of units required by a subject during the study period 
(screening to final visit) were recorded. This included any infusions of whole blood, packed RBCs, and 
platelets. 
Assessment of blood loss during surgery 
In the case of any surgical procedures, the surgical team provided an assessment at the time of the 
procedure of the extent of blood loss for each specific surgical procedure performed on a subject. The 
blood loss was compared to the expected blood loss from a subject without a bleeding disorder 
undergoing the same procedure and judged to be “less”, “equivalent”, or “more”. 
Sample size  
The number of subjects is based on the requirements for bioequivalence studies in conjunction with the 
draft CPMP Note for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma-Derived Factor VIII and 
Factor IX Products (July 2007).  
It was anticipated that approximately 80 adults and adolescents (≥12 years) who have been diagnosed 
with haemophilia A with FVIII levels ≤1% would be recruited into this study to obtain PK data on a 
minimum of 12 subjects, and efficacy and safety data on a minimum of 65 subjects. 
Randomisation 
During Part 1 of the study subjects were randomised on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive: 
• Voncento RP on Day 1 and Voncento SP on Day 8, or 
• Voncento SP on Day 1 and Voncento RP on Day 8. 
Blinding (masking)  
Blinding was only applicable for Part 1 of the study. 
Statistical methods 
The following populations were defined for the analysis: 
• 
• 
Efficacy population: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of Voncento SP during the efficacy 
component  (Part  2)  and  had  at  least  1  post-baseline  haemostasis  assessment  by  the 
Investigator; 
Per-protocol  (PP)  population:  all  subjects  of  the  efficacy  population  who  attended  all  required 
study visits, completed the study, and were without any major protocol violations; 
•  Safety population: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (either Voncento SP or 
RP). Subjects were included in the analysis according to the treatments actually received. 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 39/91 
 
  
  
No formal statistical tests were performed. P-values should be interpreted in an exploratory manner. 
Two-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for PK analyses only. All analyses were 
considered exploratory, and thus no adjustments for multiplicity were applied. 
Missing data were not replaced; summaries were based on observed data. 
The following subgroups of subjects were considered for selected analyses: 
•  On-demand subgroup: All Voncento infusions in Part 2 were given due to bleeding or surgical 
events, but none for prophylaxis or prevention.  
• 
• 
Prophylaxis subgroup: ≥90% of the Voncento infusions in Part 2 (excluding the first infusion) 
were applied ≤3 days after the previous Voncento infusion, excluding subjects of the on-demand 
subgroup. 
Prevention subgroup: <90% of the Voncento infusions in Part 2 (excluding the first infusion) were 
applied  ≤3  days  after  the  previous  Voncento  infusion,  excluding  subjects  of  the  on-demand 
subgroup.

Conduct of the study 
Three general substantial amendments and 2 country-specific amendments for Russia were issued after 
the study protocol had been finalised on 10 September 2008. Main changes from these amendments are 
outlined below. 
•  Amendment 1 was issued on 21 January 2009, before the enrolment of any subjects, and included the 
following main changes: increase of the duration of the screening period to up to 14 days to allow 
sufficient processing time for the screening assessment; reduced blood volumes for children were 
inserted; introduction of the  Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC); definition of major 
bleeding  events  was  revised;  FVIII  level,  haematology,  and  biochemistry  determinations  prior  to 
major bleeding events or surgical procedures, respectively, were deleted. 
•  Amendment 2 was issued on 29 April 2009, before the enrolment of any subjects, and included the 
following main changes: change of the exclusion criteria to allow the admission of subjects with a 
positive hepatitis C viral load but to exclude subjects with an active hepatitis C; bicarbonate testing 
was  deleted  from  biochemistry  determinations;  inconsistencies  with  regard  to  the  start  of  the 
reporting period of AEs were resolved. 
•  Amendment 3 was issued on 04 November 2009. At that time, 3 subjects included in the analyses for 
this report had been enrolled. The further conduct of the study for already enrolled subjects was not 
affected  by  this  amendment.  The  following  main  changes  were  included:  change  of  laboratory 
parameters at screening to perform HIV viral load testing only if subjects were HIV antibody positive; 
increase of the number of enrolled subjects to approximately 80. This change in sample size was 
made in order to collect more efficacy data; the PK component and thus the sample size estimation 
was  not  affected  by  this  change;  increase  of  the  number  of  evaluable  subjects    to  at  least  65; 
Specification of “prevention of bleedings” within the on-demand treatment regimen.  
Country-specific amendment 1 for Russia was issued on 24 July 2008 to change the minimum age of 
subjects to be included in Russia to 18 years and amendment 2 was issued on 08 July 2009 to add that the 
HIV viral load was only to be determined if the subject was HIV positive.

assessment by the Investigator.  
Per-protocol (PP) population of 68 patients (84%). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Haemostatic efficacy 
The Investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy is shown by month in Table 14. Results in the PP 
population were comparable (data not shown). 
Table 14: Investigator’s monthly haemostatic efficacy assessment (efficacy population) 
Haemostatic efficacy assessment of bleeding events 
A total of 667 bleeding events were reported during the study. The number of bleeding events are 
summarised in Table 15, overall and by bleeding type. Eleven subjects in the prophylaxis subgroup and 6 
subjects in the prevention subgroup had no bleeding events during the study. The median number of 
bleeds per month in the first month was 0 in the prophylaxis sub-group (range 0 to 5) and 1 in the 
prevention sub-group (range 0 to 8) and values were almost the same in the following months. 
Table 15: Number of bleeding events per subject (efficacy population)

A descriptive analysis of the number of bleeding events per subject by categories of mean time between 
Voncento administrations (<3, 3-<4, ≥4 days) indicated that the more time there was between Voncento 
administrations the more bleeding events occurred on average (Table 16).

population) 
Haemostatic efficacy results for the prophylaxis and prevention are summarised in table 18. 
Table 18: Investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy per bleeding event, by 
prophylaxis and prevention subgroups (efficacy population) 
Based on the subject’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy, for 87.9% of bleeding days the haemostatic 
efficacy was assessed by the subject as either excellent or good, and for 11.0% as moderate; for 10 
Assessment report

bleeding days (1.1%), no haemostatic efficacy was seen according to the subject’s assessment. Only 38 
bleeding events lasted more than 2 days. Results in the PP population were comparable (data not shown). 
Haemostatic efficacy assessment of surgical events 
A total of 37 surgical events, 12 major and 25 minor, occurred during the study in 20 subjects of the 
efficacy population. A haemostatic efficacy assessment at discharge was provided by the Investigator for 
20 surgical events: 10 major in 10 subjects and 10 minor in 3 subjects. At discharge, the Investigator 
assessed the haemostatic efficacy for 2 of the major surgical events as good and for the remaining major 
and minor surgical events as excellent.  
Table  19:  Surgical  events:  Assessment  of  haemostatic  efficacy  and  blood  loss  per  event 
(efficacy population) 
Results in the PP population were similar (data not shown).  
Blood loss during surgical events 
The blood loss during the 37 surgical events in the efficacy population (Table 19) was assessed as  more 
than expected for 1 surgical event (2.7%). This latter surgical event was reported for one subject who 
underwent a major knee surgery (total replacement) which required 1 Voncento infusion of 50 IU/kg prior 
to or during surgery and 18 post-surgery infusions of a total of 885 IU/kg Voncento; the subject also 
required 4 transfusions of blood product while was hospitalised for the surgical event.  
Blood product transfusions 
Five subjects (6.2%) in the efficacy population (4 [5.9%] in the PP population) required any blood product 
transfusion. All 5 subjects each underwent a major knee surgery. The median amount of transfused blood 
product for these 5 subjects was 910.0 mL and ranged from 250 to 1530 ml. Blood loss was assessed as 
less than expected for 4 of these subjects (3 with excellent haemostatic efficacy at discharge and 1 with 
good haemostatic efficacy) and as more than expected for the remaining subject (with excellent 
haemostatic efficacy at discharge). 
Usage of the investigational medicinal product 
Details on the usage of Voncento SP during the entire study are as follows: 29 subjects were included in 
the prophylaxis subgroup and 51 subjects in the prevention subgroup; 1 subject received Voncento as 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 46/91 
 
 
 
  
  
on-demand therapy. Furthermore, 62 subjects took Voncento as treatment for a bleeding event, 18 prior 
to and during surgery, and 17 after surgery. The median average Voncento SP dose per infusion was 26.6 
IU/kg body weight and ranged from 14 to 40 IU/kg. 
Among the 64 subjects with at least 1 bleeding event during the study, 40 subjects (62.5%) (9 [50.0%] 
in the prophylaxis subgroup and 31 [68.9%] in the prevention subgroup) had bleeding events that each 
required either no or only 1 Voncento infusion. This includes 10 subjects who had a total of 12 bleeding 
events (5 subjects with 6 such events each in the prophylaxis and the prevention subgroups) that were 
reported as not being treated with Voncento. Four of these subjects received Voncento shortly (within <2 
h) after the bleeding event, 3 subjects had received Voncento on the same day prior to the bleeding 
event, and for 2 subjects Voncento infusions given on the day of the bleeding event were related to a 
surgical event on that day. These latter 2 subjects, both from the prophylaxis subgroup, had only 1 
bleeding event during the entire study. The Investigator assessed the haemostatic efficacy for all these 12 
events, as excellent in 9 cases and as good in the remaining 3 cases. 
Ancillary analyses 
The efficacy data of the 3 adolescent subjects  two treated for prophylaxis and 1 for prevention have been 
submitted by the applicant. None required surgery during the course of the study. 
The 3 adolescent subjects in the study received 74, 62, and 54 infusions at an average dose per infusion 
of 40.2, 32.7 and 34.8 IU/kg, respectively, for bleeding or prophylaxis. These average doses were slightly 
higher than the mean doses per infusion reported for the efficacy population as a whole.

Investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy per bleeding event 
There was a haemostatic efficacy assessment in 656 of 667 events as 
follows: 
Excellent in 396/656 (60.4%); Good in 236/656 (36.0%); Moderate in 
23/656(3.5%)  
None 1/656 (0.2%). The pattern of efficacy was similar in the

Excellent in 509/944 (53.9%); Good in 321/944 (34.0%); Moderate in 
104/944 (11.0%) and None in 10/944 (1.1%) 
Blood Transfusions 
 5 subjects in the efficacy population, each of whom underwent major 
knee surgery, required a blood transfusion. 
The median amount of transfused blood product for these 5 subjects 
was  910.0  mL  and  ranged  from  250  to  1530  mL.  Blood  loss  was 
assessed as less than expected for 4 of these subjects (3 with excellent 
haemostatic  efficacy  at  discharge  and  1  with  good  haemostatic 
efficacy) and as more than expected for the remaining subject (with 
excellent haemostatic efficacy at discharge;

Study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 (Von Willebrand Disease)                                   
Study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 was an open-label, multi-centre designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
Voncento in patients with VWD. The study involved patients with a diagnosis of VWD who required 
prophylactic therapy, had a non-surgery bleed or were undergoing surgery. Initially, the study was 
designed to include adult subjects (aged ≥18 years) only, but following a protocol amendment children 
could also be recruited into the study, which led to the inclusion of one 3-year-old child. 
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Voncento RP in the treatment of 
NSB events, in the management of surgery procedures and prophylactic therapy in subjects with VWD 
where DDAVP treatment was deemed by the investigator to be ineffective, inadequate, or 
contraindicated.  Subjects were to be treated for 12 months. The dose and frequency of human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex were determined by the investigator based on the subject’s weight, their 
VWF:RCo levels and/or factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C), and the requirement for treatment 
(prophylaxis, non-surgery bleeding, or surgery). 
Results 
The study was conducted from December 2004 until May 2007. A total of 23 subjects were recruited and 
grouped according to the first reason for requiring treatment (treatment event). The groups were: major 
surgery, minor surgery, NSB event, and prophylaxis. There were 17 initial surgical events: 9 major and 8 
minor. Two subjects were enrolled into the study with an NSB event as their initial event and 4 subjects 
required prophylactic treatment. Seventeen subjects completed the 12-month study duration. Four 
subjects were withdrawn as a result of the study termination by the Sponsor, 1 subject was lost to follow 
up, and 1 subject was transferred to a non-trial site for treatment.  
Twelve subjects were male and 11 were female; all were Caucasian with the exception of 1 Asian and 1 
subject whose race was reported as “other”. The mean age was 47.2 years (range: 3-85 years) and the 
mean weight was 75.0 kg (range: 17.2-110.0 kg). The 3-year-old child was the only subject aged <18 
years. Seven subjects presented with Type 1 VWD, 2 with Type 2A VWD, 6 with Type 2M VWD, 7 with 
Type 3 VWD, and 1 subject with Type  2 VWD where the subtype was unknown.

Subjects received a mean daily dose per treatment event (NSB event or surgical procedure) of 34.1 IU 
FVIII/kg, for a median duration of 2 days (range: 1-24) per event (7.5 days [range: 3- 24 days] for major 
surgery; 2.0 days [range: 1-8 days] for minor surgery; 2 days [range: 1- 10 days] for NSB events. 
The median number of infusions per treatment event was higher for major surgery (10 infusions; range: 
3-35) than for minor surgery (2 infusions; range: 1-14) or for non-surgery bleedings (2 infusions; range: 
1-12). The median overall exposure to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex was 8 days (range: 1-197 
days). In the prophylactic group, the overall median number of infusions was 62 (range: 55-199) and the 
median exposure was 62 days (range: 53-197 days). 
Haemostatic assessment 
Ten major surgical events, 19 minor surgical events, and 31 NSB events (including 22 spontaneous NSB 
events in the 4 subjects on prophylaxis) were reported during the study.  
In the ITT Set, haemostatic efficacy for all minor and major surgery events, and patients on prophylactic 
therapy was rated by the investigator as Good or Excellent at all-time points. For the non-surgery bleed 
events with investigator assessments four events were rated as Good or Excellent at all-time points, one 
event was rated as Moderate, and one event was rated as None (severe and uncontrolled bleeding) for the 
first 3 days before haemostasis was reached on Day 4 when the event was rated as Good and remained 
that way thereafter. Similar results for haemostatic efficacy were obtained in the PP Set. 
FVIII:C/VWF 
Plasma levels of FVIII:C were low (< 50%) for the majority of surgery events in the ITT Set (minor 
surgery: 10 [76.9%] of 13 events; major surgery: 7 [77.8%] of 9 events) before administration of 
Voncento (Table 22). On Day 1 the levels increased to within the normal range for most events (minor 
surgery: 90.0% of events; major surgery: 100.0% of events) and levels remained in the normal range for 
the majority of events up to and including the Post-treatment Visit. At the 30-Day Follow-up Visit, plasma 
levels had fallen back to low once more in the majority of surgery events. Two patients had high FVIII:C 
levels (> 200%) during treatment for their major surgery events. The plasma levels of VWF:RCo were low 
(< 45%) for most surgery treatment events (minor surgery: 11 [84.6%] of 13 events, major surgery: 9 
[100.0%] of 9 events) prior to the first dose of Voncento. On Day 1, the levels had increased to within the 
normal range in 50.0% of minor surgery events and 88.9% in major surgery events, and levels remained 
in the normal range for the majority of events up to Day 5. Subsequent to Day 5, the levels ranged 
between low and normal (< 200%). The levels for the majority of events at the Post-treatment Visit were 
< 45% (minor surgery: 7 [53.8%] of 13 events; major surgery: 4 [57.1%] of 7 events). The plasma 
levels for VWF:Ag and VWF:CB followed a similar pattern to FVIII:C levels for both minor and major 
surgery events. In the non-surgery bleed events, plasma levels of FVIII:C and VWF:RCo stayed low or 
within the normal range at all time points; VWF:Ag and VWF:CB levels were similar. Data were often 
unavailable which may have been due to patients self-administering Voncento at home without contacting 
the study site and/or the failure of the study site personnel to collect the required laboratory samples. 
This has resulted in the numbers in this treatment group being too small to show any definitive movement 
up or down in plasma levels. The efficacy results for the PP Set were similar to those of the ITT Set (data 
not shown).

Blood Loss and Transfusions 
In the ITT Set, over 80% of the surgery events that were assessed for blood loss were considered to have 
had less or equivalent blood loss for minor or major surgery than would normally be expected in an event 
involving a patient without a bleeding disorder. Four patients received blood transfusions during the study 
for their bleeding and surgery events. 
Voncento Administration 
For the major surgery treatment group, a longer treatment period and more infusions with Voncento were 
required compared with the minor surgery and non-surgery bleed groups. The mean total dose of FVIII:C 
in Voncento required to resolve an event was highest for patients in the major surgery group compared 
with patients in the non-surgery bleed group and minor surgery group. Mean daily dose per treatment 
event was slightly higher for patients in the major surgery group compared with patients in the minor

surgery group (41.35 IU/kg/day compared with 33.48 IU/kg/day) and was clearly higher compared with 
the non-surgery bleed group (27.36 IU/kg/day). 
Study CSLCT-BIO-95-41 (Haemophilia A) 
• 
Study CSLCT-BIO-95-41 was an open, multicentre study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of 
Voncento in patients with severe haemophilia A. This study was carried out in 1998 – 1999 in Australia 
and New Zealand. 
The objectives of the study were: assessment of  the safety and tolerability (via the collection of adverse 
event data) of Voncento, assessment of the efficacy of Voncento in a study population with severe 
haemophilia A and assessment of the potential for development of "silent inhibitors" (inhibitors not 
detectable by Bethesda Unit Assay) by repeating pharmacokinetic assessments of Voncento in a 
minimum of 10 subjects who participated in the pharmacokinetic study of Voncento. A 20% change in a 
pharmacokinetic parameter (half-life or AUC) will be considered of clinical significance. 
Results 
A total of 30 subjects were enrolled into the study, including all 16 subjects from the preceding PK study 
CSLCT-BIO-95-30. Four subjects were withdrawn from the study: 1 subject each due to AEs (recurrent 
episodes of chest pain, back pain, and anxiety 3 to 5 minutes post-infusion), a protocol violation (the 
subject received AHF [HP]), a scheduled elective surgery, and a suspected therapeutic failure. 
All subjects were male. The mean age was 35.3 years (range: 16-62 years) and the mean body weight 
was 76.4 kg (range: 50-102 kg). Two adolescent subjects (aged 16 and 17 years) were included. 
Twenty-five subjects (83.3%) were of Caucasian race, 2 were Asian, and 1 was Fijian Indian. Race was 
not reported for 2 subjects.  
The screening for FVIII inhibitors revealed no subjects with inhibitor at study entry and no subjects 
developed a FVIII inhibitor at any point in the study. 
Subjects received human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex as replacement therapy for a period of 6 
months. All 30 subjects received at least 1 infusion. A total of 1019 infusions were administered to 30 
subjects over the study period of 12 months, resulting in 980 exposure days. Nine subjects achieved ≥50 
exposure days, Overall, 390 infusions (38.3%) were administered for spontaneous bleeding events, 273 
(26.8%) as prophylaxis, and 248 (24.3%) for trauma episodes. The reason for use was reported as 
“other” for 99 infusions and was missing for 9 infusions. The total number of administrations of human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex per subject ranged from 6 to 85. 
The average number of vials used per infusion ranged from 3.1 to 10.7. The average volume infused 
ranged from 15.3 to 53.4 mL and the average total dose of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex ranged 
from 757.5 to 2,671.4 IU. The overall average dose per infusion was 1,390 IU. The total dose of human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex per subject ranged 66.7 to 1,895.2 IU/kg and the total number of 
exposure days per subject ranged from 6 to 84 days with a mean of 32.6 days. A small number of subjects 
required more than 1 infusion per day to treat major bleeding events. 
The haemostatic efficacy of the IMP was assessed as excellent for 124 (15.9%) of the 782 administrations 
graded by subjects for efficacy, as good for 491 administrations (62.8%), as moderate for 136 
administrations (17.4%), and as poor for 31 administrations (4.0%). For 237 administrations of human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex, no haemostatic efficacy assessment was reported (including 137 
prophylactic infusions, some initial infusions, and PK infusions). Twenty-one of the 31 “poor” treatment 
responses were reported following treatment for a spontaneous bleeding event, 1 for trauma, 3 for 
prophylaxis and 6 for other reasons (in 3 subjects undergoing other treatments). The most frequently 
reported response was excellent for 4 subjects (13.3%), good for 18 subjects (60.0%), and moderate for

the remaining 8 subjects (26.7%). The 2 adolescent subjects evaluated the haemostatic efficacy of 
human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex as either good or excellent, where the haemostatic efficacy 
assessment was available.  
The investigator or study nurse classified the subjects’ response for the first infusion, and subjects 
evaluated the haemostatic efficacy during home therapy thereafter using a 4-point scale with the 
outcomes excellent, good, moderate, or poor. However, not all infusions were categorised according to 
the subjects’ response to therapy (e.g. infusions administered for prophylaxis were not always perceived 
by subjects as evaluable). The haemostatic efficacy of the IMP was assessed as excellent for 124 (15.9%) 
of the 782 administrations graded by subjects for efficacy, as good for 491 administrations (62.8%), as 
moderate for 136 administrations (17.4%), and as poor for 31 administrations (4.0%). For 237 
administrations of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex, no haemostatic efficacy assessment was 
reported (including 137 prophylactic infusions, some initial infusions, and PK infusions). Twenty-one of 
the 31 “poor” treatment responses were reported following treatment for a spontaneous bleeding event, 
1 for trauma, 3 for prophylaxis and 6 for other reasons (in 3 subjects undergoing other treatments). The 
most frequently reported response was excellent for 4 subjects (13.3%), good for 18 subjects (60.0%), 
and moderate for the remaining 8 subjects (26.7%). The 2 adolescent subjects evaluated the 
haemostatic efficacy of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex as either good or excellent, where the 
haemostatic efficacy assessment was available.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design and conduct of the pivotal trial CSLCT-BIO-07-47 was in accordance with CHMP guidelines. 
A number of findings were identified with regard to the conduct of the pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 by 
the EMA GCP inspection and the independent audit initiated by the Applicant but overall the integrity of 
the efficacy and safety data for both studies was found not to be compromised (see section 2.4.1.) as 
the findings identified did not have an impact on centrally important trial parameters such as diagnosis 
or efficacy and safety evaluations.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
•  Haemophilia A  
In the pivotal study, in the entire efficacy population, a total of 667 bleeding events were reported during 
the study, corresponding to a mean number of bleeding events per subject of 8.2. Haemostatic efficacy 
was assessed by the Investigator as either excellent or good for the vast majority of subjects for bleeding 
events or surgical events. The subjects assessed the haemostatic efficacy of Voncento as excellent on 
53.9% , as good on 34.0%, as moderate on 11.0%, and as poor on 1.1% of bleeding days. 
Five subjects (6.2%) in the efficacy population required blood product transfusion. For more than 97% of 
the 37 surgical events blood loss was assessed as less than (40.5%) or equivalent to (56.8%) the blood 
loss expected for a subject without a bleeding disorder. 
According to definitions based on the number of days between Voncento infusions, 29 subjects were 
included in the prophylaxis subgroup and 51 subjects in the prevention subgroup; 1 subject received 
Voncento as on-demand therapy. The mean number of bleeding events per subject was considerably 
lower in the prophylaxis subgroup (3.5 bleeding events) than in the prevention subgroup (10.7 bleeding 
events). Among the subjects with at least 1 bleeding event during the study, 9 subjects (50.0%) in the 
prophylaxis subgroup and 31 (68.9%) in the prevention subgroup required no or only 1 Voncento infusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 55/91 
 
  
  
per bleeding event. Haemostatic efficacy results within these subgroups were similar to those in the 
overall efficacy population. 
The median average Voncento SP dose per infusion was 26.6 IU/kg body weight and ranged from 14 to 40 
IU/kg, with 62 subjects taking Voncento as treatment for a bleeding event, 18 prior to and during surgery, 
and 17 after surgery. Overall, 13.9% of bleeding events required more than 1 Voncento infusion. 
Results in the per protocol (PP) population were similar to those seen in the efficacy population. 
Furthermore, efficacy results, including the usage of Voncento SP, in the 3 adolescent subjects were not 
different from the efficacy results in the efficacy population. 
•  Von Willebrand’s Disease 
In the pivotal Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, efficacy in the on-demand treatment of non-surgical bleeds, 
studied in 20 subjects for 12 months, was reported by the investigator as being excellent in 371/405 
(91.6%) of the bleeds, good in 27/405 (6.7%) and moderate in 7/405 (1,7%). These bleeds included 7 
major mucosal bleeds as required by the relevant CHMP guideline. The subject’s assessment of 
hemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event on all bleeding days was excellent in 476/602 (79.1%), 
good in 104/602 (17.3%), moderate in 21/602 (3.5%) and none in 1/602 (0.2%).  
A total of 538 NSB events were reported during the study, resulting in a median number of NSB events 
per subject of 19 (range: 2-82). Seven subjects had a total of 132 NSB events that did not require 
treatment with Voncento and which were therefore considered not evaluable.  
Additional data on 10 major surgical events was provided for VWD subjects from the supportive study 
CSLCT-BIO-03-97 and this demonstrated that in 88% of subjects blood loss was less than or equivalent 
to that expected in a patients with no bleeding diathesis. Voncento was used in 10 major and in 15 minor 
surgeries. In those surgeries, where hemostatic efficacy was reported, efficacy was rated on day 1 as 
excellent in 10/11 of the minor surgeries and in 8/10 of the major surgeries, and as good in the other 2 
major surgeries and 1 minor surgery. 
Two investigator-led efficacy studies, one reported by Shortt et al (2007) and another by Howman et al 
(2010), provide supportive evidence of efficacy in VWD (data not shown).  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
There are only very limited paediatric data from the pivotal trials:   
Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 included 3 adolescent subjects. 
Study CSLCT-BIO-07-47 included 3 adolescent subjects for prophylaxis / prevention. 
According to the relevant CHMP guideline on VWF products, paediatric data could be submitted 
post-authorisation. The recently adopted CHMP guideline on FVIII products requires pediatric data to be 
available pre-authorisation. However, a PIP has been submitted and the PDCO has agreed that the 
efficacy /safety trials for both indications in children < 12 years should be initiated pre-authorisation and 
clinical study results be submitted post-authorisation.   
These are study CSLCT–BIO-08-53 in previously treated children from birth to less than 12 years of age 
with hemophilia A and study CSLCT–BIO-08-52 in subjects aged birth to < 12 years old with VWD.   
The applicant also intends to submit study CSLCT–BIO-10-67 in children from 1 month to less than 12 
years of age with hemophilia A who have developed high responding antibodies to FVIII 
post-authorisation.

Additional expert consultation 
As requested by CHMP, the BPWP was consulted on the following points: 
1) Post-marketing data in paediatric VWD patients < 12 years of age 
BPWP members noted that the “Guideline on the clinical investigation of human plasma derived von 
Willebrand factor products” (CPMP/BPWG/220/02) and the core SmPC for VWF products 
((CPMP/BPWG/278/02) were adopted in 2005 before the paediatric regulation was implemented. 
With the response to the D180 LoI, the applicant submitted a study protocol for an efficacy and safety 
PMS in 20 VWD patients > 12 years (CSLCT-BIO-12-83), however, enrolment is not open to children <12 
years. Data in at least 8 paediatric VWD patients < 12 years are collected in an on-going clinical study 
(CSLCTBIO-08-52). The final study report, including PK data, is expected in 2014. BPWP members noted 
the Rapporteurs’ conclusion that the clinical data is sufficient to support approval of the VWD indication in 
patients > 12 years, as applied for by the applicant, and taking into account that efficacy and safety data 
in a further 20 patients > 12 years will be investigated post-authorisation. BPWP advised that if CHMP 
considers that there is currently insufficient data to recommend use in children under 12 years, this 
should be addressed in the SmPC according to the approach in the core SmPC for FVIII products since this 
in line with the latest SmPC guideline. Therefore, the age range > 12 years would be indicated in section 
4.1 of the SmPC. In section 4.2 of the SmPC a statement informing about limited data in children would 
be included. 
A two-step approach is recommended for the requirements for paediatric data in VWD patients. The 
first-step is the submission and evaluation of the final clinical study report (CSLCT-BIO-08-52) 
investigating 8 paediatric patients < 12 years in 2014. Once these data are available and provided the 
evaluation is positive, the post-marketing study >12 years (CSLCT-BIO-12-83) should be opened to allow 
enrolment of patients < 12 years. The company’s agreement to this strategy should be reflected in the 
Risk Management Plan.  
2) Post-marketing data in paediatric haemophilia A patients < 12 years of age 
While the guideline on FVIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009) gives clear guidance on the 
number of patients to be enrolled in the PMS for recombinant FVIII products, it states that for 
plasma-derived products a smaller number of patients can be enrolled on a case-by-case basis and if 
adequately justified by the applicant. 
The applicant proposes to include 100 haemophilia A patients > 12 years in the PMS for Voncento,  which 
is considered acceptable by the Rapporteurs taking account the currently available clinical data,  but does 
not propose to enrol children < 12 years. In the on-going paediatric study (CSLCT-BIO-08-53), at least 20 
patients < 12 years will be studied. A further 10 children < 12 years will be studied in study CSLCT–
BIO-10-67.  
BPWP members noted the Rapporteurs’ conclusion that the clinical data is sufficient to support approval 
of the haemophilia A indication in patients > 12 years as applied for by the applicant. BPWP advised that 
if CHMP considers that there is currently insufficient data to recommend use in children under 12 years, 
the indication would be restricted in section 4.1 of the SmPC and in section 4.2 a statement on limited 
data in children < 12 years would be included, in accordance with the core SmPC for FVIII products. BPWP 
members acknowledge the difficulties in enrolment of paediatric patients in clinical studies with 
plasma-derived FVIII products in Europe, nevertheless, the data from the on-going paediatric study 
should be supplemented with paediatric data collected in the post-authorisation phase, following the 
same step-wise approach as described above for VWD. Therefore, once the data are available from 
paediatric study (CSLCT-BIO-08-53) and provided the evaluation is positive, the post-marketing study 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 57/91 
 
  
  
>12 years (CSLCT-BIO-12-78) should be opened to allow enrolment of patients < 12 years. The 
company’s agreement to this strategy should be reflected in the Risk Management Plan.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Adequate efficacy has been provided for Haemophilia A (prophylaxis and treatment) and for Von 
Willebrand Disease (treatment) in patients over the age of 12 years. The data provided were robust and 
in compliance with CHMP guidelines.  
The CHMP taking into account that Voncento is in principle a conventional plasma-derived product with 
documented efficacy/safety and post marketing experience, decided that there is no basis for an age 
restriction in the indications. In line with the core SmPC for factor VIII products 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/1691/1999, rev. 1) it will be reflected in section 4.2. of the SmPC that the safety and 
efficacy of Voncento in children < 12 years have not been established and no data are available. 
As recommended in the relevant CHMP guidelines for clinical investigation of factor VIII and Von 
Willebrand factor products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 and CPMP/BPWG/220/02) post 
authorisation studies aiming to assess the long–term efficacy of Voncento in both indications are included

In all prospective clinical studies, safety was assessed through reporting of AEs, including serious AEs 
(SAEs) and AEs considered related to the study drug (adverse drug reactions [ADRs]), and the 
assessment of biochemistry, haematology, and vital signs. In addition, physical examinations were 
performed in pivotal studies CSLCT-BIO-07-47 and CSLCT-BIO-08-54, and in supportive study 
CSLCT-BIO-95-41. FVIII inhibitors were assessed in haemophilia A studies CSLCT-BIO-07-47 and 
CSLCT-BIO-95-41, and FVIII and VWF inhibitors were assessed in VWD study CSLCT-BIO-08-54. In 
supportive haemophilia A studies CSLCT-BIO-95-30 and CSLCT-BIO-95-41, urinalysis was also part of 
the safety assessments, as was a virology assessment in study CSLCT-BIO-95-41. 
Patient exposure  
A total of 168 subjects were exposed to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in the prospective clinical 
studies, including 111 subjects with haemophilia A and 57 subjects with VWD. Among the exposed 
subjects, 5 subjects with haemophilia A and 3 subjects with VWD were adolescents, ie, aged 12 - <18 
years, and 1 subject with VWD was a 3-year-old child. An additional 43 adult subjects with VWD were 
exposed with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in the investigator-led Shortt study and 43 children 
and adolescents were exposed in the investigator-led Howman study. 
Doses calculated for the treatment of haemophilia A were based solely upon the FVIII required to replace 
endogenous FVIII, while doses calculated for the treatment of VWD were based on VWF:RCo. In general 
doses were approximately 10 to 40 IU FVIII / kg  in the hemophilia A studies CSL-CT-BIO-07-47 and 
CSL-CT-BIO-95-41 and 15 to 50 IU VWF:RiCo / kg in VWD study CSLCT-BIO-08-54. In study 
CSLCT-BIO-03-97 the mean daily dose per treatment event was 34 IU FVIII / kg. 
Doses in the retrospective investigator-led Shortt and Howman studies were based on FVIII. 
Adverse events 
A total of 417 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs, i.e. with onset after first dose of study 
medication) were reported during the clinical studies, 210 in haemophilia A studies (143 in pivotal study 
CSLCT-BIO-07-47, 2 and 65 in supportive studies CSLCT-BIO-95-30 and CSLCTBIO-95-41, respectively) 
and 207 in VWD studies (72 in pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-54, 24 and 111 in supportive studies 
CSLCT-BIO-00-75 and CSLCT-BIO-03-97, respectively).  
Two of the 8 adolescent subjects included in the prospective clinical studies experienced a total of 8 
TEAEs, 1 additional adolescent in the Howman study had 1 AE, and the 3-year-old child in VWD study 
CSLCT-BIO-03-97 had a total of 6 TEAEs; In the Shortt study no adverse reactions to treatment were 
reported. Two bleeding events were reported but neither of these was considered to be associated with 
“lack of efficacy” or raised any safety concerns. In the Howman study there was 1 reported case of nausea 
in one adolescent, which was considered possibly related to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex by 
the investigator. 
An overview of the number of subjects experiencing at least 1 TEAE during the prospective clinical studies 
is provided by AE is summarized in table 25 below.

In subjects with haemophilia A, the most commonly reported AEs were headache (11 subjects), viral 
infection (8 subjects; however, no cases of suspected transmission of hepatitis virus or parvovirus B19 
occurred), arthralgia (8 subjects), and influenza (7 subjects). Similar to the studies in haemophilia A, in 
subjects with VWD headache was most commonly reported across all VWD studies (reported in 15 
subjects). Other frequently reported AEs in the VWD studies were procedural pain (ie, post-operative 
pain) and nausea, reported in 7 subjects each. Frequencies of subjects with TEAEs reported during the 
prospective clinical studies for the most frequently reported TEAEs (>5% of subjects in any study) are 
summarized in table 26 below.

Across all studies (both indications), the AEs that were reported more than 3 times overall were: 
headache (10 cases, all in haemophilia A study CSLCT-BIO-95-41; 9 cases occurred in 1 subject), back 
pain (5 cases, all in haemophilia A studies: 1 each in studies CSLCTBIO-07-47 and CSLCT-BIO-95-30 and 
3 in study CSLCT-BIO-95-41) and tachycardia (4 cases, all in haemophilia A study CSLCT-BIO-07-47). 
These 4 cases of tachycardia were noted in the subject’s home diary as palpitation; they were mild in 
intensity and resolved without any actions taken. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events  
Deaths 
No deaths occurred during or shortly after any of the clinical studies in either the haemophilia A or VWD 
subject populations. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
A total of 9 subjects experienced SAEs during the clinical studies, 5 subjects with haemophilia A and 4 
subjects with VWD (Table 28). None of the adolescent subjects experienced an SAE. There was one event 
of aggravation of pre-existing FVIII inhibitors in study CSLCT-BIO-07-47 which was considered possibly 
related to the medication and led to discontinuation of the study for that patient (see Laboratory findings). 
The other SAEs were not considered related to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex or to study 
procedures. 
The 3-year-old child in study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 experienced an upper respiratory tract infection which 
was considered serious.

Table 28: Serious Adverse events in clinical trials 
Laboratory findings 
In the pivotal study in haemophilia A 3 of the 81 subjects in the safety population had a clinically 
significant value for any of the biochemistry parameters. In the supportive studies 8 subjects (3 and 5 
subjects, respectively) experienced a clinically significant abnormal biochemistry result post-infusion, 
however, none of these values in either study were considered to be related to human coagulation 
FVIII/VWF complex. No clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests were reported.   
FVIII inhibitors were assessed in haemophilia A studies CSLCT-BIO-07-47 and CSLCT-BIO-95- 41, as well 
as in VWD study CSLCT-BIO-03-97. FVIII and VWF inhibitors were assessed in VWD study 
CSLCT-BIO-08-54. A positive finding was reported for 1 subject in study CSLCT-BIO-07-47. The positive 
inhibitor titre at the final visit for this subject was also reported as an SAE that led to study discontinuation 
for this subject. No positive FVIII inhibitor titres occurred during haemophilia A study CSLCT-BIO-95-41 
or VWD studies CSLCTBIO- 08-54 and CSLCT-BIO-03-97.

In the pivotal VWD sudy 1 subject (with hepatitis C) had clinically significant abnormal biochemistry 
values during the study: ALT and AST had increased from normal at baseline to abnormal at Month 3. In 
the supportive VWD study, 3 subjects had a clinically significant biochemistry results some of which were 
reported as TEAEs. Two subjects had high gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST); 1 of these subjects also had high 
chloride and low urea with hepatic steatosis reported as a TEAE and the other subject also had a TEAE of 
liver function test abnormal considered possibly related to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex. A 
further subject had low potassium consistent with a pre-existing hypokalaemia.  
In the supportive VWD study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 one subject with abnormal liver function test was 
reported that was considered possibly related to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex. 
Overall, there were no consistent changes in mean biochemistry values across the studies, and no trends 
observed in changes in individual biochemistry values. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
No specific subgroup analyses by intrinsic factors were conducted. Although the safety of human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex has not been systematically evaluated in children yet, currently available 
clinical experience (including the Howman study) and post-marketing information suggest no apparent 
differences in children compared to adults. The safety of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in the 
geriatric population has not been systematically studied. However, subjects in the clinical trials have 
included individuals up to 85 years. 
Safety in Adolescent Subjects 
Eight adolescent subjects (aged 12 - <18 years) were included in the prospective clinical studies, 5 in 
haemophilia A studies (3 in study CSLCT-BIO-07-47 and 2 in study CSLCT-BIO-95-41; 1 of the latter 2 
also participated in study CSLCT-BIO-95-30) and 3 in VWD study CSLCT-BIO-08- 54. 
No TEAEs occurred in the 3 adolescent subjects that participated in pivotal haemophilia A study 
CSLCT-BIO-07-47. One of the 2 adolescents in supportive haemophilia A study CSLCT-BIO-95-41 
experienced 1 TEAEs during the study: 1 subject reported a skin laceration, which was considered 
unrelated to the IMP by the investigator. Another subject participating in both studies CSLCT-BIO-95-30 
and CSLCT-BIO-95-41 did not experience any TEAEs. Six TEAEs occurred in 1 of the 3 adolescent subjects 
that participated in the pivotal VWD study CSLCT-BIO-08-54: 1 subject experienced 3 cases of headache 
(2 moderate, 1 mild) and 1 case each of abdominal pain (moderate), sneezing (moderate), and cervix 
disorder (mild). All these events were considered unrelated to the IMP. All events resolved within 1 day 
with the exception of the cervix disorder which was still ongoing at the time of the interim database lock. 
Neither of the other 2 adolescent subjects experienced a TEAE. 
One case of nausea, which was considered possibly related to the IMP by the investigator, was reported 
in the Howman study in one subject. No clinically relevant findings were noted in adolescent subjects in 
any of the other safety assessments. 
Safety in Children 
One child (<12 years) was included in the prospective clinical studies: in supportive VWD study 
CSLCT-BIO-03-97, a 3-year-old child with Type 3 VWD was enrolled and received prophylactic treatment 
with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex. The child experienced 6 TEAEs during the study: 
catheter-related infection, pyrexia, oropharyngeal pain, headache, rhinorrhoea, and upper respiratory 
tract infection. All these events were mild or moderate in intensity, considered not related to the IMP, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 69/91 
 
  
  
resolved without changing the study medication regimen. The upper respiratory tract infection was 
considered serious. 
No AEs occurred in children (aged <12 years) that participated in the Howman study. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
No safety data concerning the use of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex during pregnancy and 
lactation are available.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interactions between human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and other medicinal products have been 
observed.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, 2 subjects discontinued study participation due to a TEAE. In addition to one subject in study 
CSLCT-BIO-07-47 who discontinued the study due to aggravation of pre-existing FVIII inhibitors 
(reported as SAE), 1 subject in the supportive haemophilia A study CSLCT-BIO-95-41 withdrew due to 
recurrent episodes of chest pain, back pain, and anxiety occurring 3-5 minutes post-infusion. The subject 
received a total of 10 infusions of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex, but the above described AEs 
occurred after the last 2 infusions. The events were mild, resolved without sequelae, and were considered 
by the investigator to be related to the IMP. The subject had experienced similar TEAEs (back pain and 
musculoskeletal pain) in the preceding PK study CSLCT-BIO-95-30. 
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing surveillance data collected by CSL comprise AE information collected in the company’s 
database since first registration of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex (Australia, August 2000). 
However, first supply of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex (Voncento) to patients occurred in 2001 
in Singapore. 
Post-marketing data were collected from a variety of sources including spontaneous reports (both 
consumer and health care professional), investigator-led studies (Shortt et al, 2007; Howman et al, 2010 
[paediatric subjects only]) and data from the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee 
database. The Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) written for human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex 
were provided along with a cumulative line listing of all spontaneous reports received since registration. 
Human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex was first registered in Australia in August 2000 and has since 
been registered in 11 other countries (New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Guatemala, El 
Salvador, Taiwan, Peru, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia), as Voncento, Aleviate, Human Coagulation Factor 
VIII, or TBSF Human Factor VIII. The indications covered include treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding 
events in patients with FVIII deficiency due to haemophilia A and in patients with VWD for whom 
treatment with DDAVP is ineffective or contraindicated. In Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil both 
indications are registered, while in the other countries, only the indication haemophilia A is registered. 
Since launch of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex and up to April 2011, 1,305,190 vials were 
distributed globally, and on average, 2.1 AE reports per every 100,000 vials or 2.5 spontaneous cases per 
year have been reported (Table 29). 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 70/91 
 
  
  
Table 29: Post-marketing adverse events reported per 100,000 vials of human coagulation 
FVIII/VWF complex between 2000 and April 2011 
Since August 2000, 27 spontaneous cases, including a total of 79 events reported for human coagulation 
FVIII/VWF complex, have been entered into CSL’s worldwide safety database. Twenty-four of these 
reports were from health care professionals and 3 reports were identified in the worldwide literature. All 
these spontaneous reports were considered to be reactions to human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex. 
However, not all reactions were categorised as expected events. Twenty-three of these reports were 
classified as non-serious, while 4 reports contained at least 1 serious event.  
Frequencies of the total of 79 reported events are depicted by MedDRA system organ class SOC in Figure 
5. The largest proportion of events (25 events [32%]) is from the general disorders and site 
administration conditions SOC. Next most commonly affected SOCs are nervous system disorders and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, with 8 events (10%) each.

The MedDRA preferred terms that were reported in each SOC are listed in Table 30. The 79 events 
comprised 40 different preferred terms. 
Table 30: Post-marketing adverse events reported from launch to April 2011 
All of the reported 79 events received medical review at CSL where the clinical circumstances were 
assessed against the reference safety information. No changes to the reference safety information were 
deemed necessary from the evaluation of these events.

The age distribution among the 27 spontaneous cases varied: 5 cases (19%) involved patients >45 years 
of age; 10 cases (37%) involved patients aged 18-45 years; 1 case (4%) was from a child and 1 case from 
an adolescent (aged 12 - <18 years). For 10 cases (37%), the age of the patient was not specified. 
The risks associated with the use of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex in patients with haemophilia 
A and VWD are those associated with the use of any plasma-derived coagulation factors. These include 
viral transmission, inhibitor formation and related immunomodulatory effects, allergic/anaphylactic 
reactions, and thrombosis. 
• Viral transmission: The reference safety information acknowledges that despite the safety measures 
included in the manufacturing process for human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex (virus removal and 
inactivation) such products may still potentially transmit disease. There is also the possibility that other 
known or unknown infectious agents may be present. To date there have been no clinical data to support 
the occurrence of viral transmission following the administration of human coagulation FVIII/VWF 
complex. The preferred term of hepatitis was an acute flare of pre-existing hepatitis and not a new case 
of hepatitis after human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex infusion. 
• Inhibitor formation and related immunomodulatory effects: The reference safety information for human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex states that the formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII is 
a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A (see SmPC section 4.3). This 
risk correlates with the exposure to FVIII and is highest within the first 20 exposure days. Rarely 
inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days. To date, 2 cases of inhibitor formation to human 
coagulation FVIII/VWF complex were reported to CSL after 10 years of post-marketing surveillance: 
In addition, 8 of the 27 spontaneous cases received during post-marketing surveillance were from the 
same reporter in Singapore describing 8 patients who did not adequately respond to human coagulation 
FVIII/VWF complex (lack of efficacy). A single batch of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex was 
involved; however, a batch investigation did not reveal any possible cause of the AE, and it was concluded 
that there was no batch-specific reason for these reports. No further information was retrieved and no 
evidence of inhibitor formation was confirmed. No knowledge of the circumstances of administration or 
use was obtained. 
CSL has conducted enhanced post-marketing surveillance in Australia to investigate the incidence of 
inhibitor development in patients with haemophilia A following addition of prion filtration in the 
manufacturing process in 2007. This surveillance included the monitoring of the dosing provided to 31 
patients over 6 months and an additional informal telephone and email survey for a further 6 months. No 
inhibitor development was identified. 
• Allergic/anaphylactic reactions: To date, there have been no reports of anaphylactic reactions following 
the administration of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex received. However, as with any intravenous 
protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible and symptoms indicative for such 
reactions were observed. 
• Thrombosis: Thromboembolic events have been rarely reported in patients with VWD receiving 
coagulation factor replacement therapy. There is a theoretical possibility that supranormal levels of 
FVIII:C may increase the risk-factors for VTE. To date, there have been no post-market spontaneous 
reports of thromboembolic type events (including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) after 
treatment with human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most common AEs reported and related to Voncento (both indications) were: FVIII inhibition, VWF 
inhibition, liver function test abnormal, hypersensitivity (including tachycardia, chest pain, chest 
discomfort and back pain), dysgeusia, thromboembolic event,  pyrexia and headache.  
Across all studies (both indications), the only AEs that were reported more than 3 times overall were: 
headache, back pain and palpitations. The AEs were mild to moderate and resolved spontaneously.  
Nine SAEs were reported, 8 were related to study procedures and one event of aggravation of pre-existing 
FVIII inhibitors was considered related to the medication and led to discontinuation. No deaths, no viral 
transmission and no allergic reactions occurred. 
Overall, 2 subjects discontinued the medication due to a TEAE (possibly related to Voncento). One due to 
aggravation of pre-existing FVIII inhibitors and the other subject discontinued the study due to recurrent 
episodes of chest pain, back pain, and anxiety occurring 3-5 minutes post-infusion.  
Hypersensitivity (allergic reactions): Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include 
angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, 
hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest (including chest 
pain and chest discomfort), back pain, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed, and may in 
some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock) (see SmPC section 4.8). 
FVIII inhibition: Patients with haemophilia A may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII. If 
such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, 
it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. There is no experience from 
clinical trials with Voncento in previously untreated patients (PUPs). Therefore, no valid figures on the 
incidence of clinically relevant specific inhibitors are currently available (see SmPC section 4.8). 
VWF inhibition: Patients with VWD, especially type 3 patients, may develop neutralising antibodies 
(inhibitors) to VWF. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an inadequate clinical 
response. Such antibodies are precipitating and may occur concomitantly to anaphylactic reactions. 
Therefore, patients experiencing an anaphylactic reaction should be evaluated for the presence of an 
inhibitor. In all such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted (see 
SmPC section 4.8).  
Thromboembolic events: In patients with VWD, there is a risk of occurrence of thromboembolic events, 
particularly in patients with known clinical or laboratory risk factors. In patients receiving FVIII-containing 
VWF products, sustained excessive FVIII:C plasma levels may increase the risk of thromboembolic 
events. Therefore, patients at risk must be monitored for early signs of thrombosis. Prophylaxis against 
venous thromboembolism should be instituted, according to the current recommendations (see SmPC 
sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
All the adverse reactions from the safety database reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the SmPC. 
One case of overdose has been reported from clinical trials. No undesirable effects were associated with 
this overdose.  The risk of thromboembolic events cannot be excluded in case of major overdose, 
especially in patients with VWD (see SmPC section 4.9). 
Experience in the treatment of pregnant or lactating women is not available. There are no data on fertility 
available. Voncento should be administered to pregnant or lactating VWF deficient women only if clearly 
indicated, taking into consideration that delivery confers an increased risk of haemorrhagic events in 
these patients. Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 74/91 
 
  
  
treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not available.  Therefore, Voncento should be used 
during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated (see SmPC section 4.6). 
Voncento has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see SmPC section 4.7). 
There are insufficient data to estimate the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions of Voncento 
in the paediatric population (see SmPC section 4.8). 
There is insufficient information to estimate the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions of 
Voncento in the population older than 65 years (see SmPC section 4.8). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of Voncento is considered acceptable. The AEs seen were mild-moderate and do not 
influence the safety profile. The incidence of SAEs reported is low and the type of adverse events reported 
is expected for this product.  
Inhibitor formation was seen in one subject with haemophilia. The time frame and amount of subjects 
studied is not sufficient to draw definite conclusions for this specific adverse event. Therefore 
post-marketing studies in patients with haemophilia A and in patients with VWD are considered to be 
necessary and the Applicant committed to perform the required post-marketing studies in both 
indications which will provide additional safety data.   
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.   
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 2, the PRAC considers by consensus that 
the risk management system for human plasma-derived Von Willebrand factor and human coagulation 
factor VIII  in the treatment of the proposed indications 
• 
von Willebrand disease (VWD): Treatment of haemorrhage or prevention and treatment of 
surgical bleeding in patients with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is 
ineffective or contraindicated.  
•  Haemophilia A (congenital FVIII deficiency): Prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in patients 
with haemophilia A.  
 could be acceptable provided an updated risk management plan is submitted implementing the following 
changes:  
• 
The proposed post-marketing safety and efficacy study in VWD is considered acceptable if the 
applicant commits to enrol at least (and not ‘approximately’) 20 patients that have not yet been 
included in any of the studies with Voncento/Biostate before.  
•  Amendments  to  the  targeted  questionnaires  following  receipt  of  case  reports  of  Inhibitor 
development, Embolic and thrombotic events, Transmission of infectious agents (to be agreed 
upon with the Regulatory Authorities before launch in the EU).

complication in the management of individuals with 
haemophilia  A.  These  inhibitors  are  usually  IgG 
FVIII 
immunoglobulins  directed  against 
procoagulant  activity,  which  are  quantified 
in 
Bethesda  Units  (BU)  per  ml  of  plasma.  The  risk  of 
developing inhibitors is correlated to the exposure to 
factor FVIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 
exposure days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after 
the  first  100  exposure  days.  Cases  of  recurrent 
inhibitor  (low  titre)  have  been  observed  after 
switching from one factor VIII product to another in 
previously  untreated  patients  with  more  than  100 
exposure  days  who  have  a  previous  history  of 
inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended 
to  monitor  all  patients  carefully 
inhibitor 
occurrence following any product switch. In general, 
all  patients  treated  with  human  coagulation  FVIII 
should be carefully monitored for the development of 
inhibitors  by  appropriate  clinical  observations  and 
laboratory tests. If the expected factor VIII activity 
plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not 
controlled with an appropriate dose, testing for  FVIII 
inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients 
with high levels of inhibitor,  factor VIII therapy may 
not be effective and other therapeutic options should 
be  considered.  The  management  of  such  patients 
should be directed by physicians with experience in 
the  care  of  haemophilia  A  patients  and  those  with 
factor VIII inhibitors. 
VWD: Patients with VWD, especially type 3 patients, 
may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to 
VWF. If the expected VWF:RCo activity plasma levels 
are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with 
an appropriate dose, an appropriate assay should be 
performed to determine if a VWF inhibitor is present. 
In patients with high levels of inhibitor, therapy may 
not only be ineffective but also lead to anaphylactoid 
reactions and other therapeutic options should be 
considered.  
Statements on the development of FVIII/VWF 
inhibitors are also found in the undesirable effects

VWD: There is a risk of occurrence of thrombotic 
events, particularly in patients with known clinical or 
laboratory risk factors. Therefore, patients at risk 
must be monitored for early signs of thrombosis. 
Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism should 
be instituted, according to the current 
recommendations. When using a FVIII-containing 
VWF product, the treating physician should be aware 
that continued treatment may cause an excessive rise 
in FVIII:C. In patients receiving FVIII-containing VWF 
products, plasma levels of FVIII:C should be 
monitored to avoid sustained excessive FVIII:C 
plasma levels which may increase the risk of 
thrombotic events, and antithrombotic measures 
should be considered.

risk of transmission of infectious agents: 
Virus safety: Standard measures to prevent 
infections resulting from the use of medicinal 
products prepared from human blood or plasma 
include selection of donors, screening of individual 
donations and plasma pools for specific markers of 
infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing 
steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite 
this, when medicinal products prepared from human 
blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of 
transmitting infective agents cannot be totally 
excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging 
viruses and other pathogens. The measures taken are 
considered effective for enveloped viruses such as 
HIV, HBV and HCV, and for the non-enveloped virus 
HAV. The measures taken may be of limited value 
against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus 
B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for 
pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals 
with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis 
(e.g. haemolytic anaemia). Appropriate vaccination 
(hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients 
in regular/repeated receipt of human plasma-derived 
products. It is strongly recommended that every time 
that Voncento is administered to a patient, the name 
and batch number of the product are recorded in 
order to maintain a link between the patient and the 
batch of the product.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications. 
The applicant submitted version 3.0 of the RMP implementing the changes proposed by the PRAC: 
•  Amendment to the post-marketing safety and efficacy study in VWD anticipating to enrol at least (and 
not  ‘approximately’)  20  patients  that  have  not  yet  been  included  in  any  of  the  studies  with 
Voncento/Biostate  before.  Following  the  opinion  by  the  CHMP,  the  applicant  will  submit  full  study 
protocols for the PMSs in haemophilia A and in VWD (to be submitted by 31 August 2013), which also 
will be included in the next update of the RMP.  
•  Amendments  to  the  targeted  questionnaires  on  Inhibitor  development,  Embolic  and  thrombotic 
events,  Transmission  of  infectious  agents.  These  questionnaires  will  be  agreed  upon  with  the 
Regulatory Authorities before launch in the EU. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice with further changes requested for the next revision of the RMP in order 
to reflect the therapeutic indications, as agreed by CHMP. These changes concerned the following 
elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
Safety concerns and proposed Pharmacovigilance Activities; Risk Minimisation measures; Data in 
paediatric patients < 12 years. 
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: 
Following consultation with the BPWP on the requirements for inclusion of children < 12 years in the 
post-marketing studies for both indications: 
•  A two-step approach is recommended for the requirements for paediatric data in VWD patients. 
The first-step is the submission and evaluation of the final clinical study report 
(CSLCT-BIO-08-52) investigating 8 paediatric patients < 12 years in 2014. Once these data are 
available and provided the evaluation is positive, the post-marketing study >12 years 
(CSLCT-BIO-12-83) should be opened to allow enrolment of patients < 12 years. The company’s 
agreement to this strategy should be reflected in the Risk Management Plan. (The current VWF 
products on the market are plasma-derived and, therefore, the fact that this is a plasma-derived 
product does not create the difficulties in recruitment of children seen with plasma-derived FVIII 
products.)” 
•  Regarding haemophilia A:“… the company should make efforts to collect more data in order to get 
closer to the guideline recommendation and, therefore, the data from the on-going paediatric 
study should be supplemented with paediatric data collected in the post-authorisation phase, 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 84/91 
 
 
 
  
  
following the same step-wise approach as described above for VWD. Therefore, once the data are 
available from paediatric study (CSLCT-BIO-08-53) and provided the evaluation is positive, the 
post-marketing study >12 years (CSLCT-BIO-12-78) should be opened to allow enrolment of 
patients < 12 years. The company’s agreement to this strategy should be reflected in the Risk 
Management Plan. In this context, it was noted that while data in immune tolerance induction 
(ITI) is also of interest, it will not contribute to the evaluation of immunogenicity, which is the 
main purpose of the post-authorisation study recommended in the FVIII guideline.” 
It is noted that the applicant agreed to open the patient enrolment to patients < 12 years in the 
post-marketing studies for haemophilia A and VWD as requested by CHMP. The applicant further agreed 
to implement this in the full PMS study protocols for both indications (to be submitted by 31 August 2013) 
which, as stated above, will also be included in the next update of the RMP. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Von Willebrand Disease 
In the pivotal Study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 efficacy in the on-demand treatment of non-surgical bleeds, 
studied in 20 subjects for 12 months, was reported by the investigator as being excellent in 371/405 
(91.6%) of the bleeds, good in 27/405 (6.7%) and moderate in 7/405 (1,7%). These bleeds included 7 
major mucosal bleeds as required by the relevant CHMP guideline. The subject’s assessment of 
hemostatic efficacy per day of bleeding event on all bleeding days was excellent in 476/602 (79.1%), 
good in 104/602 (17.3%), moderate in 21/602 (3.5%).  
In Study CSLCT-BIO-03-97, Biostate was used in 10 major surgeries in 9 patients and in 15 minor 
surgeries in 11 patients.  In those surgeries, where hemostatic efficacy was reported, efficacy was rated 
on day 1 as excellent in 10/11 of the minor surgeries and in 8/10 of the major surgeries, and as good in 
the other 2 major surgeries and 1 minor surgery. 
Hemophilia A 
In the pivotal Study CSLCT-BIO-07-47, in the prophylaxis subgroup, the mean (± s.d) number of bleeds 
overall was 3.5 ± 4.7 (n = 29). In the prevention subgroup, the mean (± s.d)  number of bleeds overall 
was 10.7  ± 10.3 (n = 51). Eleven subjects  in the  prophylaxis subgroup and 6 subjects in the prevention 
subgroup had no bleeding events during the study. The median number of bleeds per month in the first 
month was 0 in the prophylaxis sub-group (range 0 to 5) and 1 in the prevention sub-group (range 0 to 
8) and values were almost the same in the following months. 
There was an Investigator’s assessment of hemostatic efficacy assessment in 656 of  the 667 reported 
bleeding events which was excellent in 396/656 (60.4%); good in 236/656 (36.0%); moderate in 
23/656(3.5%). The pattern of efficacy was similar in the prophylaxis and prevention subgroups. 
A total of 37 surgical procedures, of which 12 were major were performed in 20 subjects of the efficacy 
population. 10 major surgeries in 10 subjects and 10 minor surgeries in 3 subjects fulfilled the 
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 85/91 
 
  
  
requirements of the previous and current FVIII guidelines. At discharge, the Investigator assessed the 
hemostatic efficacy for 2 of the major surgical events as good and for the remaining major and minor 
surgical events as excellent. 
Because high purity plasma derived FVIII or recombinant FVIII concentrates are readily available, 
products containing a large amount of VWF are not routinely used in patients with hemophilia A and are 
of limited relevance in standard treatment.  
However, there may be a place for FVIII concentrates containing VWF in immune tolerance induction (ITI) 
regimens and for use in this clinical situation it is relevant that efficacy in hemophilia A patients has been 
demonstrated. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
There are minimal paediatric data in patients with Von Willebrand Disease and Hemophilia A. 
The CHMP agreed on the requirements for a stepwise inclusion of children in the post-marketing studies 
for both indications: 
The submission and evaluation of the final clinical study report (CSLCT-BIO-08-52) investigating 8 
paediatric patients < 12 years is planned for 2014 – also as part of the ongoing PIP. Once these data are 
available and provided the evaluation is positive, the post-marketing study >12 years 
(CSLCT-BIO-12-83) will be opened to allow enrolment of patients < 12 years.  
The applicant will follow the same step-wise approach for Hemophilia A as described above for VWD. 
Therefore, once the data are available from paediatric study (CSLCT-BIO-08-53) and provided the 
evaluation is positive, the post-marketing study >12 years (CSLCT-BIO-12-78) will be opened to allow 
enrolment of patients < 12 years.  
This strategy will be reflected in the Risk Management Plan. In this context, it was noted that while data 
in immune tolerance induction (ITI) is also of interest, it will not contribute to the evaluation of 
immunogenicity, which is the main purpose of the post-authorisation study recommended in the FVIII 
guideline. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No major risks were seen or unexpected AE’s reported. Most AEs were mild-moderate. The incidence of 
SAEs reported is low and the type of AE might be as expected for this product. The most common AEs 
reported that were related to Voncento, were: headache, arthralgia, back pain and nausea. Across all 
studies AEs that were reported more than 3 times were: headache, back pain and palpitations.  
The high levels of FVIII seen in surgery study CSLCT-BIO-03-97 carry a risk of thrombosis and one case 
of thrombophlebitis was seen in a patient with a FVIII:C > 200% in that study. However, this is a 
recognized risk of treatment of VWD patients with products containing both FVIII and VWF, especially 
during surgery and is addressed in the core SPC for VWF concentrates. It can be managed by monitoring 
plasma FVIII levels and if necessary by changing the dosage regimen or by changing to a product with a 
lower FVIII content. 
Two subjects discontinued the medication due to a TEAE (events related to Voncento): one due to 
aggravation of pre-existing FVIII inhibitor (Hemophilia A study CSLCT-BIO-07-47) and the other 
discontinued the study due to recurrent episodes of chest pain, back pain, and anxiety occurring 3-5 
minutes post-infusion. No drug-drug interaction, deaths, thromboembolic events or allergic reaction were 
reported.  
Assessment report  
EMA/404213/2013 
Page 86/91 
 
  
  
No positive FVIII or VWF inhibitor titers occurred during the pivotal VWD studies.  
In the retrospective investigator-led Howman study, 1 subject with Type 3 VWD was reported to have a 
low responding inhibitor that was noted after 4 years of prophylaxis treatment with human coagulation 
FVIII/VWF complex.  
In Study CSLCT-BIO-03-97, very high pre-treatment (trough) levels of FVIII:C were seen in some 
patients with in 2 cases levels above the reference upper limit of 200%. These were trough levels from 
plasma samples taken just before the following dose in patients who had had earlier dose(s).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Despite the existence of a local and regional Safety Officer network to facilitate the reporting of AEs, in 
developing regions where Voncento is marketed, such as south east Asia and Latin America, there is 
apparently real underreporting of AE’s from these regions which should be addressed by the Applicant. 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions is addressed in the SmPC (see section 4.8) 
There are insufficient data on unfavourable effects in paediatric patients (see SmPC section 4.8). 
However, although the safety of human coagulation FVIII/VWF complex has not been systematically 
evaluated in children yet, currently available clinical experience (including the Howman study) and 
post-marketing information suggest no apparent differences in children compared to adults.  
While donor screening and the manufacturing processes used for purification of factor VIII products have 
improved significantly over the last 20 years, it is still not possible to guarantee total safety of 
plasma-derived products and this is reflected in the SmPC and PIL. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
For both indications, the reported degree of efficacy in hemostasis in the treatment of bleeding events and 
in relation to surgery is adequate and comparable to that reported for other plasma derived VWF and 
FVIII concentrates in the treatment of severe VWD and hemophilia A. 
There were few adverse events reported as being possibly related to Voncento and no reports of 
development of inhibiting antibodies in the pivotal studies. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Voncento was effective in inducing hemostasis in bleeding events in patients with severe VWD and in 
preventing the occurrence of bleeding events in patients with severe hemophilia A. When bleeding events 
did occur in hemophilia A patients on prophylaxis, Voncento was effective in treating these events. 
Voncento was also effective in the prevention and treatment of bleeding in relation to surgery. Only mild 
to moderate adverse events were observed which were not of significance in comparison to the efficacy in 
the treatment and prevention of bleeding events. The benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
There were concerns about the GCP compliance in the pivotal study submitted by the Applicant to support 
the efficacy of Voncento in the on-demand treatment of bleeds in VWD as a result of the findings of the 
EMA GCP inspection. The two sites inspected had also included a significant number of subjects in the 
hemophilia A study, however the audit commissioned by the applicant was able to address and correct a 
number of issues and overall the integrity of the data for both studies was found not to be compromised.

Although the efficacy is considered established, the size of the database in the on-demand treatment of 
bleeds in VWD in the pivotal study CSLCT-BIO-08-54 was small. The Applicant will perform 
post-marketing studies in both VWD and hemophilia A to provide additional efficacy and safety data. The 
proposed study in subjects with severe VWD is similar to the pre-authorisation study CSLCT-BIO-08-54. 
The proposed study in subjects with severe hemophilia A includes 100 adult or adolescent subjects. 
Post-marketing studies which will be critically evaluated regarding GCP compliance.  
At present there are insufficient data on pediatric patients <12 years old for either indication and this is 
reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Paediatric studies are ongoing with the study reports expected in 
Q1/Q2 of 2014.  Upon completion, the inclusion of paediatric patients < 12 years old in the 
post-marketing studies CSLCT-BIO-12-83 and  CSLCT-BIO-12-78 is foreseen and will be reflected in the 
next update of the RMP. 
The CHMP taking into account that this is in principle a conventional plasma-derived product with 
documented quality, pharmacokinetics and efficacy/safety and post marketing experience decided that 
there is no basis for an age restriction in both indications.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Voncento in the treatment of haemorrhage or prevention and treatment of 
surgical bleeding in patients with Von Willebrand Disease (VWD), when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment 
alone is ineffective or contraindicated, and in the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding in patients with 
haemophilia A is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation 
subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal products subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
• 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit 
periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of 
Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
• 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP.

When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted at the same 
time. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency. 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to 
be implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (P/107/2011) and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

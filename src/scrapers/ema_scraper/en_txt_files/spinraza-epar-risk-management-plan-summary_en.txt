PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
FOR SPINRAZA (NUSINERSEN) 
The  European  (EU)  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  details  important  risks  of  SPINRAZA™ 
(nusinersen),  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about  the  uncertainties  (missing 
information) of administration of SPINRAZA to specific populations. 
The SPINRAZA Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how SPINRAZA should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for SPINRAZA should be read in the context of all available relevant 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new safety concerns or changes to the current described safety concerns will be included 
in updates of the EU RMP for SPINRAZA.  
VI: 1 
The medicine and what it is used for 
SPINRAZA is authorised for the treatment of 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy (see SmPC for the full 
indication).  It  contains  nusinersen  as  the  active  substance,  and  it  is  given  by  intrathecal 
administration by lumbar puncture. 
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of SPINRAZA can be found in the EPAR 
for SPINRAZA, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency website, under the medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spinraza 
VI: 2  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of SPINRAZA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about the risks of SPINRAZA, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals, 
respectively; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; and 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of SPINRAZA is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
VI: 2.1  List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of SPINRAZA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be categorised as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of SPINRAZA. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term 
use of the medicine):

Summary of important risks 
This section presents a summary of important potential risks and missing information. 
Important Potential Risk: Thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities are categorised as an 
important potential risk based on class effects data with other ASO 
treatments. 
Risk factors and risk groups  No specific risk factors or at-risk groups for the development of 
thrombocytopenia or coagulation abnormalities have been identified in 
patients receiving nusinersen.

Important Potential Risk: Renal toxicity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Renal toxicity is categorised as an important potential risk based on class 
effects data with other ASO treatments. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
In general, drug-induced renal toxicity is more common amongst certain 
patients and in specific clinical situations. Patient-related risk factors for 
drug-induced renal toxicity applicable to the indicated patient population 
are underlying renal insufficiency (e.g., glomerular filtration rate of less 
than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m2), volume depletion, diabetes, heart 
failure, and sepsis (Naughton 2008). 
No specific risk factors for the development of renal toxicity have been 
identified in patients receiving nusinersen. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
•  Information in SmPC Section 4.4 and PL Section 2. 
Additional risk minimisation measures:

See Section VI: 2.3 of this summary for an overview of the post-
authorisation development plan. 
 
 
 Important Potential Risk: Hydrocephalus 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
No events of hydrocephalus have been reported in the nusinersen clinical 
development programme or in nonclinical studies; however, based on 
the identification of 2 events of hydrocephalus in 2 patients in the post-
marketing setting, a subsequent analysis of all available data (including 
published literature) was performed. Subsequently, whilst a causal 
association between the development of hydrocephalus and exposure to 
nusinersen treatment by lumbar puncture could not be established; on the 
basis of the intrathecal mode of administration (which has been 
attributed to transient drug-induced inflammation and associated with 
chemical meningitis) and the sparse information on post-marketing 
reports received to date, a causal association to nusinersen could not be 
completely excluded. Therefore, hydrocephalus is considered to be an 
important potential risk of nusinersen treatment until such time further 
meaningful data can be obtained. 
Risk factors and risk groups  No specific risk factors for the development of hydrocephalus have been 
identified in patients receiving nusinersen.

Post-authorisation development plan 
VI: 2.3.1  Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
The following studies are conditions of the marketing authorisation: 
  Study ISIS 396443-CS11 (SHINE): An open-label extension study for patients with 
SMA who previously participated in investigational studies of ISIS 396443 
(nusinersen). 
  Purpose of the study: The primary purpose of this study is to gather additional 
information on the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of repeated 12 mg 
doses of nusinersen administered as intrathecal injections by lumbar puncture in 
subjects with SMA who previously participated in investigational studies of ISIS 
396443. 
  Study 232SM201 (NURTURE): An open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of ISIS 396443 delivered 
intrathecally to subjects with genetically diagnosed and presymptomatic SMA. 
  Purpose of the study: The primary purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy 
of repeated doses of nusinersen administered as intrathecal injections in 
preventing or delaying the need for respiratory intervention or death in infants 
with genetically diagnosed and presymptomatic SMA. 
VI: 2.3.2  Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
Other studies in the post authorisation development plan are as follows: 
  Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) United States (US) Neuromuscular 
Disease Registry: This is a prospective longitudinal registry designed to collect data 
 
in four disease areas — amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, SMA, Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy.   
  Purpose of the study: To accelerate translational research to improve clinical care 
and patient outcomes by gaining a better understanding of the course of illness for 
specific neuromuscular diseases.. 
  International SMA Consortium (ISMAC) natural history study: This is a 
longitudinal natural history study of SMA patients with the 3 regional networks that 
comprise the ISMAC (led by: Dr. Francesco Muntoni at Great Ormond Street 
Hospital in the UK, Dr. Eugenio Mercuri at Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in 
Italy, and Dr. Richard Finkel at Nemours Children’s Health System in the US).

provide context to understand the safety and effectiveness of new treatments, and 
support post-marketing surveillance for those new treatments.

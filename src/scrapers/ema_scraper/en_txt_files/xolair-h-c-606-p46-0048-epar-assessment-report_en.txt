Introduction 
On 21 Sept 2015, the MAH submitted a report for a completed paediatric study (CIGE025BIN01) 
for Xolair, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A clinical overview has been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that CIGE025BIN01 is stand alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the 
study<ies> 
Xolair, as approved in India was used in this study.  
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
Study CIGE025BIN01 was an open-label, non-comparative, clinical decision based post marketing 
surveillance study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in IgE mediated asthma in 
paediatric patients. This study was conducted at one centre in India and planned to enrol male and 
female patients ≥6 - ≤18 years of age. The trial was terminated early due to very slow patient 
accrual and logistic reasons. The last patient last visit occurred on 10-May-2014. 
1.3.2.  Clinical study CIGE025BIN01 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in IgE mediated 
asthma in paediatric patients. 
Primary objectives 
•  Evaluation of clinically significant asthma exacerbations in paediatric patients with severe 
persistent allergic asthma at the end of 16 weeks. Clinically significant asthma exacerbations was 
defined as  
o  Worsening of asthma symptoms requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids meeting at 
least one criteria: 
  2 out of 3 consecutive night awakening 
  ≥20% drop in peak expiratory flow (PEF) in 2 out of 3 days 
  >50% increase in use of rescue medication in 2 out of 3 days

Secondary objectives 
•  Reduction in OCS use in patients at baseline and at week 16 
•  Number of days missed in work or college, at baseline and at week 16 
•  Use of other asthma maintenance medication / rescue medication at baseline and at week 16 
•  Worsening of asthma symptoms at week 16, i.e. hospitalization, emergency room visits and 
unscheduled doctor visits. 
• 
Improvement in Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQOLQ). (all visits) 
•  Safety parameters along with serious adverse events. (all visits) 
•  Global assessment by physicians and patients conducted at week 16. 
Study design 
This study was planned to include male and females, 6 - 18 years old with inadequately controlled 
moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma (GINA stage IV) with a patient follow up after study 
entry of 16 weeks. However, the study was implemented at only 1 of 10 planned practices across 
India, with an enrolment goal of 50 patients and was terminated prematurely.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 6 patients (5 males, 1 female) were enrolled in this trial. These patients were between 
the ages of 6-13 (mean age 10 years). All 6 patients completed the 16 week study period. 
Efficacy results 
None of the children had clinically significant asthma exacerbations during the study period.  
A responder was defined as a patient meeting any one of the criteria listed below. Based on these 
criteria all 6 had a response to therapy.

CHMP comment: 
It is somewhat unclear what the primary objective of this study is as the compiled responder 
analysis presented above was not listed among the objectives. The inclusion criteria included a 
history of > 2 exacerbations during the previous year and the evaluation period in the study was 
16 weeks. Thus the study was too short to allow conclusion on reduced number of exacerbations 
even if it appears convincing that no such episode was recorded for any of the six enrolled patients.   
Safety results 
The evaluation for safety and tolerability included all patients who are exposed to omalizumab 
therapy, during course of this survey. Safety assessment was carried out first follow-up visit 
onwards up to the end of all the study visits. Proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event 
and a list of these experienced adverse events, serious or non-serious are described in terms of 
their frequency, percentage for each event (the basis of percentage being the number of patients 
who provided data) and the number of missing data. 
No AEs were reported. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The study was planned to recruit 50 children in 10 centres but ended up with only one centre and 6 
recruited patients before it was prematurely ended. The study is not found conclusive, partly 
because of the low number of patients, partly as the evaluation period is short. Nevertheless, no 
unexpected findings noted. The performance of Xolair was as expected with no recorded adverse 
events.  
2.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The study report has been provided as requested according to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. There were no unexpected findings.  
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Astellas  has  performed  studies  for  investigational  cream  and  gel  formulations  of  tacrolimus  for 
use  in  treatment  of  patients  with  atopic  dermatitis.  The  results  from  these  studies  suggested 
minimal  systemic  absorption  of  tacrolimus  and  a  safety  profile  similar  to  that  seen  with  the 
currently registered tacrolimus ointment.  
Astellas has also performed studies with investigational cream and gel formulations of tacrolimus 
for  use  in  treatment  of  patients  with  psoriasis.  Studies  suggest  minimal  absorption,  lower  than 
levels  seen  with  atopic  dermatitis.  The  most  common  adverse  events  were  application  site 
reactions. There was a greater incidence of some application site reactions in the active group 
compared with the vehicle group, but the differences were small. 
Cancer  was  diagnosed  in  10  patients  treated  with  tacrolimus  cream  0.1%,  of  which  8  patients 
were from the long-term, open label study with the cream formulation, and 1 patient treated with 
cream  vehicle.  Of  the  patients  in  the  tacrolimus  cream  0.1%  group,  4  of  the  patients  had  a 
history  of  cutaneous  malignancies  or  precancerous  lesions,  1  had  evidence  of  the  cutaneous 
tumour prior to starting study drug, and 1 patient had a history of lung cancer. 
The seven of 658 patients, diagnosed with a malignancy during the long term study included 2 
basal cell carcinomas (68 and 73 years), 1 basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma 
(79  years),  1  lentigo  maligna  (65  years),  1  keratoacanthoma  (53  years),  1  squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the cervix (32 years), and 1 recurrence of lung cancer that had metastasised (57 
years).  The  MAH  notes  that  several  studies  have  shown  that  psoriasis  patients  have  an 
increased  risk  of  developing  cancer,  overall  as  well  as  specific  types  such  as  non-melanoma 
skin  cancer  (NMSC)  which  primarily  includes  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  basal  cell 
carcinoma.  
In this report there is also information from three long term (1 year) open label Canadian studies 
with  topical  applied  tacrolimus  in  paediatric  patients  with  atopic  dermatitis  where  the  safety 
profile was consistent with the known safety profile of the licensed product. 
Overall  the  information  provided  is  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  tacrolimus 
ointment in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis. Protopic® 0.03 % is licensed for use 
in adults and children over the age of 2 years. Protopic® 0.1 % is licensed for use in adults and 
adolescents (16 years of age and above).

INTRODUCTION 
The  MAH  has  submitted  several  completed  paediatric  studies  with  topical  tacrolimus,  in 
accordance  with  Article  45  of  the  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  as  amended  on  medicinal 
products for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The  safety  profile  for  cream  and  gel  formulations  was  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  of 
tacrolimus  ointment  in  adults  and  children.  The  most  common  adverse  events  for  all  topical 
applications were local application site reactions including burning or stinging. 
Ongoing registry studies and signal detection programs continue to monitor the long-term safety 
of  tacrolimus  ointment  and  no  additional  safety  concerns  have  been  identified  in  the  above 
described  studies.  Based  on  these  data,  the  MAH  believes  that  no  changes  to  the  current 
Protopic® Product Information are required. 
The  MAH  states  that  the  submitted  paediatric  studies  do  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for 
Protopic® and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

Clinical studies 
Astellas developed and evaluated several topical formulations with tacrolimus for the treatment 
of atopic dermatitis as well as for the treatment of psoriasis. Tacrolimus cream was developed to 
treat body surfaces that could benefit from treatment with a cream formulation. While ointments 
are  best  used  on  dry,  scaly  and  fissured  skin,  creams  are  preferable  on  the  face  (also  from  a 
cosmetic point of view), hairy areas and intertriginous areas. 
Tacrolimus cream as well as tacrolimus gel were also developed and evaluated in patients with 
psoriasis, another inflammatory skin disease. 
Cream formulation for Atopic Dermatitis 
In  Study  03-0-166,  the  success  rate  at  the  end  of  treatment  for  the  tacrolimus  cream  0.03% 
treatment  group  (71/190;  37.4%)  was  statistically  significant  (P<  0.001)  compared  with  cream 
vehicle (23/187; 12.3%). Success was defined as a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on a 6-
point Physician’s Static Global Assessment (PSGA). 
In  Study  03-0-183,  the  success  rate  at  the  end  of  treatment  for  the  tacrolimus  cream  0.03% 
treatment  group  was  28.6%  (54/189)  compared  to  21.1%  (41/194)  for  the  cream  vehicle 
treatment  group;  a  statistical  difference  was  not  observed  (P=0.070).  After  controlling  for 
differences  observed  in  baseline  characteristics  between  treatment  groups,  tacrolimus  cream 
0.03%  was  statistically  significantly  more  effective  (P=0.032)  than  cream  vehicle  in  treating 
atopic dermatitis. 
The  collective  results  of  pharmacokinetic  studies  of  tacrolimus  cream  suggest  that  systemic 
absorption  of  tacrolimus  is  minimal  after  twice-daily  application  of  tacrolimus  cream  0.03%  in 
adults and paediatrics with atopic dermatitis affecting ≥ 35% body surface area (BSA).

Safety 
The safety profile, in subjects with atopic dermatitis, observed with tacrolimus cream 0.03% was 
consistent with that of tacrolimus ointment. 
Study 02-0-150 
In Study 02-0-150, tacrolimus cream was well tolerated in both treatment groups (0.03% and 
0.01%) regardless of age. There were no deaths or serious/unexpected adverse events during 
the study and all 18 of the paediatric patients who were enrolled, completed the study. 
A commonly experienced application site treatment-emergent adverse event was a mild 
sensation of skin burning. However, all such cases were short in duration and resolved with 
continued use. No other application area adverse events were reported. There were no clinically 
significant changes from baseline for routine clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, or 
physical examinations.

Study 03-0-166 
In Study 03-0-166, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar 
between the cream vehicle and tacrolimus cream 0.03% treatment groups (57.2% and 61.6%, 
respectively). The incidence of the most common treatment-emergent adverse event, application 
site burning, was similar in the cream vehicle and the tacrolimus cream treatment arms (33.7% 
vs. 29.5%, respectively). The incidence of treatment-emergent application site burning, 
application site pruritus, application site pain, and application site dryness was similar in subjects 
who received cream vehicle compared to subjects who received tacrolimus cream 0.03%. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events that were considered by the investigators 
to be at least possibly related to study drug, serious adverse events, and adverse events that led 
to discontinuation from the study were similar in the cream vehicle and tacrolimus cream 0.03% 
treatment groups (42.8% and 41.1%; 0.5% and 0.5%; and 8.0% and 4.7%, respectively). There 
were no deaths reported during this study. 
Lymphadenopathy was experienced by 3.7% of subjects in the cream vehicle group and 2.6% of 
subjects in the tacrolimus cream 0.03% treatment groups. No adverse events of lymphoma, skin 
cancer, or cancer were reported during the study. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events of infection and infestation that occurred 
during the study was similar in subjects who received cream vehicle (15.5%) compared to 
subjects who received tacrolimus cream 0.03% (13.7%). 
Overall, there were no clinically significant mean changes from baseline in laboratory values 
or vital signs measurements observed during the study. One subject discontinued from the study 
due to adverse events related to clinical laboratory findings. 
Study 03-0-183 
During Study 03-0-183, the overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar 
in the cream vehicle and the tacrolimus cream 0.03% treatment groups (60.3% and 59.3%, 
respectively). The incidence of the most common treatment-emergent adverse event, application 
site burning, was also similar in the cream vehicle and tacrolimus cream 0.03% treatment groups 
(22.7% and 25.4%, respectively). The incidence of treatment-emergent application site burning, 
application site pruritus, application site pain, and application site dryness was similar in subjects 
who received cream vehicle compared to subjects who received tacrolimus cream 0.03%. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events that were considered by the investigators 
to have at least a possible relationship to study drug, serious adverse events, and adverse 
events that led to discontinuation from the study were similar between the cream vehicle and the 
tacrolimus cream 0.03% treatment groups (38.7% and 37.0%; 1.0% and 0.5%; and 6.7% and 
3.2%, respectively). 
Lymphadenopathy was experienced by 2.1% of subjects in the cream vehicle treatment group 
and 3.2% of subjects in the tacrolimus cream 0.03% treatment group. Lymphadenopathy 
resolved with no residual effects in all but 2 subjects in the tacrolimus cream 0.03% treatment 
group. No adverse events of lymphoma, skin cancer, or cancer were reported during the study. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events of infection and infestation that occurred 
during the study was similar in subjects who received cream vehicle (15.5%) compared to 
subjects who received tacrolimus cream 0.03% (16.4%). 
Overall, there were no clinically significant mean changes from baseline in laboratory values or 
vital signs measurements observed during the study. No subjects discontinued from the study 
due to adverse events related to clinical laboratory findings or due to vital signs measurements. 
Cream Formulation for the Treatment of Psoriasis 
The clinical development program for tacrolimus cream for the treatment of patients with plaque 
psoriasis consisted of 3 studies pertinent to demonstrate efficacy for the claimed indication, 1

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

long-term safety study; 4 pharmacokinetic studies; 1 active-controlled study; and 13 local 
tolerance studies. Two phase III safety and efficacy studies, 1 long-term safety study, 2 
pharmacokinetic studies, and 4 local tolerance studies were conducted with a tacrolimus cream 
formulation (this cream formulation B was dissimilar to the cream G used for the AD studies and 
displayed a longer shelf life), as described below. Studies in adults are also described here to 
provide a full overview of the development program. The paediatric study reports were 04-0-205, 
04-0-206 and 04-0-207  
The systemic bioavailability of tacrolimus cream in patients with psoriasis is consistently low and 
has been shown to be lower than in patients with atopic dermatitis who have received other 
topical tacrolimus formulations. 
Safety 
Overall, the incidence of adverse events in patients with psoriasis treated with tacrolimus cream 
0.1% was low and similar to that observed in vehicle-treated patients. There were no clinically 
significant differences between adverse events in the vehicle arm vs. the tacrolimus cream 0.1% 
arm. The most common adverse events were application site reactions. There was a greater 
incidence of some application site reactions in the active group compared with the vehicle group, 
but the differences were small. In the pooled data set of Studies 04-0-205 and 04-0-206, the 
adverse event profile between patients with extensive BSA involvement was similar to that in 
patients with minimal BSA involvement. 
The adverse event profile for patients treated with tacrolimus cream 0.1% long-term was similar 
to that observed in the shorter-term, 12-week studies. 
Cancer was diagnosed in 10 patients treated with tacrolimus cream 0.1%, of which 8 patients 
were from the long-term, open label study, and 1 patient treated with cream vehicle. Of the 
patients in the tacrolimus cream 0.1% group, 4 of the patients had a history of cutaneous 
malignancies or precancerous lesions, 1 had evidence of the cutaneous tumour prior to starting 
study drug, and 1 patient had a history of lung cancer.

Several studies have shown that psoriasis patients have an increased risk of developing cancer, 
overall as well as specific types such as non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) which primarily 
includes squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. Long-term follow-up studies 
conducted among psoriasis patients have shown an increased overall cancer risk, with 
standardised incidence ratios up to 4 for NMSC when comparing the observed to the expected 
incidence within the general population [Boffetta et al, 2001; Hannuksela-Svahn et al, 2000; 
Frentz & Olsen, 1999]. A previous NMSC diagnosis among psoriasis patients may be associated 
with developing a second NMSC, with 1 meta-analysis of 17 studies calculating a 3-year 
cumulative risk of 18% for squamous cell carcinoma and 44% for basal cell carcinoma [Marcil & 
Stern, 2000]. In addition, some of the earlier treatments for psoriasis such as psoralen plus 
ultraviolet A (PUVA) have been linked to an increase in the risk of initial and recurrent NMSC 
even after prolonged discontinuation of high cumulative dosed treatments [Katz et al, 2002, 
Nijsten & Stern, 2003]. 
The overall incidence of infections was low and in the vehicle-controlled studies the incidence 
was similar between treatment groups. 
Gel Formulation for the Treatment of Psoriasis 
Two formulations, original gel and gel-3, were evaluated during the development of tacrolimus 
gel. The formulation known as gel-3 was the planned to-be-marketed formulation and was 
utilised in the phase III studies. 
The clinical development program for tacrolimus gel for the gel-3 formulation consisted of 4 
efficacy and safety studies, 1 long-term safety study and 1 pharmacokinetic study, as described 
in Table 6. Additionally, local tolerance studies in healthy volunteers were conducted including 1 
cumulative irritation study, 1 contact sensitisation study, 1 phototoxicity study, and 1 
photocontact allergy study. 
Efficacy 
The end of treatment in four of the tacrolimus gel treatment groups (tacrolimus gel 0.1% qd, 
0.3% qd, 0.1% bid, and 0.3% bid) compared with the gel vehicle group. Success was defined as 
a score of 0 (“clear”) or 1 (“almost clear”) based on the PSGA. 
In Study 03-0-170, the success rate at the end of treatment, stratified by center, for the 
tacrolimus gel 0.3% treatment group was statistically significant (P=0.007) compared to gel 
vehicle. Success was defined as a score of 0 (“clear”) or 1 (“almost clear”) based on the PSGA. 
In Study 03-0-169, the success rate at the end of treatment for the gel vehicle treatment group 
was 10.6% compared to 15.2% for the tacrolimus gel 0.3% treatment group (P=0.167); a 
statistical difference was not observed. Success was defined as a score of 0 (“clear”) or 1 
(“almost clear”) based on the PSGA. 
Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability 
The majority of subjects treated with tacrolimus gel 0.3% in vehicle-controlled studies who had 
blood samples collected during treatment had tacrolimus blood concentrations < 1.0 ng/mL; 
95.1% of subjects in Study 01-0-126, 88.5% of subjects in Study 03-0-169 and 90.6% of 
subjects in Study 03-0-170. For those subjects with quantifiable levels, such concentrations were 
typically isolated events and decreased over treatment time. For most subjects, the 
concentrations were minimal compared with those following oral or intravenous administration.

Safety 
The safety of tacrolimus gel was evaluated in 536 healthy volunteers and 1873 subjects with 
psoriasis, 1546 of who applied tacrolimus gel. Additionally, a total of 591 subjects were enrolled 
in a long-term safety study (03-0-171); the mean duration of treatment was approximately 7.5 
months and the median duration of treatment was approximately 9.5 months. 
In the vehicle-controlled studies, the most common adverse events were application site events 
of burning and pruritus. Application site burning was numerically greater in the tacrolimus gel 
0.3% treatment group compared to gel vehicle in all three studies. The incidence of infections 
was comparable between treatment groups. The most common application site events reported 
from these studies include burning and itching. There were no significant differences in the 
adverse event rates between tacrolimus gel 0.3% and vehicle-control treated subjects. Overall, 
these adverse events rarely led to discontinuation or study drug interruption. 
In the long-term Study 03-0-171, the most common adverse event was application site burning 
(47.5%). Application site burning generally occurred on the first day of application, and tended to 
be mild to moderate in intensity. Other more common application site reactions included pruritus, 
pain, warmth and dermatitis. Headache was the most common non-application site reaction. No 
deaths were reported. A total of 10 subjects (1.7%) experienced a serious adverse event. None 
of the serious adverse events were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.

There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory values, including renal function, or 
physical examinations, including blood pressure, during treatment. 
The adverse events that occurred in the long-term safety study were consistent with the adverse 
event profile in the 12-week vehicle-controlled studies. These data demonstrate that tacrolimus 
gel 0.3% was safe during the treatment of psoriasis for up to 6 months. 
Long-term Safety Studies of Tacrolimus Ointment for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis 
Three studies were conducted in Canada to evaluate the safety of longer-term (6 months or 
1 year) treatment with topically applied tacrolimus ointment 0.1% in paediatric subjects (2 years 
of age or older) with atopic dermatitis. Studies PRO-002 and PRO-002b enrolled subjects that 
had participated previously in Astellas (formerly Fujisawa)-sponsored studies with tacrolimus 
ointment. 
Study PRO-002 was a long-term (1-year), open-label, non-comparative study. A total of 
43 subjects received at least one dose of study medication. The most frequently reported 
adverse events were application site reactions (25.0%), allergies (11.6%) and asthma (9.3%). 
Six subjects (14%) prematurely discontinued the study, 3 due to application site events, 2 due to 
lack of efficacy and 1 subject due to non-compliance. Three subjects required hospitalisation, 
one for pneumonia and two for asthma. None of the application site adverse events were 
considered to be serious. 
Study PRO-002b was a long-term (1-year), open-label, non-comparative study. A total of 
12 subjects received at least one dose of study medication. In Study PRO-002b, non application 
site adverse events were observed in 83% (10/12) of subjects; none of these events were 
considered related to study therapy. The most frequently reported events were respiratory 
system disorders (41.7%) and skin and appendages disorders (41.7%). 
Application site adverse events were observed in 50% (6/12) of the study population; 4 subjects 
experienced itching and 2 subjects experienced burning. No subject was permanently 
discontinued from the study. 
Study PRO-004 was a long-term (1-year), open-label, non-comparative study in patients at 
least 2 years of age with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. A total of 236 subjects received 
at least one dose of study medication. Sixty-five percent (154/236) of subjects were older than 
16 years of age and the rest of these subjects were between 2 and 16 years of age. 
In Study PRO-004, the incidence of non-application site adverse events was 71.6% (169/236). 
The most frequently reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis (21.2%) and headache NOS 
(16.9%). The incidence of application site adverse events was 67.4% (159/236). The most 
frequently reported application site reactions included application site burning (38.1%) and 
application site pruritus (33.9%). Six serious adverse events were reported, 3 of these 6 were 
non-application site and 3 were associated with the application site. Of the 6 serious adverse 
events, only one was considered to have a possible relationship to study medication. 
Other Studies of Tacrolimus Ointment 
Patients with atopic dermatitis often develop involvement of the eyelids. The application of 
topical corticosteroids to areas of thin skin such as the eyelids has been associated with 
increased intraocular pressure as well as local skin thinning. To assess the ability of tacrolimus 
ointment to treat eyelid dermatitis, an open-label, single arm, single centre study was conducted 
(00-0-081) in 21 patients 12 years of age or older with active, moderate to severe, eyelid 
dermatitis. There were no notable changes in ocular pressure from baseline to any study visit or 
to the end of treatment. The most common adverse events were burning sensation (57.1%) and 
itching (23.8%). Three patients discontinued the study due to an application site adverse event 
(2 patients for itching and burning; 1 patient for pain and swelling). There was no skin atrophy,

telangiectasia or striae present on the eyelids of any patient at baseline or at any time during the 
study or at end of treatment. 
The application of corticosteroids to the face and intertriginous areas is associated with local 
skin thinning, telangiectasia and striae. To assess the ability of tacrolimus ointment to treat 
psoriasis on thin-skinned areas, an investigator-initiated, randomized (2:1), double-blind, vehicle-
controlled study (20-02-001) was conducted in 167 patients 16 years of age or older with facial 
and intertriginous psoriasis. Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% or vehicle was applied twice daily to all 
psoriatic lesions of the face or intertriginous areas for 8 weeks. There were no significant 
differences in the incidence of adverse events between treatment groups. 
Adverse events considered by the investigator to be related to study drug treatment and 
observed in more than 2% of the population included burning or stinging (8.0% vs 7.3%), 
hyperaesthesia (4.5% vs. 0), and itching (7.1% vs. 1.8%) in the tacrolimus ointment 0.1% vs. 
vehicle groups, respectively. There were no reports of cutaneous infections or systemic adverse 
events [Lebwohl et al, 2004]. 
V. 
MAH CONCLUSIONS 
Topically-applied tacrolimus has been extensively studied in atopic dermatitis (Protopic® 
ointment, tacrolimus cream formulation) and psoriasis development programs (cream and gel 
formulations). Other post-marketing studies with tacrolimus ointment, including studies in eyelid 
dermatitis and facial and intertriginous psoriasis have also been conducted. 
Approximately 19,000 subjects have been studied in clinical trials using tacrolimus ointment. 
Astellas has studied over 2400 patients with psoriasis in the tacrolimus cream and gel programs. 
The safety profile for the cream and gel formulations was consistent with the safety profile of 
tacrolimus ointment in adults and children. The most common adverse events for all topical 
applications are local application site reactions including burning or stinging. 
Ongoing registry studies with the approved tacrolimus ointment and signal detection programs 
continue to monitor the long-term safety of Protopic® and no additional safety concerns have 
been identified in the above described studies. Based on these data, the MAH believes that no 
changes to the current Protopic® Product Information are required. 
VI. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
Astellas has performed studies for a tacrolimus cream formulation for use in treatment of 
patients with atopic dermatitis. Their studies suggested minimal absorption and a safety profile 
similar to that seen with the currently available ointment.  
Astellas has also performed studies with both a tacrolimus cream and a tacrolimus gel for use in 
treatment of patients with psoriasis. Studies suggest minimal absorption, lower than levels seen 
with atopic dermatitis. The most common adverse events were application site reactions. There 
was a greater incidence of some application site reactions in the active group compared with the 
vehicle group, but the differences were small. 
Cancer was diagnosed in 10 patients treated with tacrolimus cream 0.1%, of which 8 patients 
were from the long-term, open label study with the cream formulation, and 1 patient treated with 
cream vehicle. Of the patients in the tacrolimus cream 0.1% group, 4 of the patients had a 
history of cutaneous malignancies or precancerous lesions, 1 had evidence of the cutaneous 
tumour prior to starting study drug, and 1 patient had a history of lung cancer.

The seven of 658 patients, diagnosed with a malignancy during the long term study included 2 
basal cell carcinomas (68 and 73 years), 1 basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma 
(79 years), 1 lentigo maligna (65 years), 1 keratoacanthoma (53 years), 1 squamous cell 
carcinoma of the cervix (32 years), and 1 recurrence of lung cancer that had metastasised (57 
years). The MAH notes that several studies have shown that psoriasis patients have an 
increased risk of developing cancer, overall as well as specific types such as non-melanoma 
skin cancer (NMSC) which primarily includes squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell 
carcinoma.  
In this report there is also information from three long term (1 year) open label Canadian studies 
with topically applied tacrolimus ointment 0.1 % in paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis 
where the safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of the licensed product. 
Overall  the  information  provided  is  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  Protopic®  in  the 
treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis. Protopic® 0.03 % is licensed for use in adults and 
children over the age of 2 years. Protopic® 0.1 % is licensed for use in adults and adolescents 
(16 years of age and above). 
  Recommendation  
The Rapporteur agrees that no further action required

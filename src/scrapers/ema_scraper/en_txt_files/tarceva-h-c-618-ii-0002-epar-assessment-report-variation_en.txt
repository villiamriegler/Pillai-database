SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1. 
Introduction 
Tarceva (erlotinib) is a human epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (HER1, also known as EGFR) 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  
Tarceva has been authorised in the EU for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, on 19 September 
2005.  The  approval  was  based  on  data  from  Study  BR.21,  a  randomised,  double-blinded, 
placebo-controlled Phase III study of single-agent erlotinib at 150 mg daily versus best supportive care 
in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least 1 prior chemotherapy 
regimen. 
The MAH subsequently applied for the approval of Tarceva (erlotinib hydrochloride) at the following 
indication (as originally proposed): first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable 
or metastatic pancreatic cancer at a recommended daily dose of 100 mg taken at least one hour before 
or  two  hours  after  the  ingestion  of  food,  in  combination  with  the  approved  standard  regimen  of 
gemcitabine. 
Pancreatic  cancer  is  the  sixth  leading  cause  of  cancer  death  in  Europe.  There  are  few  signs  or 
symptoms associated with early stage pancreatic cancer and up to 90% of patients present with locally 
advanced  or  metastatic  disease.  The  5-year  survival  rate  is  less  than  5%  and  of  the  10%  of  patients 
with possibly resectable disease only about 20% will survive for 5 years. Patients have usually only a 
few  months  to  live,  usually  with  a  rapidly  deteriorating  state  of  health.  Besides  cancer  pain  and  the 
distress of suffering from an uncurable and deadly disease the main clinical problems are related to the 
gastrointestinal  tract  like  nausea,  vomiting,  both  constipation  and  diarrhoea,  jaundice,  intestinal 
stenosis  and  often  severe  weight  loss.  For  treatment  purposes  tumours  are  divided  into  resectable, 
locally advanced, unresectable, and metastatic. 
Historically,  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced,  unresectable  pancreatic  cancer  with  5-
fluorouracil  (5-FU)  in  combination  with  radiation  was  shown  to  improve  survival  over  radiotherapy 
alone. However, it is still not clear whether radiation is an essential element of treatment for patients 
with locally advanced disease. 
The  current  standard  and  only  approved  therapy  for  patients  who  have  advanced,  metastatic  or 
unresectable pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine, which offers improvement in survival and amelioration 
of symptoms. In a Phase III randomized (1:1) trial in 126 previously untreated patients with pancreatic 
cancer,  gemcitabine  improved  survival  in  comparison  to  5-FU  by  approximately  4-5  weeks.  In  that 
study, patients who received gemcitabine also reported a greater  effect on disease-related symptoms 
such as pain, performance status (PS), and weight changes than those who received 5-FU.  
Other cytotoxic agents such as cisplatin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin have been studied in this patient 
population  in  randomized  Phase  III  clinical  trials  in  combination  with  gemcitabine,  none  of  the 
combinations has demonstrated a statistically significant survival benefit over gemcitabine alone.   
Despite  the  use  of  chemotherapy,  the  overall  survival  of  patients  with  pancreatic  cancer  remains 
dismal and treatment is palliative.  
3.2.  Clinical aspects 
The clinical development program of erlotinib in pancreatic cancer consists of one large pivotal phase 
III study (study PA.3) including 569 patients.  
Pharmacokinetics of erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine were investigated in a phase Ib study 
(OSI-774-155) including patients with pancreatic cancer or other malignancies (N=26). 
Furthermore  a  phase  1  open-label  study  (OSI-774-103)  has  been  conducted  to  characterize  the 
pharmacokinetics of erlotinib in non-smoking and currently smoking healthy male subjects.  
All studies in the erlotinib clinical development program were performed in concordance with current 
standards for the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical research, including ICH GCP and all region-
specific requirements.

Pharmacokinetics 
Two studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of erlotinib and gemcitabine when administered in 
combination:  the  Phase  Ib  Study  OSI-774-155  and  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  05-0140-
1219 that included data from clinical Study PA.3. The population pharmacokinetic model was based 
on study 04-0143-1219, which was discussed in the original application for Tarceva. 
Study OSI-774-155 
This was an open-label Phase 1b study in patients with advanced solid, mainly pancreatic tumours.  
A total of 26 patients were enrolled and treated. There were 13 males and 13 females, with a median 
age  of  63  (range  29  to  82).  All  but  2  patients  were  Caucasian.  At  study  entry,  patients  had  KPS 
reported at 100% (7 patients), 90% (8 patients), and 80% (11 patients). Per the protocol, the primary 
diagnosis  in  the  majority  of  patients  (15  of  26  patients)  was  pancreatic  carcinoma;  in  addition  there 
were 2 patients with breast carcinoma, 2 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma, and single cases 
of bladder, colon, gastric, prostate, renal, thyroid, and cholangiocarcinoma. A standard dose escalation 
scheme was used to determine the safety and tolerability of 100 and 150 mg doses of oral erlotinib, 
administered daily, with gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 30 minute IV infusion administered weekly x 7, 
with 1 week off (Cycle 1), followed by weekly x 3 with 1 week off (subsequent cycles). 
Results  from  this  study  indicate  that  erlotinib  does  not  affect  gemcitabine  exposure  in  a  clinically 
significant  manner,  and  vice  versa,  gemcitabine  does  not  affect  erlotinib  pharmacokinetics,  under 
clinically  relevant  conditions.  These  results  are in  line  with  data  from  clinical  studies  BO16411  and 
OSI-774-154,  which  were  discussed  in  the  original  application.  Also  in  these  studies,  no  clinically 
relevant  difference  was  observed  for  erlotinib  in  the  absence  or  presence  of  gemcitabine,  not  for 
gemcitabine in the absence or presence of erlotinib and cisplatin. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 05-0140-1219 
A  population  pharmacokinetics  analysis  was  performed  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetics  of  single-
agent erlotinib with those obtained when erlotinib is used in combination with gemcitabine (combined 
dataset).  The  analysis  included  4  Phase II  studies  and  2  Phase III  studies  with  the  following  PK 
designs: full screen (randomized sampling windows) and multiple troughs. Full screen typically refers 
to designs in which a limited number of samples were collected from each patient, but sampling times 
varied across patients to allow assessment of the full profile in the population 
This  population  pharmacokinetics  analysis  demonstrated  that  the  covariates  affecting  erlotinib 
disposition  in  patients  from  Study PA.3  were  very  similar  to  those  previously  reported  and  no  new 
covariate  effects  were  identified.  The  covariate  effects  previously  identified  as  affecting  erlotinib 
apparent oral clearance (CL/F) were total bilirubin, α-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), and smoking status. 
The SmPC already includes a recommendation for smokers to stop smoking. Data on smoking history 
were not collected from patients in Study PA.3. 
In  conclusion,  this  population  PK  analysis  demonstrated  that  the  covariates  affecting  erlotinib 
disposition in patients from Study PA.3 were very similar to those previously reported. No additional 
covariate effects were observed. Co-administration of gemcitabine had no effect on erlotinib CL/F.  
The  data  obtained  in  the  present  study  05-0140-1219  can  be  considered  supportive  to  those  derived 
form  the  clinical  studies  OSI-774-155,  BO16411  and  OSI-774-154.  In  all  of  these  studies,  erlotinib 
and  gemcitabine  appeared  not  to  influence  each  other’s  pharmacokinetic  behaviour  in  a  clinically 
relevant manner. 
Pharmacodynamics 
In Study BR.21, which was the pivotal trial in the initial application, tumour samples were evaluated 
for  EGFR  expression  in  31  %  of  erlotinib  treated  patients.  Results  suggested  that  tumoural  EGFR-
expression may be a prognostic biomarker for treatment response to erlotinib. 
Within the pancreatic cancer study PA.3, data regarding EGFR expression status (determined by IHC) 
were  only  available  for  27%  of  the  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  and  for  24%  of  the  patients  in  the 
placebo  arm.  The  number  of  samples  available  was  limited  due  to  the  advanced  stage  of  pancreatic 
cancer at primary diagnosis and the method used for diagnosis, which is usually fine-needle aspiration 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rather than surgery. Patients with a positive EGFR status (≥ 10% staining) in the placebo group had a 
worse  median  survival  (5.32  months)  than  patients  with  EGFR  negative  tumours  (6.11  months), 
suggesting  that  an  EGFR  positive  status  might  be  a  weak  negative  prognostic  factor  for  survival  in 
patients with pancreatic cancer. The survival HRs for patients with a positive EGFR status were very 
similar  to  those  with  a  negative  EGFR  status  (0.79  and  0.80,  respectively),  suggesting  the  survival 
benefit  from  erlotinib  with  gemcitabine  relative  to  gemcitabine  alone  was  not  related  to  EGFR 
expression status. Caution must be taken in the interpretation of these results, however, because of the 
small  number  of  patients  with  known  EGFR  status  and  the  fact  that  this  was  only  designed  as  an 
exploratory analysis. Availability of tissue for determination of EGFR protein expression status was 
not an entry requirement for this study and patients were required to sign a separate consent form to 
allow for their tissue to be used for this analysis.    
Overall, the association between EGFR expression and clinical benefit from erlotinib is still unknown, 
and  the  translational  work  done  in  study  PA.3  also  does  not  clarify  this,  as  only  about  a  fourth  of 
tumour  samples  were  available  for  EGFR  expression,  and  no  correlation  was  found  for  erlotinib 
treatment  and  clinical  benefit.  The  reliability  of  EGFR  expression  assessments  is  influenced  by  the 
homogeneity  of  the  tumour  sample  and  whether  that  tumour  sample  is  indeed  representative  of  the 
tumour as a whole. Additionally, clinical benefit in study PA.3 is a composite of treatment response to 
two purportedly active agents, i.e. gemcitabine and erlotinib, and a possible correlation between EGFR 
expression  and  treatment  response  to  erlotinib  might  be  masked  by gemcitabine-associated  response 
patterns. 
One  phase Ib  study  (OSI-774-155)  has  been  performed  to  determine  the  safety,  tolerance,  and 
preliminary  antineoplastic  activity  of  gemcitabine  administered  in  combination  with  escalating  oral 
doses  of  erlotinib  to  patients  with  recently  diagnosed,  gemcitabine-naïve,  advanced  pancreatic 
carcinoma  or  other  potentially  responsive  malignancies.  There  were  no  significant  effects  of  daily 
erlotinib administration on the pharmacokinetic parameters of gemcitabine and vice versa.  
While  there  was  a  borderline  statistical  significance  for  the  correlation  of  single  dose  erlotinib  Cmax 
with patients’ best response to erlotinib treatment in study 248-004, no correlation has been reported 
for erlotinib or gemcitabine pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC, drug clearance) with treatment 
response  in  the  concurrent  gemcitabine/erlotinib  regimen  studies  PA.3  and  OSI-774-155.  While  the 
concurrent treatment with two purportedly active compounds makes such analyses more burdensome, 
it  could  give  more  insight  into  the  optimal  treatment  schedule  to  eventually  increase  treatment 
response and/or dampen toxicity.  
 Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response study 
No  new  studies  were  required  to  support  this  indication.  Formal  dose-response  studies  of  erlotinib 
were included in the original Marketing Authorisation Application.  
No  data  on  treatment  with  erlotinib  in  combination  with  gemcitabine  in  patients  with  advanced 
pancreatic cancer were available prior to the initiation of the Study PA.3, therefore the starting dose of 
erlotinib for the study was 100 mg and safety was strictly monitored.  
At  the  initiation  of  PA.3,  the  dose-finding  and  safety  study  OSI-774-155  was  in  progress.  OSI-774-
155 looked at two escalating doses of erlotinib (100 mg and 150 mg daily) concurrently with standard-
dosed gemcitabine, concluding 150 mg erlotinib daily could safely be given together with gemcitabine 
in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer or other potentially responsive tumours.  
A  safety  analysis,  blinded  to  treatment  assignment,  of  the  first  16  patients  treated  with 
erlotinib/placebo at 100 mg daily in combination with gemcitabine in study PA.3 was conducted. Due 
to transaminase elevations in 3/16 patients in the combined treatment arms, it was decided to expand 
the 100 mg cohort to up to 50 patients. A safety evaluation of the first 50 patients treated with 100 mg 
erlotinib/placebo concluded that the dose was tolerated. A safety evaluation of 16 patients enrolled at 
selected Canadian centres at the 150 mg erlotinib/placebo dose in combination with gemcitabine also 
concluded that this combination was adequately tolerated to permit further recruitment. At that time, 
however, accrual to the study was so advanced (405 patients) that too few patients entered the 150 mg 
(n=48) cohort for a proper subgroup analysis.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
More “class-specific” adverse events  as seen in the 150 mg erlotinib cohort in PA.3 may also mean 
more  activity,  as  a  correlation  between  TKI-associated  rash  and  treatment  response  has  repeatedly 
been  shown.  Although  the  100  mg  daily  dose  of  erlotinib  led  to  a  statistically  significant  survival 
benefit  in  these  patients,  the  true  optimal  dose  of  erlotinib  if  given  concurrently  with  gemcitabine 
might be higher.    
Main study 
One large randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal phase III study (PA.3) including 569 
patients was submitted to support the claimed indication. Study PA.3 was conducted in patients with 
locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.  
The 569 patients were randomized (1:1) to daily erlotinib or placebo in combination with the standard 
dose (1000 mg/m2) and schedule of gemcitabine. 285 patients were randomised to receive gemcitabine 
with  erlotinib  (261  at  100  mg  dose  and  24  at  150  mg  dose)  and  284  to  receive  gemcitabine  with 
placebo (260 at 100 mg dose and 24 at 150 mg dose).  
Primary Objective:  
•  To compare overall survival rates in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic 
pancreatic cancer treated with erlotinib and gemcitabine or placebo and gemcitabine 
Secondary Objectives: 
•  To compare PFS in this patient group 
•  To compare the effects of these treatments on measures of quality of life in this patient group 
using the EORTC QLQ-C30 
•  To compare response rates in this patient group (CR, PR) 
•  To estimate and compare response duration in this patient group 
•  To compare the nature, severity, and frequency of toxicities between the two arms 
•  To correlate the expression of tissue EGFR levels (at diagnosis) with outcomes and response 
to treatment 
•  To measure trough levels of erlotinib to define population pharmacokinetics 
Primary Outcome: 
The  median  overall  survival  of  the  combined  dose  cohorts,  estimated  from  univariate  Kaplan-Meier 
curves, was 6.37 months (95% CI : [5.85, 7.20]) in the erlotinib arm compared with 5.91 months (95% 
CI : [5.09, 6.67]) in the placebo arm. The mean survival for the erlotinib arm was 8.8 months and for 
the  placebo  arm  was  7.6  months  (absolute  mean  survival  benefit  of  5  weeks).  The  estimated  1-year 
survival  rates  were  23.8%  for  the  erlotinib  arm  and  16.8%  for  the  placebo  arm.  The  median  overall 
survival of the 100 mg dose cohort was 6.47 months compared with 5.95 months, and the estimated 1-
year survival rates were 23.2% and 17.4%, respectively. 
The adjusted HR for death for erlotinib and gemcitabine relative to placebo and gemcitabine estimated 
from the primary analysis was 0.79, 95% (CI 0.66 to 0.95) (p = 0.011) using a Log Rank test including 
the stratification factors as reported at the time of randomization (ECOG PS, extent of disease). When 
the analysis was restricted to patients in the 100 mg cohort, the HR was essentially unchanged, 0.79 
(95%  CI  0.66  to  0.96,  p  =  0.017),  confirming  that  the  main  statistically  significant  effect  was 
maintained at this dose level. The number of patients in the 150 mg dose cohort was too small to draw 
any definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of erlotinib at this dose level. 
ECOG PS 2 and the presence of distant metastases were found to be significant predictors of overall 
survival in the study population, in accordance to what is known in the literature. Subgroup analysis 
did  not  identify  any  erlotinib-exposed  subgroup  with  worse  outcome  as  compared  to  the  respective 
placebo  subgroup.  These  subgroup  analyses  however  were  made  post-hoc,  with  quite  small  patient 
number per subgroup, and the respective results have therefore to be interpreted cautiously. Smoking 
history again has not been assessed in correlation with overall survival, despite its purported influence 
on tumour biology and response to anticancer treatment.

 Survival by Pre-treatment Characteristics – All Patients 
Secondary Outcomes: 
•  Progression-Free Survival 
The  adjusted  HR  for  progression  in  the  erlotinib  arm  relative  to  the  placebo  arm  was  0.77  (95%  CI 
0.64 to 0.92, p = 0.004) using a log rank test including the stratification factors at randomization. For 
the 100 mg dose cohort, the adjusted HR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.93, p = 0.006). 
The median PFS was 3.75 months (95% CI 3.58 to 4.83) in the erlotinib arm and 3.55 months (95% CI 
3.22 to 3.71) in the placebo arm. In the 100 mg dose cohort, the median PFS was 3.81 months (95% 
CI 3.58 to 4.93) and 3.55 months (95% CI 3.29 to 3.75), respectively. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The prolongation of disease-free survival however is 0.2 months or about a theoretical 6 days, which 
cannot  be  seen  as  clinically  meaningful.  ECOG  performance  status  and  distant  metastasis  status  are 
identified as prognostic factors, which is in accordance to what is known from the literature.  
•  Quality of Life 
In  regards  to  quality  of  life,  no  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  between  the  2 
treatment  arms  for  the  change  from  baseline  at  each  assessment  in  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  domains, 
except  for  significantly  more  diarrhoea  in  the  erlotinib  arm.  Overall,  the  addition  of  erlotinib  to 
gemcitabine did not decrease quality of life, except for the fact that, as expected, the QoL category for 
“Diarrhoea”  was  worse  for  the  patients  treated  with  erlotinib.  This  was  consistent  with  what  was 
reported  as  adverse  events  in  the  CRF,  although  the  severity  of  most  diarrhoea  events  was  mild  to 
moderate. 
•  Tumour response 
A  total  of  1 CR  and  22  PRs  were  observed  in  the  erlotinib  arm  and  a  similar  number,  3  CRs  and 
18 PRs, were observed in the placebo arm, for an overall objective response rate of 8.6% (95% CI 5.5 
to 12.6) in the erlotinib arm and 8.0% (95% CI 5.0 to 12.0) in the placebo arm (p = 0.875). In the 100 
mg dose cohort, the objective response rate was also 8.6% (95% CI 5.4 to 12.9) in the erlotinib arm 
and  7.9%  (95%  CI  4.8  to  12.0)  in  the  placebo  arm  (p = 0.869).  The  responses  for  the  patients  with 
measurable disease were durable, as the median response duration was 23.3 weeks in both study arms. 
In the 100 mg dose cohort, the duration was also similar in both arms. Overall, patients with a positive 
EGFR status had lower response rates and response plus SD rates than patients with EGFR negative 
tumours or patients for whom the EGFR status was unknown. Of note, however, since there were only 
a small number of patients in the group who had a known positive or negative status, this resulted in 
very wide confidence intervals. 
•  Duration of response and Duration of stable disease 
No differences in duration of response or stable disease were observed between the 2 treatment arms, 
either in the overall population or in the 100 mg cohort. The overall median duration of the objective 
responses (CR and PR) for the patients in the erlotinib arm was 23.3 weeks (95% CI 16.29 to 29.57), 
ranging from 3.71 to 56.00+ weeks. In the placebo arm, median duration was also 23.3 weeks (95% CI 
16.14 to 32.43), ranging from 6.71+ to 65.29+ weeks.  
Clinical safety  
The pivotal Phase III Study PA.3 together with a Phase Ib dose-escalation study (Study OSI-774-155) 
form  the  basis  for  the  safety  evaluation  of  erlotinib  given  in  combination  with  gemcitabine  1000 
mg/m2 administered weekly for 7 weeks of an 8-week cycle followed by weekly administrations for 3 
weeks of a 4-week cycle. A total of 308 patients were exposed to erlotinib 100 mg or 150 mg in these 
2 studies. 
The adverse event profile of erlotinib is characterised by rash and diarrhoea. Rash occurred in 75% to 
85% of erlotinib-treated patients, and diarrhoea occurred in approximately half of the patients. These 
adverse  events  were  usually  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  few  patients  discontinued  medication 
due  to  these  adverse  events.  Grade  3  rash  can  generally  be  handled  with  dose  reductions.  The 
frequency  of  rash  is  biased  by  concurrent  administration  of  gemcitabine.  Grade  3  diarrhoea  may 
respond  to  loperamide  without  the  need  for  dose  reduction,  but  doses  may  have  to  be  reduced  if 
loperamide therapy is not sufficient. 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) with fatal outcome has been raised as a potential concern for this class 
of drugs. In Study BR.21, the incidence of serious ILD-like events was balanced between the erlotinib 
and placebo groups: 0.8% in each treatment arm. 
A conservative estimate of the incidence of ILD-like serious adverse events in study PA.3 was 2.5% 
(7/282 patients) in the combined erlotinib cohorts and 0.4% (1/280 patients) in the combined placebo 
cohorts.  Events  in  the  erlotinib-exposed  patients  were  fatal  in  three  out  of  the  seven  patients,  for  a 
mortality  rate  of  43%.  There  might  be  the  potential  for  significantly  more  pulmonary  toxicity  when 
6 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
erlotinib is given concurrently with gemcitabine, both infrequently associated with pulmonary toxicity 
when given as single agents.  
Adverse events regardless of causality occurring more frequently (≥ 3%) in the erlotinib 100 mg group 
than  in  the  placebo  group  are  described  in  this  section  and  summarized  in  the  following  table  by 
decreasing frequency in the erlotinib group.

Serious Adverse Events study PA.3 
The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  regardless  of  causality  in  the  100 mg  dose  cohort  (see  the 
following table) was higher in the erlotinib arm compared with the placebo arm (51% vs. 39%). This 
imbalance  was  mainly  due  to  minor  differences  in  the  following  SOCs:  infections  and  infestations 
(16%  vs.  11%),  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (13%  vs.  10%),  respiratory, 
thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders  (7%  vs.  4%),  nervous  system  disorders  (4%  vs.  < 1%),  hepatic 
disorders (4% vs. 2%), and renal and urinary disorders (2% vs. 0%). There was no difference in the 
incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  in  the  gastrointestinal  SOC  despite  the  higher  incidence  of 
diarrhoea observed with erlotinib.

Deaths, Study PA.3 
Five  patients  (2%)  died  of  toxicity  attributed  to  protocol  therapy  (i.e.,  erlotinib  and/or  gemcitabine) 
within 30 days of last dose, all in the erlotinib 100 mg dose cohort. The relationship of these events to 
erlotinib could not be concluded.  
Overall Discussion and Benefit Risk assessment  
One  large  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  pivotal  phase  III  study  (PA.3) 
including  569  patients  was  submitted  to  support  the  claimed  indication.  The  design  of  the 
study  PA.3  is  considered  adequate,  as  are  the  chosen  primary  study  outcome,  i.e.  overall 
survival.  Although  it  was  a  controlled,  blinded  study,  the  high  frequency  of  erlotinib-
associated  (typical)  skin  and  gastrointestinal  toxicity  may  have  diluted  blinding  in  a 
significant share of patients. However, almost all occurrences of rash in both treatment groups 
were ascribed by the investigators to erlotinib.  In the placebo plus gemcitabine group, 30% of 
the patients experienced rash– in 26% of the group the event was ascribed either to erlotinib 
alone or to both erlotinib plus gemcitabine.  These facts testify against the notion of “dilution 
of blinding.  
The inclusion of two erlotinib/placebo dose groups into the phase III-controlled trial design is unusual, 
and did not in fact contribute to the finding of the optimal dose of erlotinib if given concurrently with 
gemcitabine, but is not suggested to impair the primary study objective or secondary study objectives. 
Due to the design of study PA.3, the 150 mg patient cohort remained too small for subgroup analysis, 
resulting in the recommendation for 100 mg daily erlotinib together with standard-dosed gemcitabine. 
Treatment  groups  are  well  balanced  for  known  prognostic  factors  in  metastatic  pancreatic  cancer, 
especially ECOG PS, age and distant metastases.   
Regarding  the  primary  objective  a  statistical  significant  difference  of  overall  survival  has  been 
demonstrated. The median overall survival of the combined intervention arm (erlotinib 100mg/150mg) 
was 6.34 months (95% CI: 5.86, 7.20) compared with 5.93 months (95% CI: 5.09, 6.67) in the placebo 
arm. This corresponded to a median survival difference of 0.41 months or approximately 12 days in 
favour of the erlotinib arm. Another perhaps more appropriate measure of overall survival in rapidly 
progressive diseases such as pancreatic cancer is the hazard ratio (HR). In the updated database, the 
observed HR in the 100 mg cohort was 0.82. This translates into an 18% reduction (1 – 0.82) in the 
risk of death for patients in the gemcitabine plus erlotinib arm, or a 22% improvement (1/0.82 – 1) in 
overall survival. Thus the true benefit provided by erlotinib is an increase in overall survival of 22%, 
which can be thought of as an average improvement over the whole survival curve since there was no 
evidence that the hazard ratio varied with time. Both the hazard ratio and the calculated mean survival 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
difference  correspond  to  an  improvement  in  overall  survival  of  approximately  5  weeks  (i.e.  an 
improvement in the same magnitude observed for gemcitabine monotherapy compared to the classical 
palliative treatment with 5-FU). The 1-year survival rates were 19.4% on placebo compared to 23.8% 
on erlotinib. 
Although a statistically significant survival difference has been demonstrated in this single large phase 
III study, a modest survival difference may not be considered clinically meaningful for the following 
clinical  reasons.  Although  the  two  Kaplan-Meier  curves  (erlotinib  versus  placebo)  separate  slightly 
from  the  beginning,  about  2/3  of  the  patients  die,  before  an  at  best  moderate  difference  can  be 
observed.  The quality of life analyses did not show any improvements of treatment but a significant 
deterioration regarding diarrhoea. Amelioration of symptoms has not been demonstrated. It should be 
noted  that  the  study  was  not  powered  to  detect  differences  in  QOL.  Superior  efficacy  has  not  been 
demonstrated for other secondary efficacy results such as tumour response and duration of response. 
Progression-free  survival  was  prolonged  statistically  significant  by  approximately  median  6  days  in 
the erlotinib arm (mean difference 3.9 weeks)   
It  is  accepted,  that  the  most  appropriate  measure  of  overall  survival  in  rapidly  progressive  diseases 
such  as  pancreatic  cancer  is  the  hazard  ratio  (HR).  Both  the  hazard  ratio  and  the  calculated  mean 
survival difference correspond to an improvement in overall survival of approximately 5 weeks. The 
observed median survival difference of 12 days presents the overall survival in an unfavourable way; 
however, also individual point estimates give useful information. Although the two curves (Figure 1) 
in the erlotinib and placebo groups separate slightly from the beginning, about 2/3 of the patients die, 
before an at best moderate difference can be observed.  
There  was  no  difference  in  tumour  response  in  the  two  arms.  The  objective  response-rate  with 
gemcitabine  single-agent  (patients  in  the  placebo  group)  is  in  accordance  with  literature  data,  but 
higher  than  typical  objective  response-rates  with  5-FU  single-agent  treatment  (typically  <5%).  It  is 
increasingly noticed that clinical benefit from erlotinib might not be correlated with objective tumour 
response. There are no data provided as to the objective tumour response in patients administered 150 
mg daily erlotinib concurrently with gemcitabine.  
Furthermore, there are no data on the impact of smoking history on the objective response rate in study 
PA.3.  Smoking  is  not  only  a  risk  factor  for  pancreatic  cancer,  but  might  also  influence  the  tumour 
biology and subsequently the response to anticancer treatment.   
Treatment  with  erlotinib  in  study  PA.3  did  not  improve  overall  quality-of-life,  but  demonstrated  a 
deterioration  of  diarrhoea.  Single  QoL  items  “Social  functioning”  and  “sleep”  improved  with 
borderline statistical significance. The QoL item “pain” improved in 57% of patients in the erlotinib 
arm compared to 50% in the placebo, this was however not statistically significant.  
The adverse event profile of erlotinib is characterised by rash and diarrhoea. Rash occurred in 75% to 
85% of erlotinib-treated patients, and diarrhoea occurred in approximately half of the patients. These 
adverse  events  were  usually  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  few  patients  discontinued  medication 
due to these adverse events.  
The incidence of serious adverse events regardless of causality in the 100 mg dose cohort was higher 
in  the  erlotinib  arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm  (51%  vs.  39%).  Grade  3  rash  can  generally  be 
handled  with  dose  reductions.  The  frequency  of  rash  is  biased  by  concurrent  administration  of 
gemcitabine. Grade 3 diarrhoea may respond to loperamide without the need for dose reduction, but 
doses may have to be reduced if loperamide therapy is not sufficient. 
the MAH has  shown  a  clear  statistical  survival  advantage  for 
the  combination 
Although 
gemcitabine/erlotinib, the CHMP was of the opinion that the clinical relevance of the survival gain is 
doubtful  bearing  in  mind  that  the  toxicity  is  more  pronounced  for  the  combination  than  for 
gemcitabine as monotherapy.

Report from the Scientific Advisory group meeting of 7 July 2006 
The CHMP consulted the Scientific Advisory Group – Oncology on the following questions:  
Q1:  In  terms  of  clinical  benefit,  what  can  be  concluded  about  the  value  of  the  efficacy  results 
associated with treatment with gemcitabine+erlotinib in the proposed indication? 
Whether looking at median survival or other quantiles, at the Kaplan-Maier survival estimators, or at 
the  hazard  ratio,  the  observed  effect  for  the  combination  treatment  of  erlotinib+gemcitabine  v. 
gemcitabine  alone  in  terms  of  overall  survival,  is  very  small.  Concerning  other  efficacy  endpoints, 
including quality of life, progression-free survival, and objective response rate, the effect is similarly 
small,  or  not  detectable,  despite  the  large  sample  size.  Considering  all  the  available  efficacy  data 
presented,  the  observed  effect  size  does  not  allow  to  conclude  that  there  is  a  clinical  benefit  in  the 
claimed indication. Rather, failure to detect a relevant effect in the large study PA.3 suggests that the 
existence of a meaningful effect in the population is unlikely.  
It  is  possible  that  the  observed  activity  might  be  of  some  benefit  in  certain  subpopulations  but  this 
remains  a  hypothesis  at  this  stage.  Based  on  the  data  and  subgroup  analyses  presented,  there  are  no 
clear hints as to whether such subgroups exist and how they might be identified. 
Q2:  From  a  clinical  perspective,  how  does  the  magnitude  of  the  clinical  benefit  compare  to  the 
observed harms and risks associated with gemcitabine+erlotinib in the proposed indication? 
The  observed  efficacy  results,  and  the  lack  of  a  clinical  benefit  (see  answer  to  Q1)  do  not  compare 
favourably  with  the  observed  toxicity  for  the  combination  erlotinib+gemcitabine  compared  to 
gemcitabine alone. Although there are no striking differences in terms of severe and life-threatening 
toxicity, there are frequent and significantly higher grade 1-2 toxicity such as diarrhoea and rash which 
cumulatively over the duration of treatment can represent a significant burden for the patient. There 
are no convincing quality of life data to show that this would not be the case. The absolute level of 
grade 3-4 toxicity is not a concern, but a relatively high rate of possibly treatment-related deaths has 
been observed for the combination arm. Overall, from a clinical perspective, the toxicity observed for 
the  combination  compares  unfavourably  with  the  very  small  effect  observed  on  clinical  efficacy 
endpoints. 
Q3: No reasonably well justified prognostic factors enabling enrichment of the target population have 
been  identified  at  baseline.  The  predictive  value  of  on-therapy  rash  grade  2/3,  however,  is  again 
suggested  by  the  data  and  suggests  that  this  could  be  used  to  guide  the  physicians  as  regards 
withdrawal from erlotinib therapy. 
There  are  no  data  to  suggest  what  subgroups,  if  any,  may  have  a  clear  clinical  benefit  from  the 
treatment  with  erlotinib+gemcitabine.  Further  studies  would  have  to  be  conducted  in  order  to  study 
this aspect. The development of rash does not seem to provide useful information as to what patients 
might respond to therapy. 
Q4: Is it reasonable to suspect that there might be antagonistic interaction between chemotherapy and 
erlotinib in certain groups of patients? 
Based  on  the  data  presented,  there  are  no  reasons  to  suspect  an  antagonistic  interaction  between 
erlotinib and gemcitabine in certain subgroups of patients. 
Q5: To what extent would studies be warranted or urgently needed in order to ensure that populations 
with clearly negative benefit-risk profile are identified, and what types of studies would be needed? 
Overall,  the  benefit-risk  balance  is  considered  negative  in  the  claimed  indication  (see  answer  to  Q1 
and Q2). Whether there exist subpopulations in which the balance is positive is unknown at this stage 
(see answer to Q3).

CHMP opinion of 27 July 2007 
On 27 July 2006 the CHMP considered this Type II variation and agreed that the changes to the terms 
of the Marketing Authorisation should be refused on the following grounds: 
− 
− 
The  effect  in  terms  of  overall  survival  was  too  marginal  to  constitute  a  clinical  benefit  in  the 
population treated with the combination of erlotinib + gemcitabine given the toxicity profile of 
the  combination  treatment  in  patients  with  locally  advanced,  unresectable  or  metastatic 
pancreatic cancer. 
Concerning  other  efficacy  endpoints,  including  quality  of  life,  progression-free  survival,  and 
objective  response  rate,  the  effect  is  similarly  small,  despite  the  large  sample  size  of  the  trial 
PA3.  
Discussion on the MAH’s grounds for Re-examination of the negative opinion. 
On  16  October  the  MAH  submitted  the  grounds  supporting  a  request  for  a  re-examination  of  the 
negative  opinion.  As  the  basis  for  this  re-examination,  each  of  the  above  grounds  for  refusal  was 
addressed by the MAH as summarised here.  
-  Erlotinib  has  demonstrated  a  significant  and  clinically  relevant  survival  benefit  in  patients  with 
pancreatic cancer in a well designed, placebo controlled trial,  
- 
Pancreatic cancer is a rapidly fatal condition with a median survival of 6 months only. Given such 
a  poor  outlook  even  modest  improvements  in  survival  should  be  regarded  as  clinically 
meaningful. 
-  The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  are  consistent  with  and  support  the  overall  survival  benefit 
observed in the PA3 trial. 
-  The  added  toxicity  of  erlotinib  is  moderate  and  acceptable  in  this  uniformly  fatal  disease, 
especially  when  viewed  in  the  context  of  the  survival  benefit.    This  is  supported  by  the  QoL 
analyses. 
The rapporteurs during the review of the detailed ground for the re-examination discussed a number of 
outstanding points as follows. 
Clinical benefit 
Survival  was  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  study  was  designed  as  a  double  blind  study.  The 
assessment  benefit  of  erlotinib  add-on to  gemcitabine  in  the  treatment  of  pancreatic  cancer  refers  to 
prolonged overall survival (mean 5 weeks). Tumour response and progression were not independently 
assessed. As such this is acceptable. With respect to the supportive value of tumour-related endpoints, 
possible unblinding due to rash and other characteristic adverse events, is of relevance, however. With 
respect  to  the  statistical  robustness  of  survival  benefit  data,  the  requirements  set  forth  in 
CPMP/2330/99  are  not  fulfilled.  The  p-value  is  about  0.02  and  the  supportive  value  of  PFS  data  is 
limited due to methodological concerns.  
Safety  
The overall incidence of diarrhoea was 36% in the placebo plus gemcitabine arm and 48% in the arm 
receiving erlotinib plus gemcitabine.  Most events were by severity of Grade 1 or 2 while 5% in the 
erlotinib  arm  experienced  Grade  3  severity  compared  to  2%  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  frequency  of 
hospitalization  due  to  diarrhoea  could  be  described  as  balanced  between  the  arms  –  three  in  the 
placebo  arm  and  four  in  the  erlotinib  arm.  The  diarrhoea  could  be  managed  with  the  usual  medical 
therapy  (loperamide)  in  most  patients.  Two  erlotinib-treated  patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to 
diarrhoea. Thus, although the proportion of patients experiencing diarrhoea was higher in the erlotinib 
plus  gemcitabine  arm,  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  suffered  from  diarrhoea  during  a  short  time 
during the treatment period.  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rash occurred in 75% to 85% of erlotinib-treated patients. These adverse events were usually mild or 
moderate in severity. Erlotinib rash responds well to moisturising agents and topical antibiotics where 
inflammation occurs. Also other EGFR affecting substances have shown a high percentage of this type 
of rash and this correlates with favourable outcome, as analysed later.  
With respect to severe and serious adverse reactions, the safety profile is considered acceptable and as 
regards common reactions such as rash and diarrhoea.  
Quality of Life 
The pivotal study PA.3 was not powered or designed to demonstrate an improvement in quality of life 
(QoL) of the participating patients, and it is acknowledged that it is difficult to detect an improvement 
in quality of life when two anticancer agents are combined in such a rapidly fatal disease. Therefore 
conclusions concerning QoL aspects in this study have a lot of limitations. Nevertheless, although the 
value of the QoL assessment in this study is limited, it seems notable that with the exception of the 
occurrence  of  diarrhoea  and  rash  the  add-on  therapy  has  no  significantly  negative  impact  on  the 
quality of life of the patients in this trial. Furthermore the data do not indicate a relevant influence of 
the  development  of  rash  on  QoL.  Whether  the  submitted  post  hoc-analysis  of  the  time  to  5  % 
deterioration  in  global  quality  of  life  score  really  demonstrates  positive  signal  as  a  significant  and 
valid effect with regard to prolonged time to deterioration seems to be doubtful out of methodological 
reasons. 
Identification of a sub-population that may derive greater benefit 
The only current options for identification of subgroups of patients who may achieve greater benefit 
are currently based on exploratory sub-population analyses of the study data.   
Patients,  whose  pancreatic  cancer-related  symptoms  are  still  modest  and  whose  quality  of  life  and 
performance status is favourable, are likely to derive more benefit from erlotinib treatment, based on a 
post-hoc analysis of the PA.3 study data.  These patients who still have a good quality of life and only 
moderate  pain  achieve  an  HR  of  0.63,  regardless  of  performance  status.    The  result  is  that  these 
patients,  whose  life  expectancy  is  already  greater  than  the  overall  population,  achieved  a  median 
increase in survival of two months. Low pain intensity at baseline appears to be the main driver, rather 
than quality of life score or ECOG status, as with low pain intensity alone the apparent survival benefit 
approached that achieved when the three criteria were combined. 
Another  subgroup,  which  appears  to  derive  benefit,  is  patients  with  distant  metastases,  compared  to 
those with just locally advanced disease. Such a distinction has also previously been reported.  
Patients who develop rash 
Rash  has  been  considered  to  be  an  indicator  of  the  desirable  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  the  drug, 
indicative of the necessary and required systemic exposure to erlotinib. Survival outcome by grade of 
rash is presented in the table below.

Erlotinib-related  rash  generally  occurs  early  during  treatment  in  those  patients  who  develop  it.    As 
shown  below,  the  median  time  to  the  first  occurrence  of  rash  (any  Grade)  was  10  days  (in  both 
treatment groups) and the 90th percentile for onset of rash in the erlotinib plus gemcitabine group was 
44 days. 
The  results  of  a  recently  reported,  randomised  study  conducted  with  cetuximab  in  patients  with 
colorectal cancer is compatible with the notion that dose individualisation using rash as a “biomarker” 
for  dose  adjustments  might  enhance  the  activity  of  cetuximab.  Whether  this  would  be  the  case  in 
pancreatic  cancer  and  for  erlotinib  is  obviously  an  open  question.  A  study  exploring  this  and  other 
pertinent questions related to optimised patient selection based on tumour geno/phenotype data would 
be of major clinical interest. In this context it is noted that exploratory data from Study PA.3 are yet 
not available. 
With respect to the estimated treatment effect, the relative survival benefit is small (hazard ratio 0.8) in 
comparison with what is often seen in add-on studies within the field of oncology. The absolute added 
benefit (mean 5 weeks) is moderate. In an attempt to identify subpopulations that benefit, EGFR IHC 
has  not  proved  helpful.  Exploratory  subpopulation  analyses  suggest  that  patients  in  generally  good 
condition  (low  pain  intensity,  good  quality  of  life  at  baseline,  good  PS)  or  distant  metastases  may 
derive enhanced survival benefit. There is a correlation between grade of rash and survival. 
Assuming  that  the  point  estimate  for  survival  benefit  accurately  estimates  the  magnitude  of  the 
treatment  effect  in  the  full  study  population  and  if,  in  clinical  practice,  the  individual  patient’s 
prognostic  factors  are  taken  into  account  in  the  decision  whether  and  how  to  treat,  then  it  can  be 
considers that the benefit of add-on therapy with erlotinib outweighs the risk. The issue of correlation 
of rash incidence with outcome was also debated. One option could be that in the absence of erlotinib-
related rash until after about 4 weeks, erlotinib therapy could be reconsidered. Available data indicate 
that quality of life is not relevantly impaired. It is acknowledged, however, that there are uncertainties 
related to this assessment. 
Report from the Scientific Advisory Group Meeting of 30 November 2006 
Since  several  issues  still  remained  open,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  Scientific  Advisory  Group 
should be convened and the following questions were adopted by the CHMP to be addressed by the 
SAG- Oncology at the meeting of 30 November 2006: 
1.  What  is  the  SAG  position  of  the  rapporteurs’  assessment  of  efficacy  concluding  that  the 
modest effect on survival seen in the study PA.3 is meaningful? 
The  SAG  has  extensively  discussed  this  open  question  and  a  number  of  different  views  were  put 
forward  showing  substantial  divergence  of  views.  There  are  at  least  two  issues  that  need  to  be 
considered jointly, namely, validity of the results and the meaningfulness of the treatment effect.  
Validity of results 
Study design, one single pivotal study 
The demonstration of efficacy is based on a single pivotal trial, PA.3. Supporting the validity of the 
results  is  the  fact  that  the  trial  was  a  well  designed,  large  double  blind  randomized  controlled  trial. 
Purely  looking  at  trial  design,  one  could  argue  that  a  large  randomized  controlled  trial  could  in 
principle provide sufficient evidence to establish efficacy. It was claimed that there were no striking 
imbalances  in  important  prognostic  factors,  and  that  the  observed  effects  are  unlikely  to  be  due  to 
chance alone. 
Against the validity of the results was the consideration that the statistical evidence from PA.3 that the 
efficacy findings are not due to chance is not overwhelming, based on the moderate significance level 
for the updated study data P=0.028. A second randomized controlled trial would be recommended to 
provide  additional  statistical  evidence  (although  its  additive  contribution  if  results  were  identical  or 
similar was questioned).  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
Internal validity, effect across subgroups 
In  support  of  internal  validity  is  the  fact  that  the  effect  on  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  was 
consistent with the effect on survival. The effect was generally consistent across different subgroups, 
adding  to  the  validity  of  the  observed  effect.  Internal  consistency  is  also  reinforced  by  the  effect  of 
usual predictive factors including poor performance status and highly symptomatic patients and better 
effect in patients with rash. 
However, doubts on internal validity were raised because the response rate (RR) was exactly the same 
in the two arms. It was argued that when identical RR but different PFS are seen in different arms of a 
randomized controlled trial this may be due to a bona fide cytostatic effect, but equally may be due to 
prognostic  imbalances  in  the  populations.  The  effect  was  not  always  consistent  across  subgroups. 
Patients with lower pain score and better baseline QL, of which there were 158 in the study (28% of 
the trial population) appeared to have a large benefit so it is likely the remaining  patients had little or 
no benefit. Also, acknowledging the pitfalls of exploratory subgroup analyses, there was no evidence 
of benefit in patients with locally advanced disease and the unexpected observation of a HR close to 
1.0 for women, for patients aged >65 years, and for non-North Americans.  
Meaningful treatment effect 
Speaking for the meaningfulness of the effect is the estimated 20% improvement in the hazard rate in 
a  population  with  very  poor  prognosis.  Looking  at  average  survival  the  treatment  effect  is 
approximately 5 weeks. The estimate is claimed to be unbiased in terms of right-censoring. The hazard 
rate  was  claimed  to  be  approximately  proportional  for  the  entire  duration  of  follow-up  and  it  was 
claimed  that  there  are  no  apparent  outlying  observations  that  may  individually  explain  the  observed 
effect.  A  true    effect  of  5  weeks  would  generally  be  considered  as  clinically  meaningful.  A  risk 
reduction of 20% with 4% absolute difference in the long term survivors is in line with the effects of a 
number of anticancer agents in different settings. 
Against the conclusion of a meaningful effect, the concern was raised that the Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves  are  very  similar  and  the  proportion  of  deaths  between  the  two  groups  only  differs  by  a  few 
events for a very short time period. As an example, the difference in median survival is approximately 
12 days and this is can be considered to be a futile effect. The average is sensitive to outliers, and it is 
difficult to assess whether this is a homogenous effect across the entire population or if it is due to a 
few outlying observations. The curves track very close up to 8 months and the mean difference of 5 
weeks is seen because of the larger separation in the tail. About 2/3 of the patients die, before an at 
best moderate difference can be observed. Accordingly, one could argue that any benefit is confined to 
patients  with  a  prognosis  of  >9  months  on  gemcitabine  alone.  The  considerable  difference  between 
mean and median prolongation of overall survival are of concern. Similarly, progression-free survival 
(PFS) was prolonged by approximately median 6 days in the erlotinib arm, with a mean difference of 
3.9 weeks. Again, the difference is not considered clinically relevant, although statistically significant. 
As a consequence, the requirements set forth in CPMP Points to Consider On Application With One 
Pivotal  Study  (CPMP/2330/99)  cannot  be  seen  as  fulfilled.  It  was  also  reminded  that  the  benefit  of 
gemcitabine  as  compared  to  single-agent  5-fluorouracil  in  the  gemcitabine  registration  study  was  in 
the range of 4-5 weeks, but most importantly, it was accompanied by an improvement in quality of life 
issues. On the contrary, study PA.3 was not able to show any improvements in quality of life issues. 
Amelioration of symptoms has not been demonstrated. In conclusion, according to this view, although 
the applicant has shown a statistical survival advantage for the combination gemcitabine/erlotinib as 
compared to gemcitabine/placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the clinical relevance 
of the survival gain was  considered doubtful, bearing in  mind that the  median survival difference is 
only 12 days. 
Conclusions 
There has been intense and comprehensive discussion on this topic. No consensus among the experts 
was reached and this was certainly influenced by the lack of even preliminary results from biomarker 
studies, thus relying only on exploration of clinical data. In summary, concerning this question there 
were three main different positions:  
1)  The effect observed is unlikely to be due to chance and is clinically meaningful in this situation. 
14 
2)  It is not possible to conclude that the effect is unlikely to be due to chance and an additional study 
–  for  instance  testing  increased  dosing  in  patients  without  side  effect  should  be  conducted  to 
confirm the effect.  
3)  Whether the effect is due to chance or not, the observed effect is so small that it is of no clinical 
relevance,  the  effect  compares  unfavourably  to  the  observed  toxicity,  and  based  on  the  data 
provided,  it  is  not  possible  to  identify  a  subpopulation  likely  to  derive  any  meaningful  clinical 
benefit. 
2.  From a pharmacodynamic perspective, activation of EGFR signalling pathways (irrespective 
of cause) appears to be a likely prerequisite for the therapeutic activity of erlotinib.  
2.1  To  what  extent  is  heterogeneity  (within  sample  and  between  sources,  e.g.  primary  v. 
metastases)  with  respect  to  EGFR  activations  known  to  influence  erlotinib  (or  gefetinib) 
activity? 
EGFR signalling activation is a possible biomarker but regrettably there are no comprehensive data to 
address this issue in the context of the PA.3 trial nor in any other ongoing or planned trials. However, 
it  is  possible  that  EGFR  may  not  explain  all  or  even  most  of  the  effect  observed,  as  the  true 
mechanism of action for this tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) in vivo remains to be elucidated. 
2.2  Irrespective  of  measure,  is  it  possible  to  meaningfully  define  a  sample  as  “negative”  or. 
“positive” with respect to receptor status and or EGFR activation? 
No study allows for a precise definition of the cut-off value to consider a pancreatic cancer as positive 
or negative for EGFR expression (or amplification). Furthermore a number of data suggest that Ki-ras 
mutation, which is frequent in pancreatic cancer, could bypass the transduction pathway and lead to 
insensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. 
2.3  Is  EGFR  signalling  activation  (or  any  other  measure)  possible  to  estimate  with  valid 
technology in clinical practice prior to treatment with erlotinib?  
In  view  of  the  diagnostic  tools  (CT,  US  guided  biopsies),  small  size  of  the  samples  and  frequent 
heterogeneity in terms of pathology, one can consider that no measure has been validated in clinical 
practice. 
2.4  Are there data indicating that the use of erlotinib would be of benefit to specific subgroups 
of patients (low pain, incidence of rash…) ? 
There  was  agreement  that  based  on  theoretical  arguments  and  the  claimed  pharmacodynamic  effect, 
patients  for  whom  the  tumour  did  not  express  EGFR  could  not  be  considered  candidates  for  such 
treatment.  However,  the  lack  of  a  biomarker  study  was  considered  as  a  major  deficiency  in  the 
application  and  there  is  a  compelling  rationale  for  conducting  such  studies  in  parallel  with  further 
clinical studies (e.g., randomised study of standard dose erlotinib v. tailoring to rash in the other arm, 
with collection of tumour material for all patients).  
Based on the available data there are no confirmatory data indicating that the use of erlotinib would be 
of  benefit  to  specific  subgroups  of  patients  (low  pain,  incidence  of  rash…).  However  it  was 
aknowledged that in a variety of tumour and with different EGFR inhibitors (MoAB or TKI) patients 
experiencing a rash were the most likely to benefit from the agent to the extent that dose escalation 
with another agent has been tested in patients without rash with achievement of further responses. The 
subgroup analysis provided also suggest that most of the apparent effect was accounted for by patients 
who developed a grade >1 rash while receiving erlotinib. Thus one could in theory hypothesize that 
the  efficacy  might  be  increased  in  asymptomatic  or  mildly  symptomatic  patients  with  good 
performance  status,  and  that  treatment  should  not  be  continued  in  patients  without  evidence  of  skin 
rash.  However,  such  claims  remain  hypothetical  and  would  require  confirmatory  evidence  from 
prospectively conducted clinical trials.  
There  is  no  clinically  useful  guidance  for  patient  selection,  in  order  to  prevent  significant 
overexposure of the population of patients with pancreatic cancer. Selection based on development of 
rash means that 100% of patients will be treated. It will be very difficult to discontinue therapy if no or 
15 
 
just little rash develops, and it would be difficult to define clear thresholds. Furthermore, there are no 
known dose-effect relationships for rash, i.e. useful dose-adaptation is an undeveloped strategy. 
Regardless  of  approval  status,  further  studies  are  warranted.  A  second  randomised  controlled  trial 
should  be  conducted,  for  example  looking  comparing  a  dose  increase  in  patients  without  rash  at  2 
weeks,  v.  standard  dose.  Such  a  study  should  also  include  systematic  biomarker  studies  (HER1 
transduction patway and Ki-ras mutations). 
3.  In the context of the indication, can the safety profile be considered acceptable?  As regards 
common reactions such as rash and diarrhoea, are these manageable and reversible? 
Yes.  In  the  context  of  the  indication,  compared  to  the  toxicity  profile  of  5-FU  and  gemcitabine,  the 
safety profile can be considered acceptable. As regards common reactions such as rash and diarrhoea, 
these are manageable and reversible.  
Benefit-risk balance 
On the issue of balance of observed effect and toxicity there was considerable divergence of views. 
In  favour  of  a  conclusion  of  positive  benefit-risk,  considering  the  severity  and  the  general  poor 
prognosis of the disease, the observed benefit of 20% increase in the hazard ratio for overall survival 
clearly  outweighs  the  toxicity  and  any  risks.  The  excess  toxicity  in  terms  of  diarrhoea  and  rash  is 
primarily grade 1 and 2 toxicity which are of no relevance in the context of the clinical picture. 
According to a contrary view, the increase in toxicity for  erlotinib + gemcitabine is small but not 
negligible. The toxicity is markedly increased for diarrhoea and rash with the combination of 
gemcitabine/erlotinib as compared to gemcitabine/placebo. A significant deterioration regarding 
diarrhoea has been observed in the quality of life questionnaire. There have been fatalities attributed to 
toxicity of erlotinib + gemcitabine. Given the small treatment effect, which is further weakened by 
uncertainties about the validity of the data, the toxicity is considered unacceptable and that the benefit 
risk balance is negative or neutral at best in the claimed indication.  
Restricted indication: Metastatic pancreatic cancer 
As discussed in the initial assessment and during the re-examination, the HR for overall survival for 
locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients is 0.93 with a CI of 0.65 to 1.35. During the MAH’s oral 
explanation, the benefit of erlotinib in these patients was questioned. The biologic/ clinical basis for 
this discrepancy needs further explanation, which was provided from the MAH during the meeting.   
Supporting evidence from other trials: 
In  the  original  trial  comparing  the  treatment  with  gemcitabine  and  5FU  (Burris  et  al)  data  were  not 
analysed by extent of disease.   
In the trial by Louvet et al., which compared treatment with gemcitabine +/- oxaliplatin, the median 
OS time for the whole population was not significantly different (6.9 months for Gem alone and 8.8 
months  for  GemOx;  p  =  0.15;  HR,  1.18;  95%  CI,  0.94  to  1.51).   For  the  subpopulation  of  locally 
advanced  patients,  median  survival  times  were  identical  in  both  arms  (10.3  months),  whereas  for 
metastatic patients, the median survival time was 6.7 months in the Gem arm and 8.5 months in the 
GemOx arm (p = 0.17; HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.63).   
Based on the results presented at the annual ASCO meeting, (Saif MW.: Pancreatic cancer: highlights 
from  the  42nd  annual  meeting  of  the  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology,  2006.  JOP.  2006  Jul 
10;7(4):337-48)  it  is  concluded  that  patients  with  locally  advanced  vs.  metastatic  pancreatic  cancer 
should  be  studied  separately,  for  the  better  understanding  of  the  biology  of  pancreatic  cancer  and 
evaluation of novel agents.  
Possible biological rationale 
The biological basis for the lack of efficacy in locally advanced disease in these trials is not known.  
Potential explanation cited by Louvet is the use of concomitant radiotherapy.  However, the number of 
patients  in  the  PA3  trial  who  received  radiotherapy  is  too  small  to  explain  this  (please  see  enclosed 
table).   In  the  literature,  no  meaningful  data  can  show  that  the  molecular  genetic  alterations  or  the 
growth control mechanisms in locally advanced pancreatic cancer are different than those operative in 
16 
 
 
metastatic  pancreatic  cancer.   Therefore,  the  greater  likelihood  of  locally  invasive  complications 
resulting from small increases in tumor mass in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer may 
be the key factor leading to inability to demonstrate a survival benefit of erlotinib. 
Discussion on the results of erlotinib + gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer 
An exploratory analysis compared  overall survival in the metastatic pancreatic cancer patient subset 
treated with erlotinib + gemcitabine (n=200) to the those who received gencitabine + placebo (n=197). 
The Median overall survival was 5.93 months versus 5.06 months, the mean was 8.10 months versus 
6.67  months.  The  hazard  ratio  of  0.80  with  a  CI  of  0.656-0.978  is  as  previously  estimated  for  the 
overall population (0.82) translating in 25 % improvement. The Kaplan- Meier curve for the metastatic 
population is presented below.

Survival (months) 
Following  discussion  on  this  analysis,  it  was  considered  that  an  indication  could  be  granted  for 
metastatic pancreatic patients. Given the very short life-expectancy of patients with pancreatic cancer, 
even  apparently  modest  improvements  in  survival  are  considered  critical  by  patients,  their  families, 
and  treating  physicians.  As  regards  to  safety  of  erlotinib  in  the  context  of  the  indication,  the  safety 
profile  is  acceptable.  Common  reactions  such  as  rash  and  diarrhoea  are  manageable  and  reversible. 
Having now restricted the indication to patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, the CHMP agreed 
that the benefit –risk ratio in this population is positive.  
The  MAH  agreed  with  the  CHMP  on  post-approval  commitments:  A  study  addressing  the  issue 
whether  advanced  pancreatic  patients  treated  with  Tarceva  and  gemcitabine  and  do  not  have  rash  
could benefit from dose escalation of erlotinib. A second study will be designed addressing the issue 
of patient selection with advanced pancreatic cancer for treatment with erlotinib based on predictive 
genetic and / or other biomarkers.

IV. 
 CONCLUSION 
On  14  December  2006  the  CHMP  considered  the  grounds  for  the  re-examination  on  the  negative 
opinion on this Type II variation and recommended by a majority of 20 out of 26 votes that its opinion 
of July 2006 should be revised, accepting the following restricted indication: 
Tarceva  in  combination  with  gemcitabine  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic 
pancreatic cancer. 
When prescribing Tarceva, factors associated with prolonged survival should be taken into account. 
No survival advantage could be shown for patients with locally advanced disease. 
-  The divergent opinion expressed by some CHMP members was: 
The demonstration of efficacy is based on the single pivotal trial PA.3. The prerequisites for a single 
confirmatory  trial  to  be  used  for  registration  set  forth  in  CPMP  Points  to  Consider  On  Application 
With  One  Pivotal  Study  (CPMP/2330/99)  include  that  the  estimated  size  of  clinical  benefit  must  be 
large enough to be clinically valuable, and that the statistical evidence should be considerably stronger 
than P<.05. Concerning clinical benefit, the estimated effect on survival is small and its clinical value 
is  questionable.  Furthermore,  the  statistical  evidence  from  PA.3  is  not  very  strong  (P=0.028).  In 
addition, the proposed indication “metastatic cancer of the pancreas” is based on a post hoc analysis. A 
marked  increase  in  toxicity  in  terms  of  diarrhoea  and  rash  has  been  associated  with  erlotinib 
combination  treatment.  Given  the  non  compelling  efficacy  results,  the  lack  of  a  sizeable  clinical 
benefit, the weak statistical evidence, and the non-negligible toxicity, we believe that the benefit-risk 
balance of erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine for the indication of advanced pancreatic cancer 
is not established. 
Follow-up measures undertaken by the Marketing Authorisation Holder  
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to submit the follow-up measures as listed below and to 
submit  any  variation  application  which  would  be  necessary  in  the  light  of  compliance  with  these 
commitments: 
- 
Study  addressing  the  issue  whether  patients  without  rash  could  benefit  from  the  addition  of 
Tarceva to gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer (e.g. by dose escalation) 
- 
Study addressing the issue of patient selection with advanced pancreatic cancer for treatment with 
erlotinib based on predictive genetic and / or other biomarkers

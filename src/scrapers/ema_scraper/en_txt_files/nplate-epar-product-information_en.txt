CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Adults: 
Nplate is indicated for the treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who 
are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Paediatrics: 
Nplate is indicated for the treatment of chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in paediatric 
patients one year of age and older who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should remain under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in the treatment of 
haematological diseases.

Posology 
Nplate should be administered once weekly as a subcutaneous injection. 
Initial dose 
The initial dose of romiplostim is 1 mcg/kg based on actual body weight. 
Dose calculation 
The volume of romiplostim to administer is calculated based on body weight, dose required, and 
concentration of product. 
Table 1. Guidelines for calculating individual patient dose and volume of romiplostim to 
administer 
Individual patient dose 
(mcg) 
Individual patient dose (mcg) = weight (kg) x dose in mcg/kg 
Actual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when 
calculating initial dose. 
• 
• 
In adults, future dose adjustments are based on changes in platelet 
counts only. 
In paediatric patients, future dose adjustments are based on changes 
in platelet counts and changes in body weight. Reassessment of 
body weight is recommended every 12 weeks. 
If individual patient 
dose is ≥ 23 mcg 
Reconstitute lyophilised product as described in section 6.6. The resulting 
concentration is 500 mcg/mL. 
Volume to administer (mL) = Individual patient dose (mcg) / 500 mcg/mL 
(Round volume to the nearest hundredth mL) 
If individual patient 
dose is < 23 mcg 
Dilution is required to ensure accurate dosing. Reconstitute lyophilised 
product and then dilute the product as described in section 6.6. The 
resulting concentration is 125 mcg/mL. 
Volume to administer (mL) = Individual patient dose (mcg) / 125 mcg/mL 
(Round volume to the nearest hundredth mL) 
Example 
10 kg patient is initiated at 1 mcg/kg of romiplostim. 
Individual patient dose (mcg) = 10 kg x 1 mcg/kg = 10 mcg 
Because the dose is < 23 mcg, dilution is required to ensure accurate 
dosing. Reconstitute lyophilised product and then dilute the product as 
described in section 6.6. The resulting concentration is 125 mcg/mL. 
Volume to administer (mL) = 10 mcg / 125 mcg/mL = 0.08 mL 
Dose adjustments 
A subject’s actual body weight at initiation of therapy should be used to calculate dose. The once 
weekly dose of romiplostim should be increased by increments of 1 mcg/kg until the patient achieves a 
platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L. Platelet counts should be assessed weekly until a stable platelet count 
(≥ 50 x 109/L for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment) has been achieved. Platelet counts should 
be assessed monthly thereafter and appropriate dose adjustments made as per the dose adjustment

table (table 2) in order to maintain platelet counts within the recommended range. See table 2 below 
for dose adjustment and monitoring. A maximum once weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg should not be 
exceeded. 
Table 2. Dose adjustment guidance based on platelet count 
Platelet count 
(x 109/L) 
Action 
< 50 
Increase once weekly dose by 1 mcg/kg  
> 150 for two 
consecutive weeks 
Decrease once weekly dose by 1 mcg/kg 
Do not administer, continue to assess the platelet count weekly 
> 250 
After the platelet count has fallen to < 150 x 109/L, resume dosing with once 
weekly dose reduced by 1 mcg/kg 
Due to the interindividual variable platelet response, in some patients platelet count may abruptly fall 
below 50 x 109/L after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. In these cases, if clinically 
appropriate, higher cut-off levels of platelet count for dose reduction (200 x 109/L) and treatment 
interruption (400 x 109/L) may be considered according to medical judgement. 
A loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim within the recommended 
dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors (see section 4.4, loss of response to 
romiplostim). 
Treatment discontinuation 
Treatment with romiplostim should be discontinued if the platelet count does not increase to a level 
sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after four weeks of romiplostim therapy at the highest 
weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg. 
Patients should be clinically evaluated periodically and continuation of treatment should be decided on 
an individual basis by the treating physician, and in non-splenectomised patients this should include 
evaluation relative to splenectomy. The reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia is likely upon 
discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) 
No overall differences in safety or efficacy have been observed in patients < 65 and ≥ 65 years of age 
(see section 5.1). Although based on these data no adjustment of the dosing regimen is required for 
older patients, care is advised considering the small number of elderly patients included in the clinical 
trials so far. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of romiplostim in children under the age of one year has not been established. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Romiplostim should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score ≥ 7) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis in 
patients with thrombocytopenia associated to hepatic insufficiency treated with thrombopoietin (TPO) 
agonists (see section 4.4). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the use of romiplostim is deemed necessary, platelet count should be closely monitored to minimise 
the risk of thromboembolic complications. 
Patients with renal impairment 
No formal clinical trials have been conducted in these patient populations. Nplate should be used with 
caution in these populations. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous use. 
After reconstitution of the powder, Nplate solution for injection is administered subcutaneously. The 
injection volume may be very small. Caution should be used during preparation of Nplate in 
calculating the dose and reconstitution with the correct volume of sterile water for injection. If the 
calculated individual patient dose is less than 23 mcg, dilution with preservative-free, sterile, sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is required to ensure accurate dosing (see section 6.6). 
Special care should be taken to ensure that the appropriate volume of Nplate is withdrawn from the 
vial for subcutaneous administration – a syringe with graduations of 0.01 mL should be used. 
Self-administration of Nplate is not allowed for paediatric patients. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to E. coli 
derived proteins. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia and bleeding after cessation of treatment 
Thrombocytopenia is likely to reoccur upon discontinuation of treatment with romiplostim. There is 
an increased risk of bleeding if romiplostim treatment is discontinued in the presence of anticoagulants 
or anti-platelet agents. Patients should be closely monitored for a decrease in platelet count and 
medically managed to avoid bleeding upon discontinuation of treatment with romiplostim. It is 
recommended that, if treatment with romiplostim is discontinued, ITP treatment be restarted according 
to current treatment guidelines. Additional medical management may include cessation of 
anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy, reversal of anticoagulation, or platelet support. 
Increased bone marrow reticulin 
Increased bone marrow reticulin is believed to be a result of TPO receptor stimulation, leading to an 
increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, which may subsequently release cytokines. 
Increased reticulin may be suggested by morphological changes in the peripheral blood cells and can 
be detected through bone marrow biopsy. Therefore, examinations for cellular morphological 
abnormalities using peripheral blood smear and complete blood count (CBC) prior to and during 
treatment with romiplostim are recommended. See section 4.8 for information on the increases of 
reticulin observed in romiplostim clinical trials. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a loss of efficacy and abnormal peripheral blood smear is observed in patients, administration of 
romiplostim should be discontinued, a physical examination should be performed, and a bone marrow 
biopsy with appropriate staining for reticulin should be considered. If available, comparison to a prior 
bone marrow biopsy should be made. If efficacy is maintained and abnormal peripheral blood smear is 
observed in patients, the physician should follow appropriate clinical judgment, including 
consideration of a bone marrow biopsy, and the risk-benefit of romiplostim and alternative ITP 
treatment options should be re-assessed. 
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications 
Platelet counts above the normal range present a risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. 
The incidence of thrombotic/thromboembolic events observed in clinical trials was 6.0% with 
romiplostim and 3.6% with placebo. Caution should be used when administering romiplostim to 
patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism including but not limited to inherited (e.g. 
Factor V Leiden) or acquired risk factors (e.g. ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome), 
advanced age, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, malignancies, contraceptives and 
hormone replacement therapy, surgery/trauma, obesity and smoking. 
Cases of thromboembolic events (TEEs), including portal vein thrombosis, have been reported in 
patients with chronic liver disease receiving romiplostim. Romiplostim should be used with caution in 
these populations. Dose adjustment guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2). 
Medication errors 
Medication errors including overdose and underdose have been reported in patients receiving Nplate, 
dose calculation and dose adjustment guidelines should be followed. In some paediatric patients, 
accurate dosing relies on an additional dilution step after reconstitution which may increase the risk 
for medication errors (see section 4.2). 
Overdose may result in an excessive increase in platelet counts associated with 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. If the platelet counts are excessively increased, 
discontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts. Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with 
dosing and administration recommendations. Underdose may result in lower than expected platelet 
counts and potential for bleeding. Platelet counts should be monitored in patients receiving Nplate (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.9). 
Progression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) 
A positive benefit/risk for romiplostim is only established for the treatment of thrombocytopenia 
associated with ITP (see section 4.1) and romiplostim must not be used in other clinical conditions 
associated with thrombocytopenia. 
The diagnosis of ITP in adults and elderly patients should have been confirmed by the exclusion of 
other clinical entities presenting with thrombocytopenia, in particular the diagnosis of MDS must be 
excluded. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should normally have been done over the course of the 
disease and treatment, particularly in patients over 60 years of age, for those with systemic symptoms 
or abnormal signs such as increased peripheral blast cells. 
In adult clinical studies of treatment with romiplostim in patients with MDS, cases of transient 
increases in blast cell counts were observed and cases of MDS disease progression to AML were 
reported. In a randomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS subjects, treatment with romiplostim was 
prematurely stopped due to a numerical excess of disease progression to AML and an increase in 
circulating blasts greater than 10% in patients receiving romiplostim. Of the cases of MDS disease 
progression to AML that were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of MDS at baseline were 
more likely to have disease progression to AML compared to lower risk MDS. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Romiplostim must not be used for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any other cause 
of thrombocytopenia other than ITP outside of clinical trials. 
Loss of response to romiplostim 
A loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim treatment within the 
recommended dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors, including immunogenicity 
(see section 4.8) and increased bone marrow reticulin (see above). 
Effects of romiplostim on red and white blood cells 
Alterations in red (decrease) and white (increase) blood cell parametres have been observed in 
non-clinical toxicology studies (rat and monkey) as well as in ITP patients. Concurrent anaemia and 
leucocytosis (within a 4-week window) may occur in patients regardless of splenectomy status, but 
have been seen more often in patients who have had a prior splenectomy. Monitoring of these 
parametres should be considered in patients treated with romiplostim. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. The potential interactions of romiplostim with 
co-administered medicinal products due to binding to plasma proteins remain unknown. 
Medicinal products used in the treatment of ITP in combination with romiplostim in clinical trials 
included corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and 
anti-D immunoglobulin. Platelet counts should be monitored when combining romiplostim with other 
medicinal products for the treatment of ITP in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the 
recommended range (see section 4.2). 
Corticosteroids, danazol, and azathioprine use may be reduced or discontinued when given in 
combination with romiplostim (see section 5.1). Platelet counts should be monitored when reducing or 
discontinuing other ITP treatments in order to avoid platelet counts below the recommended range 
(see section 4.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of romiplostim in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown that romiplostim crossed the placenta and increased foetal platelet 
counts. Post implantation loss and a slight increase in peri-natal pup mortality also occurred in animal 
studies (see section 5.3). 
Romiplostim is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether romiplostim/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from romiplostim therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for 
the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There is no data available on fertility.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Nplate has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In clinical trials, mild to 
moderate, transient bouts of dizziness were experienced by some patients. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Based on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled 
clinical trials, the overall subject incidence of all adverse reactions for romiplostim-treated subjects 
was 91.5% (248/271). The mean duration of exposure to romiplostim in this study population was 
50 weeks. 
The most serious adverse reactions that may occur during Nplate treatment include: reoccurrence of 
thrombocytopenia and bleeding after cessation of treatment, increased bone marrow reticulin, 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, medication errors and progression of existing MDS to 
AML. The most common adverse reactions observed include hypersensitivity reactions (including 
cases of rash, urticaria and angioedema) and headache. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each MedDRA system organ class and

Adult population with ITP duration up to 12 months 
The safety profile of romiplostim was similar across adult patients, regardless of ITP duration. 
Specifically in the integrated analysis of ITP ≤ 12 months duration (n = 311), 277 adult patients with 
ITP ≤ 12 months duration and who received at least one dose of romiplostim from among those 
patients in 9 ITP studies were included (see also section 5.1). In this integrated analysis, the following 
adverse reactions (at least 5% incidence and at least 5% more frequent with Nplate compared with 
placebo or standard of care) occurred in romiplostim patients with ITP duration up to 12 months, but 
were not observed in those adult patients with ITP duration > 12 months: bronchitis, sinusitis (reported 
commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10)). 
Paediatric population 
In the paediatric studies, 282 paediatric ITP subjects were treated with romiplostim in 2 controlled and 
3 uncontrolled clinical trials. The median duration of exposure was 65.4 weeks. The overall safety 
profile was similar to that seen in adults. 
The paediatric adverse reactions are derived from each of the paediatric ITP randomised safety set 
(2 controlled clinical trials) and paediatric ITP safety set (2 controlled and 3 uncontrolled clinical 
trials) where the subject incidence was at least 5% higher in the romiplostim arm compared to placebo 
and at least a 5% subject incidence in romiplostim-treated subjects. 
The most common adverse reactions in paediatric ITP patients 1 year and older were upper respiratory 
tract infection, rhinitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia, 
contusion (reported very commonly (≥ 1/10)), and pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, 
gastroenteritis, sinusitis, purpura, urticaria and peripheral swelling (reported commonly (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10)). 
Oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, rhinitis, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, sinusitis 
and peripheral swelling were additional adverse reactions observed in paediatric studies compared to 
those seen in adult studies. 
Some of the adverse reactions seen in adults were reported more frequently in paediatric subjects such 
as cough, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and contusion reported very commonly (≥ 1/10) in paediatric 
subjects and purpura and urticaria were reported commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) in paediatric subjects. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
In addition, the reactions listed below have been deemed to be related to romiplostim treatment. 
Bleeding events 
Across the entire adult ITP clinical programme an inverse relationship between bleeding events and 
platelet counts was observed. All clinically significant (≥ grade 3) bleeding events occurred at platelet 
counts < 30 x 109/L. All bleeding events ≥ grade 2 occurred at platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. No 
statistically significant differences in the overall incidence of bleeding events were observed between 
Nplate and placebo treated patients. 
In the two adult placebo-controlled studies, 9 patients reported a bleeding event that was considered 
serious (5 [6.0%] romiplostim, 4 [9.8%] placebo; Odds Ratio [romiplostim/placebo] = 0.59; 95% 
CI = (0.15, 2.31)). Bleeding events that were grade 2 or higher were reported by 15% of patients 
treated with romiplostim and 34% of patients treated with placebo (Odds Ratio; 
[romiplostim/placebo] = 0.35; 95% CI = (0.14, 0.85)). 
In the Phase 3 paediatric study, the mean (SD) number of composite bleeding episodes (see 
section 5.1) was 1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm.

Thrombocytosis 
Based on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled 
clinical trials, 3 events of thrombocytosis were reported, n = 271. No clinical sequelae were reported 
in association with the elevated platelet counts in any of the 3 subjects. 
Thrombocytosis in paediatric subjects occurred uncommonly (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), with a subject 
incidence of 1 (0.4%). Subject incidence was 1 (0.4%) for either grade ≥ 3 or serious thrombocytosis. 
Thrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment 
Based on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled 
clinical trials, 4 events of thrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment were reported, n = 271 (see 
section 4.4). 
Progression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) 
In a randomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS adult subjects treatment with romiplostim was 
prematurely stopped due to a numerical increase in cases of MDS disease progression to AML and 
transient increases in blast cell counts in patients treated with romiplostim compared to placebo. Of the 
cases of MDS disease progression to AML that were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of 
MDS at baseline were more likely to have disease progression to AML (see section 4.4). Overall 
survival was similar to placebo. 
Increased bone marrow reticulin 
In adult clinical trials, romiplostim treatment was discontinued in 4 of the 271 patients because of 
bone marrow reticulin deposition. In 6 additional patients reticulin was observed upon bone marrow 
biopsy (see section 4.4). 
In a paediatric clinical trial (see section 5.1), of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow 
biopsy, 5 out of 27 subjects (18.5%) developed increased reticulin at year 1 after exposure to 
romiplostim (cohort 1) and 17 out of 36 subjects (47.2%) developed increased reticulin at year 2 after 
exposure to romiplostim (cohort 2). However, no subject showed any bone marrow abnormalities that 
were inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP at baseline or on-treatment. 
Immunogenicity 
Clinical trials in adult ITP patients examined antibodies to romiplostim and TPO. While 5.7% 
(60/1,046) and 3.2% (33/1,046) of the subjects were positive for developing binding antibodies to 
romiplostim and TPO respectively, only 4 subjects were positive for neutralising antibodies to 
romiplostim but these antibodies did not cross react with endogenous TPO. Of the 4 subjects, 
2 subjects tested negative for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim at the subject’s last timepoint 
(transient positive) and 2 subjects remained positive at the subject’s last timepoint (persistent 
antibodies). The incidence of pre-existing antibodies to romiplostim and TPO was 3.3% (35/1,046) 
and 3.0% (31/1,046), respectively. 
In paediatric studies, the incidence of binding antibodies to romiplostim at any time was 9.6% 
(27/282). Of the 27 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising romiplostim 
antibodies at baseline. Additionally, 2.8% (8/282) developed neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A 
total of 3.9% (11/282) subjects had binding antibodies to TPO at any time during romiplostim 
treatment. Of these 11 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising antibodies to 
TPO. One subject (0.35%) had a weakly positive postbaseline result for neutralising antibodies against 
TPO while on study (consistently negative for anti-romiplostim antibodies) with a negative result at 
baseline. The subject showed a transient antibody response for neutralising antibodies against TPO, 
with a negative result at the subject’s last timepoint tested within the study period.

In the post-marketing registry study, 19 confirmed paediatric patients were included. The incidence of 
binding antibody post treatment was 16% (3/19) to romiplostim, of which 5.3% (1/19) were positive 
for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. There were no antibodies detected to TPO. A total of 
184 confirmed adult patients were included in this study; for these patients, the incidence of binding 
antibody post treatment was 3.8% (7/184) to romiplostim, of which 0.5% (1/184) was positive for 
neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A total of 2.2% (4/184) adult patients developed binding, 
non-neutralising antibody against TPO. 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. If formation of neutralising 
antibodies is suspected, contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (see 
section 6 of the Package Leaflet) for antibody testing. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No adverse effects were seen in rats given a single dose of 1,000 mcg/kg or in monkeys after repeated 
administration of romiplostim at 500 mcg/kg (100 or 50 times the maximum clinical dose of 
10 mcg/kg, respectively). 
In the event of overdose, platelet counts may increase excessively and result in 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. If the platelet counts are excessively increased, 
discontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts. Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with 
dosing and administration recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, other systemic haemostatics, ATC code: B02BX04 
Mechanism of action 
Romiplostim is an Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that signals and activates intracellular 
transcriptional pathways via the TPO receptor (also known as cMpl) to increase platelet production. 
The peptibody molecule is comprised of a human immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain, with each 
single-chain subunit covalently linked at the C-terminus to a peptide chain containing 2 TPO 
receptor-binding domains. 
Romiplostim has no amino acid sequence homology to endogenous TPO. In pre-clinical and clinical 
trials no anti-romiplostim antibodies cross reacted with endogenous TPO. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety and efficacy of romiplostim have been evaluated for up to 3 years of continuous treatment. 
In clinical trials, treatment with romiplostim resulted in dose-dependent increases in platelet count. 
Time to reach the maximum effect on platelet count is approximately 10-14 days, and is independent 
of the dose. After a single subcutaneous dose of 1 to 10 mcg/kg romiplostim in ITP patients, the peak 
platelet count was 1.3 to 14.9 times greater than the baseline platelet count over a 2 to 3 weeks period 
and the response was variable among patients. The platelet counts of ITP patients who received 
6 weekly doses of 1 or 3 mcg/kg of romiplostim were within the range of 50 to 450 × 109/L for most 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients. Of the 271 patients who received romiplostim in ITP clinical trials, 55 (20%) were age 65 
and over, and 27 (10%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy have been 
observed between older and younger patients in the placebo-controlled studies. 
Results from pivotal placebo-controlled studies 
The safety and efficacy of romiplostim was evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies 
in adults with ITP who had completed at least one treatment prior to study entry and are representative 
of the entire spectrum of such ITP patients. 
Study S1 (20030212) evaluated patients who were non-splenectomised and had an inadequate 
response or were intolerant to prior therapies. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for a median of 
2.1 years (range 0.1 to 31.6) at the time of study entry. Patients had received a median of 3 (range, 1 
to 7) treatments for ITP prior to study entry. Prior treatments included corticosteroids (90% of all 
patients), immunoglobulins (76%), rituximab (29%), cytotoxic therapies (21%), danazol (11%), and 
azathioprine (5%). Patients had a median platelet count of 19 x 109/L at study entry. 
Study S2 (20030105) evaluated patients who were splenectomised and continued to have 
thrombocytopenia. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for a median of 8 years (range 0.6 to 44.8) at 
the time of study entry. In addition to a splenectomy, patients had received a median of 6 (range, 3 
to 10) treatments for ITP prior to study entry. Prior treatments included corticosteroids (98% of all 
patients), immunoglobulins (97%), rituximab (71%), danazol (37%), cytotoxic therapies (68%), and 
azathioprine (24%). Patients had a median platelet count of 14 x 109/L at study entry. 
Both studies were similarly designed. Patients (≥ 18 years) were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a 
starting dose of romiplostim 1 mcg/kg or placebo. Patients received single subcutaneous weekly 
injections for 24 weeks. Doses were adjusted to maintain (50 to 200 x 109/L) platelet counts. In both 
studies, efficacy was determined by an increase in the proportion of patients who achieved a durable 
platelet response. The median average weekly dose for splenectomised patients was 3 mcg/kg and for 
non-splenectomised patients was 2 mcg/kg. 
A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving romiplostim achieved a durable platelet 
response compared to patients receiving placebo in both studies. Following the first 4-weeks of study 
romiplostim maintained platelet counts ≥ 50 x 109/L in between 50% to 70% of patients during the 
6 months treatment period in the placebo-controlled studies. In the placebo group, 0% to 7% of 
patients were able achieve a platelet count response during the 6 months of treatment. A summary of 
the key efficacy endpoints is presented below.

Results of studies in adult patients with newly diagnosed and persistent ITP 
Study S3 (20080435) was a single arm, open label study in adult patients who had an insufficient 
response (platelet count ≤ 30 x 109/L) to first line therapy. The study enrolled 75 patients of whom the 
median age was 39 years (range 19 to 85) and 59% were female.  
The median time from ITP diagnosis to study enrolment was 2.2 months (range 0.1 to 6.6). Sixty 
percent of patients (n = 45) had ITP duration < 3 months and 40% (n = 30) had ITP duration 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
≥ 3 months. The median platelet count at screening was 20 x 109/L. Prior ITP treatments included 
corticosteroids, immunoglobulins and anti D immunoglobulins. Patients already receiving ITP medical 
therapies at a constant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments 
throughout the studies. Rescue therapies (i.e., corticosteroids, IVIG, platelet transfusions, anti D 
immunoglobulin, dapsone, danazol, and azathioprine) were permitted.  
Patients received single weekly SC injections of romiplostim over a 12-month treatment period, with 
individual dose adjustments to maintain platelet counts (50 x 109/L to 200 x 109/L). During the study, 
the median weekly romiplostim dose was 3 mcg/kg (25th 75th percentile: 2-4 mcg/kg).  
Of the 75 patients enrolled in study 20080435, 70 (93%) had a platelet response ≥ 50 x 109/L during 
the 12-month treatment period. The mean number of months with platelet response during the 12-
month treatment period was 9.2 (95% CI: 8.3, 10.1) months; the median was 11 (95% CI: 10, 11) 
months. The Kaplan Meier estimate of the median time to first platelet response was 2.1 weeks (95% 
CI: 1.1, 3.0). Twenty-four (32%) patients had sustained treatment-free remission as defined by 
maintaining every platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L for at least 6 months in the absence of romiplostim and 
any medication for ITP (concomitant or rescue); the median time to onset of maintaining every platelet 
count ≥ 50 x 109/L for at least 6 months was 27 weeks (range 6 to 57). 
In an integrated analysis of efficacy, 277 adult patients with ITP duration ≤ 12 months and who 
received at least one dose of romiplostim from among those patients in 9 ITP studies (inclusive of 
study S3) were included. Of the 277 romiplostim-treated patients, 140 patients had newly diagnosed 
ITP (ITP duration < 3 months) and 137 patients had persistent ITP (ITP duration ≥ 3 to ≤ 12 months). 
The percentage of patients achieving a durable platelet response, defined as at least 6 weekly platelet 
counts of ≥ 50 x 109/L during weeks 18 through 25 of treatment, was 50% (95% CI: 41.4% to 58.6%)  
for the 140 patients with newly diagnosed ITP and 55% (95% CI: 46.7% to 64.0%) for the 137 
patients with persistent ITP. The median (Q1, Q3) percent time with a platelet response ≥ 50 x 109/L 
was 100.0% (70.3%, 100.0%) for patients with newly diagnosed ITP and 93.5% (72.2%, 100.0%) for 
patients with persistent ITP, respectively. Also, the percentage of patients requiring rescue 
medications was 47.4% for patients with newly diagnosed ITP and 44.9% for patients with persistent 
ITP. 
Results of studies compared to standard of care (SOC) in non-splenectomised patients 
Study S4 (20060131) was an open-label randomised 52 week trial in adult subjects who received 
romiplostim or medical standard of care (SOC) treatment. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for a 
median of 2 years (range 0.01 to 44.2) at the time of study entry. This study evaluated 
non-splenectomised patients with ITP and platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. Romiplostim was administered 
to 157 subjects by subcutaneous (SC) injection once weekly starting at a dose of 3 mcg/kg, and 
adjusted throughout the study within a range of 1-10 mcg/kg in order to maintain platelet counts 
between 50 and 200 x 109/L, 77 subjects received SOC treatment according to standard institutional 
practice or therapeutic guidelines. 
The overall subject incidence rate of splenectomy was 8.9% (14 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim 
group compared with 36.4% (28 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs 
SOC) of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.35). 
The overall subject incidence of treatment failure was 11.5% (18 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim 
group compared with 29.9% (23 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs 
SOC) of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.61). 
Of the 157 subjects randomised to the romiplostim group, three subjects did not receive romiplostim. 
Among the 154 subjects who received romiplostim, the total median exposure to romiplostim was 
52.0 weeks and ranged from 2 to 53 weeks. The most frequently used weekly dose was between 
3-5 mcg/kg (25th-75th percentile respectively; median 3 mcg/kg). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 77 subjects randomised to the SOC group, two subjects did not receive any SOC. Among the 
75 subjects who received at least one dose of SOC, the total median exposure to SOC was 51 weeks 
and ranged from 0.4 to 52 weeks. 
Reduction in permitted concurrent ITP medical therapies 
In both adult placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, patients already receiving ITP medical 
therapies at a constant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments 
throughout the study (corticosteroids, danazol and/or azathioprine). Twenty-one non-splenectomised 
and 18 splenectomised patients received on-study ITP medical treatments (primarily corticosteroids) at 
the start of study. All (100%) splenectomised patients who were receiving romiplostim were able to 
reduce the dose by more than 25% or discontinue the concurrent ITP medical therapies by the end of 
the treatment period compared to 17% of placebo treated patients. Seventy-three percent of 
non-splenectomised patients receiving romiplostim were able to reduce the dose by more than 25% or 
discontinue concurrent ITP medical therapies by the end of the study compared to 50% of placebo 
treated patients (see section 4.5). 
Bleeding events 
Across the entire adult ITP clinical programme an inverse relationship between bleeding events and 
platelet counts was observed. All clinically significant (≥ grade 3) bleeding events occurred at platelet 
counts < 30 x 109/L. All bleeding events ≥ grade 2 occurred at platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. No 
statistically significant differences in the overall incidence of bleeding events were observed between 
romiplostim and placebo treated patients. 
In the two adult placebo-controlled studies, 9 patients reported a bleeding event that was considered 
serious (5 [6.0%] romiplostim, 4 [9.8%] placebo; Odds Ratio [romiplostim/placebo] = 0.59; 95% 
CI = (0.15, 2.31)). Bleeding events that were grade 2 or higher were reported by 15% of patients 
treated with romiplostim and 34% of patients treated with placebo (Odds Ratio; 
[romiplostim/placebo] = 0.35; 95% CI = (0.14, 0.85)). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit data for children < 1 year. 
The safety and efficacy of romiplostim was evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. 
Study S5 (20080279) was a phase 3 study with 24 weeks of romiplostim treatment and study S6 
(20060195) was a phase 1/2 study with 12 weeks of romiplostim treatment (up to 16 weeks for eligible 
responders who enter a 4-week pharmacokinetic assessment period). 
Both studies enrolled paediatric subjects (≥ 1 year to < 18 years of age) with thrombocytopenia 
(defined by a mean of 2 platelet counts ≤ 30 x 109/L with neither count > 35 x 109/L in both studies) 
with ITP, regardless of splenectomy status. 
In study S5, 62 subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive romiplostim (n = 42) or placebo 
(n = 20) and stratified into 1 of 3 age cohorts. The starting dose of romiplostim 1 mcg/kg and doses 
were adjusted to maintain (50 to 200 x 109/L) platelet counts. The most frequently used weekly dose 
was 3-10 mcg/kg and the maximum allowed dose on study was 10 mcg/kg. Patients received single 
subcutaneous weekly injections for 24 weeks. Of those 62 subjects, 48 subjects had ITP > 12 months 
of duration (32 subjects received romiplostim and 16 subjects received placebo). 
The primary endpoint was the incidence of durable response, defined as achieving at least 6 weekly 
platelet counts of ≥ 50 x 109/L during weeks 18 through 25 of treatment. Overall, a significant greater 
proportion of subjects in the romiplostim arm achieved the primary endpoint compared with subjects 
in the placebo arm (p = 0.0018). A total of 22 subjects (52%) had durable platelet response in the 
romiplostim arm compared with 2 subjects (10%) in the placebo arm: ≥ 1 to < 6 years 38% versus 
25%; ≥ 6 to < 12 years 56% versus 11%; ≥ 12 to < 18 years 56% versus 0. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the incidence of durable response was also 
significantly greater in the romiplostim arm compared with the placebo arm (p = 0.0022). A total of 
17 subjects (53.1%) had durable platelet response in the romiplostim arm compared with 1 subject 
(6.3%) in the placebo arm: ≥ 1 to < 6 years 28.6% versus 25%; ≥ 6 to < 12 years 63.6% versus 0%; 
≥ 12 to < 18 years 57.1% versus 0%. 
The composite bleeding episode was defined as clinically significant bleeding events or the use of a 
rescue medication to prevent a clinical significant bleeding event during weeks 2 through 25 of the 
treatment period. A clinically significant bleeding event was defined as a Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 grade ≥ 2 bleeding event. The mean (SD) number of 
composite bleeding episodes was 1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm 
with a median (Q1, Q3) number of bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 2) for the romiplostim arm and 
0.5 (0, 4.5) in the placebo arm. In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the mean 
(SD) number of composite bleeding episodes was 2.1 (4.7) for the romiplostim arm and 4.2 (7.5) for 
the placebo arm with a median (Q1, Q3) number of bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 2) for the romiplostim 
arm and 0.0 (0, 4) in the placebo arm. Because the statistical testing for the incidence of rescue 
medication use was not significant, no statistical test was done for the number of composite bleeding 
episodes endpoint. 
In study S6, 22 subjects were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive romiplostim (n = 17) or placebo 
(n = 5). Doses were increased in increments of 2 mcg/kg every 2 weeks and the target platelet count 
was ≥ 50 x 109/L. Treatment with romiplostim resulted in statistically significantly greater incidence 
of platelet response compared with placebo (p = 0.0008). Of those 22 subjects, 17 subjects had 
ITP > 12 months of duration (14 subjects received romiplostim and 3 subjects received placebo). 
Treatment with romiplostim resulted in statistically significantly greater incidence of platelet response 
compared with placebo (p = 0.0147). 
Paediatric subjects who had completed a prior romiplostim study (including study S5) were allowed to 
enrol in study S7 (20090340), an open-label extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 
long-term dosing of romiplostim in thrombocytopenic paediatric subjects with ITP. 
A total of 66 subjects were enrolled in this study, including 54 subjects (82%) who had completed 
study S5. Of these, 65 subjects (98.5%) received at least 1 dose of romiplostim. The median (Q1, Q3) 
duration of treatment was 135.0 weeks (95.0 weeks, 184.0 weeks). The median (Q1, Q3) average 
weekly dose was 4.82 mcg/kg (1.88 mcg/kg, 8.79 mcg/kg). The median (Q1, Q3) of most frequent 
dose received by subjects during the treatment period was 5.0 mcg/kg (1.0 mcg/kg, 10.0 mcg/kg). Of 
the 66 subjects enrolled in the study, 63 subjects had ITP > 12 months of duration. All the 63 subjects 
received at least 1 dose of romiplostim. The median (Q1, Q3) duration of treatment was 138.0 weeks 
(91.1 weeks, 186.0 weeks). The median (Q1, Q3) average weekly dose was 4.82 mcg/kg 
(1.88 mcg/kg, 8.79 mcg/kg). The median (Q1, Q3) of most frequent dose received by subjects during 
the treatment period was 5.0 mcg/kg (1.0 mcg/kg, 10.0 mcg/kg). 
Across the study, the overall subject incidence of platelet response (1 or more platelet count 
≥ 50 x 109/L in the absence of rescue medication) was 93.8% (n = 61) and was similar across age 
groups. Across all subjects, the median (Q1, Q3) number of months with platelet response was 
30.0 months (13.0 months, 43.0 months) and the median (Q1, Q3) time on study was 34.0 months 
(24.0 months, 46.0 months). Across all subjects, the median (Q1, Q3) percentage of months with 
platelet response was 93.33% (67.57%, 100.00%) and was similar across age groups. 
In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the overall subject incidence of platelet 
response was 93.7% (n = 59) and was similar across age groups. Across all subjects, the median (Q1, 
Q3) number of months with platelet response was 30.0 months (13.0 months, 43.0 months) and the 
median (Q1, Q3) time on study was 35.0 months (23.0 months, 47.0 months). Across all subjects, the 
median (Q1, Q3) percentage of months with platelet response was 93.33% (67.57%, 100.00%) and 
was similar across age groups.

A total of 31 subjects (47.7%) used concurrent ITP therapy during the study including 23 subjects 
(35.4%) who used rescue medication and 5 subjects (7.7%) who used concurrent ITP medication at 
baseline. The subject prevalence of concurrent ITP medication use showed a trend towards a reduction 
over the course of the study: from 30.8% (weeks 1 to 12) to < 20.0% (weeks 13 to 240), and then 0% 
from week 240 to the end of the study. 
In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, 29 subjects (46.0%) used concurrent ITP 
therapy during the study including 21 subjects (33.3%) who used rescue medication and 5 subjects 
(7.9%) who used concurrent ITP medication at baseline. The subject prevalence of concurrent ITP 
medication use showed a trend towards a reduction over the course of the study: from 31.7% (weeks 1 
to 12) to < 20.0% (weeks 13 to 240), and then 0% from week 240 to the end of the study. 
The subject prevalence of rescue medication use showed a trend towards a reduction over the course 
of the study: from 24.6% (weeks 1 to 12) to < 13.0% (weeks 13 to 216), then 0% after week 216 until 
the end of the study. Similar reduction of the subject prevalence of rescue medication over the course 
of the study was seen in the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration: from 25.4% (weeks 1 
to 12) to ≤ 13.1% (weeks 13 to 216), then 0% after week 216 until the end of the study. 
Study S8 (20101221) was a phase 3, long-term, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study conducted in 
203 paediatric patients with ITP diagnosed for at least 6 months and who received at least 1 prior ITP 
therapy (excluding romiplostim) or were ineligible for other ITP therapies. Romiplostim was 
administered weekly by subcutaneous injection starting at a dose of 1 mcg/kg with weekly increments 
to a maximum dose of 10 mcg/kg to reach a target platelet count between 50 x 109/L and 200 x 109/L. 
The median age of the patients was 10 years (range 1 to 17 years) and the median duration of 
treatment were 155.9 (range, 8.0 to 163.0) weeks. 
The mean (SD) and median percentage of time with a platelet response (platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L) 
within the first 6 months of initiation of romiplostim without rescue medication use for the past 
4 weeks was 50.57% (37.01) and 50.0%, respectively. Sixty (29.6%) subjects overall received rescue 
medications. Rescue medications (i.e., corticosteroids, platelet transfusions, IVIG, azathioprine, anti-D 
immunoglobulin, and danazol) were permitted. 
Study S8 also evaluated bone marrows for reticulin and collagen formation as well as for 
abnormalities in paediatric patients with ITP receiving romiplostim treatment. The modified 
Bauermeister grading scale was used for reticulin and collagen assessments, whereas cytogenetics and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to evidence bone marrow abnormalities. Based on 
cohort assignment at the time of study enrolment, patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin 
and collagen at year 1 (cohort 1) or year 2 (cohort 2) in comparison to the baseline bone marrow at the 
start of the study. From the total of 79 patients enrolled in the 2 cohorts, 27 of 30 (90%) patients in 
cohort 1 and 36 of 49 (73.5%) patients in cohort 2 had evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsies. 
Increased reticulin fibre formation was reported for 18.5% (5 of 27) of patients in cohort 1 and 47.2% 
(17 of 36) of patients in cohort 2. No patients in either cohort developed collagen fibrosis or a bone 
marrow abnormality that was inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of romiplostim involved target-mediated disposition, which is presumably 
mediated by TPO receptors on platelets and other cells of the thrombopoietic lineage such as 
megakaryocytes. 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration of 3 to 15 mcg/kg romiplostim, maximum romiplostim serum 
levels in ITP patients were obtained after 7-50 hours (median 14 hours). The serum concentrations 
varied among patients and did not correlate with the dose administered. Romiplostim serum levels 
appear inversely related to platelet counts. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of romiplostim following intravenous administration of romiplostim 
decreased nonlinearly from 122, 78.8, to 48.2 mL/kg for intravenous doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 10 mcg/kg, 
respectively in healthy subjects. This non-linear decrease in volume of distribution is in line with the 
(megakaryocyte and platelet) target-mediated binding of romiplostim, which may be saturated at the 
higher doses applied. 
Elimination 
Elimination half-life of romiplostim in ITP patients ranged from 1 to 34 days (median, 3.5 days). 
The elimination of serum romiplostim is in part dependent on the TPO receptor on platelets. As a 
result for a given dose, patients with high platelet counts are associated with low serum concentrations 
and vice versa. In another ITP clinical trial, no accumulation in serum concentrations was observed 
after 6 weekly doses of romiplostim (3 mcg/kg). 
Special populations 
Pharmacokinetics of romiplostim in patients with renal and hepatic impairment has not been 
investigated. Romiplostim pharmacokinetics appear not affected by age, weight and gender to a 
clinically significant extent. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic data of romiplostim were collected from two studies in 21 paediatric subjects with 
ITP. In study S6 (20060195), romiplostim concentrations were available from 17 subjects at doses 
ranging from 1 to 10 mcg/kg. In Study S7 (20090340), intensive romiplostim concentrations were 
available from 4 subjects (2 at 7 mcg/kg and 2 at 9 mcg/kg). Serum concentrations of romiplostim in 
paediatrics with ITP were within the range observed in adult ITP subjects receiving the same dose 
range of romiplostim. Similar to adults with ITP, romiplostim pharmacokinetics are highly variable in 
paediatric subjects with ITP and are not reliable and predictive. However, the data are insufficient to 
draw any meaningful conclusion relating to the impact of dose and age on the pharmacokinetics of 
romiplostim. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Multiple dose romiplostim toxicology studies were conducted in rats for 4 weeks and in monkeys for 
up to 6 months. In general, effects observed during these studies were related to the thrombopoietic 
activity of romiplostim and were similar regardless of study duration. Injection site reactions were also 
related to romiplostim administration. Myelofibrosis has been observed in the bone marrow of rats at 
all tested dose levels. In these studies, myelofibrosis was not observed in animals after a 4-week 
post-treatment recovery period, indicating reversibility. 
In 1-month rat and monkey toxicology studies, a mild decrease in red blood cell count, haematocrit 
and haemoglobin was observed. There was also a stimulatory effect on leukocyte production, as 
peripheral blood counts for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils were mildly 
increased. In the longer duration chronic monkey study, there was no effect on the erythroid and 
leukocytic lineages when romiplostim was administered for 6 months where the administration of 
romiplostim was decreased from thrice weekly to once weekly. Additionally, in the phase 3 pivotal 
studies, romiplostim did not affect the red blood cell and white blood cells lineages relative to placebo 
treated subjects. 
Due to the formation of neutralising antibodies pharmacodynamic effects of romiplostim in rats were 
often decreasing at prolonged duration of administration. Toxicokinetic studies showed no interaction 
of the antibodies with the measured concentrations. Although high doses were tested in the animal 
studies, due to differences between the laboratory species and humans with regard to the sensitivity for 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the pharmacodynamic effect of romiplostim and the effect of neutralising antibodies, safety margins 
cannot be reliably estimated. 
Carcinogenesis 
The carcinogenic potential of romiplostim has not been evaluated. Therefore, the risk of potential 
carcinogenicity of romiplostim in humans remains unknown. 
Reproductive toxicology 
In all developmental studies neutralising antibodies were formed, which may have inhibited 
romiplostim effects. In embryo-foetal development studies in mice and rats, reductions in maternal 
body weight were found only in mice. In mice there was evidence of increased post-implantation loss. 
In a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats an increase of the duration of gestation and a 
slight increase in the incidence of peri-natal pup mortality was found. Romiplostim is known to cross 
the placental barrier in rats and may be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus and 
stimulate foetal platelet production. Romiplostim had no observed effect on the fertility of rats.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Nplate is indicated for the treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult patients who 
are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should remain under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in the treatment of 
haematological diseases. 
Posology 
Nplate should be administered once weekly as a subcutaneous injection. 
Initial dose 
The initial dose of romiplostim is 1 mcg/kg based on actual body weight. 
25

500 mcg 
= Amount to inject in mL 
75 kg patient is initiated at 1 mcg/kg of romiplostim. 
The individual patient dose = 
75 kg x 1 mcg/kg = 75 mcg 
The corresponding amount of Nplate solution to inject = 
75 mcg x
1 mL 
500 mcg 
= 0.15 mL 
*Actual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when calculating dose of romiplostim. 
Future dose adjustments are based on changes in platelet counts only and made in 1 mcg/kg increments (see 
table below). 
Dose adjustments 
A subject’s actual body weight at initiation of therapy should be used to calculate dose. The once 
weekly dose of romiplostim should be increased by increments of 1 mcg/kg until the patient achieves a 
platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L. Platelet counts should be assessed weekly until a stable platelet count 
(≥ 50 x 109/L for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment) has been achieved. Platelet counts should 
be assessed monthly thereafter. A maximum once weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg should not be exceeded. 
Adjust the dose as follows: 
Platelet count 
(x 109/L) 
Action 
< 50 
Increase once weekly dose by 1 mcg/kg  
> 150 for two 
consecutive weeks 
Decrease once weekly dose by 1 mcg/kg 
Do not administer, continue to assess the platelet count weekly 
> 250 
After the platelet count has fallen to < 150 x 109/L, resume dosing with once 
weekly dose reduced by 1 mcg/kg 
Due to the interindividual variable platelet response, in some patients platelet count may abruptly fall 
below 50 x 109/L after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. In these cases, if clinically 
appropriate, higher cut-off levels of platelet count for dose reduction (200 x 109/L) and treatment 
interruption (400 x 109/L) may be considered according to medical judgement. 
A loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim within the recommended 
dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors (see section 4.4, loss of response to 
romiplostim). 
Treatment discontinuation 
Treatment with romiplostim should be discontinued if the platelet count does not increase to a level 
sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after four weeks of romiplostim therapy at the highest 
weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg. 
Patients should be clinically evaluated periodically and continuation of treatment should be decided on 
an individual basis by the treating physician, and in non-splenectomised patients this should include 
evaluation relative to splenectomy. The reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia is likely upon 
discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) 
No overall differences in safety or efficacy have been observed in patients < 65 and ≥ 65 years of age 
(see section 5.1). Although based on these data no adjustment of the dosing regimen is required for 
older patients, care is advised considering the small number of elderly patients included in the clinical 
trials so far. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of romiplostim 250/500 mcg powder and solvent for solution for injection, 
also used for self-administration in eligible adult patients, have not been established in patients aged 
under 18 years. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made. 
Self-administration of romiplostim is not allowed for paediatric patients. No data are available.  
Other pharmaceutical forms/strengths may be more appropriate for administration to this population. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Romiplostim should not be used in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score ≥ 7) unless the expected benefit outweighs the identified risk of portal venous thrombosis in 
patients with thrombocytopenia associated to hepatic insufficiency treated with thrombopoietin (TPO) 
agonists (see section 4.4). 
If the use of romiplostim is deemed necessary, platelet count should be closely monitored to minimise 
the risk of thromboembolic complications. 
Patients with renal impairment 
No formal clinical trials have been conducted in these patient populations. Nplate should be used with 
caution in these populations. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous use. 
After reconstitution of the powder, Nplate solution for injection is administered subcutaneously. The 
injection volume may be very small. Caution should be used during preparation of Nplate in 
calculating the dose and reconstitution with the correct volume of sterile water for injection. Special 
care should be taken to ensure that the appropriate volume of Nplate is withdrawn from the vial for 
subcutaneous administration – a syringe with graduations of 0.01 mL should be used. 
Patients who have a stable platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L for at least 4 weeks without dose adjustment 
may, at the discretion of the supervising physician, self-administer Nplate solution for injection. 
Patients eligible for self-administration of Nplate should be trained in these procedures. 
After the first 4 weeks of self-administration, the patient should again be supervised while 
reconstituting and administering Nplate. Only patients who demonstrate the ability to reconstitute and 
self-administer Nplate are allowed to continue doing so. 
For instructions on reconstitution and administration of the medicinal product, see section 6.6.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Reoccurrence of thrombocytopenia and bleeding after cessation of treatment 
Thrombocytopenia is likely to reoccur upon discontinuation of treatment with romiplostim. There is an 
increased risk of bleeding if romiplostim treatment is discontinued in the presence of anticoagulants or 
anti-platelet agents. Patients should be closely monitored for a decrease in platelet count and medically 
managed to avoid bleeding upon discontinuation of treatment with romiplostim. It is recommended 
that, if treatment with romiplostim is discontinued, ITP treatment be restarted according to current 
treatment guidelines. Additional medical management may include cessation of anticoagulant and/or 
antiplatelet therapy, reversal of anticoagulation, or platelet support. 
Increased bone marrow reticulin 
Increased bone marrow reticulin is believed to be a result of TPO receptor stimulation, leading to an 
increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, which may subsequently release cytokines. 
Increased reticulin may be suggested by morphological changes in the peripheral blood cells and can 
be detected through bone marrow biopsy. Therefore, examinations for cellular morphological 
abnormalities using peripheral blood smear and complete blood count (CBC) prior to and during 
treatment with romiplostim are recommended. See section 4.8 for information on the increases of 
reticulin observed in romiplostim clinical trials. 
If a loss of efficacy and abnormal peripheral blood smear is observed in patients, administration of 
romiplostim should be discontinued, a physical examination should be performed, and a bone marrow 
biopsy with appropriate staining for reticulin should be considered. If available, comparison to a prior 
bone marrow biopsy should be made. If efficacy is maintained and abnormal peripheral blood smear is 
observed in patients, the physician should follow appropriate clinical judgment, including 
consideration of a bone marrow biopsy, and the risk-benefit of romiplostim and alternative ITP 
treatment options should be re-assessed. 
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications 
Platelet counts above the normal range present a risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. 
The incidence of thrombotic/thromboembolic events observed in clinical trials was 6.0% with 
romiplostim and 3.6% with placebo. Caution should be used when administering romiplostim to 
patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism including but not limited to inherited (e.g. 
Factor V Leiden) or acquired risk factors (e.g. ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome), 
advanced age, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, malignancies, contraceptives and 
hormone replacement therapy, surgery/trauma, obesity and smoking. 
Cases of thromboembolic events (TEEs), including portal vein thrombosis, have been reported in 
patients with chronic liver disease receiving romiplostim. Romiplostim should be used with caution in 
these populations. Dose adjustment guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2). 
Medication errors 
Medication errors including overdose and underdose have been reported in patients receiving Nplate, 
dose calculation and dose adjustment guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2). 
Overdose may result in an excessive increase in platelet counts associated with 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. If the platelet counts are excessively increased, 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts. Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with 
dosing and administration recommendations. Underdose may result in lower than expected platelet 
counts and potential for bleeding. Platelet counts should be monitored in patients receiving Nplate (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.9). 
Progression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) 
A positive benefit/risk for romiplostim is only established for the treatment of thrombocytopenia 
associated with ITP (see section 4.1) and romiplostim must not be used in other clinical conditions 
associated with thrombocytopenia. 
The diagnosis of ITP in adults and elderly patients should have been confirmed by the exclusion of 
other clinical entities presenting with thrombocytopenia, in particular the diagnosis of MDS must be 
excluded. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should normally have been done over the course of the 
disease and treatment, particularly in patients over 60 years of age, for those with systemic symptoms 
or abnormal signs such as increased peripheral blast cells. 
In clinical studies of treatment with romiplostim in patients with MDS, cases of transient increases in 
blast cell counts were observed and cases of MDS disease progression to AML were reported. In a 
randomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS subjects, treatment with romiplostim was prematurely 
stopped due to a numerical excess of disease progression to AML and an increase in circulating blasts 
greater than 10% in patients receiving romiplostim. Of the cases of MDS disease progression to AML 
that were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of MDS at baseline were more likely to have 
disease progression to AML compared to lower risk MDS. 
Romiplostim must not be used for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any other cause 
of thrombocytopenia other than ITP outside of clinical trials. 
Loss of response to romiplostim 
A loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim treatment within the 
recommended dosing range should prompt a search for causative factors, including immunogenicity 
(see section 4.8) and increased bone marrow reticulin (see above). 
Effects of romiplostim on red and white blood cells 
Alterations in red (decrease) and white (increase) blood cell parametres have been observed in 
non-clinical toxicology studies (rat and monkey) as well as in ITP patients. Concurrent anaemia and 
leucocytosis (within a 4-week window) may occur in patients regardless of splenectomy status, but 
have been seen more often in patients who have had a prior splenectomy. Monitoring of these 
parametres should be considered in patients treated with romiplostim. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. The potential interactions of romiplostim with 
co-administered medicinal products due to binding to plasma proteins remain unknown. 
Medicinal products used in the treatment of ITP in combination with romiplostim in clinical trials 
included corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and 
anti-D immunoglobulin. Platelet counts should be monitored when combining romiplostim with other 
medicinal products for the treatment of ITP in order to avoid platelet counts outside of the 
recommended range (see section 4.2). 
Corticosteroids, danazol, and azathioprine use may be reduced or discontinued when given in 
combination with romiplostim (see section 5.1). Platelet counts should be monitored when reducing or 
discontinuing other ITP treatments in order to avoid platelet counts below the recommended range 
(see section 4.2).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of romiplostim in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown that romiplostim crossed the placenta and increased foetal platelet 
counts. Post implantation loss and a slight increase in peri-natal pup mortality also occurred in animal 
studies (see section 5.3). 
Romiplostim is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether romiplostim/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from romiplostim therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for 
the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There is no data available on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Nplate has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In clinical trials, mild to 
moderate, transient bouts of dizziness were experienced by some patients. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Based on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled 
clinical trials, the overall subject incidence of all adverse reactions for romiplostim-treated subjects 
was 91.5% (248/271). The mean duration of exposure to romiplostim in this study population was 
50 weeks. 
The most serious adverse reactions that may occur during Nplate treatment include: reoccurrence of 
thrombocytopenia and bleeding after cessation of treatment, increased bone marrow reticulin, 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, medication errors and progression of existing MDS to 
AML. The most common adverse reactions observed include hypersensitivity reactions (including 
cases of rash, urticaria and angioedema) and headache. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each MedDRA system organ class and 
frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing incidence.

** Hypersensitivity reactions including cases of rash, urticaria, and angioedema 
*** Additional adverse reactions observed in paediatric studies 
**** Additional adverse reactions observed in adult patients with ITP duration up to 12 months 
Adult population with ITP duration up to 12 months 
The safety profile of romiplostim was similar across adult patients, regardless of ITP duration. 
Specifically in the integrated analysis of ITP ≤ 12 months duration (n = 311), 277 adult patients with 
ITP ≤ 12 months duration and who received at least one dose of romiplostim from among those 
patients in 9 ITP studies were included (see also section 5.1). In this integrated analysis, the following 
adverse reactions (at least 5% incidence and at least 5% more frequent with Nplate compared with 
placebo or standard of care) occurred in romiplostim patients with ITP duration up to 12 months, but 
were not observed in those adult patients with ITP duration > 12 months: bronchitis, sinusitis (reported 
commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10)). 
Paediatric population 
In the paediatric studies, 282 paediatric ITP subjects were treated with romiplostim in 2 controlled and 
3 uncontrolled clinical trials. The median duration of exposure was 65.4 weeks. The overall safety 
profile was similar to that seen in adults. 
The paediatric adverse reactions are derived from each of the paediatric ITP randomised safety set 
(2 controlled clinical trials) and paediatric ITP safety set (2 controlled and 3 uncontrolled clinical 
trials) where the subject incidence was at least 5% higher in the romiplostim arm compared to placebo 
and at least a 5% subject incidence in romiplostim-treated subjects. 
The most common adverse reactions in paediatric ITP patients 1 year and older were upper respiratory 
tract infection, rhinitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia, 
contusion (reported very commonly (≥ 1/10)), and pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, 
gastroenteritis, sinusitis, purpura, urticaria and peripheral swelling (reported commonly (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10)). 
Oropharyngeal pain, upper abdominal pain, rhinitis, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, ear infection, sinusitis 
and peripheral swelling were additional adverse reactions observed in paediatric studies compared to 
those seen in adult studies. 
Some of the adverse reactions seen in adults were reported more frequently in paediatric subjects such 
as cough, diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and contusion reported very commonly (≥ 1/10) in paediatric 
subjects and purpura and urticaria were reported commonly (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) in paediatric subjects. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
In addition, the reactions listed below have been deemed to be related to romiplostim treatment. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bleeding events 
Across the entire adult ITP clinical programme an inverse relationship between bleeding events and 
platelet counts was observed. All clinically significant (≥ grade 3) bleeding events occurred at platelet 
counts < 30 x 109/L. All bleeding events ≥ grade 2 occurred at platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. No 
statistically significant differences in the overall incidence of bleeding events were observed between 
Nplate and placebo treated patients. 
In the two adult placebo-controlled studies, 9 patients reported a bleeding event that was considered 
serious (5 [6.0%] romiplostim, 4 [9.8%] placebo; Odds Ratio [romiplostim/placebo] = 0.59; 95% 
CI = (0.15, 2.31)). Bleeding events that were grade 2 or higher were reported by 15% of patients 
treated with romiplostim and 34% of patients treated with placebo (Odds Ratio; 
[romiplostim/placebo] = 0.35; 95% CI = (0.14, 0.85)). 
In the Phase 3 paediatric study, the mean (SD) number of composite bleeding episodes (see 
section 5.1) was 1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm. 
Thrombocytosis 
Based on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled 
clinical trials, 3 events of thrombocytosis were reported, n = 271. No clinical sequelae were reported 
in association with the elevated platelet counts in any of the 3 subjects. 
Thrombocytosis in paediatric subjects occurred uncommonly (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), with a subject 
incidence of 1 (0.4%). Subject incidence was 1 (0.4%) for either grade ≥ 3 or serious thrombocytosis. 
Thrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment 
Based on an analysis of all adult ITP patients receiving romiplostim in 4 controlled and 5 uncontrolled 
clinical trials, 4 events of thrombocytopenia after cessation of treatment were reported, n = 271 (see 
section 4.4). 
Progression of existing Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) 
In a randomised placebo-controlled trial in MDS subjects treatment with romiplostim was prematurely 
stopped due to a numerical increase in cases of MDS disease progression to AML and transient 
increases in blast cell counts in patients treated with romiplostim compared to placebo. Of the cases of 
MDS disease progression to AML that were observed, patients with RAEB-1 classification of MDS at 
baseline were more likely to have disease progression to AML (see section 4.4). Overall survival was 
similar to placebo. 
Increased bone marrow reticulin 
In clinical trials, romiplostim treatment was discontinued in 4 of the 271 patients because of bone 
marrow reticulin deposition. In 6 additional patients reticulin was observed upon bone marrow biopsy 
(see section 4.4). 
In a paediatric clinical trial (see section 5.1), of the subjects with an evaluable on-study bone marrow 
biopsy, 5 out of 27 subjects (18.5%) developed increased reticulin at year 1 after exposure to 
romiplostim (cohort 1) and 17 out of 36 subjects (47.2%) developed increased reticulin at year 2 after 
exposure to romiplostim (cohort 2). However, no subject showed any bone marrow abnormalities that 
were inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP at baseline or on-treatment. 
Immunogenicity 
Clinical trials in adult ITP patients examined antibodies to romiplostim and TPO. While 5.7% 
(60/1,046) and 3.2% (33/1,046) of the subjects were positive for developing binding antibodies to 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
romiplostim and TPO respectively, only 4 subjects were positive for neutralising antibodies to 
romiplostim but these antibodies did not cross react with endogenous TPO. Of the 4 subjects, 
2 subjects tested negative for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim at the subject’s last timepoint 
(transient positive) and 2 subjects remained positive at the subject’s last timepoint (persistent 
antibodies). The incidence of pre-existing antibodies to romiplostim and TPO was 3.3% (35/1,046) 
and 3.0% (31/1,046), respectively. 
In paediatric studies, the incidence of binding antibodies to romiplostim at any time was 9.6% 
(27/282). Of the 27 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising romiplostim 
antibodies at baseline. Additionally, 2.8% (8/282) developed neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A 
total of 3.9% (11/282) subjects had binding antibodies to TPO at any time during romiplostim 
treatment. Of these 11 subjects, 2 subjects had pre-existing binding non-neutralising antibodies to 
TPO. One subject (0.35%) had a weakly positive postbaseline result for neutralising antibodies against 
TPO while on study (consistently negative for anti-romiplostim antibodies) with a negative result at 
baseline. The subject showed a transient antibody response for neutralising antibodies against TPO, 
with a negative result at the subject’s last timepoint tested within the study period. 
In the post-marketing registry study, 19 confirmed paediatric patients were included. The incidence of 
binding antibody post treatment was 16% (3/19) to romiplostim, of which 5.3% (1/19) were positive 
for neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. There were no antibodies detected to TPO. A total of 
184 confirmed adult patients were included in this study; for these patients, the incidence of binding 
antibody post treatment was 3.8% (7/184) to romiplostim, of which 0.5% (1/184) was positive for 
neutralising antibodies to romiplostim. A total of 2.2% (4/184) adult patients developed binding, 
non-neutralising antibody against TPO. 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. If formation of neutralising 
antibodies is suspected, contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (see 
section 6 of the Package Leaflet) for antibody testing. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No adverse effects were seen in rats given a single dose of 1,000 mcg/kg or in monkeys after repeated 
administration of romiplostim at 500 mcg/kg (100 or 50 times the maximum clinical dose of 
10 mcg/kg, respectively). 
In the event of overdose, platelet counts may increase excessively and result in 
thrombotic/thromboembolic complications. If the platelet counts are excessively increased, 
discontinue Nplate and monitor platelet counts. Reinitiate treatment with Nplate in accordance with 
dosing and administration recommendations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Romiplostim is an Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that signals and activates intracellular 
transcriptional pathways via the TPO receptor (also known as cMpl) to increase platelet production. 
The peptibody molecule is comprised of a human immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain, with each 
single-chain subunit covalently linked at the C-terminus to a peptide chain containing 2 TPO 
receptor-binding domains. 
Romiplostim has no amino acid sequence homology to endogenous TPO. In pre-clinical and clinical 
trials no anti-romiplostim antibodies cross reacted with endogenous TPO. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety and efficacy of romiplostim have been evaluated for up to 3 years of continuous treatment. 
In clinical trials, treatment with romiplostim resulted in dose-dependent increases in platelet count. 
Time to reach the maximum effect on platelet count is approximately 10-14 days, and is independent 
of the dose. After a single subcutaneous dose of 1 to 10 mcg/kg romiplostim in ITP patients, the peak 
platelet count was 1.3 to 14.9 times greater than the baseline platelet count over a 2 to 3 weeks period 
and the response was variable among patients. The platelet counts of ITP patients who received 
6 weekly doses of 1 or 3 mcg/kg of romiplostim were within the range of 50 to 450 x 109/L for most 
patients. Of the 271 patients who received romiplostim in ITP clinical trials, 55 (20%) were age 65 
and over, and 27 (10%) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or efficacy have been 
observed between older and younger patients in the placebo-controlled studies. 
Results from pivotal placebo-controlled studies 
The safety and efficacy of romiplostim was evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies 
in adults with ITP who had completed at least one treatment prior to study entry and are representative 
of the entire spectrum of such ITP patients. 
Study S1 (20030212) evaluated patients who were non-splenectomised and had an inadequate 
response or were intolerant to prior therapies. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for a median of 
2.1 years (range 0.1 to 31.6) at the time of study entry. Patients had received a median of 3 (range, 1 
to 7) treatments for ITP prior to study entry. Prior treatments included corticosteroids (90% of all 
patients), immunoglobulins (76%), rituximab (29%), cytotoxic therapies (21%), danazol (11%), and 
azathioprine (5%). Patients had a median platelet count of 19 x 109/L at study entry. 
Study S2 (20030105) evaluated patients who were splenectomised and continued to have 
thrombocytopenia. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for a median of 8 years (range 0.6 to 44.8) at 
the time of study entry. In addition to a splenectomy, patients had received a median of 6 (range, 3 
to 10) treatments for ITP prior to study entry. Prior treatments included corticosteroids (98% of all 
patients), immunoglobulins (97%), rituximab (71%), danazol (37%), cytotoxic therapies (68%), and 
azathioprine (24%). Patients had a median platelet count of 14 x 109/L at study entry. 
Both studies were similarly designed. Patients (≥ 18 years) were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a 
starting dose of romiplostim 1 mcg/kg or placebo. Patients received single subcutaneous weekly 
injections for 24 weeks. Doses were adjusted to maintain (50 to 200 x 109/L) platelet counts. In both 
studies, efficacy was determined by an increase in the proportion of patients who achieved a durable 
platelet response. The median average weekly dose for splenectomised patients was 3 mcg/kg and for 
non-splenectomised patients was 2 mcg/kg. 
A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving romiplostim achieved a durable platelet 
response compared to patients receiving placebo in both studies. Following the first 4-weeks of study 
romiplostim maintained platelet counts ≥ 50 x 109/L in between 50% to 70% of patients during the 
6 months treatment period in the placebo-controlled studies. In the placebo group, 0% to 7% of 
patients were able achieve a platelet count response during the 6 months of treatment. A summary of 
the key efficacy endpoints is presented below.

d Rescue therapies defined as any therapy administered to raise platelet counts. Patients requiring rescue 
medicinal products were not considered for durable platelet response. Rescue therapies allowed in the study were 
IVIG, platelet transfusions, anti-D immunoglobulin, and corticosteroids. 
e Stable dose defined as dose maintained within ± 1 mcg/kg during the last 8 weeks of treatment. 
Results of studies in adult patients with newly diagnosed and persistent ITP 
Study S3 (20080435) was a single arm, open label study in adult patients who had an insufficient 
response (platelet count ≤ 30 x 109/L) to first line therapy. The study enrolled 75 patients of whom the 
median age was 39 years (range 19 to 85) and 59% were female.  
The median time from ITP diagnosis to study enrolment was 2.2 months (range 0.1 to 6.6). Sixty 
percent of patients (n = 45) had ITP duration < 3 months and 40% (n = 30) had ITP duration 
≥ 3 months. The median platelet count at screening was 20 x 109/L. Prior ITP treatments included 
corticosteroids, immunoglobulins and anti D immunoglobulins. Patients already receiving ITP medical 
therapies at a constant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments 
throughout the studies. Rescue therapies (i.e., corticosteroids, IVIG, platelet transfusions, anti D 
immunoglobulin, dapsone, danazol, and azathioprine) were permitted.  
Patients received single weekly SC injections of romiplostim over a 12-month treatment period, with 
individual dose adjustments to maintain platelet counts (50 x 109/L to 200 x 109/L). During the study, 
the median weekly romiplostim dose was 3 mcg/kg (25th-75th percentile: 2-4 mcg/kg).  
Of the 75 patients enrolled in study 20080435, 70 (93%) had a platelet response ≥ 50 x 109/L during 
the 12-month treatment period. The mean number of months with platelet response during the 12-
month treatment period was 9.2 (95% CI: 8.3, 10.1) months; the median was 11 (95% CI: 10, 11) 
months. The Kaplan Meier estimate of the median time to first platelet response was 2.1 weeks (95% 
CI: 1.1, 3.0). Twenty-four (32%) patients had sustained treatment-free remission as defined by 
maintaining every platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L for at least 6 months in the absence of romiplostim and 
any medication for ITP (concomitant or rescue); the median time to onset of maintaining every platelet 
count ≥ 50 x 109/L for at least 6 months was 27 weeks (range 6 to 57). 
In an integrated analysis of efficacy, 277 adult patients with ITP duration ≤ 12 months and who 
received at least one dose of romiplostim from among those patients in 9 ITP studies (inclusive of 
study S3) were included. Of the 277 romiplostim-treated patients, 140 patients had newly diagnosed 
ITP (ITP duration < 3 months) and 137 patients had persistent ITP (ITP duration ≥ 3 to ≤ 12 months). 
The percentage of patients achieving a durable platelet response, defined as at least 6 weekly platelet 
counts of ≥ 50 x 109/L during weeks 18 through 25 of treatment, was 50% (95% CI: 41.4% to 58.6%)  
for the 140 patients with newly diagnosed ITP and 55% (95% CI: 46.7% to 64.0%) for the 137 
patients with persistent ITP. The median (Q1, Q3) percent time with a platelet response ≥ 50 x 109/L 
was 100.0% (70.3%, 100.0%) for patients with newly diagnosed ITP and 93.5% (72.2%, 100.0%) for 
patients with persistent ITP, respectively. Also, the percentage of patients requiring rescue 
medications was 47.4% for patients with newly diagnosed ITP and 44.9% for patients with persistent 
ITP. 
Results of studies compared to standard of care (SOC) in non-splenectomised patients 
Study S4 (20060131) was an open-label randomised 52 week trial in subjects who received 
romiplostim or medical standard of care (SOC) treatment. Patients had been diagnosed with ITP for a 
median of 2 years (range 0.01 to 44.2) at the time of study entry. This study evaluated 
non-splenectomised patients with ITP and platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. Romiplostim was administered 
to 157 subjects by subcutaneous (SC) injection once weekly starting at a dose of 3 mcg/kg, and 
adjusted throughout the study within a range of 1-10 mcg/kg in order to maintain platelet counts 
between 50 and 200 x 109/L, 77 subjects received SOC treatment according to standard institutional 
practice or therapeutic guidelines.

The overall subject incidence rate of splenectomy was 8.9% (14 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim 
group compared with 36.4% (28 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs 
SOC) of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.35). 
The overall subject incidence of treatment failure was 11.5% (18 of 157 subjects) in the romiplostim 
group compared with 29.9% (23 of 77 subjects) in the SOC group, with an odds ratio (romiplostim vs 
SOC) of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.61). 
Of the 157 subjects randomised to the romiplostim group, three subjects did not receive romiplostim. 
Among the 154 subjects who received romiplostim, the total median exposure to romiplostim was 
52.0 weeks and ranged from 2 to 53 weeks. The most frequently used weekly dose was between 
3-5 mcg/kg (25th-75th percentile respectively; median 3 mcg/kg). 
Of the 77 subjects randomised to the SOC group, two subjects did not receive any SOC. Among the 
75 subjects who received at least one dose of SOC, the total median exposure to SOC was 51 weeks 
and ranged from 0.4 to 52 weeks. 
Reduction in permitted concurrent ITP medical therapies 
In both placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, patients already receiving ITP medical therapies at a 
constant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments throughout the 
study (corticosteroids, danazol and/or azathioprine). Twenty-one non-splenectomised and 
18 splenectomised patients received on-study ITP medical treatments (primarily corticosteroids) at the 
start of study. All (100%) splenectomised patients who were receiving romiplostim were able to 
reduce the dose by more than 25% or discontinue the concurrent ITP medical therapies by the end of 
the treatment period compared to 17% of placebo treated patients. Seventy-three percent of 
non-splenectomised patients receiving romiplostim were able to reduce the dose by more than 25% or 
discontinue concurrent ITP medical therapies by the end of the study compared to 50% of placebo 
treated patients (see section 4.5). 
Bleeding events 
Across the entire ITP clinical programme an inverse relationship between bleeding events and platelet 
counts was observed. All clinically significant (≥ grade 3) bleeding events occurred at platelet counts 
< 30 x 109/L. All bleeding events ≥ grade 2 occurred at platelet counts < 50 x 109/L. No statistically 
significant differences in the overall incidence of bleeding events were observed between romiplostim 
and placebo treated patients. 
In the two placebo-controlled studies, 9 patients reported a bleeding event that was considered serious 
(5 [6.0%] romiplostim, 4 [9.8%] placebo; Odds Ratio [romiplostim/placebo] = 0.59; 95% CI = (0.15, 
2.31)). Bleeding events that were grade 2 or higher were reported by 15% of patients treated with 
romiplostim and 34% of patients treated with placebo (Odds Ratio; [romiplostim/placebo] = 0.35; 95% 
CI = (0.14, 0.85)). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit data for children < 1 year. 
The safety and efficacy of romiplostim was evaluated in two placebo-controlled, double-blind studies. 
Study S5 (20080279) was a phase 3 study with 24 weeks of romiplostim treatment and study S6 
(20060195) was a phase 1/2 study with 12 weeks of romiplostim treatment (up to 16 weeks for eligible 
responders who enter a 4-week pharmacokinetic assessment period). 
Both studies enrolled paediatric subjects (≥ 1 year to < 18 years of age) with thrombocytopenia 
(defined by a mean of 2 platelet counts ≤ 30 x 109/L with neither count > 35 x 109/L in both studies) 
with ITP, regardless of splenectomy status. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study S5, 62 subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive romiplostim (n = 42) or placebo 
(n = 20) and stratified into 1 of 3 age cohorts. The starting dose of romiplostim 1 mcg/kg and doses 
were adjusted to maintain (50 to 200 x 109/L) platelet counts. The most frequently used weekly dose 
was 3-10 mcg/kg and the maximum allowed dose on study was 10 mcg/kg. Patients received single 
subcutaneous weekly injections for 24 weeks. Of those 62 subjects, 48 subjects had ITP > 12 months 
of duration (32 subjects received romiplostim and 16 subjects received placebo). 
The primary endpoint was the incidence of durable response, defined as achieving at least 6 weekly 
platelet counts of ≥ 50 x 109/L during weeks 18 through 25 of treatment. Overall, a significant greater 
proportion of subjects in the romiplostim arm achieved the primary endpoint compared with subjects 
in the placebo arm (p = 0.0018). A total of 22 subjects (52%) had durable platelet response in the 
romiplostim arm compared with 2 subjects (10%) in the placebo arm: ≥ 1 to < 6 years 38% versus 
25%; ≥ 6 to < 12 years 56% versus 11%; ≥ 12 to < 18 years 56% versus 0. 
In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the incidence of durable response was also 
significantly greater in the romiplostim arm compared with the placebo arm (p = 0.0022). A total of 
17 subjects (53.1%) had durable platelet response in the romiplostim arm compared with 1 subject 
(6.3%) in the placebo arm: ≥ 1 to < 6 years 28.6% versus 25%; ≥ 6 to < 12 years 63.6% versus 0%; 
≥ 12 to < 18 years 57.1% versus 0%. 
The composite bleeding episode was defined as clinically significant bleeding events or the use of a 
rescue medication to prevent a clinical significant bleeding event during weeks 2 through 25 of the 
treatment period. A clinically significant bleeding event was defined as a Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 grade ≥ 2 bleeding event. The mean (SD) number of 
composite bleeding episodes was 1.9 (4.2) for the romiplostim arm and 4.0 (6.9) for the placebo arm 
with a median (Q1, Q3) number of bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 2) for the romiplostim arm and 
0.5 (0, 4.5) in the placebo arm. In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the mean 
(SD) number of composite bleeding episodes was 2.1 (4.7) for the romiplostim arm and 4.2 (7.5) for 
the placebo arm with a median (Q1, Q3) number of bleeding events of 0.0 (0, 2) for the romiplostim 
arm and 0.0 (0, 4) in the placebo arm. Because the statistical testing for the incidence of rescue 
medication use was not significant, no statistical test was done for the number of composite bleeding 
episodes endpoint. 
In study S6, 22 subjects were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive romiplostim (n = 17) or placebo 
(n = 5). Doses were increased in increments of 2 mcg/kg every 2 weeks and the target platelet count 
was ≥ 50 x 109/L. Treatment with romiplostim resulted in statistically significantly greater incidence 
of platelet response compared with placebo (p = 0.0008). Of those 22 subjects, 17 subjects had 
ITP > 12 months of duration (14 subjects received romiplostim and 3 subjects received placebo). 
Treatment with romiplostim resulted in statistically significantly greater incidence of platelet response 
compared with placebo (p = 0.0147). 
Paediatric subjects who had completed a prior romiplostim study (including study S5) were allowed to 
enrol in study S7 (20090340), an open-label extension study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 
long-term dosing of romiplostim in thrombocytopenic paediatric subjects with ITP. 
A total of 66 subjects were enrolled in this study, including 54 subjects (82%) who had completed 
study S5. Of these, 65 subjects (98.5%) received at least 1 dose of romiplostim. The median (Q1, Q3) 
duration of treatment was 135.0 weeks (95.0 weeks, 184.0 weeks). The median (Q1, Q3) average 
weekly dose was 4.82 mcg/kg (1.88 mcg/kg, 8.79 mcg/kg). The median (Q1, Q3) of most frequent 
dose received by subjects during the treatment period was 5.0 mcg/kg (1.0 mcg/kg, 10.0 mcg/kg). Of 
the 66 subjects enrolled in the study, 63 subjects had ITP > 12 months of duration. All the 63 subjects 
received at least 1 dose of romiplostim. The median (Q1, Q3) duration of treatment was 138.0 weeks 
(91.1 weeks, 186.0 weeks). The median (Q1, Q3) average weekly dose was 4.82 mcg/kg 
(1.88 mcg/kg, 8.79 mcg/kg). The median (Q1, Q3) of most frequent dose received by subjects during 
the treatment period was 5.0 mcg/kg (1.0 mcg/kg, 10.0 mcg/kg).

Across the study, the overall subject incidence of platelet response (1 or more platelet count 
≥ 50 x 109/L in the absence of rescue medication) was 93.8% (n = 61) and was similar across age 
groups. Across all subjects, the median (Q1, Q3) number of months with platelet response was 
30.0 months (13.0 months, 43.0 months) and the median (Q1, Q3) time on study was 34.0 months 
(24.0 months, 46.0 months). Across all subjects, the median (Q1, Q3) percentage of months with 
platelet response was 93.33% (67.57%, 100.00%) and was similar across age groups. 
In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, the overall subject incidence of platelet 
response was 93.7% (n = 59) and was similar across age groups. Across all subjects, the median (Q1, 
Q3) number of months with platelet response was 30.0 months (13.0 months, 43.0 months) and the 
median (Q1, Q3) time on study was 35.0 months (23.0 months, 47.0 months). Across all subjects, the 
median (Q1, Q3) percentage of months with platelet response was 93.33% (67.57%, 100.00%) and 
was similar across age groups. 
A total of 31 subjects (47.7%) used concurrent ITP therapy during the study including 23 subjects 
(35.4%) who used rescue medication and 5 subjects (7.7%) who used concurrent ITP medication at 
baseline. The subject prevalence of concurrent ITP medication use showed a trend towards a reduction 
over the course of the study: from 30.8% (weeks 1 to 12) to < 20.0% (weeks 13 to 240), and then 0% 
from week 240 to the end of the study. 
In the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration, 29 subjects (46.0%) used concurrent ITP 
therapy during the study including 21 subjects (33.3%) who used rescue medication and 5 subjects 
(7.9%) who used concurrent ITP medication at baseline. The subject prevalence of concurrent ITP 
medication use showed a trend towards a reduction over the course of the study: from 31.7% (weeks 1 
to 12) to < 20.0% (weeks 13 to 240), and then 0% from week 240 to the end of the study. 
The subject prevalence of rescue medication use showed a trend towards a reduction over the course 
of the study: from 24.6% (weeks 1 to 12) to < 13.0% (weeks 13 to 216), then 0% after week 216 until 
the end of the study. Similar reduction of the subject prevalence of rescue medication over the course 
of the study was seen in the subset of subjects with ITP > 12 months of duration: from 25.4% (weeks 1 
to 12) to ≤ 13.1% (weeks 13 to 216), then 0% after week 216 until the end of the study. 
Study S8 (20101221) was a phase 3, long-term, single-arm, open-label, multicentre study conducted in 
203 paediatric patients with ITP diagnosed for at least 6 months and who received at least 1 prior ITP 
therapy (excluding romiplostim) or were ineligible for other ITP therapies. Romiplostim was 
administered weekly by subcutaneous injection starting at a dose of 1 mcg/kg with weekly increments 
to a maximum dose of 10 mcg/kg to reach a target platelet count between 50 x 109/L and 200 x 109/L. 
The median age of the patients was 10 years (range, 1 to 17 years) and the median duration of 
treatment were 155.9 (range, 8.0 to 163.0) weeks. 
The mean (SD) and median percentage of time with a platelet response (platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L) 
within the first 6 months of initiation of romiplostim without rescue medication use for the past 
4 weeks was 50.57% (37.01) and 50.0%, respectively. Sixty (29.6%) subjects overall received rescue 
medications. Rescue medications (i.e., corticosteroids, platelet transfusions, IVIG, azathioprine, anti-D 
immunoglobulin, and danazol) were permitted. 
Study S8 also evaluated bone marrows for reticulin and collagen formation as well as for 
abnormalities in paediatric patients with ITP receiving romiplostim treatment. The modified 
Bauermeister grading scale was used for reticulin and collagen assessments, whereas cytogenetics and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to evidence bone marrow abnormalities. Based on 
cohort assignment at the time of study enrolment, patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin 
and collagen at year 1 (cohort 1) or year 2 (cohort 2) in comparison to the baseline bone marrow at the 
start of the study. From the total of 79 patients enrolled in the 2 cohorts, 27 of 30 (90%) patients in 
cohort 1 and 36 of 49 (73.5%) patients in cohort 2 had evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsies. 
Increased reticulin fibre formation was reported for 18.5% (5 of 27) of patients in cohort 1 and 47.2% 
(17 of 36) of patients in cohort 2. No patients in either cohort developed collagen fibrosis or a bone 
marrow abnormality that was inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of romiplostim involved target-mediated disposition, which is presumably 
mediated by TPO receptors on platelets and other cells of the thrombopoietic lineage such as 
megakaryocytes. 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration of 3 to 15 mcg/kg romiplostim, maximum romiplostim serum 
levels in ITP patients were obtained after 7-50 hours (median 14 hours). The serum concentrations 
varied among patients and did not correlate with the dose administered. Romiplostim serum levels 
appear inversely related to platelet counts. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of romiplostim following intravenous administration of romiplostim 
decreased nonlinearly from 122, 78.8, to 48.2 mL/kg for intravenous doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 10 mcg/kg, 
respectively in healthy subjects. This non-linear decrease in volume of distribution is in line with the 
(megakaryocyte and platelet) target-mediated binding of romiplostim, which may be saturated at the 
higher doses applied. 
Elimination 
Elimination half-life of romiplostim in ITP patients ranged from 1 to 34 days (median, 3.5 days). 
The elimination of serum romiplostim is in part dependent on the TPO receptor on platelets. As a 
result for a given dose, patients with high platelet counts are associated with low serum concentrations 
and vice versa. In another ITP clinical trial, no accumulation in serum concentrations was observed 
after 6 weekly doses of romiplostim (3 mcg/kg). 
Special populations 
Pharmacokinetics of romiplostim in patients with renal and hepatic impairment has not been 
investigated. Romiplostim pharmacokinetics appear not affected by age, weight and gender to a 
clinically significant extent. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Multiple dose romiplostim toxicology studies were conducted in rats for 4 weeks and in monkeys for 
up to 6 months. In general, effects observed during these studies were related to the thrombopoietic 
activity of romiplostim and were similar regardless of study duration. Injection site reactions were also 
related to romiplostim administration. Myelofibrosis has been observed in the bone marrow of rats at 
all tested dose levels. In these studies, myelofibrosis was not observed in animals after a 4-week 
post-treatment recovery period, indicating reversibility. 
In 1-month rat and monkey toxicology studies, a mild decrease in red blood cell count, haematocrit 
and haemoglobin was observed. There was also a stimulatory effect on leukocyte production, as 
peripheral blood counts for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils were mildly 
increased. In the longer duration chronic monkey study, there was no effect on the erythroid and 
leukocytic lineages when romiplostim was administered for 6 months where the administration of 
romiplostim was decreased from thrice weekly to once weekly. Additionally, in the phase 3 pivotal 
studies, romiplostim did not affect the red blood cell and white blood cells lineages relative to placebo 
treated subjects. 
Due to the formation of neutralising antibodies pharmacodynamic effects of romiplostim in rats were 
often decreasing at prolonged duration of administration. Toxicokinetic studies showed no interaction 
of the antibodies with the measured concentrations. Although high doses were tested in the animal 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studies, due to differences between the laboratory species and humans with regard to the sensitivity for 
the pharmacodynamic effect of romiplostim and the effect of neutralising antibodies, safety margins 
cannot be reliably estimated. 
Carcinogenesis 
The carcinogenic potential of romiplostim has not been evaluated. Therefore, the risk of potential 
carcinogenicity of romiplostim in humans remains unknown. 
Reproductive toxicology 
In all developmental studies neutralising antibodies were formed, which may have inhibited 
romiplostim effects. In embryo-foetal development studies in mice and rats, reductions in maternal 
body weight were found only in mice. In mice there was evidence of increased post-implantation loss. 
In a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats an increase of the duration of gestation and a 
slight increase in the incidence of peri-natal pup mortality was found. Romiplostim is known to cross 
the placental barrier in rats and may be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus and 
stimulate foetal platelet production. Romiplostim had no observed effect on the fertility of rats.

Possible side effects 
How to store Nplate 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Nplate is and what it is used for 
Nplate’s active ingredient is romiplostim, which is a protein used to treat low platelet counts in 
patients with immune primary thrombocytopenia (called ITP). ITP is a disease in which your body’s 
immune system destroys its own platelets. Platelets are the cells in your blood that help seal cuts and 
form blood clots. Very low platelet counts can cause bruising and serious bleeding. 
Nplate is used to treat adult patients with ITP who may or may not have had their spleen removed and 
who have been previously treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulins, where these treatments 
don’t work. Nplate is also used to treat children aged 1 year and over with chronic ITP who may or 
may not have had their spleen removed and who have been previously treated with corticosteroids or 
immunoglobulins, where these treatments don’t work. 
Nplate works by stimulating the bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce 
more platelets. This should help to prevent bruising and bleeding associated with ITP. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Nplate 
Do not use Nplate: 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to romiplostim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are allergic to other medicines that are produced by DNA technology using the 
micro-organism Escherichia coli (E. coli). 
Warnings and precautions 
• 
If you stop taking Nplate a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. If 
you stop taking Nplate your platelet count will have to be monitored, and your doctor will 
discuss appropriate precautions with you. 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
If you are at risk of blood clots or if blood clots are common in your family. The risk of blood 
clotting may also be increased if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have liver problems; 
are elderly (≥ 65 years); 
are bedridden; 
have cancer; 
are taking the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy; 
have recently had surgery or suffered an injury; 
are obese (overweight); 
are a smoker. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Nplate. 
If you have very high blood platelet counts this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Your doctor 
will adjust your dose of Nplate to ensure that your platelet count does not become too high. 
Bone marrow changes (increased reticulin and possible bone marrow fibrosis) 
Long-term use of Nplate may cause changes in your bone marrow. These changes may lead to 
abnormal blood cells or your body making less blood cells. The mild form of these bone marrow 
changes is called “increased reticulin” and has been observed in Nplate clinical trials. It is not known 
if this may progress to a more severe form called “fibrosis.” Signs of bone marrow changes may show 
up as abnormalities in your blood tests. Your doctor will decide if abnormal blood tests mean that you 
should have bone marrow tests or if you should stop taking Nplate. 
Worsening of blood cancers 
Your doctor may decide to take a bone marrow biopsy if they decide it is necessary to ensure that you 
have ITP, and not another condition such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). If you have MDS and 
receive Nplate you may have an increase in your blast cell counts and your MDS condition may 
worsen to become an acute myeloid leukaemia, which is a type of cancer of the blood. 
Loss of response to romiplostim 
If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim 
treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you are experiencing 
increased bone marrow fibres (reticulin) or have developed antibodies which neutralise romiplostim’s 
activity. 
Children and adolescents 
Nplate is not recommended for use in children aged under 1 year. 
Other medicines and Nplate 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
If you are also taking medicines which prevent blood clots (anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy) 
there is a greater risk of bleeding. Your doctor will discuss this with you. 
If you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, which you may be receiving to treat 
your ITP, these may be reduced or stopped when given together with Nplate. 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Nplate is not recommended for use if 
you are pregnant unless indicated by your doctor. 
It is not known whether romiplostim is present in human milk. Nplate is not recommended for use if 
you are breast-feeding. A decision on whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue therapy 
with romiplostim should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to your child and 
the benefit of romiplostim therapy to you. 
Driving and using machines 
You should speak with your doctor before driving or using machines, as some side effects (e.g. 
temporary bouts of dizziness) may impair your ability to do so safely. 
3. 
How to use Nplate 
Adult and children (1 to 17 years): 
Nplate will be given under the direct supervision of your doctor, who will closely control the amount 
of Nplate given to you. 
Nplate is administered once a week as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). 
Your initial dose is 1 microgram of Nplate per kilogram of your body weight once a week. Your 
doctor will tell you how much you must take. Nplate should be injected once per week in order to keep 
your platelet counts up. Your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your platelets are 
responding and may adjust your dose as necessary. 
Once your platelet count is under control, your doctor will continue to regularly check your blood. 
Your dose may be adjusted further in order to maintain long-term control of your platelet count. 
Children (1 to 17 years old): in addition to adjusting your dose based on platelet counts, your doctor 
will also regularly reassess your body weight in order to adjust your dose. 
If you use more Nplate than you should 
Your doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given more 
Nplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts 
may rise to very high levels and this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Therefore if your doctor 
suspects that you have been given more Nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment 
immediately. 
If you use less Nplate than you should 
Your doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given less 
Nplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts 
may become low and this may increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore if your doctor suspects that you 
have been given less Nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are monitored for any signs 
or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment immediately. 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use Nplate 
If you have missed a dose of Nplate, your doctor will discuss with you when you should have your 
next dose. 
If you stop using Nplate 
If you stop using Nplate, your low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. Your 
doctor will decide if you should stop using Nplate.

Sterile water for injections only should be used when reconstituting the medicinal product. Sodium 
chloride solutions or bacteriostatic water should not be used when reconstituting the medicine. 
Water for injections should be injected into the vial. The vial contents may be swirled gently and 
inverted during dissolution. The vial should not be shaken or vigorously agitated. Generally, 
dissolution of Nplate takes less than 2 minutes. Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and 
discolouration before administration. The reconstituted solution should be clear and colourless and 
should not be administered if particulate matter and/or discolouration are observed. 
From a microbiological point of view, the medicine should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 25°C or 24 hours in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C), 
protected from light. 
Any unused medicine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
Dilution (required when the calculated individual patient dose is less than 23 mcg) 
Initial reconstitution of romiplostim with designated volumes of sterile water for injections results in a 
concentration of 500 mcg/mL in all vial sizes. If the calculated individual patient dose is less than 
23 mcg, an additional dilution step to 125 mcg/mL with preservative-free, sterile, sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is required to ensure accurate volume (see table below). 
Dilution Guidelines:

Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of Nplate 
1.  What Nplate is and what it is used for 
Nplate’s active ingredient is romiplostim, which is a protein used to treat low platelet counts in 
patients with immune primary thrombocytopenia (called ITP). ITP is a disease in which your body’s 
immune system destroys its own platelets. Platelets are the cells in your blood that help seal cuts and 
form blood clots. Very low platelet counts can cause bruising and serious bleeding. 
Nplate is used to treat adult patients (aged 18 years and over) with ITP who may or may not have had 
their spleen removed and who have been previously treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulins, 
where these treatments don’t work. 
Nplate works by stimulating the bone marrow (part of the bone which makes blood cells) to produce 
more platelets. This should help to prevent bruising and bleeding associated with ITP. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Nplate 
Do not use Nplate: 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to romiplostim or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are allergic to other medicines that are produced by DNA technology using the 
micro-organism Escherichia coli (E. coli). 
Warnings and precautions 
• 
If you stop taking Nplate a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. If 
you stop taking Nplate your platelet count will have to be monitored, and your doctor will 
discuss appropriate precautions with you. 
88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
If you are at risk of blood clots or if blood clots are common in your family. The risk of blood 
clotting may also be increased if you: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have liver problems; 
are elderly (≥ 65 years); 
are bedridden; 
have cancer; 
are taking the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy; 
have recently had surgery or suffered an injury; 
are obese (overweight); 
are a smoker. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Nplate. 
If you have very high blood platelet counts this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Your doctor 
will adjust your dose of Nplate to ensure that your platelet count does not become too high. 
Bone marrow changes (increased reticulin and possible bone marrow fibrosis) 
Long-term use of Nplate may cause changes in your bone marrow. These changes may lead to 
abnormal blood cells or your body making less blood cells. The mild form of these bone marrow 
changes is called “increased reticulin” and has been observed in Nplate clinical trials. It is not known 
if this may progress to a more severe form called “fibrosis.” Signs of bone marrow changes may show 
up as abnormalities in your blood tests. Your doctor will decide if abnormal blood tests mean that you 
should have bone marrow tests or if you should stop taking Nplate. 
Worsening of blood cancers 
Your doctor may decide to take a bone marrow biopsy if they decide it is necessary to ensure that you 
have ITP, and not another condition such as Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). If you have MDS and 
receive Nplate you may have an increase in your blast cell counts and your MDS condition may 
worsen to become an acute myeloid leukaemia, which is a type of cancer of the blood. 
Loss of response to romiplostim 
If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a platelet response with romiplostim 
treatment, your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you are experiencing 
increased bone marrow fibres (reticulin) or have developed antibodies which neutralise romiplostim’s 
activity. 
Children and adolescents 
Nplate is not recommended for use in children below age 18. 
Other medicines and Nplate 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
If you are also taking medicines which prevent blood clots (anticoagulants or anti-platelet therapy) 
there is a greater risk of bleeding. Your doctor will discuss this with you. 
If you are taking corticosteroids, danazol, and/or azathioprine, which you may be receiving to treat 
your ITP, these may be reduced or stopped when given together with Nplate. 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Nplate is not recommended for use if 
you are pregnant unless indicated by your doctor. 
It is not known whether romiplostim is present in human milk. Nplate is not recommended for use if 
you are breast-feeding. A decision on whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue therapy 
with romiplostim should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to your child and 
the benefit of romiplostim therapy to you. 
Driving and using machines 
You should speak with your doctor before driving or using machines, as some side effects (e.g. 
temporary bouts of dizziness) may impair your ability to do so safely. 
3. 
How to use Nplate 
Nplate will be given under the direct supervision of your doctor, who will closely control the amount 
of Nplate given to you. 
Nplate is administered once a week as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). 
Your initial dose is 1 microgram of Nplate per kilogram of your body weight once a week. Your 
doctor will tell you how much you must take. Nplate should be injected once per week in order to keep 
your platelet counts up. Your doctor will take regular blood samples to measure how your platelets are 
responding and may adjust your dose as necessary. 
Once your platelet count is under control, your doctor will continue to regularly check your blood. 
Your dose may be adjusted further in order to maintain long-term control of your platelet count. 
Always use Nplate exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure of how to use Nplate. 
Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of Nplate 
After suitable training, your doctor may also allow you to inject Nplate yourself. Please read the 
instructions at the end of this leaflet on how to inject Nplate, as discussed with your doctor. If your 
doctor has allowed you to self-inject, you should follow up with your doctor every month to have the 
doctor determine if Nplate is working for you or if another treatment needs to be considered. 
After the first month of self-injecting Nplate, you will need to show that you can still prepare and 
inject Nplate correctly. 
If you use more Nplate than you should 
Your doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given more 
Nplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts 
may rise to very high levels and this may increase the risk of blood clotting. Therefore if your doctor 
suspects that you have been given more Nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are 
monitored for any signs or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment 
immediately. 
If your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you use more Nplate than you should, then inform 
your doctor immediately.

If you use less Nplate than you should 
Your doctor will ensure that you receive the right amount of Nplate. If you have been given less 
Nplate than you should, you may not experience any physical symptoms but your blood platelet counts 
may become low and this may increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore if your doctor suspects that you 
have been given less Nplate than you should, it is recommended that you are monitored for any signs 
or symptoms of side effects and that you are given appropriate treatment immediately. 
If your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you use less Nplate than you should, then inform your 
doctor immediately. 
If you forget to use Nplate 
If you have missed a dose of Nplate, your doctor will discuss with you when you should have your 
next dose. 
If your doctor has allowed you to self-inject and you forget to give yourself an injection, you should 
inform your doctor immediately. 
If you stop using Nplate 
If you stop using Nplate, your low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) is likely to reoccur. Your 
doctor will decide if you should stop using Nplate. 
Injecting Nplate yourself 
Your doctor may decide that it is best for you to inject Nplate. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will 
show you how to inject yourself with Nplate. Do not try to inject yourself if you have not been trained. 
It is very important that you prepare Nplate properly and take the correct dose (see section 7. 
Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of Nplate, at the end of this leaflet).

Instructions for preparing and giving an injection of Nplate 
This section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Nplate. It is important that 
you do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received training from your doctor, nurse 
or pharmacist. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist 
for assistance. It is very important the product is prepared correctly and the correct dose is taken. 
This section is divided into the following subsections: 
Before you begin 
Step 1. Set up materials for an injection 
Step 2. Prepare vial for use, attach vial adapter 
Step 3. Prepare sterile water syringe 
Step 4. Dissolving Nplate by injecting water into vial 
Step 5. Prepare new syringe for injection 
Step 6. Prepare injection needle 
Step 7. Choose and prepare an injection site 
Step 8. Injecting the Nplate liquid 
Step 9. Disposing of supplies 
Before you begin 
Read all instructions for use thoroughly. These instructions are for patients who are already trained 
by their healthcare professional, such as your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist, in self injection. If you 
have not been trained, please contact your healthcare professional. 
The Nplate self injection kit must be kept in the original package until use in order to protect the 
Nplate vial from light. Keep the Nplate self injection kit refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C. 
Once Nplate has been dissolved, inject immediately.

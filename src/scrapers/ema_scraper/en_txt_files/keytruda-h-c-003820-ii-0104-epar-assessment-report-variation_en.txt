2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
This application concerns an extension of indication for pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in combination with 
lenvatinib to include the first-line (1L) treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Consequently, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) are updated, the Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance and Version 32.1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) has also been 
submitted. 
Disease or condition, Epidemiology, Biological Feature  
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents the sixth most common cancer in men and the eighth most 
common cancer in women, accounting for 3%-4% of all adult malignancies in the US (Siegel et al. CA A 
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 7/149 
 
 
 
 
 
Cancer J Clin. 2019). In 2020, an estimated 138,611 new cases of kidney cancer were expected to be 
diagnosed in Europe with approximately 54,054 people expected to die from the disease (GLOBOCAN, 
2020). 
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, comprising 80-90% of 
all kidney tumours (2020 European Association of Urology [EAU] RCC guidelines). 
Well-known risk factors for RCC are cigarette smoking, obesity and hypertension (Chow et al. 2010). 
Renal cell carcinoma generally resists both traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Surgical 
resection can be curative for patients presenting with localized disease.  However, one third of patients 
present with regional or distant metastases and the 5-year survival rate for metastatic disease is 
approximately 12%.  Of patients with localized RCC treated with nephrectomy with curative intent, 
approximately one quarter relapse at distant sites.  The prognosis in these cases is poor (Choueiri and 
Motzer 2017). Advanced’ RCC entails both locally advanced disease that is not amenable to local therapy, 
i.e. curative surgery or radiation therapy, as well as metastatic disease. Advanced RCC thus requires 
systemic treatment. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed new indication for Keytruda in this procedure is: 
“KEYTRUDA in combination with lenvatinib is indicated for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell 
carcinoma in adults  
The proposed posology for this new indication is 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks 
(Q3W) or 400 mg pembrolizumab intravenous (IV) every 6 weeks (Q6W) in combination with 20 mg 
lenvatinib administered orally once daily (QD). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Many renal masses remain asymptomatic until the late disease stages. Currently, >50% of RCCs are 
detected accidentally by non-invasive imaging investigating various non-specific symptoms and other 
abdominal diseases (2020 EAU RCC guidelines; Escudier et al. An Oncol. 2019). In addition, 25-40% of 
the patients that are radically treated (nephrectomy) will eventually relapse. ‘Advanced’ RCC (hereafter 
simply referred to as advanced RCC) entails both locally advanced disease that is not amenable to local 
therapy, i.e. curative surgery or radiation therapy, as well as metastatic disease. Advanced RCC thus 
requires systemic treatment. All histological epithelial subtypes of RCC (clear cell, papillary, 
chromophobe) can present with sarcomatoid differentiation, which is the most aggressive form of RCC. A 
high proportion of RCC patients with sarcomatoid features presents with metastatic disease. These 
features are found in 5-8% of clear cell RCC.  
RCC with sarcomatoid features is characterised by limited therapeutic options due to its relative 
resistance to established systemic targeted therapy. Most trials report on a poor median OS of 5 to 12 
months. Studies have shown that sarcomatoid RCC express programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand 
(PD-L1) at a much higher level than non-sarcomatoid RCC, suggesting that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 
axis may be an attractive new therapeutic strategy (Pichler et al. Cancers (Basel). 2019).

Management 
Current systemic treatment of advanced RCC 
The choice of treatment is normally based on prognostic risk factors historically developed in the era of 
frontline vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The most 
commonly used prognostic models are  the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database 
Consortium (IMDC) prognostic model or  the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) 
prognostic model (Hatakeyama et al. 2019) including  the following adverse factors: 
IMDC 
MSKCC 
Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <80%  
Karnofsky performance status (KPS) <80%  
time from diagnosis to treatment <1 year 
time from diagnosis to treatment <1 year 
haemoglobin concentration less than the 
haemoglobin concentration less than the lower 
lower limit of normal 
limit of normal 
serum calcium greater than the upper limit of 
serum calcium greater than the upper limit of 
normal 
normal 
neutrophil count greater than the upper limit 
LDH >1.5x the upper limit of normal 
of normal and 
platelet count greater than the upper limit of 
- 
normal. 
Patients with none (0) of these risk factors are considered good risk, those with one or two (1-2) are 
considered intermediate risk, and those with three or more (≥3) are considered poor risk.  
The estimated median overall survival (OS) for the patients in the IDMC risk groups is 43.2 months, 22.5 
months, and 7.8 months, respectively (Ljungberg et al. 2019). 
First-line systemic treatment 
The algorithm for first-line (1L) systemic treatment in ccRCC that is currently recommended by ESMO is 
presented in

a Where recommended treatment not available or contra-indicated. 
Abbreviation: ccRCC= clear cell renal cell carcinoma 
In addition, the combination of avelumab + axitinib has been approved by EMA for the 1L treatment of 
adult patients with advanced RCC. 
In spite of recent additions to the (systemic) treatment armamentarium, both (median) progression-free 
survival (PFS) and OS for patients with advanced RCC are still rather limited, especially for patients in the 
intermediate and poor risk groups. There thus remains an unmet medical need. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to 
inhibit the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  This blockade enhances functional 
activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate tumor regression and, ultimately, immune rejection.  In 
vitro and in vivo experiences have shown that PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade using a mAb can result in 
activation of antitumor T cells and subsequent tumor regression.  In T-cell activation assays using human 
donor blood cells, the EC50 was in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 nM.  Pembrolizumab also modulates the level 
of IL 2, TNFα, IFNγ, and other cytokines.  The antibody potentiates existing immune responses in the 
presence of antigen only; it does not nonspecifically activate T cells.  Blockade of PD 1 or PD-L1, using 
mAbs, has demonstrated substantial clinical activity in patients with metastatic RCC (Deleuze et al. 
2020).

Lenvatinib inhibits the kinase activities of VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4).    
Structural studies of VEGFR2-lenvatinib complexes revealed that lenvatinib exerts its inhibitory effects not 
only by interacting with the RTK adenosine triphosphate binding site, but also neighbouring regions of the 
kinase domain (allosteric site), distinguishing this agent as a distinctive Type V inhibitor.  This unique 
binding mode results in high selectivity and leads to rapid association and slower dissociation kinetics at 
the receptor and results in longer receptor occupancy (Okamoto et al. 2015).  A subsequent structural 
study of the FGFR1-lenvatinib complex indicated that the binding mode of lenvatinib to FGFR1 also meets

the 3 criteria that define a Type V kinase inhibitor:  1) binds to the ATP-binding site, 2) binds to the 
neighbouring allosteric region, and 3) fits to the kinase adopting the DFG-in conformation (Matsuki, et al., 
2018).

in combination with everolimus for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy 
Scientific rationale for the combination 
In nonclinical models, lenvatinib decreased the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) population, which is 
known as an immune-regulator in the tumor microenvironment.  The decrease in TAM was accompanied 
by increases in activated cytotoxic T-cell populations through stimulation of interferon-gamma signaling, 
resulting in increased immune activation.  The immune-modulating effect of lenvatinib may result in a 
potent combination effect with PD-1/L1 signal inhibitors.  The effect of combining lenvatinib with an anti- 
PD-1 mAb was investigated in 4 murine tumor isograft models, which showed significant tumor growth 
inhibition compared with control.  In the RAG murine tumor isograft tumor model, survival in the group 
treated with the combination was significantly longer compared to that of the respective monotherapy 
groups (Study M18018 report).  In the CT26 murine tumor isograft model, treatment with the 
combination significantly increased the population of activated cytotoxic T cells compared with that of the 
respective monotherapy groups (Kato et al. 2019).  All treatments were well tolerated and severe body 
weight loss was not observed (data on file). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
In the latest SA (EMEA/H/SA/3261/1/FU/1/2018/II), the CHMP agreed that data from the RCC cohort in 
Study 111/KEYNOTE 146 corroborated with data from Study 307/KEYNOTE 581 could be adequate to 
support the assessment of the benefit/risk for the combination of lenvatinib with pembrolizumab for the 
treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma . A specific concern was how the present 
study as well as available external data would serve to justify the relative contributions of lenvatinib as 
well as pembrolizumab to the clinical benefit of the proposed combination regimen.   A randomised 
comparison, even of ORR rather than relevant time to event endpoints would be preferred. Whether the 
proposed basis to conclude on the contribution of both components to efficacy could be adequate would 
be, dependent on the actual ORR shown in the Study 307/KN 581 at the time of the review.   
The applicant asked for the possibility to submit this variation based on data from the RCC cohort of 
Study 111/KEYNOTE 146 together with Interim Analysis Data from Study E7080-G000-307/KEYNOTE 
581, which was not encouraged, because ORR is a pharmacodynamic endpoint which, in most settings, 
does not directly represent clinical benefit. Furthermore, the surrogacy of ORR for PFS and/or OS has in 
most cases not been established.  
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 12/149 
 
 
 
 
Control of the type I error for the testing of ORR in the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab arm in the interim 
analysis was  not considered critical, whereas the protection of trial integrity was discussed  
The applicant provided an overview of the operational plan for the interim analysis of the first 88 subjects 
in the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab arm for ORR, devised to protect the integrity of the study 307 data.  
Regulatory concerns regarding the dissemination of results in case of positive IA findings in the US were 
discussed.  
The applicant estimated that about 25% of patients in the control arm would still be on treatment at 
dissemination of IA findings, and that patients generally were not expected to change treatment unless 
facing tumour progression, potentially protecting the PFS endpoint. The applicant described that in case 
of a change in therapy prior to disease progression, patients would continue systematic scanning and a 
data analysis according to EU censoring rules would be possible.  
Notwithstanding these measures, it would from a European point of view be preferable if this IA was 
discarded as there is potential for creating bias.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
The additional pharmacodynamics studies were not performed in compliance with GLP, which is 
considered acceptable in line with the ICH guidelines.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
To support the mechanism of action of the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib, nonclinical 
studies conducted with lenvatinib were provided with this submission to investigate the antitumor activity 
of lenvatinib and the combination of lenvatinib with an anti-PD-1 mAb, clone RMP1-14 (used as a 
surrogate antibody for pembrolizumab), in murine tumor isograft models.  
In addition, the immunomodulatory activity of lenvatinib in murine tumor isograft models using 
immunocompetent mice and athymic mice was investigated to determine the effects of lenvatinib on the 
host immune systems in the Tumor microenviroment (TME).

pembrolizumab, an anti-human PD-1 humanized mAb. RAG cells were inoculated subcutaneously into 6-
week old female immunocompetent BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj mice.

At 7 days after inoculation, lenvatinib mesilate (10 mg/kg), anti-PD-1 mAb (10 mg/kg), and rat IgG2a 
isotype control (control immunoglobulin G [IgG], 10 mg/kg) were administered to mice (20/group). 
Lenvatinib and vehicle were administered orally once daily for 28 days, and anti-PD-1 mAb and control 
IgG were administered intraperitoneally twice per week totaling 8 times (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 
and 25). A survival day was defined for each mouse as a duration from Day 1 to the day when the mouse 
was euthanized or found dead.

Isografts 
The Tumor Volume (TV) and body weight were measured twice per week (Days 1 – 63 and Days 71 – 90) 
or once per week (Days 64 – 70). The TV was calculated according to the formula: TV (mm3) = length 
(mm) × width2 (mm2) × ½. The relative body weight (RBW) was calculated as a ratio of the mean body 
weight at a given time point to the mean body weight at the initiation of dosing. 
Lenvatinib (10 mg/kg) monotherapy and lenvatinib in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb (10 mg/kg) 
showed significant TGI compared to the control group from Days 8 to 22 in the RAG isograft model, the 
antitumor activity of the combination of lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 mAb was only slightly greater than that 
of lenvatinib monotherapy on Days 18 and 22. Severe body weight loss ( BWL) (>20% compared to Day 
1) was not observed during the dosing period (Days 1 to 28) in any of the treatment groups. Figure 3 
shows Kaplan–Meier curves of control and treated groups through Day 90 in the RAG isograft model.

RAG Murine RCC Isograft Model 
Comparable results were obtained when evaluating the antitumor activity of lenvatinib in combination 
with anti-Murine PD-1 mAb in the LL/2 (LLC1) Murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma Isograft Model and in 
an the Hepa1-6 Murine HCC Isograft Model.  
2.  Antitumor and Immunomodulatory Activity of Lenvatinib in the CT26 Murine Colon Carcinoma 
Isograft Model 
Antitumor activity of lenvatinib in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb was also evaluated in the CT26 murine 
colon carcinoma isografts in syngeneic immunocompetent BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj mice and athymic CAnN.Cg-
Foxn1nu/CrlCrlj mice (Kato et al. 2019). Here more extensive studies have been performed.  
CT26 cells were inoculated in syngeneic immunocompetent BALB/cAnNCrlCrlj mice (7-week old females. 
When tumor sizes reached a mean volume of 33 mm3 (Day 1), vehicle (3 mmol/L HCl), lenvatinib 
mesilate (10 mg/kg), anti-PD-1 mAb; (200 μg/animal, clone RMP1-14), or the combination of lenvatinib 
and anti-PD-1 mAb was administered to the mice (8/group). Lenvatinib was administered orally once 
daily for 25 days for monotherapy, and once daily for 28 days for combination therapy. Anti-PD-1 mAb 
was administered intraperitoneally once every 3 days totalling 7 times for monotherapy, and once every 3 
days totalling 10 times for combination therapy. The TV and body weight were measured twice per week.   
As Figure 4 demonstrates lenvatinib (10 mg/kg) monotherapy and anti-PD-1 mAb (200 μg/animal) 
monotherapy showed  Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI)  compared with the vehicle control. In addition, 
antitumor activity of their combination therapy was greater than that of either monotherapy on Day 19. 
Severe BWL (>20% compared to Day 1) was not noted in any treated groups.  
As shown in Figure 4 (B), flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentage of the population of TAMs 
was decreased, and the populations of IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells and GzmB+CD8+ T cells (activated cytotoxic 
T cells) were increased in the tumors of mice treated with lenvatinib alone, and those treated with the 
combination of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 mAb compared with those of vehicle-control mice. The

GzmB+CD8+ T cell population expressing a cytotoxic enzyme, GzmB, was increased following treatment 
with the combination compared with that of lenvatinib monotherapy. 
Therefore, lenvatinib could modulate the Tumor Microenviroment (TME) by decreasing the 
immunosuppressive TAM population and the increasing activated cytotoxic T cell population. Here no 
significant difference could be demonstrated between the TAM suppression and cytotoxic T-cell activation 
of lenvatinib monotherapy and the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab combination.

The antitumor activity of lenvatinib monotherapy and the combination therapy was also decreased in 
mice injected with anti-IFN-γ mAb, whereas the antitumor activity of anti-PD-1 mAb monotherapy was 
not affected by injection with anti-IFN-γ mAb. These results suggested that IFN-γ signaling contributed to 
the antitumor activity of lenvatinib and the combination of lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 mAb in this model.

2.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab; 
however, since pembrolizumab is enzymatically catabolized to individual amino acids while lenvatinib is 
cleared via aldehyde oxidase and cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism, as well as spontaneous 
hydrolysis, no metabolic drug interactions are expected.

2.2.1.  Toxicology  
The possibility of toxicologic interaction of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab is considered low based on the 
toxicity profiles of the 2 agents. The toxicities observed with the 2 agents are consistent with their 
respective mechanisms of action, and the combination of lenvatinib plus an anti-PD-1 mAb (surrogate for 
pembrolizumab) was well tolerated when studied in mouse isograft models. No significant mortality or 
body weight loss was observed in these studies.  
The nonclinical safety of pembrolizumab was characterized in cynomolgus monkeys in toxicology studies 
up to 6-months duration. Pembrolizumab was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys up to a 200 
mg/kg/dose with corresponding systemic exposure based on area under the concentration-time curve 
from zero time to Day 14 (AUC(0-14d)) of approximately 67,500 μg·day/mL with biweekly dosing over the 
course of the 6-month study. No findings of toxicologic significance were observed and the NOAEL was ≥ 
200 mg/kg. The exposure margins at the NOAEL based on AUC(0-tau) are ≥ 19-fold and ≥ 74-fold 
compared to exposures at the human dose of 10 mg/kg and 200 mg, respectively. 
In the chronic toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys with lenvatinib, target organ toxicity was 
primarily observed in the kidneys, gastro-intestinal tract, artery/arteriole in various organs, bone, and 
male and female reproductive organs (testis and ovary) in both species, and in the incisor and adrenals in 
rats. These findings were reversible and most were not evident at the end of a recovery period of 4 
weeks. The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for the 26- and 39-week toxicity studies in rats 
and cynomolgus monkeys, respectively, were the lowest doses tested in those studies (0.4 and 0.1 
mg/kg, respectively). The exposure margins at the NOAELs based on systemic exposure (area under the 
concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours; AUC(0-24)) compared to exposures at the maximum 
recommended human dose (24 mg) were 0.7- to 0.8-fold in rats and 0.1-fold in monkeys. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted from the submission of ERA studies because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab is a protein, therefore an ERA has 
not been submitted. This is considered acceptable. 
Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Lenvatinib is an oral multiple RTK inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of VEGF receptors 
VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), in addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic 
pathway-related RTKs including FGF receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the PDGF receptor PDGFRα; KIT; and 
RET. 
In vivo human tumor xenograft studies in athymic mice have shown that lenvatinib exerts antitumor 
activity against various tumor types including RCC, thyroid cancer, HCC, non-small cell lung cancer, 
melanoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer, mainly through its potent inhibition of 
tumor angiogenesis driven by VEGFR and FGFR signaling.  
The new provided nonclinical studies investigated the antitumor activity of lenvatinib and the combination 
of lenvatinib with an murine anti-PD-1 mAb in murine tumor isograft models.  Several models (RCC, 
NSCLC, HCC and CRC) were investigated.  Lenvatinib monotherapy and lenvatinib in combination with 
anti-PD-1 mAb showed inhibition of tumor growth, however, the antitumor activity of the combination of 
lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 mAb was only slightly greater than that of lenvatinib monotherapy in every 
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021

model investigated. Severe BWL (>20% compared to Day 1) was not observed during the dosing period 
(Days 1 to 28) in any of the treatment groups and tumor model. 
In the CT26 murine tumor isograft models (Colon-CA), lenvatinib demonstrated greater antitumor activity 
in immunocompetent mice, including tumor regressions, than in athymic mice (data not shown). 
Flow cytometric analysis showed that the TAM population in the TME was significantly decreased while the 
populations of IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells and GzmB+CD8+ T cells (activated cytotoxic T cells) in the TME were 
significantly increased following treatment with lenvatinib or combination of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 mAb 
in the CT26 isograft model. These new in vivo pharmacodynamics study results suggest that the 
immunomodulatory activity of lenvatinib in immunocompetent models involves the decrease of 
immunosuppressive TAMs and the increase of activated cytotoxic T cells in the TME. However, these 
experiments could not convincingly demonstrate an additive effect of ant-PD-1 treatment to the 
lenvatinib monotherapy.   
In addition, the antitumor activity of lenvatinib monotherapy as well as the combination of lenvatinib plus 
anti-PD-1 mAb was significantly reduced by the prior and concomitant injection of IFN-γ neutralizing anti-
IFN-γ mAb, but the antitumor activity of anti-PD-1 mAb monotherapy was not changed by anti-IFN-γ 
mAb in this model. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The antitumor activity of the combination was greater than either monotherapy in all 4 murine isograft 
models tested, however the difference to lenvatinib monotherapy was not striking. 
Nevertheless, the previously established antiangiogenic activity of lenvatinib resulting from the inhibition 
of VEGFR and FGFR signalling and its immunomodulatory activity with a different mode of action from a 
PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (decrease of TAMs, increase of activated cytotoxic T cells and 
activation of IFN-γ signalling) could indeed lead to an additive effect of both components in RCC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The current submission concerns the extension of the indication for pembrolizumab in combination with 
lenvatinib for the treatment of subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Pembrolizumab (200 
mg Q3W) is approved in combination with axitinib for the treatment of advanced RCC. Pembrolizumab 
400 mg Q6W was approved for combination therapies during this procedure. Lenvatinib  (12 mg QD) is 
approved as monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC and lenvatinib (24 md QD) is approved as 
monotherapy for advanced thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and Lenvatinib (18 mg QD) is approved in 
combination with everolimus (RCC).  
The basis of this submission is study KEYNOTE-581, an open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial to compare 
the efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib in Combination With Everolimus or Pembrolizumab Versus Sunitinib 
Alone in First-Line Treatment of Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (CLEAR). Pembrolizumab 
and lenvatinib pharmacokinetics from study KEYNOTE-581 were analysed and compared with historical 
pharmacokinetic monotherapy data. PopPK analyses were performed for pembrolizumab and lenvatinib, 
adding data into the existing popPK models for each drug with the combination effect added as a

covariate, respectively. Pembrolizumab immunogenicity data are also presented from study KEYNOTE-
581. 
The clinical pharmacology of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib have been described in previously submitted 
clinical pharmacology packages and included single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic parameters, 
drug-drug interaction potential, pharmacodynamics, QT prolongation potential, popPK analyses for the 
various tumour indications and exposure-response analyses. 
Bioanalytical methods 
The pharmacokinetic samples from subjects in study KEYNOTE-581 were analysed by the same validated 
assays as used in previous applications. Validated bioanalytical methods are available for determining (1) 
serum concentrations of pembrolizumab; (2) anti-MK-3475 antibodies; and (3) neutralizing antibodies. 
Different generations of bioanalytical methods for the determination of pembrolizumab serum 
concentrations were used at different CROs. Population PK analysis has demonstrated that they are 
comparable where relevant.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Pembrolizumab in Subjects with Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma 
in Combination with Lenvatinib 
Observed concentration of pembrolizumab from Study 307 Arm B was compared graphically with 
historical pembrolizumab monotherapy reference existing data at the same dose level from completed 
studies. Using a dataset with sample size of 2993 participants administered with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy, a time-dependent PK model was created to describe the PK profile.

Population Pharmacokinetic of Lenvatinib and Pharmacokinetic /Pharmacodynamic Analysis of 
Safety in Subjects with Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma in Combination with Pembrolizumab 
Population PK analysis of lenvatinib was based on pooled PK data from the 21 studies, including Study 
307 in RCC subjects. In the previous PK analysis (CPMS-E7080-013R), lenvatinib PK´was best described 
by a 3-compartment model with simultaneous first and zero order absorption and linear elimination from 
the central compartment parameterized for apparent total clearance following oral administration (CL/F), 
apparent volume of the central compartment (V1/F), apparent volume of peripheral compartments (V2/F 
and V3/F), inter-compartmental clearance between V1/F and V2/F and V1/F and V3/F (Q2/F and Q3/F), 
absorption rate constant (Ka), and duration of zero-order absorption (D1) and relative bioavailability 
(F1rel). PK model included the following covariates: body weight on clearances and volume parameters, 
healthy subjects on CL/F, DTC, RCC, and HCC subjects on CL/F, albumin < 30 g/L and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) > upper limit of normal (ULN) on CL/F, CYP3A4 inhibitors on CL/F, and capsule 
formulation on relative bioavailability.  
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 24/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The final model was a 3-compartment model with simultaneous zero and first order absorption and first 
order elimination from the central compartment parameterized for CL/F, V1/F, V2/F, V3/F, Q1, Q2, Ka, 
D1 and relative bioavailability (F1rel) for capsule formulation compared to tablet. The model included 
body weight as an allometric constant on clearances and volume parameters, albumin < 30 g/L and ALP 
> ULN on CL/F and CYP3A4 inhibitors on CL/F. In addition to the above, population effects on lenvatinib 
CL/F for RCC and HCC subjects and for healthy subjects were determined and included in the model. 
Finally, the effects of DTC and dosing (categorical) and exposure levels (AUC) of concomitant everolimus 
and concomitant pembrolizumab (categorical) were tested on lenvatinib CL/F. In these cases none was 
found to be significant. Population PK parameter estimates from the final model are presented in Table 3.

The RCC population was found to have a 14.6% lower lenvatinib CL/F compared with patients with 
DTC and other cancer types excluding HCC. 
The magnitude of each effect is within the intersubject variability for CL/F (%CV = 34.2 %).  
Individual lenvatinib CL/F and AUC for RCC subjects receiving lenvatinib 20 mg in combination with 
pembrolizumab (Arm B) in Study 307 are summarized below. The median values and range of parameter 
values are comparable with CL/F and AUC dose-normalized to 20 mg in subjects with RCC who received 
lenvatinib monotherapy in Study 205 confirming the non-clinically relevant effect of pembrolizumab co-
administration on lenvatinib exposure.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on the existing robust characterization of pembrolizumab PK, a comparison was conducted 
between the observed PK of pembrolizumab for the current indication (RCC) in combination with 
lenvatinib and the predictions from the reference PK model developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy 
data (KEYNOTE-001, -002, -006, -010, and -024).  
DDI between pembrolizumab and lenvatinib are unlikely, considering the divergent metabolic pathways 
for both compounds.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA is an antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that 
has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates T-cell 
responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, which 
are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a 
sufficiently large dataset of patients across several indications, with very low observed rates of total 
treatment emergent ADA (1.4 - 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). This analysis 
has not demonstrated impact on efficacy or safety, as currently summarized in EU SmPC. This low rate of 
immunogenicity has been shown to be consistent across tumor type and no clinical consequences have 
been observed in the subjects with a positive immunogenicity reading. 
Immunogenicity evaluation for study KEYNOTE-581 
The incidence rate of anti-drug antibodies of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib in Study 307 
Arm B was summarized and compared with historical rates from monotherapy. 
The observed incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies in evaluable subjects based on a 
pooled analysis (pembrolizumab combination therapy) in subjects with advanced RCC is 0.3% (1 out of 
314), based on 1 subject with treatment-emergent positive, no subjects with non-treatment emergent 
positive, and 313 with negative immunogenicity status. The treatment-emergent positive subject had no 
antibodies with neutralizing capacity.

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
No new information regarding PK/PD modelling for pembrolizumab is available within this extension of 
indication. 
Population PK analysis of lenvatinib was based on PK data from the 21 studies, including study 307 in 
RCC subjects. Exposure-response analysis for AEs was based on data from Arm B of study 307.  
Objectives 
The objectives of the population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis of lenvatinib were to characterize the PK 
of lenvatinib in subjects with RCC when administered alone and concomitantly with either everolimus or 
pembrolizumab and compare to that in healthy subjects and subjects with other types of cancer (mainly 
DTC and HCC) on pooled data from several studies including Study 307.  
The objectives of the PK/PD analysis for safety of combination therapy of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
in subjects with RCC were to explore the relationship of lenvatinib exposure with the occurrence of 
adverse events (AEs) related to only lenvatinib in subjects with RCC, which were previously specified to 
include hypertension, proteinuria, weight decreased, vomiting and hypothyroidism (Arm B of study 307). 
The PK/PD safety analysis included data from RCC subjects from the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
combination arm from study 307. Across the lenvatinib program, including this study, safety was 
assessed by evaluation of adverse events (AE), clinical laboratory tests (biochemistry and hematology), 
urinalysis, vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECG), echocardiograms and other 
examinations as clinically indicated. 
Where possible AEs recorded throughout the treatment were graded on the five-point scale according to 
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4.0 or higher. AEs for hypertension, proteinuria, weight 
decrease, vomiting and hypothyroidism were analysed to examine their relationships with lenvatinib 
exposure.

Analysis of Lenvatinib from Study 307/Arms A & B (N=699) 
The PK/PD analysis for TEAEs included 347 subjects with RCC from study 307/Arm B. 
Results 
With the exception of hypothyroidism and to a smaller extent proteinuria, there was a generally weak, 
albeit positive relationship of TEAEs and lenvatinib AUC, with the 95% Cis for the exposure logit 
parameter including 0. For example, for hypothyroidism the probability of any Grade (1 to 3) increased 
from 56 to 75% across the exposure quantiles (table below). Proteinuria increased from 19% to 30% 
across the same lenvatinib concentration range.

Age was associated with a decreased odd ratio of hypothyroidism 0.59 for subjects <65 years old. 
Proteinuria was weakly associated with a lower ECOG score, with an odds ratio of 0.45. At baseline, 
Japanese subjects were associated with a 2.5 higher odds ratio of proteinuria and hypothyroidism.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology results for the combination therapy of pembrolizumab together with lenvatinib 
specific to support approval for first line treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 
are available from the pivotal study KEYNOTE-581. 
A substantial characterization of the key clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity findings of 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy have been provided in previous submissions.  
Based on the existing robust characterization of pembrolizumab PK, a comparison was conducted 
between the observed PK of pembrolizumab for the current indication (RCC) in combination with 
lenvatinib and the predictions from the reference PK model developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy 
data (KEYNOTE-001, -002, -006, -010, and -024).  
Pre-dose pembrolizumab serum concentrations (Ctrough) were obtained within 24 hours prior to dosing 
at cycles 1, 2, 3, 5 and during the off-treatment visit after pembrolizumab discontinuation. Post-dose 
serum concentrations (Cmax) were drawn within approximately 30 minutes after the end of the infusion 
in cycle 1 and cycle 2. 
The observed concentrations in RCC patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib 
generally fall within the range of predicted concentrations, both after first dose and at steady state, 
although some low concentrations do not fall in the 90% PI. 
The MAH provided a direct comparison of the observed PK data (trough and peak concentrations at 
cycle1) with those obtained with the 200 mg Q3W flat dose for other tumor types in the monotherapy 
setting supporting the consistency among exposure obtained in monotherapy with those obtained in 
combination therapy.  
Treatment comparison for lenvatinib PK parameters showed that median lenvatinib plasma concentration-
time profiles were comparable when lenvatinib was administered alone and with pembrolizumab. 
Concomitant pembrolizumab dosing did not affect lenvatinib PK, and exposures of pembrolizumab were 
not impacted in the presence of lenvatinib when the 2 drugs were administered as a combination therapy. 
The existing immunogenicity assessment for pembrolizumab for the monotherapy setting is based on a 
sufficiently large dataset of patients across several indications, with very low observed rates of total 
treatment emergent ADA (1.4 - 3.8%) as well as of neutralizing antibodies (0.4 – 1.6%). 
For pembrolizumab combination therapy (200 mg pembrolizumab Q3W + 20 mg lenvatinib QD), ADA 
samples were available from 332 subjects (314 subjects were included in the final immunogenicity 
assessment). 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADA to pembrolizumab in subjects with RCC treated with 
pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib was ~0.3% (1 out of 314 total evaluable samples). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The updated lenvatinib PK profile containing data from Study 307/KEYNOTE-581 is consistent with the 
current population PK profile of lenvatinib. The observed concentration from KEYNOTE-581 fall within the 
90% CI of the model predicted median concentration. 
The incidences of treatment emergent ADA is negligible when pembrolizumab is combined with lenvatinib 
which is consistent with the low immunogenicity incidence after pembrolizumab monotherapy of prior 
immunogenicity evaluations.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Study KEYNOTE 146 (E7080 A001 111) is an ongoing, open-label Phase 1b/2 study evaluating the safety 
and efficacy of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in subjects with selected metastatic solid tumor types, 
including endometrial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, RCC, urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck, and melanoma.  The primary objective of the Phase 1b part of the study 
was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for 
lenvatinib to be used in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W (treatment dosage for all currently 
approved indications). 
Figure 9 Study design Keynote 146 
The MTD for lenvatinib was investigated in the Phase 1b dose-finding portion of the study using a dose 
de-escalation strategy with a 3 + 3 design.  The pembrolizumab dosage was held constant at 200 mg 
intravenously (IV) Q3W.  The initial dosage for lenvatinib was 24 mg/day (currently approved starting 
dosage as monotherapy in differentiated thyroid carcinoma), administered orally (PO).  If none of the 3 
subjects in a cohort experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the cohort would be expanded with 7 
additional subjects for confirmation of the MTD.  If 1 of 3 subjects in a cohort experienced a DLT, 3 
additional subjects would be added to the cohort.  If 2 or 3 subjects experienced a DLT in a cohort, the 
subsequent cohort would evaluate 3 subjects at the next lowest dose level (ie, lenvatinib 20 mg/day).  If 
the lenvatinib 20 mg/day dose level was not tolerated, a further dose de-escalation cohort of lenvatinib 
14 mg/day would follow  (Taylor et al. 2020). 
Three subjects were enrolled in the lenvatinib 24 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg dose level. There 
were 2 DLTs at this dose level (1 subject with Grade 3 arthralgia and another subject with Grade 3 
fatigue) during Cycle 1. Ten patients were subsequently enrolled in the lenvatinib 20 mg/day + 
pembrolizumab 200 mg dose level. No DLTs were reported in this dose level. The MTD (and RP2D) for the 
combination was determined to be lenvatinib 20 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks 
and this dose was used in Phase 2 of Keynote-146 and Keynote-581.

The RP2D was evaluated for efficacy and safety in the Phase 2 portion.  Efficacy data for the first 30 
subjects with RCC treated with zero to 5 prior therapies, revealed that the ORR was 70% (95% CI:  50.6, 
85.3; per immune related RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment; Taylor, et al., 2020).  These efficacy 
data showed significant tumor reduction with durable responses in treatment naïve and previously treated 
subjects.  Moreover, adverse events (AEs) were manageable with dose interruptions and dose reductions.  
Lenvatinib 20 mg QD (starting dosage) plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W were the dosages used in Study 
307, and have been implemented as the recommended starting dosages across the program. 
The 200 mg Q3W dose is currently recommended for all the approved indications of pembrolizumab (as 
monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy) and is being evaluated in multiple clinical studies.

Treatments 
Combination lenvatinib plus everolimus (Arm A): Lenvatinib 18 mg PO QD was given with everolimus 5 
mg PO QD in each 21-day cycle 
Combination lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (Arm B): Lenvatinib 20 mg PO QD was given with 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W during each 21-day cycle. 
Sunitinib (Arm C): Sunitinib 50 mg PO QD was given for 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off 
(Schedule 4/2). 
Subjects could receive study treatment until independent imaging review (IIR) confirmed disease 
progression (PD), development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination of 
the study.  Disease progression was to be confirmed by IIR prior to the investigator discontinuing study 
treatment for a subject.  In the case that RECIST 1.1 defined PD was confirmed by IIR, continuation of 
study treatment was permitted if the investigator considered that there was clinical benefit and the 
subject was tolerating study drug. Pembrolizumab was continued for a maximum of 24 months, 
treatment with lenvatinib could be continued beyond 24 months.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by IIR, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the 
date of the first documentation of disease progression using RECIST 1.1 or death (whichever occurred 
first).  
Key Secondary Endpoints 
• OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Subjects 
who were lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, and those who were alive at the data cut-off date were 
censored, either at the date the subject was last known alive or at the data cut-off date, whichever 
occurred first. 
• ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects who had BOR of CR or PR as determined by IIR using 
RECIST 1.1. ORR was calculated for confirmed CR/PR, and for confirmed and unconfirmed CR/PR.

TSBM-E7080-307-ANA-1P). 
Sample size 
The sample size was estimated based on the primary endpoint of PFS. Approximately 1050 subjects were 
planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 1 of 3 treatment arms: lenvatinib + everolimus, lenvatinib 
+ pembrolizumab, or sunitinib alone.  
An administrative α of 0.0001 was attributed to an early analysis of ORR, and for the two PFS 
comparisons (one for each test arm as compared to control), it was planned to split the remaining alpha 
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 37/149 
 
 
 
 
of 0.0499 (2-sided), as initial allocations in a graphical approach, into α = 0.045 for the comparison 
between Arm B and Arm C, and α = 0.0049 for the comparison between Arm A and Arm C. 
Sample size calculation for PFS 
The same treatment effect was assumed for the primary comparisons of lenvatinib + everolimus (Arm A) 
and lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (Arm B) each compared to sunitinib alone (Arm C). Assuming the 
median PFS of sunitinib to be 12.3 months and a targeted HR of 0.714 for the primary comparisons, this 
corresponds to a 40% improvement (4.9 months) in median PFS from 12.3 months to 17.2 months for 
Arm A versus Arm C and for Arm B versus Arm C. A yearly loss of PFS event rate of 22% was assumed in 
the sample size calculation.  
The study was designed to achieve 90% power at α = 0.045 to detect a statistically significant difference 
in PFS in the comparison between Arm B and Arm C. Therefore, a total of 388 PFS events were required 
between Arms B and C in the final PFS analysis. Since the same number of PFS events was expected to 
be observed in Arms A and C, a total of 388 PFS events was expected in the final PFS analysis for the 
comparison between Arms A and C. The power to detect a statistically significant difference in PFS 
between Arm A and Arm C was approximately 70% at the initial assigned α = 0.0049, and was expected 
to be at least 90% if the hypothesis tests of PFS and OS in the comparison of Arm B and Arm C are 
statistically significant, and vice versa. In the power calculation for PFS analysis, it was assumed that one 
interim analysis of PFS was to be performed at the 80% information fraction and a Lan-DeMets spending 
function with O’Brien-Fleming boundary was planned to be used between the interim and final analysis of 
PFS. 
Assuming an average enrolment rate of 31 subjects per month, the interim and final analysis of PFS were 
expected to occur approximately 38 and 45 months (34-month enrolment period) after the first subject is 
randomized. A total of 582 PFS events were expected in 3 arms by the time of planned final PFS analysis. 
Sample size calculation for OS 
For the key secondary endpoint of OS, a total of 304 deaths for each comparison (456 death events 
among the 3 arms) were expected in the final OS analysis. For OS testing, when the corresponding PFS 
testing is statistically significant at the initial assigned alpha, the study was expected to provide 80% 
power to detect a statistically significant difference at an α level of 0.045 for the comparison between 
Arms B and C, and 50% power at an α level of 0.0049 for the comparison between Arm A and C. By using 
the graphical approach, the power for the OS comparison between Arms A and C was expected to 
increase to at least 80% if the OS testing between Arms B and C is significant and both PFS testing are 
significant, and vice versa. 
The assumptions that were used for the OS power calculations are: 1) the hazard ratio is 0.70 (median 
OS is 54.1 months in Arm A or Arm B and 37.9 months in Arm C), 2) interim analyses are performed at 
approximately 45%, 60%, and 80% information fraction of death events, 3) a Lan-DeMets spending 
function with Pocock boundary is used, and 4) the yearly rate for loss to follow-up is 3%. With the 
planned sample size and the assumptions for enrolment, the final analysis of OS was expected to occur 
approximately 69 months after the first subject is randomly assigned to treatment. 
Sample size calculation for ORR 
For the key secondary endpoint of ORR, assuming an ORR of 32% in Arm C and 48% in Arm A or Arm B, 
the study was expected to provide at least 95% power to detect a difference when testing of PFS and OS 
are positive for each comparison of Arm B vs Arm C and Arm A vs Arm C.

Initially, the total sample size was planned to be n=745 subjects, and this was increased to n=1050 in 
protocol amendment 04 (30 Jun 2018), to address slow enrollment in the first 12 months and high loss of 
PFS event rate, and provide adequate power for intergroup comparisons of overall survival (OS). 
Randomisation 
Approximately 1,050 subjects were to be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio, 
with approximately 350 subjects in each arm. 
Subjects were planned to be stratified by geographic region (Region 1:  Western Europe and North 
America or Region 2:  rest of the world) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic 
group (favorable, intermediate, and poor risk).   
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted in an open label fashion, with a blinded independent radiologist review of 
responses.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis population 
The Full Analysis Set (Intent-to-Treat Analysis [ITT] Population) was planned as the group of all 
randomized subjects regardless of the treatment actually received. This was planned to be the primary 
analysis population used for all efficacy analyses which was planned to be based on the intent-to-treat 
principle. 
Primary outcome variable: PFS 
The primary endpoint was planned to be PFS assessed by independent review (IIR), defined as the time 
from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression using 
RECIST 1.1 or death (whichever occurs first). 
Missing values and censoring of PFS 
Progression date was planned to be assigned to the earliest date when any RECIST 1.1-defined disease 
progression is observed without missing more than one adequate radiologic assessment. The following 
rules were planned be used for censoring, with a prioritization described below. 
Table 9 Censoring Rules for Derivation of Progression-Free Survival  
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 39/149 
 
 
 
 
The priority of the censoring rules was planned as follows: 
1. If the subject had PD or death, the following sequence will be applied: 
• 
If a subject did not have a baseline tumor assessment (No. 1), the subject will be censored on the 
date of randomization. However, if the subject died within 121 days after randomization and did 
not receive a new anticancer treatment, it will be counted as PFS event at the date of death. If a 
subject had new anticancer treatment before PD or death (No. 4), the subject will be censored on 
the date of the last adequate tumor assessment prior to or on the date of new anticancer 
treatment. 
• 
If a subject missed two or more tumor assessments before PD or death (No. 7), the subject will 
be censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before PD or death. Note that if a 
subject is censored by both this criterion and the anticancer treatment criterion, the earliest 
censoring date will be used. 
•  Otherwise, if a subject had an event (No. 2, No. 5, or No. 6), the earliest event date will be used. 
2. If a subject did not have PD or death, the censoring date will be the earliest censoring date if the 
subject met multiple censoring criteria (No. 1, No. 3, No. 4, No. 7). 
Key secondary outcome variable: OS 
Overall survival (OS) was planned to be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of 
death from any cause. Subjects who are lost to follow-up and those who are alive at the date of data cut-

off were planned to be censored at the date the subject was last known alive, or date of data cut-off, 
whichever occurs first. 
Analysis model and covariates 
PFS was planned to be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates and the statistical significance of 
the difference in PFS for the 2 primary comparisons was planned to be tested by stratified logrank test. 
Geographic region and MSKCC prognostic groups were planned to be used as stratification factors for 
randomization. The hazard ratio (lenvatinib + everolimus relative to sunitinib and lenvatinib + 
pembrolizumab relative to sunitinib) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were planned 
to be estimated using the Cox regression model with Efron’s method for handling tied results, stratified 
by the same stratification factors. 
The analysis of OS was planned accordingly: 
Overall Survival (OS) was planned to be compared between lenvatinib + everolimus (Arm A) vs. sunitinib 
alone (Arm C) and lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (Arm B) vs. sunitinib alone (Arm C) using the stratified 
logrank test with geographic region (Western Europe and North America vs. Other) and MSKCC 
prognostic groups (favorable, intermediate and poor risk) as strata. The hazard ratio and its 95% CI 
comparing lenvatinib + everolimus (Arm A) vs. sunitinib alone (Arm C) and lenvatinib + pembrolizumab 
(Arm B) vs. sunitinib alone (Arm C) was planned to be estimated by a stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model with Efron’s method for handling tied results, stratified by geographic region and MSKCC 
prognostic groups. Median OS with 2-sided 95% CIs will be calculated using K-M product-limit estimates 
for each treatment arm and K-M estimates of OS were planned to be plotted over time. 
Significance level and multiplicity 
The significance level was set to α=0.05 two-sided. 
To adjust for multiplicity and provide strong control of the overall family-wise error rate (FWER), the 
graphical approach of Maurer and Bretz (Maurer et al., 2013) was planned to be used in the primary 
endpoint of PFS and the key secondary efficacy endpoints (OS and ORR). No multiplicity adjustment was 
planned to be made for other secondary endpoints analyses and exploratory endpoints analyses.  
An α of 0.0001 was planned be subtracted from the total α of 0.05 to account for the interim analysis of 
ORR from Arm B. Figure 11 shows the initial α-allocation (the remaining α = 0.0499) for each hypothesis 
and the graphical approach for multiple analyses of PFS, OS, and ORR.

Figure 11 Graphical Approach to Control Familywise Error Rate for Testing Primary and Key Secondary 
Endpoints  
Initially, another approach to multiplicity was planned but was amended during the course of the study: 
Initially, a truncated Hochberg method was planned for the two primary comparisons of PFS (arm A vs C, 
arm B vs C) with a truncation parameter of 0.7: At the final PFS analysis, if the larger p-value for both 
comparisons is less than 0.0425, then statistical significance for both comparisons was planned to be 
declared. Otherwise, if the other p-value is less than 0.025, then statistical significance for the 
corresponding comparison was planned to be declared. 
In amendment 04, dated 30 Jun 2018, the analysis of ORR was introduced and a portion of α=0.0001 
was allocated to this analysis, leaving α=0.0499 for PFS. 
The graphical approach and bonferroni-type split of the significance level of α=0.045 for arm B vs C and 
α=0.0049 for arm A vs. C was introduced in protocol amendment 06, dated 10 Sep 2019, and replaced 
the previous strategy. 
Interim analyses 
Several interim analyses were planned.  
One interim analysis of PFS after 310 events (80% information) and a final analysis of PFS after 388 
events were planned to be performed. Four analyses of OS were planned, where the final analysis of OS 
was planned to be conducted based on 304 events, and interim analyses were planned at the time of 
interim and final PFS analysis (45% and 60% of information expected) and one year thereafter (80% 
information expected).

Page 42/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The nominal α level for each PFS comparison at the interim and final analyses was planned to be 
determined by a Lan-DeMets spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming (Table 11 ). The nominal α level 
for each OS comparison at the interim and final analyses was planned to be determined by a Lan-DeMets 
spending function with Pocock boundary (Table 12). The actual boundaries were planned to be calculated 
using the observed number of events at the interim and final analyses and α passed from previous tests.

1.Requirement of repeat blood pressure (BP) 
measurements has changed. Repeat BP 
measurement now required only for subjects who 
have an elevated initial BP measurement as follows: 
systolic BP ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg. 
2. Definition of a BP assessment changed from 3 BP 
measurements to 2 BP measurements taken at least 
5 minutes apart. 
3. Time between BP assessments required for 
confirmation of hypertension changed from 2 BP 
assessments taken at least 1 hour apart to 2 BP 
assessments at least 30 minutes apart. 
4. Clarified that subjects with uncontrolled 
hypertension (BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic ≥100 
mmHg) must have their BP monitored on Day 15 (or 
more frequently if clinically indicated) for 2 
consecutive treatment cycles instead of 3 
consecutive months. 
5.Clarified that CTCAE grading for hypertension is to 
be based solely on BP measurements. 
B) Management for proteinuria:1.Clarified that 
CTCAE grading for proteinuria is to be based on a 
24-hour urine result if available. 
2. Added the option to use an immediate spot urine 
protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) test as an 
alternative to a 24-hour urine protein test to 
quantify the 24-hour urine excretion if urine protein 
is ≥2+ (first occurrence or a subsequent 
increase in severity of urine dipstick proteinuria 
occurring on the same lenvatinib/sunitinib dose 
level, or at the new dose level when there has been 
a lenvatinib/sunitinib dose reduction). 
3.Specified that a 24-hour urine protein test is 
required if the UPCR result is ≥2.4. 
4. Clarified that subjects with proteinuria ≥2+ 
should be tested on Day 15 (or more frequently as 
clinically indicated) until the results have been 1+ or 
negative for 2 consecutive treatment cycles instead 
of 3 consecutive months.

Protocol deviations 
The categories for the major protocol deviations are summarized as follows: 
• Exclusion criteria (2 subjects): One subject enrolled with active CNS metastasis and 1 subject had 
significant cardiovascular impairment. 
• Inclusion criteria: One subject enrolled without histological confirmation of RCC with a clear cell 
component. 
• Prohibited concomitant nondrug therapy: Ten subjects received a prohibited anticancer procedure 
(tumor resection or radiation therapy) during study leading to not evaluable tumor assessments and 
censoring of PFS event per IIR. 
• Tumor assessment: Five subjects missed more than 1 consecutive tumor assessment scans leading to 
censoring of PFS event per IIR.

Outcomes and estimation 
Upon availability of IA3 results (DCO 28 Aug 2020), the MAH retrospectively reviewed the results from 
IA2 (DCO 15 Nov 2019); results from IA2 were consistent with those at IA3 with a statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, OS, and ORR.  The results presented in this section are for 
the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, and sunitinib arms from IA3. Median follow-up time for PFS was 22.3 
months (95% CI:  21.1, 25.6) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 16.6 months (95% CI:  
13.1, 18.5) in the sunitinib arm. 
Primary endpoint: Progression-free Survival 
Median PFS based on IIR using RECIST 1.1 was 23.9 months for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 9.2 
months for sunitinib (HR=0.39, [95% CI:  0.32, 0.49], P<0.0001];Table 18).  The P value was less than 
the pre specified P value boundary of 0.0411 and the null hypothesis was rejected. This demonstrates a 
2.6-fold increase in median PFS, and a 61% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death with 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with sunitinib. 
Results for PFS by investigator assessment were consistent with those of PFS by IIR.  Median PFS was 
22.1 months for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with 9.5 months for sunitinib (HR=0.47, [95% 
CI:  0.38, 0.58], nominal P<0.0001).

Figure 12  Study 307:  Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression-Free Survival by Independent Imaging Review 
Using RECIST 1.1 – Full Analysis Set 
Data cutoff date:  28 Aug 2020. 
CSR = Clinical Study Report, HR = hazard ratio, IxRS = interactive voice and web response system, L = lenvatinib, P = pembrolizumab, 
RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, S = sunitinib.Median was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, and the 95% 
CIs were estimated with a generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method.Hazard ratio was estimated from Cox Proportional Hazard 
Model including treatment group as a factor and stratified by IxRS stratification factors.  Efron method was used for ties.P value was 
calculated using log-rank test stratified by IxRS stratification factors. + Censored observations 
Secondary endpoints: 
Overall Survival 
The OS HR of 0.66 (95% CI:  0.49, 0.88, P=0.0049) represents a 34% reduction in the risk of death for 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with sunitinib (Figure 13).  The P value was less than the pre 
specified P value boundary of 0.0161 and the null hypothesis was rejected.  Many subjects remained alive 
at the time of the DCO and median OS was not reached; fewer subjects had died in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm (80; 22.5%) than in the sunitinib arm (101; 28.3%). The median duration of survival 
follow-up was similar for both arms: 26.7 months (95% CI:   25.9, 27.4) for lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab and 26.3 months (95% CI:  25.4, 27.2) for sunitinib.

Objective Response Rate and Duration of Response 
Confirmed ORR per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by IIR in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm was 
approximately double the ORR in the sunitinib arm (71.0% and 36.1%, respectively).  The difference in 
ORR between the treatment arms was 34.9% (95% CI:  28.0, 41.7).  The odds ratio (OR) was 4.35 (95% 
CI:  3.16, 5.97; nominal P<0.0001) in favor of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (Table 21).

• 
Responses occurred early, with a median time to first objective response in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm of 1.94 months, which was approximately at the time of the first scheduled tumor 
assessment scan per protocol. 
• 
Among subjects who responded, the DOR was longer in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm 
compared with the sunitinib arm.  The median DOR in responders was 25.8 months (95% CI:  22.1, 27.9) 
in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 14.6 months (95% CI:  9.4, 16.7) in the sunitinib arm. 
Confirmed ORR per investigator assessment was consistent with the confirmed ORR by IIR. The treatment 
difference between the arms was 34.6% (95% CI:  27.7, 41.4).  The OR was 4.30 (95% CI:  3.13, 5.90; 
nominal P<0.0001) in favor of the combination treatment.  The proportion of subjects who achieved a 
confirmed CR per investigator assessment from lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib was lower to 
that achieved by IIR (10.1% and 2.0%, respectively). 
Health Related Quality of Life 
The impact of treatment on health related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index–Disease-Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS), the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Patients 
With Cancer–Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), and the EQ-5D-3L with the associated EuroQoL Visual Analogue 
Scale (EQ-VAS). All statistical comparisons are nominal in nature and should be interpreted as 
exploratory. 
Subjects who received lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab had better maintenance of HRQoL and less severe 
symptoms compared to those who received sunitinib.  With a mean follow-up time of 46 weeks from 
baseline, the longitudinal analysis of changes from baseline favored lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for 
many scales, and the difference was significant for the EORTC QLQ-C30 physical functioning scale as well 
as for symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and constipation.  From the EORTC QLQ-C30, time to first 
deterioration HRs favored lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for several measures, and the HRs indicated a 
significant difference for physical functioning, dyspnea and appetite loss.  Time to definitive deterioration 
results all favored lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, and the HRs indicated a significant difference for every 
scale except for cognitive functioning and financial difficulties.  When compared to sunitinib, lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab had prolonged time to definitive deterioration of the following functions and 
symptoms:  physical functioning (56 weeks longer), role functioning (27 weeks longer), social functioning 
(27 weeks longer), fatigue (51 weeks longer), insomnia (30 weeks longer), dyspnea (27 weeks longer), 
nausea and vomiting (16 weeks longer), pain (14 weeks longer), appetite loss (10 weeks longer), and 
diarrhea (6 weeks longer).

Title: A Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized, Phase 3 Trial to Compare the Efficacy and 
Safety of Lenvatinib in Combination with Everolimus or Pembrolizumab Versus Sunitinib 
Alone in First-Line Treatment of Subjects with Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (CLEAR). 
Study identifier 
Design 
E7080-G000-307 / KEYNOTE 581 
Study 307/KEYNOTE-581 (Study 307) is an ongoing multicenter, 
randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study evaluating lenvatinib plus everolimus 
(Arm A) or lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (Arm B) versus sunitinib alone 
(Arm C) as first-line treatment in advanced renal cell carcinoma.  This 
submission is for the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, as such, 
the focus for efficacy data is the comparison of Arm B and Arm C. 
Primary objective: to determine the superiority of either combination relative 
to sunitinib alone in improving progression-free survival (PFS).  Key 
secondary efficacy objectives were to assess overall survival (OS) and 
objective response rate (ORR). 
Duration of main phase: 
13 Oct 2016 (first subject signed informed 
consent) to 28 Aug 2020 (data cutoff date for 
this submission).   
Not applicable. 
Duration of Run-in phase: 
Duration of Extension phase:  Will continue as long as the subject is alive, 
unless the subject withdraws consent, is lost 
to follow-up, or the sponsor terminates the 
study. 
Superiority 
Hypothesis:  PFS of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is superior to sunitinib 
alone. 
Hypothesis:  OS of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is superior to sunitinib 
alone. 
Hypothesis:  ORR of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is superior to sunitinib 
alone.

Notes 
Analyses of efficacy data were also conducted using the Per Protocol 
Analysis Set, defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of any 
study drug, had no major protocol deviations, and had both baseline and at 
least 1 postbaseline tumor assessment.   
Prespecified subgroup analyses indicated that consistent results were 
observed across subgroups, MSKCC prognostic groups and PD-L1 tumor

Study 205 demonstrated the efficacy of lenvatinib monotherapy in 2L.  However, the efficacy of lenvatinib 
monotherapy in 1L advanced RCC can be estimated from: 1) data for VEGF TKIs approved as 1L therapy, 
and 2) data for VEGF TKIs with published activity in 1L and 2L advanced RCC.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The new claimed indication for Keytruda in combination with lenvatinib is for the treatment of previously 
untreated adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This application is based on the 
results of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-581.  
KN-581 is a phase III, randomized, open-label study of pembrolizumab+lenvatinib vs. sunitinib in 
subjects with previously untreated, advanced renal cell carcinoma with a clear-cell component. No prior 
adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy was allowed. The study was open-label but given that the primary 
endpoint PFS was BICR-assessed and that OS was a key secondary endpoint, this is acceptable. 
The patient population was adequate and inclusion/exclusion criteria are acceptable in general. Only 
patients with KPS≥70% and measurable disease at baseline (RECIST 1.1) were enrolled. Tumour tissue, 
archival or recent acquisition was required at study entry. Subjects were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 
expression level. 
Although the Applicant is seeking approval in RCC (independent of the histology), no patients with non-
clear cell RCC were included. However, in view of the mechanism of action of the combination it is not 
expected that efficacy is restricted to the clear-cell histological subtype.  
Patients in the trial were classified according to MSKCC scores which includes 5 risk factors (KPS< 80, 
anemia, hypocalcemia, neutropenia and time from diagnosis to treatment initiation < 1 year). The MSKCC 
risk category was favorable for 27.2% of patients, intermediate for 63.8%, and poor for 9.0%. 
A total of 1417 participants were screened and 1069 were randomly allocated from across 200 global 
study sites in North America, Europe, and Asia. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were 
balanced for the pembro+lenvatinib arm and the sunitinib arm, in general.   
. The use of sunitinib as comparator appears acceptable taking into account that this  was the preferred 
option for patients with all risk groups at the time of study initiation in 2016. The shift to new standard of

care in first line RCC across IMDC risk categories to combination regimens (pembrolizumab + axitinib or 
nivolumab + ipilimumab) occurred in European guidelines (ESMO, EAU) during 2018, 2019 and 2020.  
PFS as primary endpoint of the pivotal study is acceptable as prolonged PFS as such is considered to be of 
benefit to the patient and since OS is reported as key secondary endpoint (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.6). OS 
and ORR as secondary endpoints are acceptable.  
The primary endpoint PFS was planned to be tested by means of a stratified logrank test, stratified for the 
randomization stratification variables (Geographic region and MSKCC prognostic groups). Similarly, the 
key-secondary endpoint OS was planned to be tested next in hierarchy (in a graphical approach) by 
means of a stratified logrank test with the same stratification variables. This is considered adequate, 
although uncertainty exist with regard to the censoring rules for PFS. Subjects were censored if they 
progressed or died after initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, and this type of censoring may likely 
be informative. 
Multiplicity was accounted for by application of a graphical approach, An initial α of 0.045 was allocated to 
the comparison of lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (arm B) vs sunitinib (arm C), the remaining alpha was 
allocated as 0.0001 to an early analysis of ORR, and 0.0049 to the comparison of arm A vs C. It was 
planned to forward α from PFS to OS, and then to ORR, whereby portions of α were planned to be 
forwarded to the comparison of arm A vs C (and vice versa from A vs C to B vs C) higher in hierarchy 
(e.g. from OS to PFS). This is in principle considered acceptable. Interim analyses were introduced during 
the course of the study. These were planned to be adjusted for by means of alpha-spending functions, 
which is acceptable.  
Regarding the randomized (ITT) patient population (Arm B and Arm C; n=712), there were no meaningful 
imbalances in patients’ demographic and baseline characteristics among treatment arms. The median age 
of 62.0, and the male (74.4%) and white (74.9 %) preponderance of patients is considered 
representative of the EU target population. The percentage of enrolled patients across IDMC prognostic 
score categories (i.e. 32.9% favourable; 56.5 intermediate; and 9.8% poor risk) is acceptable, however 
patients with poor risk factors seemed to be underrepresented in this trial.  
Acceptable mature PFS results (event rate pembrolizumab + lenvatinib 45.1%; sunitinib: 57.4%) show a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS per IIR for pembrolizumab+ lenvatinib compared with 
sunitinib. There was a clear, early separation (from 2 months on) of the PFS KM curves that widened over 
time. Results for PFS by investigator assessment were consistent with those of PFS by IIR Median PFS 
was 23.9 months for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with 9.2 months for sunitinib (HR=0.39, 
[95% CI:  0.32, 0.49], nominal P<0.0001   This PFS benefit can be regarded as clinically relevant. 
Rather immature OS results (death rate pembrolizumab+lenvatinib: 22.5%; sunitinib: 28.3%; median OS 
not reached in either arm) already show a statistically significant improvement in OS for 
pembrolizumab+lenvatinib compared with sunitinib. There was a clear, separation after 3 month of the 
OS KM curves. This OS benefit (HR 0.66 (95% CI:  0.49, 0.88, P=0.0049) provides support for the 
primary endpoint PFS and the combination of PFS and OS benefit could be regarded as being (clinically) 
relevant to patients.  
The Key secondary endpoint ORR as assessed by IIR was also statistically significantly higher with 
pembrolizumab+lenvatinib compared to sunitinib: 71.0% vs 36.1%. In addition, more patients in the 
pembrolizumab+lenvatinib arm had a CR compared to the sunitinib arm: 16.1% vs 4.2%. The 
investigator-assessed ORR results were confirmatory. Among subjects who responded, the DOR was 
longer in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared with the sunitinib arm.  The median DOR in 
responders was 25.8 months (95% CI:  22.1, 27.9) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 14.6 
months (95% CI:  9.4, 16.7) in the sunitinib arm.

Secondary endpoint HRQoL results are considered of a descriptive, hypothesis-generating nature only. It 
is, nevertheless, noted that subjects who received lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab had better maintenance 
of HRQoL and less severe symptoms compared to those who received sunitinib.   
PFS2 results were immature (event rate pembrolizumab +lenvatinib 27.9%; sunitinib: 43.7%; median 
PFS2 not reached in the pembrolizumab+lenvatinib arm and at IA3 a relatively low percentage of patients 
had received subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy), however PFS2 data could be regarded as 
supportive.  
Subgroup analysis 
PFS and HRs for almost all subgroups favoured pembrolizumab+ lenvatinib vs sunitinib (HR <1).  
Only in the subgroup of patients with favourable IMDC prognostic score (n=110),  the point estimate of 
the OS HR (numerically) favoured sunitinib (1.15 (95% CI:  0.55, 2.40). However, an event rate of 12% 
is considered too immature to draw conclusions and updated OS data are requested post-approval. The 
95% CI for OS HR was wide for some subgroups, indicating that there is still uncertainty on the effect on 
OS.   
The combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab demonstrated superiority vs sunitinib in terms of PFS; 
in addition, OS and ORR results favour lenvatinib and pembrolizumab treatment vs sunitinib. However, 
the immaturity of OS data remains at present the main source of uncertainty for benefit/risk assessment, 
including in the relevant subgroups. The MAH is recommended to submit the final OS analysis from the 
E7080-G000-307/KEYNOTE 581 study which is comparing the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in 
combination with lenvatinib and lenvatinib plus everolimus vs. sunitinib monotherapy as a first-Line 
treatment of patients with advanced RCC.   
Contribution of each component in the combination regimen. 
The absence of a clinical trial testing the combination and monotherapies (pembrolizumab and lenvatinib) 
leads to uncertainties when it comes to reaching a benefit risk conclusion. Nevertheless the antitumor 
activity of the combination was greater than either monotherapy in murine isograft models tested, 
however the difference between the combination treatment and lenvatinib monotherapy was not striking.  
To support the contribution of lenvatinib, the applicant provided data from the phase 2 trial KN-427, 
where 110 patients with ccRCC were included in a pembrolizumab monotherapy cohort A. Considering 
that the measured baseline characteristics could be regarded as comparable and the ORR rate is almost 
doubled with the combination, this comparison indicates a contribution of lenvatinib. In addition, various 
data of other trials with sunitinib as comparator and PD-L1-inhibitor and TKI  as active treatment indicate 
that PD-1 monotherapy treatment alone is not superior to sunitinib (Powles et al. 2020; Agata et al. 
1996; Motzer et al. 2019).  
For substantiating the individual contribution of pembrolizumab, the MAH had provided a cross-study 
comparison between KEYNOTE-581 and Study205. The ORR was also almost doubled in KEYNOTE-581 
compared to the monotherapy treatment in Study205. However, Study205 included 2LRCC patients. The 
efficacy of lenvatinib monotherapy in 1L advanced RCC was estimated from: 1) data for VEGF TKIs 
approved as 1L therapy, and 2) data for VEGF TKIs with published activity in 1L and 2L advanced RCC.   
It can be agreed that this indirect comparison provides sufficient evidence for the contribution of 
pembrolizumab to the pembrolizumab+lenvatinib combination in 1L RCC patients.  
The lack of monotherapy experimental arms in KEYNOTE-581 prevents a precise quantitative assessment 
of the contribution of each component of the pembrolizumab+lenvatinib combination. Nevertheless, the 
additive efficacy of both individual components has sufficiently been shown in a qualitative sense based 
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 83/149 
 
 
 
 
 
primarily on a substantial increase in ORR over the individual agents, even though based on cross-study 
comparisons only. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the single pivotal study KEYNOTE-581, the pembrolizumab+lenvatinib combination demonstrated a 
clinically relevant and statistically significant improvement in PFS per IIR compared with sunitinib 
treatment. Pembrolizumab+lenvatinib also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the key 
secondary endpoints OS and ORR (per IIR) compared to sunitinib. However, OS data are still immature 
and mOS was not reached in key subgroups even with the updated OS analysis provided during the 
procedure. Study 307 lacked monotherapy controls, hampering the assessment of contribution of 
components to the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination. Cross-trial comparisons have been 
provided but evaluation of contribution of lenvatinib, either additive or synergic to pembrolizumab, has 
limitations due to the fact that 1L therapy in study 307 is being compared with 2L therapy in study 205. 
Nevertheless, the numerically higher PFS, OS and ORR for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in study 307 
compared with lenvatinib monotherapy (2L) or pembrolizumab (1L) study comparison can be viewed as 
supportive. 
In order to further evaluate the efficacy of Kisplyx in combination with pembrolizumab in the MSKCC 
favourable prognosis subgroups in first line treatment of adults patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC), the MAH is recommended to submit the final OS analysis from the E7080-G000-
307/KEYNOTE 581 study which is comparing the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in combination 
with lenvatinib and lenvatinib plus everolimus vs. sunitinib monotherapy as a first-Line treatment of 
patients with advanced RCC.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The primary data to support the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC indication are from the 
ongoing, open-label, phase 3 Study 307 (KEYNOTE-581). Safety data from 352 subjects enrolled in Arm B 
of Study 307 who received at least 1 dose of either study drug (lenvatinib or pembrolizumab) and 340 
subjects enrolled in Arm C who received at least 1 dose of sunitinib were used for the safety assessment 
in this submission: 
• 
Indication Safety Set (N=352): All subjects from Study 307 with 1L RCC who received at least 1 
dose of lenvatinib 20 mg or pembrolizumab 200 mg as of the data cutoff date of 28 Aug 2020.  
•  Sunitinib Safety Set (N=340): All subjects from Study 307 with 1L RCC who received at least 1 
dose of sunitinib 50 mg. 
Further safety data are presented from the 
•  All RCC Safety Set (N=497): Subjects from Study 307 and Study 111 with RCC who received at 
least 1 dose of lenvatinib 20 mg QD + pembrolizumab 200 mg as starting dose, regardless of prior 
anticancer therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 84/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Non-RCC Safety Set (N=215): Subjects in non-RCC cohorts (NSCLC, endometrial carcinoma, 
urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma) from Study 111 and 
Study 115 who were treated with lenvatinib 20 mg QD + pembrolizumab 200 mg as starting dose. 
•  Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (N=1119): All subjects with starting dose level of lenvatinib 
24 mg QD monotherapy from 11 studies. 
•  Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-A Safety Set (N=2799): Subjects treated with pembrolizumab 
in studies KN001 Part B1, B2, B3, D, C, F1, F2, F3, KN002 (original phase), KN006, and KN010, 
including 1567 subjects with advanced melanoma and 1232 subjects with NSCLC. 
•  Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-B Safety Set (N=5884): Subjects treated with 
pembrolizumab, including 5884 subjects from studies of melanoma, NSCLC, cHL, urothelial cancer, 
and HNSCC in EU-approved indications. 
Safety data from the Indication Safety Set are assessed relative to the data from the Lenvatinib and 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets.  
Patient exposure 
At the time of data cut-off (28-Aug 2020), the median duration of treatment was 17.00 months in 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and was 7.84 months in the sunitinib arm.  
The median duration of treatment with each individual study drug was longer in the Indication Safety Set 
than in the respective monotherapy safety sets: 16.13 months and 5.55 months, respectively, for 
lenvatinib; 15.08 months and 4.86 months (RSD-B), respectively, for pembrolizumab (Table 30).  
In the Indication Safety Set, similar percentages of subjects received lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
beyond 1 year: 64.2%, 44.0%, and 29.0% of subjects received lenvatinib for ≥12 months, ≥18 months, 
and ≥24 months, respectively, and 60.5%, 39.8%, and 15.6% of subjects received pembrolizumab for 
≥12 months, ≥18 months, and ≥24 months, respectively.

In the Indication Safety Set, the median percentage of the planned dose of lenvatinib received was 
69.65% and the median dose intensity was 13.93 mg per day. In the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety 
Set, where subjects received a higher starting dose of lenvatinib (24 mg), the median percentage of 
planned dose and the median dose intensity were higher (83.61% and 20.07 mg per day, respectively) 
(Table 31).  
The median dose intensity of sunitinib was 83.18% of intended dose (41.59 mg/day dose intensity per 
subject).

b: Received dose as percentage of planned starting dose = 100 × dose intensity (mg/day)/planned starting dose (20 mg/day for Lenv + 
Pembro combination therapy or 24 mg/day for Lenv Monot). 
In the Indication Safety Set, the median number of doses of pembrolizumab per subject was 22.0 doses, 
higher than that in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets, where the median 
number of doses was 7.0 and 8.0 doses, respectively.

Characteristics of Study Population 
Of the 352 subjects in the Indication Safety Set, the majority were overweight, white and male, and the 
overall median age was 63.5 years.  Demographic characteristics of the Indication Safety Set were 
generally consistent with those of the Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets, with the 
following exceptions: 
•  A higher proportion of male subjects were included in the Indication Safety Set (71.6%) than in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy and Pembrolizumab (RSD-A and RSD B) Monotherapy Safety Sets (49.5%, 
59.3%, and 66.1%, respectively).  Also, a greater proportion of subjects had baseline hypertension 
and impaired renal function (ie, a CrCl of <60 mL/min) in the Indication Safety Set (57.4% and 
30.1%, respectively) than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (47.3% and 14.0%, respectively; 
no data available for Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets). These differences are expected 
considering the disease under study. 
• 
The proportion of subjects from the Rest of World geographic region was higher in the Indication 
Safety Set (44.0%) than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy and Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and 
RSD-B) Safety Sets (24.8%, 17.0%, and 27.2%).

Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs sunitinib 
Nearly all subjects in both the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms had at least 1 TEAE 
(99.7% vs 98.5%) and related TEAE (96.9% vs 92.1%). For other AE categories higher incidences were 
reported in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared to the sunitinib arm, including Grade ≥3 
and related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (82.4% vs 71.8% and 71.6% vs. 58.8%), non-fatal SAEs (50.0% vs 
32.6%), and TEAEs leading  to discontinuation of either lenvatinib or pembrolizumab (37.2% vs 14.4%). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of all study drugs was similar in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms (13.4% vs 14.4% of subjects). TEAEs leading to dose reduction of 
lenvatinib in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm occurred in 68.8% of subjects, which was higher 
than in the sunitinib arm (50.3% of subjects). TEAEs leading to dose interruption of either study drug in 
the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm occurred in 78.4% of subjects, which was higher than in the 
sunitinib arm (53.8% of subjects). Fatal TEAEs (Grade 5) were reported in 15 subjects (4.3%) in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm, which was similar to 11 subjects (3.2%) in the sunitinib arm.  
Adjusted by drug exposure, the rates of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was comparable at 1.95 and 2.06 per SY but 
remained numerically higher for SAEs (0.72 vs 0.55 per SY) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 
sunitinib arms, respectively. 
Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab vs lenvatinib or pembrolizumab monotherapy  
The incidences of most TEAEs categories were similar between the Indication Safety Set and the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, including any TEAEs (99.7% and 99.0%, respectively), treatment-
related TEAEs (96.9% and 94.7%), Grade ≥3 TEAEs (82.4% and 80.3%), nonfatal SAEs (50.0% and 
51.8%), and fatal AEs (4.3% and 8.7%). The rate of related Grade ≥3 TEAEs was numerically higher in 
the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (71.6% and 64.7%), 
mainly driven by Grade 4 events (11.6% and 4.7%). Adjusted by drug exposure, incidences for all TEAEs 
categories were numerically lower in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy 
Safety Set.     
The comparison of the Indication Safety Set with pembrolizumab monotherapy demonstrated 
considerably lower incidences for pembrolizumab monotherapy across all TEAEs categories.

In the Indication Safety Set, the most commonly reported (occurring in >30% of subjects) TEAEs, by 
decreasing incidence, were diarrhea (61.4%), hypertension (55.4%), hypothyroidism (47.2%), decreased 
appetite (40.3%), fatigue (40.1%), nausea (35.8%), and stomatitis (34.7%) (Table 35). 
For sunitinib the most commonly reported TEAEs (>30%) were diarrhea (49.4%), hypertension (41.5%), 
stomatitis (38.5%), PPE (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia) syndrome (37.4%), fatigue (36.8%), 
nausea (33.2%), and decreased appetite (30.9%).  
TEAEs that occurred at a higher incidence in subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared 
with the sunitinib arm (≥10% difference) were diarrhea (61.4% vs 49.4%), hypertension (55.4% vs 
41.5%), hypothyroidism (47.2% vs 26.5%), abdominal pain (21% vs 8.2%), weight decreased (29.8% 
vs 9.1%), arthralgia (28.1% vs 15.3%), myalgia (15.9% vs 3.5%), proteinuria (29.5% vs 12.6%), 
dysphonia (29.8% vs 4.1%), and rash (27.3% vs 13.8%); additional notable TEAEs that occurred in 
subjects at a higher incidence but <10% difference included lipase increased (18.2% vs 12.9%), amylase 
increased (17.9% vs 8.2%), adrenal insufficiency (4.8% vs 0%), and pneumonitis (5.1% vs 0%). 
When adjusted by episodes per treatment duration, the rates of aforementioned TEAEs became 
comparable between the two arms for the most frequently reported TEAEs: diarrhea, hypertension, 
hypothyroidism, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea and stomatitis. The rates remain higher in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared to the sunitinib arm for dysphonia (0.26 vs 0.05 per SY), 
weight decreased (0.24 vs 0.09 per SY), proteinuria (0.37 vs 0.22 per SY), myalgia (0.12 vs 0.05 per 
SY), amylase increased (0.20 vs 0.12 per SY), adrenal insufficiency (0.04 vs 0 per SY), and pneumonitis 
(0.04 vs 0 per SY).

The most common treatment-related TEAEs (≥30% of subjects in either arm) in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm and sunitinib arm, in decreasing incidence, were diarrhea (54.5% vs 44.4%), 
hypertension (52.3% vs 39.1%), hypothyroidism (42.6% vs 23.2%), stomatitis (32.1% vs 37.4%), 
fatigue (32.1% vs 32.1%), decreased appetite (34.9% vs 24.7%), and PPE (28.1% vs 35.9%). 
The incidence of treatment related TEAEs in the Indication Safety Set were generally consistent with that 
in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy or Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety (RSD-A and RSD-B) Sets, with the 
exceptions of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Diarrhea (54.5%, 45.4%, 12.3%, and 10.7%, respectively) 
Hypothyroidism (42.6%, 11.1%, 7.6%, and 9.6%, respectively) 
Increased amylase (15.1%, 0.9%, 0.2%, and 0.2%, respectively)  
Increased lipase (14.2%, 2.8%, 0.1%, and 0.3%, respectively)

COVID-19 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
TEAEs due to COVID-19 were reported in 1 subject (0.3%) each in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
arm and the sunitinib arm; both cases reported a Grade 2 TEAE of COVID-19 pneumonia that were 
considered by the investigator not to be related to study drug. Study treatment was interrupted for both 
subjects but was resumed upon recovery at the same dose; both subjects continued on treatment as of 
the data cutoff date.

Grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported in 82.4% of subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm and 
71.8% of subjects in the sunitinib arm; the rate of severe TEAE episodes adjusted for treatment duration 
was similar between the 2 arms (1.95 and 2.06 per SY, respectively).

Compared to the Indication Safety Set, the incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was similar in the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set (80.3%), but lower for Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-A (45.5%) and RSD-B 
(48.1%).  
Related Grade ≥3 TEAEs were numerically highest in the Indication Safety Set (71.6% vs. 58.5% for 
sunitib, 64.7% in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set and only 15.6% for Pembrolizumab 
Monotherapy).  
Grade 3 TEAEs were reported in 63.4% and 59.1% of subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 
sunitinib arms, respectively. The most common Grade 3 TEAEs (≥5% of subjects in either arm) in 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms, respectively, were: hypertension (27.6% vs 18.8%), 
diarrhea (9.7% vs 5.0%), weight decreased (8.0% vs 0.3%), proteinuria (7.7% vs 2.9%), amylase 
increased (7.4% vs 2.1%), lipase increased (7.1% vs 6.2%), and asthenia (5.4% vs 4.4%). 
Grade 4 TEAEs occurred in 14.8% of subjects in the combination arm and 9.4% of subjects in the 
sunitinib arm. The only Grade 4 TEAEs that occurred in 1% or more of subjects in the combination or 
sunitinib arms, respectively, were lipase increased (5.7% vs 2.6%) and amylase increased (1.7% vs 
0.9%). 
The incidence and type of Grade 3 and Grade 4 TEAEs observed in the Indication Safety Set were 
generally consistent with one or more monotherapy safety sets except for the following TEAEs:  increased 
lipase and increased amylase, QT prolongation, pancreatitis, increased ALT and increased AST, adrenal 
insufficiency, acute myocardial infarction and myocardial infarction, rash, and renal failure (see Table 39).

Treatment-related Grade ≥3 AEs 
In the Indication Safety Set, most common Grade 3 treatment-related TEAEs (occurring in ≥5% of 
subjects) were hypertension (25.3%), diarrhea (8.2%), proteinuria (7.4%), increased amylase and 
decreased weight (6.0% each), and increased lipase (5.4%). The only treatment related Grade 4 TEAEs 
that occurred in 3 or more subjects in the Indication Safety Set were increased lipase (4.3%), increased 
amylase (1.4%), and decreased neutrophil count and hyperlipasemia (0.9% each). 
The incidence and type of severe treatment-related TEAEs observed in the Indication Safety Set was 
generally consistent with that in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy or Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and 
RSD-B) Safety Sets, with the following exceptions:  increased lipase (9.7%, 1.1%, <0.1%, and 0.2%, 
respectively) and increased amylase (7.4%, 0.4%, <0.1%, and 0.1%, respectively). These findings are 
consistent with those for overall severe TEAEs. 
ADRs pooled across RCC participants to support update of SmPC  
Safety Data Supporting Section 4.8 Of Summary Of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC combines in a new single column the ADRs from pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib 
and  pembrolizumab  plus  axitinib  therapies.  Pembrolizumab  plus  Lenvatinib  is  based  on  KEYNOTE-581 
(Study 307), KEYNOTE-146 (Study 111) and KEYNOTE-775 (Study 309), and pembrolizumab plus axitinib 
is based on KEYNOTE-426. 
The frequencies included are based on all reported adverse drug reactions, regardless of the investigator 
assessment of causality.  
Adverse reactions included in Table 2 of the SmPC: 
Table A below encompasses the adverse reactions included in Table 2 of the SmPC with related frequency 
categories and figures from the KEYNOTE-581, KEYNOTE-146, KEYNOTE-775, and KEYNOTE-426 studies 
with the combination of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib or pembrolizumab plus axitinib. 
Database cutoff dates were:  
- 
- 
for Endometrial Cancer: KN146 18AUG2020; KN775 26OCT2020; 
for RCC: KN426 24AUG2018; KN581 28AUG2020 
The criteria for populating Table 2 in the Keytruda SmPC are as follows (meeting at least one of the 
criteria): 
- 
- 
- 
Keytruda ADR terms in the monotherapy column carried over for all subsequent columns when 
observed for the combination and adjusted to the appropriate frequency category based on the 
pooled data 
Agency mandated terms 
AEs not already ADRs for Keytruda and occurring at an incidence higher than the respective 
monotherapy safety profiles were assessed for additive or potentiated effect and clinical relevance. 
No new ADRs were assessed for the individual monotherapies or for the combination; therefore, no new

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Nonfatal SAEs were reported in 50.0% and 32.6% of subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 
sunitinib arms, respectively; the rate of nonfatal SAE episodes adjusted for treatment duration was 0.68 
and 0.51 per SY, respectively. 
In the Indication Safety Set, the most frequently reported nonfatal SAEs (occurring in >2% of subjects) 
were diarrhea (3.4%), vomiting (2.8%), pneumonitis (2.6%), and acute kidney injury and hypertension 
(2.3% each).   
SAEs that occurred at a higher incidence in subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm compared 
with the sunitinib arm, respectively, were: diarrhea (3.4% vs 1.2%), pneumonitis (2.6% vs 0%), 
vomiting (2.8% vs 0.9%), acute kidney injury (2.3% vs 1.2%), hypertension (2.3% vs 0.6%), adrenal 
insufficiency (2.0% vs 0%), myocardial infarction (1.7% vs 0.3%), acute myocardial infarction (1.4% vs 
0%), immune-mediated hepatitis and lipase increased (1.1% vs 0% for both), renal failure (1.1% vs 
0.6%), and pancreatitis (1.7% vs 0%).

Drug-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 33.8% of subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm 
and 15.0% of subjects in the sunitinib arm. In the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm, the most 
frequently reported treatment-related SAEs (occurring in >1% of subjects) were diarrhoea (2.8%), 
vomiting (2%), hypertension (2%), and nausea, acute kidney injury, and myocardial infarction (1.1% 
each). In the sunitinib arm, pyrexia (1.5%) was the only related SAEs that occurred >1%. 
Deaths 
Progressive disease (PD) was monitored as part of the efficacy assessments and was not recorded as an 
AE, unless malignant neoplasm progression was the only term the study investigator could use to 
describe a fatal event. If PD led to an untoward medical occurrence (eg, pleural effusion, spinal cord 
compression), the medical occurrence was recorded as an AE. All death events, other than the reported

Treatment emergent deaths were reported for 27 subjects (7.7%) in the Indication Safety Set. Out of 
these 27 subjects, 12 (3.4%) deaths were reported to be due to ‘malignant neoplasm progression’ (no 
further discussion provided).  
Among the 15 subjects with other fatal AEs (4.3%) in the Indication Safety Set, 5 subjects (1.4%) had 
other TEAEs that were associated with PD (dyspnoea, cardio-respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, multiple 
organ dysfunction, and arrhythmia/cardio-respiratory arrest). Four subjects (1.1%) had fatal AEs 
attributed to study drug by the investigator (increased blood creatinine, hypertensive crisis, and 
myasthenic syndrome reported in 1 subject each and 1 subject who had a fatal AE of autoimmune 
hepatitis along with fatal AEs of myocarditis, pneumonitis, and nephritis).  
Six subjects in the Indication Safety Set had fatal AEs that were neither attributed by the investigator to 
study treatment nor to PD (subarachnoid hemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm, Klebsiella sepsis, and death 
(unknown cause), reported in 1 subject each; and sepsis reported in 2 subjects). Sponsor assessment of 
attribution for these events was consistent with the investigator assessment except for the event of 
subarachnoid haemorrhage. Hemorrhagic events is a CSE for lenvatinib and this subject experienced 
subarachnoid hemorrhage during Cycle 14 in the setting of elevated BP while on study drugs; therefore, 
the sponsor considered subarachnoid hemorrhage as related to study treatment. 
The incidence of fatal AEs, excluding ‘malignant neoplasm progression’, was 4.3% in the Indication Safety 
Set, 3.2% in the sunitinib arm, 8.7% in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, and 3.9% and 5.3%, 
respectively, in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets, indicating that there is 
no increased risk of fatal AEs with combination therapy. The same was observed when adjusted for 
exposure, the rate of fatal AEs was 0.04 episodes per subject-year in the Indication Safety Set, 0.03 in 
the sunitinib arm and 0.09, 0.06, and 0.08 episodes per subject-year in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy and 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets, respectively.

Other clinically significant events  
CSE for lenvatinib  
The following events are established as Clinically Significant Adverse Events (CSEs) from the overall 
clinical development program for lenvatinib:  arterial thromboembolic events, cardiac dysfunction, 
hypothyroidism, gastrointestinal perforation, fistula formation, hemorrhage, hepatotoxicity, hypertension, 
hypocalcemia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES), posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES), proteinuria, QT prolongation, and renal events. 
The overall incidence of CSEs of all grades, serious CSEs, and CSEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
were generally similar in the Indication and Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Sets.  In the Indication Safety 
Set, most of the Grade ≥3 CSEs were Grade 3. CSE leading to dose reductions were higher in the 
Indication Safety Set than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Sets. 
Fourteen (4.0%) subjects had Grade 4 CSEs:  arterial thromboembolic events (3 subjects), 
hepatotoxicity events (5 subjects), hypertension events (1 subject), hypocalcemia events (1 subject), 
PRES events (1 subject), and renal events (3 subjects).   
Five (1.4%) subjects had fatal events in the following CSE categories:  hemorrhage events (2 subjects:  
PT ruptured aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage), hepatotoxicity events (1 subject:  PT autoimmune 
hepatitis), hypertension events (1 subject:  PT hypertensive crisis), and renal events (2 subjects:  PT 
increased blood creatinine and nephritis).

a:  Indicates the number of subjects who had events on sunitinib which are considered CSEs for lenvatinib. 
b:  CSE categories are based on either a standardized MedDRA query or customized MedDRA query 
Higher incidences in the Indication Safety Set than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set were 
reported for the CSEs of hypothyroidism, renal events, and hepatotoxicity (see discussion below).  CSEs 
of hypothyroidism and hepatotoxicity occurred at a similar incidence in the Indication Safety Set and the 
Non-RCC Safety Set; both lenvatinib and pembrolizumab are associated with hypothyroidism and liver 
toxicity.   
Similar incidences in the Indication Safety Set and the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set are noted for 
all other CSEs. QT prolongation, arterial thromboembolic events, and cardiac dysfunction are discussed 
further.  
Hypothyroidism 
Thyroid dysfunction is a known class effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors due to the antiangiogenic effect 
on the thyroid blood vessels. Hypothyroidism is also an AEOSI for pembrolizumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 109/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of the CSE of hypothyroidism in the Indication Safety Set (56.8%) was higher than that in 
the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set and similar to that in the Non-RCC Safety Set (19.8% and 47.0%, 
respectively). Of note, approximately half of subjects in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set had 
thyroid cancers, likely had thyroid resection and/or radio iodine ablation, and were, therefore, already 
receiving thyroid replacement therapy. The majority of CSE of hypothyroidism in the Indication Safety Set 
were Grade 1 (14.5%) or Grade 2 (40.9%); the incidence of Grade 3 events was 1.4% in the Indication 
Safety Set, 0.8% in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, and 0.5% in the Non-RCC Safety Set.  
Renal events 
The incidence of the CSE of Renal events in the Indication Safety Set (22.2%) was higher than that in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (10.0%) and the Non-RCC Safety Set (12.1%;) but similar compared 
to the All RCC Safety Set (22.5%).  
The majority of renal events in the Indication Safety Set were Grade 1 (9.4%) or Grade 2 (7.1%). Grade 
3 and 4 events were reported with 4.3% and 0.9% (compared to 2.2% and 0.2% in the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set). Reported incidences in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set were: 4.3% vs. 2.4% for SAEs, 1.7% vs. 0.4% for discontinuations of lenvatinib, 
and 5.1% vs. 1.9% for dose interruptions of lenvatinib.   
Higher incidences in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set were 
reported for the preferred terms increased blood creatinine (13.6% vs 4.8%), and renal failure (2.8% vs 
0.9%). In the All RCC Safety Set, rate of increased blood creatinine was 14.9% and rate of renal failure 
was 2.6%. Acute kidney injury was reported in 3.7% in the Indication Safety Set vs 2.9% in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. Serious TEAEs of acute kidney injury were reported for 2.3% of 
subjects in the Indication Safety Set (and 1.8% of subjects in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set).  
Hepatotoxicity 
The incidence of the CSE of hepatotoxicity in the Indication Safety Set (27.3%) was higher than that in 
the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (17.5%) but similar compared to the Non RCC Safety Set 
(22.8%). The majority of events were Grade 1 (9.1%) or Grade 2 (8.2%) in the Indication Safety Set. 
Grade 3 events were 8.2% and 4.7%, Grade 4 events 1.4% and 0.4% in the Indication Safety Set and 
the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, respectively. One subject (0.3%) in the Indication Safety Set had 
a Grade 5 event (autoimmune hepatitis); in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, the incidence of 
Grade 5 events was similar (0.4%). 
Incidences of hepatotoxicity in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety 
Set were 3.1% vs. 1.7% for SAEs, 1.1% vs. 0.8% for discontinuations, 8.5% vs 3.1% for dose 
interruptions and 4.3% vs. 2.1% for dose reductions. 
QT Prolongation 
The overall incidence of QT prolongation events is similar in the Indication and Lenvatinib Monotherapy 
Safety Sets (6.5% and 4.8%).  Grade 3 events were reported at a higher incidence in the Indication 
Safety Set (2.8%) than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (1.1%). In the Indication Safety Set, 8 
subjects (2.8%) had cardiac-related TEAEs that were associated with QT prolongation events:  4 subjects 
had Grade 2 QT prolongation events associated with TEAEs of mild arrhythmias (sinus bradycardia or 
supra ventricular extrasystole) or mild LV dysfunction, and 4 subjects each had one Grade 3 QT 
prolongation event associated with atrial fibrillation, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, or acute cardiac 
failure. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation, interruption, and reduction of lenvatinib were 
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021

reported at a similar incidence in the Indication Safety Set (0.3%, 0%, and 0.6%, respectively) and the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (0.1%, 0.9%, and 0.3%, respectively. 
Arterial Thromboembolic Events 
The incidence of arterial thromboembolic events was higher in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm 
compared with the sunitinib arm (5.4 and 2.1%, respectively). 
The incidence of the CSE arterial thromboembolic events was similar between the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm (5.4%) and the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (5.7%); however, a clinically 
meaningful difference was noted in the incidence for the PTs of acute myocardial infarction and 
myocardial infarction (all AEs of myocardial infarction were Grade 3 or 4 in the Indication Safety Set).  
Table 45 TEAEs by SOC and PT  
Cardiac Dysfunction 
The incidence of the CSE of cardiac dysfunction events was similar in the Indication Safety Set (2.6%), 
the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (5.5%) and in the sunitinib arm (2.1%).

Table 46 Overview of CSAEs for Lenvatinib ; cardiac dysfunction events 
Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction events were congestive cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 
decreased, left ventricular dysfunction and stress cardiomyopathy reported in 1 subject each and cardiac 
failure reported in 2 subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm; A review of the 6 subjects with 
Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction events in the Indication Safety Set indicated that the majority of the subjects 
had pre-existing risk factors: the subject with stress cardiomyopathy had multiple pericardial tumor 
lesions along with a reduced ejection fraction (30%) reported on Day 3; the subject with left ventricular 
dysfunction had this condition at Baseline; the subject with congestive cardiac failure had baseline aortic 
valve incompetence, stenosis, and replacement with left bundle branch block; the subject with acute 
cardiac failure had a pre-existing condition of atrial fibrillation and had an associated TEAE of QT 
prolongation.  One subject with cardiac failure had concurrent Grade 3 myocarditis. 
AEOSI for pembrolizumab  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) are categories comprised of groups of PTs developed by the 
MAH during the pembrolizumab monotherapy program to assess the frequency of immune-mediated 
events considered by the MAH to be causally related to pembrolizumab. 
The overall incidence of AEOSI was higher in the Indication Safety Set (60.8%) than in the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets (21.4% and 25.1%, respectively). The 
majority of AEOSI events were Grade 1 and 2; however higher incidences of AEOSI in the Indication 
Safety Set were also observed for Grade ≥3 (14.8% vs 6.5%), serious AEOSI (12.5% vs 6.5%) and 
AEOSI leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab (10.2% vs 3.9% for the Indication Safety Set vs the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-B Safety Set, respectively; see Table 47).  In the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm, the incidence of Grade ≥3 AEOSI was 14.8%, consisting primarily of Grade 3 events 
(12.8%). Five subjects (1.4%) had Grade 4 AEOSI; these were immune-hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, 
pneumonitis, severe skin reactions (PT toxic epidermal necrolysis), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (PT 
diabetic ketoacidosis). Two subjects (0.4%) had Grade 5 AEOSI: myocarditis, nephritis, pneumonitis, and 
hepatitis in 1 subject, and myasthenic syndrome in the other subject.

The higher incidence of all-grade AEOSI in the Indication Safety Set was primarily driven by 
hypothyroidism (47.2%, 8.5%, and 11.1%, respectively). Further AEOSI with an increased incidence in 
the Indication Safety Set compared to the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets 
were hyperthyroidism (8.0%, 3.4%, and 4.2%, respectively), adrenal insufficiency (5.1%, 0.8%, and 
0.8%), severe skin reactions (5.1%, 1.4%, and 1.6%), and pancreatitis (2.8%, 0.3%, and 0.3%). [- 
Numerically higher incidences in the Indication Safety set were also reported for AEOSIs of colitis (2.6%, 
1.7%, 1.1%), hepatitis (2.0%, 0.7%, 0.5%), myocarditis (1.1% vs. 0%, 0%), and nephritis (1.7%, 
0.3%, 0.4%). Pneumonitis was reported for 5.4%, 3.4%, and 4.5% of subjects, incidences of Grade ≥3 
pneumonitis events were 2.0%, 1.3% and 1.5%. - ]

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the relevant safety set. 
Subjects with 2 or more TEAEs reported in the same special interest category or PT were counted only once in the worst CTCAE grade. 
Adverse event terms were coded using MedDRA version 23.0. 
Adverse events were graded using CTCAE version 4.03. 
Data cutoff date:  28 Aug 2020 for Study 307; for all other studies, the clinical cutoff dates specified in ISS SAP version 2.0 were used. 
1L = first line, AEOSI = adverse event of special interest, CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Lenv = 
lenvatinib, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, Monotx = monotherapy, Pembro = pembrolizumab, PT = preferred 
term, Q3W = once every 3 weeks, QD = once daily, RCC = renal cell carcinoma, RSD = Reference Safety Dataset, TEAE = treatment 
emergent adverse event. 
Hypothyroidism 
TEAEs of hypothyroidism were reported for a higher proportion of subjects in the Indication Safety Set 
(47.2%) than in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A or RSD-B) Safety Sets (8.5%, and 11.1%, 
respectively).  In the Indication Safety Set, most of the events of hypothyroidism (97.0%) were Grade 1 
or 2.  The remaining 5 events were all Grade 3.  The incidence of drug discontinuation due to 
hypothyroidism was low in both the Indication Safety Set and the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A 
and RSD-B) Safety Sets (0.6%, <0.1%, and <0.1%, respectively).   
Hyperthyroidism 
TEAEs of hyperthyroidism were reported for a higher proportion of subjects in the Indication Safety Set 
(8.0%) than in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A or RSD-B) Safety Sets (3.4%, and 4.2%, 
respectively); the same was also observed for treatment-related TEAEs (6.3%, 2.9%, and 3.7%, 
respectively).  All hyperthyroidism events in the Indication Safety Set were Grade 1 and 2 with no Grade 
≥3 events.  In the Indication Safety Set, hyperthyroidism did not lead to drug discontinuation and led to 
pembrolizumab interruption in only 2 subjects (0.6%). 
Adrenal Insufficiency 
TEAEs of adrenal insufficiency were reported for a higher proportion of subjects in the Indication Safety 
Set (5.1.%) than in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets (0.8%). Adrenal insufficiency events in 
the Indication Safety Set were mostly Grade 1 or 2 (14 of 18 subjects).  The remaining 4 events were all 
Grade 3 (1.1% in the Indication Safety Set and 0.3% in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets).

Of the 18 subjects, 14 had prior nephrectomy/adrenalectomy and another subject had preexisting 
pituitary adenoma with secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.  Adrenal insufficiency was managed with 
drug discontinuation of pembrolizumab (1 subject [0.3%]) and drug interruption (5 subjects [1.4%]), 
systemic corticosteroids as appropriate, and standard medical care as per the protocol. 
Severe Skin Reactions 
Severe skin reaction AEOSI in the Indication Safety Set were mostly Grade 3 (4.8%) with 1 Grade 4 
(0.3%) event, and were reported at a higher incidence than that in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy 
(RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets (Grade 3:  1.1% and 1.3%, respectively; Grade 4:  0% and 0%).  The 
incidence of severe skin reaction events leading to drug discontinuation was low in both the Indication 
Safety Set and the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets (1.4%, 0.1%, and 
0.2%).  The event led to drug interruption in 6 subjects (1.7%) in the Indication Safety Set.   
Pancreatitis 
The overall pancreatitis incidence in the Indication Safety Set was higher than that in the Pembrolizumab 
Monotherapy (RSD-A and RSD-B) Safety Sets (2.8%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, respectively).  In the Indication 
Safety Set, the events were Grade 2 in 4 subjects, Grade 3 in 5 subjects, and Grade 4 in 1 subject 
(1.1%, 1.4%, and 0.3%, respectively); respective incidences for Grade 2, 3 and 4 events in the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-A Safety Set were lower (0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.0%). The incidence of 
pancreatitis leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab was 0.9% in the Indication Safety Set and 0.1% 
in both Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets.  Drug interruption due to the events occurred in 5 
subjects (1.4%) in the Indication Safety Set. 
In the Indication Safety Set, SAEs of pancreatitis (including acute pancreatitis and immune-mediated 
pancreatitis) were reported for 7 (2.0%) subjects.  The majority of subjects reporting pancreatitis SAEs 
had pre-existing hyperlipidemia and elevated triglycerides as well as obesity (BMI over 30). 
Of note, pancreatitis is also a known ADR for lenvatinib.   
Myocarditis 
The incidence of myocarditis was 1.1% in the Indication Safety Set with 4 events:  1 Grade 1 (0.3%), 2 
Grade 3 (0.6%), and 1 Grade 5 (0.3%).  The incidence of Grade ≥3 myocarditis was lower for  
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy (0.1% in RSD-B). 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Overall, the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 hematology laboratory results in the Indication Safety Set was 
low (≤5%), similar to that in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set and higher in the sunitinib arm. 
Grade 3 events of INR increased were reported in 3% of subjects (compared to 0.8% in the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set and 1.3% in the sunitinib arm).

Urinalysis - Proteinuria 
Proteinuria is a CSE for lenvatinib, incidences were similar between the Lenvatinib Safety Sets but lower 
in the sunitinib arm. In the Integrated Safety Set, the majority of proteinuria TEAEs (29.5%) were 
effectively managed with dose interruptions (7.7%) or reductions (10.2%); few subjects (n=6, 1.7%) 
had proteinuria events leading to discontinuation of lenvatinib treatment.

Table 51 Proteinuria events excerpt from Overview of CSAEs for Lenvatinib  
Safety in special populations 
Safety by age and sex, baseline renal function and baseline hypertension status are presented below. 
With regard to race or geographic region (Western Europe and North America vs Rest of World), no 
meaningful and consistent differences among subgroups were observed for the AE profile of lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab (data not copied). Safety by baseline hepatic function and body weight (<60 kg and 
≥60 kg) are not meaningful due to numerical imbalances in subgroups. 
Age 
In the Indication Safety Set, the median duration of treatment with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
decreased with age:  18.33 months in the <65 years subgroup, 16.64 months in the ≥65 to <75 
subgroup, and 14.09 months in the ≥75 years subgroup.  Median dose intensity and received dose as a 
percentage of planned starting dose also declined with age. A similar, but less pronounced pattern was 
also observed in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set.  
The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs and Grade ≥3 related TEAEs was higher in the older age subgroups 
than in the <65 years age subgroup in the Indication Safety Set. Increases were also partly observed in 
the other Safety Sets, however less consistent (see Table 52).  In the Indication Safety Set, there was 
also an increase in SAEs and fatal SAEs with higher age, which was not observed or less pronounced in 
the Monotherapy Safety Sets.  
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 121/149 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistent with the duration of treatment, the incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of any study 
drug was higher in the older aged subgroups than in the <65 years age subgroup for the Indication 
Safety Set. A trend towards numerically higher discontinuations rates for elderly was evident in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set and the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets as well.  The rates 
of discontinuations of both drugs in the Indication Safety Set were similar to the rate of  discontinuation 
in the sunitinib arm. 
Data for subjects with an age of ≥75 years are considered less reliable given the limited numbers in the 
Indication Safety Set (n=45) and the sunitinib arm (n=25).

and 31 events (21 subjects) in the Pembro Monotx RSD-B with missing causality were considered ‘related’ to study drug. 
c:  For combination of Lenv 20 mg + Pembro, the SAE follow-up window was 90 days after the last dose for Studies 111 and 115, and 
120 days after the last dose date for Study 307.  For Lenv Monotx and Pembro Monotx (RSD-A and RSD-B), the window was 30 days 
and 90 days after the last dose, respectively. d:  Lenv or Pembro (or sunitinib). e:  Regardless of the action taken for Pembro. f:  
Regardless of the action taken for Lenv. g:  Due to the same AE. h:  Dose modification includes dose reduction or drug interruption. 
In the Indication Safety Set, events in the most common lenvatinib CSE groups were generally reported 
at a similar incidence in each of the age subgroups with the following exceptions: 
• 
Proteinuria was reported at a higher frequency in the ≥75 years subgroup (37.8%) than in the 
<65 years (26.4%) and ≥65 to <75 years (31.6%) subgroups.  This subgroup difference was also 
observed in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set and Non RCC Safety Set.

• 
Renal events were reported at a higher frequency in the subjects ≥65 years (≥75 years subgroup 
[24.4%] and ≥65 to <75 years subgroup [29.8%]) than in the <65 years age subgroup (17.1%).  
This subgroup difference was also observed in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set and Non 
RCC Safety Set. 
No other meaningful age specific differences were noted.

Sex 
In the Indication Safety Set, the majority of the subjects were male (71.6%). In the sunitinib arm, the 
incidences of all and related Grade ≥3 related TEAEs, and fatal and nonfatal SAEs were higher in the 
female subgroup than in the male subgroup. Discontinuations of sunitinib were similar between sexes but 
dose modifications (dose reductions and interruptions) were higher for females. For all and related Grade 
≥3 TEAEs, and nonfatal SAEs, a small trend towards higher incidences in females was also observed in 
the Indication Safety Set.

a:  Adverse events were graded using CTCAE version 4.03. b:  Treatment-related TEAEs include TEAEs that were considered by the 
Investigator to be related, or possibly/probably related to the study drug or TEAEs with a missing causality on the case report form.  A 
total of 19 events (12 subjects) in the Pembro Monotx RSD-A and 31 events (21 subjects) in the Pembro Monotx RSD-B with missing 
causality were considered ‘related’ to study drug. c:  For combination of Lenv 20 mg + Pembro, the SAE follow-up window was 90 days 
after the last dose for Studies 111 and 115, and 120 days after the last dose date for Study 307.  For Lenv Monotx and Pembro Monotx 
(RSD-A and RSD-B), the window was 30 days and 90 days after the last dose, respectively. d:  Lenv or Pembro (or sunitinib). e:  
Regardless of the action taken for Pembro. f:  Regardless of the action taken for Lenv. g:  Due to the same AE. h:  Dose modification 
includes dose reduction or drug interruption. 
Baseline renal function  
In the Indication Safety Set, the majority of the subjects had a Baseline CrCl ≥60 mL/min (65.1%). 
In the Indication Safety Set, the median duration of treatment with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab was 
higher in the CrCl ≥60 mL/min subgroup than in the CrCl <60 mL/min subgroup (20.04 months and 
11.86 months, respectively).   
The incidences of Grade ≥3 TEAEs, Grade ≥3 related TEAEs, fatal SAEs, nonfatal SAEs and 
discontinuations were higher in the CrCl <60 mL/min subgroup than in the CrCl ≥60 mL/min subgroup for 
the Indication Safety Set; however this was similarly observed in the sunitinib arm (see Table 55). 
In the Indication Safety Set, with the exception of renal events (reported at a higher frequency in the 
CrCl <60 mL/min subgroup [31.1%] than in the CrCl ≥60 mL/min subgroup [17.5%]), events in the most 
common lenvatinib CSE groups were reported at a similar incidence in each of the renal function 
subgroups.  No other meaningful renal function-specific differences were noted.

Baseline hypertension status 
In the Indication Safety Set, the majority of the subjects had hypertension at Baseline (57.4%). 
The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs and Grade ≥3 related TEAEs were slightly higher in the subgroup with 
hypertension than in the subgroup without hypertension for the Indication Safety Set (similar trend also 
seen in the sunitinib arm and the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set) (see Table 56). The incidence of 
fatal SAEs and non-fatal SAEs was similar between the hypertension subgroups. 
The subjects with hypertension at Baseline in the Indication Safety Set had a higher incidence of TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation of lenvatinib than did the subjects without Baseline hypertension.  This 
difference was not observed in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set or in the Non-RCC Safety Set. 
Proteinuria was reported more frequently in subjects with Baseline hypertension (33.2%) than those 
without (24.7%).  This difference was also observed in the Non-RCC Safety Set, but not in the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set.  No other notable subgroup differences were identified in the Indication Safety 
Set.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interactions are expected between pembrolizumab and lenvatinib because of different metabolic 
pathways. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is primarily catabolized like other proteins, while 
lenvatinib is metabolized by enzymatic (cytochrome P450 3A and aldehyde oxidase) and nonenzymatic 
processes. Therefore, no dedicated DDI studies have been performed.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations 
The types of TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm 
were consistent with previous experience with each individual study drug. The median time to 
discontinuation in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm was almost double at 8.97 months than that in 
the sunitinib arm (4.57 months). The number of subjects who discontinued all study drugs due to TEAEs 
was comparable in both arms (13.4% and 14.4% in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib 
arms, respectively).

In the Indication Safety Set, 13.4% of subjects had TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation of both 
lenvatinib and pembrolizumab, which was similar to that in the All RCC Safety Set (12.9%) and lower 
than that in the Non-RCC Safety Set (23.7%). 
The TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug in more than 1 subject were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
acute kidney injury (2 subjects; 1 Grade 4 and 1 Grade 3 TEAE, both related to study drug),  
pneumonitis (2 subjects; 1 Grade 4 and 1 Grade 3 TEAE, both related to study drug),  
proteinuria (2 subjects; 1 Grade 3 and 1 Grade 2 TEAE, both related to study drug), and  
rash (2 subjects; both Grade 3 and related to study drug).   
All other TEAEs that led to discontinuation of both study drugs in the Indication Safety Set were reported 
for 1 subject each.

The incidence of TEAEs that led to discontinuation of lenvatinib, regardless of the action taken with 
pembrolizumab, was similar in the Indication Safety Set (25.6%) and in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy 
Safety Set (26.7%).  In the Indication Safety Set, for following SOCs incidences ≥2% were reported:  
cardiac disorders (4.5%), renal and urinary disorders (3.4%), nervous system disorders (2.8%), skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (2.8%), and gastrointestinal disorders (2.3%). The TEAEs that most 
commonly (≥0.9% of subjects) led to discontinuation of lenvatinib were proteinuria (1.7%), rash 
(including rash maculo-papular and rash papular) (1.5%), diarrhea (1.4%), myocardial infarction (1.1%), 
acute myocardial infarction (1.1%), and  acute kidney injury (0.9%).  
Incidences of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation of pembrolizumab, regardless of the action 
taken with lenvatinib, were 28.7% in the Indication Safety Set and higher than that in the Pembrolizumab 
Monotherapy Safety Sets (RSD-A:  11.9%; RSD-B:  13.4%).  In the Indication Safety Set, for following 
SOCs incidences ≥2% were reported:  investigations (4.3%); gastrointestinal disorders (3.4%); 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3.4%); skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (3.4%); 
and renal and urinary disorders (2.8%). The TEAEs that most frequently (>1% of subjects) led to 
discontinuation of pembrolizumab were pneumonitis (2.8%), rash (including rash maculo-papular and 
papular) (2.3%), diarrhea (1.1%), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (1.1%). 
The number of subjects who discontinued lenvatinib or pembrolizumab due to TEAEs was 37.2% in the 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm. For following SOCs incidences ≥2% were reported: cardiac disorders 
(5.1% [n=18; including 9 myocardial infarction, 2 acute coronary syndrome and 2 myocarditis]), 
gastrointestinal disorders (4.8%), investigations (4.8%), renal and urinary disorders (4.8%), skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (4.3%), and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3.7%).

AEs Resulting in Dose Modification (Reduction or Interruption) of Lenvatinib 
A dose reduction guideline for lenvatinib was specified for management of treatment-related toxicity in 
the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination studies and in the studies that comprised the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set. In the Indication Safety Set, 84.7% of subjects had TEAEs leading to a 
lenvatinib dose modification (dose interruption or reduction), 73.0% had TEAEs leading to a dose 
interruption, and 68.8% had TEAEs leading to a dose reduction. 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to a dose reduction of lenvatinib was higher in the Indication Safety Set 
(68.8%) than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (47.5%) [and higher than in the sunitinib arm 
50.3%]. The TEAEs that most frequently led to a lenvatinib dose reduction (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) 
were diarrhea (15.9%), hypertension (11.6%), proteinuria (10.2%), PPES (8.8%), decreased appetite 
(7.7%), and nausea (5.1%). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to a dose interruption of lenvatinib was similar in the Indication (73.0%) 
and Lenvatinib Monotherapy (67.6%) Safety Sets [and higher than in the sunitinib arm 53.8%]. The 
TEAEs that most frequently led to a lenvatinib dose interruption (occurring in ≥5% of subjects) were 
diarrhea (17.6%), hypertension (8.2%), proteinuria (7.7%), asthenia (6.3%), increased lipase (5.4%), 
and fatigue (5.1%).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary safety data in support of the new indication of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for the first-
line treatment of patients with advanced RCC derive from the open-label, phase 3 Study 307 (KEYNOTE-
581). As of the data cutoff date of 28 Aug 2020, 352 subjects were enrolled in Arm B to receive a starting 
dose of 200 mg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks and 20 mg lenvatinib once daily (QD) (Indication Safety 
Set) and 340 subjects were enrolled in Arm B to receive sunitib 50 mg QD (Sunitinib Safety Set).  
In the All RCC Safety Set (N=497), lenvatinib + pembrolizumab safety data were pooled from Study 307 
and Study 111 from patients with advanced RCC, regardless of prior anticancer therapy. The Non-RCC 
Safety Set describes lenvatinib + pembrolizumab safety data from 215 subjects in non-RCC cohorts from 
Study 111 and 115. 
To enable a relative characterization of the combination safety profile, further safety data are presented 
for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab as monotherapy. The Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set comprised 
1119 subjects with a lenvatinib starting dose level of 24 mg QD from 11 Studies. The largest 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Set (RSD-B) included 5884 subjects from studies of melanoma, 
NSCLC, cHL, urothelial cancer, and HNSCC in EU-approved indications. 
At the time of data cutoff, the median duration of treatment with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in the 
Indication Safety Set was 17.00 months which was comparable to the All RCC Safety Set (15.4 months) 
and longer than the median treatment duration with sunitinib (7.84 months). The median treatment 
duration with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in the Indication Safety Set was 3 times longer than with 
each of the monotherapies: 5.55 months for lenvatinib and 4.86 months for pembrolizumab (in RSD-B).  
A dose reduction guideline for lenvatinib was specified for management of treatment-related toxicity in 
the lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination studies and in the studies that comprised the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set. In the Indication Safety Set, the median percentage of the planned dose of 
lenvatinib received was 69.65% and the median dose intensity was 13.93 mg per day. In the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set, where subjects received a higher starting dose of lenvatinib (24 mg), the 
median percentage of planned dose and the median dose intensity were higher (83.61% and 20.07 mg 
per day, respectively). This was in line with a higher incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events 
(TEAEs) leading to a dose reduction of lenvatinib in the Indication Safety Set (68.8%) than in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (47.5%). 
The analysis of a summary of adverse events revealed an unfavourable toxicity profile for lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab compared to sunitinib, based on between-treatment arm differences in terms of 
Grade ≥3 and related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (82.4% vs 71.8% and 71.6% vs. 58.8%), non-fatal SAEs (50.0% 
vs 32.6%), and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of either lenvatinib or pembrolizumab (37.2% vs 
14.4%).  The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of all study drugs was similar in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms (13.4% vs 14.4% of subjects). TEAEs leading to dose reduction of 
lenvatinib and dose interruption of either study drug in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm occurred 
more frequently than dose reductions or interruptions in the sunitib arm (68.8% vs. 50.3% and 78.4% 
vs. 53.8%, respectively). Adjusted by drug exposure, the rates of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was comparable at 
1.95 and 2.06 per SY but remained numerically higher for SAEs (0.72 vs 0.55 per SY) in the lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms, respectively. 
The incidences of most TEAEs categories were similar between the Indication Safety Set and the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, including any TEAEs (99.7% and 99.0%, respectively), treatment-
related TEAEs (96.9% and 94.7%), Grade ≥3 TEAEs (82.4% and 80.3%), nonfatal SAEs (50.0% and 
51.8%), and fatal AEs (4.3% and 8.7%). The rate of related Grade  ≥3 TEAEs was numerically higher in 
the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (71.6% and 64.7%), 
mainly driven by Grade 4 events (11.6% and 4.7%). Adjusted by drug exposure, incidences for all TEAEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 137/149 
 
 
 
 
categories were numerically lower in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy 
Safety Set.     
The comparison of the Indication Safety Set with pembrolizumab monotherapy demonstrated 
considerably lower incidences for pembrolizumab monotherapy across all TEAEs categories. 
Nearly all subjects in both the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms had at least 1 TEAE 
(99.7% vs 89.5%) and related TEAE (96.9% vs 92.1%). In the Indication Safety Set, the most common 
AEs (occurring in >30% of subjects) were diarrhea (61.4%), hypertension (55.4%), hypothyroidism 
(47.2%), decreased appetite (40.3%), fatigue (40.1%), nausea (35.8%), and stomatitis (34.7%). 
Most  commonly  reported AEs  for  KN-581  lenvatinib+pembrolizumab  treatment  were  consistent  with  the 
safety pattern found in the non-RCC lenvatinib+pembrolizumab SD, and mirrored the well-known safety 
profile  of  lenvatinib  and  pembrolizumab  monotherapies,  showing  however  higher  proportions  for  most 
frequently reported most common AEs, as compared with single-drug therapies. The ADR table in section 
4.8 of the SmPC combines in a new single column the ADRs from pembrolizumab+lenvatinib (KEYNOTE-
581,  KEYNOTE-146,  KEYNOTE-775)  and  pembrolizumab+axitinib  (KEYNOTE-426).  Identification  of  ADRs 
for pembrolizumab when given in combination with lenvatinib or axitinib for treatment of EC and RCC is 
based on frequency of harmful events found in a pooled dataset of several active-controlled trials (KN-581, 
KN-775, KN-426) and a single-arm cohort (KN-146). Further, it takes advantage of the well-established 
safety profiles of pembrolizumab, lenvatinib and axitinib when given as monotherapies.   
For sunitinib, the most commonly reported TEAEs (>30%) were diarrhea (49.4%), hypertension (41.5%), 
stomatitis (38.5%), PPE (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia) syndrome (37.4%), fatigue (36.8%), 
nausea (33.2%), and decreased appetite (30.9%). 
The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs in the Indication Safety Set were generally consistent with that 
in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy or Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Set (RSD-B), with the exceptions of 
diarrhea (54.5%, 45.4%, and 10.7%), hypothyroidism (42.6%, 11.1%, and 9.6%), increased amylase 
(15.1%, 0.9%, and 0.2%) and increased lipase (14.2%, 2.8%, and 0.3%, respectively). 
The majority of patients experienced Grade ≥3 AEs (82.4% vs 71.8% in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab and sunitinib arm, respectively). The most common Grade 3 TEAEs (≥5% of subjects in 
either arm) in lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and sunitinib arms, respectively, were: hypertension 
(27.6% vs 18.8%), diarrhea (9.7% vs 5.0%), weight decreased (8.0% vs 0.3%), proteinuria (7.7% vs 
2.9%), amylase increased (7.4% vs 2.1%), lipase increased (7.1% vs 6.2%), and asthenia (5.4% vs 
4.4%). Grade 4 TEAEs occurred in 14.8% of subjects in the combination arm and 9.4% of subjects in the 
sunitinib arm. The only Grade 4 TEAEs that occurred in 1% or more of subjects in the combination or 
sunitinib arms, respectively, were lipase increased (5.7% vs 2.6%) and amylase increased (1.7% vs 
0.9%). 
The incidence and type of Grade 3 and Grade 4 TEAEs observed in the Indication Safety Set were 
generally consistent with one or more monotherapy safety sets except for the following TEAEs:  increased 
lipase and increased amylase, QT prolongation, pancreatitis, increased ALT and increased AST, adrenal 
insufficiency, acute myocardial infarction and myocardial infarction, rash, and renal failure. 
Nonfatal SAEs were reported in 50.0% and 32.6% of subjects in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab and 
sunitinib arms, respectively. SAEs that occurred at a higher incidence in subjects in the lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab arm compared with the sunitinib arm, respectively, were: diarrhea (3.4% vs 1.2%), 
pneumonitis (2.6% vs 0%), vomiting (2.8% vs 0.9%), acute kidney injury (2.3% vs 1.2%), hypertension 
(2.3% vs 0.6%), adrenal insufficiency (2.0% vs 0%), myocardial infarction (1.7% vs 0.3%), acute

myocardial infarction (1.4% vs 0%), immune-mediated hepatitis and lipase increased (1.1% vs 0% for 
both), renal failure (1.1% vs 0.6%), and pancreatitis (1.7% vs 0%).  
Diarrhea was the only SAE that occurred at a >2% higher incidence in the Indication Safety Set 
compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy and Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets (3.4% vs 1.2% 
and 1.0%); however, numerically higher incidences of nonfatal SAEs in the Indication Safety Set  
compared to the Monotherapy Safety Sets were reported also for numerous other PTs. 
The incidence of fatal AEs, excluding ‘malignant neoplasm progression’, was 4.3% in the Indication 
Safety Set, 3.2% in the sunitinib arm, 8.7% in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set, and 5.3% in the 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-B Safety Sets, indicating that there is no increased risk of fatal AEs 
with combination therapy.  
AEs Leading to Treatment Discontinuation or Dose Modification: 13.4% of subjects discontinued 
both study drugs due to TEAEs in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arms.  The TEAEs that led to 
discontinuation of both study drugs in more than 1 subject were acute kidney injury, pneumonitis, 
proteinuria, and rash. 37.2% of subjects discontinued either lenvatinib or pembrolizumab due to TEAEs. 
5.1% of patients discontinued study drug due to cardiac disorders including 9 patients with myocardial 
infarction (including also acute myocardial infarction), 2 patients with acute coronary syndrome and 2 
patients with myocarditis. TEAEs that most commonly (≥1% of subjects) led to discontinuation of study 
drugs in the Indication Safety Set were pneumonitis (2.8%), rash (including rash maculo-papular and 
papular) (2.6%), (acute) myocardial infarction (2.6%), diarrhoea (2.3%), proteinuria (1.7%), acute 
kidney injury (1.1%), renal failure (1.1%), and ALT increased (1.1%). 
Treatment discontinuation rates for lenvatinib due to TEAEs were similar for both the Indication (25.6%) 
and Lenvatinib Monotherapy (26.7%) Safety Sets and were substantially lower than the rates for dose 
reductions (68.8% and 47.5%) and interruptions (73.0% and 67.6%). These findings indicate that the 
majority of TEAEs can be managed with lenvatinib dose modifications rather than with lenvatinib 
discontinuation. Most common TEAEs leading to dose modification (reduction or interruption) of lenvatinib 
in ≥10% of subjects in the Indication Safety Set were diarrhoea (25.6%), hypertension (15.9%), 
proteinuria (12.5%), decreased appetite (11.6%), and PPES (10.5%). Incidences of TEAEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation of pembrolizumab, regardless of the action taken with lenvatinib, were 28.7% 
in the Indication Safety Set and higher than that in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets (RSD-B: 
13.4%).  Per protocol, dose reductions of pembrolizumab were not permitted. Dose interruptions were 
also higher in the Indication Safety Set (55.1%) than in the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Safety Sets 
(25.4% for RSD-B). Most common TEAEs leading to dose interruption of pembrolizumab in ≥5% of 
subjects in the Indication Safety Set were diarrhoea (10.2%) and lipase increased (5.1%).  
 (AEOSI) are defined categories to assess the frequency of immune-mediated events and infusion-related 
reactions considered by the MAH to be causally related to pembrolizumab. The overall incidence of AEOSI 
was  higher  in  the  Indication  Safety  Set  (60.8%)  than  in  the  Pembrolizumab  Monotherapy  Safety  Sets) 
(25.1% for RSD-B). The majority of AEOSI events were Grade 1 and 2; however higher incidences of AEOSI 
in the Indication Safety Set were also observed for Grade ≥3 (14.8% vs 6.5%), serious AEOSI (12.5% vs 
6.5%) and AEOSI leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab (10.2% vs 3.9% for the Indication Safety 
Set vs the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy RSD-B Safety Set, respectively). The higher incidence of all-grade 
AEOSI in the Indication Safety Set  was primarily driven by hypothyroidism (47.2% vs 11.1%).   Further 
AEOSI  with  an  increased  incidence  in  the  Indication  Safety  Set  compared  to  the  Pembrolizumab 
Monotherapy  were  hyperthyroidism  (8.0%  vs  4.2%),  adrenal  insufficiency  (5.1%  vs  0.8%),  severe  skin 
reactions (5.1% vs 1.6%), and pancreatitis (2.8% vs 0.3%).

Clinically  significant  events  (CSE)  defined  for  lenvatinib  are  arterial  thromboembolic  events,  cardiac 
dysfunction,  hypothyroidism,  gastrointestinal  perforation,  fistula  formation,  hemorrhage,  hepatotoxicity, 
hypertension,  hypocalcemia,  palmar-plantar  erythrodysesthesia  syndrome  (PPES),  posterior  reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), proteinuria, QT prolongation, and renal events. The overall incidence of 
CSEs of all grades, serious CSEs, and CSEs leading to study drug discontinuation were generally similar in 
the Indication and Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Sets. CSE leading to dose reductions were higher in the 
Indication Safety Set than in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Sets (33.0% vs. 23.7%). 
The incidences of the CSE of hypothyroidism, hepatotoxicity, and renal events were higher in the Indication 
Safety  Set  (56.8%,  27.3%,  and  22.2%,  respectively)  than  in  the  Lenvatinib  Monotherapy  Safety  Set 
(19.8%, 17.5%, and 10.0%).  Hypothyroidism, hepatotoxicity, and renal events were primarily low grade 
(Grade ≥3 TEAEs 1.4%, 9.9% and 5.7%) and remained generally manageable with standard medical care 
and study drug dose modification. Hypothyroidism is a known adverse drug reaction for both lenvatinib and 
pembrolizumab. The higher incidence hepatotoxicity with the combination was due to increases in the PTs 
of  AST  and  ALT  ,  which  were  primarily  low-grade  and  asymptomatic,  and  the  higher  incidence  with  the 
combination of renal events was associated with a high rate of baseline renal disease in this RCC population.  
The incidences of the CSE of cardiac dysfunction, arterial thrombotic events, and QT prolongation in the 
Indication Safety Set were similar to that in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set; Of note, a clinically 
meaningful difference was noted in the incidence for the PTs of acute myocardial infarction and myocardial 
infarction (3.4% in the Indication Safety Set vs 1.3% in the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set); however, 
myocardial  infarction  is  a  known  ADR  for  lenvatinib  and  the  increase  was  also  associated  with  a  higher 
cardiovascular risk in the RCC population. 
In terms of laboratory findings, for hematology and urinalysis parameters, the overall pattern of shifts 
from baseline in grade was similar in the Indication and Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Sets. In the 
Indication Monotherapy Safety Set, the most common laboratory abnormality (≥10%) with a shift from 
baseline to Grade 3 or 4 events were reported for lipase increased (33.8% of subjects), amylase 
increased (17.1%), triglycerides increased (14.6%) and sodium decreased (11.7%).  
Safety profile by subgroups 
Age: In the Indication Safety Set, an age-dependent increase in toxicity can be observed which was 
overall more pronounced than in the other Safety Sets higher incidences in the older age subgroups than 
in the <65 years age subgroup were reported for Grade ≥3 TEAEs (all and related), SAEs, fatal SAEs and 
TEAEs leading to discontinuations. In the ≥65 to <75 years age group 43.0% of subjects and more than 
half of the patients (55.6%) in the ≥75 years age group discontinued either lenvatinib or pembrolizumab, 
compared to 29.5% in the younger age group <65 years. Differences by age were especially notable for 
clinically significant events of proteinuria and renal events. Data for subjects with an age of ≥75 years are 
limited due to the small patient numbers in the Indication Safety Set (n=45).  
Baseline renal function: In the Indication Safety Set, the majority of the subjects had a Baseline CrCl 
≥60 mL/min (65.1%). An unfavourable safety profile were observed in the CrCl <60 mL/min subgroup 
compared to the CrCl ≥60 mL/min subgroup regarding Grade ≥3 TEAEs, Grade ≥3 related TEAEs, fatal 
SAEs, nonfatal SAEs and discontinuations;  however this was similarly observed in the sunitinib arm. 
Baseline hypertension status: The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs (all and related) and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of lenvatinib were slightly higher in the subgroup with hypertension (= 57.4% of subjects 
in the Indication Safety Set) than in the subgroup without hypertension for the Indication Safety Set. 
Proteinuria was reported with the largest difference (33.2% in subjects with baseline hypertension vs 
24.7% for subjects without).   
Gender: In the Indication Safety Set, the majority of the subjects were male (71.6%). Small numerical 
trends towards higher incidences in females than in males were observed for Grade ≥3 TEAEs (all and 
Assessment report

related), nonfatal SAEs and dose interruptions of either drug. In comparison, larger gender differences 
were reported in the sunitinib arm. 
With regard to race or geographic region (Western Europe and North America vs Rest of World), no 
meaningful and consistent differences among subgroups were observed for the AE profile of lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in patients with renal cancer is 
overall unfavourable compared with sunitinib; however, the pattern of observed AEs is generally 
consistent with what would be expected from the addition of the two individual drugs with different, but 
partly also overlapping toxicity profiles. No new safety signals were identified. The tolerability of the 
combined regimen appears worse with increasing age.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to extend 
the indication in order to include in combination with lenvatinib first line treatment of adults with advanced 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The Applicant justified that the amendments to the SmPC, which will be reflected in the package leaflet 
are limited in this submission. The changes will affect the following presentations “Keytruda 50 mg 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion” and “Keytruda 25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for 
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021

infusion”, and will cover a new indication: new combination for pembrolizumab with lenvatinib for first line 
treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  
The applicant claimed that the combination treatment in section 1 of the package leaflet already exists for 
the pembrolizumab/axitinib combination and that just changes in section 4 are foreseen related to the 
inclusion of side effects for the new combination pembrolizumab/lenvatinib.     
Due to the minor changes of the content, the key safety messages are not affected and the design and 
layout seems not to be changed remarkable. 
Therefore, the justification is acceptable to carry out neither a full or an abridged user testing. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Keytruda (pembrolizumab) has been removed 
from the additional monitoring list with the renewal procedure five years after the Union reference date. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication to include first line treatment of advanced or metastatic 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as combination therapy of pembrolizumab together with lenvatinib based on 
the results of the Interim Analysis (IA3) from the pivotal study, KN581. This is an ongoing, Phase 3, 
randomized, open-label, multicenter, global study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab 
in combination with lenvatinib or lenvatinib in combination with everolimus versus sunitinib in previously 
untreated subjects with advanced/metastatic RCC. 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents the sixth most common cancer in men and the eighth most 
common cancer in women, accounting for 3%-4% of all adult malignancies in the US (Siegel et al. CA A 
Cancer J Clin. 2019). In 2020, an estimated 138,611 new cases of kidney cancer were expected to be 
diagnosed in Europe with approximately 54,054 people expected to die from the disease (GLOBOCAN, 
2020). Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, comprising 80-
90% of all kidney tumours (2020 European Association of Urology [EAU] RCC guidelines). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In  the  EU,  the  following  agents  targeting  the  VEGF/VEGFR  signaling  pathway  are  approved  for  the  1L 
treatment  of  advanced  RCC:  sunitinib,  pazopanib,  bevacizumab  +  IFNα,  tivozanib  and  cabozantinib  (in 
patients who are considered to be intermediate and poor risk). 
In addition to agents that target VEGFR and VEGF, other approved agents for advanced RCC include the 
mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus for patients considered to be poor risk (per the MSKCC risk category) in the 
1L setting and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus 
Recently, the combination of nivolumab + ipilimumab was approved in the EU for use in treatment-naïve 
patients with advanced RCC who were considered to be intermediate or poor risk per the IMDC criteria. In 
addition, the combinations of avelumab + axitinib, pembrolizumab + axitinib and nivolumab + cabozantinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/621567/2021 
Page 144/149 
 
 
 
 
have also been approved by EMA for the 1L treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC. 
In spite of recent additions to the (systemic) treatment armamentarium, both (median) progression-free 
survival (PFS) and OS for patients with advanced RCC are still rather limited, especially for patients in the 
intermediate and poor risk groups. There thus remains an unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is based upon the interim analysis 3 of KEYNOTE-581 Study, an ongoing, Phase 3, 
randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, 3 arms, open-label clinical study in first line adult patients 
with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), comparing the combination of pembrolizumab 200mg Q3W + 
lenvatinib 20 mg PO QD or lenvatinib + everolimus with sunitinib 50 mg QD 4 weeks on 2 weeks off. 
The primary objectives of the study was to compare the PFS per RECIST 1.1 by IIR in participants treated 
with pembrolizumab  + lenvatinib  vs sunitinib. OS, ORR, safety and tolerability profile of pembrolizumab 
+ lenvatinib, PFS2 and PFS by investigator assessment, PROs, and PK assessments were secondary 
objectives.  
A total of 1069 subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, of whom 355 were allocated to receive 
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab, 357 subjects were allocated to receive lenvatinib plus everolimus, and 
357 subjects were allocated to receive sunitinib, in the 1L setting. 
The application is based upon the interim analysis 3 (final analysis for PFS, interim analysis for OS). 
Updated result for OS have been provided during the procedure. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A statistically significant benefit in PFS has been observed.  Median PFS assessed by IIR was 23.9 months 
for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared with 9.2 months for sunitinib (HR=0.39, [95% CI:  0.32, 
0.49], nominal P<0.0001);    
A benefit in OS has been observed for pembrolizumab + lenvatinib over sunitinib (HR 0.66 (95% CI:  
0.49, 0.88), P=0.0049); 
Objective response rate based on IIR assessment were observed in 71.0% (95% CI 66.3, 75.7) of the 
patients treated with the combination compared to 36.1% (95% CI 31.2, 41.1) in the control arm.  The 
median DOR in responders was 25.8 months (95% CI:  22.1, 27.9) in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab 
arm and 14.6 months (95% CI:  9.4, 16.7) in the sunitinib arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The OS data are currently immature to allow for the informative analyses in the key subgroups, in 
particular IMDC and MSKCC favourable prognosis subgroupswhile the updated analysis in the overall 
population supports benefit, with HR of 0.72 (0.55, 0.93). 
The lack of monotherapy experimental arms in study KN-581 hampers the assessment of the contribution 
of each component of the combination treatment. Indirect comparisons have been provided for 
monotherapy data (in 2L for lenvatinib monotherapy) and the combination use is supported by 
mechanistic rationale.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
An unfavourable toxicity profile was observed for lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab compared to sunitinib, 
based on between-treatment arm differences in terms of Grade ≥3 TEAEs (82.4% vs 71.8%), non-fatal 
SAEs (50.0% vs 32.6%), and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of either lenvatinib or pembrolizumab 
(37.2% vs 14.4%). The most common TEAEs (≥ 40%) in the Indication Safety Set were diarrhoea 
(61.4%), hypertension (55.4%), hypothyroidism (47.2%), decreased appetite (40.3%), and fatigue 
(40.1%).  
The incidences of most TEAEs categories were similar between the Indication Safety Set and the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set; however numerically higher incidences of related Grade ≥3 TEAEs 
occurred in the Indication Safety Set compared to the Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (71.6% and 
64.7%), mainly driven by Grade 4 events (11.6% and 4.7%). Clinically significant events (CSEs) of 
hypothyroidism, hepatotoxicity and renal events were higher in the Indication Safety Set than in the 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set. 
The comparison of the Indication Safety Set with Pembrolizumab Monotherapy demonstrated considerably 
lower incidences for pembrolizumab monotherapy across all TEAEs categories. Incidences of all-grade 
AEOSIs were 60.8% vs. 25.1%; the higher incidence in the Indication Safety Set was primarily driven by 
hypothyroidism (47.2% vs 11.1%), but increased rates were also observed for hyperthyroidism, adrenal 
insufficiency, severe skin reactions, and pancreatitis. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Higher incidences in the older age subgroups than in the <65 years age subgroup were reported for 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs, SAEs, fatal SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuations. In the ≥65 to <75 years age 
group, 43.0% of subjects and more than half of the patients (55.6%) in the ≥75 years age group 
discontinued either lenvatinib or pembrolizumab, compared to 29.5% in the younger age group <65 
years; however, data for subjects with an age of ≥75 years are limited due to the small patient numbers 
in the Indication Safety Set (n=45). 
More subjects experienced myocardial infarction in the Indication Safety Set than in the Lenvatinib 
Monotherapy Safety Set (3.4% vs. 1.3%, respectively); however these increases were also associated 
with higher cardiovascular risk factors in the RCC population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib demonstrated superiority vs sunitinib in PFS in patients 
with advanced RCC, supported by an advantage in terms of OS and ORR.  
For 1L treatment of subjects with advanced RCC, the overall safety profile of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib 
compares less favourable to sunitinib. In KEYNOTE-581, a higher rate of all adverse event categories 
(particularly grade 3-5 AES, SAEs and drug discontinuations due to TEAEs) was observed for the 
combination of pembrolizumab with lenvatinib. A higher rate of dose adjustments (dose reductions, 
interruptions) and discontinuation due to AEs was observed in the combination arm, also based on 
exposure-adjusted rates. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib demonstrated superiority vs sunitinib in PFS in patients 
with advanced RCC, supported by an advantage in terms of OS and ORR.  
For 1L treatment of subjects with advanced RCC, the overall safety profile of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib 
compares less favourable to sunitinib. In Study 307/KEYNOTE-581, a higher rate of all adverse event 
categories (particularly grade 3-5 AES, SAEs and drug discontinuations due to TEAEs) was observed for 
the combination of pembrolizumab with lenvatinib.  
A higher rate of dose adjustments (dose reductions, interruptions) and discontinuation due to AEs was 
observed in the combination arm, also based on exposure-adjusted rates. 
The benefits of the combination treatment are considered to outweigh the risks in the overall population. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab is positive.  
The MAH is recommended to submit the final OS analysis (including analyses/KM plots from favourable 
prognosis subgroups) from the E7080-G000-307/KEYNOTE 581 study which is comparing the efficacy and 
safety of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib and lenvatinib plus everolimus vs. sunitinib 
monotherapy as a first-Line treatment of patients with advanced RCC.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include Keytruda in combination with lenvatinib first line treatment of adults 
with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 32.1 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

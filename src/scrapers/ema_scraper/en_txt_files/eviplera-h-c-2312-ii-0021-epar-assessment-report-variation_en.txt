Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Gilead Sciences International Ltd 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 9 January 2013 an application for a variation including 
an extension of indication. 
This application concerns the following medicinal product: 
Medicinal product:  International non-proprietary name: 
Presentations: 
Eviplera 
emtricitabine / rilpivirine / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  See Annex A 
The following variation type was requested: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.1.6 a) 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of 
II 
an approved one 
The MAH applied for the extension of the indication for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral 
therapy (ART)-experienced adults who are virologically suppressed with no history of virologic failure 
based on clinical studies GS-US-264-0111 and GS-US-264-0106. Consequently, the MAH proposed the 
update of sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC.  
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity to perform correction of errors in the Package Leaflet (possible side effects section). 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the RMP. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
(P/0176/2012) on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP (EMEA-000774-PIP01-09-MO1) was not yet 
completed as all measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek scientific advice or Protocol assistance at the CHMP.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Product profile 
Eviplera contains the active substances emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg, rilpivirine (RPV) 25 mg, and 
tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) (TDF) 245 mg. In the European Union, Eviplera is indicated for the 
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral treatment-naïve 
adult patients with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (Commission Decision granted on 28 
November 2011).  
During the registration procedure questions were raised about the selection of the dose of RPV, which 
appeared to be motivated not by the most optimal efficacy but by fears of QT prolongation. The 
selected dose was sensitive to disruptions by non-adherence, concomitant use of PPIs and lack of 
concomitant food intake, which lowered plasma concentrations and subsequently antiretroviral activity. 
Also this dose appeared to be not optimal in patients with high baseline viral loads or low baseline CD4 
counts. The latter number was too low to be evaluated properly. However, considering the non-inferior 
efficacy in comparison to comparator regimens in patients with baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 
copies/ml, MA was granted.

The MAH proposed to extend the indication in Section 4.1 of the SmPC to include the use of Eviplera 
“for the treatment of HIV-1 in adult patients with virologic suppression to replace their current 
antiretroviral therapy.” In order to expand this indication efficacy and safety data from 2 switch studies 
in virologically suppressed adult HIV patients were provided: 
•  GS-US-264-0106 (aka MEA009, patients receiving protease inhibitors) and  
•  GS-US-264-0111 (aka MEA010, patients receiving efavirenz).  
During the first two rounds of assessment major objections were formulated relating to: 
• 
The defined target population which was not recognized within the current regulatory thinking and 
the state of the art of the HIV therapeutics as shown in evolving EMA guidelines  
• 
The reason for switch appeared to be tolerability of the previous regimen, suggesting a better 
tolerability with rilpivirine (RPV) which was not demonstrated. On the contrary, more patients 
discontinued upon switch to RPV from PI-based regimens.  
•  Determination of the optimal dose of RPV after switch from EFV (see below). 
In addition, several other concerns were identified during the procedure and the CHMP took also into 
account the data and answers provided to post authorisation measures that were assessed in parallel.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the Committee. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA was initially submitted in this application.  
The Committee requested an ERA in the first RSI arguing that the extension of the indication might 
lead to an increase in use, and therefore environmental exposure of the product. In line with the 
guideline in environmental risk assessment EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, an ERA was considered 
warranted. The MAH was therefore requested to update the ERA for Eviplera, with regard to the 
increase in patient population. 
The applicant submitted an updated ERA and presented recalculated Fpen and PEC values for rilpivirine, 
which the CHMP considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetics data have been submitted in this application.  
However, for the assessment of this variation 2 PAMs for the rilpivirine component are relevant and are 
presented below. 
2.3.2.1.  Optimal RPV dose after switch from EFV 
As part of MEA007 (drug interaction study with efavirenz and 50 mg rilpivirine dose) also a study with 
25 mg rilpivirine after switch from efavirenz in healthy volunteers (TMC278HIV1001) was submitted. 
After examination of the results questions were raised by the CHMP about the prolonged decrease of 
concentrations of RPV when administered as 25 mg qd due to induction of EFV of hepatic enzymes 
(CYP3A4).  
The data submitted initially showed that combined antiviral concentrations of rilpivirine and efavirenz 
were still above the individual EC50 of RPV and EFV.  
Assessment report  
Eviplera 
EMA/CHMP/250768/201 
Page 10/89 
 
 
 
 
However, it remained unclear whether individual concentrations may have been decreased below the 
EC50 of each molecule. Therefore the CHMP requested to provide the concentrations of both EFV and 
RPV in relation to their respective EC50 and EC90.  
As an alternative the MAH sent Figure A to Figure H, where the actual measured plasma concentrations 
of RPV and EFV measured by the LC/MS/MS assays were provided. The concentrations are depicted in 
relation to their respective plasma protein binding-adjusted EC50 and EC90 values1. Figure A to Figure 
F show, for all subjects and at the different time points, the RPV observed pre-dose plasma 
concentration (C0h) after the switch (Treatment C, TC) as compared to the corresponding time point in 
the absence of preceding EFV treatment (Treatment A, TA), and the observed plasma concentrations 
for EFV during Treatment C, with for each time point the last day of EFV intake as a reference (Day 14 
Treatment B, TB D14). Figure G and Figure H show, for all subjects, the evolution of, respectively, the 
RPV and EFV observed plasma concentrations over time during Treatment C (i.e., after switch from 
EFV). In addition, Figure I shows scatterplots of the observed RPV and EFV plasma concentrations on 
the same graph (1 graph per time point). Table 1 shows the median (range) ratios of the RPV or EFV 
plasma concentration divided by the respective EC50 and EC90 value, for the different time points. 
The scatterplots of these ratios, using EC50 and EC90, for RPV and EFV, for each subject on the same 
graph (1 graph per time point) are shown below. With regard to these ratios, it should be noted that 
the meaning of this relationship of in vivo concentrations with the in vitro potency (EC50 and EC90) is 
poorly understood for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Several studies have 
shown that an efficacy margin predictive for virologic outcome cannot always be identified. Plasma 
exposure may also not be directly comparable to the in vitro potency, as additional factors may come 
into play in vivo, such as tissue distribution and intracellular accumulation of drug in infected cells. 
1 The protein binding-adjusted RPV EC50 value is 5.0 ng/mL (obtained by adjusting the RPV EC50 value of 0.27 ng/mL with 
the functional protein binding effect in the presence of human serum which is 18.5-fold). Similarly, the adjusted RPV EC90 
value is 12.2 ng/mL (0.66 ng/mL * 18.5). The protein binding-adjusted EFV EC50 value is 6.8 ng/mL (obtained by 
adjusting the EFV EC50 value of 0.55 ng/mL with the functional protein binding effect in the presence of human serum 
which is 12.3-fold). For EFV EC90, the reported value of 8.9 ng/mL was used.

Table 1. 
Median (range) ratios of the RPV or EFV plasma concentration divided by the respective EC50 
and EC 90 value, for the different timepoints after switch 
According to the MAH, the data in the figures clearly demonstrated that as RPV is building up to 
steady-state after the switch from EFV, plasma concentrations are above the RPV EC50 as of 24 hours 
(17/18 subjects) to Day 4 (16/16) after the start of dosing, and continue to increase further above the 
EC50 thereafter. The values are also above the RPV EC90 for most subjects as of Day 4 (13/16) and 
Day 7 (14/16) and for all subjects as of Day 14 after the switch from EFV. EFV plasma concentrations 
start to decline after cessation of EFV intake, but remain well above the EFV EC50 and the EFV EC90 in 
all but two subjects until at least 7 days after cessation of EFV intake. At this time (Day 7 after switch), 
RPV plasma concentrations are well above the RPV EC90 in these two subjects. In Figure I, the lower 
left quadrant is always empty. There is only 1 subject (S025) with an observed RPV plasma 
concentration below the EC90 on Day 28 after the switch from EFV, which is the outlier. According to 
the RPV plasma concentration data observed for this subject on the days before and after Day 28, 
which are well above the EC50 as of 24 hours after the switch, this low value on Day 28 cannot be 
explained by prolonged cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A induction by EFV. 
2.3.2.2.  RPV exposure and CD4+ cell count  
Baseline viral load >100,000 copies/ml increase the rate of virologic failure in Rilpivirine compared to 
efavirenz. In addition low baseline CD4 counts seemed to influence outcome, but numbers were too 
small to determine a clear relationship. Whether lower CD4 counts also influence RPV exposures (C0h 
and AUC24h) has been determined by the MAH upon request by the CHMP. Since RPV exposure is 
influenced by gastric uptake, i.e. acidity, a possible association between lower CD4 counts and poorer 
gastric acid production was postulated. In this context, it was questioned whether lower CD4+ cell 
counts, potentially associated with gastric hypoacidity, would influence RPV absorption (which is pH 
dependent).  
Estimated RPV exposure as a function of CD4+ cell count  
Using a population pharmacokinetic model, pharmacokinetic parameters (as measures of exposure to 
RPV) were derived from RPV concentrations in sparse plasma samples at pre-defined time points

during treatment. As a result, one value for each pharmacokinetic parameter was derived for each 
subject with pharmacokinetic samples during the treatment period.  
The MAH has explored the correlation between CD4+ cell counts at baseline, at Week 48, and at Week 
96 with pharmacokinetic parameter values. Note that for the figures (Figure 1 and following) with 
CD4+ cell count at Week 48 and Week 96, the observed CD4+ values at these respective time points 
are used, and hence subjects who did not reach either time point are not included in the analysis for 
the concerned time point. 
The MAH also conducted a multivariable analysis (ANCOVA using log10 transformed AUC24h) to 
explore the effect of baseline CD4+ on RPV exposure, while controlling for factors that are known to 
affect RPV exposure (i.e., race, gender, and adherence). The effect of baseline CD4+ cell count 
observed in this analysis was small, not statistically significant and not considered to be clinically 
relevant (for every 10 cell increase in CD4+ cell count, the RPV AUC24h increases 1.0016-fold; 
p=0.13).

The analysis was started from the non-virologic failure (non-VF) censored population in the Week 96 
analysis (i.e., subjects who discontinued for reasons other than virologic failure were excluded).  
In addition, for the virologic failures, only subjects with a primary virologic response (i.e., confirmed 
viral load <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) but subsequent failure at any time during the study (i.e., 
rebounders) were retained, excluding the never suppressed subjects. 
Figure 2 shows rebounders and responders (indicated in the figure as 'not VF') separately. No obvious 
relationship between AUC24h values and CD4+ cell count (at baseline, at Week 48, and at Week 96) 
could be observed, across the non-VF censored population (responders and rebounders) or specifically 
in the rebounders.  
Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of AUC24h values for responders and rebounders by baseline viral load 
categories (i.e., ≤100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL and >100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) and by CD4+ 
cell count categories (i.e., <200 cells/mL and ≥200 cells/mL). In both baseline viral load categories, 
the ranges of exposures observed were similar across the CD4+ cell count categories; this is true for 
the responders, as well as for the rebounders.

Figure 4 presents these data in the adherent group of patients (i.e., >95% [investigator-reported 
compliance]). This latter graph shows that exposure is similar across the different CD4+ cell count 
categories (i.e., <50, ≥50-<200, ≥200-<350, ≥350 cells/mL).  
A multivariable analysis looking at the effect on exposure for the rebounders only, also indicated that 
the baseline CD4+ cell count did not affect RPV exposure (p=0.22).

Patients failing virologically between Week 48 and Week 96  
The analysis was started from the non-VF censored population in the Week 96 analysis. In addition, for 
the virologic failures, only subjects with a primary virologic response but subsequent failure between 
Week 48 and Week 96 (i.e., late rebounders) were retained. 
Figure 5 shows scatter plots of AUC24h by CD4+ cell count at baseline, at Week 48, and at Week 96 for 
late rebounders and responders separately. From this graph it appears that RPV exposure is not 
correlated with CD4+ cell count across the non-VF censored population or specifically in the late 
rebounders.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
RPV dose after switching from EFV 
After the switch from EV, the RPV concentrations are initially low. Due to the decline in EFV plasma 
levels, the inductive effect decreases and RPV concentrations starts to normalize. As a result, and as 
shown by the MAH in figures A – H, at day 4 after switching from EFV to RPV, RPV concentrations are 
all above EC50 and at day 14 all above the EC90. This continues till day 28 (and expected to be 
thereafter). At day 28 one subject had RPV concentrations below EC50; however, this observation is 
considered an outlier, because concentrations for this subject were above EC50 before day 28. 
For EFV, up to day 4, all EFV concentrations were above EC90.  At day 7, 2 subjects had 
concentrations below EC90, and this number increases, as expected over the following weeks.  
The most important observation from these data is that during the time period of declining EFV plasma 
levels and increasing RPV plasma levels, during the 28 day period after switching, none of the subjects 
had EFV neither RPV plasma levels below their respective EC90 levels at the same time.  
In NNRTIs EC90 levels and required therapeutic drug levels used for TDM do not coincide, for example 
therapeutic range of EFV is 1-4 ug/ml that is much higher than the EC90 (figure H). Effectively, only 
the interval from day 2 to day 7 after switch may have sub-therapeutic drug concentrations of the 
combined NNRTIs, since EFV is below the therapeutic range (but still above the EC90) and RPV has not 
even achieved its EC90. A period of less than 7 days which has been accepted even for functional 
monotherapy studies in HIV infected individuals with detectable viral load. In the subjects in this switch 
study, therapeutic drug concentrations of the backbone ARVs (TDF+FTC) in virally suppressed 
individuals will give additional viral suppression. This provides assurance that efficacy is likely not to be 
affected after switching.  
RPV exposure and CD4+ cell count  
The scatter plots provided by the MAH do not indicate a clear relationship between CD4+ counts and 
RPV exposure at baseline, week 48 or week 96 and AUC24h.  
The conclusion therefore is that in all subjects, regardless of CD4 count, low C0h and AUC24h can 
occur. 
The analytical results also indicate that for successfully suppressed patients at week 48 and 96, 
compared to rebounders no apparent relationship between RPV exposures and CD4 count is apparent.  
However, the distribution of data points both of lower values of AUC24 h and of C0h seems to occur 
among all CD4 counts. As a consequence, in rebounders no relationship between CD4 count and RPV 
exposure can be established.  
Similarly, baseline Viral Load or Adherence >95% did not show a clear relationship between the 
different strata baseline CD4 and RPV exposures.  
The CHMP concluded that patients with low CD4 count are not more prone to low exposures, also not 
in patients who fail while on treatment (i.e. rebounders). 
Considering the spread of data points of the 2 subgroups over all values of CD4 counts, no relationship 
can be seen for patients failing virologically between Week 48 and Week 96. 
In late rebounders after week 48 lower RPV exposures could be found in patients with both high and 
low CD4 cell counts, and as such this seems not to make an impact.

2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
RPV dose after switching from EFV 
The MAH submitted the requested data on concentrations of EFV en RPV in relation to the EC50 and 
EC90 values and these data confirm that during all days after switch the EC90 values of either drug are 
reached and that sub-therapeutic drug concentrations will be present during a period of < 1 week 
which is unlikely to influence viral suppression. 
RPV exposure and CD4+ cell count  
CD4 count did not seem to influence RPV exposure (both AUC24h and C0h) in all subjects, in subjects 
with both low CD4 count and low baseline viral load, in subjects with good adherence, in rebounders 
and in late rebounders, and therefore the hypothesis that patients with low CD4 cell count might have 
considerably lower rilpivirine exposure due to gastric hypoacidity is not supported by the available 
data.  
The initial assessment already demonstrated that individuals with low CD4 count experienced higher 
virologic failure rates.  
From these provided data at 3 time points it cannot be derived that lower RPV exposure contributed to 
higher failure rates in this subgroup. 
No outstanding issues remain for the clinical pharmacology regarding the requested extension of the 
indication. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy aspects 
Two new clinical studies in virologically suppressed adult HIV patients have been submitted in this 
application, both to support the extension of the indication. 
•  GS-US-264-0106 (A Phase 3 Randomized, Open-Label Study to Evaluate Switching from

Tablet Regimen (STR) to Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate 
(FTC/RPV/TDF) STR in Virologically Suppressed, HIV 1 Infected Subjects).

Sample Size and Power 
A total of 420 subjects were planned to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups. With 
280 subjects randomized to switch to the FTC/RPV/TDF STR on Day 1 and 140 subjects randomized to 
the SBR group, with a non-inferiority margin of 12%) and > 95% power when the proportion of 
responders in both treatment groups for the primary endpoint was 90% at Week 24 (the 90% estimate 
is based on data from Study GSUS-177-0107). 
Outcomes/Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA  < 50 copies/mL at week 
24, and was analysed using the (US FDA) snapshot algorithm. 
Statistical Methods 
Non-inferiority: it was to be concluded that the FTC/RPV/TDF STR group was not inferior to the SBR 
group if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference (FTC/RPV/TDF STR – SBR) in the 
response rate was greater than −12%. 
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows: 
• 
To evaluate the change from baseline in fasting lipid parameters (total cholesterol, low-density 
lipoprotein [LDL] and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, and triglycerides) over 24 and 
48 weeks 
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of each treatment over 24 and 48 weeks 
To evaluate the change from baseline in CD4+ cell count in each treatment group at 24 and 48 
weeks

(Continued) GS-US-264-0106: Key Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (Safety 
Analysis Set)  
Patients were mostly white males in their 40s, with HIV viral load  <50 copies/ml at screening, but in 
the window phase until treatment initiation 25 subjects had increased viral loads, including 7 with 
loads>400 copies/mL.  
Most patients had been treated for several years; mean 3.3 years, from which at least in the last 
months with a protease inhibitor. However, some patients had been treated only shortly, since a 
minimum of 0.4 year was reported and 4.7% and 4.4% had baseline CD4 < 200 in the FTC/RPV/TDF 
group and SBR group, respectively. 
Current treatment: NRTIs 
The majority of subjects were receiving FTC/TDF (Truvada) at screening (80.4% in the FTC/RPV/TDF 
group and 81.8% in the SBR group). Approximately 13% of subjects in both groups were receiving 
abacavir + lamivudine (Kivexa/Epzicom) at screening. 
Current treatment: Protease inhibitors 
Protease inhibitors taken at screening included the following:  
• 
• 
ritonavir (68.8% in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 62.9% in the SBR group),  
atazanavir (38.5% in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 34.0% in the SBR group),

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
lopinavir + ritonavir (Kaletra; 30.6% in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 36.5% in the SBR group),  
darunavir (19.9% in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 20.8% in the SBR group),  
fosamprenavir (7.9% in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 7.5% in the SBR group),  
saquinavir (1.9% in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 1.3% in the SBR group), 
amprenavir (0.3% in the FTC/RPV/TDF group). 
Adherence 
Self-reported Adherence: A total of 51 of 469 subjects (about 10% in both groups) self-reported 
adherence and it was similar between groups. 
Pill counts were only collected for FTC/RPV/TDF. Based on pill counts mean (SD) adherence was 
identical in the FTC/RPV/TDF and Delayed Switch treatment groups (99% [2.8%]), and similar 
proportions of subjects in both treatment groups were > 95% adherent to the study drug regimen 
(89.9% FTC/RPV/TDF group and 92.8% Delayed Switch group). For the total FTC/RPV/TDF group, 
90.8% were > 95% adherent to the study drug regimen. 
Adherence questionnaire: showed a significant increase in mean adherence from baseline to week 4, to 
week 8 and week 12 in the FTC/RPV/TDF group compared to the SBR group, that were not significantly 
different after week 12. 
Primary outcome  
The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 (snapshot analysis) was similar 
in the FTC/RPV/TDF (93.7%) and SBR (89.9%) treatment groups (3.8% treatment difference; 95% CI: 
−1.6%, 9.1%). The lower bound of the 95% CI was within the predefined 12% margin for non-
inferiority of FTC/RPV/TDF to SBR at Week 24. 
In the Delayed Switch group, 92.1% of subjects had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL after 24 weeks of 
treatment, consistent with the FTC/RPV/TDF group at Week 24. 
The TLOVR analysis results were generally consistent with the snapshot analysis, with 88.3% of those 
in the FTC/RPV/TDF group having HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through 48 weeks (95% CI: 84.3%, 
91.6%). 
One subject (0.3%) in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 8 subjects (5.0%) in the SBR group had HIV-1 RNA 
≥ 50 copies/mL at Week 24 (defined as virologic failure). Two additional subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF 
group were classified as virologic failures; 1 subject discontinued study drug due to lack of efficacy, 
and 1 subject discontinued due to other reasons and their last HIV-1 RNA result was ≥ 50 copies/mL.  
As a consequence, 3 subjects experienced VF in the first 24 weeks in FTC/RPV/TDF versus 8 subjects in 
the SBR arm. 
Also the sensitivity analyses M = F and M = E and the LOCF analyses (both on-treatment and on-study 
analyses) were consistent with primary snapshot analysis.

FTC/RPV/TDF group and the SBR group  in the on-treatment analysis of absolute cell counts. The 
difference between the FTC/RPV/TDF and SBR treatment groups was not statistically significant at 
Week 24 (p = 0.28).

cell counts had decreased from baseline (−11 cells/μL [−65, 46]). 
Virology 
The HIV-1 subtype was determined for 65% of subjects (309 of 475) by the historical genotype. Most 
subjects with an HIV-1 subtype listed had subtype B (275 of 475, 58%). 
Other subtypes present were subtypes AG (12 of 475, 2.5%), AE (4 of 475, 0.8%), C (4 of 475, 
0.8%), A (3 of 475, 0.6%), G (3 of 475, 0.6%) and mixtures or other subtypes (8 of 475, 1.7%). The 
remaining 166 of 475 subjects with historical genotype data available did not have an HIV-1 subtype 
listed in their report. 
Virologic rebound was defined as having 2 consecutive visits with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL. In 
addition, subjects who were on study drugs and had not been analysed previously, and who had HIV-1 
RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at Week 48 or their last visit were also analysed for resistance at their last visit. 
A total of 8 subjects in either group met the criteria for inclusion in the resistance analysis (8 of 476, 
1.7%). Two subjects (2 of 317, 0.6%) were included from the baseline switch to FTC/RPV/TDF group

through Week 24, 7 subjects (7 of 317, 2.2%) were in the FTC/RPV/TDF group through Week 48, and 
1 subject (1 of 159, 0.6%) was in the SBR group through Week 24. 
Resistance 
Resistance development to one or more components of the FTC/RPV/TDF STR or a PI-based regimen 
was infrequent through Week 48 of this study  
- 
- 
- 
- 
0.6% of subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF group through Week 24, 
1.3% of subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF group through Week 48,  
no subjects with delayed switch to FTC/RPV/TDF at Week 24,  
0.6% in the SBR group 
The most common emergent resistance mutations in the FTC/RPV/TDF-treated subjects were M184V/I 
and E138K in RT. 
Of the 469 FTC/RPV/TDF-treated subjects, a total of 7 subjects were analysed for resistance 
development and had postbaseline genotypic and phenotypic data for PR and RT. 
- 
- 
- 
Two subjects who switched to FTC/RPV/TDF at baseline (2 of 317, 0.6%) developed primary 
NRTI or NNRTI resistance mutations and reduced susceptibility to FTC and/or RPV by Week 24,  
2 additional subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF group developed resistance between Weeks 24 and 
48 (total of 4 of 317 from baseline to Week 48, 1.3%),  
no subjects in the delayed switch group (0 of 152, 0%) developed resistance after switching to 
FTC/RPV/TDF at Week 24 through Week 48. 
All 4 subjects with emergent resistance had an M184V/I substitution and 3 of the 4 also had emergent 
resistance mutations to RPV (L100I and K103N with pre-existing V90V/I; E138K; and V108V/I and 
E138K with pre-existing K103N and V179I). 
Subjects who developed genotypic resistance to RPV showed a mean of 9-fold reduced susceptibility to 
RPV compared to wild-type. Subjects who developed phenotypic resistance to RPV also showed 
reduced phenotypic susceptibility to the other NNRTIs delavirdine, EFV, and nevirapine, but remained 
susceptible to etravirine in 1 of 2 cases. 
In the SBR group, 1 subject was included in the resistance analysis population and was analysed for 
resistance development (1/159, 0.6%). This subject developed the K70E/K and M184V mutations and 
reduced susceptibility to FTC while on their PI-based regimen (atazanavir + ritonavir + FTC/TDF) at 
Week 24. After switch to Eviplera at week 24 after initial suppression from 23,400 copies to 181 
copies/ml, the patient discontinued due to lack of efficacy at day 43. 
All subjects remained susceptible to tenofovir.

HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire 
For 12 items of the 20-item HIV Symptom Index, subject-reported symptoms were significantly 
reduced compared to baseline in the FTC/RPV/TDF group at Week 24 (p ≤ 0.031). 
The difference between the FTC/RPV/TDF group and the SBR group at Week 24 in the presence of HIV 
symptoms was statistically significant for  
• 
• 
• 
diarrhoea or loose bowel movements (17.4% FTC/RPV/TDF vs. 45.3% in the SBR group; p < 
0.001);  
bloating, pain, or gas in the stomach (18.6% FTC/RPV/TDF group vs. 32.1% in the SBR group; 
p = 0.001);  
problems having sex (20.8% in the FTC/RPV/TDF vs. 32.7% in the SBR group; p = 0.005). 
After 24 weeks of FTC/RPV/TDF treatment in the Delayed Switch group, subject-reported symptoms 
were significantly reduced compared to baseline for only 2 of the 20 items on the HIV Symptom Index 
(diarrhoea or loose bowel movements and difficulty falling or staying asleep) (p ≤ 0.034).

HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire 
At Week 24, mean (SD) total HIVTSQ change scores (sum of the 10 questionnaire items) were 
significantly higher for the FTC/RPV/TDF group (24 [SD 8.4]) (p < 0.001) than for the SBR group (15 
[12.8]) indicating more subjects were satisfied with their FTC/RPV/TDF than those on their baseline 
regimen. 
GS-US-264-0111: switch to 25 mg Eviplera after EFV/FTC/TDF in HIV-
infected patients 
Methods  
This study was a Phase 2B open-label pilot study to evaluate switching from a regimen consisting of an 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF) single tablet regimen (STR) to 
Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF) STR in 49 virologically-
suppressed, HIV-1 infected subjects. This study evaluated efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of RPV 
after switching from EFV during a period of 48 weeks in subjects that did not tolerate EFV. 
Study design 
Open-label, multicentre (18 centres in the US) study to evaluate switching from EFV/FTC/TDF to 
FTC/RPV/TDF STR in virologically-suppressed HIV-1 infected subjects who had been on EFV/FTC/TDF 
for > 3 months at screening and had decided on a change in regimen due to EFV intolerance. All 
subjects switched from EFV/FTC/TDF to FTC/RPV/TDF STR at baseline. After 48 weeks of treatment 
with FTC/RPV/TDF, all subjects completed a 30-day follow-up visit or telephone call. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of FTC/RPV/TDF STR after switching 
from EFV/FTC/TDF  at baseline in maintaining HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 12 
The primary endpoint was the proportion (%) of subjects who had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 
12 as defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot analysis. 
The secondary objectives with subsequent endpoints of this study were as follows: 
1.  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FTC/RPV/TDF STR over 24 and 48 weeks 
2.  To evaluate the efficacy of FTC/RPV/TDF STR after switching from EFV/FTC/TDF at baseline in 
maintaining HIV-1 RNA , 50 copies/mL at Week 24 and Week 48 
3.  To explore the pharmacokinetics of RPV after switching from EFV 
4.  To determine CD4 counts and changes during 48 weeks 
Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects who met all of the following criteria were eligible for participation in the study:

PK data 
Blood samples for trough pharmacokinetic analyses were obtained pre-dose at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 
24, and 48. A single post-dose blood sample was collected from each subject at Week 36 (any time 
post-dose). 
Rilpivirine and efavirenz concentrations were measured by validated LC-MS/MS methods. 
Results  
The study started on 27 January 2011, first subject screened, and the last observation took place at 19 
April 2012. 
Subjects 
63 subjects were screened, 50 were enrolled at 18 sites in the US. One subject withdrew consent 
before the start of FTC/RPV/TDF dosing. 
Table 8.  GS-US-264-0111: Disposition of Subjects (Enrolled Subjects) 
A total of 48 subjects completed both the protocol-defined period of study drug dosing and the whole 
study. One subject did not complete study drug dosing or the study because of a protocol violation 
(low adherence; stopped taking study medication due to incarceration, his last Viral Load was < 50 
copies/ml). 
Baseline data 
The majority of subjects in the safety analysis set were male (91.8%), with an overall mean age of 38 
years (range, 24 to 57 years); most were white (81.6%). 
At baseline, mean CD4+ cell count was 656/uL (range, 188 to 1528/uL). The mean time since first 
taking ARV medication (EFV/FTC/TDF) was 2.7 years (range, 0.5 to 7.5 years).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
All 49 subjects (100%) maintained an HIV-1 RNA viral load of < 50 copies/mL at the Week 12 visit 
(FDA snapshot analysis). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Week 24: Virologic suppression was maintained in all 49 subjects (100%)

Week 48: 93.9% of subjects (46 of 49 subjects; 95% CI: 83.1%, 98.7%) had HIV-1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL and were defined as virologic successes according to the snapshot analysis.  
Virologic failures 
Two subjects had HIV-1 RNA >  50 copies/mL at Week 48 and were considered virologic failures: 
•  1 subject had low-level viral loads of 63 copies/mL (Day 245 [Week 36]) and 95 copies/mL 
(Day 335 [Week 48]). After switching the subject back to prestudy EFV/FTC/TDF by the 
investigator on Day 336, viral load became undetectable (ie, < 50 copies/mL) by Day 356.  
•  Another subject had viral loads of 330,000 (Week 48), 1890 (Week 51), and 991 copies/mL 
(Week 54). This subject was noted to have poor study-drug adherence prior to Week 48, 
lacked a detectable RPV trough level at Week 48, and had HIV-1 with no resistance to study 
drugs at Weeks 48 and 51. 
Table 10.  GS-US-264-0111: Treatment Outcomes at Week 48 for HIV-1 RNA at a Cut off of  50 
copies/mL (Snapshot Analysis; Full Analysis Set) 
Other analyses confirmed the results of the snapshot analysis for virologic success: TLOVR 93.9%, 
M=F analysis 93.9%, M=E analysis 95.8%, LOCF analysis 100% at week 12 and 95.9% at week 48. 
CD4 count 
Median (Q1, Q3) baseline CD4+ cell counts were 653 (513, 766) cells/mL. Median (Q1, Q3) change 
from baseline in CD4+ cell counts were not statistically significant at Week 48 (-2 [–76, 104] cells/uL; 
p = 0.87, Wilcoxon signed rank test). 
Virology 
Baseline virologic data 
No subject had evidence of protocol-defined exclusion mutations in their historical genotype. In total, 7 
subjects had a documented NNRTI resistance mutation (14.3%, 7/49 subjects), 3 subjects had an 
NRTI resistance mutation (6.1%, 3/49 subjects), and 2 subjects had a primary protease inhibitor 
resistance mutation (4.1%, 2/49 subjects). One subject had the RPV resistance-associated mutation

E138A, which was not an exclusion mutation at the time of this study; this subject maintained virologic 
suppression through Week 48. 
Genotype 
The HIV-1 subtype was determined for 67% of subjects (33/49) by the historical genotype. 
All subjects with an HIV-1 subtype listed had subtype B (67%, 33/49 subjects). The remaining 16 
subjects did not have an HIV-1 subtype listed in their report. 
Resistance 
Virologic rebound was defined as having 2 postbaseline visits with HIV-1 RNA > 400 copies/mL, having 
HIV-1 RNA > 400 copies/mL at Week 48 or their last visit (at or after Week 4), or having a single 
rebound of HIV-1 RNA > 1000 copies/mL at Week 2, 4, or 6. 
In this single-arm study, 1 subject was analysed for resistance development and had no evidence of 
genotypic and phenotypic resistance to any component of the FTC/RPV/TDF STR at Week 48 (Day 337 
and Day 362 were analysed). This subject had an overall adherence rate by pill count of 95.2%, 
however, missed a minimum of 10 doses of study drug between Week 24 and Week 36, and at least 9 
doses between Week 36 and Week 48. A viral rebound was recorded (> 100,000 copies/ml), that did 
not result in discontinuation of Eviplera. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The mean observed rilpivirine trough concentrations are shown in the table below. 
At week 1, the mean rilpivirine trough concentration of 31.6 ng/ml was lower than those observed in 
the Phase 3 trials in patients C209 and C215 (mean: 80 ± 37 ng/ml; median 74 (range 1 – 300 ng/ml) 
not on efavirenz therapy, indicative for the inductive effect of efavirenz on rilpivirine metabolism. 
Around week 4 – 6, plasma rilpivirine trough concentrations were in the normal range (see also the 
figure below).  
Evafirenz trough plasma concentrations decreased slowly, which is expected as evafirenz has a long 
elimination half-life. After 4 weeks, in about half of the included patients, efavirenz trough 
concentrations were still measurable (see also figure below).

2.5.1.  Efficacy results - Additional analysis on baseline viral loads and CD4 
counts 
The CHMP requested to discuss the impact of baseline viral load and CD4 count on response to 
Eviplera.  
The collection of pre-ART BLVL and CD4 counts was not mandatory for enrolment in the study hence 
this data is not available for all subjects who experienced VF. 
The MAH performed a post-hoc analysis of pre-ART HIV-1 RNA levels on virologic response (Table 3). 
In this table the virologic failures are listed by pre-ART BLVL (<100,000 copies/mL, >100,000 
copies/mL and missing). The data do not indicate any association between virologic success (by the 
Snapshot method) and pre-ARV HIV-1 RNA in patients who are virologically suppressed on a PI/r 
based regimen and switch to Eviplera.

GS-US-264-0111 
Pre-ART CD4 values were not collected for study GS-US-264-0111 so an analysis cannot be performed. 
Pre-ART BLVL values were available for 35 of the 49 subjects (71.4%). Of these subjects, there were 
57.1% (n = 20) of patients with BLVL <100,000 copies/mL and 42.9% (n = 15) with BLVL > 100,000 
copies/mL. At Week 48, 94% (46/49) of patients remained virologically suppressed, and 4% (2/49) 
were considered VFs (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL). One subject (No. 3832) had a pre-ART BLVL HIV-1 
RNA of .100,000 copies/mL and 1 subject (No. 3839) had a pre-ART BLVL HIV-1 RNA of slightly 
>100,000 copies/mL. In this latter subject, the RPV plasma concentration level was very low at Week 
36 and was below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) at Week 48, corresponding to the time of VF and was 
consistent with subject’s admission of non-adherence. 
Serious questions about the accuracy of the database were raised, since the most essential data was 
missing for 23/317 in the Eviplera group and 14/159 in the SBR group: baseline characteristics of the 
subjects were apparently not adequately recorded. Similarly: in 19/317 patients receiving Eviplera and 
in 13/159 patients in the SBR group not even the initial CD4 count was recorded. The information that 
led to initiation of cART in the first place is missing in almost 10% of patients.

The MAH performed sensitivity analyses where the subjects with unknown pre-ART BLVL and CD4 were 
combined with the group of highest theoretical concern (i.e. BLVL >100,000 c/mL and CD4 ≤ 100) 
(Table 12 and Table 13). No trends are observed with the most conservative assumption.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study GS-US-264-0106 
In this phase III randomized, open-label switch study from a PI-based regimen to RPV-based fixed 
dose combination a large sample size was collected with patients on PI-based regimens. The reason for 
switch in 88% of the cases was the desire to simplify the regimen. Some of the patients were relatively 
short on PI-based regimens (<6 months) with all having viral suppression at screening but not all at 
the moment of switch. Considering the desire to switch it comes as no surprise that in this open label 
study the results of a HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire were significantly better for the new 
regimen. 
Efficacy was demonstrated, because introduction of a RPV-based regimen after switch from PI did not 
result in reductions of proportions of subjects with Viral Load < 50 copies/ml at week 24 when 
FTC/RPV/TDF was compared to PI-regimen continuation.  
After 24 weeks 3 and 8 subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and SBR group respectively developed 
virologic failure, and an additional 2 from week 24 to week 48 in the FTC/RPV/TDF group. Four from 
these 5 subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF group developed mutations resulting not only in loss of RPV and 
other components of the NNRTI class (n=3 out of 4), but also in M184I/V substitution (n=4). This loss 
of therapeutic options/reduced sensitivity to NRTIs was also demonstrated in the registration studies of 
RPV.  
Unknown is whether the cases that failed on RPV after switch were subjects who had a viral load > 
100,000 copies/ml at the initiation of their very first regimen. That level of baseline viremia is a 
contraindication to start RPV in treatment-naïve patients, but after virologic suppression with a 
different regimen a safe switch is most likely to be anticipated. However, when irreversible 
physiological changes may have occurred due to an advanced stage of HIV infection with high baseline 
viral loads and low CD4 counts that in some way influence the response to RPV in treatment naïve 
patients, the switch to RPV even after viral suppression with a different regimen may result in 
Assessment report  
Eviplera 
EMA/CHMP/250768/201 
Page 48/89 
 
 
 
 
suboptimal results and loss of virologic suppression. An example of such a physiological change could 
be loss of gastric acidity in advanced HIV infection, which would decrease RPV plasma concentrations.  
There was a long discussion on baseline viral loads and CD4 counts that is exposed separately in the 
section 2.3.2.2. Efficacy results - Additional analysis on baseline viral loads and CD4 counts. 
Disappointingly, self-reported adherence did not improve with the once daily administration of Eviplera, 
even though 88% of subjects desired to simplify their regimen. 
The switch did result in more frequent discontinuations with the new regimen: because of treatment –
emergent AEs 2.8% in the FTC/RPV/TDF group discontinued versus 0% in the SBR group. Increases in 
ALT, AST, and both transaminases occurred more frequently in the RPV-based regimens, and resulted 
in 2 cases in permanent discontinuations in the Delayed switch group. However, in most switch studies 
there are more treatment emergent AEs in those that switch, since the population has been selected to 
tolerate their pre-switch regimen.

In single arm open label switch study GS-US-264-0111 from EFV/FTC/TDF to Eviplera in 48 subjects 
who did not tolerate EFV,  2 (4.2%) virologically suppressed subjects experienced virologic failure after 
week 24 following the switch. 
This number of failures is relatively similar to that in the registration study TMC278-C209 
(RPV/FTC/TDF vs EFV/FTC/TDF) that showed a 4.6% rebound percentage, albeit in subjects who 
were not virologically suppressed at baseline but who initiated cART as naïve patients. 
It was unknown whether these failures in the RPV group after switch had baseline viral loads > 
100,000 copies/ml when they initially started with EFV.  
Although the AEs did not result in discontinuations the virologic failures are worrisome. RPV is sensitive 
to small PK disturbances e.g. due to lack of sufficient food concomitant with drug intake or due to use 
of concomitant PPI or due to lack of adherence.  The latter factor was demonstrated once more in this 
study GS-US-264-0111, where 1 non-adherent subject lost virologic suppression.  
Next to possible high baseline viral load at start of cART with EFV, another possible explanation could 
be that this subject and the subject experiencing repeated low level viremia from week 24 onwards 
developed resistant mutations due to prior underdosing of RPV directly after the switch from EFV due 
to the inductive effect of EFV on the RPV plasma levels in the weeks after the switch. It is unknown 
whether the 2 subjects experiencing virologic failure had particularly or extensively prolonged low RPV 
concentrations after switch due to prolonged induction of CYP3A4 by EFV.  
However, resistance mutations were not found as demonstrated in the population sampling of the 
single subject with viral loads > 400 copies/ml. Follow up of these cases and the other subjects in this 
study was considered essential to determine whether relative underexposure to RPV in the post-EFV 
switch period results in more failures > 48 weeks after switch and also RPV-resistance mutations. 
As such, lack of virological suppression was demonstrated in two cases, but most likely related late 
failures related to poor intake of the registered 25 mg dose, which is sensitive to non-compliance.  
Indication 
The extension of the indication as initially proposed implied the creation of a new patient category 
(‘treatment experienced but not experiencing virologic failure’) the appropriateness of which is 
questionable as it is more a patient management issue.

The current regulatory thinking and the state of the art of the HIV therapeutics (e.g. the EMA guideline 
released under consultation during this procedure2) are moving away from the terms ‘treatment-naïve’ 
or ‘treatment-experienced’, because it does not adequately reflect the susceptibility of the virus either 
before or during exposure to ARVs. Therefore the focus should be on antiviral activity of the medicinal 
product (i.e. the virus) and not on (prior) exposure history (i.e. the patient).  
It would not be appropriate to indicate the product in ART experienced virologically suppressed 
patients without virological failure history as this would not adequately reflect viral susceptibility 
issues, because even patients experiencing virologic failure on ARVs from another class than the 
NNRTIs may benefit from initiation of NNRTI-based (i.e. Rilpivirine-based) ART if their viral load does 
not exceed 100,000 copies/ml and the virus population is susceptible to the 3 components.  
In their studies the MAH has provided data on efficacy and safety in virologically suppressed patients 
that switch from other regimens to Eviplera. Reasons to switch are diverse and can be related to 
compliance, simplicity, tolerability, desire to switch, availability, reimbursement issues, taste or size of 
tablets, etc. expressed either by the patient or by the physician. This information is not relevant for 
SmPC section 4.1, but antiretroviral activity is.  
The information from the studies should concisely be included in SmPC section 5.1 to demonstrate 
sustained viral suppression and discontinuations after switch and include information that switch 
studies were only done in virologically suppressed patients, that evidence of efficacy was obtained only 
for combination of RPV and Emtricitabine/tenofovir (not with other NRTIs) and that patients had viral 
suppression for at least 6 months (PI) or 3 months (emtricitabine/efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate).  
Studies in patients experiencing virologic failure on efavirenz in Atripla and subsequently switched to 
Eviplera have not been performed, therefore clinical evidence to support this switch is lacking. 
Rilpivirine has not been studied in patients with pre-selected NNRTI resistance either due to 
transmitted resistance or due to virologic failure on efavirenz which is also mentioned in the SmPC: 
“Considering all of the available in vitro and in vivo data in treatment naïve subjects, the following 
resistance-associated mutations, when present at baseline, may affect the activity of Eviplera: K65R, 
K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q, E138R, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, M184I, M184V, 
Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I and M230L.” 
The K103N mutation, associated with failure on efavirenz, is not in this list. Claims that K103N will not 
result in virologic failure would be based on very limited numbers (n=17 in GS-US-264-0106) and 
cannot be supported. 
It would not be justified to assume that the resistance-mutations associated with rilpivirine are distinct 
to those associated with other NNRTIs. This has either not been studied extensively or partial overlap 
was evident in vitro and vivo studies. In addition, the current dose of 25 mg rilpivirine in Eviplera has 
not been studied in virologic failure on efavirenz. 
Therefore Eviplera should only be used in patients without known mutations associated with resistance 
to the NNRTI class. 
Reference to class resistance is in line with the within the current regulatory thinking and the state of 
the art of the HIV therapeutics as shown in evolving CHMP guidelines on HIV medicines which

emphasizes that only with appropriate studies new agents in an existing class may be approved in case 
of treatment failure on agents in that class. 
Uncertainties 
With some levels of uncertainty is can be concluded from the available data that not the inclusion 
criteria (i.e. viral load above or below 100,000 or CD4 count above or below 100) at the very start of 
cART are important, but that failure is driven by other factors during treatment e.g., poor adherence or 
diminished concentrations due to insufficient food intake with RPV resulting in low concentrations. 
Baseline data are missing from a proportion of patients: 7% of subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF and 9% in 
the SBR arm had unknown pre-ART BLVL and 6% of subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF arm and 8% of 
subjects in the SBR arm had unknown pre-ART CD4 counts.  
However, in a sensitivity analysis that included these proportions in the group with high baseline viral 
load or low CD4 count, differences with the actually obtained data on success or failure were not 
substantial; therefore no issues arise regarding the potential impact of baseline viral load on CD4 
count. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study GS-US-264-0106 showed that switch from PI to RPV-based regimens is efficacious from a 
virological and immunological perspective, but that the simplification of regimen is not a major 
stimulus in adherence.  
The results from this study could be added to section 5.1 of the SmPC to demonstrate the results of 
the switch in virologically suppressed patients if baseline viral loads at start of their very first regimen 
have been reviewed and did not influence treatment outcomes after switch. 
2.6.  Clinical safety aspects 
2.6.1.  Study GS-US-264-0106 
Patient exposure  
A total of 469 subjects received at least 1 dose of FTC/RPV/TDF, including 317 subjects in the 
FTC/RPV/TDF group and 152 subjects in the Delayed Switch group. The mean (SD) duration of 
exposure to FTC/RPV/TDF was 45.6 (9.21) weeks in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 23.2 (3.93) weeks in 
the Delayed Switch group 
Adverse events 
The percentage of subjects who reported a treatment-related AE that was considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug was similar between the FTC/RPV/TDF group (24.9%) and the 
Delayed Switch group (23.0%) during 48 and 24 weeks of FTC/RPV/TDF therapy, respectively. The 
percentage of subjects who reported a treatment-related AE that was considered by the investigator to 
be related to study drug was lower among the subjects remaining on their current ARV regimen for the 
first 24 weeks of the study (2.5% in the SBR group).

Table 17.  GS-US-264-0106: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to Study Drug (Safety 
Analysis Set) 
There were no study drug-related AEs in the psychiatric disorders in the SBR group during the first 24 
weeks of the study. 
In the group receiving FTC/RPV/TDF study drug-related disorders were 
- 
- 
-

abnormal dreams: 6 (1.9%) 
sleep disorder: 5 (1.6%) 
insomnia: 7 (2.2%) 
and other disorders in single subjects: agitation, depression/restlessness (in 2 subjects), 
anxiety, libido decreased, nervousness 
Suicidal ideation was reported by 2 subjects, 1 in the FTC/RPV/TDF and 1 subject in the Delayed 
Switch group, but both of these SAEs of suicidal ideation resolved while study drug was on-going. Also 
in the FTC/RPV/TDF group 1 subject temporarily interrupted treatment due to affective disorder during 
6 days and 1 subject experienced an exacerbation of bipolar disorder. 
Nervous system disorders 
Twelve of 317 subjects (3.8%) in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 8 of 152 subjects (5.3%) in the Delayed 
Switch group reported AEs in the nervous system disorders (headache, disturbance of attention, 
dizziness, paraesthesia, lethargy, and ageusia, amnesia, memory impairment and somnolence) that 
were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug, but in the SBR group only one 
(hyperesthesia) was reported. 
Also 3 SAE were reported (hypaesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, sensory loss) in the FTC/RPV/TDF 
group, there resolved and in two cases resulted in temporary interruption of cART. 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Seven subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF group, 3 in the delayed switch and 0 in the SBR group experienced 
hepatobiliary disorders: 2 hypertransaminasaemia and other events in single cases in FTC/RPV/TDF 
and 3 in the delayed switch (cytolytic hepatitis), steatosis (2 subjects in FTC/RPV/TDF.  
Four subjects (1.3%) in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 3 subjects (2.0%) in the Delayed Switch group 
reported AEs of cell death (cytolysis) that were considered by the investigator to be related to study 
drug No subjects reported an AE in the hepatobiliary disorders SOC or PT cell death while remaining on 
their baseline ARV regimen (SBR group) during the first 24 weeks of the study.

Two subjects experienced AEs of liver-related laboratory abnormalities (transaminase increase) 
resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug; both in the Delayed Switch group. 
Rash 
Seven of 317 subjects (2.2%) in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 4 of 152 subjects (2.6%) in the Delayed 
Switch group reported rash during the study. Two subjects (1.3%) remaining on their baseline ARV 
regimen (SBR group) during the first 24 weeks of the study reported AEs of rash. All were non-serious 
and 3 were considered related to study drug, all in RPV-receiving subjects, that resulted in temporary 
interruption of study medication in 1 subject. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events  
No subjects died during the study.

Subjects (Safety Analysis Set) 
Three subjects (all in the FTC/RPV/TDF group) experienced treatment-emergent SAEs that were 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug: toxic nephropathy due to TDF without 
treatment interruption & renal impairment and dyspnoea the latter two resulting in permanent 
discontinuation.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Thirteen subjects permanently discontinued study drug due to a treatment-emergent AE (7 in the 
FTC/RPV/TDF group and 6 in the Delayed Switch group). Of these 13 subjects, 12 subjects 
discontinued study drug due to an AE before Week 48 and 1 subject discontinued study drug due to an 
AE that occurred after Week 48 during the extension phase. No subjects discontinued from the study 
due to a treatment-emergent AE while remaining on their baseline ARV regimen (SBR group).

- 
2 cases of depression  in the FTC/RPV/TDF group  
2 cases of insomnia, one in each group with RPV 
one: abdominal distension or pain, dyspepsia, fatigue, cytolytic hepatitis, ALT or AST or both 
transaminases increased, back pain, osteoporosis, headache, agitation, anxiety, glycosuria, 
proteinuria, renal impairment, cough, dyspnoea, respiratory tract congestion, throat tightness, 
hyperhidrosis, and hot flush. 
Grade 3 treatment-emergent AEs that resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug included  
headache  in 1 subject (FTC/RPV/TDF group); ALT and AST increased in 1 subject (Delayed Switch); 
agitation, anxiety, and depression in 1 Subject (FTC/RPV/TDF); depression in 1 Subject (FTC/RPV/TDF 
group); and dyspnoea (SAE) in 1 Subject (FTC/RPV/TDF group). 
Grade 4 treatment-emergent AEs reported during the study included suicidal ideation (Delayed Switch 
group), pyrexia (SBR group), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (Delayed Switch group), and 
acute respiratory failure and asthma (FTC/RPV/TDF group) . None of these events were considered by 
the investigator to be related to study drug. All of these Grade 4 treatment-emergent AEs were 
considered to be SAEs. 
No Grade 4 treatment-emergent AE resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug. 
Temporary interruptions 
Five subjects had treatment-emergent AEs resulting in temporary interruption of study drug (3 
subjects [0.9%] in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 2 subjects [1.3%] in the Delayed Switch group), but 
none in the SBR group. Only one case was considered related to study drug: rash and decreased 
appetite in 1 subject. 
Laboratory findings

Renal parameters 
In vitro, RPV has been shown to inhibit organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), a renal transporter 
involved in creatinine tubular secretion. Overall, serum creatinine elevations were evident by Week 4 
and stable through Week 24 in subjects receiving FTC/RPV/TDF compared to subjects remaining on 
their baseline ARV regimen (SBR group). 
At Week 24, the mean increase in serum creatinine was statistically significantly greater in the 
FTC/RPV/TDF group compared with the SBR group (mean [SD] increase of 0.05 [0.119] mg/dL vs. 
0.01 [0.103] mg/dL, respectively; p < 0.001).  The increase in serum creatinine was generally 
maintained through Week 48 in the FTC/RPV/TDF group (mean [SD] increase of 0.05 [0.115) mg/dL at 
Week 48). An increase in serum creatinine was also observed in the Delayed Switch group over 24 
weeks of FTC/RPV/TDF therapy. 
This increase was not worse in case of co-administration of TDF in the regimen, because in RPV-
containing regimens similar trends were demonstrated with or without concomitant TDF. 
Accordingly, decreases in estimated CLcr using Cockcroft-Gault were evident by Week 4 and stable 
through Week 24 in subjects receiving FTC/RPV/TDF compared to subjects in the SBR group: mean -
3.5 versus -0.7 mL/min, respectively, which was evident also in the 24 weeks after delayed switch to 
Eviplera. No further decrease was observed in the period from week 24-48. 
TDF in background regimen did not result in more decrease of eGFR compared to values obtained in 
subjects without TDF. 
Study drug related renal SAE 
One Subject in the FTC/RPV/TDF group had a study drug-related SAE of renal impairment (Grade 2) on 
Day 60 that was on-going at the end of the study. Concurrent AEs included glycosuria and proteinuria 
(both Grade 1). The subject was permanently discontinued from the study due to the events of renal 
impairment and proteinuria. 
Another SAE was also considered to be related to study drug: on-going Nephropathy toxic (Grade 2) in 
1 subject in the FTC/RPV/TDF group on Day 262, but no action was taken with the study drug.

Glucose 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in mean values for fasting glucose during the 
study.  
Lipids 
At study entry, 11.7% of subjects in the randomized FTC/RPV/TDF group and 18.2% of subjects in the 
SBR group reported use of a lipid-modifying agent. Few subjects (≤ 2.8% in each treatment group) 
added or modified the use of lipid-modifying agents during the study. 
Overall, fasting total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, direct LDL cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, and the 
ratio of total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol decreased to a greater extent through Week 24 among 
subjects switching to FTC/RPV/TDF at study baseline (randomized FTC/RPV/TDF group) versus those 
maintaining their baseline PI + 2 NRTIs regimen (SBR group). Overall differences between these 
treatment groups for all 5 of these lipid parameters were statistically significant at Week 24 (p < 
0.001). At Week 24, the mean (SD) changes from baseline were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Fasting total cholesterol: −25 (30.2) mg/dL in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and −1 (25.9) mg/dL in 
the SBR group 
Fasting HDL cholesterol: −4 (10.3) mg/dL in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and −1 (8.2) mg/dL in 
the SBR group 
Fasting direct LDL cholesterol: −16 (25.6) mg/dL in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 0 (23.7) 
mg/dL in the SBR group 
Fasting triglycerides: −53 (110.1) mg/dL in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 3 (100.1) mg/dL in 
the SBR group 
•  Ratio of fasting total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol: −0.27 (0.913) in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 
0.08 (0.771) mg/dL in the SBR group 
After subjects in the SBR group switched to FTC/RPV/TDF therapy at Week 24 (i.e. entered the 
Delayed Switch group), similar decreases in lipid parameters were observed in the Delayed Switch 
group over Weeks 24 to 48 of the study as were observed during the first 24 weeks of therapy in the 
randomized FTC/RPV/TDF group. 
In general, mean decreases from baseline to Week 24 of FTC/RPV/TDF therapy were larger in subjects 
with prior LPV/r use at study entry compared with those without prior LPV/r use.  
When the mean values and mean changes from baseline in fasting glucose and lipid parameters were 
analysed excluding subjects who started/modified lipid-lowering agents during the study, results were 
very similar to those described above for the analyses including these subjects. 
Increase in percentage of subjects with normal total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides 
The increase in the percentage of subjects with desirable total cholesterol levels observed at Weeks 12 
and 24 in the randomized FTC/RPV/TDF group were generally maintained through Week 48 of therapy.  
After subjects in the SBR group switched to FTC/RPV/TDF therapy at Week 24 (ie, entered the Delayed 
Switch group), similar fasting total cholesterol category results were observed in the Delayed Switch 
group over Weeks 24 to 48 of the study as were observed during the first 24 weeks of therapy in the 
randomized FTC/RPV/TDF group described above. 
HDL levels were not significantly affected in the 3 groups.

LDL cholesterol: more subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF group obtained optimal categories of LDL after 12 
and 24 weeks than in the SBR group. The increases in the percentage of subjects with optimal and 
near optimal fasting direct LDL levels and the decreases in the percentages of subjects with borderline 
high, high, and very high levels observed at Weeks 12 and 24 in the randomized FTC/RPV/TDF group 
were generally maintained through Week 48 of therapy and the Delayed switch group mimicked these 
trends after switch from PI. 
These trends were the same in the different triglyceride categories and for different categories of ratio 
of fasting total cholesterol:HDL. 
Vital signs 
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) showed 
no consistent pattern of change during the course of therapy that would be suggestive of any clinically 
significant treatment-emergent effect.

Table 20.  GS-US-264-0111: Overall Summary of Adverse Events (Safety Analysis Set) 
AEs in at least 2 subjects 
Diarrhoea was the most frequently occurring treatment-emergent AE (8 subjects [16.3%]), followed by 
upper respiratory tract infection (7 subjects [14.3%]) and insomnia (6 subjects [12.2%]. 
Grade 3 events: There were four Grade 3 events reported in 3 subjects during the study:  
1.  bradycardia and dyspnoea in 1 subject (both SAEs),  
2.  haematuria in 1 subject,  
3.  nephrolithiasis in 1 subject.  
The haematuria and nephrolithiasis were nonserious AEs and both resolved during the study. None of 
the Grade 3 AEs were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. Both events did not 
result in discontinuation of study drug. 
No subject experienced a Grade 4 AE.

Study drug related AEs: All other AEs were Grade 1 and 2 AEs, and 12 subjects (24.5%) experienced 
AEs during the study that were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. The highest 
incidence of treatment-related AEs was in the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders (7 subjects [14.3%].

Psychiatric disorders: Adverse events in the psychiatric disorders SOC were reported in 14 subjects 
(28.6%), with the most frequently occurring AE in that SOC being insomnia (6 subjects [12.2%]). 
Anxiety and depression were reported in 3 subjects (6.1%) each and abnormal dreams were reported 
in 2 subjects (4.1%). Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and stress were reported in 1 subject

Nervous system disorders: Adverse events reported in the nervous system disorders SOC occurred in 7 
subjects (14.3%). The following events were reported in 1 subject (2.0%) each: amnesia, 
cervicobrachial syndrome, disturbance in attention, dizziness, headache, poor quality sleep, and 
psychomotor hyperactivity. 
Rash: Two subjects (4.1%) experienced a rash during the study, both of which were Grade 1; 1 of the 
rash AEs was considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
Laboratory findings 
Two subjects each had a Grade 3 increased creatine kinase value, and a Grade 4 increased creatine 
kinase value was reported in 1 subject. No other Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported 
for any other parameter during the study. 
Two subjects with increased serum amylase had elevated values at screening and baseline. 
Creatinine 
Serum creatinine elevations were evident by Week 4 (mean change of +0.07 mg/dL) and stable 
through Week 48 (mean change of +0.08 mg/dL; this effect has been known since the development of 
RPV and has been associated with creatinine secretion inhibition. 
Lipids 
There were statistically significant decreases in fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, and direct LDL 
cholesterol at Week 48, that started as early as week 12.

2.6.3.  Other safety results 
Adverse events of interest 
Elevated CPK 
Data from Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive HIV-1 Infected Patients 
In the ECHO/THRIVE studies in treatment-naive patients, no TEAEs relevant to elevated CPK were 
reported through 96 weeks of treatment; no CPK laboratory abnormality data were available from 
ECHO/ THRIVE. In Study GS-US-264-0110, similar frequencies of TEAEs and laboratory abnormalities 
relevant to elevated CPK were observed in the FTC/RPV/TDF and EFV/FTC/TDF arms (’blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased’ as a TEAE occurred in 2.3% of subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF arm and in 1.3% 
of subjects in the EFV/FTC/TDF arm; Grades 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities involving CPK occurred in 
5.1% of subjects in both arms; and marked laboratory abnormalities involving CPK occurred in 4.8% of 
subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF arm and in 4.1% of subjects in the EFV/FTC/TDF arm). 
Rhabdomyolysis as a TEAE was not reported in any of the studies in treatment-naive patients (through 
96 weeks of treatment in ECHO/THRIVE and through 48 weeks of treatment in Study GS-US-264-
0110). 
Data from Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced HIV-1 Infected Patients 
In Study GS-US-264-0106, ‘blood creatine phosphokinase increased’ as a TEAE occurred at similar and 
low frequencies in all groups analysed in the study (0.6% over 24 weeks and 0.6% over 48 weeks in 
the FTC/RPV/TDF group, 0.6% over 24 weeks in the SBR group, and 1.3% over 24 weeks in the 
Delayed Switch to FTC/RPV/TDF group). Two subjects (No. 0369-3203 and No. 0369-3223) in the 
Delayed Switch to FTC/RPV/TDF group of Study GS-US-264-0106 experienced non-serious TEAEs of 
rhabdomyolysis. Both cases were reported by the same investigator in France and the non-serious 
nature of the events was confirmed by the investigator upon querying. One of the cases was 
considered to be Grade 3 in severity. In both subjects, the events resolved with FTC/RPV/TDF on-going 
and, per the investigator, the events were likely related to muscular exercise. In both cases, the 
reported event of rhabdomyolysis was associated with increased CPK levels, but no other muscle 
symptoms or laboratory abnormalities were reported. 
No TEAEs involving elevated CPK or rhabdomyolysis were observed in Study GS-US-264-0111.  
The frequency of elevated CPK as a Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormality and as a marked laboratory 
abnormality (defined as increasing by at least 3 toxicity grades from baseline) did not show a 
consistent effect in the FTC/RPV/TDF and Delayed Switch arms of Study GS-US-264-0106 (frequencies 
of 1.6% and 1.6% over 24 weeks in the FTC/RPV/TDF group, 2.5% and 2.5% over 48 weeks in the 
FTC/RPV/TDF group, 1.9% and 1.9% over 24 weeks in the SBR group, and 4.6% and 3.9% over 24 
weeks in the Delayed Switch to FTC/RPV/TDF group for Grades 3 to 4 and for marked laboratory 
abnormalities, respectively). In Study GS-US-264-0111, the frequency of elevated CPK as a Grade 3 to 
4 laboratory abnormality was 6.1% and as a marked laboratory abnormality was also 6.1%. 
In 4 of 5 subjects who experienced increased CPK over 48 weeks of treatment in Study GS-US-264-
0106 (2 in the FTC/RPV/TDF group, 1 in the SBR group, and 1 in the Delayed Switch group), the 
events resolved with continuing therapy, suggesting alternative aetiology. One subject (No. 5464-
3272) in the FTC/RPV/TDF arm of Study GS-US-264-0106 who experienced a TEAE of 
’blood creat
phosphokinase increased’ and a Grade 4 laboratory abnormality of increased CPK was receiving a 
statin (atorvastatin calcium) during the study. In this subject, the event resolved with continuing 
Assessment report

Page 65/89 
 
 
 
 
FTC/RPV/TDF therapy. In 1 subject in the Delayed Switch to FTC/RPV/TDF group, the event had not 
resolved at the time of the reporting, with on-going FTC/RPV/TDF treatment.  
The MAH position was that elevated CPK can be caused by many factors, including, but not limited to, 
strenuous exercise, use of statins and viral infections. In Study GS-US-264-0106, 11.7% of subjects in 
the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 18.2% of subjects in the SBR group were using lipid-modifying 
medications (including statins) at baseline. 
The MAH considered that in the light of the variety of alternative explanations for elevated CPK, the 
fact that the frequencies of CPK elevations in antiretroviral treatment-naive and antiretroviral 
treatment-experienced patients were low in patients receiving an RPV-containing regimen in clinical 
studies, and because elevated CPK is already described in the SmPC as an ADR for FTC, elevated CPK 
should not be included in the Eviplera SmPC as an ADR for RPV. 
Diarrhoea  
According to the MAH, the Phase 2b and 3 studies of RPV consistently showed a lower frequency of 
diarrhoea in the RPV arm compared to EFV, at the incidences previously shown. In the reported cases 
from the Phase 3 studies, time to onset was variable, there were no grade 4 events and only 1 grade 3 
event of diarrhoea, and these events did not lead to permanent treatment discontinuation. A low 
proportion (4.2%) of subjects had events of diarrhoea considered at least possibly related to RPV by 
the investigators in the Phase 3 studies.  
The MAH noted that the emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) background regimen, 
for which diarrhoea is listed as a very common ADR in the SmPC of both drugs, was associated with a 
higher incidence of diarrhoea than the other 2 background regimens (zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine 
(3TC), and abacavir (ABC)/3TC) used in the registrational Phase 3 studies. The pattern of the lower 
incidence in the RPV arm compared to the EFV arm is observed with each background regimen. In the 
Week 96 subgroup analysis by background regimen, the incidence of diarrhoea with FTC/TDF was 
15.6% (86/550) in the RPV arm versus 16.7% (91/546) for EFV the incidence of diarrhoea with 
AZT/3TC was 5.9% (6/101) versus 10.7%.(11/103); while the incidence of diarrhoea with ABC/3TC 
was 5.7% (2/35) compared to 27.3% (9/33). The observed frequency with the FTC/TDF background 
regimen was consistent with the known incidence of diarrhoea as a very common ADR (incidence ≥ 
10.0%) for FTC/TDF. According to the MAH, this shows that RPV is unlikely to have contributed to the 
observed cases of diarrhoea in the RPV arm when the FTC/TDF background regimen was used. In 
addition, diarrhoea is listed as a common ADR to ABC, AZT, and 3TC providing an explanation for the 
observed cases of diarrhoea with the other background regimens. To exclude contributory effect of 
these background regimens, the MAH also considered data from a placebo-controlled Phase 1 study 
(TMC278-TiDP6-C152), where healthy subjects (N=60) received 11 days of treatment with RPV 25 mg 
qd or placebo. In this study, the frequency of diarrhoea was very low, occurring in 1/58 (1.7%) of 
subjects in the RPV arm and 2/59 (3.4%) on placebo. 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
GS-US-264-0106 
According to the results the new regimen was not an improvement compared to their old regimen in 
some specific areas: 
• 
Any AE study drug related: 24% vs 2.5% (RPV vs continuation of PI-based regimen, 
respectively) 
Assessment report  
Eviplera 
EMA/CHMP/250768/201 
Page 66/89 
 
 
 
•  Grade 2-4 study drug related: 9.9% vs 0% 
•  More nervous system disorders: 14.9% vs 9.4% 
•  More psychiatric disorders: 17.5% vs 6.3% 
•  More gastrointestinal disorders: 27.5% vs 16.4% (mostly diarrhoea and nausea) 
•  More frequent CK elevations are noticed while taking RPV 
On the contrary, lipids were favourably affected by the switch to RPV, because significant decreases 
were noticed in cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides. However, these decreases did not seem to benefit 
patients in the short term, because only rarely did these decrease result in cessation of statin therapy 
(< 2.8%). 
GS-US-264-0111 
Safety issues were not prominent in study GS-US-264-0111 except the frequent occurrence of 
diarrhoea (16.3%) and insomnia (12.2%), and elevations in CK at least grade 3 (3/48; 6.3%). The 
observed improvement in lipids was not considered clinically relevant.  
Tolerability 
The proposed extension of the indication - treatment switch - is motivated by tolerability issues of the 
previous regimen, which suggests superiority of rilpivirine (RPV) on matters of tolerability, but that has 
not been subject of evaluation in well-designed studies. Findings from study GS-US-264-0106 
demonstrated more treatment-emergent discontinuations due to RPV compared to continuation of 
initial PI-based regimens. 
In addition to GS-US-264-0106, tolerability has been evaluated in the Phase III studies ECHO, THRIVE 
and GS-US-264-0110 according to the MAH. FTC/RPV/TDF was found to be well tolerated in all of these 
studies, and showed a differentiated safety profile compared to the control regimen. 
It is recognised that there is an inherent bias in the design of any switch study (against the switch 
group) in virologically suppressed patients, because such studies select for enrolment those subjects 
who have been tolerating their baseline regimen.  
The discontinuation rates due to TEAEs in Study GS-US-264-0106 for the subjects switching to Eviplera 
were comparable with the previous clinical experience of Eviplera: 
- 
In study GS-US-264-0106 13 subjects permanently discontinued study drug due to a TEAE (7 
of 317 subjects [2.2%] in the FTC/RPV/TDF group and 6 of 152 subjects [3.9%] in the Delayed 
Switch group). 
- 
Pooled ECHO/THRIVE, Week 48 results reported discontinuation due to a TEAE of 2.2% 
(12/550) of subjects in the RPV + FTC/TDF subset versus 7.1% (39/546) of subjects in the EFV 
+ FTC/TDF subset. Week 96 results reported discontinuation due to a TEAE of 3.6% (20/550) 
of subjects in the RPV + FTC/TDF subset versus 8.1% (44/546) of subjects in the EFV + 
FTC/TDF subset. 
- 
In GS-US-264-0110, Week 48 results reported discontinuations due to a TEAE of 2.5% 
(10/394) of subjects in the FTC/RPV/TDF arm versus 8.7% (34/392) or subjects in the 
EFV/FTC/TDF arm. 
Assessment report  
Eviplera 
EMA/CHMP/250768/201 
Page 67/89 
 
 
 
The patient-reported symptom data (HIV symptom index) and lipid results from study GS-US-264-
0106 for subjects suppressed on a PI-based regimen switching to FTC/RPV/TDF shows an improvement 
in these PI-mediated side effects. 
It is also recognised that treatment switch could be motivated not only by tolerability issues with the 
previous regimen, but also for reasons of simplification of the ART to a single-tablet regimen.  
The tolerability features of RPV-based regimens at initiation of cART or after switch have never been 
evaluated as primary endpoints in comparative and adequately powered studies, but physicians and 
patients can decide on the selection of any guideline-recommended ARV based on anticipated 
tolerability issues (e.g. known negative cardiovascular risk profile, renal impairment or history of 
psychiatric disorder etc) or perceived TEAEs on their current regimen.  This could imply switching from 
PI to NNRTI as was done in study GS-US-264-0106, or any other change as considered clinically 
relevant in the management of that particular patient. As long as the ARV has demonstrated 
antiretroviral activity in that patient group, the decision on the selection of that particular ARV can be 
accepted. This has been demonstrated in the submitted studies. 
Therefore while the concerns regarding tolerability of Eviplera have been only partly addressed, they 
should not prevent its use in the proposed target population. 
The MAH considered that CPK elevations should be attributed to the other ARVs in the combination and 
not to RPV. Being more uncommon than diarrhoea, possible association between RPV and CK 
elevations become difficult to establish and various explanations can be provided including statin use. 
Because most elevations resolved without treatment discontinuation the link is debatable. 
The occurrence of diarrhoea in different cohorts of patients receiving RPV, RPV in combination with 
other ARVs and comparison with occurrence of diarrhoea in subjects receiving either placebo or EFV 
was reported by the MAH. Increases in occurrence of diarrhoea in patients receiving RPV are 
considered minimal or largely influenced by co-administered ARVs.  
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Study GS-US-264-0106 showed that switch from PI to RPV-based regimen results in more intolerability 
and safety issues, including more RPV-related discontinuations. These AEs can be anticipated because 
most are known AEs.  
Most patients stayed on Eviplera in study GS-US-264-0111 after switching from EFV/FTC/TDF, but 
considering the rapid virologic failure in 2/48 subjects after 24 weeks most likely associated with non-
adherence and the reported gastrointestinal and psychiatric AEs the actual benefit of this switch in 
clinical practice is not evident. Since no patient satisfaction was examined, no data is available how the 
switch from EFV to RPV was appreciated by patients. 
2.7.  Risk management plan 
2.7.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
The RMP v4.0 submitted to support this variation could be acceptable if the following issues were 
resolved: 
Assessment report  
Eviplera 
EMA/CHMP/250768/201 
Page 68/89 
 
 
 
 
- 
The RMP should be updated with the information that Eviplera might have a drug-drug interaction 
with other medications more sensitive to P-glycoprotein (P gp) activity than digoxin, as a result of 
CHMP opinion reached on 21 February 2013 (EMA/CHMP/99443/2013) related to variation 
(EMEA/H/C/002312/II/0020) following results from study TMC278IFD1001  
- 
The MAH was requested to include as important potential risk: 
•  Off-label use in patients with a viral load between 100,000 and 500,000 copies/ML  
•  Off-label use in treatment experienced patients without virologic suppression  
These issues should be monitored with routine pharmacovigilance including discussions in coming 
PSURs and in the Drug Utilization Study: Observational cohort study including a nested case-control 
study to assess rilpivirine (RPV) utilization according to the European SmPC, in line with current 
measures related to off-label use 
-  Concerning the in vitro studies on human colonic cell line, caco 2, to evaluate a potential inhibitory 
effect of tenofovir DF on absorption of phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract, the MAH is 
requested to inform authorities if new information becomes available, especially because the 
currently approved SmPC includes hypophosphatemia as a listed adverse event and the following 
statement “This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is 
not considered to be causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the absence of this 
condition.”, which might not be appropriate if an inhibitory effect of TDF on gastrointestinal 
phosphate absorption would be found. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The changes required in the RMP are either not applicable due to the withdrawal of the variation 
II/0023 or the rewording of the indication initially proposed for variation II/0021, or have already 
addressed in a subsequent RMP submission: 
•  RMP Version 5 Dated April 2013 (submitted with PSUR) 
•  RMP Version 6 dated September 2013 (submitted with PSUR)

Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the Eviplera 
SmPC warn about the risk of exacerbation of 
hepatitis in HIV-1/HBV coinfected patients 
following discontinuation of Eviplera. 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Eviplera SmPC 
warn that lactic acidosis, usually associated 
with hepatic steatosis, has been reported with 
the use of nucleoside analogues, and that 
lactic acidosis is an ADR for the TDF 
component of Eviplera. 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Eviplera SmPC 
warn that lipodystrophy has been associated 
combination antiretroviral therapy in HIV 
infected patients. 
Sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1 of the Eviplera 
SmPC recommend that genotypic resistance 
testing should guide the use of Eviplera and 
information regarding virologic failure and 
resistance, particularly in patients with a viral 
load > 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, in 
Sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the Eviplera SmPC. 
Section 4.2 of the Eviplera SmPC warns that 
Eviplera should only be used in patients with 
mild renal impairment if the benefits 
outweigh the risk and Sections 4.2 and 4.4 
advise that Eviplera is not recommended for 
use in patients with moderate and severe 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
< 50 mL/min). Further recommendations are 
provided in Section 4.4 regarding renal 
monitoring at baseline and while receiving 
Eviplera. 
Section 4.5 of the Eviplera SmPC provides 
information on interactions due to elimination 
of FTC and TDF by the kidneys and provides 
recommendations against the use of Eviplera 
with nephrotoxic medications. 
Renal ADRs associated with the TDF 
component of Eviplera are provided in Section 
4.8 of the Eviplera SmPC. 
Bone events due to proximal

a baseline viral load > 100,000 
HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, or in 
ART treatment-experienced 
patients for Eviplera; in adult 
and paediatric patients for 
RPV) (Eviplera, RPV) 
Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Eviplera SmPC 
warn that coadministration of Eviplera and 
didanosine is not recommended and there is 
a statement in Section 4.8 of the Eviplera 
SmPC regarding the risk of lactic acidosis and 
pancreatitis associated with the interaction 
between TDF and didanosine. 
Sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the Eviplera 
SmPC warn about the risk of pancreatitis 
associated with the interaction between TDF 
and didanosine. Pancreatitis is included as an 
ADR to TDF in Section 4.8 of the Eviplera 
SmPC. 
Section 4.2 of the Eviplera SmPC 
recommends that the dose is one tablet, once 
daily, and warnings in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of 
the Eviplera SmPC that Eviplera should not be 
administered concomitantly with other 
medicinal products containing FTC, RPV or 
TDF. Section 4.9 of the Eviplera SmPC 
provides guidance on patient monitoring and 
treatment in the event of overdose. 
Section 4.1 of the Eviplera SmPC clearly 
indicates the use of Eviplera in antiretroviral 
treatment-naïve adult patients with a viral 
load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. 
Sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2 of the Eviplera 
SmPC note that Eviplera is not recommended 
for use in paediatric patients due to 
insufficient data. 
Section 4.4 of the Eviplera SmPC provides 
information on the increased risk of virologic 
failure and resistance in patients with a viral 
load > 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at 
baseline. 
QT interval prolongation (RPV)  Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Eviplera SmPC 
None 
warn that RPV has been associated with 
prolongation of QTc interval at 
supratherapeutic doses and should be used 
with caution in combination with medicinal 
products with a known risk of Torsade de 
Pointes. 
Section 4.9 of the Eviplera SmPC 
recommends monitoring of ECG (QT interval) 
in the event of overdose. 
Section 4.8 of the Eviplera SmPC describes 
increased transaminases (AST and/or ALT) as 
ADRs to RPV and notes that patients 
coinfected with HBV and/or HCV are at 
increased risk of transaminase elevations.

changes in basal and ACTH-stimulated 
cortisol associated with RPV at Week 96 in 
pooled C209 and C215 studies. It is noted 
that the changes in adrenal safety 
parameters are not considered clinically 
relevant and that there were no clinical signs 
or symptoms suggestive of adrenal or 
gonadal dysfunction in adults. 
It is noted in Section 4.8 of the Eviplera 
SmPC that the safety profile of Eviplera is 
based on Week 96 pooled data from studies 
C209 and C215, in which RPV and FTC/TDF 
were studied. 
Sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2 of the Eviplera 
SmPC note that the safety and efficacy of 
Eviplera has not been studied in children < 18 
years old and therefore Eviplera is not 
recommended in this population. 
Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the Eviplera 
SmPC note that Eviplera has not been studied 
in elderly patients (> 65 years), and should 
be administered with caution in this patient 
population.  
Section 4.6 of the Eviplera SmPC provides 
information on pregnancy in humans for the 
FTC and TDF components and in animals for 
all components of Eviplera and notes that 
Eviplera should not be used in pregnancy 
unless clearly needed. 
Section 4.6 of the Eviplera SmPC provides 
information on secretion of FTC and TDF in 
human milk, whereas it is unknown whether 
RPV is excreted in human milk, and notes 
that Eviplera should not be used during

Sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the Eviplera SmPC 
note that only limited data is available for 
patients with mild renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) and so 
Eviplera should only be used if the potential 
benefits outweigh the risks in patients with 
mild renal impairment. In patients with 
moderate or severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min), Eviplera 
is not recommended. Section 5.2 of the SmPC 
also notes that RPV concentrations may be 
increased in patients with severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease, 
despite negligible renal elimination of RPV. 
Section 4.2 of the Eviplera SmPC notes that 
Eviplera is not recommended for use in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (CPT 
score C). 
Section 4.3 of the Eviplera SmPC provides a 
list of drugs contraindicated for use with 
Eviplera and Section 4.5 provides a list of 
drugs for which concurrent use is 
contraindicated, not recommended or should 
be used with caution.

2.8.  Update of the Product information   
During the procedure the MAH was requested to amend the proposed extension of indication as 
discussed in the clinical efficacy section. 
The initial proposal of the MAH for the indication in SmPC section 4.1 was: 
Section 4.1 
Eviplera is indicated for treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced adults 
who are virologically suppressed with no history of virologic failure 
Following comments from the CHMP, the MAH proposed the following updates to the PI, which CHMP 
accepted. 
Section 4.1:  
Eviplera is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
(HIV-1) infection without known mutations associated with resistance to the NNRTI class, tenofovir or 
emtricitabine, and in antiretroviral treatment naïve adult patients with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 
RNA copies/mL (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
As with other antiretroviral medicinal products, genotypic resistance testing and/or historical resistance 
data should guide the use of Eviplera (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Assessment report  
Eviplera 
EMA/CHMP/250768/201 
Page 82/89 
 
 
 
 
 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Section 4.4: 
Virologic failure and development of resistance 
Eviplera has not been evaluated in patients with previous virologic failure to any other antiretroviral 
therapy.  There is not sufficient data to justify the use in patients with prior NNRTI failure.  Eviplera 
should be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R mutation.  The list of rilpivirine-
associated mutations presented in section 5.1 should only guide the use of Eviplera in the treatment-
naïve population.  (…) 
Section 4.8 
The combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been studied as the 
component products in treatment-naïve patients (Phase III studies C209 and C215).  The single-tablet 
regimen (STR), Eviplera, has been studied in virologically suppressed patients who switched from a 
regimen containing a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (Phase III study GS-US-264-0106) or from 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Phase IIb study GS-US-264-0111).  In 
treatment-naïve patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or 
probably related to rilpivirine hydrochloride and emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were 
nausea (9%), dizziness (8%), abnormal dreams (8%), headache (6%), diarrhoea (5%) and insomnia 
(5%) (pooled data from the Phase III clinical studies C209 and C215, see section 5.1).  No new 
adverse reaction terms were identified between 48 weeks and 96 weeks.  In virologically suppressed 
patients switching to Eviplera, the most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or 
probably related to Eviplera were fatigue (3%), diarrhoea (3%), nausea (2%) and insomnia (2%) 
(48 week data from the Phase III study GS-US-264-0106).  No new adverse reactions to Eviplera were 
identified in virologically suppressed patients switching to Eviplera in clinical studies GS-US-264-0106 
and GS-US-264-0111.  The safety profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in these 
studies was consistent with the previous experience with these agents when each was administered 
with other antiretroviral agents. 
(…) 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Lipids: At 96 weeks in the pooled Phase III C209 and C215 trials of treatment-naïve patients, in the 
rilpivirine arm the mean change from baseline in total cholesterol (fasted) was 5 mg/dL, in HDL 
cholesterol (fasted) 4 mg/dL, in LDL cholesterol (fasted) 1 mg/dL, and in triglycerides 
(fasted) -7 mg/dL.  At 48 weeks in Phase III study GS-US-264-0106 of virologically suppressed 
patients switching to Eviplera from a regimen containing a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor, the 
mean change from baseline in total cholesterol (fasted) was -24 mg/dL, in HDL cholesterol 
(fasted) -2 mg/dL, in LDL cholesterol (fasted) -16 mg/dL, and in triglycerides (fasted) -64 mg/dL. 
Creatinine: The pooled data from the Phase III C209 and C215 trials of treatment-naïve patients also 
demonstrate that serum creatinine increased and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
decreased over 96 weeks of treatment with rilpivirine.  Most of this increase in creatinine and decrease 
in eGFR occurred within the first four weeks of treatment.  Over 96 weeks of treatment with rilpivirine 
mean changes of 0.1 mg/dL (range: -0.3 mg/dL to 0.6 mg/dL) for creatinine 
and -13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range: -63.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 40.1 mL/min/1.73 m2) for eGFR were 
observed.  In patients who entered the studies with mild or moderate renal impairment, the serum 
creatinine increase observed was similar to that seen in patients with normal renal function.  These

changes are not considered to be clinically relevant since they do not reflect a change in actual 
glomerular filtration rate and no subject discontinued treatment due to increases in serum 
creatinine.  Changes in creatinine and eGFR observed at 48 weeks in Phase III study GS-US-264-0106 
of virologically suppressed patients switching to Eviplera from a regimen containing a ritonavir-boosted 
protease inhibitor were consistent with those observed in studies C209 and C215.

Section 5.1: 
Resistance 
Considering all of the available in vitro data and data generated in previously untreated patients, the 
following resistance-associated mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, when present at baseline, 
may affect the activity of Eviplera: K65R, K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q, E138R, 
V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, M184I, M184V, Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I and M230L. 
These resistance-associated mutations should only guide the use of Eviplera in the treatment-naïve 
population. A negative impact by NNRTI-mutations other than those listed above (e.g. mutations 
K103N or L100I as single mutations, or in combination) cannot be excluded, since this was not studied 
in vivo in a sufficient number of patients. 
As with other antiretroviral medicinal products, resistance testing and/or historical resistance data 
should guide the use of Eviplera (see section 4.4). 
(…) 
In virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients 
Study GS-US-264-0106: Of the 469 Eviplera-treated patients [317 patients who switched to Eviplera at 
baseline (Eviplera arm) and 152 patients who switched at week 24 (Delayed Switch arm)], a total of 
7 patients were analysed for resistance development and all had genotypic and phenotypic data 
available.  Through week 24, two patients who switched to Eviplera at baseline (2 of 317 patients, 
0.6%) and one patient who maintained their ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor-based regimen 
[Stayed on Baseline Regimen (SBR) arm] (1 of 159 patients, 0.6%) developed genotypic and/or 
phenotypic resistance to study drugs.  After week 24, the HIV-1 from 2 additional patients in the 
Eviplera arm developed resistance by week 48 (total of 4 of 469 patients, 0.9%).  The remaining 
3 Eviplera-treated patients did not have emergent resistance. 
The most common emergent resistance mutations in Eviplera-treated patients were M184V/I and 
E138K in reverse transcriptase.  All patients remained susceptible to tenofovir.  Of the 24 patients 
treated with Eviplera that had the NNRTI-associated K103N substitution pre-existing at baseline in 
their HIV-1, 17 of 18 patients in the Eviplera arm and 5 of 6 patients in the SBR arm maintained 
virologic suppression after switching to Eviplera through 48 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment, 
respectively.  One patient with pre-existing K103N at baseline had virologic failure with additional 
emergent resistance by week 48. 
Study GS-US-264-0111: Through week 48, no emergent resistance developed in the 2 patients that 
failed virologically among patients that switched to Eviplera from efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil (0 of 49 patients). 
Considering all of the available in vitro and in vivo data in treatment naïve subjects, the following 
resistance-associated mutations, when present at baseline, may affect the activity of Eviplera: K65R,

K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q, E138R, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, M184I, M184V, 
Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I and M230L.  These resistance-associated mutations should only guide 
the use of Eviplera in the treatment-naïve population. 
These resistance-associated mutations were derived from in vivo data involving treatment-naïve 
subjects only and therefore cannot be used to predict the activity of Eviplera in subjects who have 
virologically failed an antiretroviral-containing regimen. 
As with other antiretroviral medicinal products resistance testing should guide the use of Eviplera (see 
section 4.4). 
(…) 
In virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients 
In study GS-US-264-0106, 4 of the 469 patients who switched from a ritonavir-boosted protease 
inhibitor-based regimen to Eviplera had HIV-1 with reduced susceptibility to at least one component of 
Eviplera through week 48.  De novo resistance to emtricitabine/lamivudine was seen in 4 cases, and 
also to rilpivirine in 2 cases, with a consequent cross resistance to efavirenz (2/2), nevirapine (2/2) 
and etravirine (1/2). 
(…) 
Virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected patients 
Study GS-US-264-0106: The efficacy and safety of switching from a ritonavir-boosted protease 
inhibitor in combination with two NRTIs to Eviplera STR was evaluated in a randomised, open-label 
study in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adults.  Patients had to be on either their first or 
second antiretroviral regimen with no history of virologic failure, have no current or past history of 
resistance to any of the three components of Eviplera, and must have been stably suppressed 
(HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months prior to screening.  Patients were randomised in a 
2:1 ratio to either switch to Eviplera at baseline (Eviplera arm, n = 317), or stay on their baseline 
antiretroviral regimen for 24 weeks (SBR arm, n = 159) before switching to Eviplera for an additional 
24 weeks (Delayed Switch arm, n = 152).  Patients had a mean age of 42 years (range 19-73), 88% 
were male, 77% were White, 17% were Black, and 17% were Hispanic/Latino.  The mean baseline 
CD4 cell count was 584 x 106 cells/L (range 42-1,484).  Randomisation was stratified by use of 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or lopinavir/ritonavir in the baseline regimen. 
Treatment outcomes through 24 weeks are presented in Table 7.

Switching to Eviplera was non-inferior in maintaining HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL when compared to 
patients who stayed on a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor in combination with two NRTIs 
[Treatment difference (95% CI): + 3.8% (-1.6% to 9.1%)]. 
Among patients in the SBR arm who maintained their baseline regimen for 24 weeks and then switched 
to Eviplera, 92% (140/152) of patients had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL after 24 weeks of Eviplera, 
consistent with the week 24 results for patients who switched to Eviplera at baseline. 
At week 48, 89% (283/317) of patients randomised to switch to Eviplera at baseline (Eviplera) had 
HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL, 3% (8/317) were considered virologic failures (HIV RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL), 
and 8% (26/317) did not have data available in the week 48 window.  Of the 26 patients without data 
available in the week 48 window, 7 patients discontinued due to adverse event or death, 16 patients 
discontinued for other reasons, and 3 patients were missing data but remained on study drug.  The 
median change in CD4 cell count at week 48 was +17 x 106 cells/L, in the on-treatment analysis. 
There were 7/317 patients (2%) in the Eviplera arm and 6/152 patients (4%) in the Delayed Switch 
arm who permanently discontinued study drug due to a treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE).  
No patients discontinued from the study due to a TEAE in the SBR arm. 
Study GS-US-264-0111: The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of switching from 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil STR to Eviplera STR was evaluated in an open-label study 
in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adults.  Patients had to have previously only received 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil as their first antiretroviral regimen for at least three 
months, and wished to switch regimens due to efavirenz intolerance.  Patients had to be stably 
suppressed for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry, have no current or past history of resistance to 
any of the three components of Eviplera, and have HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at screening.  Patients

were switched from efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil to Eviplera without a washout period.  
Among 49 patients who received at least one dose of Eviplera, 100% of patients remained suppressed 
(HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) at week 12 and week 24.  At week 48, 94% (46/49) of patients remained 
suppressed, and 4% (2/49) were considered virologic failures (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL).  One 
patient (2%) did not have data available in the week 48 window; study drug was discontinued due to a 
protocol violation (i.e. reason other than AE or death) and the last available HIV-1 RNA was 
< 50 copies/mL. 
Section 5.2 
Switching from an efavirenz-based regimen 
The efficacy data from study GS-US-264-0111 (see section 5.1) indicates that the brief period of lower 
rilpivirine exposure does not impact antiviral efficacy of Eviplera.  Due to the decline in efavirenz 
plasma levels, the inductive effect decreased and rilpivirine concentrations started to normalise.  
During the time period of declining efavirenz plasma levels and increasing rilpivirine plasma levels after 
switching, none of the patients had efavirenz or rilpivirine levels below their respective IC90 levels at 
the same time.No dose adjustment is required following the switch from an efavirenz-containing 
regimen.

What Eviplera is and what it is used for 
Eviplera is a treatment for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults aged 
18 years and over who have never been treated before with HIV medicines. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Tests may also show: 
[changed from uncommon to common] 
• 
Low platelet count (a type of blood cell involved in clotting blood) 
[deleted] 
• 
Increased cholesterol. 
In addition the MAH took the opportunity tto implement corrections and mino editorial changes in 
Annexes I & IIIB. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Data from 2 switch studies in virologically suppressed adult HIV patients, GS-US-264-0106 and GS-US-
264-0111, that evaluated efficacy and safety after switching from a PI-based regimen or Atripla 
(Efavirenz/ Emtricitabine/Tenofovir) to Eviplera once daily were submitted to support the use of this 
combination for other reasons than lack of efficacy of their initial regimen.  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Both studies demonstrated that switch to Eviplera did not result in accelerated immunological or 
virological deterioration, because most subjects maintained virologic suppression. Virologic suppression 
can be maintained in most patients, regardless whether initial HIV-RNA levels were below or above 
100,000 copies/ml before they started their PI-based or efavirenz-based regimen.  
Assessment report  
Eviplera 
EMA/CHMP/250768/201 
Page 87/89 
 
 
 
The Eviplera FDC regimen implies in some cases a significant reduction of the pill burden, which is 
thought to help keeping treatment adherence.  
The AE profile of RPV-based therapy was favourable compared to the PI-based regimen, due significant 
decreases observed in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Virologic failures (2/48 in GS-US-264-0111 and 8/317 in GS-US-264-0106) were observed in the 
switching studies and confirmed previous findings from registration studies in which non-adherence 
(i.e. low RPV plasma concentrations) could lead to an increased risk of loss of viral suppression with 
the registered dose of 25 mg RPV, and consequently to the development of RPV resistance associated 
mutations as well as concomitant NRTI mutations. In addition to non-adherence, RPV sensitive 
pharmacokinetic disturbances need to be taken into consideration. These include food intake as and 
concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors.  
Low therapeutic levels of RPV might be present for at least one week, when switching from an EFV to a 
RPV containing regimen, due the inductive effect of efavirenz. As this period is limited to < 7 days, it 
can be considered acceptable as drug concentrations of the backbone ARVs (TDF+FTC) will not be 
affected. Therefore, it is not expected to compromise the efficacy of ARV therapy. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Nervous system disorders (14.9% vs. 9.4%), psychiatric disorders (17.5% vs. 6.3%) and 
gastrointestinal disorders (27.5% vs. 16.4%) were observed more frequent in the RPV containing arm. 
However these adverse reactions are well characterised and therefore manageable by health care 
providers.  
Due to the known inhibition of the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) by rilpivirine, a decrease of 
eGFR was observed after switching from a PI based regimen to Eviplera. These changes were 
consistent with the ones observed in the RPV pivotal studies. 
Uncertainty in the knoledge about the unfavourable effects 
Psychiatric disorders were observed while switching Eviplera, however no detailed comparisons to an 
EFV containing regimen could be done, as patient satisfaction was not evaluated. 
More discontinuations occurred in the Eviplera study arm compared to the continued PI-based regimen. 
However, this effect is expected after the introduction of any new antiretroviral agent. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Most subjects maintained virologic suppression after switching from PI-based regimens or an 
efavirenz-based regimen to Eviplera. The reduction in pill burden compared to PI regimens or 
improvement of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with efavirenz, can be considered benefits which 
may increase adherence. 
Although RPV adverse reactions (psychiatric disorders, decrease of eGFR) are well characterised, these 
require management and/or adequate monitoring.

Benefit-risk balance 
The data show the benefits outweigh the risks if adherence to treatment is optimal in patients without 
resistant associated mutations emtricitabine, tenofovir and the NNRTI class. Eviplera provides a good 
and simple alternative in the ARV armamentarium for the switch for any reasons other than lack of 
efficacy of their initial regimen. 
Benefit-risk balance discussion 
Eviplera has a place in the armamentarium of anti HIV medicines in the proposed target population and 
should be used in line with resistance data, previous treatment success, individual tolerability profile 
and other clinical considerations.

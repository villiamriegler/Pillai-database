Introduction 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Olanzapine  Teva  2.5,  5,  7.5,  10,  15  and  20  mg  film  coated  tablets  and  5,  10,  15  and  20  mg 
orodispersible tablets is a generic medicinal product containing olanzapine as active substance.  
Olanzapine,  a  thienobenzodiazepine  derivative,  belongs  to  class  of  second  generation  derivative 
antipsychotic  agents,  the  so-called  atypical  antipsychotics.  Atypical  antipsychotics  have  greater 
affinity  for  serotonin  5-HT2A  receptors  then  for  dopamine  D2  receptors  and  cause  fewer 
extrapyramidal  symptoms  (EPS)  and 
to  classical 
antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol). 
improve  negative  symptoms 
in  contrast 
The efficacy and safety of olanzapine has been demonstrated in randomised, placebo-controlled and 
comparative trials in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and also as monotherapy or in 
combination with mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with 
bipolar disorder. A summary of these studies may be found in the EPAR of Zyprexa. 
The indication proposed for Olanzapine Teva is the same as authorized for the Reference medicinal 
product Zyprexa.

Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the development was to obtain orodispersible tablets containing qualitatively and 
quantitatively the same active substance as the innovator product, and exhibiting the same 
bioavailability. The dissolution tests were used as discriminating tests in order to select suitable 
formulation. The development was performed first on the 20 mg tablets. The other tablet formulations 
were derived from the 20 mg tablets. Several excipient composition and disintegrant agents were tried. 
Percentage composition is essentially similar for all strengths. Development included the following 
characteristics: dissolving time in the mouth, mouth feel, taste, hardness and appearance of the tablet. 
Bioequivalence studies were performed for the 10 mg strength and the 20 mg strength. Considering 
that all strengths have the same weight composition and identical or similar excipient composition, the 
results of the bioequivalence study may be extrapolated to other strengths, according to the Note for

Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the 
time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to 
resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

Non-Clinical aspects 
The legal basis of this application is Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended at the time of 
the opinion. 
Olanzapine  Teva  film-coated  and  orodispersible  tablets  have  the  same  qualitative  and  quantitative 
composition  in  active  substance  (olanzapine)  and  the  same  pharmaceutical  forms  as  their  respective 
reference  products  Zyprexa  and  Zyprexa  Velotab.  Pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and 
toxicological  properties  of  olanzapine  are  well  characterised.  The  excipients  used  in  the  drug 
formulation  are  conventional,  well  known  and  broadly  used  in  other  medicinal  products.  Declared 
impurities in amounts present in both formulations do not require additional safety studies. No further 
studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided. The overview was 
based on literature review, and this was considered appropriate. It is expected that the generic product 
Olanzapine TEVA will not affect the environmental load already known for olanzapine. As a result, an 
Environmental Risk Assessment is deemed not necessary.

Clinical Aspects  
Introduction 
The  rapporteur’s  assessment  addressed  pharmacokinetic  data  in  respect  of  bioequivalence  studies. 
Three  single  dose  bioequivalence  studies  (Study  2006-1152,  Study  B0507  and Study A37552) were 
submitted to support this application. 
GCP aspects 
The clinical bioequivalence studies were performed at three different clinical research organisations.  
GCP and GLP aspects were provided.  
Exemption 
Film-coated tablets: 
The 5, 7.5, 15, and the 20 mg tablets are dose-proportional with the 10 mg tablet. The 2.5 mg tablet 
have  a  similar  composition  in  terms  of  excipients  as  compared  to  the  5  mg  tablet.  The  tablets  were 
manufactured  by  the  same  manufacturing  process.  Dissolution  tests  at  pH  1,  4.5  and  6.8  showed 
comparable dissolution. In addition, olanzapine showed linear pharmacokinetics. Therefore the results 
obtained for the 10 mg tablet were extrapolated to the 2.5, 5, 7.5, 15 and 20 mg tablets.  
Orodispersible tablets: 
The 5 and the 15 mg orodispersible tablets have a similar excipients composition compared to the 10 
and 20 mg orodispersible tablets.The tablets were manufactured by the same manufacturing process. 
Dissolution tests at pH 1, 4.5 and 6.8 showed comparable dissolution. In addition, olanzapine showed 
linear  pharmacokinetics.  Therefore  the  results  obtained  for  the  10  and  20  mg  orodispersible  tablets 
were extrapolated to the 5, and 15 mg tablets.  
Extrapolation  of  the  results  obtained  for  the  10  mg  film-coated  tablet  to  the  other  strengths  was 
acceptable.  The  bioequivalence  testing  carried  out  on  the  10  mg  orodispersible  tablet  can  be 
extrapolated  to  the  5  mg  tablet.  The  bioequivalence  testing  carried  out  on  the  10mg  and  20  mg 
orodispersible  tablets  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  15  mg  strength  as  the  10  and  20  mg  strength 
encompass the 15 mg strength. 
Extrapolation of the results obtained for the 10 and 20 mg orodispersible tablets to the other strengths 
was also acceptable.  
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted 3 single dose bioequivalence studies, one with 
the  10  mg  film-coated  tablets,  one  with  the  10  mg  orodispersible  tablets,  and  one  with  the  20  mg 
orodispersible  tablets:  Study  2006-1152  (10  mg  film-coated  tablet)  which  was  a  single-dose,  2-way 
cross-over  study;  Study  B0507  (10  mg  orodispersible  tablet)  which  was  a  single-dose,  2-way  cross-
over  study;  Study  A37552  (20  mg  orodispersible  tablet)  which  was  a  single-dose,  3-way  cross-over 
study.

(1) 
This was a single-dose, 2-way cross-over study. Twenty-five non-smokers healthy subjects, 21 males 
and 4 females, aged 21 - 53 years, were included in this study. Each subject received a single dose (1 x 
10 mg tablet) of both the test and reference olanzapine formulations. The tablets were administered in 
solid form with 240 ml water after overnight fasting. Fasting was continued for 4 hrs after dosing. For 
each subject there were 2 dosing periods, separated by a washout period of 14 days. Blood samples 
were taken pre-dose and up to 144 hours post administration.

POPULATION(S) STUDIED   
(3) 
Twenty-eight subjects were to be included in this study, however three subjects were not qualified to 
start the study. Twenty-five healthy subjects, twenty-one males and four females, aged 21 - 53 years, 
all non-smokers, were thus included in this study. All subjects completed the study entirely, and were 
included in the analysis. 
ANALYTICAL METHODS   
(4) 
Plasma samples were analysed using LC-MS/MS. The method was properly validated and a validation 
report was provided.. The results of the method validation and the bio-analytical analysis were in line 
with each other.  
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES  
(5) 
Olanzapine AUC(0-inf.) and AUC(0-t) were calculated by linear trapezoidal method. Cmax and tmax, were 
derived  directly  from  concentration-time-curve.  Elimination  rate  constant  was  estimated  from  the 
slope  of  the  regression  line  using  the  terminal  data  points  of  the  semi-logarithmic  plasma 
concentration - time curve. T½ was calculated as 0.693/kel. 
STATISTICAL METHODS   
(6) 
The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ratio  of  test  formulation  over  the  reference  formulation  were 
calculated  for  natural  logarithm-transformed  Cmax,  AUC(0-t),  and  AUC(0-inf)  by  ANOVA.  Treatment, 
period, sequence, and subjects within sequence were included into the ANOVA. Bioequivalence was 
declared  when  the  90%  CI of the ratio of the means (Test/Reference) for olanzapine AUC and Cmax 
was within 80-125% range. 
The  AUC0-inf,  AUCo-t,  and  Cmax  of  test  and  reference  were  also  tested  for  bioequivalence  by  the 
assessor using a different system. The least square means and the 90% CI of the (test/reference) ratios 
were  calculated  by  ANOVA  GLM  procedure  with  period,  treatment  (test  or  reference)  and  subject 
within  sequence  as  independent  variables.  The  values  were  logarithmically  transformed  before 
ANOVA analysis. 
Results 
• 
The pharmacokinetic variables of olanzapine of the test and reference product are shown in Table 1. 
All  pre-dose  samples  were  zero  in  period  1,  but  in  period  2,  five  subjects  had  pre-dose  olanzapine 
concentrations of less than 0.2 ng/ml, which was less than 1.5% of the maximal plasma concentration.

Methods 
STUDY DESIGN  
This was a single-dose, 2-way cross-over study. Twenty-eight healthy non-smoker subjects, 21 males 
and 7 females, aged 18 - 50 years, were included in this study. Each subject received a single dose (1 x 
10  mg  orodispersible  tablet)  of  both  the  test  and  reference  olanzapine  formulations  after  overnight 
fasting. The tablet was placed on the subject’s tongue to be dissolved. After 30 seconds, and after a 
mouth check, the subject should drink 240 ml water. Fasting was continued for 4 hrs after dosing. For 
each subject there were 2 dosing periods, separated by a washout period of 21 days. 
Blood samples were taken pre-dose and up to 168 hours post administration. 
TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCTS   
Olanzapine 10 mg orodispersible tablets (Teva, Hungary) were compared to Zyprexa Velotab 10 mg 
tablets.  
POPULATION(S) STUDIED   
Twenty-eigth  healthy  subjects,  twenty-one  males  and  seven  females,  aged  18  -  50  years,  all  non-
smokers, were included in this study.  One subject (no.10) was withdrawn prior to Period II because of 
adverse events (i.e. pain at right shoulder and drowsiness), and one subject (no. 22) withdrew prior to 
Period II for personal reasons. Twenty-six subjects completed the study entirely, and were included in 
the analysis. 
ANALYTICAL METHODS   
Plasma  samples  were  analysed  for  olanzapine  using  LC-MS/MS.  The  method  was  validated  and  a 
validation report was provided.

•  Methods 
STUDY DESIGN  
This was a single-dose, 3-way cross-over study. Thirty healthy male non-smoker subjects, aged 21 - 
44 years, were included in this study, of which 27 completed the study. Each subject received a single 
dose (1 x 20 mg tablet) of both the test (orodispersible tablet) and reference olanzapine formulations 
(Reference: orodispersible tablet and film coated tablet). The orodispersible tablet were administered 
without  water,  while  the  film  coated  tablet  was  administered  in  solid  form  with  240  ml  water.  All 
formulations were administered after overnight fasting. Fasting was continued for 4 hrs after dosing. 
For  each  subject  there  were  3  dosing  periods,  separated  by  a  washout  period  of  21  days.  Blood 
samples were taken pre-dose and up to 144 hours post administration. 
TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCTS   
Olanzapine 20 mg orodispersible tablets (Teva, Hungary) were compared to Zyprexa Velotab 20 mg 
orodispersible tablets, and to Zyprexa 20 mg film coated tablets.  
POPULATION(S) STUDIED   
Thirty healthy male subjects, aged 21 - 44 years, all non-smokers, were included in this study. Three 
subjects were excluded. Subject 7 was excluded, because of vomiting in Period I within 5 hours after 
administration of the tablet, subject 19 withdrew prior to Period II for personal reasons, and subject 26 
was  withdrawn  during  Period  I  because  of  adverse  events  (e.g.  hypotension,  dizziness  and  palor). 
Subject 24 withdrew prior to Period III for personal reasons, but data obtained in Period I and II were 
used in the statistical analysis. Thus, twenty-six subjects completed the study entirely, while twenty-
seven subjects completed Period I and II.

ANALYTICAL METHODS   
Plasma  samples  were  analysed  for  olanzapine  using  LC-MS/MS.  The  method  was  validated  and  a 
validation report was provided. 
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES  
Olanzapine AUC(0-inf.) and AUC(0-t) were calculated by linear trapezoidal method. Cmax and tmax, were 
derived  directly  from  concentration-time-curve.  Elimination  rate  constant  was  estimated  from  the 
slope  of  the  regression  line  using  the  terminal  data  points  of  the  semi-logarithmic  plasma 
concentration - time curve. T½ was calculated as 0.693/kel. 
STATISTICAL METHODS   
The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ratio  of  test  formulation  over  the  reference  formulation  were 
calculated  for  natural  logarithm-transformed  Cmax,  AUC(0-t),  and  AUC(0-inf)  by  ANOVA.  Treatment, 
period,  sequence,  and  subjects  within  sequence  were  included  by  the  applicant  into  the  ANOVA. 
Bioequivalence  was  declared  when  the  90%  CI  of  the  ratio  of  the  means  (Test/Reference)  for 
olanzapine AUC and Cmax was within 80-125% range. 
The AUC0-inf, AUC0-t, and Cmax of test and reference were also tested by assessor for bioequivalence 
using  a  different  system.  The  least  square  means  and  the  90%  CI  of  the  (test/reference)  ratios  were 
calculated  by  ANOVA GLM procedure with period, treatment (test or reference) and subject within 
sequence  as  independent  variables.  The  values  were  logarithmically  transformed  before  ANOVA 
analysis. 
Results 
• 
The pharmacokinetic variables of olanzapine of the test and reference products are shown in Table 5. 
All pre-dose samples were zero in period 1 and 2, but in period 3, 1 subject had pre-dose olanzapine 
concentrations of less than 0.51 ng/ml, which was less than 3% of the maximal plasma concentration.

Discussion on clinical aspects 
• 
The  efficacy,  safety  and  clinical  pharmacology  of  the  active  ingredient  olanzapine  are  already  well-
established  and  documented  for  the  original  medicinal  products  Zyprexa  and  Zyprexa  Velotab.  The 
design  of  the  submitted  bioequivalence  studies  is  considered  adequate  and  the  data  of  these  studies 
sufficiently  demonstrate  that  the  tested  formulations  intended  for  marketing  are  bioequivalent  to  the 
innovator products.  
Based  on  the  submitted  bioequivalence  studies  the  Olanzapine  Teva  10  mg  film  coated  tablet  is 
considered  bioequivalent  with  the  Zyprexa  10  mg  film-coated  tablet,  the  Olanzapine  Teva  10  mg 
orodispersible  tablet  is  considered  bioequivalent  with  the  Zyprexa  Velotab  10  mg  orodispersible 
tablet,  and  the  Olanzapine  Teva  20  mg  orodispersible  tablet  is  considered  bioequivalent  with  the 
Zyprexa Velotab 20 mg orodispersible tablet and the Zyprexa 20 mg  tablet. The orodispersible tablets 
can be taken with or without water, because in both cases bioequivalence to the reference product has 
been proven by the applicant. The results obtained for the 10 mg film coated tablet and the 10 and 20 
mg orodispersible tablets can be extrapolated to the other strengths.  
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. Olanzapine Teva has not been marketed in any country. 
5. 
Pharmacovigilance  
•  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before 
the product is placed on the market. The company should ensure that the pharmacovigilance activities 
are in line with the current safety measures applied to the reference medicinal product.

A  Risk  Management  Plan  has  not  been  submitted.  Since  the  application  concerns  a  generic  of 
reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring  additional  risk  minimization 
activities have been identified, a Risk Management Plan is not required. 
(cid:131)  PSUR 
The  PSUR  submission  schedule  for  Olanzapine  Teva  film-coated  tablets  and  orodispersible  tablets 
should follow PSURs submission schedule for the reference medicinal product. 
User consultation 
• 
The results of user consultation provided indicates that the Package leaflet is well structured and 
organized, easy to understand and written in a comprehensible manner. The test shows that the leaflet 
is readable in patients /users are able to act upon the information that it contains. 
6. 
Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
The application contains adequate quality, non clinical data and the bioequivalence has been shown. A 
benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.  
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen 
reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
Recommendation 
Olanzapine is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia. Olanzapine is effective in maintaining the 
clinical  improvement  during  continuation  therapy  in  patients  who  have  shown  an  initial  treatment 
response. Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode. In patients 
whose manic episode has responded to olanzapine treatment, olanzapine is indicated for the prevention 
of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder. 
Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk 
ratio  of  Olanzapine  Teva  in  the  above  mentioned  indication  was  favourable  and  therefore 
recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Idelvion (Recombinant Fusion Protein Linking 
Coagulation Factor IX with Albumin(rIX-FP) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Recombinant Fusion Protein 
Linking Coagulation Factor IX with Albumin (rIX-FP) Idelvion . The RMP details important 
risks of Idelvion, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be 
obtained about Idelvion's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Idelvion's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Idelvion should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Idelvion should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Idelvion's RMP. 
I.
The medicine and what it is used for
Idelvion is authorized for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with hemophilia 
B (congenital factor IX deficiency). (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
Albutrepenonacog alfa as the active substance and it is given by injection for intravenous use. 
Further information about the evaluation of Idelvion’s benefits can be found in Idelvion’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage link to the EPAR summary landing page: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/idelvion
II.
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Idelvion, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Idelvion's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including in PSUR assessments, so that immediate action can be 
taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Idelvion is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Idelvion are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Idelvion. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
Published literature, clinical studies, and post-marketing data. Across the 
SmPCs of the product class of FIX therapies, Hypersensitivity is rarely 
documented. With use of some FIX products, cases of hypersensitivity 
have progressed and were associated with anaphylaxis. 
People with known hypersensitivity to Idelvion or its excipients, 
including people with allergies to hamster proteins. General factors that 
increase the likelihood of Type 1 hypersensitivity include repeated 
exposure to the medicinal product and a history of hypersensitivity to a 
medicinal product of the same class.

hypersensitivity, discontinuation of treatment, and contacting the

Important identified risk - Development of inhibitors to factor IX 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
Published literature, clinical studies, and post-marketing data. 
The main risk associated with FIX replacement therapy, whether based 
on plasma derived or recombinant products, is the development of 
inhibitors (ie, neutralizing antibodies) against FIX, rendering treatment 
with antihemophilic factors less effective or ineffective. It is noted that 
the incidence of inhibitors in patients following administration of factor 
IX  is  less  common  compared  to  the  incidence  found  in  hemophilia  A 
patients. Inhibitors to factor IX have been demonstrated in approximately 
1.5 to 5% of patients with severe hemophilia B.  
The risk factors for factor IX inhibitor formation have not been 
extensively studied, in part due to the relative rarity of the event. 
Inhibitor development is generally associated with the absence of factor 
IX due to major deletions or nonsense mutations of the factor IX gene. 
Individuals with small deletions or missense mutations have a lower 
risk of inhibitor formation. 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
SmPC section 4.8  
SmPC section 4.4 where advice is given on monitoring for development 
of neutralizing antibodies, mention of additional risk factors and initial 
administration of Idelvion should be done by trained physician and 
under medical observation.

of inhibitors against factor IX.  
The objective of the surgery substudy is to evaluate the efficacy of rIX-FP in the prevention 
and control of bleeding in subjects with severe hemophilia B during surgical procedures. 
European Haemophilia Safety Surveillance (EUHASS)  
Purpose of the study:  
CSL Behring participates in this ongoing pharmacovigilance program monitoring the safety 
of treatments for people with inherited bleeding disorders in Europe to obtain long-term post-
marketing safety data (including hypersensitivity and inhibitor development).

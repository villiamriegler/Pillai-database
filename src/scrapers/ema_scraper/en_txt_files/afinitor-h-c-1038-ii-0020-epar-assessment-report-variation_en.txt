Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/105/2011 on the granting of a class waiver for all medicinal products for the treatment of breast 
carcinoma.  
Scientific Advice 
The MAH did not seek scientific advice for the proposed new indication at the CHMP. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Breast cancer is the most common form of malignancy in women, accounting globally for 23% of all 
cancers in women and 14% of cancer deaths1. Of the estimated 12.7 million new cancer cases 
worldwide in 2008, 1.38 million were estimated to be new cases of breast cancer1,2 . In Europe, the 
estimated incidence of breast cancer in 2008 was 424,800 while the estimated deaths related to breast 
cancer were 128,700.  
A number of breast carcinomas are dependent for their proliferation on 17 beta-oestradiol (E2), which 
can be synthesized from androstenedione (Δ4A) through the action of aromatase, an enzyme of the 
cytochrome P450 superfamily. In premenopausal women, the expression of aromatase is found in the 
granulosa cells of ovarian follicles while in post-menopausal women, the expression of aromatase is in 
general derived from non-glandular tissue, such as subcutaneous fat3. The concentration of oestradiol 
decreases to levels of about 7pg/ml from a baseline of 110 pg/ml at menopause. In breast carcinoma 
tissue of post-menopausal women, the concentration of oestradiol is approximately 10 fold the 
concentration found in plasma4 . Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs; letrozole and anastrozole) 
are generally the treatment of choice for postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor (ER+) 
positive breast cancer5,6,7,8. Some patients do not respond to first-line endocrine therapy and patients
who initially respond to treatment will eventually relapse. Following recurrence or progression on 
letrozole or anastrozole, the most commonly subsequent treatment includes exemestane and 
fulvestrant. In clinical practice, the use of chemotherapy is usually reserved for patients with high 
tumour burden or for patients that demonstrate an aggressive disease progression or symptomatic 
visceral disease.  
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is activated in a broad range of cancers, including breast cancers. The 
p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), a substrate of mTORC1, (S6K1), directly phosphorylates the activation 
domain AF-1 of the ER, which leads to ligand-independent receptor activation9,10.  The activation of 
the mTOR pathway is thought to be a driving factor for endocrine resistance in breast cancer. The 
evidence for this proposed mechanism of resistance is based on the finding that PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
pathway is constitutively activated in aromatase inhibitor (AI)-resistant and long-term oestrogen 
deprived breast cancer cells11,12,13. Coadministration of everolimus and AI in breast cancer cells was 
found to reverse resistance in cells that had become AI-resistant14. Afinitor (everolimus), a derivative 
of rapamycin, acts as an inhibitor of mTOR which regulates multiple downstream pathways from PI3
K 
such as protein synthesis, proliferation (including angiogenesis) and
 cell survival.   
Afinitor was granted a marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) in 2009 for the treatment of 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) whose disease has progressed on or after treatment

with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy. In August 2011 Afinitor was granted 
an extension of indication for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well- or moderately-
differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NET) of pancreatic origin in adults with progressive disease.  
In this application, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for the following extension of 
indication for Afinitor: 
“Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, in 
combination with an aromatase inhibitor, in postmenopausal women previously treated with endocrine 
therapy.”  
The final indication approved by the CHMP is as follows: 
"Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced 
breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic 
visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor" 
Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 and of the PL. 
Additional minor editorial changes to the SmPC were also proposed. 
2.2.  Quality  aspects 
No new data related to the pharmaceutical quality were submitted with this variation application, which 
is considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH provided a non-clinical overview containing bibliographical references based on published 
literature and non-clinical studies investigating the effect of everolimus on breast cancer models. The 
non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies submitted were not performed in accordance with GLP. The 
environmental toxicity studies were performed in accordance with GLP. 
The MAH provided 14 new primary pharmacodynamic studies and an updated ERA to support the 
application of the new indication.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies – everolimus in breast cancer models 
In vitro models 
Everolimus was shown to inhibit a panel of cell lines, including breast cancer cell lines (Report RD-
2002-03223, Report RD-2006-02213). Sensitive cell lines to everolimus inhibitor activity had IC50 
values <1µM. The results of the anti-proliferative in vitro studies are shown in Table 1.

Page 5/79
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1: 
Antiproliferative IC50 for RAD001 on human cell lines 
In vivo models 
Everolimus was investigated in human breast cancer cell lines in vivo. The anti-tumour efficacy of 
everolimus was compared to other suppressors of cytokine signalling (cyclophosphamide, docorubicin, 
docetaxel, capecitabine) in a panel of 6 breast cancer xenograft models established after direct 
transplantation of patients’ tumours into nude mice (Report RD-2011-50492). The tumour growth 
inhibition of the oestrogen-dependent breast cancer model HBCx-3 (XTS-181) had a mean tumour 
volume regression of -13.5% (Figure 1).

EMA/CHMP/438808/2012  
Page 6/79
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The anti-proliferative effect of everolimus was evaluated in vitro using a panel of molecularly 
characterized cell lines for different gene mutations or amplifications. The cell lines were divided into 
three groups based on results of a growth inhibition by everolimus: sensitive (inhibition 80% or greater 
at 1 µM and an IC50 > 50 nM), intermediate, and resistant cell lines. The most sensitive cell lines were 
enriched for the ER+ and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplified subtypes. The 
effect of tumour growth inhibition of everolimus in oestrogen-dependent breast cancer models was 
further verified in four additional cell lines that were oestrogen receptor positive, namely ZR75-1 (ER+, 
PTENmut; intermediate), UACC812 (ER+, HER+; resistant), MDA361 (ER+, HER2+; resistant), KPL-1 
(ER+, PTENwt; resistant) in a xenograft cancer model (Report RD-2011-50447). The results are shown 
in Figure 2. 
Figure 2: 
Effect of everolimus on tumour volume 
The tumour growth inhibition of everolimus was further tested in the MCF-7 human breast carcinoma 
nude mouse xenograft model (Study RD-2011-50270). Mice were treated orally with everolimus and 
compared to a pan-PI3K inhibitor, an inhibitor for PI3K/mTOR, and an inhibitor that specifically inhibits 
the PIK3CA gene product, the p110alpha isoform of the PI3K catalytic subunit. All tested drugs 
exhibited dose-dependent activities.  
Primary pharmacodynamics studies – everolimus in combination with 
aromatase inhibitors 
In vitro studies 
The effect of everolimus/letrozole combinations have been studied in several experiments, e.g. on the 
proliferation of aromatase-expressing MCF7/Aro cells (Report RD-2003-02908). The results of a 
proliferation assay are shown in Table 2.

Table 2: 
Combination effects of everolimus and letrozole 
The effect of everolimus in combination with exemestane was studied in vitro in a breast carcinoma cell 
line that was oestrogen-dependent (Study RD-2011-50532). The data are shown in Figure 3.

Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH submitted an ERA report. A summary of the main results is shown in Table 3. The calculated 
log K ow was 4.0. The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) based on a daily dose of 10 mg was 
0.05 μg/L, which exceeds the trigger value of 0.01 μg/L. A base-data set was submitted for Phase II 
studies with the exception for the transformation in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308) which was 
listed as on-going. Everolimus showed high chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms with growth of 
Daphnia magna being the most sensitive end-point. Everolimus showed low adsorption to sewage 
treatment plant sludge, and transfer to terrestrial compartments via spreading of sewage sludge was 
not expected. All other Phase II Tier A PEC/PNEC quotients were below the trigger for Phase II Tier B 
assessment.

The pharmacology of everolimus was investigated in in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. 
Everolimus was shown to exhibit anti-proliferative activity and anti-tumour activity in breast cance
r 
models.  In  oestrogen-dependent (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-
amplified breast cancer cell lines, administration of everolimus alone displayed anti-proliferative 
activity. Administration of everolimus as a single agent also showed an anti-tumour effect in breas
t 
cancer xenograft models. In an in vitro oestrogen-dependent breast cancer model, everolimus in 
combination with exemestane showed an additive/synergistic inhibition of androstenedione (Δ4A) 
driven MCF7/Aro cell proliferation compared to everolimus as single agent. The non-clinical data 
provided in the a
pplication were considered acceptable to support the proposed new indication in 
breast cancer.  
The lack of studies on safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicit
y 
and reproduction toxicity was considered acceptable as the non-clinica
l data for these studies for 
everolimus and exemestane are well known in the oncology setting.  
Everolimus was considered to pose no significant risk to surface waters, sewage treatment plants a
nd 
groundwater. However, som
e pending issues related to the environmental risk assessment will be 
addressed as noted below.  
Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies submitted were considered adequate and acceptable f
or the assessment of 
non-clinical aspects for the product everolimus in the new clinical indication.

The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
1.  The applicant is asked to submit information on the chemical structure of transformation product 
M4 cited in the transformation study with everolimus in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308), by 
31st May 2013  
2.  The applicant is asked to provide a fully updated ERA addressing all outstanding concerns and 
including all three remaining studies, i.e. the study with the sediment-dwelling larvae of the midge 
species Chironomus riparius (OECD 218), the additional algae study (OECD 201) and the planned 
fish bioconcentration study (OECD 305) by 31st May 2013. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support the indication of Afinitor for the oestrogen-receptor positive (ER+) advanced breast cancer, 
clinical pharmacology data from a pivotal clinical research study (Study Y2301) and an updated report 
of the Phase II study C2222 (Study C2222 update) were included in the submission.

Special populations – Metastatic Breast Cancer patients 
The CSR for Study C2222 was included in the original submission for the RCC indication. This was a 
phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in postmenopausal women patients with 
ER+ early breast cancer. Patients were randomised to receive daily administration of either everolimus 
10 mg + letrozole 2.5 mg or placebo + letrozole 2.5 mg for 4 months prior to undergoing breast 
conserving surgery or mastectomy. The original report included a total of 270 patients. The updated 
report was based on 251 patients and summarized the results of the end of Stage I analysis, excluding 
the data for 19 patients enrolled at site 066 due to GCP-related findings at this specific center. These 
patients were excluded because the site was not able to provide adequate documentation showing that 
the patients recruited had met the study entry criteria.  
Trough blood levels 
Pre-dose (Cmin) and 2-hour post-dose (C2h) blood samples for concentration determination of 
everolimus in blood and exemestane in plasma were collected in up to 88 patients at steady states at 
Visit 4 in study Y2301. Blood samples for concentration determination of oestradiol were also collected 
in these patients at baseline and at Visit 4 to evaluate the indirect effect of coadministration of 
everolimus on the oestradiol level. 
Everolimus is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a median time to peak blood levels 
(Tmax) of 1-2 hours post dose. Tmax of exemestane in women with breast cancer was 1.2 hours 
compared to 2.9 hours in healthy women.  
The mean everolimus Cmin at steady-state was 16.0 ± 9.4 ng/mL (Table 4). The mean C2h of 
46.5 ± 18.0 ng/mL observed in this study was within the range of Cmax means observed in previous 
everolimus studies with the everolimus 10-mg daily dose [59.7 ± 16.9 ng/mL (amended Study C2102 
CP report), 76.7 ± 39.3 ng/mL (Study C2240), 56.3 ± 11.8 ng/mL (Study C2324), and 74.8 ± 33.6 
ng/mL (Study C2325)]. 
Table 4: 
Everolimus blood concentrations [ng/ml] at week 4 – Study Y2301 
Everolimus trough concentrations were evaluated in Study C2222. The results are shown in Table 5. 
The trough concentrations varied from a mean of 25.2 ng/mL at Visit 3 to 9.3 ng/mL at Visit 8.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Everolimus is mainly metabolised by the cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme in the liver and to some 
extent in the intestinal wall and exemestane is metabolised by CYP3A4 and aldoketoreductases. Thus, 
the effect of everolimus on the metabolism of examestane was investigated in Study Y2301. Average 
exemestane Cmin and C2h were 45% and 71% higher, respectively, when co-administered with 
everolimus (Table 8).

Mechanism of action 
No studies were submitted addressing the mechanism of action in breast cancer. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
 Exposure-efficacy relationship 
According to the applicant, in the absence of sufficient concentration data to perform exposure-
response analyses, the effect of everolimus exposure on tumour regression could not be directly 
ascertained in study Y2301.  An analysis was performed to assess the potential impact of dose 
reductions and interruptions of everolimus by exploring the antitumour activity of patients who 
received time-averaged doses of <7.5 mg and those who received 7.5 mg. 
These two time-averaged dose groups were selected to represent and compare the efficacy response in 
patients with a longer duration of dose reduction versus those with an occasional dose 
reduction/interruption. Patients in the everolimus plus exemestane arm with time-averaged dose to 
event of ≥ 7.5 mg had a 24.9% best percentage reduction in target lesion in comparison to a 17.4% 
reduction for patients with a time-averaged dose < 7.5 mg. Results of the Cox proportional hazard 
model showed that, in comparison to the placebo plus exemestane arm, patients in the everolimus 
plus exemestane arm with a time-averaged everolimus dose of < 7.5 mg/day had a PFS HR of 0.37 
(95% CI: 0.27, 0.51) and patients with a time-averaged everolimus dose ≥ 7.5 mg/day had a PFS HR 
of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.58).

Oestradiol exposure 
Oestradiol concentrations were measured in the study as a biomarker for the activity of exemestane. 
The results are presented in Table 10.

Y2301 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Investigation of the effect of exemestane on everolimus plasma concentrations appeared to show no 
significant effects on the exposure of everolimus as the mean everolimus Cmin or C2h observed in 
Study Y2301 were consistent with corresponding values observed in previous trials with everolimus 10-
mg daily dose. Everolimus, on the other hand, was shown to increase plasma concentrations of 
exemestane by 45-71%. It is considered that the increase in exemestane plasma concentrations will 
not have an impact on the safety and efficacy. A new paragraph reflecting the findings was introduced 
in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The observed differences in tumour regression data in patients who received time-averaged doses of 
< 7.5 mg and those who received ≥ 7.5 mg were small and were not considered to be of clinical 
significance. Thus, the effective dose modification guideline implemented in the study protocol to 
manage adverse reactions did not compromise the efficacy data.   
There was no statistical difference between everolimus Cmin and the change in baseline oestradiol 
concentration from baseline to week 4. In addition, no major reducing effect of exemestane on 
estradiol levels was observed. These findings may reflect the fact that estradiol levels had already been 
suppressed by the last prior therapy which was a NSAI in 74% of study patients and 64% of patients 
with PK sampling and no further decrease in estradiaol could be measured.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data from studies Y2301 and updated report for study C2222 submitted by 
the applicant were adequate for the assessment of everolimus plus examestane pharmacology in the 
proposed indication. No major effect of exemestane on everolimus exposure is expected.  Everolimus 
was shown to increase plasma concentrations of exemestane by 45-71%. Thus the section 4.5 of the 
SmPC has been updated as follows:  
“Co-administration of everolimus and exemestane increased exemestane Cmin and C2h by 45% and 
64%, respectively. However, the corresponding oestradiol levels at steady state (4 weeks) were not 
different between the two treatment arms. No increase in adverse events related to exemestane was 
observed in patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer receiving the 
combination. The increase in exemestane levels is unlikely to have an impact on efficacy or safety.” 
The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address the issues related to 
pharmacology: 
– 
The MAH should commit to further investigate exposure-response relationships for PFS and OS in 
future studies, with a due date of March 31st 2015. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response study was submitted. 
The selection of the 10-mg continuous daily dose for everolimus was based on a pharmacodynamic 
model15  which was supported by results from a clinical pharmacodynamic study in patients with solid 
tumours16 and an investigator-initiated, randomised Phase-II study17 where results showed that the 
10-mg daily dose was more efficacious and produced a more sustained suppression of mTOR activity 
than weekly dosing. 
Additionally, the 10-mg daily dose was favoured over a 5-mg dose in a Phase-I study combining 
everolimus with letrozole in patients with advanced breast cancer18. Further supportive evidence was 
obtained from a 270-patient, randomised Phase-II trial comparing combination therapy with letrozole 
and everolimus 10 mg daily versus letrozole and placebo as neoadjuvant treatment of 16 weeks 
duration in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer (Study C2222). Results demonstrated 
that the response rate by clinical palpation for patients receiving letrozole plus everolimus was higher 
than that for letrozole plus placebo (68.1% versus 59.1%, respectively)19.

Treatments 
Patients in the everolimus and exemestane treatment arm were administered in accordance with a 
10-mg oral daily dosing regimen (two 5-mg tablets) in conjunction with exemestane 25 mg orally 
daily. The placebo group received matching placebo in conjunction with exemestane 25 mg orally daily. 
Duration of both treatments was not limited. Treatment should continue until objective tumour 
progression was determined by the local radiologist (using RECIST), unacceptable toxicity, death, or 
discontinuation from the study for any other reason. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the combination treatment of everolimus and exemestane to 
exemestane alone with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) in postmenopausal women with 
oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer that is refractory to non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors 
(NSAIs).  
The main secondary objective was to compare overall survival (OS) between the two treatment arms. 
Other secondary objectives were: 
• 
to evaluate the two treatment arms with respect to 
– 
– 
overall response rate (ORR), 
time to deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Group performance status (ECOG PS),

• 
• 
to summarise time to response and duration of response in the two treatment arms;  
to characterise in a subgroup of patients the pharmacokinetics (PK) of everolimus (Cmin, C2h) 
when administered in combination with exemestane;  
• 
to compare the two treatment arms with respect to pre-dose concentration (Cmin) and 
concentration at 2 hours post-dose (C2h) of exemestane and to compare in a subgroup of patients 
the two treatment arms with respect to oestradiol (E2) changes from baseline. 
The trial included a biomarker component as an exploratory objective, which included: 
• Bone turnover: BSAP, P1NP, and CTX (reported in this submission) 
• Angiogenesis: vascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor 
• Immunohistochemistry: phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), Cyclin D1, Ki-67, and p53 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 based on local (investigator) radiology review. PFS was defined 
as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of the first documented progression or death 
due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, PFS was to be censored at the date of last 
adequate tumour assessment. 
Secondary Endpoints 
The main secondary endpoint was overall survival. OS was defined as the time from date of 
randomisation to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient was not known to have died, survival 
was to be censored at the last date of contact. 
Other secondary endpoints were clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall response rate (ORR), time to 
overall response, and duration of overall response, time to deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Group 
performance status (ECOG PS) and Quality of life (QoL).  Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as the 
proportion of patients whose best overall response was either complete response (CR), a partial 
response (PR) or stable disease lasting for at least 24 weeks. ORR was defined as the proportion of 
patients whose best overall response is either CR or PR according to RECIST. Time to overall response 
(CR or PR) was the time between date of randomisation and first documented response (CR or PR) 
according to RECIST. Duration of overall response (DoR) applies only to patients whose best overall 
response was CR or PR. The start date is the date of first documented response (CR or PR) and the end 
date is the date of event defined as first documented progression of disease or death due to underlying 
cancer. 
ECOG PS categories were defined according to the Table 11.

Safety was to be assessed by the CTCAE, version 3.0. 
Incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, changes from baseline in vital signs and 
laboratory results were to be reported. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, along with breast cancer patients’ specific module (BR23) was 
used to collect QoL data. The EORTC scoring manual was be used to transform the raw scores into the 
domain scores (global heath, functional scales, symptom scales/items). 
Sample size 
For the sample size it was estimated that the median duration of PFS in the control group (placebo plus 
exemestane) would be 3.7 months20 and combination treatment with everolimus and exemestane 
would result in a 26% reduction in the hazard rate (corresponding to a 35% increase in the median 
PFS to 5 months). A total of 528 PFS events were required to detect a HR of 0.74 with 90% power 
using a log-rank test and a 2-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design with an O’Brien-Fleming type 
boundary at a one-sided cumulative 2.5% level of significance. Assuming recruitment over an 18-
month period and that 10% of the patients would be lost to follow-up or would withdraw consent, and 
a 2:1 randomisation ratio in favour of the combination arm, a total of 705 patients were to be 
randomised. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive treatment with either everolimus plus exemestane 
or placebo plus exemestane. 
Based on the expectation that patients previously sensitive to hormonal therapy will respond better to 
exemestane treatment, while patients with visceral disease will progress more rapidly, randomisation 
was stratified by: 
  Documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (yes versus no) 
 
Presence of visceral metastasis (yes versus no) 
Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either: 
  Documented clinical benefit (CR, PR, SD ≥ 24 weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the 
advanced setting, or 
  ≥ 24 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy prior to recurrence

Blinding (masking) 
The study was a double blind study. Patients were assigned to each treatment arm by centralised 
allocation (i.e., interactive web response system [IWRS]/interactive voice response system [IVRS]. 
Statistical methods 
An interim analysis was to be performed after observing 317 (60%) of the total PFS events as per local 
assessment. The PFS survival distribution for each treatment group was estimated using Kaplan-Meier 
methodology. The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of the survival distributions of two 
treatment groups using a stratified log-rank test at an overall one-sided 0.025 level of significance 
(strata information obtained through IXRS used for randomisation). The hazard ratio (HR) for the risk 
reduction in PFS, along with the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), was estimated from a 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model that accounted for the stratification scheme used at the time 
of randomisation. 
OS was to be statistically evaluated and interpreted only if PFS was significantly different between 
treatment groups. A hierarchical testing strategy was to be used to control the overall type-I error 
rate. Up to three OS analyses were planned: these were to be at the time of the interim analysis for 
PFS, after observing 173 deaths, and after 392 deaths. The type-I error rate was maintained by using 
an α-spending function described by Lan and DeMets (1983) which approximates O’Brien and Fleming 
(1979)-type stopping boundaries. Results of the OS interim analyses were not to be disclosed by the 
IDMC unless found to be statistically significant. 
The distribution function of OS was to be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The two 
treatment groups were to be compared using a stratified log-rank test at an overall one-sided 2.5% 
level of significance. A stratified Cox regression was to be used to estimate the OS hazard ratio and the 
associated 95% CI. 
Sensitivity analyses conducted included repeating the primary PFS analysis using different censoring 
rules and using an unstratified log-rank test to compare the two treatment groups. 
Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of either 
CR or PR, and clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the proportion of patients with best overall 
response of CR, PR, or SD ≥ 24 weeks, were summarised along with the exact 95% CIs calculated 
using the method described in Clopper and Pearson (1934)21. A stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) test was used to compare the two treatment groups with respect to ORR and CBR at the one-
sided 2.5% level of significance using the same stratification information that was used for 
randomisation. Response was based on RECIST 1.0. These two endpoints were assessed both as per 
investigator and independent central review. 
QoL scores were analyzed over time using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and breast cancer-specific BR23 
questionnaires. Changes from baseline in the sub-scale scores at the time of each assessment were 
summarised.

 Patient disposition by treatment (FAS)- Study Y2301 
Recruitment 
The first patient visit was 3rd June 2009, and the study was still ongoing as of the 24th June 2012. 
Patients were recruited in 196 centres in 24 countries worldwide (Australia, Austria, Belgium, brazil, 
Canada, Czech republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, japan, Republic of 
Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, turkey, United 
Kingdom, USA. 
Conduct of the study 
Amendment 1 to Clinical Trial Protocol CRAD001Y2301 as of 17 February 2010 clarified that all primary 
(and secondary) endpoints based on radiological (and photographical when applicable) assessments of 
tumour burden will be derived using the local (treating centre’s) radiologist’s/investigator’s 
assessment. The original protocol as of 3 March 2009 stated at this place that efficacy will be assessed 
via a blinded, independent central review process. PFS as by central review remained an endpoint “for 
secondary supportive efficacy analyses” following amendment 1. 
The study design incorporated a pre-planned interim analysis after observing 60% of this number 
(corresponding to approximately 317 events). As of the cut-off date for the interim analysis, 359 
events (68% of the required number) had occurred as per investigator (at which time 217 central PFS 
events were recorded as per central review). 
As the independent central review of local radiology data formed the basis for the secondary 
supportive analysis of PFS, the IDMC charter was amended on 11 May 2011 to enable the study to be 
declared positive for PFS at the time of the interim analysis, if and only if, both local and central PFS 
analyses were statistically significant in favour of everolimus plus exemestane, using a Lan-DeMets α-

spending function with O’Brien-Fleming type stopping boundaries that were driven by the number of 
local and central PFS events observed: 
 
 
The nominal p-value for the PFS analysis as per investigator was p<0.0065 
The nominal p-value for the PFS analysis as per central review was p<0.0005 
Analyses presented in the study report of the submission are based on data collected up to 
11 February 2011 (cut-off date for the interim analysis that was performed on 29 June 2011). 
Patients in the placebo plus exemestane arm were not allowed to cross over to everolimus at the time 
of progression. Following progression or after study treatment discontinuation, patients continued to be 
followed for survival every 3 months until a total of 392 deaths were recorded. 
Major protocol deviations are shown in Table 13:

Numbers analysed 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population consisted of all randomised patients. Four patients (0.6%) were 
excluded from the Safety Set; all four of these patients (three in the everolimus plus exemestane arm 
and one in the placebo plus exemestane group) were randomised but subsequently did not receive 
study treatment (Table 19).

Table 19: 
Analysis sets by treatment (FAS) – Study Y2301 
The Safety Set population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of the study 
treatment and who had at least one valid post-baseline safety assessment. Patients were analysed 
according to the treatment actually received. For a patient taking at least one dose of the randomised 
treatment, treatment actually received was considered to be the randomised treatment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: PFS 
The results of the primary endpoint PFS in patients treated with the combination of everolimus and 
exemestane compared to placebo and exemestane treated group are reported in Table 20, 21, 22 and 
Figure 4. There were three data cut-off updates for PFS. Results from the final PFS analysis for 
Study Y2301 based on a 15 December 2011 cut-off, corresponded to a median follow-up of 
17.7 months.

The number of censored events is different between the two treatment groups, for both investigator 
and independent central review. The reasons for censoring are displayed in Table 23.

Summary of censoring reasons – Study Y2301 
Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the magnitude of investigator bias and of 
treatment effect. The sensitivity analyses are presented in Table 24.

Overall Survival 
Using the expected number of OS events at the planned conclusion of surveillance for all-cause 
mortality (i.e., 392 deaths), 170 observed deaths (46% of expected deaths; p-value =0.0010) were 
required for a second interim analysis of OS. The database at the time of analysis of OS had 182 
observed deaths.  
The results of the 2nd interim analysis are shown in Table 25 and Figure 5.

Time to and duration of response 
Time to response varied between 5.1 and 37.1 weeks for the exemestane plus everolimus arm and 
was 7.4 weeks for the single patient with a response in the placebo plus exemestane arm. 
Duration of OR varied between 6.0+ and 66.1+ weeks for the everolimus plus exemestane arm and 
was 12.1+ weeks for the single patient in the placebo plus exemestane arm. 
Patient reported outcome 
The median times to deterioration (≥ 5%) of global health status/QoL domain score of QLQ-C30 are 
shown in Figure 6. A mixed effect longitudinal model was fit on the change from baseline in the global 
health status of QLQ-C30.

Biomarkers 
Results for biomarkers were not submitted with the application. The following biomarkers were being 
evaluated in archival tumour samples collected from approximately 65% of the Full Analysis Set: 
protein expression of PTEN, pS6, and Ki67 by immunohistochemistry; somatic mutations in PI3KCA, 
PTEN, and p53 by sequencing; and PI3K amplification.   
However, exploratory analyses on bone related biomarkers (bone turnover biomarkers) were 
submitted. The results are presented in Table 28.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate consistency and robustness of the primary PFS results 
according to baseline factors, including baseline stratification factors (prior sensitivity to hormonal 
therapy and presence of visceral disease). The results are shown in Figure 8.

Last treatment prior to enrolling in Study Y2301 
The CHMP requested to analyse the results of PFS according to patients having received NSAI as the 
last therapy before enrolling in the study Y2301. There were 361 patients (74.4%) in the 
everolimus+exemestane and 178 patients (74.4%) in the placebo+exemestane arms whose last 
therapy prior to enrolling in Study Y2301 was a NSAI.  Subgroup PFS analyses for patients having 
received a NSAI (yes) or other therapy (no) as last treatment before treatment with 
everolimus/placebo in combination with exemestane are presented in Table 31 for the 11-February-
2011 and 08-July-2011 (updated) data cut-offs.

The study was designed as a double-blind Phase II study to assess clinical response in patients 
randomised for 16 weeks to treatment with 10 mg everolimus + 2.5 mg letrozole or placebo + 2.5 mg 
letrozole following surgery. Surgery had to have occured maximum of 1 week after last dose. 
There was an open-label extension (depending on risk/benefit assessment) powered for final analysis 
of predictive biomarkers. 
The first patient was enrolled in the study on 22 May 2005 and the last patient completed the study on 
4 April 2007. 
The results of the study are shown in Table 34, 35 and 36.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study Y2301 was a phase III pivotal randomised, placebo controlled, blinded, multicentre study.  
The choice of PFS as a primary endpoint as per investigator (local) assessment and of OS and ORR as 
secondary endpoints was considered acceptable. The CHMP noted that patients were not allowed to 
cross-over to everolimus plus exemestane treatment after recurrence or progression of the disease. 
This avoided any confounding effect from subsequent treatment on both arms. 
The choice of the comparator arm of placebo plus exemestane was not considered as the appropriate 
comparator arm for the study population being treated with everolimus plus exemestane. The CHMP 
highlighted that everolimus alone would have been a better choice considering that the heavily pre-
treated patient population was refractory to aromatase inhibitors. Because of the low response 
observed in the exemestane treated arm of 0.4% for ORR compared to the expected ORR of 15%, 
there was the possibility that patients received suboptimal treatment with exemestane.  Thus, the 
CHMP requested the submission of the results of the study BOLERO-6, which compares everolimus 
treated patients to everolimus plus exemestane treated patients to chemotherapy treatment, as a 
condition of the marketing authorisation. The CHMP was of the opinion that the study results on the 
efficacy of everolimus treatment alone may impact the benefit risk of the proposed indication. Thus, 
the requirement to submit results of this study was included as a condition in Annex II. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study reached its primary objective and the final PFS analysis (15 December 2011) showed a 
statistically significantly higher PFS for everolimus plus exemestane of 7.82 months compared to 3.19 
months for placebo plus exemestane (HR:0.45; CI 0.38-0.54; p<0.0001) in the analysis of the primary 
endpoint. Assessment by central radiology review supported the primary analysis of PFS (11.01 vs 
4.14 months, respectively, HR 0.38; CI 0.31-0.48; p<0.0001). Although the OS data did not reach the 
stopping boundary and were considered still immature, the secondary endpoints OS and ORR and the 
sensitivity analyses further supported the results of the primary analysis.  The subgroup analyses 
showed that a benefit in favour of the exemestane plus everolimus could be observed in all subgroups 
analysed, including for the subgroups stratified according to hormonal sensitivity and the presence or 
absence of visceral metastases. The low ORR and the lack of suppression of oestrogen was of concern 
since there was the possibility that exemestane treatment may have been suboptimal and ineffective in 
both treatment arms. However, because the PFS results were consistent and stable for the three 
different efficacy analyses, the effect of everolimus plus exemestane was confirmed.  
The proportion of patients with non-measurable disease was balanced between the two treatment 
arms. There were no patients in the non-measurable group with an ORR in either treatment arm and 
no patients experienced a complete response.  The treatment effect in terms of CBR was comparable 
for patients with and without measurable disease for both the everolimus plus exemestane and placebo 
plus exemestane arms. The median PFS for patients with measurable disease was slightly shorter than 
that for patients with non-measurable disease. This is an expected result for patients with visceral 
involvement who typically have a worse prognosis than patients with bone or soft tissue involvement. 
There was no difference in PFS between patients either treated or not with NSAI as last treatment prior 
to enrolment in the study. The observations appear to be consistent with expected treatment-effect 
results for both treatment groups. 
Bone turnover biomarkers such as bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), aminoterminal 
propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP), and collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX) showed 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report for Afinitor  
EMA/CHMP/438808/2012  
Page 41/79
 
 
 
 
 
minor decreases from baseline compared to increases with exemestane; however, CVs are wide in all 
cases. The results appear to indicate that there were no negative effect on bone turnover from the 
combination treatment. 
The results for Quality of Life and Clinical Performance Status did not show a significant difference 
between the two treatment arms. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal trial Y2301 provided satisfactory evidence that the combination of everolimus plus 
examestane leads to prolongation of PFS in hormone-receptor positive, Her2/neu negative, post-
menopausal advanced breast cancer women compared to exemestane alone. The clinical benefit was 
considered relevant in spite of the low ORR and the immature OS data. There was no comparative data 
of everolimus plus exemestane with chemotherapy, which is the treatment of choice for patients with 
more aggressive course of disease characterised by symptomatic visceral disease. Thus, the CHMP 
considered that the indication should be restricted to patients without symptomatic visceral disease in 
order to avoid the possibility of undertreatment.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy. These 
measures are included in the RMP: 
  CRAD001J2301: A randomised, phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of 
everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel as first-line therapy in women with 
HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
  CRAD001W2301: A randomised, phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of 
daily everolimus in combination with trastuzumab and vinorelbine, in pretreated women with 
HER2/neu over-expressing locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
–  CRAD001Y2301: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of everolimus in 
combination with exemestane in the treatment of postmenopausal women with oestrogen 
receptor positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who are refractory to letrozole or 
anastrozole (submission of final OS data) 
–  Submission of CSR of BOLERO-6, in order to clarify the combined effect of everolimus plus 
exemestane vs everolimus alone due date 3Q 2017. 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to efficacy. This 
measure is included as a condition in the Annex II: 
–  Submission of CSR of BOLERO-6, in order to clarify the combined effect of everolimus plus 
exemestane vs everolimus alone due date 3Q 2017. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The overall safety database in the proposed indication consisted of data from 720 postmenopausal 
women with hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, with similar demographic and disease 
characteristics for the two treatment arms in the pivotal study Y2301: 482 were exposed to everolimus 
at the recommended 10-mg dose and exemestane, using the proposed recommended 25 mg daily 
dose regimen, and 238 to examestane alone. In addition, safety data from other ongoing studies with 
everolimus in the treatment of breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell cancer, tuberous 
sclerosis, lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer were reviewed for safety signals.

Patient exposure 
As of the data cut-off (11 February 2011), median follow-up was 7.6 months. The median duration of 
exposure to everolimus was 14.6 weeks (range: 1 to 79); the median duration of exposure to 
exemestane in the same arm was slightly longer (17.4 weeks, range: 1 to 79). Placebo and 
exemestane were both administered for a median 12.0 weeks in the control arm (range: 1 to 69). 
Duration of exposure (Table 37), cumulative dose, dose intensity and relative dose intensity (Table 38) 
are shown below.

Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events were reported in 22.8% of patients in the everolimus plus exemestance treated 
group compared to 12.2% of patients in the placebo plus exemestane treated group. The most 
commonly reported SAEs in the everolimus group were pneumonitis (2.5%), pneumonia (1.5%), 
anaemia, dyspnoea, pulmonary embolism, pyrexia, and renal failure (all 1.2%).  
There were 52 patients (10.8%) in the everolimus plus exemestane group compared with 3 patients 
(1.3%) in the placebo plus exemestane group that experienced SAEs that were suspected to be

adverse drug reactions. The most commonly serious adverse drug reactions were pneumonitis 
(everolimus: 12 [2.5%]; placebo: 0), renal failure (5 [1.0%]; 0) and hyperglycemia (4 [0.8%]; 0). 
Deaths 
From the safety population of 720 patients, 51 patients (10.6%) and 31 patients (13.0%) died in the 
everolimus plus exemestane compared to placebo plus exemestane treatment groups. A summary of 
the causes of death is shown in Table 42. In the everolimus+exemestane treated arm, one death 
(0.2%) was suspected by the investigator to be related to study treatment (after 32 days of 
treatment); for this patient the primary cause of death was hemorrhage from tumor (right anterior 
chest wall mass). The remaining 6 deaths were not suspected to be related to study treatment, 
although 4 were due to events that reflect known risks of everolimus therapy. All 6 of these additional 
deaths from data cut-off of 08-July-2011 were attributed to the underlying malignancy (4 due to study 
indication and single cases of metastatic breast cancer and neoplasm progression).

Other significant events 
The most commonly occurring AEs necessitating dose interruption and/or reduction in the everolimus 
plus exemestane group were stomatitis (22.0% of patients), pneumonitis (6.0%), and 
thrombocytopenia (5.0%) with a total of 57.7% of such AEs compared to 12.2% in the placebo plus 
exemestane group). Dose adjustments as the result of AEs from the following SOCs were more 
common in the everolimus plus exemestane group: ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (+24.6% relative to 
placebo), ‘respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders’ (+12.0%), ‘investigations’ (+9.1%), ‘blood 
and lymphatic system disorders (+7.5%), ‘infections and infestations’ (+7.3%), ‘skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders’ (+5.2%), and ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’ 
(+5.0%). 
There were 6 AEs that required additional treatment in the everolimus plus exemestane group: 
stomatitis (+35.4% relative to placebo plus exemestane), rash (+14.3%), pneumonitis (+7.1%), 
anemia (+6.6%), hyperglycemia (+6.0%), and headache (+5.6%). On the other hand, in the placebo 
group bone pain and pain in extremities required about 3.5% more frequently additional therapy. 
The incidence of bone-related AEs was low (less than 2.5% overall), and these events were reported in 
a similar proportion of patients across the two treatment arms. No grade 3-4 fractures were reported 
in the everolimus plus exemestane arm (0 out of 11 patients) compared with 3 grade-3 events in the 
exemestane plus placebo arm (1.3%; 3 out of 6 patients). One patient experienced spinal compression 
fracture (grade 2) in the everolimus plus exemestane arm which was considered related to study 
medication. 
Laboratory findings 
Higher rates of clinical and heamatological abnormalities were observed in treated patients with 
everolimus plus exemestane compared to placebo plus exemestane group (Table 43). Hyperglycemia 
and elevated lipids were managed with concomitant medication and/or dietary intervention. Anemia 
was commonly treated with blood transfusion. Patients with creatinine elevations required varied 
interventions, primarily volume repletion and/or change in potentially nephrotoxic medications.

Table 43: 
Grading of abnormal laboratory values for heamatology and clinical chemistry 
Abnormal glomerular filtration rates (defined as grades 2 to 4) were reported more frequently in the 
everolimus plus exemestane treated group (30.9%) compared to placebo plus exemestane (21.8%) 
group; most of these abnormalities were grade 2. 
Differences in vital signs and body weight between treatment groups were not considered to be 
clinically noteworthy. No significant change in blood pressure, changes in pulse, respiratory rate, or 
temperature was recorded at any time during the study in either treatment arm.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
The rates of hypersensitivity for both treatment groups are shown in Table 44.

without everolimus – Study Y2301 
One patient (0.2%) in the everolimus plus exemestane arm required dose adjustment/interruption as a 
result of angio-oedema. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
38% (275/449) of the patients in the pivotal study were aged ≥ 65 years. The following AE categories 
were found to be higher in the age groups of ≥ 65 years versus < 65 years:  
–  AEs grade 3 (42.2% versus 32.8%) or grade 4 (9.9% versus 5.5%) 
–  AEs leading to study drug discontinuation: 29.2% versus 12.4% (e.g. dyspnea, fatigue, decreased 
appetite, rash) 
–  Deaths: 4.7% versus 1.0% 
–  SAEs: 29.2% versus 18.6% 
–  Clinically notable AEs: 
• renal events: 14.1% versus 6.2% (mainly blood creatinine increased) 
• haemorrhages: 24.0% versus 16.6% (mainly epistaxis) 
Breakdown of the elderly population (≥ 75 years, ≥ 70 to < 75 years, and ≥ 65 to < 70 years) 
provided no further evidence of relevant differences across these subgroups as the numbers of patients 
were too low.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples in 130 patients were collected for the assessment of everolimus, 
exemestane, and oestradiol levels (please refer to clinical pharmacokinectic section 2.4.2). Exposure to 
everolimus expressed as trough concentrations (Cmin) or 2 hours post administration (C2h) was 
(mean±SD) 16.04±9.356 ng/mL and 46.50±17.954 ng/m L, respectively. 
Following co-administration of everolimus+exemestane, Cmin and C2h were 45% and 71% higher than 
placebo+exemestane values.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Altogether, 13% of the patients in the everolimus+exemestane group withdrew due to AEs or ‘patient 
wish’ compared to 5% in the placebo+exemestane group. Discontinuations directly attributable to AEs 
were more frequent in the everolimus group (19.1% vs. 4.6% with placebo) and about half of the 
cases were grade 3 or 4 events. The most commonly reported AEs leading to discontinuation were

pneumonitis (3.9% of patients), stomatitis (2.3%), fatigue (1.9%), decreased appetite (1.7%), 
dyspnea (1.7%), anemia (1.2%), and nausea (1.0%), but except for dyspnea these events were 
predominantly of grades 1-2.  
Discontinuations due to the following SOCs were more common in the everolimus plus exemestane 
arm: ‘respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders’ (+7.3% relative to placebo plus exemestane), 
‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (+4.4%), and  ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’ 
(+3.7%). 
Post marketing experience 
The MAH did not submit new safety information on post-marketing usage in the claimed indication. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety and tolerability of everolimus 10-mg daily in combination with exemestane 25-mg daily in 
the treatment of oestrogen-receptor positive postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer 
after previous non-steroidal aromatase-inhibitors was assessed. The median duration of treatment for 
everolimus plus exemestane was 14.6 months, while the placebo plus exemestane group received 
treatment for a median of 12 months. 
In general, the reported adverse events were similar to what has been reported for RCC and pNET 
treatments at the same dose. The most common adverse drug reactions, with an incidence ≥ 10%, 
reported in association with everolimus plus exemestane therapy were: stomatitis, rash, fatigue, 
decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, nausea, pneumonitis, weight decreased, epistaxis, and 
thrombocytopenia.  Stomatitis was reported more than 5-fold compared to the placebo arm (64.5% vs. 
10.9%). Haemorrhages were seen twice as often as in the placebo group (19.5% vs. 8.9%). The most 
common grade 3-4 adverse drug reactions, with an incidence ≥ 2% were: stomatitis, hyperglycaemia, 
pneumonitis, anaemia, fatigue, elevated alanine transaminase, thrombocytopenia, elevated aspartate 
transaminase, dyspnoea, and neutropenia. 
The total percentage of on-treatment deaths were 2.5% in the combination group vs. 1.7% in the 
control group.  In those patients with ‘AE’ as primary cause of death, the proportions were 1.5% vs. 
0.4%, respectively. Infectious events might be the major cause of AE related deaths.  Non-infectious 
pneumonitis, stomatitis/oral mucositis, and an increased susceptibility to infection represent the most 
important clinical issues. 
Interestingly, the very common exemestane ADR ‘hot-flushes’ was reported less frequent in the 
everolimus plus exemestane group than in the placebo plus exemestane arm. The mechanism of action 
was unknown. 
There were no unexpected results concerning abnormal laboratory values for everolimus plus 
exemestane treatment.  
Concerning AEs in the elderly, AEs were reported more often in patients above 65 years. In a subgroup 
of Asian, i.e. Japanese patients, a higher rate of some ADRs, especially stomatitis was reported.  
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g. oral, 
injected, or implanted non-oestrogen-containing hormonal method of birth control, progesterone-based 
contraceptives, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, complete abstinence, barrier methods, intrauterine device 
[IUD], and/or female/male sterilisation) while receiving everolimus, and for up to 8 weeks after ending 
treatment. 
Pregnancy

Page 52/79
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no adequate data from the use of everolimus in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity effects including embryotoxicity and foetotoxicity (see section 5.3). The 
potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Everolimus is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether everolimus is excreted in breast milk. However, in rats, everolimus and/or its 
metabolites readily pass into the milk (see section 5.3). Therefore, women taking everolimus should 
not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
The potential for everolimus to cause infertility in male and female patients is unknown, however 
secondary amenorrhoea and associated luteinising hormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
imbalance has been observed in female patients. Based on non-clinical findings, male fertility may be 
compromised by treatment with everolimus (see section 5.3). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety and tolerability of everolimus in study Y2301 showed no unexpected toxicities.  No new 
safety concerns have emerged in the combination of everolimus plus exemestane. The SmPC already 
lists the ADRs observed in this phase III study and thus, no need to update the safety information in 
section 4.8.

the safety concerns related to long term safety of everolimus as well as to comparative safety of 
everolimus and exemestane combination therapy versus everolimus monotherapy:

Description 
CRAD001J2301 
CRAD001W2301 
CRAD001Y2301 
BOLERO-6 (Y2201): A three-arm randomized phase II study investigating the 
combination of everolimus with exemestane versus everolimus alone versus 
capecitabine in patients with estrogen-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer after 
recurrence or progression on letrozole or anastrozole. The trial aims to estimate the 
value of exemestane when added to everolimus versus everolimus monotherapy in 
this group of patients in terms of progression-free survival, response rate, clinical 
benefit rate, pharmacokinetics, and safety. The trial will also evaluate capecitabine 
monotherapy relative to the combination of everolimus and exemestane, with respect 
to the same endpoints. Patients will be followed for survival for up to two years after 
randomization of last patient. A total of 300 patients (100 per treatment arm) are 
planned to be recruited uniformly over a 18 month period.

In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should take the following minor points into 
consideration when an update of the RMP is submitted: 
–  Addition of comparator data for all approved indications in section 1.5.2.  
–  Addition of information on observed outcomes for the important identified and potential risks, e.g. 
number and percentage of fatal, recovered/with/without treatment/sequelae, not recovered or 
hospitalised in section 1.5.2.  
–  Update of the summary table to include information on developmental toxicity and not on 
teratogenicity (the corresponding studies were summarised in the part on non-clinical safety: In an 
oral neonatal and juvenile development study with rats, the administration of everolimus at 0.15, 
0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg, or rapamycin at 1.5 mg/kg on postpartum days 7 to 70 with 13- and 26-week 
recovery periods resulted in systemic toxicity at all doses, including reduced absolute body weight 
gain and food consumption, and delayed attainment of some developmental landmarks, with full or 
partial recovery after cessation of dosing [.]). 
No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
2.8.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
– 
The changes to the Package Leaflet were considered minor with no consequential impact on the 
readability of the package leaflet.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The pivotal trial met its primary endpoint and the efficacy of everolimus in combination with 
exemestane “for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast 
cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral 
disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor” is considered 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report for Afinitor

established. The median PFS was prolonged by 4.63 months, from 3.19 months for patients receiving 
placebo plus exemestane to 7.82 months for patients treated with everolimus plus exemestane. 
The secondary endpoints, tumour related endpoints (ORR) and OS, and subgroup analyses were 
supportive of the primary analysis.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There is uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the additional benefit of exemestane in the 
combination treatment effect over everolimus treatment alone. The design of the study precludes any 
information on the potential benefit of everolimus treatment as a single agent in the patient population 
studied in the clinical trial. The MAH was requested to submit the results of the study BOLERO-6, a 
study comparing everolimus alone with everolimus plus exemestane after prior therapy with NSAI in 
order to confirm the synergistic/additive effect of exemestane.  
The interim results for OS, which were immature at the time of assessment, appeared to suggest a 
trend favouring the combination treatment. However, as the number of events and criteria for 
unblinding had not been met, there was uncertainty over the final results of OS. The MAH was asked to 
submit the final OS results as part of an RMP measure. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety and tolerability of everolimus in combination with exemestane was in general consistent 
with the approved SmPC for Afinitor. However, everolimus plus exemestane treatment was 
accompanied by substantially more toxicity than exemestane treatment alone with 10% more SAEs, 
35% more drug-related AEs and a threefold increase in the number of on-treatment deaths. The risk of 
non-infectious pneumonitis, infections, stomatitis and hemorrhages was also increased in the 
combination treatment. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There were no uncertainties in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects that could affect the 
benefit-risk balance of the final proposed indication. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Overall, the pivotal study provided satisfactory results with respect to efficacy (prolongation of PFS) 
and safety (no emergence of a major safety signal) in the proposed indication. Thus, the beneficial 
effect of everolimus plus exemestane treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer was regarded 
as clinically relevant.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the results of the pivotal trial Y2301, the benefits of everolimus in combination with 
exemestane treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer (PFS prolongation of 4.63 months) 
outweighed the adverse events (stomatitis, rash, fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, 
nausea, pneumonitis, weight decreased, epistaxis, and thrombocytopenia). Therefore, the CHMP

considered that the benefit-risk balance for everolimus in the indication “for the treatment of hormone 
receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative advanced breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in 
postmenopausal women without symptomatic visceral disease after recurrence or progression following 
a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor” is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change(s): 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension of indication to include Afinitor for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive, HER2/neu 
negative advanced breast cancer, in combination with exemestane, in postmenopausal women without 
symptomatic visceral disease after recurrence or progression following a non-steroidal aromatase 
inhibitor. Consequently sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were updated. Section 4.6 was 
updated to align with wording in the SmPC for Votubia and minor editorial changes were made to 
section 5.3 to revise the wording to correlate exposure in rats in a male fertility study and clinical 
exposure. The Risk Management Plan and the Package Leaflet were updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Risk management system  
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the 
marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

agreed in version 7.1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing 
authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached  
  at the request of the EMA 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

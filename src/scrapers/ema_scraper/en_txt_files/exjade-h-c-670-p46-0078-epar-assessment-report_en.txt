2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Information on the development program 
CICL670AIC04 study was an interventional study to collect additional data on safety and efficacy of Exjade® 
(deferasirox) film coated tablet (FCT) formulation in patients with transfusion dependent thalassemia or 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (very low, low or intermediate risk) when treated over 24 weeks in 
CICL670F2201 study. CICL670F2201 study was a randomized, open label, multicenter, 2-arm, phase II study 
initiated to assess the safety of the DT and the FCT formulations in patients with transfusion-dependent 
thalassemia or MDS (very low, low or intermediate risk) treated over 24 weeks. Treatment duration of 24 
weeks in CICL670F2201 study was considered sufficient to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and patient 
reported outcomes of the two formulations. Previous studies of pediatric and adolescent patients 
demonstrated differences in iron chelation medication compliance within this time period (Jordan et al 2012, 
Alvarez et al 2009). The CICL670AIC04 study was planned to include up to 58 patients at ages 10 years and 
older, from all European regions participating sites completed the 24-week treatment under protocol 
CICL670F2201 
This study allowed for the enrollment of male and female patients > 10 years old. This report only focuses on 
the results of the 3 pediatric patients enrolled in the CICL670AIC04 study. The study started (first patient 
first visit) on 16-Aug-2016 and completed on 23-Jul-2019 (last patient last visit). The study was conducted at 
14 centers across 3 countries (Austria: 1, Greece: 3, and Italy: 10).

No changes to the pediatric information of the current deferasirox Core Data Sheet (CDS) are proposed as a 
result of this study.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
The marketed formulation i.e deferasirox film-coated tablets of 90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg dose strengths 
were administered by oral daily dosing. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Chronic iron overload represents a serious complication of potentially lifesaving blood transfusions, which are 
the mainstay of therapy in transfusion-dependent anemias. Since humans have no mechanism for the active 
elimination of iron from the body, excess iron received via transfusions deposits in various tissues of the 
body, particularly the liver, heart and endocrine organs, leading to end-organ dysfunction and eventually 
organ failure. Indeed, organ failure due to chronic iron overload represents the major cause of death in 
patients with β-thalassemia major who receive blood transfusions regularly without appropriate chelation 
therapy. 
Beta-thalassemias are a group of hereditary blood disorders characterized by anomalies in the synthesis of 
the beta chains of hemoglobin resulting in variable phenotypes, ranging from severe anemia to clinically 
asymptomatic individuals. Patients with β-thalassemia major usually present within the first 2 years of life 
with severe anemia requiring regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Regular transfusion therapy leads to 
iron overload with iron-related complications including endocrine complications, such as growth retardation, 
failure of sexual maturation, diabetes mellitus, cardiac complications, such as dilated myocardiopathy, and 
liver complications including fibrosis and cirrhosis. 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include a diverse group of acquired disorders of hematopoiesis, collectively 
characterized by bone marrow failure (i.e. inadequate production of healthy, mature blood cells) and a 
tendency for clonal evolution. Signs and symptoms of MDS relate to hematopoietic failure, manifesting in 
anemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. The anemia is often severe, leading to regular transfusions and 
reduced QoL. Additionally, iron overload may negatively impact survival in MDS, especially for patients with 
low-risk MDS. 
Deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) was first registered on 02-Nov-2005 in the United States and 
subsequently in the EU via centralized procedure on 28-Aug-2006. The new deferasirox film-coated tablet 
(FCT) formulation for oral administration was developed due to the chronic nature of chelation therapy and 
the importance of patient compliance. Novartis is currently Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) for 
deferasirox DT in 127 countries and for deferasirox FCT in 80 countries worldwide. The FCT used in this study 
contained the same active substance of the iron chelator deferasirox (Exjade® company research code 
ICL670) and strength-adjusted to achieve comparable exposure to the currently approved DT. The FCT is 
available in 3 dose strengths (90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg) and is dosed based on body weight. The 
deferasirox FCT can be taken either on an empty stomach or with a light meal. The FCT formulation is

approved in US (30-Mar-2015) and Canada (24-Feb-2016), and in the EU (European Commission Decision 
dated 22-Mar-2016). 
EXJADE is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥7 
ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. 
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups:  
- 
- 
- 
in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years,  
in adult and paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent 
blood transfusions (≤7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older,  
in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
Deferasirox is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload in patients with non-transfusion-
dependent thalassemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. 
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
This open-label, multicenter, single arm, 24-month, phase III study was aimed to collect additional data on 
safety and tolerability as well as data on efficacy of the FCT formulation in patients with transfusion-
dependent thalassemia or MDS (very low, low or intermediate risk) when treated for more than 24 weeks in 
CICL670F2201 study.  
Methods 
Study design 
This open-label, multicenter, single arm study was aimed at collecting additional data on safety and tolerability 
as well as data on efficacy of the FCT formulation in patients with transfusion dependent thalassemia or MDS 
(very low, low or intermediate risk) when treated for >24 weeks in CICL670F2201 study. At the start of this 
study, the following were required to be conducted: 
- 
 Patients  continuing  directly  from  CICL670F2201  where  they  were  originally  randomized  to  the 
deferasirox FCT formulation, were required to continue treatment at the same dose they were assigned 
at the end of CICL670F2201. 
- 
 Patients continuing directly  from CICL670F2201 who were originally assigned to the deferasirox DT 
formulation were required to switch to the deferasirox FCT formulation with a dose equivalent to the 
deferasirox DT dose they were assigned at the end of CICL670F2201.

Page 6/12 
  
  
- 
 Patients who completed CICL670F2201 study and switched to commercially available DT or other ICT 
were required to undergo a 5-day washout period and then had to use an equivalent FCT starting dose 
corresponding to their last deferasirox dose on CICL670F2201 study. 
Patients were instructed to swallow deferasirox FCT (available strengths of deferasirox FCT tablets: 90 mg, 180 
mg and 360 mg) once daily either on an empty stomach or with a light meal.  
The  planned  duration  of  treatment  in  this  study  was  for  a  maximum  of  24  months.  Dose  adjustment  was 
allowed based on serum ferritin levels and investigator’s judgment, if necessary every 3 months, with ±3.5 to 
7 mg/kg/day, but no more than 28 mg/kg/day. 
Patients  who  were  withdrawn  prematurely  from  CICL670F2201  study  were  not  enrolled.  Patients  with  a  lag 
period between completion of CICL670F2201 study and enrollment in this study could be done, after a washout 
period, even if they had to switch to DT or other chelation therapy in this period. However, no patient for this 
study  continued  directly  from  CICL670F2201  study  and  the  gap  time  between  when  patients  completed 
CICL670F2201  and  started  CICL670AIC04  was  often  extensive,  therefore  Principle  Investigator’s  clinical 
judgment  in  starting  dose  assignment  was  considered  acceptable  and  no  protocol  deviations  was  raised  for 
these cases. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprised of all patients enrolled in this study. Analysis of efficacy was done in 
FAS.  The  Safety  Set  comprised  of  all  enrolled  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment 
(deferasirox FCT) and had at least one safety assessment on or after Day 1. The safety analyses was performed 
on the Safety Set.

Study objectives and related endpoints: 
Statistical Methods 
The analyses were descriptive. No hypothesis was tested. 
The incidence of any TEAEs overall and by severity were summarized using frequency counts, percentages of 
patients, and on selected TEAE summaries 95% CIs for percentages obtained using Clopper-Pearson method. 
Laboratory data were summarized using descriptive statistics including 95% CI of the mean for raw values and 
absolute  change  from  baseline  at  each  visit.  Furthermore,  mean  and  standard  deviation  (SD)  values  were 
plotted  over  time  for  each  of  the  laboratory  parameters  of  interest  (serum  creatinine,  creatinine  clearance, 
ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT, RBC, platelets, WBC total). Serum ferritin was summarized using descriptive statistics 
of raw values, absolute change from baseline, and relative change from baseline at each visit. The summaries 
included n, mean with respective 95% CI, SD, minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum. 
Results  
Demographic  characteristics:  A  total  of  53  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  present  study,  of  those  3  patients 
(5.7%) were under the age of 18 years (13, 15 and 16 years respectively) and 50 patients (94.3%) were aged 
≥ 18 years (86.8% were between the ages of 18 and <50 years; 1.9% were between 50 and <65 years and 
5.7% were 65 years or older). Most patients were of Caucasian race (50 patients, 94.3%). Overall, 66.0% of 
patients were female. 
Background characteristics: Most patients (49 patients, 92.5%) had transfusion dependent thalassemia and 4 
patients (7.5%) had MDS: all the 3 patients aged <18 years had thalassemia as their main underlying disease. 
Bone marrow examinations were only performed on patients with MDS (4 patients, 7.5%) and all 4 patients

were found to be hematologically stable. The mean (SD) duration since the last bone marrow examination was 
2.6 (1.0) years. 
Compliance: Patients had a mean relative consumed tablets count of 90.175% (95% CI: 87.398- 92.951). 
CHMP comment 
The majority of patients (94.3%) enrolled in this study were adults, and only 3 (5.7%) patients aged <18 
years were included.  
Efficacy results: 
The results of the 3 pediatric patients are provided as follow: 
Patient ITA-1276-00005 started treatment with deferasirox FCT at 900 mg/day and daily dose was increased 
to 1170 mg on Study Day 120 due to lack of efficacy. After Month 7, a decrease in serum ferritin levels was 
observed as compared with baseline. Starting from Month 14, serum ferritin levels were below <1000 μg/L, 
thus deferasirox FCT dose was reduced to 1080 mg/day and later 720 mg/day as per protocol during the 
study. However serum ferritin levels were 1107 μg/L at Month 26. 
Patient ITA-1276-00008 started treatment with deferasirox FCT at 1260 mg/day and daily dose was 
increased to 1530 mg on Study Day 148 and 1710 mg on Study Day 234 due to AE serum ferritin increased. 
After Month 14, a decrease in serum ferritin levels was observed as compared with baseline. During the study 
serum ferritin levels were below <1500 μg/L starting from Month 14, and later serum ferritin levels are 
decreased below ≤500 μg/L starting from Month 21 to Month 24, thus deferasirox FCT dose was reduced to 
1260 mg/day as per protocol during study. However serum ferritin levels were 573 μg/L at Month 26. 
Patient ITA-1276-00011 started treatment with deferasirox FCT at 990 mg/day and daily dose was increased 
to 1170 mg on Study Day 30 (as per protocol) and 1260 mg on Study Day 75 due to lack of efficacy. This 
patient experienced an AE of serum ferritin abnormal on Study Day 143 which was ongoing at the time of last 
reporting. 
CHMP comment 
The efficacy investigation was the secondary objective of the CICL670AIC04 study. The Absolute and relative 
change in serum ferritin level over time were provided for each pediatric patients separately.  
Out of 3 patients, 2 patients completed the study and 1 patient discontinued due to unsatisfactory therapeutic 
effect. No efficacy conclusion can be drawn from the 3 pediatric patients enrolled in this study.  
Safety evaluation 
The most frequent AEs (>50% incidence by system organ class) reported during the treatment with 
deferasirox FCT were related to infections and infestations in 75.5% of patients (by PT influenza, rhinitis, 
gastroenteritis, pharyngitis and urinary tract infection occurred in >10% of patients) followed by GI disorders 
in 67.9% of patients (by PT diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain upper and abdominal pain occurred 
in >10% of patients). 
Approximately 50.9% of patients had a maximum AE grade of moderate and 26.4% of patients had a 
maximum AE grade of severe. None of the patients had severe gastrointestinal AEs. Maximum AE grading

incidence of moderate (22 patients and 5 patients; 41.5% and 9.4%) or severe (12 patients and 2 patients; 
22.6% and 3.8%) was reported among patients who have received deferasirox or any other ICT as prior 
chelation therapy. One patient (1.9%) died during the study. The cause of death was malignant melanoma 
with multiple metastasis in liver and spleen with unknown origin. Another contributing factor for death was 
liver failure and intrahepatic cholestasis. The event, death was not suspected to be treatment-related. A total 
of 13 patients (24.5%) had SAEs and no single SAE occurred in more than one patient. None of the SAEs 
were considered treatment-related. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment were 
reported in 4 patients (7.5%); one patient each had drug ineffective AE (1.9%) and serum ferritin abnormal 
AE (1.9%) considered to be treatment-related and led to discontinuation of study treatment. 
Under AE of special interest grouping (>5% incidence), the special AE grouping term in which the majority 
patients had reported events was renal disorders (increased serum creatinine, acute renal failure, renal 
tubular disorder, acquired Fanconi's syndrome; 15 patients, 28.3%), mostly driven by urine protein-
creatinine ratio increased (8 patients, 15.1%), proteinuria and blood creatinine increased (4 patients each PT, 
7.5%). Under increased liver transaminases, hepatic failure, hepatitis (excluding infections) AE group term; 
hyper transaminasaemia PT was reported in 4 patients (7.5%). Increases in serum creatinine and liver 
function tests were observed in some patients, and those increases were consistent with the known safety 
profile of deferasirox FCT; worst post baseline elevations in serum creatinine of >ULN at 2 consecutive 
measurements at least 7 days apart occurred in 2 patients (3.8%). 
Two patients (3.8%) had a worst post baseline ALT/SGPT level in the notable range (>5 times ULN and 2 
times baseline value). Elevations of transaminases (AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT) >10 times ULN were uncommon 
(1.9%); only one patient (1.9%) had a post baseline increase in AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT values >10 times 
ULN and >2 times above baseline. 
No patients had clinically significant ECG or ocular abnormalities. One patient had a clinically significant 
abnormality in audiometric examination at baseline and another patient had a clinically significant 
abnormality at baseline and during the study. Notable changes in systolic blood pressure (≤ 90 mmHg and 
decrease ≥ 20 mmHg; 4 patients, 7.5%) and diastolic blood pressure (≤ 50 mm of Hg and decrease ≥ 15 
mmHg; 3 patients, 5.7%) values were observed in few patients and these values returned to normal in few 
days. Increase in body weight ≥ 7% was observed in 43 patients (81.1%).  
In this study 66% of percent of patients (35 of 53) were female, and most of them (56.6%; 30 of 53) are of 
childbearing potential. Three patients reported positive urine test for pregnancy during the study, although 
women of child-bearing potential were informed (about unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur 
during the study and need for adherence to the contraception requirement for the duration of the study) and 
trained when checked by site. Two of these were discontinued and another patient had spontaneous abortion. 
The event, spontaneous abortion was reported as an AE, moderate in severity and not treatment related. The 
study drug dosage was temporarily interrupted due to the event, spontaneous abortion. 
Pediatric patients 
All 3 pediatric patients experienced at least one AE which were mild to moderate in severity. All AEs were 
resolved except two AEs (Patient ITA-1276-00005: Asthenia [mild], Patient ITA-1276-00011: serum ferritin 
abnormal [moderate]) which were ongoing at the time of last reporting. None of the AEs were considered as 
related to the study drug except serum ferritin increased by ITA-1276-00008 and serum ferritin abnormal 
experienced by Patient -ITA-1276-00011. The most common AEs experienced by all pediatric patients were

asthenia and pharyngitis. None of the pediatric patients experienced any serious adverse event (SAE) or died 
during the study. In a single patient (Patient ITA-1276-00011), study treatment was discontinued 
permanently due to AE serum ferritin abnormal. 
None of the pediatric patients had clinically significant abnormalities observed for laboratory parameters, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, audiometric, and ocular examination. All pediatric patients had notable 
≥7% increase in weight (Week 2 to Month 26) (assessment was not done at Months 6, 8, and 25) for Patient 
ITA-1276-00005, Month 5 to Month 8  for  Patient ITA-1276-00008, and Month 11 to Month 16 for Patient 
ITA-1276-00011). 
In this study, Patient ITA-1276-00005 received 74 units of packed RBC, with the total volume of blood 
transfused being 18685 mL; Patient ITA-1276-00008 received 129 units of packed RBC, with the total 
volume of blood transfused being 33151 mL and Patient ITA-1276-00011 received 40 units of packed RBC, 
with the total volume of blood transfused being 9114 mL. 
None of the reported AEs was considered suspected except serum ferritin increased by ITA-1276-00008 and 
serum ferritin abnormal experienced by Patient ITA-1276-00011. 
No changes to the pediatric information of the current deferasirox Core Data Sheet (CDS) are proposed as a 
result of this study and no regulatory consequences of the submitted study are anticipated for the pediatric 
information in the EU SmPC. The benefit-risk assessment for deferasirox is considered to remain positive for 
the currently approved indications in pediatric and in overall population. 
CHMP comment: 
The primary safety objective of the study was to evaluate the overall safety of deferasirox film-coated tablet 
(FCT) formulation in patients with transfusion dependent thalassemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  
A total of 53 patients were enrolled in the present study, of those 3 patients (5.7%) were under the age of 18 
years (13, 15 and 16 years respectively) and 50 patients (94.3%) were aged ≥ 18 years. All the 3 patients 
aged <18 years had thalassemia as their main underlying disease. 
Almost all patients (98.1%) reported at least one adverse event. The majority (>30%) of patients had AEs in 
the infections and infestations SOC (75.5%), gastrointestinal disorders SOC (67.9%), general disorders and 
administration  site  conditions  SOC  (45.3%),  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  SOC  (37.7%), 
investigations,  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (32.1%  each  SOC)  and  nervous  system 
disorders SOC (30.2%). 
One patient (72 years) with MDS died during the study. 
Pediatric cases 
Case  1  was  about  a  16-years-old  male  patient  (ITA/1276_00005)  who  developed  nausea,  2  episodes  of 
moderate  cough,  pharyngitis  (low  grade),  moderate  chickenpox,  rhinitis  (low  grade),  asthenia  (low  grade), 
moderate  fever,  diarrhea  and  catarrhal  rhinitis  (low  grade  for  both  AEs).  Study  drug  was  pursued  and  the 
patient recovered from all AEs but Asthenia. 
Case  2  was  about  a  15-years-old  female  patient  (ITA/1276_00008)  who  developed  multiple  episodes  of 
osteomuscular  pain  (low  grade),  multiple  episodes  of  heart  burn  (low  grade),  irregular  menstrual  cycle,

moderate  or  low  grade  headaches,  shoulder  pain,  2  episodes  of  gastritis  (low  grade),  moderate  increase  in 
serum ferritin, inferior lumbar pain, stye, asthenia, vertigo, inferior limb pain [musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders], moderate flu like syndrome, mucositis of upper respiratory trast, palpitations, abdominal pain 
and left ipocondrium pain. Study drug was pursued and the patient recovered from all AEs. 
Case 3 was about a 13-years-old male patient (ITA-1276-00011) who developed transaminasemia, moderate 
insufficient  control  of  the  ferritin  value,  headache,  asthenia  and  moderate  pharyngitis.  Study  drug  was 
discontinued permanently due to serum ferritin abnormalities.  
With a majority of patients ≥ 18 years (94.3%) and only 3 (5.7%) pediatric patients, it is hard to draw any 
conclusion regarding the safety profile of deferasirox in both indications (transfusion dependent thalassemia or 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)) based on data provided from this study. However, information from the 3 
pediatric cases are in line with the known safety profile of Exjade.  
Overall, this interventional study does not bring any new relevant information on safety of deferasirox.  
3.  Overall conclusion 
The CICL670AIC04 study was an interventional study to collect additional data on safety and efficacy of 
Exjade® (deferasirox) film coated tablet (FCT) formulation in patients with transfusion dependent 
thalassemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (very low, low or intermediate risk) when treated over 24 
weeks in CICL670F2201 study. 
With a majority of patients ≥ 18 years (94.3%) and only 3 (5.7%) pediatric patients, it is hard to draw any 
conclusion regarding the efficacy and safety profile of deferasirox in both indications (transfusion dependent 
thalassemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)) based on data provided from this study. Information from 
the 3 pediatric cases are in line with the known safety profile of Exjade.  
Overall, this interventional study does not bring any new relevant information on safety and efficacy of 
deferasirox. No changes to the pediatric information of the current deferasirox Core Data Sheet (CDS) are 
proposed as a result of this study and no regulatory consequences of the submitted study are anticipated for 
the pediatric information in the EU SmPC. The benefit-risk assessment for deferasirox is considered to remain 
positive for the currently approved indications in pediatric and in overall population.

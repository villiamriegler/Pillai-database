2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
14 May 2015 
21 May 2015 
Golimumab is a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to both soluble and trans-membrane forms 
of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and inhibits TNFα bioactivity. Golimumab is classified according to 
the ATC Classification System as a TNFα inhibitor. Other members of this therapeutic class include 
infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol.

Simponi is approved for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ulcerative colitis (UC). 
Axial spondyloarthritis (Axial SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the axial skeleton typically 
manifested by chronic back pain, spinal inflammation, seropositivity for human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-B27, and extra-articular manifestations. Axial SpA encompasses both AS and non-radiographic 
axial spondyloarthritis (nr-Axial SpA), the latter of which includes patients with little to no changes in the 
sacroiliac joints on plain radiographs and thus do not meet modified New York criteria for AS. 
The Assessments in Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for classification of Axial SpA, 
are; Back pain of ≥3 month duration at age of onset <45, and either of the three is true: 1. The subject 
has active (acute) inflammation on MRI highly suggestive of sacroiliitis associated with SpA and in 
addition at least one of the below clinical features; 2. The subject has definitive sacroiliitis (grade ≥2 
bilaterally or ≥3 unilaterally) on x-ray and in addition at least one of the below clinical features; 3.  The 
subject is HLA B27 positive and has at least two further of the below clinical features. 
The clinical features include: HLA B27 positivity;-inflammatory back pain; arthritis; enthesitis;  uveitis; 
dactylitis; psoriasis; Crohn’s/colitis; elevated CRP; good response to NSAIDs in the past; family history 
for SpA. 
nr-Axial SpA is thus a subgroup of Axial SpA, consisting of those who do not meet criterion # 2 above. 
The modified NY criteria for AS (mNY) require x-ray findings of sacroiliitis grade ≥2 bilaterally or grade 
3-4 unilaterally. In addition, at least 1 of the 3 following clinical criteria must be fulfilled: 
- 
Low back pain and stiffness for more than 3 months that improves with exercise but is not 
relieved by rest. 
- 
- 
Limitation of motion of the lumbar spine in the sagittal and frontal planes. 
Limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values correlated for age and sex. 
Patients with nr-Axial SpA have substantial disease burden, similar to patients with AS, who have 
relatively longer disease duration. Progression from nr-Axial SpA to AS occurs in approximately 10% of 
patients within the first 2 years from onset of symptoms and in approximately 60% of patients after 10 
year (Sampiano-Barros et al, Clin Rheumatol, 2001) The Assessment in Spondyloarthritis international 
Society (ASAS) has recommended use of TNFα antagonists in patients with active AS or nr-Axial SpA, 
following failure of at least 2 NSAIDs over a 4 week period or intolerance to such agents (van der Heijde 
et al, Ann Rheum Dis 2011). TheTNFα antagonists adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept are 
approved for the treatment of nr-Axial SpA.  
With this variation, the MAH sought to add the following new indication to the product information:  
“Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-Axial SpA) 
Simponi is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe, active non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) 
and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to, or are 
intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)”. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The proposed indication for golimumab for the treatment of nr-Axial SpA is supported by the results of an 
on-going single, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (P07642). 
This submission focuses on: 
• 
Efficacy data through Week 16 (the placebo-controlled period) and through Week 24 from P07642. 
The main focus is on 16-week data describing the efficacy of golimumab in the improvement of signs and 
symptoms of disease, spinal mobility, inflammation as measured by MRI, physical function, and 
health-related quality of life. Data from the open label period through Week 24 demonstrate the 
persistence of treatment effect. 
• 
• 
PK and immunogenicity data through Week 16 from P07642 
Safety data through the last data cut-off (06 May 2014) from P07642 is described 
comprehensively in 3 presentations:    
1. 
Comparisons of data from the P07642 study and the combined AS studies (C0524T09 and 
C0524T29) dataset. 
2. 
Comparisons of data from the P07642 study and the large datasets derived from the combined 
Phase 3 SC rheumatologic studies (AS, RA, and PsA).  
3. 
Comparisons of data from the P07642 study and overall dataset derived from the large, long term 
safety database for golimumab in AS, RA, PsA, UC and asthma studies as detailed in section 2.5 (Safety).  
There is no specific guideline for the development of medicinal products for the treatment of nr Axial SpA. 
The clinical study supporting this extension of indication is in line with the Guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of AS (CPMP/EWP/4891/03) with respect to study 
design, main efficacy endpoint, and secondary endpoints. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The PK of golimumab was evaluated in the Phase 3 study (Study P07642). 
Samples for golimumab concentration analysis were collected at Baseline (Week 0) and Week 16 before 
the administration of study medication. All samples from subjects randomized to placebo showed 
golimumab concentrations <0.039 μg/mL, the lower limit of quantification for the assay. 
Serum golimumab concentrations at Week 16 were evaluated in 2 populations: all subjects treated and 
the objective signs of inflammation (OSI) subpopulation, which was defined as subjects with baseline 
evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI and/or screening CRP level >ULN. 
Median golimumab concentrations at Week 16 for the OSI population were the same to the all treated 
population (0.8 and 0.8 μg/mL, respectively). 
An analysis of trough serum golimumab concentrations by weight quartiles was performed for Study 
P07642 and a trend in lower concentrations for subjects in the higher weight quartiles were observed. 
Study C0524T09 was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (through 
Week 24) study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical pharmacology of golimumab 50 mg or 
100 mg administered as SC injections Q4W in adult subjects with active AS. 
Trough serum golimumab concentrations achieved steady state by Week 12 and were approximately 
proportional to dose after SC administrations of golimumab 50 mg Q4W and 100 mg Q4W. At Week 12, 
the median steady-state trough concentrations were 0.6 μg g/mL and 1.1 μg g/mL in the 50 mg and 100 
mg groups, respectively. Serum trough golimumab concentrations from Week 52 were generally 
maintained through Week 256 and were similar to the observed median serum golimumab concentrations 
observed at Week 24. 
An analysis of trough serum golimumab concentrations by weight quartiles performed for the original 
submission and a trend in lower concentrations for subjects in the higher weight quartiles were observed.

Impact of weight  
In P07642, the effect of body weight on PK was examined by weight quartile and body-weight cut at 100 
kg (Table 1). When serum golimumab concentrations were evaluated by weight quartiles, subjects in the 
higher weight quartile tended to have lower serum concentrations than those in the lower weight quartile. 
This trend was also seen in similar analyses conducted for the 5 Phase 3 AS, RA, and PsA studies. Subjects 
with body weights >100 kg tended to have lower serum golimumab concentrations than subjects with 
body weights ≤100 kg. Due to the small number of golimumab-treated subjects weighing >100 kg (n=6) 
in P07642, weight-based PK/efficacy analyses were not performed. However, in previous 
efficacy-by-body weight analyses done for the rheumatological indications, a trend toward a decreased 
response rate with increasing weight was observed when comparing subjects who weighed ≤100 kg with 
those weighing >100 kg.  
Table 1 Summary of Steady-state Serum Golimumab Concentrations (μg/mL) after 50 mg 
golimumab SC at Week 16 by 100kg weight cut-off; Subjects Treated With Golimumab in 
Study P07642 
Impact of immunogenicity 
In Study P07642, antibodies to golimumab were evaluated at Week 0 and Week 16. The overall incidence 
of antibodies to golimumab in subjects with nr-Axial SpA in P07642 through Week 16 was 4.3% (4/93). 
A similar result was observed in subjects with AS in C0524729 study, where antibodies to golimumab 
were evaluated at Week 0 and Week 24. The incidence of antibodies to golimumab was 5.7% (5/87). For 
subjects who were positive for antibodies to golimumab, 100% were positive for neutralizing antibodies 
through Week 16 and Week 24 in P07642 and C0524T09, respectively. Serum golimumab concentrations 
were generally low in those subjects who were classified as positive for antibodies to golimumab. All 
subjects in P07642 who were positive for antibodies to golimumab (and neutralizing antibodies), 
sufficient efficacy was observed despite their exposures being at the lower limit of quantification when 
measured at Week 16. This suggested that development of immunogenic response had little impact on 
efficacy. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of golimumab has been described previously in healthy subjects and in patients 
with RA as described in the product information. In summary, the median time to reach maximum serum 
concentrations ranged from 2 to 6 days following subcutaneous administration. Following a single 
subcutaneous injection of 100 mg, the absorption of golimumab was similar in the upper arm, abdomen, 
and thigh, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 51%. Golimumab exhibits approximately dose 
proportional PK. The average volume of distribution (V) has been shown to be 115 mL/kg and systemic 
clearance (CL) of golimumab was estimated to be 6.9 mL/day/kg. Terminal half-life was estimated to be 
approximately 12 days in healthy subjects and similar values were observed in patients with RA, PsA, AS, 
or UC. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/422136/2015  
Page 10/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a limited number of RA patients treated with subcutaneous golimumab over a 6-month period, 
concomitant use of MTX reduced the apparent clearance of golimumab by approximately 36%. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that concomitant use of NSAIDs, oral corticosteroids or sulfasalazine 
did not influence the apparent clearance of golimumab. 
The PK of golimumab was evaluated in the Phase 3 study (Study P07642) in patients with nr-Axial SpA. 
PK samples for serum golimumab concentration were collected from all subjects at Day1, Week 16 and 
Week 52. The same serum samples were used for the measurement of golimumab concentrations and 
detection of antibodies to golimumab. Serum samples were analyzed for golimumab concentrations using 
a validated electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) on a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) Platform. 
The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) with the MSD platform was 0.039 μg/mL at a 1:5 dilution. Serum 
samples for the detection of antibodies to golimumab were analyzed using a validated enzyme 
immunoassay (EIA). The bioanalytical methods have been used in previous SC studies and therefore been 
described in detail in previous submissions.  
The steady-state median golimumab concentration for all subjects treated with golimumab 50 mg was 
0.8 μg/mL. These concentration values were consistent with those observed in AS Study C0524T09 and 
were within the range of steady-state golimumab concentrations observed in the other rheumatological 
indications. The results suggested that golimumab exposure is similar between the nr-Axial SpA 
population and populations in other rheumatologic indications, thus supporting consistency in posology 
across the rheumatologic indications. 
Due to similarity in the median steady-state concentrations at Week 16 between nr-Axial SpA and AS, and 
dose linearity previously established for SC golimumab from 50 mg to 400 mg, it is expected that this 
trend in efficacy seen in the rheumatological indications may also occur in nr-Axial SpA. Therefore, the 
MAH proposed posology consistent with the approved posology for the other rheumatologic indications. 
This was agreed by the CHMP. 
Antibodies to golimumab were evaluated at Week 0 and Week 16 for Study P07642. The overall incidence 
of antibodies to golimumab in subjects with nr-Axial SpA in P07642 through Week 16 was 4.3% (4/93). 
This incidence was stated to be similar to the incidence in subjects with AS in Study C0524T09 through 
Week 24 (5.7%, 5/87) and in subjects with other rheumatologic diseases. 
In P07642, the 4 subjects positive for antibodies to golimumab were also positive for neutralizing 
antibodies through Week 16. Serum golimumab concentrations were below the limit of detection at Week 
16 for all 4 subjects. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of golimumab has been adequately studied to support the use in patients with 
nr-Axial SpA. The correlation between exposure and weight appears to be similar to that in previously 
studied patient populations and the proposal regarding dosing in patients weighing >100 kg is adequately 
supported.

Treatments 
This study randomized 198 subjects in a 1:1 ratio to either the golimumab treatment arm (Arm A, 50mg 
SC Q4W) or the placebo treatment arm (Arm B). The 50 mg SC Q4W dose regimen was selected for 
evaluation in the nr-Axial SpA (P07642)study to be consistent with the approved regimen for the 
treatment of other rheumatologic diseases (RA, PsA, and AS) globally. Precedence for this approach 
exists with the anti-TNF inhibitors etanercept, adalimumab and certolizumab, which all dose nr-Axial SpA 
patients with the same dose as AS patients. 
Subjects were allowed to remain on a stable daily dose of NSAIDS during this study as long as this dosage 
was initiated at least 30 days prior to Screening. A new NSAID could not be initiated until Week 16; 
however NSAIDs could be initiated after Week 16 at the investigator’s discretion. In addition, the 
following medications could be initiated after Week 16 at the investigator’s discretion: methotrexate, 
sulfasalazine, or hydroxycholoroquine. Intra-articular, tendon sheath, or bursal corticosteroid injections

of subjects who achieve Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 50 response at 
Week 16. (3)To evaluate the treatment effect of golimumab 50 mg compared to placebo as measured by 
the proportion of subjects who achieve ASAS partial remission at Week 16. (4)To evaluate the treatment 
effect of golimumab 50 mg compared to placebo by the change in the Spondyloarthritis Research 
Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) MRI SI joints score from Baseline to Week 16. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was proportion of subjects achieving ASAS 20 response at Week 16. 
ASAS-20 is defined as meeting both criteria: 
1.  An improvement of ≥20% from Baseline and an absolute improvement from Baseline of ≥10 mm 
in at least 3 of the following 4 domains: 
a)  Patient global assessment 
b)  Pain (total back pain) 
c)  Function (BASFI)

d)  Inflammation (average of the last 2 questions of the BASDAI concerning 
morningstiffness) 
2.  Absence of deterioration from Baseline (≥20% and an absolute change of ≥10 mm) in the 
potential remaining domain. 
Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved

The BASDAI is a validated self-reported instrument which consists of six 10-unit horizontal NRSs to 
measure severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning 
stiffness (both severity and duration, respectively) over the last week. The final BASDAI score ranges 
from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity. BASDAI 50 response is defined as 
improvement by at least 50% from baseline in BASDAI 
ASAS Partial Remission is defined as a VAS score of less than 20mm in each of the 4 domains of ASAS 
20

The BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index) is the function domain of ASAS measures. is 
reported as a mean (VAS, 0 to 10 cm) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the functional anatomy of the 
subject and 2 of which relate to the subject’s ability to cope with everyday life. 
The BASMI is a score comprising 5 measures of hip and spinal mobility: 
1. Tragus-to-wall 
2. Lumbar flexion (modified Schober test) 
3. Cervical rotation 
4. Lateral lumbar side flexion 
5. Maximal intermalleolar distance. 
The 5 continuous measurements are used in conjunction with a scoring system to obtain a score on a 
scale of 0 to 10. The final BASMI score is the mean of the 5 scores. The higher the score, the more severe 
the patient’s limitation of movement. 
ASAS 5/6 is defined as a 20% improvement in any 5 of the following 6 domains: pain (VAS 0 to 10 cm), 
patient global (VAS 0 to 10 cm), function (BASFI score), morning stiffness (BASDAI, average of questions 
5 and 6), CRP, and spine mobility (lumber side flexion). 
The ASDAS-C is a composite index to assess disease activity in AS. It combines the following 5 disease 
activity variables into a single score: back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global score, 
peripheral pain/swelling, and CRP. An ASDAS-C score of < 1.3 has been defined as inactive disease or 
clinical remission.  
The WPAI measured time missed from work, impairment of work, and impairment of regular activities 
due to overall health and symptoms. The WPAI is assessed relative to measures of general health 
perceptions, role (physical), role (emotional), pain, symptom severity, global measures of work, and 
interference with regular activity. 
The MASES is an index to measure enthesitis and the evaluation consists of measures at 13 sites, which 
are scored as 0 or 1 (0 – non tender, 1 tender). It is the sum of all site scores (from 0 to13). 
Sample size 
Study P07642 was expected to randomize approximately 200 subjects. 
For the primary endpoint, with the planned sample size of 100 subjects per group, there is at least 95% 
power to detect a 26% treatment difference between golimumab 50 mg and placebo (2-sided, overall 
a=0.050), assuming the true response rate for the placebo group is 25%. The placebo response rate was 
estimated based on the pivotal golimumab study in AS.  
Randomisation 
One-hundred and ninety-eight subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the golimumab treatment 
arm (Arm A) or the placebo treatment arm (Arm B). 197 subjects were treated. 
Subjects were stratified based on whether they had evidence of sacroiliitis (active inflammation) on MRI 
of the sacroiliac joint (yes/no) and CRP level (≤ ULN/ > ULN [0.9mg/dL]). Subjects without evidence of 
sacroiliitis on MRI were limited to 50% of the total enrolled population. Subjects with a normal CRP level 
at screening (according to the central lab) were limited to 60% of total enrolled.

Central confirmation of subject x-ray eligibility and MRI stratification was based on a single reading of 
Screening Visit x-rays and MRI scans of the SI joints, respectively. Readers were blinded to treatment 
assignment, clinical information, and results of investigator readings. Stratification for presence of MRI 
sacroiliitis at screening based on ASAS MRI criteria18 was undertaken for subjects not meeting modified 
New York criteria. Central evaluation of changes in SI joint inflammation (for the key secondary endpoint) 
was performed by duplicate independent readings of MRI scans for each subject. The readers were 
additionally blinded to the chronological order of the scans and the scores of other readers. Scoring of the 
SI joints utilized the SPARCC scoring system. Discrepancies between the two readers were adjudicated by 
a third reader. 
Blinding (masking) 
Part 1 was a double-blind period, with in-house blinding. The investigator, study nurse, study participant, 
and sponsor personnel remained blinded to the treatment group assignments. An Interactive Voice 
Response System (IVRS)/ Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) was used to maintain the blind. 
Data that could potentially unblind the treatment assignment (i.e., CRP values and MRI scores) were 
masked prior to unblinding. 
Part 2 was open-label. 
Central confirmation of subject x-ray eligibility and MRI stratification was based on a single reading of 
Screening Visit x-rays and MRI scans of the SI joints, respectively. Readers were blinded to treatment 
assignment, clinical information, and results of investigator readings. Stratification for presence of MRI 
sacroiliitis at screening based on ASAS MRI criteria18 was undertaken for subjects not meeting modified 
New York criteria. Central evaluation of changes in SI joint inflammation (for the key secondary endpoint) 
was performed by duplicate independent readings of MRI scans for each subject. The readers were 
additionally blinded to the chronological order of the scans and the scores of other readers. Scoring of the 
SI joints utilized the SPARCC scoring system. Discrepancies between the two readers were adjudicated by 
a third reader. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy Analysis of the Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint,  the proportion of ASAS 20 responders at Week 16, using the FAS 
population was evaluated using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with baseline evidence of 
sacroiliitis on MRI (yes or no) and screening CRP level (≤ULN/ >ULN [0.9 mg/dL]) as the stratification 
factors. 
Two supportive analyses were performed on the primary endpoint. One used the Per-Protocol Population 
and the other considered subjects who discontinued due to an AE as non-responders. 
Efficacy Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
Part 1 
The binary response type secondary variables were evaluated in the same way as the primary variable. 
The change from Baseline in the SPARCC MRI SI joint score was compared between golimumab 50 mg 
and placebo using the Mann-Whitney test.  
Other continuous secondary variables were evaluated using a constrained longitudinal data analysis 
(cLDA) model proposed by Liang and Zeger. The analysis model included terms for treatment, week, 
baseline evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI (yes or no), screening CRP level (≤ULN/ > ULN) and treatment by 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

week interaction. The treatment difference in terms of mean change from baseline at Week 16 was 
estimated and tested from this model. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the 
correlation among repeated measurements.  
If the continuous variables were not considered to be normally distributed, then a nonparametric test, 
such as Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed. 
Part 2 
Subjects who successfully completed Part 1 (Weeks 0-16), were eligible to participate in Part 2 (Weeks 
16-60) of the trial.  All subjects in Part 2 received golimumab 50 mg SC at Week 16 (after completion of 
all visit assessments), and every 4 weeks thereafter, with the final dose administered at Week 48.  A final 
efficacy assessment will be performed after Week 52 as well as a final safety assessment at Week 60, 12 
weeks after the last dose of study treatment is targeted to be administered. 
To assess the long-term treatment effect, descriptive statistics of the efficacy endpoints for the FAS 
population (counts and percentages for binary response type variables; mean, standard deviation [SD], 
median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables) were tabulated by treatment group 
(golimumab 50 mg/ golimumab 50 mg, placebo/ golimumab 50 mg) at each visit. 
Multiplicity adjustment for Type I error control was implemented in the Part 1 analyses using a closed 
testing procedure to control the overall α level at 0.05 for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The 
primary endpoint was tested first and if significant, was followed by tests of the key secondary endpoints 
in the order presented. Efficacy results will be considered statistically significant after consideration of the 
strategy for controlling the Type I error. All statistical tests were conducted at the alpha=0.05 (2-sided) 
level. 
Both the multiplicity method and the primary and key secondary endpoint analyses were prespecified in 
the protocol. 
Efficacy Analysis Populations 
The primary (overall) population for efficacy analyses is called the efficacy Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
population (also referred to as the All Treated [AT] population; n=197 in Part 1); the safety population 
consists of all subjects as treated (n=197 in Part 1). A per protocol population is also defined (n=174 in 
Part 1).  The subgroup population consisting of subjects with evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI and/or 
screening CRP level >upper limit of normal is referred to as the OSI population (n=158) and is the same 
subgroup for both efficacy and safety analyses. Efficacy analysis populations in P07642 are outlined in

Definition 
Excludes  subjects  based  on  a  set  of 
pre-specified  criteria  (e.g.  violations  on 
the  exclusion  and  inclusion  criteria,  low 
medication compliance/adherence, or use 
of  prohibited  medications  during  Part  1) 
that may substantially affect or confound 
the  measures  of  efficacy  or  the  intended 
claims for the compound.  
The  subset  of  FAS  subjects  who  had 
elevated  CRP  and/  or  MRI  evidence  of 
sacroiliitis at randomization. 
The  subset  of  FAS  subjects  who  had 
normal  CRP  and  no  MRI  evidence  of 
sacroiliitis at randomization. 
For the ASAS related endpoints at Week 16 (ASAS 20, ASAS 40, ASAS 5/6, and ASAS partial remission), 
if subjects were missing all of the ASAS components at Week 16, they were considered to not have 
achieved the primary endpoint. Zero-divisor and component-wise missing data rules also applied. 
For BASDAI 50, if the subject had no observation at Week 16, then the last non-missing observation prior 
to Week 16, including the Baseline value, was carried forward to Week 16. The missing data at other 
timepoints, such as Week 24 and Week 52, were imputed similarly. 
In case of missing BASFI responses at a specific timepoint, the mean score was based on the available 
data from a minimum of 5 questions. In case of missing BASMI responses at a specific timepoint, the 
mean score was based on the available data from a minimum of 3 components. Otherwise, BASFI or 
BASMI were considered missing at that timepoint. Only observed data were used in the analyses and 
summaries, no missing data were imputed. 
In addition, subjects who met any one of the treatment failure criteria prior to Week 16 had the change 
from Baseline set to 0 at Week 16. No treatment failure rule was used for BASFI or BASMI at timepoints 
after Week 16. 
ASDAS-C was calculated if all the components were non-missing. Otherwise, ASDAS-C was considered 
missing. Only observed data were used in the analyses and summaries, no missing data were imputed. 
Component-wise missing data rules:  
1. For any ASAS component, if the component value is missing from baseline through Week 16, then 0% 
will be assigned for the percent improvement from baseline of that component; 
2. If the subject has a baseline value but no observation at Week 16, then the last non-missing 
observation prior to Week 16, including the baseline value, will be carried forward to Week 16; 
3. If the baseline value is missing for a component, but a post-baseline value is observed prior to or at 
Week 16, then the median component value from all subjects with baseline data in the same stratum 
(defined based on the baseline MRI and CRP) will be used to impute the baseline value.  
The missing data at other timepoints, such as Week 24 and Week 52 will be imputed similarly as described 
above.

For all other continuous endpoints only observed data were used in the analyses and summaries, no 
missing data were imputed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 393 subjects screened for inclusion in the study, a total of 198 subjects were randomized, with 98 
assigned to receive golimumab 50 mg and 100 assigned to placebo.  One hundred and ninety of the 198 
(96.0%) randomized subjects completed the placebo-controlled period of the study (Part 1 through Week 
16). 
Figure 2:  P07642 Study Subject Disposition Part 1 
At the time of the database lock, 187 subjects (94.4%) had completed treatment through Week 24; 155 
subjects (78.3%) had completed treatment through Week 52 in the open-label period of the study (Part 
2), 24 (12.1%) had discontinued the study, and 21 (10.6%) subjects were ongoing in Part 2. 
Recruitment 
Subjects were randomized at 52 study centers in 13 countries worldwide (Western Europe, Eastern 
Europe and North America). Enrollment at each study center ranged from 1 to 12 subjects.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol violators were identified prior to the first unblinding of the database and were excluded from the 
Per-Protocol analysis. The Per-Protocol population excluded 23 subjects based on a set of prespecified 
criteria; 13 from the golimumab 50 mg group and 10 from the placebo group. Excluded subjects included 
8 (4%) subjects with violations on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, 9 (4.5%) subjects with low 
medication compliance or early discontinuation from Part 1 (subjects did not receive all 4 doses of study 
medication), 4 (2%) subjects with use of prohibited medications or unstable NSAID use (change in dose, 
initiation of a new NSAID or discontinuation of NSAID) 
One subject was identified as not meeting inclusion criterion 3 for nr-Axial SpA diagnosis because the 
subject did not have sacroiliitis on MRI and was HLA-B27 negative. This was not discovered until after the 
data base lock, therefore, this subject was still included in the per-protocol analysis. 
Eight sites reported having visual analogue scales that were not the standard 100 mm length. A full 
investigation was conducted and corrected scales provided. A mathematical formula was used to convert 
the values recorded on the incorrect scales to the standard scale length. 
Baseline data 
Of the 198 randomized subjects, 57% were men. All subjects were White, with an average age of 31 years. 
Demographic and subject characteristics were generally similar between the treatment groups; however, 
there was a numerically higher proportion of women in the placebo (48.0%) than in the golimumab group 
(37.8%).  
Baseline disease characteristics were also similar between treatment groups and indicative of a 
population with nr-Axial SpA. More than 80% of subjects were HLA-B27 positive (82.7% in the 
golimumab 50 mg group, 82% in the placebo group). Mean BASDAI scores of 6.6 cm in the golimumab 50 
mg group and 6.4 cm in the placebo group were consistent with substantial disease activity. Mean 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score CRP (ASDAS-C) scores were 3.6 and 3.5 in the golimumab 
and placebo groups, respectively. Two thirds of subjects had a positive MRI (evidence of sacroiliitis on the 
screening; 67.3% in the golimumab group, 66.0% in the placebo group), and 40.8% of subjects in the 
golimumab group and 41% in the placebo group had elevated CRP (mean 1.52 mg/dL, golimumab; mean 
1.29 mg/dL, placebo). Elevated CRP was defined as CRP above the central laboratory upper limit of 
normal (0.9 mg/dL).

Demographic and subject characteristics and most baseline disease characteristics in the OSI population 
were similar between the treatment groups and generally similar to those of the overall population. As 
expected, there were differences between the overall and OSI populations in terms of baseline MRI SI 
Joint scores and CRP levels, given the definition of the OSI population. Mean Baseline SPARCC MRI SI 
Joint levels were 11.3 vs. 14.1 in the overall and OSI populations, respectively, and mean Baseline CRP 
scores were 1.40 mg/dL vs. 1.68 mg/dL in the overall and OSI populations, respectively. 
Numbers analysed 
Part 1 efficacy data were evaluated separately from those of Part 2. At the time of Stage 1 lock, all 
subjects had completed Week 24. Efficacy analyses were performed using the FAS, Per Protocol, and OSI 
populations. Safety analyses were performed using the ASaT population. Part 1 safety data were 
evaluated separately from those of Part 2. In addition, cumulative exposure-adjusted AE incidence was 
provided from randomization to the end of the trial to evaluate the longer term (60 weeks) safety profile. 
Some subjects were ongoing in Part 2 and their data were analysed up to May 6, 2014 when the final 
subject completed their Week 24 visit.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint analysis 
The primary endpoint, ASAS 20 response at Week 16, was analysed using the FAS population, consisting 
of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment in Part 1 (n=197).  
The primary objective was achieved. A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the golimumab 50 
mg group achieved ASAS 20 response compared with subjects in the placebo group (71.1% vs 40.0% in 
the golimumab 50 mg and placebo groups respectively, p<0.0001; Table 5).

No subjects met the treatment failure criteria prior to Week 16; however, 7 subjects were analysed as 
non-responders because they discontinued prior to Week 16: 4 (2%) in the golimumab 50 mg group and 
3 (1.5%) in the placebo group. 
The treatment effects of golimumab 50 mg versus placebo across most of the subgroups based on 
demographics and baseline disease characteristics were consistent with the treatment effect observed in 
the FAS population. In the subgroup analysis based on stratification factors, no treatment benefit was 
observed for subjects with the combination of negative MRI and CRP within normal limits at baseline.  
Sensitivity Analyses 
To test the robustness of the primary analysis, a sensitivity analyses in which subjects who discontinued 
due to an AE were considered non-responders was performed. The results are identical to those based on 
the primary approach since in both approaches subjects who discontinued prior to Week 16 were 
considered non-responders. 
Per protocol analyses 
The per protocol population excluded 23 subjects based on a set of pre-specified criteria, 13 from the 
golimumab 50 mg group and 10 from the placebo group. The subjects who met pre-specified criteria 
included 8 (4%) with violations on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, 9 (4.5%) with low medication 
compliance or early discontinuation from Part I (since these subjects did not receive all 4 doses of study 
medication), 4 (2%) for use of prohibited medications or unstable NSAID use (i.e. change in dose, 
initiation of a new NSAID or discontinuation of NSAID) during Part 1 and 3 (2%) with a large visit window 
between visits. One subject was counted in two criteria.

Efficacy at Week 24 
At Week 16, subjects on placebo switched to open-label golimumab 50 mg Q4W. In this study, 190 
subjects completed Part 1 and 187 subjects completed through Week 24. 
Of the 69 golimumab 50 mg/golimumab 50 mg subjects who achieved ASAS 20 response at Week 16, 66 
(95.7%) achieved ASAS 20 response at Week 24. Twelve of 24 (50.0%) subjects who did not have an 
ASAS 20 response at Week 16 were responders at Week 24

Overall, the proportion of subjects with an ASAS 20 response in the group randomized to golimumab 50 
mg increased from 71.1% at Week 16 to 83.9% at Week 24. The proportion of subjects with ASAS 40 
response in the golimumab group increased from 56.7% at Week 16 to 73.1%, and BASDAI 50 response 
increased from 57.7% at Week 16 to 75.3% at Weeks 24.The proportion of subjects with ASAS partial 
remission response in the golimumab group increased from 33.0% at Week 16 to and 41.9% at Week 24. 
The proportion of subjects with ASDAS-C Inactive disease/ clinical remission (<1.3) increased 
from 33.0% at Week 16 to 40.9% at Week 24 in the golimumab group.

Ancillary analyses 
Four (4.3%) subjects developed antibodies to golimumab 50 mg through Week 16.  All 4 subjects 
achieved ASAS20 at Week 16.  This suggests that development of immunogenic response had little 
impact on efficacy. 
Treatment comparisons for pre-specified subgroups defined by demographic, baseline characteristics and 
stratification factors on ASAS 20 and ASAS 40 responder rates were performed.  These included: gender, 
age (>30 yrs and <=30yrs), weight (<=median, 76 kg, >median, 76 kg), BASDAI score (<=median, 
6.35 cm >median, 6.35 cm), HLA-B27 status, use of NSAIDS, region (Western Europe and US, Eastern 
Europe), MRI (positive, negative) and CRP status (≤ULN, >ULN [0.9 mg/dL]).  Differences between 
treatment groups, along with 95% CIs and p-values were calculated. No multiplicity control was applied 
to these statistical tests; results must be interpreted with caution.

Figure 3: Difference in Percent ASAS 20 Responder Status at Week 16 by Baseline Factors Point Estimate 
and 95% Confidence Interval GLM 50mg versus Placebo Full-Analysis-Set Population (Part 1) 
ASAS 20 responses favouring golimumab 50 mg over placebo were observed in most subgroups with the 
exception of subjects with the combination of negative MRI and CRP within normal limits at baseline.  For 
this subgroup, no difference in the ASAS 20 response rate between golimumab 50 mg and placebo was 
seen. ASAS 40 responses favouring golimumab 50 mg over placebo were observed in all subgroups. 
OSI Population 
The OSI population consisted of 158 subjects (80 % of all treated subjects). 
The proportions of subjects in the OSI population who achieved ASAS 20, ASAS40, BASDAI 50 and ASAS 
Partial Remission at Week 16 are presented in Table 17. The proportion of responders was significantly 
greater in the golimumab 50 mg group than in the placebo group for all of these measures (p<0.0001 for 
ASAS 20, ASAS 40, BASDAI 50; p=0.0204 for ASAS partial remission).  
The SPARCC MRI SI joints score had significantly greater reduction from baseline in the golimumab 50 mg 
group than in the placebo group at Week 16 (p<0.0001). 
Other secondary endpoints were analyzed for the OSI population at Week 16.  For all these endpoints, a 
significant treatment benefit was observed for subjects in the OSI population treated with golimumab 50 
mg versus placebo.  
The magnitude of effect with golimumab in the OSI population was numerically similar to or greater than 
what was observed in the overall study population

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The proposed posology for Simponi is 50 mg given subcutaneously once a month. For patients 
weighing >100 kg the dose should be 100 mg. This is in line with the posology of the already approved 
AS-indication, and is endorsed. 
The MAH has submitted one pivotal study, P07642. In total, 198 subjects, whereof 125 subjects from EU 
representing 63% of all subjects, 63 subjects from Russia, and Turkey (32%) and 10 from US (5%) were 
randomized.

The included subjects were to have a diagnosis of active Axial SpA showing no evidence of 
radiographically (x-ray) defined sacroiliitis with chronic back pain ≥3 months, and an inadequate 
response or intolerance to therapy with NSAIDs.  
Subjects were stratified based on whether they had active inflammation on MRI of the sacroiliac joint 
(yes/no) and CRP level (≤upper limit of normal/ >upper limit of normal). Subjects without evidence of 
sacroiliitis on MRI (using a central reader) were limited to 50% of the total enrolled population. Subjects 
with a normal CRP level at screening (according to the central lab) were limited to 60% of total enrolled. 
Treated subjects with baseline evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI and/or screening C-reactive protein (CRP) 
level >upper limit of normal (ULN; 0.9 mg/dL) made up the prespecified Objective signs of inflammation 
OSI population. 
The primary endpoint was ASAS20 response at Week 16. Key secondary endpoints were ASAS40, 
BASDAI50, ASAS partial remission and change from baseline in the SPARCC RI SI joint score. 
The design of the study is generally endorsed. The chosen primary endpoint is acceptable; however, 
ASAS40 is of greater interest, since this result is a realistic goal using the products currently on the 
market. Since this is a key secondary endpoint, the study design is acceptable. 
During the study, 8 sites reported having visual analogue scales that were not the standard 100 mm 
length. Twelve patents were affected, whereof 2 were randomized. A full investigation was conducted, a 
mathematical conversion of the results was made and corrected scales provided. This is acceptable. 
The MAH pointed out that it was possible that a subject had a good response initially to NSAIDs, however, 
subsequently had inadequate response for 30 days or developed intolerance to NSAID therapy. This is 
reasonable to CHMP, and this inclusion criterion may be compatible with meeting the NSAID good 
response criterion for the diagnosis. 
It is noted that there seems to be a difference between males and females in achieving the primary 
endpoint as compared to placebo. This is seen also for ASAS40. The finding is noteworthy, since there was 
an imbalance between groups, with fewer females in the golimumab group. A similar outcome pattern has 
occurred with the age groups ≤30 and >30. The MAH has provided a weighted response analysis, showing 
that the gender and age imbalance between treatment groups did not have a substantial impact on the 
overall results. The overall size of the result is thus not considered to have been driven by the imbalance 
and potential effect difference in sex and age. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoints were met. The difference in the percentage of subjects that achieved ASAS 20 
response  at Week 16 between the groups  was 31.2% (71.1% vs 40.0% in the golimumab 50 mg and 
placebo groups respectively, p<0.0001). The primary endpoint analysis was also robust to the exclusion 
of subjects with pre-specified protocol deviations and to considering subjects who discontinued due to an 
adverse event as non-responders; the results for both the Per-protocol and sensitivity analyses were 
consistent with that based on the primary approach. The number of patients discontinuing prior to Week 
16 are evenly distributed for the two treatments, which is reassuring for the robustness of the primary 
results. However there was no information available in the study report about the amount of missing data 
on the component-wise level for patients remaining in study. Based on the data provided by the MAH the 
CHMP concluded that the impact of missing data on the evaluation results is small. 
All key secondary endpoints were met, the difference between groups in ASAS40 response at week 16 
was 33.8% (56.7% compared with the placebo group 23.0%; p<0.0001). Since this efficacy variable is 
considered as at least as important as the chosen primary endpoint ASAS20, a sensitivity test in form of 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/422136/2015  
Page 41/57 
 
 
 
 
 
analysis of the PP population for ASAS40 response at Week 16 was provided by the MAH and the 
robustness of the results was supported.  
The difference between groups in proportion of subjects achieving BASDAI50 was 28.0 (p <0.0001), 
ASAS Partial remission 15.2% (p<0.0001). The primary analysis of the change from baseline for SPARCC 
MRI was made on 161 subjects, since 10 subjects did not have baseline MRI, and 26 either missed Week 
16 MRI or performed it too late (more than 5 days after the start of part 2). The difference between groups 
was still significant.  
The treatment effects of golimumab 50 mg versus placebo across most of the subgroups based on 
demographics and baseline disease characteristics were consistent with the treatment effect observed in 
the FAS population. In the subgroup analysis based on stratification factors, no treatment benefit was 
observed for subjects with the combination of negative MRI and CRP within normal limits at baseline. 
Other endpoints that not were met were swollen and tender joint score respectively, or chest wall 
expansion. This is not unexpected, given the small number of inflamed peripheral joints in this population, 
(approximately 1.5 swollen and 3-4 tender). For chest wall expansion the MAH proposed that this may not 
be affected in this relatively early disease. This may be questioned, since the BL mean values are lower 
than what could be considered normal. However, the clinical significance is limited. 
It was noted that there seems to be a difference between males and females in achieving the primary 
endpoint as compared to placebo. This was seen also for ASAS40. The finding is noteworthy, since there 
was an imbalance between groups, with fewer females in the golimumab group. A similar outcome 
pattern has occurred with the age groups ≤30 and >30. The weighted-average responses for ASAS 20 
and ASAS 40, compared with the observed FAS population responses provided by the MAH indicated that 
the effect of the gender and age imbalance in the treatment assignments had minimal impact on the 
overall size of the treatment effect.  
Of the 69 golimumab 50 mg/golimumab 50 mg subjects who achieved ASAS 20 response at Week 16, 66 
(95.7%) achieved ASAS 20 response at Week 24. The corresponding figure for ASAS 40 response was 
92.7%, for BASDAI 50 91.1%, and for ASAS partial remission 90.6%. There was thus an acceptable 
persistence of the results achieved at Week 16.  
Four (4.3%) subjects developed antibodies to golimumab through Week 16. All 4 achieved ASAS20 at 
Week 16. The MAH argued that this suggests that development of immunogenic response had little 
impact on efficacy and has upon request provided key secondary endpoint results for these patients 
further supporting this. 
The magnitude of effect with golimumab in the OSI population was numerically similar to or greater than 
what was observed in the overall study population. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
One study has been presented, P07642, where 50mg SC Q4W was tested in comparison to placebo during 
a 16 week period. After week 16 all remaining subjects are treated open label, and the study is ongoing. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, the ASAS20 response at Week 16 was statistically significantly greater 
(p<0.001) in the active group (golimumab [71.1%] compared with the placebo group (40.0%). The 
difference to placebo (31.2%) is clinically relevant. Further, also the secondary endpoint ASAS40, which 
is considered more relevant for an anti-TNF agent, was met, with a difference to placebo of approximately 
33.8% at week 16. Other secondary analyses also support efficacy. Thus, the study results support the 
efficacy of golimumab in the nr Axial SpA population, regarding symptoms, spinal mobility and 
inflammation.

The MAH will conduct a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of golimumab (full or reduced treatment 
regimen) versus treatment withdrawal in subjects with nr Axial SpA who have attained inactive disease 
while receiving open-label golimumab and to characterise the efficacy of golimumab as retreatment upon 
flare in subjects with nr-Axial SpA (as described in the RMP). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of golimumab is well established as evidenced by available clinical study and 
post-authorization safety data and approvals of golimumab for AS, PsA, RA, and UC in adults. The most 
commonly reported ADR in clinical studies is upper respiratory tract infection. The most serious ADRs that 
have been reported for golimumab include serious infections (including sepsis, pneumonia, TB, invasive 
fungal and opportunistic infections), demyelinating disorders, lymphoma, HBV reactivation, CHF, 
autoimmune processes (lupus-like syndrome) and haematologic reactions. 
The discussion of safety in this submission focused on data in the indication of nr Axial SpA provided by 
the pivotal Phase 3b study P07642 through the data cutoff of 06 May 2014, the date the last subject 
completed the Week 24 visit. By that date, safety data were available through the end-of-study Week 60 
visit for more than 65% of subjects.  
In the submission, safety data from the P07642 study were also presented together with data from the 
combined AS studies (C0524T09 and C0524T29). In addition, the safety data of P07642 was integrated 
into the overall golimumab safety database upon which the safety data in the product information is 
derived. 
The safety data from the studies mentioned above were combined and presented in 3 different datasets 
as described below.  
• 
• 
Presentation 1: comparisons of data from the P07642 study and the combined AS studies dataset. 
This data presentation focused on the proportions of events for overall AEs (eg, AEs, SAEs, and 
discontinuations due to AEs) in each study and treatment group. 
Presentation 2 focused on comparisons of data from the P07642 study and the large datasets 
derived from the combined Phase 3 SC rheumatologic studies (AS, RA, and PsA). This data 
presentation focused on the incidence of events of interest in each study and treatment group.  
•  A third data presentation comprised data from the P07642 study and various datasets derived 
from studies of golimumab in other indications. This data presentation is used to support 
prescribing safety information and included all indications, both approved and unapproved, with 
the exceptions of uveitis and Sarcoidosis.

receiving golimumab and 68 subject years of follow-up for subjects while receiving placebo. 
Phase 3 SC Rheumatologic Studies and UC 
Data from the pooled Phase 3 SC studies in rheumatologic indications and UC includes 10 Phase 3 SC 
studies in rheumatologic indications and UC. 
Through the common placebo controlled period in these studies, 1146 subjects received placebo with 271 
subject years of follow up and 2702 subjects received golimumab with 651 subject years of follow up. 
Through the controlled and uncontrolled period in these studies, 1146 subjects received placebo with 557 
subject years of follow up and 3661 subjects received golimumab with 10,555 subject years of follow up. 
Adverse events 
 P07642 
Treatment with golimumab was generally well tolerated in subjects with nr-Axial SpA, with similar safety 
profiles observed in the placebo and golimumab 50 mg groups. Through the last data cut-off, no deaths, 
serious opportunistic infections, active tuberculosis, malignancies, or serious systemic hypersensitivity 
(including anaphylactic reactions) were reported. Two serious infections were reported in the golimumab 
group through the last data cut-off. 
Key safety results through Week 16 from P07642 are presented in Table 19.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
Through Week 16, there were 3 subjects with 1 or more SAEs: 2 subjects (2.0%) in the placebo group 
(back pain and cholelithiasis) and 1 subject (1.0%) in the golimumab 50 mg group (foetal death in the 
female partner of a male subject. 
Through the last data cut-off, a total of 8 subjects reported 1 or more SAEs, including 6 subjects receiving 
golimumab (3.1%;). SAEs reported after Week 16 were duodenitis, uterine polyp, staphylococcal 
infection, bacterial infection, and migraine. 
Deaths 
Through the last data cut-off, there were no deaths in the P07642 study in nr-Axial SpA. 
Other significant events 
Analyses of events of interest were performed for certain events (infections, serious infections, infections 
of interest, demyelination, malignancies, congestive heart failure, major adverse cardiovascular events 
[MACE], hypersensitivity reactions, serum sickness, anaphylactic reactions, and clinically important 
hepatobiliary events). These incidence rates are calculated based on the duration of the safety follow up, 
expressed as incidence per 100 subject-years to adjust for differences in safety follow-up.  
Serious infections 
Through Week 16, there were no serious infections in the placebo or golimumab 50 mg groups in the 
P07642 study and combined AS studies. 
Through the last data cutoff, there were 2 subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group in the P07642 study 
reporting 1 or more serious infections. The incidence of serious infections per hundred subject-years of 
follow-up through the last data cutoff in the P07642 study was 0.00 (95% CI: 0.00, 9.59) in the placebo 
group and 1.17 (95% CI: 0.14, 4.21) in the golimumab 50 mg group. 
The incidence of serious infections per hundred subject-years of follow-up through the last data cutoff in 
the combined P07642 and AS studies was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.03, 5.64) in the placebo group and 1.39 (95% 
CI: 0.78, 2.30) in the golimumab 50 mg group. 
Infections of Interest 
Through the last data cutoff, there were no events of sepsis, opportunistic infections or Tuberculosis. 
Pneumonia 
Through the last data cutoff in the P07642 study, there were 2 events of pneumonia in the golimumab 50 
mg group. The incidence of pneumonia per 100 subject-years was 0.00 (95% CI:  0.00, 9.59) in the 
placebo group and 1.17 (95% CI:  0.14, 4.21) in the golimumab 50 mg group.

In the combined P07642 study and AS studies, the incidence of pneumonia per 100 subject-years was 
0.00 (95% CI:  0.00, 3.03) in the placebo group and 0.84 (95% CI:  0.38, 1.59) in the golimumab group 
with overlapping CIs. 
Cellulitis 
Through the last data cutoff, there was 1 event of cellulitis in the golimumab 50 mg group in the P07642 
study. The incidence of cellulitis per 100 subject-years in the P07642 study was 0.00 (95% CI:  0.00, 9.59) 
in the placebo group and 0.58 (95% CI:  0.01, 3.25) in the golimumab group.  
In the combined AS studies, 7 events of cellulitis occurred in the golimumab 50 mg group and 14 events 
occurred in the golimumab 100 mg group (all events occurred in the C0524T09 study). The incidence of 
cellulitis per 100 subject-years in the P07642 study and combined AS studies was 0.00 (95% CI:  0.00, 
3.03) in the placebo group and 0.74 (95% CI:  0.32, 1.47) in the golimumab 50 mg group with the CI for 
the golimumab group contained within the CI for placebo group. 
Malignancies other than skin cancers 
Through the last data cut-off, there were no malignancies in the P07642 study.

4.21) in the golimumab 50 mg group 
The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions per hundred subject-years of follow-up through the last data 
cutoff in the P07642 study and combined AS studies was 0.00 (95% CI:  0.00, 3.03) in the placebo group 
and 1.12 (95% CI:  0.58, 1.95) in the golimumab 50 mg group with the CI for the golimumab 50 mg 
group contained within the CI for placebo group.

Clinically Important Hepatobiliary Events 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/235162/2015 
Page 50/57 
 
 
  
A clinically important hepatobiliary AE was defined as an elevation of ALT ≥3 x ULN associated with total 
bilirubin ≥2 x ULN, irrespective of the presence of the symptoms or associated AEs, or an ALT elevation 
≥3 x ULN associated with an SAE in the hepatobiliary SOC. 
Through the last data cut-off, there were no clinically important hepatobiliary events in the P07642 study. 
Injection-site Reactions 
Through Week 16 in the P07642 study, there were 3 (3.0%) subjects with 1 or more injection site 
reactions in the placebo group and none in the golimumab 50 mg group. 
Through the last data cutoff in the P07642 study, there were 3 (3.0%) subjects with 1 or more 
injection-site reactions in the placebo group and 4 (2.1%) subjects in the golimumab 50 mg group. There 
were 8 injections (0.4%) with injection site reactions in the golimumab 50 mg group with an average of 
10.1 administrations.  
In the combined AS studies, there were 2 subjects (1.1%) in the placebo group and 27 subjects (6.4%) 
in the golimumab 50 mg group with 1 or more injection-site reactions. There were 123 injections (0.8%) 
with injection-site reactions in the golimumab 50 mg group with an average of 26.0 administrations.  
The most common injection site reaction in the P07642 study was injection-site pain, and the most 
common injection site reaction in the combined AS studies was injection-site erythema. 
Antibodies to Golimumab and Adverse Reactions 
The relationship between the incidence of antibodies to golimumab and adverse events was assessed in 
the P07642 study. Following treatment with golimumab 50 mg, 4 subjects had samples at Week 16 which 
tested positive for anti-golimumab antibodies. One of these 4 subjects positive for anti-golimumab 
antibodies had an AE of vertebral artery occlusion, which was mild in intensity and resolved. 
Analyses to support prescribing safety information 
Analyses of events of interest across the nr-Axial SpA P07642 study, Phase 3 SC studies in rheumatologic 
indications (RA, PsA, and AS), and Phase 3 UC studies were conducted to support prescribing safety 
information. For these analyses, “All Indications” includes studies in nr-Axial SpA, AS, PsA, RA, and UC as 
described above. 
To assess for changes in the frequency of existing ADRs in the product information, an analysis of AEs 
across indications through the placebo-controlled period was performed. If the ADR did not occur during 
the placebo-controlled portion of the studies, the frequencies were determined using longer-term data. 
Based on these evaluations, the frequency for the following ADRs in the product information changed*: 
•  Opportunistic infections: 4/4215 (0.09%) 
-  Changes from Uncommon to rare 
•  Bacterial arthritis: 4/4215 (0.09%) 
-  Changes from Uncommon to rare 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Through Week 16 in the P07642 study, there were 2 subjects with any markedly abnormal hematology 
values. In the placebo group, 1 subject had an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and 1 subject had 
elevated absolute eosinophils. Through Week 24 one subject in the golimumab 50 mg group 
had >1 abnormal value for decreased absolute lymphocytes. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/235162/2015 
Page 51/57 
 
 
  
Through the last data cut-off in the P07642 study, the number of subjects with any markedly abnormal 
hematology value remained low. 
Clinical Chemistry 
Markedly Abnormal Chemistry Values 
Through Week 16 in the P07642 study, there were 4 subjects with any markedly abnormal chemistry 
values, with elevated potassium and elevated total bilirubin being the only abnormal chemistry values. 
There were no subjects in the P07642 study with >1 abnormal chemistry value. 
Through the last data cut-off in the P07642 study, the number of subjects with any markedly abnormal 
chemistry value (elevated potassium, elevated ALT, and elevated total bilirubin) remained low. The 
number of subjects with >1 abnormal chemistry value (elevated total bilirubin) also remained low. 
Maximum Postbaseline ALT/AST Elevations 
Through Week 16 in the P07642 study, of the subjects with a baseline ALT ≤ ULN, 3.1% (3 subjects) in 
the placebo group and 7.7% (7 subjects) in the golimumab group had an ALT >1 to <2 × ULN. Of the 
subjects with a baseline ALT ≤ ULN, none of the subjects in the placebo group and 3.3% (3 subjects) in 
the golimumab group had an ALT ≥2 to <3 × ULN. Through Week 16, no subjects in the P07642 study had 
an elevated ALT ≥3 × ULN irrespective of baseline ALT levels. 
The incidence of postbaseline ALT elevations >1 to <3 x ULN per hundred subject-years of follow-up 
through the last cutoff in the P07642 study was 25.62 (95% CI:  11.06, 50.48) in the placebo group and 
39.04 (30.25, 49.57) in the golimumab 50 mg group with the CI for the golimumab 50 mg group 
contained within the CI for placebo group.  
The incidence of postbaseline ALT elevations >1 to <3 x ULN per hundred subject-years of follow-up 
through the last cut-off in the combined AS studies was 51.60 (95% CI:  38.42, 67.85) in the placebo 
group and 55.95 (51.57, 60.60) in the golimumab 50 mg group with the CI for the golimumab 50 mg 
group contained within the CI for placebo group. 
Safety in special populations 
Through the last data cut-off, in the P07642 study and combined AS studies, there was no discernable 
effect of demographics (gender, race, weight, age) on the proportions of subjects with AEs 
As of 06 Apr 2014, a total of 169 pregnancies had been reported in patients or partners of patients treated 
with golimumab from clinical trials and the postmarketing setting.  
In the P07642 study through the last data cutoff (06 May 2014), there was 1 pregnancy reported in the 
partner of a subject who received golimumab 50 mg. The female partner of Subject 201000007/114809 
in the golimumab 50 mg group experienced a spontaneous abortion (reported as fetal loss) at less than 
20 weeks. Conception was prior to subject starting golimumab. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal studies of drug-drug interactions were performed with golimumab. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Through Week 16 (the placebo-controlled period), in the P07642 study (1.0% [1 subject] in the placebo 
group and 2.1% [2 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) discontinued study agent because of 1 or 
more adverse events compared with the combined AS studies (0.5% [1 subject] in the placebo group and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/235162/2015 
Page 52/57 
 
 
  
2.0% [5 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) and C0524T09 (1.3% [1 subject] in the placebo group 
and 2.9% [4 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group). 
The SOC with the highest proportions of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent was Investigations; 
however, most events occurred once with no discernable pattern in the types of AEs or evidence of a dose 
response. 
In the P07642 study (2.6% [5 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) discontinued study agent 
because of 1 or more adverse events compared with the combined AS studies (3.3% [14 subjects] in the 
golimumab 50 mg group) and C0524T09 (5.6% [12 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group). 
Post marketing experience 
The MAH points out that no postmarketing data in the indication of nr-Axial SpA is available for 
golimumab. The postmarketing safety profile of golimumab is closely monitored and reported on an 
ongoing basis via the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report/Periodic Safety Update Report 
(PBRER/PSUR). The Applicant’s routine pharmacovigilance activities include systematic collection of AEs 
from multiple sources and real-time and periodic medical assessments of single and aggregate cases to 
identify potential safety signals. As of 06 Apr 2014, an estimated 224,116 patients have been exposed to 
commercial golimumab worldwide since launch (Golimumab Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation 
Report-Periodic Safety Update Report [PBRER-PSUR], 07 April 2013 to 06 April 2014). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH has presented safety data for the nr-Axial SpA indication from the pivotal study P07642. As 
supportive analyses, safety data from this study were compared with data from the safety database for 
golimumab in other indications. Of these, AS is of the greatest interest, given the close similarities 
between the affected populations. 
Safety data from the P07642 study was presented through week 16, 24 and the last data cut-off point, 
which was 06 May 2014. As of that date, the last subject had completed 24 weeks. A total of 193 subjects 
had received at least 1 dose of golimumab 50 mg; 113 (58.5%) subjects had been exposed to golimumab 
for >24 weeks to ≤52 weeks, and 68 (35.2%) subjects had been exposed to golimumab for >52 weeks. 
No new adverse drug reactions were identified in the safety data from study 07642. As could be expected, 
the most common AEs occurred within the SOC Infections and infestations (23.0% in the placebo group 
and 24.7% in the golimumab group (through week 16). The most common PT was nasopharyngitis 
followed by upper respiratory tract infection. The corresponding results in the combined AS studies were 
22.0% in the placebo group and 28.9% in the golimumab 50 mg group. The SOC with the second most 
frequently reported AEs was gastrointestinal disorders ,15.0% in the placebo group and 8.2% in the 
golimumab 50 mg group in the P07642 study and 11.5% in the placebo group and 16.3% in the 
golimumab 50 mg group in the combined AS studies.  
During the placebo-controlled period, i.e. the first 16 weeks of the study, 1 SAE emerged in the 
golimumab treated group. This was a foetal death in the female partner of a male subject, who had not 
yet been exposed to golimumab by the time of conception. By the last data cutoff, 5 additional subjects 
in the golimumab group had experienced 1 or more SAEs (duodenitis, uterine polyp, staphylococcal 
infection, bacterial infection, and migraine). This corresponds to 3.1% of the subjects randomized to 
golimumab. In the combined AS studies, 9.0% (38 subjects) of the golimumab 50 mg group had 1 or 
more SAEs through the last data cut-off. 
There were no malignancies, TB infections, cases of sepsis or opportunistic infections, events of 
demyelination, events of congestive heart failure, MACE, clinically important hepatobiliary events, or

anaphylactic or serum sickness-like reactions observed in the Phase 3 P07642 nr-Axial SpA study through 
the last data cut-off. 
Through the last data cut-off in the P07642 study (2.1% [4 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) 
discontinued study agent because of 1 or more adverse events compared with the combined AS studies 
(1.7% [6 subjects] in the golimumab 50 mg group) and C0524T09 (2.2% [4 subjects] in the golimumab 
50 mg group). 
Based upon the additional data provided from the P07642 study, the MAH proposed to update the product 
information for frequency of 2 AEs, “opportunistic infections” and “bacterial arthritis”. Both ADRs would 
be classified as rare instead of uncommon. This update is endorsed by the CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new significant safety signal has emerged in study P07642. The MAH also refers to the existing AS, RA 
and UC safety data bases, and has provided comparisons between the safety results from the current 
nr-Axial SpA and combined AS studies, as well as to combined rheumatologic studies and all combined 
golimumab studies. 
Upon review of the submitted data, it is concluded that the adverse event (AE) incidence and profile of 
golimumab in the nr-Axial SpA-population was as expected for an anti-TNF-therapy and consistent with 
previous experience with golimumab. 
There is very limited knowledge on how long treatment should be continued in subjects in whom there is 
no disease activity following treatment, or the safety and efficacy of retreatment after disease flare. The 
MAH will conduct a clinical study to evaluate the safety of golimumab as re treatment for a 
disease-activity flare in subjects who have been able to withdraw treatment for nr-Axial SpA after 
attaining inactive disease (as described in the RMP). 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 11.1 is acceptable.  
The RMP was updated to include data on nr-Axial SpA and performed studies in relevant sections of the 
RMP while no changes to the Summary of safety concerns (Part II, Module SVIII), the Pharmacovigilance 
Plan (Part III) nor the Risk Minimisation measures (Part V) were implemented.  
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, changes related to section 4.8, “Description of selected adverse reactions” of the SmPC has 
been updated with regard to incidence numbers. Further, the table in section 4.8 has been updated 
regarding the frequency of “Opportunistic infection” and “Bacterial arthritis”, both changed from 
Uncommon to Rare. This was endorsed by the CHMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
One study has been presented, P07642, where 50mg SC Q4W was tested in comparison to placebo during 
a 16 week period. After week 16 all remaining subjects are treated open label, and the study is 
ongoing.The primary efficacy endpoint, the ASAS20 response at Week 16 was statistically significantly 
greater (p<0.001) in the active group (golimumab [71.1%] compared with the placebo group (40.0%). 
The difference to placebo (31.2%) is clinically relevant. Further, also the secondary endpoint ASAS40, 
which is considered more relevant for an anti-TNF agent, was met, with a difference to placebo of 
approximately 33.8% at week 16. Other secondary analyses also support efficacy. Thus, the study results 
support the efficacy of golimumab in the nr Axial SpA population, regarding symptoms, spinal mobility 
and inflammation. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There is very limited knowledge on how long treatment should be continued in subjects in whom there is 
no disease activity following treatment, or the safety and efficacy of retreatment after disease flare. The 
MAH will conduct a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of golimumab (full or reduced treatment regimen) 
versus treatment withdrawal in subjects with nr Axial SpA who have attained inactive disease while 
receiving open-label golimumab and to characterise the efficacy of golimumab as retreatment upon flare 
in subjects with nr-Axial SpA (as described in the RMP). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of golimumab is well established and is characterised by several potentially serious risks, 
including but not limited to infections and potential risks of malignancies, congestive heart failure and 
demyelinating disorders. Adequate risk minimisation as well as pharmacovigilance activities are in place 
from previous procedures, and are adequate to also cover the current indication. 
No new safety signal has emerged in study AS001. The MAH also refer to the AS safety data base, and the 
safety profile appears not unexpectedly to be similar between the populations. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Further long term safety data is still missing and will be gathered in the ongoing studies in other indication 
which include long term outcomes as described in the RMP.  
There is very limited knowledge on how long treatment should be continued in subjects in whom there is 
no disease activity following treatment, or the safety of retreatment after disease flare. The MAH will 
conduct a clinical study to evaluate the safety of golimumab as re treatment for a disease-activity flare in 
subjects who have been able to withdraw treatment for nr-Axial SpA after attaining inactive disease (as 
described in the RMP). 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The disease nr Axial SpA is a painful condition with a considerable negative impact on function and work 
productivity in the afflicted patients. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/235162/2015 
Page 55/57 
 
 
  
The diagnostic criteria are based on the presence of back pain for more than 3 months, and either MRI 
findings indicative of sacroiliitis or positive HLA B27 in combination with specified clinical features. In the 
absence of MRI-findings patients without objective measure of inflammation may thus be diagnosed. The 
safety profile of an anti-TNF agent can be potentially serious and it is important to avoid overtreatment. 
It is therefore appreciated that the proposed indication includes only patients with either positive MRI 
findings or elevated CRP. Although the group was small, the subgroup without positive MRI and normal 
CRP levels did not achieve a higher response rate of ASAS20 as compared to the placebo group.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The presented results show efficacy for Simponi in patients with axial spondyloarthritis, and an acceptable 
safety profile for the right patient population, i.e. those with objective signs of inflammation.  
There is very limited knowledge on how long treatment should be continued in subjects in whom there is 
no disease activity following treatment, or the safety and efficacy of retreatment after disease flare. The 
MAH will therefore conduct a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of golimumab (full or reduced 
treatment regimen) versus treatment withdrawal in subjects who have attained inactive disease while 
receiving open-label golimumab and the efficacy and safety of golimumab as re-treatment for a 
disease-activity flare in subjects who have been able to withdraw treatment for nr-Axial SpA after 
attaining inactive disease (as described in the RMP). 
The benefit-risk balance of golimumab for the treatment of adults with severe, active non-radiographic 
axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein 
(CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to, or 
are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is considered positive.

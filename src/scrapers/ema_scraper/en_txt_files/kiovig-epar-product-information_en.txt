4.2
Posology and method of administration
Replacement therapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician 
experienced in the treatment of immunodeficiency.
Posology
The dose and dose regimen is dependent on the indication.
In replacement therapy the dose may need to be individualised for each patient dependent on the 
pharmacokinetic and clinical response. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in 
underweight or overweight patients. 
The following dose regimens are given as a guideline.
Replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency syndromes
The dose regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG (measured before the next infusion) of at 
least 5 to 6 g/L. Three to six months are required after the initiation of therapy for equilibration 
(steady-state IgG levels) to occur. The recommended starting dose is 0.4-0.8 g/kg given once, 
followed by at least 0.2 g/kg given every three to four weeks.
The dose required to achieve a trough level of 5-6 g/L is of the order of 0.2-0.8 g/kg/month. 
The dose interval when steady state has been reached varies from 3-4 weeks.
IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. To 
reduce the rate of bacterial infection, it may be necessary to increase the dose and aim for higher 
trough levels.
Secondary immunodeficiencies (as defined in 4.1.)
The recommended dose is 0.2-0.4 g/kg every three to four weeks.
IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. 
Dose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, an increase may 
be necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be considered when the patient 
remains infection free.
Primary immune thrombocytopenia
There are two alternative treatment schedules:


0.8-1g/kg given on day one; this dose may be repeated once within 3 days
0.4 g/kg given daily for two to five days.
The treatment can be repeated if relapse occurs.
3
Guillain Barré syndrome
0.4 g/kg/day over 5 days (possible repeat of dosing in case of relapse).
Kawasaki Disease
2 g/kg should be administered as a single dose. Patients should receive concomitant treatment with 
acetylsalicylic acid.
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
Starting dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2 -5 consecutive days
Maintenance doses:
1 g/kg over 1-2 consecutive days every 3 weeks.
The treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after 6 months, 
the treatment should be discontinued.
If the treatment is effective long term treatment should be subject to the physicians discretion based
upon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to be adapted
according to the individual course of the disease.
Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)
Starting dose: 2 g/kg given over 2-5 consecutive days.
Maintenance dose: 1 g/kg every 2 to 4 weeks or 2 g/kg every 4 to 8 weeks over 2-5 days.
The treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after 6 months, 
the treatment should be discontinued.
If the treatment is effective long term treatment should be subject to the physicians discretion based 
upon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to be adapted
according to the individual course of the disease.

Paediatric population
The posology in children and adolescents (0-18 years) is not different to that of adults as the 
posology for each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of 
the above mentioned conditions.
Hepatic impairment
No evidence is available to require a dose adjustment.
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4.
Elderly
No dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4.
Method of administration
For intravenous use.
Human normal immunoglobulin should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.5 ml/kg BW/hr 
for 30 minutes. If well tolerated (see section 4.4), the rate of administration may gradually be 
increased to a maximum of 6 ml/kg BW/hr. Clinical data obtained from a limited number of patients 
also indicate that adult PID patients may tolerate an infusion rate of up to 8 ml/kg BW/hr. For further 
precautions for use see section 4.4.
If dilution prior to infusion is required, KIOVIG may be diluted with 5% glucose solution to a final 
concentration of 50 mg/ml (5% immunoglobulin). For instructions on dilution of the medicinal 
product before administration, see section 6.6.
Any infusion-related adverse events should be treated by lowering infusion rates or by stopping the 
infusion.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, especially in patients with antibodies against IgA.
5
Patients with selective IgA deficiency who developed antibodies to IgA, as administering an IgA
containing product can result in anaphylaxis.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Infusion reaction
Certain severe adverse reactions (e.g. headache, flushing, chills, myalgia, wheezing, tachycardia, 
lower back pain, nausea, and hypotension) may be related to the rate of infusion. The recommended 
infusion rate given under section 4.2 must be closely followed. Patients must be closely monitored and 
carefully observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion period.
Certain adverse reactions may occur more frequently


in case of high rate of infusion
in patients who receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when 
the human normal immunoglobulin product is switched or when there has been a long interval 
since the previous infusion.
in patients with an untreated infection or underlying chronic inflammation.

Precautions for use
-
Potential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients:
-
are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin by initially injecting the product slowly 
(0.5 ml/kg BW/hr);
are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients 
naive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative IVIg product or 
when there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored at the 
hospital during the first infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion, in order to detect 
potential adverse signs. All other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after 
administration.
In all patients, IVIg administration requires:






adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the infusion of IVIg
monitoring of urine output
monitoring of serum creatinine levels
monitoring for signs and symptoms of thrombosis
assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity
avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics (see 4.5).
In case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped. 
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction.
If dilution of KIOVIG to lower concentrations is required for patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, 
the use of 5% glucose solution for dilution may have to be reconsidered.
Hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity reactions are rare.
Anaphylaxis can develop in patients
 with undetectable IgA who have anti-IgA antibodies
 who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
6
Thromboembolism
There is clinical evidence of an association between IVIg administration and thromboembolic events 
such as myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident (including stroke), pulmonary embolism and 
deep vein thromboses which is assumed to be related to a relative increase in blood viscosity through 
the high influx of immunoglobulin in at-risk patients. Caution should be exercised in prescribing and 
infusion of IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events 
(such as a history of atherosclerosis, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, impaired 
cardiac output, hypertension, use of estrogens, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or 
thrombotic episodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, hypercoagulable 
disorders, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, severely hypovolaemic patients, patients 
with diseases which increase blood viscosity, patients with indwelling vascular catheters and patients 
with high dose and rapid infusion).
Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity and subsequent relative pseudohyponatremia may occur 
in patients receiving IVIg therapy. This should be taken into account by physicians, since initiation of
treatment for true hyponatremia (i.e. decreasing serum free water) in these patients may lead to 
a further increase in serum viscosity and a possible predisposition to thromboembolic events.
In patients at risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions, IVIg products should be administered at the
minimum rate of infusion and dose practicable.
Acute renal failure
Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients receiving IVIg therapy. These include acute 
renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy and osmotic nephrosis. In most 
cases, risk factors have been identified, such as pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, 
hypovolaemia, overweight, concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, age over 65, sepsis, 
hyperviscosity or paraproteinemia.
Renal parameters should be assessed prior to infusion of IVIg, particularly in patients judged to have a 
potential increased risk for developing acute renal failure, and again at appropriate intervals. In 
patients at risk for acute renal failure, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of 
infusion and dose practicable. In case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation should be considered.
While these reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of 
many of the licensed IVIg products containing various excipients such as sucrose, glucose and 
maltose, those containing sucrose as a stabiliser accounted for a disproportionate share of the total 
number. In patients at risk, the use of IVIg products that do not contain these excipients may be 
considered. KIOVIG does not contain sucrose, maltose or glucose.
Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)
In patients receiving IVIg, there have been reports of acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema 
(Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury, (TRALI) in patients administered IVIg (including KIOVIG).
TRALI is characterised by severe hypoxia, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, cyanosis, fever and hypotension. 
Symptoms of TRALI typically develop during or within 6 hours of a transfusion, often within 1-2 
hours. Therefore, IVIg recipients must be monitored for and IVIg infusion must be immediately 
stopped in case of pulmonary adverse reactions. TRALI is a potentially lifethreatening condition 
requiring immediate intensive-care-unit management.
Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS)
Aseptic meningitis syndrome has been reported to occur in association with IVIg treatment. The 
syndrome usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IVIg treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid 
studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm3, predominantly 
7
from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL. AMS may 
occur more frequently in association with high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg treatment.
Patients exhibiting such signs and symptoms should receive a thorough neurological examination,
including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis.
Discontinuation of IVIg treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without 
sequelae.
From post-marketing data with KIOVIG no clear correlation of AMS to higher doses was observed. 
Higher incidences of AMS were seen in women.
Haemolytic anaemia
IVIg products can contain blood group antibodies that may act as haemolysins and induce in vivo
coating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction
(Coombs' test) and, rarely, haemolysis. Haemolytic anaemia can develop subsequent to IVIg therapy 
due to enhanced red blood cells (RBC) sequestration. IVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical 
signs and symptoms of haemolysis. (See section 4.8.)
Neutropenia/Leukopenia
A transient decrease in neutrophil count and/or episodes of neutropenia, sometimes severe, have been
reported after treatment with IVIgs. This typically occurs within hours or days after IVIg 
administration and resolves spontaneously within 7 to 14 days.
Interference with serological testing
After infusion of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies 
in the patient's blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing.
Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D, may interfere with some 
serological tests for red cell antibodies, for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct 
Coombs’ test).
Administration of KIOVIG can lead to false positive readings in assays that depend on detection of 
beta-D-glucans for diagnosis of fungal infections. This may persist during the weeks following 
infusion of the product.
Transmissible agents
KIOVIG is made from human plasma. Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use 
of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of 
individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective 
manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products 
prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infectious 
agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other 
pathogens.
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV, and 
for the non-enveloped viruses HAV and parvovirus B19.
There is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or Parvovirus 
B19 transmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes 
an important contribution to the viral safety.
8
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Paediatric population
There are no paediatric specific risks with regard to any of the above adverse events. Paediatric
patients may be more susceptible to volume overload (see Section 4.9).
4.5
Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interactions
Live attenuated virus vaccines
Immunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months 
the efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After 
administration of this product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with live 
attenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. 
Therefore patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked.
Dilution of KIOVIG with a 5% glucose solution may result in increased blood glucose levels.
Loop diuretics
Avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics.
Paediatric population
The listed interactions apply both to adults and children.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
The safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled 
clinical trials and therefore it should only be given with caution to pregnant women and breast-feeding 
mothers. IVIg products have been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly during the third trimester.
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of 
pregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are to be expected.
Breast-feeding
Immunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may contribute to protecting the neonate from 
pathogens which have a mucosal portal of entry. No negative effects on the breastfed newborn/infants 
are anticipated.
Fertility
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on fertility are to be 
expected.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions associated with 
KIOVIG. Patients who experience adverse reactions during treatment should wait for these to resolve 
before driving or operating machines.

4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Adverse reactions such as chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, 
arthralgia, low blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally.
Rarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated 
cases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous 
administration.
Cases of reversible aseptic meningitis and rare cases of transient cutaneous reactions (including 
cutaneous lupus erythematosus - frequency unknown) have been observed with human normal 
immunoglobulin. Reversible haemolytic reactions have been observed in patients, especially those 
with blood groups A, B, and AB. Rarely, haemolytic anaemia requiring transfusion may develop after 
high dose IVIg treatment (see also Section 4.4).
Increase in serum creatinine level and/or acute renal failure have been observed.
Very rarely: Thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, 
and deep vein thromboses.
Cases of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Muscle twitching and weakness were reported only in patients with MMN.
Paediatric population
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are the same as in adults.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
For safety with respect to transmissible agents, see section 4.4.
4.9 Overdose
Overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity, particularly in patients at risk, including 
elderly patients or patients with cardiac or renal impairment (see section 4.4 ).
Paediatric population
Smaller children below the age of 5 years may be particularly susceptible to volume overload. 
Therefore, dosing should be carefully calculated for this population. In addition, children with 
Kawasaki Disease are at especially high risk due to underlying cardiac compromise so dose and rate 
of administration should be carefully controlled.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, 
for intravascular administration, ATC code: J06BA02
Human normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum 
of antibodies against infectious agents.
Human normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is 
usually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1000 donations. It has a distribution of 
immunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma. Adequate doses 
of this medicinal product may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G levels to the normal range.
The mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but 
includes immunomodulatory effects.
12
Paediatric population
There are no theoretical or observed differences in the action of immunoglobulins in children 
compared to adults.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Human normal immunoglobulin is immediately and completely bioavailable in the recipient’s 
circulation after intravenous administration. It is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and 
extravascular fluid; after approximately 3 to 5 days equilibrium is reached between the intra- and 
extravascular compartments.
Pharmacokinetic parameters for KIOVIG were determined in the two clinical studies in PID patients 
performed in Europe and the US. In these studies, a total of 83 subjects at least 2 years of age were 
treated with doses of 300 to 600 mg/kg body weight every 21 to 28 days for 6 to 12 months. The 
median IgG half-life after administration of KIOVIG was 32.5 days. This half-life may vary from 
patient to patient, in particular in primary immunodeficiency. Pharmacokinetic parameters for the 
product are summarized in the table below. All parameters were analysed separately for three age 
groups, children (below 12 years, n=5), adolescents (13 to 17 years, n=10), and adults (above 18 years 
of age, n=64). The values obtained in the studies are comparable to parameters reported for other 
human immunoglobulins.

Preclinical safety data
Immunoglobulins are normal constituents of the human body.
The safety of KIOVIG has been demonstrated in several non-clinical studies. Non-clinical data reveal 
no special risk for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and toxicity.
Studies of repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction in animals are 
impracticable due to induction of and interference by developing antibodies to heterologous proteins. 
Since clinical experience provides no evidence for carcinogenic potential of immunoglobulins, 
no experimental studies in heterogeneous species were performed.

Possible side effects
How to store KIOVIG
Contents of the pack and other information
1. What KIOVIG is and what it is used for
KIOVIG belongs to a class of medications called immunoglobulins. These medicines contain human 
antibodies, which are also present in your blood. Antibodies help your body to fight infections. 
Medicines like KIOVIG are used in patients who do not have enough antibodies in their blood and 
tend to get frequent infections. They can also be used in patients who need additional antibodies for 
the cure of certain inflammatory disorders (autoimmune diseases).
KIOVIG is used for
Treatment of patients who do not have sufficient antibodies (replacement therapy). There are 
two groups:
1.
2.
Patients with inborn lack of antibody production (primary immunodeficiency syndromes).
Patients with secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) who suffer from severe or recurrent 
infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure
(PSAF)* or serum IgG level of <4 g/l.
*PSAF = failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide 
and polypeptide antigen vaccines
Treatment of patients with certain inflammatory disorders (immunomodulation). There are five
groups:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Patients who do not have enough blood platelets (primary immune thrombocytopenia, ITP), and 
who are at high risk of bleeding or will have surgery in the near future.
Patients with a disease that is associated with multiple inflammations of the nerves in the whole 
body (Guillain Barré syndrome).
Patients with a disease which results in multiple inflammations of several organs of the 
body (Kawasaki disease).
Patients who suffer from a rare condition characterized by slow progressive asymmetrical 
weakness of limbs without sensory loss (multifocal motor neuropathy, MMN).
29
5. 
Patients who suffer from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy
(CIDP).
2. What you need to know before you use KIOVIG
Do not use KIOVIG
if you are allergic to immunoglobulins or to any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
For example, if you have an immunoglobulin A deficiency, you may have antibodies against 
immunoglobulin A in your blood. Since KIOVIG contains trace amounts of immunoglobulin A 
(less than 0.14 mg/ml), you might get an allergic reaction.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using KIOVIG.
How long monitoring is required during the infusion



You will be carefully observed during the infusion period with KIOVIG to make sure that you 
do not suffer a reaction. Your doctor will make sure that the rate at which KIOVIG is infused is 
suitable for you.
If KIOVIG is administered at a high rate, if you suffer from a condition with low antibody 
levels in your blood (hypo- or agammaglobulinemia), if you have not received this medicine 
before or if there has been a long interval (e.g. several weeks) since you last received it, there 
may be a higher risk of side effects. In such cases, you will be closely monitored during your 
infusion and for an hour after your infusion has stopped.
If you have already received KIOVIG previously and received the last treatment recently, then 
you will only be observed during the infusion and for at least 20 minutes after your infusion.
When slowing or stopping the infusion may be required
In rare cases your body may have previously reacted to specific antibodies and therefore will be 
sensitive to medicines containing antibodies. This may happen particularly if you suffer from 
immunoglobulin A deficiency. In these rare cases, you may get allergic reactions such as a sudden fall 
in blood pressure or shock even if you have already received treatment with medicines containing
antibodies in the past.
If you experience a reaction during the infusion of KIOVIG, tell your doctor immediately. Depending 
on your doctor’s decision the rate of infusion can be slowed or the infusion can be stopped altogether.
Special patient groups


Your doctor will take special care if you are overweight, elderly, diabetic, or if you suffer from 
high blood pressure, low blood volume (hypovolaemia), or problems with your blood vessels 
(vascular diseases). In these conditions, immunoglobulins may increase the risk of cardiac 
infarction, stroke, lung embolism, or deep vein thrombosis, although only in very rare cases.
Tell your doctor if you are diabetic. Although KIOVIG does not contain sugar, it may be 
diluted with a special sugar solution (5% glucose), which could affect your blood sugar level.
Your doctor will also take special care if you have or had previously problems with your 
kidneys, or if you receive medicinal products that may harm your kidney (nephrotoxic 
medicinal products), as there is a very rare chance of acute kidney failure.
Please tell your doctor if you have a kidney disorder. Your doctor will choose the appropriate 
intravenous immunoglobulin for you.

Information on the source material of KIOVIG
KIOVIG is made from human plasma (the liquid part of blood). When medicines are made from 
human blood or plasma, a number of measures are put in place to prevent infections being passed on 
to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of 
carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of 
virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or 
plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from 
human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally 
excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections.
The measures taken for the manufacture of KIOVIG are considered effective for enveloped viruses 
such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the 
non-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. KIOVIG also contains certain antibodies that 
can prevent an infection with hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19.
Other medicines and KIOVIG
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, or have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
If you have received a vaccination during the last six weeks and up to three months, the infusion of 
immunoglobulins like KIOVIG may impair the effect of some live virus vaccines such as measles, 
rubella, mumps and chicken pox. Therefore, after receiving immunoglobulins you may have to wait up
to 3 months before receiving your live-attenuated vaccine. You may have to wait for up to 1 year after 
receiving immunoglobulins before you receive your measles vaccine.
Effects on blood tests
KIOVIG contains a wide variety of different antibodies, some of which can affect blood tests. If you 
have a blood test after receiving KIOVIG, please inform the person taking your blood or your doctor 
that you have received the medication.
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility



If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
No clinical trials have been made with KIOVIG in pregnant or breast-feeding women. However, 
medicines that contain antibodies have been used in pregnant or breast-feeding women, and it 
has been shown that there are no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy or the baby to be 
expected.
If you are breast-feeding and receive KIOVIG, the antibodies of the medicine can also be found 
in the breast milk. Therefore, your baby may be protected from certain infections.
Driving and using machines
Patients may experience reactions (for example dizziness or nausea) during the treatment with 
KIOVIG, which might affect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should
wait until the reactions have disappeared.
3.
How to use KIOVIG
KIOVIG is intended for intravenous administration (infusion into a vein). It is given to you by your 
doctor or nurse. Dose and frequency of the infusion will vary depending on your condition and your 
body weight.
31
At the beginning of your infusion you will receive KIOVIG at a slow rate. Dependent 
on how comfortable you are, your doctor may then gradually increase the infusion rate.
Use in children and adolescents
The same indications, dose and frequency of infusion as for adults apply for children and 
adolescents (age 0 to 18).
If you use more KIOVIG than you should
If you get more KIOVIG than you should, your blood may become too thick (hyperviscous).
This could particularly happen when you are a patient at risk, e.g. an elderly patient or a patient 
having problems with your kidneys. Be sure that you take adequate fluids so you are not 
dehydrated and notify your physician if you are known to have medical problems.
4.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Method of administration




KIOVIG must only be administered intravenously. Other routes of administration have not been 
evaluated.
KIOVIG should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.5 ml/kg bodyweight/hour 
for 30 minutes. If well tolerated, the rate of administration may gradually be increased to a 
maximum of 6 ml/kg bodyweight/hour. Clinical data obtained from a limited number of patients 
also indicate that adult PID patients may tolerate an infusion rate of up to 8 ml/kg BW/hr.
If dilution to lower concentrations is required prior to infusion, KIOVIG may be diluted 
with 5% glucose solution to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml (5% immunoglobulin).
Any infusion-related adverse events should be treated by lowering infusion rates or by stopping 
the infusion.
Special precautions


Any infusion-related adverse events should be treated by lowering the infusion rate or by 
stopping the infusion.
It is recommended that every time KIOVIG is administered, the name and batch number of 
the product is recorded.

Special precautions for storage

After dilution to lower concentrations, immediate use is recommended. The in-use stability 
of KIOVIG after dilution with a 5% glucose solution to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml 
(5% immunoglobulin) has been demonstrated for 21 days at 2°C to 8°C as well as at 28°C 
to 30°C; however, these studies did not include the microbial contamination and safety aspects.
Instructions for handling and disposal




The product must be brought to room or body temperature before use.
KIOVIG should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to
administration. Only clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to pale yellow solutions are to 
be administered. Do not use if particulate matter or discolouration is observed.
If dilution is required, 5% glucose solution is recommended. For obtaining an immunoglobulin 
solution of 50 mg/ml (5%), KIOVIG 100 mg/ml (10%) should be diluted with an equal volume 
of the glucose solution. It is recommended that during dilution the risk of microbial 
contamination is minimised.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

biomedical literature databases for all reports/articles 
findings from literature regarding excretion of 
infliximab in human milk and the lack of impact on

new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
and PL 
relating to the use of infliximab as well as a search of the 
GMS Global Safety Database for medically confirmed cases 
from all sources cumulatively were performed. 
Limited data from published literature indicate infliximab 
has been detected at low levels in human milk at 
concentrations up to 5% of the maternal serum level. 
Infliximab has also been detected in infant serum after 
exposure to infliximab via breast milk. While systemic 
exposure in a breastfed infant is expected to be low 
because infliximab is largely degraded in the 
gastrointestinal tract, the administration of live vaccines to 
a breastfed infant when the mother is receiving infliximab 
is not recommended unless infant infliximab serum levels 
are undetectable. Infliximab could be considered for use 
during breast-feeding.

cardiovascular events is observed in many of the patient 
groups targeted by the Remicade indications and long-
term, Remicade does not seem to increase this risk further 
(on the contrary there are indications that the drug, 
through its anti-inflammatory effects can actually decrease 
the cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk). However,

the RABBIT Cohort 2 portion of the registry. 
Rheumatoide Arthritis - Beobachtung der Biologika-
Therapie (RABBIT) is a German RA registry 
established as a prospective observational cohort 
study on the long-term safety and effectiveness of 
biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in 
patients with RA. 
RMP (v19) was updated with the conclusion of the 
study. The MAH also revised the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP as requested in the assessment 
of LEG 156 and as a consequence the patient 
reminder card.

Cohort 2 study (with a data cut-off of 31 October 2017) is 
submitted, and the list of safety concerns in the RMP is 
updated. The RABBIT study aims to capture data on the 
Remicade safety concerns. RABBIT Cohort 2 did not show 
evidence of an increased incidence of study outcomes 
among Remicade initiators matched to csDMARD 
treatment. Furthermore, no new safety concerns for 
Remicade were observed in the RABBIT Cohort 2 study, 
and the results confirm the established safety profile of 
Remicade. The risk for increased risk for infections during 
anti-TNF-treatment is well known and considered 
adequately covered in the SmPC. Based on the data 
included in this submission, no update of the Remicade 
product information is warranted. It is also agreed that this 
data in itself does not warrant any changes to the RMP 
Summary of Safety Concern. However, within this 
procedure, a thorough analysis of the RMP Summary of 
Safety Concern was made to align with the new GVP 
Module V and the patient reminder card has been updated 
accordingly.

that reported resolving symptoms or the resolution of 
symptoms after infliximab was withdrawn. In another case, 
the symptoms resolved between infliximab cycles and 
recurred upon the next administration, suggestive of a 
positive dechallenge/rechallenge drug-effect. Three cases 
were identified as sentinel, 2 reported AGEP and 1 reported 
ALEP. No clinical trial cases were reported and only 1 event 
from observational studies and registries was identified, 
which was considered likely indicative of the rarity of these 
disorders. Based on this analysis AGEP is added as new 
adverse drug reaction with a frequency rare in section 4.8 
of the SmPC.

prescribers to measure the effectiveness of the Educational 
request of educational material from Annex II, with 
the exception of the Patient Reminder Card which 
should continue to be distributed. The term “patient 
alert card” was changed to “patient reminder card” in 
Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the SmPC, Annex IIIA and 
the PL. In addition, the MAH has updated the 
package leaflet with some missing warnings and 
ADRs already reflected in the SmPC, as requested by 
CHMP, and has introduced some minor QRD related 
changes in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Formatting 
errors have been corrected in section 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC.

among the prescribers. Furthermore, the Educational 
Material does not seem to be the main source of 
information: the risk management has been integrated in 
guidelines and recommendations over the years and is now 
part of routine clinical practice. Therefore, it was 
considered acceptable to remove the Educational Program 
for prescribers as a risk minimization measure. However, 
the Patient Reminder Card will continue to be distributed in 
order to remind patients of the most important risks and 
their symptoms, as well as the importance of informing 
caregivers of their medication.

report of the OPUS Registry (Prospective, 
Observational, Non-Interventional, Post-marketing 
Safety Surveillance Program in Subjects with UC; 
P04808) as per MEA 121. 
In addition, the MAH is taking the opportunity to 
update the warning on screening tests for 
tuberculosis to align it with current medical practice, 
add a reminder on the patient alert card in package 
leaflet and include some editorial changes in line with 
the QRD template. 
The RMP has also been updated to remove the risks 
of hepatobiliary events, sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like 
reaction, and colon carcinoma/dysplasia in adults 
with UC and to add long-term safety follow-up as 
missing information for adults with UC.

PL 
designed to collect long-term (5 years) safety data in 
patients with moderate to severe active UC who were 
selected by their physician for treatment with Remicade or 
standard therapy. The primary endpoint of the OPUS 
registry study is the incidence of AEs, as categorized into 9 
pre-specified AE categories of interest including serious 
infections, infusion-related reactions, fatalities and 
malignancies. Based on the final OPUS safety analyses, no 
new safety concerns were observed, and these results 
further confirm that the benefit/risk profile is considered 
unchanged. 
The warning on colon cancer and dysplasia has been 
updated to reflect that current data do not indicate that 
infliximab treatment influences the risk for developing 
dysplasia or colon cancer. However, since the possibility of 
increased risk of cancer development in patients with newly 
diagnosed dysplasia treated with Remicade is not 
established, the risk and benefits of continued therapy to 
the individual patients should be carefully considered by 
the clinician.

Dermatosis (LABD), a causal relationship between 
infliximab exposure and the development of LABD cannot 
be excluded. The update of the product information is 
supported by the identification of 3 post-marketing cases 
with a temporal relationship between the initiation of 
infliximab and the development of LABD symptoms, the 
identification of 3 post-marketing cases exhibiting a 
positive rechallenge or worsening of symptoms upon 
subsequent dosing of infliximab, and a spontaneous RR

The product information has been updated to recommend 
warning recommending adult patients to be brought 
up to date with all vaccinations if possible prior to 
initiating Remicade therapy (in line with the current 
warning for children) and to clarify that patients on 
infliximab may receive concurrent vaccinations, 
except for live vaccines. Relevant sections of the 
package Leaflet and the RMP (v 15.1) were updated 
accordingly. 
The MAH took the opportunity the update the 
product information in accordance with the latest 
that patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all 
vaccinations in agreement with current vaccination 
guidelines prior to initiating Remicade therapy. Patients on 
infliximab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for 
live vaccines.  
In a subset of 90 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
from the ASPIRE study a similar proportion of patients in 
each treatment group (methotrexate plus: placebo [n=17],

received during treatment with anti-TNF therapies, 
including Remicade, may elicit a lower immune response 
than in patients not receiving anti-TNF therapy.

colitis and use of BCG by bladder instillation for the 
treatment of bladder cancer. A clear causal association 
between infliximab and the onset of disseminated BCG 
infection could not be determined due to confounding 
factors but could not be excluded. 
Upon analysis, the MAH concluded that this case 
represented a situation similar to receiving a live vaccine 
because BCG is a live attenuated form of Mycobacterium 
bacillus. The risks of infection and complications from 
infections following administration of a live vaccine have 
been reported to be much higher in patients whose immune 
systems have been compromised than in the healthy 
population. The MAH therefore proposed to update the 
product information to change the section heading of the 
Vaccination section to reflect the need to consider other 
therapeutic infectious agents, not just vaccines and to add 
a warning to not administer therapeutic infectious agents 
concurrently with Remicade or Simponi. This was agreed by 
the CHMP.

postmarketing cases of MCC (or neuroendocrine carcinoma

All 19 reports were postmarketing cases. No MCC cases 
were observed in registries and clinical trials. Of the 19 
reports there were 2 fatalities reported in patients either 
taking multiple immunosuppressants concomitantly with 
infliximab or with limited information regarding medical

factors (i.e. one or more risk factors for MCC such as prior 
immunosuppressant history, concomitant 
immunosuppressant therapies, and/or a history of 
malignancy) limiting the causality assessment with 
infliximab. Based on this review, MCC is considered causally 
associated with the use of infliximab, and a drug class 
effect to TNF inhibitors. Key factors supporting this 
conclusion include the biological plausibility based on 
immunosuppression by TNF-α inhibitors, the apparent 
sensitivity of MCC to immunosuppression, and the elevated 
reporting rate compared with the background rate of this 
type of cancer, all which suggest an association of MCC 
with this drug class. MCC is therefore added to section 4.8, 
with a frequency category of “Not known” for both 
infliximab and golimumab, as the frequemcy of the event 
cannot be estimated from the available data. The severity 
and seriousness of the event of MCC also justify its addition 
to section 4.4 to warn the physicians that cases of MCC 
have been reported in patients treated with TNF blocker 
therapy and to recommend periodic skin examination, 
particularly for patients with risk factors for skin cancer.. 
The cumulative review of melanoma cases, coincident with 
infliximab or golimumab use, from registries, clinical trials 
and postmarketing identified 385 reports for infliximab and 
14 for golimumab. For infliximab, there were 2 reports from 
clinical trials, 333 from postmarketing and 50 from 
registries. For golimumab there were 6 clinical trials 
reports, 7 postmarketing and 1 registry reports. In the FDA 
AERS database, there were significant numbers of cases of 
melanoma events with all of the TNF-α blockers. In more 
than 50% of the cases there were associated risk factors 
limiting the causality assessment with the drugs. Based on

Although no data exist to establish a greater risk of adverse 
the overall data, it remains unclear whether a causal 
relationship exists between infliximab or golimumab use 
and the development of melanoma, however the possible 
contribution of infliximab or golimumab use to the risk 
cannot be excluded. Based on the data, the frequency 
category of melanoma is “rare” (1/10,000 and <1/1,000) 
for both infliximab and golimumab.

desirable. This recommendation is also aligned with similar

exposure (area under concentration time curve at steady 
state, AUCss) in paediatric patients aged 6 years to 17 
years was approximately 20% lower than the predicted 
median steady state drug exposure in adults. The median 
AUCss in paediatric patients aged 2 years to less than 6 
years was predicted to be approximately 40% lower than 
that in adults, although the number of patients supporting 
this estimate is limited. Since the efficacy and safety of 
infliximab in paediatric subjects aged 2 years to <6 years 
have not been evaluated in adequately-designed clinical 
studies, the clinical significance of the relatively lower 
infliximab exposure predicted by the population PK model 
in this young age group is unknown.

adding a recommendation that in patients treated with 
Remicade, an invasive fungal infection such as 
aspergillosis, candidiasis, pneumocystosis, histoplasmosis, 
coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis should be suspected if 
patients develop a serious systemic illness. Consultation 
with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and 
treatment of invasive fungal infections should be consulted 
at an early stage when investigating these patients, and 
initiation of appropriate empiric antifungal therapy should 
be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed 
taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection 
and the risks of anti-fungal therapy.

1 hour during maintenance therapy. The package

performed to assess the effect of shortened infusion 
duration on the risk of infusion-related reactions. This 
analysis compared infliximab administered at a low infusion 
rate (?6 mg/kg/2-hr) to infliximab administered at a high 
infusion rate (>6 mg/kg/2-hr equivalent to >3 mg/kg/1-
hr), using the high infusion rate as a surrogate for a 
shortened infusion duration. The results of this analysis 
showed that 13% and 19% of patients receiving infliximab

at a low infusion rate with or without concomitant 
immunomodulators, respectively, experienced an infusion-
related reaction. This compares to 15% and 16% of 
patients receiving infliximab at a high infusion rate, with or 
without concomitant immunomodulators, respectively. The 
proportion of patients experiencing a serious infusion-
related reaction was 0.4%-0.7% regardless of the infusion 
rate. In a subset of patients treated with 5 or 10 mg/kg 
throughout the complete study period (ulcerative colitis 
studies), a similar pattern as in the overall population was 
seen. Overall based on the data provided, in carefully 
selected adult patients who have tolerated at least 3 initial 
2-hour infusions of Remicade (induction phase) and are 
receiving maintenance therapy, consideration may be given 
to administering subsequent infusions over a period of not 
less than 1 hour. If an infusion reaction occurs in 
association with a shortened infusion, a slower infusion rate 
may be considered for future infusions if treatment is to be 
continued. Shortened infusions at doses >6 mg/kg have 
not been studied.

like reaction" as a rare undesirable effect. The 
Package leaflet is updated accordingly. This variation

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
received through 23 February 2010 from clinical studies, 
solicited sources, including registries, and spontaneous 
sources was conducted. A total of 18 cases originated from 
clinical studies, 12 of which were excluded from the review 
as they involved subjects with pre-existing sarcoidosis. The 
remaining 6 cases (4 serious, 2 non-serious) were reported 
from clinical studies involving an approved indication for 
infliximab and reflected new-onset sarcoidosis. A total of 12 
solicited cases of sarcoid-like reaction were identified (9 
serious, 3 non-serious) of which 4 serious cases were 
evaluable. Forty-nine (49) spontaneous cases, including 14 
cases reported from the literature were identified. New 
onset sarcoid-like reaction involving infliximab at the time 
of the event was reflected in 25 evaluable spontaneous 
cases. In the majority of cases, the sarcoid-like reaction 
resolved after discontinuation of infliximab, which may 
suggest an association between infliximab and sarcoid-like 
reaction. In the general population (not treated with 
infliximab), sarcoidosis resolves in the majority of patients. 
The difference may be in the time to resolution which was 
less than 1 year in this case series and seems to be less 
than that reported in the general population.  
Page 35/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, based on this cumulative review of cases of 
sarcoid-like reaction with infliximab, sarcoid-like reaction is 
considered an ADR for infliximab. Key factors supporting 
this conclusion include literature reports of sarcoidosis with 
TNF-alpha inhibitors, and a small number of well-
documented cases of sarcoid-like reaction associated with 
infliximab therapy reported to the MAH. There is no clear 
mechanism for the development of sarcoid-like reactions 
due to TNF alpha inhibition nevertheless the risk cannot be 
excluded. The frequency chosen for this event is rare, 0.07 
per 100 subject-years (95% CI: 0.02, 0.17). This is based 
on the incidence of sarcoidosis

viral infections, some of which were serious. The product 
information currently lists viral infections as an ADR in the 
undesirable effects table in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC currently list several types 
of infections however, viral infections is not listed. Viral 
infection has therefore been added to the existing list of 
serious infections in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The product information already advises against concurrent 
use of infliximab with anakinra due to the increased risk of 
serious infections. Because an increased risk of neutropenia 
Page 36/66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was also noted during the concurrent administration of 
anakinra and another TNF-blocking agent, section 4.4 of 
the SmPC has been updated to detail this risk. 
In clinical practice switching between the various biologic 
DMARDs available for treatment occurs. As each of these 
products is associated with increased risk of infections, it is 
possible that temporal overlap of their administration and 
exposure could exacerbate that risk. Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC has therefore been updated advising that monitoring 
for evidence of infection should continue during the 
transition from one biological DMARD product to another. 
There have been reports of pancytopenia, leukopenia, 
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving 
TNF-blockers, including infliximab. Several mechanisms 
behind cell depletion have been proposed. Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC has been updated with details on these 
haematological reactions. Patients should also be advised 
to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs 
and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. 
persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor). Discontinuation 
of Remicade therapy should be considered in patients with 
confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities.

paediatric and young adult patients with infliximab showed 
that thirty-five malignancies have been reported in patients 
22 years of age or younger who were exposed to infliximab 
at age 18 or younger. Six cases described patients with 
maternal (in utero) or paternal exposure. There were 16 
lymphomas/leukaemias and 13 solid tumours reported. 
Twenty five malignancies were reported with concomitant 
use of immunosuppressants. Some of the reported tumour

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
types are not unexpected in a paediatric population and 
Package Leaflet 
some have been observed in the setting of 
immunosuppression. A few of the malignancies appear to 
be unusual occurrences in a paediatric population. Based on 
the data presented, a causal relationship between 
infliximab and the development of paediatric malignancies 
cannot be established. It is possible that concomitant 
exposure to other immunosuppressants and/or presence of 
underlying autoimmune diseases were contributory factors. 
Nevertheless, given its mechanism of action as TNF-
blocking agent it cannot be excluded that infliximab may be 
also a contributing factor in the development of the 
observed malignancies. Therefore, mention is made in the 
SmPC that cases of malignancies in the post-marketing 
setting have been reported among children, adolescents 
and young adults (up to 22 years of age) treated with TNF-
blocking agents, including infliximab.  
Separately a cumulative review of leukaemia cases 
reported with infliximab use from clinical trials, disease 
specific registries, postmarketing reports and published 
literature did not establish a causal relationship between 
the development of leukaemia and infliximab or TNF-
antagonists use. Nevertheless, part of the reviewed data 
suggests that there may be an increased risk of leukaemia 
in patients treated with TNF-antagonists, including 
infliximab. As a result, the SmPC includes a warning that 
cases of leukaemia have been reported in patients treated 
with TNF-ant

organisms, with ectoparasitic and nematodal infections 
accounting for a small minority. While the data in this 
regard can not be refuted, the biological mechanism by 
which infliximab leads to an increase in infections of 
bacterial, viral, and fungal types appears not one which 
would limit the spectrum of parasitic infections to protozoal 
organisms. Therefore "parasitic infections" has been added 
a new adverse event in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Serious 
infections are a well-known safety concern for all TNF-? 
inhibitors. The current warnings and precautions for use 
section insistently alerts prescribers to take appropriate 
action with respect to infections i.e. early recognition of 
atypical clinical presentations of serious infections is critical 
in order to minimize delays in diagnosis and treatment. 
Nevertheless, a review of rare and unusual infections in 
PSUR 19 and 20 showed that such infections may, in some 
cases, present in a very typical manner but are unlikely to 
be recognized given their low prevalence in clinics outside 
of an infectious diseases clinic. Therefore, early recognition 
of rare and unusual infections which may actually have a 
typical presentation has been also reflected in section 4.4 
for completeness of the warning.

healthcare professionals recognise in timely manner cases 
of infection, in particular cases of invasive fungal infections 
in patients treated with infliximab. The benefit risk of the 
treatment in patients which have travelled in areas of high 
risk of endemic fungal infections must be considered. This 
is also applicable in patients which develop a new infection 
while undergoing treatment. In certain cases, the 
treatment might need to be stopped.  
The product information was therefore updated to 
strengthen the currently existing warnings on infections 
and serious infections.

severe active CD, the time for assessment of initial 
response was extended to 6 weeks, after the second dose. 
However, if a patient does not achieve a response after the 
second dose, no further treatment should be given.  
Although comparative data are lacking, limited data are 
available in patients with severe CD and fistulising CD that 
indicate that some patients may regain response with dose 
escalation, although continued therapy should be carefully 
reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of 
therapeutic benefit after dose adjustment. 
Improvements in quality of life measures, reduction in 
disease-related hospitalisations and corticosteroid use were 
seen in patients with severe active CD and fistulising active 
CD disease. In patients with fistulising disease it was shown 
that maintenance therapy with infliximab reduced disease-

with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease who were either smokers or ex-smokers. Although 
small and with uncertainties, the study showed that there is 
a difference in malignancy incidence observed between 
infliximab and placebo treated patients.   
This study provided a signal for increased incidence of 
smoking-related malignancies with inflixmab exposure, in a 
patient population with a heavy smoking history, and thus 
being at high risk for malignancy.

Very rare cases of jaundice and non-infectious hepatitis,

Isolated cases of liver failure resulting in liver 
transplantation or death have occurred. A warning was 
introduced in the Product Information, as patients with 
symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction should be evaluated 
for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or elevations of 
liver enzymes above upper limit of normal develop, 
Remicade should be discontinued.

In view of the limited experience the post-marketing 
reports available do not indicate unexpected effects on 
pregnancy outcome. However, the available clinical 
experience is too limited to exclude a risk, therefore the 
administration of infliximab is not recommended during 
pregnancy. Attempts are being made to explore possible 
ways of gathering birth outcome data for infants born of 
mothers exposed to infliximab and follow-up of infants up 
to 1 year after birth. 
Following the experience gathered from the use of 
Remicade from clinical studies delayed hypersensitivity 
reactions are categorised as uncommon. Signs and 
symptoms included pain in the muscles and/or pain in a 
joint with fever and/or rash, with some patients 
experiencing itching, swelling of the face, hand or lip due to 
fluid, difficulty in swallowing, urticaria, sore throat and

"Undesirable effects" on malignancies and 
lymphoproliferative disorders. The purpose was to revise 
the warnings section and to include details of the post-
marketing experience on malignancies and 
lymphoproliferative disorders, including incidence.   
In clinical trials, more cases of lymphoma have been 
observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist 
compared with control patients. However, the occurrence 
was rare. Additionally, there is an increased background 
lymphoma risk in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-
standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, which 
complicates the risk estimation. With the current 
knowledge, a possible risk for the development of 
lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with a 
TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded.

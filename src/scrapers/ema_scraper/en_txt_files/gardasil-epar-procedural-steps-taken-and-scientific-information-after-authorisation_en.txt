The results have shown that anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 
geometric mean titres (GMTs), peaked at Month 7 post-
vaccination, gradually declined through Month 24, and were 
generally stable thereafter, remaining above the serostatus 
cut-offs through Month 168. The percentage of subjects 
remaining seropositive through Month 168 remained >90% 
for HPV types 6, 11, and 16, and 52% for HPV type 18,

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update 
the information following final results from two Long-
term follow-up (LTFU) studies: 
- Protocol V501-020-21, a category 3 study part of 
the pharmacovigilance activities foreseen in the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) of the qHPV vaccine. It is an 
extension of study V501-020 (the pivotal efficacy 
study of qHPV vaccine in young men 16 to 26 years 
of age) to assess effectiveness and immunogenicity 
of the qHPV vaccine for up to 10 years of follow-up. 
Submission of this final report fulfils Gardasil MEA 
070.3 and Silgard MEA 069.3. 
- Extension of Protocol V501-16. The base study was 
an MSD-sponsored randomized clinical trial that 
assessed the immunogenicity of a 2 dose Schedule of 
the qHPV in adolescents 9 to 13 years of age 
compared to a 3-dose schedule in young women16 
to 26 years of age. The study provides additional 
immunogenicity follow-up through 5 years post-
vaccination. Submission of this study fulfils Gardasil 
REC 083 and Silgard REC 080. 
RMP version 12 was also submitted, updated to 
Labelling and 
clinical studies (V501-020-21 and V501-16), Section 5.1 of 
PL 
the SmPC was amended to update figures and reflect 
effectiveness and sustained immunogenicity of qHPV 
vaccine when administered in young men 16 to 26 years of 
age. Additionally, the relevant sub-section was updated to

726/2004, the European Commission requested on 
09 July 2015 the opinion of the European Medicines 
Agency on whether there is evidence of a causal 
association between HPV vaccination and CRPS 
and/or POTS, and if available information may 
require updates to the advice to healthcare 
professionals and patients, including changes to 
product information or other regulatory measures on 
the marketing authorisations concerned. 
As the request results from the evaluation of data 
resulting from pharmacovigilance activities, the 
CHMP opinion should be adopted on the basis of a 
recommendation of the Pharmacovigilance Risk

concomitant use of Gardasil with other vaccines that might 
be administered to the same age group. At the time of the 
marketing authorisation the MAH committed to perform a 
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of the concomitant administration of the 
first dose of Gardasil with a diphtheria(d)-tetanus(T)-
acellular pertussis(ap)-inactivated poliovirus(IPV) (dTap-
IPV) vaccine versus the administration of Gardasil non-
concomitantly with dTap-IPV in healthy male and female 
adolescents 11 to 17 years of age. 
The study is finalised and results show no significant 
interference with antibody response to any of the 
components of either vaccine. Gardasil can therefore be 
given with a combined booster vaccine containing 
diphtheria and tetanus with either pertussis [acellular, 
component] and/or poliomyelitis [inactivated]  (dTap, dT-
IPV, dTap-IPV vaccines) at a separate injection site 
(another part of your body, e.g. the other arm or leg)

identified nineteen reports with syncope accompanied by 
tonic-clonic movements. The onset of syncopal episodes 
and accompanying movements occurred in very close 
temporal relationship following administration of the 
vaccine.  The duration of the episodes was generally very 
brief, and there was the absence of other hallmarks of 
seizures in the descriptions of the events. The description 
of seizure-like activity found in these reports was typical of 
tonic clonic movements known to accompany syncopal 
episodes. The product information was revised to add 
"syncope sometimes accompanied by tonic-clonic 
movements" in order to alert health care professionals of 
the possibility of abnormal movements accompanying 
syncopal episodes; this information is expected to aid

and Protocol 015 (Future II), with efficacy data at ~3.5 
years. 
The end-of-study results confirm and strengthen the 
efficacy findings in the marketing authorisation application. 
Vaccine efficacy against the primary endpoint, HPV 16/18-
related CIN 2/3 or AIS, remained high and there is no 
evidence of waning immunity. 
Efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related genital warts 
(condyloma acuminata) remained high in all study 
populations.  
The analysis of public health impact revealed a noticeable 
reduction in the overall burden of CIN 2/3 or AIS in the 
HPV-naïve population whereas the impact on the general 
population was limited. As regards population benefit, 
clinically relevant reductions in the incidence of colposcopy, 
cervical biopsy and definitive therapy procedures were 
observed in the vaccine group in the HPV-naïve population, 
and in the general population. 
There was no evidence of therapeutic vaccine efficacy in 
subjects with evidence of infection/disease at the time of 
vaccination. 
The analysed safety report did not include any new or 
unexpected reports of adverse experiences.

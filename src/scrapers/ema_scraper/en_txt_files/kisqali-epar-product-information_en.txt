CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Kisqali is indicated for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in 
combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women 
who have received prior endocrine therapy. 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinising 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Kisqali should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 600 mg (three 200 mg film-coated tablets) of ribociclib once daily for 
21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment, resulting in a complete cycle of 28 days. The 
treatment should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Kisqali should be used together with 2.5 mg letrozole or another aromatase inhibitor or with 500 mg 
fulvestrant.

When Kisqali is used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, the aromatase inhibitor should be 
taken orally once daily continuously throughout the 28-day cycle. Please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) of the aromatase inhibitor for additional details. 
When Kisqali is used in combination with fulvestrant, fulvestrant is administered intramuscularly on 
days 1, 15 and 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the SmPC of fulvestrant for additional 
details. 
Treatment of pre- and perimenopausal women with the approved Kisqali combinations should also 
include an LHRH agonist in accordance with local clinical practice. 
Kisqali can be taken with or without food (see section 4.5). Patients should be encouraged to take their 
dose at approximately the same time each day, preferably in the morning. If the patient vomits after 
taking the dose or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken that day. The next prescribed 
dose should be taken at the usual time. 
Dose modifications 
Management of severe or intolerable adverse reactions (ARs) may require temporary dose 
interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Kisqali. If dose reduction is required, the recommended 
dose reduction guidelines are listed in Table 1.

Refer to the SmPC for the co-administered aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant or LHRH agonist for dose 
modification guidelines and other relevant safety information in the event of toxicity. 
Dose modification for use of Kisqali with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided and an alternative concomitant 
medicinal product with less potential to inhibit CYP3A4 inhibition should be considered. If patients 
must be given a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor concomitantly with ribociclib, the Kisqali dose should be 
reduced to 400 mg once daily (see section 4.5). 
In patients who have had their dose reduced to 400 mg ribociclib daily and in whom initiation of 
co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the dose should be further reduced 
to 200 mg. 
In patients who have had their dose reduced to 200 mg ribociclib daily and in whom initiation of 
co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, Kisqali treatment should be 
interrupted. 
Due to inter-patient variability, the recommended dose adjustments may not be optimal in all patients, 
therefore close monitoring of signs of toxicity is recommended. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, 
the Kisqali dose should be changed to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor after at least 5 half-lives of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. A starting dose 
of 200 mg is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. Kisqali has not been studied in 
breast cancer patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). 
Patients with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) can 
have increased (less than 2-fold) exposure to ribociclib and the starting dose of 400 mg Kisqali once 
daily is recommended (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Kisqali in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Kisqali should be taken orally once daily with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole 
and should not be chewed, crushed or split prior to swallowing. No tablet should be ingested if it is 
broken, cracked or otherwise not intact. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to peanut, soya or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Critical visceral disease 
The efficacy and safety of ribociclib have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease. 
Neutropenia 
Based on the severity of the neutropenia, treatment with Kisqali may have to be interrupted, reduced 
or discontinued as described in Table 2 (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Hepatobiliary toxicity 
Liver function tests should be performed before initiating treatment with Kisqali. After initiating 
treatment, liver function should be monitored (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Based on the severity of the transaminase elevations, treatment with Kisqali may have to be 
interrupted, reduced or discontinued as described in Table 3 (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Recommendations for patients who have elevated AST/ALT grade ≥ 3 at baseline have not been 
established. 
QT interval prolongation 
In study E2301 (MONALEESA-7), a QTcF interval increase >60 msec from baseline was observed in 
14/87 (16.1%) patients receiving Kisqali plus tamoxifen and in 18/245 (7.3%) patients receiving 
Kisqali plus a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). Kisqali is not recommended to be used in 
combination with tamoxifen (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
ECG should be assessed before initiating treatment. Treatment with Kisqali should be initiated only in 
patients with QTcF values less than 450 msec. ECG should be repeated at approximately day 14 of the 
first cycle and at the beginning of the second cycle, then as clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes (including potassium, calcium, phosphorus and 
magnesium) should be performed before initiating treatment, at the beginning of the first 6 cycles and 
then as clinically indicated. Any abnormality should be corrected before initiating treatment with 
Kisqali and during treatment with Kisqali. 
The use of Kisqali should be avoided in patients who already have or who are at significant risk of 
developing QTc prolongation. This includes patients: 
• 
• 
with long QT syndrome; 
with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, 
congestive heart failure, unstable angina and bradyarrhythmias; 
with electrolyte abnormalities. 
• 
The use of Kisqali with medicinal products known to prolong QTc interval and/or strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors should be avoided as this may lead to clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTcF 
interval (see sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.1). If treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, 
the dose should be reduced to 400 mg once daily (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Based on the observed QT prolongation during treatment, treatment with Kisqali may have to be 
interrupted, reduced or discontinued as described in Table 4 (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.2). 
Severe cutaneous reactions 
Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has been reported with Kisqali treatment. If signs and symptoms 
suggestive of severe cutaneous reactions (e.g. progressive widespread skin rash often with blisters or 
mucosal lesions) appear, Kisqali should be discontinued immediately. 
Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis has been reported with Kisqali. Patients should be 
monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis which may include hypoxia, cough 
and dyspnoea and dose modifications should be managed in accordance with Table 5 (see section 4.2). 
Based on the severity of the ILD/pneumonitis, which may be fatal, Kisqali may require dose 
interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 5 (see section 4.2). 
Blood creatinine increase 
Ribociclib may cause blood creatinine increase as an inhibitor of the renal transporters organic cation 
transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1), which are involved in the 
active secretion of creatinine from the proximal tubules (see section 4.5). In case of blood creatinine 
increase while on treatment, it is recommended that further assessment of the renal function be 
performed to exclude renal impairment. 
CYP3A4 substrates 
Ribociclib is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor at the 600 mg dose and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor at the 
400 mg dose. Thus, ribociclib may interact with medicinal products which are metabolised via 
CYP3A4, which may lead to increased serum concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (see section 4.5). 
Caution is recommended in case of concomitant use with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow 
therapeutic index and the SmPC of the other product should be consulted for the recommendations 
regarding co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
The recommended starting dose of 200 mg for patients with severe renal impairment is estimated to 
result in approximately 45% lower exposure compared with the standard starting dose in patients with 
normal renal function. The efficacy at this starting dose has not been studied. Caution should be used 
in patients with severe renal impairment with close monitoring for signs of toxicity (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use an effective method of contraception while 
taking Kisqali and for at least 21 days after the last dose (see section 4.6). 
Soya lecithin 
Kisqali contains soya lecithin. Patients who are hypersensitive to peanut or soya should not take 
Kisqali (see section 4.3). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Substances that may increase ribociclib plasma concentrations 
Ribociclib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. Therefore, medicinal products that can influence 
CYP3A4 enzyme activity may alter the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib. Co-administration of the 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir (100 mg twice daily for 14 days) with a single 400 mg dose of 
ribociclib increased ribociclib exposure (AUCinf) and the peak concentration (Cmax) in healthy subjects 
3.2 and 1.7-fold, respectively, relative to a single 400 mg ribociclib dose given alone. Cmax and AUClast 
for LEQ803 (a prominent metabolite of ribociclib accounting for less than 10% of parent exposure) 
decreased by 96% and 98%, respectively. 
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors including, but not limited to, the following must be 
avoided: clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil and voriconazole (see 
section 4.4). Alternative concomitant medicinal products with less potential to inhibit CYP3A4 should 
be considered and patients should be monitored for ribociclib-related ARs (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.2). 
If co-administration of Kisqali with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, the dose of Kisqali 
should be reduced as described in section 4.2. However, there are no clinical data with these dose 
adjustments. Due to inter-patient variability, the recommended dose adjustments may not be optimal 
in all patients, therefore close monitoring for ribociclib-related ARs is recommended. In the event of 
ribociclib-related toxicity, the dose should be modified or treatment should be interrupted until toxicity 
is resolved (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). If the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, and after at least 
5 half-lives of the CYP3A4 inhibitor (refer to the SmPC of the CYP3A4 inhibitor in question), Kisqali 
should be resumed at the same dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that at a 600 mg dose of ribociclib, a 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (erythromycin) may increase ribociclib steady-state Cmax and AUC 
1.2-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively. For patients who had their ribociclib dose reduced to 400 mg once 
daily, the increase of the steady-state Cmax and AUC was estimated to be 1.4- and 2.1-fold, 
respectively. The effect at the 200 mg once-daily dose was predicted to be a 1.7- and 2.8-fold increase, 
respectively. No dose adjustments of ribociclib are required at initiation of treatment with mild or 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, monitoring of ribociclib-related ARs is recommended. 
Patients should be instructed to avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice. These are known to inhibit 
cytochrome CYP3A4 enzymes and may increase the exposure to ribociclib. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Substances that may decrease ribociclib plasma concentrations 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 14 days) with a single 
600 mg dose of ribociclib decreased the ribociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 89% and 81%, respectively, 
relative to a single 600 mg ribociclib dose given alone in healthy subjects. LEQ803 Cmax increased 
1.7-fold and AUCinf decreased by 27%, respectively. The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
may therefore lead to decreased exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. The 
concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided, including, but not limited to, 
phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine and St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). An alternative 
concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered. 
The effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inducer on ribociclib exposure has not been studied. 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that a moderate CYP3A4 inducer 
(efavirenz) may decrease steady-state ribociclib Cmax and AUC by 51% and 70%, respectively. The 
concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers may therefore lead to decreased exposure and 
consequently a risk for impaired efficacy, in particular in patients treated with ribociclib at 400 mg or 
200 mg once daily. 
Substances that may have plasma concentrations altered by Kisqali 
Ribociclib is a moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and may interact with medicinal substrates that 
are metabolised via CYP3A4, which can lead to increased serum concentrations of the concomitantly 
used medicinal product. 
Co-administration of midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) with multiple doses of Kisqali (400 mg) 
increased the midazolam exposure by 280% (3.80-fold) in healthy subjects, compared with 
administration of midazolam alone. Simulations using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models 
suggested that Kisqali given at the clinically relevant dose of 600 mg is expected to increase the 
midazolam AUC by 5.2-fold. Therefore, in general, when ribociclib is co-administered with other 
medicinal products, the SmPC of the other medicinal product must be consulted for the 
recommendations regarding co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Caution is recommended in 
case of concomitant use with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (see 
section 4.4). The dose of a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index, including but 
not limited to alfentanil, ciclosporin, everolimus, fentanyl, sirolimus and tacrolimus, may need to be 
reduced as ribociclib can increase their exposure. 
Concomitant administration of ribociclib at the 600 mg dose with the following CYP3A4 substrates 
should be avoided: alfuzosin, amiodarone, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, ergotamine, 
dihydroergotamine, quetiapine, lovastatin, simvastatin, sildenafil, midazolam, triazolam. 
Co-administration of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) with multiple doses of Kisqali (400 mg) increased 
the caffeine exposure by 20% (1.20-fold) in healthy subjects, compared with administration of 
caffeine alone. At the clinically relevant dose of 600 mg, simulations using PBPK models predicted 
only weak inhibitory effects of ribociclib on CYP1A2 substrates (<2-fold increase in AUC). 
Substances that are substrates of transporters 
In vitro evaluations indicated that ribociclib has a potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters 
P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and BSEP. Caution and monitoring for toxicity 
are advised during concomitant treatment with sensitive substrates of these transporters which exhibit 
a narrow therapeutic index, including but not limited to digoxin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin 
and metformin. 
Drug-food interactions 
Kisqali can be administered with or without food (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal products that elevate gastric pH 
Ribociclib exhibits high solubility at or below pH 4.5 and in bio-relevant media (at pH 5.0 and 6.5). 
Co-administration of ribociclib with medicinal products that elevate the gastric pH was not evaluated 
in a clinical study; however, altered ribociclib absorption was not observed in population 
pharmacokinetic and non–compartmental pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Drug-drug interaction between ribociclib and letrozole 
Data from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer and population pharmacokinetic analysis 
indicated no drug interaction between ribociclib and letrozole following co-administration of these 
medicinal products. 
Drug-drug interaction between ribociclib and anastrozole 
Data from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant drug 
interaction between ribociclib and anastrozole following co-administration of these medicinal 
products. 
Drug-drug interaction between ribociclib and fulvestrant 
Data from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer indicated no clinically relevant effects of 
fulvestrant on ribociclib exposure following co-administration of these medicinal products. 
Drug-drug interaction between ribociclib and tamoxifen 
Data from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer indicated that tamoxifen exposure was 
increased approximately 2-fold following co-administration of ribociclib and tamoxifen. 
Drug-drug interactions between ribociclib and oral contraceptives 
Drug-drug interaction studies between ribociclib and oral contraceptives have not been conducted (see 
section 4.6). 
Anticipated interactions 
Anti-arrhythmic medicinal products and other medicinal products that may prolong the QT interval 
Co-administration of Kisqali with medicinal products with a known potential to prolong the QT 
interval such as anti-arrhythmic medicinal products (including, but not limited to, amiodarone, 
disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol), and other medicinal products that are known to 
prolong the QT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, 
ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, azithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, bepridil, pimozide 
and intravenous ondansetron) should be avoided (see section 4.4). Kisqali is also not recommended to 
be used in combination with tamoxifen (see sections 4.1, 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Pregnancy status should be verified prior to starting treatment with Kisqali. 
Women of childbearing potential who are receiving Kisqali should use effective contraception (e.g. 
double-barrier contraception) during therapy and for at least 21 days after stopping treatment with 
Kisqali. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on findings in animals, 
ribociclib can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman (see section 5.3). Kisqali is 
not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known if ribociclib is present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of ribociclib on 
the breast-fed infant or the effects of ribociclib on milk production. Ribociclib and its metabolites 
readily passed into the milk of lactating rats. Patients receiving Kisqali should not breast-feed for at 
least 21 days after the last dose. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data available regarding effects of ribociclib on fertility. Based on animal studies, 
ribociclib may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Kisqali may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised 
to be cautious when driving or using machines in case they experience fatigue, dizziness or vertigo 
during treatment with Kisqali (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions (ARs) (reported at a frequency ≥20% ) in the pooled dataset for 
which the frequency for Kisqali plus any combination exceeds the frequency for placebo plus any 
combination were neutropenia, infections, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, leukopenia, vomiting, headache, 
constipation, alopecia, cough, rash, back pain, anaemia and abnormal liver function tests. 
The most common grade 3/4 ARs (reported at a frequency of >2%) in the pooled dataset for which the 
frequency for Kisqali plus any combination exceeds the frequency for placebo plus any combination 
were neutropenia, leukopenia, abnormal liver function tests, lymphopenia, infections, back pain, 
anaemia, fatigue, hypophosphataemia and vomiting. 
Dose reduction due to adverse events, regardless of causality, occurred in 39.5% of patients receiving 
Kisqali in the phase III clinical studies regardless of the combination and permanent discontinuation 
was reported in 8.7% of patients receiving Kisqali and any combination in the phase III clinical 
studies. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The overall safety evaluation of Kisqali is based on the pooled dataset from 1,065 patients who 
received Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy (N=582 in combination with an aromatase 
inhibitor and N=483 in combination with fulvestrant) and who were included in the randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical studies (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-7 NSAI 
subgroup and MONALEESA-3) in HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
Additional ADRs were identified post-marketing. 
The median duration of exposure to study treatment across the pooled phase III studies dataset was 
19.2 months, with 61.7% patients exposed ≥12 months.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction (75.4%) and a grade 3 or 4 decrease in 
neutrophil counts (based on laboratory findings) was reported in 62.0% of patients receiving Kisqali 
plus any combination in the phase III studies. 
Among the patients who had grade 2, 3 or 4 neutropenia, the median time to onset was 17 days, for 
those patients who had an event. The median time to resolution of grade ≥3 (to normalisation or 
grade <3) was 12 days in the Kisqali plus any combination arms following treatment interruption 
and/or reduction and/or discontinuation. Febrile neutropenia was reported in about 1.7% of patients 
exposed to Kisqali in the phase III studies. Patients should be instructed to report any fever promptly. 
Based on its severity, neutropenia was managed by laboratory monitoring, dose interruption and/or 
dose modification. Treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia was low (0.8%) (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
Hepatobiliary toxicity 
In the phase III clinical studies, hepatobiliary toxicity events occurred in a higher proportion of 
patients in the Kisqali plus any combination arms compared with the placebo plus any combination 
arms (27.3% versus 19.6%, respectively), with more grade 3/4 adverse events reported in the patients 
treated with Kisqali plus any combination (13.2% versus 6.1%, respectively). Increases in 
transaminases were observed. Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT (11.2% versus 1.7%) and AST (7.8% 
versus 2.1%) were reported in the Kisqali and placebo arms, respectively. Concurrent elevations in 
ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin greater than two 
times the upper limit of normal, with normal alkaline phosphatase, in the absence of cholestasis 
occurred in 6 patients (4 patients in Study A2301 [MONALEESA-2], whose levels recovered to 
normal within 154 days and 2 patients in Study F2301 [MONALEESA-3], whose levels recovered to 
normal in 121 and 532 days, respectively, after discontinuation of Kisqali). There were no such cases 
reported in Study E2301 (MONALEESA-7). 
Dose interruptions and/or adjustments due to hepatobiliary toxicity events were reported in 12.3% of 
Kisqali plus any combination treated patients, primarily due to ALT increased (7.9%) and/or AST 
increased (7.3%). Discontinuation of treatment with Kisqali plus any combination due to abnormal 
liver function tests or hepatotoxicity occurred in 2.4% and 0.3% of patients respectively (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
In the phase III clinical studies, 70.9% (90/127) of grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevation events occurred 
within the first 6 months of treatment. Among the patients who had grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation, 
the median time to onset was 92 days for the Kisqali plus any combination arms. The median time to 
resolution (to normalisation or grade ≤2) was 21 days in the Kisqali plus any combination arms. 
QT prolongation 
In study E2301 (MONALEESA-7), the observed mean QTcF increase from baseline was 
approximately 10 msec higher in the tamoxifen plus placebo subgroup compared with the NSAI plus 
placebo subgroup, suggesting that tamoxifen alone had a QTcF prolongation effect which can 
contribute to the QTcF values observed in the Kisqali plus tamoxifen group. In the placebo arm, a 
QTcF interval increase of >60 msec from baseline occurred in 6/90 (6.7%) patients receiving 
tamoxifen and in no patients receiving a NSAI (see section 5.2). A QTcF interval increase of 
>60 msec from baseline was observed in 14/87 (16.1%) patients receiving Kisqali plus tamoxifen and 
in 18/245 (7.3%) patients receiving Kisqali plus a NSAI. Kisqali is not recommended to be used in 
combination with tamoxifen (see section 5.1). 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the phase III clinical studies 9.3% of patients in the Kisqali plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant 
arms and 3.5% in the placebo plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms had at least one event of QT 
interval prolongation (including ECG QT prolonged and syncope). Review of ECG data showed 
15 patients (1.4%) had >500 msec post-baseline QTcF value, and 61 patients (5.8%) had a >60 msec 
increase from baseline in QTcF intervals. There were no reported cases of torsade de pointes. Dose 
interruptions/adjustments were reported in 2.9% of Kisqali plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant 
treated patients due to electrocardiogram QT prolonged and syncope. 
The analysis of ECG data showed 55 patients (5.2%) and 12 patients (1.5%) with at least one 
>480 msec post-baseline QTcF for the Kisqali plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms and the 
placebo plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms, respectively. Amongst the patients who had 
QTcF prolongation >480 msec, the median time to onset was 15 days regardless of the combination 
and these changes were reversible with dose interruption and/or dose reduction (see sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 5.2). 
Patients with renal impairment 
In the three pivotal studies, 341 patients with mild renal impairment and 97 patients with moderate 
renal impairment were treated with ribociclib. No patient with severe renal impairment was enrolled 
(see section 5.1). There was a correlation between the degree of renal impairment at baseline and 
blood creatinine values during the treatment. Slightly increased rates of QT prolongation and 
thrombocytopenia were observed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. For monitoring 
and dose adjustment recommendations for these toxicities see sections 4.2. and 4.4. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is only limited experience with reported cases of overdose with Kisqali. In the event of an 
overdose, symptoms such as nausea and vomiting may occur. In addition, haematological (e.g. 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) toxicity and possible QTc prolongation may occur. General 
supportive care should be initiated in all cases of overdose as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EF02 
Mechanism of action 
Ribociclib is a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, resulting in 50% 
inhibition (IC50) values of 0.01 (4.3 ng/ml) and 0.039 μM (16.9 ng/ml) in biochemical assays, 
respectively. These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins and play a crucial role in 
signalling pathways which lead to cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The cyclin 
D-CDK4/6 complex regulates cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma 
protein (pRb). 
In vitro, ribociclib decreased pRb phosphorylation, leading to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, 
and reduced cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines. In vivo, treatment with single-agent ribociclib 
led to tumour regressions which correlated with inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vivo studies using patient-derived oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer xenograft model 
combinations of ribociclib and antioestrogens (i.e. letrozole) resulted in superior tumour growth 
inhibition with sustained tumour regression and delayed tumour regrowth after stopping dosing 
compared to each substance alone. Additionally, in vivo antitumour activity of ribociclib in 
combination with fulvestrant was assessed in immune-deficient mice bearing the ZR751 ER+ human 
breast cancer xenografts and the combination with fulvestrant resulted in complete tumour growth 
inhibition. 
When tested in a panel of breast cancer cell lines with known ER status, ribociclib demonstrated to be 
more efficacious in ER+ breast cancer cell lines than in the ER- ones. In the preclinical models tested 
so far, intact pRb was required for ribociclib activity. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Serial, triplicate ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady state to evaluate the effect 
of ribociclib on the QTc interval in patients with advanced cancer. A 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis included a total of 997 patients treated with ribociclib at 
doses ranging from 50 to 1200 mg. The analysis suggested that ribociclib causes 
concentration-dependent increases in the QTc interval. The estimated QTcF mean change from 
baseline for 600 mg Kisqali in combination with NSAI or fulvestrant was 22.0 msec (90% CI: 20.56, 
23.44) and 23.7 msec (90% CI: 22.31, 25.08), respectively at the geometric mean Cmax at steady-state 
compared to 34.7 msec (90% CI: 31.64, 37.78) in combination with tamoxifen (see section 4.4). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Study CLEE011A2301 (MONALEESA-2) 
Kisqali was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III clinical 
study in the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, 
advanced breast cancer who received no prior therapy for advanced disease in combination with 
letrozole versus letrozole alone. 
A total of 668 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Kisqali 600 mg and letrozole 
(n=334) or placebo and letrozole (n=334), stratified according to the presence of liver and/or lung 
metastases (Yes [n=292 (44%)]) versus No [n=376 (56%)]). Demographics and baseline disease 
characteristics were balanced and comparable between study arms. Kisqali was given orally at a dose 
of 600 mg daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment in combination with 
letrozole 2.5 mg once daily for 28 days. Patients were not allowed to cross over from placebo to 
Kisqali during the study or after progression of disease. 
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 62 years (range 23 to 91). 44.2% patients were aged 
65 years and older, including 69 patients older than 75 years. The patients included were Caucasian 
(82.2%), Asian (7.6%), and Black (2.5%). All patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. In 
the Kisqali arm 46.6% of patients had received chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting 
and 51.3% had received antihormonal therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting prior to study 
entry. 34.1% of patients were de novo. 22.0% of patients had bone-only disease and 58.8% of patients 
had visceral disease. Patients with prior (neo)adjuvant therapy with anastrozole or letrozole must have 
completed this therapy at least 12 months before study randomisation. 
Primary analysis 
The primary endpoint for the study was met at the planned interim analysis conducted after observing 
80% of targeted progression-free survival (PFS) events using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumours (RECIST v1.1), based on the investigator assessment in the full population (all randomised 
patients), and confirmed by a blinded independent central radiological assessment. 
The efficacy results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in patients receiving 
Kisqali plus letrozole compared to patients receiving placebo plus letrozole in the full analysis set 
(hazard ratio of 0.556, 95% CI: 0.429, 0.720, one sided stratified log-rank test p-value 0.00000329) 
with clinically meaningful treatment effect.

The global health status/QoL data showed no relevant difference between the Kisqali plus letrozole 
arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm. 
A more mature update of efficacy data (02 January 2017 cut-off) is provided in Tables 8 and 9. 
Median PFS was 25.3 months (95% CI: 23.0, 30.3) for ribociclib plus letrozole treated patients and 
16.0 months (95% CI: 13.4, 18.2) for patients receiving placebo plus letrozole. 54.7% of patients 
receiving ribociclib plus letrozole were estimated to be progression-free at 24 months compared with 
35.9% in the placebo plus letrozole arm.

A series of pre-specified subgroup PFS analyses was performed based on prognostic factors and 
baseline characteristics to investigate the internal consistency of treatment effect. A reduction in the 
risk of disease progression or death in favour of the Kisqali plus letrozole arm was observed in all 
individual patient subgroups of age, race, prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal 
therapies, liver and/or lung involvement and bone-only metastatic disease. This was evident for 
patients with liver and/or lung metastases (HR of 0.561 [95% CI: 0.424, 0.743], median 
progression-free survival [mPFS] 24.8 months for Kisqali plus letrozole versus 13.4 months for 
letrozole alone), or without liver and/or lung metastases (HR of 0.597 [95% CI: 0.426, 0.837], mPFS 
27.6 months versus 18.2 months).

Study CLEE011E2301 (MONALEESA-7) 
Kisqali was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III clinical 
study in the treatment of pre- and perimenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, 
HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in combination with a NSAI or tamoxifen plus goserelin 
versus placebo in combination with a NSAI or tamoxifen plus goserelin. Patients in MONALEESA-7 
had not received prior endocrine treatment in the advanced breast cancer setting. 
A total of 672 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Kisqali 600 mg plus 
NSAI/tamoxifen plus goserelin (n=335) or placebo plus NSAI/tamoxifen plus goserelin (n=337), 
stratified according to: the presence of liver and/or lung metastases (Yes [n=344 (51.2%)] versus No 
[n=328 (48.8%)]), prior chemotherapy for advanced disease (Yes [n=120 (17.9%)] versus No [n=552 
(82.1%)]), and endocrine combination partner (NSAI and goserelin [n=493 (73.4%)] versus tamoxifen 
and goserelin [n=179 (26.6%)]). Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and 
comparable between study arms. Kisqali was given orally at a dose of 600 mg daily for 21 consecutive 
days followed by 7 days off treatment in combination with NSAI (letrozole 2.5 mg or anastrozole 
1 mg) or tamoxifen (20 mg) orally once daily for 28 days, and goserelin (3.6 mg) subcutaneously 
every 28 days, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were not allowed to cross 
over from placebo to Kisqali during the study or after disease progression. Switching the endocrine 
combination partners was also not permitted. 
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 44 years (range 25 to 58) and 27.7% of patients 
were younger than 40 years old. The majority of patients included were Caucasian (57.7%), Asian 
(29.5%) or Black (2.8%) and nearly all patients (99.0%) had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 
or 1. Prior to study entry, of these 672 patients, 14% of patients had received prior chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease, 32.6% of patients had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant and 18.0% in the 
neoadjuvant setting; 39.6% had received endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting and 0.7% in the 
neoadjuvant setting. In study E2301 40.2% of patients had de novo metastatic disease, 23.7% had 
bone-only disease, and 56.7% had visceral disease.

The study met the primary endpoint at the primary analysis conducted after 318 progression-free 
survival (PFS) events based on the investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1 criteria in the full 
analysis set (all randomised patients). The primary efficacy results were supported by PFS results 
based on blinded independent central radiological assessment. The median follow-up time at the time 
of primary PFS analysis was 19.2 months. 
In the overall study population, the efficacy results demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS in patients receiving Kisqali plus NSAI/tamoxifen plus goserelin compared to 
patients receiving placebo plus NSAI/tamoxifen plus goserelin (hazard ratio of 0.553, 95% CI: 0.441, 
0.694, one-sided stratified log-rank test p-value 9.83x10-8) with clinically meaningful treatment effect. 
Median PFS was 23.8 months (95% CI: 19.2, NE) for Kisqali plus NSAI/tamoxifen plus goserelin 
treated patients and 13.0 months (95% CI: 11.0, 16.4) for patients receiving placebo plus 
NSAI/tamoxifen plus goserelin. 
Distribution of PFS is summarised in the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS in Figure 3.

The results for PFS based on the blinded independent central radiological assessment of a randomly 
selected subset of approximately 40% of randomised patients were supportive of the primary efficacy 
results based on the investigator’s assessment (hazard ratio of 0.427; 95% CI: 0.288, 0.633). 
At the time of the primary PFS analysis overall survival data were not mature with 89 (13%) of deaths 
(HR 0. 916 [95% CI: 0.601, 1.396]). 
Overall response rate (ORR) per investigator assessment based on RECIST v1.1 was higher in the 
Kisqali arm (40.9%; 95% CI: 35.6, 46.2) compared to the placebo arm (29.7%; 95% CI: 24.8, 34.6, 
p=0.00098). The observed clinical benefit rate (CBR) was higher in Kisqali arm (79.1%; 95% CI: 
74.8:83.5) compared to placebo arm (69.7%; 95% CI: 64.8:74.6, p=0.002). 
In the pre-specified subgroup analysis of 495 patients who had received Kisqali or placebo in 
combination with NSAI plus goserelin, the median PFS was 27.5 months (95% CI: 19.1, NE) in the 
Kisqali plus NSAI subgroup and 13.8 months (95% CI: 12.6, 17.4) in the placebo plus NSAI subgroup 
[HR: 0.569; 95% CI: 0.436, 0.743]. Efficacy results are summarised in Table 11 and the Kaplan-Meier

Additionally, the probability of progression on next-line therapy or death (PFS2) in patients who 
received prior ribociclib in the study was lower compared to patients in the placebo arm with an HR of 
0.692 (95% CI: 0.548, 0.875) in the overall study population. The median PFS2 was 32.3 months 
(95% CI: 27.6, 38.3) in the placebo arm and was not reached (95% CI: 39.4, NE) for the ribociclib 
arm. Similar results were observed for the NSAI subgroup, with an HR of 0.660 (95% CI: 0.503, 
0.868) and a median PFS2 of 32.3 months (95% CI: 26.9, 38.3) in the placebo arm versus not reached

Study CLEE011F2301 (MONALEESA-3) 
Kisqali was evaluated in a 2:1 randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III 
clinical study in 726 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative 
advanced breast cancer who had received no or only one line of prior endocrine treatment, in 
combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone. 
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years (range 31 to 89). 46.7% of patients were of 
age 65 years and older, including 13.8% patients of age 75 years and older. The patients included were 
Caucasian (85.3%), Asian (8.7%) or Black (0.7%) and nearly all patients (99.7%) had an ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1. First and second line patients were enrolled in this study (of whom 
19.1% had de novo metastatic disease). Prior to study entry 42.7% of patients had received 
chemotherapy in the adjuvant and 13.1% in the neoadjuvant setting, while 58.5% had received 
endocrine therapy in the adjuvant and 1.4% in the neoadjuvant setting and 21% had received prior 
endocrine therapy in the advanced breast cancer setting. In study F2301 21.2% had bone-only disease 
and 60.5% had visceral disease.

Primary analysis 
The study met the primary endpoint at the primary analysis conducted after 361 progression-free 
survival (PFS) events based on the investigator assessment and using RECIST v1.1 criteria in the full 
analysis set (all randomised patients, 03 November 2017 cut-off). The median follow-up time at the 
time of primary PFS analysis was 20.4 months. 
The primary efficacy results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in patients 
receiving Kisqali plus fulvestrant compared to patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant in the full 
analysis set (hazard ratio of 0.593, 95% CI: 0.480, 0.732, one-sided stratified log-rank test p-value 
4.1x10-7), with an estimated 41% reduction in relative risk of progression or death in favour of the 
Kisqali plus fulvestrant arm. 
The primary efficacy results were supported by a random central audit of 40% imaging subset by a 
blinded independent central radiological assessment (hazard ratio of 0.492; 95% CI: 0.345, 0.703). 
A descriptive update of PFS was performed at the time of the second OS interim analysis, and the 
updated PFS results on the overall population and the subgroups based on prior endocrine therapy are 
summarised in Table 14 and the Kaplan-Meier curve is provided in Figure 7.

Elderly patients 
Of all patients who received Kisqali in studies MONALEESA-2 and MONALEESA-3, representative 
proportions of patients were ≥65 years and ≥75 years of age (see section 5.1). No overall differences in 
safety or effectiveness of Kisqali were observed between these patients and younger patients (see 
section 4.2). 
Patients with renal impairment 
In the three pivotal studies (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-3 and MONALEESA-7), 510 (53.8%) 
patients with normal renal function, 341 (36%) patients with mild renal impairment and 97 (10.2%) 
patients with moderate renal impairment were treated with ribociclib. No patient with severe renal 
impairment was enrolled. PFS results were consistent in patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment who received ribociclib at the starting dose of 600 mg as compared to those with normal 
renal function. The safety profile was generally consistent across renal cohorts (see section 4.8). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Kisqali in all subsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of ribociclib were investigated in patients with advanced cancer following oral 
daily doses of 50 mg to 1200 mg. Healthy subjects received single oral doses ranging from 400 mg to 
600 mg or repeated daily doses (8 days) at 400 mg. 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of ribociclib is not known. 
The time to reach Cmax (Tmax) following ribociclib oral administration was between 1 and 4 hours. 
Ribociclib exhibited slightly over-proportional increases in exposure (Cmax and AUC) across the dose 
range tested (50 to 1200 mg). Following repeated once-daily dosing, steady state was generally 
achieved after 8 days and ribociclib accumulated with a geometric mean accumulation ratio of 2.51 
(range: 0.97 to 6.40). 
Food effect 
Compared to the fasted state, oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of ribociclib film-coated 
tablets with a high-fat, high-calorie meal had no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of 
ribociclib. 
Distribution 
Binding of ribociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 70% and was independent 
of concentration (10 to 10000 ng/ml). Ribociclib was equally distributed between red blood cells and 
plasma with a mean in vivo blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.04. The apparent volume of distribution at 
steady state (Vss/F) was 1090 L based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicated ribociclib is eliminated primarily via hepatic metabolism mainly 
via CYP3A4 in humans. Following oral administration of a single 600 mg dose of [14C] ribociclib to 
humans, the primary metabolic pathways for ribociclib involved oxidation (dealkylation, C and/or 
N-oxygenation, oxidation (-2H)) and combinations thereof. Phase II conjugates of ribociclib phase I 
metabolites involved N-acetylation, sulfation, cysteine conjugation, glycosylation and glucuronidation. 
Ribociclib was the major circulating drug-derived entity in plasma. The major circulating metabolites 
included metabolite M13 (CCI284, N-hydroxylation), M4 (LEQ803, N-demethylation), and M1 
(secondary glucuronide). Clinical activity (pharmacological and safety) of ribociclib was due primarily 
to parent drug, with negligible contribution from circulating metabolites. 
Ribociclib was extensively metabolised, with unchanged drug accounting for 17.3% and 12.1% of the 
dose in faeces and urine, respectively. Metabolite LEQ803 was a significant metabolite in excreta and 
represented approximately 13.9% and 3.74% of the administered dose in faeces and urine, 
respectively. Numerous other metabolites were detected in both faeces and urine in minor amounts 
(≤2.78% of the administered dose). 
Elimination 
The geometric mean plasma effective half-life (based on accumulation ratio) was 32.0 hours (63% 
CV) and the geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 25.5 l/hr (66% CV) at steady state at 
600 mg in patients with advanced cancer. The geometric mean apparent plasma terminal half-life (T1/2) 
of ribociclib ranged from 29.7 to 54.7 hours and the geometric mean CL/F of ribociclib ranged from 
39.9 to 77.5 l/hr at 600 mg across studies in healthy subjects. 
Ribociclib and its metabolites are eliminated mainly via faeces, with a small contribution of the renal 
route. In 6 healthy male subjects, following a single oral dose of [14C] ribociclib, 91.7% of the total 
administered radioactive dose was recovered within 22 days; faeces was the major route of excretion 
(69.1%), with 22.6% of the dose recovered in urine. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Ribociclib exhibited slightly over-proportional increases in exposure (Cmax and AUC) across the dose 
range of 50 mg to 1200 mg following both single dose and repeated doses. This analysis is limited by 
the small sample sizes for most of the dose cohorts with a majority of the data coming from the 
600 mg dose cohort. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib was assessed in a renal impairment 
study that included 14 healthy subjects with normal renal function (absolute Glomerular Filtration 
Rate [aGFR] ≥90 ml/min), 8 subjects with mild renal impairment (aGFR 60 to <90 ml/min), 6 subjects 
with moderate renal impairment (aGFR 30 to <60 ml/min), 7 subjects with severe renal impairment 
(aGFR 15 to <30 ml/min) and 3 subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (aGFR <15 ml/min) at a 
single ribociclib dose of 400 mg. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AUCinf increased 1.6-fold, 1.9-fold and 2.7-fold and Cmax increased 1.8-fold, 1.8-fold and 2.3-fold in 
subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment relative to the exposure in subjects with 
normal renal function. Since the efficacy and safety studies of ribociclib included a large proportion of 
patients with mild renal impairment (see section 5.1), data from the subjects with moderate or severe 
renal impairment in the renal impairment study were also compared with pooled data for the subjects 
with normal renal function and mild renal impairment. Compared to the pooled data for the subjects 
with normal renal function and mild renal impairment, AUCinf increased 1.6-fold and 2.2-fold and Cmax 
increased 1.5-fold and 1.9-fold in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. A 
fold difference for subjects with ESRD was not calculated due to the small number of subjects, but 
results indicate a similar or somewhat larger increase in ribociclib exposure compared to subjects with 
severe renal impairment. 
The effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib was also assessed in cancer patients 
included in efficacy and safety studies where patients were given the 600 mg start dose (see 
section 5.1). In a sub-group analysis of pharmacokinetic data from studies in cancer patients following 
oral administration of 600 mg ribociclib as a single dose or repeat doses, AUCinf and Cmax of ribociclib 
in patients with mild (n=57) or moderate (n=14) renal impairment were comparable to the AUCinf and 
Cmax in patients with normal renal function (n=86), suggesting no clinically meaningful effect of mild 
or moderate renal impairment on ribociclib exposure. 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on a pharmacokinetic study in non-cancer subjects with hepatic impairment, mild hepatic 
impairment had no effect on the exposure of ribociclib (see section 4.2). The mean exposure for 
ribociclib was increased less than 2-fold in patients with moderate (geometric mean ratio [GMR]: 1.44 
for Cmax; 1.28 for AUCinf) and severe (GMR: 1.32 for Cmax; 1.29 for AUCinf) hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2). 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 160 breast cancer patients with normal 
hepatic function and 47 patients with mild hepatic impairment, mild hepatic impairment had no effect 
on the exposure of ribociclib, further supporting the findings from the dedicated hepatic impairment 
study. Ribociclib has not been studied in breast cancer patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Effect of age, weight, gender and race 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, body 
weight or gender on the systemic exposure of ribociclib that would require a dose adjustment. Data on 
differences in pharmacokinetics due to race are too limited to draw conclusions. 
In vitro interaction data 
Effect of ribociclib on cytochrome P450 enzymes 
In vitro, ribociclib is a reversible inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 and a time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro evaluations indicated that 
ribociclib has no potential to inhibit the activities of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations. Ribociclib has no potential for 
time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. 
In vitro data indicate that ribociclib has no potential to induce UGT enzymes or the CYP enzymes 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 via PXR. Therefore, Kisqali is unlikely to affect substrates of these 
enzymes. In vitro data are not sufficient to exclude a potential of ribociclib to induce CYP2B6 via 
CAR. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of transporters on ribociclib 
Ribociclib is a substrate for P-gp in vitro, but based on mass balance data inhibition of P-gp or BCRP 
is unlikely to affect ribociclib exposure at therapeutic doses. Ribociclib is not a substrate for hepatic 
uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT-1 in vitro. 
Effect of ribociclib on transporters 
In vitro evaluations indicated that ribociclib has a potential to inhibit the activities of drug transporters 
P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and BSEP. Ribociclib did not inhibit OAT1, 
OAT3 or MRP2 at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Safety pharmacology 
In vivo cardiac safety studies in dogs demonstrated dose and concentration related QTc interval 
prolongation at an exposure that would be expected to be achieved in patients following the 
recommended dose of 600 mg. There is also potential to induce incidences of premature ventricular 
contractions (PVCs) at elevated exposures (approximately 5-fold the anticipated clinical Cmax). 
Repeated-dose toxicity 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies (treatment schedule of 3 weeks on/1 week off) of up to 27 weeks’ 
duration in rats and up to 39 weeks’ duration in dogs, revealed the hepatobiliary system (proliferative 
changes, cholestasis, sand-like gallbladder calculi, and inspissated bile) as the primary target organ of 
toxicity of ribociclib. Target organs associated with the pharmacological action of ribociclib in 
repeat-dose studies include bone marrow (hypocellularity), lymphoid system (lymphoid depletion), 
intestinal mucosa (atrophy), skin (atrophy), bone (decreased bone formation), kidney (concurrent 
degeneration and regeneration of tubular epithelial cells) and testes (atrophy). Besides the atrophic 
changes seen in the testes, which showed a trend towards reversibility, all other changes were fully 
reversible after a 4-week treatment-free period. Exposure to ribociclib in animals in the toxicity 
studies was generally less than or equal to that observed in patients receiving multiple doses of 
600 mg/day (based on AUC). 
Reproductive toxicity/Fertility 
Ribociclib showed foetotoxicity and teratogenicity at doses which did not show maternal toxicity in 
the rats or rabbits. Following prenatal exposure, increased incidences of post-implantation loss and 
reduced foetal weights were observed in rats and ribociclib was teratogenic in rabbits at exposures 
lower than or 1.5 times the exposure in humans, respectively, at the highest recommended dose of 
600 mg/day based on AUC. 
In rats, reduced foetal weights accompanied by skeletal changes considered to be transitory and/or 
related to the lower foetal weights were noted. In rabbits, there were adverse effects on embryo-foetal 
development as evidenced by increased incidences of foetal abnormalities (malformations and 
external, visceral and skeletal variants) and foetal growth (lower foetal weights). These findings 
included reduced/small lung lobes and additional vessel on the aortic arch and diaphragmatic hernia, 
absent accessory lobe or (partly) fused lung lobes and reduced/small accessory lung lobe (30 and 
60 mg/kg), extra/rudimentary thirteenth ribs and misshapen hyoid bone and reduced number of 
phalanges in the pollex. There was no evidence of embryo-foetal mortality. 
In a fertility study in female rats, ribociclib did not affect reproductive function, fertility or early 
embryonic development at any dose up to 300 mg/kg/day (which is likely at an exposure lower than or 
equal to patients’ clinical exposure at the highest recommended dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC). 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ribociclib has not been evaluated in male fertility studies. However, atrophic changes in testes were 
reported in rat and dog toxicity studies at exposures that were less than or equal to human exposure at 
the highest recommended daily dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC. These effects can be linked to a 
direct anti-proliferative effects on the testicular germ cells resulting in atrophy of the seminiferous 
tubules. 
Ribociclib and its metabolites passed readily into rat milk. The exposure to ribociclib was higher in 
milk than in plasma. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with 
and without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a genotoxic potential of ribociclib. 
Carcinogenesis 
Ribociclib was assessed for carcinogenicity in a 2-year study in rats. 
Oral administration of ribociclib for 2 years resulted in an increased incidence of endometrial 
epithelial tumours and glandular and squamous hyperplasia in the uterus/cervix of female rats at doses 
≥300 mg/kg/day as well as an increased incidence in follicular tumours in the thyroid glands of male 
rats at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. Mean exposure at steady state (AUC0-24h) in female and male rats in 
whom neoplastic changes were seen was 1.2- and 1.4-fold that achieved in patients at the 
recommended dose of 600 mg/day, respectively. Mean exposure at steady state (AUC0-24h) in female 
and male rats in whom neoplastic changes were seen was 2.2- and 2.5-fold that achieved in patients at 
a dose of 400 mg/day, respectively. 
Additional non-neoplastic proliferative changes consisted of increased liver altered foci (basophilic 
and clear cell) and testicular interstitial (Leydig) cell hyperplasia in male rats at doses of ≥5 mg/kg/day 
and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
The mechanism for the thyroid findings in male rats is likely to involve a rodent-specific microsomal 
enzyme induction in the liver which is considered to be of no relevance to humans. The effects on the 
uterus/cervix and on the testicular interstitial (Leydig) cells are related to prolonged 
hypoprolactinaemia secondary to CDK4 inhibition of lactotrophic cell function in the pituitary gland, 
altering the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. 
Any potential increase of oestrogen/progesterone ratio in humans by this mechanism would be 
compensated by an inhibitory action of concomitant anti-oestrogen therapy on oestrogen synthesis as 
in humans Kisqali is indicated in combination with oestrogen-lowering agents. 
Considering important differences between rodents and humans with regard to synthesis and role of 
prolactin, this mode of action is not expected to have consequences in humans.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kisqali is and what it is used for 
What Kisqali is 
Kisqali contains the active substance ribociclib, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. 
What Kisqali is used for 
Kisqali is used in women with a type of breast cancer called hormone receptor-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-negative breast cancer that is locally advanced or has spread 
to other parts of the body (metastatic). It is used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or 
fulvestrant, which are used as hormonal anticancer therapies. 
Women who have not reached menopause will also be treated with a medicine called a luteinising 
hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
How Kisqali works 
Kisqali works by blocking proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which are important for 
the growth and division of cells. Blocking these proteins can slow down the growth of cancer cells and 
delay the progression of your cancer. 
If you have any questions about how Kisqali works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Kisqali 
Follow all of your doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information in this 
leaflet. 
Do not take Kisqali 
- 
if you are allergic to ribociclib, peanut, soya or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
Warnings and precautions

blood cells). 
If you have any problems with your liver or have previously had any type of liver disease.

If necessary, your doctor may interrupt or reduce your dose of Kisqali or decide to stop

Monitoring during your treatment with Kisqali 
You will have regular blood tests before and during treatment with Kisqali to check your liver function 
and the amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) and electrolytes (blood 
salts including potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphate) in your body. Your heart activity will 
also be monitored before and during treatment with Kisqali with a test called an electrocardiogram 
(ECG). If necessary, additional tests to evaluate your kidney function will be performed during 
treatment with Kisqali. If necessary, your doctor may reduce your dose of Kisqali or temporarily stop 
it to allow your liver, kidney, blood cells, electrolyte levels or heart activity to recover. Your doctor 
may also decide to stop treatment with Kisqali permanently.

Make sure you tell your doctor of all medicines and supplements, including herbal medicines, that you 
are taking before you start treatment with Kisqali and if you are prescribed a new medicine after you

above. 
48 
 
 
 
Kisqali with food and drink 
You should not eat grapefruits or drink grapefruit juice during your treatment with Kisqali. It may 
change how Kisqali is processed in your body and may increase the amount of Kisqali in your 
bloodstream. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Your doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of taking Kisqali during pregnancy. 
Pregnancy and women of childbearing potential 
Kisqali should not be used during pregnancy since it may harm your unborn baby. If you are a woman 
of childbearing potential you should have a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment with 
Kisqali. You should use effective contraception (e.g. double-barrier contraception such as condom and 
diaphragm) while taking Kisqali and for at least 21 days after the last dose. Ask your doctor about 
options for effective contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed while taking Kisqali and for at least 21 days after the last dose. 
Driving and using machines 
Treatment with Kisqali may lead to tiredness, dizziness or spinning sensation. You should therefore be 
cautious when driving or using machines during your treatment with Kisqali.

3. 
How to take Kisqali 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. Your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse will tell you exactly how many tablets to take and which days to take them on. 
Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Do not change the Kisqali dose or 
schedule without talking to your doctor. 
Do not exceed the recommended dose prescribed by your doctor. 
How much Kisqali to take 
• 
The recommended starting dose of Kisqali is 600 mg (3 tablets of 200 mg) once daily. Your 
doctor will tell you exactly how many tablets of Kisqali to take; in certain situations (e.g. in case 
of liver or kidney problems) your doctor may instruct you to take a lower dose of Kisqali, e.g. 
400 mg (2 tablets of 200 mg) once daily or 200 mg (1 tablet of 200 mg) once daily. 
A treatment cycle lasts 28 days. Take Kisqali once a day only on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. 
The outer carton of the Kisqali pack includes a “calendar tool” which allows you to track your 
daily Kisqali dose by marking off a circle for every tablet you take over the 28-day cycle. 
You should not take Kisqali on days 22 to 28 of the cycle. 
• 
It is very important to follow your doctor’s instructions. If you get certain side effects your doctor may 
ask you to take a lower dose, interrupt your treatment with Kisqali, or stop it permanently. 
When to take Kisqali 
Take Kisqali once daily at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. This will help you to 
remember to take your medicine. 
How to take Kisqali 
Kisqali tablets should be swallowed whole (tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split before 
swallowing). Do not take a tablet that is broken, cracked or otherwise damaged. 
Kisqali with food and drink 
You should take Kisqali once daily every day at the same time, preferably in the morning. You may 
take it with or without food. 
How long to take Kisqali 
Take Kisqali once a day on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. Continue Kisqali treatment for as long as 
your doctor tells you to. 
This is a long-term treatment, possibly lasting for months or years. Your doctor will regularly monitor 
your condition to check that the treatment is having the desired effect. 
If you take more Kisqali than you should 
If you take too many tablets, or if someone else takes your medicine, contact a doctor or hospital for 
advice immediately. Show the Kisqali packet. Medical treatment may be necessary. 
If you miss a dose of Kisqali 
If you vomit after taking the dose or forget a dose, skip the missed dose that day. Take the next dose at 
your usual time. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Instead, wait until it is time for your next 
scheduled dose and then take your usual dose. 
If you stop taking Kisqali 
Stopping your treatment with Kisqali may cause your condition to get worse. Do not stop taking 
Kisqali unless your doctor tells you to. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

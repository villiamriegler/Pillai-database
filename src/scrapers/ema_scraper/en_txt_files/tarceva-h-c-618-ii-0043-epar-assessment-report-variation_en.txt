2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Erlotinib is an EGFR TKI that was developed for the treatment of NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, and other solid 
tumors. Erlotinib exerts its therapeutic activity through direct and reversible inhibition of the EGFR tyrosine 
kinase. Erlotinib was approved in the EU on 19 September 2005. Erlotinib is currently approved in the EU for 
the following indications: 
• 
First-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating 
mutations. 
•  Monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with 
stable disease after four cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. 
• 
• 
Treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior 
chemotherapy regimen. 
In combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. 
In order to provide support for first-line maintenance treatment with erlotinib in NSCLC patients whose 
tumors harbor EGFR activating mutations, results are provided from a pre-specified subpopulation analysis 
of Study BO18192 (SATURN), a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 study of 
single-agent erlotinib in patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who had not progressed following 4 cycles of 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients in this study were randomized to treatment with erlotinib (150 
mg/day) or placebo until disease progression, death or intolerable toxicity. This subpopulation analysis 
evaluated treatment response to erlotinib versus placebo in NSCLC patients with tumors harboring 
EGFR-activating mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations). The efficacy data in this 
subpopulation of 22 erlotinib-treated patients were previously submitted to the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) as part of the Responses to Questions for Type II Variation 
EMEA/H/C/618/II/017.  
At the time of approval of the first-line maintenance indication in the United States, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) requested a postmarketing commitment to conduct a randomized controlled study in 
patients with histologically documented, advanced, or recurrent (Stage IIIB and not amenable for combined 
modality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC who have not experienced disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity during chemotherapy with four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. The study 
BO25460 (IUNO) was to compare erlotinib as first-line maintenance therapy with erlotinib at progression 
(second-line treatment); all eligible patients were to have known EGFR by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
status and were to be without EGFR activating mutations. Patients with EGFR activating mutations were 
excluded as it was considered unethical to have such patients potentially being randomized to placebo in the 
first-line maintenance setting.  
The purpose of this Type II variation is to modify the approved indication associated with the first-line 
maintenance treatment of NSCLC.  The proposed changes to the indication were as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/816728/2015 
Page 5/36 
 
  
  
 
 
‘Tarceva is indicated for the first-line and maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR-activating mutations.’ 
‘Tarceva is also indicated as monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC with stable disease after 4 cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.’ 
Preliminary results from study BO25469 (IUNO) and the final CSR from study BO18192 (SATURN) are 
provided in order to support the above change in the indication. The SATURN study has previously been 
assessed by the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/298837/2010) and was the basis for the use of erlotinib in the 
maintenance setting. Furthermore, three published scientific paper1 ,2 ,3 are also provided as supporting 
literature.  
The final indication was as follows: 
Tarceva is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR activating mutations. 
Tarceva is indicated for switch maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
with EGFR activating mutations and stable disease after first-line chemotherapy. Tarceva is also indicated as 
monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with stable 
disease after 4 cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.

2.4.1.  Main studies 
IUNO study: A multicenter, multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled,2-arm Phase III 
study designed to evaluate the relative survival benefit and safety of ‘early’ (first-line 
maintenance) erlotinib versus ‘late’ (second-line) erlotinib in patients with advanced (stage 
IIIB and not amenable for combined modality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC whose 
tumours did not harbour an EGFR-activating mutation and who had not progressed following 4 
cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy.

Study participants and treatments 
Patients were initially screened into a chemotherapy run-in period in which they had to complete 4 cycles of 
an approved (non-investigational) platinum-based doublet chemotherapy without subsequent disease 
progression (i.e., had documented complete response/partial response or stable disease according to 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] v1.1 criteria) for eligibility. 
- Blinded phase: patients whose tumours were confirmed to lack an EGFR activating mutation (exon 19 
deletion or exon 2 L858R mutation) or had an indeterminate EGFR mutation status following central testing 
were randomized to receive 150 mg/day erlotinib (‘early erlotinib’ group) or placebo (‘late erlotinib’ group) 
in the maintenance setting until the occurrence of disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1 criteria or 
because of symptomatic deterioration attributed to suspected tumor progression), death, or unacceptable 
toxicity. 
- Open-label phase: following randomization, patients who had disease progression in the blinded phase 
were unblinded and entered the open-label phase of the study. Patients randomized to the ‘early erlotinib’ 
group received approved second-line (excluding EGFR-targeted) therapies, whereas patients in the ‘late 
erlotinib’ group received 150 mg/day erlotinib. Patients were monitored until the occurrence of disease

progression (assessed according to radiological or symptomatic deterioration criteria per local practice), 
death, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients unable to receive second-line open-label treatment received best 
supportive care (BSC) until such time they could receive it, or alternatively proceeded directly to Survival 
Follow-up.  
Patients who had documented disease progression at the end of second-line treatment in the open-label 
phase, or who were not amenable to second-line openlabel treatment at the end of the blinded phase, 
entered survival follow-up in which they could receive further lines of cancer therapy or BSC at the discretion 
of the investigator. Survival status was monitored. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was: 
- To compare the overall survival (OS) of first-line maintenance therapy with erlotinib (‘early erlotinib’) 
versus erlotinib administered at the time of disease progression (‘late erlotinib’). 
Secondary objectives of the study were: 
- To compare progression-free survival (PFS) between the ‘early erlotinib’ (erlotinib) and ‘late erlotinib’ 
(placebo) groups during the blinded (first-line maintenance) phase. 
- To compare overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) between treatment groups during 
the blinded (maintenance) phase 
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of erlotinib in this patient population 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameter of overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to 
the date of death, regardless of the cause of death.  
Disease progression in the blinded phase was defined according to RECIST version v1.1. Duration of PFS was 
assessed during the blinded phase of the study, defined as the time from randomization to disease 
progression or death, whichever occurred first. 
Blinding (masking) 
The first phase of the study was double-blinded and the second phase of the study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint of OS was assessed using a 2-sided unstratified log-rank test at a 5% significance 
level. Median survival time and 95% confidence limits were estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
methodology. One-year survival rates from randomization were compared using estimates from the KM 
survival curves. Estimates of treatment effect were expressed as hazard ratios (HR) (‘early erlotinib’ group 
versus ‘late erlotinib’ group) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
The analysis was planned to be performed when 460 death events had been recorded, and has now been 
conducted. As per protocol, the study ends when the final analysis for the primary endpoint has been 
performed. The final results became available on 30 July 2015 and the final analysis for the primary endpoint 
has been performed. Therefore, the study will now be closed.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 643 patients were enrolled and randomized between September 2011 and June 2014. The date of 
data cut-off for the primary analysis was 23 March 2015, at which time there were 477 death events 
recorded (74% of randomized patients). The date of the snapshot for the analysis of this ongoing study was 
10 July 2015. Of the 643 patients, 322 patients were randomized to receive 150 mg/day erlotinib [‘early 
erlotinib’ group] and 321 patients were randomized to receive placebo (‘late erlotinib’ group). Of the 322 
patients randomized to the ‘early erlotinib’ group, 160 (50%) received second line treatment; of the 321 
patients randomized to the ‘late erlotinib’ group, 250 patients (78%) received second line treatment, until 
the occurrence of further disease progression death, or unacceptable toxicities. 
Recruitment 
Patients were recruited at 122 centres in 20 countries globally. 
Baseline data 
A summary of patient demographics and baseline characteristics are presented in Table 2 and Table 3.

Table 2: Summary of NSCLC history (ITT population) - Study BO25460 (IUNO) 
Numbers analysed 
All 321 patients randomized in the ‘late erlotinib’ group and all 322 patients randomized in the ‘early 
erlotinib’ group were included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population. Two patients did not receive study 
treatment post-randomization and were therefore excluded from the safety analysis in the blinded phase. 
In total, 71 patients (22%) from the ‘late erlotinib’ group and 162 patients (50%) from the ‘early erlotinib’ 
group were excluded from the safety analysis population in the second-line open-label phase due to not 
having received at least one dose of open-label phase study treatment. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint – OS 
The results of the primary endpoint of this study showed that OS in patients who received ‘early erlotinib’ in 
the first-line maintenance setting was not superior to ‘late erlotinib’ treatment (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.85, 
1.22; log rank p-value = 0.8183). Median OS was similar and 1-year event-free rates were the same in both 
treatment groups.

Secondary endpoint - PFS 
PFS assessed during the blinded phase showed no difference between erlotinib and placebo treatment. At 
the time of the data cut-off, 305 patients (95.0%) on placebo and 303 patients (94.1%) on erlotinib in the 
blinded phase, had progressed or died. The majority of these events were progressions (281, placebo and 
264, erlotinib). The estimated median PFS was similar for both treatment groups: 12 weeks (95% CI: 11.71, 
12.29 weeks [placebo]) versus 13 weeks (95% CI: 12.14, 17.43 weeks [erlotinib]). The HR was 0.94 (95% 
CI: 0.80, 1.11), showing no clinical meaningful PFS benefit for the erlotinib group (p = 0.48, two-sided 
unstratified logrank test). The 6-month estimate of PFS rate was 24% (95% CI: 19.50%, 28.94%) in the 
placebo group compared with 27% (95% CI: 22.19%, 32.02%) in the erlotinib group.

STUDY  BO18192  (SATURN):  A  multi-centre,  double-blind  randomized,  Phase  III  study  to 
evaluate the efficacy of Tarceva or placebo following 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy 
in  patients  with  histologically  documented,  advanced  or  recurrent  (Stage  IIIB  and  not 
amenable for combined modality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC)  who  have  not  experienced  disease  progression  or  unacceptable  toxicity  during 
chemotherapy. 
Study BO18192 (SATURN) was a randomized, multi-center, Phase III study in patients with histologically 
documented, locally advanced, or recurrent (Stage IIIB and not amenable for combined modality treatment) 
or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC before chemotherapy. The results of this study led to the EMA approval 
(EMEA/H/C/618/II/017; positive opinion received on 18 March 2010) of erlotinib as monotherapy in the 
maintenance setting in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with stable disease after four 
cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.

After eligibility screening, patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC completed four cycles of an acceptable 
platinum-based chemotherapy combination. Following chemotherapy, patients who met the following 
criteria were considered eligible for erlotinib treatment: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance 
Status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 1, a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, adequate hematological, renal, and 
hepatic function, and absence of unacceptable toxicity and/or disease progression (CR, PR, or SD). 
Eligible patients were randomised to receive either erlotinib 150 mg/day or placebo until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. Randomisation was stratified by EGFR protein expression by 
IHC, stage of disease at start of chemotherapy, ECOG PS, chemotherapy regimen, smoking status, and 
region. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were investigator-assessed PFS according to RECIST in all patients and in 
the EGFR IHC positive population. An independent combined radiological and clinical assessment was 
undertaken to provide an independent assessment of response and disease progression. Secondary efficacy 
endpoints included OS and response rates (ORR and DCR) according to RECIST v1.0. 
For the purpose of this Type II variation application, the focus is on the prospectively defined subgroup of 
patients with EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation). All analyses in this 
EGFR mutation positive subgroup were prospectively defined, but exploratory in nature. Median survival 
times and 95% confidence limits for PFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology, and the 
corresponding treatment difference tested using a log-rank test. The between-treatment difference in 
response rates (ORR and DCR) was tested using a χ2 test. 
Progression-Free Survival 
Based on the clinical cut-off for the Clinical Study Report (CSR) (17 May 2008) first-line maintenance 
erlotinib treatment after 4 cycles of chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC, the overall population showed a 
benefit for the primary PFS end-point (HR= 0.71 p< 0.0001). However the largest benefit was observed in 
a predefined exploratory analysis in patients with EGFR activating mutations (n= 49) demonstrating a 
substantial PFS benefit (HR=0.10, 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.25; p<0.0001). Median PFS was 44.6 weeks (95% CI: 
35.1 weeks, not reached) in the erlotinib group compared with 13.0 weeks (95% CI: 11.6, 18.4 weeks) in 
the placebo group. A Kaplan-Meier curve of the PFS results for patients with both EGFR mutated and 
wild-type tumours is shown in the below figure. The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS for the subpopulation of 
patients with EGFR mutations were separated between the erlotinib and placebo groups over the course of 
the observation period.

Overall Survival 
At the time of data cut-off (17 May 2009), there was a benefit in OS (HR= 0.81 p=0.0088) in the overall 
population. 8 of 22 patients (36.4%) with tumors harboring EGFR-activating mutations in the erlotinib group 
had died, therefore the OS data reported at this time were immature. In addition, 67% of placebo patients

in the EGFR mutation positive subgroup received second or further line treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs), which may have affected the observed hazard ratio for OS. Nonetheless, the HR for OS in 
patients with activating EGFR mutations was below 1.00 (HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.34, 2.02).

In an updated analysis of OS (data cut-off 12 Jan 2012), no difference was observed in the risk of death 
between the two treatment groups in the subgroup of patients with tumours harboring an EGFR-activating 
mutation. The HR for OS was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.52; 1.97), the p-value (log-rank test) was 0.9739 and the 
median OS was 23.8 and 23.6 months in the placebo and erlotinib groups, respectively.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
In the Liu et al. 2015 meta-analysis of more than 1592 patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR activating 
mutations from 27 randomized controlled studies with first generation EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib), 
pooled estimates of treatment efficacy were calculated based on published HRs or estimated from other 
survival data. 
The analysis of PFS in patients receiving EGFR-TKIs or placebo as maintenance therapy included data from 
three clinical studies (including the BO18192 [SATURN] subgroup). Results in patients with EGFR activating 
mutations were consistent with the findings from SATURN, revealing a significant PFS benefit for first-line 
maintenance treatment with erlotinib versus placebo (HR [95% CI]: 0.14 [0.08, 0.26], p= 0.00001). 
Patients without an EGFR activating mutation had an HR (95% CI) of 0.81 (0.68, 0.97), p= 0.02. Other 
findings of this meta-analysis included the following: 
• 
In patients with EGFR activating mutations, treatment with an EGFR-TKI showed a PFS benefit over 
treatment with chemotherapy in the first-line setting (HR [95% CI]: 0.41 [0.31, 0.55], p=0.00001) 
and in the second/third-line setting (HR [95% CI]: 0.46 [0.24, 0.89], p=0.02). For patients without 
a mutation, PFS was reduced with an EGFR-TKI compared with chemotherapy in the first-line (HR 
[95% CI]: 1.65 [1.06, 2.58], p=0.03) and second/third-line setting (HR [95% CI]: 1.27 [1.08, 
1.51], p=0.005). 
•  A significant difference (p=0.04) in PFS improvement between patients with and without a mutation 
could also be seen for treatment with an EGFR-TKI versus placebo (four clinical studies) (HR [95% 
CI]: 0.26 [0.09, 0.79], p=0.02 for patients with a mutation and 0.83 [0.72, 0.95], p=0.006 for 
patients without a mutation), suggesting a greater PFS benefit of EGFR-TKIs as first-line and 
second/third-line treatment in patients with EGFR activating mutations compared with patients 
without a mutation. 
• 
Patients treated with EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy (five clinical studies) had a more pronounced 
PFS benefit compared with chemotherapy alone (HR [95% CI]: 0.49 [0.32, 0.77], p=0.002 for 
patients with a mutation and 0.83 [0.71, 0.96], p=0.01 for patients without a mutation). The 
heterogeneity between the two subpopulations was significant (p =0.03). 
Overall, the authors suggest that a treatment benefit with EGFR-TKIs could be shown for patients with EGFR 
activating mutations irrespective of the treatment setting. 
The meta-analysis by Liu et al. included, amongst others, three studies in the maintenance setting, where an 
EGFR-TKI is compared with placebo:  
1)  IFCT-GFPC with 8 patients with EGFR activating mutation (Erlotinib vs. Placebo) 
2)  INFORM with 30 patients with EGFR activating mutation (Gefitinib vs. placebo) 
3)  SATURN with 49 patients with EGFR activating mutation

Figure 8: Summary of the meta-analysis of first-line therapy and maintenance therapy with EGFR-TKIs 
The authors pooled the three above studies and could show a statistically significant HR, but the results 
seem to be mainly driven by the SATURN study. Nonetheless, altogether data from the three studies provide 
evidence for the effect of EGFR-TKI’s in the maintenance setting.    
Pooled Analysis of Published Clinical Study Data4  
The Paz-Ares et al. 2014 pooled analysis of prospective or retrospective studies evaluated treatment with 
single agent EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib or gefitinib) or chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC with EGFR activating 
mutations. The pooled median PFS was evaluated in 26 studies (731 patients) with erlotinib, 54 studies 
(1802 patients) with gefitinib, and 20 studies (984 patients) with chemotherapy. The results of the analysis 
indicated that the PFS (bootstrap estimated 95% confidence limit) was longer in patients when treated with 
erlotinib (12.4 months [10.9, 13.4 months]), or gefitinib (9.4 months [8.7, 10.2 months]) compared with 
conventional chemotherapy (5.6 months [5.1, 6.2 months]). Permutation testing with 20,000 random 
permutations indicated that the increase in PFS was statistically significant for erlotinib or gefitinib compared 
with chemotherapy in the first-line, in lines other than first-line (p=0.0022 and p=0.0039, respectively), and 
in all lines of therapy. Pooled median PFS values for erlotinib were not statistically different between lines of 
therapy (12.0 vs. 12.9 months for first-line vs. other lines, p=0.678). Overall, the Applicant claim that a 
clear PFS benefit was reported with an EGFR-TKI compared with chemotherapy for NSCLC patients with 
EGFR activating mutations in all lines of treatment. 
Supportive study 
The Atlas study: randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase IIIB Study 
The ATLAS study1 explored the potential benefit of adding maintenance erlotinib to bevacizumab after a 
first-line chemotherapy regimen with bevacizumab in 743 patients with advanced NSCLC, including 52 
patients with EGFR activating mutations (27 with bevacizumab/erlotinib and 25 with bevacizumab/placebo). 
Patients were eligible if they showed stable disease or no significant toxicity after four lines of chemotherapy. 
In the mutation-positive population, biomarker analyses showed a greater improvement in PFS with 
bevacizumab/erlotinib versus bevacizumab/placebo (HR [95% CI] 0.44 [0.22, 0.86]) compared with 
patients without an EGFR activating mutation (n=295; 150 bevacizumab/erlotinib and 145 
bevacizumab/placebo) (HR [95% CI]: 0.85 [0.64, 1.13]). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/816728/2015 
Page 21/36 
 
  
  
 
 
More than 50% of patients in each group had subsequent second-line therapy. Despite this, OS results 
showed a similar difference in outcome between the combination with erlotinib and with placebo by EGFR 
mutation status: HR (95% CI): 0.46 (0.21, 1.02) for patients with EGFR activating mutations and 0.86 
(0.65, 1.15) for patients without an EGFR activating mutation. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The IUNO study was designed at the request of regulatory authorities to investigate “early erlotinib” vs. “late 
erlotinib”. Patients without PD after 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomised to erlotinib 
150mg/day or placebo until PD, death or unacceptable toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
efficacy of erlotinib in maintenance therapy in patients with NSCLC and no known EGFR activating mutation. 
321 patients were randomised to receive placebo and 322 were randomised to receive erlotinib.  The 
primary endpoint was OS and secondary endpoints were PFS, ORR, DCR (disease control rate), and safety. 
The IUNO study had a blinded phase, which was the time from randomisation to PD. After PD the study was 
un-blinded. Patients in the placebo arm would then switch to erlotinib and patients in the erlotinib arm would 
switch to second-line chemotherapy or BSC.  The primary endpoint was assessed using a 2-sided stratified 
log-rank test at 5% significance level. 
The baseline characteristics are well-balanced between the two groups. The majority of the patients were 
male, white, ECOG PS 1, had adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and stage IV disease.  
The SATURN study had been previously assessed by the CHMP (Doc. Ref No. EMA/CHMP/298837/2010) and 
was the basis for the maintenance indication. Therefore, a re-assessment of this study was not performed in 
this variation. However, a discussion of the updated data from the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating 
mutation was assessed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint in the IUNO study shows no difference between the two groups (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 
0.85, 1.22; p-value = 0.8183). Thus, there seems to be no benefit of early erlotinib treatment in patients 
with NSCLC with no known EGFR activating mutation. The subgroup analysis shows the HR in the different 
subgroups is not different from the overall estimate. Some subgroups (North America and Eastern Europe) 
have HR that are very different from the overall estimate, however, the 95%CIs are very wide reflecting the 
small number of patients in these subgroups. The results of the PFS analysis are consistent with the OS data.  
Thus, the indication of “maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with 
stable disease after 4 cycles of standard platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.” is no longer justified.  
However, following the SAG recommendations in 2010 the CHMP assessed the subgroup of patients with 
EGFR activating mutations. In this subgroup, the effect in terms of PFS associated with erlotinib 
administration (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12, 0.45, p<0.0001, median PFS 13.0 weeks with placebo versus 46.1 
weeks with erlotinib) was very large. An updated analysis of PFS in this subgroup confirms the previous 
findings. The use of erlotinib as maintenance after first line treatment shows no detrimental effect on OS in 
the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutations. The KM curves are overlapping. This is somewhat 
expected, since any effect of erlotinib on OS is bound to be diluted by cross-over and later lines of therapy. 
To further support the use of erlotinib in the maintenance setting in patients with EGFR activating mutations, 
the Applicant has provided analyses of three published studies. The ATLAS study investigated the efficacy of 
bevacizumab+erlotinib vs. bevacizumab+placebo in the maintenance setting in patients with stable disease 
after first line treatment. Known EGFR mutation status was not required for inclusion and was not a 
stratification factor. In total 373 patients were randomised to bevacizumab +placebo and 370 patients were 
randomized to bevacizumab +erl. A biomarker analysis identified 52 patients in total (27 patients in the 
bevacizumab +erl and 25 patiens in the bevacizumab +placebo) with EGFR activating mutations. The PFS 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/816728/2015 
Page 22/36 
 
  
  
 
was statistically significant in favour of patients with EGFR activating mutation being treated with 
bevacizumab +erl compared to those with EGFR activating mutation being treated with 
bevacizumab+placebo (HR = 0.44). This is reassuring and provides further supportive evidence for the 
findings in the SATURN study in this subpopulation. The results showed no detrimental effect on OS.   
The meta-analysis by Lui et al. included, amongst others, three studies in the maintenance setting, where 
EGFR-TKIs were compared with placebo. The authors pooled the three studies and could show a statistically 
significant HR, but the results seem to be mainly driven by the SATURN study. Nonetheless, the data from 
the three studies provide further evidence for the effect of EGFR-TKI’s in the switch maintenance setting for 
patients with EGFR-activating mutations.   
The last supportive study, the Paz-Ares study, analysed both prospective and retrospective studies. The 
study provided evidence for the efficacy of EGFR-TKI’s in first-line and other lines of therapy, however, did 
not provide any direct evidence for the use of erlotinib in maintenance setting. 
In light of the results from the IUNO study and other available information on erlotinib, the MAH is 
recommended to discuss the use of erlotinib for the treatment of patients without EGFR activating mutation 
status with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutation has previously been 
demonstrated in clinical trials (e.g. EURTAC, EMA/657134/2011). However, the indication of “switch 
maintenance use of erlotinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with stable disease after 
4 cycles of standard platinum based first line chemotherapy” is no longer justified based on the findings in 
the IUNO study. The study failed to meet its primary endpoint, OS. However, the efficacy of erlotinib in the 
maintenance setting in the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutation has previously been shown 
in exploratory analysis in the SATURN study. Updated analysis of the SATURN trial support these previous 
findings. Recent scientific publications provide further evidence on the efficacy of erlotinib in the 
maintenance setting in patients with EGFR activating mutation. In line with the findings in the SATURN 
study, large improvements in PFS in the maintenance setting in patients with EGFR activating mutation were 
observed in the ATLAS study. Based on the SATURN study, switch maintenance treatment was considered 
justified in patients with stable disease after first-line treatment.  
Overall, taking the totality of data and the biological rationale for the use of erlotinib in EGFR mutated 
patients into consideration, the use of erlotinib in the switch maintenance setting in patients with NSCLC with 
EGFR activating mutation with stable disease after first-line chemotherapy treatment is considered justified. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The SATURN study has previously been evaluated by the CHMP. However, the safety in the subgroup of 
patients with EGFR activating mutation will be subject to an assessment. 
The safety data from the IUNO study will also be described in this section. 
Adverse events 
STUDY BO18192 (SATURN)Overall, the safety profile of erlotinib in patients with NSCLC whose tumors 
harbored  EGFR-activating  mutations  was  consistent  with  previously  observed  data.  An  overview  of  key 
safety  data  reported  in  the  EGFR  mutant  subpopulation  of  the  BO18192  (SATURN)  study  based  on  the

At the time of the clinical cut-off for the updated overall survival (OS) analysis, 8 patients in the erlotinib 
treatment group and 12 patients in the placebo group in the subpopulation of patients with EGFR activating 
mutations had died during the treatment period. All 21 patients had died due to disease progression (data 
available on request).

Deaths 
For the IUNO study, there were 36 deaths during the blinded phase, 25 in the erlotinib group and 11 in the 
placebo group; in total 22 deaths were due to progressive disease (PD) and 14 deaths were due to adverse 
events. More patients on erlotinib died due to PD in the blinded phase compared to on placebo (14/322 
[4.3%] vs. 8/319 [2.5%]) and the majority of these deaths on erlotinib occurred within 12 weeks from 
randomization (2.5% [8/14] vs. 0.9% [3/8] on placebo), although one of the protocol inclusion criteria 
mandated that the patient’s life expectancy should have been at least 12 weeks from randomization to be 
included in the study. A similar proportion of patients died due to PD in the remainder of the blinded phase 
(1.9% [6/322] of patients on erlotinib vs. 1.6% [5/319] of patients on placebo).

There were more deaths due to AEs (defined as events that may not be attributed exclusively due to the 
progression of underlying malignancy) in the erlotinib group (11 patients [3.4%]) compared with the 
placebo group (3 patients [0.9%). The majority of these deaths were similarly within the first 12 weeks 
postrandomisation (6/11 on erlotinib vs. 2/3 on placebo). None of the fatal events were considered causally 
related to blinded phase study drug by the investigators; rather, the majority was considered related to 
NSCLC and/or concurrent disease/concomitant medications (3 events) and ‘other’ undefined causes (4 
events).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of patients with EGFR activating mutation is consistent with the findings for the entire 
population in the SATURN study. Although the number of patients is low, no concerns have been raised.  The 
most common AEs are skin disorders (rash) and diarrhoea. These are well-known AEs related to the use of 
erlotinib and are clinically manageable. There are no major differences with regard to the number of deaths. 
Only one SAE (left ventricular dysfunction) occurred in the erlotinib arm and none in the placebo arm. The 
event resolved with following treatment. 
With regard to the IUNO, key safety data from the blinded phase of the study have been assessed. The most 
common AEs in the erlotinib arm are rash, diarrhoea, dyspnea and cough. The above pattern in AEs is in line 
with the known safety profile of erlotinib in patients with NSCLC. The number of deaths during the firsts 12 
weeks was higher in the erlotinib arm due to an imbalance with regard to patients with a short life 
expectancy. In the remainder of the blinded phase, the number of deaths was comparable. During the 
blinded phase more deaths due to AEs are observed in the erlotinib arm. Six out of 11 deaths in the erlotinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/816728/2015 
Page 30/36 
 
  
  
 
 
arm occurred during the first 12 weeks and may thus have been related to the imbalance in patients with a 
short life expectancy. Most of the AEs seem to be related to the underlying disease. However, severe 
infections, such as pneumonia with or without neutropenia, has been observed in other clinical trials. 
Furthermore, cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have previously been reported in patients being treated 
with erlotinib, however, several confounding factors exist such as prior radiotherapy, prior chemotherapy, 
pulmonary infections, and metastatic lung disease. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of erlotinib in the subgroup of patients with EGRF activating mutation in the SATURN study is as 
expected. There are no new safety findings. There were no new safety findings in the IUNO study. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.5.4.  Direct Healthcare Professional Communication 
A Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) is considered necessary in order to communicate 
on the revised indication and the results that have led to the conclusion that erlotinib is no longer indicated 
for maintenance treatment in patients without an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating 
mutation. 
The DHPC is provided in Attachment 3 together with the communication plan. 
The MAH should agree the translations and local specificities of the DHPC with national competent 
authorities. The DHPC should be sent by 14 January 2016 to healthcare providers. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH did not provide an updated RMP. A justification for non-inclusion of the updated Risk Management 
Plan was provided. Since there has been insufficient time to finalise the RMP update between release of the 
IUNO data and submission of this application, and in view of the urgency to amend the Product Information, 
the MAH commits to update and submit the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as soon as possible via a separate 
variation application. This has been considered an acceptable approach by the CHMP.  
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
changes to the PL were considered not affecting readability.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  benefits  of  erlotinib  in  terms  of  long-term  outcome  in  patients  with  NSCLC  with  EGFR  activating 
mutation have been demonstrated in several clinical trials. A subgroups analysis in the SATURN study has 
shown a remarkable gain in median PFS in this patient population in the switch maintenance setting after 
first-line therapy. The updated results of the study were consistent with the earlier results and confirm the 
clinically relevant effect of erlotinib in patients with activating EGRF mutations. The findings in the SATURN 
study  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  EGFR  activating  mutation  are  supported  by  the  ATLAS  study,  a 
meta-analysis by Lui et al (2015) and by a pooled analysis by Paz-Ares et al. (2014). No effect on OS and PFS 
was shown in the IUNO study in patient which did not harbour EGFR activating mutations. Overall, these 
data supporting the change in the indication to restrict to patients with locally advance NSCLC with EGFR 
activating mutations and stable disease after first line treatment. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The data to support the indication is mainly based on one study, the SATURN study, where EGFR activating 
mutations were pre-specified and were used as a stratification factor. The meta-analysis by Lui et al. 
included three studies in the maintenance setting, where EGFR-TKIs were compared with placebo. The 
pooled analysis showed a statistically significant HR, but the results seems to be mainly driven by the 
SATURN study. In addition, the supportive study, the Paz-Ares study, while providing evidence for the 
efficacy of EGFR-TKI’s in first-line and other lines of therapy, did not provide any direct evidence for the use 
of erlotinib in maintenance setting. Given these caveats, the data from the SATURN study and the supportive 
evidence in the literature are considered robust enough to support the change in indication.  
It was noted that at the time of the submission of this application, the final CSR for IUNO had not yet been 
finalised. Therefore the MAH has agreed to submit the final CSR for the IUNO study post approval, and also 
committed to submit a variation in order to update the RMP at the earliest convenience.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  patients  with  EGFR  activating  mutation  is  in  line  with  the  findings  for  the  entire 
population in the SATURN study. Although the number of patients is low, no concerns have been raised and 
no differences were observed. The most common AEs were skin disorders (rash) and diarrhea. These are 
well-known AEs related to the use of erlotinib and are clinically manageable. There are no major differences 
with regard to the number of deaths. Only one SAE (left ventricular dysfunction) occurred in the erlotinib 
arm and none in the placebo arm. The event resolved with following treatment. 
With  regard  to  the  IUNO,  the  most  common  AEs  in  the  erlotinib  arm  were  rash,  diarrhea,  dyspnea  and 
cough. The above pattern in AEs are in line with the known safety profile of erlotinib in patients with NSCLC.  
Assessment report

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No new safety signals have been detected and the adverse event profile is well-known for erlotinib as for 
other EGFR-TKI’s. The safety of erlotinib should be viewed in the context of that this patient population in 
general have a very poor prognosis.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The remarkable gain in median PFS in the subgroup of patients with EGFR activating mutation in the SATURN 
study  is  clinically  relevant,  considering  the  poor  prognosis  that  these  patients  are  otherwise  faced  with. 
There is a clear biological and molecular rational for the treatment effect. The safety profile of erlotinib is 
well-known and well-characterised. The majority of AEs related to erlotinib are clinically manageable and 
pose no major concerns.   
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of erlotinib in the indication “Tarceva is indicated for switch maintenance treatment 
in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations and stable disease 
after  first-line  chemotherapy.  “  is  considered  positive  in  patients  with  EGFR  activating  mutations  being 
treated in the switch  maintenance setting.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The remarkable effect seen in median PFS is not translated to an OS gain in the SATURN study. The use of 
erlotinib as maintenance after first line treatment shows no detrimental effect on OS in the subgroup of 
patients with EGFR activating mutations. The KM curves are overlapping. This is somewhat expected, as any 
effect of erlotinib on OS is bound to be diluted by cross-over and later lines of therapy. 
Based on the SATURN study, switch maintenance treatment was deemed justified in patients with stable 
disease after first-line treatment. Recent scientific publications (eg the ATLAS study, meta analyses on the 
effect of EGFR-TKIs) provided further support for the findings in the SATURN study in this subpopulation.  
In conclusion, in the context of the totality of the efficacy and safety data presented, the benefits  associated 
with clinically relevant effects in terms of PFS and OS outweigh the risks with regard to the use of erlotinib 
in the switch maintenance setting in patients with stable disease after first-line treatment with EGFR

activating mutations.  In light of the results from the IUNO study and other available information on 
erlotinib, the MAH is recommended to discuss the use of erlotinib for the treatment of patients without EGFR 
activating mutation status with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior 
chemotherapy regimen. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Modification of the indication to limit maintenance treatment to NSCLC patients with an EGFR-activating 
mutation and stable disease after first-line chemotherapy based on the data from study BO25460 (IUNO). 
Consequently, SmPC sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 have been updated. The Package leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended condition:  
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
• 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
An updated RMP shall be submitted by March 2016. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Scope 
Modification of the indication to limit maintenance treatment to NSCLC patients with an EGFR-activating 
mutation and stable disease after first-line chemotherapy based on the data from study BO25460 (IUNO). 
Consequently, SmPC sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 have been updated. The Package leaflet is updated 
accordingly.

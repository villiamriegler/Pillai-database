2.1. Introduction 
Study  DTPa-HBV-IPV-118  PRI  assesses  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  GSK  combined  DTPa-HBV-
IPV/HiB vaccine (InfanrixTM hexa)  administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 4 and 
6  months  of  age  in  healthy  infants  in  Canada.  Rotarix  was  not  specifically  studied  and  no 
immunogenicity results for Rotarix were generated in this study.  
According to the Rotarix Product Information, Rotarix can be administered at the same time as other 
recommended vaccines, such as Hib, diphtheria, tetanus, pertusis, oral or inactivated polio, hepatitis B 
vaccines  as  well  as  pneumococcal  and  meningoccal  serogroup  C  conjugate  vaccines.  The  MAH  has 
reviewed  the  results  of this  study  and  has  concluded  that  no  changes  to the Product  Information  are 
needed.  
2.2. Study design 
Study Objectives: The primary objective was to assess the immune response to the Hib component of 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in terms of seroprotection rates one month after a three-dose primary vaccination 
course in “Aboriginal Infants” and “Non Aboriginals Infants”. 
The  secondary  objective  were  (i)  to  assess  the  response  to  Hib  component  of  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  in 
terms  of  anti-polyribosyl-ribitol  phosphate  (PRP)  GMCs  one  month  after  the  three-dose  primary 
vaccination, (ii) to assess the immune response to the hepatitis B components of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in 
terms of seroprotection rates and anti-HBs GMCs one month after the three-dose primary vaccination 
course, and (iii) assess safety of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in terms of medically attended adverse events and 
serious adverse events during the three-dose primary vaccination course. 
Study Design: Phase IV, non-randomised, open-label study conducted in 3 centres in Canada.  
Page 3/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were two parallel groups, (i) “Aboriginal 
Infants” which included infants of the Canadian First 
Nation, Metis and Inuit people and (ii) “Non-
Aboriginal Infants” which included infants exclusive of 
Aboriginals.  
This was a self-contained study. The Non-Aboriginal infants”group served as control for evaluating the 
response to the vaccine in the Aboriginal infants”group. Blood sample was collected from all subjects 
one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination. 
All  subjects  were  to  receive  three  doses  of  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  at  2,  4,  and  6  months  of  age  and  two 
doses of Rotarix (lyophilised or liquid formulation) at 2 and 4 months of age, as well as  pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine according to the recommended provincial infant immunisation schedules.  
Study Population: Healthy infants between and including 6 and 12 weeks of age at the time of the first 
vaccination  and  born  after  a  gestation  period  of  minimum  36  weeks.  Subjects  with  evidence  of 
previous or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B and/or Hib vaccination 
or disease were excluded from the study.  
Study period: From September 2008 to November 2013 (date of database freeze)  
Study endpoints:  
Primary Outcome/Efficacy Variable: 
• 
Immunogenicity one month after the third dose of primary vaccination course: 
−  Anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/ml. 
Secondary Outcome/Efficacy Variable(s): 
• 
Immunogenicity one month after the third dose of primary vaccination course: 
−  Anti-PRP antibody concentration ≥ 1 µg/ml. 
−  Anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/ml and ≥ 100 mIU/ml 
−  Anti-PRP and anti-HBs antibody concentrations. 
Secondary Outcome/Safety Variable(s): 
•  Occurrence of medically attended adverse events and serious adverse events. An adverse 
event requiring medical attention is defined as: 
−  a visit to or from medical personnel (doctor of medicine or nurse practitioner) for any 
reason (excluding scheduled study visits); 
−  an emergency room visit; or 
−  any serious adverse event including hospitalisation and death. 
Statistical methods: 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  immunogenicity  and  safety.  An 
analysis on the Total Vaccinated cohort was to be performed to complement the ATP analysis only if 
Page 4/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more than 5% of the subjects with available immunogenicity data were excluded from the ATP cohort 
for analysis of immunogenicity.  
Safety 
• 
• 
The verbatim reports of medically attended AEs were reviewed by a physician and the signs and 
symptoms were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Every 
verbatim term was matched with the appropriate Preferred Term. The percentage of subjects with 
AEs that required medical attention occurring within 31 days (Day 0 to Day 30) with its exact 95% 
CI was tabulated by preferred term for each study group. 
The percentage of subjects who started to receive at least one concomitant medication (i.e. any 
medication, antipyretic medication, prophylactic antipyretics) during the 31-day follow-up period 
after vaccination was tabulated with exact 95% CI. 
•  Concomitant vaccinations received during the course of the study were tabulated. 
•  Serious adverse events and withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs following vaccination were described 
in detail.

Assessor’s comment: The number of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU per ml is not round and the 
table should be corrected for those values.  
Safety /reactogenicity: 
•  At  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  that  required  medical  attention  during  the  31-day  follow-up 
period  after  vaccination  was  reported  for  23.2%  and  17.0%  of  subjects  in  Aboriginal  Infants  and 
Non-Aboriginal Infants groups. 
• 
In the Aboriginals Infants, pyrexia (5.4%) was the most commonly reported unsolicited symptom 
that required medical attention followed by bronchiolitis and otitis media (both 3.6%). In the Non-
Aboriginal  Infants,  eczema  (2.7%)  was  most  commonly  reported  followed  by  bronchiolitis,  otitis 
media and respiratory syncytial virus infection (all three 1.8%). 
Serious adverse events: 
•  SAEs were reported for six subjects in the Aboriginal Infants group during the entire study period. 
Two SAEs were reported after dose 1, three SAEs were reported after dose 2 and one SAE was 
reported after dose 3. All the SAEs were recovered/resolved by the end of the study. 
•  One SAE (Pyrexia) reported for a subject was assessed by the investigator as causally related to 
the study vaccine. This SAE was reported immediately after the administration of the dose 1 and 
this warranted an emergency room visit. This SAE resolved in 2 days. 
•  No fatal SAEs were reported in the study.

2.4. Conclusion: 
•  One  month  after  the  primary  vaccination  with  InfanrixTM  hexa,  anti-PRP  seroprotection  levels  were 
seen  in  97.9%  of  subjects  in  the  Aboriginal  Infants  group  and  in  99.1%  of  subjects  in  the  Non-
Aboriginal Infants group. 
•  Anti-PRP  GMCs  were  6.123  μg/ml  (95%  CI:  4.498-8.334)  in  the  Aboriginal  Infants  group  and 
3.510μg/ml (95% CI: 2.745-4.488) in the Non-Aboriginal Infants group. 
•  One  month  after  the  primary  vaccination  with  Infanrix  hexa,  seroprotective  anti-HBs  antibody 
concentration  ≥ 10  mIU/mL  was  observed  in  100%  of  subjects  in  Aboriginal  Infants  and  Non-
Aboriginal Infants and antibody concentration ≥100 mIU/mL was observed in 97.4% and 97.3% of 
subjects in Aboriginal Infants and Non-Aboriginal Infants groups, respectively. 
• 
The anti-HBs GMCs were 1797.9 mIU/mL (95% CI: 1375.1- 2350.7) and 1544.4 mIU/mL (95% CI: 
1210.4-1970.5) for Aboriginal Infants and Non-Aboriginal Infants groups, respectively. 
•  No confirmatory analyses were performed on the primary and secondary objectives. 
•  At  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  that  required  medical  attention  during  the  31-day  follow-up 
period  after  vaccination  was  reported  for  23.2%  and  17.0%  of  subjects  in  Aboriginal  Infants  and 
Non-Aboriginal Infants groups, respectively. 
•  SAEs were reported for six subjects in the Aboriginal Infants group during the entire study period. 
One  SAE  (pyrexia)  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  causally  related  to  the  study  vaccine.  All 
the SAEs were recovered/resolved by the end of the study. No fatal SAEs were reported. 
• 
In this study, the study vaccine was generally well tolerated. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
No data on the immunogenicity of Rotarix was provided in this report.  
Page 7/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study DTPa-HBV-IPV-118 PRI was not designed to exclude an effect of  Rotarix on the immunogenicity 
and safety of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine in health infants. Those results are not unexpected and do not 
modify the current knowledge on the vaccine.   
   PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

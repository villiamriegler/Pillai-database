1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant GlaxoSmithKline Trading Services submitted on 1 May 2015 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Strimvelis, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 19 September 2013. 
Strimvelis was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/05/313 on 26/08/2005 in the following 
indication: Treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase 
(ADA) deficiency. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Strimvelis is indicated for the treatment of patients 
with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID), for 
whom no suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related stem cell donor is available. The 
approved indication is the same as the indication applied for. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Strimvelis as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: 
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Rare disease designations. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that Autologous CD34+ enriched cell fraction that contains CD34+ cells transduced with retroviral 
vector that encodes for the human ADA cDNA sequence was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0190/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). At the time of submission of 
the application, the PIP P/0190/2014 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0190/2014. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance Autologous CD34+ enriched cell fraction that contains 
CD34+ cells transduced with retroviral vector that encodes for the human ADA cDNA sequence 
contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a fatal 
autosomal recessive monogenic inherited immune disorder.  The main features of ADA-SCID are 
profound lymphopenia, impaired differentiation and function of T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) 
cells; recurrent infections; and failure to thrive.  Non-immunological abnormalities may also occur as a 
consequence of the systemic metabolic defect and include hepatic, lung, and renal disease, lymphoma, 
often associated with cells bearing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes, skeletal alterations, and 
neurological deficits affecting motor function and hearing, and cognitive/behavioural deficits, indicating 
that ADA-SCID is more complex than other forms of SCID. ADA-SCID is ultra-rare, with an overall 
incidence ranging from 0.22 to 0.68 per 100,000 live births, or less than 50 children per year in the 
United States (US) and European Union (EU) combined. The EMA have recognised the importance of 
supporting development of new treatments for Rare Diseases through its alliance with EURORDIS and 
through the FP7 and FP8 frameworks which support innovative research in non-infectious non-cancer 
diseases such as ADA-SCID. The majority of patients with ADA-SCID are diagnosed in the first year of 
life and rarely survive beyond 1 to 2 years unless immune function is restored.   
Current Therapeutic Options for ADA-SCID 
Bone Marrow Transplant: Bone marrow transplant, also known as stem cell transplant (SCT), is a 
potentially curative treatment for ADA-SCID but the effectiveness of the treatment is heavily 
dependent upon the degree of HLA matching between the donor and the patient. A recent analysis of 
outcomes in 106 children with ADA-SCID confirmed similar overall 6.5 year survival rates after 
transplant from matched sibling or matched family donor of 86% and 83%, respectively. However, the 
outcomes are less favourable in the majority of patients for whom matched related donors are not 
available. When patients are treated with cells from less well matched donors, the main risk is graft 
versus host disease (GvHD), a situation where the donor graft recognises the patient as foreign and 
mounts an immune response. The GvHD is usually managed with pre-transplant chemotherapy and 
potent immunosuppressive medicine, which on the other hand, increases the risk of infection. Patients 
for whom no suitable HLA matched related stem cell donor is available might represent a population 
suitable for Strimvelis treatment. 
Enzyme Replacement Therapy: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with polyethylene-glycol-modified 
bovine ADA (PEG-ADA), while not approved in Europe, is available in some Member States via 
compassionate use. Patients require ERT as either weekly or bi-weekly intramuscular injections in 
order to control disease symptoms. A retrospective study of the long-term effects of PEG-ADA 
treatment for 5 to 12 years found that, despite initial improvements, lymphocyte counts were below 
the lower limit of normal for all patients and progressively worsened over time. There was also a 
gradual reduction in thymic function and a decline in mitogenic proliferative responses over time, 
demonstrating reduced T cell function.  It is thought that metabolic reconstitution in the thymus is 
incomplete, and this leads to the gradual loss of immune function.  In published results of patients who 
received ERT between 1986 and 2008, the overall probability of 20-year-survival on ERT was 
estimated to be 78%; however, 18% of patients died due to causes related to immune deficiency. Half 
of the deaths on ERT occurred within the first 6 months of treatment and resulted from conditions 
present at diagnosis (refractory haemolytic anaemia, chronic pulmonary insufficiency, and 
lymphoproliferative disorders). Approximately 50 to 60% of children treated with PEG-ADA develop 
anti-ADA antibodies, and for 10% of the treated children (i.e., in approximately 20% of the children 
that develop antibodies) this leads to neutralization of ADA activity, requiring an increase in dose,

administration of corticosteroids, or cessation of therapy.  Development of sustained autoimmune 
manifestations has been reported in 5% of patients receiving PEG-ADA, including 3 cases of fatal 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.   
Unmet Medical Need in ADA-SCID: Based on the estimate of 50 patients per year born with ADA-SCID, 
5 – 10 will be treatable with SCT from a HLA matched related donor. The remaining patients will 
receive SCT from a less well matched donor or ERT.  The main problems associated with SCT from less 
well matched donors arise from the use of chemotherapeutic pre-conditioning and clinical management 
of GvHD with immunosuppressive drugs that further increase the risk of infection.  The mortality 
following transplant arises mainly due to infection or management of GvHD (>50% sepsis, respiratory 
failure and pneumonitis, 15 % GvHD and 11% fungal infection). The 6.5-year survival rate for these 
patients ranges from 67% for patients treated with SCT from a matched unrelated donor to 29% for 
patients treated with SCT from a haploidentical donor. Enzyme replacement therapy with PEG-ADA is 
not approved for use in Europe, and although it is often available through compassionate use 
programmes, not all patients have access to it. Additionally, patients depend on continuous weekly or 
bi-weekly treatments, while immune reconstitution is variable, and long-term efficacy is limited. 
Hence, for those ADA-SCID patients for whom no suitable HLA matched related donor is available, 
there is a high unmet need for new treatment options that would provide long term corrective therapy 
with an improved probability of survival. 
Strimvelis is a gene therapy product manufactured from the patient’s own CD34+ cells, so called 
autologous cells. The use of the patient’s own cells eliminates the risk of GvHD.  The lack of GvHD risk 
means that patients are less likely to need immunosuppression and are therefore at less risk from 
infection which is the main cause of death after transplantation in ADA-SCID patients. Furthermore, 
gene therapy is not dependent upon a donor search, so it can be made available to any patient. 
Srimvelis is proposed to be a one off treatment, intended to provide life-long benefit. This compares 
favourably to ERT which requires frequent injections (weekly or bi-weekly) and regular monitoring of 
dATP metabolite levels and antibody formation against PEG-ADA.   
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Strimvelis is a gene therapy product which contains autologous genetically modified CD34+ cells. The

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance consists of autologous CD34+ enriched cell fraction that contains CD34+ cells 
transduced with retroviral vector GSK3336223 that encodes for the human ADA cDNA sequence. 
The section on the active substance is separated into two parts on the gene therapy vector 
(GSK3336223) (Part 1) and on the transduced CD34+ cells (Part 2). 
Part 1: Gene Therapy Vector (GSK3336223) 
GSK3336223 is a replication deficient gamma-retroviral vector based on Moloney murine leukaemia 
virus (MoMLV) encoding the cDNA sequence for the human ADA.   
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing Process  
The manufacture of the retroviral vector is performed at MolMed S.p.A., Via Olgettina, 58, 20132 
Milano, Italy. 
The vector production process consists of thawing and expansion of the producer cell line, incubation 
with harvest medium and harvest. This is followed by filtration and freezing. An extensive end-of-
production (EPC) library is established from the producer cell line for the purposes of quality control. 
The applicant has provided an adequate description of the vector manufacturing process. This includes 
a sufficiently detailed description of the manufacturing process steps, flow-charts and separate tables 
of process parameters (PPs), critical process parameters (CPPs), in-process controls (IPCs) and in-
process specifications (IPSs), which give operating ranges, set points and acceptance limits. All CPPs, 
IPCs and IPS have been listed. The applicant has stated that deviations from CPP ranges and IPCs will 
be subject to investigation to determine the impact on CQAs.  
The microbiological control strategy has been set out and is overall acceptable. 
A sufficient description of the batch size and numbering system has been given.  
Control of materials 
GSK3336223 is based on the MoMLV virus with added safety features to prevent generation of 
replication competent retroviruses (RCRs). The applicant states that RCR has never been detected.  
Sufficient description on the construction of the vector and production cell lines was given. A full list of 
the genetic elements and sequence of the provirus was provided.  
The applicant has given a description of the production and analysis of the master cell bank (MCB), 
working cell bank (WCB) and Post-production cell bank (PPCB). From the transfer to MolMed onward, 
banks were laid down in accordance with GMP and only animal material with low risk of TSE was used. 
A full description of the process and materials used was provided. 
Tests performed on the MCB include viability and recovery at thaw, consistency of growth profile, viral 
titre and transduction efficiency, RCRs, vector integration and integrity and sequencing.  
Testing for adventitious agents was conducted in compliance with ICH Q5A (R1).

Process validation 
The validation studies for GSK3336223 are satisfactory. The applicant has submitted adequate 
manufacturing process data. The methods used for analysis are sufficiently set out in different parts of 
the dossier.  
Manufacturing Process development 
An overview over the process development history is given in the dossier.  
Improvements to the safety of certain raw materials were made. 
The development studies were presented as part of the process development and the conclusions are 
accepted and support the comparability studies.  
Comparability of the vector  
The applicant has conducted a pairwise comparability assessment between each consecutive process 
development stage. Analysis focused on potency, identity, genetic stability and safety. 
A concern was raised in relation to the formation of viral aggregates. The applicant has committed to 
develop an assay and monitor viral aggregates.  
Vector control strategy 
The applicant has presented a control strategy which is considered satisfactory and given a list of 
CQAs. Rationales for the testing of certain CQAs are provided. The designation of CPPs and IPCs is 
overall agreed with. The applicant has committed to ongoing process verification during the product life 
cycle. 
Characterisation 
The applicant has conducted the characterisation of the vector based on the proposed release criteria 
combined with additional tests, in particular an analysis of vector stability and integration site analysis. 
An analysis was done to confirm vector integrity and to demonstrate that the provirus is stable. 
For the analysis of product related impurities, the applicant has sufficiently justified that the absence of 
a test for viral aggregate formation is not a safety risk and has further committed to develop an assay 
to test for viral aggregates post licensure.  
The identification of relevant process-related impurities is agreed. 
Specification 
The specifications for retroviral vector GSK3336223 are detailed in the dossier. The applicant has 
outlined the justification for the setting of specifications, based on clinical and manufacturing 
experience.  
Analytical procedures 
The applicant has given an overview over the development of the release assays over time and 
provided descriptions of the most current assays. Methods for analytical procedures are clear and give 
sufficient details of the assays in question. Validation summaries and reports of non-Ph.Eur. assays 
have been submitted and qualification summaries for a number of Ph.Eur. methods have been 
provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 13/95 
 
 
 
 
 
It was noted that all analytical tests that have a viral transduction component are carried out with one 
specific transduction agent instead of another transduction agent, which was identified as a concern. 
During assessment this concern could be alleviated by an analysis and it was not recommended to 
change the transfection reagent as this would require a revalidation of all relevant assays.  
The applicant has submitted sufficient information on the reference standards that are used, and 
details of the manufacture and qualification of each of the reference materials are provided. 
Container closure 
The applicant has adequately described the container closure system for the vector. Acceptance 
specifications for the packaging components have been set out. Upon request, the applicant has 
provided additional information on the container closure and leachables, with respect to storage at -
70°C. 
Stability 
The applicant has presented real time stability data for GSK3336223 supported by accelerated stability 
data. In conclusion tests carried out are appropriate and the requested shelf-life is acceptable. 
Part 2: Transduced CD34+ cells with vector (GSK2696273) 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
The active substance transduced CD34+ cells with vector (GSK2696273) is manufactured at MolMed 
S.p.A., Via Olgettina, 58, 20132 Milano, Italy. To generate the active substance, autologous CD34+ 
cells are isolated and transduced with the retroviral vector GSK3336223 (see part 1). 
Harvest of patient bone marrow is performed at the San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy in accordance 
with the EU Directives 2004/23/EC and 2006/17/EC. The bone marrow material is transferred from the 
syringe into another container and the number of CD34+ cells is assessed and the cells undergo 
microbiological testing. 
Bone marrow aspirate is received into the facility, diluted and mononuclear cells (MNCs) are isolated 
for further processing. Cells are then washed, isolated and transduced with the GSK3336223 retroviral 
vector. 
The applicant has provided an adequate description of the manufacturing process. This includes a 
sufficiently detailed description of the manufacturing process steps, flow-charts and tables of PPs, 
CPPs, IPCs and IPSs, which give operating ranges, set points and acceptance limits. 
A sufficient description of the batch size and numbering system has been provided.     
Control of Materials 
The applicant has provided information on the control of biological raw materials, which includes

Process validation 
The applicant has presented process performance qualification (PPQ) data from a number of 
consecutive batches of active substance.  
Overall the PPQ has been carried out satisfactorily and data were provided for all PPs, CPPs IPCs and 
IPS as well as additional characterisation data. The results demonstrate an acceptable level of process 
consistency. All process parameters were met and acceptable process control was demonstrated. Total 
cell numbers are variable, which is expected due to the variability of the starting material.  
Process development 
The applicant has given an overview of the manufacturing process changes over time.  
Process control strategy: 
The applicant has provided a justification for each CQA. Process parameters were evaluated. Summary 
rationales are provided for each CQA, together with an overview of the analytical method and control 
strategy. 
Concerns were initially raised on the control strategy for transduction efficiency. However, the 
applicant has introduced an assay, which specifically characterises the population of cells in the active 
substance.  
Characterisation 
Characterisation of the transduced CD34+ cells in terms of identity, purity and potency has been 
assembled through comparability studies and additional characterisation studies.  
Characterisation methods together with their description and attributes are detailed. 
Process-related and product-related impurities that could potentially impact safety and/or efficacy of 
Strimvelis have been identified and analysed.  
Specification 
The applicant proposes a release testing strategy in two stages. This approach is considered acceptable 
in the light of the specific properties (i.e. shelf life) and application of the product.  
Potency is tested with a combination of a functional assay, an assay for vector copy number and an 
assay for transduction efficiency. The functional test measures increases in functional activity of 
transduced CD34+ cells as a result of the transduction process compared to a baseline detected in 
non-transduced cells.  
During the procedure, additional information was requested for the reference standards used, including 
details on the manufacture and qualification for each of the reference materials. The applicant has 
committed to establish a new single reference standard with retroviral vector manufactured according 
to the commercial process. This has been accepted. 
The description of analytical methods presented is acceptable. The applicant has given an overview of 
the development of analytical method where this was appropriate, as well as validation studies. The 
requested validation reports have been provided. 
The batch analytical data have been presented, and are within specification. 
Stability

The proposed shelf life for the active substance is 6 hours, when stored under a laminar hood with 
artificial light. The applicant has conducted a satisfactory stability testing programme and included 
relevant stability indicating parameters. The requested active substance shelf life is acceptable. 
Comparability exercise for the Active Substance 
The applicant used a side by side analysis and compared commercial process AS prepared with 
commercial process vector to clinical process active substance prepared with clinical process vector. 
Comparability of the proposed commercial production process with the Process, which was used to 
manufacture clinical trial material, has been demonstrated.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished medicinal product is Strimvelis 1-10 million cells per mL dispersion for infusion. The active 
substance contained in Strimvelis is autologous CD34+ enriched cell fraction that contains CD34+ cells 
transduced with retroviral vector GSK3336223 that encodes for the human ADA cDNA sequence. The 
product is also referred to as GSK2696273 Dispersion for Infusion by the applicant.  
The finished product is supplied in one or more EVA bag, 50 mL nominal fill, with a Luer spike 
interconnector closed with a Luer lock cap. T 
The composition of the finished product is presented in the following Table. 
Table. Composition of the finished product  
The only excipient used in the formulation of GSK2696273 Dispersion for Infusion is 0.9% w/v Sodium 
Chloride Infusion (0.9% sodium chloride), which is routinely used for intravenous infusion. The purpose 
of this excipient is to provide a cell suspension for infusion. 
The final volume of each batch of finished product depends on the quantity of 
haematopoietic/progenitor cells obtained from the active substance manufacture and is patient-
specific.  
Changes during the manufacturing process development are considered moderate. 
Container closure system

GSK2696273 Dispersion for Infusion is filled into sterile, single use, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) bags 
at 50 mL nominal fill.  
Once filled with GSK2696273 Dispersion for Infusion, the EVA bag(s) are placed into an outer box for 
transportation. The secondary packaging is used to protect the bags and includes a bag holder device 
to prevent damage during transportation.  
The applicant has given a satisfactory description of the primary and secondary container closure 
system.  
The compatibility of the finished product with the container closure and administration set has been 
sufficiently demonstrated.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture of the finished product takes place at MolMed S.p.A., Via Olgettina, 58, 20132 Milano, 
Italy. 
The active substance is concentrated and the cell pellet is washed and resuspended in 0.9% w/v 
Sodium Chloride. The cells are then diluted to obtain a concentration of 10 x 106 total viable cells/mL. 
The finished product cell suspension is transferred from the centrifuge tube into the EVA bag.  
The manufacturing process for the finished product has been sufficiently described, flow charts are 
provided and CPPs and their acceptable ranges are given.  
The information set out under control of critical steps and intermediates is overall adequate. 
Batch analytical data have been presented for all batches manufactured and the data are in conformity 
with viability and cell concentration.  
The applicant has presented data on the impurities in the active substance section and no other 
impurities are introduced as part of the finished product manufacturing process.  
Stability of the product 
Based on available stability data, the shelf life of 6 hours stored at 15-30°C as stated in the SmPC is 
acceptable. 
Real time/real condition stability data for finished product stored for twelve hours are presented for 
three batches of GSK2696273 Dispersion for Infusion manufactured at MolMed S.p.A using the 
commercial manufacturing process (A4) with the EVA bag as the primary container.  
Overall the stability data submitted support the requested shelf life. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal product 
The main data set for the comparability of the finished product is presented in the active substance 
section and is based on product manufactured from the active substance comparability batches. 
Adventitious agents 
The applicant has provided sufficient information to demonstrate that the TSE risk of the product is 
managed via appropriate sourcing of FBS. A risk assessment of the parental cell line was conducted. 
Detailed adventitious agents testing were conducted, and the results have been provided. The 
information is acceptable and in compliance with ICH Q5A (R1) guidance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016

The applicant has provided a risk assessment for the detection of bovine and porcine circovirus, which 
provide reassurance of the viral safety of the material. 
GMO 
The active substance consists of autologous haematopoietic stem cells which contain cells genetically 
modified to express the enzyme ADA. Transduction of the cells is achieved with the use of a MoMLV 
based genetically modified retrovirus. Safety features of the virus are described above and an 
environmental risk assessment has been presented by the applicant with respect to the risk of release 
of residual infectious viral particles in the finished product. This assessment is discussed in more detail 
in the non-clinical part. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality part of the dossier is acceptable. Initially several other concerns have been identified and 
the applicant has provided additional information as requested and amended the dossier accordingly.  
In particular the applicant has provided important new data on the transduction efficiency assay, which 
demonstrate that transduction efficiency observed during the clinical study is within the same range as 
that obtained for product from the proposed commercial manufacturing process.  
The applicant has introduced a number of changes both to the vector production and to the 
manufacture of the active substance and finished product in preparation for the commercial 
manufacture. These changes are welcomed as they have increased the quality of the product by 
reducing animal derived substance or the use of substances with reduced adventitious agent risk, 
improving sterility assurance and reducing process residuals in the finished product.  
In support of the commercial process, the applicant has also submitted a comparability study. In light 
of the additional information submitted by the applicant, it is considered that the commercial process is 
comparable to the clinical process. 
Clinical batches cover a fairly wide range of specifications. However as Strimvelis has been in clinical 
development for a long time with a demonstrated favourable efficacy and safety record the acceptance 
of the release specifications on the basis of clinical qualification is considered acceptable. In this 
respect the applicant also demonstrated that release of future commercial batches is within the 
clinically qualified boundaries, despite changes introduced for the proposed commercial manufacturing 
process as described above. 
The applicant has agreed to a number of post-approval recommendations aimed at completing the set 
of specifications, characterisation tests for the retroviral vector, stability data and to introduce the 
validated transduction efficiency test. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall Quality of Strimvelis is considered acceptable. The different aspects of the chemical, 
pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with existing guidelines. The manufacturing 
process of the active substance is adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance 
is well characterised and appropriate specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished 
product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled 
by adequate test methods and specifications. Adventitious agents’ safety including TSE safety has been 
sufficiently assured.  
No measures necessary to address the any quality developments issues have been identified that have

a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal product.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects as described above. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CAT/CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 10 recommendations aimed at 
completing the set of specifications, characterisation tests for the retroviral vector, stability data and to 
introduce the validated transduction efficiency test, are agreed between the Applicant and the 
CHMP/CAT.  The details of these recommendations are deleted as they are considered commercially 
confidential.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the recommendation(s) for future quality 
development as described above. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Strimvelis is a gene therapy medicinal product developed the treatment ADA-SCID when no suitable 
HLA-matched related stem cell donor is available. Strimvelis consists of autologous CD34+ cell fraction 
containing CD34+ cells transduced with retroviral vector that encodes for the human ADA cDNA 
sequence. Transduced CD34+ cells are expected to engraft into bone marrow, divide, and differentiate 
allowing reconstitution of immune and metabolic functions, improving immune protection, systemic 
detoxification and survival.  
The non-clinical study reports, summaries and bibliographic data are included for pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics, and toxicology. Due to the innate nature of GSK2696273 and limitations associated 
with investigating the clinical vector in standard animal models, most nonclinical studies were deemed 
unlikely to provide meaningful insight into the clinical safety of GSK2696273 or were considered not to 
be feasible. Therefore, certain nonclinical studies, such as safety pharmacology, select pharmacokinetic 
studies, e.g. absorption, distribution, and excretion; genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and other 
studies are not considered relevant. As Strimvelis contains GMOs within the meaning of Directive 
2001/18/EC, a GMO Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been provided.  
The nonclinical studies conducted as part of the development of GSK2696273 employed the use of the 
GSK3336223 vector; however, it was not practical or ethical to harvest patient bone marrow (BM) to 
obtain sufficient CD34+ cells for use in all nonclinical studies. Therefore, some nonclinical test 
materials were developed with cells from alternate sources. Hence, whilst some pharmacology studies 
utilised patient bone marrow cells, other studies used peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) or CD34+ 
cells derived from healthy human umbilical cord blood (UCB) or murine lineage negative (lin-) BM cells 
(considered the murine equivalent of human CD34+ cells) transduced with the GSK3336223 vector (or 
vectors with similar backbones). Subsequently, the following company codes apply: GSK3235757A 
stands for Healthy human UCB transduced with GSK3336223 vector; GSK2959346 stands for Murine 
lin- BM cells transduced with GSK3336223 vector.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The early nonclinical development of GSK2696273 was conducted by TIGET and the summary of the 
nonclinical studies (see below) were made available to the applicant as the only source of data. The 
data is not contained in formal standalone reports. However, it is stated that that information is 
superseded by the more robust descriptions in the literature. Accordingly, two publications [Ficara, 
2004] and [Cassani, 2008] are considered the primary source of the pharmacology data. These early 
development results are based on a small numbers of samples using early batches of autologous 
CD34+ enriched cell fraction that contains CD34+ cells transduced with retroviral vector encoding for 
human ADA cDNA (GSK2696273) in non-validated assays. For the purposes of this application, the 
drug product utilised in this early development stage is considered representative of the product now 
proposed for marketing. 
The summary report provides discussion on the following points:  
 
In vitro transduction efficiency: CD34+ cells obtained from umbilical cord blood (UCB) from 
healthy human donors or BM from ADA-SCID patients were transduced with the GSK3336223 
vector. The full range of TEs on CD34+ cells across all nonclinical pharmacology studies was 
14% to 45%. These data all served to demonstrate that GSK3336223 vector is able to 
consistently transduce cells from various sources. 
 
In vitro vector copy number (VCN): Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed vector DNA in 
CD34+ cells from healthy donors or ADA-SCID patients transduced with GSK3336223 viral 
lots. VCN in the transduced CD34+ cells ranged from 0.14 to 2.2 (measured by quantitative 
PCR) and did not correlate with vector titre or transduction efficiency. Across all these 
experiments VCN ranged from 0.3 to 3.2 and demonstrated a good correlation with viral titre 
but not transduction efficiency. 
In a further study, VCN ranged between 0.12-1.87 in 5 clinical CD34+ cell batches. In this 
study transduction was carried out in tissue culture plates; for the first transduction the vector 
was preloaded onto retronectin-coated plates. For the second and third transduction cycle the 
vector was diluted in culture medium at the concentration of 0.5x106 cells/ml. 
 
In vitro functional activity: GSK3336223 supernatant (3 lots) was tested for the ability to 
transfer ADA into murine lineage negative (ADA-/-) progenitor cells from ADA-deficient mice. 
There was no ADA activity in untransduced cells; however, one week after transduction, ADA 
activity was detected (15% to 36% of normal BM ADA). Additionally, CD34+ cells from the BM 
of ADA-SCID patients were transduced with the GSK3336223 vector. ADA expression, 
measured by intracellular fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses, was detectable 
(20% to 39%) in transduced CD34+ cells after short-term in vitro culture and absent (as 
expected) in un-transduced cells. 
Unpublished data (Cassani et al., in preparation) cited by the applicant state that T-cell from 
ADA-SCID patients have impaired proliferative responses and Th1/Th2 cytokine production, in 
association with a defect in TCR signalling, transcription of cytokine genes and kinase 
activation (CREB, MAPK). Consequently, details of a further investigation are presented:  
human ADA-deficient T cell lines transduced with the GSK3336223 vector demonstrated a 
similar proliferative capacity and production of cytokines when compared with healthy donor 
cells, presumably demonstrating ‘functional’ restoration following gene transfer, further 
supporting the rationale for gene therapy in ADA-SCID patients.

 
In vivo engraftment: Because ethical restrictions of harvesting of human bone marrow for 
experimental purposes limit in vivo studies of the human hematolymphoid system, substitute 
human to small animal xenotransplantation models has been employed. Although existing 
models sustain only limited development and maintenance of human lymphoid cells and rarely 
produce immune responses it has been reported that intrahepatic injection of CD34 human 
cord blood cells into conditioned newborn recombinase activating gene 2 (RAG2)-gamma chain 
immunodeficient mice (a mutant strain that lacks B, T, and NK cells) permits engraftment of 
human CD34+ stem progenitor cells and differentiation in different hematopoietic lineages to 
assess the biodistribution of genetically modified human CD34+ cells [Traggiai, 2004]. 
Therefore, this model was employed for GSK3336223-transduced CD34+ cells from the BM of 
ADA-SCID patients. The summary states that results demonstrated that these transduced cells 
engrafted into BM, differentiated normally into T (CD4+ and CD8+) and B (CD19+) 
lymphocytes in lymphoid organs (thymus, BM and spleen) and circulated in peripheral blood. 
The literature data on primary pharmacology supersede the above summary reports.  Two publications 
(IL-3 or IL-7 increases ex vivo gene transfer efficiency in ADA-SCID BM CD34+ cells while maintaining 
in vivo lymphoid potential; Ficara et al, 2004) and (Altered intracellular and extracellular signalling 
leads to impaired T-cell functions in ADA-SCID patients; Cassani et al, 2008) are considered by the 
applicant the primary source of pharmacology data.  
 
Ficara et al, 2004 
In vitro: CD34+ cells obtained from UCB or BM (healthy donors and ADA-SCID patients) were used 
to optimise gene transfer and transduction conditions to maintain stem/progenitor cell properties. 
Cells were grown in serum free media and were subjected to three rounds of transduction with RV, 
in the presence of fibronectin fragment (retronectin) to favour co-localisation of target cells with 
vector particles. To assess their multilineage differentiation potential, unmanipulated, 
untransduced and transduced CD34+ cells were used in clonal assays of differentiation. Several 
combinations of cytokines and culture medium were tested using BML-1 vector (RVs with the same 
backbone as GSK3336223) encoding a cell surface marker gene (ΔNGFR) to assist with detection, 
quantification, and purification of transduced cells. Optimal conditions for ex vivo gene transfer and 
maintenance of haematopoietic progenitor cells included cytokine stem cell factors 
[thrombopoietin, FMS-like tyrosinekinase 3 ligand as well as interleukin (IL)-3] and 
supplementation of medium with 4% foetal calf serum. Cultured CD34+ cells maintained the ability 
to differentiate into myeloid and erythroid cells (in clonogenic assays) and to differentiate into B 
and natural killer (NK) cells (in lymphoid differentiation assay). Up to 50% of ex vivo cultured 
CD34+ cells maintained the CD34+ cell phenotype. 
In vivo: Immunodeficient mice were implanted with human hematolymphoid tissues (SCID-hu 
mice), irradiated and transplanted with a single dose of cultured/transduced CD34+ cells. The 
transduced CD34+ cells engrafted in mice, produced vector-marked and transgene expressing T 
and B cells and maintained in vivo lymphoid reconstitution capacity. The ex vivo gene transfer and 
culture conditions did not compromise the reconstitution potential of stem/progenitor cells in 
human-mouse chimeras. 
Ex vivo: Efficient correction and engraftment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with lymphoid 
potential is the main goal of gene therapy for primary immunodeficiencies, including ADA-SCID. 
The first ADA/SCID clinical protocol for Study Number AD1117054 was based on the optimised 
transduction conditions from the nonclinical studies described above. BM was harvested from the 
patient, 4 and 11 months after receiving GSK2696273. Purified CD34+ cells were then injected 
into SCID-hu mice. Eight weeks post dose, engraftment levels of donor cells ranged from 85% to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 21/95 
 
 
 
 
 
98%. CD34+ cells gave rise to T and B lymphoid progeny with all the thymic subpopulations 
present in the expected ratios. Vector-containing cells were measured in B (up to 15%) and T (up 
to 31%) lymphocytes as well as T cell lines of donor origin (up to 42%). There was no increase in 
the proportion of transduced cells compared to the initial frequency of the CD34+ cell population, 
most likely due to the lack of a selective advantage in the normal, detoxified microenvironment of 
the SCID-hu mouse. However, the frequency of transduced T cells increased 4 weeks after culture, 
suggesting an in vitro survival advantage. 
  Cassani et al, 2008 
Biochemical/functional studies: BM samples collected from three ADA/SCID patients under clinical 
studies AD1117054, AD117056 and AD115611 were harvested before and 10 to 30 months after 
dosing GSK2696273. Cells from ADA-SCID patients generally have decreased activity in the S-
adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) enzyme, high susceptibility to apoptosis after exposure to 
adenosine and impaired proliferative responses and Th1/Th2 cytokine production (T cells). T cell 
lines (post dose) expressed the ADA protein (intracellular FACS analysis). ADA activity was 
detected in all patients, albeit not to normal levels in all patients. SAHH was restored in T cells, 
suggesting that transgene expression reached therapeutic levels sufficient to correct the metabolic 
defect. Intracellular signalling was also corrected in T cell lines, resulting in restoration of normal 
proliferative responses and production of cytokines. Apoptosis was normalised in gene-corrected T 
cells. However, the authors concluded ‘that it remains to be established whether ADA expressed by 
circulating or resident gene-corrected hematopoietic cells will be sufficient to correct long-term the 
nonimmune manifestations of the disease’. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacology studies were considered feasible in animals or relevant to the 
administration of GSK2696273 to humans. Due to the specific, unique and ubiquitous role of the ADA 
enzyme, this is unlikely to cause any off-target activity. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
As per the applicant’s statement, no safety pharmacology studies were considered feasible in animals 
or relevant to the administration of GSK2696273 to humans. This was due to the fact that 
GSK2696273 is an autologous, patient derived product expressing a single therapeutic gene (ADA) as 
well as a NeoR selection marker gene. The therapeutic gene product is an intracellular enzyme with 
ubiquitous expression in healthy ADA+/+ humans. ADA protein expression and enzymatic activity 
following transduction with GSK2696273 are below or equal to physiological levels. Therefore, the 
applicant concludes that even if inadvertently expressed in non-target cells (e.g. heart) there are 
unlikely to be any adverse functional consequences. Although it is assumed that within the target cell 
population there will be cells with a higher than average VCN that might lead to overexpression of the 
ADA gene, the applicant clarified that clinical enzymatic activity levels in patients reported thus far 
does not suggest enzymatic activity above that reported in healthy volunteers where ADA expression is 
ubiquitous unlike in the gene therapy setting (transduced cells only). The applicant also addressed the 
CAT/CHMP’s question on the likelihood of secondary transduction (non-target cells) due to the 
presence of residual vector in the plasma. Steps taken during the manufacturing process (e.g. washing 
residual vector from DP and subsequent reported levels of residual vector being below the level of 
quantification) are expected to allow for the impact on safety and efficacy to be considered low. 
Further reassurance is given by the fact that no transduction of non-target cells was shown in the non-
clinical biodistribution study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 22/95 
 
 
 
 
 
Considering the arguments regarding the likelihood of achieving even physiological levels overall, the 
CAT/CHMP reassured that adequate precautions and investigations have been employed (e.g. 
manufacturing process/biodistribution study). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed with GSK2696273 and this was 
considered acceptable to the CAT/CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Since Strimvelis is a gene therapy medicinal product, the standard programme of pharmacokinetic 
studies for a new chemical entity is not strictly applicable. Furthermore, due to the nature of 
Strimvelis, most studies were considered by the applicant as neither feasible nor informative for 
administration to humans; therefore, the majority of standard nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies were 
not conducted (e.g. absorption, excretion, metabolism, drug interaction). Nevertheless, the toxicity of 
the concomitant use of busulfan was discussed. 
Subsequently, the results of two bio-distribution studies were submitted using the NSG mouse based 
on the reports presented that indicate this is a valid model for immunodeficient mice, which can be 
used as recipient of HSPC transplantation, with longer survival rates and reduced frequency of 
spontaneous tumours as compared to ADA-/- mice. Transplantation of haematopoietic stem/progenitor 
cells (HSPC) into NSG mice requires conditioning via chemotherapy or irradiation, in order to provide 
depletion of endogenous bone marrow and to allow the engraftment of donor HSPC. Studying 
biodistribution in immunodeficient mice given human cord-blood derived-product generally suffices to 
address the expectations for kinetic data.  
In the pilot study, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and vector copy number (VCN) analyses 
in group 1 (received busulfan treatment as pre-conditioning) and group 3 (irradiation pre-conditioning) 
showed successful engraftment of transduced UCB cells in NSG mice both after busulfan conditioning 
and irradiation. The percentage of human lymphocytes (mainly B cells) was relatively stable in the 
peripheral blood at 8 and 10 weeks after transplantation. This finding is consistent with reports in 
literature showing efficient reconstitution of human immune cells with preferential and earlier 
development of B cells in NSG mice. The bone marrow showed human haematopoietic stem cell 
engraftment with multi-lineage differentiation of lymphoid and myeloid cells. In the peripheral 
lymphoid organs, human T- and B-cell differentiation could be observed in the thymus and spleen 
respectively. Group 1 showed significantly higher engraftment levels as compared to group 3 which is a 
finding supported by bibliographic data. 
The VCN measured in whole blood and BM was variable but overall comparable between both groups 
and time points. A higher VCN was observed in mice in group 1 (conditioned with busulfan) in 
comparison with group 3 (irradiated). With the exception of thymus samples from one mouse, which 
failed engraftment, VCN was detected in 93% of samples. No significant statistical differences in VCN 
were observed in PB or lymphoid organs.  
Subsequent to these results, busulfan was selected for pre-conditioning of mice in the definitive study. 
In this study, three groups were utilised (RV transduced human UCB cells, mock-transduced cells and 
busulfan vehicle only controls). The last observation point was 16 weeks and no clinical signs 
attributable to treatment were reported. Busulfan-related deaths occurred in in the first month of 
treatment but not in the control animals. Successful engraftment and immune reconstitution were 
recorded in both groups of NSG mice transplanted with RV(GSK3336223)-transduced or mock-
transduced cells. Histopathological analyses on target lymphoid organs assessed the biodistribution of

EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 23/95 
 
 
 
 
 
human cells in busulfan-conditioned and transplanted NSG mice. Reconstitution of the haematopoietic 
system in successfully transplanted mice was observed secondary to transplantation and engraftment 
(increased white pulp cellularity in the spleen and bone marrow). As expected from the hematopoietic 
nature of the test item and its distribution in the blood stream, the presence of low levels of human 
cells was also detected by qPCR in non-target organs such as the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, 
muscle and gonads. The presence of RV specific sequences was assessed in whole blood, bone marrow, 
spleen and non-target organs of NSG transplanted mice. In blood, VCN was generally lower (in 
comparison to the VCN measured in the test Item batch before infusion) after administration, but 
comparable between time points and between sexes. 
Low amounts of human DNA and RV sequences were detected in the gonads. The applicant explained 
that this was likely due to the contamination by residual blood containing transduced human cells or 
the presence of resident monocyte-derived cells of human origin. DNA sequences specific to the human 
ADA gene were detected in 4/18 gonad samples harvested in group 3 at level of the definitive 
biodistribution study above the LOQ indicating exposure in the gonads.  Considering the Guideline on 
non-clinical testing for inadvertent germline transmission of gene transfer vectors, the applicant has 
provided a discussion related to risk of germline transmission (see section on Reproductive 
Toxicology). 
No nonclinical studies were performed to assess vector shedding after GSK2696273 administration. As 
reflected in the valid guidance (EMEA/CHMP/GTWP/12459/2006, Guideline on the non-clinical studies 
required before first clinical use of gene therapy medicinal products), biodistribution, persistence, 
mobilisation and shedding should be assessed.  The applicant states that in humans, the possibility of 
vector shedding (e.g. via urine or other body fluids) after Strimvelis administration is extremely low as 
the number of infectious vector particles was below the LLQ. As this RV is derived from murine cells 
lines, added reassurance is given due to reports that such RVs are known to be inactivated by human 
serum via the classical complement cascade. Additionally, as Strimvelis will be administered only once, 
this limits further any possible vector shedding. It is also stated that no evidence of replication 
competent retrovirus (RCR) was detected in clinical trials with GSK2696273.  
In conclusion, investigations of distribution of transduced cells in a relevant non-clinical model showed 
comparable capacity of transduced and mock-transduced CD34+ cells to engraft and reconstitution in 
vivo was demonstrated confirming that transduced cells are not directed to specific sites. Successfully 
transplanted mice showed reconstitution of the haematopoietic system secondary to transplantation 
and engraftment, i.e. increased cellularity in the white pulp of the spleen and BM. Low levels of human 
cells were detected in non-target organs and this is not unexpected due to the hematopoietic nature of 
the test item. Low levels of human DNA and RV sequences were detected in the gonads and other non-
target organs, likely due to contamination by residual blood containing transduced human cells and the 
risk that may be associated with the potential for germline transmission are addressed in the 
toxicology section below. Of note, histological changes in the testes and ovaries (i.e. atrophy), 
considered to be related to the administration of busulfan, were observed in both groups that received 
conditioning. The observation time to determine survival, engraftment and clinical signs in this 
combined biodistribution/toxicology study was 16 weeks. Biodistribution analysis did not show any 
evidence of transduction of non-target cells: vector DNA was only detected in the presence of donor 
cells.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Due to the nature of GSK2696273, single dose toxicity studies were not conducted. It is stated that 
GSK2696273 consists of patient-derived cells expressing a housekeeping gene at or below 
physiological levels. Therefore selected general toxicity endpoints were assessed in the definitive 
biodistribution study in mice, see table below.

The test item used in the biodistribution studies (referred to as GSK3235757A) comprised of CD34+ 
cells derived from healthy human UCB transduced with GSK3336223 vector and is accepted as 
representative of Strimvelis. In this study, NSG mice (n=10/sex/group) were pre-conditioned with 
busulfan [40 mg/kg total dose over 2 days; intraperitoneal (IP)] prior to dosing transduced cells 
(single intravenous (IV) dose (2 x105 cells) of CD34+ cells derived from human UCB transduced with 
either the GSK3336223 vector (GSK3235757A) or mock-transduced. Control mice (n=5/sex) were 
given busulfan vehicle only. Clinical observations, body weight, macroscopic examination; microscopic 
examination of bone marrow (long bone), spleen, thymus, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, 
gonads and macroscopic abnormalities were recorded.  
One male and 3 female mice (Days 8 and 15, 25, 28, respectively) in the mock-transduced group and 
2 males (Days 17, 24) in the GSK3235757A group were found dead or euthanised. These deaths were 
attributed to acute toxicity of the pre-conditioning treatment (busulfan) or the transplantation 
procedure. 
One mouse in the GSK3235757A group developed lymphomas; however, this was not considered 
treatment related as there was no confirmed engraftment of human cells (<1% of BM CD45+ cells) 
and no vector DNA sequences were detected in this mouse. The changes observed in the 
haematopoietic system were considered related to the transplantation and engraftment of UCB CD34+ 
cells and their progeny in NSG mice that have a severe depletion of lymphoid cells. There was an 
increased incidence and severity of vacuolation of alveolar macrophages in mice receiving mock-
transduced cells or GSK3235757A when compared to controls. Since this was observed in both groups 
it was not considered related to treatment with GSK3235757A. 
Very marked atrophy of the testicular seminiferous tubules and marked or very marked atrophy 
ovaries with no oocytes present were observed in virtually all successfully engrafted animals (>1% 
human CD45+ BM cells) from both transplanted groups. This was independent from GSK3235757A or 
control, but is consistent with an effect of busulfan conditioning. Since exposure to busulfan was not 
measured in mice in this study a comparison with human exposure cannot be made. However, whilst 
the busulfan dose relative to body weight used in this study was higher than the dose used for pre-
conditioning in patients prior to treatment with Strimvelis, the doses used in mice and in patients on 
Assessment report

mg/m2 basis are equivalent. In addition, busulfan is known to have the potential for gonadotoxic 
effects in humans. The exact severity of any gonadotoxic effects in patients cannot be predicted with 
certainty. 
The use of NSG mouse strain (deficient in mature T/B/NK cells) for the non-clinical 
biodistribution/single-dose toxicology study after engraftment of CD34+ cells derived from healthy 
human UCB, transduced with GSK3336223 vector, was endorsed by the CAT/CHMP prior to MAA 
submission. This is due to the fact that survival rates of this mouse strain extend to >16 months, 
allowing for long term toxicology observations, that would otherwise not be possible in other immune-
compromised mouse strains (with NOD backgrounds). Strimvelis will be administered to ADA-SCID 
patients as a single IV infusion with a dose range of 2 to 20 x106 CD34+ cells/kg. In this study, mice 
were administered 10 x106 CD34+ cells/kg (approximately the midpoint of the dose range to be 
infused in human subjects) without test-item-related adverse effects. The CAT/CHMP noted that the 
changes observed in the haematopoietic system were not considered related to the treatment.  
As no safety margins calculation was made by the applicant, the CAT/CHMP requested a clarification. 
The doses administered provide only safety margin of approximately half the highest dose 
administered in humans (20 x106 CD34+ cells/kg). The product administration did not result in 
apparent dose-limiting toxicities observed in the clinical programme and there was a low risk of 
overexpression. Although it is not possible to establish a safe VCN, this has been maintained at a 
lowest possible degree that results in sufficient transduction efficiency. Taking into account the 
proposed indication and the evaluation of the risk of use of the product, the CAT/CHMP considered this 
issue resolved. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Due to the nature of Strimvelis, repeat dose toxicity studies were not conducted since GSK2696273 
consists of patient-derived cells that are intended to consist of the ADA gene, to allow for expression of 
the related ubiquitous protein at or below physiological levels. Furthermore, the intended clinical use is 
once only, with longer term exposure of the resultant protein expected. This is accepted by the 
CAT/CHMP. 
Genotoxicity 
Conventional genotoxicity assays are inappropriate to detect insertional events and would not provide 
additional information to inform a quantitative risk assessment in humans and hence no studies have 
been conducted. 
Carcinogenicity 
The use of ƴRV mediated gene therapy has been associated with insertional mutagenesis/oncogenesis 
with in several different gene therapy trials.  For ADA-SCID, analysis of ƴRV integrants has been 
analysed in a similar way to the studies for the other immuno-deficiencies and shows a very similar 
insertional profile.  Integrations are found predominantly in and around the transcriptional start site of 
genes and insertions have been found in genes associated with cell cycle control, cell signalling and 
near known oncogenes such as LMO-2. Due to these known risks, the applicant was advised in 2007 to 
produce data from animal studies and/or discuss the applicability of all available animal models for 
insertional oncogenesis with the view of monitoring post-treatment for 12 months (the latency period 
for hematopoietic malignancies can be >6 months). The applicant discussed why it was not possible to 
generate suitable experimental conditions to allow for long term analysis of the in vivo carcinogenicity 
potential of the test item.

Following administration of GSK2959346, the achieved VCN was low and there was no long term 
engraftment of transduced cells in mice. To increase the likelihood of long term engraftment, 
alterations were made to optimise transduction conditions for murine cells and for engraftment. The 
impact of different transduction conditions of cells was tested in vitro and in vivo; the effect of the 
genetic background of mouse cells and the type of vector used were also examined. In the short term, 
transduction of murine cells and engraftment into mice was achieved. However, the applicant stated 
that it was not possible to demonstrate stable, long term engraftment of transduced cells under any 
condition tested in these pilot studies (with the exception of cells transduced with a lentiviral vector 
carrying ADA cDNA). The attempted in vitro and in vivo approaches to allow for the assessment of risk 
of clonal expansion and tumour arising from genetically modified cells, although unsuccessful, are 
accepted as comprehensive investigations. The study description indicates they were scientifically 
thought through and no further investigations are warranted at this time.  
None of 18 subjects treated with GSK2696273 have developed leukaemia or MDS despite a median of 
7 years and a maximum of 13 years of follow-up. Investigations for other haematological abnormalities 
that could be indicative of clonal abnormalities including B cell immunoglobulin production, T-cell 
receptor V-beta repertoire, bone marrow morphology and immunophenotype, peripheral blood smears, 
and cytogenetic karyotype analysis showed no clinically problematic changes. The encouraging safety 
record for gamma retroviral vectors in ADA-SCID is supported by the finding that none of the 40 
patients with ADA-SCID that have received gene therapy with either GSK2696273 (n=18) or other 
comparable gamma retroviral vectors (n=22) with an extended follow-up period have developed 
leukaemia. 
In summary, in previous scientific advice, it was agreed that the tumourgenicity risk assessment for 
GSK2696273 could be based on clinical data and literature on similar vectors if tumourgenicity/general 
toxicity studies were unsuccessful in allowing for the determination of optimal conditions for a full 
tumourgenicity study.  Conducted pilot studies indicate that a tumourgenicity study is not feasible 
since it was not possible to demonstrate long-term engraftment of transduced cells in mice.  Although 
clinical data appear reassuring, thus far; from a non-clinical perspective the carcinogenic potential due 
to insertional mutagenesis and the potential for subsequent clonal expansion cannot be determined at 
the time of assessment.  Accordingly, the SmPC states that carcinogenicity studies have not been 
conducted as no adequate animal model was available to evaluate the tumourigenic potential of 
Strimvelis due to the inability to achieve long-term engraftment of transduced cells in mice. In 
addition, the RMP was updated and the risk of malignancy will be assessed via adverse event reports 
received during the ongoing long-term follow up of study AD1115611 and the proposed patient 
registry. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies were conducted with GSK2696273. Patients will 
receive a low dose of busulfan as pre-conditioning treatment. Busulfan has a known gonadotoxic 
effects in humans and animals and this was confirmed in the biodistribution study in mice. Some 
relevant toxicity endpoints, including histopathology of testes and ovary, were evaluated in the pilot 
and the definitive biodistribution study and the presence of the transgene was reported. No juvenile 
studies were deemed necessary. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Due to the nature of the product, no specific toxicokinetic studies have been conducted.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies were not considered necessary by the applicant and the CAT/CHMP, as stem 
cell treatment administered IV is a well-established clinical therapy and transduction of autologous cell 
does not alter the physicochemical properties of the cells. 
Other toxicity studies 
Not applicable 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, and Regulation 726/2004 require that the applicant evaluates the 
potential risk of the medicinal product to the environment. Unlike the ERA for medicinal products that 
are chemically derived, there is no action limit for GTMP about which threshold limit may be an 
environmental risk. There is no threshold for environmental effects; therefore a calculation of 
environmental risk is based on the probability of transmission of the GTMP from the patient to third 
party persons, animals, plants or the environment at large. 
The ERA submitted is comprehensive and includes evaluation of both, the characteristics of 
GSK2696273 (Strimvelis) cells and of GSK3336223 (RV) viral vector particles, and of the potential 
exposure of people or the environment to Strimvelis dispersion for infusion. It is demonstrated that 
following transduction with GSK2696273 Dispersion for Infusion, the patient’s cells are washed and 
previous drug product samples showed that little to no residual vector remained. However, in order to 
evaluate the worst-case scenario, it was assumed that minor traces remain in the product. All relevant 
GSK3336223-related manufacturing materials, though, are tested for recombinant virus formation in 
line with good manufacturing practice. Adequate safe-handling practises are in place limiting the 
possibility of healthcare professionals being exposed to Strimvelis. Moreover, the implementation of 
‘contained use’ conditions minimises the possibility of the product contaminating the administration 
site or reaching the environment beyond the administration site. All associated waste is treated as a 
biohazard. Manufacture and administration are proposed at the same location and the number of 
patients is predicted to be ~20/year. The applicant adequately addressed the probability of introducing 
surface-bound retroviral particles. Further reassurance is given by the fact that Strimvelis is rapidly 
inactivated outside of appropriate host as the cells are autologous to the specific patient.  
Finally, the ERA discussed the possibility of the formation of replication-competent retrovirus (RCR). 
Specifically, it is stated that this was not detected in clinical trials. In theory, the likelihood is deemed 
to be minimal, primarily due to the fact that the drug product has minimal homology with human 
endogenous retroviral sequences (HERV) and does not code for gag, pol or env sequences (required for 
RCR formation). The environmental risk posed by these theoretical figures is negligible. Based on the 
information provided in the ERA, Strimvelis poses a negligible risk to people and the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology studies indicated that the gene is expressed at the relevant site(s) at an appropriate 
level and that functional activity is realised. The absence of secondary and safety pharmacology 
studies is accepted on the basis that there studies were not were considered feasible in animals or 
relevant to the administration of GSK2696273 to humans.  Pharmacokinetics addressed primarily the 
tissue distribution and duration of exposure. Biodistribution analysis did not show any evidence of 
transduction of non-target cells: vector DNA was only detected in the presence of donor cells. Low 
levels of human DNA and RV sequences were detected in the gonads and other non-target organs,

likely due to contamination by residual blood containing transduced human cells. The risk that may be 
associated with the potential for germline transmission is discussed in the toxicology section below. 
Histological changes in the testes and ovaries, considered to be related to the administration of 
busulfan, were observed in both groups that received conditioning. Toxicology was evaluated in a 
single dose (IV) mouse (NSG) biodistribution/toxicology studies. The pivotal study had a 4 month 
follow-up without test-item-related adverse effects and also evaluated the biodistribution of transduced 
CD34+ cells and their progeny to haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic organs, the possibility of 
transfer of vector to gonads and the histopathology of major organs. The test item used in the 
definitive biodistribution study was prepared from healthy human UCB CD34+ cells transduced with 
the GSK3336223 vector, manufactured using the commercial process. Histologically, the changes 
observed in the haematopoietic system were considered related to the transplantation and 
engraftment of UCB CD34+ cells and their progeny in NSG mice that have a severe depletion of 
lymphoid cells. This includes the increased white pulp cellularity in the spleen and the foci of immature 
looking cells observed in the bone marrow of the long bone. There was no evidence of thymic 
reconstitution in either mock transduced or transduced groups. The splenic and thymic observations 
have been previously reported in the literature. 
Due to the nature of Strimvelis, repeat dose toxicity studies were not conducted since GSK2696273 
consists of patient-derived cells that are intended to consist of the ADA gene, to allow for expression of 
the related ubiquitous protein, which the applicant states will be at or below physiological levels. 
Moreover, the intended clinical use is once only, with longer term exposure of the resultant protein 
expected. The absence of repeat dose toxicity is accepted by the CAT/CHMP. 
The use of gamma-retroviral vector mediated gene therapy has been associated with insertional 
mutagenesis in 3 different gene therapy trials.  Due to these known risks, the applicant was advised in 
2007 to produce data from animal studies and/or discuss the applicability of all available animal 
models for insertional oncogenesis with the view of monitoring post-treatment for 12 months. In 
addition, long-term clinical monitoring is expected. Standard genotoxicity studies, as applied to a 
conventional chemical drug, are not relevant for this type of product and were hence not performed. In 
the carcinogenicity program, the applicant discussed why it was not possible to generate suitable 
experimental conditions to allow for long term analysis of the in vivo carcinogenicity potential of the 
test item. As clarified, after administration of GSK2959346, the VCN achieved was low and there was 
no long term engraftment of transduced cells in mice. To increase the likelihood of long term 
engraftment, alterations were made to optimise transduction conditions for murine cells and for 
engraftment. The impact of different transduction conditions of cells was tested in vitro and in vivo; 
the effect of the genetic background of mouse cells and the type of vector used were also examined. In 
the short term, transduction of murine cells and engraftment into mice was achieved. However, the 
applicant states that it was not possible to demonstrate stable, long term engraftment of transduced 
cells under any condition tested in these pilot studies (with the exception of cells transduced with a 
lentiviral vector carrying ADA cDNA). The attempted in vitro and in vivo approaches to allow for the 
assessment risk of clonal expansion and tumour arising from genetically modified cells, although 
unsuccessful, are accepted as comprehensive investigations. The study description indicates they were 
scientifically thought through and it is accepted that no further investigations are warranted at this 
time. From a non-clinical perspective, the carcinogenic potential due to insertional mutagenesis and 
the potential for subsequent clonal expansion cannot be determined at the time of assessment. 
Accordingly, the SmPC and RMP have been updated and the applicant has agreed to a long-term follow 
up of patients in clinical practise (15 years) and to monitoring of potential mutagenicity. 
In the single dose biodistribution/toxicology study, marked atrophy in gonads of both sexes was 
observed. It was concluded that this was a consequence of busulfan conditioning. Germline transfer is

regarded a major concern in human gene therapy. It is noted that the risk of germline transfer 
associated with the administration of genetically modified human cells is considered to be low and 
animal testing of human cells may be difficult if not meaningful; hence non-clinical germline 
transmission studies of human genetically modified cells are generally not recommended. This is 
therefore dependent upon clinical monitoring. However, most ADA-SCID patients are treated within the 
first few years of life before puberty begins. 
No further studies with GSK2696273 were conducted and the absence of any additional studies is 
adequately justified. 
Finally a comprehensive environmental risk assessment (ERA) was conducted in accordance with 
Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment. Considering the data discussed in 
the ERA, Strimvelis is not expected to pose a risk to the environment providing handling precautions 
are carried out as stated in the SmPC in order to minimise any potential risks to the environment. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CAT considered the non-clinical data adequate for characterisation of the non-clinical profile of 
Strimvelis. The lack of certain studies was fully justified and there are no unresolved issues. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant 
has clarified that the pivotal study was initiated as an investigator-driven study in 2002, but from the 
time GSK took over sponsorship, this study was performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practices. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

interaction and special population studies is not considered feasible for GSK2696273. However, a range 
of clinically relevant doses were evaluated in the clinical studies and exploratory analyses of dose

correlations with treatment outcomes were conducted. Potential metabolic differences based on age, 
gender, or race were not assessed in dedicated studies or in the pivotal population but adverse events 
for these identifiable factors were collected and are described for the integrated safety population. The 
following parameters were monitored in the clinical studies of GSK2696273, with respect to 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  in accordance with the 2012 EMA Guidance on “Quality, 
Non-clinical and Clinical Aspects of Medicinal Products Containing Genetically Modified Cells” 
(EMA/CAT/GTWP/671639/2008):

The percentage of gene modified cells in various cell lineages in the bone marrow and 
peripheral blood over 8 years of follow up after gene-therapy.  
  Distribution of gene modified cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood over 8 years of follow 
up after gene therapy.  
 
In the pivotal study AD1115611, a long-term safety monitoring plan was implemented that 
included evaluation of RCR from bone marrow and peripheral blood samples archived during 
the 3 year follow up.  
  Retroviral insertions site (RIS) analysis was conducted on 14 subjects during the Long term 
follow up (LTFU).  
 
The presence of the ADA transgene measuring ADA activity 
  Modification of the systemic metabolic defect was analysed by measuring levels of purine 
metabolites (dAXP) in bone marrow and peripheral blood.  
 
Functional endpoints indicative of reconstitution of immune function following gene therapy. 
No immunogenicity testing has been conducted. The applicant stated that GSK2696273 is comprised 
predominately of autologous-derived cells with intracellular ADA, in which an immunogenic response of 
any sort would be unlikely. Indirect evidence that there is no harmful reaction to the ADA-expressing 
cells has been observed in the GSK2696273 programme, including persistence of gene corrected cells, 
long-term ADA expression, and effective detoxification. While infectious vector particles could 
potentially remain in the drug product after transduction of patient CD34+ cells, these biodistribution 
studies have not show any evidence of transduction of non-target cells nor was vector DNA detected in 
the absence of donor cells. In the pivotal clinical study, all testing for replication competent 
recombinant retrovirus (RCR) in bone marrow and peripheral blood was negative. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
GSK2696273 consists of an autologous CD34+ enriched cell fraction that contains CD34+ cells 
transduced with retroviral vector that encodes for the human adenosine deaminase complementary 
DNA sequence. It is intended to be administered on a single occasion since after infusion CD34+ cells 
migrate to the bone marrow where they engraft and give rise to cells that repopulate the 
haematopoietic system and act as a source of circulating blood cells producing pharmacologically active 
levels of intracellular ADA enzyme. Following successful engraftment in the patient, the effects of the 
product are intended to be life-long. The progeny of the engrafted bone marrow cells would be 
expected to become part of the transient population in all tissues and/or contribute to resident 
haematopoietic cells in specific tissues (i.e., lymphoid tissues, spleen, lymph nodes, mucosa-associated 
lymphoid tissue, thymus, Kupffer cells in liver, alveolar macrophages and microglia in the central 
nervous system). However, there is no expectation that GSK2696273 itself would cross the blood brain 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 32/95 
 
 
 
 
 
barrier or glomerulus or be exposed to the liver cytochrome family of enzymes. The lifespan of this 
bone marrow cell pool is not determined but is assumed to be long-lived, as circulating ADA-transgene 
expressing blood cells continue to be produced long-term. The ADA protein expression occurs in 
transduced cells and is not expected to be found in extracellular spaces. Elimination of ADA-expressing 
cells in the circulation is expected to be via the same mechanism as their non-transduced counterparts. 
Hence, the primary mechanism of action of GSK2696273 is via genetic modification of cells and 
restoration of production/activity of ADA. However, the presence of unmodified cells in the product is 
necessary to support broad hematopoietic system reconstitution after gene therapy. The mechanism of 
action of GSK2696273 gene therapy was evaluated by means of measuring engraftment of gene 
modified cells per VCN in bone marrow and peripheral blood cells (erythroid, granulocyte, and 
lymphocyte lineages), ADA activity in bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes, and correction 
of the systemic metabolic defect as measured by dAXP levels in RBCs from bone marrow and 
peripheral blood. The results of these evaluations were studied in both the pivotal population and the 
integrated population, as discussed in the section on Clinical efficacy. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Presence of gene modified cells 
During the development of GSK2696273, viral copy number (VCN) has been used to track the 
prevalence of gene marked cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow following gene therapy using a 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to assess genomic DNA for vector 
specific sequences relative to a human housekeeping gene. VCN data is commonly reported as percent 
gene modified cells. The assay reveals a ratio of the number of copies of vector relative to the number 
of copies of the housekeeping gene. As some cells in the population are transduced with multiple 
copies of vector, the translation may represent an overestimate of the actual percent gene modified 
cells. VCN analysis has been applied to CD34+ bone marrow cell fractions that make up the 
GSK2696273 product, making it possible to study the extent to which gene modified stem cells divide 
normally and give rise to the various cell lines detectable in peripheral blood. 
The analysis provided is therefore a measure of percent genetically modified cells, mainly peripheral 
blood granulocytes, as an example of a cell lineage that is not normally impacted by ADA-SCID, and 
several lymphocyte populations that are profoundly negatively impacted by ADA-SCID. In both the 
Pivotal and the Integrated populations, median CD15+ granulocyte proportions of gene marked cells in 
peripheral blood were typically >0.5% up to approximately 4.5% during follow-up, see table below.

Summary Statistics of Log-Transformed Genetically Modified CD3+ and CD15+ Cells in Peripheral 
Venous Whole Blood (Pivotal and Integrated Populations) 
Following the gene therapy, gene modified cells appeared in the circulation quickly (6 months), and the 
numbers remained stable for the duration of >5 years. As granulocytes are short-lived and do not have 
a survival advantage following gene transduction, the percentage of gene marked CD15+ granulocyte 
is a surrogate marker of the proportion of gene modified stem cells in bone marrow. The proportion of 
gene modified CD34+ cells in bone marrow is consistent with the results for CD15+ cells in peripheral 
blood. Bone marrow stem cells carrying the ADA transgene were able to support lymphocyte 
development in the periphery. In both, the pivotal and integrated populations, gene marking in CD34+ 
T cells was approximately 70% or higher from Year 1 and onwards of follow-up, see table above. This 
high level of gene marking compared with other lineages is explained by the selective advantage in 
lymphocytes for ADA expressing cells. The data show there was no loss of gene marking in engrafted 
bone marrow and peripheral cells over 8 years of follow-up after receiving GSK2696273 treatment. 
Similarly to granulocytes, a relatively low proportion of gene modified cells was shown in the erythroid 
lineage, consistent with lack of survival advantage for this blood lineage. This is relevant because ADA 
activity in RBCs is a commonly used marker for disease severity, but is less informative for subjects 
who have received gene therapy for which the treatment effect is more derived from lymphocyte ADA 
expression. 
An exploratory responder analysis was conducted to determine the proportion of subjects at each time 
point with bone marrow engraftment and peripheral circulation of gene modified cells. The definition of 
a responder was developed based on previous experience with other gene therapy studies in the 
literature. Both of the following criteria had to be met to be considered a responder: 
 
Presence of ≥0.1% gene marked cells in bone marrow for both CD15+ granulocytes and 
erythroid cells (assessed by glycophorin A) and at least one of the CD3+ T cell, CD19+ B cell, 
or CD56+ NK subsets; and 
 
Presence of ≥10% gene marked cells in peripheral blood CD3+ T cells and CD19+ B cells.

At Year 1, among subjects with available data in the pivotal population, most were VCN responders: 9 
of 11 subjects (82%) met response criteria, 2 subjects (18%) did not. This trend continued throughout 
follow-up to Year 8, with 82% to 100% of subjects considered responders at each time point. The 
pivotal population data were supported by results in the integrated population. Among subjects with 
available data in the integrated population, most were responders at Year 1: 11 of 15 subjects (73%). 
Similar to the pivotal population, this trend continued throughout follow-up to Year 8, with 79% to 
100% of subjects per time point considered as responders. 
Lymphocyte ADA Activity 
In the pivotal population, lymphocyte ADA activity by Year 1 showed increased levels relative to 
baseline, which were maintained for the duration of follow-up to Year 8 ADA activity was similar in the 
integrated population. All subjects treated in the pivotal study (AD1115611) and the compassionate 
use programme (CUP) (AD1117064) were receiving PEG-ADA prior to gene therapy. Per protocol, PEG-
ADA was discontinued approximately 2 to 3 weeks prior to gene therapy. Possible carryover effects of 
PEG-ADA exposure on early ADA activity were anticipated. Intracellular lymphocyte ADA activity was 
low at baseline, consistent with the disease. Following gene therapy, there was a marked increase in 
ADA activity in lymphocytes that was maintained for the duration of follow-up. The same pattern of 
activity was shown for the integrated population. Minor levels of ADA activity were evident in other cell 
lineages, e.g. erythrocytes. 
An exploratory responder analysis was conducted to determine the proportion of subjects at each time 
point with lymphocyte ADA activity ≥210 nmol/h/mg. This value represents 10% of the mean value for 
healthy subjects and is considered clinically relevant as it is a threshold for minimum normal activity 
and corresponds to a minimum ADA activity level reported to result in normal function in the literature. 
From Year 2 onwards, the majority of subjects with available data in the pivotal population were ADA 
responders: 5 of 9 subjects (56%) met response criteria in Year 2. This trend was maintained in 
follow-up to Year 8, with 75% to 100% of subjects considered responders at all time points except 
Year 4, which included data for only 5 subjects among whom 1 (20%) was a responder. The pivotal 
population data were supported by results in the integrated population (see table below). Among 
subjects with available data in the integrated population, most were ADA responders from Year 2 
onwards: 8 of 12 subjects (67%) met response criteria at Year 2. Similar to the Pivotal population, this 
trend was maintained throughout follow-up to Year 8, with 67% to 100% of subjects per time point 
considered as responders at each time point except Year 4, for which only 6 subjects had available 
data among whom 2 (33%) were responders.

Of note, all patients in the pivotal study and CUP had received PEG–ADA prior to gene therapy and 
therefore some carryover would be expected. Although ADA activity appears to be evident from year 2, 
it is not entirely clear what the cause of poor response is in Year 4 where only 1/5 (20%) of patients 
was classed as a responder. It is also not clear whether there were any clinical consequences as a 
result of the poor response seen in Year 4. However, the applicant also highlighted the arbitrary nature 
of the responder level for lymphocyte ADA, which was established in the literature. Nevertheless, these 
Year 4 non-responders became responders in Year 5, showed adequate metabolic detoxification and 
were considered treatment successes, remaining clinically well, which is reassuring. Importantly, no 
significant clinical consequences with respect to severe infections were noted. 
Purine Metabolites 
Modification of the systemic metabolic defect was analysed by measuring levels of purine metabolites 
in bone marrow and peripheral blood, where levels of dAXP in RBCs were correlated with severity of 
disease. Adequate systemic metabolic detoxification was classified as levels of purine metabolites 
(dAXP=dAMP+dADP+dATP) in RBC <100 nmol/mL. Typically, most patients with ADA-SCID have RBC 
levels of dAXP >350 nmol/mL, whereas most patients with delayed, late-onset, or partial phenotypes 
have RBC levels of dAXP <300 nmol/mL. Patients with ADA-SCID who have received a SCT or gene 
therapy have been reported as having dATP levels <100 nmol/mL. Levels of dAXP were measured in 
RBCs from bone marrow and peripheral blood. Analysis of the pivotal and integrated populations 
showed no appreciable reduction in dAXP levels in RBCs from bone marrow or peripheral venous blood 
for up to 3 months following gene therapy, presumably due to low baseline values that may have 
resulted from carryover effect of prior PEG-ADA use (discontinued per protocol approximately 2 to 3 
weeks prior to gene therapy) as well as the low number of mature cells in the periphery that arose 
from gene-modified stem cells. Post-baseline mean and median dAXP were below pathological levels 
(100 nmol/mL) and this trend was maintained for the duration of follow-up, see table below. All 
available data are shown for dAXP levels in bone marrow-derived RBCs, and do not indicate decrease 
from baseline. These data show restored adenosine and adenosine metabolite clearance, evidenced in 
peripheral RBCs, by 6 months post-gene therapy.

Summary Statistics for Log-Transformed dAXP Levels in RBCs (Pivotal and Integrated Populations) 
A responder analysis was conducted at each time point to determine the proportion of subjects who 
had adequate systemic metabolite detoxification, assessed as dAXP levels in peripheral blood RBCs. 
Correction of the systemic metabolic defect of ADA deficiency was demonstrated by analysis of bone 
marrow from Year 2 onwards in the Pivotal Population, with 100% of subjects considered as 
responders at Year 2 onwards, see table below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 37/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Responder Analysis of Log-Transformed dAXP Levels in RBCs (Pivotal and Integrated Populations) 
As with ADA activity, modification of the systemic metabolic defect is evident from year 2 with 100% 
response. Although no value is available for bone marrow, the value at Year 4 for peripheral blood still 
shows 100% response in contrast to the ADA activity which was noted in only  20%. This inconsistency 
was clarified by the applicant who highlighted the fact that the cut-off values for responder analysis for 
metabolic detoxification and ADA were based on the clinical literature, as well as the fact that the non-
responders with respect to lymphocyte ADA did show ADA levels close to the response threshold and 
did become responders at Year 5 as well as showing clinical response. A comparison of the Year 4 ADA 
enzyme activity to the corresponding dAXP levels, appears to suggest that ADA enzyme activity at Year 
4 point may be sufficient for metabolic detoxification, as the ADA responder subjects and all of the ADA 
enzyme non-responders showed adequate metabolic detoxification based on the dAXP levels.       
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No dedicated PK-PD studies have been conducted because the conventional clinical pharmacology 
programme including dose escalation/dose range finding, human absorption, metabolism and 
excretion, drug-drug interaction and special population studies is not considered feasible for the gene 
therapy product GSK2696273. However, a range of clinically relevant doses were evaluated in the 
clinical studies, and exploratory analyses of correlations of dose with treatment outcomes were 
conducted. This is considered appropriate in the circumstance for this particular class of product. 
Various parameters relating to pharmacology of the product were monitored in the clinical studies of 
GSK2696273, with respect to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This is considered to be in 
accordance with the 2012 EMA Guidance on “Quality, Non-clinical and Clinical Aspects of Medicinal 
Products Containing Genetically Modified Cells” [EMA/CAT/GTWP/671639/2008]. The parameters 
chosen by the applicant appear to be both appropriate and consistent with the above guideline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 38/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, the parameters studied to evaluate the mechanism of action of the product would appear to 
be consistent with each other and provide evidence of engraftment of genetically modified cells, 
production of the deficient enzyme to therapeutic levels as well as showing functionality of the enzyme 
by the modification of the systemic metabolic defect by achieving below toxic levels of the purine 
metabolites, which was a key secondary efficacy endpoint. Regarding the presence of genetically 
modified cells in the bone marrow compartment, it is noted that despite the low number of CD34-
transduced cells, the proportion of genetically modified lymphocytes is very high, both in bone marrow 
and peripheral blood. Indirectly, the high proportion of CD3+ T lymphocytes carrying the transgene 
points to local expansion of this population outside the thymus. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CAT considered the clinical pharmacology development programme to be adequate for this type of 
an advance therapy medicinal product. All outstanding issues raised during the procedure have been 
satisfactorily resolved.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the clinical pharmacology as 
described above. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose ranging studies were conducted in the clinical development of GSK2696273. The 
recommended dose of this product is 2 to 20x106 CD34+ cells/kg, which is based on the paediatric 
haematopoietic transplant clinical recovery data. The lower dose limit is considered appropriate as it is 
supported by literature data. The recommended dose is furthermore supported by data from one 
subject who received <2x106 CD34+ cells/kg and had an unsuccessful response to the gene therapy. 
The maximum dose was essentially defined by practical limitations of bone marrow harvesting and the 
manufacturing process.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Title of the pivotal study AD1115611: Open-label, prospective, sequential study in children with 
SCID due to ADA deficiency who lacked a healthy HLA-identical sibling. 
The Committee noted that the applicant mentioned that they acquired management of the programme 
of the pivotal study in 2010 and has not been able to demonstrate full GCP compliance for all elements 
of pilot studies 1 and 2. Consequently, in agreement with the regulatory feedback obtained during the 
pre-MAA meeting (July 2014), the efficacy conclusions are drawn from the 12 subjects (Pivotal 
population) treated within the AD1115611 pivotal study (including their LTFU data). 
The efficacy data presented in the dossier are different from the data presented in the CSR for 
AD1115611. In the dossier, but not in the CSR, data are censored from subjects who received ≥3 
continuous months of PEG-ADA or allogeneic SCT occurring post- GSK2696273 gene therapy. This 
decision was made following the review of the CSR, to allow differentiation of any treatment effect 
from the effects of the interventional treatment, and the data are considered more meaningful than the 
analyses presented in the CSR. It should be noted that, with the exception of survival data, all efficacy 
data from the integrated 18 subjects have been included in the summary of clinical efficacy of the 
submitted dossier as supportive data only. In addition, the integrated population of all 18 subjects was 
used for the primary endpoint of survival. The Committee agrees with the view that analysis of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 39/95 
 
 
 
 
 
censored data would be more clinically meaningful since early trials in gene therapy were confounded 
by the concomitant use of PEG-ADA. The Committee also considers censoring of the data as 
appropriate. The applicant has chosen to present data for both the pivotal as well as the integrated 
population for this analysis. Available efficacy data for subjects treated with GSK2696273 are reported 
for the pivotal population (N=12) and the integrated population (N=18): 
  Pivotal population: included subject data from 0-3 years and LTFU, for only the 12 subjects 
originally treated within the pivotal study (AD1115611). The Pivotal population is the primary 
population for efficacy analysis in the summary of clinical efficacy. 
 
Integrated population: included subject data from 0-3 years and LTFU for subjects originally 
treated in the pivotal study (AD1115611), Pilot Study 2 (AD1117056), Pilot Study 1 
(AD1117054; survival data only), and the CUP (AD1117064).  
Methods 
Study Participants  
Subjects aged <18 years suffering from SCID with ADA deficiency, as assessed by ADA enzymatic 
activity and/or genetic analysis, and for whom an HLA-identical healthy sibling was not available as 
suitable bone marrow donor, were enrolled. In addition, subjects had to fulfil at least 1 of the following 
criteria: 
  Subjects who had received enzyme replacement therapy (PEG-ADA) for at least 6 months 
before enrolment and displayed at least 2 of the following immune parameter alterations: 
  Absolute lymphopenia (<1500 cells/L) 
  Absolute T lymphopenia (<1000 cells/L) 
  Requirement for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion 
  Deficit of serum immunoglobulins (IgM or IgA or subclasses of IgG) or lack of antibody 
response to vaccination 
  Subjects who had received enzyme replacement therapy (PEG-ADA), and in whom the drug 
had been discontinued due to intolerance, allergy, or autoimmune manifestations 
  Subjects for whom enzyme replacement therapy (PEG-ADA) was not a life-long therapeutic 
option (e.g., from countries in which the drug is not available) 
Treatments 
Pre-Treatment 
Stem cell back-up: at least 3 weeks before gene therapy, subjects underwent bone marrow harvest, to 
collect stem/progenitor cells as rescue therapy available for future infusion. 
In case of the availability of stem cells from different sources (bone marrow or umbilical cord blood, or 
Mobilised peripheral blood) collected before subject enrolment, these may have been considered a 
valid back-up. The back-up was to contain at least 1 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg and was frozen and stored 
un-manipulated in liquid nitrogen. The back-up was to be used in case of transplant failure or 
prolonged bone marrow aplasia.

Treatment 
The medicinal product consisted of autologous stem/progenitor cells transduced ex vivo with the 
GIADAl retroviral vector encoding ADA cDNA. Enrolled subjects were hospitalised during the treatment 
phase in the Paediatric Clinical Research Unit HSR-TIGET. (For clarification, 1 subject in the pilot study 
was treated at Hadassah University [Jerusalem, Israel; this subject was invited to be enrolled into the 
long-term safety follow-up phase as part of Protocol Amendment No. 5). In the treatment phase 4 
steps were planned: 
1. Harvest of bone marrow: Bone marrow collection of 20–25 mL/kg subject weight was usually 
expected to give the optimal target of CD34+ cell count before manipulation (10–20 x 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg) to achieve an optimal dose of 5–10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. A minimum amount of bone 
marrow CD34+ cells (3–4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) was recommended to reach a minimum dose of 2 x 
106 CD34+ cells/kg. On the other hand, in order not to exceed the highest recommended reinfusion 
dose of 20 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, less than 30–40 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg were to be collected. 
Haemoglobin values <7.0 g/dL were corrected by irradiated and filtered RBC transfusion. 
2. Cell manipulation and gene transfer 
3. Busulfan conditioning: The conditioning with i.v. busulfan was at non-myeloablative doses, 
scheduled at 2 mg/kg/day (divided into 4 doses of 0.5 mg/kg each) on Days -3 and -2 (total final dose 
4 mg/kg). If the administration of i.v. busulfan was not possible (e.g., occlusion of the CVC), busulfan 
was to be administered orally (4 doses of 0.6 mg/kg).  
4. Infusion: The final medicinal product consisted of a cell suspension at the concentration of 4–10 x 
106/mL, in a sterile syringe of the suitable volume. The exact dose of CD34+ cells/kg received by each 
subject was dependent upon the number of CD34+ cells available following bone marrow extraction, 
their growth during the manufacturing process, and the % CD34+ cells present at the end of the 
transduction procedure.  
A treatment administration flow-chart is presented in the figure below.

Objectives 
 
Evaluation of the safety and the clinical efficacy of gene therapy, in the absence of enzyme 
replacement therapy. 
 
Evaluation of biological activity (engraftment, ADA expression) of ADA-transducedCD34+ cells 
and their haematopoietic progeny.

 
 
Evaluation of immunological reconstitution and purine metabolism after gene therapy. 
Evaluate the change in quality of life over time in ADA-SCID subjects following treatment with 
GSK2696273. This objective applied to the long-term follow-up (4 to 8 years after gene 
therapy) only; therefore, these results are not presented. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Survival at 3 years post-gene therapy. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints (in hierarchical order): 
Key endpoints 
  Change in the rate of severe infections (defined as infections requiring hospitalisation or 
prolonging hospitalisation). 
  One-year change in T-lymphocyte counts (cells/L). 
  One-year modification of the "systemic" metabolic defect, analysed by levels of purine 
metabolites in RBC. 
Other endpoints 
  One-year change in the proliferative response to polyclonal stimuli. 
  One-year change in thymic activity (T-cell receptor excision circles; TREC). 
 
Presence of genetically modified cells in the bone marrow compartment and presence of ≥10% 
genetically modified cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes. 
 
Lymphocyte ADA enzyme activity. 
  One-year change in lymphocyte counts (cells/L). 
  Recovery of physical growth. 
  Need for reintroduction of PEG-ADA (in subjects previously treated with PEGADA). 
  Antibody response to vaccination. 
The first 3 secondary endpoints listed in hierarchical/descending order of clinical importance were 
considered key secondary endpoints. Supplementary endpoints associated with the 2nd and 3rd key 
secondary endpoints (T-lymphocyte counts and modification of “systemic” metabolic defect) were also 
analysed for the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Per Protocol (PP) Populations. The primary endpoint of 
survival and the secondary endpoints are appropriate for this population of patients and have been 
agreed with the CAT/CHMP who recommended changing the original proposed primary endpoint of 
evaluating survival by death due to disease to death from any cause. The CAT/CHMP also 
recommended that all secondary efficacy endpoints that were to be assessed at 1 year were extended 
to 3 years. Therefore, all efficacy endpoints were evaluated at 1, 2 and 3 years. 
Sample size 
It was planned to treat at least 10 and at most 14 subjects. According to Protocol Amendment 4 and 
following consultation with the CAT/CHMP, the primary efficacy endpoint was defined to be survival at 
3 years. Assuming a 50% reference survival at 3 years for matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant 
of bone marrow (H. Gaspar from European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation meeting 2008, 
personal communication), which corresponds to a constant hazard rate (λ) of 0.231, a sample size of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 42/95 
 
 
 
 
 
12 subjects provides approximately 90% power to detect a 35% advantage (i.e., 85% survival, or 
α=0.054) in survival on gene therapy with GSK2696273. Simulation studies were performed to 
estimate the sample size assuming an exponential model with uniform censoring process in (1, 7.3 
years), one-sample Log-Rank test was used with one-sided type I error, α =0.05, to compare survival 
of the study subjects under the null hypothesis (H0: λ =0.231) versus alternate hypothesis (H1: λ 
<0.054) with the reference survival. Since no fatal events were observed in the study, the Log Rank 
test was not applied for any further analyses. Early stopping statistical rules were defined to monitor 
the accumulating evidence to evaluate whether the effect of gene therapy was likely to be inferior to 
the lower boundary of the reference treatment, in which case the study was to be stopped. Since no 
subjects died during the 3 years of follow-up after gene therapy and the study continued to the end as 
planned, no further discussion or analysis is presented. 
Randomisation 
This was an open-label, single-arm study; therefore, no randomisation procedure was used. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label trial.  
Statistical methods 
The ITT Population included all subjects who were treated with gene therapy and had at least 1 post-
therapy evaluation during the 0–3 year follow-up. Data collected after the 3- year visit were excluded 
from the analysis. The ITT Population was the primary efficacy analysis population. The PP Population 
included all subjects in the ITT Population who did not violate the protocol. The following deviations 
were considered major protocol violations: 
  Any subject who needed the reintroduction of PEG-ADA. 
  Any subject taking chronic steroids or major immunosuppressants (>3 months). 
  Any subject who underwent allogenic BMT. 
Depending upon when the protocol violation occurred, subject data prior to the violation were included 
in the PP analysis, but any data after that time point or visit were censored or excluded from the PP 
analysis. Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint (survival at 3 years), and first 3 secondary efficacy 
endpoints (rate of severe infections, T-lymphocyte counts and purine metabolites in RBC) were 
repeated for the PP Population. Although all secondary endpoints were listed in hierarchical order of 
clinical importance, the first 3 secondary efficacy endpoints (rate of severe infections, T-lymphocyte 
counts and modification of “systemic” metabolic defect) were considered key secondary endpoints for 
the evaluation of efficacy in this study. Therefore, both ITT analysis and PP analysis were performed 
for the primary endpoint and the 3 key secondary endpoints to assess consistency of results from the 2 
analyses and to evaluate the impact of protocol violations, if any. Supplementary endpoints associated 
with key secondary endpoints, T-lymphocyte counts and modification of “systemic” metabolic defect, 
were also analysed for both ITT and PP populations. No analysis on the PP Population was performed 
for the other secondary endpoints. The ITT Population was the analysis population for clinical safety 
evaluation. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Twelve subjects were enrolled in the study. One subject  took part in the baseline/screening phase 
twice and was not treated on the first occasion due to contamination of the drug product. The duration 
Assessment report

of the Pre-Treatment Phase was on average 5.7 months (range: 10 days to 1.1 years). All subjects 
completed Year 1 assessments, 1 subject was withdrawn at 2.3 years, and all 11 remaining subjects 
completed Year 3 assessments. Subject disposition is summarised in table below. 
Summary of Subject Disposition (ITT Population) 
One subject required PEG-ADA reintroduction and corticosteroid therapy approximately 5 months after 
gene therapy due to SAEs of neutropenia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. This subject was 
withdrawn from the study approximately 2.3 years after gene therapy and is not a participant in long-
term follow-up. The primary reason for withdrawal was recorded as investigator discretion: the subject 
was a candidate for allogeneic transplant and was moved to another clinical centre. This subject 
received a sibling-matched BMT from a relative that had not been available at the time of gene therapy 
treatment. 
Recruitment 
The pivotal study (AD1115611) was an open-label, prospective, single-center phase 1/2 study 
conducted at the HSR-TIGET in Milan, Italy. In this study, 12 subjects  were enrolled starting in June 
2002 to July 2011, then followed for 3 years post-treatment. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol, dated 26-Apr-2000, was amended 7 times. Amendments 1 to 4 were 
implemented before the transfer of sponsorship to GSK. Amendments 1 and 2 were produced before 
the start of the study; other amendments were implemented during the study. Key changes are 
summarised in the table below.  
Assessment report

Summary of Protocol Amendments for Study AD1115611 
The protocol amendments appear to be clear and although there have been a number of revisions to 
the protocol during 2001 and 2012, the changes are not deemed to significantly impact on the study 
outcomes. 
Baseline data 
In the pivotal population, the mean age at the time of gene therapy was 2.38 years and the median 
age was 1.7 years (range: 0.5 to 6.1 years). The approximate age of subjects at the time of ADA-SCID 
diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 1.25 years. Most subjects were white and 58% were male. The 
median subject age at the time of gene therapy for all subjects in the integrated population was 1.7 
years (range: 0.5 months to 6.1 years). The approximate age at the time of ADA-SCID diagnosis for

subjects across all studies and the CUP ranged from <1 month to 1.25 years. Most subjects across all 
studies were White and 61% were male, see table below. 
Summary of demographic characteristics at baseline/date of gene therapy 
The clinical program enrolled an international population, with subjects from the EU, Middle East, 
Africa, North America and South America.  
Numbers analysed 
Available data for subjects treated with GSK2696273 are reported for the pivotal population (N=12) 
and the integrated population (N=18). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Survival: Survival was the primary efficacy endpoint in the pivotal study (AD1115611). A 100% 
survival rate has been observed for all subjects (N=18) who received GSK2696273 treatment in the 
pivotal and supportive studies and the CUP, with a median follow-up time of approximately 7 years. 
This survival rate exceeds the most recent published historical comparative rate of 67% overall 
survival observed in 15 patients who received a MUD hematopoietic SCT after a median of 6.5 years of 
follow-up (cited for all SCT recipients regardless of donor source). The majority of deaths reported in 
the historical comparison by Hassan et al occurred within the first 100 days post-SCT and were due to 
transplant related complications such as graft versus host disease or severe infections [Hassan, 2012]. 
Survival also exceeds the 86% and 83% rate for recipients of HLA-matched sibling (N=42) and family 
(N=12) donor SCT, respectively, in the Hassan report. 
Intervention-Free Survival: Intervention-free survival was defined as survival without post-gene 
therapy PEG-ADA use for a continuous period of ≥3 months, SCT, or death. No deaths have occurred 
in any study. Intervention-free survival represents a sensitivity analysis of the overall survival rate. 
Within the Pivotal population, 1 subject required PEG-ADA post-gene therapy. Two additional subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 46/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from supportive studies (on in pilot study 2, on in CUP) required continuous PEG-ADA post-gene 
therapy. The summary of intervention-free survival is presented in the table below. 
Summary of intervention-free survival (pivotal and integrated populations) 
Two subjects each received a post-gene therapy HLA-matched sibling donor SCT (one subject in 
pivotal study and one subject in CUP), both of whom had started continuous PEG-ADA prior to 
withdrawing from their respective study to receive a SCT. The 92% and 82% intervention-free survival 
rates in the pivotal and integrated populations, respectively, compare favourably with the 67% overall 
survival rate following MUD SCT in the historical reference [Hassan, 2012]. Comprehensive reference 
data on intervention-free survival following SCT are not available; however, the 67% overall survival 
percentage includes one subject (7%) who required a second transplant [Hassan, 2012]. In addition, 
Hassan et al reported 52% overall survival among 52 children who received transplants from donor 
sources other than matched siblings or family members (i.e., the proposed indicated population for 
GSK2696273). Nine of these patients went on to receive at least one additional transplant, indicating 
that less than half of subjects receiving non-sibling/family matched SCT survived the transplant 
procedure without the need for additional intervention. However, Hassan et al did not report on 
patients (if any) who required reintroduction of PEG-ADA in addition to repeat transplantation. 
The primary endpoint in this study both in the pivotal population and the integrated population appears 
to show 100% survival as there were no deaths. However, it should be noted that the integrated 
population included those patients who were considered to have failed gene therapy and therefore 
required PEG-ADA for > 3 months and/or HSCT. This situation is similar to the earlier gene therapy 
trials in ADA SCID which were confounded by the concomitant use of PEG-ADA. Accordingly, 
intervention-free survival would therefore be a more clinically meaningful endpoint, which the applicant 
has additionally analysed in the summary of clinical efficacy as this has not been done in the individual 
CSRs. The intervention free survival in the pivotal trial appears to be 92% (11/12). However, the 
applicant excluded from the analysis patients who required PEG ADA for >3 months. The applicant 
justified this with the fact that a conservative safety approach was taken when the patient suffered 
from autoimmune hepatitis and accordingly, the ERT was started until further data were available 
which showed adequate detoxification when ERT was stopped. 
Although not included in the analysis because of the data cut-off date, another patient received PEG-
ADA after gene therapy, bringing the total number of patients to 5/20 (25%) who needed to restart 
PEG-ADA after gene therapy, which appears to be remarkably similar to published figures in the recent 
literature. Accordingly, the observed figures of 92% (11/12) in the pivotal trial and 83% (14/17) in the 
integrated population would appear to be optimistic. It is acknowledged that survival was the main 
primary endpoint and intervention-free survival was carried out as a sensitivity analysis. Nevertheless, 
at this stage it is not possible to predict which patients will respond to gene therapy and further long 
term follow up in the registry is considered necessary before firm conclusions can be drawn. It should 
be noted that initial trials in gene therapy were confounded due to concomitant administration of PEG-

ADA and therefore it is important to ascertain responders to gene therapy. The applicant will evaluate 
intervention-free survival in the registry, as requested by the CAT/CHMP. 
Due to these assumptions, the applicant provided an update on the results of intervention free survival 
during the evaluation procedure, see table below.  A 100% survival rate continues to be observed for 
all subjects (N=21) who received GSK2696273 treatment. This includes the 18 subjects included in the 
MAA and 3 new subjects treated in a Named Patient Program (NPP) since the clinical cut-off for the 
MAA. The data presented in the below table is based on follow up data obtained in February 2016. 
Rate of intervention-free survival data (including 95% CI) for all treated subjects (Feb 
2016) 
Based on these latest data, 22 patients have been treated with Strimvelis although the duration of the 
follow-up period for the most recently treated patients have been too short to be included in the 
overall assessment. Moreover, the one subject was also excluded since its data come from the pilot 
study 1 for which the available information is limited. This is supported. As a consequence, the 
calculated variable with the data from 19 patients resulted in a rate of intervention-free survival (95% 
CI) of 0.78 (0.52, 0.91). This result is quite similar to that provided at an earlier stage of the 
evaluation procedure for the integrated population, which was 0.81 (0.53, 0.94). However, further 
data will be obtained from the post-approval registry committed to by the applicant. This is considered 
acceptable to the CAT/CHMP. 
Key secondary endpoints 
Severe infections: Change in the rate of severe infections (those that led to hospitalization or 
prolonged hospitalization) at year 3 post-gene therapy was a key secondary efficacy endpoint in the 
pivotal study AD1115611. Infections recorded during the first three months post-gene therapy are not 
included in the analysis because the subjects were hospitalised during most of this time; however, if 
their per protocol hospitalisation period was prolonged due to infection, this was captured in the severe 
infection analysis. Within the pivotal population, the rates of severe infections were reduced post-gene 
therapy when compared with the pre-gene therapy period, see table below. The pre-gene therapy 
infections may have been under-reported as they were collected as part of the patient history and 
screening (including caregiver-recalled infections from birth up to the time of gene therapy) rather

than prospectively reported; however, it is notable that the post-gene therapy severe infection rates 
declined each year following gene therapy.  
Summary of Severe Infections Pre- and Post-Gene Therapy (Pivotal and Integrated Populations) 
The majority of severe infections were reported during the 3-year follow-up period, and the rate 
declined in LTFU from Years 4 to 8. Following gene therapy, the majority of subjects had only one 
occurrence of severe infection, which was a marked reduction from the pre-treatment period in which 
half of the subjects who experienced severe infections had multiple occurrences. 
A total of 15 severe infections were reported after GSK2696273 treatment and most of these infections 
(12/15 events) occurred during the 3-year follow-up, which is not unexpected as immune 
reconstitution occurs over time and because subjects’ central venous catheter (CVCs), which can 
become infected, remained in place long-term during the 0-3 years follow-up period. All severe 
infections were reported as resolved.  The most frequently reported severe infections were device 
related infections (n=5) and gastroenteritis (n=3); the device related infections were expected due to 
long-term placement of CVCs, and gastroenteritis is a common childhood illness. Of note, 2 subjects 
reported Varicella infection and 1 subject had Staphylococcal sepsis. Severe infections were reported 
as SAEs and are discussed in section 3.4. 
There are obvious differences in the pre and post gene therapy figures for severe infections with 
respect to the number of events, person years of observation free from infection, rate of infection and 
number of occurrences per patient. Although the pre-treatment data were retrospectively collected, the 
decrease observed over time can be considered clinically relevant. It is also notable that most of the 
Assessment report

Page 49/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infections appear to be in the first 3 years but decrease from year 4 to year 8 follow up. The majority 
of infections were CVC device related, although infections included gastroenteritis, varicella and 
staphylococcus sepsis. The figures appear to be consistent with gradual immune reconstitution 
following gene therapy. 
Immune Reconstitution: Evidence of immune reconstitution after gene therapy was evaluated by 
changes over time in peripheral lymphocyte counts (T cells, B cells, and NK cells) thymic activity 
(TREC), peripheral T cell function (proliferation in response to proliferative stimuli) diversity in V-beta 
repertoire), and B cell function (assessed indirectly by immunoglobulin production, vaccination 
responses and IVIG use during follow up. The key immune cell types evaluated were: 
  CD3+ T lymphocytes: also referred to as T cells 
  CD3+ CD4+ T cells: includes 
  CD4+ T helper cells: initiate immune responses 
  CD4+ T regulatory cells: regulate immune responses 
  CD4+ CD45RA+ T cells: naïve T helper cells 
  CD3+ CD8+ T cells: cytotoxic T cells 
  CD16+ CD56+ cells: NK 
  CD19+ B lymphocytes: also referred to as B cells 
Lymphocyte counts: Change from baseline in T cell counts was a key secondary efficacy endpoint in 
the pivotal study (AD1115611). Within the pivotal population, lymphocytes in general and CD3+ T cell 
counts in particular were increased compared to baseline, see table below. This clinically relevant 
increase was demonstrated from Year 1 post-treatment and maintained throughout the duration of 
follow-up. In contrast, changes from baseline were variable for CD19+ B cells and CD16+ CD56+ NK 
cells, with counts for both cell types decreasing from baseline to Year 1 and then increasing above the 
Year 1 counts from Year 2 onwards.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 50/95 
 
 
 
 
 
MMRM Analysis of Change from Baseline in Log-Transformed Lymphocytes 
T cell subsets:  Among the T cell subsets evaluated for the pivotal population, there were sustained 
increases from baseline in CD4+ (helper and regulatory) T cells and CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells after 
gene therapy, particularly from year 1 onwards. Results for CD4+ CD45RA+ naïve T cells (mature T 
cells capable of responding to newly encountered pathogens) were similar. Similar findings were 
observed for cell subset analysis in the integrated population. Patients with ADA-SCID have 
pronounced lymphopenia before treatment. After gene therapy there is generally a steady increase 
with respect to CD3+T cell reconstitution which is critical for patient survival but this seems to be 
variable in the case of CD19+ B cells and CD16+ and CD56+ NK cell. Nevertheless, B cell deficiency 
can be managed with immunoglobulin replacement. The T cell subsets also show consistent changes. 
However, immune reconstitution after gene therapy appears to be a relatively slow process when 
compared to SCT. 
Immune cell function 
T Cell function: T cell development and function were demonstrated by means of thymic activity (T cell 
receptor recombination during thymic selection assessed by TREC), V-beta T cell receptor chain usage 
as evidence of diversity in the T cell receptor repertoire, and peripheral T cell proliferation in response 
to polyclonal stimuli. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 51/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thymic Activity: T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) are DNA fragments formed in T cells during the 
T cell receptor generation which occurs during the development of T cells in the thymus. They are non-
replicative; thus, when immune cells divide in response to antigen the TREC do not. For this reason, 
their presence in peripheral blood T cells is a useful marker of thymic activity (i.e., production of newly 
formed naïve CD45RA+ T cells). The contribution of the thymus to immune development in adults has 
historically been unclear; however, an age related decrease in thymus size and activity is expected as 
children approach adolescence and the thymus atrophies. 
T Cell Receptor Repertoire: In the pivotal population, all subjects had evidence of polyclonal V-beta 
chains at one or more time points following gene therapy. There were 8 subjects with evidence of a 
fully normal V-beta repertoire (all individual V-beta chains within the normal range) which remained 
normal during the LTFU and is indicative of a mature T cell compartment. 
Peripheral T cell proliferation: From year 1 onwards the mean and median results in the pivotal 
population were greater than baseline and demonstrated robust proliferation in response to stimulation 
(where at minimum, >20,000 counts per minute (cpm) represents evidence of normal proliferation 
above assay background, typically observed with anti-CD3 stimulation, and values at or exceeding 
100,000 cpm are often observed in response to PHA). All available data from LTFU (Years 5 and 8) are 
shown and indicate sustained robust T cell proliferation; the lower number of subjects with available 
data may have contributed to the wider confidence intervals at these time points. Similar results were 
observed in the integrated population, including increases in proliferation in response to both anti-CD3 
and PHA polyclonal stimuli. 
The TRECs after gene therapy show expected changes with an increase until year 3 followed by gradual 
decline. The T cell receptor repertoire and T cell proliferation are also supportive of immune 
reconstitution. It should be noted that TRECs are significantly higher in children aged 2 months to 3 
years compared with those 3 to 16 years. The thymus in patients with infantile SCID is vestigial but 
able to support T-cell maturation from donor stem cells. Accordingly, thymic function would appear to 
be an important age-related difference for ADA-SCID patients who may present after infancy. 
Furthermore, ADA-deficient patients may have an accelerated decline in thymic function due to the 
systemic toxicity. Furthermore, the main difference across paediatric age groups potentially related to 
the efficacy of the gene product is the decrease in thymic function in older children and adolescents, 
which could possibly lead to reduced efficacy in them. This has implications for the indication which is 
too broad as currently proposed and has been addressed by appropriate warnings in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC, in patients older than 6 years the gene therapy should be reserved for occasions where all other 
treatment options have been exhausted.  
B cell function: Despite B cell counts remaining low after gene therapy (i.e., post-gene therapy B cell 
counts were not consistently increased, and at some time points decreased, from baseline), functional 
immune protection was demonstrated by assessment of immunoglobulin chain diversity, the need for 
IVIG supportive treatment after receiving gene therapy, and vaccine responses. 
Immunoglobulins 
In the pivotal population, baseline IgA levels were low with a mean value of 0.205 g/L. By Year 1, the 
mean IgA level had increased to 0.299 g/L and further increases to mean values above 1.1 g/L were 
observed at Years 6 to 8, which suggest the development of B cells since IgA is not replaced by IVIG. 
This is supported by increases observed in the post-gene therapy mean values of IgM and IgE over 
time. Interpretation of the IgG levels is complicated because subjects were receiving IVIG replacement 
during the initial post-treatment period, as defined by the protocol, and several subjects also received 
additional IVIG infusions for treatment of AEs. Overall, the mean IgG values were stable over time 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 52/95 
 
 
 
 
 
from baseline throughout Year 8, over which time many subjects were discontinuing IVIG infusions. 
Serum immunoglobulin levels of IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgM remained generally stable during LTFU or 
showed small increases from LTFU baseline at Year 3 to Year 4 and onwards demonstrating long-term 
function of B cells in antibody production of all subtypes. Serum immunoglobulin levels in the 
integrated population were supportive of the pivotal population findings. 
Requirement for IVIG therapy 
In the pivotal population, all 12 subjects were receiving IVIG replacement at the time of screening, and 
all received post-gene therapy maintenance IVIG. Seven subjects were able to discontinue IVIG 
replacement during the 0-3 years follow-up. Nine subjects (75%) had discontinued IVIG replacement 
therapy at the time the data cut-off date (8 May 2014). The median time to IVIG discontinuation after 
gene therapy was 3 years 4 months (range: 1 year 3 months to 4 years 10 months). Thus, 
replacement IVIG use declined as follow-up progressed in years 4 to 8 after gene therapy, providing 
evidence for functional B cell and immunoglobulin production in the periphery. When assessed across 
all studies, 12 out of 18 subjects had discontinued IVIG treatment at the time of the data cut-off for 
the MAA and among these subjects, the median time to IVIG discontinuation was 2 years and 2 
months (range 7 months to 4 years 10 months). 
Vaccination Responses 
In the pivotal population, majority of subjects had antibodies to a range of infectious antigens at one 
or more time points after IVIG had been stopped, which is reflective of B cell antibody forming capacity 
after gene therapy. In some of the 9 subjects who discontinued IVIG therapy post-gene therapy, 
detectable antibodies to pertussis, tetanus toxoid, diphtheria, Haemophilus B and hepatitis B surface 
antigen were detected. Antibodies were generally detectable at multiple time points during follow-up, 
and in a number of subjects were continuing from the 0-3 years follow-up, suggesting long-lived 
antibody production. 
Physical growth 
Development of a functional immune system and a decrease in severe infection rates are critical to 
ongoing physical growth. Several subjects had height or weight that transiently fell below the curve at 
individual time points, but the majority either maintained or improved their age-appropriate height and 
weight relative to standard curves. There were exceptions: one subject had severe baseline disease 
and autoimmunity considered as contributing factors to failure to thrive, and another subject was 
below the curve for weight from year 6 through year 8 only. Shifts in growth from above the 5th 
percentile to below this threshold were uncommon. 
Requirement for Post-Gene Therapy PEG-ADA Treatment 
A total of 4 subjects (2 in the pivotal population, and 2 in supportive studies) who received 
GSK2696273 required post-baseline treatment with PEG-ADA. Short-term PEG-ADA was used by 1 
subject in the pivotal population who restarted PEG-ADA approximately 2.1 years after gene therapy 
following an SAE of autoimmune hepatitis. Two further doses of PEG-ADA were administered within the 
same month along with prednisone. This subject recovered and has not needed PEG-ADA after this 
episode. 
Long-term PEG-ADA (exceeding 3 months of continuous duration) was used by 3 subjects (one in 
each, the pivotal population, supportive study, and the CUP, all of whom were considered as having 
had unsuccessful response to gene therapy).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 53/95 
 
 
 
 
 
One subject received two doses of gene therapy that did not follow the recommended dosing and 
preconditioning regimen, which may have contributed to lack of engraftment; the subject remained 
lymphopenic and required introduction of short-term PEG-ADA starting 2.4 years after her first gene 
therapy and before a second dose of gene therapy administered 2.6 years after the first gene therapy. 
Long-term PEG-ADA use began approximately 4.5 years after the first gene therapy and has continued 
in LTFU. 
Another subject had pre-existing chronic haemolytic anaemia requiring corticosteroid treatment prior 
to and during gene therapy, and restarted PEG-ADA approximately 5 months after gene therapy 
following an SAE of autoimmune thrombocytopenia. This subject had poor engraftment and remained 
on PEG-ADA continuously for the duration of follow-up until withdrawal from the study. Additional 
supportive therapy included granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; lenograstim/filgrastim) for 
neutropenia, methylprednisolone, and prednisone. This subject became a candidate for sibling donor 
allogeneic SCT and was moved to another clinical centre after study withdrawal. 
The third subject 17 restarted PEG-ADA 0.34 years after gene therapy. This subject received further 
PEG-ADA intermittently on additional occasions due to poor immune reconstitution, then continuously 
through the end of the 0-3 year follow-up period. This subject became a candidate for sibling donor 
allogeneic SCT after consenting to LTFU participation but prior to the Year 4 visit, and was moved to 
another clinical centre after withdrawal from the study. 
The summary of patients requiring PEG-ADA post gene therapy is summarised in the table below. 
Number and Percent of Subjects Receiving Post-Baseline PEG-ADA (pivotal and integrated populations) 
Subjects with Unsuccessful Response to Gene Therapy 
Lack of response to GSK2696273 treatment is considered to be secondary to poor engraftment of gene 
modified bone marrow cells and the diminished downstream clinical benefit, including immune 
reconstitution and correction of the systemic metabolic defect. Subjects who received GSK2696273 
and then required post-gene therapy PEG-ADA for >3 months continuously or SCT were excluded from 
efficacy analyses upon meeting either criterion and are also considered clinically to have experienced 
unsuccessful response to gene therapy; 3 subjects met these criteria and are summarized in the table 
below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 54/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects with Unsuccessful Response to GSK2696273 Treatment 
A summary of potential reasons for unsuccessful response are shown below: 
  Unsuccessful response to gene therapy possibly related to the low cellularity at the time of 
bone marrow harvest and subsequent low gene therapy dose; 
  Unsuccessful response to gene therapy possibly related to chronic autoimmunity prior to and 
after gene therapy that required long-term immunosuppressive treatment.  
The reason for the unsuccessful outcome in the third subject is not immediately clear, however, 
chronic CMV infection prior to gene therapy and reactivation after gene therapy may have contributed 
to the unsuccessful response to gene therapy. Second and third subjects had received prior PEG-ADA 
therapy before gene therapy.  
However, as ADA is expressed intracellularly, immunogenicity due to pre-existing anti-ADA antibodies 
that might have arisen from pre-gene therapy treatment with PEG-ADA is considered unlikely to have 
contributed to the unsuccessful gene therapy in these subjects. Anti-PEG-ADA antibodies were not 
measured in the GSK2696273 programme. Nevertheless, the effect of inhibitory antibodies with 
respect to treatment failure cannot be entirely excluded in some cases and accordingly, the applicant 
agreed to monitor immunogenicity in the patients who will entered in the registry, as requested by the 
CAT/CHMP. In this respect, antibodies to PEG-ADA will be evaluated initially. However, in those 
patients in whom inhibitory antibodies are detected, immunogenicity with respect to bovine ADA and 
human ADA should, additionally, be evaluated. The applicant also commits to develop an appropriate 
screening, confirmatory and functional assays which have been fully validated for this purpose. 
Ancillary analyses 
Several additional analyses were conducted on data from the pivotal population for B cells and 
lymphocyte lineage cells. On B cells, expression of the two types of immunoglobulin light chains (kappa 
and lambda) was evaluated. The ratio of kappa chain expressing B cells versus lambda chain is 
normally 0.5 to 3.0. Over the course of post-gene therapy follow-up, the mean percentage of CD19+ B 
cells expressing kappa chains ranged from 43% to 64%, and for lambda chains ranged from 19% to 
37%. These values are in line with the expected ratio CD2 expression on T cells, NK cells. A 
subpopulation of B cells was evaluated for subjects in the Pivotal population; these cells were present

at baseline due to prior treatment with PEG-ADA. CD2 expressing cells were initially depleted due to 
preconditioning, increased back to baseline levels between 1.5 to 2 years post-gene restoration of CD2 
expressing immune cell populations after treatment with gene therapy. An exploratory responder 
analysis was conducted to determine the proportion of subjects at each time point who were T cell 
responders (CD3+ CD4+ count >300x106 cells/L and/or CD3+ >1000x106 cells/L) or B cell 
responders (CD19+ count >100x106 cells/L) based on cell counts in whole venous peripheral blood. 
Selection of the cut-off values to define responders was based on criteria reported by Hassan et al in 
patients receiving conventional SCT [Hassan, 2012]. It is difficult to directly compare post-gene 
therapy T cell responder data to the values reported by Hassan et al, as the latter only reported 
immune reconstitution for patients surviving SCT and due to differences in the handling of data for 
subjects who had post-treatment interventions. Interpretation of results for these responder analyses 
is therefore limited, but they are in general supportive of the cell count change from baseline analyses, 
which showed emergence of lymphocytes and significant increases in T cells (including CD4+, CD8+, 
and naïve subsets) starting from year 1 and maintained thereafter. In the pivotal population, at the 6-
month visit there were 0/11 responders, by year 1 between approximately one-quarter and one-third 
of subjects were B cell and T cell responders, and by year 3, 64% of subjects were T cell responders 
and 45% of subjects were B cell responders. From years 4 to 8, proportions of subjects who were B 
cell responders varied (range: 20% to 100%), and the majority of subjects were CD3+ CD4+ T cell 
responders from year 4 onwards (range: 50% to 100%). In the integrated population, at the 6-month 
visit there were 0/16 subjects with available data who were responders, and by year 3 (n=14), 
approximately half of subjects were B cell and T cell responders. By year 5 (n=10), B cell response was 
40%, a level that was generally maintained through year 8. The proportion of CD3+ CD4+ T cell 
responders in year 5 was 80%, and this response level was maintained through year 8. The trend was 
generally reflected in the CD3+ T cell responder analyses from year 5 onwards. By comparison, Hassan 
et al reported immune reconstitution data for 55 of 71 surviving transplant patients (all donor types). 
There were 30% of surviving MUD transplant recipients with data available, who demonstrated T cell 
recovery to cell counts >1000x106/L (i.e., T cell responder) by 6 months post-transplant, with 71% 
considered T cell responders by 3 years post-transplant. These kinetics reflects the time required for 
transplanted T cell precursors to undergo thymic selection and emerge into the periphery as mature T 
cells. In contrast, 60% of surviving recipients of matched sibling donor transplants who had cell count 
data available showed this level of T cell recovery at 6 months, and 79% did at 2 years [Hassan, 
2012], which can be expected due to receipt of closely HLA-matched mature functioning T cells at the 
time of transplant. In the GSK2696273 programme, T cell recovery to this level was slower, occurring 
at least 3 or more years post-gene therapy; however this should be considered in the context of 100% 
overall survival in this population. B cell recovery was assessed by Hassan et al primarily by cell 
function rather than responder analysis. 
Overall, the exploratory responder analysis with respect to immune reconstitution appears to show a 
slower immune recovery after gene therapy compared to SCT (1 year versus 6 months respectively) 
and for levels of response around 80%, the corresponding figures are 3 years versus 2 years. This, 
however, is to be balanced out by the level of transduction and superior survival observed with gene 
therapy.

Long-Term Follow-Up (AD1115611 LTFU): Efficacy assessments in the LTFU component of AD1115611 
included survival, clinical and biochemical evaluations, and evidence of engraftment similar to the 
assessments in the pivotal study. Analysis methods for efficacy endpoints were analogous to those 
utilized in the pivotal study analysis up to 3 years of follow-up, but included comparisons to the 3-year 
time point (considered as the LTFU baseline). Since subjects enrolled in the contributing studies at 
different times, the LTFU study is ongoing as of the timing of the MAA submission with varying length 
of follow-up for subjects. All available efficacy data collected up to and including the year 8 visit at the 
time of the cut-off date (08 May 2014) were included in the integrated summaries of efficacy data and 
are discussed in the individual sections.  
Pilot Study 2 (AD1117056): The study captured data for 2 subjects treated with GSK2696273 in an 
open-label, single-arm study. Details of study administration were not defined a priori. The study 
population included patients with ADA-SCID who lacked an HLA-identical sibling, had received ≥6 
months PEG-ADA treatment (except in cases of PEG-ADA allergy), and had demonstrated failure to 
PEG-ADA therapy. However, neither of the 2 subjects received PEG-ADA before gene therapy because 
it was not available in their country. Post-treatment efficacy assessments consisted of follow-up for 
survival, clinical and biochemical evaluations, and evidence of engraftment. These were defined as 
endpoints post hoc and are similar to the assessments in the pivotal study.  
Pilot Study 1 (AD1117054): GSK2696273 was first administered to humans in 2000 in a pilot clinical 
study with one subject with confirmed ADA-SCID who had no HLA-identical sibling or prior ERT therapy 
received treatment and follow-up at Hadassah University (Jerusalem, Israel), with the cooperation of 
HSRTIGET. The report encompasses 13 years of follow-up after GSK2696273 treatment for this 
subject. Due to data documentation issues this subject contributes only the date of gene therapy for

the integrated efficacy analysis. From year 13 onward, at which time the subject was consented to 
AD1115611 LTFU, additional LTFU data are included for the integrated efficacy analysis.  
Compassionate use program CUP (AD1117064): Compassionate use of gene therapy for ADA-SCID 
was initiated in 2010. Three subjects received GSK2696273, all of whom had baseline medical 
conditions comparable to the enrolment criteria for the pivotal study. Assessments and procedures 
described in the protocol for AD1115611 were followed as stipulated by the approving Ethics 
Committee. Although the programme was not designed with prospectively defined safety and efficacy 
endpoints, GSK retrospectively sought and received ethics approval and patient/caregiver consent to 
use these data for registration.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The ADA-SCID is an ultra-rare disease with an incidence ranging from 0.22 to 0.68 per 100,000 live 
births  or less than 50 paediatric cases in the US and EU combined, which severely limits the possibility 
of large scale randomised clinical trials. All clinical studies in the GSK2696273 programme were non-
randomised, single-arm, open label studies. Therefore, the comparison of interest for efficacy 
endpoints was considered as within-subject, between pre- and post-treatment assessments; the 
exception was the endpoint of survival, which was compared to an historical reference [Hassan, 2012]. 
In view of the rarity of the disease this was considered acceptable to the CAT/CHMP.  
The patient population included in the study is appropriate; the age range of patients varied from 0.5 
to 6.1 years. The primary and secondary endpoints are acceptable with respect to this patient 
population as they incorporated patients who were intolerant to PEG-ADA, refractory to PEG-ADA or 
naïve to PEG-ADA. In the clinical trials, 3 subjects who were not previously treated with PEG-ADA 
received GSK2696273, and 2 additional subjects received GSK2696273 after 2 months or less of being 
treated with PEG-ADA. Four out of these five subjects had a successful response to gene therapy. 
Failure of PEG-ADA treatment was defined by immune parameter alterations such as absolute 
lymphopenia (<1500 cells/µL), absolute T lymphopenia (<1000 cells/µL), and deficits of serum 
immunoglobulins. In the GSK2696273 clinical development programme, 3 subjects had not been 
treated with PEG-ADA before receiving gene therapy; the remaining 15 subjects had prior PEG-ADA 
exposure, ranging from a few weeks to over 5 years. Per protocol, all the latter subjects discontinued 
ERT before treatment, to allow evaluation of the gene therapy alone. The applicant clarified that 
baseline samples were taken when the subjects were still receiving PEG-ADA and indicated a good 
correction of the metabolic defect as measured by erythrocyte dAXP levels. For this reason, PEG-ADA 
was used as rescue therapy in some cases. 
A single centre participated in the study what assures internal validity but the applicability outside the 
Hospital San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy is compromised. The current proposed 
product shelf-life (6 hours) is too short to support shipping to other European clinical centres. The 
study sought to recruit subjects who had largely exhausted other treatment options. The duration of 
the pivotal study over 3 years followed by a long term follow up phase is considered adequate. The 
baseline assessments for each subject were used to evaluate change from baseline for all efficacy 
endpoints for the integrated analyses. Four subjects had received a prior unsuccessful SCT from a 
haplo-identical donor, 2 from the pilot study 2, and 2 from the pivotal study. Fifteen subjects had 
received pre-baseline PEG-ADA therapy; among these, 10 subjects received PEG-ADA at the time of 
the screening visit. PEG-ADA was discontinued approximately 2-3 weeks before gene therapy.

Given the very long history of the development programme which was started in 1990, it is recognised 
that some elements are not consistent with current standards of GCP. In particular, substantial 
supporting study documents for the 2 pilot clinical studies are not available. Furthermore, three of the 
subjects reported in this MAA received treatment under a named patient “compassionate use” 
programme and were not initially part of a clinical trial. The pivotal study protocol, amendments, 
informed consent, and other information that required pre-approval were reviewed and approved by a 
national, regional, or investigational centre ethics committee or institutional review board, in 
accordance with GCP and applicable country-specific requirements. Although there have been a 
number of revisions to the protocol during 2001 and 2012, the changes are not deemed to significantly 
impact on the study outcomes. A routine GCP inspection of the pivotal trial was also requested by the 
CAT/CHMP. The findings noted during the inspection showed that GCP was not fully implemented as a 
quality standard during the academic phase of the study and the documentation of the informed 
consent process regarding patients from other countries was limited. However, the findings do not 
question the reliability and integrity of the overall data generated during the trial. This is therefore 
acceptable to the CAT/CHMP. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint in this study both in the pivotal population and the integrated population appears 
to show 100% survival as there were no deaths. However, it should be noted that the integrated 
population included those patients who were considered to have failed gene therapy and therefore 
required PEG-ADA for > 3 months and/or HSCT. This situation is similar to the earlier gene therapy 
trials in ADA SCID, which were confounded by the concomitant use of PEG-ADA. Accordingly, 
intervention-free survival is therefore a more clinically meaningful endpoint, which the applicant has 
additionally analysed. It is also worth noting that for the purposes of comparison, the 20-year survival 
data for patients receiving PEG ADA was 78%, which is very similar to that of the two mentioned 
populations. However, the follow-up period for the gene therapy was much shorter. The survival rate 
exceeds the most recently published  historical comparative data of 67% in overall survival that was 
observed in 15 patients who received MUD hematopoietic SCT after a median of 6.5 years of follow-up 
(Hassan et al 2012). Intervention free survival in the pivotal trial appears to be 92% (11/12). 
However, the applicant has only excluded patients who required PEG-ADA for >3 months from the 
analysis and it was acknowledged that some other patients received PEG-ADA albeit for less than 3 
months. Hence, the intervention-free survival will be kept under review in the registry, as requested by 
the CAT/CHMP, and the applicant has committed to do this. 
With respect to the key secondary endpoint of severe infections, there are obvious differences in the 
pre- and post-gene therapy figures for severe infections with respect to the number of events, person 
years of observation free from infection, rate of infection and number of occurrences per patient. It is 
also notable that most of the infections appeared in the first 3 years, and they decreased from year 4 
to year 8 of the follow up. The majority of infections were CVC device related, although infections 
included gastroenteritis, varicella and staphylococcus sepsis. The figures appear to be consistent with 
gradual immune reconstitution following gene therapy. 
Patients with ADA-SCID have pronounced lymphopenia before treatment. After gene therapy, there is 
generally a steady increase with respect to CD3+T cell reconstitution which is critical for patient 
survival but this seems to be variable in the case of CD19+ B cells and CD16+ and CD56+ NK cell, 
nevertheless, B cell deficiency can be managed with immunoglobulin replacement. The change from 
baseline in the log-transformed T lymphocytes (CD3+x106/L) showed an adjusted mean ratio of 3.18, 
4.83, 5.95 and 4.74 at years 1, 2, 3 and 4 of follow-up, respectively. In contrast, the change from 
baseline in log-transformed T lymphocytes (CD16+CD56+x106/L) showed an adjusted mean of ratio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 60/95 
 
 
 
 
 
0.57, 1.09, 0.94, and 0.65 in the first four years, and to CD19+ x106/L of 0.28, 0.47, 0.58 and 0.52 at 
time point of 1, 2, 3 and four years, respectively, suggesting lack of response. The T cell subsets also 
showed consistent changes. However, immune reconstitution is a relatively slow process and is 
dependent on the cell type, although it seems to be slower than that observed after SCT.  
With respect to B cell function, the increase in serum IgA would appear to indicate endogenous 
synthesis since IgA is not present in replacement immunoglobulin, which however, complicates 
evaluation of the synthesis of IgG. These changes appear to persist long term, since a substantial 
proportion of the patients discontinued IVIG and showed detectable antibodies to a range of infection 
antigens as well as generating an antibody response to live attenuated vaccination. Modification of the 
systemic metabolic defect, which was also a key secondary endpoint, is evident from year 2 with 100% 
response with persistence of effect. Some supportive data is also provided by growth curves as well as 
quality of life measurements, albeit non-standardised and informal. The applicant acknowledged that 
there is limited experience about recommending the pre-treatment conditioning with busulfan. In the 
frame of the agreed long-term follow up post-authorisation registry, the applicant has committed to 
conduct an exploratory analysis in order to investigate the relationship between busulfan AUC, 
captured at baseline, and clinical outcome (e.g. survival, intervention free survival and lymphocyte 
count differentials). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
From the totality of data it is abundantly clear that there is compelling evidence for efficacy which has 
been conclusively demonstrated in clinical practice, since patients with early and delayed onset of ADA-
SCID rarely survive beyond 1 to 2 years unless immune function is fully restored either with SCT or 
PEG-ADA. With respect to the primary endpoint, both, the pivotal trial population as well as the 
integrated population show superior survival as well as intervention free survival compared to SCT and 
long term PEG-ADA administration. The key secondary endpoints provide additional data which is 
consistent with the increased survival. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
 
The applicant will provide the final study report of the long term follow up study AD1115611 
LTFU as an obligation. In this respect all 18 patients should be followed up for a period of 8 
years, Category 3, RMP 
Recommendation: In addition, the CAT recommended that the applicant works to develop a state of 
the art methodology which can be employed to assess retroviral insertion site clonality in patients 
treated with Strimvelis. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 20 subjects have been treated with GSK2696273 gene therapy. However, 2 subjects (were 
treated with GSK2696273 after the integrated data cut-off (08 May 2014); therefore, exposure and 
disposition data for these 2 subjects are not included in the data displays and analyses. The range of 
doses was 0.90 x 106 to 18.15 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. There were 2 cases of contaminated drug 
product. These resulted in alterations in the timing of GSK2696273 administration in 2 subjects, as 
described below, and adjustments to busulfan dosing in these 2 subjects. At the time of the dossier 
submission, 16 subjects were ongoing in the GSK2696273 clinical development programme.  The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 61/95 
 
 
 
 
 
median duration of follow-up is approximately 7 years. Two subjects have prematurely withdrawn due 
to unsuccessful responses to gene therapy.  
Summary of subject disposition and duration of follow-up (All studies and CUP safety population) 
Summary of exposure to GSK2696273 gene therapy (All studies and CUP safety population) 
The safety population was essentially the same as efficacy population, except that 2 patients started 
treatment after the data cut-off. However, only SAEs have been reported. Although it would be logical 
to consider AEs related to busulphan in the safety assessment, it should be noted that the dose of 
busulphan was significantly less than that used in a myeloablative regimen and therefore, the AEs 
expected may not be entirely consistent with the typical safety profile. It is, however, noted that one 
patient had an unsuccessful response to gene therapy following treatment with and without 
conditioning treatment with busulphan. 
Adverse events 
All 18 subjects in the all studies and CUP safety population, as well as all subjects in the various post-
treatment study phases reported AEs on or after gene therapy, see table below.  AEs were 
predominantly grade 1 and 2. No deaths or fatal events were reported. Fifteen subjects in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 62/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
integrated database had SAEs. None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to 
study treatment; 1 subject had 2 AEs that were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to 
study treatment (hepatic steatosis and white blood cell analysis abnormal).  
Overview of AEs (All studies and CUP safety population) 
In the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities MedDRA System Organ Classes (SOCs), the most 
frequently reported AEs were infections and infestations, investigations, blood and lymphatic system 
disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. For each of these SOCs, the AE density 
(exposure adjusted incidence of events per 100 patient years) was greatest during a phase before 
(pre-treatment phase) or during hospitalization (treatment and 3- month hospitalization phases) 
compared with the AE densities recorded for follow-up phases beginning 3 months post GSK2696273 
gene therapy and later. AEs of interest, including infections, neurological, immune reactions, 
oncogenesis, and hepatic are discussed later. In the blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC, 
anaemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow failure, and/or 
pancytopenia were reported in 11 subjects, see table below.

The majority of these events occurred within the first 35 days post GSK2696273 gene therapy and all 
were resolved, indicating that they were likely to be a consequence of conditioning with busulfan. 
Granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia are known AEs reported with busulfan therapy. 
Anaemia and neutropenia were considered very common ADR attributed to busulfan. The skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders reported in 3 or more subjects were atopic dermatitis, skin lesion, 
dermatitis and rash. Dermatitis and rashes are common in children with ADA-SCID and in healthy 
children. One subject had 2 AEs of skin papilloma, majority of which occurred in the ≥8 year follow-up 
period and all resolved. Skin papillomas are usually benign tumours caused by the human papilloma 
virus (HPV) and have been reported in late-onset ADA deficiency and as severe papillomavirus disease 
after BMT. Cellular immunity including T cell and NK cell cytotoxicity is critical to host defence against 
HPV.

Adverse events by maximum grade 
Summary of adverse events by severity (all studies and CUP safety population) 
More than half of subjects reported grade 3 (severe) infection AEs and most of these occurred in the 3-
month to 3-year follow-up phase. The most frequently reported grade 3 AE was device-related 
infection (5 subjects). Other frequently reported (>2 subjects) SAEs were hepatic enzyme increased, 
anaemia, neutropenia, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and varicella. All of the most frequently reported 
SAEs resolved. Three of the grade 3 neurologic/cognitive/hearing AEs were ongoing at the time of 
dossier submission. Five subjects (28%) had grade 4 events and most events occurred during the 3-
month hospitalisation phase. Five grade 4 AEs were reported in the SOC of blood and lymphatic system 
disorders. All of the grade 4 blood and lymphatic disorder AEs occurred in the 3-month hospitalisation 
phase and the majority occurred within 35 days of gene therapy, suggesting that events may be 
related to busulfan. Two subjects had grade 4 infections and furthermore, six subjects had AEs with 
missing reported severity. All of these events were reported in the pre-treatment phase, with the 
exception of one event of vomiting reported in the treatment phase.

Treatment-related adverse events 
Adverse drug reactions with GSK2696273 gene therapy 
System Organ Classes with the most frequently reported AEs were infections and infestations, 
investigations, blood and lymphatic system disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. For 
each of these, the AE density as estimated by exposure adjusted incidence of events per 100 patient 
years, for the SOC was greatest during a phase before, pre-treatment phase, or during hospitalisation,  
treatment and 3- month hospitalization phases, compared with the AE densities recorded for follow-up 
phases beginning 3 months post GSK2696273 gene therapy and later. The very common ADRs were 
anaemia, asthma, dermatitis atopic, eczema, hypothyroidism, hepatic enzyme increased, hypertension, 
neutropenia, pyrexia, and rhinitis allergic. ADRs considered to be possibly related to busulfan 
conditioning included anaemia, neutropenia, elevations in liver transasminases, and hypertension. The 
use of busulphan hampers a clear assessment of the product safety.  
In general, it seems that the incidence of AE decreased over time and that the most AEs were 
infrequent beyond year 3, which is reassuring. In addition, most of AEs were grade 1 and 2 in severity. 
However,  "Infections", "Investigations" and "Nervous system disorders" continued being reported 
beyond 3 years suggesting that close monitoring of patients is necessary in the long-term. With regard 
to treatment-related AEs, only 2 events were judged as treatment related by investigators. The AEs 
reflected in the SmPC are the result of the review of the integrated safety data done by applicant as 
post-hoc analyses where a number of criteria were considered to classify the AEs. It is, however, 
acknowledged that there are difficulties to establish a firm association of the AEs with this 
investigational product and in this particular setting.  
Adverse reactions potentially related to immune reconstitution 
In the integrated population, the following autoimmune events were reported for subjects post-gene 
therapy: hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune 
haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune aplastic anaemia, Guillain-Barré syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, 
antinuclear antibody (ANA) test positive, anti-thyroid antibody positive, anti-smooth muscle antibody 
positive, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positive, and Coombs direct test positive, see table 
below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 68/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects with AEs potentially related to autoimmunity by study phase 
The majority of the events post-gene therapy occurred within 3 years of treatment with GSK2696273. 
Most resolved, with the exception of hypothyroidism (4 subjects), ANA test positive (3 subjects), and 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. As the nature and timing of the 
events are consistent with autoimmune events observed during immune reconstitution of SCID 
patients with other therapies, the applicant considers that these events are adverse reactions and 
could be a result of the immune reconstitution provided by GSK2696273 and/or possibly due to 
immune dysregulation inherent in ADA-SCID. ANA-positivity was reported in 6 subjects (1 during the 
pre-treatment phase, 4 during the 4-7 year follow-up period and 1 during the >8 year follow-up 
period). A positive anti-thyroid antibody occurred in 1 subject who was not described as having an 
abnormal thyroid and this was not considered a clinically relevant finding. Positivity of anti-smooth 
muscle antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and Coombs direct test are considered useful 
supportive tests of clinical findings, but were not clinically relevant on their own to warrant labelling as 
ADR. In the integrated population, 5 subjects reported a total of 7 events of blood IgE increased and 4 
subjects reported a total of 3 events of eosinophilia. In this subgroup of subjects, multiple clinical 
allergy AEs overlapped with the IgE and eosinophilia events: dermatitis atopic (5 events in 5 subjects), 
eczema/eczema nummular (4 events in 3 subjects), rhinitis allergic/rhinorrhoea (7 events in 4 
subjects), and asthma (2 events in 2 subjects). The majority of events were reported during the 3 
month to 3-year follow-up phase. As with autoimmunity, the nature and timing of the events are 
consistent with such events reported in the literature during immune reconstitution. The applicant 
considers that these events could be a result of the immune reconstitution provided by GSK2696273 
gene therapy and/or possibly due to immune dysregulation inherent in ADA-SCID. Allergy related 
events were classified as adverse reactions. Subjects who were described as having ‘eczema 
nummular’ and ‘rhinorrhoea’ were considered to be adequately described by the terms ‘eczema’ and 
‘rhinitis allergic’, respectively. Pyrexia was reported in 8 subjects and occurred both pre- and post-
treatment and the applicant considers pyrexia to be a very common ADR. 
It should be noted that the literature refers to the fact that immunodeficiency and immune 
dysregulation, which often present as multiple forms of autoimmunity, may occur concurrently in the 
same patient, and represent a breakdown or inadequate development of immune tolerance. In this 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016

respect, autoimmunity has been reported in SCID patients who achieve partial or poor immune 
reconstitution after BMT or with PEG-ADA treatment and in late onset ADA deficiency. This can 
manifest itself as haemolytic anaemia, hypothyroidism, immune thrombocytopenia, or atopy. Reports 
of elevation in IgE levels, eosinophilia, asthma, and allergies have also been described in delayed-
onset ADA-SCID. While it may be reasonable to include neutropenia, but not autoimmune neutropenia, 
as a very common ADR that is considered potentially related to busulfan, the SmPC has been updated 
during the assessment and "antinuclear antibody positive", “anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody 
positive", and "smooth muscle antibody positive" findings have been added as adverse reactions to 
section 4.8. In addition, "hypothyroidism" and "autoimmune thyroiditis" are named in the tabulated list 
of the SmPC. The main concern is that the events occurred beyond 1 year and in many cases 3 years 
after gene therapy, when the immune reconstitution. The risk of therapeutic failure exists and may be 
high. Therefore long-term monitoring of immunogenicity in the registry was requested by the 
CAT/CHMP. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In the integrated database, 15 of 18 subjects have reported 39 SAEs post-treatment, see table below.

Assessment report

Fourteen of the SAEs were reported in 2 subjects. One subject was withdrawn due to reasons related 
to unsuccessful response to gene therapy. All SAEs reported as of the integrated data cut-off resolved. 
Twenty-four of the 39 SAEs reported post-treatment in the integrated dataset were infections, all of 
which resolved. The most frequently reported SAEs (>3 subjects) were in the SOC of infections and 
infestations. Three of the SAEs were grade 4 (neutropenia, pneumonia, and Staphylococcal sepsis): 
  Neutropenia: In one subject, prolonged neutropenia developed approximately 6 weeks 
following gene therapy and was treated with G-CSF, high dose IVIG, and prophylactic 
antibiotics. The neutropenia was considered to be due to a combination of the effects of the 
conditioning regimen and the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies. This SAE resolved in 29 
days. 
  Staphylococcal sepsis: One subject had a Grade 4 SAE of Staphylococcal sepsis with onset 1.3 
years after GSK2696273 treatment. The subject had a CVC in place at the time of this event. It 
was treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and acyclovir. The event was considered not related 
to gene therapy, per the investigator, and resolved after 9 days. 
 
Pneumonia: One subject had a grade 4 SAE of pneumonia with onset 3.5 months after gene 
therapy. The subject received the following concomitant medications to treat pneumonia: 
cefpodoxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, voriconazole, salbutamol and budesonide. In addition, the 
subject received an infusion of autologous CD34- cells due to persistent lymphopenia. This 
subject also received PEG-ADA on 3 occasions while the pneumonia SAE was ongoing. 
Other frequently reported SAEs were autoimmune manifestations, with 4 subjects reporting 6 events 
(anti-neutrophil antibody-induced neutropenia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune aplastic 
anaemia, autoimmune hepatitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome). The subject with 2 events of 
autoimmune thrombocytopenia had a history of autoimmune manifestations and was subsequently 
withdrawn due to unsuccessful response to gene therapy. One subject had an SAE of hypertension and 
required long-term therapy with amlodipine. Serious opportunistic infections are often observed in 
patients with immunodeficiencies, but were not common in the GSK2696273 clinical programme. Other 
opportunistic infections reported in more than 1 subject in the GSK2696273 clinical programme 
included Candida, Clostridium difficile, Varicella, and Aspergillus. Four subjects experienced Varicella 
infections; 2 subjects had grade 3 Varicella infections that were SAEs. All of these subjects recovered 
from the serious infection. None of the SAEs were considered related to the product.

Adverse events were reported in the GSK2696273 clinical programme that required administration of 
PEG-ADA, high-dose IVIG, high-dose steroids, or additional cells, i.e., back-up bone marrow, un-

Adverse events of interest 
Based on the expected events in patients with ADA-SCID, the risks of gene therapy, regulatory 
guidance, and the reporting of treatment-related AEs as assessed by the investigator, the following 
events were identified as AEs of special interest: 
Infections: Infections of the respiratory tract (upper respiratory tract, rhinitis, bronchitis, 
nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis) were the most frequently reported AEs. They were of 
limited duration and most were not serious. These types of infections are prevalent in ADA-SCID and in 
the normal paediatric populations. The densities were highest in the pre-treatment to 3-month 
hospitalisation period and they decreased with time. A total of 9 subjects reported ear infection and/or 
otitis media, with onset mostly in the pre-treatment to the 3-year follow-up period. Four subjects 
experienced varicella infections and all of them recovered. Other infections that are generally 
considered important in an immune-compromised population were not common, occurred 
predominantly early after gene therapy, and resolved. Twenty four of the 39 SAEs reported post-
treatment in the integrated dataset were infections, all of which resolved. In the overall integrated 
population for safety (without censoring of subjects requiring intervention), 22 infections were 
classified as “severe” per the clinical programme definition. 
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) were of the most commonly reported infections in this cohort of ADA-
SCID subjects. The number of UTIs was higher than might be expected relative to the general 
paediatric population, but several did occur in 2 subjects considered to have had an unsuccessful 
response to GSK2696273 treatment, and in others with congenital abnormalities (phimosis, 
crytochordism, and ambiguous genitalia) known to cause a predisposition for UTIs. 
Neurologic, central nervous system, and hearing adverse events: 17 of the 18 subjects in the 
GSK2696273 programme had these events during treatment or post-treatment, and many subjects 
reported events pre-treatment. The most frequently reported event was cognitive disorders (5 
subjects). The other events reported in more than 1 subject were deafness, bilateral deafness and 
psychomotor hyperactivity. A standardized MedDRA query for hearing impairment identified 9 subjects 
with 12 AEs during treatment or post-treatment, with the median time to onset being 2.90 years 
(range 0.16-12.47). Fourteen of the 17 subjects with neurologic, CNS, or hearing events on or after 
gene therapy had either relevant conditions ongoing at screening or events during the pre-treatment 
phase. Nine of these 10 subjects were on PEG-ADA prior to gene therapy. It is noteworthy that 
parental consanguinity was reported in 9 of 18 subjects. The literature review refers to sensori-neural 
deafness and neurological and behavioral abnormalities among patients treated with BMT, ERT, and 
gene therapy. In this respect there is similarity in the neurological events present at baseline and 
observed in LTFU throughout to those observed in patients treated with BMT. It would therefore appear 
that gene therapy does not seem to prevent the appearance of these events.  
Immune reactions: For GSK2696273, there has been no immunogenicity testing conducted to date. 
This approach was taken because GSK2696273 was considered to have low risk for immunogenicity in 
ADA-SCID patients. This low risk is due to contributing factors such as the nature of this disease 
(immune deficiency), the attributes of the therapy (busulfan preconditioning and IVIG and autologous-
derived cells for GSK269273), the single administration of GSK269723, and the intracellular location of 
ADA enzyme precluding it from extracellular antibody recognition. Most subjects had been on PEG-ADA 
prior to gene therapy and although the level of anti- PEG-ADA antibodies was not assessed in the 
clinical studies with GSK2696273, there was no evidence of a loss of enzymatic function in any subject. 
A customised search of AE listings for systemic allergic events (angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, and 
severe cutaneous adverse reactions) that could be potentially related to immunogenicity did not

Page 74/95 
 
 
 
 
 
identify any such events within the first year of GSK2696273 administration. All AEs potentially related 
to autoimmunity have been adequately described in the SmPC. 
The CAT/CHMP noted that the applicant made assumptions regarding the low risk for immunogenicity 
of Strimvelis and hence, did not evaluate the anti-ADA antibodies. This is considered of interest, since 
the majority of patients on PEG-ADA do develop antibodies, and in 10% of patients, these are 
neutralising. More importantly these can cross-react with the human ADA. It is acknowledged that 
human ADA is intra-cellular and would be unlikely to be affected, however, firm proof of this has not 
been provided and thus, in those patients who showed an unsuccessful response to gene therapy, 
particularly early on after treatment, PEG-ADA antibodies would have facilitated interpretation of the 
data. In this respect the applicant has presented a detailed argument against the possibility of 
antibodies to PEG-ADA causing clinically significant and treatment altering effects especially with 
respect to those patients who had treatment failure within a few months after receiving gene therapy. 
While it is acknowledged that the applicant has highlighted significant points in favour of a lack of 
clinically significant effects of antibodies, this cannot be ruled out in some cases. Therefore, the 
CAT/CHMP requested the applicant to evaluate immunogenicity in a post-marketing setting and this is 
included in the RMP. The AEs of systemic allergic events (angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, and 
severe cutaneous adverse reactions) that could be potentially related to immunogenicity will also be 
monitored during LTFU via the registry, which the applicant committed to.  
Oncogenesis: In the GSK2696273 programme, no malignancies were reported, as shown by the SMQ 
for malignant tumours. The MedDRA SMQ for tumours of unspecified malignancy revealed 1 event of 
pulmonary mass. Additional AE terms that could indicate leukemic transformation were investigated, 
including hyperimmunglobinaemia and serum protein electrophoresis abnormal. 
Hyperimmunoglobinaemia could occur as a result of inappropriate expansion of a B-cell clone and could 
be a marker of leukemic transformation. An abnormality in the serum protein electrophoresis could 
also indicate a monoclonal gammopathy, which is a sign of expansion of a particular B-cell clone and 
could signal leukaemic transformation. One subject reported an AE of immunoglobulins increased in 
the 3-month to 3-year follow-up phase; the event resolved over approximately 3 years. At the time of 
this event, the subject also reported AEs of eosinophilia, electrophoresis protein abnormal, and NK cell 
count increased; all of these events resolved.  
Another important signal of leukemic transformation is the presence of a skewed T-cell V beta 
repertoire where only a few V beta chains are present, which would indicate the expansion of a single 
clone of T-cells. All subjects had evidence of a polyclonal T-cell V beta repertoire with more than a 
single V beta family represented. In most subjects, bone marrow analyses by morphology of the 
aspirate showed the presence of lymphocyte, myeloid and erythroid developing cells and bone marrow 
immunophenotype showed the presence of B-cells, T-cells, and NK cells. Cytogenetic analyses 
(karyotype) were normal in the bone marrow and peripheral blood; no abnormal blast values were 
found in either peripheral blood or bone marrow and therefore, no AEs were reported. 
Retroviral insertion site (RSI) analysis: Retroviral insertion site analysis was conducted in 14 subjects 
in the AD1115611 LTFU study. The recovered RIS were presented to allow identification of sites with 
high relative clonal abundance (>10%). The proximity of these sites to cancer-related genes was 
mapped with particular focus on genes previously associated with leukaemia or MDS in clinical trials of 
similar retroviral vectors. A total of 2333 unique insertion sites were mapped. Insertion sites present at 
>10% abundance were mapped against the nearest genes, both up and downstream on coding and 
non-coding. As would be expected for a retroviral vector that inserts semi-randomly into the genome, 
all but 1 subject had insertion sites close to genes linked with cancer. The main concern with this 
particular type of vectors is insertional mutagenesis with the potential for clonal expansion and

Page 75/95 
 
 
 
 
 
neoplasia. However, it is not entirely clear that despite the existing evidence in other diseases like 
SCID-X, WAS and CGD, none of 18 subjects appear to have developed leukaemia or MDS  during a 
median of 7 years and a maximum of 13 years of follow-up. In addition, investigations for other 
haematological abnormalities that could be indicative of clonal abnormalities including B cell 
immunoglobulin production, T-cell receptor V-beta repertoire, bone marrow morphology and 
immunophenotype, peripheral blood smears, and cytogenetic karyotype analysis did not appear to 
show clinically significant changes. As ADA is an enzyme, and is not involved in processes controlling 
cell proliferation/apoptosis, tight gene expression regulation has not yet shown to be crucial. 
Overexpression is unlikely to cause significant side effects. ADA is known as a metabolic “house-
keeping” protein that is constitutively expressed in all cell types. The applicant stated that estimates of 
clonal abundance and comprehensive identification of integration site locations using current methods 
are compromised by several types of recovery biases and sources of variability and therefore, RSI is 
currently unsuitable as an individual subject monitoring safety tool. However, the applicant evaluated 
RSI analysis at a single point in time and has raised the issue of assay variability. To test the 
persistence and contribution of identical insertion sites in a given cell lineage, patients should be 
studied at different time points after gene therapy. In response to this request by the CAT/CHMP, the 
applicant summarised new data that supports demonstration of polyclonality and also summarised 
plans for investigating new and potentially more robust methods for RIS analysis. An explanation of 
why RIS analysis is not a suitable prospective test for lymphoproliferative SAE detection was also 
provided along with a summary of the measures the applicant is proposing in the post-approval safety 
study to monitor for oncogenesis events. This was considered sufficient by the CAT/CHMP and the 
measure for monitoring genotoxicity in the post-marketing setting has been agreed and included in the 
RMP. 
There is a considerable effort to improve RIS detection that might be modified following new technical 
developments. Nevertheless, it cannot be assumed that adverse events will not occur and accordingly, 
patient monitoring needs to be continued to ensure the long term safety of gene therapy. Although the 
CAT/CHMP recommended lifelong monitoring, the applicant has proposed a 15 year period and 
provided a reasonable justification for this duration. This includes a proposed registry with follow up of 
50 patients for a minimum of 15 years. In this respect, the first 4 patients from the trials who currently 
have approximately 15 years of follow up would be followed up for a period of 33 years by the time the 
registry will have closed. In addition, the applicant proposes to continue to solicit information on 
malignancy/death/adverse pregnancy outcome every 2 years past a subject’s 15-year post-gene 
therapy anniversary until the registry is complete. Furthermore, if any relevant efficacy or emergent 
safety concerns arise during one of the interim study assessments, the applicant would seek a 
consultation with the regulatory authorities to discuss whether the duration of the registry should be 
extended beyond the current 15-year proposal. This is deemed acceptable to the CAT/CHMP. The AEs 
reported with respect to decreased T-cell V beta repertoire, pulmonary mass, lipofibroma, 
electrophoresis protein abnormal as well as skin papilloma, have been adequately reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Hepatic laboratory abnormalities and hepatobiliary events: Thirteen subjects reported 40 hepatobiliary 
AEs, including hepatic laboratory abnormalities during the GSK2696273 clinical programme. Six 
subjects had hepatobiliary conditions at screening or pre-treatment events. Half of the events (21/40) 
reported at any time during pre- or post- GSK2696273 therapy were related to elevations in liver 
function tests (liver transaminases or alkaline phosphatase), most were >3 times the upper limit of 
normal (ULN) but <5 times ULN, and occurred predominantly during the 3-month hospitalisation 
phase, post-busulfan. Approximately half of the subjects (7/13) with elevations in liver function tests 
had other hepatobiliary disorders and all of the elevations in liver function test resolved without

intervention. Busulfan is known to cause elevations in transaminases and hepatic veno-occlusive 
disease. Autoimmune hepatitis is considered an ADR for GSK2696273 and hepatic enzyme increased 
considered an ADR attributed to busulfan. It is acknowledged that busulphan can adversely affect 
hepatic enzymes, while autoimmune hepatitis can be considered an ADR for GSK2696273, however, 
the occurrence of 4 cases of hepatic steatosis during LTFU  needs to be kept under review which has 
been satisfactorily addressed in the long term follow up via the registry requested by the CAT/CHMP.  
Deaths  
No deaths have been reported during the GSK2696273 clinical programme. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Following an initial decrease between baseline and Day 14 consistent with the non-myeloablative 
conditioning phase, haematology endpoints of haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, and white 
blood cells (WBC) showed an increase toward pre-treatment values over 3 months to 1 year. Only 
WBC counts increased above pre-treatment values, which is to be expected as increases in lymphocyte 
counts occur as immune reconstitution progresses post-gene therapy. 
Clinical chemistry and urinalysis 
Most clinical chemistry and urinalysis values remained within the normal laboratory ranges. Out-of-
range values were noted, but all were temporary and no consistent pattern of clinical concern was 
observed for any test. Abnormalities or out-of-range values were Changes do not appear to be 
significantly remarkable. 
Safety in special populations 
Not applicable to this type of population. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As GSK2696273 is designed to result in the production of intracellular ADA, which is a protein normally 
found within the body, it is unlikely to interact with any particular medication. However, no formal 
interaction studies were performed. This is acceptable to the CAT/CHMP. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no AEs leading to withdrawal. Despite the fact that patients had AEs and SAEs, patients 
were only withdrawn for unsuccessful gene therapy.  
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing experience with Strimvelis. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Strimvelis safety population was essentially the efficacy population except that two patients started 
treatment after the data cut-off, however, only SAEs have been reported for these two patients. The 
dose of busulphan was significantly less than that used in a myeloablative regimen and therefore the 
AEs observed may not be entirely consistent with its typical safety profile. One patient had an 
unsuccessful response to gene therapy following treatment with and without conditioning treatment 
with busulphan. System Organ Classes with the most frequently reported AEs were infections and 
infestations, investigations, blood and lymphatic system disorders, and skin and subcutaneous tissue 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 77/95 
 
 
 
 
 
disorders. The very common ADRs were anaemia, asthma, dermatitis atopic, eczema, hypothyroidism, 
hepatic enzyme increased, hypertension, neutropenia, pyrexia, and rhinitis allergic. ADRs considered to 
be possibly related to busulfan conditioning included anaemia, neutropenia, elevations in liver 
transasminases, and hypertension. The use of busulphan limits a clear assessment of the product’s 
safety; however, as already stated, the dose used was much lower than specified. The literature refers 
to the fact that immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation may occur concurrently in the same 
patient, and represent a breakdown or inadequate development of immune tolerance. In this respect, 
autoimmunity has been reported in SCID patients who achieve partial or poor immune reconstitution 
after BMT or with PEG-ADA treatment and in late onset ADA deficiency. The SmPC has been updated 
and treatment related AEs such as "antinuclear antibody positive", "antineutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibody positive", and "smooth muscle antibody positive" have been incorporated as adverse reaction 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Serious adverse events were reported in most subjects and infections were the most frequent SAEs. 
Serious opportunistic infections are often observed in patients with immunodeficiencies, but were not 
common in the GSK2696273 clinical programme. Other opportunistic infections included Candida, 
Clostridium difficile, Varicella, and Aspergillus infections. All of the affected subjects recovered. None of 
the SAEs were considered related to the product administration. The majority of infections were 
reported in the 3 month to 3 year period, many being related to the CVC. With respect to CNS events, 
the literature refers to sensori-neural deafness and neurological and behavioural abnormalities among 
patients treated with BMT, ERT, and gene therapy. In this respect, there is similarity in the 
neurological events present at baseline and observed in LTFU throughout, to those observed in 
patients treated with BMT. It would appear BMT does not seem to prevent the appearance of these 
events. As far as immunogenicity is concerned, the anti-ADA antibodies have not been evaluated. This 
is questionable since the majority of patients on PEG-ADA develop antibodies, and in 10%, these are 
neutralising. More importantly, they could potentially cross-react with human ADA. It is acknowledged 
that human ADA is intra-cellular and would be unlikely to be affected; however, a firm proof of this 
concept has not been provided. Thus, the CAT/CHMP requested the applicant to follow up on these 
events in the post-marketing setting and this has been agreed. 
With respect to hepatic adverse events, it is acknowledged that busulphan can adversely affect hepatic 
enzymes, while autoimmune hepatitis can be considered as an ADR for GSK2696273; however, the 
occurrence of 4 cases of hepatic steatosis during LTFU needs to be kept under review and the 
monitoring of hepatotoxicity is now included in the long-term registry as requested by the CAT/CHMP. 
Laboratory values for haematology and clinical chemistry do not appear to be significantly remarkable. 
Adverse events with respect to age and gender in comparison to the integrated population appeared to 
be generally similar. Furthermore, the applicant will also conduct a post-approval methodology study 
to investigate the retroviral insertion. It cannot be assumed that related adverse events will not occur 
and hence, patient monitoring needs to be continued to ensure the long term safety of gene therapy. 
The CAT/CHMP recommended the genotoxicity and immunogenicity follow up. These have been 
included in the RMP.  
The CAT/CHMP considered that a thorough follow up of patients via registry is an important post-
marketing measure and requested a set-up of a registry. All patients will be monitored for 
immunogenicity, insertional mutagenesis and oncogenesis as well as hepatic toxicity. The applicant will 
review the occurrence of angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, systemic allergic events and severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions during the follow up period, particularly in those patients who had 
unsuccessful response and received ERT or SCT. The applicant will also evaluate intervention-free 
survival.  
In addition, the applicant will conduct a post approval methodology study to investigate the retroviral 
insertion site analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016

These measures are considered adequate by the CAT/CHMP. From the safety database all the adverse 
reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
While the short term safety evaluation appears to be hampered by the busulphan conditioning, 
medium and longer term safety seem to be consistent with safety findings in ADA patients undergoing 
immune reconstitution. Immunogenicity has not been fully addressed in the clinical programme, 
especially with respect to antibodies to PEG-ADA, and the effect of inhibitory antibodies with respect to 
treatment failure cannot be excluded in some cases. Accordingly, the applicant will monitor 
immunogenicity in new patients entered in the postmarketing registry.  In this respect antibodies to 
PEG-ADA will be evaluated initially, and in those patients in whom inhibitory antibodies are detected, 
immunogenicity with respect to bovine ADA and human ADA will also be evaluated in a post-marketing 
setting. The applicant will develop an appropriate screening, confirmatory assays which would have 
been fully validated for this purpose. Although the main safety concern with respect to oncogenesis 
and insertional mutagenesis at this point in time does not give rise to major concerns, this cannot be 
taken for granted and requires further monitoring. Hence, the applicant will conduct a post approval 
methodology study to investigate the retroviral insertion site analysis.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
  Non-interventional PASS: In order to investigate the long term safety and efficacy of Strimvelis 
gene therapy, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of a long term prospective, non-
interventional follow up study using data from a registry of patients with adenosine deaminase 
severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) treated with Strimvelis. The MAH will follow up 
on the risk of immunogenicity, insertional mutagenesis and oncogenesis as well as hepatic 
toxicity. The MAH will review the occurrence of angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, systemic 
allergic events and severe cutaneous adverse reactions during the FU period, particularly in 
those patients who had unsuccessful response and received ERT or SCT. The MAH will also 
evaluate intervention-free survival. 
 
The applicant will provide the final study report of the long term follow up study AD1115611 
LTFU as an obligation. In this respect all 18 patients should be followed up for a period of 8 
years, Category 3, RMP 
 
The applicant should provide more details regarding the survey (i.e. timelines, outcomes for 
success, follow up questionnaires) to evaluate effectiveness of risk minimisation. The applicant 
will commit to providing full details of this post-authorisation study at a later date as a post-
approval commitment. The study is anticipated to start in 2Q 2017.  Category 3, RMP 
 
The applicant will conduct a post approval methodology study to investigate the retroviral 
insertion site analysis. Category 3, RMP 
Recommendation: The applicant is strongly encouraged to seek collaboration with the EBMT registry 
and shall provide a concept protocol to the EBMT Inborn Errors Working Party or other relevant group 
of the Strimvelis product registry protocol approved by PRAC. The applicant will provide updates to 
EMA regarding progress toward creation of a patient registry with EBMT via the PBRER. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  and  CAT  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the 
applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.    
2.9.  Significance of paediatric studies 
The CAT/CHMP is of the opinion that study AD1115611, which is contained in the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan PIP P/0190/2014 and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered as 
significant. 
2.10.  Product information

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group. 
Based on art. 63(3), the applicant requested the use of minimum particulars on the label that would be 
inserted into the pouch of the EVA bag. Even if the bag is 50mL, the company claimed there was no 
space for full particulars; they proposed to display the name of the medicinal product, route of 
administration, and batch specific information (lot number, patient ID, total cells, and CD34+ cells/kg 
body weight). The use of minimum particulars would also allow for the batch specific information to be 
clearly inserted by hand. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will 
appear in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Strimvelis (autologous CD34+ enriched cell 
fraction that contains CD34+ cells transduced with retroviral vector that encodes for the human ADA 
cDNA sequence) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance and 
has a PASS imposed.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
There is a compelling evidence of the efficacy of Strimvelis with respect to the primary endpoint, as a 
result of 100% survival (median 7 years) in both the pivotal and integrated population, since the 
studied condition is fatal, ADA-SCID, in the first year of life (Hassan et al 2012). This survival rate also 
appears to be superior to SCT from MUDs (67%) after a median follow-up of approximately 6.5 years 
as well as the HLA-matched sibling and family donor SCT (86% and 83%, respectively). This was also 
the case for intervention-free survival although the figures were somewhat lower, 92% and 82% 
respectively for the pivotal and integrated populations. The beneficial effects from the key secondary 
endpoints were consistent with the increased survival, including the decrease in the rate of serious 
infections compared to the baseline rate. 
There was also evidence of immune reconstitution with an increase in CD3+ T cells as well as T cell 
subsets and some evidence of thymopoiesis as well as of peripheral T cell function, as evidenced by T 
cell proliferation.  The numbers of CD19+ B cells was however, much variable, being lower than 
baseline, nevertheless, B cell function appeared to be present as evidenced by slight increases in 
immunoglobulin production with respect to IgM and IgA. However, levels of IgG remained unchanged. 
In addition, antibody response to vaccination and decrease in the requirement of IVIG, was also 
observed in some patients. Additionally there was an evidence of engraftment of genetically modified 
cells, production of the deficient ADA enzyme to clinically therapeutic levels, and the functionality of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/272303/2016  
Page 88/95 
 
 
 
 
 
the enzyme by the modification of the systemic metabolic defect with achieving below toxic levels of 
the purine metabolites, which was a key secondary efficacy endpoint. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The absence of a comparator in the clinical trials hampers the reliable evaluation of intervention-free 
survival, which is more clinically meaningful especially since the pivotal study is a single-arm single 
centre study. In this respect, comparison with a historical control, although appropriate in the 
circumstances, is less informative than an active control.  
Out of a total of 20 patients, 5 patients (25%) appeared to have responded unsuccessfully to gene 
therapy and required rescue treatment with PEG-ADA. However, based on the data available to date, it 
is not entirely clear which patients are likely to respond to gene therapy and this figure seems 
remarkably similar to that reported in the literature, as regards patients requiring restarting PEG-ADA 
after gene therapy. In the last stage of the procedure, the applicant updated the information, including 
all the Strimvelis treated patients up to March 2016, overall 6/22 (27%) received PEG-ADA as rescue 
medication. 
The use of Strimvelis in post-marketing is expected to bring more information on this issue. Although 
there is a good evidence of B cell functionality, it is notable that unlike T cells, B cell reconstitution may 
be limited in comparison, which could impact on the requirement of IVIG after gene therapy. It is 
uncertain if the T lymphocyte increase could be due to other mechanisms such as expansion in central 
non-thymic organs (bone marrow or lymph nodes) or in the periphery of the immune system. The 
applicant has referred to data that would suggest that T-cell reconstitution after gene therapy, like 
allogeneic stem cell transplant, might be driven by both, the de novo thymopoiesis and the 
homeostatic expansion of naïve and memory T cells.  
In addition, at this stage it is not possible to predict which patients will respond to gene therapy and 
further long term follow up in the registry is considered necessary before firm conclusions can be 
drawn. It should be noted that initial trials in gene therapy were confounded due to concomitant 
administration of PEG-ADA and therefore it is important to ascertain responders to gene therapy. The 
applicant will evaluate intervention-free survival in the registry, as requested by the CAT/CHMP.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Compared to the SCT, the immune reconstitution appears to be much slower with gene therapy. Thus, 
there is a risk of development of significant infections, especially during the first year after the 
treatment. Notably, there could be a significant risk of autoimmunity, which needs to be managed by 
the treating specialist, as the majority of patients in the integrated population developed anti-
neutrophil antibody-induced neutropenia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune aplastic 
anaemia, autoimmune hepatitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and aplastic anaemia. This could potentially 
precipitate treatment failure as noted in 2 patients who required rescue treatment with PEG-ADA. In 
addition, there were multiple clinical allergy related AEs in a subgroup of patients who had increased 
IgE level and eosinophilia.  
Furthermore, event ought the immunogenicity due to pre-existing anti-ADA antibodies that might arise 
from PEG-ADA treatment is considered unlikely, the effect of inhibitory antibodies with respect to 
treatment failure cannot be entirely excluded in some cases. Thus, the applicant agreed to monitor 
immunogenicity in the patients who will entered in the registry, as requested by the CAT/CHMP. 
Although SAEs were noted in the majority of subjects, none of the SAEs were judged to be related to 
treatment. However, it is likely that neurologic, CNS and hearing events may not fully respond to gene 
therapy, as it has also been noted for the ERT and SCT. Upon Strimvelis administration, there is also 
an increase in hepatobiliary events, especially cases of hepatic steatosis which were detected during a 
long term follow up. A few patients developed AEs with respect to decreased T-cell V beta repertoire, 
pulmonary mass, lipofibroma, electrophoresis protein abnormal, as well as skin papilloma. All SAEs 
have been included in the SmPC in order to inform the physicians about the possible side effects. 
Moreover, several post-authorisation measures have been agreed in order to monitor amongst others 
the events of hepatotoxicity and immunotoxicity.  
The applicant also acknowledged that there is limited experience about recommending the pre-
treatment conditioning with busulfan. In the frame of the agreed long-term follow up post-
authorisation registry, the applicant has committed to conduct an exploratory analysis in order to 
investigate the relationship between busulfan AUC, captured at baseline, and clinical outcome (e.g. 
survival, intervention free survival and lymphocyte count differentials). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
With the use of retroviral vectors, there is a concern of a potential for insertional mutagenesis and 
oncogenesis. However, as yet, no cases of leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or malignancy have 
developed after the treatment with Strimvelis, which is cautiously reassuring from a safety 
perspective. Nevertheless, as ADA is an enzyme, and is not involved in processes controlling cell 
proliferation/apoptosis, tight gene expression regulation has not been shown to be crucial yet, and 
overexpression is unlikely to cause significant side effects. Nevertheless, it is important to consider 
long term follow-up with respect to the evaluation of the risk of oncogenesis and hence, the CAT/CHMP 
requested the applicant to conduct a post approval methodology study to investigate the retroviral 
insertion site analysis. In addition, estimates of clonal abundance and comprehensive identification of 
integration site locations using current methods are compromised by several types of recovery biases 
and sources of variability. Therefore, retroviral insertion site is currently unsuitable as an individual 
subject monitoring safety tool. Retroviral insertion site analysis has been studied at a single point in 
time, nevertheless, to test the persistence and contribution of identical insertion sites in a given cell 
lineage, patients need to be studied at different time points after gene therapy. Therefore, an assay 
with non-restrictive platforms will be developed by the applicant to address this issue.

Furthermore, it cannot be assumed that adverse events will not occur in the long term and accordingly, 
patient monitoring needs to be continued to ensure the long term safety of gene therapy with 
Strimvelis. The CAT/CHMP recommended that all patients are enrolled in a registry for monitoring for 
at least 15 years from the time of Strimvelis administration. This long-term follow up via a specific 
registry is considered important to benefit/risk of Strimvelis.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
ADA-SCID is primarily diagnosed in very young paediatric patients who, without treatment, rarely 
survive beyond 1-2 years. Patients enrolled in the pivotal study lacked a healthy HLA-identical sibling 
donor and some of them failed after at least 6 months of treatment with PEG-ADA due to intolerance, 
allergic reaction or autoimmunity or because the ERT was not a lifelong therapeutic option. In these 
patients, Strimvelis has shown to reach a 100% survival rate that was maintained after a median 
patient follow-up period of 7 years. These data are comparable to the ones obtained with HLA-identical 
family donor. The figures of intervention–free survival, though lower, are also comparatively superior 
with gene therapy. In addition, there are other factors which are also bypassed with gene therapy with 
respect to the use of full myeloablation as well as GvHD after allogeneic SCT. The reduction in serious 
infection rate as well as immune reconstitution together with detoxification of metabolites is also 
significant as these are common causes of mortality in this population of patients. With respect to 
unfavourable effects, the occurrence of autoimmunity can significantly impact on outcome of treatment 
with gene therapy and may require the administration of rescue treatment. Additionally, the risk, albeit 
comparatively smaller, with respect to insertional mutagenesis, may give rise to leukaemia, MDS and 
malignancy which may impact on survival. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The totality of data from the clinical programme of Strimvelis demonstrate compelling evidence for 
efficacy since patients with early and delayed onset ADA-SCID rarely survive beyond 1 to 2 years 
unless immune function is restored  either with SCT or PEG-ADA. With respect to safety, the risk of 
insertional mutagenesis would appear to be comparatively smaller than has been observed in other 
diseases with similar vectors possibly because ADA is an enzyme, and is not involved in processes 
controlling cell proliferation/apoptosis, therefore tight gene expression regulation has not yet been 
shown to be crucial, and overexpression is unlikely to cause significant side effects. While 
autoimmunity is an issue, and it will be evaluated in the registry, it would appear to be manageable 
with additional standard therapy. Accordingly, from a clinical perspective, the benefit/risk balance of 
Strimvelis is considered positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Strimvelis has been shown to increase life survival up to 100 % in a disease, ADA SCID, with which 
patients rarely survive beyond 1-2 years. This has shown to be possible with provision of evidence of 
engraftment of gene modified cells in the bone marrow as a result of which, the deficient ADA enzyme 
is produced to levels which are considered clinically therapeutic. In addition, evidence that the enzyme 
is functional is determined by the detoxification of metabolites to clinically relevant levels. It is fully 
recognized that immunological reconstitution alleviates the imminent problem and provides a curative 
opportunity to this life-threatening situation. The consequences of the administration of Strimvelis on 
Assessment report

immune reconstitution have resulted to be effective and are the main contribution to the clinical 
benefit. Thus, the basis for the increased survival would appear to be robust, while the key secondary 
endpoints are fully supportive and consistent with the increased survival. A decrease in the rate of 
severe infections is consistent with the immune reconstitution of mainly T cells and to a much lesser 
extent B cells whose functionality support the beneficial effects outlined above. 
Strimvelis was shown to be relatively well tolerated although data are limited due to the small number 
of patients studied. There is potential risk of insertional mutagenesis and oncogenesis with this type of 
retroviral vector. Nevertheless, as yet, no cases of leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or 
malignancy have developed which is cautiously reassuring from a safety perspective and post-
authorisation measures are in place to monitor such events. However, as ADA is an enzyme, and is not 
involved in processes controlling cell proliferation/apoptosis, tight gene expression regulation has not 
to date been shown to be crucial and overexpression is unlikely to cause significant side effects. With 
respect to the evaluation of the potential risk of oncogenesis, a long term follow-up with via the 
registry and a separate study was agreed. This is considered key to the positive benefit/risk of 
Strimvelis. Additionally, autoimmunity, may impact on the outcome of gene therapy due to immune 
reconstitution which may require rescue treatment. These potential risks will be followed up and 
monitored by the applicant who committed to a number of post-authorisation measures, as requested 
by the CHMP. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the draft CHMP opinion adopted by the CAT and the review of data on quality, safety and 
efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Strimvelis in the treatment 
of patients with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-
SCID), for whom no suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related stem cell donor is 
available, is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject 
to the following conditions:

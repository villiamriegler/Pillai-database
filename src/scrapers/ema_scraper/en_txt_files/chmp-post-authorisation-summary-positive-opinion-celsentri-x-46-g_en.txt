Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Celsentri 
Maraviroc 
On 21 April 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Celsentri. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is ViiV Healthcare UK Limited. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication as follows2: 
“Celsentri, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for 
treatment-experienced adults, adolescents and children of 2 years of age and older and weighing 
at least 10 kg patients infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
This indication is based on safety and efficacy data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 
treatment-experienced patients (see section 5.1).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

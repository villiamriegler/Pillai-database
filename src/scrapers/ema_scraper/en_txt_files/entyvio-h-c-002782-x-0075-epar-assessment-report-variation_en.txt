No updates provided as part of this Line Extension (please refer to initial MAA EPAR). About the 
product 
Vedolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against 
the human lymphocyte integrin α4β7.  
Vedolizumab specifically inhibits the activity of the α4β7 integrin by selectively antagonizing binding 
and adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and to the extracellular 
matrix glycoprotein fibronectin but does not antagonize binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. 
By antagonizing both the α4β7 MAdCAM-1 interaction and the associated migration of leukocytes into 
GI mucosa, vedolizumab reduces inflammation. Vedolizumab does not bind to, nor inhibit the function 
of, the α4β1 and αEβ7 integrins. 
Entyvio is currently approved in the following dosages/forms: 
300 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion  
108 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous use 
108 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen for subcutaneous use 
2.2.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Marketing authorization (MA) for vedolizumab, for the treatment of patients with moderately to 
severely active ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s Disease, two closely related forms of inflammatory bowel 
disease, was granted in EU/EEA on 22 May 2014. Initially the MA was issued for Entyvio 300 mg 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion (intravenous administration - IV), which later was 
complemented by the subcutaneous (SC) form intended for the maintenance treatment (following at 
least 2 intravenous infusions): Entyvio 108 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe / in pre-filled 
pen, granted via line-extension procedure in EU/EEA on 28 Apr 2020. Takeda filed for a new 
therapeutic indication in the treatment of moderately to severely active chronic pouchitis for Entyvio IV 
in 2021 which was approved on 31 Jan 2022. 
8 
The present line extension application aims to introduce a new manufacturing process (defined as 
Process D) for the vedolizumab drug substance (both IV and SC). The declared extension scope is 
given below: 
Qualitative change in the declared active substance (vedolizumab), not defined as a new active 
substance: 
Replacement of a biological substance of product of biotechnology - modification of the vector used to 
produce the antigen or the source material, including a new master cell bank from a different source, 
where the efficacy/safety characteristics are not significantly different. 
The currently approved drug substance manufacturing process (Process C) is to be transitioned within 
to the new manufacturing process (Process D), for both drug products, Entyvio IV and SC.  
An extended transition period was initially proposed by the MAH. Following the concerns raised by the 
Agency, the MAH has significantly reduced the duration of the intended transition period. 
In addition to the quality dossier, the supporting package also includes non-clinical modules with data 
from an in-vitro (non-GLP) study (TKD-BCS-00379) to assess the relative immunogenicity risk of the 
Entyvio Process D drug products compared with the Entyvio Process C drug products, as well as clinical 
modules with data from a clinical Phase I study (vedolizumab-1019, an open label, randomized parallel 
group study to assess the pharmacokinetics of single intravenous and subcutaneous injections of 
vedolizumab administered to healthy human subjects) conducted to support the comparability between 
Process C and Process D. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has submitted an extension application to the existing MA for Entyvio 300 mg powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion (intravenous formulation, IV) and 108 mg solution for injection in 
pre-filled syringe /in pre-filled pen (subcutaneous formulation, SC), aiming to introduce a new 
manufacturing process (defined as “Process D”) for the vedolizumab active substance (IV and SC). 
The new “Process D” utilizes a new master cell bank (MCB) and a new working cell bank (WCB) for the 
manufacturing of vedolizumab active substance (AS) derived from a different Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) host cell line.  
Moreover, a new manufacturing and testing site for the new MCB/WCB has been introduced, as well as 
additional changes specific to the newly introduced “Process D” such as new cell culture media, 
updated process steps, adjustment of specification and analytical methods.  
Two different finished product (FP) formulations are currently authorised for Vedolizumab (Entyvio): 
intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC), containing vedolizumab as active substance (AS). Other 
ingredients for the IV formulation are: L-histidine; L-histidine monohydrochloride; L-arginine 
hydrochloride; Sucrose; Polysorbate 80. Other ingredients for the SC formulation are: citric acid 
monohydrate; sodium citrate dihydrate; L-histidine; L-histidine monohydrochloride; L-arginine 
hydrochloride; polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
Vedolizumab IV, 300 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, is a lyophilized formulation in 
a vial intended for intravenous infusion, which has been granted marketing authorisation in the EU in 
2014.  
Moreover, a new pharmaceutical form (solution for injection), associated with a new strength (108 mg) 
and a new route of administration (subcutaneous use), which is a liquid formulation has been 
9 
authorised in the EU in 2020. The vedolizumab SC is available for administration either via a single-
use, prefilled syringe with needle safety device (PFS + NSD) or via a prefilled syringe in an 
autoinjector/pen (PFS + AI).  
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
Vedolizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody to the human α4β7 integrin. It is 
composed of two light chains of the kappa subclass and two heavy chains linked together by two 
disulfide bridges to form a Y-shaped molecule that is typical of IgG1 immunoglobulins as shown in the 
figure below. Each molecule contains twelve intra-chain and four inter-chain disulfide bonds and an 
asparagine-linked glycosylation site on each heavy chain at residue 301 (see Figure 1). 
Figure 1: Structural Representation of Vedolizumab 
The mechanism of action of Vedolizumab is to selectively block the adhesion of α4β7 + T cells and B 
cells to their natural ligand MAdCAM-1.  
The isoelectric point is 7.6-8.3, the predicted mass for unmodified protein is 146,837 Da. 
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Separate 3.2.S.2.1. Sections for “Process C” and “Process D”, listing all the vedolizumab active 
substance manufacturing and control sites, will be maintained during the transition period. 
Therefore, new 3.2.S.2.1. Sections, for both the IV and the SC presentations, have been introduced 
for “Process D”. 
A new MCB and WCB manufacturer (GMP compliant) has been introduced as a manufacturer and 
testing site for the new MCB/WCB related to the new “Process D” AS manufacturing process for both 
the IV and the SC presentations.  
Both Vedolizumab intravenous (IV) and Vedolizumab subcutaneous (SC) active substances are 
manufactured, according to “Process D”, at AbbVie Bioresearch Center (ABC) - Worcester (USA), where 
the manufacture of active substance according to “Process C” is already authorised. All the proposed 
sites are GMP compliant. 
The manufacturing process as well as the operating parameters for “Process D” active substance have 
been discussed and justified.  
10 
  
 
 
Moreover, monitoring of bioburden, endotoxin, and other in-process controls for each operation unit 
ensures appropriate control of the process stream and the quality of the AS manufactured according to 
the new “Process D”.  
In summary, some changes with respect to the currently authorised “Process C” have been introduced 
in “Process D” active substance manufacturing process to improve process efficiency. 
  New MCB and WCB derived from a different CHO lineage host cell line  
  New gene-expression vector  
  New cell culture media  
  New polishing chromatography  
  Technology update 
  Change in the container closure system for vedolizumab (IV) AS 
Control of materials 
As a consequence of the changes accompanying “Process D” introduction, new raw materials and 
starting materials have been introduced in the AS manufacturing process (IV and SC). It is noted that 
the raw materials used in the manufacture of “Process D” vedolizumab are identical between IV and SC 
active substance for all shared process steps. 
In detail, all culture media used in Process D, including expansion, production and feed media, have 
been changed and have been described appropriately. 
A qualitative description of the new culture media has been provided. Materials used in culture media 
are considered extremely low risk in terms of a potential TSE contamination.  
A new CHO host cell line and, consequently, new cell banks have been introduced. Compared to cell 
banks currently authorised for “Process C”, the new cell banks are derived from a different CHO host 
cell line. 
A detailed description of host cell line origin and development has been provided. No materials of 
animal origin were used in the host cell line development process. 
Moreover, a description of the vector has been also provided.  
The vedolizumab “Process D” production cell line was created using the new host cell line adapted to 
culture. 
Following defined selection steps, a clone was selected, expanded and frozen to create a research cell 
bank (RCB), shown to be stable, free of mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi, and adventitious virus, and used 
to establish the Master Cell Bank.  
Two distinct approaches have been used to evaluate the clonal derivation of the production cell line. 
The new “Process D” cell bank system (MCB/WCB/post production (PPCB)) has been prepared under 
cGMP conditions at the newly introduced manufacturer.  
The newly manufactured “Process D” cell banks lots have been extensively characterised and tested. 
Phenotypic characterisation testing for MCB and WCB included viability at thaw, to determine if the 
banks were acceptable for use. Species identity testing was performed.  
Moreover, sterility and mycoplasma testing, as well as viral detection assays, have been performed to 
ensure the absence of adventitious agents and inter-species contaminants in the new “Process D” cell 
banks system. “In vivo" tests for adventitious viruses on MCB were performed. 
The genotypic characterisation of the MCB was performed.  
11 
 
Comparison of the vedolizumab gene copy number observed in the MCB and PPCB indicates that the 
PPCB and the MCB copy number did not have an effect on protein titer or product quality within 
generations assessed in the study. 
The above described genotypic characterisation has been performed in conjunction with evaluation of 
the MCB genetic stability and establishment of the Limit of in Vitro Cell Age (LIVCA) for “Process D”. 
Overall, the results provided adequately support the conclusion that no detectable adventitious 
microbial agents or infectious endogenous retrovirus are present in the MCB, WCB or PPCB, and that 
the cells are of Chinese hamster origin. Being a CHO cell line, for which the endogenous production of 
defective retroviral virus-like particles (RVLPs) is well known and acknowledged in applicable 
regulatory guidance, detection of A-type and C-type retrovirus-like particles on MCB and PPCB levels is 
expected.  
Overall, the activities performed to develop and characterize the new cell banks system for “Process D” 
result aligned with applicable guidelines ICH Q5A, ICH Q5D and ICH Q5B. 
Process validation  
The upstream and downstream manufacturing steps relative to “Process D” active substance (IV and 
SC) have been validated on several commercial-scale vedolizumab AS batches, for IV and for SC, 
manufactured at AbbVie Bioresearch Center, Inc. (ABC) in Worcester (US). 
Overall, the process performance validation (PPQ) exercise has adequately demonstrated the capability 
of the new vedolizumab Process D (IV and SC) manufacturing process at ABC to consistently 
manufacture a AS having a quality profile suitable for further processing to finished product. In fact, all 
“Process D” active substance PPQ batches (IV/SC) manufactured within the process validation protocol 
fully met the final AS release specifications. Moreover, during the PPQ exercise almost all process 
parameters set for each unit operation remained within their normal operating ranges (NORs) and the 
few excursions registered are considered not critical and unlikely to have an impact on the “Process D” 
vedolizumab AS quality, process performance or validation of the affected unit operations.  
With reference to impurities, clearance studies performed as part of the PPQ exercise, the orthogonal 
chromatography operations throughout the downstream process showed a suitable clearance capability 
of major impurities.   
Hold times have been validated, both in terms of biochemical and microbiological stability.  
Resins and membrane lifetime has been preliminary set and will be further confirmed through 
concurrent validation studies during routine production. Lifetime will be determined through concurrent 
validation during routine production. Adequate acceptance criteria have been included in the dossier 
for the continuous verification of membranes lifetime (IV and SC).  
In the vedolizumab “Process D” AS (IV/SC) manufacturing process, filtration steps are supported by 
adequate studies and will be further validated through a concurrent validation performed according to 
a suitable protocol. 
Manufacturing process development 
Development of the vedolizumab AS manufacturing process to date has consisted of three process 
iterations, designated “A”, “B,” and “C” completed ahead of the initial Marketing Authorisation 
Application (please refer to respective EPAR). 
The current submission describes the development of vedolizumab AS “Process D” (IV and SC) that, as 
previously anticipated, resulted in the introduction of several changes in the AS manufacturing process 
(IV/SC) with respect to the currently authorised Process C (IV/SC). 
12 
Based on risk assessments, the MAH has performed process characterisation and process performance 
qualification studies aiming to show that the introduced changes to the “Process D” manufacturing 
process do not have an impact to vedolizumab critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
A comprehensive step by step comparison between the two AS manufacturing processes (Process C vs 
Process D) has been provided.  
To support the introduction of the new “Process D” vedolizumab AS manufacturing process, 
characterisation experiments were performed for both upstream and downstream unit operations. 
Process characteristics, process parameters, raw materials, and the impact of process parameter and 
raw material variation on product quality attributes have been evaluated for each unit operation.  
Overall, the adopted characterisation approach, including criticality assessment and design of 
experiment studies, was found suitably comprehensive to understand the influence of any potential 
process parameter or material attribute impact to a CQA. For both upstream and downstream unit 
operations, suitable process parameters and material attributes were evaluated for their impact. For 
upstream steps, the impact to vedolizumab titer, and other process performance outputs was also 
assessed. For downstream steps, the impact to step yield and other process performance outputs was 
also assessed. 
Moreover, to support the introduction of “Process D” AS manufacturing process (IV and SC), 
comparability studies have been provided within the present submission. 
Overall, the comparability exercises performed sufficiently support the conclusion that the processes 
are comparable at clinical and commercial scales. 
It is noted that the variability between Process D and Process C is limited and overall remains 
consistent regardless of scale. No new impurities were identified in the Process D lots. Both processes 
exhibit highly similar trends and pathways of degradation. 
The comparability assessment has also demonstrated that the AS from “Process D” commercial scale 
and clinical scale can be considered highly similar, as the observed differences are small and do not 
impact critical quality attributes. Therefore, the data from the single-dose PK study, performed using 
AS manufactured at the clinical scale, can be considered representative of the AS to be manufactured 
at the commercial scale. 
In addition to the data package supporting Process C/Process D comparability referring to AS, the MAH 
has also provided the comparability evaluation with a comparison of FP release and stability data on 
finished product containing the AS manufactured either according to Process C and Process D, in line 
with the recommendation given in the Scientific Advice EMA/SA/0000053520. The data provided is 
sufficient and adequate.  
Characterisation 
As above described, “Process C” and “Process D” active substance lots resulted highly comparable, 
meeting the comparability acceptance criteria for almost all the quality attributes investigated with a 
couple of exceptions. Nonetheless, these have been assessed to be low impact quality attributes. 
Based on the aforementioned similarities between the Process C and Process D vedolizumab AS, the 
structural characterisation studies already conducted for Process C vedolizumab IV and SC AS have 
been considered relevant also for Process D vedolizumab IV and SC AS. Moreover, no new impurities 
or post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been identified in the newly introduced “Process D” AS. 
On these grounds, no additional characterisation work of Process D vedolizumab AS (IV and SC) has 
been performed, with a couple of exceptions due to the difference in such attributes observed during 
the comparability assessment. 
13 
Based on the results obtained from analysis and characterization studies performed for these 
exceptions, no differences have been reported between “Process D” and “Process C” concerning these 
exceptions. 
To support the introduction of “Process D”, elemental impurities and nitrosamine risk assessments 
have been provided. The potential presence of elemental impurities has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities has been provided. Based on the 
information presented it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
Moreover, the MAH has adequately performed an evaluation on the changes made to the process from 
“C” to “D and their potential impact on new process related impurities.  
Process C to Process D transition period 
The MAH has initially requested a very extensive transition period to fully switch the vedolizumab AS 
manufacturing process from the current “Process C” to the new “Process D”. This proposal lead the 
Agency to raise a number of questions since, as a consequence of the EU legal definition of ‘biological 
medicinal product’, alternative manufacturing processes are not allowed for biological products (ref. 
EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014) and, therefore, it is expected that “Process D” material only will be 
used for the manufacture of all batches intended for the EU market within a justified time-period.  
The potential quality and traceability concerns which could arise from the concurrent management of 
the two different manufacturing processes at the same facility, can be considered satisfactorily 
addressed. Moreover, despite slightly higher than the standard 6-months transition period, the agreed 
transition period can be considered acceptable, also considering the justifications provided by the MAH. 
Two recommendations, REC 2 and 3 have been issued recommending the MAH to submit, at the end of 
the transition period, a variation procedure to remove from the Entyvio Marketing Authorisation all 
“Process C” CTD sections considered no longer relevant (REC 2).  Moreover, on a regular basis until the 
end of the transition period, the MAH should submit to the Agency a full list of “Process D” finished 
product batches supplied to EU market and associated “Process D” active substance batches (REC 3).   
2.3.2.3.  Specification 
The specifications for vedolizumab IV and SC active substance covers the appropriate tests to assure 
identity, purity, safety and potency. 
The specifications, used either for IV or SC active substances release testing and monitoring of 
stability, appear to be adequate in line with ICH Q6B and Ph. Eur. 2031 monoclonal antibodies for 
human use. The proposed specifications are acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures used for release and stability testing of either vedolizumab IV or SC active 
substances have been presented. Compendial methods are used for appearance, pH, bioburden, 
bacterial endotoxin.  
Overall, the choice of analytical procedures to measure respective quality attributes of vedolizumab 
active substance (IV and SC) manufactured according to the new Process D is considered appropriate. 
14 
 
All methods are described in detail, correctly highlighting (where applicable) the main differences 
between the methods relative to “Process C” and those relative to the new proposed “Process D”, also 
through an accurate side by side comparison. Noteworthy, such comparison study has demonstrated 
the equivalence of the methods used for Process C and Process D AS and, in some cases, has showed 
even the superiority of the updated methods that justify their implementation as analytical 
improvement. 
A full analytical validation was performed for all vedolizumab intravenous (IV) and SC “Process D” AS 
non-compendial methods based on guidance provided in ICH Q2(R1) guideline. The complete results of 
the validation procedures are correctly provided for consultation and review. 
No change to the vedolizumab reference standard has been introduced within the present procedure. 
Batch analysis  
Batch analysis data relative to all “Process D” AS PPQ batches manufactured at by AbbVie 
Bioresearch Center (Worcester, MA) have been provided. All data met the specification. 
Container closure system 
With the introduction of the new “Process D” AS manufacturing process for both the IV and SC, the 
MAH has taken the opportunity to introduce also a change in the container closure system for 
vedolizumab (IV) AS, thus, to align the container with that already adopted for vedolizumab SC AS 
(Process C).  
The suitability of the newly proposed AS container closure has been previously assessed for the 
vedolizumab AS (Process C) for subcutaneous use.  
The compatibility of the container closure system with “Process D” AS has been demonstrated through 
long-term stability studies confirming that the potency, purity, and other quality attributes of AS are 
maintained following long-term storage.  
An extractable study was performed on the AS bottle and closure with results confirming the low 
leachable risk for the components. The data provided is sufficient and adequate. 
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
Stability studies based on ICH guidelines have been conducted for vedolizumab active substance. 
In addition, in the context of comparability exercise between “Process D” and “Process C” materials, 
comparative stability data have been presented for vedolizumab IV and SC active substance.  
Overall, the stability studies presented appear to be compliant with the relevant guidelines, in terms of 
number of batches (commercial scale “Process D” AS PPQ batches) and test frequency, for both IV AS 
and SC AS.  
The protocols and the selected tests are generally considered adequate to monitor possible changes in 
the quality of the product. 
All data are within specifications for all Process D derived batches for both IV and SC active substance 
for the current observation period at long-term conditions as well as for the entire period under 
accelerated conditions.  
In addition, the comparability exercise provided by the MAH correctly includes a comparative stability 
study between the batches of “Process D” and those of “Process C” at long term and stressed storage 
conditions. These studies are considered well designed and in compliance with the relevant guidelines 
as regards the number of involved lots. 
15 
Clear graphs illustrating the comparative trend of stability data between the relevant batches of 
process D and those of process C have been provided.  
Also considering the recommended storage condition, collectively the provided data convincingly 
support the proposed shelf life for the active substance when stored in the indicated container closure 
for IV and SC AS material derived from process D. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Process D is an active substance only change. The only change to the finished product is an update to 
specification, as described in the dossier section 3.2.P.5.6 -Process D - IV. Therefore, only the relevant 
finished product sections are included in this report. 
2.3.3.1.  Product specification 
Adequate release and shelf life specifications have been defined for both IV and SC Vedolizumab 
finished product which covers appropriate tests to assure identity, purity, safety and potency. 
Overall, the specifications are in line with ICH Q6B and Ph. Eur. 2031 “Monoclonal antibodies for 
human use” and are considered acceptable for routine control of the finished product both at release 
and shelf life. 
Overall, acceptance criteria are aligned between processes C and D for IV and SC FP with some 
adjustments. Overall, the proposals for FP specifications adjustment are considered acceptable. 
Noteworthy, the MAH commits to review the release and stability specifications when more batches will 
be available (Recommendation 1). 
In general, the methods proposed are appropriate for verifying the key attributes of the finished 
product and FP specific methods can be considered correctly described and validated also for Process D 
derived FP material.  
2.3.3.2.  Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 36 months when stored at 2 °C-8 °C and 24 months when stored at 2 °C-8 °C is claimed 
for the IV and SC finished product respectively. 
Stability studies based on ICH guidelines have been conducted for vedolizumab finished products. 
Furthermore, the applicant followed the recommendation given within the Scientific Advice 
EMA/SA/0000053520,  
Overall, for both IV and SC FP, the stability studies are conducted in accordance with ICH Topic Q5C in 
terms of number of batches, test frequency and storage conditions, including accelerated and stress 
conditions. A detailed protocol for the assessment of the stability at the various conditions is provided. 
Product characteristics chosen for monitoring finished product in its final container appear to be 
adequate; they also include container/closure integrity testing as well as sterility testing at a minimum 
initially and at the end of the proposed shelf-life, and functionality tests where appropriate (SC FP). 
Stability data are within specifications for all Process D derived FP batches for both IV and SC 
presentations, for the observation periods available to date at long-term conditions.   
Stability data remained within specifications during all the observation period in accelerated and 
stressed condition (complete) for all the IV FP lots, while data remained within specifications just for 1 
month at accelerated storage condition for SC FP lots. As expected, degradation is observed at 
accelerated and stressed storage conditions. 
16 
In addition, the supportive clinical stability data available for FP cover the required shelf life of 36 and 
24 months at the proposed storage conditions (refrigerator, i.e., 2 °C-8 °C), respectively. Stability 
studies at accelerated and stressed conditions are complete for these clinical lots. 
Since there is no change in the methods used for finished product manufacture/release/stability, 
neither for the container closure system, as a result of Process D AS change, no critical issues are 
envisaged in this regard. 
In summary, the overall data sufficiently support the proposed shelf life at the proposed storage 
conditions (refrigerator, i.e., 2 °C-8 °C), for the “Process D” IV and SC FP.  
Overall, the stability data provided support the demonstration of comparability between FP Entyvio (IV 
and SC) derived from process D and from process C.  
In conclusion based on the stability data provided the claimed shelf life is considered acceptable. 
For the FP IV, in-use stability of the reconstituted solution in the vial has been demonstrated for 8 
hours at 2°C-8°C.  In-use stability of the diluted solution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution 
for injection in infusion bag has been demonstrated for 12 hours at 20°C-25°C or 24 hours at 2°C-8°C. 
For the FP SC if needed, a single pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen can be left out of the refrigerator 
protected from light at room temperature (up to 25 °C) for up to 7 days. 
Post-approval stability protocol and stability commitments have been provided. Moreover, the MAH 
committed to inform the authorities of any confirmed out of specification test result observed during 
the stability studies and to provide data upon request. 
2.3.3.3.  Adventitious agents 
The viral safety of the vedolizumab AS “Process D” with respect to adventitious agents is assured 
through the design and control of the manufacturing process and by routine testing for adventitious 
virus.  
Viral clearance is achieved through multiple process steps. Suitable viral clearance studies, conducted 
in accordance with the ICH Q5A, have been performed to verify that potential adventitious agents will 
be removed or inactivated during “Process D” manufacturing process.  
Moreover, a comparison of the Overall Log Reduction Factors (LRFs) relative to vedolizumab “Process 
C” and “Process D” has been performed and data show that the virus clearance capacity is very high 
for both processes.  
The “Process D” vedolizumab AS manufacturing process is tested by in-process controls for potential 
viral contamination and all production bioreactor crude harvests undergo the following tests for viral 
contamination: 
  In vitro assay for detection of adventitious virus using four cell lines. 
  Detection and quantitation of MMV by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 
The overall strategy adopted to control the presence of adventitious agents in “Process D” vedolizumab 
AS is found to be adequate.  
As the vedolizumab cell substrate is a CHO cell line, for which the endogenous production of defective 
retroviral virus-like particles is well known and acknowledged, some of the substrates tested showed 
the presence of intracytoplasmic A-type and C-type retrovirus-like particles. It is noted however that 
retrovirus infectivity assays, including endogenous retrovirus infectivity assay for the detection of 
xenotropic retroviruses or cocultivation with Mus Dunni cells for the detection of replication competent 
17 
 
retroviruses, gave negative/not detected results in the cell banks tested. The information provided 
concerning adventitious agents is appropriate. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The present line extension procedure refers to the introduction of a new active substance (IV/SC) 
manufacturing process (defined as Process D) based on a new cell bank system derived from a 
different CHO host cell line, a different vedolizumab expression vector, the introduction of a new 
manufacturing and testing site for the new MCB/WCB, as well as additional changes to the 
manufacturing process, including new cell culture media and updated purification steps. 
To evaluate the potential impact of all changes introduced by the new “Process D” vedolizumab AS 
manufacturing process, with respect to the currently authorised “Process C”, the MAH has performed 
three main comparability exercises supporting the conclusion that “Process D” active substance (IV and 
SC), at clinical and commercial scales, can be considered highly comparable to “Process C” commercial 
scale AS batches.  
Only small differences emerge between processes. However, extended characterisation studies 
together with in vitro human cell-based studies support the conclusion that these differences do not 
impact on efficacy and safety. Nonetheless, the specification should be revised as more data become 
available (Recommendation).   
Vedolizumab has been engineered to eliminate ADCC activity via the introduction of two point 
mutations within the CH2 domain, as evidenced by SPR binding and ADCC studies. In general, the 
present line extension application doesn’t contain, from a quality point of view, major factors affecting 
the overall benefit/risk ratio of vedolizumab.  
The extensive transition period initially requested by the MAH to fully switch from the current “Process 
C” to the new “Process D” has been significantly reduced. Moreover, suitable clarifications supporting 
the adequacy of the measures in place to prevent any potential drifts in quality attributes between the 
two different manufacturing processes and the lack of concurrent manufacturing of material obtained 
through the two manufacturing processes at the same manufacturing site have been provided. The 
MAH should also follow-up on the fulfilment of the transition period as agreed (Recommendations). 
Additional data and further clarification requested during the assessment, including additional queries 
raised following the GMP inspection at the new site, have been provided and found acceptable.   
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The MAH is recommended to review the release and stability specifications for FP SC when 
additional batches are available. 
18 
 
2.  At the end of the Process C/Process D transition period, the MAH should submit a variation 
procedure to duly update the Entyvio Marketing Authorization by removing “Process C” CTD 
sections that are considered no longer relevant. 
3.  On a regular basis from the EMEA/H/C002782/X/0075 line extension approval, the MAH is 
recommended to submit to the Agency a full list of “Process D” batches supplied to EU market until 
the end of the transition period. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Toxicology 
A non-Good Laboratory Practice study utilizing in vitro human cell based assays has been conducted to 
assess the relative immunogenicity risk of vedolizumab Process D drug product compared with 
vedolizumab Process C drug product. Overall, this in vitro immunogenicity compatibility study suggests 
that the IV and SC formulated Process C and D drug products have similar immunogenic responses in 
both healthy and IBD patient donors.  
2.4.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-Good Laboratory Practice study utilizing in vitro human cell based assays has been conducted to 
assess the relative immunogenicity risk of vedolizumab Process D drug product compared with 
vedolizumab Process C drug product. This study suggests a similar immunogenicity risk between the 
old and new vedolizumab process materials and generally low immunogenicity potential for the tested 
Process D drug product. 
The new expression system used with Process D drug product manufacturing, does not alter the 
previous environmental risk assessment on which basis vedolizumab is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment due to its proteic nature (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.4.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Data presented indicate that the new Process D material exhibit the same low immunogenicity 
potential as Process C material in humans, as the ex-vivo assessment demonstrated no meaningful 
differences in immunogenic potential between the test articles.  
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that the clinical trial conducted outside the community 
was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support the quality comparability exercise, the Applicant presented results from a phase 1, open-
label, parallel group clinical study (vedolizumab-1019) investigating in healthy subjects the 
pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, tolerability and safety of single IV (Part A) and SC (Part B) 
injections of vedolizumab manufactured by Process D and C, respectively.  
Analytical methods 
Vedolizumab serum concentrations were determined by using a validated sandwich ELISA, while the 
presence of anti-vedolizumab antibodies and their neutralizing activity were detected and tested 
through ECL assays 
Bioequivalence (biosimilarity) 
Vedolizumab-1019 was an open-label, randomized, parallel-group study to primarily compare the PK of 
a single intravenous (Part A) or subcutaneous (Part B) dose of vedolizumab manufactured via Process 
D or Process C in healthy subjects, whose design is resumed in the following table. 
20 
 
 
The primary endpoint concerned the measurement of vedolizumab Cmax, AUClast and AUC∞. In Part 
A, subjects received a single dose of 300 mg vedolizumab manufactured via Process D or Process C 
administered IV as a 30 minutes-infusion. In Part B, subjects received a single dose of 108 mg/0.68 
mL vedolizumab manufactured via Process D or Process C in a prefilled syringe in needle safe device 
(PFS+NSD) administered SC in the abdomen. In Part A, 76 subjects entered the study and 74 
completed it, while in Part B, 114 subjects entered the study and 111 completed it. In Part A, 8/38 
subjects (21.1%) who received vedolizumab from Process C and 9/38 subjects (23.7%) from Process 
D had deviations leading to the non-collection or exclusion of vedolizumab samples. In Part B, 25/57 
subjects (43.9%) who received Processes C and D had deviations leading to the non-collection or 
exclusion of vedolizumab samples. A post hoc analysis was performed to include all these samples with 
clotting deviations and statistical comparisons of both sets of analysis (primary analysis and post hoc 
additional analysis) confirmed that the clotting deviations did not appear to have an impact on the 
study PK analysis results. 
Results Part A (intravenous) 
A summary of respective serum vedolizumab PK parameters following a single 300 IV dose of 
vedolizumab 300 mg for Process D and Process C is shown below. The variability was similar for 
AUClast and AUC∞ between both treatments, but greater for Process D compared to Process C for 
Cmax, as shown in the following figures. 
21 
 
 
The statistical comparison of serum vedolizumab PK following a single IV dose of vedolizumab 300 mg 
Process D versus Process C (including both AVA-positive and AVA-negative subjects) shows that the 
ratios of geometric LSMs for AUClast, AUC∞ and Cmax were close to unity (100%) and the 90% CIs 
were included in the range 80.00% to 125.00%. 
Results Part B (subcutaneous) 
A summary of respective serum vedolizumab PK parameters following a single SC dose of vedolizumab 
108 mg for Process D and Process C is shown below. The variability of individual AUC last, AUC∞ and 
Cmax values were higher following Process D compared to Process C. 
The statistical comparison of serum vedolizumab PK following a single SC dose of vedolizumab 108 mg 
Process D versus Process C shows that the ratios of geometric LSMs for AUClast, AUC∞ and Cmax and 
the 90% CIs were within 80.00% to 125.00%. 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The Immunogenicity profile of vedolizumab IV 800mg and SC 108 mg manufactured through either 
process C or D was investigated as part of study vedolizumab-1019 (please refer to ‘Bioequivalence’ 
section to see a description of the study).  
In Part A of the study no anti-vedolizumab antibodies positive (AVA+) subjects were identified pre-
dose. The number of AVA+ positive subjects increased at each time point throughout the study. 
22 
 
 
 
Overall, 32/76 (42%) subjects were AVA+ by the end of the study and most of them were persistently 
positive (26/32) and neutralizing (28/32). 17/38 (45%) subjects were AVA+ following Process C 
versus 15/38 (39%) subjects following Process D.  
In Part B, prior to dosing, 3/57 (5%) subjects in the Process D cohort were AVA+, while none were in 
the Process C cohort. The number of AVA+ subjects increased at each time point throughout the study. 
Overall, 68/114 (60%) subjects were AVA+ by the end of the study and most of them were 
persistently positive (55/68) and neutralizing (62/68). 33/57 (58%) subjects following Process C were 
AVA positive versus 35/57 (61%) subjects following Process D. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
From the clinical pharmacokinetics point of view, Phase 1 study CA28095 was well designed and 
conducted in line with both ‘EMA Guideline on Comparability of Biotechnology-derived Medicinal 
Products after a Change in the Manufacturing Process’ (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/101695/2006) and ‘Note 
for guidance on biotechnological/ biological products subject to changes in their manufacturing process’ 
(CPMP/ICH/5721/03). Also, the study conception is aligned in terms of the clinical pharmacology 
investigation with the EMA scientific advice (EMA/SA/0000053520) released in 2021 to the Applicant.  
Drug exposures in terms of AUClast, AUC∞ and Cmax are comparable for vedolizumab manufactured 
either by process C or D, following i.v. or s.c. administration, thus bioequivalence can be considered 
fulfilled. 
In terms of pharmacodynamics, PBMC, a broad and not reliable PD marker for vedolizumab were 
calculated as an exploratory endpoint and no investigation was conducted in terms of inhibition of 
other biomarkers, such as Act-1 and MAdCAM-1-Fc. However, measuring the PD markers in healthy 
subjects is not expected to reflect the performance of these markers in patients with active disease. 
Evaluation of comparability between processes through study vedolizumab-1019 by using 
pharmacodynamics was therefore hampered but do not change the overall conclusion on the 
comparability exercise. 
The immunogenicity profile is similar between Process C and D; overall, the proportion of subjects that 
were AVA positive and neutralizing were comparable between subjects dosed with Processes C and D 
material in both IV and SC. As expected, the occurrence of AVA antibodies was higher in the SC 
groups.   
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There are no clinical pharmacology concerns to the approval of this application. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study Vedulizumab-1019 (A Phase 1, Open-Label, Randomized Parallel Group Study to Assess the 
Pharmacokinetics of Single Intravenous and Subcutaneous Injections of Vedolizumab Administered in 
Healthy Subjects) is described in the pharmacology part of this report and further below in the chapter 
on clinical safety. The study was designed to compare the PK of a single IV (Part A) or SC (Part B) 
dose of vedolizumab manufactured via Process D or Process C in healthy subjects; the target subject 
population (ie, patients with UC or CD) was not considered suitable for this study because of the 
potential for immunogenicity after single-dose administration. Similar PK has been observed in healthy 
subjects and patients with UC or CD following administration of vedolizumab. For these reasons, a 
clinical efficacy evaluation is not necessary to conduct.  
23 
2.5.7.  Clinical safety 
2.5.7.1.  Patient exposure 
The study was designed to assess and compare the PK, safety and tolerability, and immunogenicity 
after a single dose of vedolizumab manufactured by Process D versus vedolizumab manufactured by 
Process C, when administered by intravenous (IV) infusion (Part A) or by subcutaneous (SC) injection. 
The doses, devices, and modes of administration selected were the doses/devices/modes of 
administration approved or under regulatory review for approval.  
The safety monitoring practices included physical examination findings, treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, and 12-lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs).

2.5.7.2.  Adverse events 
A total of 45 TEAEs were reported by 26 (34%) subjects, including 13 (34%) subjects following each of 
Process D and Process C making the distribution of TEAEs between processes equal. Overall, 12 (16%) 
subjects reported 1 or more drug-related TEAE, including 8 (21%) subjects following Process D and 
4 (11%) subjects following Process C. No TEAE was reported by >5% of subjects overall.   
The most commonly reported TEAEs, overall, were diarrhoea and headache (4% subjects each), 
equally distributed between the two processes. 
 A difference could be seen in the incidence of these TEAEs falling in the following SOCs: 
- 
Infections and infestations: 4 (11%) subjects in Process C versus 2 (5%) subjects in Process 
D, mostly driven by an higher incidence of Coronavirus infection in the Process C. 
- 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 1 (3%) subject in Process C versus 4 (11%) 
subjects following Process D, with an higher incidence of pain in extremity in the process C.   
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
General disorders and administration site conditions: 3 (8%) subjects in process C versus 1 
(3%) subject in process D. 
All TEAEs were considered resolved at the end of the trial. 
-  Part B (SC) 
A total of 162 TEAEs were reported by 65 (57%) subjects, including 28 (49%) subjects following 
Process D and 37 (65%) subjects following Process C. Fifty-eight (51%) subjects reported 1 or more 
drug-related TEAEs, including 26 (46%) subjects following Process D and 32 (56%) subjects following 
Process C. 
The most commonly reported TEAEs following Process C and D, respectively, were weight increased 
(25% vs 16%), injection site erythema (9% vs 11%), and headache (12% vs 5%). 
A difference was seen in the TEAEs incidence between the two processes in the following SOCs: 
-  Gastrointestinal disorders: 6 (11%) in Process C versus 3 (5%) in process D, without any clear 
increased incidence of one TEAE in one process in respect to the other;  
-  Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: 9 (16%) subjects in process C versus 3 (5%) 
subjects in process D, mostly driven by back pain, pain in extremity and myalgia in process C;  
-  Nervous System Disorders: 11 (19%) subjects in process C versus 4 (7%) subjects in process 
D, with an higher incidence of headache in process C;  
- 
Infections and Infestations: 8 (14%) subjects in process D versus 5 (9%) subjects in process 
C, mostly driven by an higher incidence of viral infections in process D. The “upper respiratory 
tract infections” are equally distributed between the two processes and in line with what 
reports in the SmPC of the product; 
- 
Eye disorders: 1 (2%) in process C versus 4 (7%) subjects in Process D. 
Other TEAEs by SOCs with a frequency > 5% were “Investigations”, mostly sustained by weight 
increase (25% subjects in process C and 16% in process D) and “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (12% subjects in process C and 7% in process D). In this latter case, the most common 
TEAE was represented by Oropharyngeal pain which was equally distributed between process C (4% 
subjects) and D (5% subjects). 
Most of the TEAE reported were considered as resolved at the end of the study: regarding the “weight 
increase”, they were noted at the final visit and generally ranged from +5 to 10% from baseline, with 
a maximum increase of 12.8%. All increased weight events were considered related to study drug by 
the investigator and 20 of the 23 AEs were considered not recovered/not resolved.

- 
Part A 
A total of 6 (8%) subjects experienced 6 adverse events of special interest (AESIs), including 2 (5%) 
subjects following Process D and 4 (11%) subjects following Process C. All AESIs fell under the 
infections and infestations System Organ Class (SOC), and there was a higher incidence following 
Process C than following Process D. The AESIs included coronavirus infection (2 subjects), urinary tract 
infection (2 subjects), and pharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (1 subject each). 
- 
Part B 
A total of 24% subjects experienced 30 AESIs, including 23% subjects following Process D and 25% 
subjects following Process C. All AESIs were either injection site reactions, which had a higher 
incidence following Process C than Process D (16% subjects versus 11% subjects), or 
infections/infestations which had a higher incidence following Process D than Process C (14% subjects 
versus 9% subjects). The AESIs included injection site reactions (erythema [11 subjects]; pain [3 
subjects]; and hemorrhage and induration [1 subject each]), URTI (5 subjects), viral infection (3 
subjects), and abscess, asymptomatic bacteriuria, cellulitis, cystitis, oral herpes, and pharyngitis 
streptococcal (1 subject each).  
Analysis per Process of AESIs 
The most common AESI reported (Upper respiratory Tract Infection) was equally distributed between 
the two groups (2 subjects in process C and 3 in process D); regarding other infections, a specific 
association between incidence and production process could not be identified by comparing the two 
productive process in both parts of the protocol. Similarly, the incidence of injection site reaction 
(specific for part B) does not identify an association with a specific productive process.   
 No cases of other AESIs were reported; this is considered coherent with the reported incidence in the 
SmPC of other AESIs (infusion related reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, liver injury, PML) and the 
small number of subject enrolled in the protocol. 
26 
 
2.5.7.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The only one SAE recorded in this trial was the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms, which are not 
reported in the SmPC of Vedolizumab as a common site effect. Given the modality of occurrence and 
the previous history of the patient, it is reasonable to not consider this SAE as associated with 
Vedolizumab administration, according to the Investigator’s evaluation. 
2.5.7.4.  Laboratory findings 
No critical alterations of laboratory findings nor in ECG and vital signs were recorded in this trial. Most 
of the alterations in laboratory findings were recorded at the end of the follow up period and, 
consequently, far from the single dose administration of Vedolizumab. In some cases, like CPK 
elevation, subjects’ personal behaviour has had an impact on the insurgence of these alterations. 
Overall, the laboratory finding deviations recorded in the protocol are not considered as related with 
drug administration. 
2.5.7.5.  Safety in special populations 
There was 1 pregnancy reported in Part A, and no pregnancies reported in Part B. 
A subject from Process C had a positive serum pregnancy test at the end of study visit (Day 169). The 
next day, the subject reported having a spontaneous miscarriage and stated she was seen by PCP to 
verify that. A quantitative choriogonadotropin beta level drawn 5 days later was 743.1 IU/L (reference 
range: 0 – 29 IU/L) suggesting that the subject was likely less than a week from expected menses. 
The event was recorded five days after the end of the follow up period (169+5 days) and was not 
considered related with study drug exposure considering that it happened in a time point after 
Vedolizumab exposition which is over the indicated maximum time limit for mandatory use of 
contraception (18 weeks, i.e. 126 days from last administration of Vedolizumab) requested in the 
SmPC of Vedolizumab. Considering the intended scope of this trial, the enrolled population was entirely 
represented by healthy young subjects; therefore, no data about elderly population are available.      
2.5.7.6.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity was an Additional Objective of the study; overall, in terms of safety, the 
immunogenicity profile is similar between Process C and D. The proportion of subjects that were AVA 
positive and neutralizing were comparable between subjects dosed with Processes C and D material in 
both IV and SC. As expected, the occurrence of AVA antibodies was higher in the SC groups, 
considering the higher immunogenicity reported with this administration route.  
27 
Treatment emergent infusion reactions were considered AESIs and are extensively treated in the 
dedicated section: overall, no hypersensitivity reactions in this study were recorded. Reactions related 
to the infusions were recorded only in the SC way of administration, were mild in severity and coherent 
with the administration route (eritheema, hemorrage and pain).  
2.5.8.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A single IV or SC dose of Vedolizumab in healthy subject appeared to be generally safe and well 
tolerated by the healthy adult subjects in this study. The safety profile was comparable following both 
Processes C and D for both SC and IV formulations; no specific safety alerts for the proposed D 
process have emerged in this trial.  
The protocol structure and the follow up period were considered adequate for the rationale of the 
study. Cumulative dose and duration of treatment are not considered able to have impact on the 
safety of the enrolled patients considering that subjects were exposed to a single dose of Vedolizumab. 
No differences were noted in terms of TEAEs between the two processes were noted; the most 
common reported TEAEs (headache, upper respiratory infections, diarrhoea, administration site 
reaction for subcutaneous use) were mild in severity, equally distributed in both part A and B, 
(regardless of the productive process) and considered in line with the published SmPC of the product. 
Some slightly differences were observed in AEs between Process C and Process D in both Part A and 
Part B (eg, AEs in musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder SOCs were reported in a higher 
proportion in Process D in Part A versus Process C in Part B), in absence of clear trends of association 
with the mentioned productive processes. All TEAEs were considered resolved at the end of the 
observation period, except for increasing in weight, but the persistence of the weight gain at the end of 
the observation period is in line with the clinical behaviour of this side effect. 
For the AESIs “infections” and “infusion site reactions” no differences have been identified between the 
two different productive processes.     
One case of SAE is reported (anxiety, paranoia, and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder) in part B 
of the protocol but it is not considered as drug associated.  
Similarly, the reported pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage is not considered related with study 
drug administration. 
28 
 
Regarding immunological events, the occurrence of neutralizing anti-vedolizumab antibodies after 
administration was not shown to be different for vedolizumab manufactured by process C and D: the 
occurrence of neutralizing anti-vedolizumab antibodies tended to be higher after administration of 
subcutaneous vedolizumab, but it is well known that subcutaneous administration route is associated 
with an higher risk of antibody development. In general, attention should be paid to the occurrence of 
neutralizing AVA (regardless of the productive process), considering the elevated percentage of 
development reported in this trial. 
No other safety alerts were raised for laboratory findings deviations and for ECG or vital signs as well 
as new safety issues or signals.  
Overall safety data from this trial should be interpreted with caution, considering that they came from 
a single-dose open-label Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers with limitations in the number of included 
subjects, and in the chosen study design. Long-term evaluation performed with standard 
pharmacovigilance activities in patients with IBD of the clinical safety of multiple administrations of 
vedolizumab manufactured by process D in multiple patients with IBD will provide more insight into the 
overall clinical safety of this active substance. Since no new safety issues were observed in conducted 
Phase 1 study, current safety monitoring may be appropriate for this. 
2.5.9.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
A single IV or SC dose of vedolizumab appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated by the healthy 
adult subjects in this study. No new safety issues were observed in the presented Phase 1 study Long-
term evaluation of the clinical safety performed with standard pharmacovigilance activities in patients 
with IBD and treated with vedolizumab manufactured by process D in patients with IBD will provide 
more insight into the overall clinical safety profile of the active substance. 
2.6.  Risk Management Plan 
The Risk Management Plan (RMP) has not been updated as a result of the new proposed process 
(Process D) for manufacture of vedolizumab drug substance (DS) because that the observed 
differences do not impact quality attributes with potential to impact safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics 
and immunogenicity of vedolizumab.  Therefore, no change to the existing RMP is required. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
No changes were submitted. The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary 
submitted by the MAH fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
No changes to the product information were submitted and this is considered acceptable by the CHMP 
in light of the scope of the manufacturing changes introduced. 
29 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The present line extension procedure refers to the introduction of a new active substance (IV/SC) 
manufacturing process (defined as Process D) based on a new cell bank system derived from a 
different CHO host cell line, a different vedolizumab expression vector, the introduction of a new 
manufacturing and testing site for the new MCB/WCB, as well as additional changes to the 
manufacturing process, including newcell culture media and updated purification steps. 
Ulcerative colitis  
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.  
Crohn’s disease  
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.  
Pouchitis  
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active chronic 
pouchitis, who have undergone proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis 
and have had an inadequate response with or lost response to antibiotic therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The goal of therapy for both UC and CD is to induce and maintain clinical remission, with the optimal 
outcome of maintaining steroid free remission, induction and maintenance of mucosal healing, and 
reduction of complications and the need for hospitalizations and surgery. The standard approach to 
therapy for UC and CD is generally step wise and directed, based on disease activity and the extent 
and location of disease. Treatment of mild disease includes anti-inflammatory agents, progressing to 
more potent therapies for patients who have more severe disease. 
Pharmacological treatments for UC and/or CD vary depending upon the anatomic location of disease, 
the severity of disease, and whether the treatment goal is to induce remission or maintain remission. 
Conventional therapies that are used for IBD include oral 5 aminosalicylates (5 ASAs; eg, sulfasalazine, 
mesalamine), glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone, budesonide), and immunomodulators (eg, azathioprine 
[AZA], 6 mercaptopurine [6 MP], and methotrexate). Orally administered Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor 
(e.g. tofacitinib, filgotinib) have been approved for the treatment of UC. Biologic treatments approved 
for IBD include TNF α antagonists (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab), interleukin antagonists 
(eg, ustekinumab), and integrin antagonists (eg, natalizumab, vedolizumab). 
Vedolizumab IV has demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant effectiveness in 
multiple clinical trials in subjects with moderately to severely active UC or CD with clinically important 
endpoints of durable clinical response, durable clinical remission, mucosal healing, and corticosteroid 
free remission, including subjects who have failed previous therapies such as corticosteroids, 
immunomodulators, or TNF α antagonists. Pharmacological treatments with SC routes of administration 
provide convenience for patients, Health Care Professionals, and caregivers by removing the time, 
30 
logistics, and burden to the health care system required for IV infusion and allows for patient 
preference. As a result, the sponsor has pursued development of vedolizumab SC to allow patients and 
Health Care Professionals the option to choose between IV infusion or SC injection for long term 
maintenance therapy for UC or CD. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In addition to the quality dossier, the supporting package also included non-clinical modules with data 
from an in-vitro (non-GLP) study (TKD-BCS-00379) to assess the relative immunogenicity risk of the 
Entyvio Process D drug products compared with the Entyvio Process C drug products, as well as clinical 
modules with data from a clinical Phase I study (vedolizumab-1019, an open label, randomized parallel 
group study to assess the pharmacokinetics of single intravenous and subcutaneous injections of 
vedolizumab administered to healthy human subjects) conducted to support the comparability between 
Process C and Process D. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy assessment was out of scope of this procedure; no new data in patients was generated. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy assessment was out of scope of this procedure; no new data in patients was generated. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A single IV or SC dose of vedolizumab appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated by the healthy 
adult subjects in study vedolizumab-1019. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Only data in healthy volunteers was presented within study vedolizumab-1019. There are no new 
safety concerns or uncertainties. Long-term evaluation of the clinical safety performed with standard 
pharmacovigilance activities in patients with IBD and treated with vedolizumab manufactured by 
process D in patients with IBD will provide more insight into the overall clinical safety of this active 
substance. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The quality comparability of the active substance vedolizumab produced by the two manufacturing 
processes has been adequately demonstrated, the B/R of Entyvio in the treatment of Ulcerative colitis, 
Crohn’s disease, Pouchitis remains positive, considering the analysis of data provided for this extension 
application.  
In particular, non-clinical and clinical data suggests a similar profile in terms of PK, immunogenicity 
and safety between the two manufacturing processes, for both the IV and SC formulations, with 
consequent absence of impact on the B/R profile. 
Given that data from the submitted clinical trial have been obtained in healthy subjects, a long-term 
evaluation of the clinical safety performed with standard pharmacovigilance activities in patients with 
IBD will provide more insight into the overall clinical safety of this active substance in the intended 
target population. 
31 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Entyvio is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of, Entyvio introducing a new manufacturing process (defined as Process D) for 
vedolizumab active substance (both IV and SC) is favourable in the following approved indication(s): 
Ulcerative colitis  
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.  
Crohn’s disease  
Entyvio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s 
disease who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either

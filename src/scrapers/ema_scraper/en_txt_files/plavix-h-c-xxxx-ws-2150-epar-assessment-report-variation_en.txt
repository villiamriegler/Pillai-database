2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
The currently approved posology of Clopidogrel (Plavix®/Iscover®) in patients suffering from  ACS is as 
below (Plavix® /Iscover® SmPC): 
•  Non-ST  segment  elevation  ACS  (unstable  angina  or  non-Q-wave  myocardial  infarction):  clopidogrel 
treatment should be initiated with a single 300 mg or 600 mg loading dose (LD). A 600 mg LD may be 
considered  in  patients  <75  years  of  age  when  PCI  is  intended.  Clopidogrel  treatment  should  be 
continued at 75 mg once a day (with ASA 75 mg to 325 mg daily). Since higher doses of ASA were 
associated with higher bleeding risk it is recommended that the dose of ASA should not be higher than 
100 mg. The optimal duration of treatment has not been formally established. Clinical trial data support 
use up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months. 
•  ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction: clopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 
75  mg  initiated  with  a  300  mg  LD  in  combination  with  ASA  and  with  or  without  thrombolytics.  For 
medically treated patients over 75 years of age clopidogrel should be initiated without a LD. Combined 
Assessment report  
EMA/55817/2023 
Page 6/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therapy should be started as early as possible after symptoms start and continued for at least 4 weeks. 
The benefit of the combination of clopidogrel with ASA beyond 4 weeks has not been studied in this 
setting. 
The currently approved posology of fixed-dose combination of clopidogrel and ASA (Duoplavin®) in patients 
suffering from ACS is as below (Duoplavin® SmPC): 
• 
• 
In patients with non-ST segment elevation ACS (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction): 
The optimal duration of treatment has not been formally established. Clinical trial data support use up 
to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months. 
In  patients  with  STEMI:  Therapy  should  be  started  as  early  as  possible  after  symptoms  start  and 
continued  for  at  least  4  weeks.  The  benefit  of  the  combination  of  clopidogrel with  ASA  beyond  four 
weeks has not been studied in this setting. 
The MAH is now intending to include the changes below: 
a.  New Indication (Applicable to Plavix® / Iscover® and Duoplavin®) 
- 
Extend the indication in STEMI patients undergoing a stent placement following PCI. 
b.  Posology and Administration 
-  Dosage in STEMI patients (Applicable to Plavix® / Iscover®) - When PCI is intended, the treatment 
with clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg or 600 mg LD. 
- 
Treatment Duration (Applicable to Plavix® / Iscover® and Duoplavin®)  - When PCI is intended, 
the treatment with clopidogrel should be continued at 75 mg once a day, in combination with ASA 
75 mg to 100 mg up to 12 months. Since higher doses of ASA were associated with higher bleeding 
risk, it is recommended that the dose of ASA should not be higher than 100 mg. However, in clinical 
practice the maintenance dose (MD) of ASA prescribing range is 75 mg to 325 mg daily. Combined 
therapy should be started as early as possible after symptoms start and continued daily up to 12 
months (with ASA 75 mg to 100 mg daily). 
The data submitted by the MAH  is based on current clinical guidelines (2013 American College of Cardiology 
Foundation  [ACCF]/American  Heart  Association  [AHA]  guidelines  for  the  management  of  STEMI,  2017 
European Society of Cardiology [ESC] guidelines for the management of STEMI and 2018 ESC/European 
Association  for  Cardio-Thoracic  Surgery  [EACTS]  guidelines  on  myocardial  revascularization)  and  a 
bibliographic review of published studies, retrieved through a comprehensive literature search covering the 
period 2001 to 2021 with the help of the Embase, PubMed, and Google scholar databases. The MAH has 
submitted  a discussion of the existing relevant data on the use of clopidogrel in the treatment of STEMI 
patients  undergoing  PCI  (with  loading  and  maintenances  doses  and  duration  of  treatment).  A    detailed 
literature search methodology has been submitted. 
Source of data: 
The literature for this submission consists of articles under 3 categories: 
•  Supporting indication (clopidogrel with ASA in STEMI patients undergoing PCI); 
•  Supporting LD of clopidogrel (600 mg in STEMI patients undergoing PCI); 
•  Supporting duration (clopidogrel with ASA in STEMI patients after PCI for 12 months). 
LITERATURE SEARCH METHODOLOGY 
Literature search flowchart 
Assessment report  
EMA/55817/2023 
Page 7/43 
 
 
 
 
The literature review flowchart provided in Figure above details the 17 articles that were identified from the 
literature  search  databases  and  included  in  the  analysis.  The  literature  comprised  articles  under  3 
categories: 
•  Supporting  indication  (use  of  clopidogrel  with  ASA  in  ST-elevation  myocardial  infarction  [STEMI] 
patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] 
•  Supporting loading dose of clopidogrel (use of 600 mg loading dose [LD] in STEMI patients undergoing 
PCI) 
•  Supporting duration (duration of use of clopidogrel with ASA in STEMI patients after PCI). 
Epidemiology  
ST elevation acute myocardial infarction is  defined by characteristic symptoms of myocardial ischemia in 
association  with  persistent  electrocardiographic  ST  elevation  and  subsequent  release  of  biomarkers  of 
myocardial necrosis. ST elevation acute myocardial infarction comprises approximately 25% to 40% of MI 
presentations. 
Management 
In STEMI patients, clinical guidelines recommend a primary PCI strategy over fibrinolysis within indicated 
timeframes. Treatment guidelines also recommend adjunctive antithrombotic therapy with ASA and P2Y12 
inhibitors  (clopidogrel,  prasugrel,  or  ticagrelor)  to  support  reperfusion  with  primary  PCI  and  maintained 
over 12 months. 
The  currently  approved  posology  of  Clopidogrel  (Plavix/Iscover)  in  patients  suffering  from  ACS  is  the 
following: 
• Non-ST segment elevation ACS (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction): 
Assessment report  
EMA/55817/2023 
Page 8/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
clopidogrel treatment should be initiated with a single 300 mg or 600 mg loading dose (LD). A 600 
mg LD may be considered in patients <75 years of age when PCI is intended. Clopidogrel treatment 
should be continued at 75 mg once a day (with ASA 75 mg to 325 mg daily). Since higher doses of 
ASA were associated with higher bleeding risk it is recommended that the dose of ASA should not 
be  higher  than  100  mg.  The  optimal  duration  of  treatment  has  not  been  formally  established. 
Clinical trial data support use up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months. 
• ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction:  
- 
clopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg initiated with a 300 mg LD in combination 
with ASA and with or without thrombolytics. For medically treated patients over 75 years of age 
clopidogrel  should  be  initiated  without  a  LD.  Combined  therapy  should  be  started  as  early  as 
possible after symptoms start and continued for at least 4 weeks. The benefit of the combination 
of clopidogrel with ASA beyond 4 weeks has not been studied in this setting. 
The currently approved posology of fixed-dose combination of clopidogrel and ASA (Duoplavin®) in patients 
suffering from ACS is the following: 
•  In  patients  with  non-ST  segment  elevation  ACS  (unstable  angina  or  non-Q-wave  myocardial 
infarction):  
- 
The optimal duration of treatment has not been formally established. Clinical trial data support use 
up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months. 
•  In  patients  with  STEMI:  Therapy  should  be  started  as  early  as  possible  after  symptoms  start  and 
continued for at least 4 weeks. The benefit of the combination of clopidogrel with ASA beyond four weeks 
has not been studied in this setting.

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The ERA report for clopidogrel was updated in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 2006). The ERA was 
performed on the basis of available results from previously referenced study reports in previous approved 
products, and all relevant reports to the present ERA  were provided. The additional data provide sound 
evidence that the ERA for clopidogrel is documented according to the ERA guidelines. 
The  ERA  initially  submitted  by  the  MAH  for  Acetylsalicylic  Acid  was  incomplete  and  the  study  results 
presented did not provide significant data to assess the effect of ASA in the environment. The MAH updated 
the report and provided significant data. It  should be noted that although the value the PECsw  value is 
higher  than  the  action 
limit  of  0.01  g/L, 
it  must  be  calculated  according  to  guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010, rev1, 2016. 
Information have been given by the applicant as requested and is now considered sufficient to assess the 
environmental risk of clopidogrel. A conclusion on potential risk of DuoPlavin to the environment cannot 
be drawn as the applicant did not provide a complete ERA according to the requirements of the guideline 
on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 
Corr 2) for the active ingredient acetylsalicylic acid. 
To complete the Phase II assessment in accordance with the ERA guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 
corr 2, 2006, and in the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP requests submission of the following study reports as soon as they are available and 
no later than January 2023:  
Partition coefficient, OECD 107, study no. T101857-2, report no. R-9744 
Fish FELS study, OECD 210, study no. T100876-2, report no. R-9273 
Biodegradation study, OECD 301F, study no.T101073-2, report no. PH-37791 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A final conclusion on potential risk of DuoPlavin to the environment is pending. The CHMP requests  the 
MAH to  provide a complete ERA according to the requirements of the guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  Corr  2)  for  the  active 
ingredient acetylsalicylic acid no later than January 2023. The applicant committed to providing the Letter 
of Access and /or studies reports as soon as they are available, no later than January 2023. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
GCP 
2.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The proposed changes apply to the three medicinal products (Plavix, Iscover and DuoPlavin) containing 
clopidogrel. The same supportive documentation is provided for the three products which belong to the 
same MAH, and similar labelling changes will apply to the three medicinal products (SmPC and Package 
leaflet). 
Assessment report  
EMA/55817/2023 
Page 13/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No new pharmacokinetic studies were conducted by the MAH, and the proposed changes are supported 
by an overall level of clinical evidence (efficacy and safety data) from different sources. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  applicant  proposes  to  add  “patients  undergoing  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI)”  to  the 
population already included in the therapeutic indication of clopidogrel in combination with acetylsalicylic 
acid (ASA): patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome with ST segment elevation acute myocardial 
infarction (STEMI). 
No dedicated pharmacodynamics (PD) study is provided. The rational to include “patients with ST segment 
elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction,  undergoing  percutaneous  coronary  intervention”  (STEMI  patients 
undergoing  PCI)  is  based  on  clinical  evidence  from  bibliographic  review  of  3  randomized  trials  and  one 
observational trial (2005-2008) that provide PD data on the proposed new patient population, treated with

respectively;  p<0.001).  Among  the  patients  with  high  post-PA  (>75th  percentile  aggregation  after 
clopidogrel intake), after 300 mg clopidogrel, 62%-65% had NR, whereas after the 600 mg dose, all 
of the patients with high post-PA had NR.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No  dedicated  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  study  is  provided.  The  rationale  to  include  the  proposed  new 
population of STEMI patients undergoing PCI is based on bibliographic data relevant for PD assessment of 
3 randomised trials and one observational trial that compares the PD aspects of 600 mg LD of clopidogrel 
versus the standard dose (300 mg) in patients with acute coronary disease undergoing elective coronary 
stenting. 
The presented studies support the strategy based on the 600 mg LD (as compared with the standard 300 
mg LD) that shortens time to maximal platelet inhibition compared with 300 mg and results in superior 
antiplatelet effect that is maintained up to 24 hours without increasing bleeding risk, providing sufficient 
protection in patients undergoing PCI. 
According to the results from these studies, although with some limitations related to small sample size, 
the dose-related effect of clopidogrel may contribute to the overall antithrombotic properties of the drug in 
patients undergoing stenting, with the effect being more prominent in patients receiving 600 mg, making 
the higher dose more effective than the standard 300-mg dose. 
The pharmacodynamic data presented supports a superior efficacy and greater inhibition of platelet function 
with 600 mg LD compared with 300 mg LD of clopidogrel in patients suffering from ACS undergoing PCI. 
The SmPC amendments proposed by the applicant to update the posology information for STEMI patients 
undergoing PCI, are in line with these results and can be therefore acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion  on clinical pharmacology 
No new pharmacokinetic studies were conducted by the MAH, and the proposed changes are supported by 
an overall level of clinical evidence (efficacy and safety data) from different sources. 
The pharmacodynamic data presented supports the strategy based on the 600 mg LD (as compared with 
the  standard  300  mg  LD)  that  shortens  time  to  maximal  platelet  inhibition  compared  with  300  mg  and 
results in superior antiplatelet effect that is maintained up to 24 hours without increasing bleeding risk, 
providing sufficient protection in patients undergoing PCI. From a clinical pharmacodynamic point of view, 
Assessment report

the loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel has shown to have greater inhibition of platelet function in patients 
suffering from ACS undergoing PCI and this variation is approvable.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
ACCF/AHA guidelines for the management of ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction (2013) 
Antiplatelet Therapy to Support Primary PCI 
The guidelines recommends that a loading dose of a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor should be given as early as 
possible or at the time of primary PCI to patients with STEMI. One of the options recommended is a loading 
dose of 600 mg of aspirin along with a loading dose of aspirin 162-325 mg (Class of recommendation I, 
Level of evidence B). Further, the guidelines recommend that P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be given for 
1 year to patients with STEMI who receive a stent (bare metal stent or drug-eluting stent) during primary 
PCI, with one of the recommended options being a MD of clopidogrel 75 mg daily along with daily MD of 
aspirin 81 to 325 mg (Class of recommendation I, Level of evidence B and Class of recommendation IIb, 
Level of evidence C respectively).  
The guidelines also state that a loading dose of 600  mg of clopidogrel is preferred to a 300 mg loading 
dose, given the more extensive and rapid platelet inhibition achieved with the higher dose, as well as the 
beneficial effects reported in a clopidogrel and aspirin optimal dose usage to reduce recurrent events.  
Antiplatelet Therapy to Support Reperfusion with Fibrinolytic Therapy 
In patients with STEMI who receive fibrinolytic therapy, the guidelines recommend the use of aspirin (162 
mg to 325 mg LD) and clopidogrel for patients ≤75 years of age (300 mg LD), >75 years of age (75 mg 
dose) (Class of recommendation I, Level of evidence A). The guidelines further specify that aspirin should 
be continued indefinitely (81 mg to 325 mg MD) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily MD) should be continued for 
at least 14 days and up to 1 year in patients with STEMI who receive fibrinolytic therapy 
Antiplatelet Therapy to Support PCI After Fibrinolytic Therapy 
With regards  to antiplatelet therapy to support PCI after  fibrinolytic therapy,  the guideline recommends 
that aspirin should be continued indefinitely after PCI. In addition, clopidogrel should be provided as follows: 
A) A 300 mg LD should be given before or at the time of PCI to patients who did not receive a previous LD 
and who are undergoing PCI within 24 hours of receiving fibrinolytic therapy (Class of recommendation I, 
Level of evidence C).  
B) A 600 mg LD should be given before or at the time of PCI to patients who did not receive a previous LD 
and  who  are  undergoing  PCI  more  than  24  hours  after  receiving  fibrinolytic  therapy  (Class  of 
recommendation I, Level of evidence C). 
C) A dose of 75 mg daily should be given after PCI as a MD along with aspirin 81 to 325 mg. (Class of 
recommendation I, Level of evidence C).

ESC Guidelines for the management of acute myocardial infarction in patients 
presenting with ST-segment elevation (2017) 
Antiplatelet Therapy to Support Primary PCI 
The ESC guidelines recommend that as periprocedural pharmacotherapy, patients undergoing primary 
PCI should receive DAPT, a combination of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, and a parenteral Anticoagulant. 
It is stated in the guidelines that “A potent P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor), or clopidogrel if these 
are  not  available  or  are  contraindicated,  is  recommended  before  (or  at  latest  at  the  time  of)  PCI  and 
maintained over 12 months, unless there are contraindications such as excessive risk of bleeding “ (Class 
I, level A).  
A table published in the ESC guidelines indicates the use of clopidogrel at a LD of 600 mg followed by a MD 
of  75  mg  in  patients  undergoing  primary  PCI.  Maintenance  dose  of  aspirin  recommended  is  75  to  100 
mg/day. There is no class or level of recommendation attached to these dosages in the ESC guidelines.  
ESC / EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization (2018) 
These guidelines recommend that Dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA and clopidogrel is recommended for 
patients undergoing CAS for a duration of at least 1 month (Class of recommendation I, Level of evidence 
B).  In  patients  undergoing  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  with  stable  coronary  artery  disease,  the 
guidelines suggest dual antiplatelet therapy including a 150–300 mg oral loading dose of acetylsalicylic acid 
(or 80–150 mg i.v.) followed by 75–100mg per os (p.o.) daily plus a clopidogrel 300–600 mg loading dose 
followed by 75 mg daily 
In  STEMI  patients  undergoing  PCI,  the  guidelines  recommend  a  potent  P2Y12  inhibitor  (prasugrel  or 
ticagrelor), or clopidogrel if these are not available or are contraindicated, is recommended before (or at 
the time of PCI at the latest) PCI and should be maintained over 12 months along with aspirin, unless there 
are contraindications such as an excessive risk of bleeding 
1.1.1.  Main studies  
Clinical efficacy of clopidogrel in combination with ASA in STEMI patients undergoing PCI was demonstrated 
in a randomized clinical trial (CLARITY, Sabatine et al. 2005) and in a prespecified subgroup analysis of the 
same trial (CLARITY PCI, Sabatine et al. 2005). 
An overview of this studies is shown in Table 2.

Table 2 – Overview of the CLARITY and CLARITY-PCI studies  
The CLARITY-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction  (TIMI)  28 was  a randomized, double blind, placebo-
controlled trial of clopidogrel in patients receiving fibrinolytics for STEMI. The purpose of the study was to 
determine if the addition of clopidogrel was beneficial in patients who have STEMI and who are receiving a 
standard fibrinolytic regimen, including aspirin. The study involved 3491 patients with STEMI randomized 
to either clopidogrel 300 mg LD (n=1752) or placebo (n = 1739). All patients received aspirin (150 to 325 
mg) on first day and then 75 to 162 mg daily.  
The PCI-CLARITY was a prospectively planned analysis of CLARITY TIMI 28. This analysis was conducted to 
determine if clopidogrel pre-treatment before PCI in patients with recent STEMI was superior to clopidogrel 
treatment initiated at the time of PCI in preventing MACE. The analysis involved 1863 patients undergoing 
PCI, randomized to either clopidogrel 300 mg LD (n=933) or placebo (n = 930). All patients received aspirin 
(150 to 325 mg) on first day and then 75 to 162 mg daily. Patients receiving 300 mg LD of clopidogrel had

a significant reduction in incidence of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke following PCI compared to those 
receiving  placebo  (3.6%  with  clopidogrel  pre-treatment  versus  6.2%  with  placebo,  p=0.008).  Also,  the 
patients receiving 300 mg LD of clopidogrel had a significant reduction in incidence of 
cardiovascular  death,  MI  or  stroke  through  30  days  following  PCI  compared  to  those  receiving  placebo 
(7.5% with clopidogrel pre-treatment versus 12.0% with placebo, p=0.001). No significant difference was 
observed in the rates of major or minor bleeding between both the treatments (2.0% with clopidogrel pre-
treatment  versus  1.9%  with  placebo,  p>0.99).  The  findings  of  this  analysis  support  the  early  use  of 
clopidogrel in STEMI and the strategy of routine clopidogrel pre-treatment in patients undergoing PCI. 
Studies showing the efficacy of a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel are shown in Table 3.

The CURRENT-OASIS-7 trial was undertaken to assess whether doubling of the loading and 
maintenance doses of clopidogrel was superior to the standard dose regimen and whether higher 
dose aspirin (300 to 325 mg/day) was superior to lower-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg/day) in patients 
with ACS (NSTEMI or STEMI) referred for an early invasive strategy. A total of 25,086 patients were enrolled 
in the trial, of whom 24,835 underwent coronary angiography and 17,263 underwent PCI. The trial had a 
2x2 factorial design, and the enrolled patients were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to a double-
dose clopidogrel regimen or to the standard-dose regimen. In the second component of the factorial design, 
patients were randomized in an open-label fashion to either a high- or low-dose aspirin. Post-randomization 
and before coronary angiography, patients assigned to double-dose clopidogrel received a LD of 600 mg 
on Day 1, followed by 150 mg once daily from Day 2 through Day 7. Patients assigned to the standard-
dose clopidogrel received a LD of 300 mg on Day 1, followed by 75 mg once daily from Day 2 through Day 
7. On Day 8 through Day 30, both the trial groups received 75 mg of 
clopidogrel once daily. From Day 2 through Day 30, patients randomly assigned to lower-dose 
aspirin received 75 to 100 mg/day, whereas patients assigned to higher-dose aspirin received 300 to 325 
mg/day. The key inference drawn from the trial was that there was no significant difference

between a 7-day double-dose regimen of clopidogrel and standard-dose clopidogrel with respect 
to the primary outcomes of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke (4.2% versus 4.4%; hazard ratio 
[HR]: 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-1.06; p=0.30), or death (2.3% versus 2.4%; 
HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.82-1.13; p=0.61) at 30 days. The increased incidence of the major and severe 
bleeding was accounted for mainly by a higher rate of red blood cell transfusion among patients in 
the  double-dose  group,  which  may  be  attributed  to  a  double  MD  of  150  mg.  There  was  a  significantly 
reduced  incidence  of  the  secondary  endpoint  of  stent  thrombosis,  including  angiographically  confirmed 
definite stent thrombosis, in the subgroup of patients who underwent PCI with double-dose clopidogrel 
compared with the standard treatment (1.6% versus 2.3%; HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.55-0.85; p=0.001). 
A pre-specified subgroup analysis assessed the effects of various clopidogrel and aspirin regimens in the 
prevention  of  major  cardiovascular  events  and  stent  thrombosis  in  patients  undergoing  PCI  (NSTEMI  or 
STEMI). The composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was significantly lower in 
the double-dose group when compared to the standard group (3.9% versus 4.5%; adjusted HR: 0.86; 95% 
CI:  0.74-0.99;  p=0.039)  at  30  days.  The  primary  composite  outcome,  recurrent  ischemia,  individual 
components of the composite outcomes, and stent thrombosis was significantly lower in the double-dose 
than in the standard-dose clopidogrel group (4.2% versus 5.0%; adjusted HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.98; 
p=0.025).  Furthermore,  the  rate  of  definite  stent  thrombosis  was  lower  with  double-dose  compared  to 
standard-dose clopidogrel on Day 2 (0.2% versus 0.4%; HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27-0.89, p=0.018), and from 
Day 3 through Day 10 (0.4% versus 0.6%; 0.58, 0.37-0.90, p=0.016). CURRENT-defined major bleeding 
overall was more common with double-dose clopidogrel compared with the standard dose (1.6% versus 
1.1%;  adjusted  HR:  1.41,  95%  CI  1.09-1.83,  p=0.009).  Similarly,  a  statistically  significant  increase  of 
major bleeding was reported in the clopidogrel 600 mg LD group (1.5% [130/8560 patients]) compared to 
the clopidogrel 300 mg LD group (1.1% [95/8703 patients]) inpatients after PCI (p=0.0141). The analysis 
concluded that a 7-day, 600 mg LD regimen of clopidogrel (600 mg LD followed by a MD [150 mg for 7 
days]) is more effective than the standard-dose regimen in reducing ischemic events and stent thrombosis 
in patients undergoing PCI for ACS. 
The  Antiplatelet  therapy  for  Reduction  of  Myocardial  Damage  during  Angioplasty  -  Myocardial  Infarction 
(ARMYDA-6 MI) trial was  conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pre-treatment with a 600 mg 
versus 300 mg clopidogrel LD in the setting of urgent PCI for STEMI. This randomized, prospective, 
international, multicenter trial involved 201 patients with acute MI randomized to either a 600 mg (n=103) 
or 300 mg LD (n=98) of clopidogrel at the time of first medical contact at the trial center performing the 
primary angioplasty followed by intervention as per standard technique. Patients receiving a 600 mg LD of 
clopidogrel had a significantly reduced infarct size compared to those receiving a 300 mg LD (median CK-
MB=2070 ng/mL [interquartile range {IQR}: 815 to 2847 ng/mL versus median CK-MB=3049 ng/mL {IQR: 
1050 to 7031 ng/mL}] p=0.0001); (troponin-I, 255 ng/mL [IQR: 130 to 461 ng/mL] versus 380 ng/mL 
[IQR: 134 to 1406 ng/mL]; p<0.0001). The  TIMI flow Grade <3 after  the  intervention was found to be 
significantly lower for the 600 mg LD group compared with the 300 mg LD 
group (5.8%, versus 16.3%; p=0.031). Left ventricular ejection fraction at discharge was found to 
be higher  in the 600 mg LD  group  compared  with 300  mg LD  group (52.1 ±9.5% versus 48.8±11.3%; 
p=0.026). The 30-day MACE incidence was found to be reduced in the 600 mg LD group compared with 
the 300 mg group (5.8% versus 15.0%; p=0.049). There was no difference observed between the 2 groups

with respect to safety: major bleeding at 1 month occurred in 1.9% in the 600 mg LD group as against 
2.0% in the 300 mg LD group (p=0.65). Non-entry–site minor bleeding was 7.8% and 6.1% for the 600 
mg LD and 300 mg LD groups, respectively (p=0.86). 
Entry-site complications were observed in 2.9% and 3.1% of patients in the 600 mg LD and 300 mg LD 
groups, respectively.  
This post-hoc analysis of the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial 
Infarction  (HORIZONS-AMI)  trial  was  conducted  to  evaluate  whether  a  600  mg  LD  provided  faster  and 
greater inhibition of platelet activation. The analysis examined the impact of a LD of 600 mg compared with 
300  mg  on  30-day  clinical  outcomes  in  3311  patients  from  the  main  trial  (n=1153;  300  mg  LD  group; 
n=2158; 600 mg LD group) before cardiac catheterization followed by 75 mg/day dose for ≥6 months post-
discharge. The results showed significantly lower 30-day unadjusted rates of mortality (1.9% versus 3.1%, 
p=0.03), reinfarction (1.3% versus 2.3%, p=0.02), and definite or probable stent thrombosis (1.7% versus 
2.8%, p=0.04) with the 600 mg LD. In addition, the 600 mg LD of clopidogrel was an independent predictor 
of 30-day MACE (HR: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.53-0.98]; p=0.04). Major bleeding rate (non-coronary artery bypass 
graft [CABG] related) was 6.1% in 600 mg LD group and 9.4% in 300 mg LD group (p=0.0005). Minor 
bleeding rate was 11.3% in 600 mg LD group and 13.8% in 300 mg LD group (p=0.03). 
The authors identified that although the clopidogrel LD was stratified before randomization, the  300 mg 
versus  600  mg  LD  was  not  randomized,  which  resulted  in  an  imbalance  between  several  baseline, 
angiographic, and procedural characteristics.  
In a registry study performed at a single center in Belgium, the authors analyzed whether a higher LD (600 
mg) of clopidogrel was associated with better procedural and one-year clinical outcomes compared to  a 
standard 300 mg LD. A total of 255 patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI were included in the 
study and were divided into the 600 mg (n=157) and 300 mg (n=98) LD groups. Patients who received a 
600 mg LD of clopidogrel showed a significantly lower incidence of post-PCI myocardial blush Grade 0 or 1 
(OR:  0.64,  95%  CI:  0.43-0.96,  p=0.03)  and  less  common  no-reflow  phenomenon  (OR:  0.38,  95%  CI: 
0.15-0.98, p=0.04) when compared to patients who received a 300 mg LD of clopidogrel. 
The higher-dose group also had a relatively lower occurrence rate of MACE when compared to the lower-
dose group (17% versus 27%; HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38-1.00, p=0.05) at 1 year. 
A retrospective trial that was conducted to investigate whether 600 mg LD of clopidogrel, when compared 
to 300 mg dose, was more beneficial in inhibiting platelet aggregation more rapidly in acute STEMI patients. 
The  study  included  171  patients  with  STEMI  who  underwent  primary  PCI  between  January  2004  and 
December  2005.  The  patients  were  administered  either  300  mg  (n=98)  or  600  mg  (n=73)  clopidogrel 
before PCI and aspirin (at least 100 mg/day) indefinitely with a maintenance clopidogrel dose of 75 mg/day 
for  up to  9 months.  The  cumulative incidence  of  death,  MI,  stroke,  and urgent  revascularization  due  to 
myocardial ischemia within 30 days of PCI was significantly lower in the higher-dose group 
compared to the standard 300 mg group (1.4% versus 11.2%; p=0.013). A total of 5 urgent TVRs 
occurred in the 300 mg group, while none occurred in the higher-dose group. There were 2 incidences of 
major bleeding (2.7%) observed with 600 mg LD group and 1 incidence of major bleeding (1.0%) observed 
with 300 mg LD group (p=0.671).The limitations of the trial included its retrospective nature; small sample

Real world use of clopidogrel in ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients 
Five studies reported on dosing of clopidogrel. Loading doses varied from 75 mg to 600 mg, while 
maintenance dosing was either 75 mg or 150 mg. The summary of these studies is represented in Table 
6. 
The real-world evidence indicates that the use of PCI has increased over time in STEMI patients.  The use 
of thrombolytic therapy as well as fibrinolytic therapy showed decreasing trends over time. Use of 
clopidogrel following PCI, thrombolysis, or fibrinolysis varies, with a majority of the studies identified 
reporting a range between 40% to 100%. Five studies reported on dosing of clopidogrel following PCI or 
thrombolytic/fibrinolytic treatment. Findings from these were consistent, with 3 studies reporting a 
loading dose of 600 mg, one study reporting initial doses between 75 mg and>300mg, and the other 
study reporting a 300 mg loading dose.

2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  literature  supporting  the  use  of  clopidogrel  with  ASA  in  STEMI  patients  undergoing  PCI  includes  a 
publication  of  one  randomized  trial  (Clopidogrel  as  adjunctive  reperfusion  therapy  [CLARITY])  involving 
3491 patients with STEMI and the other publication containing a prespecified subgroup analysis in 1863 
patients of CLARITY trial undergoing PCI (CLARITY PCI study).  CLARITY PCI is the prospectively planned 
subgroup  analysis  of  CLARITY  trial  evaluating  the  effect  of  clopidogrel  LD  before  PCI  in  STEMI  patients 
followed by MD of clopidogrel as well as ASA. CLARITY PCI showed significant reduction in efficacy outcomes 
(incidence of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke) at Day 30. 
The methodology of literature search for use of clopidogrel 600 mg LD in STEMI patients undergoing PCI 
was similar to the one followed for previous variation dossier submitted on 27-Mar-2020 for clopidogrel 600 
mg LD in ACS with exclusion of studies having patients with only NSTEMI indication or non-specific ACS 
subgroup.  The  included  RCTs  showed  higher  efficacy  for  the  600  mg  LD  with  better  or  similar  safety 
outcomes compared with the standard 300 mg LD. The efficacy profile was reflected through a significant 
decrease in composite as well as individual outcomes of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke with clopidogrel 
after 12 months treatment. Cumulative evidence shows that the 600 mg LD is at least as effective as the 
300 mg LD.  
Three  meta-analyses  including  studies  published  between  the  years  2009  and  2012  highlight  the 
effectiveness of the higher (600 mg) clopidogrel dose compared with the standard 300 mg dose. The meta-
analyses showed significant reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality in the absence of a significant 
effect on major bleeding episodes. 
Literature supporting the effective duration of use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) of clopidogrel with 
ASA in STEMI patients after PCI includes two publications containing a large randomized clinical trial in each 
(Clopidogrel  for  the  reduction  of  events  during  observation  [CREDO]  involving  2116  patients  and  The 
efficacy  of  Xience/Promus  versus  Cypher  to  reduce  late  loss  after  stenting  [EXCELLENT]  involving  1443 
patients).  Guidelines  recommend  adjunctive  antithrombotic  therapy  with  ASA  and  P2Y12  inhibitors 
(clopidogrel,  prasugrel,  or  ticagrelor)  in  primary  PCI  and  maintained  over  12  months  in  STEMI  patients 
undergoing primary PCI. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Taking into account the data shown by the MAH there is supportive evidence for inclusion, in the Product 
Information of new indication for clopidogrel and combination of clopidogrel with ASA (In STEMI undergoing 
PCI) and of posology and administration (Dosage in STEMI patients: 300 mg or 600 mg LD of clopidogrel 
when PCI is intended; Treatment duration: 12 months for MD). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety review was focused on the available literature. Among the articles identified for the use of clopidogrel 
in STEMI patients undergoing PCI indication, a total of 12 publications reported safety data. The main and

well-known risk of clopidogrel was bleeding (major and/or minor) and was reported either as part of safety 
data or as a part of study end points in all these 12 publications.  
The adverse events in publications focused on bleeding and death.

Adverse events 
Safety of Clopidogrel in combination with ASA in STEMI Patients undergoing PCI 
-  Sabatine et al. 2005 study reported no significant difference in the rates of major or minor bleeding 
(3.4% with clopidogrel pre-treatment [300 mg LD] versus 2.7% with placebo, p=0.24) at Day 30. 
-  Sabatine et al. 2005 study reported no significant difference in the rates of major or minor bleeding 
between  clopidogrel  300  mg  LD  and  placebo  (18  cases  [2.0%]  with  clopidogrel  pre-treatment 
versus 17 cases [1.9%] with placebo, p>0.99) at Day 30. 
Safety of 600 mg Loading Dose of Clopidogrel in STEMI Patients Undergoing PCI 
The safety of each individual study is described below: 
• Abuzahra et al., 2008 study reported no significant difference between major or minor bleeding at day-
30 for the 300 mg LD and 600 mg LD clopidogrel  groups. For major bleeding, one case was reported in 
each group (1.6% with 600 mg, 2.7% with 300 mg, p=0.73). For the minor bleeding episodes, 2 and 3 
cases were reported with the 600 mg (3.1%) and 300 mg (8.1%) (p=0.53) LD groups, respectively. 
• Patti et al., 2011 study reported no significant increase in bleeding or entry-site complications at Day 30 
of the study. A total of 2 major bleeding episodes each occurred in 300 mg LD and 600 mg LD clopidogrel 
groups,  respectively.  Furthermore,  no  increase  in  entry-site  complications  (hematoma  >10  cm, 
pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula) was observed in the 2 groups. 
•  Dangas et al.,  2009 reported no significant increase  in bleeding rates with a higher LD  of clopidogrel. 
Major bleeding rate (non-CABG related) was 6.1% in the clopidogrel 600 mg LD group and 9.4% in the 
clopidogrel 300 mg LD group, respectively. 
• 
In  a  retrospective  study  by  Jung  et  al.,  2009,  bleeding  data  showed  no  significant  increase  in  the 
frequency  of  major  bleeding  with  600  mg  LD  group  as  compared  to  300  mg  LD  group.  There  were  2 
incidences of major bleeding (2.7%) observed with 600 mg LD group and 1 incidence of major bleeding 
(1.0%) observed with 300 mg LD group (p=0.671). This study was considered less relevant because it was 
subject to multiple types of bias and particularly channeling biases. 
•  In  a  clinical  trial  (CURRENT-OASIS  7),  the  patients  were  not  treated  with  the  standard  maintenance 
therapeutic dose, ie, the clopidogrel LD was followed by a high clopidogrel MD of 150 mg/day for one-week 
in  the  600  mg  LD  group  (n=2  publications  for  one  study  [Mehta  2010  et  al.]).  This  study  reported  a 
statistically significant increase of major bleeding in the clopidogrel 600 mg LD  group (1.5% [130/8560 
patients]) compared to the clopidogrel 300 mg LD group (1.1% [95/8703 patients]) in patients after PCI 
(p=0.0141).

Safety of Long Term (12 Months) Treatment with Clopidogrel in combination with 
ASA in STEMI Patients after PCI 
• Steinhubl et  al.,  2002  study  reported no  significant  increase  in  the  rate  of  major  bleeding  (8.8%  with 
clopidogrel versus 6.7% with placebo, p=0.07) or minor bleeding (5.3% with clopidogrel versus 5.6% 
with placebo, p=0.84) at 1 year. 
• Gwon et al., 2012 study reported no significant difference in the safety end point (composite of death, 
MI, stroke, stent thrombosis or TIMI major bleeding)  between  6--month DAPT (receiving  clopidogrel  75 
mg/day for 6 months) and 12-month DAPT (receiving clopidogrel 75 mg/day for 12 months) groups (HR: 
1.15; 95% CI: 0.64-2.06; p=0.64) at 1 year. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths,  when  reported  in  the  publications,  were  part  of  the  efficacy  endpoints  (either  all  deaths  or 
cardiovascular deaths). For the death cases presented in the publications, there are no details on the nature 
of the event leading to death.  
Among the studies entered in a meta-analysis, only 5 included an analysis regarding death; and the analysis 
concluded no significant differences in death between the 2 clopidogrel LD groups (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.62-
1.09; p=0.17).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  analysis  of  the  safety  data  for  the  use  of  clopidogrel  in  combination  with  ASA  in  STEMI  patients 
undergoing PCI in CLARITY study and CLARITY PCI subgroup analysis showed overall no significant increase 
in bleeding with clopidogrel versus placebo. 
The analysis of the safety data for the higher clopidogrel LD (600 mg) in comparison to the standard 300 
mg LD, focused on the review of bleeding and death available in 8 publications. Among these, only 3 clinical 
trials were fully relevant for the safety analysis due to their study design (randomized and controlled) and 
also because they were conducted with the standard 75 mg/day MD after the LD. In these 3 studies, the 
clopidogrel 600 mg LD showed no evidence of an increase in bleeding. The result of the retrospective study 
showed  the  clopidogrel  600  mg  LD  to  be  as  safe  as  the  clopidogrel  300  mg  LD  while  considering  the 
bleeding. It was also identified that increasing the MD of clopidogrel (150 mg/day instead of 75 mg/day) 
after the clopidogrel 600 mg LD may increase the risk of major bleeding. 
The analysis of the safety data for the long term (12 months) treatment with clopidogrel in combination 
with ASA in STEMI patients after PCI in CREDO  study showed no significant increase in major or minor 
bleeding at 1 year whereas EXCELLENT study showed no difference in safety endpoint (composite of death, 
MI, stroke, stent thrombosis or TIMI major bleeding) between 6-month and 12-month DAPT. 
Although deaths were analyzed as part of the efficacy endpoints of the studies, in an effort to 
review them, the meta-analysis by Vyas et al. 2014 was selected for its relevance and showed comparable 
rate of death between the 2 LD groups. 
The  MAH  recognized  that,  overall,  there  was  a  lack  of  data  regarding  patients  >75  years-old.  The  MAH 
presented data regarding the CURRENT OASIS 7 study that reported data in the subset of patients >75 
years old. This study showed consistency in the treatment effect for each dose comparison in predefined 
subgroups.  Consistent  effects  were  recorded  with  the  double-dose  clopidogrel  regimen  in  patients  with 
STEMI and patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. There was no significant 
interaction for weight <60 kg or >60 kg, age below and over 75 years and previous stroke (p for interaction 
0.614). In this trial, clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose has shown consistent efficacy in patients age ≥75 
years of age and patients <75 years of age. Although the CURRENT OASIS 7 study has shown statistically 
significance  in  reducing  cardiovascular  death,  MI,  stroke  and  stent  thrombosis,  thus  supporting  the 
recommendation of 600 mg clopidogrel regimen for patients ≥ 75 years old, the MAH recommends that the 
loading  dose  of  600  mg  clopidogrel  in  STEMI  PCI  patients  may  be  considered  based  on  an  individual 
benefit/risk assessment performed by the prescribing physician (by assessing both the risk of bleeding and 
the risk of thrombotic event recurrence in each patient). This information was added to the labelling text in 
agreement  with  the  SmPC  guidance  with  dose  recommendations  in  the  elderly  stated  in  separate 
paragraphs. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall the data presented by the MAH indicates no significant increased risk of bleeding with a loading 
dose of clopidogrel and a 12 months maintenance dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel. 
Although the CURRENT OASIS 7 study showed statistically significance in reducing cardiovascular death,

MI, stroke and stent thrombosis, thus supporting the recommendation of 600 mg clopidogrel regimen for 
patients ≥ 75 years old, the loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel in STEMI PCI patients may be considered 
based on an individual benefit/risk assessment performed by the prescribing physician.

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
It is now stated:  
Section 4.1 
Secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events 
Clopidogrel is indicated in: 
• 
Adult patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischemic 
stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease. 
• 
Adult patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: 
-  Non-ST  segment  elevation  acute  coronary  syndrome  (unstable  angina  or  non-Q-wave 
myocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following percutaneous 
coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). 
-  ST  segment  elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction,  in  combination  with  ASA  in  patients 
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or medically treated patients eligible for 
thrombolytic/fibrinolytic therapy.  
Section 4.2 
ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction:  
-  For medically treated patients eligible for thrombolytic/fibrinolytic therapy, 
clopidogrel should be given as a single daily dose of 75 mg initiated with a 300 mg 
loading dose in combination with ASA and with or without thrombolytics. For medically 
treated patients over 75 years of age clopidogrel should be initiated without a loading 
dose. Combined therapy should be started as early as possible after symptoms start and 
continued for at least four weeks. The benefit of the combination of clopidogrel with ASA 
beyond four weeks has not been studied in this setting (see section 5.1). 
-   
-  When percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is intended: 
-  Clopidogrel should be initiated at a loading dose of 600 mg in patients 
undergoing primary PCI and in patients undergoing PCI more than 24 
hours of receiving fibrinolytic therapy. In patients ≥ 75 years old the 
600 mg LD should be administered with caution (see section 4.4).   
-  Clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose should be given in patients 
undergoing PCI within 24 hours of receiving fibrinolytic therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/55817/2023 
Page 37/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clopidogrel treatment should be continued at 75 mg once a day with ASA 75 
mg – 100 mg daily. Combined therapy should be started as early as possible 
after symptoms start and continued up to 12 months (see section 5.1). 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The present application for an extension indication of clopidogrel and clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid in ST 
segment  elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction  (STEMI)  patients  undergoing  percutaneous  coronary 
intervention (PCI) does not bring any change to Patient Information Leaflet tested for Plavix® / Iscover 
film-coated tablets 75 mg and 300 mg and DuoPlavin film-coated tablet 75 mg/75 mg and 75 mg/ 100 mg.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
The  literature  supporting  the  use  of  clopidogrel  with  ASA  in  STEMI  patients  undergoing  PCI  includes  a 
publication  of  one  randomized  trial  (Clopidogrel  as  adjunctive  reperfusion  therapy  [CLARITY])  involving 
3491  patients  with  STEMI  and    another  publication  containing  a  prespecified  subgroup  analysis  in  1863 
patients of the CLARITY trial undergoing PCI (CLARITY PCI study).  CLARITY PCI is a prospectively planned 
subgroup analysis of the CLARITY trial evaluating the effect of clopidogrel LD before PCI in STEMI patients 
followed by MD of clopidogrel as well as ASA. CLARITY PCI showed significant reduction in efficacy outcomes 
(incidence of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke) at Day 30. 
The methodology of literature search for use of clopidogrel 600 mg LD in STEMI patients undergoing PCI 
was similar to the one followed for previous variation dossier submitted on 27-Mar-2020 for clopidogrel 600 
mg LD in ACS with exclusion of studies having patients with only NSTEMI or non-specific ACS. The included 
RCTs showed higher efficacy for the 600 mg LD with better or similar safety outcomes compared with the 
standard 300 mg LD. The efficacy profile was reflected through a significant decrease in composite as well 
as individual outcomes of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke with clopidogrel after 12 months treatment. 
Cumulative evidence shows that the 600 mg LD is at least as effective as the 300 mg LD.  
Three  meta-analyses  including  studies  published  between  the  years  2009  and  2012  highlight  the 
effectiveness of the higher (600 mg) clopidogrel dose compared with the standard 300 mg dose. The meta-
analyses showed significant reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality in the absence of a significant 
effect on major bleeding episodes. 
Literature supporting the effective duration of use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) of clopidogrel with 
ASA in STEMI patients after PCI includes two publications large randomized clinical trials (Clopidogrel for 
the  reduction  of  events  during  observation  [CREDO]  involving  2116  patients  and  The  efficacy  of 
Xience/Promus  versus  Cypher  to  reduce  late  loss  after  stenting  [EXCELLENT]  involving  1443  patients). 
Guidelines  recommend  adjunctive  antithrombotic  therapy  with  ASA  and  P2Y12  inhibitors  (clopidogrel, 
prasugrel,  or  ticagrelor)  in  primary  PCI  and  maintained  over  12  months  in  STEMI  patients  undergoing 
primary PCI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/55817/2023

Overall the data presented by the MAH indicates no significant increased risk of bleeding with a loading 
dose of clopidogrel and a 12 months maintenance dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel. 
Although the CURRENT OASIS 7 study showed statistically significance in reducing cardiovascular death, 
MI, stroke and stent thrombosis, thus supporting the recommendation of 600 mg clopidogrel regimen for 
patients ≥ 75 years old, the MAH recommends that the loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel in STEMI PCI 
patients may be considered based on an individual benefit/risk assessment performed by the prescribing 
physician. This information was added to the labelling text in agreement with the SmPC guidance with dose 
recommendations in the elderly stated in separate paragraphs. 
Taking into account the data shown by the MAH there is supportive evidence for inclusion in the Product 
Information  of  a  new  indication  for  clopidogrel  and  combination  of  clopidogrel  with  ASA  (In  STEMI 
undergoing PCI) and of posology and administration (Dosage in STEMI patients: 300 mg or 600 mg LD of 
clopidogrel when PCI is intended; Treatment duration: 12 months for MD). 
2.9.  Therapeutic Context 
2.9.1.  Disease or condition 
ST elevation acute myocardial infarction is a clinical entity defined by characteristic symptoms of myocardial 
ischemia  in  association  with  persistent  electrocardiographic  ST  elevation  and  subsequent  release  of 
biomarkers of myocardial necrosis. ST elevation acute myocardial infarction comprises approximately 25% 
to 40% of MI presentations.  In STEMI patients, clinical  guidelines recommend the  primary PCI strategy 
over fibrinolysis within indicated timeframes. 
This applications aims to evaluate the use of Clopidogrel for the following indication: ST segment 
elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) in patients undergoing stent placement following a 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).   This application extends the current approved indications of 
Clopidogrel (Plavix®/Iscover®) in patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome. The aims of the 
therapy are to reduce cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke and stent thrombosis. 
The benefit risk assessment will evaluate if the efficacy associated with the reduction of cardiovascular 
events and increased survival outweighs the risk of hemorrhage and namely of major hemorrhage, 
2.9.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients  of  ACS  (UA,  STEMI  or  NSTEMI)  following  an  event  are  either  managed  medically  or  in  most 
instances  undergo  PCI  with  stenting.  Dual  Anti-platelet  Therapy  with  P2Y12  inhibitors  as  clopidogrel, 
ticagrelor,  cangrelor  or  prasugrel  are  used  along  with  aspirin.  DAPT  for  a  period  of  12 months  is 
recommended by guidelines and decided by clinicians upon the evaluation of the  patients’ baseline ischemic 
and bleeding risks. Ticagrelor and  prasugrel are more potent than clopidogrel and got approvals after they 
showed their superiority in clinical trials in terms of efficacy over clopidogrel in large RCTs.  
The  ESC  guideline  recommend  use  of  these  potent  P2Y12  inhibitors  over  clopidogrel,  nevertheless 
clopidogrel is still the most commonly used P2Y12 inhibitor in ACS patients, mostly due to availability/lower 
Assessment report  
EMA/55817/2023 
Page 39/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cost of generics and a better safety profile in patients with multiple comorbidities and those who are more 
prone to bleeding. Also  guidelines recommend the use of clopidogrel in ACS patients who cannot tolerate 
ticagrelor/prasugrel or contradicted. Other factors, which impact selection of P2Y12 inhibitors, include type 
of clinical setting and patient’s ischemic and bleeding risk and other comorbidities.   
Ticagrelor 60 mg twice a day along with aspirin as a DAPT is approved for patients with CAD but no prior 
MI or stroke. 
2.9.3.  Main clinical studies 
In the CLARITY-PCI sub-group analysis of the randomized phase 3 study CLARITY, no significant difference 
was observed in the rates of major or minor bleeding between both the treatments (2.0% with clopidogrel 
pre-treatment versus 1.9% with placebo, p>0.99).  
In the randomized phase 3 CURRENT-OASIS-7 study, in the 17 236 patients who actually underwent a PCI 
procedure the double-dose clopidogrel regimen was associated with a reduction in the rates of both the 
primary and secondary outcome composites, and stent thrombosis. Major bleeding was more common with 
double-dose than with standard-dose clopidogrel (1.6% vs 1.1%, HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 1.83, p=0.009). 
However, rates of severe bleeding and major bleeding defined by TIMI did not differ between groups (1.0% 
vs 0.7% HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97-1.90 p=0.074). 
Double dose clopidogrel did not increase the risk of bleeding that was fatal (0,07% vs 0,2% HR 0.46, 95% 
CI 0.18-1.22, p= 0.12) or intracranial (0.04% vs 0.05% HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.17-3.43, p=0.73), nor bleeding 
that was related to CABG surgery (0.1% vs 0.07% HR 1.70, 95% CI 0.62-4.69, p=0.30).  
2.10.  Favourable effects 
The literature supporting the use of clopidogrel with ASA in STEMI patients undergoing PCI includes a 
publication of one randomized trial (Clopidogrel as adjunctive reperfusion therapy [CLARITY]) involving 
3491 patients with STEMI and a publication containing a prespecified subgroup analysis in 1863 patients 
of the CLARITY trial undergoing PCI (CLARITY PCI study).  CLARITY PCI is a prospectively planned 
subgroup analysis of the CLARITY trial evaluating the effect of clopidogrel LD before PCI in STEMI patients 
followed by MD of clopidogrel as well as ASA. CLARITY PCI showed significant reduction in the composite 
efficacy outcome (incidence of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke) at Day 30 (7.5% with clopidogrel pre-
treatment versus 12% with placebo, OR 5.9; 95% CI 0.43-0.81 p=0.001). 
Three meta-analyses including studies published between the years 2009 and 2012 highlight the 
effectiveness of the higher (600 mg) clopidogrel dose compared with the standard 300 mg dose. The 
meta-analyses showed significant reduction in cardiovascular events.  
Literature supporting the effective duration of use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) of clopidogrel with 
ASA in STEMI patients after PCI includes two publications containing a large randomized clinical trial in 
each (Clopidogrel for the reduction of events during observation [CREDO] involving 2116 patients and 
The efficacy of Xience/Promus versus Cypher to reduce late loss after stenting [EXCELLENT] involving 
1443 patients).

2.11.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the benefit-risk balance. 
2.12.  Unfavourable effects 
The  analysis  of  the  safety  data  for  the  use  of  clopidogrel  in  combination  with  ASA  in  STEMI  patients 
undergoing PCI in the CLARITY study and the CLARITY PCI subgroup analysis showed overall no significant 
increase in bleeding with clopidogrel versus placebo. 
The analysis of the safety data for the higher clopidogrel LD (600 mg) in comparison to the standard 300 
mg LD, focused on the review of bleeding and death available in 8 publications. Among these, only 3 clinical 
trials were fully relevant for the safety analysis due to their study design (randomized and controlled) and 
also because they were conducted with the standard 75 mg/day MD after the LD. In these 3 studies, the 
clopidogrel 600 mg LD showed no evidence of an increase in bleeding. The result of the retrospective study 
showed  the  clopidogrel  600  mg  LD  to  be  as  safe  as  the  clopidogrel  300  mg  LD  while  considering  the 
bleeding. It was also identified that increasing the MD of clopidogrel (150 mg/day instead of 75 mg/day) 
after the clopidogrel 600 mg LD may increase the risk of major bleeding. 
The analysis of the safety data for the long term (12 months) treatment with clopidogrel in combination 
with ASA in STEMI patients after PCI in CREDO  study  showed no significant increase in major or minor 
bleeding at 1 year whereas EXCELLENT study showed no difference in safety endpoint (composite of death, 
MI, stroke, stent thrombosis or TIMI major bleeding) between 6-month and 12-month DAPT. 
Deaths were analyzed as part of the efficacy endpoints of the studies. In an effort to 
review them, the meta-analysis by Vyas et al. 2014 was selected for its relevance and showed comparable 
rate of death between the 2 LD groups. 
There was a lack of  data presented by the MAH regarding safety in individuals > 75 years-old. The MAH 
presented data regarding the CURRENT OASIS 7 study that reported data in the subset of patients >75 
years-old. This study showed consistency in the treatment effect for each dose comparison in predefined 
subgroups.  Consistent  effects  were  recorded  with  the  double-dose  clopidogrel  regimen  in  patients  with 
STEMI and patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. There was no significant 
interaction for weight <60 kg or >60 kg, age below and over 75 years and previous stroke (p for interaction 
0.614). In this trial, clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose has shown consistent efficacy in patients age ≥75 
years of age and patients <75 years of age.

2.13.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The literature supporting the use of clopidogrel with ASA in STEMI patients undergoing stent placement in 
PCI procedures showed significant reduction in cardiovascular events such as cardiovascular death, MI, 
stroke and stent thrombosis, thus supporting the indication proposed by the MAH. These are clinically 
relevant endpoints.  
Overall, the data presented by the MAH indicates no significant increased risk of bleeding with a loading 
dose of clopidogrel and a 12 months maintenance dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel. These are the most 
clinically relevant safety endpoints in this context.  
2.13.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall B/R of clopidogrel is positive regarding the use of clopidogrel in patients that undergo stent 
placement in the context of PCI. Also, a loading dose of 600 mg was shown to be more effective although 
associated in some studies with an increase overall risk of bleeding not associated with major 
haemorrhage. DAPT during 12 months in STEMI patients with clopidogrel 75 mg and low dose ASA was 
shown in a double blinded clinical trial to reduce a composite cardiovascular outcome and not to be 
associated to an increased risk of bleeding.  
There  was  no  specific  information  regarding  safety  in  patients  >75  years  old.  The  MAH  recognized  that 
overall, there is a lack of data regarding patients >75 years-old. The MAH presented data regarding the 
CURRENT OASIS 7 study that reported data in the subset of patients >75 years-old. This study showed 
consistency in the treatment effect for each dose comparison in predefined subgroups. Consistent effects 
were recorded with the double-dose clopidogrel regimen in patients with STEMI and patients with non-ST-
segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. There was no significant interaction for weight <60 kg or 
>60 kg, age below and over 75 years and previous stroke (p for interaction 0.614). In this trial, clopidogrel 
600  mg  loading  dose  has  shown  consistent  efficacy  in  patients  age  ≥75  years  of  age  and  patients  <75 
years  of  age.  Although  the  CURRENT  OASIS  7  study  has  shown  statistically  significance  in  reducing 
cardiovascular death,  MI, stroke  and  stent thrombosis,  thus  supporting  the  recommendation  of  600  mg 
clopidogrel regimen for patients ≥ 75 years old,  the MAH recommends that the loading dose of 600 mg 
clopidogrel  in  STEMI  PCI  patients  may  be  considered  based  on  an  individual  benefit/risk  assessment 
performed by the prescribing physician (by assessing both the risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombotic 
event recurrence in each patient). This information was added to the labelling text in agreement with the 
SmPC guidance with dose recommendations in the elderly stated in separate paragraphs.  
Taking this into account the B/R of clopidogrel is considered to be positive.  
Considering all favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive.

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Descovy 
emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide 
On 25 February 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Descovy, 
intended for the treatment of HIV infection. The applicant for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences 
International Ltd. 
Descovy will be available as film-coated tablets (200 mg/10 mg and 200 mg/25 mg). The active 
substances of Descovy are the antiretrovirals emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (ATC code: 
J05AR17). Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are substrates and competitive inhibitors of HIV 
reverse transcriptase. After phosphorylation, they are incorporated into the viral DNA chain, resulting in 
chain termination. 
Descovy is an alternative treatment option to the licensed tenofovir disoproxil and is expected to have 
similar efficacy. The most common side effect is nausea. Descovy has low impact on renal safety and 
bone mineral density compared with tenofovir disoproxil. 
The full indication is: "Descovy is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the 
treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 35 kg) infected 
with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) (see sections 4.2 and 5.1)." It is proposed that 
Descovy be prescribed by physicians experienced in the in the management of HIV infection.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

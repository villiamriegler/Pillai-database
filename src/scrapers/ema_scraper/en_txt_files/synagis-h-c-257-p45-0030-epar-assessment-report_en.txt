SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
I.1  Clinical aspects 
The MAH has according to article 45 in the Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006 submitted 2 studies: Study 
BELG-99-011 and Study FRAN-05-003.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Study BELG-99-011: 
A  poster  entitled  “Results  of  an  Expanded  Access  Program  with  Synagis  during  the  Winter  Seasons 
1998/1999, 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 in Belgium and Luxembourg.” is the only available information on 
this study: 
The study design was a Phase III / IV, multi-center, single-arm, open-label program to collect additional 
(to  the  IMpact-RSV  Study)  efficacy  and  safety  data of  palivizumab  in  Belgium  and  Luxemburg  (where 
palivizumab  at  that  time  was  not  readily  available)  for  children  with  a  history  of  prematurity  with  or 
without  BPD:  Children  <35  weeks  gestational  age  or  less  at  birth  AND  <6  months  of  age  at  time  of 
enrolment OR children with BPD who are <24 months of age at enrollment (age is based on actual age, 
not  corrected  age)  AND  requiring  medical  intervention/management  (i.e.,  oxygen,  steroids,  diuretics, 
bronchodilators) within the previous six months. 
Informed consent was obtained from the child’s parent or legal guardian.  
Participants received up to 5 monthly injections of 15 mg/kg palivizumab.  
For patients hospitalized for respiratory illness, source documentation was followed up to assess pathogen 
identification. 
The children were followed for Adverse Events for a maximum of 150 days (concluding 30 days after the 
the  Abbott  International 
last 
Pharmacovigilance Department.  
injection).  Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAE’s)  were  reported 
to 
Data presented in the poster were analyzed from this safety database.  
A total of 166 children were enrolled at 11 centers in Belgium and Luxemburg. 
The total number of serious adverse events reported was 39. Three adverse events were considered to be 
medically important. One of these was a dermographism suspected to be possibly related to palivizumab 
therapy.  One  death,  due  to  underlying  BPD  with  superinfection  (Streptococcus  and  H.  influenzae)  and 
thus not related to palivizumab therapy, was reported. Six SAE’s were reported being hospitalizations for 
surgery  not  related  to  palivizumab  therapy.  Furthermore  28  patients  (16.8%)  were  hospitalized  (30 
hospitalizations)  during  the  three  seasons.  None  were  considered  related  to  palivizumab.  27  were 
hospitalizations associated with respiratory illness. Of the 27 patients hospitalized for respiratory illness, 4 
(2.4%  of  the  treated  population)  were  RSV  positive  but  they  didn’t  spend  any  time  in  intensive  care  or 
didn’t require mechanical ventilation. Of the 27 respiratory hospitalizations, 18 hospitalizations were RSV 
negative, 4 were diagnosed for other pathogens or pathology, and there was no need for RSV testing, and 
one  was  not  tested  for  RSV  or  was  not  diagnosed  for  other  pathogens.  Eight  patients  (4.8%)  were 
diagnosed with RSV but did not require hospitalization.

Assessor’s comments:  
The  MAH  has  not  provided  any  information  regarding  presentation  of  this  poster:  Has  the  poster  been 
presented?  Was  it  presented  at  a  peer  reviewed  conference/meeting?  When  was  it  presented?  Has  the 
study been published?  
A protocol for the study and/or a more detailed study report should be available? 
The  observation  that  four  or  2.4%  of  the  treated  population  were  hospitalized  and  RSV  positive  is 
comparable  to  the  results  of  the  IMpact  study  in  which  4.8%  of  1002  palivizumab  treated  high-risk 
children were hospitalized due to RSV. Also the safety profiles of palivizumab were comparable between 
the IMpact study and this expanded access program. However, the population size was small.  
Main study  
FRAN-05-003:  An  observational  cohort  study  of  children  treated  by  Synagis  in  France  (season  2005-
2006) 
Objectives: 
The objectives of the study, which was requested by the French Health Authorities, were to describe 
  The current use of Synagis by French paediatricians and the profiles of children benefiting from 
the prophylaxis; 
  The safety of the drug; 
  The  morbidity  and  mortality  observed  over  a  one-year  follow-up  period  starting  after  the  first 
injection in children treated by Synagis 
Methods 
A partly prospective and partly retrospective cohort was set up for the season 2005-2006 with a one-year 
follow-up starting at the first injection of Synagis on a national representative sample of children. 
The current utilisation of Synagis was described by the following items: 
- The profiles of the children treated with Synagis (medical history, clinical profile, sociodemographic 
   characteristics of children and family); 
- The characteristics of the injections of Synagis (number, dates and doses); 
- The status of the centres where the prophylaxis was prescribed; 
- The utilisation of medical services: general or hospital based practitioners, oxygen treatment, 
   respiratory physiotherapy; 
- The side effects having occurred during the follow-up period; 
The evaluation of morbidity and mortality was based on an analysis of all relevant clinical events, 
attributable or not to the RSV infection, during the one-year follow-up period: 
- Death; 
- Hospitalization; 
- Other use of medical services;  
- Causes and circumstances of those events.

Study population 
The following centres were eligible to participate in the study: 
- the whole set of the French tertiary level care centres which are highly specialized paediatric 
   hospital centre” (so-called “level 3” ); 
- all secondary level care centres, which are specialized paediatric hospital centres” (so-called “level 
   2” in France) having prescribed Synagis to at least 15 children during the preceding season 
  (2003-2004); 
- all cardio and pneumo-pediatry hospital centres. 
The participation in the study was proposed to all eligible centres through mail and telephone contacts. If 
they agreed to participate, a physician was designated in each centre to play the role of Local Coordinator 
(LC) for the study during the whole period of the data collection. 
Inclusion criteria 
All children for whom Synagis had been initiated during the season 2005-2006 in the participating centres 
were eligible to participate. 
Exclusion criteria 
The study was proposed to the parents after the first Synagis injection. 
A written agreement signed by at least one legal representative of the child was requested by the French 
regulatory system to participate in the study. Children whose parents refused to sign this document for any 
reasons were then excluded. 
Results & Discussion 
The  study  was  proposed  to  135  centres;  64  (47.4%)  participated.  The  participation  rates  were  higher 
among  highly  specialized  neonatalogy  centres  (level  3)  (37/65=56.9  %)  compared  to  specialized 
neonatalogy centres (level 2) (23/60=38.3%) and to cardio/pneumo-pediatry centres (4/10=40%).  
This  reflects  the  prescription  situation  in  France  where  Synagis  is  mainly  initiated  in  highly  specialized 
neonatalogy centres. Differences in levels of participation between regions and between the various types 
of centres  are  moderate  which reflects the representation of the participating centres  across the country. 
The regions with a high birth rate are also those with a high level of participation. 
According to the type of study, the parents refusal rate of participation seems relatively moderate and thus 
data was collected on an important proportion in which Synagis was delivered in France during the 2005-
2006 season: 1614 children in the 64 centres were eligible for the study, 1420 (88%) were included. 
In this observational study 1,420 children were included, which represents 22% of the estimated number 
of children who received Synagis in France during the season 2005-2006 (around 6,500 according to sales 
estimation).  The  majority  of  the  children  were  included  in  neonatology  centres  (1394)  and  26  children 
came from centres of cardio or pneumo-paediatrics. 
The  average  duration  of  follow-up  of  the  children  in  the  study was  of  10.9  months  and  only  2  children 
were lost to follow-up. 
Unsurprisingly  the  baseline  characteristics  of  the  children  from  neonatology  centres  are  statistically 
different from those of cardio or pneumo-paediatrics centres: Premature babies who represent the majority 
(only 134 children had a GA > 37weeks) of the cohort came mainly from neonatology centres. 
Page 6/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  The mean age of the children at the time of their first injection was 5 months in neonatology and 8.6 
months in cardio or pneumo-paediatrics. 
-  The  mean  gestational  age  was  of  30.1  weeks  in  neonatology  and  of  37  weeks  in  cardio  or  pneumo-              
paediatrics. 
These results reflect the differences in the 2 populations in which Synagis is approved: premature babies 
on one hand, children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease on the other hand. 
Synagis was generally administered throughout the whole RSV season in the cohort population: Among 
the  1394  children  from  neonatology  centres  for  whom  the  information  was  available  a  mean  of  4.4 
injections  per  child  was  performed.  621  (44.9%)  of  1383  children  from  neonatalogy  centres  received  5 
injections of Synagis, 183 (13.2%) received 6 injections and 24 children (1.7%) received 7. 
Among the 1,341 children from neonatology centres for whom the information was available, 895 (66.7%) 
met the criteria that all intervals between Synagis injections were in the range 23-37 days. The remaining 
446 children had at least one interval between 2 injections that was below 23 days or above 37 days. 
Among  the  26  children  from  cardio/pneumo-pediatry  centres,  a  mean  of  4.6  injections  per  child  was 
administered.  14  (56%)  of  25  children  from  cardio/pneumo-pediatry  centres  received  5  injections  of 
Synagis,  2  (8%)  received  6,  and  1  child  received  7.  Twelve  (48%)  met  the  criteria  that  all  intervals 
between  Synagis®  injections  were  in  the  range  23-37  days.  The  remaining  13  children  had  at  least  one 
interval between 2 injections that was below 23 days or above 37 days. 
Children hospitalized over the period of follow-up of one year after the first injection of Synagis: 
Among children from neonatology centres (n=1215): 
- 
- 
- 
367 (30.2%) were hospitalized at least once for an unplanned hospitalization, 
221 (18.2%) were hospitalized for a LRTI, 
  38 (3.1%) were hospitalized for a RSV-LRTI 
Considering the children from neonatology hospitalized over a period from the 7th day after the first 
injection to 30 days after the last injection which corresponds to the protection period of Synagis, only 29 
children (2.4 %), were hospitalized for a RSV-LRTI. 
Among children from cardio/pneumo-paediatric centres (n=25): 
- 
- 
- 
14 (56%) were hospitalized at least once for an unplanned hospitalization, 
 8 (32%) were hospitalized for a LRTI, 
 5 of the 25 children from cardio/pneumo-paediatric centres (20%) were hospitalized for a RSV-
LRTI 
Among  the  25  children  from  cardio/pneumo-pediatry  centres  for  whom  a  one-year  follow-up  was 
available,  20%  (5)  children  were  hospitalized  for  a  RSV-LRTI  infection  that  occurred  between  7  days 
after the 1st injection until 30 days after the date of last injection. 
The analysis of use of Synagis showed that it was used according to its approved indications in 84.3% 
(1,162) of the 1,378 children for whom the information was available: 
Page 7/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
●    426  (30.9%)  of  the  children  who  received  Synagis  were  less  than  2  years  of  age  with  a  GA  <32                          
weeks  and  BDP.  In  this  population,  the  number  of  children  hospitalized  with  positive  RSV  during  the 
one-year follow-up was 7 (3.6%) in those with less than 28 weeks of GA and 10 (5.7%) in the group of 
28-32 GA. 
This study demonstrated that children who received Synagis prophylaxis had rates of RSV hospitalization 
similar to the rates observed in children who receive Synagis in previous observational studies in France 
and in other countries: 
- 
- 
3.9 % in the study IRIS (Pedraz C et al. Paediatr Infect Dis J 2003;22:823-7) 
In the study of the Perinatal Network of Burgundy the hospitalization rates were 11.8 % for the 
season 2000-2001 (first season of Synagis use in France) then 3.8 % for the season 2001- 
2002. (Grimaldi et al. Paediatr Infect Dis J 2004;23:1081-5) 
Furthermore, in the present observational study, the hospitalization rates were lower than those observed 
in the untreated children groups from previous observational studies: 13.25 % in the IRIS study and 46.2 
% in the Burgundy study. 
●  Of the children who received Synagis, 529 (38.4%) were young children (0 to 6 months) with a GA 
<32  weeks  without  BDP.  In  this  population,  the  number  of  children  hospitalized  with  positive  RSV 
during  the  one-year  follow-up  was  10  (2.5%)  in  the  group  of  28-32  GA.  No  children  with  a  GA  <  28 
weeks were hospitalized. 
These results are in line with those of a sub-group (n=506) of children < 35 weeks of GA without DBP 
from IMpact clinical study (Pediatrics 1998;102:531-7), in which 9 children (1.8%) were hospitalized. 
In the present observational study, children with severe malformations and various pulmonary diseases 
(detailed information provided in an appendix) represent 15.5% (n=213) of the cohort. In this population, 
2.6% or 5 children were hospitalized for RSV-LRTI during the one-year follow-up. 
The analysis of the predictive factors associated with a high risk of hospitalization for RSV infection in a 
cohort of children having received Synagis could help to identify those who, in addition to Synagis, must 
be followed and watched over very closely. 
During  the  one  year  follow-up  no  new  safety  signal  was  observed.  The  number  of  deaths  (6)  reported 
during the one-year period of follow-up after the first injection of Synagis was low. 
Assessor’s comments: 
Agree  with  the  MAH  concluding,  that  this  observational  study  conducted  in  a  large  French  cohort 
confirmed  in  real  conditions  that  children  receiving  Synagis  had  a  low  RSV-LRTI  hospitalization  rate. 
The tolerance of Synagis was good during the follow-up period of one year after the last injection. These 
results confirmed those already seen in previous pivotal and observational studies.

II. 
OVERALL CONCLUSION  
The MAH has according to article 45 in the Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006 submitted 2 studies: Study 
BELG-99-011 and Study FRAN-05-003.  
Regarding Study BELG-99-011 the MAH has only submitted a poster – more detailed information may be 
available. 
Regarding Study FRAN-05-003 the MAH has submitted a  comprehensive Clinical Report. The study is 
observational which tantamount to no controls. However, the observations in the study are in agreement 
with the results shown in clinical studies with Synagis, especially the IMpact study, which was the pivotal 
study in the MAA.  
The MAH has not, as suggested in the “Best Practice Guide Article 45 – Paediatric Regulation”, submitted 
a short critical expert overview clarifying the context of the data. 
Nor has the MAH submitted a SPC/PL proposal or justification that changes are not necessary. However; 
the observations done in the two submitted studies support the indication as stated in the approved SPC, 
they do not add anything new and since it cannot be ruled out that the results of the FRAN-05-003 Study 
is  influenced  by  less  than  half  of  the  centres  proposed  for  the  study  participated,  there  is  no  need  for  a 
revision of the SPC. 
III.  REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION AS 
PROPOSED BY THE RAPPORTEUR 
Other concerns 
Clinical efficacy 
Q 1. Regarding Study BELG-99-011 the MAH has only submitted a poster – more detailed information 
may be available and should be submitted. 
Q  2.  The  MAH  has  not,  as  suggested  in  the  “Best  Practice  Guide  Article  45  –  Paediatric  Regulation”, 
submitted a short critical expert overview clarifying the context of the data, the MAH should explain. 
Q  3.  According  to  “Best  Practice  Guide  Article  45  –  Paediatric  Regulation”,  the  MAH  is  expected  to 
submitt a SPC/PL proposal or justification that changes are not necessary. The MAH should comment. 
IV.  ASSESSMENT OF MAH RESPONSES 
The  MAH  has  now  submitted  also  to  the  Rapporteurs  and  CHMP  members  the  above  requested 
information  including  a  short  critical  expert  Overview  on  Clinical  Efficacy  and  Safety  and  justification 
that changes to the SPC are not necessary. These data were previously only submitted to EMEA. 
Conclusion:  
All issues are now resolved.

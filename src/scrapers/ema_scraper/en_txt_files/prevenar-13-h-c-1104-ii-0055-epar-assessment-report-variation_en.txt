1.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
[P/73/2011] on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP [P/73/2011] was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Prevenar 13 is a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for use in infants and young children to 
prevent pneumococcal disease (IPD, pneumonia, and acute otitis media [AOM]) caused by the 13 
pneumococcal serotypes (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) contained 
in the vaccine. 
To overcome the limited immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines, the protein 
conjugation technology was applied to the development of 13vPnC.  Each of the pneumococcal 
polysaccharides is covalently conjugated to the diphtheria cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197) 
protein, which acts as an immunologic carrier.  
Children aged <5 years are particularly susceptible to pneumococcal disease, but older children may 
also be vulnerable. There are well-established at risk medical conditions such as asthma and diabetes 
mellitus, which predispose to IPD.  The relative risk of children with these predisposing medical 
conditions is often 2 to 4 fold, when compared to the healthy population of the respective age group. 
There is also a smaller group of children with complex immune compromising conditions (often called 
high-risk conditions such as HIV infection and sickle cell disease), who also have an increased risk for 
pneumococcal infections.  
The current application is based on results from clinical study 6096A1-3011 which was designed to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC administered to healthy children in 4 
age groups:  
•  >15 months to <2 years (group 1);  
• 
• 
• 
ages ≥2 years to <5 years (group 2);  
ages ≥5 years to <10 years (group 3); 
ages ≥10 years to <18 years (group 4). 
Children were offered 1 or 2 doses of the study vaccine depending on their age.  The data for groups 1 
and 2 have previously been submitted and assessed (FUM 18 and FU2 018.2).  The data for groups 3 
and 4 form the basis for extending the indication for 13vPnC to include children and adolescents 6 to 
17 years of age.

2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects  
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study Design  
Study 6096A1-3011 was an open-label study, which evaluated the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of 13vPnC administered to healthy children in 4 age groups: ages >15 months to <2 
years (group 1); ages ≥2 years to <5 years (group 2); ages ≥5 years to <10 years (group 3); and ages 
≥10 years to <18 years (group 4).  The results for groups 1 and 2 are not relevant to this application 
and will not be presented or discussed as these were already assessed as pots-approval measures.   
Subjects in group 3 had been previously vaccinated with at least 1 dose of 7vPnC, and subjects in 
group 4 had never been vaccinated with 7vPnC or any other pneumococcal vaccine.  In this study, 
subjects from groups 3 and 4 were to receive 1 dose of 13vPnC.  
The study was conducted in USA between November 2008 and August 2010.  
Study objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the pneumococcal immune responses induced by 13-
valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) when measured 1 month after the last scheduled 
study vaccination in each of 4 age groups. The safety objective of this study was to evaluate the 
acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC as measured by the incidence of local reactions, systemic 
events, and adverse events (AEs). The exploratory objective was to assess the level of 
opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) induced by 13vPnC in a subset of subjects measured 1 month after 
the last scheduled dose of 13vPnC. Note that OPA assays were originally to be done for a randomly 
selected subset of subjects but were instead done for all subjects in the analysis population.  
Number of Subjects 
As of Amendment 3, the number of subjects planned for age groups 3 and 4 was 600, ie, 300 subjects 
in group 3 and 300 subjects in group 4. Per an addendum to the statistical analysis plan (SAP), groups 
3 and 4 were divided into exploratory and confirmatory cohorts and data from previously completed 
study 6096A1-3005 was used for comparison purposes in certain specified immunogenicity analyses.  
Study 6096A1-3005 was a parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial 
conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 3 lots of 13vPnC in healthy 
infants (approximately 2 months of age at first vaccination) when co-administered with routine 
pediatric vaccinations.  Subjects received 1 dose (0.5 mL) of either 13vPnC or 7vPnC at each of the 4 
vaccination visits along with a concomitant dose of Pediarix and Hib vaccine at the 2-, 4-, and 6-month 
visits, and with MMR, varicella, and hepatitis A vaccines at the 12-month visit. A total of 1712 subjects 
were randomly assigned in the 4 groups (3 lots of 13vPnC and 1 lot of 7PnC). The mean age at which 
the subjects received the toddler dose was 12.4 months. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion 
Eligible subjects for groups 3 and 4 were healthy children aged ≥5 years and <18 years at the time of 
enrollment who were available for the entire study period, and whose parent/legal guardian could be 
reached by telephone. Subjects in group 3 had to have received at least 1 previous dose of Prevenar. 
In group 4, female and male subjects who were biologically capable of having children agreed to

abstinence or committed to the use of a reliable method of hormonal and/or non hormonal 
contraception for 3 months after the vaccination. 
Children were excluded if they had a major illness or condition that would have substantially increased 
the risk associated with study completion or precluded the evaluation of the child’s response. Children 
were also excluded if previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine or if 
they were direct descendants of site study personnel. Children in group 4 were excluded if previously 
vaccinated with Prevenar or any other pneumococcal vaccine or were pregnant or breastfeeding 
adolescent females. 
Duration of Treatment 
Subjects in groups 3 and 4 received a single dose of 13vPnC. Subjects were evaluated for 
immunogenicity at approximately 1 month after vaccination and for safety through the 6-month 
telephone follow-up. 
Immunogenicity assessment methods 
Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum concentrations of anticapsular 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes contained in 13vPnC (1, 3, 4, 5, 
6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined in all subjects for each blood sample and 
expressed as micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL). Functional antibody titers for the 13 pneumococcal 
serotypes contained in 13vPnC were determined using serum OPA assays. 
Endpoints 
The primary comparison of IgG concentrations for group 3 confirmatory cohort was a non-inferiority 
comparison to anti-capsular IgG data from Wyeth study 6096A1- 3005. For each of the original 7 
serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) included in Prevenar (7-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine [7vPnC]), the ratio of the geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) comparing group 3 
confirmatory cohort to the 7vPnC data from study 6096A1-3005 was computed. For each of the 
additional serotypes included in 13vPnC (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A), the ratio of the GMCs comparing 
group 3 confirmatory cohort to 13vPnC data from study 6096A1-3005 (combined across lots as lot 
consistency was verified) was computed. 
An analysis similar to that described above for group 3 confirmatory cohort was performed to compare 
the IgG data from group 4 confirmatory cohort to data from Wyeth study 6096A1-3005. 
Per the statistical analysis plan (SAP) addendum, this was designated a secondary analysis for group 4 
confirmatory cohort. The primary comparison for group 4 was the comparison of OPA titers for the 
group 4 confirmatory cohort compared to the group 3 confirmatory cohort via their OPA geometric 
mean ratio (GMR) by serotype. 
Within each age group, GMCs of pneumococcal IgG and geometric means of the OPA titers (GMTs) 
were calculated at each visit at which blood was drawn. The OPA antibody titers were logarithmically 
transformed for analysis. Two (2)-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed by back 
transformation of the CIs for the mean of the logarithmically transformed assay results, computed 
using the Student t distribution. The geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) in antibody concentration and 
in OPA titers (post-vaccination/pre-vaccination) were summarized by geometric means and 95% CIs.

The proportion of subjects with pre-specified IgG concentrations for each of the 13 pneumococcal 
serotypes was calculated before and after vaccination in each age group. For each serotype, an exact, 
2-sided 95% CI for the proportions was calculated. The CI for the single proportions was computed 
using the F distribution. Type I error was not adjusted for multiple comparisons within each age group. 
No formal statistical comparisons were made between the age groups. 
The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for OPA titers was used to compute the proportion of subjects 
with OPA titers ≥LLOQ for each serotype, along with exact, 2-sided 95% CI, for group 3 exploratory 
cohort, group 3 confirmatory cohort, group 4 exploratory cohort and group 4 confirmatory cohort. No 
formal statistical comparisons were made between the age groups. 
Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) were generated for each serotype-specific IgG 
concentration and for OPA titers before and after vaccination. 
As a post hoc sensitivity analysis, comparison of OPA titers for the group 4 confirmatory cohort 
compared to the group 3 confirmatory cohort via their OPA GMR by serotype was repeated using the 
actual titer and ½LLOQ (0.5*LLOQ), ¾LLOQ (0.75*LLOQ), 4/5LLOQ (0.80*LLOQ) and LLOQ 
(1.0*LLOQ) for those titers that fell below the LLOQ. 
Analysis Populations  
Evaluable Immunogenicity Population This population included all subjects who were eligible for the 
study; met the age requirement (≥5 to <10 years of age for group 3 and ≥10 to <18 years of age for 
group 4); received the required study vaccination; had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result 
before and after the study vaccination; had blood drawn before and after the vaccination within the 
required time frame; and had no other major protocol violations. 
All-Available Immunogenicity Population: Subjects who had at least 1 valid and determinate assay 
result were included in the all-available immunogenicity population for each age group. 
2.2.2.  Results 
All of the 598 subjects who consented to be in the study were randomized: 299 in group 3 and 299 in 
group 4. The majority of the enrolled subjects in group 3 and group 4 were vaccinated (294, 98.3% 
and 298, 99.7%, respectively) and completed the study (277, 92.6% and 294, 98.3%). 
In group 3, 22 subjects were withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: lost to follow up (6 
subjects), failed to return (5 subjects), parent/legal guardian request (5 subjects), protocol violation (5 
subjects), and for “other” reason (1 subject [“subject uncooperative”]). In group 4, 5 subjects were 
withdrawn for the following reasons: failed to return (2 subjects), lost to follow-up (1 subject), protocol 
violation (1 subject), and for “other” reason (1 subject [“unable to withdraw blood”]). 
In groups 3 and 4, a total of 598 subjects were enrolled: 299 in group 3 and 299 in group 4.  The 
majority of subjects were white (66.9% [group 3] and 77.9% [group 4]) and non-hispanic and non-
latino (91.3% [group 3] and 91.3 [group 4]).  The percentages of males were 48.2% (group 3) and 
54.5% (group 4), and the percentages of females were 51.8% (group 3) and 45.5% (group 4).  In 
group 3, age at enrollment ranged from 5 to 10 years, with the mean age at enrollment of 7.4 years.  
In group 4, age at enrollment ranged from 10 to 18 years, with the mean age at enrollment of 13.7 
years.

Primary comparison (Group 3 GMC) 
The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority, based on IgG 
concentrations 1 month after 13vPnC vaccination in the group 3 (subjects ≥5 years to <10 years) 
confirmatory cohort compared to the post-toddler responses in the 7vPnC group from study 6096A1-
3005 for the 7 common serotypes and compared to the post-toddler responses in the combined 
13vPnC groups from study 6096A1-3005 for the 6 additional serotypes. The criterion for non-inferiority 
for a given serotype was met if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMCs (GMRs) 
(group 3 confirmatory cohort relative to study 6096A1-3005) was >0.5. 
As shown in Table 1 for the evaluable immunogenicity population, this criterion was met for all 7 
common serotypes. The serotype-specific GMCs were higher in group 3 in this study compared to the 
7vPnC group from study 6096A1-3005 for all of the 7 common serotypes. The serotype-specific GMRs 
ranged from 2.51 for serotype 23F to 5.66 for serotype 6B.

As shown in Table 2, the criterion for non-inferiority (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR >0.5) 
was met for all 6 of the additional serotypes. The serotype-specific GMCs were higher for the group 3 
confirmatory 13vPnC group in this study than for the combined 13vPnc groups from study 6096A1-
3005 for all of the 6 additional serotypes. The serotype-specific GMRs ranged from 1.23 for serotype 1 
to 3.17 for serotype 3.

Primary comparison group 4 OPA GMTs 
For group 4, the primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune 
responses to the 13 serotypes in 13vPnC in the group 4 (subjects ≥10 years to <18 years) 
confirmatory cohort compared to the group 3 (subjects ≥5 years to <10 years) confirmatory cohort, as 
measured by OPA titers 1 month after vaccination. OPA titers for group 4 were to be declared non-
inferior to those for group 3 if the lower limit of the 2-sided, 95% CI for the GMR (group 4 
confirmatory GMT/group 3 confirmatory GMT) was >0.5 (2-fold criterion). As shown in Table 3, this 
criterion was met for all 7 common serotypes and for all of the 6 additional serotypes except serotype 
3. The serotype-specific GMRs ranged from 0.7 (serotype 18C) to 1.5 (serotypes 4 and 19F) for the 7 
common serotypes and from 0.6 (serotypes 3 and 7F) to 1.7 (serotype 1) for the 6 additional 
serotypes.

The secondary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate, based on IgG concentrations 1 month 
after vaccination, non-inferiority of the immune responses induced by 13vPnC received by the group 4 
confirmatory cohort compared (lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR >0.5) to the posttoddler 
responses in the 7vPnC group from study 6096A1-3005 for the 7 common serotypes and compared to 
the post-toddler responses in the combined 13vPnC groups from study 6096A1-3005 for the 6 
additional serotypes.

2.2.3.  Discussion 
There is no established serological correlate of protection in the age groups 5-10 and 10-18 years. The 
company has compared the IgG responses in the 5-10 year old children who were previously primed 
with at least one dose of Prevenar (group 3), to the IgG responses in toddlers (booster dose) 
vaccinated with Prevenar 13 in study 3005. The comparison provides a bridge to a population where 
efficacy has been demonstrated. The IgG responses in group 3 were clearly non-inferior, even superior 
to the responses in toddlers, both against the 7 Prevenar serotypes and the 6 additional serotypes.  
In group 4, the unprimed children 10-18 years of age the primary comparison was OPA GMT vs group 
3. This comparison is also considered acceptable as protection is mediated by opsonophagocytic 
antibodies, and the same approach was used to extend the indication to adults >50 years of age. Also 
for the 10-18 year old children non-inferiority was demonstrated.  
Fort both age groups the secondary and exploratory analyses support substantial immune responses 
that are very likely to be protective. These results are not unexpected, as immune responses in older 
children generally are stronger than in the youngest children (below 2 years of age). In addition, many 
of the older children have encountered pneumococci of various serotypes, and can thus be considered 
primed. This is also supported by the presence of antibodies to some serotypes before vaccination, in 
many but not all subjects. 
The MAH rationale for extending the use of 13vPnC in children and adolescents up to 17 years of age 
was based on: 
Assessment report  
EMA/89713/2013  
Page 16/30 
 
 
 
 
 
1.  Burden of disease: While there has been a significant reduction in invasive pneumococcal 
disease (IPD) since the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC, 
Prevenar) in young children up to 5 years of age, there remains a significant burden of disease 
in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age. According to Eurostat 5.4 million children 
were born in the European Union (EU27) in 2008.  Conservatively generalizing from population 
based data presented below an incidence of IPD of about 2 per 100,000 population, among the 
70.2 million children age 5 to <18 years in EU27, there are about 1,404 IPD cases annually.  
Based on current 13vPnC IPD-coverage data (39.4% and 86% for bacteraemia and meningitis 
in France, respectively, 65% in Germany, 59% for England and Wales), approximately half to 
two-thirds of the cases could be vaccine preventable.  
Similar calculations based on Center for Disease Control (CDC) Active Bacterial Core (ABC) 
surveillance in the United States of America (USA), estimate that, as of 2007, 1300 cases of 
IPD occur annually in this age group (population 54 million; www.census.gov, intercensal 
estimate for 2010, incidence 2.4 per 100,000 population according to ABC data) and between 
52.4% and 61.3% (based on ABC surveillance data for 2007 to 2009) are caused by 13vPnC 
serotypes.   
2.  Risk subjects: Certain patients have a significantly elevated risk of pneumococcal diseases 
including those with chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, or asthma.  Moreover, some 
underlying diseases like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or sickle cell disease have a very 
high risk for IPD (high-risk subjects) and for those 13vPnC is recommended in case they are 5 
to 17 years of age (eg, in Ireland).  
3.  Limited benefits of 23vPPV: Vaccination with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharides 
vaccine (23vPPV) of at risk and high-risk children and young adults is recommended in some 
countries.  Although a number of randomized clinical trials and case-control studies have been 
published, the degree of protection afforded by 23vPPV remains much debated.  While it 
appears that 23vPPV offers some protection against IPD in the general elderly population, it 
has an only moderate effect in the high-risk elderly and the vaccine has little or no effect 
against pneumonia.  In contrast, for serotypes in the vaccine, 7vPnC has demonstrated a high 
degree of efficacy against IPD in infants and young children and efficacy against acute otitis 
media (AOM); published studies have reported efficacy and effectiveness against pneumonia.  
13vPnC has been licensed subsequently for children up to 5 years of age of age based on a 
favorable immunogenicity profile compared to 7vPnC, with an expectation of effectiveness for 
all serotypes.  
Of these arguments, the CHMP considered that the number of vaccine preventable cases in the 
proposed age group is considerably lower than in younger children (pre-vaccination era).  
Initially, the CHMP was of the opinion that the expected benefit of vaccination in healthy children 5-17 
years of age is considered limited, while the benefit in risk groups is expected to be larger, but no 
efficacy or safety data in such subjects have been submitted. This was considered a major 
shortcoming; therefore the MAH was requested to provide a justification of the adequacy of 
extrapolating efficacy and safety data from healthy children to high risk groups. The MAH provided an 
overview of the published literature supporting the benefit of Prevenar (7-valent) in risk groups, i.e. 
significant immune responses were demonstrated. In healthy children it has been shown that immune 
responses to Prevenar13 were non-inferior to those of Prevenar for the 7 common serotypes, and that 
the immune responses were of similar magnitude to the 6 additional serotypes. It can be concluded 
that this will be the case also in risk groups. The MAH is conducting studies (6096A1-3014, 6115A1-
Assessment report  
EMA/89713/2013  
Page 17/30 
 
 
 
 
3002 as part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan and 6115A1-3003 as a pharmacovigilance activity) 
that will provide immunogenicity data in various risk groups and these results will be submitted as 
supporting evidence. Regarding safety in risk groups the ongoing studies are not likely to detect rare 
events, and post-marketing surveillance will be in placed. 
Risk group children are considered a very important group to protect against pneumococcal infections. 
Some countries (i.e. USA and Ireland) are already recommending the use of Prevenar 13 to older risk 
group children. There is clearly a medical need for effective vaccines for risk groups up to 18 years.  
Currently the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine is used in risk groups from 2 years of age in many 
countries. The data to support this use is considered limited.  
2.3.  Clinical Safety aspects  
The data relevant to the current age expansion submission are from Study 6096A1-3011 group 3 (ages 
≥5 years to <10 years) and group 4 (ages ≥10 years to <18 years). Group 3 enrolled subjects in the 
specified age range who had received at least 1 dose of marketed 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (7vPnC, Prevenar), while group 4 enrolled subjects in the specified age range who had not 
received any doses of 7vPnC or any other pneumococcal vaccine. At study entry, all subjects received 
1 dose of open-label 13vPnC administered intramuscularly in the left arm.  
Safety was evaluated based on information regarding solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs. Solicited AEs 
included local reactions and systemic events, which were to be evaluated and recorded by the 
parent/legal guardian in an electronic diary (e-diary) for 7 days after vaccination. In addition, 
information was to be reported regarding unsolicited AEs that occurred from the day of vaccination 
through the 1-month post-vaccination visit. At the 6-month telephone contact, the parent/legal 
guardian was asked to report any newly diagnosed medical conditions, as well as any hospitalisations 
or serious adverse events (SAEs) that had occurred since the 1-month follow-up visit. 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Safety assessment methods: 
Local reactions (tenderness, redness, and swelling at the vaccine injection site): Tenderness was 
recorded as no discernible tenderness, tenderness present, or tenderness interfered with limb 
movement. For redness and swelling, the parent/legal guardian measured the actual size of the 
reaction with a caliper. For analysis purposes, measurements recorded for redness and swelling were 
categorized as absent (no redness or swelling present), mild (1 to 4 caliper units), moderate (5 to 14 
caliper units), or severe (>14 caliper units). 
Systemic events (fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, decreased sleep, hives 
[urticaria], and the use of antipyretic medications to prevent or treat symptoms): 
Temperature was measured at bedtime using an age-appropriate method. Severity of fever was 
categorized as absent, mild (≥100.4°F to ≤102.2°F), moderate (≥102.2°F to ≤104.0°F), or severe 
(≥104.0°F) for analysis. Other systemic events were reported as present or absent. 
Assessment report  
EMA/89713/2013  
Page 18/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events: AEs were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). The relation between an AE and study vaccine was categorized as related or not related. AE 
severity was categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. 
Endpoints 
The safety endpoints were local reactions, systemic events, and AEs. No formal statistical comparisons 
were made. The percentage of subjects with local reactions and systemic events reported within the 7-
day post-vaccination period was summarized for each age group. Only subjects actually reporting the 
reaction/event were included in the summary statistics. AEs were summarized by age group for each 
vaccine dose. All summaries showed the number and percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 event 
and the number of such events. Summaries of severe or life-threatening AEs and AEs by relationship 
to vaccine were prepared. 
For exploratory subgroup analyses of AEs and reactogenicity, subjects were categorized by the number 
of Prevnar doses they had received before study enrollment, provided that more than 20% of subjects 
in an age group had received the same number of Prevnar doses. Because the number of doses was 
not controlled, no formal statistical within-group comparisons were made. 
Analysis Population 
The safety population included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 13vPnC. 
2.3.2.  Results 
Overall exposure 
A total of 294 subjects were vaccinated in group 3, and 298 subjects were vaccinated in group 4. All 
vaccinated subjects were within the protocol-specified age range at the time of vaccination. 
The most common medical history by system organ class (SOC) in both age groups were respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and infections and infestations. In each group, 17.4% of subjects 
had a medical history of asthma. 
Local Reactions 
At least 1 local reaction was reported within 7 days of vaccine administration for 89.6% of subjects in 
group 3 and for 90.5% of subjects in group 4 (Table 9). The most frequent local reaction was 
tenderness, which occurred in 86.8% of subjects in group 3 and 89.0% of subjects in group 4. The 
percentage of subjects reporting significant tenderness was higher in group 4 (43.8%) than in group 3 
(19.5%). Most reports of redness or swelling were of mild or moderate severity. Severe redness and 
severe swelling were each reported in < 3.3% of subjects in either group. The severity of redness or 
swelling categorised by maximum diameter is shown in the Table below.

b. N = number of subjects reporting yes for at least 1 day or no for all days. 
c. Includes reports of no reaction that are not included in the category “>0 – 2.4”. 
The mean duration for each type of local reaction ranged from 1.9 days to 2.4 days in Group 3 and 
from 1.3 days to 2.2 days in group 4. In both groups, the highest incidences of tenderness occurred on 
days 1 and 2, and the highest incidences of redness and of swelling occurred on days 2 and 3 (data not 
shown). Thereafter, the percentages of subjects reporting tenderness, redness, and swelling 
diminished over time.

d. Mild, 0.5 – 2.0 cm; moderate, 2.5 – 7.0 cm; severe, >7.0 cm. 
Systemic Events 
The percentage of subjects with any systemic event was similar in group 3 (47.2%) and group 4 
(51.4%), see Table 10. In both groups, the most frequently reported types of systemic events were 
irritability, increased sleep, and decreased appetite, all reported for between 21.2% and 31.2% of 
subjects in each group. Decreased sleep was reported for a higher percentage of subjects in group 4 
(18.8%) than in group 3 (5.7%). Hives were reported for 4 (1.9%) subjects in group 3 and 3 (1.4%) 
subjects in group 4.

Most cases of fever were mild (≥38.0°C but <39.0°C), with 4.2% of subjects in group 3 and 5.1% of 
subjects in group 4 reporting mild fever. Severe fever (>40°C) was reported for 1 subject (0.5%) in 
each group. The use of antipyretic medications to treat or prevent symptoms was reported for 45.1% 
of subjects in group 3 and for 33.1% of subjects in group 4. 
The incidence of systemic events and use of antipyretic medications was generally highest on day 1, 
day 2 or day 3 in both age groups (data not shown). The mean durations of the systemic events were 
similar in the 2 age groups and did not exceed 3.0 days in either age group.

Unsolicited Adverse Events 
The incidence of unsolicited AEs occurring through approximately 1 month after vaccination was similar 
in group 3 (19.4%) and in group 4 (24.2%). In both vaccine groups, the most frequently reported 
types of AEs were infections and infestations (10.2% in group 3 and 10.4% in group 4). Nervous 
system disorders were reported for more subjects in group 4 (14, 4.7%) than in group 3 (5, 1.7%). 
The most frequently reported AEs in group 3 were cough (10 subjects, 3.4%), vomiting (8 subjects, 
2.7%), pyrexia (7 subjects, 2.4%), and streptococcal pharyngitis (6 subjects, 2.0%). The most 
frequently reported individual AEs in group 4 were headache (10 subjects, 3.4%), and cough, 
oropharyngeal pain, pharyngitis, influenza, and sinusitis (each in 5 subjects, 1.7%). AEs after 
vaccination were generally consistent with childhood illnesses common in the respective age groups. At 
the 6-month follow-up telephone contact, AE reports were to include only newly diagnosed chronic 
medical conditions and SAEs. At this time point, AEs were reported for 2.4% of subjects in group 3 and 
1.7% in group 4. In group 3, 7 subjects reported 7 AEs: bronchial hyperreactivity (2 patients), asthma 
(2 patients), and myopia, irritable bowel syndrome, and allergic rhinitis, in 1 subject each. In group 4, 
5 subjects reported 5 AEs: diarrhoea, migraine, depression, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. AEs that the 
investigator considered related to study vaccination were reported for 3 subjects (1.0%) in each group. 
In group 3, 3 subjects reported a total of 6 related AEs: headache (in 2 subjects), and diarrhoea, 
nausea, vomiting, and pyrexia (in 1 subject each). In group 4, 3 subjects reported a total of 7 related 
AEs: headache (in 2 subjects), and nausea, injection site pain, injection site pruritis, back pain, and 
dizziness (in 1 subject each). No AEs considered related to study vaccine were reported at the 6-month 
follow-up telephone contact.

Deaths and other serious adverse events 
No subjects died during the study. Two SAEs were reported during the study. One subject in group 3 
experienced appendicitis on the day of vaccination. One subject in group 4 experienced moderate 
asthma on day 161 after vaccination. Neither of these events was considered related to study vaccine, 
and both resolved. 
Post-marketing experience 
This section is not applicable, as 13vPnC is not currently approved for use in children over 5 years of 
age. 
2.3.3.  Discussion 
The safety data base in children 5-17 years of age consisted of close to 300 subjects in each age 
cohort (5-9 and 10-18 years respectively) and is considered acceptable. This allows detection of 
adverse events occurring up to a frequency of 1/100, i.e. common adverse events. The presented data 
did not reveal any new safety signal, and the overall data suggested that Prevenar 13 was well 
tolerated in these age groups.  
The MAH has stated that the use of Prevenar 13 is recommended off-licence in the USA and Ireland in 
children up to 18 years of age at increased risk for pneumococcal infections. Therefore the statement 
that post-marketing data are not relevant as the product is not currently licensed in this age group is 
not acceptable.  
2.4.  Risk management plan 
Based on the safety conclusions, the CHMP requested the submission of an updated Risk Management 
Plan within this procedure (see the summary Table below).

Special warnings and precautions 
for use 
Individuals with impaired immune 
responsiveness, whether due to the 
use of immune-suppressive 
therapy, a genetic defect, human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection, or other causes, may 
have reduced antibody response to 
active immunization. 
Safety and immunogenicity data 
for Prevenar 13 are not available 
for individuals in specific 
immunocompromised groups (eg, 
congenital or acquired splenic 
dysfunction, HIV infected, 
malignancy, hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant, nephrotic 
syndrome) and vaccination should 
be considered on an individual 
basis. 
Limited data have demonstrated 
that Prevenar 7 valent (three-dose 
primary series) induces an 
acceptable immune response in 
infants with sickle cell disease 
with a safety profile similar to that 
observed in non-high-risk groups 
(see section 5.1). 
The potential risk of apnoea and 
the need for respiratory monitoring 
for 48-72 h should be considered 
when administering the primary 
immunisation series to very 
premature infants (born < 28 
weeks of gestation), and 
particularly for those with a 
previous history of respiratory 
immaturity. As the benefit of 
vaccination is high in this group of 
infants, vaccination should not be 
withheld or delayed.

in pregnant women. Animal 
studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with 
respect to reproductive toxicity. 
It is unknown whether 
pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate 
is excreted in human milk. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance 
was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
2.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused 
by Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants and children from 6 weeks to 5 17 years of age. 
Posology and method of administration 
4.2 
Unvaccinated infants and children ≥ 7 months of age 
Children aged 2-5 17 years  
One single dose of 0.5 ml. 
Children 5 –17 years  
Children 5 to 17 years of age may receive a single dose of Prevenar 13 if they have been previously 
vaccinated with one or more doses of Prevenar. This dose of Prevenar 13 should be administered at 
least 8 weeks after the final dose of Prevenar (7-valent) (see section 5.1). 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
4.5 
Children 6 to 17 years of age 
No data are currently available regarding concomitant use with other vaccines.  
Undesirable effects 
4.8 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in children 6 weeks to 5 years of age were vaccination-
site reactions, fever, irritability, decreased appetite, and increased and/or decreased sleep. 
Children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years of age  
Safety was evaluated in 592 children aged 6 to 17 years of age 294 children aged 5 to 10 years 
previously immunised with at least one dose of Prevenar and 298 children aged 10 to 17 years who 
had not received a pneumococcal vaccine.   
The most common adverse events in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age were: 
Nervous system disorders: 
Common: 
Headaches 
Gastrointestinal disorders: 
Very common: 
Common:  
Decreased appetite 
Vomiting; diarrhoea

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: 
Common: 
Rash; urticaria or urticaria-like rash   
General disorders and administration site conditions: 
Very common: 
Irritability; any vaccination-site erythema; induration/swelling or 
pain/tenderness; somnolence; poor quality sleep;  
vaccination-site tenderness (including impaired movement) 
Common: 
Pyrexia 
Other adverse events previously observed in infants and children 6 weeks to 5 years of age may also 
be applicable to this age group but were not seen in this study possibly due to the small sample size. 
5.1 
Burden of disease in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
In children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years, the incidence of pneumococcal disease is low, 
however, there is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in those with underlying co-morbidities.  
Children and Adolescents 5 to 17 years of age  
In an open-label study in 592 healthy children and adolescents including those with asthma (17.4%) 
who may be predisposed to pneumococcal infection, Prevenar 13 elicited immune responses to all 13 
serotypes. A single dose of Prevenar 13 was given to children 5 to 10 years of age previously 
vaccinated with at least 1 dose of Prevenar, and children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age who 
had never received a pneumococcal vaccine. 
In both the children 5 to 10 years of age and children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years, the 
immune response to Prevenar 13 was non inferior to Prevenar for the 7 common serotypes and to 
Prevenar 13 for the 6 additional serotypes compared to the immune response after the fourth dose in 
infants vaccinated at 2, 4, 6 and 12-15 months of age as measured by serum IgG. 
In children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years of age OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination  were 
noninferior to OPA GMTs in the 5 to 10 year old age group for 12 of the 1  serotypes (except serotype 
3).

years of age because it has been available for a longer period of time. These side effects may be 
reported in the future with Prevenar 13: 
Pyrexia 
The  CHMP  accepted  the  revision  of  the  local  representative  details  for  Cyprus  listed  in  the  Package 
Leaflet. 
During  the  procedure,  the  CHMP  requested  the  following  additional  amendments  to  the  Product 
Information: 
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Children and Adolescents 5 to 17 years of age  
The CHMP recommend the revision of the first sentence as follows and it was accepted by the MAH. 
In  an  open-label  study  in 592  healthy  children  and  adolescents  including  those  with  asthma  (17.4%) 
who  may  be  are  considered  predisposed  to  pneumococcal  infection,  Prevenar  13  elicited  immune 
responses to all 13 serotypes. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH has provided data from one clinical study in children >5 and ≤17 years of age. Overall the 
results of this study support substantial immune responses that are very likely to be protective in 
children 5-17 years of age, and the safety profile was considered acceptable. The expected benefit of 
Prevenar 13 in healthy children >5 and ≤17 years of age is considered limited as the incidence of 
disease is much lower than in younger children. The proposed SPC includes a section on burden of 
disease in this age group in section 5.1, which was considered adequate. The CHMP requested to 
emphasise by adding this information to section 4.1 as well.  
The benefit of Prevenar 13 in children belonging to risk groups, e.g. immunocompromised or with other 
underlying conditions is expected to be greater, as the risk of pneumococcal infections is higher as well 
as the morbidity and mortality. Currently the recommendations for these children often include the 23-
valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines. There are no data comparing immune responses in 
children>5 and ≤17 years of age between Prevenar 13 and 23v polysaccharide vaccines. In adults the 
immune responses to all 12 of the common serotypes were non-inferior, and for 9 serotypes superior 
for Prevenar 13 compared to 23v polysaccharide vaccines, but it is unknown if this is the case also for 
children >5 and ≤17 years of age.

The provided overview of the published literature supports the benefit of Prevenar (7-valent) in risk 
groups, i.e. significant immune responses are demonstrated. In healthy children it has been shown 
that immune responses to Prevenar13 were non-inferior to Prevenar. Therefore, the CHMP concluded 
that Prevenar 13 offers a benefit to risk groups based on extrapolation of immunogenicity and 
effectiveness data for Prevenar. In addition, the MAH is conducting studies that will provide 
immunogenicity data in various risk groups as supporting evidence.  
The safety data obtained in the published studies is considered limited both because many of the 
studies were small and because safety was not always reported in the publications. However, no 
specific safety signals were identified in the currently available data. In healthy children the same type 
and frequency of adverse reactions was observed after administration of Prevenar and Prevenar 13, 
and it is therefore reasonable to extrapolate safety data from Prevenar to Prevenar 13. Safety data 
from the ongoing studies in risk groups are not likely to detect rare events.  
In conclusion, the sought indication is considered approvable, and the data on risk groups from 
ongoing studies will be provided as post-authorisation measures.  
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Variation(s) accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Update  of  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.5,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC  to  include  information  related  to  the 
extension of the indication to include children from 6 to 17 years of age. The MAH took the opportunity 
to revise the local representative details for Cyprus that are listed in the Package Leaflet. 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet.

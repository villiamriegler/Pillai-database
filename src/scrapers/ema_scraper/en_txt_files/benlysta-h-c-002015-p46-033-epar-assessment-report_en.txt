1.  Introduction 
On 26 June 2023,  the MAH  submitted a completed paediatric study for Benlysta, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006,  as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
Belimumab (BENLYSTA) is a BLyS-specific inhibitor that blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B-cell 
survival factor, to its receptors on B cells. Belimumab IV is approved for the treatment of patients (5 
years of age and older) with active autoantibody positive SLE. BENLYSTA for SC use is approved only 
for the treatment of adult patients with  SLE. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study 200908  is part of a paediatric investigation plan (EMEA-000520-PIP02-13-
M04).  The variation application consisting of the full relevant data package is planned to be submitted 
as a Type II Variation to apply for an indication in paediatric patients once additional documentation 
needed for the variation dossier are available.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The investigational product used during this study was belimumab for SC injection via autoinjector as 
supplied by GSK. Participants were dosed with belimumab according to body weight. Belimumab  
200 mg SC was administered as shown in the following table:

Description 
This was a single arm, multi-center open-label study to evaluate the PK, safety, and PD of SC 
belimumab plus background standard therapy in approximately 28 paediatric participants 5 to 17 years 
of age and weighing ≥15 kg with active SLE.  
Methods 
Study design 
The study included: 
•  Part A: Open-label, 12-week treatment phase 
•  Part B: Optional 40-week open-label continuation phase for any participant who completed Part 
A 
•  Post-treatment follow-up assessments at 8 and 16 weeks after the last dose of SC belimumab 
•  Optional Access Extension Phase: Optional post-Week 52 extension phase exclusively for 
eligible participants who complete Part B (e.g., participants from countries where the IV 
formulation is not approved for paediatric use; or participants in whom IV Benlysta is not 
suitable due to medical reasons or significant logistical challenges). As of this report writing, 
the optional Access Extension Phase of the study is ongoing 
Study participants 
Eligible participants were 5 to 17 years of age with clinically active SLE disease, defined as a SELENA 
SLEDAI disease activity score of ≥6 at screening. Participants had to have 4 or more of the 11 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of SLE either at screening or in 
the past. Participants also had to have an unequivocally positive test result for anti-nuclear antibody 
(ANA) titer ≥1:80  and/or anti-dsDNA ≥30 IU/mL serum antibody test based on either the study’s 
central laboratory results or the local laboratory results. Participants were to be on a stable SLE 
treatment regimen at a fixed dose for at least 30 days prior to Day 1. 
Key exclusion criteria included severe active CNS lupus or severe lupus nephritis.  
Treatments 
The investigational product used during this study was belimumab for SC injection via autoinjector as 
supplied by GSK. Participants were dosed with belimumab according to body weight. Belimumab 200 
mg SC was administered as shown in the following table: 
Part B  was an optional 40-week open-label continuation phase, open to all participants who completed 
Part A. Dosing of SC belimumab continued at the same frequency, or it may have required a change 
in frequency according to change in body weight.  
The Optional Access Extension Phase provided a mechanism for continued access to belimumab SC 
from Week 52 onward and was open only for eligible participants who completed Part B. Dosing of SC

belimumab continued at the same frequency or it may have required a change in frequency according 
to change in body weight. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective was to o characterize the PK profile of belimumab 200 mg SC in paediatric SLE 
participants.  
Secondary/other objectives were: 
•  Safety: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab 200 mg SC in paediatric SLE 
participants  
•  Biomarkers: to characterize the pharmacodynamic profile of belimumab 200 mg SC in 
paediatric SLE participants 
• 
Efficacy: to characterize the impact of belimumab 200 mg SC on disease activity in paediatric 
SLE participants. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints were the PK of observed belimumab concentrations at Week 12, and 
steady state PK parameters including Cavg (AUC), Cmax, and Cmin (based on population PK 
estimates). 
The secondary endpoints were safety, including the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AEs of 
special interest through Week 52, and PD/biomarker endpoints including change from baseline in 
C3/C4, anti-dsDNA, B cell subsets, and immunoglobulins at Weeks 12 and 52. In addition, other PD 
parameters that were assessed but were not specified an endpoint for this study were ANA, C reactive 
protein, and BLyS protein. 
To support the other objective/endpoint, and to characterize the impact of belimumab 200 mg SC on 
disease activity in paediatric SLE participants, the efficacy endpoint in this study was the SELENA 
SLEDAI Disease Assessment Scale. The outcome for the efficacy endpoint was defined as the percent 
of participants with  a ≥4-point reduction from baseline in SELENA SLEDAI score at Week 12 and Week 
52. Additional efficacy endpoints of interest that were assessed but were not supportive of a study 
objective were proteinuria and prednisone dose. 
Sample size 
Assuming a 20% screen-failure rate, it was expected that 36 participants would need to be screened 
so that approximately 28 participants would be enrolled, (treated with at least one dose of study 
treatment) aiming for 24 evaluable participants at Week 12. The sample size of 24 participants and the 
specified sampling schedule allow estimation of central clearance and volume of distribution, with a 
power of 99.9% and 99.7%, respectively (mean 95% confidence intervals were 83.8-116.2% and 
80.5-119.5%,  respectively). 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study with a single treatment arm. 
Statistical Methods 
This study was designed to descriptively evaluate PK, safety, and PD of belimumab during Parts A and 
B, and as such no formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.

Number analysed 
A total of 25 patients was included in the  ITT population. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
Pharmacokinetic assessments, the primary endpoint in this study, were designed to characterize the 
PK profile of belimumab 200 mg SC in paediatric SLE participants based on observed belimumab 
concentrations at Week 12, and steady-state PK parameters including Cmin, Cavg, Cmax, and AUC 
derived from a population PK analysis. 
Samples for PK analysis were collected in Part A and Part B. No PK samples are obtained during the 
optional access extension phase. Observed belimumab concentrations by study week for the paediatric 
SC study 200908 are graphically illustrated below in Figure 1. 
Belimumab concentrations in the pediatric SC study were approaching steady state by Week 12 (Figure 
1). Observed Week 12 concentrations (geometric mean) were 106.42 μg/mL (all patients, N=25), 
134.23  μg/mL (Cohort 1, N=13)  and 82.76  μg/mL (Cohort 2, N=12). 
In general, over the 52-week study belimumab concentrations were slightly higher in Cohort 1 (≥50 
kg, weekly dosing) compared to Cohort 2 (≥30 kg to <50 kg, every 10-day dosing), indicating the 
lower dosing frequency of Cohort 2 on exposure. Overall, the observed concentrations were

Table 5. Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term (ITT Population)
SOCs with ≥20%  of participants experiencing an AE were infections and infestations (72.0%), general 
disorders and administration site conditions (32.0%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (28.0%), 
investigations (20%),  and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (20%).

The most common AE overall was COVID-19 (36.0%), followed by injection site pain, leukopenia, and 
neutropenia, with  each occurring in 16.0% of participants. 
No deaths, malignancies, infections of special interest, incidents of depression, suicidality, or self-injury 
were reported through Part A and B of the study. 
Post-injection systemic reactions were reported in a total 3 (12.0%) participants through Part A and B 
of the study. Post-injection systemic reactions per anaphylactic reaction CMQ broad search included 
the PTs drug hypersensitivity, erythema, and injection site urticaria. There were no serious post-
injection systemic reactions AESI and no post-injection systemic reactions AESI which led to 
discontinuation  of study agent. 
The incidence of local injection site reactions in all participants was 32%;  8 participants experienced 17 
injection site reaction events. All events were mild and non-serious. Belimumab was continued in all 8 
participants, and the events resolved. Injection site reactions that occurred in more than 1 participant 
were injection site pain (16.0%) and injection site erythema (8.0%). Two events in 1 participant 
(injection site hemorrhage and injection site swelling) were considered by the investigator to be 
unrelated to belimumab. All other events were considered by the investigator to be related to 
belimumab.  
Two device malfunctions were reported with the use of belimumab autoinjectors during this study. The 
2 device malfunctions that were reported are “cannot push needle to activate injection” and “device 
leaking.” All device functional issues were evaluated and considered to have no impact on safety. In 
addition, SAEs were reviewed, and none were attributed to be a medical device “incident or near 
incident”. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Belimumab is a BLyS-specific inhibitor that blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B-cell survival factor, 
to its  receptors on B cells. Belimumab IV is approved for the treatment of patients (5 years of age and 
older) with active autoantibody positive SLE. BENLYSTA for SC use is approved only for the treatment 
of adult patients with  SLE. 
On 26 June 2023,  the MAH  submitted a completed paediatric study for Benlysta, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006,  as amended. The study is part of a paediatric investigation 
plan (EMEA-000520-PIP02-13-M04).  Based on this study, the MAH plans to submit a Type II Variation 
to apply for an indication in paediatric patients.  
Study 200908  was a single arm, multi-centre open-label study to evaluate the PK, safety, and PD of 
SC belimumab plus background standard therapy in paediatric participants 5 to 17 years of age with 
active SLE. This submission includes data from the open-label endpoint analysis (Parts A and B). 
Eligible participants were 5 to 17 years of age with clinically active SLE disease, defined as a SELENA 
SLEDAI disease activity score of ≥6 at screening. Participants were to be on a stable SLE treatment 
regimen at a fixed dose for at least 30 days prior to Day 1. Patients with severe active CNS lupus or 
severe lupus nephritis were excluded from the study. 
Participants were dosed with SC belimumab 200 mg via autoinjector according to body weight (dosing 
frequency every week, every 10 days or every 2 weeks). The study included the following parts: 
•  Part A: Open-label, 12-week treatment phase 
•  Part B: Optional 40-week open-label continuation phase for any participant who completed Part 
A

•  Post-treatment follow-up assessments at 8 and 16 weeks after the last dose of SC belimumab 
•  Optional Access Extension Phase: Optional post-Week 52 extension phase exclusively for 
eligible participants who complete Part B (e.g., participants from countries where the IV 
formulation is not approved for paediatric use; or participants in whom IV Benlysta is not 
suitable due to medical reasons or significant logistical challenges). As of this report writing, 
the optional Access Extension Phase of the study is ongoing 
The primary objective was to o characterize the PK profile of belimumab 200 mg SC in paediatric SLE 
participants. Secondary objectives were safety biomarkers and efficacy. No formal statistical 
hypothesis testing was planned. 
A total of 25 patients were included in the study and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The mean 
age of the patients was 14 years (range 10-17). Two (8.0%) participants withdrew from the study 
prior to Week 52, 1 participant due to an adverse event and 1 participant at the investigator’s 
discretion.  
No patient  was included in Cohort 3 (<30 kg), 12 patients  received every 10 day-dosing (Cohort 2, 
≥30 kg to <50  kg), and 13 patients received QW dosing (Cohort 1, >50 kg). Overall, the median 
concentration at week 12 was similar to the concentration observed in the adult population (Study BEL 
112341). 
A total of 22/25  patients (88%) experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE) and 1/25 patients (4%) 
experienced at least 1 serious AE (COVID-19). The most common system organ classes affected were 
infections and infestations (72.0%),  general disorders and administration site conditions (32.0%), 
blood and lymphatic system disorders (28.0%), investigations (20%), and skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders (20%). The most common AE overall was COVID-19 (36.0%), followed by injection 
site pain, leukopenia, and neutropenia, with each occurring in 16.0% of participants. 
No deaths, malignancies, infections of special interest, incidents of depression, suicidality, or self-injury 
were reported through Part A and B of the study. 
No new safety concerns were identified during the study. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study 200908  was a single arm, multi-centre open-label study to evaluate the PK, safety, and PD of 
SC belimumab in paediatric participants 5 to 17 years of age with active SLE. A total of 25 patients 
were included. No new safety concerns were identified.  
The MAH stated that  study 200908  is part of a paediatric investigation plan (EMEA-000520-PIP02-13-
M04).  The MAH indicated that  a variation application consisting of the full relevant data package is 
planned to be submitted as a Type II Variation to apply for an indication in paediatric patients once 
additional documentation needed for the variation dossier are available.

subjects were coadministered lurasidone and posaconazole

fold increase in lurasidone exposure and a persistent effect 
of posaconazole on lurasidone (up to 2-3 weeks after stop 
of co-administration), the CHMP agreed to update the 
SmPC of Latuda in order to reflect new drug interactions 
between a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (i.e.posaconazole) and 
lurasidone.

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of

For study D1050326 the primary efficacy endpoint was 
paediatric data available in children and adolescent 
patients (10-17 years of age) with bipolar I disorder, 
upon request by CHMP following the assessment of 
the paediatric study D1050326 submitted according 
to Art. 46 procedure (no. 
EMEA/H/C/002713/P46/008). In addition, section 4.2 
of the SmPC has been updated to cross refer to 
section 5.1. 
C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL 
intended to implement the outcome of a procedure 
concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the 
assessment done under A 45/46 - Change(s) with 
new additional data submitted by the MAH 
defined as the mean change from baseline to Week 6 in 
Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) Total 
Score. The key secondary endpoint was Clinical Global 
Impression – Bipolar Version, Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-
S) Depression Score. Statistically significant differences 
favouring lurasidone over placebo were shown for these 
endpoints for the total population studied, beginning at 
Week 2 and were maintained at each study visit through to 
the end of the study. However, the primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints were not met in younger 
patients (below 15 years of age). 
The safety profile of lurasidone in children included in this 
short-term study is in general consistent with that observed 
when treated within the approved indication in adults, 
however, differences in frequency of the most commonly 
occurred adverse reactions have been observed in 
paediatric patients for nausea (very common), diarrhoea 
(common) and decreased appetite (common), compared 
with adults (common, unknown, and uncommon, 
respectively).   
Based on these paediatric data sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC have been updated accordingly.

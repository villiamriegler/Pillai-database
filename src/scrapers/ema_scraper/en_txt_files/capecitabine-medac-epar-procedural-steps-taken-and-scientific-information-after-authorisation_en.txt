France requested on 13 March 2019 the opinion of 
the European Medicines Agency to assess the need 
to take action at EU level regarding the detection of 
DPD deficient patients (especially through 
genotyping and/or phenotyping) in patients treated 
with fluorouracil and related substances 
(capecitabine, tegafur and flucytosine). The Agency 
was requested to assess the impact thereof on the 
EMEA/H/A-31/1481/C/002568/0021

opinion on whether the marketing authorisation of 
these products should be maintained, varied, 
suspended or revoked.

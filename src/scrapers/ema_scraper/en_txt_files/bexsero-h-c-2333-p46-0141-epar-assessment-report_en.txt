Study design 
This trial (V72P12E2) is an extension of study V72P12E1. It was conducted as a multicenter study and 
enrolled approximately 4-year-old subjects, who completed the vaccination course of study V72P12E1 
(called follow-on subjects in this report), and who met all other enrollment criteria for this extension 
study, were eligible to participate. The description of the vaccine groups in this study and their 
vaccination schedule in the previous extension trial is detailed in Table 2-1.

Note: Groups names as used in original study V72P12E1 - aGroup 1a; bGroup 1b; cGroup 1c; dGroup 
2a; eGroup 2b; fGroup 2c; gGroup 3a, hGroup 3b, iGroup 3c. Subjects of B+R246 (12/18/24) and 
B246 (12/18/24) groups from V72P12E1 were randomized in 2:1 ratio into: Nonvaccination subset #1 
and vaccination subset #2. 
Study population /Sample size 
Number of Subjects: 
Based on the number of subjects who completed their vaccination course in study V72P12E1, up to a 
maximum of ~1510 subjects (follow-on groups) were eligible to participate in this extension study. The

study centers in Germany and Belgium, which had enrolled 271 and 175 subjects respectively, in the 
V72P12E1 study, did not participate in this extension study. 
A group of approximately 190 newly recruited vaccine naive subjects (B48_50 group), of similar age to 
the follow-on subjects were also planned to be enrolled into the study from the same study centers as 
the previous study V72P12E1. In total, up to approximately 1700 subjects could be enrolled in this 
study.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: 
Healthy children, approximately 4 years of age, who participated and completed the vaccination course 
as toddlers in study V72P12E1 and who met all other enrollment criteria for this extension study, were 
eligible to participate. 
An additional study group (vaccine naive subjects group B48_50), consisting of 190 newly recruited, 
vaccine naive, of similar age to the follow-on subjects (approximately 4 years) were enrolled into the 
study. These subjects served as a baseline comparator for comparison of antibody persistence with the 
vaccine-treated groups. The immune response following the first dose also served as a comparator for 
the booster responses in the vaccine groups. 
Treatments 
The investigational vaccine used in this study was the meningococcal B recombinant vaccine 
formulated with outer membrane vesicles derived from N meningitidis serogroup B strain NZ98/254 
(OMV NZ) (rMenB+OMV NZ), (lot number: 112801). The meningococcal B recombinant (rMenB+OMV 
NZ) vaccine was provided as offwhite opalescent suspension for injection. This vaccine was supplied as 
a single-dose syringe. It was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid region.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity Endpoints: 
Following are the endpoints for evaluating immunogenicity against N meningitidis serogroup B indicator 
strains H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713. 
Primary: 
For groups with primary vaccination at 2, 4 6 months of age (with [B+R246] or without [B246] 
concomitant routine vaccinations) and at 2, 3, 4 months of age, [B+R234] (all groups with 4th dose at 
12, 18 or 24 Months of age), the persistence of serum bactericidal activity at 4 years of age was 
assessed by calculating percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5, hSBA titers ≥ 8, hSBA geometric 
mean titers (GMTs), and geometric mean ratio (GMRs) based on GMTs at 1 month after the last 
rMenB+OMV NZ booster vaccination (4th dose) in the V72P12E1 study, to each of the 4 indicator 
strains. All immunogenicity analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS)2. 
Secondary: 
For groups that received two catch-up doses at either 12, 14 (group B12 14), or 18, 20 (group B18 20) 
or 24, 26 months of age (group B24 26) the persistence of serum bactericidal activity at 4 years of age 
was assessed by calculating percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5, hSBA titers ≥ 8, hSBA GMTs, 
and GMRs based on GMTs at 1 month after the last rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination in the V72P12E1 
study, to each of the 4 indicator strains. All immunogenicity analyses were performed on the FAS 
population.

For subset#2 of groups B+R246 (12/18/24) and B246 (12/18/24) and for all subjects in B+R234 
(12/18/24): induction of bactericidal antibodies at 1 month following a 5th dose boost of rMenB+OMV 
NZ vaccination was characterized by calculating hSBA GMTs, percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 
5 and ≥ 8, and 4-fold increase to each of the 4 indicator strains. 
For groups that received a two-dose catch-up in V72P12E1, induction of bactericidal antibodies at 1 
month following a 3rd dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination was characterized by calculating SBA 
GMTs, percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5 and ≥ 8, and 4-fold increase to each of the 4 
indicator strains. 
In healthy naïve children of ~4 years of age after a two-dose catch-up, a sufficient immune response 
of rMenB+OMV NZ was defined as the lower limit of the twosided 95% CI for the percentage of 
subjects achieving hSBA titers ≥ 5 at 1 month after the two-dose series to be ≥70% for all 3 indicator 
strains. Analysis on strain M10713 for naive group was descriptive. 
Baseline antibody levels measured in vaccine naive subjects at approximately 4 years of age (B48_50) 
served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 4 years of age in follow-on 
subjects from parent study V72P12E1. The immune response following the first dose also served as a 
comparator for the booster responses in the follow-on groups. The antibody response to catch-up 
doses at 4 years of age in vaccine naïve subjects also served to gain experience with catch-up 
immunizations with rMenB+OMV NZ in older age group. 
Safety Endpoints 
All subjects who received at least one dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in this study and who provided 
any postvaccination safety data were included in the safety and tolerability analyses. All safety 
analyses were descriptive. 
Solicited local and systemic adverse events: 
Incidences of solicited local adverse events (AEs) (i.e., pain, erythema, induration, swelling) and 
systemic AEs (i.e., fever [defined as axillary temperature ≥ 38.0 °C], change in eating habits, 
sleepiness, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, headache, arthralgia, and rash) occurring during the 7 days 
following each study vaccination were summarized by maximal severity and study group. 
Erythema, induration and swelling were categorized as none, 0 to < 10 mm, 10 to < 25 mm, 25 to < 
50 mm, 50 to < 100 mm and ≥ 100 mm. Temperature was taken by the axillary route and was 
analyzed in 0.5 °C increments as follows: < 38.0°C (no fever), 38.0 - 38.4°C, 38.5°C - 38.9°C, 39.0°C 
– 39.4°C, 39.5°C – 39.9°C, ≥ 40.0°C. All other systemic AEs were categorized as mild, moderate or 
severe. 
Additionally, the numbers of subjects who used antipyretic medication (prophylactically or 
therapeutically) within 7 days of study vaccination were summarized. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
All AEs occurring during the 7 days following each study vaccination were collected. Medically attended 
fever was also specifically collected during this time period. Serious adverse events (SAEs) as well as 
AEs that require a medical visit and/or result in premature withdrawal from the study were collected 
throughout the study period.

Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity: The primary analysis population for immunogenicity analysis is the full analysis set 
(FAS). Immunogenicity was evaluated for persistence, booster response and for immunogenicity after 
two catch-up doses in 4-year-old vaccine naïve subjects. 
The percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5 and ≥ 8 and associated two-sided 95% Clopper-
Pearson confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for follow-on groups and vaccine naive group 
(B48_50). In addition, differences in percentages and 95% CIs between follow-on groups vaccine naive 
group were also calculated for persistence and booster analysis. 
All GMTs and associated 95% CIs were computed per group and per strain. For each vaccine group, 
adjusted GMTs and their 95% CIs were obtained by exponentiating (base 10) the least square means 
and the lower and upper limits of the 95% CIs of the log transformed or concentrations (base 10). 
These were obtained from a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors for vaccine and study 
country. Additionally, GMT ratios of follow-on groups to vaccine naive subjects (group B48_50) were 
computed. Further, 95% CIs for the ratios of GMTs were constructed by exponentiating the difference 
of the least square means of the log transformed titers and the lower and upper limits of the 95% CIs. 
The percentage of subjects achieving 4-fold rise over baseline were calculated after 3rd or 5th dose 
boost in follow-on subjects and after first and second dose in vaccine naïve subjects. 
Safety: 
Solicited local and systemic adverse events: Frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing 
each AE are presented for each symptom severity. Summary tables showing the occurrence of any 
local or systemic AE overall and at each time point are also presented. 
Unsolicited adverse events: The original verbatim terms used by investigators to identify AEs in the 
case report forms (CRFs) were mapped to preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). The AEs were then grouped by MedDRA preferred terms into frequency tables 
according to system organ class. All reported AEs, as well as AEs judged by the investigator as at least 
possibly related to study vaccine, are summarized according to system organ class and preferred term 
within system organ class. These summaries are presented by vaccination group. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 242 follow-on subjects from groups B+R246 (12/18/24; N=38+ 41+ 43) and B246 
(12/18/24; N=47+36+37) from V72P12E1 study were assigned to nonvaccination subset 1 in this 
extension study V72P12E2 for persistence analysis only. All subjects enrolled in the nonvaccination 
subset 1 completed the study.  
A total of 563 subjects were enrolled in the extension study V72P12E2 (Table 10.1-2).

Immunogenicity results 
Antibody Persistence at 4 Years of Age 
Antibody persistence was explored in 2 main groups of subjects in study V72P12E2: 
Subjects who had received a 3-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ at 2, 3, 4 or 2, 4, 6 months of 
age in parent study V72P12, followed by a 4th dose boost at 12, 18 or 24 months of age in 1st 
extension study V72P12E1 (groups B+R246 12, B+R246 18, B+R246 24, B+R246 12_48, B+R246 
18_48, B+R246 24_48, B246 12, B246 18, B246 24, B246 12_48, B246 18_48, B246 24_48, 
B+R234 12_48, B+R234 18_48, and B+R234 24_48; see Table 2.5.4.2-1) (Primary objective). 
Subjects who had received 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 12 and 14, 18 and 20, or 24 and 26 
months of age in  1st extension study V72P12E1 (groups B12 14_48, B18 20_48, and B24 26_48; see 
Table 2.5.4.2-2) (Secondary objective). 
Assessor’s comment: The antibody persistence data show that for strain 5/99 most subjects have 
remaining titres, wile for strainsNZ98/254 (OMV) and H44/76 (fHBP) the seropositivity rates have 
declined substantially. The results for strain M10713 are similar to what has been seen in other 
studies, i.e. the baseline titres are very high, making it more difficult to interpret results.  
The results for the 3-dose primed groups and the 2-dose catch-up groups were overall similar. For the 
catch-up groups the confidence intervals were wide in the smaller groups.

indicator strains H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713. 
Antibody response to booster vaccination was characterized in 2 main groups of subjects in study 
V72P12E2: 
Subjects who had received a 3-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ at 2, 3, 4 or 2, 4, 6 months of 
age in parent study V72P12, followed by a 4th dose boost at 12, 18 or 24 months of age in study 
V72P12E1, and a 5th dose boost at 4 years of age in study V72P12E2 (groups B+R246 12_48, B+R246 
18_48, B+R246 24_48, B246 12_48, B246 18_48, B246 24_48, B+R234 12_48, B+R234 18_48, and 
B+R234 24_48; see Table 2.5.4.3-1) (Secondary objective). 
Subjects who had received 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 12 and 14, 18 and 20, or 24 and 26 
months of age in study V72P12E1 and a 3rd dose boost at 4 years of age in study V72P12E2 (groups 
B12 14_48, B18 20_48, and B24 26_48; see Table 2.5.4.3-2) (Secondary objective).

b One month after 1st dose of rMenB+OMV NZ administered for vaccine-naïve subjects (group B48_50). 
Assessor’s comment: The responses to a single booster dose resulted in higher proportions of 
responders in the previously primed groups, regardless of schedule, compared to the previously naïve 
children. These results indicate that all priming schedules induce immunological memory. The results 
for strain M10713 are more difficult to interpret, due to a high proportion of seropositive subjects 
prevaccination.  
Safety results 
Solicited Local and Systemic AEs 
Incidences of solicited local AEs and systemic AEs occurring during the 7 days following each study 
vaccination were summarized by maximal severity and study group.  Additionally, the numbers of

subjects who used antipyretic medication (prophylactically or therapeutically) and those who 
experienced medically attended fever within 7 days of study vaccination were summarized.  
Local and Systemic AEs Following a 5th Dose Boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age 
Across all study groups, most subjects who received a 5th dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of 
age reported at least 1 solicited local or systemic AEs during the first 7 days (90% to 100%). Across 
study groups, 84% to 100% of subjects reported solicited local AEs and 70% to 95% of subjects 
reported solicited systemic AEs. 
The most commonly reported solicited local AE across groups was injection site pain, and severe 
intensity of injection site pain ranged from 11% to 32% (Table 2.5.5.2-1). 
The most commonly reported solicited systemic AE across study groups was irritability and severe 
intensity ranged from 0% to 12% of subjects. Other commonly reported systemic AEs were sleepiness, 
change in eating habits and arthralgia (Table 2.5.5.2-1). 
Across study groups percentages of subjects reporting fever ranged from 4% to 21% of subjects. One 
subject from group B+R234 12_48 reported a temperature ≥ 40°C. Medically attended fever was 
reported in 2 subjects from group B+R246 12_48 and in 1 subject from group B+R234 12_48 (Table 
2.5.5.2-1).

Assessor’s comment: The reactogenicity of Bexsero is in agreement with previously reported results. 
The rates of adverse events are high compared to many other vaccines. The fever rates in this age 
group appear to be somewhat lower compared to the fever rates in infants. 
Local and Systemic AEs Following a 3rd Dose Boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age 
The majority of subjects in study groups that received a 3rd dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of 
age reported at least 1 solicited AE during the first 7 days postvaccination (90% to 100%). Across 
study groups, 90% to 95% of subjects reported solicited local AEs and 60% to 79% of subjects 
reported solicited systemic AEs. 
The most commonly reported solicited local AE across study groups was injection site pain and severe 
intensity was reported in 8% to 19% of subjects. Severe intensity of erythema and induration was 
reported in 2% and 1% of subjects, respectively, from the study group B12 14_48 (Table 2.5.5.2-2). 
Most commonly reported solicited systemic AE across study groups was irritability and severe intensity 
was reported by 6% of subjects from the study group B12 14_48. Other commonly reported systemic 
AEs were sleepiness, change in eating habits (0%-42%), arthralgia and headache (Table 2.5.5.2-2).  
Percentages of subjects reporting fever across study groups ranged from 16% to 42% of subjects. 
None of the subjects reported fever ≥40°C. Medically attended fever was reported in 2 subjects from 
group B12 14_48 and 1 subject from group B18 20_48 (Table 2.5.5.2-2).

Assessor’s comment: The frequencies and severity of AEs did not differ substantially between the 
different vaccination schedules, i.e. following the 5th or 3rd dose. 
Local and Systemic AEs Following Two Catch-up Doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age 
The majority of subjects in group B48_50 that received 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ 2 months 
apart at 4 years of age reported at least 1 solicited AE during the first 7 days after any vaccination 
(97%). Most subjects (94%) reported solicited local AEs and 78% of subjects reported solicited 
systemic AEs. 
The most commonly reported solicited local AE was injection site pain. Severe intensity of pain was 
reported in 13% and 11% of subjects post-1st and -2nd vaccination, respectively. (Table 2.5.5.2-3). 
Most commonly reported solicited systemic AE was sleepiness, with severe intensity reported in 2% 
and 1% of subjects post-1st and 2nd vaccination, respectively. Other commonly reported systemic AEs 
were irritability, change in eating habits and arthralgia (Table 2.5.5.2-3). 
Percentages of subjects reporting fever in study group B48_50 post-1st and 2nd vaccination were 10% 
and 8% of subjects, respectively. Two subjects reported temperature ≥ 40°C post-1st vaccination. 
Medically attended fever was reported in 2 subjects post-1st vaccination and 4 subjects post-2nd 
vaccination (Table 2.5.5.2-3).

Assessor’s comment: The AEs reporting is genereally in agreement in the previously unvaccinated 
group compared to the previously primed groups. 
Unsolicited AEs Following a 5th Dose Boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age 
Percentages of subjects with any and possibly or probably related unsolicited AEs during the first 7 
days following a 5th dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age both ranged from 0% to 37% 
across study groups. 
Unsolicited AEs from day 1 to 7 were reported most commonly in the system organ class (SOC) 
“General disorders and administration site conditions”. Most of these were solicited AEs continuing past 
7 days after vaccination and were considered possibly or probably related to the study vaccination.  
Percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs from day 1 through study termination following a 5th 
dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age ranged from 18% to 38%, and possibly or probably related 
AEs ranged from 0% to 37% across groups (Table 2.5.5.3-1). 
Injection site induration was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE from day 1 through study 
termination, reported in 2% to11% of subjects. All of these were considered possibly or probably 
related to the study vaccination. 
None of the subjects reported SAEs or AEs leading to withdrawal or death from day 1 through study 
termination (Table 2.5.5.3-1).

Unsolicited AEs Following a 3rd Dose Boost of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age 
Percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs during the first 7 days following a 3rd dose boost of 
rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age ranged from 9% to 25% and possibly or probably related AEs ranged 
from 8% to 17% across study groups. 
Unsolicited AEs from day 1 to 7 were reported most commonly (7% to 17% of subjects, none reported 
in B18 20_48) in the SOC “General disorders and administration site conditions”. Possibly or probably 
related AEs were reported in 6% and 8% of subjects in these groups. In group B18 20_48 unsolicited 
AEs were most commonly (9%) in the SOC “Infections and infestations”; all of these were considered 
possibly related to the study vaccination. 
Percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs from day 1 through study termination following a 3rd 
dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 years of age ranged from 18% to 33%, and possibly or probably related 
AEs ranged from 8% to 17% across groups (Table 2.5.5.3-2). 
Pyrexia was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE from day 1 through study termination, 
reported in 3% to17% of subjects across all 3 groups. One subject (group B24 26_48) reported 
possibly related pyrexia. 
None of the subjects reported SAEs or AEs leading to withdrawal or death from day 1 through study 
termination (Table 2.5.5.3-2).

Unsolicited AEs Following Two Catch-up Doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 4 Years of Age 
Following any vaccination at 4 years of age in group B48_50, the percentage of subjects with any 
unsolicited AE during the first 7 days was 29% and possibly or probably related AEs were reported by 
15% of subjects. 
Unsolicited AEs from day 1 to 7 were reported most commonly (10% of subjects) in the SOC “General 
disorders and administration site conditions” and “infections and infestations” after any vaccination. 
Nearly all of the general disorders and administration site conditions and 1% of reported infections and 
infestations were considered possibly or probably related to study vaccine.  
One subject (467017) reported an SAE, gastroenteritis of moderate intensity on day 67 (7 days post-
2nd vaccination at 4 years of age). The event was considered not related to the study vaccination. One 
subject (017006) was withdrawn from study due to an AE (injection site pain of moderate intensity). 
The event was considered probably related to the study vaccination. 
Percentage of subjects with any unsolicited AEs from day 1 through study termination following any 
vaccination at 4 years of age in study group B48_50 was 51% and possibly or probably related AEs 
were reported by 15% of subjects (Table 2.5.5.3-3). 
The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs following any vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ in study 
group B48_50 were injection site induration; cough and bronchitis reported in 6% 5% and 4% of 
subjects respectively. All cases with injection site induration were possibly or probably related to study 
vaccination (Table 12.2.3-9). 
Serious adverse events were reported by 3 subjects (1%) after any vaccination from day 1 through 
study termination. Subject 017025 reported infectious croup, subject 105013 reported concussion, 
contusion and periorbital haematoma and subject 467017 reported gastroenteritis and dehydration. All 
these events were considered not related to the study vaccination. As reported earlier, one subject

Discussion on clinical aspects 
These data represent the longest persistence data presented so far in children with a sample size that 
allows conclusions for most groups. As discussed earlier, the waning antibody titres and seropositivity 
are of concern for two of the antigens, the OMV and fHBP. The respective roles of persisting antibodies 
and immunological memory are not fully understood, and the clinical relevance of the waning titres is 
unclear. It could be discussed whether the persistence data should be included in the SPC, for 
increased transparency of the data. Considering that the relevance of waning titres to two out of four 
antigens, in the presence of immunological memory is unclear it is doubtful that this will be of any 
assistance to the prescribers. Thus, a detailed description of the data is not warranted in the SPC, but 
a brief description of the persistence data could be useful. The MAH is asked to discuss the need 
relevance of these findings, together with other persistence data. Considering the limited time since 
approval, and that the vaccine is only beginning to be used on a larger scale, it is unlikely that 
effectiveness data from post-marketing experience is available yet.

MAH Response 
Novartis acknowledges that persistence data from study V72P12E2 show a decline in antibodies against 
strains NZ98/254 (OMV) and H44/76 (fHbp) in previously primed children 4 years of age. Antibody 
decline after a primary vaccination course is a common feature of the response to infant vaccines 
irrespective of the priming schedule. Nevertheless, immunological measurements are surrogates and 
only indirectly relate to protection. Exposure to the organism (or to a booster dose of the vaccine) 
induces anamnestic antibody responses in most subjects primed as infants even though prechallenge 
antibodies may have dwindled demonstrating evidence the vaccine induced immune memory. (see 
Plotkin, 2008). 
Indeed, the responses to a single booster dose in study V72P12E2 resulted in high percentages of 
subjects achieving protective levels of bactericidal antibodies (hSBA ≥ 1:5) against all 4 indicator 
strains irrespective of the priming schedule. In particular against the NZ98/254 and H44/76 antigens, 
for which the antibody titers declined the most, response to booster vaccination was high (and similar 
to or even higher than responses seen after the 3-dose primary vaccination course (parent study 
V72P12) and after the 4th dose boost (first extension study V72P12E1)). In addition, the responses to 
a booster dose elicited much higher antibody levels in previously primed children compared with 
antibody levels observed in age-matched vaccine naïve children after one dose of rMenB+OMV NZ. 
Moreover, bactericidal antibodies against PorA P1.4 and fHbp, and the persistence of antibodies to 
these antigens will not be the sole predictors of protective activity, as bactericidal activity against other 
vaccine antigens will also contribute to protection. The likelihood that the vaccine is not protective is 
thought to be reduced when bactericidal antibodies induced by vaccination are targeting multiple 
antigens on the surface of the meningococcus. 
Antibodies to multiple antigens may act synergistically to enhance bactericidal activity thus 
underestimating the true protective activity of the vaccine-induced antibodies. For example, there are 
data indicating that antibodies to NHBA and fHbp can cooperate resulting in enhanced bactericidal 
activity (Vu et al. 2011). In addition, Donnelly and colleagues have shown that strains are killed more 
efficiently when targeted by antibodies against two or more antigens (Donnelly et al. 2010). 
The observation that a booster dose at 4 years of age restores hSBA ≥ 1:5 percentages to high values 
suggest powerful anamnestic responses to all 4 indicator strains in children that have been primed as 
infants and received a 4th dose boost as toddlers as per recommendation in the SmPC, irrespective of 
the persisting levels of antibodies against the respective strains present at 4 years of age. Together 
with the argument that bactericidal activity against all 4 indicator strains contribute to protection, and 
that antibodies to multiple antigens may act synergistically, the relevance of waning titers to 2 out of 4 
antigens is unclear. 
Based on the above, Novartis agrees with the assessment of the Rapporteur that it is doubtful whether 
inclusion of additional information regarding persistence of antibodies will be of any assistance to the 
prescribers and therefore suggests not to include it in the SmPC. 
Additional note on safety data from study V72P12E2 
Upon review of the data from this study Novartis identified two adverse reactions, headache and 
arthralgia, that were reported by ≥ 10% of subjects approximately 4 years of age regardless of 
previous vaccination schedule. 
These adverse reactions are not considered a new signal for identified or potential risks that require an 
update of the Risk Management Plan for rMenB+OMV NZ because they do not impact the positive

benefit-risk profile of the vaccine, as stated in section 2.5.6 of the addendum to the Clinical Overview 
submitted in support of study V72P12E2 under Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. 
However, these reactions are currently not listed for children in the relevant age group in the SmPC of 
rMenB+OMV NZ and based on the data from study V72P12E2 Novartis considers their addition to the 
SmPC warranted. 
Novartis will follow the appropriate procedure to implement these changes to the SmPC. 
Assessment: The MAH has provided a discussion on the relevance of the waning antibody titres. The 
discussion is based on similar arguments as were provided during the approval process. In conclusion, 
the relevance of waning antibody titres is not known, and whether immunological memory is sufficient 
to protect can only be speculated on. Likewise, the vaccine composition, i.e. multiple antigens, may 
reduce the importance of sustained antibody levels to all antigens, but again the relevance is unknown. 
Therefore, a sentence should be added to section 5.1 of the SPC, stating that antibody levels to the 
OMV and fHbp antigens have waned at four years of age in children fully vaccinated with a 3+1 
vaccination schedule, although the presence of immunological memory is considered demonstrated, 
and the relevance of this is currently unknown.  
The proposed update of section 4.8 is agreed. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The commitment is considered fulfilled, by the submission of the full clinical study report, and the 
response to the question. However, a SPC change is considered necessary for full transparency of the 
data. Section 5.1 should include a statement that antibody levels to the OMV and fHbp antigens have 
waned at four years of age in children fully vaccinated with a 3+1 vaccination schedule, although the 
presence of immunological memory is considered demonstrated, and the relevance of this is currently 
unknown, and section 4.8 should be updated according to the MAH suggestion above.

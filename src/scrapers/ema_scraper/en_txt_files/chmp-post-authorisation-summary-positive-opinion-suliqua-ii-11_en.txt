On 30 January 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Suliqua. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is sanofi-aventis groupe. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the existing indication as follows:2  
“Suliqua is indicated in combination with metformin for the treatment of adults with 
insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control when this has 
not been provided by as an adjunct to diet and exercise in addition to metformin alone with 
or without or metformin combined with another oral glucose lowering medicinal product or with 
basal insulin(SGLT-2 inhibitors. (For study results with respect to effect on glycaemic 
control, and the populations studied, see section 4.4 and 5.1 for available data on the 
different combinations).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

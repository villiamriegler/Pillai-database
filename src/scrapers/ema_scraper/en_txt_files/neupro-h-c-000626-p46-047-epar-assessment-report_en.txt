1.  Introduction 
On 12 September 2023 the MAH submitted the results of the prematurely terminated paediatric study 
SP1006: fixed dose administration of the rotigotine transdermal system in adolescents, 13 to 17 years 
of age, with idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
SP1006  was  prematurely  terminated  by  UCB  due  to  unsatisfactory  enrolment.  A  total  of 
138  study  participants  were  planned  to  be  randomised  in  this  study;  however,  over  a  period  of  3.5 
years, only 23 study participants were randomised. Despite extensive and diligent outreach efforts to 
increase  enrolment,  there  appeared  to  be  low  interest  from  the  population  of  adolescents  with 
idiopathic RLS, which contributed to the insufficient enrolment..  
On 23 November 2022, UCB received a response from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about a 
Type  C  meeting  regarding  two  studies  in  adolescents  with  idiopathic  RLS  (SP1006  and  its  open-label 
extension  study,  RL0007).  In  this  response,  the  FDA  recognized  the  difficulties  of  recruiting 
participants for studies SP1006 and RL0007 and offered UCB the option to request to be released from 
the  post-marketing  requirements  for  these  studies,  along  with  a  request  for  the  MAH  to  provide  an 
updated assessment of the prevalence of RLS in adolescents.  
On  13  February  2023,  UCB  notified  the  FDA  that  both  SP1006  and  RL0007  would  be  prematurely 
terminated.  At  this  time  there  were  no  study  participants  actively  receiving  treatment  in  either  study 
(all enrolled study participants had either completed or discontinued treatment). Initially the end of the 
study was defined as Last Patient Last Visit (LPLV); however, due to premature termination, the end of 
SP1006  and  RL0007  was  rather  07  April  2023,  which  corresponds  to  the  date  when  the  Institutional 
Review  Board  approved  the  closure  of  these  studies.  In  addition,  in  June  2023,  UCB  submitted  a 
request to the FDA to be released from the post-marketing requirements for both SP1006 and RL0007, 
supported by an updated assessment of the prevalence of RLS in adolescents, as requested.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study SP1006, A remote, double-blind, Randomised, placebo-controlled study of 
rotigotine  transdermal  system  in  adolescent  subjects  with  idiopathic  restless  legs  syndrome,  and  its 
open-label extension study RL0007, are stand-alone studies. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Rotigotine, a dopamine agonist, has been formulated as a transdermal delivery system and is designed 
to continuously provide rotigotine over a 24-hour period.  
The  rotigotine  transdermal  system  has  been  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  the  signs  and 
symptoms of early-stage idiopathic Parkinson’s disease as monotherapy, and as adjunctive therapy in 
combination  with  levodopa  over  the  course  of  the  disease  through  to  late  stages  when  the  effect  of 
levodopa  wears  off  or  becomes  inconsistent  and  fluctuations  of  the  therapeutic  effect  occur.  In 
addition,  the  rotigotine  transdermal  system  is  approved  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  moderate-

to-severe idiopathic RLS in adults in the EU. In the US, the rotigotine transdermal system is approved 
for  the  treatment  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  early  and  advanced-stage  idiopathic  Parkinson’s 
disease and for the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary RLS. In Japan, the rotigotine transdermal 
system  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  Parkinson’s  disease  and  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of 
moderate-to-severe idiopathic RLS in adults.  
Overall, UCB or licensed partners hold marketing authorization for the rotigotine transdermal system in 
approximately 70 countries for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, and in approximately 40 countries 
for  the  treatment  of  RLS.  The  specific  indication  statement(s),  approved  formulation(s),  and  dosages 
for  the  rotigotine  transdermal  system  may  differ  based  on  the  country;  thus,  local  labels  should  be 
consulted for further information.  
In SP1006 study, the rotigotine transdermal patch was administered in the following doses: 1mg/24h, 
2mg/24h, and 3mg/24h.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for SP1006. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
SP1006 - A Remote, Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Study of Rotigotine 
Transdermal System in Adolescent Subjects With Idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome. 
Description 
SP1006  was  a  Phase  3,  remote,  double-blind,  randomised,  adaptive  placebo-controlled  study  of  fixed 
dose  administration  of  the  rotigotine  transdermal  system.  A  total  of  138  study  participants  were 
planned to be randomised during the study. The study was conducted in adolescents (13 to 17 years of 
age)  with  idiopathic  RLS.  Study  participants  were  randomised  to  1  of  3  treatment  groups:  rotigotine 
2mg/24h, rotigotine 3mg/24h, or placebo.  
Methods 
Study participants 
The study was conducted in adolescent (13 to17 years of age) with idiopathic RLS. 
Treatments 
Rotigotine transdermal system. 
Objective(s) 
In  SP1006,  the  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  rotigotine  against  placebo  in 
adolescent  study  participants  with  idiopathic  RLS  over  a  12-week  Maintenance  Period.  The  secondary 
objectives were to investigate the safety and tolerability of rotigotine in adolescent study participants 
with idiopathic RLS.

Pharmacokinetic variable 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) variable was plasma concentrations of rotigotine.  
Study design 
SP1006  was  a  Phase  3,  remote,  double-blind,  randomised,  adaptive  placebo-controlled  study  of  fixed 
dose  administration  of  the  rotigotine  transdermal  system.  A  total  of  138  study  participants  were 
planned to be randomised during the study. The study was conducted in adolescents, 13 to 17 years of 
age,  with  idiopathic  RLS.  Study  participants  were  randomised  to  1  of  3  treatment  groups:  rotigotine 
2mg/24h, rotigotine 3mg/24h, or placebo.  
A 
remote 
clinical 
study  model  was  utilized  and 
included 
telemedicine 
technology 
(ie,  PLATFORM)  for  interactions  between  the  investigator/study  staff  and  study  participants/legal 
representatives.  Mobile  study  personnel  visited  study  participants’/legal  representatives’  homes  to 
complete  certain  study  procedures  (e.g.,  neurological  exams,  physical  exams,  ECGs,  lab  collections, 
and vital signs).  
The  study  consisted  of  a  Screening  Period,  a  Titration  Period,  a  Maintenance  Period,  a  Taper  Period, 
and a Safety Follow-Up (SFU) Visit.  
The  Screening  Period  was  at  least  7  days  (maximum  of  28  days)  prior  to  Visit  2/Baseline  to  ensure 
homogeneous  Baseline  conditions  were  established  for  all  study  participants.  Study  participants  with 
prior intake of any dopamine agonists or taking L-dopa had to discontinue the therapy at least 7 days 
prior to Visit 2/Baseline. Discontinuation of therapy was driven by the study participant’s medical need 
and not undertaken for the purpose of making a potential study participant eligible for the study.  
The  study  began  with  a  3-week  Titration  Period.  Study  participants  received  their  first  dose  of 
investigational  medicinal  product  (IMP)  at  Visit  3/Day  1.  Study  participants  were  initiated  either  on 
placebo  or  rotigotine  1mg/24h.  The  dose  of  rotigotine  taken  by  study  participants  randomised  to 
rotigotine  was  then  up-titrated  on  a  weekly  basis  by  1mg/24h  at  a  time  to  2mg/24h  or  3mg/24h, 
depending  on  the  study  participant’s  assigned  dose  level.  Study  participants  were  allowed  to  back-
titrate  1  dose  level  during  the  Titration  Period.  Study  participants  who  did  not  tolerate  the  assigned 
dose in the first week (placebo or rotigotine 1mg/24h) were withdrawn from the study.  
The  Titration  Period  was  followed  by  a  12-week  Maintenance  Period,  during  which  study  participants 
were  to  remain  at  the  assigned  (or  back-titrated)  dose  level.  During  the  Maintenance  Period,  visits 
were scheduled every 4 weeks. Plasma samples were collected at the beginning (Visit 6) and end (Visit 
9)  of  the  Maintenance  Period,  and  the  plasma  concentration  of  unconjugated  rotigotine  was  to  be 
summarized by dose level and visit.  
At  the  EoM  Period,  study  participants  entered  a  Taper  Period  lasting  up  to  a  maximum  of  4  days, 
starting on the day after Visit 9 and consisting of a telemedicine call. The de-escalation dose(s) of IMP 
to be taken during the Taper Period were dispensed at Visit 9.  
The  visit  window  for  the  SFU  Period  was  30  days  ±5  days  relative  to  the  end  of  the  Taper  Period. 
Following  dose  de-escalation,  study  participants  were  eligible  to  participate  in  the  open-label,  long-

term  follow-up  study  (RL0007)  at  any  time  prior  to  the  SFU  Visit.  The  SFU  Visit  was  for  study 
participants not entering RL0007.  
Results 
Overall,  48  study  participants  were  screened:  25  study  participants  were  screen  failures  and 
23 study participants were randomised. The most common reason for screen failures was ineligibility. 
The most common reasons for ineligibility due to  inclusion criteria not being met or exclusion criteria 
being met were: low serum ferritin level at Visit 1/Screening (9 study participants), suicidal ideation or 
behaviour as determined  by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale at Visit 1/Screening (6 study 
participants), and/or not indicating moderate-to-severe RLS as determined by an IRLS score of ≥15 at 
Baseline (6 study participants).  
A  total  of  23  study  participants  were  included  in  the  Randomised  Set  (RS),  which  consisted  of  all 
enrolled  study  participants  (i.e.,  participants  with  a  signed  Informed  Consent/Assent  form  and  any 
demographic  data)  who  were  randomised:  8  study  participants  were  randomised  to  the  rotigotine 
2mg/24h group, 7 study  participants  were randomised to the rotigotine  3mg/24h  group, and 8 study 
participants  were  randomised  to  the  placebo  group.  All  study  participants  in  the  RS  were  included  in 
the  Safety  Set  (SS),  which  consisted  of  all  study  participants  from  the  RS  who  had  at  least  1  patch 
(rotigotine  or  placebo)  applied.  No  study  participants  received  rotigotine  1mg/24h  group  after  the 
Titration Period, and thus results are only presented for 2 rotigotine dose groups (rotigotine 2mg/24h 
and rotigotine 3mg/24h) for this study.  
A total of 21 study participants (91.3%) were included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which consisted 
of all study participants from the SS who had a valid IRLS score at Baseline paired with a valid post-
Baseline IRLS score or a valid CGI Item 1 score at Baseline paired with a valid post-Baseline CGI Item 
1  score.  One  study  participant  in  the  rotigotine  2mg/24h  group  discontinued  before  completing  any 
post
Baseline  efficacy  assessments  and  subsequently  was  not  included  in  the  FAS.  One  study 
participant  in  the  placebo  group  had  no  valid  post
‐
and subsequently was excluded from the FAS.  
Baseline  assessments  during  the  Treatment  Period 
‐
Among  the  23  study  participants  included  in  the  RS,  18  study  participants  (78.3%)  completed  the 
study,  and  5  (21.7%)  discontinued  the  study.  Two  study  participants  (8.7%)  discontinued  the  study 
during  the  Titration  Period,  and  3  (13.0%)  discontinued  the  study  during  the  Maintenance  Period. 
There were no study discontinuations during the Taper Period or the SFU Period.  
The  most  common  primary  reason  for  study  discontinuation  was  withdrawal  by  parent/guardian  and 
occurred  for  2  study  participants  (8.7%);  other  primary  reasons  for  study  discontinuation  were 
adverse event (AE), lost to follow up, and withdrawal by study participant (1 study participant [4.3%] 
each).  
Study participant demographics  
Overall, the mean age of study participants was 15.7 years (range: 13 to 17 years), and the median 
age of participants was 16.0 years. Three out of the 23 study participants were under 15 years of age. 
There were no meaningful differences in age between treatment groups.  
Fourteen out of the 23 study participants (60.9%) were female. The rotigotine 3mg/24h group had a 
higher percentage of males (71.4%) compared with the other treatment groups (25.0% each).  
Twenty  out  of  the  23  study  participants  were  White  (87.0%).  One  study  participant  (4.3%)  was  in 
each  of  the  following  racial  groups:  American  Indian/Alaskan  Native,  Black  or  African  American,  and

Other/Mixed.  All  the  study  participants  were  not  of  Hispanic  or  Latino  ethnicity,  and  there  were  no 
meaningful differences in racial group or ethnicity between treatment groups.  
The  mean  weight,  height,  and  BMI  of  study  participants  were  76.54kg,  167.14cm,  and  27.24kg/m2, 
respectively. All 3 treatment groups had 3 study participants with BMIs ≥30kg/m2.  
Baseline characteristics  
The number of years since first diagnosis of RLS ranged from -0.1 to 8.6 years. The median number of 
years since first diagnosis of RLS (range:0 to 0.05 years across treatment groups) indicates that most 
study participants had diagnosis durations of <1 year.  
Most study participants (16 of 23) reported that other family members were affected by RLS, and 14 of 
these study participants reported that at least 1 first-degree relative was affected.  
Efficacy results 
Because  of  the  study’s  premature  termination,  no  statistical  tests  of  efficacy  data  were  performed; 
however,  descriptive  summaries  of  a  subset  of  efficacy  data  were  produced.  No  imputation  rules  for 
missing data were applied.  
For  all  efficacy  measurements  (i.e.,  IRLS,  CGI  Item  1,  RLS-6,  and  RLS-QoL),  higher  scores  indicate 
worse disease.  
Because of the small number of study participants, the efficacy observations from this study should be 
interpreted with caution.  
Coprimary efficacy variables  
IRLS  
The  Baseline  mean  IRLS  sum  score  was  highest  in  the  rotigotine  2mg/24h  group  (24.6),  followed  by 
the rotigotine 3mg/24h group and placebo group (21.4 each).  
All treatment groups had a reduction in mean and median IRLS sum score (ie, disease improvement) 
from  Baseline  to  EoM;  the  rotigotine  2mg/24h  group  had  the  largest  reductions  in  mean  and  median 
IRLS sum score from Baseline to EoM:

Safety results 
Extent of exposure  
The investigational medicinal product duration was calculated including 1 additional day after the final 
patch  removal.  Overall,  the  median  IMP  duration  was  110.0  days  (range:  2  to  119  days)  and  was 
similar across treatment groups. 
Adverse Events  
Summary of all TEAEs  
Overall, 12 study participants (80.0%) in the total rotigotine group and 7 study participants (87.5%) in 
the placebo group reported TEAEs. Two study participants (13.3%) in the total rotigotine group and 1 
study  participant  (12.5%)  in  the  placebo  group  reported  severe  TEAEs.  Nine  study  participants 
(60.0%) in the total rotigotine group and 3 study participants (37.5%) in the placebo group reported 
TEAEs that were considered IMP-related by the investigator.  
One  study  participant  (14.3%)  in  the  rotigotine  3mg/24h  group  reported  a  serious  TEAE.  In  the 
placebo  group,  1  study  participant  (12.5%)  reported  a  TEAE  that  led  to  study  discontinuation,  and  1 
study  participant  (12.5%)  reported  a  TEAE  that  led  to  permanent  withdrawal  of  IMP;  both  of  these 
incidences were reported by the same study participant.  
No deaths were reported during the study.

Most common TEAEs  
In the total rotigotine group, the most commonly reported TEAEs by PT were application site erythema 
(5  study  participants  [33.3%]),  application  site  pruritus  (4  study  participants  [26.7%]),  pruritus  (3 
study  participants  [20.0%]),  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (3  study  participants  [20.0%]);  no 
other TEAEs were reported by >2 study participants.  
In  the  placebo  group,  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  were  abdominal  pain,  dizziness,  and 
nasopharyngitis  (2  study  participants  [25.0%]  each);  no  other  TEAEs  were  reported  by  >1  study 
participant.  
TEAEs by maximum intensity  
In  the  total  rotigotine  group,  2  study  participants  (13.3%)  reported  severe  TEAEs  that  were  not 
considered  IMP  related  by  the  investigator  and  were  resolved:  1  study  participant  in  the  rotigotine 
2mg/24  group  (diarrhoea)  and  1  study  participant  in  the  rotigotine  3mg/24h  group  (Type  2  diabetes 
mellitus).

In  the  placebo  group,  1  study  participant  (12.5%)  reported  a  severe  TEAE  of  vertigo  that  was 
considered IMP-related by the investigator and resolved. 
IMP-related TEAEs  
In  the  total  rotigotine  group,  9  study  participants  (60.0%)  reported  IMP-related  TEAEs.  The  most 
reported IMP-related TEAEs were application site erythema (5 study participants [33.3%]), application 
site pruritus (4 study participants [26.7%]), pruritus (3 study participants [20.0%]), and skin irritation 
(2 study participants [13.3%]); no other IMP-related TEAE was reported by >1 study participant.  
In the placebo group, 3 study participants (37.5%) reported IMP-related TEAEs; no IMP-related TEAE 
was reported by >1 study participant.  
Deaths  
No deaths were reported during the study.  
Other serious AEs  
One  study  participant  (14.3%)  in  the  rotigotine  3mg/24h  group  reported  a  serious  TEAE  of  Type  2 
diabetes  mellitus.  The  TEAE  was  of  severe  intensity,  was  not  considered  IMP  related  by  the 
investigator, and resolved. 
Discontinuation due to AEs  
No study discontinuations due to TEAEs were reported in the total rotigotine group.  
One study participant (12.5%) in the placebo group reported a TEAE leading to study discontinuation 
and permanent withdrawal of IMP. The study participant reported a TEAE of moderate insomnia, which 
was not serious and not considered IMP-related by the investigator.  
Clinical laboratory evaluation  
Overall,  there  were  no  clinically  relevant  mean  changes  from  Baseline  or  notable  shift  patterns 
observed for any of the haematology, endocrinology, or clinical chemistry parameters evaluated during 
the study for the SS. In addition, no clinically relevant changes in urinalysis parameters were observed 
for the SS.  
No study participants in the SS met the criteria for potential Hy’s Law, defined as ≥3xULN ALT or AST 
with  coexisting  ≥2xULN  total  bilirubin  in  the  absence  of  ≥2xULN  ALP, with no  alternative  explanation 
for the biochemical abnormality.  
Other observations related to safety  
Overall, there were no clinically relevant findings related to ECGs, vital signs, physical and neurological 
examinations, mMIDI data, or menstrual function and libido assessment for the SS.  
Eight  study  participants  in  the  SS  reported  suicidal  ideation  at  their  Screening  Visit.  No  study 
participants reported suicidal ideation at any post-Baseline visits.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
SP1006  was  a  Phase  3,  remote,  double-blind,  randomised,  adaptive  placebo-controlled  study  of  fixed 
dose administration of the rotigotine transdermal system. The study was conducted in adolescents (13 
to  17  years  of  age)  with  idiopathic  RLS.  Study  participants  were  randomised  to  1  of  3  treatment 
groups: rotigotine 2mg/24h, rotigotine 3mg/24h, or placebo.

A total of 138 study participants were planned to be randomised in SP1006 per the protocol; however, 
over  a  period  of  3.5  years,  only  23  study  participants  were  randomised  in  the  study  and  only  18 
completed the study. Due to unsatisfactory enrolment, SP1006 was prematurely terminated by UCB. 
A descriptive summary of a subset of efficacy data were provided. No statistical tests of efficacy data 
were performed. 
Improvements in IRLS sum score, CGI Item 1 score, and RLS-6 score were observed in the rotigotine 
2mg/24h, rotigotine 3mg/24h, and placebo groups over the 12-week Maintenance Period, with the 
largest mean differences in these efficacy parameters occurring in the rotigotine 2mg/24h group. 
The safety profile was consistent with previous studies of the rotigotine transdermal system, and no 
new or unexpected safety concerns were observed. There were no deaths, only 1 serious TEAE that 
was not related to rotigotine, and no study participants who received rotigotine discontinued from the 
study due to an AE. These safety data suggest that both rotigotine 2mg/24hr and rotigotine 3mg/24hr 
were well tolerated in adolescent study participants with idiopathic RLS.  
The safety profile of the adolescent participants who received rotigotine transdermal system treatment 
was  consistent  with  the  established  safety  profile  of  rotigotine  transdermal  system  in  adults.  No  new 
safety  concerns  were  identified  in  these  participants  and  the  results  of  the  study  do  not  impact  the 
current benefit-risk balance of rotigotine transdermal system.  
Because  of  the  small  number  of  study  participants,  the  efficacy  and  safety  results  from  this  study 
should be interpreted with caution.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Paediatric RLS is a rare disorder and may be self-limited if related to a transient comorbidity, such as 
iron  deficiency.  The  difficulties  reported  by  the  MAH  to  enrol  study  participants  in  this  study  are 
understood.  
The safety profile of the adolescent participants who received rotigotine transdermal system treatment 
was  consistent  with  the  established  safety  profile  of  rotigotine  transdermal  system  in  adults.  No  new 
safety concerns were identified in this study. These safety data suggest that both rotigotine 2mg/24hr 
and  rotigotine  3mg/24hr  were  well  tolerated  in  the  adolescent  study  participants  with  idiopathic  RLS. 
However,  due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects,  the  findings  of  this  study  should  be  interpreted  with 
caution.  
The  results  of  SP1006  are  being  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC) 
No  1901/2006  (The  Paediatric  Regulation).  No  changes  to  the  approved  EU  Product  Information  (PI) 
for NEUPRO are being proposed based on SP1006 results.

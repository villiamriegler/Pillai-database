are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

France requested on 13 March 2019 the opinion of 
the European Medicines Agency to assess the need 
to take action at EU level regarding the detection of 
DPD deficient patients (especially through 
genotyping and/or phenotyping) in patients treated 
with fluorouracil and related substances 
(capecitabine, tegafur and flucytosine). The Agency 
was requested to assess the impact thereof on the 
benefit-risk balance of fluorouracil and related 
substances containing products and to give its 
opinion on whether the marketing authorisation of 
these products should be maintained, varied, 
suspended or revoked.

DPYD*2A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3 
variant) have been shown to have increased risk of severe 
toxicity when treated with capecitabine.  
The frequency of the heterozygous DPYD*2A genotype in 
the DYPD gene in Caucasian patients is around 1%, 1.1% 
for c.2846A>T, 2.6-6.3% for c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants 
and 0.07 to 0.1% for c.1679T>G Genotyping for these 
alleles is recommended to identify patients at increased risk 
for severe toxicity. Data on the frequency of these DPYD 
variants in other populations than Caucasian is limited. It 
cannot be excluded that other rare variants may also be 
associated with an increased risk of severe toxicity. 
For patients with partial DPD deficiency (such as those with 
heterozygous mutations in the DPYD gene) and where the 
benefits of Xeloda are considered to outweigh the risks 
(taking into account the suitability of an alternative non-
fluoropyrimidine chemotherapeutic regimen), these 
patients must be treated with extreme caution and frequent 
monitoring with dose adjusment according to toxicity. A 
reduction of the starting dose in these patients may be 
considered to avoid serious toxicity. There is insufficient 
data to recommend a specific dose in patients with partial 
DPD activity as measured by specific test.  It has been

Hand-foot syndrome, also known as hand-foot skin reaction 
or palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia or chemotherapy 
induced acral erythema is a known adverse drug reaction of 
Xeloda treatment. There is some evidence that 
dexpanthenol is effective for hand-foot syndrome 
prophylaxis in patients treated with Xeloda. 
Folinic acid, and folic acid due to the similarity between the 
two, have an effect on the pharmacodynamics of 
capecitabine and the toxicity of capecitabine may be 
enhanced by folinic/folic acid. The enhanced toxicity may 
be relevant when switching from 5-FU/LV to a capecitabine 
regimen. This may also be relevant with folic acid 
supplementation for folate deficiency. 
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC with regard to 
prophylactic treatment of hand-foot syndrome, as 
recommended in conclusion to the assessment of the 
latest PSUR 10 (PSU 027). In addition, section 4.5 of 
the SmPC is updated with regard to interaction with 
folinic/folic acid upon switching from 5 fluorouracil to

failure secondary to dehydration developing in the course

association between acute renal failure secondary to 
dehydration and capecitabine use was likely. Dehydration 
developing during Xeloda treatment may cause acute renal 
failure, especially in patients with pre-existing 
compromised renal function or when capecitabine is given 
concomitantly with known nephrotoxic drugs. Acute renal

new additional data submitted by the MAH 
(capecitabine+irinotecan) regimens is similar to that of 
FOLFIRI (5 fluorouracil+irinotecan) regimens and modified 
XELIRI regimens (employing lower doses of capecitabine 
and irinotecan) are not associated with loss of efficacy. 
Although studies which have included XELIRI +/- 
bevacizumab have shown variable results with respect to 
efficacy and toxicity, tolerance to treatment may be 
improved by modifying (dose reduction) the capecitabine 
and irinotecan doses used. Although the regimen using 
capecitabine 1000mg/m2 bid + irinotecan 250mg/m2 is the 
most frequently used one, the optimal dose combination 
has not been established. For combination with irinotecan, 
the recommended starting dose of Xeloda is 800 mg/m2 
when administered twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-
day rest period combined with irinotecan 200 mg/m2 on 
day 1. 
In addition, severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been 
reported as very rare adverse reactions during Xeloda

following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Patients with known DPD deficiency should not be treated 
with capecitabine (Xeloda), a pro-drug of 5-FU. Careful 
monitoring during the first cycle of treatment is 
recommended for all patients. In patients with 
unrecognised DPD deficiency treated with Xeloda, life-
threatening toxicities manifesting as acute overdose may 
occur. In the event of grade 2-4 acute toxicity, treatment 
must be discontinued immediately until toxicity resolves 
and permanent discontinuation should be considered. 
Other than warfarin, no formal drug-drug interaction 
studies between capecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates 
have been conducted. Care should be exercised when 
capecitabine is co-administered with 2C9 substrates (e.g., 
phenytoin). 
Finally, radiation recall syndrome has uncommonly been 
reported with capecitabine in the scientific literature.

insights into phenomena observed. The information 
relevant for the prescriber deriving from this analysis are 
contained in the revised SPC, section 4.5. 
The concerns also ultimately confirmed in the multi-
factorial Cox regression analysis (submitted with the 
responses), is that starting dose is seemingly more relevant 
than e.g. cumulative dose for the outcome of the patient. 
This is, however, the result of a meta-analysis. Concerning 
dose recommendations/recommendations for dose 
adjustments, these are derived from the results of single 
trials in a pre-specified population (i.e., on the "history" of 
the currently licensed posology as of section 4.2).

Xeloda was assessed for the adjuvant  indication in colon 
cancer stage III is now reconfirmed by the data after 
patients had been followed up  for  5 years as part of the 
commitments of the Marketing Authorisation Holder. In 
addition, these new data confirm that 3 year DFS in colon 
cancer stage III treated with surgery and adjuvant 
chemotherapy predicts 5 year OS as already postulated in 
several preceding publications. 
Xeloda was shown to be superior to bolus 5-FU/LV in a pre-
planned multivariate Cox analysis therefore, the data for 
disease free survival (HR = 0.849 [95% CI: 0.739 - 0.976],

SmPC,  Annex 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and 
II,  Labelling 
efficacy, including all variations introduced since the 
and PL 
marketing authorisation was granted, the CHMP considered 
that the risk-benefit balance of Raloxifene Teva for the 
treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal women remains favourable and therefore 
recommends the renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
The CHMP recommended that the renewal be granted with 
unlimited validity.

2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) proposes to add the following new indication:  
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 7/156 
 
 
 
 
 
JEMPERLI is indicated in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) primary advanced 
or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC) and who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Endometrial cancer (EC) accounted for 4.5% of all new cancer cases in women diagnosed in 2020, being 
the second most common gynecological cancer after cervical cancer and the sixth most common type of 
malignancy diagnosed in women worldwide1. In Europe, there were a total of 130,051 new cases of EC 
and 29,963 deaths due to EC in 2020. 
EC is predominantly a disease of post-menopausal women and most common in women over 50 years of 
age. The incidence of EC increases with age such that in Europe in 2020 the age-standardized incidence 
rate (ASIR) of EC was 0.26 per 100,000 among women aged between 15 and 19 years and 84.3 per 
100,000 among women aged at least 60 years. EC is more prevalent in high/intermediate developed 
countries. 
Risk factors include age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, nulliparity, late menopause, unopposed oestrogen 
intake or oestrogen-producing tumours, a history of breast cancer and the use of tamoxifen. 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Among EC, there are two histologic categories: type I tumours, which include tumours of endometrioid 
histology that are grade 1 or 2, comprise approximately 80% of EC and have a favorable prognosis, and 
type II tumours, that account for 10-20% of EC and include grade 3 endometrioid tumours as well as 
tumours of nonendometrioid histology (serous, clear cell, mucinous, squamous, transitional cell, 
mesonephric, and undifferentiated).  
The Cancer Genome Atlas has identified 4 molecular subgroups that more accurately reflect the 
underlying tumour. These include POLE-mut/ultramutated, MSI-H, copy number low, and copy number 
high. These subgroups have been replicated by using surrogate markers to allow increased reproducibility 
between laboratories, and include p53-abn, POLE-mut, dMMR and no specific molecular profile. 
Approximately 25% to 30% of ECs are dMMR/MSI-H and have biological features that result in increased 
antitumour activity with an anti- PD-1 antibody therapy2. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The majority of patients with EC are diagnosed in early stages (Stage I or II) and receive surgery with 
curative intent; however, approximately 20% of patients are diagnosed with high-risk primary advanced 
or metastatic disease (Stage III or IV) for which a surgical cure is not possible. The prognosis for patients 
with advanced or recurrent EC depends upon site and extent of the recurrence, tumour size, whether the 
patient had received prior radiotherapy, the relapse-free interval, and histology. Approximately 40% of 
ECs are diagnosed as locally advanced tumours, and most recurrences occur within 3 years of primary 
treatment. 
Survival rates vary across cancer stage and histologic subtype. Patients with early-stage disease have 
excellent outcomes with 5-year OS >95% for patients with stage I tumours. However, outcomes in

women with primary advanced (Stage III or IV) or recurrent EC remain poor with 5-year OS rates of 20% 
to 25%.3 
Management 
For patients with advanced or recurrent disease of any histological subtype, surgery is recommended only 
when optimal cytoreduction can be achieved. Radiotherapy can be used as a primary treatment in 
patients with unresectable disease, or where there are medical contraindications to surgery. Patients with 
primary advanced Stage III or IV EC with extrauterine disease are at increased risk of recurrence and 
there is a need for adjuvant therapy. The recommended treatment options include systemic 
chemotherapy and/or external beam radiotherapy with or without brachytherapy. For patients with 
recurrent tumours, treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy. For relapsed 
disease not amenable to surgery and/or RT, the standard approach is chemotherapy or hormonal 
therapy.4  
Carboplatin and paclitaxel is considered as the standard of care (SOC) in first line setting to treat the 
advanced or metastatic EC based on its similar efficacy and less toxicity compared to cisplatin, 
doxorubicin and paclitaxel.5 Hormone therapy is indicated for patients with advanced or recurrent EC and 
endometrioid histology and has demonstrated a favourable toxicity profile. Patients with Grade 1 to 2 
endometrioid tumours and those with hormone receptor-positive disease are most likely to experience 
clinical benefit from hormone therapy.6 
At the present time, standard of care for all patients with primary advanced or recurrent EC is the same, 
and patients who are candidates for systemic therapy are recommended to receive carboplatin-paclitaxel 
regardless of MMR/MSI status. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) have been investigated as potential 
options in EC. Thus far, dostarlimab and pembrolizumab have been approved in the EU as monotherapy 
in second-line dMMR or dMMR/MSI-H EC. Pembrolizumab is also approved in combination with lenvatinib 
for the treatment of patients who have failed a previous platinum-based chemotherapy, and who are not 
candidates for curative surgery or RT.7 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Dostarlimab is an anti-PD-1 immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), resulting in inhibition of binding to programmed cell death 1 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). 
On 21 April 2021, dostarlimab (JEMPERLI®) was granted conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) by 
the European Commission for the following indication: 
JEMPERLI is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair deficient 
(dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer (EC) that has 
progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen.

The approved treatment regimen (also referred to as RTD) is dostarlimab at 500 mg Q3W for the first 4 
cycles, followed by dostarlimab at 1000 mg Q6W for all subsequent cycles. 
In the context of the present application, the final agreed indication is: 
JEMPERLI is indicated in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for the treatment of adult patients 
with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) primary advanced or 
recurrent endometrial cancer (EC) and who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
The recommended dose is 500 mg dostarlimab every 3 weeks in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel every 3 weeks for 6 cycles followed by 1000 mg dostarlimab as monotherapy every 6 weeks for 
all cycles thereafter. 
The dosage regimen in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is presented below: 
500 mg once every 3 weeks 
in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxela

double-blind study RUBY, comparing the efficacy and safety of 
dostarlimab in combination with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in 
patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer who have not 
received prior systemic anticancer therapy for recurrent or advanced 
disease.  
The current application concerns a Type II variation to enable the fulfilment of the remaining SOB of the 
Jemperli CMA (SOB-clin-002). 
Dostarlimab is being investigated as a single agent or as combination therapy in 15 ongoing global clinical 
studies in various tumour types including EC, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 
other solid tumours. 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 28 February 2019 (EMEA/H/SA/3585/2/2018/II). 
The Scientific advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier. Scientific advice was received on the key 
elements of the proposed pivotal Phase 3 study (RUBY) design to support registration of dostarlimab in 
combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in 1L EC and the use of the study to support conversion to full 
marketing authorization of the planned initial CMA application. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
All studies were conducted with the approval of Ethics Committees or Institutional Review Boards. 
Informed consent was obtained for all participants, and the studies were performed in accordance with 
the version of the Declaration of Helsinki that applied at the time the studies were conducted. Where 
required, regulatory approval was obtained from the relevant health authority. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The provided ERA consists of a justification for not performing any ERA studies due to the nature of the 
product being a monoclonal antibody unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Monoclonal 
antibodies are broken down by proteolysis and the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, dostarlimab is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The active substances, dostarlimab, is a protein and therefore no environmental risk assessment studies 
have been submitted, in line with the ERA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2)

September 2022 including both PK and ADA samples. There were 4702 PK samples of which 2326 were to 
be analysed. 2376 Placebo and duplicate samples were not analysed. Two samples collected in error were 
discarded per sponsors’ request on 20 Sep 2022. All Samples were received in good condition per study 
protocol specified. All samples were received frozen, packaged on dry ice, and were stored in a -80°C 
freezer upon receipt.  
Calibration standards were prepared at 8 different concentrations: 32.0, 71.3, 107, 161, 241, 362, 651 
and 814 ng/mL. Two accessory standards were included (21.3 and 1020 ng/mL). For every run, one 
calibration standard per concentration level was used.  
Each run included 3 QCs (81.3, 254 and 611 ng/mL) per duplicate. The LQC, MQC and HQC were 
distributed throughout the calibration range (approximately 3 times the LLOQ, 30% and 75% of the 
calibration range, respectively).  
180 study samples (incurred samples) were selected for reanalysis to evaluate the overall performance of 
the bioanalytical assay. 73.6 % of re-assayed samples met the acceptance criteria (±30% of the original

Report KB-0253-RI-AS-RPT-02: Analysis of Anti-Dostarlimab Antibodies in Human Serum 
The bioanalytical evaluation of anti-dostarlimab antibodies in human serum samples was carried out by 
Charles River Laboratories, Inc. using a validated qualitative indirect electrochemiluminescent (ELC) 
method. The bioanalytical phase started on 14 April 2021 and the completion date was 12 October 2022.  
The ECL method was utilized to detect and confirm anti-dostarlimab antibodies in human serum and 
determine their titer. Samples mixed with biotinylated drug and sulfo-tagged drug were added to a 
streptavidin plate. After washing, the plate was stopped with read buffer, and the ECL response was read. 
Analysis was conducted in 3 stages: a positive initial screening analysis, followed by a confirmatory 
analysis, and then a titer analysis.  
A total of 9379 samples from RUBY study were received in 68 shipments between February 2021 and 
September 2022. There were 4677 ADA samples and 4702 PK samples. Two samples (one PK and one 
ADA) were discarded per sponsor’s request. All samples were received frozen in good condition, were 
packaged on dry ice, and were stored in a -80°C freezer upon receipt.  
Of the 4677 ADA samples received, 1273 samples were reported and 3404 samples were not tested and 
reported for the following reasons: placebo samples (2349), duplicate samples (5), samples with 
timepoints not requiring analysis (1042), affected by ambient temperature (6), discarded per sponsors 
request (1), insufficient volume (1). 
Positive control (PC) samples were prepared by spiking blank human serum with appropriate amounts of 
polyclonal antibody (Low PC of 3.45 ng/mL and 40.0 ng/mL, Medium PC of 500 ng/mL and High PC of 
20,000 ng/mL). Negative Control (NC) samples were prepared using pooled human serum diluted to the 
MRD in assay buffer.  
Five replicates of the NC sample (10 wells) were included in each microtiter plate. The mean ECL value of 
the NC replicate samples was used to calculate the plate specific cutpoint (PSCP). Two replicates of each 
PC sample were run, each in duplicate wells. For a run to be considered acceptable, the positive and 
negative controls must meet the pre-defined acceptance criteria.  
Samples were analysed in duplicate in the screening assay and the ECL value was compared to the PSCP. 
Samples with values above the relevant cut point were reported as screen positive. Any sample with an 
ECL value greater than the PSCP in the screening assay were analysed in the confirmatory assay with 
TSR-042 to confirm the sample status as positive or negative for anti TSR-042 antibodies. Any sample 
confirmed positive with TSR-042 were analysed in the titer assay based on procedures and acceptance 
criteria detailed in the Laboratory Method (Appendix 2). The SCF [screening cut point factor (1.09)], TCF 
[titer cut point factor (1.26)], and CCP [confirmatory cut point (21.0%)] previously determined in study 
KB-0240-RI-AV were utilized for this study (Table 3).

Report 964-R11538: Detection of Neutralizing Anti-Dostarlimab Antibodies in Human Serum 
The neutralizing activity of anti-dostarlimab antibodies in human serum samples was evaluated by 
Frontage Laboratories, Inc. using a validated Electrochemiluminescent Immunoassay on the Meso Scale 
Discovery (MSD®) platform. The analysis conducted from 23 February 2022 to 01 November 2022.  
A total of 4584 samples were received at Frontage Laboratories frozen on dry ice between 19 March 2021 
and 13 September 2022. Frontage laboratories was informed by the Sponsor that a total of 39 samples, 
which were shown to be ADA-positive for dostarlimab by Charles River laboratories using its confirmatory 
assay, were up for further analysis to determine the presence of neutralizing antibodies.  
The mean ECL values must have a %CV ≤ 20%. Samples with mean ECL values greater than or equal to 
the plate specific cut point were classified as positive while samples with mean ECL values less than the 
plate specific cut point were classified as negative. 39 samples had been analysed, and per sponsor’s 
request, only 37 samples were reported. One sample  was not reported due to the sample being received 
at central lab at ambient condition, another sample was not reported due to pending ADA titer results. Of 
the 37 samples screened, 19 samples resulted in positive results. The screening cut point factor of 1.18 
had been determined during the validation. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The data provided in the current submission aims to support the dose recommendation for dostarlimab 
(500 mg Q3W for the first 6 cycles followed by 1000 mg Q6W for all subsequent cycles) in combination 
with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with dMMR/MSI-H primary advanced or recurrent EC and who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. 
To date, clinical pharmacology data are available from the first clinical study with dostarlimab, GARNET 
Parts 1, 2A, and 2B, and the ongoing Phase 3 study, RUBY Part 1 (Table 4). Both studies are 
interventional trials. Dostarlimab PK has not been evaluated in healthy volunteers.

Population PK modelling 
A structural population PK model for dostarlimab based on data from the GARNET study as of the 01 
March 2020 data cutoff date was described in the previous submission (see Jemperli EPAR). 
Since then, PK data were collected from an additional 92 participants in this study (an approximately 18% 
increase in the number of participants with at least 1 PK sample) between 01 March 2020 and 01 
November 2021. These additional data, as well as data available from the RUBY study as of 08 August 
2022 (233 participants), are included in the updated population PK analysis described below. 
Objectives 
The overall aims were to characterize the PK and to explore the exposure-response relationships for 
dostarlimab. 
This was achieved through the following objectives: 
• To do an external validation of current structural PopPK model and refine if necessary. Identify the 
covariates of clinical interest; 
• To evaluate the exposure-response relationship between dostarlimab, PFS and DOR (as data permits); 
• To evaluate the exposure-response relationship between dostarlimab and occurrence of relevant AEs.

Prior Knowledge 
Dostarlimab exhibits typical PK behavior as other mAb's in the PD-1 class. A PopPK model for dostarlimab 
has been developed based on 4010-01-001 data (GARNET, data cut March 1 2020). This PopPK model 
was a 2-compartment model with linear, time-dependent elimination, with WT as a covariate on CL, 
volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc) and volume of distribution of peripheral 
compartment (Vp) (WT on intercompartment clearance to peripheral compartment (Q) was not supported 
and resulted in a model with a worse fit) with a proportional residual error model.

The parameter estimates of the 4010-01-001 (GARNET) model are given in Table 11. 
Table 11: Parameter Estimates of the 4010-01-001 (GARNET) PopPK Model 
Modelling Assumptions 
The study 4010-03-001 (RUBY) data will be used for external validation of the developed PopPK model. 
Initially, the predictive performance of the model will be evaluated graphically. Predicted observations will 
be obtained by fixing the parameters in the structural and variance models to the parameter estimates in 
the final models using posthoc Bayesian forecasting with NONMEM 7.4. The $ESTIMATION command will 
be set as MAXEVAL=0. The population prediction (PRED) and individual prediction (IPRED) will be 
compared with the corresponding observed concentrations, and conditional weighted residual (CWRES) vs 
time and PRED will be evaluated. Parameter (ETA) distribution will also be compared. In addition, 
simulation based evaluation (VPC) will be performed where the median and 95% prediction interval of the 
observed data is compared to model based simulations. 
Prior to the covariate search estimation of the model will be performed with the combined 4010-01-001 
(GARNET) and 4010-03-001 (RUBY) data. 
Results 
Patients with at least 2 dostarlimab PK observations were included in the analysis. In total, 2057 PK 
observations from 233 patients were included in the external validation of the RUBY data. From these 
data, 44 observations were removed due to high CWRES (>5) or based on visual inspection, during the 
model development. 
A total of 8032 PK observations from 869 patients from both study 4010-01-001 (GARNET) and study 
4010-03-001 (RUBY) studies were included in the model development after excluding 1060 (13.2%)

observations, of which 842 observations were BQL observations collected prior to first dose. Additionally, 
75 observations were removed due to high CWRES (>5) or based on visual inspection throughout the 
modelling, resulting in a total of 7957 PK observations from 868 patients (n=232 from study 4010-03-
001) in the final model.

External Validation 
Initially, the current dostarlimab PopPK model (GARNET, data cut March 1 2020) was externally validated 
against the study 4010-03-001 (RUBY) PK data. 
There were no major trends identified in the VPC (Figure 5) or GOF (Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8) 
plots. 
Some observations were associated with large CWRES and were considered for omission during structural 
model update.

WT was included as a covariate in the structural model. The effect of WT was modeled based on the 
principles of allometry, and included as a covariate for CL, Vc and Vp, (standardized to a 70-kg person, 
arbitrary number).  
Additional covariates, listed in Table 14, were tested using the SCM procedure.

Absorption 
Based on population PK model predictions, the Cycle 1 geometric mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC(0-tau) of 
dostarlimab are 144 µg/mL (18.1%) and 31 800 µg • h/mL (18.9%), respectively, after the first dose of 
500 mg, and 248 µg/mL (24.2%) and 73100 µg • h/mL (31.1%), respectively, after multiple dosing of 
500 mg Q3W at steady state. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution of dostarlimab at steady state is approximately 5.8 L (CV % of 14.9 %). 
Elimination 
The mean clearance is 0.007 L/h (CV % of 30.2 %) at steady state. The t1/2 at steady state is 23.2 days 
(CV % of 20.8 %). 
Dostarlimab clearance was estimated to be 7.8% lower when dostarlimab was given in combination with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
Special populations 
Dostarlimab PK was similar between participants with normal renal function and those with mild or 
moderate renal impairment (Table 23). Similarly, mild hepatic impairment did not appear to cause a 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 35/156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant change in the PK of dostarlimab when compared to participants with normal hepatic function 
(Table 24). 
Table 23 Summary of predicted exposure at first dose and steady state by renal impairment 
(geometric means) 
Table 24 Summary of predicted exposure at first dose and steady state by hepatic impairment 
(geometric means) 
The tables with summary of predicted exposures are based on patients receiving the dose of 500 mg Q3W 
for 4 cycles (Garnet, part 2 B subjects only) or 500 mg Q3W 6 cycles (Ruby), followed by 1000 mg Q6W.  
The number of all patients in RUBY and Garnet study who were treated with dostarlimab alone or in 
combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin with PK data available at time of analysis, and were included 
in the PopPK analysis by study, were as follows: 
- Based on the estimated creatinine clearance, normal: n= 305; mild: n = 397; moderate: n = 164. 
- Based on hepatic dysfunction by total bilirubin and AST, normal: n = 772; mild: n = 92. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
During the population PK analysis, concomitant chemotherapy, immune suppressors, immune 
stimulators, and the systemic use of corticosteroids were planned to be evaluated as covariates. 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 36/156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Participants treated with dostarlimab in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel were estimated to have 
7.79% lower CL as compared to when treated with dostarlimab monotherapy (see section 2.3.3).  
2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
The analysis included subjects in the dostarlimab plus SOC arm. 
Efficacy Variables 
The main focus for the ER of efficacy was the primary efficacy endpoint PFS, as assessed by the 
investigator per RECIST v.1.1. 
DOR was evaluated as the key secondary efficacy endpoint and was defined as the time from first 
documentation of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the time of first documentation of 
progressive disease evaluated (using RECIST v1.1), or death due to any cause for the patients with 
objective response. OS was only explored using exploratory plots, and no formal analysis was performed 
as data was deemed immature (33% maturity in ITT population). 
A summary of covariates in the ER dataset is shown in Table 25. 
Table 23: Summary of Covariates for Dostarlimab Treated Patients 
Two hundred twenty-nine patients had negative ADA status, the remaining 3 patients were missing ADA 
information hence ADA was not included as a covariate in the analysis. The majority of patients were 
missing information on neutralizing antibody status (ADNAS) status (84% missing) and PD-L1 expression 
(44% missing) hence these covariates were not included in the analysis. All dostarlimab treated patients 
in the tumour diagnosis category dMMR/MSI-H were dMMR. Hence dMMR was not included as a separate 
covariate in the analysis.

Time-to-event Modelling Approach 
For time to event (TTE) data (PFS and DOR), Kaplan-Meier plots stratified by quartiles of exposure were 
constructed to guide model development. Kaplan-Meier plots stratified by quartiles of exposure were 
constructed for visual exploration of exposure-OS relationship (no formal model analysis was performed 
as data was deemed immature with 33% maturity in ITT population). 
The primary efficacy parameter PFS and key secondary efficacy parameter DOR, were assessed using Cox 
proportional hazard models with exposure as the independent predictor.  
As a first step, a univariate analysis with exposure as the independent predictor was performed. 
Subsequently, covariates were explored via a full covariate model approach, i.e. a multivariate analysis 
with all covariates included in the model at once. 
•  Progression Free Survival 
A total of 232 PFS observations from 232 subjects with quantified dostarlimab concentrations in the 
dostarlimab arm of study 4010-03-001 were used for PFS evaluation. A summary of the exposure metrics 
for the patients included in the exposure-response analysis of PFS are shown in Table 26.

Disease status in EC, prior external pelvic radiotherapy, baseline ECOG performance and histology

appear to have a significantly longer PFS compared to European patients (Figure 18). However, the 
samples size in Europe (n=68) is smaller than North America. 
A large difference in PFS was observed between dMMR/MSI-H and MMRp/MSS patients (Figure 17).

Figure 17: PFS vs. Time Stratified by Tumour Diagnosis 
PFS appeared to be independent of AUC and Cmin. An apparent relationship where higher exposures 
result in lower efficacy was seen for Cmax in MMRp/MSS patients. However, the 95%CI overlap to great 
extent. 
Since the hazards for tumour diagnosis were non-proportional, Cox (proportional hazards) regression 
stratified by tumour diagnosis was performed for the three exposure metrics (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) with 
the additional covariates disease status in EC, prior external pelvic radiotherapy, baseline ECOG 
performance, histology and geographic location. None of the tested exposure metrics had a statistically 
significant relationship with PFS (α = 0,05) with p-values of 0.90, 0.28 and 0.40 for AUC, Cmax and 
Cmin, respectively. The hazard ratios of the tested covariates can be seen in Figure 18 and Table 27. The 
95% CI of geographic location Eastern Europe does not include 1 when tested with the exposure metrics 
AUC and Cmin while the other tested covariates include 1. The 95% CI for geographic location, Eastern 
Europe, were 1.008-3.91, 1.052-4.105 for AUC and Cmin, respectively.

Figure 21: DOR vs. Time Stratified by Cmin Exposure Quartiles 
Disease status in EC, prior external pelvic radiotherapy, baseline ECOG performance and histology 
showed no apparent relationship with DOR probability (Figure 23 - Figure 24). Patients in North America 
and Western Europe appear to have higher probability of DOR compared to Eastern European patients. A 
large difference in DOR was observed between dMMR/MSI-H and MMRp/MSS patients (Figure 22). DOR 
appeared to be independent of AUC, Cmax and Cmin in these patient groups.

Figure 22: DOR vs. Time Stratified by Tumour Diagnosis 
The hazards for DOR for the different covariates were proportional. Hence Cox (proportional hazards) 
regression was performed without stratification for the three exposure metrics (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) 
with the additional covariates disease status in EC, prior external pelvic radiotherapy, baseline ECOG 
performance, histology and geographic location. None of the tested exposure metrics had a statistically 
significant relationship with DOR (α = 0.05) with p-values of 0.69, 0.45 and 0.32 for AUC, Cmax and 
Cmin, respectively. The hazard ratios of the tested covariates can be seen in Figure 23 and Table 29. The 
95% CI of geographic location, Eastern Europe, does not include 1 when tested with the exposure metrics 
AUC, Cmax and Cmin. The 95% CI for geographic location, Eastern Europe, were 1.187-5.162, 1.125-
4.822, 1.251-5.466 for AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively. The 95% CI of tumour diagnosis does not 
include 1 when tested with the exposure metrics AUC, Cmax and Cmin. The 95% CI for tumour diagnosis, 
DIAGMMRp/MSS, were 1.375-4.784, 1.383-4.844, 1.37-4.748 for AUC, Cmax and Cmin, respectively. 
While the 95% CI for the other tested covariates include 1.

•  Overall survival 
OS was only explored using exploratory plots, and no formal analysis was performed as data was deemed 
immature (33% maturity in ITT population). Kaplan-Meier plots stratified by quartiles of exposure show a 
high degree of overlap. 
Exposure-safety analysis 
Patients from both arm 1 (SoC + dostarlimab) and arm 2 (SoC + Placebo) were included in the AE 
analysis. 
Safety Variables 
Safety variables were analyzed for all patients participating in Study 4010-03-001. The analysis included 
safety variables that were the top five occurring drug related AEs as assessed by investigators: arthralgia, 
diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, and rash. A summary of the occurrence of these events is shown in Table 30. 
A summary of covariates for the placebo arm is shown in Table 31. Only two of the placebo patients in 
the tumour diagnosis category dMMR/MSI-H were not dMMR. Hence dMMR was not included as a separate 
covariate in the analysis.

of-care chemotherapy; 
o  Cycle 7 and beyond, which gives a comparison of dostarlimab versus placebo; and 
o  All cycles, which takes all above components into account. 
Model Development 
Logistic regression was used to describe the relationships between the occurrence of each AE type and 
the available exposure metrics. The probability of AE of interest was modelled as a function of exposure. 
As for efficacy, a univariate analysis with exposure as the independent predictor was performed in a first 
step. 
Subsequently, covariates were explored via a full covariate model approach, i.e. a multivariate analysis 
with all covariates included in the model at once. 
Cycle 1 exposure (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) were used to represent an early exposure given it is expected 
that the first AE occur early rather than late following dostarlimab administration. This was valid for the 3 
different periods that were analyzed. 
Results 
A summary of the exposure metrics for the patients included in the exposure-response analysis of safety 
are shown in Table 32. 
Table 30: Summary of Predicted Cycle 1 Cmin, Cmax, and AUC for Dostarlimab Treated Patients 
in the Safety Analysis 
Univariate Analysis 
Binary data for the five most prevalent drug related AEs as assessed by investigators (arthralgia, 
diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and rash) from 478 patients (232 in the dostarlimab arm, 246 in the placebo 
arm) of study 4010-03-001 were analyzed using univariate logistic regression. The explanatory variables 
were AUC, Cmax and Cmin during the first 3 weeks after the first dose (i.e 21 days). The analysis was 
divided into three different time periods, cycle 1-6, cycle 7 and beyond and all cycles. The analysis was 
also performed for the dostarlimab treated subjects alone. 
When all patients were included, significant ER relationships for rash was seen for all exposure metrics 
(AUC, Cmax and Cmin) in all periods. However, when placebo subjects were excluded the ER 
relationships were no longer significant. No exposure response relationships were detected for arthralgia 
when all patients were included. However, excluding the placebo arm gives significant exposure response 
relationships for AUC and Cmin in the period cycle 7 and beyond. No other significant relationships were 
seen for any of the other AEs in any of the tested time periods.

Multivariate logistic regression was performed for the AEs and time periods that showed significant 
univariate ER relationships. In addition to the exposure metrics AUC, Cmax and Cmin the covariates 
disease status in EC, prior external pelvic radiotherapy, baseline ECOG performance, histology and 
geographic location were investigated. The odds ratios of the tested covariates for arthralgia in the period 
cycle 7 and beyond for dostarlimab treated patients can be seen in Figure 28. No significant relationships 
other than AUC and Cmin were found.

the probability of arthralgia by 14.2 and 15.5 % for AUC and Cmin respectively. The probability increase 
for Rash was between 5.2 and 10 % depending on exposure metric and time period.

Dostarlimab immunogenicity was studied in participants with primary advanced or recurrent EC enrolled 
in the GARNET and RUBY studies. The immunogenicity results presented here are from the 01 March 
2020 data cutoff for the GARNET study and the 08 August 2022 data cutoff for the RUBY study. 
Study 213346 (GARNET) 
In the GARNET study data, 418 of 549 overall enrolled participants were evaluable for treatment-
emergent ADAs. Of these, 384 participants were dosed in Part 2B with dostarlimab monotherapy at the 
recommended therapeutic dose regimen, contributed at least 1 evaluable predose immunogenicity pair, 
and were included in the PK immunogenicity analysis. The incidence of treatment-emergent positive ADA 
samples was low and comparable to that of other anti-PD-1 antibodies. The overall incidence of 
treatment-emergent ADAs was 2.1%, with 1.0% being NAb positive. The development of ADAs was not 
found to have a significant effect on dostarlimab PK, and ADA/Nab status did not affect clinical efficacy or 
safety. The overall immunogenicity risk for dostarlimab was determined to be low (see Jemperli EPAR). 
Study 213361 (RUBY) 
Overall, none of the 225 participants in the ADA Analysis Set had treatment-induced or treatment-
boosted ADAs, for an overall incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs of 0.0%. 
Thirty-four participants (15.1%) had treatment-unaffected ADAs (i.e., pre-existing reactive antibodies to 
dostarlimab at baseline with no meaningful increase in titer postdose). One hundred eighty-five 
participants (82.2%) were classified as ADA-negative, and 6 participants (2.7%) were classified as 
inconclusive with respect to treatment-emergent ADAs. 
Seventeen of the 34 participants (50.0%) who were categorized as having treatment-unaffected ADAs, 
were positive for NAb at any time during the study; these participants were all NAb-positive at baseline, 
with 1 participant also NAb-positive at Cycle 2. None of the participants who were classified as 
inconclusive had positive Nab results during the study. 
Observed serum dostarlimab concentrations were similar in participants with ADA-positive-samples at 
baseline (treatment-unaffected ADA) and those who were negative for ADAs at all time points indicating 
no impact of pre-existing ADAs on the PK of dostarlimab. Based on updated population PK analysis, the 
development of ADAs was also not found to have a significant effect on dostarlimab CL. 
The efficacy and safety results were similar between participants with treatment-unaffected ADA and 
participants who tested negative at all time points. Furthermore, at this point in time, there is no 
evidence of a clinically meaningful impact of pre-existing ADAs or NAbs on any safety or efficacy 
measures.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology update includes previously submitted pharmacokinetic data from the GARNET 
study (cutoff date 1st of November 2021) and new data from the RUBY study (cutoff date 8th of August 
2022), an update of the previous population PK analysis, an exposure-response analysis and an 
immunogenicity evaluation update. 
Dostarlimab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for the treatment of adult patients with 
dMMR/MSI-H primary advanced or recurrent EC and who are candidates for systemic therapy is being 
evaluated in the ongoing pivotal phase 3 study 213361 (RUBY). 
During the procedure, the MAH confirmed that the percentage of QCs with respect to the total number of 
samples analysed was sufficient.  
Reasons for sample reassay and reported concentrations were listed in the report but were initially not 
described. This information was provided later on during the procedure. In addition, a previously 
validated dilution factor was used for samples above the limit of quantitation. 
During the procedure, the MAH confirmed that all study samples were analysed within the proven stability 
period. Currently, long term stability has been established up to 1780 days. Freeze-thaw stability has 
been established up to 10 cycles.  
The bioanalytical methods used for RUBY study were the same as the ones used for the GARNET study, 
which were found acceptable in previous regulatory procedures. Overall, the determination of dostarlimab 
in human serum for RUBY study samples was satisfactorily carried out in accordance with the principles of 
ICH M10 Guideline.  
Immunogenicity studies for the determination of ADAs and Nabs were conducted according to the state of 
the art. 
After excluding 1060 (13.2%) BLQ observation (842 collected prior to first dose), the final dataset for the 
current Population PK model included data from both GARNET and RUBY studies, 8032 observation 
records from 869 patients, 233 patients treated with the combination treatment and 636 patients 
receiving the monotherapy. Additionally 75 observations were removed due to high CWRES or visual 
inspection.  
A population PK analysis was previously performed based on data from the GARNET study (cutoff date 1st 
of March 2020). Dostarlimab PK was described using a 2-compartment model with linear and time 
Assessment report

dependency in clearance and estimated allometric exponents for body weight on Cl and volume 
parameters (Vc and Vp). 
The modelling strategy encompasses, firstly, the external evaluation of a previously developed population 
PK model with data from RUBY study. Subsequently, the population PK model was refined through a re-
analysis of covariate effects with all data available. Overall, the strategy is endorsed because it first 
evaluates the adequacy of a previously developed population PK model, suggesting similar PK behaviour 
of dostarlimab in RUBY study. Similarly, as more experimental evidence has been collected, further 
refinement in the identification and estimation of covariate effects would enrich model predictions.  
The current population PK model development of dostarlimab includes the re-use of the previously 
developed model to characterize the PK of dostarlimab in subjects with dMMR/MSI-H primary advanced or 
recurrent EC treated with the combination therapy. Based on pcVPC and GOF plots, no major deviations 
at the structural and individual level were observed when the previous population PK model was applied 
to RUBY data. Then, the previous model was used as the new base model. Subsequently, additional 
changes were introduced and covariate search using SCM method was carried out.  
The final PK model contains 9 covariates effects including WT on CL and Vp and Vc, included in the base 
model using the principles of allometry and age, time-varying ALB, ALT, combination therapy, sex on CL 
and time varying ALB and sex on Vc, included using the SCM method. The final parameter estimates of 
the final model are adequate based on the RSE, which is <40%. Shrinkage values were 14.1%, 12.7% 
and 46.3 % for CL, Vc and Imax respectively. Low-to-moderate inter-individual variability has been 
characterized on CL (23.7%) and VC (16.7%), as a consequence of the 9 covariate effects included in the 
final population PK model. However, high inter-individual variability on Imax (95%) was obtained. 
Different patient related time-varying covariates (albumin (ALB), creatinine clearance, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, and lymphocyte count) and previously responder versus non-responder 
status have been investigated on Imax during the SCM step. However, only time-varying albumin was 
found to be statistically significant. The clinical relevance of including time-varying albumin is negligible in 
terms of parameter estimate (2%) and inter-individual variability reduction (3%). In terms of model 
parsimony, the submitted final covariate model is adequate.  
Standard GOF and pcVPC plots suggest no relevant model deviations either for the combination therapy 
of the monotherapy, showing the adequacy of the final population PK model to describe the observed 
data. 
A forest plot has been provided to assess the clinical relevance of the covariates selected based on the 
change on the PK exposure parameters (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) at steady state. Forest plot has also been 
provided to evaluate the predicted changes in exposure at cycle 1. 
The clinical relevance analysis at steady-state did not identify changes in exposure greater than 20%, 
except for low levels of albumin (below 29 g/L) and high body weight (>116 kg). To support the 
appropriateness of the current dose regimen, simulations have been performed to predict dostarlimab 
Cmin concentration at cycle 1 and at steady state by WT and Albumin category. The results showed that 
most of the patients achieved values greater than 18 mg/L (concentration estimated for maintenance of 
90% of maximal peripheral PD-1 suppression). 
No differences in exposure are expected in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment vs patients 
with normal renal function, based on the predicted exposure (Cmax and AUC) levels with the proposed 
dosing regimen. Similarly, no differences in exposure are expected in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment vs patients with normal hepatic function with the proposed dosing regimen. These results 
were expected since no statistically significant covariates related to renal or hepatic function were 
associated to any PK parameter.

No interaction studies have been performed. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as dostarlimab are not 
substrates for cytochrome P450 or active substance transporters. Dostarlimab is not a cytokine and is 
unlikely to be a cytokine modulator. Additionally, pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction of dostarlimab with 
small molecule active substances is not expected. There is no evidence of interaction mediated by non-
specific clearance of lysosome degradation for antibodies. The impact of concomitant carboplatin and 
paclitaxel on exposure was limited and not of clinical relevance. There were not enough individuals in 
each category of immune suppressors or immune stimulators for evaluation as covariates. No impact of 
systemic use of corticosteroids on dostarlimab PK was found. 
Immunogenicity was assessed in Studies GARNET and RUBY. In the GARNET study, the overall incidence 
was low, 2.1% of the patients (N=418, 384 received the monotherapy) tested positive for ADA, and 1% 
had Nab. In the RUBY study, the incidence of treatment induced ADA was 0% (N=225), 34 participants 
(15.1%) had treatment unaffected ADA and 6 participants (2.7%) had inconclusive results. 50% of 
patients with treatment unaffected ADA had positive Nab. Similar immunogenicity was observed between 
the dMMR/MSI-H and the MMRp/MSS populations. There were no treatment-emergent ADAs in Part 1 of 
the RUBY study and no observed impact of dostarlimab immunogenicity on safety, efficacy, or PK 
endpoints. These data are consistent with the immunogenicity results from the GARNET study and 
confirm the overall immunogenicity risk for dostarlimab is low. The low immunogenicity risk of 
dostarlimab is consistent with other anti-PD-1 antibodies [Keytruda SmPC 2022; Opdivo USPI 2022; 
Opdivo SmPC 2022]. 
The exposure-efficacy analysis was performed with data from subjects in the dostarlimab plus SOC arm 
from the RUBY study, where patients received 500 mg Q3W for 6 cycles plus 1000 mg Q6W afterwards. 
PFS and DOR were used as the efficacy outcome and as exposure metric predicted cycle 1 Cmin, Cmax 
and AUC. (232 subjects with PFS data and 147 DOR observations were included in the dataset). 
Kaplan-Meier plots stratified by quartiles of exposures were constructed for both efficacy endpoints. The 
results from the Kaplan-Meier suggest PFS and DOR seem to be independent of exposure (high degree of 
overlapping), which was then confirmed with the Cox regression models for PFS and DOR. However, what 
actually happens is that the range of exposure evaluated is too limited to be able to identify differences 
on the efficacy endpoints, since the accumulated dose in the study arm is equivalent throughout the 
study (500 mg Q3W vs 1000 mg Q6W). In the absence of an informative exposure-efficacy study, with 
dose levels or regimens that allow for a greater range of exposure, it can only be concluded that the 
exposure-efficacy relationship in the present analysis is flat at the proposed dosing regimen.  
The exposure-safety analysis was conducted with the five most prevalent drug-related adverse events 
(arthralgia, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and rash). The analysis was performed based on the following 3 
periods, cycles 1 thorough 6, cycle 7 and beyond and all cycles. Cycle 1 exposure (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) 
was used as the exposure metric valid for the 3 periods studied. Univariate analysis revealed a significant 
relationship for rash over placebo with all three exposure metrics. The predicted probability in the 
dostarlimab arm is less than 30% with the proposed dosing regimen, suggesting a minor clinical impact. 
In the case of arthralgia, no relationship was detected when all patients were included, however, when 
the placebo patients were excluded a significant relationship was observed. However, the predicted 
probability of arthralgia is less than 20% at the higher range of dostarlimab exposure at steady-state with 
the proposed regimen, which is not clinically relevant. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/ microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) 
primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC) and who are candidates for systemic therapy,

based on results from study 213361 (RUBY) Part 1 have been adequately characterized using a previously

Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The dual primary objectives of Part 1 of the RUBY study were: 
• 
To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of participants treated with dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab to participants administered placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel followed by placebo, as assessed by the Investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v.1.1) in the following: 
-  Participants with dMMR/MSI-H primary advanced or recurrent EC 
-  All participants with primary advanced or recurrent EC 
• 
To compare the overall survival (OS) of participants treated with dostarlimab plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab to participants administered placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel 
followed by placebo. 
-  All participants with primary advanced or recurrent EC. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of Part 1 of the RUBY study were: 
•

Outcomes/endpoints 
The dual primary efficacy endpoints were PFS by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1 and OS.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of PFS is based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1, defined as 
the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of radiographic assessment of PD or death by 
any cause in the absence of PD, whichever occurs first. PFS was assessed in both in the dMMR/MSI-H and 
overall populations of participants with primary advanced or recurrent EC.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death by 
any cause. This primary endpoint was assessed only in the overall population. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: 
• 
PFS based on BICR, defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of assessment of PD 
per RECIST v1.1 or death by any cause in the absence of PD per RECIST v1.1, whichever occurs first  
•  ORR based on BICR and Investigator assessment, defined as the proportion of subjects with a best 
overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) 
•  DOR based on BICR and investigator assessment, defined as the time from the first documentation of 
CR or PR until the time of the first documentation of subsequent PD per RECIST v1.1 or death by any 
cause in the absence of PD per RECIST v1.1, whichever occurs first 
•  DCR based on BICR and investigator assessment, defined as the proportion of participants who have 
achieved a BOR of CR, PR, SD, non-CR/non-PD, or no disease per RECIST v1.1 
• 
• 
• 
PFS2, defined as the time from treatment randomization to the date of assessment of progression on 
the first subsequent anticancer therapy following study intervention or death by any cause, whichever 
is earlier

Sample size 
The sample size calculation was driven by the primary efficacy endpoint of PFS, as assessed by the 
Investigator using RECIST v.1.1. The following assumptions were made for the sample size calculation: 
• 
• 
dMMR/MSI Status Independent Participant Population (all-comers): HR of 0.67, corresponding to 
an increase in median PFS from 10 months in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm to 15 
months in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
dMMR/MSI-H Participant Population: HR of 0.50, corresponding to an increase in median PFS from 
10 months in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm to 20 months in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm

• 
Participant distribution by tumor MMR/MSI status: 25% with dMMR/MSI-H and 75% with 
MMRp/MSS 
•  1:1 randomization 
•  Alpha=0.02 (1-sided) 
• 
Power=approximately 89% for testing of H1 
•  Accrual over a period of 22 months 
•  Assuming an annual dropout rate of 5% 
• 
Exponential distribution of PFS 
With the assumptions above, and a group sequential log-rank test design with 2 analyses planned: 1 IA 
at approximately 84.6% information and 1 FA, based on a Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) alpha spending 
function [Lan, 1983] a total sample size of 470 participants was planned, and approximately 118 
participants were expected to be dMMR/MSI-H. To maintain the natural distribution of dMMR/MSI-H 
(25%) and MMRp/MSS (75%) participants in the overall EC population in this study, the number of 
participants enrolled with dMMR/MSI-H or MMRp/MSS EC would be capped at approximately 120 or 350, 
respectively. In addition, the total number of participants with carcinosarcoma was capped at 50 
(approximately 10%) to prevent overrepresentation of this patient population. 
Randomisation 
Subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
dostarlimab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel) or placebo plus chemotherapy (carboplatin-
paclitaxel). Randomization was completed in a blinded manner using an interactive web response system. 
Randomization was stratified by 3 stratification factors: 
•  MMR/MSI status: Determined by local IHC, PCR, or next-generation sequencing test, or by central 
IHC testing when local testing was not available. The MMR/MSI status for randomization was derived 
from the data entered at the time of randomization. 
• 
Prior external pelvic radiotherapy (yes or no): Determined from radiation therapy history provided by 
investigators at the time of randomization.  
•  Disease status (recurrent, primary Stage III, or primary Stage IV): Derived from the cancer history 
and disease stage provided by investigators at the time of randomization. Data provided for the most 
recent FIGO stage and recurrence status were used to assign the participant to the appropriate 
stratum. If recurrence was selected, participants were assigned to recurrent strata. If no recurrence 
was selected, then participants were assigned to primary Stage III or primary Stage IV based on 
most recent FIGO stage. 
Blinding (masking) 
The participant, Investigator, study staff, the sponsor study team, and its representatives were blinded to 
the assigned treatment from the time of randomization until database lock as described in the protocol. 
Treatment assignment could be unblinded by the Investigator for urgent or non-urgent clinical reasons as 
described in the protocol. 
Study intervention assignment was available to the Investigator upon request for post-study intervention 
planning.

Statistical methods 
The original statistical analysis plan (SAP) was issued on 29 October 2019. The SAP was amended once, 
and SAP Amendment 1 was issued on 06 October 2022 prior to the unblinding of RUBY Part 1 on 23

Part 1 of the study used the graphical method [Maurer, 2013] to provide strong multiplicity control for 
multiple hypotheses as well as interim analyses. The family-wise type I error for this study is strongly 
controlled at 2.5% (one-sided). The initial one-sided alpha-allocation for PFS and OS is presented 
graphically in Figure 2. Hypotheses presented as nodes in squares are divided into 2 subfamilies 
presented in ellipsoids. The weights for re-allocation from each subfamily/hypothesis to the others are 
represented on the lines connecting hypotheses.

1. The alpha level assigned to a subfamily will be rolled over only if the hypotheses within the subfamily 
are all significant based on the weight for re-allocation presented on the dashed lines connecting 
subfamilies. Within each subfamily, the weights for re-allocation from each hypothesis to the others are 
represented on the solid lines connecting hypotheses.

2. Hypothesis testing for PFS in all-comers will only be performed if null hypothesis of PFS has been 
rejected in dMMR/MSI-H. 
3. Hypothesis testing for OS will start at the time when the hypothesis testing for PFS has completed 
(i.e., no further hypothesis testing could be performed for PFS), at re-allocated alpha level (2.5%) if both 
null hypotheses have been rejected for H1 and H2; otherwise, OS will be tested at initial alpha level 
(0.5%). 
Interim analyses 
To test hypothesis 1 (H1) (PFS in dMMR/MSI-H), a stratified group sequential log-rank test with one IA 
and one FA was planned. The IA was planned at approximately 77 events, and the FA was planned at 91 
events. The boundary for declaring superiority of Arm 1 over Arm 2 is based on a Lan-DeMets (OʼBrien-
Fleming) alpha spending function [Lan, 1983] with overall alpha=0.02, 1-tailed. The IA of PFS in 
dMMR/MSI-H was based on the data cutoff date of 28 September 2022, when 66 PFS events were 
observed in the dMMR/MSI-H population. The stopping boundary was adjusted based on the actual 
observed number of PFS events with a p-value stopping boundary=0.00630. 
To test hypothesis 3 (H3) (OS in all-comers), a stratified group sequential log-rank test based on a Lan-
DeMets (OʼBrien-Fleming) alpha spending function [Lan, 1983] was planned. Based on the positive testing 
results of PFS in both the dMMR/MSI-H (H1) and all-comers (H2) populations at the IA of PFS in 
dMMR/MSI-H population, the alpha level and number of planned analyses for OS followed scenario 1 (i.e., 
OS was tested at one-sided alpha level of 0.025 with 3 planned IAs and 1 FA at 321 OS events). The first 
IA of OS was conducted at the same time as the IA of PFS in the dMMR/MSI-H population, when 165 
deaths were observed. 
The stopping boundary for this first IA of OS was adjusted based on the actual observed number of 
deaths with a p-value stopping boundary of 0.00177. 
The IA to assess superiority was performed by an IDMC.

Analyses populations 
The analysis sets evaluated in Part 1 of this study are presented in the following table: 
Table 39. Analysis Sets 
dMMR/MSI-H and MMRp/MSS Subset of Analysis Set 
The dMMR/MSI-H and MMRp/MSS populations were defined as the subset of the analysis set defined 
above based on the actual MMR/MSI status collected in eCRF (i.e., source verified classifications of 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 74/156 
 
 
 
 
 
dMMR/MSI-H or MMRp/MSS). Unless otherwise specified, all analyses in each of the analysis sets above 
were performed in the corresponding dMMR/MSI-H subset. Selected analyses were performed in the 
corresponding MMRp/MSS subset as specified in the statistical analysis plan. 
For any analysis of efficacy endpoints (PFS, OS, ORR, DCR, DOR, PFS2) performed on dMMR/MSI-H and 
MMRp/MSS subset of the ITT analysis set based on source verified MMR/MSI classification collected in 
eCRF, a paired sensitivity analysis was also performed on dMMR/MSI-H and MMRp/MSS cohorts within the 
ITT analysis set based on MMR/MSI classification entered for randomization. 
Subgroup analyses 
The following exploratory subgroup analyses of PFS per Investigator assessment and primary censoring 
rule and OS (primary endpoints) were performed based on the ITT analysis set and dMMR/MSI-H subset 
of the ITT analysis set to explore the homogeneity of the treatment effect across relevant participant 
subsets: 
•  Age (< 65 years or ≥65 years) 
•  Race (White or Other) 
•  Region (North America or Europe or Western Europe or Eastern Europe) 
•  Histology (Endometrioid carcinoma or Other) 
•  Disease status at baseline (recurrent, primary Stage III, or primary Stage IV), according to the eCRF 
(source verified classification) 
•  MMR/MSI status at baseline (dMMR/MSI-H or MMRp/MSS or dMMR), according to the eCRF (source 
verified classification) 
• 
Prior external pelvic radiotherapy (yes or no), according to the eCRF (source verified classification) 
•  Subjects with “No disease” at baseline 
Additional subgroup analyses of PFS per Investigator assessment and primary censoring rule were 
conducted for participants with target lesions or non-target lesions at baseline and participants who had 
target lesions at baseline, respectively.  
Post-hoc subgroup analyses were also performed in the MMRp/MSS subset, if not prespecified in the SAP 
Amendment 1. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses for primary endpoint of PFS per Investigator assessment 
The following sensitivity analyses for PFS per Investigator assessment were performed (Sensitivity 
Analysis- to Sensitivity Analysis were planned and performed based on the ITT analysis set, and 
dMMR/MSI-H subsets of ITT). 
•  Sensitivity Analysis 1: The potential attrition bias was assessed by using sensitivity analysis censoring 
rule 1. The stratification factors used in the primary analysis (i.e., stratification factors entered at 
randomization) were applied in the stratified log-rank test and stratified Cox model. The sensitivity 
censoring rule 1 was the same as the primary analysis censoring rule except that for subjects who 
have PD or death, the date of PD was the date of the first assessment at which PD was objectively 
documented per RECIST v.1.1 or death date, whichever occurred earlier, regardless of whether PD or 
death was documented after ≥2 missed disease assessments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 75/156 
 
 
 
 
•  Sensitivity Analysis 2: The potential attrition bias was assessed by using sensitivity analysis censoring 
rule 2. The stratification factors used in the primary analysis (i.e., stratification factors entered at 
randomization) were applied in the stratified log-rank test and stratified Cox model. The sensitivity 
censoring rule 2 was the same as the sensitivity analysis censoring rule 1 except that it considered 
discontinuation of treatment or initiation of new anticancer therapy, whichever occurred later, to be a 
PD event for subjects without documented PD or death. 
•  Sensitivity Analysis 3: The potential impact of ascertainment bias was assessed by sensitivity analysis 
using the BICR-assessed PFS. The stratification factors (i.e., stratification factors entered at 
randomization) and censoring rules used in the primary analysis were applied in the stratified log-
rank test and stratified Cox model. In addition, the distribution of discrepancy in progression 
assessment between BICR and Investigator was summarized by treatment group. 
•  Sensitivity Analysis 4: The potential impact of misclassification of randomization stratification factors 
was assessed by using the source verified values from eCRF as the stratification factors in the 
stratified log-rank test and stratified cox model in this sensitivity analysis. The censoring rules used in 
the primary analysis was applied. In addition, the distribution of discrepancy in each stratification 
factor between the values of stratification factors entered at randomization and the source verified 
values of stratification factors from eCRF was summarized by treatment group. 
•  Sensitivity Analysis 5: The Investigator assessment data was planned to be assessed using the per-
protocol analysis set in this sensitivity analysis. The stratification factors would have been based on 
the source verified values from eCRF. The censoring rules used in the primary analysis would have 
been applied. The sensitivity analysis based on per-protocol analysis set was not conducted because 
the per-protocol analysis set comprised >90% of the ITT analysis set.  
Additional sensitivity analyses to the efficacy endpoints 
For any analysis of PFS, OS, ORR, DCR, DOR, or PFS2 performed on the dMMR/MSI-H and MMRp/MSS 
subsets based on the source verified MMR/MSI classification collected in eCRF, a paired sensitivity 
analysis (post-hoc) was performed on the dMMR/MSI-H and MMRp/MSS subsets based on the MMR/MSI 
classification entered at randomization.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 34. Participant flow 
dMMR/MSI-H population 
As of the data cut-off date of 28 September 2022, there were 607 participants with primary advanced or 
recurrent EC who were screened for eligibility, and of these, 494 participants were enrolled and 
randomized in RUBY Part 1 (results from an additional DCO of 1 March 2023 were provided only for OS).  
In the dMMR/MSI-H population as of the data cut-off date, 75.5% of participants in the dostarlimab 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 50.8% of participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
remained ongoing in the study. Death due to disease progression was the most frequently reported 
reason for discontinuation from the study. 
The median duration of follow-up was 24.79 months and was consistent between treatment arms. 
In both treatment arms, the most common reason for dostarlimab or placebo discontinuation was PD 
according to RECIST v.1.1 criteria per Investigator assessment (25.0% dostarlimab plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel, 61.5% placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel). The most common reason for discontinuation for 
carboplatin or paclitaxel was AE. 
The prespecified dMMR/MSI-H population was determined by the source verified value of MMR/MSI 
status. Although MMR/MSI status was a stratification factor, there was an imbalance noted between the 2 
treatment arms in the dMMR/MSI-H subset of the ITT analysis set (n=53 in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and n=65 in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm). This was because the 
prespecified classification for the primary analysis was based on the‘trueʼsource verified value entered by 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 77/156 
 
 
 
 
 
the site for dMMR/MSI-H classification at the time of database lock, and not the site data entry for 
randomization purpose at the time of randomization. The reason for the observed imbalance between the 
arms based on source verified value for dMMR/MSI-H characterization was due to mis-stratification of 
MMR/MSI data entered for randomization purpose at the time of randomization (n=22), which was then 
sourced verified in the MMR/MSI eCRF page. The number of participants in each arm determined by the 
dMMR/MSI-H value entered at randomization was 60 (dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm) vs 62 
(placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm). 
For each efficacy analysis performed based on the dMMR/MSI-H subset of the ITT analysis set determined 
by the source verified value, a paired sensitivity analysis based on the subset determined by the value 
entered at randomization was also performed showing consistent results using both values for 
dMMR/MSI-H characterization.

Table 42. Summary of Participant Disposition (Overall population, ITT Analysis Set) 
Recruitment 
The first participant was enrolled on 07 August 2019. The study was conducted in 158 centres in 19 
countries. As of the data cut-off on 28 September 2022, there were 88 participants remaining on 
treatment. Part 1 had closed enrolment in January 2021. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was issued on 13 March 2019. Three global amendments to the study protocol were 
implemented prior to the time of the data cut-off:

Protocol Amendment 1 (Version 2.0, Dated 11 November 2020) 
The primary reasons for this amendment were: 
• 
The addition of Part 2 to the RUBY study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab plus niraparib (Arm 3) versus 
Assessment report

treatment with placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by placebo (Arm 4) in subjects with 
recurrent or primary advanced (Stage III or IV) endometrial cancer. 
• 
The primary endpoint was changed from PFS per Investigator Assessment to PFS per BICR. This was 
to mitigate the potential risk of bias associated with some investigators requesting to unblind 
treatment allocation when participants entered the treatment maintenance phase, to keep those that 
were assigned to the placebo arm from visiting the study site during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Protocol Amendment 2 (Version 3.0, Dated 23 September 2021) 
The primary reasons for this amendment were: 
• 
To revise the RUBY Part 1 statistical design to include both PFS and OS as dual primary endpoints 
with alpha splitting (one-sided 0.02 for PFS and one-sided 0.005 for OS), which also allows alpha 
recycling from PFS to OS. 
•  Within PFS, the original Hochberg procedure for multiplicity control of hypothesis testing was revised 
to a hierarchical testing strategy for PFS in the dMMR/MSI-H followed by the overall population. 
Protocol Amendment 3 (Version 4.0, Dated 31 March 2022) 
The primary reasons for this amendment were: 
• 
The primary endpoint was reverted to PFS assessed by the investigator, as was initially proposed with 
the original protocol. Accordingly, PFS assessed by BICR was changed to a secondary endpoint. 
-  The RUBY study was initially designed with PFS per Investigator assessment as the primary 
objective, which was amended to PFS per BICR with the release of Protocol amendment 1 
(Version 2.0 dated 11 November 2020) to mitigate the risk of bias associated with potential 
unblinding during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
-  The potential risk of bias that drove the initial change in the primary objective did not materialize 
as only 4 participants were eventually unblinded in one site in the United States. Therefore, the 
primary endpoint was reverted to the original design of PFS per Investigator assessment (RECIST 
v1.1). 
• 
The statistical design for RUBY Part 2 was updated. Per regulator feedback, the interim PFS analysis 
was removed. Additionally, the nominal power of PFS was increased to mitigate the impact of 
potential non-proportional hazards. Hypothesis testing for key secondary endpoint OS was added. 
Protocol deviations  
In May 2020, the clinical study transitioned from TESARO protocol deviation definitions and 
methodologies to those of GSK. Discussion of protocol deviations focused on significant protocol 
deviations (according to the TESARO definition) and important protocol deviations (according to the 
TESARO and GSK definitions) as these align with protocol deviation categories with potential impact on 
study integrity or participant safety. It was noted that the SAP definition did not include significant 
protocol deviations (TESARO definition), therefore a post-hoc analysis was performed to include these in 
the summary of the protocol deviation data. The relatively high frequency of resulting protocol deviations 
is likely due to the variation in the definitions in the two methodologies, since the TESARO definitions 
included categories with a broader scope.

Nearly all participants (97.0%) had prior reported medical conditions, and these were generally similar 
between treatment arms (<5% difference). The most frequently reported (>50% of total participants) 
medical history conditions by system organ class were vascular disorders (62.8%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (59.5%), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (56.3%). The most frequently reported 
(>50% of total participants) medical history condition by preferred term was hypertension (55.3%). 
dMMR/MSI-H population 
Medical history for the dMMR/MSI-H population was generally similar to the overall population. In the 
dMMR/MSI-H population there was a bit more variation between treatment arms, however differences 
between treatment arms remained <10%.

Overall population  
Table 49. Summary of prior anticancer radiotherapy, surgery, and treatment (Overall 
population, ITT analysis set) 
dMMR/MSI-H population 
Approximately 14% of participants in the dMMR/MSI-H population received prior anticancer therapy: 
13.2% in the dostarlimab arm vs. 15.4% in the placebo arm.  
Prior non-anticancer medications in the dMMR/MSI population were similar to the overall population. No 
noteworthy differences were observed in prior non-anticancer treatment use between treatment arms.  
In the dMMR/MSI-H population, 92.4% of participants had received prior anticancer surgical interventions 
for EC and 34.7% of participants received previous radiotherapy. 
Fewer participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel had received external pelvic radiotherapy 
than the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (15.1% versus 20.0%).

Concomitant medications  
Overall population 
The most frequent (>50% of total participants) concomitant medications in the overall population were 
dexamethasone, paracetamol, ondansetron, and famotidine, which was generally similar for the 
dMMR/MSI-H population.  
In the overall population there were no noteworthy differences in concomitant medications (>10%) 
between the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared to the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm with the exception of prednisone (18.7% dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel, 6.9% 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel). Increased use of glucocorticoids as a concomitant medication was 
expected in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm based on the known side effect profile of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
dMMR/MSI-H population  
In the dMMR/MSI-H population the reported use of ondansetron, prednisone, ascorbic acid, and 
levoglutamide was >10% higher in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared with the 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, whereas reported use of lisinopril, palonosetron, aprepitant, 
metformin, and potassium was higher (>10% difference) in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
compared with the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
Numbers analysed 
The ITT analysis set (n=494) comprised participants who were randomized (regardless of treatment 
received). Enrolled participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either dostarlimab plus carboplatin - 
paclitaxel (245 participants) or placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (249 participants). The overall 
population included all 494 participants in the ITT analysis set, which included the dMMR/MSI-H 
population (118 participants) or the MMRp/MSS population (376 participants). 
The prespecified dMMR/MSI-H population for efficacy analysis was determined by the source verified 
value of MMR/MSI status. The number of participants in each arm of the dMMR/MSI-H subset of ITT 
analysis set determined by the source verified value of MMR/MSI status was 53 (dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm) vs 65 (placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm). 
The per-protocol population included 487 participants. Given that it comprised >90% of the ITT analysis 
set, efficacy analyses were not carried out for the per-protocol population.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoints 
•  Progression-free survival by Investigator assessment 
dMMR/MSI-H population 
At the time of data cutoff (56% PFS maturity), dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel reduced the risk of 
progression or death by 72%, with a HR for progression or death of 0.28 (95% CI 0.162, 0.495, stratified 
log-rank test p-value <0.0001; median PFS not reached versus 7.7 months, respectively). The stopping 
boundary (p=0.00630) for claiming superiority of dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel over placebo 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel in prolonging PFS in the dMMR/MSI-H population at the interim analysis was 
crossed. The estimated Kaplan-Meier probability of progression-free survival at 24 months were 61.4% 
and 15.7% in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel and placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arms, 
respectively.

•  Overall survival  
dMMR/MSI-H population 
Although OS in the dMMR/MSI-H population is not a primary endpoint, a prespecified subgroup analysis of 
OS in this population was also performed. At 26% OS maturity, there was a trend in favor of the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm with a 70% reduction in deaths and a HR of 0.30 (95% CI 
0.127,0.699; nominal stratified log-rank test p-value=0.0016; median OS not reached for either arm). 
The Kaplan-Meier probability of survival at 24 months was 83.3% and 58.7% in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel and placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arms, respectively.

baseline disease (HR of 1.16 [95% CI 0.520, 2.590]). In addition, higher HRs were observed in Europe 
versus North America. The inability to detect a treatment difference in PFS in certain subgroups should be 
interpreted with caution and may be attributed to the smaller participant numbers, the low data maturity 
in some subgroups, and the fact that the analysis was not powered to detect treatment differences in any 
subgroup. 
A forest plot of PFS in the dMMR/MSI-H population showed HRs <1 for all subgroups with generally 
similar trends as in the overall population, although individual subgroups in this population have small 
numbers of participants.

PD-L1 expression 
PD-L1 status was evaluated by retrospective central testing in a post-hoc exploratory analysis for biopsy 
samples collected from RUBY Part 1 participants. PD-L1 status was determined using the anti PD-L1 22C3 
antibody (DAKO) to calculate a combined positive score (CPS) on available archival tumour specimens 
following central testing for MMR status. A CPS cutoff of ≥1 was selected based on receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and was used to define PD-L1 positive (PD-L1+) status in an 
exploratory setting. Participants were neither stratified nor selected according to PD-L1 status, and the 
study was not powered to detect a difference in PFS or OS according to PD-L1 status. 
PD-L1 test results were available for a total of 268 participants (54% overall), including 76 participants 
with dMMR/MSI-H EC and 192 participants with MMRp/MSS EC. Among those with PD-L1 status available, 
PD-L1+ status (CPS ≥1) was similar but slightly more frequent in dMMR/MSI-H (58 out of 76 [76%]) 
compared with MMRp/MSS participants (133 out of 192 [69%]. Due to the small number of participants in 
the dMMR/MSI-H subgroup with PDL1- (CPS <1), efficacy results of only ORR and DOR are provided.

Sensitivity analyses 
Several sensitivity analyses were performed to interrogate the data and evaluate for potential biases. 
Sensitivity analyses 1 and 2 used alternate censoring rules for PFS, sensitivity analysis 3 used BICR 
assessment instead of investigator assessment (and was performed as a secondary endpoint), and 
sensitivity analysis 4 was performed to address the potential misclassification of randomization 
stratification factors (using stratification factors based on the source verified values from eCRF in the 
stratified log-rank test and stratified cox model). Sensitivity analysis 5 based on the per protocol analysis 
set was not conducted because the per-protocol analysis set comprised >90% of the ITT analysis set. 
A paired sensitivity analysis was also performed by defining the dMMR/MSI-H and MMRp/MSS populations 
based on MMR/MSI classification entered at the time of randomization, in addition to the dMMR/MSI-H 
and MMRp/MSS populations prespecified based on the source verified data at the time of the data cutoff. 
This paired sensitivity analysis was performed for PFS, to the primary analysis and sensitivity analyses 1-
4.  
The paired sensitivity analysis was also conducted on other efficacy endpoints as assessed by the 
Investigator including OS, ORR, DOR, PFS2, and for PFS in those with measurable disease (target lesions) 
at baseline; or evaluable disease (target or non-target lesions) at baseline.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
With the current application, the MAH is applying for an extension of the indication for Jemperli, in 
combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, to be used for the treatment of adult patients with primary 
advanced or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer (EC) and who are candidates for systemic 
therapy. To support this application, results from study RUBY Part 1 have been submitted.  
Additionally, with the submission of this type II variation the MAH also intends to fulfil SOB-clin-002 and 
convert the conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) into full approval. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Design 
The study RUBY is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study comparing dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel versus placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or primary 
advanced EC. This study has two parts, with Part 1 being the object of this submission. Additionally, the 
intended target population is not the overall population included in Part 1 of the study, but the 
dMMR/MSI-H population, which was a subset of the overall population. Thus, this discussion is focused on 
the dMMR/MSI-H population; although results in the overall population have been considered as 
supportive data in some instances, and, therefore, references to the overall population are made all along 
the discussion.  
Part 1 of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with dostarlimab (500 mg IV every 
3 weeks – 6 cycles) plus carboplatin-paclitaxel, followed by dostarlimab (1000 mg IV every 6 weeks; up 
to 3 years) versus treatment with placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by placebo in participants 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 110/156 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with primary advanced (Stage III or IV) or recurrent EC. It is noted that the number of cycles of 
dostarlimab 500 mg in the applied indication, in which it is administered in combination with 
chemotherapy, is higher than the number of doses already approved for the indication of dostarlimab as 
monotherapy (i.e. 6 and 4, respectively). The MAH states that this switch was done to align the cycles of 
dostarlimab 500 mg with the chemotherapy treatment cycles, which is considered acceptable and 
endorsed.   
Randomization was stratified by MMR/MSI status (dMMR/MSI-H or MMR-proficient [MMRp]/MSS), prior 
external pelvic radiotherapy (yes or no) and disease status (recurrent, primary Stage III, or primary 
Stage IV). Those randomization factors are considered adequate.  
The comparator and its posology are also deemed acceptable and in line with the international guidelines 
(i.e., ESMO guideline) and clinical practice in EU.  
Overall, the design of the study is considered adequate to establish the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab 
in the sought indication.  
Study participants 
Participants were eligible to be included in Part 1 of this study if they had primary Stage III or Stage IV 
disease (FIGO staging) or first recurrent EC with a low potential for cure by radiation therapy or surgery 
alone or in combination. Additionally, participants had to meet at least 1 of the following criteria: Stage 
IIIA to IIIC1 with measurable disease; Stage IIIC1 disease with carcinosarcoma, clear cell, serous, or 
mixed histology, regardless of presence of measurable disease; Stage IIIC2 or Stage IV disease, 
regardless of presence of measurable disease; first recurrent disease and naïve to systemic anticancer 
therapy; prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant systemic anticancer therapy with recurrence or PD ≥6 months after 
completing treatment. Patients with uterine sarcoma were not allowed.  
Patients were excluded if they had received prior anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapies, 
hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy) within 21 days or <5 times the half-life of the most 
recent therapy prior to Study Day 1, whichever is shorter. Of note, radiotherapy was not allowed during 
the study.  
Endpoints 
The dual primary endpoints of RUBY Part 1 were PFS by investigator (in both the overall population and 
the dMMR/MSI-H population) and OS (in the overall population). In this context, although OS would have 
been the preferred option, a dual (PFS and OS) primary endpoint was also considered acceptable, 
provided relatively mature and positive/supportive OS data would be available at the time of a benefit-
risk assessment, as pointed out in the scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/3585/2/2018/II). In this regard, it 
should be noted that the advice provided referred to the overall population instead of to the dMMR/MSI-H 
population. Since the object of this submission is the dMMR/MSI-H population, and for this population the 
OS data was not formally assessed, OS data from the overall population has been considered as 
supportive data.  
Secondary endpoints included PFS by a blinded independent central review (BICR), ORR by BICR and 
investigator, DOR by BICR and investigator, DCR by BICR and investigator, PFS2 and PROs. All secondary 
endpoints are overall endorsed. Additional comments on the adequacy of primary and secondary 
endpoints, and its changes over the conduct of the clinical trial, are further discussed in the section 
“Protocol amendments”.  
Sample size and statistical methods 
The assumptions and operating characteristics presented justify the total sample size of 470 patients that 
was planned considering that the study would have been powered at a level of 89% at the end of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 111/156 
 
 
 
 
study using a one-sided 2% alpha. In addition, one interim analysis was planned when 84.6% of the 
information is accrued and, in case that both tests would have not been significant, then the dual primary 
endpoint would have been tested at the time of the final analysis. The overall plan is acceptable. 
A graphical approach has been used to control the type I error for the dual endpoints. This approach also 
allows recycling the alpha from PFS to OS in case the first endpoint is significant. This method controls 
the type I error appropriately and is endorsed. 
It is important to note that the duration of treatment that the MAH proposes is for up to 3 years (or until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity): in section 4.2 of the SmPC it is stated that “Administration 
of dostarlimab should continue according to the recommended schedule until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity, or for a duration of up to 3 years (see section 5.1).” At the time of the DCO 16 
(30.8%) patients in the dostarlimab arm and 8 (12.3%) in the placebo arm have received >2 years of 
treatment. According to the MAH, a 3-year treatment duration was chosen because most recurrences in 
EC are diagnosed within 3 years of primary treatment. In the updated data provided after approximately 
5 additional months of follow-up (DCO: 1-Mar-2023), 8 participants with dMMR/MSI-H have received 3 
years of dostarlimab or placebo, out of 117. 6 out of the 8 participants were in the dostarlimab plus 
chemo arm. Although uncertainties still remain regarding the long-term treatment effects (due to the fact 
that only 6 patients received dostarlimab for 3 years), the proposed treatment duration is considered 
acceptable. Section 5.1 of the SmPC includes a sentence specifying the number of patients who received 
treatment for 3 years.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The protocol has been amended three times since its initial version, dated 13 March 2019. These 
amendments included relevant changes regarding the definition of the primary endpoint: with 
amendment 1 (11 November 2020) it was first changed from “PFS per investigator assessment” to “PFS 
per BICR”; with amendment 2 (23 September 2021) it was changed to a dual primary endpoint including 
both PFS and OS; and finally, with amendment 3 (31 March 2022) it was reverted to “PFS assessed by 
the investigator”. According to the MAH the initial change of the primary endpoint was made to mitigate 
the potential risk of bias associated with some investigators requesting to unblind treatment allocation 
when participants entered the treatment maintenance phase, with the aim of keeping those that were 
assigned to the placebo arm from visiting the study site during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rationale of 
this amendment is not fully clear, since it is understood that patients were supposed to visit the study site 
regardless of their allocation. Additionally, with amendment 1 the MAH also included Part 2 of the RUBY 
study. With amendment 2, OS was included as dual primary endpoint (as suggested in the scientific 
advice EMEA/H/SA/3585/2/2018/II) splitting the alpha (2% for PFS and 0.5% for OS) allowing alpha 
recycling from PFS to OS. Also, the MAH changed the Hochberg procedure to hierarchical testing strategy 
for PFS (also recommended in the scientific advice). Finally, with amendment 3, apart from the reversion 
of the primary endpoint from “PFS by BICR” to “PFS by investigator”, the PFS analysis in Part 2 was 
removed per regulator’s feedback. No further comments are made regarding Part 2 of the RUBY study, 
since that part of the study is not part of this submission.  
No clear justification of the (last) change from “PFS by BICR” to “PFS by investigator”. Additionally, even 
if the inclusion of OS as a (dual) primary endpoint is welcome, it is unclear why OS was added as a dual 
primary endpoint in Protocol amendment 2 (dated September 2021), instead of considering it as a 
primary endpoint since the very beginning of the clinical trial, as it was advised by the CHMP during the 
SA in February 2019 (EMEA/H/SA/3585/2/2018/II). Even if changes in the endpoints during the conduct 
of a study should be avoided, the inclusion of OS as primary endpoint is endorsed. Besides, regarding 
PFS, the fact that the study was double blind and results between BICR and investigator appear 
consistent is reassuring.

Protocol deviations  
A relatively high number of important protocol deviations is noted in both arms of the dMMR/MSI-H 
population, with a slight imbalance towards a higher percentage in the dostarlimab arm (45.3% vs. 
35.4% in the placebo arm). Although the number of events in the dostarlimab arm is lower than in the 
placebo arm (50 in the dostarlimab arm vs. 73 in the placebo arm). The most frequently reported 
protocol deviation category was “assessment or time point completion” (17.0% vs. 12.3%), being “out of 
window – efficacy assessment” the subcategory most frequently reported (15.1% vs. 6.2%). Apart from 
that slight difference, no particular trend in terms of the frequency of protocol deviations by event 
category is observed, which is reassuring.   
Baseline data 
As of the data cut-off date 607 patients were screened for eligibility and of these, 494 participants 
(overall population) were randomized 1:1 to receive either dostarlimab plus carboplatin - paclitaxel 
(N=245) or placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (N=249). The most frequently reported reason for not 
meeting eligibility was not meeting inclusion criterion 1 (Female subject at least 18 years of age, who is 
able to understand the study procedures and agrees to participate in the study by providing written 
informed consent)  
: 21 subjects (3.5%). All the other reasons for not meeting eligibility were reported with a similar 
frequency, with no particular trend observed.  
Among the overall population, 118 patients (53 in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 
65 in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm) were dMMR/MSI-H. The prespecified dMMR/MSI-H 
population for efficacy analysis was determined by the source verified value of MMR/MSI status. 
At DCO, in the dostarlimab arm of the dMMR/MSI-H population 75.5% of patients were ongoing in the 
study (43.4% were on study treatment and 32.1% were in follow-up), vs. 50.8% in the placebo arm 
(12.3% were on study treatment and 38.5% in follow-up). In both arms most patients discontinued from 
the study due to death from any cause, but the incidence in the dostarlimab arm was notably lower than 
in the placebo arm: 13.2% vs. 36.9%. The most frequent reason of death was disease progression in 
both arms, but, similarly, this percentage was lower in the dostarlimab arm than in the placebo arm: 
9.4% vs. 29.2%. AEs were the primary cause of death in 3.8% patients in the dostarlimab arm, while in 
the placebo arm no patient died with AE as the primary cause of death.  
As previously outlined, at DCO, 44.2% patients in the dostarlimab arm were ongoing on dostarlimab, and 
12.3% were ongoing on placebo; that is, the percentage of patients on study treatment was more than 
three times higher in the dostarlimab arm than in the placebo arm. Primary reason for discontinuation of 
study treatment was progression disease in both arms: 25.0% in the dostarlimab arm vs. 61.5% in the 
placebo arm; which is also considered as a relevant difference. AEs were the primary reason for 
treatment discontinuation of dostarlimab or placebo in 17.3% of patients in the dostarlimab arm vs. 
10.8% in the placebo arm, which remains within acceptable limits.   
Demographic characteristics 
In the dMMR/MSI-H population the demographic characteristics were overall similar between arms, 
although some differences have been observed. Median age was 61.0 years (range: 45, 81) in the 
dostarlimab arm, vs. 66.0 years (range: 39, 85) in the placebo arm. In line with this observation, the 
percentage of patients ≥65 years was higher in the placebo arm in comparison with the dostarlimab arm: 
53.8% vs. 43.4%, respectively. Median weight was also higher in the placebo arm than in the dostarlimab 
arm: 92.00 kg in the placebo arm vs. 75.85 kg in the dostarlimab arm. In line with this, median BMI was 
also higher in the placebo arm than in the dostarlimab arm: 35.50 in the placebo arm vs. 30.55 in the 
dostarlimab arm. A slight difference was also noted in the ECOG performance status: 60.0% of patients in 
the placebo arm had a score of 0, vs. 53.8% of patients in the dostarlimab arm.

Disease characteristics 
Most patients were Stage III or IV at initial diagnosis: 26.4% were Stage III in the dostarlimab arm vs. 
30.8% in the placebo arm; and 26.4% were Stage IV in the dostarlimab arm vs. 23.1% in the placebo 
arm. The percentages of Stage I and II patients were similar between both arms: 34.0% vs. 33.8% were 
Stage I; and 5.7% vs. 7.7% were Stage II. The proportion of patients with recurrent endometrial cancer 
was of 50.9% in the dostarlimab arm vs. 49.2% in the placebo arm.  
Endometrioid carcinoma was the most frequent histology type at diagnosis, accounting for 83.9%. Four 
(7.5%) patients in the dostarlimab arm had carcinosarcoma, vs. 2 (3.5%) patients in the placebo arm. Of 
note, in the scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/3585/2/2018/II) the CHMP expressed their concerns regarding 
the possible heterogeneity in response in the rare histology types, like carcinosarcoma (which is a more 
aggressive histological subtype). The CHMP suggested that an option to mitigate the risk of including rare 
histology subtypes with a possible different response could be to allow the enrolment in the study but to 
exclude these subjects from the primary efficacy analysis. Of note, this approach has not been followed, 
although, again, it is acknowledged that the SA received was based on the overall population submission, 
instead of on the dMMR/MSI-H population. Considering the low number of patients in each arm, the 
MAH’s approach of not excluding those patients from the primary analysis is considered acceptable. Of 
note, subgroup analyses by histology (i.e. endometrial carcinoma vs other), showed consistent results.  
Prior treatments 
In the dMMR/MSI-H population 13.2% of patients in the dostarlimab arm vs. 15.4% in the placebo arm 
had received any prior anticancer treatment. It is understood that those patients received treatment in 
the (neo)adjuvant setting and had a recurrence setting, since the ones in the primary setting are 
supposed to be newly diagnosed; and, therefore, are not supposed to have received any prior anticancer 
treatment. Most of those patients had received paclitaxel with carboplatin: 7.5% in the dostarlimab arm 
vs. 9.2% in the placebo arm. No relevant differences between treatment arms are observed in terms of 
prior anticancer treatments received; although it is noted that the total number of patients who received 
prior anticancer treatment in each arm is very small (N=7 in the dostarlimab arm and N=10 in the 
placebo arm). The majority of patients had not received prior external pelvic radiotherapy (84.7%) and 
had received prior EC surgery (92.4%). 
Regarding surgery, around 92% of patients had received prior anticancer surgery for the endometrial 
cancer.  
All this considered, it can be concluded that there were no relevant differences between arms in terms of 
prior medications and prior surgery in the dMMR/MSI-H population. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The dual primary endpoints of RUBY Part 1 were PFS by investigator (in both the overall population and 
the dMMR/MSI-H population) and OS (in the overall population). Since the object of this submission is the 
dMMR/MSI-H population, the efficacy discussion is focused on this population rather than on the overall 
population. Nevertheless, OS and PFS by investigator in the overall population are considered as 
supportive data, and, as such, are also briefly discussed. It should be noted that since the only formal OS 
analysis was conducted in the overall population, for the assessment of the OS data the analysis in this 
population is of greater importance. Median follow-up in the dMMR/MSI-H population was of 24.79 
months (2 years, DCO 28-Sep-2022). 
Primary endpoints

The primary endpoint in the dMMR/MSI-H population (PFS by investigator) was met: dostarlimab in 
combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel reduced the risk of progression of death by 72% in the 
dMMR/MSI-H primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer patients (HR: 0.28; 95% CI 0.162, 
0.495; p-value <0.0001). The stopping boundary (p=0.00630) for claiming superiority of dostarlimab 
over placebo at the interim analysis was crossed. Additionally, the KM curve shows a clear benefit of 
dostarlimab over placebo, with curves separating at around the fourth month. In the dostarlimab arm 
there were 19 events observed (35.8%), vs. 47 events (72.3%) in the placebo arm. Of the events 
observed, there were 16 disease progressions (30.2%) in the dostarlimab and 44 (67.7%) in the placebo 
arm; together with 3 deaths in each arm, which accounted for the 5.7% in the dostarlimab arm and for 
the 4.6% in the placebo arm. Regarding the number of patients censored, it is noted that in the 
dostarlimab arm the number of censored patients is relevantly higher compared with the placebo arm: 34 
(64.2%) vs. 18 (27.7%) patients, respectively. Median PFS in the dostarlimab arm was not reached (95% 
CI: 11.8, NR), vs. a median PFS of approximately 7.7 (95% CI: 5.6, 9.7) months in the placebo arm.  
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted by the MAH using alternate censoring rules for PFS 
(sensitivity analysis 1 and 2), using BICR assessment instead of investigator assessment (sensitivity 
analysis 3, which was also performed as a secondary endpoint) and using stratification factors based on 
the source verified values from eCRF in the stratified log-rank test and stratified cox model to address the 
potential misclassification of randomization stratification factors (sensitivity analysis 4). Additionally, a 
post-hoc sensitivity analysis was performed based on censoring rule 3 “censored at last tumour 
assessment regardless if still on therapy or not”, as requested in the scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/3585/2/2018/II). All those sensitivity analyses showed a highly consistent effect in the 
dMMR/MSI-H population. 
PFS by investigator in the overall population (at 63% PFS maturity) was also met, with a HR of 0.64 
(95% CI 0.507, 0.800). Median PFS was 11.8 months in the dostarlimab arm, vs. 7.9 months in the 
placebo arm. The stopping boundary (p=0.02) for claiming superiority of dostarlimab over placebo was 
crossed (p<0.0001) at this interim analysis.  
Of note, updated efficacy data of PFS and the other secondary endpoints were requested, but the MAH 
stated that no additional analysis for PFS or other secondary endpoints were planned in the protocol, and, 
as such, no further data are available. 
OS in the dMMR/MSI-H population was not a primary endpoint, but a prespecified analysis was 
performed. At 26% maturity (31 events) there was a trend in favour of dostarlimab, with an HR of 0.30 
(95% CI: 0.127, 0.699; nominal p=0.0016). The KM curve shows a separation between arms at 
approximately month 7, with no arm reaching median OS. It should be noted that although the number of 
events is low (N=7 [13.2%] in the dostarlimab arm and N=24 [36.9%] in the placebo arm), and, 
therefore, no clear conclusion can be drawn from these data, it seems evident that at least at this point in 
time there is a difference between arms, discarding a potential detrimental effect of dostarlimab. Updated 
OS data with a longer follow-up (DCO: 1st March 2023) were provided during the procedure. At 30% 
maturity (35 events) a trend in favour of dostarlimab continues to be observed, with a HR of 0.33 (95% 
CI: 0.155, 0.722). These results are quite consistent with the results initially submitted, which is not 
surprising considering that only 4 additional events were included with this update. However, considering 
the low number of events, the MAH will submit the final OS analysis of study RUBY part 1 as a post 
authorisation efficacy study (PAES) by 30 June 2029. 
Regarding censored patients, for both PFS and OS analyses, no concerning data was identified when 
analysing reasons for censoring. In the same way, further assessment of intercurrent events and handling 
strategy did not reveal any concerning trend.  
OS in the overall population was one of the dual primary endpoints. At this OS (first) interim analysis at 
33% maturity (165 events) there was a trend in favour of dostarlimab, although statistical significance 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 115/156 
 
 
 
 
was not reached. HR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.464, 0.870; p=0.0021; p-value stopping boundary for 
significance = 0.00177).  
Secondary endpoints 
PFS by BICR in the dMMR/MSI-H population was consistent with PFS by investigator, with a HR of 0.29 
(95% CI 0.158, 0.543; nominal p<0.0001). Median PFS was not reached in the dostarlimab arm, vs. 9.5 
months in the placebo arm. Similarly, to the PFS by investigator’s KM curve, in this KM curve a separation 
between arms is evident, also at approximately month 4. Of note, consistence of this endpoint was of 
great importance, considering that the MAH initially designed the study with PFS by investigator as 
primary endpoint, then it was changed to PFS by BICR; and it was finally reverted to PFS by investigator.  
PFS2 results also favoured the dostarlimab arm over the placebo arm; with an HR of 0.37 (95% CI 
0.189, 0.727). Although the confidence interval is wide due to the small number of events observed (12 
in the dostarlimab arm and 32 in the placebo arm), these results are consistent with the PFS and the OS 
results, reassuring about the apparent lack of a detrimental long-term effect.  
ORR by investigator was 77.6% (95% CI: 63.4%, 88.2%) in the dostarlimab arm (38/49), vs. 69.0% 
(95% CI: 55.5%, 80.5%) in the placebo arm (40/58). In the dostarlimab arm there were 15 CRs (28.3%) 
and 23 PRs (43.4%), whereas in the placebo arm there were 12 CRs (18.5%) and 28 PRs (43.1%). 
Disease control rate (DCR) was 90.6% in the dostarlimab arm, vs. 89.2% in the placebo arm; which are 
high and pretty similar percentages. No relevant differences were observed in the analysis of tumour 
response by BICR. Median duration of response was not reached in the dostarlimab arm and was of 5.4 
(95% CI: 3.9, 8.1) months in the placebo arm.  
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) showed that patients on dostarlimab had similar quality of life than 
patients on placebo in the dMMR/MSI-H population. Although no statistical analyses were performed, it 
seems that overall results in the dostarlimab arm were similar to results in the placebo arm. This seems 
to discard a potential quality of life worsening of patients in the dostarlimab arm compared with patients 
in the placebo arm.  
Subgroup analyses 
Overall, subgroup analysis for PFS by Investigator in the dMMR/MSI-H population were generally 
consistent with the primary analysis except for the subgroup of “primary stage III” with a HR of 0.92 
(95% CI 0.260, 3.279). A similar pattern was observed in the overall population (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.563, 
1.891), with a median PFS that was particularly higher in the placebo arm (22.8 months). The MAH 
justifies these observations by stating that patients with primary stage III would require longer follow-up 
to detect a treatment difference, since they are expected to have a longer median PFS. Nevertheless, the 
number of events in this subgroup was very low and CI is wide and, therefore, no conclusions can be 
drawn. Results in subjects with evaluable disease (i.e., subjects with target or non-target lesions) and in 
subjects with measurable disease (i.e., subjects with target lesions) were consistent with the results of 
the primary analysis, both in the overall population and in the dMMR/MSI-H population.  
Subgroup analysis for OS have also been provided but in the dMMR/MSI-H population the number of 
events was so low that it is not possible to draw any conclusion.  
PDL-1 positive status (CPS ≥ 1) was slightly more frequent in dMMR/MSI-H patients than in MMRp/MSS 
patients: 76% of patients were PDL-1 positive in the dMMR/MSI-H subgroup vs. 69% in the MMRp/MSS 
subgroup. Among dMMR/MSI-H subjects PD-L1 test results were available for a total of 76 (64%) 
subjects: 35 in the dostarlimab arm and 41 in the placebo arm.  Of note, most dMMR/MSI-H subjects for 
which PD-L1 results were available were PD-L1 positive: 58 patients were PD-L1 positive, vs. 18 PD-L1 
negative.   
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 116/156 
 
 
 
 
The MAH has provided ORR and DOR data for both the PDL-1 positive and PDL-1 negative subgroups; 
but, due to the small datasize, PFS and OS data have only been provided for the PDL-1 positive subgroup. 
Notably, in the PDL-1 negative subgroup there were only 18 subjects in total: 4 in the dostarlimab arm 
and 14 in the placebo arm. Such low number of subjects impairs drawing any conclusion on potential 
differences between subgroups. PFS and OS data in the PDL-1 subgroup were similar to the results 
obtained in the dMMR/MSI-H population regardless of PDL-1 status: the HR for PFS was 0.33 (95% CI: 
0.147, 0.736; p=0.0029) and the HR for OS was 0.32 (95% CI: 0.115, 0.901; p=0.0118). It should be 
noted that ORR between the dostarlimab arm and the placebo arm were not markedly different. The 
reasons for this finding remain unclear, although no conclusions can be drawn considering the low 
number of patients. In summary, the low number of PD-L1 negative patients impairs drawing any 
conclusion on potential efficacy differences between PD-L1 positive patients and PD-L1 negative patients. 
Fulfilment of SOB-clin-002 
The MAH, with this submission, also intends to fulfil SOB-clin-002 and convert the CMA into full approval. 
SOB-clin-002:  
“In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab in adult patients with mismatch repair deficient 
(dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer (EC) that has 
progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen, the MAH should submit 
the results of the phase III, randomised, double-blind study RUBY, comparing the efficacy and safety of 
dostarlimab in combination with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in patients with recurrent or 
advanced endometrial cancer who have not received prior systemic anticancer therapy for recurrent or 
advanced disease. The CSR should be submitted by 31 August 2023.” 
The MAH has presented the results of the RUBY study, in due time. The results of this study have 
confirmed the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab in adult patients with dMMR/MSI-H recurrent or 
advanced endometrial cancer. Thus, the SOB-clin-002 can be considered fulfilled and the CMA can be 
converted into full approval. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pre-planned interim analysis of the RUBY study have shown a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS by investigator for dostarlimab in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel compared 
to chemotherapy alone in the treatment of patients with primary advanced or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H 
endometrial cancer and who are candidates for systemic therapy. The OS data at the time of the IA were 
immature (33% maturity) and, although updated OS data were provided during the procedure, data were 
still considered immature. Although there is a trend towards an OS improvement and a detrimental effect 
seems unlikely, uncertainty remains due to the immaturity of the data. Thus, to further characterise the 
efficacy of dostarlimab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, results from the final OS analysis 
will be provided by 30 June 2029 (see Annex II condition, PAES). 
As the combination treatment phrase in the initially proposed therapeutic indication (i.e. carboplatin and 
paclitaxel) does not match the treatment allowed by protocol, since only carboplatin and paclitaxel were 
used as backbone in the pivotal trial, the final indication wording was revised to accurately reflect that 
(see section 2.1.1). 
Additionally, with this submission the MAH intended to fulfil SOB-clin-002, which refers to the submission 
of the results of Ruby study. The SOB is considered fulfilled, and, as such, the CMA conversion to a full 
approval is endorsed. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy of dostarlimab in 
combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
mismatch repair deficient / microsatellite instability-high primary advanced or recurrent endometrial 
cancer and who are candidates for systemic therapy, the MAH should submit the final results of the RUBY 
study part 1. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
This report describes safety data from an interim analysis of Part 1 of the dostarlimab Study 213361, 
referred to as RUBY (also known as Study 4010-03-001; ENGOT EN-6; GOG-3031) with a data cut-off 
date of 28 September 2022.  
The Safety Analysis Set includes all participants who received any amount of study treatment regardless 
of randomization. All safety analyses were performed on the as treated principle, where participants were 
allocated to the treatment that they actually received. Participants who received any amount of 
dostarlimab were assigned to the dostarlimab treatment arm, and participants who did not receive any 
amount of dostarlimab were assigned to the placebo treatment arm.  
The safety analyses were based on the Safety Analysis Set (overall population, all comers) and the 
dMMR/MSI-H subset of the Safety Analysis Set. 
Patient exposure 
As of the data cut-off date, 241 participants had received treatment with dostarlimab in combination with 
carboplatin-paclitaxel and 246 participants had received treatment with placebo in combination with 
carboplatin-paclitaxel and were included in the Safety Analysis Set. The Safety Analysis Set included 
participants who were stratified as dMMR/MSI-H (117 participants) or MMRp/MSS (370 participants). 
Within the dMMR/MSI-H safety population, there were 52 participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm and 65 participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
The overall median treatment duration was 43.00 weeks (range: 3.0 to 150.9 weeks) for participants in 
the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 36.00 weeks (range: 2.1 to 165.1 weeks) for 
participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (Table 71). The median treatment duration of 
both carboplatin and paclitaxel was 18.00 weeks (range: 3.0 to 27.1 weeks) for participants in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 18.00 weeks for participants in the placebo plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (range: 2.1 to 28.1 weeks).  
The median number of actual dosing cycles was 6.0 for carboplatin and for paclitaxel in both treatment 
arms.

Intervals were inclusive of the upper week number, e.g., Week 1 to ≤Week 3 was equivalent to Day 1 to Day 21 (inclusive). 
Overall duration of treatment was calculated as follows: If no ≥Cycle 7 non-zero dose was infused: minimum of (Last dose date – 
Start dose date + 21) and (Death date – Start dose date + 1). If at least 1 ≥Cycle 7 non-zero dose was infused: minimum of 
(Last dose date – Start dose date + 42) and (Death date – Start dose date + 1). 
Carboplatin and paclitaxel were only administered in the first 6 cycles of study treatment. 
dMMR/MSI-H population 
The overall median treatment duration was 76.50 weeks (range: 3.0 to 150.3 weeks) for participants in 
the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 31.86 weeks (range: 3.0 to 153.0 weeks) for 
participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (Table 72). 
The median RDI for carboplatin was 88.07% in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, and 
83.37% in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (Table 72). The median RDI for paclitaxel was 
95.25% in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 95.69% in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm (Table 72). The median number of actual dosing cycles was 6.0 for carboplatin and for 
paclitaxel in both treatment arms.

Overall population 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (>40%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were 
nausea, alopecia, fatigue, and neuropathy peripheral, while those in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm included fatigue, alopecia, nausea, anemia, and neuropathy peripheral. These common 
TEAEs were maximal Grade 1 or 2 in severity in most participants for whom the TEAEs were reported, 
with the exception of anemia, which was Grade 2 or 3 in most participants with anemia.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Overall population 
A total of 5 participants overall (1.0%) had a TEAE leading to death. All of these deaths were in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (Table 81 and Table 82). Two participants died from 
treatment-related TEAEs: the death due to myelosuppression was assessed by the investigator as related 
to dostarlimab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, and the death due to hypovolemic shock was assessed by the 
investigator as related to dostarlimab. 
Three participants who received dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel died due to an overdose of 
opiates, COVID-19, and general physical health deterioration each; none were considered treatment 
related. 
dMMR/MSI-H population 
A total of 2 participants (1.7%) in the dMMR/MSI-H EC population, both in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, had a TEAE leading to death: myelosuppression was considered related to 
dostarlimab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, and hypovolemic shock was considered related to dostarlimab.

Infusion-related Reactions 
Overall population 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023

In the overall population, IRRs were comparable between treatment arms and were reported in 18.3% 
of participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and in 19.9% of participants in the 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (Table 73). The incidence of IRRs related to dostarlimab or 
placebo was low and comparable between the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (5 participants 
[2.1%]) and the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (2 participants [0.8%]). Serious IRRs, IRRs of 
Grade ≥3 severity, or IRRs leading to infusion delay or discontinuation related to any study treatment 
occurred in <3% of participants in either treatment arm. No IRRs led to death in any arm. 
The incidence of IRRs related to carboplatin was comparable between the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm (14 participants [5.8%]) and the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (15 participants 
[6.1%]).The incidence of IRRs related to paclitaxel was comparable between the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (31 participants [12.9%]) and the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (38 
participants [15.4%]). 
dMMR/MSI-H population 
In the dMMR/MSI-H population IRRs were comparable between treatment arms, reported in 23.1% of 
participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and in 20.0% of participants in the 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (Table 74). No IRRs related to dostarlimab or placebo were 
reported in the dMMR/MSI-H EC population. IRRs related to carboplatin were higher in the dostarlimab 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (4 participants [7.7%]) compared to the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm (1 participant [1.5%]). IRRs related to paclitaxel were comparable in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (8 participants [15.4%]) and the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (12 
participants [18.5%]). 
Covid-19-related adverse events 
Overall population 
In the overall population, COVID-19 adverse events were comparable between treatment arms (<10% 
difference) (Table 89). While all COVID-19 SAEs, COVID-19 AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, 
COVID-19 Grade ≥3 AEs, and COVID-19 AEs leading to death occurred in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, these incidences remain small (approximately 1% of participants) and are 
considered to have been incidental and unlikely driven by the treatment received.

Laboratory findings 
Hematology 
Overall population 
In the overall population, baseline hematology results were generally Grade 0 (>95% of participants) in 
both treatment arms, with the exception of hemoglobin decreased (Grade 0: 56.4% in dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin paclitaxel arm, 63.4% in placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm) and lymphocyte count 
decreased (Grade 0: 71.8% in dostarlimab plus carboplatin paclitaxel arm, 71.1% in placebo plus 
carboplatin paclitaxel arm). Three participants (2 in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin paclitaxel arm, 1 in 
the placebo plus carboplatin paclitaxel arm) had Grade 4 white blood cell decreased at baseline and as 
maximum postbaseline value.  
Shifts to Grade 3 or 4 hematology parameters of >2 grades from baseline to maximum postbaseline 
value in the overall population were most frequently (>10%) reported in participants in the dostarlimab 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm for neutrophil count decreased (13.7%) and white blood cell count 
decreased (10.7%), and in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm for neutrophil count decreased 
(17.9%). 
dMMR/MSI-H population 
In the dMMR/MSI-H EC population, baseline hematology results were generally Grade 0 (>95% of 
participants) in both treatment arms, with the exception of hemoglobin decreased (Grade 0: 48.1% in 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin paclitaxel arm, 56.9% in placebo plus carboplatin paclitaxel arm) and 
lymphocyte count decreased (Grade 0: 75.0% in dostarlimab plus carboplatin paclitaxel arm, 72.3% in 
placebo plus carboplatin paclitaxel arm). 
Shifts to Grade 3 or 4 hematology parameters of >2 grades from baseline to maximum postbaseline 
value in the dMMR/MSI-H population were most frequently (>10%) reported in participants in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm for neutrophil count decreased (15.4%), and in the placebo 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm for neutrophil count decreased (23.1%), white blood cell count decreased 
(12.4%), platelet count decreased (12.3%), and lymphocyte count decreased (10.8%). 
Clinical Chemistry 
Overall population 
In the overall population, baseline chemistry results were generally Grade 0 (>80% of participants) in 
either treatment arm. For hyperglycemia, the Grade 0 incidence was 50.2% in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin paclitaxel arm and 47.6% in the placebo plus carboplatin paclitaxel arm. Baseline Grade 4 
chemistry results were only reported for hypoglycemia (1 participant in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin 
paclitaxel arm and 2 participants in placebo plus carboplatin paclitaxel arm); Grade 4 results were also 
reported as maximum postbaseline values for these participants. 
Shifts to Grade 3 or 4 chemistry parameters of >2 grades from baseline to maximum postbaseline value 
were generally infrequent. No shifts to Grade 4 chemistry parameters occurred in >2% of the 
participants.  
dMMR/MSI-H population 
In the dMMR/MSI-H population, baseline chemistry results were generally Grade 0 (>80% of participants) 
in either treatment arm, with the exception of hyperglycemia, where the incidence was similar in both 
arms (hyperglycemia: dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 51.9%, placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm 46.2%). Results for shifts from baseline for chemistry parameters were generally similar in

the dMMR/MSI-H EC population. In the dMMR/MSI-H EC population, no participants had Grade 4 
chemistry results at baseline. 
Liver-related Assessments 
Overall population 
The incidence of potential liver toxicity events is summarized in Table 90. No participant with primary 
advanced or recurrent EC met the criteria for potential Hy’s law (concurrent AST or ALT ≥3×ULN, in 
combination with bilirubin ≥2×ULN and ALP <2×ULN or missing). The toxicity criterion with the greatest 
difference in frequency between treatment arms was (ALT or AST) ≥3×ULN; 10.4% and 2.8% in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, respectively 
(Table 90).

were <65 years, 88 (36.5%) were 65 to <75 years, and 27 (11.2%) were 75 years or older; in the 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, 112 (45.5%) of participants were <65 years, 97 (39.4%) were 
65 to <75 years, and 37 (15.0%) were 75 years or older including 1 participant who was 85 years of age. 
Overall, key safety risks were not observed to be significantly increased in older participants compared to 
younger participants in participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, and in comparison 
to participants receiving only chemotherapy in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
The incidences of TEAEs and any treatment-related TEAEs were similar (>95%) between all age groups in 
each arm. The incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs was similar between participants aged <65 years and 65 to 
<75 years in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (~70%), and between participants aged <65 
years and 65 to <75 years in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (~57% each group), with Grade 
≥3 TEAEs higher in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared to the placebo plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. Grade ≥3 TEAEs were higher in participants aged ≥75 years in both arms (78% 
dostarlimab and 75% placebo, respectively). A similar pattern was observed with treatment-related 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs, with approximately 5% higher incidence in each age group in participants in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared to the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
The incidence of SAEs and any treatment-related SAEs was similar between all age groups in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (~40% SAEs, ~23% treatment-related SAEs), and between

participants aged <65 years and 65 to <75 years in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (~23% 
SAEs, ~8% treatment-related SAEs), and which were higher in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel 
arm compared to the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. SAEs (51%) and any treatment-related 
SAEs (43%) were higher in participants aged ≥75 years in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
TEAEs with outcome of death were 3.2% (n=4) in the <65-year group, including 2 deaths related to 
study treatment, and 1.1% in the 65 to <75-year group in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel 
arm; no other deaths due to TEAEs were reported in the study.  
The incidence of TEAEs leading to infusion delay was similar between all age groups in each arm, ranging 
from 34% to 48%. The incidence of TEAEs leading to dose reduction of carboplatin and/or paclitaxel was 
similar between all age groups in each arm, ranging from 22% to 33%, with the exception of dose 
reductions for participants aged ≥75 years in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (49%). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation was lower in participants aged <65 years in 
the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (19%), and those aged <65 years (15%) and 65 to <75 
years (12%) in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, compared to those aged 65 to <75 years <65 
(28%) and ≥75 years (30%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and aged ≥75 years in the 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (33%). 
The incidence of dostarlimab/placebo-related irAEs was similar between participants aged <65 years and 
65 to <75 years in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (33% to 39%), and between 
participants aged <65 years and 65 to <75 years (13% to 14%) in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel 
arm, with dostarlimab/placebo-related irAEs higher in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
compared to the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm for these age groups. Dostarlimab/placebo-
related irAEs were higher in participants aged ≥75 years in both arms (52% dostarlimab and 25% 
placebo, respectively). 
Ethnicity 
There were 15 participants in total of the 487 participants in the Safety Analysis Set who were Hispanic or 
Latino; 7 were in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 8 were in the placebo plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. Due to the small number of participants who were Hispanic or Latino, a 
meaningful comparison based on ethnicity could not be made. 
Race 
In the overall population, in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, 7 (2.9%) participants were 
Asian, 27 (11.2%) were Black or African American, and 187 (77.6%) were White with the remainder 
Other; in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, 8 (3.3%) participants were Asian, 31 (12.6%) were 
Black or African American, and 190 (77.2%) were White with the remainder Other. Overall, based on 
limited data, safety risks were not observed to be significantly increased in Black or African American 
participants compared to White participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. Due to the 
small number of participants who were Asian a meaningful comparison to safety in Black/African 
American and White participants could not be made. 
The incidences of TEAEs and any treatment-related TEAEs were similar (>95%) between Black/African 
American and White participants in each arm. The incidences were similar between Black/African 
American and White participants for Grade ≥3 TEAEs (67% and 70%, respectively) and treatment-related 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs (44% and 52%, respectively) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm; in the 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm incidences were higher in White participants compared to 
Black/African American participants for Grade ≥3 TEAEs (62% and 52%, respectively) and treatment-
related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (49% and 29%, respectively). The incidences of other parameters were too low 
for meaningful comparison.

BMI 
In the overall population, in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, 2 (0.8%) participants were 
underweight, 47 (19.5%) were of normal weight, 62 (25.7%) were overweight and 129 (53.5%) were 
obese; in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, 5 (0.2%) participants were underweight, 44 
(17.9%) were of normal weight, 51 (20.7%) were overweight and 146 (59.3%) were obese. Due to the 
small number of participants with an underweight BMI, a meaningful comparison could not be made with 
other BMI categories. Overall, safety risks were not observed to be significantly increased between 
participants with normal, overweight or obese BMIs in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
The incidence of TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs by BMI were similar (>90%) in participants with 
normal BMI (≥18.5 to <25 kg/m2), overweight BMI (≥25 to 30 kg/m2), and obese BMI (≥30 kg/m2) in 
each arm. The incidences of Grade ≥3 TEAEs in participants with normal, overweight or obese BMIs were 
similar within the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (range 66% to 73%) and within the placebo 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (range 57% to 64%); these ranges were higher in participants in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared to the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
Treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs were similar within the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
(range 43% to 55%) and within the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (range 43% to 57%) and 
were similar between arms.  
The incidence of SAEs in participants with normal, overweight or obese BMIs were similar within the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (range 34% to 42%) and within the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm (range 25% to 31%); these ranges were higher in participants in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared with the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. The incidences of 
infusion delays were similar between normal, overweight and obese BMIs within each treatment arm 
(dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel range 42% to 55%; placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel range 
38% to 41%). Dose reductions of chemotherapy were lower in participants with normal BMI in both 
treatment arms (~15%) compared to participants with overweight or obese BMIs (28% to 32%). The 
incidences of participants with TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuations were similar within and 
between treatment arms (14% to 23%) with the exception of normal BMI participants in the dostarlimab 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (32%). The incidence of dostarlimab/placebo-related irAEs in participants 
with normal or overweight BMIs within the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (43% and 50%, 
respectively) were higher than in obese participants (30%). The incidences of other parameters were too 
low for meaningful comparison. 
Baseline kidney function 
Kidney function was defined as normal for CrCl ≥90 mL/min, mildly impaired for CrCl <90 to ≥60 mL/min, 
moderately impaired for CrCl <60 to ≥30 mL/min, and as severely impaired for CrCl <30 mL/min.  
In the overall population, in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, 118 (49.0%) participants 
had normal baseline kidney function, 94 (39.0%) participants had mildly impaired baseline kidney 
function, 28 (11.6%) participants had moderately impaired baseline kidney function and 1 (0.4%) 
participant had severely impaired baseline kidney function; in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, 
126 (51.2%) participants had normal baseline kidney function, 91 (37.8%) participants had mildly 
impaired baseline kidney function, 29 (11.8%) participants had moderately impaired baseline kidney 
function and none had severely impaired baseline kidney function. Due to the small number of 
participants with severely impaired baseline kidney function, a meaningful comparison could not be made 
with other categories. Overall safety risks were not observed to be significantly increased between 
participants with normal, mildly impaired or moderately impaired baseline kidney function in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm.

The incidences of TEAEs and any treatment-related TEAEs were similar (>95%) between participants with 
normal, mildly impaired and moderately impaired baseline kidney function in each arm. The incidences 
were similar between participants with normal, mildly impaired, and moderately impaired baseline kidney 
function for Grade ≥3 TEAEs (range 65% to 75%) and treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (range 50% to 
61%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm; in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
incidences were higher in participants with moderately impaired baseline kidney function for Grade ≥3 
TEAEs (76%) compared to those with normal (56%) or mildly impaired (60%) baseline kidney function, 
with similar treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs (range 44% to 55%). Other parameters (SAEs, treatment-
related SAEs, TEAEs leading to infusion interruption/delay, TEAEs leading to chemotherapy dose 
reduction, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation) were similar with <10% differences between 
participants with normal or mildly impaired baseline kidney function within each arm. The incidences of 
other parameters were too low for participants with moderately impaired baseline kidney function for 
meaningful comparison. 
Baseline hepatic function 
Hepatic function was defined based on the maximum CTCAE grade for ALT or AST at baseline (normal = 
Grade 0 to 1, mildly impaired = Grade 2, moderately impaired = Grade 3, severely impaired = Grade 4).  
There were only 3 participants in each treatment arm with a mildly impaired baseline hepatic function, 
with no participants in either treatment arm with moderately or severely impaired baseline hepatic 
function. Due to the small number of participants with an impaired baseline hepatic function, a 
meaningful comparison based on baseline hepatic function could not be made. 
Extrinsic factors 
Geographic region 
In the overall population, in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, 169 (70.1%) participants 
were from North America and 57 (23.7%) were from Western Europe; in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm, 186 (75.6%) participants were from North America and 46 (18.7%) were from Western 
Europe. There were only 29 participants in total from Eastern Europe, therefore, a meaningful comparison 
based on geographic region could not be made with the other region categories. Overall safety risks were 
not observed to be significantly increased between participants from North America and Western Europe 
in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
The incidences of participants with TEAEs, any treatment-related TEAEs, Grade ≥3 TEAEs, treatment-
related Grade ≥3 TEAEs, TEAEs leading to chemotherapy dose reduction, TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation and dostarlimab-related irAEs were generally similar in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm between North America and Western Europe. SAEs were higher in participants from 
Western Europe (49%) as compared to North America (34%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm; Grade ≥3 TEAEs were higher in participants from Western Europe (74%) as compared to 
North America (56%) in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. The incidences of other parameters 
were too low for meaningful comparison. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No dedicated drug interaction studies have been conducted. mAbs such as dostarlimab are not substrates 
for CYP or drug transporters. Dostarlimab is not a cytokine and is unlikely to be a cytokine modulator. 
Additionally, PK drug interaction of dostarlimab with small molecule drugs is not expected. There is no 
evidence of drug interaction mediated by nonspecific clearance of lysosome degradation for antibodies.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall population 
In the overall population, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of any study treatment were experienced by 
23.7% of participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared with 16.7% in the 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. The incidence in individual system organ class and TEAEs by 
preferred term were similar (<3% difference) between treatment arms. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation (≥2.0% of participants in either arm) were peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (2.9% dostarlimab versus 0.4% placebo) and infusion-related reaction (2.1% versus 3.3%) in 
the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, and infusion-related reaction, neuropathy peripheral 
(1.2% versus 2.4%), and thrombocytopenia (0.4% versus 2.0%) in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm. 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of dostarlimab or placebo were higher in participants in the dostarlimab 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (17.4%) compared with the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
(9.3%). The majority of discontinuations in both treatment arms occurred during the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel phase (25 of 42 participants) or placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel phase (17 of 23 
participants) rather than the dostarlimab/placebo maintenance phase. Individual system organ classes 
and TEAE by preferred term incidences were comparable (<3% difference) between treatment arms 
(Table 92. TEAEs leading to discontinuation of dostarlimab or placebo in both treatment arms occurred in 
≤2 participants each, with the exception of rash maculo-papular (1.2% in dostarlimab plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm, 0% in placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm), infusion-related reaction (1.2% versus 
0.4%), and thrombocytopenia (0.4% versus 1.2%).

TEAEs leading to study drug infusion delay 
Overall population 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to delays of infusion of any drug component of study treatment was 
45.2% in participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared with 39.4% in 
participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs (>5%) 
leading to delays of infusion were thrombocytopenia (7.5% dostarlimab versus 5.7% placebo), 
neuropathy peripheral (5.8% versus 2.0%), and anemia (5.4% versus 6.1%) in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, and platelet count decreased (5.0% versus 7.3%), neutrophil count decreased 
(1.2% versus 6.5%), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia (3.3% versus 5.3%) in the placebo 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to delays of dostarlimab/placebo infusion was 42.7% in participants in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared with 37.0% in participants in the placebo plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. However, no notable differences were observed in system organ classes or 
preferred terms between treatment arms. The most frequently reported TEAEs (>5%) leading to delays 
of dostarlimab/placebo infusion in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were thrombocytopenia 
(7.1% versus 5.3%) and anemia (5.4% versus 6.1%), and in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
were platelet count decreased (4.1% versus 7.3%), neutrophil count decreased (1.2% versus 6.1%), 
anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia (3.3% versus 5.3%). 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to delays of carboplatin infusion was 28.6% for participants in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 30.1% for participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs (>4%) leading to delays of carboplatin infusion in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were thrombocytopenia (4.6% versus 4.5%) and neuropathy 
peripheral (4.6% versus 1.6%), and platelet count decreased (3.7% versus 5.7%), neutrophil count 
decreased (1.2% versus 5.3%), anemia (3.7% versus 4.9%), thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia (2.9% 
versus 4.5%) in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to delays of paclitaxel infusion was 27.4% for participants in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 27.2% for participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs (>4%) leading to delays of paclitaxel infusion in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were thrombocytopenia (4.6% versus 4.9%) and platelet 
count decreased (4.1% versus 6.5%), and thrombocytopenia, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count 
decreased (1.2% versus 4.5%), and anemia (3.3% versus 4.5%) in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm. 
dMMR/MSI-H population 
In the dMMR/MSI-H EC population, the incidence of TEAEs leading to delays of any drug component of 
any study treatment was comparable between the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (46.2%) 
and the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (43.1%). No notable differences (>10%) were observed 
in the incidence of TEAEs between treatment arms. The most frequently reported TEAEs (>5%) leading to 
delays of infusion were anemia (7.7% versus 9.2%), thrombocytopenia (7.7% versus 9.2%), and platelet 
count decreased (7.7% each) in both treatment arms, as well as neuropathy peripheral (5.8% versus 
4.6%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and neutropenia (1.9% versus 6.2%) in the 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to delays of dostarlimab or placebo infusion was 44.2% for participants in 
the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 41.5% for participants in the placebo plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. With the exception of neuropathy peripheral, the most frequently reported 
TEAEs (>5%) leading to delays of dostarlimab or placebo infusion were the same as those observed for 
the delay of any study treatment described above.

respectively). The most frequently reported TEAEs (>4%) leading to delays of paclitaxel infusion were 
thrombocytopenia (5.8% versus 9.2%) and platelet count decreased (5.8% versus 7.7%) in both 
treatment arms, and neutropenia (1.9% versus 4.6%), anemia (5.8% versus 4.6%), and neuropathy 
peripheral (0% versus 4.6%) in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
Adverse Drug Reactions 
A 2-step, holistic approach was utilized to review TEAEs from all participants in RUBY Part 1 for the 
identification of dostarlimab ADRs. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation and TEAEs leading to 
death were also evaluated, but these occurred in relatively few participants and were of limited value in 
the assessment of ADRs. 
Adverse drug reactions for dostarlimab in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel 
ADRs for the CCDS have been identified based on data from all participants who received dostarlimab 
plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (N=241) in comparison with participants receiving placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel (N=246) using a data cutoff date of 28 September 2022. Final identification of ADRs (Table 93) 
is based on the overall quantitative analysis and the qualitative assessment. 
The majority of the ADRs for dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel (Table 93 were previously identified 
as ADRs for dostarlimab monotherapy as 2L+ in participants with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. 
New terms included as ADRs for dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel based on data from RUBY Part 1 
are: 
• 
Immune-mediated hypothyroidism: immune-mediated hypothyroidism was identified in 1 
participant in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, considered related to dostarlimab 
by the investigator, with laboratory data and treatment consistent with hypothyroidism. 
Hypothyroidism was also identified as an ADR for dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel based 
on quantitative analysis of RUBY Part 1 data.  
•  Dry skin met the quantitative screening criteria. Approximately one-half of the TEAEs of dry skin 
occurring in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were considered related to 
dostarlimab, as well as carboplatin or paclitaxel, by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported ADRs (≥10% of participants) in participants receiving dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel are rash (22.8%), rash maculo-papular (14.1%), hypothyroidism (14.1%), alanine 
aminotransferase increased (12.9%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (12.0%), pyrexia (12.0%), 
and dry skin (10.4%) (Table 93.  
Based on the dostarlimab mechanism of action, following medical review, immune-mediated AEs with 
incidence <10% were identified as ADRs including hyperthyroidism (4.1%), pneumonitis (2.1%), colitis 
(1.2%), adrenal insufficiency (1.2%), pancreatitis (0.8%), immune-mediated hypothyroidism (0.4%), 
thyroiditis (0.4%), immune-mediated arthritis (0.4%), myocarditis (0.4%), Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(0.4%), and uveitis (0.4%) (Table 93). 
AEs that met the quantitative criteria and which were not considered to be causally attributable to 
dostarlimab in the CCDS include hypertension, blood creatinine increased, hypoesthesia,

hypoalbuminemia, toothache, hypocalcemia, and sepsis. These events were excluded as ADRs based on 
the relatively low frequency considered related to dostarlimab by the investigator, lack of biological 
plausibility, and/or for AEs with vital signs/laboratory analyses (hypertension, blood creatinine increased, 
hypoalbuminemia, and hypocalcemia), the comparable data between the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel and placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arms. Additional potentially immune-related AEs were 
not identified as ADRs following medical review as they were not considered to be causally attributable to 
dostarlimab by the investigator or sponsor (infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction; Raynaud’s 
phenomenon; iritis), laboratory data for diagnosis was not provided (immune-mediated adrenal 
insufficiency; immune-mediated hypophysitis), or was confounded by long-term ibuprofen use (colitis 
microscopic).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The current safety assessment for dostarlimab, in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel is based on the 
results from an interim analysis from Part 1 of the dostarlimab Study 213361, referred to as RUBY, with a 
data cut-off date of 28 September 2022. RUBY Part 1 enrolled participants with primary advanced (Stage 
III or IV) or recurrent EC who were randomized 1:1 to receive dostarlimab in combination with 
carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by dostarlimab or placebo in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel 
followed by placebo. Treatment ended after 3 years, progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, investigator’s decision, or death, whichever occurred first. The Safety Analysis Set 
Assessment report  
EMA/483641/2023 
Page 145/156 
 
 
 
 
(n=487) includes all participants who received any amount of study treatment regardless of 
randomization. 
As of the data cut-off date, 241 participants had received treatment with dostarlimab in combination with 
carboplatin-paclitaxel and 246 participants had received treatment with placebo in combination with 
carboplatin-paclitaxel. Within the dMMR/MSI-H safety population (n=117), there were 52 participants in 
the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 65 participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm. 
The median number of actual dosing cycles was 10.0 in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
and 9.0 in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. The overall median treatment duration was 43.00 
weeks (range: 3.0 to 150.9 weeks) for participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 
36.00 weeks (range: 2.1 to 165.1 weeks) for participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
The median treatment duration of both carboplatin and paclitaxel was 18.00 weeks in both arms. For the 
dMMR/MSI-H population, the overall median treatment duration was 76.50 weeks (range: 3.0 to 150.3 
weeks) for participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 31.86 weeks (range: 3.0 to 
153.0 weeks) for participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
Overall, baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment arms, with no clinically 
meaningful differences for the safety assessment. 
All participants in both treatment arms experienced at least 1 TEAE (100%). Incidences of participants 
experiencing Grade ≥3 TEAEs and SAEs were higher in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
compared with the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (70.5% versus 59.8%, respectively and 37.8% 
versus 27.6%, respectively). For the dMMR/MSI-H population, all parameters were comparable (≤10% 
difference between the treatment arms) with the exception of participants experiencing immune-related 
TEAEs (73.1% dostarlimab versus 36.9% placebo). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (>40%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were 
nausea, alopecia, fatigue, and neuropathy peripheral, while those in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm included fatigue, alopecia, nausea, anemia, and neuropathy peripheral. Overall, incidences 
of TEAEs were comparable between participants in the 2 treatment arms (≤10% difference), with the 
exception of rash maculo-papular (14.1% in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared 
with 3.7% in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm). The frequency of treatment-related TEAEs was 
comparable between the treatment arms (97.9% in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel and 
98.8% in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arms). The most frequently reported TEAEs related to 
any study treatment (>40%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were alopecia, fatigue, 
nausea, and neuropathy peripheral, while those in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm included 
alopecia, fatigue, and nausea. The incidences of TEAEs were comparable between the treatment arms 
with frequency differences of <10%. The incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was higher in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm versus the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm in the 
system organ classes of Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (27.4% and 11.8%, respectively) 
primarily driven by TEAEs of rash and rash maculo-papular, and Endocrine disorders (16.6% and 5.7%, 
respectively) mainly driven by hypothyroidism. For the dMMR/MSI-H EC population, at least 50% of 
subjects in both treatment arms had alopecia and fatigue, while the incidence of nausea was 55.8% in 
the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, and anemia was 52.3% in the placebo plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs (>40%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel 
arm were nausea (55.8%), alopecia (55.8%), fatigue (50.0%), neuropathy peripheral (42.3%), arthralgia 
(42.3%), and diarrhea (40.4%), while those in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm included 
alopecia (60.0%), fatigue (55.4%), anemia (52.3%), nausea (46.2%), and neuropathy peripheral 
(43.1%). The following TEAEs were higher in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared 
with the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm: rash (28.8% dostarlimab versus 15.4% placebo),

hypertension (21.2% versus 10.8%), hypothyroidism (21.2% versus 6.2%), rash maculo-papular (13.5% 
versus 3.1%), and pyrexia (13.5% versus 1.5%). 
A total of 65.1% of all participants experienced a Grade ≥3 TEAE. The most frequently reported 
treatment-related Grade ≥3 TEAEs in both treatment arms were anemia, neutropenia, and neutrophil 
count decreased. In the dMMR/MSI H EC population, the most frequently reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs were 
neutropenia (17.3% dostarlimab versus 12.3% placebo), anemia (15.4% versus 21.5%), neutrophil 
count decreased (7.7% versus 18.5%), and white blood cell decreased (3.8% versus 12.3%). 
Regarding deaths, in the overall population, 165 participants died while on study: 65 participants (27.0%) 
in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 100 participants (40.7%) in the placebo plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, disease progression being the most common cause of death (23.7% 
dostarlimab, 35.4% placebo). A total of 5 participants overall (1.0%) had a TEAE leading to death; 2 
were in the dMMR/MSI H EC population. All of these deaths were reported in patients from the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. Two participants died from treatment-related TEAEs: these 
deaths were due to myelosuppression and hypovolemic shock (both in the dMMR/MSI-H population). 
Three participants who received dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel died due to an overdose of 
opiates, COVID-19, and general physical health deterioration each (considered as not related to 
treatment). 
In the overall population, 32.6% of the participants presented SAEs. The most frequently reported SAEs 
in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and pyrexia, while 
those in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were anemia and asthenia. Treatment-related SAEs 
were experienced by 15.2% of the participants. The most frequently reported treatment-related SAEs 
(>1%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were febrile neutropenia (1.7%), and pyrexia, 
sepsis, and muscular weakness (1.2% each), and in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were 
anemia (2.0%), febrile neutropenia (1.6%), asthenia (1.6%), and diarrhea (1.2%). In the dMMR/MSI-H 
EC population, the overall incidence of SAEs was 26.9% in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm 
and 30.8% in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. 
Focusing on treatment modifications, dostarlimab or placebo dose reductions were not permitted but 
dostarlimab or placebo treatment could be interrupted or discontinued due to toxicity. In the overall 
population, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of any study treatment were experienced by 23.7% of 
participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm compared with 16.7% in the placebo plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation were peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (2.9% dostarlimab versus 0.4% placebo) and infusion-related reaction (2.1% versus 
3.3%) in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, and infusion-related reaction, neuropathy 
peripheral (1.2% versus 2.4%), and thrombocytopenia (0.4% versus 2.0%) in the placebo plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. In the dMMR/MSI H EC population, TEAEs leading to discontinuation of any 
study treatment were comparable between the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (17.3%) and 
the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm (16.9%). 
Considering dostarlimab mechanism of action, immune-related AEs were reported by 56.8% of patients in 
the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 35.8% in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel. A 
total of 38.2% of participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, and 15.4% of 
participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm had irAEs assessed by the investigator as 
related to dostarlimab or placebo. The most frequently observed dostarlimab-related irAEs (≥5% of 
participants) were hypothyroidism, rash, arthralgia, and alanine aminotransferase increased; all but 
arthralgia were higher in incidence in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. Grade ≥3 irAEs 
were observed in 16.6% of participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and in 6.1% of 
participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, while dostarlimab/placebo-related Grade ≥3 
irAEs were observed in 12.4% of participants in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and in 
Assessment report

3.3% of participants in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. The most frequently observed 
dostarlimab-related Grade ≥3 irAEs in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm were rash (3.7%), 
rash maculo-papular, alanine aminotransferase increased, and aspartate aminotransferase increased 
(2.1% each). In the dMMR/MSI-H EC population, 73.1% of participants in the dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel arm and 36.9% in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm reported an irAE and 
a total of 48.1% of patients in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, and 12.3% of participants 
in the placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm, had irAEs assessed by the investigator as related to 
dostarlimab / placebo, being endocrinopathies (23.1% versus 4.6%) and immune-mediated skin adverse 
reactions (15.4% dostarlimab versus 0% placebo) the most common categories among them. Two cases 
of serious irAEs were reported in the dostarlimab plus paclitaxel-carboplatin group (type 1 diabetes 
mellitus and pancreatitis) and one in the placebo plus paclitaxel-carboplatin treatment arm (colitis). 
Infusion-related reactions were reported with similar incidences in both treatment arms, suggesting that 
they may be related to chemotherapy infusion rather than dostarlimab, as expected. 
ADR identification was done primarily based on a frequentist approach and then a qualitative assessment 
by medical review including causality analyses. Most of the indentified ADRs had been previously included 
in the PI based on data from patients treated in 2L EC and other solid tumours but two ADRs have been 
identified in this RUBY Part 1 study: immune-mediated hypothyroidism and dry skin. According to the 
MAH, additional potentially immune-related AEs were not identified as ADRs following medical review as 
they were not considered to be causally attributable to dostarlimab by the investigator or sponsor 
(infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction; Raynaud’s phenomenon; iritis), laboratory data for diagnosis 
was not provided (immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency; immune-mediated hypophysitis), or was 
confounded by long-term ibuprofen use (colitis microscopic). Some clarifications were provided regarding 
these events but, considering the low incidence and the general recommendation in place to monitor 
suspected immune-mediated adverse events for this kind of products, no further measures were 
considered needed at this stage. 
Regarding laboratory assessments, potential liver toxicity events were significantly higher in the 
dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment arm. However, none of these events were considered 
clinically relevant. 
Safety in special populations was also assessed. In the dostarlimab + chemo arm, 88 (36.5%) patients 
were 65 to <75 years, and 27 (11.2%) were 75 years or older while in the chemo arm, these figures 
were 97 (39.4%) participants of 65 to <75 years, and 37 (15.0%) of 75 years or older. A trend towards 
higher incidences of Grade ≥3 TEAEs and SAEs in elderly patients was observed in both arms. Between 
arms, as expected, slightly higher incidences of events were reported in the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-
paclitaxel treatment arm but the differences regarding the age ranges are not considered clinically 
relevant. For TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, again, higher incidences were observed in 
patients ≥75 but the difference between age ranges were similar in both treatment arms. For other 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors, no relevant differences were observed. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of dostarlimab, in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel, in the target indication has 
been assessed based on the results from RUBY study, which provides comparative safety data, based on 
a larger dataset, for dostarlimab. Overall, no new risks have been identified, confirming the toxicity 
profile that was observed for the initial authorization. As expected, higher incidences of TEAEs have been 
reported for the combination and typical chemotherapy-related events have been observed. Identified 
ADRs for dostarlimab in combination treatment have been added to the PI. Once again, considering the 
Assessment report

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
JEMPERLI is indicated in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for the treatment of adult patients 
with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/ microsatellite instability high (MSI H) primary advanced or 
recurrent endometrial cancer (EC) and who are candidates for systemic therapy.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is no approved treatment in the first-line setting for primary advanced or recurrent EC, but 
carboplatin-paclitaxel is considered as standard of care regardless of MMR/MSI status. Although cisplatin-
paclitaxel in combination with doxorubicin has a similar efficacy to carboplatin-paclitaxel, it is not 
commonly used due to the higher toxicity observed with this regimen. Based on the results of the 
landmark GOG 209 study, carboplatin-paclitaxel is the preferred regimen for systemic therapy in the first-
line setting for patients with primary advanced or recurrent EC. Hormone therapy may be an option for 
patients with advanced or recurrent EC and endometrioid histology and has demonstrated a favourable 
toxicity profile. Patients with Grade 1 to 2 endometrioid tumours and those with hormone receptor-
positive disease are most likely to experience clinical benefit from hormone therapy (see 2.1.1). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current application is based on the results from the first interim analysis of the Part 1 of Study RUBY. 
The study RUBY is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study comparing dostarlimab plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel versus placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel in patients with primary advanced or 
recurrent endometrial cancer and who are candidates for systemic therapy. Part 1 of the study is to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with dostarlimab (500 mg IV every 3 weeks – 6 cycles) plus 
carboplatin-paclitaxel, followed by dostarlimab (1000 mg IV every 6 weeks; up to 3 years) versus 
treatment with placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by placebo in participants with primary 
advanced (Stage III or IV) or recurrent EC. The dual primary endpoints were PFS by investigator (in both 
the overall population and the dMMR/MSI-H population) and OS (in the overall population). OS data were 
not formally tested in the dMMR/MSI-H population. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The combination of dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with primary 
advanced or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer and who are candidates for systemic therapy 
showed an improved PFS by investigator compared with placebo plus chemotherapy in a prespecified 
interim analysis [HR: 0.28 (95% CI 0.162, 0.495); p-value <0.0001; median PFS not reached vs. 7.7 
months]. Results from the PFS subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the main analysis and 
also favoured the dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel arm. Several sensitivity analyses for PFS have 
also confirmed the reported main results.  
A first interim analysis of OS was performed (33% maturity) in the overall population, the only population 
in which OS was formally assessed. Although data are still immature and no statistical significance was 
reached, a positive trend in OS has been observed [HR: 0.64 (95% CI 0.464, 0.870); p=0.0021; p-value 
stopping boundary for significance = 0.00177]. Additionally, although OS was not formally assessed in 
the dMMR/MSI-H population and the data are still immature (26% maturity), the descriptive OS results in 
the dMMR/MSI-H population seemed to confirm the observed trend in the overall population [HR: 0.30 
(95% CI: 0.127, 0.699); nominal p=0.0016]. Updated OS data were in line with the previously reported 
results, both for the overall population [HR= 0.68 (95% CI: 0.513, 0.911); 39% maturity] and for the 
dMMR/MSI-H population [HR= 0.33 (95% CI: 0.155, 0.722); 30% maturity].   
Secondary endpoints (PFS by BICR, PFS2, ORR by investigator and PROs) also favoured the combination 
of dostarlimab plus carboplatin-paclitaxel with pretty consistent and robust results.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The OS data at the time of the IA were immature (33% maturity) and, although updated OS data were 
provided within the procedure, data were still considered immature. Although there is a trend towards an 
OS improvement and a detrimental effect seems unlikely, uncertainty remains due to the immaturity of 
the data. Thus, to further characterise the efficacy of dostarlimab in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel, results from the final OS analysis will be provided once available (see Annex II condition, 
PAES). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Based on a safety analysis set of 487 patients included in RUBY study, 100% of the patients reported any 
TEAEs. Observed treatment-related AEs were reported by 98.4% of patients. Grade ≥3 TEAEs were 
reported by 70.5% and 59.8% of patients in the dostarlimab + carbo/pac arm and carbo/pac treatment 
arm, respectively. SAEs have been observed in the 37.8% of participants in the dostarlimab-chemo arm 
and 27.6% in the chemo treatment arm. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported by 
23.7% of patients in the dostarlimab + carbo/pac arm and 16.7% in the carbo/pac arm. Five cases of 
TEAEs leading to death were reported in the study, all of them in the dostarlimab + chemo arm. Immune-
related AEs were observed in the 56.8% of participants from the dostarlimab + carbo/pac arm and 35.8% 
in the carbo/pac treatment arm. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Chemotherapy-related AEs may confound the identification of irAEs for dostarlimab. Considering the fact 
that immune-mediated events are known effects of dostarlimab and close monitoring is advised, no 
further measures are considered needed at this moment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The Part 1 of the RUBY study targeted patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer 
and who are candidates for systemic therapy. Nevertheless, the MAH is applying for the indication in a 
subset of patients of this overall population i.e., dMMR/MSI-H population, instead of applying for the 
broad indication.  
The combination of dostarlimab with carboplatin-paclitaxel demonstrated a statistically significant and 
clinically relevant improvement in PFS by investigator in the dMMR/MSI-H population. Results in PFS by 
BICR were consistent with the results of the main analysis. Secondary endpoints, subgroup analyses and 
sensitivity analyses were also in line and supported these results. 
At the time of the DCO, OS data were still immature. The MAH will provide the final OS analysis once 
available (Annex II PAES). 
With regard to safety, overall, the results from RUBY Part 1 seem to confirm the observed safety profile 
for dostarlimab in the initial assessment. However, the addition of chemotherapy carries a different type 
of adverse events that may complicate early identification and management of immune-related AEs. 
Immune-related ARs were identified as a safety concern at the time of initial MA and relevant risk 
minimisation activities are in place. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Dostarlimab in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel has demonstrated a statistically significant and 
clinically relevant improvement in PFS by investigator in the treatment of patients with primary advanced 
or recurrent dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer and who are candidates for systemic therapy. This 
improvement has been supported by secondary endpoints. The safety profile appears in line with what is 
known for dostarlimab, except for the added toxicity of chemotherapy. It can be concluded that the 
benefits of dostarlimab in this new indication outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
With this submission the MAH also intends to fulfil SOB-clin-002 and convert the CMA into full approval. 
SOB-clin-002 is as follows:  
“In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab in adult patients with mismatch repair deficient 
(dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer (EC) that has 
progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen, the MAH should submit 
the results of the phase III, randomised, double-blind study RUBY, comparing the efficacy and safety of 
dostarlimab in combination with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in patients with recurrent or 
advanced endometrial cancer who have not received prior systemic anticancer therapy for recurrent or 
advanced disease. The CSR should be submitted by 31 August 2023.” 
The MAH has presented the results of the RUBY study, in due time. The results of this study have 
confirmed the efficacy and safety of dostarlimab in adult patients with dMMR/MSI-H recurrent or 
advanced endometrial cancer. Thus, the SOB-clin-002 can be considered fulfilled and the CMA can be 
converted into full approval.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Jemperli is positive. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy in accordance with 
the Commission Delegated Regulation (EC) No 357/2014, (a) an initial efficacy assessment that is based 
on surrogate endpoints, which requires verification of the impact of the intervention on clinical outcome 
or disease progression or confirmation of previous efficacy assumptions: 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy of dostarlimab in 
combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair 
deficient / microsatellite instability-high primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer and who are 
candidates for systemic therapy, the MAH should submit the final results of the RUBY study part 1. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel the treatment of adult 
patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR)/ microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) primary advanced 
or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC) and who are candidates for systemic therapy, based on results from 
study 213361 (RUBY) Part 1, listed as a Specific Obligation in the Annex II; this is a phase 3, 
randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of dostarlimab (TSR-042) plus carboplatin-paclitaxel versus 
placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or primary advanced endometrial cancer. As 
a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Annex II and Package 
Leaflet are updated in accordance. Version 3.2 of the RMP has also been submitted. This submission fulfils 
SOB-clin-002 thus supporting the switch from CMA to full MA. In addition, the marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. As part of the 
application, the MAH is requesting a 1-year extension of the market protection. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
The following specific obligation (SOB) has been fulfilled, and therefore it is recommended that is be 
deleted from the Annex II E:

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for verteporfin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
At the request of PRAC, the MAH submitted a cumulative review of convulsion cases. Seventeen cases 
were reported cumulatively (including 4 with a confirmed clinical diagnosis), mostly in relation to 
vasovagal reactions which is already listed in the PI together with hypersensitivity reactions. The 
product information currently states that both vasovagal and hypersensitivity reactions are associated 
with related general symptoms (e.g. syncope, sweating, dizziness, rash, dyspnoea, flushing and 
changes in blood pressure and heart rate). Therefore, in view of available data regarding convulsions 
associated with vasovagal conditions, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information 
were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for verteporfin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing verteporfin is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

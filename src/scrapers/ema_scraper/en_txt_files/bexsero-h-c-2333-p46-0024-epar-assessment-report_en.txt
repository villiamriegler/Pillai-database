Methods 
Objective(s) 
Immunogenicity Objectives 
Primary Immunogenicity Objective 
To demonstrate the sufficiency of the immune response to rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, when given 
concomitantly with routine vaccines (ie, DTaP-IPV-Hib, HepB and PCV-13) to healthy infants at 2, 4, 6 
months of age, as measured by percentage of subjects with serum bactericidal activity (SBA) titer ≥ 
1:5 against the indicator strains H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254 at 1 month after the third vaccination (at 
7 months of age). 
Key Secondary Immunogenicity Objective

To demonstrate the sufficiency of the immune response to a booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine 
when given concomitantly with routine vaccines (i.e., MMR and varicella) to healthy toddlers at 12 
months of age that were previously primed with 3-doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, as measured by 
percentage of subjects with SBA titer ≥ 1:5 against the indicator strains H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254 at 
1 month after the booster dose (at 13 months of age). 
Other Secondary Immunogenicity Objective 
To assess bactericidal antibodies against meningococcal B in healthy infants receiving rMenB+OMV NZ 
concomitantly with routine vaccines (Group A2) or routine vaccines alone (Group B2) at 2, 4, 6 and 12 
months of age, as measured by SBA geometric mean titers (GMTs), geometric mean ratios between 
post and pre-vaccination (baseline) titers (GMRs) and percentage of subjects with SBA titer ≥ 1:5 
against indicator strains H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and strain M10713 at baseline (2 months of age), 1 
month after the third vaccination (7 months of age), prior to the booster dose (12 months of age) and 
at 1 month after the booster dose (13 months of age). 
Safety Objectives 
To assess the safety and tolerability of 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ given at 2, 4, 6 months of age, 
followed by a booster dose at 12 months of age when concomitantly administered with routine 
vaccines (ie, combined DTaP-IPV-Hib and PCV-13 at 2, 4, 6 months; HepB at 6 months of age; MMR 
and varicella at 12 months of age) and of routine vaccines alone in terms of percentages and numbers 
of subjects with:  
•  Solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) reported from day 1 (day of vaccination) 
through day 7 after each vaccination. (Fever, rash and parotid/salivary gland swelling will be 
collected for an extended period of 28 days after MMR and varicella vaccination); 
•  Any unsolicited AEs reported from day 1 through day 7 after each vaccination;  
•  Serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal from the 
study throughout the entire study. 
Study design 
This was a phase 3, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study in healthy infants aged 
approximately 2 months at the time of enrollment. 
Study population /Sample size 
Number of Subjects (planned and analyzed): To obtain 120 evaluable subjects, it was estimated 
that approximately 150 eligible subjects would be needed to be enrolled in the rMenB+Routine group, 
to allow for a dropout rate of approximately 20%. Taking into account a randomization ratio between 
rMenB+Routine: Routine of 2:1, 75 eligible subjects were needed to be enrolled in the Routine group. 
The number of subjects planned to be enrolled and actually enrolled are listed in Table 2-1.

Table 2-1 Randomization Groups and Visit Schedule 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion: 
Healthy male and female infants approximately 2 months of age. 
Treatments 
The rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine was administered in a 3-dose schedule (at 2, 4 and 6 months of age), 
followed by a booster at 12 months age. Concomitantly, infants received routine vaccines (ie, 
diphtheria [D], tetanus [T], acellular pertussis [aP], poliovirus types 1, 2, 3 [IPV], Hepatitis B [HepB], 
Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib], 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV-13], measles, 
mumps, rubella [MMR] and varicella). For safety comparison and to assess the prevalence of 
bactericidal meningococcal B antibodies over the study period in those infants not receiving 
rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, these infants received routine vaccines alone as a control. 
Prior to the first vaccination (at 2 months of age), 1 month after the third vaccination (at 7 months of 
age), prior to the booster vaccination (at 12 months of age) and 1 month after the booster vaccination 
(at 13 months of age) a blood sample was taken from all subjects to evaluate bactericidal antibodies 
against meningococcal B. Vaccinations and blood samples were completed according to Table 2-1. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Primary 
The percentage of subjects with human serum bactericidal activity (hSBA) titer ≥ 5 at 1 month 
following the third vaccination (at 7 months of age) against the indicator strains H44/76, 5/99 and 
NZ98/254. 
Key Secondary 
The percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 5 at 1 month following the booster vaccination (13 
months of age) against the indicator strains H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254. 
Other Secondary 
The hSBA GMTs, GMRs and percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 5 against the indicator strains 
H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and strain M10713 at baseline (2 months of age), 1 month after the third

vaccination (7 months of age), prior to the booster dose (12 months of age) and at 1 month after the 
booster dose (13 months of age). 
Other Endpoints 
The percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 8 at baseline, one month after the third vaccination, at 
12 months of age (prior to the booster dose) and at 13 months of age (one month after the booster 
dose) for each of the three indicator strains (H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254) and strain M10713. 
Safety Endpoints 
Local (ie, injection site erythema, induration, tenderness and swelling) and systemic (ie, change in 
eating habits, sleepiness, irritability, persistent crying, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, fever [temperature ≥
38.0 °C] and medically attended fever) AEs were assessed for 7 days (including the day of 
vaccination) after each vaccination. 
All AEs occurring during the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination were 
collected on a diary card. 
SAEs, medically attended AEs and AEs that result in a subject’s withdrawal from the study were 
collected throughout the entire study period. 
After the administration of MMR and varicella vaccines (with and without rMenB+OMV NZ) at 12 
months of age, rash, parotid/salivary gland swelling, fever (temperature ≥38.0°C), medically attended 
fever and use of antipyretic medication were assessed for a prolonged period up to day 28 following 
MMR and Varicella vaccination. 
Statistical Methods 
The percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 5 were presented as point estimates along with the 
associated 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (CIs) at baseline (2 months of age, visit 1), 1 
month after the third injection (7 months of age, visit 4), prior to the booster dose (12 months of age, 
visit 7) and at 1 month after the booster dose (13 months of age, visit 8) for the meningococcal B 
indicator strains H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254. 
The criterion for the primary objective for a sufficient immune response at visit 4 (ie, 1 month after the 
third injection) was that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects with 
hSBA titer ≥ 5 should be > 70%. 
The criterion for the secondary objective for a sufficient immune response at visit 8 (1 month after 
booster) was that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects with hSBA 
titer ≥ 5 was > 75%. 
In addition, for each strain (H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713) the GMTs at baseline, at 7 months 
of age, at 12 month of age and at 13 month of age and the post-vaccination to pre-vaccination 
(baseline) GMR and their associated 95% CIs median, minimum and maximum antibody titers were 
determined using descriptive statistics and presented together with number of subjects for each 
vaccine group. 
All statistical analyses were performed on the logarithmically (base 10) transformed titers or 
concentrations.

Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 225 subjects were enrolled into the study and randomized to the 2 treatment groups. Among 
150 enrolled subjects in rMenB+Routine group, 148 subjects were exposed to at least one dose of the 
rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine. In the Routine group, 73 out of 75 enrolled subjects received at least one of 
the routine vaccinations. Overall, 98% of subjects met all inclusion criteria. The demographic and 
baseline characteristics were well-balanced across the study groups. 
Immunogenicity results 
Primary Objective 
Percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5 against N meningitidis serogroup B strains 
H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254 at 1 month following the third vaccination: 
In the rMenB+Routine group, at 1 month following the third vaccination, hSBA titers ≥ 5 were achieved 
in all subjects against strains H44/76 and 5/99, and in 79% of subjects against strain NZ98/254. The 
lower limits of the 2-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5 were 97.2% for 
H44/76 and 5/99, and 71.4% for NZ98/254 strain, all above the pre-specified sufficient immune 
response margin set at >70% (Table 11.4.1-1). 
Therefore, the primary objective to demonstrate the sufficiency of the immune response to 
rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, when given concomitantly with routine vaccines (ie, DTaPIPV-Hib, HepB and 
PCV-13) to healthy infants at 1 month after the third vaccination (at 7 months of age) was met

Key Secondary Objective 
Percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5 against N meningitidis serogroup B strains 
H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254 at 1 month after booster vaccination: 
In the rMenB+Routine group, before the booster vaccination (at 12 months of age), 81%, 99% and 
17% of subjects had hSBA titers ≥ 5 against strains H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254, respectively. At 1 
month following the booster vaccination, hSBA titers ≥ 5 were achieved in 99% of subjects against 
strain H44/76 and 5/99, and in 94% of subjects against NZ98/254 (Table 11.4.1-3). 
Although not part of the sufficiency analyses, the percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 5 were also 
evaluated against strain M10713. Prior to booster vaccination in the rMenB+Routine group, 22% of 
subjects had titers ≥ 5 which increased to 92% at one month following booster vaccination (Table 
11.4.1-3).

Other Secondary Objectives 
GMTs and GMRs at baseline, after third vaccination (7 months of age), before booster 
vaccination (12 months of age) and following booster vaccination (13 months of age): 
In the rMenB+Routine group, hSBA GMTs were low at baseline against all serogroup B indicator 
strains. At one month following the third vaccination, antibody levels had increased against all strains 
(H44/76: 72, 5/99: 963, NZ98/254: 9.20, M10713: 8.41). 
The GMRs following the third vaccination with respect to the baseline were 71, 875, 9.18 and 5.69 
against strains H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713, respectively. 
At 12 months of age, before the booster dose, hSBA GMTs were higher than at baseline, although 
lower than one month after the third vaccination for all 4 strains (H44/76: 11, 5/99: 205, NZ98/254: 
1.91, M10713: 2.18). 
The hSBA GMTs increased following booster vaccination against all 4 strains (H44/76: 157, 5/99: 
2315, NZ98/254: 26, M10713: 17). The GMRs with regard to baseline values were 155 for H44/76, 
2110 for 5/99, 25 for NZ98/254 and 12 for M10713.

In the Routine group, hSBA GMTs were low at baseline against all serogroup B indicator strains. There 
was no increase in GMTs against any strain in Routine group at 12 or 13 months of age, as expected. 
Safety results 
All enrolled subjects except two in each study group were exposed to at least one dose of the study 
vaccines. Overall ≥ 93% of exposed subjects in each study group were included in both solicited and 
unsolicited safety sets. 
Solicited AEs: 
•  Overall after any vaccination, at least one solicited AE was experienced by all subjects in 
rMenB+Routine group and by 93% subjects in the Routine group (Table 2-7). 
•  After any vaccination, the percentages of subjects experiencing at least one solicited local AE 
and solicited systemic AEs were higher in rMenB+Routine group than in Routine group 
(solicited local AEs: 89% vs. 71%, solicited systemic AEs: 100% vs. 89%). A similar trend was 
observed after each individual vaccination, with percentages decreasing for each group 
following subsequent vaccinations (Table 2-7). 
Solicited local AEs: 
After each vaccination of rMenB+OMV NZ: 
•  After each vaccination in the rMenB+Routine group, the most frequently reported solicited local 
AE was injection site tenderness in ≤ 51% of subjects, and was the only solicited local AE 
reported as a severe in intensity (≤ 5% subjects). 
• 
For the majority of subjects in the rMenB+Routine group, the first onset of solicited local AEs 
was from 30 minutes through day 2 after each vaccination. 
After each routine vaccination (PCV-13, DTaP-IPV-Hib, Hepatitis B, MMR, and Varicella): 
•  After each of the routine vaccinations, the most frequently reported solicited local AE in the 
rMenB+Routine group was injection site tenderness (PCV-13: ≤ 34%, DTaPIPV-Hib: ≤ 32%, 
Hepatitis B: 33%, MMR: 27%, Varicella: 30%). 
• 
In the Routine group, the most frequently reported solicited local AEs were injection site 
induration (PCV-13: ≤ 21%, DTaP-IPV-Hib: ≤ 22%, Hepatitis B: 24%) and erythema (MMR: 
18%, Varicella: 19%). 
•  After each routine vaccination, injection site tenderness was the only solicited local AE reported 
as severe, by ≤2% of subjects in the rMenB+Routine group. 
Solicited systemic AEs: 
After any vaccination (from day 1 through 7 following vaccination): 
• 
The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs after every vaccination in both 
rMenB+Routine and Routine groups were irritability (rMenB+Routine group: ranged from 75% 
to 52%, Routine group: ranged from 44% to 22%. 
•  After each vaccination in rMenB+Routine group, fever (temperature ≥ 38°C) was reported by 
higher percentage of subjects (51% to 44%) than in Routine group (15% to 8%. Severe fever 
(temperature ≥ 40°C) was reported by one subject in rMenB+Routine group after second 
vaccination, and by one in each group after booster vaccination.

Page 10/13 
 
 
 
•  Majority of solicited systemic AEs after each vaccination were mild to moderate in intensity. 
After MMR/Varicella vaccination at 12 months of age (from day 1 through 28 following vaccination): 
• 
In both rMenB+Routine and Routine groups, a similar percentage of subjects reported 
lymphadenopathy (parotid / salivary gland swelling: 25% and 29% respectively) and rash 
(36% and 33%). Severe rash was reported in 4% and 7% of subjects, respectively. 
•  A higher percentage of subjects (66%) in rMenB+Routine group reported fever (temperature ≥ 
38°C) than in Routine group (46%; Table 12.2.3-8). Only 1% subjects in rMenB+Routine 
group and 7% subjects in Routine group reported severe fever (temperature ≥ 40°C) 
Unsolicited AEs: 
From day 1 up to day 7 after any vaccination: 
Overall, the percentages of subjects experiencing unsolicited AE from day 1 up to day 7 after any 
vaccination were 72% in the rMenB+Routine group and 42% in the Routine group 
The most frequently reported unsolicited system organ class (SOC) of AEs from day 1 up to day 7 after 
any vaccination was ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’ (rMenB+Routine group: 
58%, Routine group: 21%). 
The most frequently occurring unsolicited AEs by preferred term reported from day 1 up to day 7 after 
any vaccination was injection site induration (rMenB+Routine: 52%, Routine: 17%. 
The percentages of subjects reporting at least possibly or probably related unsolicited AEs from day 1 
up to day 7 after any vaccination were 59% in the rMenB+Routine group and 24% in Routine group. 
These were due to solicited AEs that were ongoing after the 7 day reporting period. 
The most frequently occurring possibly or probably related AE by preferred term reported from day 1 
up to day 7 after any vaccination was injection site induration (rMenB+Routine group: 51%, Routine 
group: 14%. 
From day 1 up to day 335 after any vaccination: 
The percentages of subjects reporting medically attended AEs from day 1 to day 335 were similar in 
rMenB+Routine group and Routine groups (90% versus 92%). 
A single subject in rMenB+Routine group reported unsolicited AEs (congenital cystic kidney and renal 
dysplasia) that led to premature withdrawal from the study. 
SAEs were reported by 13 subjects in rMenB+Routine group and by 8 subjects in the Routine group. 
None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the study vaccine and 
all were resolved prior to study completion. No death occurred in the study.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine when 
administered concomitantly with routine vaccines to healthy infants in Taiwan. The immunogenicity 
results were in agreement with other previously reported studies in infants and toddlers from other 
parts of the world.  
The safety results were also in agreement with previously reported clinical studies in the same age 
groups, and no new safety signal was detected in this study.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The results of this study show that the immune responses were well in agreement with previous 
studies, and no new safety signal was detected. Thus, this paediatric procedure is considered fulfilled 
and no further regulatory action is required based on this study.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Following the CHMP assessment of all data provided, the agreed therapeutic indication is: 
‘NULIBRY is indicated for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) 
Type A.’ 
Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) type A is an ultra-rare, rapidly progressive, chronic, and 
mostly fatal, autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism.  
Two-thirds of MoCD patients have Type A due to mutations in the MOCS1 gene localized on 
chromosome 6p21.3 which leads to a complete lack of MOCS1A/B enzyme activity with no formation of 
cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Incidence estimates have progressively changed with an improved understanding of the disease. Initial 
estimates predicted that it occurs in less than one in 100,000 to 200,000 newborns worldwide. To 
date, more than 100 cases of MoCD have been reported in the literature, representing numerous 
ethnic groups with higher prevalence in areas of high consanguinity. MoCD, is thought to be 
underdiagnosed. The most recent estimation based on the Hardy-Weinberg equation and allelic 
frequencies of represented variants was within the range of one in 341,690 to 411,187.  
The most recent estimates of MoCD type A in the EU are based on 20 publications and reporting cases 
of any types of MoCD; among those a total of 53 MoCD Type A cases were reported leading to an 
estimated prevalence of MoCD Type A of 0.005 per 10,000 inhabitants.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
MoCD Type A is one of three known types of MoCD (Type A, Type B, or Type C), which is classified 
based upon the affected gene, with mutations in MOCS1, MOCS2/MOCS3 (Molybdenum Cofactor 
Synthesis gene 1, 2/3), and GPHN (Gephyrin gene), respectively.  
In patients with MoCD Type A, mutations in the MOCS1 gene lead to deficient MOCS1A/B dependent 
synthesis of the intermediate substrate cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP). The majority of 
patients with MoCD Type A reported to date carry mutations that lead to a complete lack of MOCS1A/B 
enzyme activity with no formation of cPMP. In the absence of cPMP, molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) 
cannot be synthesized, resulting in all molybdenum-dependent enzyme activity being undetectable, 
most importantly sulfite oxidase (SOX). Deficient SOX activity leads to the accumulation of toxic levels 
of sulfites and the secondary metabolite S-sulfocysteine (SSC). Xanthine oxidase (or xanthine 
dehydrogenase), aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing components are also MoCo 
dependent and inactivated when this cofactor is absent but are not believed to contribute to the 
pathophysiology of MoCD. The same phenotype of neurologic insult from elevated sulfite levels is found 
in MoCD Types A, B, and C and in isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (ISOD); thus, implicating sulfite 
neurotoxicity as the primary mechanism of disease. 
Sulfite toxicity due to MoCD can result in significant, irreversible structural damage to the brain.

EMA/677145/2022  
Page 10/116 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
MOCD typically exhibits an acute onset in neonates or in early infancy however, later onset cases have 
also been reported. The different types of MoCD are indistinguishable clinically and biochemically, and 
the diagnosis of the specific type of MoCD is confirmed by genetic testing, which may take several days 
to weeks to complete. Laboratory findings in MoCD Type A, as well as the other two types of MoCD, 
include elevated levels of urinary and plasma SSC, xanthine, and hypoxanthine; a positive urine sulfite 
test; and a decrease in urinary and serum uric acid. 
Characteristics of the disease include intractable seizures, burst suppression or multifocal epileptic 
electroencephalogram (EEG), abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, metabolic 
acidosis, exaggerated startle reactions, axial hypotonia, limb hypertonia, gross destruction of the 
brain, failure to thrive, poor or halted feeding response, and high-pitch crying. Language, visual, and 
motor impairment with varying degrees of severity are observed. In the neonatal period, brain MRI 
and, to a lesser extent, ultrasound imaging patterns, include symmetrical pallidal or subthalamic 
lesions, cerebral infarction, subcortical multicystic lesions, progressive cortical and subcortical atrophy, 
and diffuse white matter abnormalities. 
These characteristics collectively precede rapidly progressive neurodegeneration. In the absence of 
treatment, patients usually die within the first years of life. Median survival is reported to be 36 
months.  
2.1.5.  Management 
There is no approved treatment for MoCD Type A in the EU.  Current treatment options are symptom-
driven to provide relief from clinical manifestations of the disease (e.g., antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for 
seizures) and supportive care, such as placement of a feeding tube.  These symptomatic treatments 
have no impact on the continued neurologic injury related to elevated levels of SSC that lead to 
significant developmental disabilities.  Although AEDs are available for the treatment of seizures, 
chronic epilepsy refractory to AED therapy does occur in patients with MoCD Type A. 
2.2.  About the product 
Fosdenopterin is a substrate replacement therapy and consists of synthetic cPMP (cPMP hydrobromide 
dihydrate). By replacing cPMP and permitting the two remaining MoCo synthesis steps to proceed, the 
activity of MoCo-dependent enzymes is restored.  
The restoration of activity from the MoCo-dependent enzyme SOX leads to the clearance of neurotoxic 
sulfites and is accompanied by a reduction of plasma and urine levels of the secondary metabolite SSC. 
Given the neurotoxic potential of sulfites and SSC, adherence to fosdenopterin therapy maintains 
clearance of sulfites and SSC, with inhibition of the underlying neuropathology. 
Fosdenopterin is for intravenous (IV) use only. For patients less than 1 year of age who are term 
neonates (gestational age ≥37 weeks), the recommended starting dose is 0.55 mg/kg/day 
administered as an IV infusion once daily. For patients less than 1 year of age who are preterm 
neonates (gestational age <37 weeks), the recommended starting dose is 0.40 mg/kg/day 
administered as an IV infusion once daily. Dosage should be titrated to the target dose of 0.90 
mg/kg/day over a period of 3 months, as shown in Table 1. 
For patients 1 year of age or older, the recommended dose is 0.90 mg/kg/day administered as an IV 
infusion once daily.

2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Accelerated assessment 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The unmet need in the indicated patient population.  
The safety and efficacy of fosdenopterin is supported by data from 14 treated patients and 37 
natural history controls. Although this patient number is very limited, this could be acceptable 
for such a rare disease. 
The efficacy will be assessed in a totality of evidence approach. The presented benefit 
concerning overall survival seems to be supported by positive effects on growth, motor 
function and disease biomarkers. Therefore, it can be concluded that the clinical data package 
is robust enough to support an MAA.  
In addition, these beneficial effects would constitute a major advantage for patients suffering 
from MoCD type A, with prolonged survival and possibly an increase in their health-related 
quality of life.  
•  With respect to the quality and non-clinical part of the dossiers, the data packages are 
considered robust enough to support an MAA.  
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as among others, major objections were raised regarding the 
comprehensiveness of the data. A Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances was 
proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant, and the applicant 
submitted a revised outline of the non-interventional study and proposed SOB(s) for Nulibry, which

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for solution for injection containing 9.5 mg of 
fosdenopterin, as active substance. The product contains fosdenopterin hydrobromide dihydrate.  
Other ingredients are: ascorbic acid (E300), mannitol (E421), sucrose, hydrochloric acid (E507) and 
sodium hydroxide (E524). 
The product is available in 10 ml type I clear glass vial with an aluminium seal and butyl rubber 
stopper.  
2.4.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of fosdenopterin monohydrobromide dihydrate is (4aR,5aR,11aR,12aS)-8-Amino-
2,12,12-trihydroxy-4,4a,5a,6,9,10,11,11a,12,12a-decahydro-2H-1,3,5-trioxa-6,7,9,11-tetraaza-2λ5-
phosphatetracene- 2,10-dione (hydrobromide dihydrate) corresponding to the molecular formula 
C10H19BrN5O10P. It has a molecular mass of 480.16 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier-Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), 
ultraviolet visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy and bromide content. The solid state properties of the active 
substance were measured by single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction (SCXRD, PXRD), dynamic 
vapor sorption (DVS), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 
2D 1H-1H Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) and chiral high performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) were used to confirm the stereochemical form.  
The active substance is a white to pale yellow to orange/red/brown crystalline solid. It is hygroscopic: 
Dynamic Vapor Sorption (DVS) shows absorption of water at a level of up to 35-38% w/w when 
exposed to relative humidity (RH) above 80%. Storage and handling conditions are established to limit 
water exposure.  Its solubility in water is pH dependent: it is poorly soluble (<1 mg/mL) at pH 1 – 4 
but is soluble (> 5 mg/mL) when the pH is > 6.8. Fosdenopterin hydrobromide, dihydrate is 
practically insoluble in several organic polar solvents.  
Fosdenopterin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres. Chirality is 
introduced from D-galactose, which is one of the designated Regulatory Starting Materials. D-galactose 
is tested for specific optical rotation. Although enantiomeric purity of the active substance is not 
routinely tested, the absence of enantiomers is ensured by upstream testing.

High through-put polymorph screening performed with multiple solvents resulted in 2 crystalline forms 
of the active substance (A and B). B was assigned to the target salt of fosdenopterin, while A was 
assigned to the dihydrobromide salt of fosdenopterin. The potential for presence or formation of 
polymorphs is low. The proposed commercial manufacturing process selectively provided the desired 
form B. No evidence of other polymorphs or transitions of the active substance as manufactured and 
stored according to the specified conditions has been found and the XRPD profiles were consistent 
throughout the development program. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Fosdenopterin hydrobromide dihydrate is synthesized by a single manufacturer in five main steps using 
well defined starting materials  with acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Reprocessing of non-
conforming material may be performed by repeating the required steps of the proposed synthesis 
process. Recovery of solvents and reworking are not included in the dossier. 
The quality of the starting materials was assessed as suitable, in accordance with the general concepts 
presented in the relevant EMA guidelines. Information on knowledge of fate and purge of isomer 
impurities has been provided and a chiral control strategy developed. For all intermediates, limits for 
specified impurities, unspecified and total impurity content are considered acceptable and sufficiently 
supported by spike, fate and purge studies. 
Sufficient details on the manufacturing process development have been provided.  
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and elements of Quality by Design (QbD) such as risk assessment and design of experiment (DOE) 
studies.  A design space is not claimed for the routine manufacturing process, where Normal Operating 
Ranges (NORs) are used. Based on a risk assessment evaluation, the critical quality attributes of the 
active substance were identified: assay, impurities, bromide content, residual solvents and residual 
acetamide. The criticality assessment was used as a guide to design process parameter mapping 
studies. A summary of all material quality attributes and process parameters that may have an impact 
on product quality were presented, together with their rationales. Risk ranking assessment of reaction 
process parameters with the identification of process parameters was provided. PARs were established 
based on the studies performed (OVAT, DoE). All the manufacturing steps have defined PARs that 
control volume charge of reagents, solvents, temperature, agitation and similar parameters. Steps 
representing higher risk have been identified, and process mapping has been performed. No critical 
process parameters were identified in the manufacturing process. This is based on the studies which 
demonstrate that product profiles at critical ranges are comparable to those observed at the nominal, 
centre-point conditions.   
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
The known and potential impurities of the active substance have been presented and discussed 
regarding the stage of the manufacturing process where they are potentially formed including the 
impurities from the starting materials, solvents, and reagents. The control strategies are described 
along with the discussion about the fate and purge of impurities. A computational toxicology 
assessment has been performed for starting materials, intermediates, reagents, by-products and 
degradants of materials using (Q)SAR methodologies. The evaluated impurities have been classified 
with respect to the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential according to the 5 classes as defined in ICH 
M7. Potential genotoxic impurities are identified and controlled in the active substance or in

intermediates. The specification limits for all these impurities are set based on the compound specific 
PDEs.  
A risk assessment for potential sources of nitrosamine impurities in fosdenopterin active substance was 
performed.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Clinical and nonclinical active substance batches were manufactured at 
a development site, after which the process was transferred to the proposed commercial 
manufacturing site.  
A free-base zwitterion form of active substance was used in early clinical studies, whereas the 
proposed commercial manufacturing process results in a hydrobromide dihydrate salt. Both molecular 
structures have been compared using multiple spectral techniques. The results demonstrate that the 
active substance used in the early clinical trials and active substance fosdenopterin (hydrobromide 
dihydrate) have the same therapeutic moiety and the only difference is the salt form.  Minor 
modifications were implemented to the synthetic process throughout development; however, the basic 
chemical sequence and main reagents are common to both the development and proposed commercial 
manufacturers’ routes. 
The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene (PE) bags which comply with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), colour and appearance of 
solution (Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, Ph. Eur., UPLC), assay (UPLC), impurities (UPLC), solid form 
identity (PXRD), bromide content (IC), ,residual solvents (HS-GC), sulfated ash (gravimetric, Ph. Eur.), 
elemental impurities (ICP-MS, Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), microbial quality (Ph. Eur.),  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The absence of a test for enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric impurity content is justified based on the 
stereochemistry control strategy at the level of the intermediates, as described above. 
Specifications have been set for assay and impurities (UPLC), solid form identity (PXRD), bromide 
content (IC), residual solvents (HS-GC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), The active substance 
specification lists controls for several solvents, including: solvents used in the final fosdenopterin-
forming and isolation step, solvents introduced in, but not subject to final control in upstream steps 
and materials that may be formed as a by-product or side-product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and, non-compendial methods, 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis data for 6 commercial scale batches of the active substance manufactured at the 
proposed commercial manufacturing site are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch.

Stability 
Stability data from five commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed commercial 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH 
guideline Q1B was performed on one batch.  
Results on stress conditions (forced degradation study on solution state active substance applying acid, 
base and oxidation stress, and on solid state active substance, applying heat and light stress) were 
also provide on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: description, assay, impurities, water content, identification, 
PXRD, microbiological quality, endotoxins. The analytical methods used were the same as for release 
(with two exceptions which were justified) and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters for the active substance stored at were within the specifications. The stability of 
polymorphic form during storage was confirmed.  
In the solid-state, the active substance was not observed to be sensitive to light. Stress testing under 
conditions of acid, base, oxidation, heat, and light demonstrated the stability indicating nature of the 
methods and the intrinsic stability of the molecule. The data presented demonstrate that the active 
substance is sensitive to degradation across a range of pH levels and under oxidative conditions. The 
active substance is sensitive to heat stress conditions with darkening of the solid material observed. 
There was a concomitant increase in total impurities level and assay levels were observed to decrease. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months in the proposed 
container. 
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Nulibry 9.5 mg powder for solution for injection is a sterile, white to pale yellow lyophilized powder for 
intravenous use. The finished product is packaged in 10 mL Type 1 clear glass vials, with an aluminium 
seal and butyl rubber stopper. 
The finished product is to be reconstituted with 5.0 mL of sterile water for injections to provide a 
solution containing 1.9 mg/mL fosdenopterin and a pH range of 5–7. An overfill of 0.23 mL (5.23 mL 
target fill volume) is used to assure removal of 5.0 mL for administration.  
The finished product is dosed with a conventional disposable syringe and an infusion tubing set (which 
are not part of the commercial presentation). 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Compatibility between the active substance and excipients was demonstrated in formulation 
development studies, as well as stability studies. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The goal of the 
formulation development, as also described in the QTTP, was to design a stable sterile, single-dose 
finished product for administration by intravenous injection suitable for paediatric and adult use, with 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022  
Page 16/116 
 
 
 
 
acceptable pH and osmolality. The finished product should be stable during storage in the primary 
container closure, with a shelf life of at least 24 months, and during in-use period.  
The CQAs identified were appearance (before reconstitution), reconstitution time, colour, clarity and 
completeness of solution (after reconstitution), particulate matter of reconstituted solution, pH, content 
uniformity, osmolality, container content, sterility, bacterial endotoxins, moisture content, identity, 
assay, degradants, assay of ascorbic acid.  
Active substance degrades in solution forming an identified oxidation product. Therefore, ascorbic acid 
is included in the formulation as an antioxidant. As this product is indicated for paediatric population, 
the applicant was requested during the procedure to provide evidence of compliance with Guideline on 
pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use (EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev.2), 
which was received and considered acceptable.  
Mannitol and sucrose are included in the formulation as bulking agents for lyophilization, and to bring 
the osmolality of the finished product into the physiochemical range.  
Manufacturing process development focused on determining conditions to minimize degradation of the 
active substance and produce a stable lyophilized product. Based on product knowledge derived from 
product characterization, formulation and process development, scale-up, and clinical manufacturing 
experience, a failure mode effect analysis was performed to systematically identify product CQAs and 
evaluate the impact of process parameters on the CQAs and process performance. 
The finished product is manufactured by a non-standard process consisting of mixing, sterile filtration, 
aseptic filling, lyophilization, stoppering, sealing, and inspection of vials for defects.  
The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed target setpoints and PARs. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
finished product.  
QbD studies were performed to confirm that the proven acceptable ranges for freezing rate and 
primary dry temperature of the lyophilization cycle are appropriate for the intended use. 
The four formulations used during clinical studies were all lyophilized formulations, very similar or the 
same as the proposed commercial formulation. For administration via intravenous (IV) injection, the 
formulation changes made during clinical development are not expected to have any impact on the 
pharmacokinetic profile of fosdenopterin and from that perspective, the formulations are essentially 
considered equivalent. The basic manufacturing process was the same for clinical, registration, and 
commercial finished product.  
The  primary  packaging  is  a  10  mL  Type  1  clear  glass  vial,  with  an  aluminum  seal  and  butyl  rubber 
stopper. The material complies with Ph.Eur. requirements. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. In-use studies 
demonstrated compatibility with the administration devices (see below under ‘Stability of the Product’). 
Although only minimal direct contact with the rubber stoppers is expected as the finished product is a 
lyophilised powder, the extractables and leachables studies have been performed. In addition, the 
simulated leachable study was performed included tubing systems used for administration.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps. The process is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process.  
All critical steps of the manufacturing process are adequately controlled. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and lyophilized formulation.  
Validation data include filter validation and manufacturing process validation. The applicant has 
initiated a concurrent validation program, for which the validation protocol was provided. Currently, 
validation results for two production size batch are available. This concurrent approach was accepted 
taking into account the benefit/risk profile, the orphan drug designation and consequent limited 
commercial demand requiring low volumes and infrequent manufacture. The CHMP recommended and 
the applicant committed to provide results of the third PPQ batch and full validation program as soon 
as they are available. Potential sorption of finished product solution components to the pre-filter and 
sterilising filter are sufficiently discussed and found acceptable.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications, include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
powder for solution for injection, namely: appearance before reconstitution (visual), reconstitution time 
(visual), degree of coloration of the reconstituted solution (visual), completeness of solution (visual), 
clarity and degree of opalescence (visual), particulate matter (of the solution, visual, Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. 
Eur.), water content (USP), identity (UHPLC by retention time, DAD UHPLC by UV spectra), assay 
(UHPLC), assay of ascorbic acid (UHPLC), degradation products (UPLC), content uniformity (UHPLC), 
osmolality (Ph. Eur.), container content (reconstituted, Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), container closure integrity (USP). Release and shelf-life limits for degradants 
and shelf-life limit for assay have been tightened as requested. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
The acceptance criteria are in accordance with compendial requirements and relevant guidelines and 
are therefore acceptable. Impurities which are controlled with limits above the qualification limit have 
been toxicologically qualified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product was assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing, and ascorbic acid testing, has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 17 batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months 
under long term conditions (-20 ± 5 °C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (5 ± 
3 °C) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of finished product are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
In addition to this, 12 months data from one commercial scale process performance qualification batch 
stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (-20 ± 5 °C) were provided, as well as 
supportive stability data from six batches and two commercial scale batches of finished product stored 
for up to 36 months under long term conditions (-20 ± 5 °C) and accelerated conditions (5 ± 3 °C) 
according to the ICH guidelines. 
The supportive batches were manufactured with active substance from a different manufacturing site 
than the proposed commercial manufacturing site, and were tested with different test methodology for 
assay, ascorbic acid, and degradation products, though the methods were comparable to the proposed 
methods used for the to be marketed product. 
Samples were tested for appearance before reconstitution, reconstitution time, appearance of 
reconstituted solution, pH, clarity and degree of opalescence, color of solution, water content, assay 
and degradation products, particulate matter, ascorbic acid, sterility (or container closure integrity by 
oxygen headspace analysis) and endotoxins. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
These results did not show any significant trends and remained within acceptance criteria during the 
tested period. 
In addition, samples of a batch of finished product were subjected to acid, base, oxidative, heat, and 
light irradiation stress. The stability indicating properties of the method are demonstrated by the 
reduction of peak area of the analyte peak, the presence of degradants, and the peak purity of the 
analyte peak.  
An ICH Q1C compliant photostability study was conducted in which a slight increase of one specified 
degradant was observed in the exposed vials, compared to the vials in secondary packaging, and to 
the control vials; however, the result remained within limits. Therefore, storage in the outer carton in 
order to protect from light is proposed and can be accepted.  
The in-use shelf life of the product after reconstitution is 4h at room temperature or refrigerated 
conditions (2-8 °C). In-use data from the three registration batches stored up to 24 months at -20 ± 
5 °C followed by 4 hours at room temperature after reconstitution, and from three supportive batches 
stored up to 24 months at -20 ± 5 °C followed by 4h at 2-8 °C support this in-use period, as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and storage conditions “Store in a 
freezer at -25 °C to -10 °C”, “Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light”, as stated 
in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was one minor quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertains to the fact that the applicant, applying a concurrent 
validation approach, still has to run the third process performance qualification batch for the finished 
product, in order to conclude on the outcome of the process performance qualification. This point is put 
forward and agreed as recommendation for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
-to provide results of the third PPQ batch and full validation program for the finished product. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
MoCo forms the active site of four apo-enzymes: sulphite oxidase (SOX), xanthine oxidase (or xanthine 
dehydrogenase), aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component. SOX catalyses 
the terminal step in the degradation of cysteine. Patients with MoCD Type A have impaired MoCo 
production at the GTP to cPMP conversion step in cofactor synthesis, leading to accumulation of the 
neurotoxic SSC. Fosdenopterin is a synthetically produced cPMP indicated for substrate replacement in 
MoCD Type A patients. By replacing cPMP with fosdenopterin, MoCo-synthesis and clearance of the 
neurotoxic sulfites and SSC are to be restored. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The MoCo-synthesis is considered highly conserved between species, and cPMP is considered identical 
between species. Initial cPMP substrate replacement therapy for MoCD Type A was by using E.coli-
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022  
Page 20/116 
 
 
 
 
derived cPMP (rcPMP). Fosdenopterin (free base) is a synthetically derived cPMP with identical core 
structures to rcPMP, expected to be functionally identical and undergo the same metabolism and 
disposition as endogenous cPMP. The intended route of administration is intravenous.  
In vitro data have shown similar dose-related biological activity of fosdenopterin and rcPMP, with 
regard to conversion to MPT and MoCo.  
In vivo studies were conducted in a mouse model of MoCD (MOCS1-/- mice), with phenotypes having 
similar characteristics and biochemical anomalies as human MoCD Type A. Untreated, the mice showed 
severe symptoms including slowed body weight gain, dehydration, limb paralysis and dramatically 
shortened life span (death 8 to 16 days) compared with wild-type (+/+) or heterozygous (+/-) 
littermates.  
Different routes of administration were applied, but not the intended intravenous (IV) route. In most 
studies, intrahepatic (IH) treatment with either rcPMP or fosdenopterin was initiated from PND1, with 
repeated dosing 3 times per week. The intrahepatic route of administration was then changed to 
intraperitoneal (IP) (IH/IP), subcutaneous (SC) (IH/SC) or oral (IH/PO) route in adult animals. The 
pharmacodynamic effects were achieved by all routes. The lack of data from the intended route of 
administration is considered acceptable based on the limited volume feasible for IV administration to 
mice.  
Treatment with fosdenopterin 3 times per week from PND1 (IH/IP or IH/SC) prevented early death, 
and the mice appeared alert and agile, and exhibited increased body weights, decreased plasma and 
brain S-sulfocysteine (SSC) levels and restored liver SOX and xanthine oxidase activities compared to 
vehicle-treated control animals. The effects were dose-related and similar to that observed for rcPMP. 
Extended life span, higher weight gain and normal behaviour were also seen following oral dosing of 
500 µg 3 times per week from PND27-70, but without normalising effect on plasma SSC. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
There were no significant findings noted for fosdenopterin in a secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) 
screening assay comprising 87 receptors, enzymes, ion channels and transporters. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular parameters were evaluated in an hERG-assay in vitro, a cardiovascular safety study in 
dogs, and in a CNS study in rats, all GLP-compliant. Further, potential effects on a number of ion 
channels, including hERG, were evaluated in a non-GLP automated screening assay. No fosdenopterin-
related effects were observed in vitro or on cardiovascular, CNS or respiratory parameters in vivo. Due 
to low maximum dose levels, margins at no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) are low to non-existing. 
Safety pharmacology parameters were also integrated as part of the repeat-dose toxicity studies. No 
effects were seen on respiratory, ECG or CNS parameters in the 39-week toxicity study in dogs or CNS 
or respiration in the 13- and 26-week toxicity in rats. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The main route of administration in animal studies was IV (slow bolus or infusion), in line with the 
intended clinical route of administration. In juvenile animal studies, SC administration was used from 
PND 7-20 in rats and LD5-25 in dogs. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of fosdenopterin was evaluated in 
dogs after a single parenteral (intravenous [IV] or subcutaneous [SC]) dose, and toxicokinetics (TK) of 
fosdenopterin was evaluated in juvenile and adult rats and dogs following repeated daily dosing for up 
to 39 weeks. In addition, single-dose PK properties for fosdenopterin in two different vehicles were 
assessed in rats following IV dosing. 
Concentrations of fosdenopterin in animal plasma were determined using validated LC-MS/MS 
methods. Overall, the results for the validation show that the assays are sensitive, selective, accurate 
and reproducible.  
Absorption 
There were no apparent sex-related differences in PK parameters in juvenile dogs receiving a single IV 
or SC dose of fosdenopterin at 5 mg/kg. The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) occurred 
at 0.25 hours after the IV dose (the first blood collection time point), and at 1 hour after the SC dose. 
Mean Cmax was higher in animals receiving the IV dose than the SC dose. The terminal half-life was 
1.12 and 1.18 hours in animals receiving the IV and SC doses, respectively. AUCs were similar 
following IV and SC dosing. The absolute bioavailability after SC dosing was approximately 97%.  
Following repeated dosing to rats and dogs, systemic exposures to fosdenopterin generally increased in 
a dose-proportional manner with increasing dose. There were no apparent sex-related differences in PK 
parameters. Half-lives were short (generally below 1h), with no quantifiable concentrations beyond 4h 
after dosing in rats and beyond 6 hours in dogs.  
For most studies, maximum feasible doses were limited by low solubility and maximum dose volume.  
An updated vehicle (vehicle 2) was applied in a 13-week toxicity study in juvenile rats to enable higher 
solubility and thereby higher maximum feasible dose. Single-dose PK properties, including mean 
plasma concentrations, were similar for the two different vehicles at comparable doses in a non-GLP 
study in male rats.  
Distribution 
In a quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) study in pigmented and non-pigmented rats 
administered [14C]-fosdenopterin, test article-derived radioactivity was widely distributed. 
Radioactivity was no longer measurable in the majority of tissues (≥75%) by 24 hours post-dose. 
Tissues with the highest observed levels of radioactivity included the kidneys, epiphyseal line, 
oesophagus, liver, and skin in both rat strains. In addition, radioactivity concentrations were relatively 
very high in urine but undetectable in bile. Low levels of radioactivity did cross the blood:brain barrier 
for a brief interval at 0.5 hours post-dose in both rat strains, indicate limited penetration into CNS 
tissues protected by the blood-brain barrier. There were no qualitative differences in tissue distribution 
patterns between pigmented and non-pigmented rats. 
The in vitro studies to assess protein binding and blood cell partitioning were affected by stability 
issues for fosdenopterin, and different concentrations of ascorbic acid and different incubation periods 
were applied to increase stability. At 5 mM ascorbic acid and 5 minutes of incubation, fosdenopterin 
exhibited low plasma protein binding in all species tested (approximately 21-24% in mouse, 7-17% in 
rat, 23-34% in dog and 6-12% in human). In the non-acidified blood system, the distribution of 
fosdenopterin to red blood cells was approximately 30% in mouse blood, 26% in rat blood, 20% in 
human blood and 6% in dog blood. Little to no distribution of fosdenopterin into red blood cells were 
seen following addition of ascorbic acid.

Metabolism 
In vitro studies provided by the applicant indicate that fosdenopterin is stable in hepatocytes from 
mouse, rat, dog and human over the 240-min of incubation (studies XT134092 and XT134093). 
Compound Z is the only metabolite formed in all species tested, including humans. Compound Z was 
observed following incubation with intact and denaturated hepatocytes, indicating generation via a 
non-enzymatic degradation process.  
In vivo studies to address metabolism have not been conducted. The applicant justifies this by lack of 
metabolites in vitro, and by fosdenopterin being a synthetic replacement for the endogenous molecule 
(cPMP) expected to be eliminated and excreted in an identical manner to that of the endogenous 
molecule, namely, enzymatic conversion of cPMP to MPT and subsequent formation of MoCo, or 
spontaneous oxidation of cPMP to Compound Z in aqueous fluids and subsequent excretion primarily in 
urine. 
Excretion 
Excretion studies have not been conducted.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
See below under the clinical section for assessment of potential interactions. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicity studies include single-dose toxicity in adult rats, repeat-dose toxicity studies in juvenile and 
adult rats and dogs, genotoxicity, in vitro haemolysis, and phototoxicity. In addition, in vitro 
genotoxicity studies have been conducted with synthetic intermediates and impurities. All pivotal 
toxicity studies are considered GLP-compliant. 
Most in vivo studies were conducted with 0.5 mg/mL formulation (Vehicle 1: L-Ascorbic Acid (2 
mg/mL), Mannitol (45 mg/mL), and Sterile WFI). A 10 mg/mL formulation (Vehicle 2: L-Ascorbic Acid 
(4.6 mg/mL), Mannitol (32.5 mg/mL), Sterile WFI, pH adjusted to 7.0 ±0.1), was developed at a later 
stage to increase solubility and was used in 7-day and 13-week rat studies. Both vehicles were well 
tolerated.  
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No conventional single-dose toxicity studies have been conducted. As part of a three-phase exploratory 
study in rats, acute IV bolus doses of fosdenopterin in vehicle 2 were well tolerated and comparable to 
fosdenopterin in vehicle 1.  
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
2-week studies were conducted in standard-aged rats and dogs administered fosdenopterin via daily 2-
hour IV infusion. In these studies, no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was determined to 10 
mg/kg/day, the highest administered dose level.  
Long-term studies were conducted in juvenile rats (26-week study, dosing from PND7) and juvenile 
dogs (39-week study, dosing from LD5). Dosing was initiated by the SC route. In rats, dosing was 
switched to IV bolus injection from PND21. In dogs, the SC route was either replaced or supplemented 
by IV bolus injections from LD26. Maximum feasible doses in the 26-week rat study and the 39-week 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022  
Page 23/116 
 
 
 
dog study studies were 5 mg/kg in rats and 10 mg/kg, respectively, limited by low solubility and 
maximum dose volume.  
No target organ for toxicity was seen in these studies, and no effects were seen on sexual maturation, 
behavioural performance, or bone parameters. In dogs, slight and non-adverse increased neutrophil 
counts and a mild increase in APTT were observed in males at 10 mg/kg/day, correlated with mild 
increases in serum globulin concentration, serum ALP and lipase activities. These findings were without 
histopathological correlates and were considered non-adverse. NOAELs for fosdenopterin were 5 
mg/kg/day (rats) and 10 mg/kg/day (dogs), the highest dose levels evaluated.  
As a follow-up, a 13-week study in juvenile rats was conducted with an alternative vehicle, leading to a 
higher level of solubility and allowing dosing up to 100 mg/kg/day from PND7. Fosdenopterin was well 
tolerated, with no test article-related ante- or post-mortem findings and no effects on sexual 
maturation, behavioural performance, or bone measurement. NOAEL was determined to 100 
mg/kg/day.  
Safety margins based on worst-case exposures in patients identified to date have been presented, 
indicating low margins to NOAEL in dogs, and higher margins to NOAEL in the 13-week toxicity study 
in rats.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Fosdenopterin was without genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo in the standard battery of tests 
indicated in ICH S2(R1). TK data were not collected in the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test. 
However, based on exposure data from the 13-week study in juvenile animals, exposure levels 
sufficiently above human levels are expected. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No studies have been conducted to assess the carcinogenic potential of fosdenopterin. MoCD Type A is 
a rapidly progressive disease without treatment options, leading to rapidly progressing 
neurodegeneration and death within the early years of life due to lack of cPMP. Fosdenopterin is a 
synthetic replacement for an endogenous molecule (cPMP) with identical core structures to rcPMP. 
Fosdenopterin has not shown any genotoxic potential and was devoid of preneoplastic properties in 
long-term toxicity studies with animals dosed throughout the juvenile stages. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive or developmental toxicology studies have been performed with fosdenopterin.  
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
TK data are addressed in section 2.5.3 Pharmacokinetics and in section 2.5.4.2 Repeat dose toxicity. 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Potential injection sites reactions were examined in repeat-dose toxicology studies conducted in rats 
and dogs. No fosdenopterin-related effects were noted following SC or IV administrations.

2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
No studies on antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence, or metabolites have been conducted.  
Impurities in drug substance 
There are three specified potential related substance impurities in the fosdenopterin drug substance 
specifications above the threshold for qualification (0.15%). The impurities are toxicologically qualified 
by genotoxicity and general toxicity studies, in accordance with the ICH Q3A (R2) guideline. 
Impurities in drug product: 
The impurity is toxicologically qualified by genotoxicity and general toxicity studies, following the ICH 
Q3B (R2) guideline.  
Phototoxicity 
Fosdenopterin is widely distributed following IV dosing, with significant distribution to skin and eye. In 
vitro and in vivo data have shown that fosdenopterin is phototoxic, resulting in skin reactions and 
ophthalmological findings in animals at all dose levels.

In vivo studies were conducted in a mouse model of MoCD (MOCS1-/- mice), with phenotypes having 
similar characteristics and biochemical anomalies as human MoCD Type A patients. When applying 
parenteral administration to this animal model, plasma SSC is considered a biomarker for disease and 
disease progression (based on survival, growth and behaviour). Plasma SSC was, however, normalised 
at lower dose levels and following fewer doses than brain SSC and liver SOX, and is thus considered a 
less sensitive biomarker for central and hepatic pharmacodynamic effects. Plasma fosdenopterin levels 
were BLQ within 24h and were thus not correlated with the PD markers.  
Extended life span, higher weight gain and normal behaviour was also seen following oral dosing of 
500 µg 3 times per week from PND27-70, but there was no documented normalising effect on plasma 
SSC. This apparent lack of correlation between disease progression and plasma SSC following oral 
dosing has not been further discussed. In the study report, however, suboptimal dosing to achieve full 
correction of the metabolic defects has been suggested. 
Safety pharmacology 
According to ICH S7B, in vitro studies should be GLP-compliant, and the test substance concentrations 
for in vitro studies should span a broad range, covering and exceeding the anticipated maximal 
therapeutic plasma concentration. In the GLP-compliant hERG-assay (study 793428), fosdenopterin 
was only tested at 2 µM, which is significantly below the expected human concentration (free fraction). 
In an automated screening assay for a number of ion channels (study 190129.PSN), there were no 
effects of fosdenopterin on the hERG current at concentrations up to 300 µM. Although not GLP 
compliant, the experiment was performed in accordance with procedures published in peer-reviewed 
journals and with the Standard Operating Procedures of Charles River Laboratories. Further, 
fosdenopterin was without QT prolonging effects in GLP-compliant dog studies (studies 2087-001 and 
2087-006), and was negative in a clinical thorough QT study (study ORGN001-102). Taken together, 
fosdenopterin is not considered to have a proarrhythmic potential. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted. No off-target effects have been 
detected for fosdenopterin in a screening assay comprising 87 receptors, enzymes, ion channels and 
transporters. Further, no alerts from the provided non-clinical documentation indicate any concern with 
potential interaction. Thus, the lack of dedicated non-clinical drug interaction studies is considered 
acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetics  
Metabolism 
In vitro studies provided by the applicant indicate that fosdenopterin is stable in hepatocytes from 
mouse, rat, dog and human over the 240-min of incubation (studies XT134092 and XT134093), with 
Compound Z being the only metabolite formed in all species tested. In contrast to this, the briefing 
document accompanying the CHMP protocol assistance (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/290139/2014) refers to an 
earlier in vitro study where 5 metabolites were observed in hepatocytes from mouse, rat, dog and 
human (study HU-0025-DV-HC). M1 (1.8%), M2 (2.2%) and M3 (0.5%) were oxidative metabolites, 
while M4 (3.9%, glucosylation) and M5 (7.7%, glucuronidation and sulfonation) were phase 2 
metabolites. The applicant has clarified that the 5 metabolites observed in HU-0025-DV-HC were due 
to the instability of fosdenopterin in an initial formulation. Ascorbic acid was included in later 
formulations and is included in the final product as an antioxidant to improve its stability. In the 
presence of ascorbic acid, fosdenopterin is stable in hepatocytes from multiple species including human 
with Compound Z identified as the only metabolite formed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022  
Page 26/116 
 
 
 
In vivo studies to address metabolism have not been conducted. This is considered acceptable since no 
metabolites are detected in vitro, and since fosdenopterin is a synthetic replacement for the 
endogenous molecule (cPMP) expected to be eliminated and excreted in an identical manner to that of 
the endogenous molecule. 
Excretion 
Excretion studies have not been conducted. Fosdenopterin is expected to be eliminated and excreted in 
an identical manner to that of the endogenous molecule, namely, enzymatic conversion of cPMP to MPT 
and subsequent formation of MoCo, or spontaneous oxidation of cPMP to Compound Z in aqueous fluids 
and subsequent excretion primarily in urine. Excretion via urine is supported by tissue distribution 
studies in rats, where the majority of [14C]-fosdenopterin-derived radioactivity was detected in urine 
within 24 hours after dosing, and no radioactivity was detected in bile. The lack of excretion studies is 
considered acceptable. 
Toxicology 
General toxicity 
The MoCo-synthesis is considered highly conserved between species, and cPMP is considered identical 
between species. Thus, rat and dog are considered relevant species for toxicity studies.  
Since physical and chemical analysis indicates that batches are comparable in all tested chemical 
attributes, lack of non-clinical bridging studies is considered acceptable. 
Long-term studies were conducted in juvenile rats (26-week study, dosing from PND7) and juvenile 
dogs (39-week study, dosing from LD5). Dosing from PND 7 in rats and LD5 in dogs are considered 
acceptable, in view of the intended paediatric patient population. 
Carcinogenicity 
MoCD Type A is a rapidly progressive disease without treatment options, leading to rapidly progressing 
neurodegeneration and death within early years of life due to lack of cPMP. Fosdenopterin is a 
synthetic replacement for an endogenous molecule (cPMP) with identical core structures to rcPMP. 
Fosdenopterin has not shown any genotoxic potential and was devoid of preneoplastic properties in 
long-term toxicity studies with animals dosed throughout the juvenile stages. Considering the above, 
and in line with 3Rs, carcinogenicity studies are not considered needed for fosdenopterin. A two-year 
carcinogenicity study in mice is however planned as a post-marketing requirement from FDA. The 
results from this study will be submitted when finalised.  
Reproduction toxicity 
No reproductive or developmental toxicology studies have been performed with fosdenopterin. Given 
the nature of the product, the patient population with reduced life expectancy, physical development, 
and the lack of available alternative therapies, lack of reproductive toxicity studies preapproval is 
acceptable. The lack of studies is adequately reflected in the proposed Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC). 
Since fosdenopterin is a synthetic replacement for endogenous cPMP, and no fosdenopterin-related 
changes were noted on tissues reproductive tract organs/tissues in long-term toxicity studies in rats or 
dogs, fertility studies are not considered required post-approval.  
Clinical efficacy data indicate significantly extended life expectancy with cPMP replacement therapy. 
Thus, post-approval embryo foetal development (EFD) and pre- and postnatal development (PPND) 
studies may be needed. Although Nulibry is a replacement therapy for the mother, the foetus may 
most likely express normal levels of cPMP. If fosdenopterin crosses the placenta, excessive exposure to 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022  
Page 27/116 
 
 
 
cPMP may be a potential concern for the developing foetus. If future data do indicate that the patients 
will be reproductively capable, conventional studies on reproduction toxicity will be conducted in mice 
and rabbits, in line with the US FDA post-marketing commitment. 
Lack of studies on antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence, or with metabolites is considered 
acceptable for fosdenopterin. 
Phototoxicity 
Fosdenopterin is phototoxic in vitro and in vivo. Adequate risk minimisation measures are included in 
the proposed product information. 
Environmental risk assessment 
PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L, and is not a PBT substance as log Kow does 
not exceed 4.5. Therefore, fosdenopterin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The MoCo synthesis pathway is highly conserved, and cPMP is considered identical between species. 
Fosdenopterin (free base) is a synthetically derived cPMP with identical core structures to rcPMP, 
expected to be functionally identical and undergo the same metabolism and disposition as endogenous 
cPMP.  
Overall, primary pharmacodynamic studies support that fosdenopterin can replace endogenous cPMP in 
a knock-out mouse model of MoCD (MOCS1-/-), showing phenotypes with similar characteristics and 
biochemical anomalies as human MoCD Type A. In these animals, fosdenopterin treatment from PND1 
prevented early death. The mice appeared alert and agile, exhibited increased body weights, decreased 
plasma and brain S-sulfocysteine (SSC) levels and restored liver SOX and xanthine oxidase activities.  
No fosdenopterin-related effects were seen on cardiovascular, CNS or respiratory parameters in 
conventional studies of safety pharmacology, or in safety pharmacology parameters integrated in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in juvenile animals.  
Pharmacokinetic data from rats and dogs administered parenteral fosdenopterin (SC/IV or IV) indicate 
dose-proportional systemic exposures without any substantial accumulation, and no apparent sex-
related differences in PK parameters. Half-lives were short (generally below 1h), with no quantifiable 
concentrations beyond 4h after dosing in rats and beyond 6 hours in dogs. In vivo studies of 
metabolism and excretion have not been conducted, this is justified by the applicant by lack of 
metabolites in vitro, and by fosdenopterin being a synthetic replacement for the endogenous molecule 
(cPMP) expected to be eliminated and excreted in an identical manner to that of the endogenous 
molecule. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed no major concerns. Long-term studies were conducted in 
juvenile rats (13- and 26-week study, dosing from PND7) and juvenile dogs (39-week study, dosing 
from LD5). Maximum feasible doses in the 26-week rat study and the 39-week dog study studies were 
5 mg/kg in rats and 10 mg/kg, respectively, limited by low solubility and maximum dose volume. As a 
follow-up, a 13-week study in juvenile rats was conducted with an alternative vehicle, leading to a 
higher level of solubility and allowing dosing up to 100 mg/kg/day. No target organ for toxicity was 
seen in these studies, and no effects were seen on sexual maturation, behavioural performance, or 
bone parameters. PK data from paediatric patients have not been presented, but safety margins are 
expected to be moderate to low. Fosdenopterin was negative in a standard battery of genotoxicity 
studies. Studies on carcinogenicity and reproduction toxicity have not been conducted. Fosdenopterin 
has shown phototoxic potential, this is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Biopharmaceutics, bioavailability, or bioequivalence studies were not conducted with Nulibry. This 
approach has been agreed upon in a pre-submission meeting held with the Rapporteur in June 2021, 
considering that fosdenopterin is a synthetic analogue of endogenous cPMP. To support the application, 
one human ascending dose study (Study MCD-101) in healthy volunteers was submitted. Sparse PK 
sampling from two patients in Study MCD-202 were combined with those of patients in Study MCD-201 
(n=8) and were included in the popPK model. 
Bioanalytical methods 
In general, the analytical methods are well validated. The levels of intracellularly produced cPMP are 
lower than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 5 ng/ml and thus the sensitivity of the analytical 
assay is considered to be sufficient.  
During validation LCMSC 669, maximal long term storage conditions were established to 190 days. The 
applicant has provided compliance between validated and long-term storage conditions for samples 
used for bioanalysis in Project RBWK and Project RMCB. The final reports of long term-stability for 
Project RBWK and Project RMCB have been provided. 
Absorption  
Fosdenopterin exhibited approximate dose proportionality in pharmacokinetics, with Cmax being 
reached between 0.5 and 1 hr.  
Study MCD-101 was a first-in-human, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, single-dose, sequential 
cohort dose-escalation study in healthy adult volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of 
single IV doses of fosdenopterin (infusion over 45 min).  
The following dose levels were evaluated: Cohort 1, 100 μg/kg, Cohort 2, 320 μg/kg, Cohort 3, 900 
μg/kg. Plasma fosdenopterin concentrations were assayed at dense sampling time points for all 
subjects post beginning of infusion (BOI) until 96.75 hours after dosing. Urine was collected from time 
0 to 6 hours post start of dosing post BOI for exploratory analyses of fosdenopterin (ALXN1101) or its 
metabolites. 
PK results are presented in Figure 2 and Table 4.

for about 45% of total body clearance. However, considering the t1/2 of up to 2 hrs and urine collection 
of up to 6 hrs (post BOI), there were concerns that renal excretion could be underestimated. The 
applicant has clarified that although urine was collected only up to 2 hrs, the extrapolated AUC was 
lower than 10% and that underestimation of renal excretion is in a range of approximately 5 to 6%, 
which is not clinically relevant. 
Fosdenopterin is not a substrate for CYP enzymes. Fosdenopterin is predominantly metabolized 
through non-enzymatic degradation processes to an inactive oxidation product of endogenous cPMP.

Time dependency 
Considering t1/2 of up to 2 hrs and daily administration, no accumulation is expected upon once daily 
dosing. 
Special populations 
Studies have not been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of fosdenopterin in specific patient 
populations, identified by race, age, or the presence of renal or hepatic impairment. Therefore, the 
effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of fosdenopterin is unknown. Renal 
elimination of fosdenopterin is estimated to be 45% and although it is expected that moderate and 
severe renal impairment could lead to increased plasma concentrations of fosdenopterin, based on the 
wide therapeutic index of fosdenopterin, such an increase is not expected to have clinical 
consequences.  
Drug-drug interaction potential 
Fosdenopterin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 
isozymes when tested in vitro in human liver microsomes. There was little or no direct time-dependent 
or metabolism-dependent inhibition of these isozymes.  
Fosdenopterin did not demonstrate induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4.  
Fosdenopterin does not inhibit efflux or uptake transporters. Inhibition of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1 (20 μM), OAT3, MATE1, and MATE2-K (20 μM) was reported as < 10% at 
200 μM, while cPMP demonstrated slight inhibition of MATE2-K (25%) and OAT1 (33%) at 200 μM. 
These effects are not clinically relevant.  
Fosdenopterin is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, or MATE2-K, 
and is possibly a weak substrate for MATE1.  
Overall, the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDI) is unlikely. Thus no in vivo DDI studies are 
deemed necessary. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Sparse PK samples from two patients in Study MCD-202 were combined with those of patients in Study 
MCD-201 (n=8) and were included in the popPK model. Pharmacokinetics in the target, paediatric 
population has not yet been adequately estimated. The final model was the two-compartment model in 
which the power term for scaling of systemic parameters was estimated to lead to the best objective 
function. In addition, a maturation function was included in the model to adjust clearance for organ 
maturation. The maturation function was based on a renal maturation model developed by Rhodin et 
al. The model in which the power term for scaling systemic parameters was estimated, and the renal 
maturation factor was applied to 100% of clearance yielded the smallest objective function. This, 
however, is not in line with the estimated renal excretion of 45% from healthy adult data. 
Another limitation of the model is the small sample size of paediatric patients. Of 10 subjects, only two 
subjects started treatment at birth, limiting the evaluation of the effects of maturational change during 
the period when it is likely to be changing most rapidly. The target population is likely to be newly-
diagnosed subjects in the first days-to-weeks of life. 
Furthermore, the sampling regimen typically included a sample at end-infusion and one approximately 
four hours later. The marked decrease in the second sample suggested that samples 1-2 hours post-
Assessment report

infusion might have provided more insight into the distribution phase (and, thereby, better estimation 
of area-under-the-curve). 
The applicant’s final pop PK model did not converge because the limited PK data did not support such 
an over-parameterized model incorporating IIV for all PK parameters with a full variance-covariance 
matrix. With only 10 subjects, it is noted that a model is fitted with 9 parameters. As a result of the 
failed model convergence also no standard error on the model parameters were presented. Four IIV 
(eta) parameters were estimated, which values ranging from 14 to 79%, which appears reasonable. 
However, those values were highly correlated. 
Body weight is a significant covariate on all four clearance and distribution volume parameters with the 
same allometric exponent value estimated to be 0.38. It is known from allometric theory that the 
scaling factor for the volume of distribution parameter differs from the scaling factor for clearance 
parameters. Therefore, the implementation of body weight in this model does not have a biological 
basis. In cases of very limited data and potential for extrapolation, fixing the allometric exponents to 
0.75 for CL and 1 for V parameters is preferred. This could have resolved the instability of the model. 
The standard goodness-of-fit plots appear to capture the data, which is not surprising with a model 
with 9 parameters (and 10 subjects included). VPCs support the conclusion that despite high 
variability, many deficiencies of the model and limits of available data, the model is able to capture the 
bigger trends of the concentration-time curve. Given the limitations of the available data (only n=10), 
no update of the popPK modelling was requested at this stage.  
Simulated exposures are presented also below, according to dosing regimens (Table 5), one for full-
term neonates, the other for neonates born prematurely (applying a cut-off of 37 gestational weeks). 
For subjects enrolling at ≥12 months of age, the starting dose is 0.9 mg/kg daily.  
Table 5.  Proposed Titration Schedule for Infants < 12 Months (mg/kg, once daily) 
Simulations were performed for subjects born at full-term and at 34 weeks, applying these doses at 
birth, 1 month, 3 months, 12 months, 2 years, and 4 years; fosdenopterin was infused at a rate of 
3.75 mg/min in units of salt (2.85 mg/min in units of base). At birth, concentrations were higher at 
term compared to prematures and differed minimally between males and females (Table 6, Table 7,  
Figure 3). By age 3 months, differences between groups were minimal. Cmax increased with age, the 
increase slowing at age 2 years.

During the PK development the human, ascending dose study was performed. Single doses of 0.1, 
0.32 and 0.9 mg/kg were well tolerated and no maximum tolerated dose study was set. The applicant 
was asked to justify further whether the maintenance dose taken is optimal, bearing in mind that 
exogenous supplementation provides less than 5% natural concentration in healthy subjects. The 
applicant explained that the estimates of the therapeutic doses were obtained from non-clinical data on 
the restoration of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo)-dependent enzyme activity in situations of MoCo 
deficiency. Based on the non-clinical data, the extrapolation to clinical dosing was performed, aiming 
the 50% of the activity restoration followed starting dose and the full restoration at the target dose. 
However, some non-clinical data suggested that the higher doses may have a more significant effect.  
Nevertheless, the doses investigated in clinical studies were associated with clinical benefits and an 
acceptable safety profile. In addition, even if higher efficacy could be expected at the higher doses, the 
Assessment report

Page 36/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose-response studies may be challenging to conduct, bearing in mind the number of patients with 
MoCD. 
The PK parameters were assessed in healthy adults. The data from the patients are scarce. The 
applicant was asked to discuss the possibility of changes in the PK of fosdenopterin in long–term 
perspective in children. In their response, the applicant stated that the limitations related to blood 
volume and other logistics made it impossible to do the extensive PK analysis in the target population. 
Instead, the PK in the (much younger) target population was assessed using a sparse PK dataset, and 
PK was analyzed using population PK methods. The PK parameters obtained with the two methods in 
the two populations were internally consistent as evidenced by the overlap in adult clearance values 
extrapolated to the paediatric weight range with the paediatric values obtained in the clinical studies 
(see Figure 4). 
Figure 4. Clearance Values for Paediatric Subjects and Adults 
In addition, the applicant presented indirect evidence regarding the PK of fosdenopterin, based mainly 
on the SSC levels. The biochemical efficacy of the fosdenopterin and clinical efficacy did not change 
over time, and therefore it can be concluded that the risk of PK changes is low. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No dedicated PD studies were conducted. Pharmacodynamic endpoints were included in the studies 
MCD-501, MCD-201 and MCD-202 (Table 8).  
Mechanism of action 
Due to a genetic deficiency in the MOCS1 gene, patients with MoCD Type A are unable to produce the 
precursor substrate cPMP, leading to an absence of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). This results in a 
deficiency in MoCo-dependent enzymes, of which sulphite oxidase is the most problematic due to the 
accumulation of sulphites that are neurotoxic.  
Fosdenopterin is a first-in-class cPMP hydrobromide dihydrate which treats MoCD Type A by replacing 
cPMP and permitting the two remaining MoCo synthesis steps to proceed, with activation of MoCo-
dependent enzymes. The restoration of activity from the MoCo-dependent enzyme sulphite oxidase 
(SOX) leads to the clearance of neurotoxic sulfites and is accompanied by a reduction in the secondary 
metabolites such as S-Sulfocysteine (SSC).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Treatment with cPMP led to a rapid reduction in levels of the MoCD-associated urinary biomarkers of 
SSC and xanthine normalized to creatinine and an increase in urinary uric acid normalized to 
creatinine; these improvements were maintained over long term treatment with cPMP. In the 
untreated control group, normalized urinary SSC and xanthine levels remained elevated over time and 
levels of normalized urinary uric acid remained low.

Exposure-response analysis (PK/PD) 
Study MCD-501 included the largest dataset of pre-treatment biomarker data; however, no exposure 
data was obtained in this study. Exposure data was available from study MCD-201, allowing the 
conduct of an exposure-response analysis, albeit not including pre-treatment (concentration = 0) data 
or data at drug doses ≤ 240 μg/kg/day and with the limitation that SSC and fosdenopterin were often 
not obtained on the same day.  
The time course of urine SSC levels from pre-treatment to substrate replacement therapy with rcPMP 
followed later by fosdenopterin administration after enrolment into the MCD-201 study is shown for 
one such patient in Figure 5. Lastly, Study MCD-202 has enrolled three patients with confirmed MoCD 
Type A, one of whom contributed an entire dataset of PK and PD data.

Two types of exposure-response analyses were conducted; analyses were based on observed values 
and modelled values. The first is presented here.  
Analyses were conducted for each matrix (plasma, urine). For each subject, Cmax (end-infusion) 
values for each sampling session were identified. The corresponding values for each biomarker were 
identified. "Corresponding" was defined as follows:  
1. A sample was obtained on the same calendar day.  
2. If no biomarker sample was obtained on the calendar day of the pharmacokinetic sample, the 
sample obtained in closest proximity (before or after; but never before the first dose of fosdenopterin) 
was identified. 
3. If no biomarker sample was obtained within 10 calendar days of the pharmacokinetic sample, the 
Cmax value was not included in this analysis.

Higher exposure to fosdenopterin was associated with a lower value of plasma S-sulfocysteine, as can 
be observed for the composite of all subjects in Figure 6. Higher exposure to fosdenopterin was 
associated with a lower value of urine S-sulfocysteine (Figure 7).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Biopharmaceutics, bioavailability, or bioequivalence studies were not conducted with Nulibry. This 
approach has been agreed upon in a pre-submission meeting held with the Rapporteur, considering 
that fosdenopterin is a synthetic analogue of endogenous cPMP.  
To support the application, one human ascending dose study (Study MCD-101) in healthy volunteers 
was submitted. Sparse PK sampling from two patients in Study MCD-202 as combined with those in 
Study MCD-201 (n=8) and included in the popPK model. VPCs support the conclusion that despite high 
variability, many deficiencies of the model and limits of available data, the model is able to capture the 
bigger trends of the concentration-time curve. Given the limitations of the available data (only n=10), 
no update of the popPK modelling was requested at this stage. The PK parameters obtained in healthy 
adults and patients were consistent. 
The effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of fosdenopterin is unknown. 
Renal elimination of fosdenopterin is estimated to be 45%. Although it is expected that moderate and 
severe renal impairment could lead to increased plasma concentrations of fosdenopterin, based on the 
wide therapeutic index of fosdenopterin, such an increase is not expected to have clinical 
consequences. 
The potential for drug-drug interactions is low. 
No dedicated PD studies were conducted. Plasma and urine biomarkers were collected in studies MCD-
501, MCD-201 and MCD-202.  
Study MCD-501 was a retrospective study in patients with MoCD Type A treated with rcPMP under a 
named-patient program. Study MCD-201 and MCD-202 are two ongoing prospective studies in 
paediatric patients with MoCD Type A treated with fosdenopterin. Patients in study MCD-201 were pre-
treated with rcPMP in study MCD-501 and the named patient program. 
The mechanism of action of fosdenopterin is well established. Due to mutations in the MOCS1 gene, 
patients are unable to synthesize cPMP, a substrate necessary for molybdenum cofactor production. 
Without MoCo, MoCo dependent enzymes, such as sulphite oxidase and xanthine oxidase, do not 
function. The accumulation of sulphites and secondary metabolite SSC is neurotoxic, giving rise to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022  
Page 42/116 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical phenotype. The main goal of treatment with fosdenopterin is restoring MoCo synthesis and 
facilitating the restoration of sulphite oxidase activity, thereby preventing neuronal damage.  
MoCD type A is associated with decreased uric acid and urine SSC and xanthine levels. In addition, 
urothione, a degradation product of MoCo is typically very low. Since these biochemical markers are 
direct reflections of MoCo absence and SOX and xanthine oxidase deficiency, these markers are 
considered appropriate to investigate the pharmacodynamic effect of fosdenopterin. 
Patients in study MCD-201 were pre-treated in study MCD-501, thus, MCD-201 baseline values reflect 
rcPMP treatment. After the switch to fosdenopterin, plasma and urinary SSC remained low and 
relatively stable throughout the study, indicating therapeutic equivalence between rcPMP and 
fosdenopterin.  
Although some patients showed transient increases in plasma SSC during the study, the reason is 
unknown; in general, all patients were within the normal range for SSC most of the time. The PD effect 
of fosdenopterin was demonstrated in the treatment-naïve patients enrolled in study MCD-202, for 
whom rapid (within days) decreases in serum SSC were observed after initiation of treatment. 
Normalization of plasma and urinary xanthine levels were observed in cPMP treated patients. Some 
control patients in study MCD-502 had a very low urinary xanthine level, which is not usually observed 
in MoCD type A patients. However, the complete clinical picture and the genetic diagnosis confirmed 
MoCD type A.  
Plasma and urinary uric acid levels changed minimally over time and showed a large variation. Uric 
acid levels at baseline were high in the treated patients compared to the natural history controls, which 
might explain why no clear increase was visible upon treatment initiation. In the first days of life, when 
most baseline values were obtained in treated patients, uric acid can be normal due to maternal 
transmission. 
Plasma urothione tended to increase over time in study MCD-201, consistent with the dose-escalation 
regimen. The applicant reports that the one treatment naïve patient in study MCD-202 showed a 
decrease in urothione plasma levels upon the treatment, coinciding with the clearance of maternal 
circulating urothione.  
The applicant has not discussed potential immunogenicity, formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) 
and the effects on safety and efficacy. Since fosdenopterin is a small molecule, it is assumed that 
immunogenicity will be low.  
No off-target effects are expected since fosdenopterin is a substrate replacement therapy.  
PD interactions with concomitant medications are not considered likely. 
The pharmacodynamic effect of fosdenopterin is not expected to be affected by genotype. In addition, 
the PD response in one late onset patient included in study MCD-202, resembled that of the early-
onset patients.  
In studies MCD-201 and MCD-202, dose escalations were instated, based on preclinical studies in 
juvenile mice which showed that the fosdenopterin dose that normalizes plasma SSC might not be 
sufficient to fully restore liver SO activity and that higher doses might be needed to achieve an optimal 
clinical outcome. This is in concurrence with the PK/PD data, which show that low doses of 
fosdenopterin were generally sufficient to restore biochemical markers, and no large additional effect 
was seen with increased dose.  
Exposure-response analysis showed that higher fosdenopterin exposure was associated with lower 
plasma and urine SSC levels. No relationship was found between plasma and urinary xanthine levels. 
There was a slightly positive trend for plasma uric acid but not for urine uric acid. There was a strong

positive effect of higher fosdenopterin exposure on plasma urothione. This data has several limitations 
since exposure, and PD parameters were only collected routinely in studies MCD-201 and MCD-202 
and PK and PD samples were often not obtained on the same day. This issue could have been 
overcome by adequate performance of the population pharmacokinetic model as observed 
concentrations/ exposures could be extrapolated to the time/day of PD sample collection. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology package is limited, which is acceptable considering the nature of 
fosdenopterin. Although pharmacokinetic data in the paediatric population is scarce, it is consistent 
with the healthy adult population.  
The PD effect of fosdenopterin is considered to be sufficiently demonstrated and supports the 
mechanism of action of fosdenopterin. In addition, exposure-response analysis indicated that higher 
fosdenopterin exposure was associated with lower plasma and urine levels.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dedicated dose-response studies were conducted. Therefore, the proposed dose is primarily based 
on pre-clinical studies, PK data and in part on the ongoing clinical studies. The justification of the dose 
used in the clinical studies and the proposed SmPC is briefly discussed here. 
The proposed dosing schedule for fosdenopterin in the SmPC is: 
For patients  less  than  1 year  of  age  who  are  preterm  neonates  (gestational  age  < 37  weeks),  the 
recommended starting dose of fosdenopterin is 0.40 mg/kg/day, administered intravenously once daily. 
The dose is to be titrated to the target dose of 0.90 mg/kg/day over a period of 3 months, as shown in 
Table 9.  
For patients  less  than  1 year  of  age  who  are  term  neonates  (gestational  age  ≥  37  weeks),  the 
recommended starting dose of fosdenopterin is 0.55 mg/kg/day administered intravenously once daily. 
The dose is to be titrated to the target dose of 0.90 mg/kg/day over a period of 3 months, as shown in 
Table 9.

The proposed regimen considers the patient’s age at initiation of treatment and gestational age (GA). 
Throughout the MAA submission documents, the fosdenopterin doses referenced are based on the salt 
form of the compound (i.e., fosdenopterin hydrobromide [HBr]). The proposed labelling will include 
dosing for fosdenopterin free base. Table 10 provides fosdenopterin HBr dose levels as referred to 
throughout the MAA and the corresponding dose levels for the free base both in μg/kg; the table also 
includes the conversion to mg/kg.

the Free Base with Proposed Label Dosing in μg/kg and mL/kg.  
Abbreviations: - = no proposed dose; HBr = hydrobromide; FB = free base 
1 Proposed doses are rounded to the nearest 50 μg of fosdenopterin in free base form to minimize potential 
dosing/medication errors 
2 Proposed doses include values dependent on patient’s gestational age at the time of birth 
In the clinical studies, a dose titration scheme was used for most patients who received rcPMP and for 
all patients who received fosdenopterin. The dosing regimen in patients treated with rcPMP was guided 
by clinical improvement and SSC and thiosulfate urine levels. Additionally, data from a study in 
juvenile mice showed that fosdenopterin reduced plasma SSC levels and restored liver SO activity in a 
dose-dependent manner. The effect of plasma SSC reduction plateaued at 1.1 mg/kg/day. However, 
the effect of liver SO activity restoration only reached a plateau at a higher dose of 4.4 mg/kg/day. 
This study indicated that the fosdenopterin dose that normalizes plasma SSC might not be sufficient to 
fully restore liver SO activity and that higher doses may need to be explored to achieve an optimal 
clinical outcome. Based on the above observations, an intra-patient dose escalation scheme was 
implemented in study MCD-201. Patients started fosdenopterin IV infusions at the same dose level as 
their current dose of rcPMP administered at a rate of 1.5 mL/minute. After 2 months of treatment with 
fosdenopterin, dosing with fosdenopterin increased every month by no more than 240 μg/kg/day if the 
patient’s clinical, PK, and safety assessments were permitted, including the absence of signs and 
symptoms of drug-related toxicity. 
The maximum dose of fosdenopterin in Study MCD-201 was 1200 μg/kg/day, and in Study MCD-202 
was 1300 μg/kg/day prior to a November 2019 protocol amendment (thereafter, the maximum dose 
was 1200 μg/kg/day to simplify the dosing and titration schedule).

2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
The claimed indication for fosdenopterin is “treatment of MOCD type A”.  
The applicant conducted 5 clinical studies (Figure 9) to support the proposed indication. The studies 
were conducted with recombinant cPMP (rcPMP, in study MCD-501) and fosdenopterin (cPMP, in study 
MCD-201 and MCD-202), which are considered to have identical active moieties (see quality AR). Two 
studies (study MCD-502 and 503) were aimed at collecting retrospective data to form a natural history 
comparator cohort for the integrated efficacy analysis.  
Since the pivotal evidence comes from the integrated efficacy analysis from studies MCD-501, MCD- 
MCD-201, MCD-202 and natural history studies MCD-502 and MCD-503, the methodology of these 
studies will be described hereunder main studies. In the result section, the integrated efficacy data will 
be presented instead of the individual results of the studies.  
Figure 9: Overview of clinical studies 
Integrated efficacy analysis.  
Methods 
Study MCD-501 was a retrospective, observational, noninterventional data collection study for patients 
with MoCD type A who have been previously treated with recombinant cPMP in a named patient 
program.  
Study MCD-201 is an ongoing, Phase 2, multicenter, multinational, open-label study designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of fosdenopterin administered infants and children with MoCD Type A 
pre-treated with rcPMP. The study also includes intrapatient dose escalation to determine the safe 
starting dose for future studies. The initial treatment period was 6 months, after which an extension 
period followed in which patients were continued to be treated and followed.  
Study MCD-202 is an ongoing prospective, multicenter, multinational, open-label study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of fosdenopterin in patients with MoCD Type A. The main study period 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022  
Page 46/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consisted of a 12-month treatment period, after which patients were followed up for 36 months in a 
long term extension part. After 36 months, patients continued to be followed every 6 months.  
Study MCD-502 was a multinational, multicenter, natural history study of patients with MoCD or 
isolated SOX deficiency. Complete medical history through the time of enrolment was collected 
retrospectively for all patients.  
Study MCD-503 was a follow-up data collection study where a single study coordination center  
managed multiple sites; data from secondary data sources were collected and provided to support 
evidence generation for global marketing applications. The aim was to collect survival data, and 
neuroimaging data for patients enrolled in studies MCD-502 and MCD-501. 
Study Participants 
Study MCD-501 included male and female patients of any age with MoCD Type A, suspected Type A, or 
Type B who previously received rcPMP only by IV route of administration and for whom parents or legal 
guardians voluntarily provided written informed consent.

Treatments 
Study MCD-501: this study was a noninterventional study. Patients had previously received rcPMP 
treatment following the named-patient treatment plans. 
Study MCD-201 
During the 6-month initial treatment period, patients began daily IV infusions of fosdenopterin on 
Study Day 1; the Day 1 dose was matched to their current rcPMP dose. Patients received their first 
dose of fosdenopterin approximately 24 hours after their last treatment with rcPMP. No further 
treatments with rcPMP were allowed during the study. 
The study drug was received in the hospital on Days 1 to 7. After hospitalization, patients continued to 
receive daily infusions of fosdenopterin at home. 
If the starting dose of fosdenopterin was not tolerated or exposure results exceeded the no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) AUC of 5490 ng•hr/mL, the dose was to be reduced by 25% (if not 
tolerated) or to a level that was expected to result in exposure below the NOAEL AUC. After the first 2 
months of treatment with fosdenopterin, dose-escalation occurred monthly, with the exception of 
unscheduled dose adjustments, until either (1) Day 180, (2) the patient reached a dose that was not 
tolerated, (3) the patient’s exposure exceeded that of the NOAEL AUC of 5490 ng•hr/mL, or (4) the 
patient’s exposure following dose escalation was predicted to exceed that of the NOAEL of 5490 
ng•hr/mL, whichever came first, upon recommendation by the SRC/DMC. Dosing with fosdenopterin 
increased every month by no more than 240 μg/kg/day. Pharmacodynamic and safety laboratory 
assessments were repeated 7 days after dose escalation. 
During the extension period, patients continued to receive uninterrupted daily dosing of fosdenopterin 
at their final tolerated dose based on the dose-escalation period. All doses were administered by IV 
infusion at a rate of 1.5 mL/minute. 
Study MCD-202 
Daily IV infusions of fosdenopterin began on Day 1 at either 700 μg/kg (term neonates, infants, and 
children) or 525 μg/kg (preterm neonates) at an infusion rate of 1.5 mL/min. The dose of 
fosdenopterin was then escalated to a maximum of 1300 μg/kg. 
Dosing began as soon as possible after birth for neonate patients and was based on a patient’s GA. 
Day 1 dosing for term (≥ 37 weeks GA) and preterm (< 37 weeks GA) neonates began with 
fosdenopterin IV infusions of 700 and 525 μg/kg/day, respectively. For all patients, the first dose 
adjustment was scheduled to occur at Day 28 with incremental increases up to 1300 μg/kg/day by 
Month 9. However, dosing may have been escalated on or before Day 28, based on the investigator 
and SRC/DMC review of all available data. 
If the patient’s Day 1 AUC was greater than the upper limit of the target AUC range (5490 ng•hr/mL), 
a dose decrease was recommended by the percentage that the individual AUC was greater than the 
midpoint of the target AUC range (4750 ng•hr/mL). If the patient’s Day 1 AUC was less than the lower 
bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the lower limit of the target AUC range (4000 ng•hr/mL), 
a dose increase was recommended by the percentage that the individual AUC was less than the 
midpoint of the target AUC range (4750 ng•hr/mL).

Outcomes/endpoints 
An overview of the measures of efficacy in the clinical studies is presented in Table 11. A short 
description of some endpoints is included below.  
Efficacy endpoints included the following: 
-  Change from baseline in urine and blood SSC levels 
-  Change from baseline in clinical findings from neurological examination 
-  Change from baseline in age-appropriate motor and cognitive assessments (Bayley Scales of 
Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition [Bayley-III]. The Bayley-III was administered to 
assess changes in gross motor, fine motor, language, and cognitive development. The Bayley-
III was administered to children 3 years of age and under and to patients with severe 
developmental delay for whom the WPPSI-IV was not an appropriate assessment. 
-  Gross Motor Function Classification System-Expanded and Revised [GMFCS-E&R]. The GMFCS-
E&R is a 5-level classification system that describes the gross motor function of children and 
youth (up to 18 years of age) on the basis of their self-initiated movement with particular 
emphasis on sitting, walking, and wheeled mobility for children with impaired motor skills. 
Children with motor functions similar to those classified in Level I can generally walk without 
restrictions but tend to be limited in some of the more advanced motor skills. Children with 
motor function classified as Level V have very little voluntary control of movement, no means 
of independent mobility, even with assistive technology, are generally transported by their 
caregivers directly or in a wheelchair, and require assistance for all activities of daily living. 
-  Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence– Fourth Edition [WPPSI-IV]). The WPPSI-
IV is an intelligence measure designed for children ages 2 years and 6 months to 7 years and 7 
months that comprises 15 subtests from which composite and age equivalent scores are 
derived. For patients with severe developmental delay, the WPPSI-IV may not have been an 
appropriate assessment, and therefore, the Bayley-III may have been administered instead.

-  Change from baseline in seizure frequency. At Screening, the patient’s parent or legal guardian 
was asked to recall the frequency of seizures over the prior month and the patient’s history of 
seizure medication, including the start and stop dates, dose, and frequency of each seizure 
medication. If the patient did have seizures, the patient’s parent or legal guardian was given a 
paper diary to record the frequency of seizures and any changes in seizure medication for the 
entire duration of the study. Data from the diary were reported at each study visit. 
-  Change from baseline in neuroimaging. MRI performed at the time points shown in Table 11 if 
the patient’s clinical condition allowed. An MRI at Month 12 and beyond was optional if the 
patient’s clinical status had not changed since the MRI at Month 6. Additional scans may have 
been requested as needed. 
-  Changes in growth parameters (body weight, body length, head circumference) 
-  Change from baseline in feeding patterns

Sample size 
Study MCD-501 
Because this was a noninterventional, observational study in which data were retrospectively collected, 
the sample size was dictated by the number of patients exposed to IV rcPMP treatment as of the cut-
off date of 31 Dec 2013.  
Study MCD-201 
There was no predefined sample size. At least 4 patients with MoCD Type A were planned for 
enrolment in this study. Patient enrolment was determined through named patient use with rcPMP, and 
the actual sample size depended on the number of eligible patients currently treated with rcPMP. 
Study MCD-202 
There was no minimum or maximum number of patients for this study. The final sample size and 
determination of study success relative to efficacy depended on the overall survival (OS) rate as each 
successive patient reached study completion.  
Study MCD-502 
There was no predefined sample size, however, an enrolment of at least 30 patients was foreseen.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Study MCD-501, MCD-201 and MCD-202 were open-label non-controlled trials. Therefore there was no 
randomization and blinding.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis of the individual studies was exploratory in nature. Pivotal efficacy evidence is derived from 
the integrated efficacy analysis, of which the methods are described here for the most important 
efficacy parameters. 
For the purposes of summarizing efficacy data, three analysis populations were constructed: 
• 
• 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All patients with MoCD Type A. This population includes all treated and 
untreated MoCD Type A patients. 
Prospective Full Analysis Set (PFAS): All patients with MoCD Type A were followed 
prospectively in Studies MCD-502, MCD-201, and MCD-202. This population is a subset of the 
FAS. 
•  Genotype-Matched Analysis Set (GMAS): All patients with MoCD Type A included in the m:n 
matching (where m is the number of treated patients and n is the number of natural history 
controls in a given match).  
The FAS serves as the primary analysis set for conducting the efficacy analyses, while the PFAS and 
GMAS are considered as supportive analysis populations.

Efficacy Analyses 
Overall Survival 
The first efficacy outcome measure is Overall Survival (OS). OS is defined as the interval in months 
from the date of birth to the date of death or date last known alive (patients still on study will be 
censored at the data cut-off, and patients alive at the last contact date will be censored as well), 
whichever occurs first. Patients in MCD-503 will be censored at the data cut-off date if it is found that 
they are alive after this date. This analysis will be done using the FAS population. 
Genotype-Matched Overall Survival Analysis 
Unadjusted Analysis 
Overall survival will be analysed using the GMAS population using Kaplan-Meier methods. Survival 
curves of treated and natural history controls will be provided, as well as curves by symptom onset and 
treatment initiation subgroups. Cox proportional hazards models will also be fitted using the GMAS. No 
form of adjustment for genotype-matching will be used.  
Adjusted Analysis by Matched ID 
Overall survival will be analysed using the GMAS population using Kaplan-Meier methods, stratified by 
matched ID. The stratified log-rank test will be used to compare median survival between treated and 
natural history controls while controlling for the genotype-matched IDs. Additional analyses following 
the Kaplan-Meier methods will be performed. A Cox proportional hazards model will also be fitted to 
assess the treatment effect on overall survival.  
Inversely Weighted Analysis 
The average treatment effect (ATE) will be estimated based on the GMAS population via the Cox 
proportional hazards model that accounts for the clustering within strata (matched IDs) and 
incorporates the appropriate set of weights. These ATE weights will be defined post-matching to 
determine the effect of treatment on the hazard of the occurrence of death in the GMAS. The ATE 
weights are described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Analysis of Biomarkers 
Biomarkers to be analysed include MoCD-associated urine and plasma biomarker levels consisting of S-
sulfocysteine (SSC), xanthine, and uric acid. Levels of biochemical markers that are measured in urine 
will be normalized to urine creatinine levels. The actual values over time will be presented via 
summary tabulations and graphical representations. The analysis of biomarkers will be presented using 
the FAS and the GMAS. 
Feeding Patterns 
Feeding patterns will be analysed via the frequency and percentages of each feeding method at the 
last visit where feeding pattern was recorded. In addition, feeding methods will also be tabulated 
dichotomously using the last recorded feeding pattern categorized as Oral versus Non- Oral. The age 
(in months) at the last feeding assessment will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
The dichotomous analysis will be performed using a logistic regression, with oral feeding (yes/no) as 
the dependent variable, and treatment status (yes/no), an indicator for the MoCD symptom onset 
subgroup, age (months) at last feeding assessment, and gender as independent variables. Odds ratios 
and 95% confidence intervals will be provided. The analysis of feeding patterns will be performed on 
the FAS and the GMAS population. A conditional logistic regression model will be fitted to investigate 
the relationship between feeding patterns and treatment status.

Genotype Matching 
In an effort to ensure comparability between treated patients and natural history controls, a matching 
algorithm was applied. Treated patients were matched with one or multiple controls from the natural 
history study based on genotype. 
The following approach was used to determine matching:  
•  Treated patients are matched with patients in the natural history study who have the same 
homozygous mutation. If a treated patient has more than one control in the natural history 
study with the same homozygous mutation, the treated patient is matched to each in a one-to-
many fashion. 
•  Treated patients who do not have an exact natural history homozygous matches are matched 
upon mutations with a similar anticipated impact on protein function (frameshift, missense, 
etc.). If a treated patient does not have an exact natural history homozygous match but does 
have more than one match with a mutation with a similar anticipated impact on protein function, 
the treated patient is matched to each in a one- to-many fashion. 
The protein products of MOCS1, MOCS1A and MOCS1B, contain sites and regions with highly conserved 
amino acids across all cellular life, from single-celled bacteria to humans (Hänzelmann, 2004). Only a 
small group of proteins are currently known to have this high level of conservation, with nearly all 
being intimately connected to sustaining life. In discussions with researchers who provided much of the 
published data on protein structure, the sponsor matched treated patients to natural history control 
patients based on the mutations' known impact on either MOCS1A or MOCS1B. Details on the matching 
criteria used for patients who were not an exact genotype match are provided in Comparative Case 
Reports.  
The matching criteria utilizing the genotype that was conducted is appropriate and informs on the 
efficacy of fosdenopterin. This is based on the fact that key baseline characteristics of the patients are 
comparable, thus supporting the matching algorithm across treated and untreated patients: 
•  Most of the patients with MoCD Type A presented with symptoms within the first 28 days of life 
and many within the first 1 to 2 days of life. 
•  Common presenting symptoms included intractable seizures, high-pitch cry, feeding difficulties, 
and exaggerated startle reactions. 
•  The high degree of regional overlap in study centres across the natural history and treatment 
studies, and in the matched pairs, including the US, UK, the Netherlands, Israel, Tunisia, 
Germany, and Turkey, suggests access to similar standards of care across studies in the 
development program. 
•  All but one of the treated patients had at least one matched control born within 5 years, 
suggesting similar access to healthcare advances, including supportive care. One patient 
(Studies MCD-501/MCD-201) was a homozygous match with another patient. 
•  9 of the 15 treated patients have at least one gender-matched control. 
•  9 of the 15 treated patients have at least one genotype-matched control; five of the 15 are 
matched based on mutations with a similar anticipated impact on protein function.

Results 
Participant flow 
Table 12 summarizes the disposition status of the 52 patients included in the integrated efficacy 
analyses; all 52 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of MoCD Type A. Overall, 15 patients who received 
cPMP were included in the treated patient group, and 37 patients from the natural history study were 
included in the untreated control group. 
As of the MAA data cut-off for the initial submission, nine of the 14 (64.3%) treated patients were 
ongoing on fosdenopterin, including eight patients in Study MCD-201 and one patient in Study MCD-
202. Overall, five of the 14 treated patients discontinued treatment. One treated patient from Study 
MCD-202 was discontinued from the study after 9 days (and 9 doses of fosdenopterin) per physician 
decision related to the poor neurologic prognosis of the patient. Of the remaining four discontinued 
patients, who all participated in Study MCD-501, two died, and two were reported as off treatment due 
to poor prognosis. In the D90 update period, one additional MoCD type A patient was enrolled in study 
MCD-202, bringing the total to n=15 cPMP treated patients.  
Figure 10: flow of cPMP treated patients 
The FAS includes all 52 patients, 15 treated and 37 untreated controls. The PFAS includes 24 patients 
overall: 10 patients with prospective data collected during treatment with fosdenopterin in Studies 
MCD-201 and MCD-202 and 14 patients from the natural history Study MCD-502 who had prospective 
data collected. The 15 treated patients were matched based on the genetic mutation to 19 untreated 
control patients; these 33 patients comprise the GMAS. Of note, due to the enrolment of 1 patient in 
study MCD-202 during the D90 update period, this patient is included in the FAS/PFAS and GMAS, but 
data was not included in all endpoint analyses.

Recruitment 
Study MCD-501 
Informed consent was acquired between 01 Nov 2012 and 07 Oct 2014. Fifteen patients enrolled in the 
study: 10 patients with MoCD Type A, 4 patients with MoCD Type B, and 1 patient with unknown MoCD 
type. This study was conducted at 13 centers, located in Australia, Germany, Netherlands, Turkey, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States, that had previously treated pediatric patients with rcPMP.  
Study MCD-201 
The first patient was enrolled on 02 April 2014, and the study is ongoing. In total, 8 patients have 
been enrolled, with 7 patients having completed through Month 54, and the 8th patient having 
completed through Month 6. Three patients have completed through Month 72, and 1 patient has 
completed study visits through Month 78. The study was conducted at 5 study centres in 5 countries 
(Australia, Tunisia, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States). 
Study MCD-202 
The first patient enrolled on 20 Jun 2016 and the study is ongoing. Five patients were screened for the 
study. Four patients were enrolled and received treatment with fosdenopterin. One patient was 
diagnosed with MoCD type B and discontinued. The study was conducted at 2 study centres, 1 in Israel 
and 1 in the United Kingdom, as of the data cut-off date of 31 October 2020. One additional patient 
was screened at a different site but did not meet screening criteria and did not receive study drug. 
Study MCD-502 
Informed consent was acquired between 24 Sep 2013 and 11 Dec 2015. Seventy patients were 
screened for this study, of whom 65 were enrolled at 27 sites in 14 countries. Of the 65 enrolled 
patients, 37 patients were diagnosed with MoCD Type A. Of the patients with confirmed MoCD Type A, 
17 (46%) patients were enrolled in the living cohort, of whom 14 (38%) patients enrolled in the 12-
month prospective data collection period. Thirteen (35%) patients with MoCD Type A completed the 
prospective data collection period; 1 patient died before the end of the data collection period.  
Conduct of the study 
For study MCD-202, MCD-202 and MCD-502, there were multiple amendments to the protocol. The 
majority were clarifications and administrative changes. There were also changes in endpoint hierarchy 
and endpoints added to the protocols.  
There were 11 protocol deviations in study MCD-501. Since this was a retrospective study, the 
majority was due to data extraction from the medical records after the date of informed consent.  
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 61/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study MCD-201 there were 3 critical protocol deviations. Two were related to privacy and informed 
consent, and one was due to an incorrect dose administered on one day.  
In study MCD-202, no critical protocol deviations were recorded. One important deviation concerned 
the missing of a follow-up visit one day after dose escalation.  
In study MCD-502, the protocol deviations were mainly related to the informed consent process or 
visits that were not completed outside the specified window.  
Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics are presented for the integrated analysis population. Patient 
demographics were generally balanced between the cPMP-treated and untreated populations (Table 
13).

Table 14 summarizes the patient baseline disease characteristics for the FAS and GMAS.  
Median age at onset of first MoCD signs or symptoms was similar in the treated patients (1 day of age) 
and the untreated controls (2 days of age); however, the maximum time to onset was shorter for 
treated patients (maximum of 3 weeks of age) compared with untreated controls (maximum of 2.5 
years of age). The median age at genetic diagnosis in the treated patient group was 3 days and ranged 
from -181 to 59 days, including four patients diagnosed in utero. In the untreated control patients, the 
median age at diagnosis was longer at 269 days (8.8 months) and ranged from 4 days to 40.3 years. 
In the FAS, the majority of patients had onset of first MoCD signs and symptoms within 28 days of 
birth (treated, 93.3%; untreated, 89.2%). 
The most common presenting signs and symptoms of MoCD in both the treated patients and untreated 
control patients with similar incidence across these groups were seizures (treated, 71.4%; untreated, 
91.9%), feeding difficulties (treated, 64.3%; untreated, 83.8%), high-pitch cry (treated, 50.0%; 
untreated, 43.2%), and exaggerated startle response (treated, 35.7%; untreated, 32.4%). Seizures 
were reported in utero or during the neonatal period in the majority of patients (treated, 78.6%; 
untreated, 70.3%). A higher proportion of patients in the untreated control group had late onset 
seizures (21.6%) compared with the treated patient group (7.1%). 
Baseline disease characteristics for the untreated population were similar in the GMAS and FAS. As 
well, the baseline disease characteristics for the PFAS were consistent with those observed in the FAS.

Note: The six patients that were treated with rcPMP on study MCD-501 and went on to enroll in study MCD-201 are 
only presented in the MCD-201 column. Note: Hypertonia, hypotonia, and encephalopathy were not collected as 
signs/symptoms in the MCD-501 and MCD-502 studies. a The maximum of 5 days is based on a patient with a

missing day for the onset of first signs and symptoms; the missing day was imputed using the 15th of the month, 
and based on this patient’s date of birth, the first symptoms could have occurred from 1 day to 21 days of age. b 
Patient was diagnosed in utero and initiated treatment with Nulibry prior to the onset of signs and symptoms; the 
patient is included as having onset within ≤ 28 days of birth. c Early seizures are defined as those reported either 
while the patient was in utero or within the first 28 days of life. d No prespecified signs and symptoms were 
reported for one Patient in study MCD-202.  
Molybdenum cofactor deficiency family history was collected. Parental consanguinity was reported in 
eight of the 15 treated patients (53%) and in 25 of the 37 untreated controls (67.6%). 
Eight of the treated patients had a total of 15 living siblings, of which one had confirmed MoCD Type A. 
Seven treated patients had a total of 10 deceased siblings, of which five had confirmed MoCD Type A 
status and three were suspected of having MoCD Type-A. The number of living or deceased siblings 
along with their MoCD Type A status, was unavailable for untreated control patients. MoCD family 
history was similar in the FAS and GMAS untreated population and was consistent between the FAS 
and PFAS. 
Across the 14 treated early onset patients, age at first dose was ≤ 14 days for 11 patients, with five 
patients initiating treatment at 1 day of age; the maximum time to initiate treatment was 69 days. The 
patient enrolled during the update period started treatment at 1015 days of age.  
Administered doses  
An overview of the extent of exposure to cPMP for each of the 15 patients by dose level of rcPMP and 
of fosdenopterin is provided in Table 32.  
Study MCD-201 
Per protocol, four of the eight patients titrated up to 1200 μg/kg/day during the study, two patients 
titrated up to 960 μg/kg/day and maintained that dose for the rest of the study, and two patients had 
dose reductions for ease of administration. Both patients had escalated to 960 µg/kg prior to dose 
reduction to a final dose of 240 µg/kg/day and 480 µg/kg/day, respectively.  
Study MCD-202 
One patient-initiated dosing on the day of birth with 525 µg/kg of fosdenopterin and escalated to 1300 
μg/kg by Month 9 as scheduled. The second patient-initiated dosing on the day of birth with 700 µg/kg 
of fosdenopterin, and this dose was administered daily as planned through Day 9. The late-onset 
patient enrolled during the update period initiated treatment with fosdenopterin at a dose of 700 μg/kg 
once daily (QD) at 33.4 months of age. The patient’s dose was increased after two months to 1000 
μg/kg and 1200 μg/kg three months after initiation.  
Numbers analysed 
For the integrated efficacy analysis, data from studies MCD-501, MCD-201, MCD-202 were pooled and 
compared to the natural history cohort. See Table 16 for the different analysis sets.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Overall survival 
Treatment of patients with MoCD Type A with cPMP led to a statistically significant improvement in OS 
compared with the untreated control patient population in both the FAS and GMAS (Table 16). 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 65/116 
 
 
 
 
As of the data cut-off date of 31 October 2020, two (13.3) of the 15 treated patients and 24 (64.9%) 
of 37 untreated control patients in the FAS had died. Median OS was not estimated for the treated 
patient group given the low number of patient deaths and was 50.7 months (4.2 years) for the 
untreated control group (log rank p=0.0091). The rate of death among the untreated control group 
was 5.5 times higher than that of the treated patient group. Consistent with these results, the survival 
probability at 1 year of age was 93.3% for the treated group and 75.3% for the untreated controls; at 
2 and 3 years of age, survival probabilities were 85.5% and 85.5% for treated patients and 69.6% and 
55.1% for untreated control patients, respectively. 
The Kaplan-Meier curves of OS for the treated and untreated patients included in the FAS are 
presented in Figure 11.

Figure 11: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival for cPMP-Treated Patients and Untreated 
Controls (Full Analysis Set, data cut-off 31 Oct 2021). 
Abbreviations: CI=confidence interval; cPMP=cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate; NE=not estimated. 
Results in the GMAS were consistent with the FAS. As of the data cut-off date of 31 October 2021, two 
(13.3%) of the 15 treated patients and 14 (73.7%) of 19 untreated matched control patients in the 
GMAS had died. Median OS was not estimated for the treated patients and was 47.8 months (3.9 
years) for the untreated matched controls (log rank p=0.0028, unadjusted). Patients in the untreated 
control group were 7.1 times more likely to have died than patients who received cPMP. Consistent 
with these results, the survival probability at 1 year of age was 93.3% for the treated group and 
68.4% for the untreated controls, and at 2 years of age, survival probabilities were 85.5% and 63.2% 
for treated and untreated matched control patients, respectively. 
Feeding patterns 
Patients who received cPMP were more likely to be able to feed orally and had a longer time prior to 
requiring sustained non-oral feeding than patients in the unmatched control population. Data is 
presented for the 14 early-onset patients. The late-onset patient enrolled during the update period was 
able to feed orally.  
In the FAS, eight of the 14 treated patients (57.1%) and 10 of the 33 untreated patients (30.3%) with 
data available for analysis were able to feed orally at the last recorded visit. The odds ratio indicates 
that treated patients were 7.8 times more likely to be feeding orally at the last assessment compared 
with patients in the untreated control group (Table 17). 
Consistent with these results, the median time to sustained non-oral feeding was considerably longer 
at 75.0 months for treated patients compared with 10.5 months for untreated controls. 
Results in the GMAS were consistent with the FAS. For this matched population, only four (22.2%) of 
18 untreated patients with data available were able to feed orally at the last assessment. In this 
population, treated patients were 9.1 times more likely to be feeding orally at the last assessment than

the untreated matched controls. Results of the conditional logistic regression analysis of feeding 
patterns for the GMAS were consistent, indicating that treated patients were more likely to be feeding 
orally at the last assessment with a hazard ratio of 4.2. The median time to sustained non-oral feeding 
for the untreated matched control patients in the GMAS was 5.7 months compared with 75.0 months in 
treated patients.

Note: Sustained non-oral feeding is defined as the time at which the patient never subsequently returns to an oral 
method of feeding. A The logistic regression is fitted using oral feeding (yes/no) as the dependent variable, and 
treatment status, MoCD symptom onset subgroup, age at last feeding assessment, and gender as independent 
variables. The odds ratio represents the odds of feeding orally when being treated versus not being treated.  
Growth parameters 
The growth parameters investigated in this study included body weight, body length, head 
circumference, and BMI. Data is presented for the 14 early-onset patients.  
At the last visit, mean and median z-scores for the untreated control patients were lower relative to 
the cPMP-treated patients for each of the growth parameters. Median z-scores at the last assessment 
were: -0.34 and -0.63 for weight for treated patients and untreated controls, respectively; -0.86 and -
1.37, respectively, for height; and -0.70 and -1.91, respectively, for head circumference (Table 18). 
The data shows that treated patients were more likely to have z- scores near or above zero, indicating 
that they had achieved growth that was closer to their age-matched peers than the untreated control 
patients.

Note: The six patients that were treated with rcPMP on Study MCD-501 and went on to enroll in Study MCD-201 are 
only presented in the MCD-201 column. First value is defined as the measurement with the earliest date of 
collection. 
Developmental Assessments 
Data is presented for the 14 early-onset patients. Data from the late-onset patient enrolled during the 
update period is presented separately.  
Gross Motor Function Classification System Results 
Children who have motor functions classified in "Level I" can generally walk without restrictions, and 
children whose motor function has been classified at "Level V" are very limited in their ability to move

themselves around even with the use of assistive technology and typically are pushed in a wheelchair 
for their mobility. 
Note that GMFCS-ER was only captured during the prospective Studies MCD-201 and MCD-202 and in 
the prospective part of Study MCD-502. Table 19 provides GMFCS-ER Level at the last available 
assessment for the PFAS; data were available for eight patients during treatment with fosdenopterin 
and for 11 of the 14 untreated controls included in the PFAS.  
At baseline, 4/9 treated patients were rated as level I, 1 as level IV and 4 as level V. In the untreated 
control group, 1/11 was rated as level I, 1 as level II and 9/11 as level V.  
At the last assessment prior to the MAA data cut-off, a higher percentage of patients receiving 
fosdenopterin who had data available were ambulatory (4/9, 44.4%) (i.e., assessed as a Level I on the 
GMFCS-ER) compared with the untreated controls (1/11, 9.1%). One additional treated patient was 
walking with assistance at 4 years old and was rated as a Level III on the GMFCS. The majority of the 
untreated control patients (9/11, 81.8%) required transportation in a wheelchair for mobility (Level V). 
In the treated patient group, four of the nine patients (44.4%), all of whom entered Study MCD-201 
with static encephalopathy and GMFCS-ER Level V, were assessed as Level V at the last assessment. 
In the GMAS, all seven (100%) of the matched control patients with data available were non-
ambulatory (Level V).

One patient was assessed on the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) at 34.3 months of age and 
35.8 months of age, with total percent scores of 78% and 70.2%, respectively. At the second 
assessment at 35.8 months of age, the scores remained similar. Per protocol, the Gross Motor Function 
Classification System – Expanded and Revised (GMFCS-ER) was not administered by the last 
assessment before the data cut-off; however, based on the patient’s functioning level at 35.8 months 
of age (ability to walk independently without an assistive device and run with coordination), the patient 
would be rated Level I on the GMFCS-ER. 
Bayley and WPPSI 
Patients who received cPMP were more likely to be higher functioning at the last assessment based on 
age-equivalent scores than the untreated control patients. 
The Bayley assesses the developmental functioning of infants and children 1 month to 42 months of 
age and consists of the following scales: Cognitive, Language (administered only to native English

speakers in English-speaking countries), which includes Receptive and Expressive Communication 
subtests, and Motor, which includes Fine and Gross Motor subtests. The WPPSI measures cognitive 
skills in children aged 30 months to 7 years, 7 months using 14 different subtests that examine 
cognitive function aspects such as vocabulary, visual spatial skills, logic, processing speed, and 
memory. 
Figure 12 presents spaghetti plots of age-equivalent scores for the Bayley Cognitive, Fine and Gross 
Motor subtests over time that were collected prospectively for treated patients and untreated controls. 
The higher functioning patients in all areas received treatment with cPMP; all untreated controls were 
lower functioning for all Bayley assessments. All of the treated patients with lower age-equivalent 
scores had entered Study MCD-201 with static encephalopathy. These four patients had age-equivalent 
scores that generally remained stable during treatment with fosdenopterin, with some gaining new 
skills.  
The WWPSI was only conducted for one patient from MCD-201 and one patient from MCD-202 (data 
not shown).

A summary of the cognitive developmental assessments for baseline and last assessment (as 
available) for the GMAS by matched ID is presented in Table 20. The table presents all patients in the 
GMAS with available data, regardless of the availability of data from a matched patient.  
For the treated patients, data are available from the start of fosdenopterin and are consistent with the 
data presented in the figures above; the four patients who entered Study MCD-201 without static 
encephalopathy who were higher functioning at study entry showed improvement during treatment 
with cPMP as did the patient who was treated with fosdenopterin in Study MCD-202.

One patient, enrolled during the update period, was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and 
Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley) at 34.3 months of age and 35.8 months of age. Language 
scale assessments were not performed as the patient was non-English speaking. 
At 34.3 months of age, the patient had age-equivalent scores of 25 months in the Cognitive subtest, 
32 months in the Fine Motor subtest, and 26 months in the Gross Motor subtest.  
The patient age-equivalent score on the Cognitive subtest improved to 32 months at the last available 
assessment at 35.8 months of age.  
Unassisted Sitting 
Most untreated patients with MoCD Type A are unable to sit independently at 12 months of age. An 
analysis of unassisted sitting in the FAS and GMAS is presented in Table 21. 
Treated patients are more likely to be able to sit unassisted than the untreated controls at 12 months 
of age and at any time. By 12 months of age, three of the seven treated patients (42.9%) with data 
available were able to sit unassisted for 30 seconds compared with three of the 27 untreated control 
patients (11.1%). The ability to sit unassisted at any time was reported for six of the nine treated 
patients (66.7%) and three of the 27 untreated controls (11.1%) in the FAS for whom data are 
available; none of the matched control patients in the GMAS could sit unassisted at any time.

Note: Patients were only included in the analysis of unassisted sitting if they had at least one assessment on or 
after 9 months of age. Note: The six patients that were treated with rcPMP on Study MCD-501 and went on to 
enroll in Study MCD-201 are only presented in the MCD-201 column. 
Note: For treated patients, results are based on the Developmental Milestones Module of the Denver Scale, or 
the Bayley Gross Motor Subscale Question #26. Those that do not have this question answered, but have higher 
Bayley gross motor subscale questions answered positively at 12 months were assumed to have been able to sit 
independently for 30 seconds at 12 months. For patients in MCD-502 results are based on the corresponding 
question from the Neurological Examination. 
Seizures 
A summary of seizure categories based on the most recent information collected at the time of data 
cut-off for the FAS and the GMAS is presented in Table 22.  
Consistent with the disease, most patients in the natural history control group had seizures that were 
either controlled or ongoing (present) on AED therapy. Among treated patients, seven of the 14 
patients (50.0%) had seizures ongoing and two (14.3%) had seizures controlled on AEDs and in the 
untreated control group, 13 of 37 patients (35.1%) had seizures ongoing, and 20 patients (54.1%) had 
seizures controlled. Very few patients did not have seizures present at any time: two of 14 treated 
patients (14.3%) and three of 37 (8.1%) were untreated patients. Importantly, three of the 14 treated 
patients (24.1%) had seizures resolved while treated with cPMP compared with one of the 37 
untreated controls (2.7%). 
The incidence of seizures was similar in the GMAS, eight of the 19 untreated patients (42.1%) had 
seizures ongoing at the last visit, with ten patients (52.6%) having their seizures controlled and no 
patients’ having seizures resolved. 
Based on the odds ratios, there was no apparent difference between the treated patients and 
untreated controls for the likelihood of having seizures not present or resolved versus having seizures 
controlled or continuing (present) in the FAS or GMAS. Results were consistent based on the adjusted 
model for the GMAS.

rcPMP on Study MCD-501 and went on to enroll in Study MCD-201 are only presented in the MCD-201 
column. 
A proportional odds model is fitted based on the cumulative logit function, with seizure status as dependent 
a 
variable and treatment status, MoCD symptom onset, and gender as independent variables. The Odds Ratio 
represents the odds of the treated patients to have seizure status as either Not Present or Resolved versus 
Controlled or Present, compared to the natural history patients. 
In the FAS, 10 of the 14 treated patients (71.4%) and 31 of the 37 untreated control patients (83.8%) 
reported prior and/or concomitant therapy with an AED, as did 17 of the 19 matched controls (89.5%) 
(Table 23).   
The number and types of prior and concomitant AEDs reported in the GMAS were similar to those 
reported in the FAS.  
One patient had no past history of seizures. This patient did not experience seizures during the 
observation period from 32.7 months of age to 3.3 years of age and no antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were 
administered. Results of an electroencephalogram performed at screening (32.7 months of age) were 
normal.

Neuroimaging 
A summary of first and last status reported for neuroimaging is presented for the FAS in Table 24. Note 
that there are differences between the studies with regard to reporting of normal and abnormal 
results: Studies MCD-201 and -202 reported results as 'normal', 'abnormal not clinically significant', or 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 75/116 
 
 
 
 
'abnormal clinically significant', whereas in Studies MCD-501 and MCD-502 results were only reported 
as 'normal' or 'abnormal'. Detailed by-patient results for the first and last neuroimaging assessments 
describing the abnormalities reported for the GMAS by matched ID are summarized in Table 24 of the 
summary of clinical efficacy.  
As expected, based on the MoCD Type A phenotype, most patients in both the treated and untreated 
groups had abnormal neuroimaging results. Further, the majority of patients who completed the 
neuroimaging assessments experienced no change in findings. One patient who received both rcPMP 
and fosdenopterin, had an improvement reported from abnormal, clinically significant at the first 
assessment in Study MCD-201 to abnormal, not clinically significant at 0.6 years later with the MRI 
results continuing to be reported as not clinically significant through the last assessment.  
Among patients in the untreated control group, 33 (89.2%) of the 37 patients had abnormal results at 
the first assessment, with consistent results reported at the last assessment (35 patients, 94.6%). 
Results were similar for the 19 matched control patients in the GMAS, with 17 of 19 patients (89.5%) 
having abnormal results at the last assessment. 
The neuroimaging results reported in the PFAS were similar to those reported in the FAS.  
For one patient, A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at screening (32.7 months of age) 
was abnormal, not clinically significant, and showed abnormal basal ganglia. No other imaging 
assessments were performed.

Neurologic Examinations 
Overall, cPMP-treated patients generally had better neurological functioning at the last visit compared 
with untreated controls. 
A summary of neurological findings at baseline and last visit in the FAS and GMAS is presented in Table 
25. Results for data collected prospectively for neurologic examinations are summarized in Table 26.

A lower percentage of patients (FAS analysis) who received cPMP treatment had abnormal results at 
the last assessment for truncal tone (50.0% treated vs 89.2% untreated), appendicular tone (57.1% 
treated vs 94.6% untreated), and deep tendon reflexes (64.3% treated vs 81.1% untreated).  
The neurologic examination results reported in the PFAS were similar. At last visit, cPMP-treated 
patients had better neurological functioning compared with untreated control patients with a lower 
percentage of patients reporting abnormal results for spontaneous movement (60.0% treated vs 
92.9% untreated), truncal tone (70.0% treated vs 92.9% untreated), appendicular tone (80.0% 
treated vs 100% untreated), and deep tendon reflexes (70.0% treated vs 92.9% untreated). 
For one patient, Results from neurologic examinations performed at screening (32.7 months of age) 
were normal and remained unchanged up to the last available assessment at 3.3 years of age.

Ancillary analyses 
The following section presents key efficacy results to assess for the potential effects in subpopulations, 
including time of cPMP treatment initiation and gender. As all 14 treated patients had MoCD-symptom 
onset within 28 days of birth, no conclusions can be drawn on this aspect. 
Treatment Initiation 
As specified in the SAP, early treatment of cPMP is defined as treatment occurring within 14 days of 
birth whereas late treatment is > 14 days after birth. Most patients (11/14, 78.6%) had initiated 
treatment within 14 days of birth. 
Overall Survival 
There was no apparent difference in OS for patients who were treated early versus those who were 
not. As of the data cut-off date of 31 October 2020, one patient treated within 14 days of birth and one 
patient treated > 14 days after birth had died. Median OS was not estimated in either group.  
Feeding Pattern, Growth, and Mobility 
Patients who initiated treatment within 14 days of birth were more likely to be feeding orally (7/11, 
63.6%) compared with those patients who initiated treatment later (0/3, 0%). Patients who initiated 
treatment within 14 days of birth had improved z-scores for head circumference compared with those 
patients who initiated treatment later (median: 0.19 vs -2.52). There was no apparent difference in 
median height z-scores (-0.84 vs -1.40) or weight z-scores (-0.26 vs -0.54) at the last assessment for 
these groups. 
Data are available for GMFCS-ER and for the evaluation of unassisted sitting for nine of the 10 patients 
included in the prospective Studies MCD-201 and MCD-202 (no developmental data were available for 
one patient from Study MCD-202 due to the patient’s discontinuation from the study on Day 13). 
Patients who initiated treatment within 14 days of birth were more likely to be ambulatory (4/7, 
57.1%) compared with those who initiated treatment later (0/2, 0%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 78/116 
 
 
 
Similarly, patients who initiated treatment within 14 days of birth were more likely to be able to sit 
unassisted (6/7, 85.7%) compared with those who initiated treatment later (0/2, 0%). 
Seizures and Neurologic Examination 
Seizures were reported as not present, resolved, or controlled in a higher percentage of patients who 
initiated treatment within 14 days of birth (7/11, 63.7%) compared with patients who initiated 
treatment later (0/3, 0%).  
Patients who initiated treatment within 14 days of birth were more likely to have normal results 
reported on the neurological examination compared with patients who initiated treatment later, 
including spontaneous movements (45.5% vs 0%), truncal tone (assessment 27.3% vs 0%), and deep 
tendon reflexes (45.5% vs 0%).  
Gender 
Overall Survival 
In males, the survival probability at 1 year of age was 100% for treated patients compared with 78% 
in the untreated controls; median survival time was not estimated in the treated group and was 50.7 
months in the untreated group. In females, the survival probability at 1 year of age was 86% for 
treated patients and 67% for untreated controls; median survival time was not estimated in the 
treated group and was 61.7 months for in the untreated group. 
There was no apparent difference in OS between males and females who received cPMP with survival 
probabilities at 2 years of age of 83% and 86% for males and females who received treatment with 
cPMP. The median OS was not estimated for either males or females due to the low number of deaths. 
Other Efficacy Parameters 
There was no apparent difference in reduction in biomarker levels for treated patients based on 
gender; both groups showed rapid reductions upon initiation of treatment with cPMP in contrast to the 
untreated control patients where biomarker levels remained elevated.  
Both males and females who received cPMP were more likely to have GMFCS-ER Level I- IV compared 
with the untreated control group, with no differences observed in the treated group based on gender. 
Among males, three of the four treated patients (75.0%) with prospective data collected were GMFCS-
ER Level I-IV at the last assessment compared with two of eight untreated controls (25.0%). Similarly, 
for females, two of five treated patients (40.0%) with prospective data collected were GMFCS-ER Level 
I-IV at the last assessment compared with none of three untreated controls (0%) who were all 
assessed at Level V. 
Treated patients of both genders were more likely to be able to sit unassisted at any time compared 
with untreated controls. Among males, three of four treated patients (75.0%) compared with three of 
21 untreated patients (14.3%) could sit unassisted at any time. Similarly, for females, three of five 
treated patients (60.0%) compared with none of the six untreated patients (0%) could sit unassisted. 
There was no difference in seizure status between treated patients and untreated controls and no 
difference in the incidence of seizures by gender for treated patients. 
Patients who received cPMP were more likely to have normal neurological examination results than the 
untreated controls regardless of gender.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Five clinical studies were conducted to support the proposed indication of MoCD type A.  
Study MCD-501 was a retrospective data collection of patients treated with rcPMP under a named 
patient program. A retrospective study design has limitations that might complicate conclusions on 
Assessment report

treatment efficacy such as the potential of selection bias. Twenty-one patients were treated in the 
named patient program. The exact reasons for not including patients in the clinical studies have been 
provided on patient level and did not raise any concerns with regards to the potential introduction of 
selection bias. Since study MCD-501 was the study in which most patients enrolled in study MCD-201 
were pre-treated, this study also provides pre-treatment baseline values for these patients. Patients 
pre-treated with rcPMP were eligible to enrol in study MCD-201, an ongoing open-label single-arm trial. 
Study MCD-202 is an ongoing open-label single-arm phase 2/3 trial for patients not pre-treated with 
rcPMP.  
Data collected in studies MCD-501, MCD-201 and MCD-202 were compared to a natural history cohort 
from study MCD-502. It was argued that a (placebo) controlled trial was not feasible in this patient 
population given the severity of the disease and the absence of other treatment options. This rationale 
is acknowledged and accepted. Since rcPMP and fosdenopterin are considered therapeutically 
equivalent based on the quality attributes and the consistency in pharmacodynamic effect, the pre-
treatment with rcPMP is not considered an issue. 
The use of a natural history comparator has limitations concerning the external and internal validity 
and is only acceptable in case the natural history is predictable, the expected treatment effect large 
and the endpoints objective. In the case of MoCD type A, these criteria are considered to be fulfilled. 
The majority of patients show a severe neonatal-onset form of MoCD type A, for which disease 
progression is rapid and predictable. Positive results were obtained in the named-patient program and 
case studies published in the literature. Since natural history data was retrospectively collected, there 
is potential for selection bias. Enrolment of study MCD-501 occurred before the natural history study, 
and the enrolment of study MCD-201 after the natural history study. There was a good regional 
overlap between treated patients and controls. Overall, it is considered unlikely that selection bias has 
occurred.  
The eligible patient population for the clinical studies consisted of patients of all ages with a confirmed 
or suspected diagnosis of MoCD type A. If the diagnosis could not be genetically confirmed, treatment 
was discontinued. This is understood and acceptable given the mechanism of action of fosdenopterin. 
For study MCD-202 specifically, cohorts were specified for patients with onset of symptoms after 28 
days of age. Enrolment of patients pre-symptomatically, based on a prenatal diagnosis was also 
possible. Study MCD-202 is the only study with fosdenopterin enrolling treatment naïve patients. Since 
the aimed indication is the treatment of MoCD type A, the patient population eligible for enrolment in 
the clinical studies is representative of the proposed indicated population. 
Treatment schedules differed between the clinical studies. Study MCD-501 was a retrospective study; 
patients had previously received rcPMP treatment in accordance with the named-patient treatment 
plans. Study MCD-201 included a dose-escalation schedule to increase the dose until a dose was 
reached that was not tolerated or if this dose resulted in exposures above the NOAEL AUC (based on 
maximum observed exposure in non-clinical studies and not based on toxicological findings). The 
starting dose was similar to the rcPMP dose that was received in study MCD-501. Dose escalation and 
maximum dose were formalized in the protocol of study MCD-202. The deviations in dosing between 
study MCD-501 and study MCD-201 and MCD-202 should be kept in mind when interpreting the 
efficacy results. In all studies, after the initiation of treatment in the hospital, doses were prepared and 
administered by the parents/caregivers at home via a central venous line (port-a-cath), after 
instructions and training. This is understood given the daily infusions. 
The objective of study MCD-501 was purely retrospective data collection to gather information on the 
treatment with rcPMP. The primary objective of study MCD-201 was to study the safety of 
fosdenopterin. Efficacy parameters were included as secondary endpoints. The efficacy and safety of 
fosdenopterin were further studied in study MCD-202. The main objective of Study MCD-502 was to 
Assessment report

Page 82/116 
 
 
 
collect survival data and other parameters relevant to describing the clinical status of patients with 
MoCD type A. The objectives are considered appropriate.  
All clinical studies consistently measured efficacy endpoints, plasma and urine biomarkers (see 
pharmacodynamics section), growth parameters, feeding status, and seizure activity. The prospective 
studies collected developmental, neuroimaging, and neurological assessments per protocol. For the 
retrospective studies, data collection was dependent on available records. The included efficacy 
endpoints are considered appropriate to assess the efficacy of fosdenopterin in the MoCD type A 
population. Patients present, often soon after birth, with seizures refractory to treatment. SSC-induced 
neuronal injury leads to abnormal motor and cognitive development in all MoCD type A patients.  
An effect on seizures would be an appropriate endpoint to assess efficacy. However, as the applicant 
pointed out in the protocol assistance, the quantification of seizures is difficult given the diversity of 
presentation and the confounding introduced by alterations in seizure medications. The Bayley scale is 
a validated scale for assessing development in children starting from 2 months of age. Although this 
scale is not validated for the use in MoCD type A patients specifically, it is expected to give a good 
overall idea of the motor and cognitive development of patients relative to healthy peers.  
The applicant has amended the primary endpoints of the prospective studies multiple times. As also 
suggested in the protocol assistance and follow-up advice, it is not considered appropriate for such a 
complex and rare disease to focus on one specific primary endpoint. The strategy of the applicant to 
collect data on multiple parameters indicative of the health status of a child is therefore supported. The 
data will be assessed in a totality of evidence approach. Although survival was not a pre-defined 
endpoint in the separate study protocols, it is a primary outcome of efficacy in the integrated analysis 
of efficacy. This is not considered an issue since it is expected that survival data was captured in a 
systematic way across studies.  
Given the rare nature of the disease, no formal sample size calculations were done, and enrolment was 
dictated by the availability of patients. This is understood and acceptable, also given the descriptive 
nature of the analyses. Given the limited number of included patients, the applicant has decided to 
present the efficacy data of these studies in an integrated efficacy analysis. This approach is 
understood and was found acceptable in the pre-submission meeting. For the assessment of the 
integrated efficacy analysis, the FAS will be considered of primary importance. However, the GMAS, in 
which genotype-matched patients are included, will provide important supportive information and the 
PFAS (prospective analysis set) since not all parameters were retrospectively collected.  
For MoCD type A, no clear genotype-phenotype relationship has been described. It remains unclear 
whether genotype is the only variable on which matching should be based, that is, whether it captures 
all possible confounding between treatment and outcome. For the matching to be valid, we have to 
assume that given the matching variable (genotype) both the prognosis and the treatment effect are 
independent of other variables (e.g. gender). However, given the supportive nature of the matched 
analysis, the need for a pragmatic approach to matching, and the lack of a known mechanism by which 
gender affects prognosis or treatment effect, the issue is not further pursued.  
It is unclear why no missing data imputation was planned, especially for the longitudinal outcomes. 
However, since those outcomes are only analysed in an exploratory and graphical manner, this issue is 
not further pursued.  
The analysis of OS is considered pivotal for the assessment. As such, emphasis should be placed on 
the actual treatment effect measure estimated, with respect to the handling of intercurrent events and 
the estimands framework as outlined in EMA/CHMP/ICH/436221/2017 reflecting on ICH E9 (R1). One 
intercurrent event of immediate interest here is treatment discontinuation which was observed for 
three patients (2/8 survivors=25% from study MCD-501 that did not enrol in study MCD-201 and 1/2, 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 83/116 
 
 
 
50% from study MCD-202). For the analysis of OS, the applicant employed the treatment policy 
strategy (i.e. ignoring the occurrence of intercurrent events, in this case, treatment discontinuation), 
which is considered acceptable. In addition, worst- and best-case scenario sensitivity analyses were 
provided.  
The main estimand for the time to non-oral feeding is based on the treatment policy estimand 
approach, thus ignoring intercurrent events. This approach does not properly account for the 
competing event of death. It is however clarified that most of the deaths occurred in the natural 
history study and thus the inappropriate handling of the competing events is not expected to impact 
the overall assessment.  
Even though the above described approaches to the analysis of feeding patterns can be acceptable 
given the limited sample size and information available, the shortcomings associated with them imply 
that they can only be seen as descriptive and supportive. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study MCD-501 enrolled 15 patients, of which 10 patients with MoCD type A. In study MCD-201, 8 
patients previously treated with rcPMP were enrolled, 6 from study MCD-501 and 2 from the named 
patient program. In study MCD-202, 5 patients were enrolled, of which two patients with type A is 
currently on treatment and included in the study. One patient with later onset of MoCD type A was 
included after the initial submission. One patient turned out to have MoCD type B and one patient was 
discontinued. The natural history study MCD-502 enrolled 65 patients, of which 37 were diagnosed 
with MoCD type A.  
In total, 15 patients treated with (r)cPMP are included in the FAS and are compared to 37 untreated 
control patients with MoCD type A. All 15 patients were matched to 1 or more genotype-matched 
controls from study MCD-502 (GMAS). 11 patients were prospectively followed under cPMP treatment 
in studies MCD-201 and MCD-202 (PFAS). Ten/14 patients are ongoing on treatment at the data cut-
off. Five patients discontinued treatment because of death (2 patients), poor prognosis (1 patient) or 
with a reason not recorded (2 patients). No pre-symptomatic patients were enrolled in the studies.  
The majority of the included patient population treated with rcPMP/fosdenopterin all had symptom 
onset in utero or shortly after birth and thus represent the severely affected patient population 
classically described for MoCD type A. Supportive evidence has been submitted from two patients with 
late onset MoCD type A treated with fosdenopterin, a form of MoCD that presents with a more 
heterogeneous phenotype. A discussion has been provided that the efficacy and safety data in early 
onset patients can be extrapolated to the whole patient’s population based on the same underlying 
enzymatic defect and the mechanism of action of fosdenopterin, which is agreed.  
For study MCD-202, MCD-202 and MCD-502, there were multiple amendments to the protocol. The 
majority were clarifications and administrative changes. There were also changes in endpoint hierarchy 
and endpoints added to the protocols. This is not considered to have a major impact on the data since 
the data are analysed in an integrated way across the clinical trials. Whether endpoints are primary or 
secondary is considered a formal issue and will not impact the assessment. There were no protocol 
deviations that are considered to have impacted the results. Some deviations considered dosing errors 
in the hospital setting or at home, but all of these were incidental and since fosdenopterin is 
administered daily over a prolonged period of time this is not considered an issue.  
The data cut-off is early (30 October 2020) relative to the submission date of the MAA. In the response 
to the LoQ, the applicant provided updated efficacy (OS, biomarkers) data which has been included in 
this overview.

Patient demographics were comparable between cPMP treated patients and the natural history control 
cohort. The genetic diagnosis was generally confirmed at a later age for the natural history patients. 
The median age of symptom onset is similar, with 1 day in the treated patients and 2 days in the 
natural history patients in the FAS. Fourteen treated patients presented with first MoCD symptoms in 
the first days (1-5) after birth. One late onset patient was enrolled after the initial data cut-off, with 
symptom onset at 12 months of age. Diagnosis was confirmed at 25 months of age. In the natural 
history cohort, four patients with symptom onset after 1 month of age, “late-onset” were enrolled, 
indicating less severe disease. This re-enforces the idea that a clear genotype-phenotype relation 
cannot be established, and the influence of epi-genetic factors on the efficacy of fosdenopterin cannot 
be ruled out. As it is considered impossible to correct for these factors – as they are unknown - this 
issue is not further pursued.  
Most patients experience seizures in utero or in the neonatal period. This is similar between treatment 
patients and the natural history controls. However, baseline % of seizures and the presence of feeding 
difficulties differs between treated patients and controls. It is assumed that the early initiation of 
treatment prevented onset of seizures and feeding difficulties, explaining the difference, but this 
cannot be confirmed. Most patients received their first treatment in the first days of life. However, 
there were some exceptions with the onset of treatment at day 32, 37 and 69, which is considered 
relatively late.  
All patients included in study MCD-501 received 240 ug/kg as the maximum dose. In study MCD-201 
and MCD-202, dose-escalation to 1200 and 1300 ug/kg was possible. This maximum dose was 
achieved by 4 patients in MCD-201 and two patients in MCD-202.  
The data were submitted as an integrated efficacy analysis across trials. All available data was also 
presented on a patient level. This approach is considered acceptable given the very limited number of 
patients included and the amount of missing data. This approach has also been agreed upon during the 
pre-submission meeting.  
In the cPMP treated cohort, 10 patients were ongoing on treatment and were alive at the data cut-off. 
Two patients treated in study MCD-501 had died. Three patients who had discontinued treatment were 
alive at the last contact. In the natural history cohort, 24/37 patients had died. Median OS was 4.2 
years for the natural history cohort and could not be estimated for the treated patients since there 
were not many events. There is a clear benefit of cPMP treatment on overall survival in the FAS which 
is supported by the sensitivity analysis in the GMAS and a worst and best-case analysis.  
There was a clear benefit of treatment on oral feeding. In the natural history cohort, the median time 
to sustained non-oral feeding was 10.5 months compared to 65 months in the treated cohort. The 
applicant reports a lower percentage of patients able to feed orally at the last visit in the treated group 
compared to the natural history controls (both in the FAS and GMAS).  
The data on weight, height and head circumference z-scores is numerically in favour of fosdenopterin, 
but the variation in both the natural history cohorts and treated patients is large. At one year of age, 
z-scores for head circumference are generally below zero in the natural history cohort. Growth is often 
delayed, but height and weight z-scored in the natural history cohort vary significantly. Review of the 
individual data shows that there is also a large variation within the cohort of treated patients for whom 
treatment is ongoing (n=10). Normal or near-normal head circumference was reported in 6/10 
patients.  
The GMFCS was used to assess gross motor function in the prospectively followed patients. Although 
this scale is not very sensitive to change (with 5 levels of gross motor function) and is developed for 
cerebral palsy, it is indicative of functional ability. Baseline motor function according was lower in the 
natural history cohort, but the age at which a baseline value was obtained was higher (mean: 103.5 vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 85/116 
 
 
 
41.7 months of age in the treated patients). Treatment was initiated in the first days of life. 
Consequently, at the moment of the baseline measurement for this specific parameter, patients were 
already treated for months to years, while the natural history control patients were untreated, possibly 
explaining the baseline difference. It can be concluded, however that the gross motor function of cPMP 
treated early onset MoCD type A patients is clearly better at the last visit than the natural history 
controls with 4/9 patients being ambulatory without restriction versus 1/11 natural history controls for 
whom data was available.  
Data from the Bayley scale was available for 9 cPMP treated patients prospectively followed in study 
MCD-201 and MCD-202. Four patients showed improvements in the score on three of the domains, the 
cognitive, fine motor, and gross motor domains. However, the relatively low scaled scores suggest a 
clear cognitive developmental delay, which is not completely prevented by fosdenopterin treatment. 
Furthermore, in the natural history controls for whom Bayley scores were available, very low 
functioning was recorded over all three domains. Given this, it is clear that at least for some patients, 
the cognitive and motor development clearly exceeds what can be expected based on natural history 
data. However, given the (substantial) developmental delay visible in most patients, it is expected that 
a progression will slow down until a plateau is reached which, dependent on baseline neurological 
damage, is below the level of their healthy peers.  
The late onset patient in study MCD-202 presented with a delay in cognitive development. After 1.5 
months of treatment with fosdenopterin, 7 months of progress was demonstrated in the patient’s 
cognitive skills.  
Based on the natural history, it is unlikely that children with MoCD type A achieve the motor milestone 
of sitting unassisted. In the cPMP treated group, data was available from 9 patients. Of these, 6 were 
able to sit unassisted for 30 seconds at any time during the study compared to 3/27 in the FAS and 
0/13 in the GMAS natural history controls for whom data was available. The late-onset patient enrolled 
in study MCD-202 was able to sit unassisted.  
Seizures are one of the first and most common presenting symptoms of MoCD type A. Only 3/37 
patients in the FAS and 1/19 patients in the GMAS is reported to be seizure-free. In approximately half 
of the patients in the natural history cohort, seizures are controlled on AED therapy. In the cPMP 
treated patients, seizures are not resolved in 5/14 patients. Four/14 patients are not on AED’s. The 
seizure data is difficult to interpret since seizure activity was scored by parents and not coherently 
presented in the listings. Therefore, it is unclear whether the number of seizures per day was stable or 
decreased on treatment and whether the number of seizures per day was less in the treated patients 
than in the natural history. In addition to the patients described above, the late-onset patient enrolled 
in study MCD-202 did not experience seizures at baseline or during the study. 
Due to the nature of the disease, neuronal damage occurs very early in life or even in utero. It is 
therefore not surprising that nearly all patients had abnormal neuroimaging results. The clinical impact 
of these findings is unknown and cannot be easily deduced from the presented findings. It is clear 
though, that fosdenopterin treatment does not reverse neuronal injury once present. Patients with 
MoCD type A often present with axial hypotonia and limb hypertonia. Patients in the natural history 
cohort for whom data was available nearly all presented with abnormal truncal and appendicular tone 
and deep tendon reflexes. At the last recorded assessment, patients in the treated group had better 
neurologic examinations; both compared to the FAS and GMAS historical controls even though the 
patients in the treated cohort were overall older at the last visit than the controls  
Efficacy parameters were compared between children treated before and after 14 days of age. 
Numbers are very small, 11/14 patients had initiated treatment within 14 days after birth and 3/14 
after. This makes it not possible to draw firm conclusions about the impact of treatment initiation on 
expected benefit. However, as MoCD is a progressive disease, it can be safely assumed that early 
Assessment report

Page 86/116 
 
 
 
treatment is always preferable. No clear trend could be observed with regard to survival. A positive 
trend of early treatment was observed on developmental parameters. Patients treated after day 14 all 
had seizures, not responsive to fosdenopterin treatment, which can be explained by the irreversible 
brain damage which has already occurred. The late onset patient from study MCD-202 was not 
included in this analysis.  
No effect of gender was observed on treatment efficacy. This is as expected given the disease 
pathology and mechanism of action of fosdenopterin.  
Taken together, of the 10 early onset patients treated with fosdenopterin, 5 patients clearly show a 
coherent overall picture of clinical benefit, which exceeds what can be expected based on natural 
history. These 5 patients were between 3.1 and 10.9 years of age at the data cut-off. These 5 patients 
are seizure-free without the need for AED’s. Four out of 5 are ambulatory without restrictions. One 
patient has a delay in gross motor development due to hemiplegia. All 5 patients are able to feed orally 
and show continued neurodevelopmental progress. Three out of 5 were diagnosed prenatally. All 
patients showed symptoms consistent with MoCD type A within the first day-week of life, but most did 
not have seizures and for none of these 5 patients, static encephalopathy was present at baseline. 
Treatment was initiated on day 1-9 for these patients.  
Seizures, static encephalopathy, or progressive brain damage on MRI were recorded at baseline for the 
other five patients. Despite early treatment initiation in some of these patients (two patients were 
treated later at respectively 37 and 69 days of age), clear overall clinical benefit is not present in these 
patients, although they were all still alive at data cut (with the exception of one patient in MCD-202 
who discontinued treatment and for whom survival status is not known). These patients have ongoing 
seizures that are not well controlled on AED’s and show severe motor and cognitive development delay 
consistent with static encephalopathy/microcephaly.  
For the 4 patients treated with rcPMP in study MCD-501 who did not enrol in study MCD-201, it is 
difficult to conclude their benefit from treatment. Two/four patients are deceased, and 2 discontinued 
treatment shortly after treatment initiation. No reason was recorded for treatment discontinuation, 
which hampers conclusions.  
Justification of the proposed dose  
No dedicated dose-finding study was performed. Instead, the dose is substantiated based on pre-
clinical findings, PK studies and clinical experience. Please refer to the respective sections for the 
assessment of the respective findings.  
Overall, the justification of the proposed posology is limited. The applicant assumes additional clinical 
benefit on top of normalization of plasma and urine biomarkers based on pre-clinical findings (see pre-
clinical AR). This implies that urine/plasma SSC levels, which show almost immediate decreases with 
lower doses in study MCD-501, is not the best marker to guide the optimal dose. The plateau effect on 
SSC levels is also visible in the E-R curves (see clinical pharmacology section). If additional benefit of 
the higher dose is assumed, it is questioned whether the relatively slow dose escalation (maximal dose 
is reached after only three months) is justified. However, this was the only dosing regimen studied. For 
the patients below 1 year of age, a starting dose recommendation is based on gestational age, which is 
acceptable based on the known differences in renal clearance between term and pre-term neonates.  
For patients above one year of age, no starting dose and escalation regimen is proposed, while it can 
be expected that treatment initiation in late onset patients occurs past 1 year of age. Given the near 
completion of the renal maturation at 1 year of age and the mild safety profile of fosdenopterin, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 87/116 
 
 
 
proposed posology is acceptable. Nevertheless, patients should be followed up in the proposed non-
interventional Post authorisation safety study (PASS).   
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on 
the clinical efficacy of Nulibry under normal conditions of use could not be considered comprehensive 
as due to the rarity of the studied conditions, active or placebo controlled studies of sufficient size are 
not feasible. In addition, the inclusion of late onset patients in the clinical data set submitted was 
limited. Due to these limitations it is not possible to establish robust conclusions on the efficacy of 
Nulibry. 
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
should be granted subject to a number of specific obligations, including a non-interventional PASS in 
order to further characterise the long-term safety and efficacy of Nulibry.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It can be concluded that fosdenopterin, in the proposed dose, has a beneficial effect on overall survival 
that exceeds survival of the natural history cohort. In part of the patients, the survival benefit was 
supported by a consistent overall clinical benefit compared to a natural history population, although a 
developmental delay compared to healthy peers is present for all patients in various degrees. The 
benefit consisted of conservation of the ability to feed orally, to grow, continued motor and cognitive 
development, prevention or stabilization of seizures, all indicative of a protective effect on the brain. As 
is expected for a disease with irreversible neuronal damage, early treatment before a significant injury 
has occurred will give the most benefit to patients. This is supported by the data that shows that 
benefit was limited in patients with extensive neuronal damage/static encephalopathy at baseline. 
Therefore, the treating physician should carefully consider the treatment of these patients based on 
the expected treatment benefit.  
The included patient population treated with rcPMP/fosdenopterin mainly had symptom onset in utero 
or shortly after birth and thus represent the severely affected patient population classically described 
for MoCD type A. One late-onset patient was included in the studies and one patient was treated in the 
named patient program. It is considered that the efficacy and safety can be extrapolated to late-onset 
patients based on the same underlying enzymatic defect and the mechanism of action of 
fosdenopterin. This conclusion is supported by the data of the late-onset patients treated with 
fosdenopterin. Nevertheless, it is considered valuable to obtain long term efficacy data via the 
proposed non-interventional PASS.   
Overall, the justification of the proposed posology is limited. It is uncertain whether patients are 
treated with the optimal dose. A higher dose was used in the phase 2/3 clinical studies based on pre-
clinical findings that indicated a beneficial effect past the normalization of the urine and plasma SSC 
levels. Dose escalation was used as a safety precaution and was the only dose regimen used in the 
studies. Pre-clinical studies give some reassurance that the starting dose of fosdenopterin will lead to a 
meaningful restoration of liver SOX activity. Therefore, in conclusion, the proposed posology is 
accepted.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
• 
In order to ensure adequate monitoring of safety and efficacy of Nulibry in the treatment of 
patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A, the MAH shall provide yearly 
updates on any new information concerning the safety and efficacy of Nulibry. 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 88/116 
 
 
 
•  Non-interventional Post authorisation safety study (PASS): In order to further characterise the 
long-term safety and efficacy of Nulibry, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of an 
observational, prospective study of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type 
A treated with Nulibry. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In study MCD-501, 15 patients were enrolled with suspected MoCD type A who were treated on a 
named patient basis with rcPMP (80-240 μg/kg per day). Ten of these patients were confirmed to have 
MoCD type A, four were diagnosed with MoCD type B and one had an unknown diagnosis. In study 
MCD-201, 8 patients were treated with fosdenopterin, all had previously received rcPMP. In the 
ongoing study MCD-202, five treatment naïve patients have been treated with fosdenopterin thus far. 
Three were confirmed to have MoCD type A, and two patients were diagnosed with MoCD type B. The 
dose of cPMP and fosdenopterin has been gradually increased over the course of the treatment for 
most patients, for the duration of treatment per quantity of the dose received for patients with MoCD 
type A, see Table 28. Patients with MoCD type B or an unknown diagnosis were treated between 3 and 
17 days before treatment was discontinued.

was 83.0 patient years. Median total time on cPMP was 1960 days (5.4 years) and ranged from 6◦days 
to 4896 days (13.4 years). Among the 11 patients who received fosdenopterin, median time on 
treatment as of the data cut-off for this safety update was 2316.0 days (6.3 years) and ranged from 9 
days to 7.6 years. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
A summary of the overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) is presented by study 
in Table 29. In study MCD-501, severity and causality were only collected for serious AEs (SAEs). Most 
patients in each study experienced at least one TEAE, including nine of 10 patients during treatment with 
rcPMP in Study MCD-501 and all 10 patients in Studies MCD-201 and MCD-202 during treatment with 
fosdenopterin. The majority of patients reported at least one SAE, including eight out of 10 of patients 
during  treatment  with  rcPMP  (Study  MCD-501)  and  9  out  of  10  patients  during  treatment  with 
fosdenopterin (Studies MCD-201 and MCD-202); for details, see section Serious adverse events, deaths, 
and other significant events below.

the SOC for these preferred terms (device dislocation and device leakage) was modified between these two versions of the dictionary. 
Seven of the 11 patients from studies MCD-201 and MCD-202 reported a TEAE of severe intensity. In 
study  MCD-201  TEAEs  of  severe  intensity  were  reported  in  four  patients;  all  four  had  severe  events 
relating to complications associated with the device used to infuse cPMP. Other severe events that were 
reported  were  mostly  viral  infections  and  respiratory  failure/infection.  In  study  MCD-202,  the  severe

events were apnoea, bacteraemia, pneumonia, and vomiting in one patient and seizure in the other. All 
severe events of both studies were assessed as unrelated to study treatment, except one report of device 
dislocation, which was assessed as probably related.  
Device-related complications 
Eight of ten patients treated with fosdenopterin experienced at least one device-related adverse event. 
The  events  reported  in  more  than  one  patient  included  complications  associated  with  the  device  (7 
patients), device dislocation and catheter site infection (3 patients each), catheter site extravasation, 
catheter  site  pain,  central  venous  catheterization,  catheter  site  discharge,  device  leakage,  device 
occlusion, bacteraemia, sepsis, and vascular device infection (2 patients each). 
Skin Disorders 
Overall, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were reported in five out of 10 patients in study MCD-
501, seven out of 8 patients in study MCD-201, and one out of 2 patients in study MCD-202. The 
events within the skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC reported in >1 patient overall were rash 
(three patients) and dermatitis, eczema, maculo-papular rash, and skin disorder (verbatim term: skin 
defect nearby port central venous line with the risk of dislocation) (two patients each). The event of 
skin disorder (study MCD-201) was assessed as serious and severe in intensity.  
Treatment related TEAEs 
In study MCD-501, causality was only collected for SAEs. One SAE reported during treatment with 
rcPMP was considered possibly treatment-related; this was necrotizing colitis, which resulted in the 
patient’s death (see section Serious adverse events, deaths, and other significant events for details). 
In study MCD-201, one patient experienced a TEAE of catheter site inflammation that was moderate in 
severity and a TEAE of device dislocation that was severe; both AEs were assessed by the Investigator 
as probably related to study drug. In study MCD-202 no TEAEs were assessed as being treatment-
related by the Investigator. 
Phototoxicity 
One notable safety concern (i.e., a potential risk of phototoxicity) was identified in the nonclinical 
toxicology program. In vitro and in vivo animal studies demonstrated phototoxic effects of 
fosdenopterin. Although there was no evidence of phototoxicity in the clinical studies, potential 
phototoxicity was identified late in the nonclinical program; thus, the clinical studies did not include 
specific monitoring procedures for phototoxicity. During clinical studies up until the cut-off date of 31 
October 2021 there have been two reports of skin related AEs which are possibly related to 
phototoxicity. However, causality to fosdenopterin treatment cannot be established.  
AEs in patients later diagnosed not to have MoCD type A 
The patients in studies MCD-501 and MCD-202 who were suspected of having MoCD type A but were 
later diagnosed not to have MoCD type A, were treated with cPMP relatively short (range: 3-17 days). 
Among the five patients in study MCD-501 with MoCD Type B or with an unknown type, one patient 
with MoCD Type B experienced TEAEs. The reported events in this patient included tachycardia, oral 
candidiasis, and stridor; all events were non-serious.  
In study MCD-202, one patient was enrolled based on a suspected diagnosis of MoCD Type A. All 
TEAEs in this patient were assessed as unrelated to study treatment. The patient was discontinued 
from treatment on day 17 after genetic testing failed to confirm the diagnosis of MoCD Type A.

AEs in healthy adults of study MCD-101 
Overall, TEAEs, both related and unrelated to treatment, were reported at similar incidence rates 
between subjects treated with fosdenopterin and placebo in the clinical study MCD-101. The majority 
of TEAEs were mild in intensity, most resolved spontaneously, and all were resolved by the end of the 
study. No TEAEs led to discontinuation or death, and no severe or life-threatening TEAEs occurred 
during the study. There was one SAE reported in a placebo-treated subject.  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  study  MCD-501  eight  out  of  10  patients  and  in  in  studies  MCD-201  and  MCD-202  nine  out  of  10 
patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent SAE. All SAEs reported across the three studies 
are summarized by MedDRA SOC and the preferred term in Table 31. 
The most commonly reported types of SAEs were device/catheter-related events and infections. Most 
SAEs were reported in only one patient. SAEs by MedDRA PT reported in more than one patient in study 
MCD-501 were device-related infection (three patients); and pneumonia, sepsis, device-related sepsis, 
pyrexia,  medical  device  complication,  and  device  dislocation  (two  patients  each).  In  patients  who 
received fosdenopterin, SAEs reported in more than one patient were complications associated with the 
device (five patients), pneumonia (three patients), and pyrexia, lower respiratory tract infection, catheter 
site infection, central venous catheterization, vascular device infection, viral infection, and bacteraemia 
(two patients each). 
All  but one  SAE  were  considered  by  the  Investigators  to  be  unrelated  to  study  treatment.  One  event 
reported during treatment with rcPMP in study MCD-501 was considered possibly treatment-related. The 
reported event was necrotizing colitis, which resulted in the patient’s death. There were no treatment-
related SAEs in studies MCD-201 and MCD-202. There were no hypersensitivity or acute infusion-related 
reactions associated with the administration of cPMP in any patient.

a    Coding was conducted using MedDRA version 17.0 in Study MCD-501 and MedDRA version 21.1 in studies 
MCD-201 and MCD-202; the SOC for these preferred terms (device dislocation and device leakage) was modified 
between these two versions of the dictionary. 
Deaths 
There were two deaths reported in Study MCD-501 in patients with MoCD type A and one death in a 
patient with MoCD Type B.  
No deaths were reported during treatment with fosdenopterin in studies MCD-201 and MCD-202; nine 
of 10 patients in these studies were ongoing on treatment as of the data cut-off (31 October 2020). 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
In study MCD-501, the number of patients with haematology and chemistry data available was limited 
and are not shown. In the two prospective studies, MCD-201 and MCD-202 shift analyses from 
baseline to last visit based on the normal range were conducted for haematology and for chemistry 
parameters and are described briefly below. 
Haematology 
In study MCD-201, most patients showed no shifts in erythrocyte count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, 
Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets. 
Shifts from normal to high values were observed for platelets in one of eight patients and for MCV in 
two of seven patients. Five out of eight patients in study MCD-201 had shifted from normal to low 
values in haemoglobin, erythrocytes, neutrophils, haematocrit, MCV, and/or leukocytes. 
In study MCD-202: shifts from normal to low lymphocytes were seen in one patient, and shifts from 
normal to low erythrocytes, haematocrit, haemoglobin and shifts from normal to high platelets were 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 96/116 
 
 
 
seen in another patient. This study noted no shifts to low or high values for MCV, leukocytes, and 
neutrophils. 
In study MCD-501, two patients had laboratory-related abnormalities assessed as significant and 
reported as AEs. In addition, two patients experienced anaemia on day 5 and day 7 after initiation of 
rcPMP treatment, respectively. Unfortunately, no information was available in either patient record 
regarding the resolution of the anaemia. 
Chemistry 
In study MCD-201: most patients showed no shifts in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, sodium, potassium, chloride and 
creatinine.  
Shifts from normal to high values were observed for ALT and AST in one of eight patients, for chloride 
in one of seven patients, and for creatinine in one of eight patients. Shifts from normal to low values 
were observed for ALT in one of eight patients, for AST in two of seven patients, for ALP in two of eight 
patients, for creatinine in one of eight patients, and chloride in one of seven patients.  
In study MCD-202: 
At the last assessment, one of the two patients experienced a shift in sodium from normal (136 
mmol/L) to low (134 mmol/L; normal range: 136 – 145 mmol/L). No shifts to low or high values were 
noted for ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, potassium, chloride, and creatinine. 
Electrocardiograms 
In  section  2.5.2.3.  Safety  pharmacology  programme,  results  from  the  non-clinical  studies  on 
cardiovascular safety are described. 
Cardiac safety has been and is observed in clinical studies MCD-101, MCD-501, MCD-201 and MCD-202 
through the monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities.  
An analysis of ECG results from the MCD-101 study (where single ascending doses of fosdenopterin were 
administered to healthy adults) showed that a 10 ms prolongation of the heart-rate corrected QT interval 
was excluded up to ~7000 ng/mL. 
In study MCD-202, ECGs were performed at screening/baseline when feasible, on Day 28; at months 3, 
6, 9, 12, 24, and 36; and any safety  follow-up visit or early termination visit, if applicable, or as per 
Safety  Review  Committee  (SRC)  recommendation.  Up  to  the  data  cut-off,  no  clinically  significant 
abnormal ECG findings have been reported. 
In  study  MCD-501,  One  patient  experienced  tachycardia  that  was  not  assessed  as  serious.  Another 
patient presented with an abnormal sinus rhythm, which was considered clinically significant. However, 
no follow-up information is available. 
In study MCD-202, two patients had cardiac-related disorders reported as TEAEs, including moderate 
cyanosis and moderate tachycardia (Cardiac Disorders SOC) in one patient and mild heart rate increased 
(Investigations SOC) in another patient. None of these events were assessed as treatment-related.  
In  the  natural  history  study  MCD-502,  cardiac  abnormalities  were  reported  as  “clinically  significant 
medical  events”  for  nine  patients  with  MoCD  Type  A,  including  four  patients  with  tachycardia,  two 
patients with data collected retrospectively and two with data collected prospectively. 
The applicant conducted a blinded, randomized, single dose, crossover thorough qt study to evaluate 
the effects of fosdenopterin on cardiac repolarization in healthy subjects. Single IV dose was tested of 
1.2 mg/kg fosdenopterin HBr dihydrate, which corresponds to 0.9 mg/kg free base, the maximum dose 
Assessment report

Page 97/116 
 
 
 
proposed in the label. It is stated that in the by-time point analysis of QTcF, no clinically relevant effect 
was observed. LS mean ΔQTcF on fosdenopterin very closely followed the placebo pattern across post-
dose time points and the largest mean ΔΔQTcF of 2.2 ms was observed at 24 hours post-dose. 
Using a concentration-QTc approach, The effect on ΔΔQTcF can be predicted to -0.40 ms (90% CI: -
2.45, 1.64) for fosdenopterin (6408.0 ng/mL).  
2.6.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety 
Not applicable. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
Due to the rarity of the disease and the small size of study population, subgroup safety analyses based 
on intrinsic factors (such as age, sex and race) have not been conducted. 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
No information has been collected in the clinical studies on the formation of antibodies directed against 
cPMP.  
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Due to the rarity of the disease and the small size of study population, subgroup safety analyses based 
on extrinsic factors such as concomitant medication use, diet, etc., were not conducted. To date, drug-
drug interactions have not been evaluated for fosdenopterin. 
Fosdenopterin is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes in vitro. It is 
considered  unlikely  that  coadministration  of  fosdenopterin  will  affect  systemic  exposure  of  other  CYP 
substrates. In general, the probability of drug-drug interaction with fosdenopterin is regarded as low. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
During study MCD-501, two patients with MoCD Type A died while receiving rcPMP and two other 
patients were reported as no longer receiving rcPMP; reasons for discontinuation were reported to be 
due to “abnormal imaging” or “poor neurologic prognosis”. In study MCD-202, one patient was 
reported to have discontinued treatment due to the physician’s decision; this patient received 
fosdenopterin for 9 days. In the healthy adult volunteer study MCD-101, no TEAEs led to 
discontinuation or death.  
As of the data cut-off date of the D90 update report, ten of the 15 patients remained on treatment 
with fosdenopterin, including eight patients in study MCD-201 and two patients in study MCD-202. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Limited post-marketing data was available. As of 31 October 2021, 13 patients have received 
fosdenopterin under named patient use. Four patients were ongoing on treatment at the data cut-off, 
the reasons for discontinuations were similar as seen in the clinical studies (poor neurological 
prognosis and MoCD type A diagnosis not confirmed). The reported SAEs were related to complications 
and infections associated with the central line.  
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 98/116 
 
 
 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Fosdenopterin is a first-in-class cPMP hydrobromide dihydrate intended to be used for (paediatric) 
patients with MoCD Type A, who have a genetic deficiency in the MOCS1 gene and are unable to 
produce cPMP.  
The safety analysis for fosdenopterin is based on data from 4 clinical studies. The safety population is 
small, it consists of 18 healthy adult volunteers from study MCD-101 and 21 paediatric patients (of 
whom 15 had MoCD type A) from retrospective study MCD-501 and two prospective studies MCD-201 
and MCD-202. The number of subjects is very low, which is plausible considering the rarity of the 
disease. Nevertheless, it is therefore challenging to fully characterise the safety of fosdenopterin. 
Furthermore, the retrospective nature of study MCD-501 signifies that less safety data is available for 
study MCD-501 compared to the other three studies. In the D90 update report, safety data was 
submitted with the cut-off date of 31 October 2021. Further information about the long-term safety of 
Nulibry will be collected via a non-interventional PASS. 
As of the cut-off date for this MAA submission, 15 neonatal and paediatric patients with MoCD type A 
have received rcPMP and/or fosdenopterin, of whom 10 patients are currently still receiving 
fosdenopterin in studies MCD-201 and MCD-202. In addition, 6 paediatric patients later diagnosed as 
not having MoCD type A received cPMP, though this was done for a limited time. Overall  exposure to 
cPMP, from the first documented dose of rcPMP to the last dose of fosdenopterin as of 31 October 2021 
across the 15 treated patients, was 83.0 patient-years, which is quite extensive. The median total time 
on cPMP was 1960 days (5.4 years) and ranged from 6 to 4896 days (13.4 years).  
The treated patients that were included in the clinical studies thus far were primarily early onset 
patients, i.e. patients who presented with symptoms in utero, or shortly after birth, corresponding to 
the severely affected patient population. One late-onset patient was included during the update period. 
As discussed in the clinical efficacy section, is it considered appropriate to extrapolate safety data from 
early to late onset patients.  
Since both prospective and retrospective data were collected, and safety reporting specifications were 
quite variable in the different protocols, safety data across studies were not pooled. Instead, side-by-
side comparisons of safety data obtained from studies MCD-201, MCD-202 and MCD-501 (patients with 
MoCD Type A) were made. This approach is acceptable.  
Adverse Events 
The single treatment arm studies make it difficult to disentangle whether an adverse event is due to 
treatment with cPMP, MoCD type A disease, its complications, or natural occurring common childhood 
diseases. However, given that the most reported Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAES) in the 
three studies were in the SOC domain of ‘Infections and infestations’ and in the SOC domain ‘General 
disorders and administration site conditions’ (mostly pyrexia and complications associated with 
device), it is plausible that a substantial part of the TEAEs are attributable to the complications 
associated with the central line used to infuse cPMP and/or to background childhood diseases. This is 
reflected by the frequency of reported viral infections (0% in study MCD-501, 62.5% in study MCD-
201, 33.3% in study MCD-202), pneumonia (30% in study MCD-501, 37.5% in study MCD-201, 33.3% 
in study MCD-202) and influenza (0% in study MCD-501, 50% in study MCD-201, 0% in study MCD-
202). It is acknowledged that patients in need of long-term indwelling catheters (such as the Port-a-
Cath used in these children) will often suffer from device-related complications, such as sepsis. 
Children with MoCD type A have difficulties with oral feeding. This may have caused the high frequency 
of MedRA system organ class (SOC) gastrointestinal disorders (40% in study MCD-501, 75% in study 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 99/116 
 
 
 
MCD-201, 50% in study MCD-202) that are seen in the studies. On the PT level, these were: vomiting, 
diarrhoea, abdominal pain and constipation. 
In study MCD-501, causality to treatment was only determined for SAEs. In study MCD-202 there were 
no TEAEs assessed to be related to treatment and in study MCD-201 there were two TEAEs assessed to 
be related to treatment in one patient (device dislocation and catheter site inflammation). In all three 
studies many of the TEAEs were related to (the complications associated with) the device, however 
most were not assessed as treatment-related by the Investigator, this appears to be a matter of how 
the Investigator assesses the AE, ‘treatment-related’ or ‘device-related’.   
The TEAEs observed in 6 patients of the MCD-501 and MCD-202 studies who were later diagnosed not 
to have MoCD type A, were most likely caused by the underlying disease, rather than by cPMP 
treatment. 
Skin disorders, phototoxicity and antibodies  
One safety concern for fosdenopterin has been identified in the non-clinical toxicology program, i.e. 
fosdenopterin was found to have phototoxic effects in in vitro and in vivo animal studies. During the 
clinical studies up until the cut-off date of 31 October 2021 there have been two reports of potential 
skin AEs related to sun exposure, however, causality cannot be determined.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
The most commonly reported types of SAEs were device-related events and infections and can be 
linked to either common childhood diseases and/or the complications associated with the central line 
used to infuse cPMP. The majority of the SAEs were assessed to be mild or moderate. There was one 
SAE (a case of necrotizing colitis) assessed by the Investigator as possibly related to treatment. The 
causality with treatment is considered uncertain. The underlying MoCD disorder and resulting seizures, 
hypotension and hypertension events, probably leading to poor blood flow in the intestinal tissue is 
likely to have instigated the necrotizing enterocolitis. One case of erosive oesophagitis and Barret’s 
oesophagus have been detected. This was assessed as probably related to gastric reflux. This 
explanation is considered plausible.  
Laboratory findings 
There is limited haematology and chemistry data available from study MCD-501. For studies MCD-201 
and MCD-202, shift analyses have been performed. Notably, 4 out of 10 patients experienced shifts 
from normal to low erythrocytes levels and 3 out of 10 patients had shifted from normal to low in 
haemoglobin level. In addition, two patients in study MCD-501 were reported to have AEs classified as 
anaemia. No clear relationship has been observed between the transient shifts in haemoglobin, 
platelets and erythrocytes and either concurrent infections or fosdenopterin dosing.  
Some patients in study MCD-201 experienced transient increases in various chemistry parameters, one 
patient shifted from a normal creatinine value of 29 µmol/L to a high value of 71 µmol/L at last visit. 
One patient, had (< 3x ULN) increased ALT and AST values on the last visit. All events were mild and 
resolved without dose reductions.  
Cardiac safety 
Based on the monitoring of ECG abnormalities in the clinical studies, there is no concern for cardiac 
safety in relation to cPMP treatment. The results from the MCD-101 study showing that a 10 ms 
prolongation of the heart-rate corrected QT interval was excluded up to ~7000 ng/mL are reassuring 
and are in agreement with the EMA guideline CHMP/ICH/2/04 (The clinical evaluation of QT/QTc 
interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs). In addition, there 
were no TEAEs related to ECG abnormalities in the 15 patients with MoCD Type A included in studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 100/116 
 
 
 
MCD-501, MCD-201 or MCD-202. The cardiac abnormalities seen in 9 out of 37 patients with MoCD 
type A in the natural history study MCD-502 suggest that any cardiac problems seen in MoCD type A 
patients are likely related to the disease itself rather than to cPMP treatment. A cardiac safety report 
was submitted with the D90 responses based on the FDA request for a thorough QT study. A single IV 
dose was tested of 1.2 mg/kg fosdenopterin HBr dihydrate, corresponding to 0.9 mg/kg free base, the 
maximum dose proposed in the label. It is stated that no clinically relevant effect was observed in the 
by-time point analysis of QTcF. LS mean ΔQTcF on fosdenopterin very closely followed the placebo 
pattern across post-dose time points and the largest mean ΔΔQTcF of 2.2 ms was observed at 24 
hours post-dose. 
Using a concentration-QTc approach, the effect on ΔΔQTcF can be predicted to -0.40 ms (90% CI: -
2.45, 1.64) for fosdenopterin (6408.0 ng/mL). Since the upper bound of the 90% CI does not exceed 
10 ms, the conclusion that there is not clinically relevant effect on ECG parameters can be endorsed.  
Subgroup analyses and in vitro biomarker tests  
It is unknown whether specific subgroups would have distinct safety data after treatment with 
fosdenopterin. Considering the small number of MoCD type A patients, it is understandable that there 
were no subgroup analyses. In view of the rarity of the disease, also no in vitro biomarker tests have 
been developed. It is not expected that there would be patients with a different safety profile. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on 
the clinical safety of Nulibry under normal conditions of use could not be considered comprehensive as 
due to the rarity of the studied conditions, active or placebo controlled studies of sufficient size are not 
feasible. In addition, with a safety database of 15 treated MoCD type A patients, the number of 
patients is very limited. Even though safety follow-up duration in the clinical data set is considered 
quite extensive, safety in older children has not been shown. Due to these limitations it is not possible 
to establish robust conclusions on the safety of Nulibry. 
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
should be granted subject to a number of specific obligations, including a non-interventional PASS in 
order to further characterise the long-term safety and efficacy of Nulibry.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Fosdenopterin seems to be a relatively safe therapy with a manageable safety profile. The most 
commonly reported types of (overall and serious) adverse events were related to central line 
complications and respiratory tract and viral infections that are also frequently observed in otherwise 
healthy children. Since fosdenopterin is identical to endogenous cPMP, the safety profile is expected to 
be mild, in line with the observations from clinical studies. Although there are no clear indications from 
the clinical studies that fosdenopterin is phototoxic, it cannot be ruled out. A warning in section 4.4. of 
the SmPC is therefore considered appropriate.  
Fosdenopterin is meant as a lifelong treatment. Given the limited size of the safety database and the 
limited inclusion of late onset patients, the applicant has committed to instate a post-marketing non-
interventional PASS in order to address long term safety including safety in late-onset patients.   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances:

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 0.7 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 26.02.2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nulibry (fosdenopterin) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and as the marketing authorisation is 
approved under exceptional circumstances.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed therapeutic indication is treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency 
(MOCD) type A. 
MOCD is an ultra-rare, rapidly progressive, chronic, and mostly fatal, autosomal recessive inborn error 
of metabolism. Two-thirds of MoCD patients have Type A, and the remainder have type B or C, 
depending on the deficient gene. The different types of MoCD are indistinguishable clinically and 
biochemically, and the diagnosis of the specific type of MoCD is confirmed with genetic diagnostics. 
Due to mutations in the MOCS1 gene, patients with MoCD type A completely lack MOCS1A/B enzyme 
activity with no formation of cPMP. cPMP is a substrate essential for the synthesis of molybdenum 
cofactor (MoCo). Without MoCo, there is a deficiency in MoCo dependent enzymes such as sulphite 
oxidase (SOX) and xanthine oxidase. SOX deficiency leads to the accumulation of neurotoxic sulphites 
and s-sulphocysteine (SSC) which can result in significant, irreversible structural damage to the brain. 
MOCD typically exhibits an acute onset in neonates or in early infancy, although milder/late-onset 
forms are also reported with onset of symptoms after the first month(s) of life.  
Characteristics of the disease include intractable seizures, burst suppression or multifocal epileptic 
electroencephalogram (EEG), abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, metabolic 
acidosis, exaggerated startle reactions, axial hypotonia, limb hypertonia, gross destruction of the 
brain, failure to thrive, poor or halted feeding response, and high-pitch crying. These characteristics 
collectively precede rapidly progressive neurodegeneration.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Given that there is no approved treatment for MoCD Type A in the EU, there is a clear unmet medical 
need in this patient population. Current treatment options are symptom-driven to provide relief from 
clinical manifestations of the disease (e.g., antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizures) and supportive 
care, such as placement of a feeding tube. Patients often suffer from epilepsy which is refractory to 
AED therapy. The available symptomatic treatment options have no impact on the progressive 
neurologic injury related to elevated levels of SSC.  
The most recent incidence estimates are within the range of one in 300,000-400,000. The estimated 
prevalence in the EU of MoCD type A is 0.005 per 10,000 inhabitants.  
In the absence of treatment, patients usually die within the first years of life. The median survival of 
MoCD type A is approximately 3 years.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant conducted 5 clinical studies to support the proposed indication. Three clinical studies 
were conducted, 1 with recombinant cPMP (rcPMP, in study MCD-501) and 2 with fosdenopterin (cPMP, 
in studies MCD-201 and MCD-202). rcPMP and fosdenopterin have the same active moiety (see quality 
section); therefore, both molecules are not expected to act differently and are considered to be 
therapeutically equivalent.  
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 106/116 
 
 
 
Two studies (study MCD-502 and MCD-503) were aimed at collecting retrospective data to form a 
natural history comparator cohort for the integrated efficacy analysis.  
In the retrospective study MCD-501, 10 patients were enrolled and treated with rcPMP in a named 
patient program. Of those patients, 6 enrolled in study MCD-201 where they were switched to 
fosdenopterin. Two additional patients were enrolled in MCD-201 who were pre-treated with rcPMP in a 
named patient program. Three MoCD type A patients were enrolled in study MCD-202, for two 
treatment is still ongoing. These studies recorded plasma and urine biomarkers, survival, seizure 
activity, feeding status, developmental aspects, and neurological examinations to provide efficacy and 
safety data for a totality of evidence approach.  
The pivotal evidence comes from the integrated efficacy analysis from study MCD-501, MCD-201, 
MCD-202 and natural history studies MCD-502 and MCD-503; comparing 15 cPMP treated patients with 
37 natural history controls (FAS). Analysis of the FAS was supported by data of the GMAS, where the 
15 treated patients were compared to 19 genotypically matched controls.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
cPMP treatment led to the normalization of urinary SSC levels. Mean urinary SSC at baseline was 166.3 
µmol/mmol creatinine versus 8.6 µmol/mmol creatinine at the last visit in the treated patients and 
136.3 µmol/mmol creatinine at baseline versus 156.6 µmol/mmol creatinine for the natural history 
controls.  
At 1 year of age, survival probability was 93.3% in the treated patients versus 75.3% in the natural 
history controls (FAS). This data is supported by the data from the GMAS, in which the survival 
probability at 1 year of age was 93.3% for the treated group and 68.4% for the genotypically matched 
natural history controls.  
In the FAS, nine of the 15 treated patients (60%) and 10 of the 33 untreated patients (30.3%) with 
data available for analysis were able to feed orally at the last recorded visit. Results in the GMAS were 
consistent with the FAS. For this matched population, only four (22.2%) of 18 untreated patients with 
data available were able to feed orally at the last assessment. The median time to sustained non-oral 
feeding was considerably longer at 75.0 months for treated patients compared with 10.5 months for 
untreated controls (FAS). 
At the last visit, mean and median z-scores for the untreated control patients were numerically lower 
relative to the cPMP-treated patients for each of the growth parameters. Median z-scores at the last 
assessment were: -0.34 and -0.63 for weight for treated patients and untreated controls, respectively; 
-0.86 and -1.37, respectively, for height; and -0.70 and -1.91, respectively, for head circumference. 
At the last assessment prior to the MAA data cut-off, a higher percentage of patients receiving 
fosdenopterin who had data available were ambulatory (4/9, 44.4%) (i.e., assessed as a Level I on the 
GMFCS-ER) compared with the untreated controls (1/11, 9.1%). In the GMAS, all seven (100%) of the 
matched control patients with data available were non-ambulatory (Level V).  
Five of the ten prospectively followed patients showed improvements in the fine motor, gross motor 
and cognitive domains of the Bayley scales of infant development, whereas patients in the natural 
history control group consistently scored low on all three domains.  
By 12 months of age, three of the seven treated patients (42.9%) with data available were able to sit 
unassisted for 30 seconds compared with three of the 27 untreated control patients (11.1%). The 
ability to sit unassisted at any time was reported for seven of the ten treated patients (70%) and three 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 107/116 
 
 
 
of the 27 untreated controls (11.1%) in the FAS for whom data are available; none of the matched 
control patients in the GMAS could sit unassisted at any time.  
At the last visit, 5/15 patients in the treated group had no seizures, compared to 4/37 control patients 
in the FAS. In the GMAS, 1/19 patients had no seizures ongoing at the last visit.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The number of patients in the clinical study program is low, with 15 cPMP treated patients and 37 
natural history controls; together with the open-label character of the studies, this hampers the 
conclusions.  
In the primary analysis (FAS), treated patients are not matched to natural history controls. In the 
GMAS, individual matching is based on genotype. For MoCD type A, no clear genotype-phenotype 
relationship has been described, the true value of this matching criterion remains uncertain.  
Baseline differences were observed for the occurrence of seizures, and the presence of feeding 
difficulties differs between treated patients and controls. Since treated patients were sometimes 
diagnosed prenatally and treatment was initiated early, it is unclear whether the baseline 
characteristics are comparable.  
It is unclear whether the number of seizures per day was stable or decreased on treatment and 
whether the number of seizures per day was less in the treated patients than in the natural history.  
No dedicated dose-finding study was performed. Instead, the dose is substantiated based on pre-
clinical findings, PK studies and clinical experience. There are several uncertainties with regard to the 
dose-finding and the proposed posology. The applicant assumes additional clinical benefit on top of 
normalization of plasma and urine biomarkers based on pre-clinical findings (see pre-clinical AR). This 
implies that urine/plasma SSC levels, which show almost immediate decreases with lower doses in 
study MCD-501, are not the best marker for dosing. However, an alternative biomarker is not currently 
available. The plateau effect on SSC levels is also visible in the E-R curves (see clinical pharmacology 
section).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Most common TEAEs throughout the three studies were device-related AEs: complications associated 
with the device (7 out of 15 patients), such as device dislocation and catheter site infection (3 patients 
each), and catheter site extravasation, catheter site pain, central venous catheterization, catheter site 
discharge, device leakage, device occlusion, bacteraemia, sepsis, and vascular device infection (2 
patients each).  
Other common TEAs were events in the Infections and Infestations domain, notably viral infections 
(0% in study MCD-501, 62.5% in study MCD-201, 50% in study MCD-202), pneumonia (30% in study 
MCD-501, 37.5% in study MCD-201, 50% in study MCD-202) and influenza (0% in study MCD-501, 
50% in study MCD-201, 0% in study MCD-202). 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were reported in five out of 10 patients in study MCD-501, 
seven out of 8 patients in Study MCD-201, and one out of 2 patients in study MCD-202. The events 
within the skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC reported in >1 patient overall were rash (three 
patients) and dermatitis, eczema, maculo-papular rash and skin disorder (two patients each). 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 108/116 
 
 
 
In study MCD-501 three deaths were reported. Two of them were in patients with MoCD type A. There 
was one death in a patient with MoCD Type B, who died more than 2 years after discontinuation of 
rcPMP treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety population from the clinical studies is small, 21 paediatric patients (15 with MoCD type A) 
and 18 healthy adult volunteers. In addition, the clinical study MCD-501 was conducted 
retrospectively, and less safety data is available for this study, as in the study MCD-501 causality to 
treatment was only assessed for SAEs. Therefore, a full characterisation of the safety assessment is 
challenging. 
In the non-clinical toxicology program, fosdenopterin was found to have phototoxic effects. In the 
clinical studies, there have been no reports of phototoxicity. Nevertheless, potential phototoxicity 
cannot be completely ruled out.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The proposed indication encompasses all patients with MoCD type A. Although limited data is available 
from patients with late onset MoCD type A (defined by the applicant as onset after 1.5 months of age), 
it is considered that efficacy and safety data can be extrapolated based on the similar underlying 
enzymatic defect and the mechanism of action of fosdenopterin. Data from two late-onset patients 
treated with fosdenopterin support the benefit and safety in these patients, however, because of the 
very small number of late-onset patients, the clinical efficacy in late-onset patients is uncertain. 
Nevertheless, since there is consistency of effect across different domains, this is not of major concern.   
Clinical benefit is shown in overall survival. Survival is an important favourable effect given the short 
life expectancy of children with MoCD type A. Analysis of the FAS, GMAS and the best and worst-case 
sensitivity analyses show a consistent effect in favour of fosdenopterin. The survival data in the 
fosdenopterin population is therefore considered to be robust. However, it should be acknowledged 
that in the comparison an external, retrospectively collected natural history control has been used that 
inherently leads to a biased comparative estimate.   
As was also stressed in the scientific advice (SA) procedures, the benefit of survival should be 
supported by a consistent improvement across different domains which are representative of the 
health status of a young child. The integrated efficacy results show positive effects of treatment on 
growth, feeding, seizures, cognitive and motor development. All endpoints are considered to represent 
aspects of the disease which are considered to have a severe impact on the quality of life. It is 
important to view the results in a totality of evidence approach.  
The observation that consistent clinical benefit across all domains is observed in part of the patients is 
reassuring. Of the 15 patients treated with cPMP, 10 patients are ongoing on treatment. Of those, 5 
patients show a consistent improvement across all domains. These 5 patients are seizure-free, can 
feed orally; the majority is ambulatory without restriction and within the normal range with regard to 
growth. Continued cognitive development is observed in these patients. One patient entered the trial 
with late onset MoCD type A and showed improvements in cognitive development upon treatment 
initiation. The other 4 patients entered the trial with severe neurological damage/static 
encephalopathy. This clearly shows that treatment with fosdenopterin is not able to reverse brain 
damage that has already occurred. In addition, even though the results clearly exceed what can be 
expected based on the natural history, treated patients, to a varying degree, show a delay in 
development compared to their healthy peers. The data indicate that with fosdenopterin treatment, 
existing functions are preserved and disease progression is halted, but the baseline condition of the 
patient dictates treatment outcome. This is important since it is essential to inform treating physicians 
and parents about the treatment benefit, which can be expected to enable an informed decision on 
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 110/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whether treatment should be initiated. This can be handled with appropriate warnings and presentation 
of the results in the SmPC.  
The justification of the posology is limited. In the named patient program, patients were treated with a 
maximum dose of 240 µg/kg, leading to pronounced decreases in urine SSC levels. Based on 
preclinical studies, which showed that approximately 4-fold and 2-fold doses were necessary for a full 
restoration of liver SOX activity and normalization of brain SSC levels, respectively, dose escalation to 
1200 µg/kg/day was instated in the following phase 2/3 studies. The mechanism behind a clinical 
benefit beyond the normalization of plasma SSC is not completely clear. This is of importance since the 
impact of underdosing is therefore difficult to establish. Although exposure-response graphical analysis 
shows lower plasma SSC levels also in the higher exposure range, the uncertainties regarding the Pop 
PK model complicate the usability of PK data to support the proposed dose. A dose escalation to a fixed 
maximum dose, as proposed by the applicant, is usually applicable for treatments where tolerability is 
an issue or where the dose is individually titrated based on a specific biomarker. For fosdenopterin, this 
is not the case. However, since the proposed posology is the only dosing regimen that has been 
studied and considering the efficacy and favourable safety profile, the proposed posology for patients 
below 1 year of age can be approved. A divergent dosing regimen without dose escalation is proposed 
for the patients initiating treatment above 1 year of age, based on the mild safety profile and near 
complete renal maturation after this age. Since no conclusive data is available in these patients 
justifying either a dose recommendation with dose escalation or without escalation, this can be 
accepted. Nevertheless, it is considered important to follow-up these patients in the non-interventional 
PASS, for which an outline has been submitted.  
Although pharmacokinetic data in paediatric population is scarce, it is consistent with the healthy adult 
population.  
The clinical studies are all open-label single-arm trials, comparing the observed efficacy to the natural 
history cohort from study MCD-502. This is understandable given the rare nature and the rapid 
progression of the disease. In addition, early named-patient use gave indications that the treatment 
might be effective, rendering further controlled trials unethical. Inherently, the use of an external 
natural history control gives rise to issues. In this case, the primary analysis compared the treated 
patient to the entire cohort of 37 MoCD type A patients. The control group seems more heterogeneous 
than the treated cohort, but there is no clear indication that the control group has a more severe or 
milder disease burden overall. Demographically, the treated and control group was similar. Overall, 
age at onset of symptoms was similar between treated and control patients. However, the baseline 
incidence of seizures and feeding difficulties was lower in the treated cohort. The early treatment in the 
fosdenopterin treated patients has likely prevented the onset of these symptoms in the natural history 
controls. As it is assumed that the age of onset of first symptoms is one of the main baseline 
prognostic factors for disease progression, the cohorts are considered comparable.   
In an additional analysis, treated patients were matched to one or more genotypically matched 
patients (GMAS). Since the genotype-phenotype relationship for MoCD type A is not well described, the 
value of this analysis is unclear. Therefore, it is assessed as a supportive analysis to the primary 
analysis in the FAS. For most efficacy parameters, the difference between the treated and control 
cohort in the GMAS was more pronounced than in the FAS. This is reassuring and adds to the 
robustness of the results.  
It is challenging to thoroughly assess safety and efficacy data in light of the very small population. The 
overall patient-years exposure to cPMP across the 15 treated patients, being 83.0 patient years is 
reasonable considering the rarity of the disease. Nevertheless, since this is a lifelong treatment, the 
long-term safety, especially in older children is considered as missing information. The proposed non-

interventional PASS is considered a meaningful instrument to collect as much safety and efficacy data 
as possible in the post-authorisation phase.   
No major safety issues have surfaced in the clinical studies. Most adverse events seen were device-
related events. Complications related to the central line may affect the quality of life for these children, 
but given the seriousness of the disease, the benefit of fosdenopterin treatment will normally outweigh 
the risks of the device. However, when the baseline condition of a patient is already unfavourable, the 
physician should take into account the burden of a central line in the decision to start treatment. 
Adverse events not related to the device were principally childhood diseases. There has been no clear 
indication of phototoxicity in the clinical studies. However, given the limited number of patients, 
phototoxicity cannot be completely ruled out. The warning in the SmPC relating to phototoxicity is 
therefore considered appropriate.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Fosdenopterin provides a survival benefit in treated patients with MoCD type A compared to the natural 
history controls. However, it should be acknowledged that an external, retrospectively collected natural 
history control inherently leads to a biased comparative estimate.  In a part of the patients, who 
entered the study without extensive brain damage, the survival benefit is accompanied by preservation 
of the ability to grow, feed orally and continued overall development, both in motor and cognitive 
functioning. The disease progression determines the extent of the benefit at treatment initiation.  
Fosdenopterin has a favourable safety profile. Most adverse effects that can be expected are 
associated with the central line needed for the daily intravenous administration of fosdenopterin. 
However, the number of patients is very limited and a robust conclusion on efficacy and safety cannot 
be drawn. 
The benefit/risk balance is considered positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The comprehensiveness of the data package 
In the D90 LoQ, the applicant was requested to discuss whether the data package can be seen as 
comprehensive, supporting a full MA, specifically with respect to the quality of evidence, precision of 
effect size, duration of effect, exposure and duration of follow-up. For the sake of completeness, the 
comprehensiveness will be discussed based on a total of 9 criteria.  
1.  Quality of evidence. The use of a single-arm open-label trial is considered sufficiently justified 
in this rare disease. However, using an external, retrospectively collected natural history 
control inherently leads to bias. Therefore, the quality of evidence is not considered to be 
sufficient to justify a full approval.  
2.  The precision of effect size. While a treatment effect has been demonstrated, based on the 
small sample size its precision is inevitably low’.  Although the applicant has provided multiple 
analyses supporting the positive effect on survival, using an external, retrospectively collected 
natural history control inherently leads to a biased estimate in this group. The data on 
biomarkers is considered robust. There are some remaining uncertainties around some of the 
other endpoints and the magnitude of clinical efficacy in late-onset patients. However, since 
there is consistency of effect across different domains, this is not of major concern.   
Assessment report  
EMA/677145/2022 
Page 112/116 
 
 
 
3.  The endpoints are considered to be clinically meaningful. Extension of survival is considered a 
benefit in this disease which is fatal in the first few years of life in a significant proportion of 
the patients. However, since the disease burden spans many domains, from motor 
development to cognition, from problems feeding to seizures, effects were to be shown across 
these different domains. The endpoints are considered adequate to capture these effects.  
4.  The maintenance of efficacy is considered reasonably demonstrated. Follow-up was provided 
until 13.4 years after treatment initiation. However, the number of patients is very limited, and 
it is not considered possible to draw indisputable conclusions.  
5.  Safety exposure. With a safety database of 15 treated MoCD type A patients, the number of 
patients is very limited. It is not considered possible to draw robust conclusions on safety 
based on such a limited patient population.  
6.  The safety follow-up duration is considered quite extensive. Across the 11 patients who 
received fosdenopterin, the total patient-years of exposure was 55.9 years. The median 
duration of treatment was 6.3 years, with a maximum exposure of 7.6 years as of the data 
cut-off. Nevertheless, safety in older children has not been shown. Given that this is a lifelong 
treatment, the totality of exposure is not considered sufficient for a full approval.  
7.  Target population versus the study population. The applicant aims to treat the complete MoCD 
type A patient population, while only patients with pre/neonatal onset of disease were included 
in the clinical studies. Although the applicant has sufficiently discussed that efficacy and safety 
could be extrapolated to later-onset patients based on the mechanism of action and this 
argumentation was supported with data from two treated late-onset MoCD type A patients, the 
available supporting data is considered to be limited. Therefore, this criterium is considered 
moderately fulfilled.  
8.  Being a substrate replacement therapy, the pharmacological rationale is strong. The 
mechanism of action is clear. This criterium is considered fulfilled.  
9.  The natural history of the disease has been well described. As external comparator, a natural 
history cohort study has been included with 37 MoCD type A patients. The use of a natural 
history cohort is considered justified, although using a natural history control leads to 
unavoidable bias. Therefore, this criterium is considered fulfilled.  
In conclusion, the CHMP does not agree with the applicant that the data can be considered 
comprehensive based on the insufficient quality of evidence, scarce data in late-onset patients and 
limited safety database. Therefore, the applicant was requested to apply for a marketing authorization 
under exceptional circumstances.    
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the applied for 
indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence. Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances is considered appropriate.

Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that fosdenopterin is to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0132/2022 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

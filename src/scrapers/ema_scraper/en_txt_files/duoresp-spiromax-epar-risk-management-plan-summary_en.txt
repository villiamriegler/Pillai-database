Summary of Risk Management Plan for DuoResp Spiromax 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for DuoResp Spiromax. The RMP details 
important risks of DuoResp Spiromax, how these risks can be minimised, and how more 
information will be obtained about risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
DuoResp Spiromax's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package  leaflet give
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how DuoResp Spiromax should 
be used.  
This summary of the RMP should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary as part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of DuoResp 
Spiromax RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It is used for 
DuoResp Spiromax is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma, where use of a combination
(inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist) is appropriate, as well as for 
the symptomatic treatment of patients with severe COPD and a history of repeated 
exacerbations, who have significant symptoms despite regular therapy with long-acting 
bronchodilators (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains fixed-dose combination of active 
substances budesonide and formoterol and it is given as inhalation powder.  
Further information about the evaluation of DuoResp Spiromax benefits can be found in EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/duoresp-spiromax. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further
Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of DuoResp Spiromax, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about DuoResp Spiromax risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of DuoResp Spiromax is not yet available, it 
is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of DuoResp Spiromax are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of DuoResp Spiromax. Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to 
be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Bimzelx 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Bimzelx. The RMP details important 
risks of Bimzelx, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Bimzelx's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Bimzelx's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Bimzelx should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Bimzelx should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Bimzelx's 
RMP.

THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Bimzelx is authorised for: 
Plaque psoriasis: Bimzelx is indicated for treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis (PSO) who are candidates for systemic therapy (see SmPC for the full indication).  
Psoriatic arthritis: Bimzelx, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the 
treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adults who have had an inadequate response or 
who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (see 
SmPC for the full indication).  
Axial spondyloarthritis:  
  Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA): Bimzelx is indicated for the treatment 
of adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of 
inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
  Ankylosing spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis): Bimzelx is indicated for 
the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have responded inadequately 
or are intolerant to conventional therapy (see SmPC for the full indication).  
It contains bimekizumab as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Bimzelx’s benefits can be found in Bimzelx’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/bimzelx.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS 
Important risks of Bimzelx, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Bimzelx's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report assessment so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Bimzelx is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
2.1 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Bimzelx are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Bimzelx. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Evidence for linking

medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Serious infections are considered as an important identified risk as a class 
effect for IL-17 inhibitors. 
PSO: Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, smoking, significant infection history, 
and PSO treatment were each associated with an increased risk (Kalb et al, 
2015). Treatment with biologics or small molecules may increase risk of 
serious infection in PSO patients, with variability in the mechanism of action 
(Siegel and Winthrop, 2019).  
PsA: Increasing age, prednisone use, PGA scores of 4 or 5 at the time closest 
to the reported event, history of infection, diabetes, chronic pulmonary 
comorbidity, and total duration of bDMARD use can potentially contribute to 
the risk of development of serious infections in PsA patients (Celkys et al, 
2020, Ritchlin et al, 2019). 
axSpA: Annual average number of csDMARD prescriptions and time to first 
biological drug prescription are significantly associated with increased risk of 
hospitalization for infections in patients with AS (Quartuccio et al, 2019). The 
use of biologics among patients with AS and nr-axSpA are not significantly 
associated with an increased risk of serious infection (Wang et al, 2018b).

Important identified risk: Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
This risk is based on safety evaluation performed including 
pharmacoepidemiological background incidence and prevalence rates of IBD, 
comparison of data from other IL-17 inhibitors, and review of bimekizumab 
clinical data. 
Table 2‒2:  Summary of important identified risks 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
PSO: Risk of IBD in PSO patients increases with severity of disease and 
systemic medication usage. Cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular disease may 
also be risk factors of IBD in PSO patients (Lee et al, 2019; Radtke et al, 
2017; Takeshita et al, 2017; Vlachos et al, 2016; Molodecky et al, 2012; 
Loftus Jr 2004). 
PsA: Risk of IBD in PsA increases with environmental risk factors such as 
smoking, infections, high doses of NSAIDs and genetic predisposition 
(Schreiber et al, 2019, Charlton et al, 2018). Previous failure of a TNF 
antagonist has also been associated with exacerbations and less disease control 
(Schreiber et al, 2019). 
axSpA: Risk of IBD in axSpA increases with environmental risk factors such 
as smoking, infections, genetic predisposition, previous failure of a TNF 
antagonist and high doses of NSAIDs (Schreiber et al, 2019; Fragoulis 2019). 
People in the older age group (≥65 years) and those with comorbidity of 
cancer also have a higher risk for IBD (Wang et al, 2020).

Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Data to evaluate safety concerns derive from clinical studies, comparison of 
data from other IL-17 inhibitors, and pharmacoepidemiological background 
incidence and prevalence rates. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
PSO: The increased cardiovascular risk in PSO patients is partly due to the 
association with factors that are known predictors of cardiovascular risk 
including hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. In addition, 
PSO patients have an increased risk of vascular inflammation and MACE 
(defined as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular related death) 
beyond that attributable to known cardiovascular risk factors (Egeberg et al, 
2017; Gelfand et al 2006). Observational studies have shown that if systemic 
inflammation is driving CVD risk then systemic treatment with methotrexate 
and biologic drugs may reduce elevated risk of MACE (Jindal and Jindal, 
2018). Some clinical trials of IL-12/23 inhibitors have reported elevated risk 
of MACE; however, a recent review across 38 RCTs found no statistically 
elevated risk (Rungapiromnan et al, 2017; Parisi et al, 2015). 
PsA: In PsA patients, the risk of developing CV events is driven by traditional 
CV risk factors; however, the level of disease activity and the extent of 
systemic inflammatory factors and chronic recurring inflammation are 
predictors of CV events (Zheng et al, 2022, Eder et al, 2016). Alongside 
traditional CV risk factors, such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking, 
markers of PsA disease activity, including polyarthritis, dactylitis, extensive 
skin PSO, and elevated inflammatory markers, have been associated with 
clinical CV events (Karmacharya et al, 2021c, Ogdie et al, 2015). 
axSpA: Inflammation, disease activity or its severity measurements are well-
recognized factors for accelerated atherosclerosis in axSpA, along with 
traditional CV risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, 
and dyslipidemia (Toussirot et al, 2021).

Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Data to evaluate safety concerns derive from clinical studies, comparison of 
data from other IL-17 inhibitors, and pharmacoepidemiological background 
incidence and prevalence rates. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
PSO: Several mechanisms may contribute to the increased risk of cancer 
among patients with PSO including chronic inflammation, impaired 
Table 2‒3:  Summary of important potential risks 
immunosurveillance associated with the disease itself. Other factors, such as 
treatment with certain pharmacologic agents or behavioral factors including 
smoking and alcohol consumption also may contribute to risk independently. 
A large meta-analysis showed that risk factors of cancer in PSO patients 
included alcohol and cigarette use, phototherapy, and disease severity 
(Pouplard et al, 2013). Two retrospective cohort studies examined severity of 
PSO disease and/or treatment in relation to cancer incidence (Kimball et al, 
2015; Lee et al, 2012). These studies found a trend in the incidence of all 
cancers, lymphoma, melanoma, and NMSC associated with increased PSO 
disease severity defined by treatment. 
PsA: The increased risk of cancers in PsA could be driven by the chronic 
inflammatory nature of the disease itself and the requirement for long-term 
therapy with immunosuppressive agents and/or phototherapy. An increased 
risk of cancer can also be attributed to more severe form of PsA which 
requires more long-term use and high-cumulative dose of 
immunosuppressants. Although data on the risk of cancer for the different 
therapeutic domains in PsA are variable, patients treated with conventional 
synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs are reported to present with 
increased cancer risk, but not those treated with biological therapies 
(Vaengebjerg et al, 2020; Woo et al, 2020; Fagerli et al, 2019; Luo et al 2019; 
Costa et al, 2016; Hagberg et al, 2016). 
axSpA: Chronic inflammatory activity in patients with AS can drive the risk 
of developing malignancies in axSpA. Evidence suggests that Asian 
populations, but not American or European populations, have a higher risk of 
malignancy (Deng et al, 2016). A meta-analysis has indicated no overall 
elevated risk of malignancy among SpA patients (including axSpA and 
peripheral SpA) treated with biologics (Kwan et al, 2020).

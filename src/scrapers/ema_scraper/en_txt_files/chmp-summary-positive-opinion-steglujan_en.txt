Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Steglujan 
ertugliflozin / sitagliptin 
On 25 January 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Steglujan, 
intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The applicant for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & 
Dohme Limited. 
Steglujan is a fixed dose combination of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin, two oral blood glucose lowering 
medicines (ATC code: A10BD24). It will be available as film-coated tablets (containing either 5 mg 
ertugliflozin and 100 mg sitagliptin, or 15 mg ertugliflozin and 100 mg sitagliptin). Ertugliflozin works by 
blocking a protein in the kidney called the human sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2). This reduces 
glucose re-absorption in the kidney leading to glucose excretion in the urine. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl 
peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibition reduces the cleavage and inactivation of the incretin 
hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), leading to an increase in incretin levels, which in turn 
stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibits the release of glucagon. 
The benefit with Steglujan is its ability to lower blood glucose. The most common side effects are 
vulvovaginal mycotic infection and other female genital mycotic infections. Serious diabetic ketoacidosis 
occurs rarely. 
The full indication is:  
“Steglujan is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to 
diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control: 
  when metformin and/or a sulphonylurea (SU) and one of the monocomponents of Steglujan do not 
provide adequate glycaemic control; 
 
in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin as separate 
tablets. 
(For study results with respect to combinations and effects on glycaemic control, see sections 4.4, 4.5, 
and 5.1.)”

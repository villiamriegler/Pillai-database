Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Victoza, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
An evaluation and cumulative review for overdose identified a total of 84 cases (92 events) associated with 
the use of liraglutide. The majority of overdose-related events were non-serious including severe nausea, 
vomiting and diarrhoea. None of the patients reported severe hypoglycaemia and all patients recovered 
without complications. Based on this data the PRAC concluded that section 4.9 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristic (SmPC) and the corresponding section in the Package Leaflet (PL) should be updated 
regarding the risk of overdose. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding liraglutide, the PRAC considered that changes to the product 
information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Victoza, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance LIRAGLUTIDE is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

Pomalidomide  (also  called  CC-4047)  is  an  analog  of  thalidomide with 
tumouricidal, 
immunomodulatory,  anti-angiogenic,  and  anti-inflammatory 
properties. The multiple pharmacological properties of pomalidomide suggested a 
potential therapeutic benefit in patients with MM.
The  activity  of  pomalidomide,  and  other  immunomodulatory  compounds,  is 
exerted through  binding to  cereblon,  a  component  of  an E3  ligase  complex  that 
includes DNA damage-binding protein 1, cullin 4, and Roc1. In the presence of 
pomalidomide  in  vitro,  substrate  proteins  Aiolos  and  Ikaros  are  targeted  for 
ubiquitination  and  subsequent  degradation  leading  to  direct  anti-myeloma 
cytotoxic  and  immunomodulatory  effects.  Pomalidomide  enhanced  T cell- and 
natural  killer  cell-mediated 
inhibited  production  of  pro-
immunity  and 
inflammatory  cytokines  (eg,  tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  and  interleukin 6)  by 
monocytes. Additionally, pomalidomide retained activity in lenalidomide-resistant 
MM  cell  lines,  despite  reduced  cereblon  expression.  In  vivo,  pomalidomide 
therapy  reduced  the  levels  of  Ikaros  in  patients  with  relapsed,  lenalidomide-
refractory MM.
Refer to proposed PI 
Current:
Pomalidomide in combination therapy with dexamethasone
Imnovid in combination with dexamethasone is indicated in the treatment of adult

Table 2.1-1:
Epidemiology of Patients with Multiple Myeloma
Multiple Myeloma
Incidence and 
Prevalence
Demographics of 
the population: 
age, gender, racial 
and/or ethnic 
origin
 MM accounts for about 10% to 18% of haematologic malignancies.1,2

The  HMRN  was  established  in  2004  to  provide  robust  generalisable  data  to  inform
clinical  practice  and  research.  The data  are  collected  in  the  UK  but  estimates  are
extrapolated to Europe. Based on the most recent estimates (2014), the annual incidence
of MM is 6.5 per 100,000 persons. The 3-year, 5-year and 10-year prevalence estimates
were: 16.4 per 100,000 persons, 22.6 per 100,000 persons and 29.9 per 100,000 persons
respectively.3
 Crude and ASR of MM in the population of the EU – 28 states are 6.6 and 3.0 per 100,000,
respectively, based upon estimates obtained from GLOBOCAN 2012.4

The  1-year,  3-year,  and  5-year  number  of  persons  with  MM  and  prevalence
proportions of MM (ages 15 years and older) in the EU-28 countries were 5.8 per 
100,000  persons,  13.4 per  100,000  persons  and  18.0  per  100,000  persons, 
respectively.4
 Gains in survivorship associated with new therapies will increase the prevalence of MM.
 MM  incidence  rates  among  males  and  females  in  Europe  rise  with  increasing  age

and older).4
The ASR incidence of MM in men in the EU-28 countries is 3.7, based upon the diagnosis
of MM in 18,043 men. MM accounted for 1.3% of all malignancies in men.4
The  ASR  incidence  of  MM  in  women  in  the  EU-28  countries  is  2.5,  based  upon  the
diagnosis  of  MM  in  15,599  women.  MM  accounts  for  1.4%  of  all  malignancies  in
women.4

 Analysing  18,824  MM  registrations  with  ethnicity  obtained  by  linkage  to  the  English
Hospital Episodes Statistics Database, Shirley5 reported markedly higher incidence rates
of  MM  in  Black  African  men  (ASR 8.6 per 100,000)  and  Black  Caribbean  men  (8.3)
relative to  White men (3.7).  Similar results  were  obtained with  MM  incidence rates  in
Black African women (5.8) and Black Caribbean women (5.7) were compared to White
women  (2.4).  This  pattern  is  similar to  that reported  in  the  United  States  (US),  where
incidence  rates  of  MM  are  markedly  higher  in  Black  men  compared  to  White  men
(15.9 versus  7.8  per  100,000)  and  in  Black  women  compared  to  White  women  (11.4
versus 4.6 per 100,000, respectively).6 Racial differences in rates were also observed in
the US population.7
 According to the HMRN, the incidence of MM increases with age from a low of 0.09 per
100,000  (30  to 34  years  old) to  36.24  per  100,000  (≥80  years  old).  Among  males,  the
annual ASR incidence was 9.7 per 100,000 while for females, it was 5.8 per 100,000.3

 Age  is  the  most  important  risk  factor  for  MM,  although  race  and  gender  are  also
important.  While  strong  familial  clustering  of  MM  suggests  that  underlying  genetic
factors  are  important,  findings  from  studies  of  lifestyle,  dietary,  occupational  and

 Crude and age-standardised mortality rates of MM in the EU-28 population are 4.0 and
1.6 per 100,000, respectively, based upon estimates obtained from GLOBOCAN 2012.
Within  the  EU-28  population,  20,462 men  and  women  died  with  MM  in  2012.  The
cumulative mortality risk of MM (ages 0 to 74 years) is 0.17%.4
 According to GLOBOCAN 2012, MM accounts for 1.2% of all deaths among persons
with invasive malignancy in the European population.4
 Between  1989 and  2009,  1206  patients  with  MM  were identified  through  the  Modena
Cancer Registry,9 corresponding to periods of conventional therapy (1988 to 1996), high
dose  melphalan  and  ASCT  (1997  to  2005)  and  novel  agents  (2006  to  2009).  Relative
survival  and  OS  improved  over  the  years,  with  little  change  noted  for  patients  aged
≥ 75 years. The survival of MM patients aged < 65 years and, in particular, 65 to 74 years
improved over time, especially after 2006.


The most recent data from the European Society for Bone and Marrow Transplantation
registry (2006 to 2010) reported 5 year OS in MM transplant recipients as follows: 61.5%
(< 40  years  of  age),  62.8%  (40  to  49 years).  59.9%  (50  to  59 years),  58.8%  (60  to

Toxicity Studies:

Single and Repeat-dose Toxicity
Single-dose  oral  and  IV  studies  in  mice  and  rats  indicated  that 
pomalidomide is well tolerated and acute oral minimum lethal dose 
was  > 2000 mg/kg,  and  acute  IV  minimum  lethal  dose  was 
> 80 mg/kg for mice, and > 50 mg/kg for rats.
Pomalidomide  was  well-tolerated  by  rats  up  to  the highest dosage 
tested in repeat-dose studies of durations from 7 days to 6 months. 
No adverse effects were observed up to 5000 mg/kg/day in the 7-day 
study, 2000 mg/kg/day in the 28-day study, 1500 mg/kg/day in the 
90-day  study  and  1000 mg/kg/day  in  the  6-month  study.  In  the 
6-month  study,  the  dosage  of  1000  mg/kg/day  resulted  in  a  mean 
AUC24h  of  70270 g•h/mL  on  Day  180  (175-fold  higher  exposure 
relative to a 4 mg clinical dose).
In  monkeys,  pomalidomide  was  evaluated  in  repeat-dose  studies 
with  durations  of  14 days  at  doses  from  50  to  1200  mg/kg/day, 
28 days  at  doses  from  30  to  300 mg/kg/day  and  from  0.2  and  2 
mg/kg/day,  90 days  at  doses  from  0.05  to  10 mg/kg/day,  and 
9 months  at  doses  from  0.05  to  1 mg/kg/day.  In  these  studies,  the 
monkey  exhibited  greater  sensitivity  to  pomalidomide  effects 
compared  to  the  rat,  and  morbidity  and  mortality  were  associated 
with  doses  at  1 and  10 mg/kg/day  in  the  9-month  and  3-month 
studies,  respectively.  The  primary  toxicities  observed  in  monkeys 
were  associated  with  the  haematopoietic/lymphoreticular  systems. 
The  major  findings  were  decreased  RBC  parameters  (RBC  count, 
haemoglobin, and haematocrit), decreased WBC counts (neutrophils, 
lymphocytes,  and  monocytes),  and  histologic  lymphoid  depletion 
(lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue). 
In addition, increased incidences of loose and watery stool leading to 
weight  loss  were  often  observed  and  contributed  to  poor  clinical 
conditions.

euthanised on Day 253 and exhibited changes consistent with AML 
(extreme leukocytosis, multiple organ infiltrates, and bone marrow 
blast infiltration). Based upon the known association in humans of

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies)
considered  treatment-related.  The  1 mg/kg/day  dose  resulted  in  a 
mean  AUC24h  of  6540  ng•h/mL  in  female  monkeys  on  Day 272 
(16-fold higher exposure relative to a 4 mg clinical dose). NOAEL 
in  this  study  was  0.1 mg/kg/day,  corresponding  to  Day  272  mean 
pomalidomide  AUC24h  of  219 ng•h/mL  (0.5-fold  exposure  ratio 
relative to a 4 mg clinical dose).
In the surviving animals, there were no treatment-related changes in 
body  weight,  electrocardiography,  blood  pressure  measurements, 
ophthalmology, and urinalysis. Other minor changes present at the 
scheduled  sacrifice  included  villous  atrophy  of  the  small  intestine 
and minimal or mild bile duct proliferation. Evaluation of recovery 
animals indicated that all treatment-related findings were reversible 
after  8  weeks  of  dosing  cessation,  except  for  proliferation  of 
intrahepatic  bile  ducts  observed  in  1 animal  in  the  1 mg/kg/day 
group.
Pomalidomide  was  also  assessed  for  immunotoxicity  in  monkeys 
after  treatment  at  2  mg/kg/day  for  28  days.  Immunotoxicologic 
effects related to pomalidomide treatment included increased large 
unstained  cells,  decreases  in  peripheral  lymphocytes  populations 
(correlating  to  bone  marrow  hypocellularity),  alterations  to  the 
primary  and  secondary  humoral  immune  system,  thymic  organ 
weight  decreases  (macroscopic  finding  of  small  thymus),  and 
histological findings consistent with general lymphoid depletion in 
the thymus, spleen, and the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes. 
There were no effects on granulocyte, monocyte, or natural killer cell 
function.  All  findings  at  2 mg/kg/day  demonstrated  full  recovery 
after a 30-day drug-free period, with the exception of the decreased 
CD20+  B  lymphocytes  (partial  recovery  observed)  and  reduced 
thymus  weights;  minimal/mild  histological  changes  in  the  lymph 
nodes  also  indicated  that  there  were  partial  recoveries  of  these 
effects.
 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity
In  a  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  study  in  rats, 
pomalidomide was administered to males and females at dosages of 
25,  250,  and  1000 mg/kg/day.  Male  rats  were  dosed  beginning  28 
days  before  cohabitation  and  continuing  through  the  day  before 
necropsy;  female  rats  were  dosed  beginning  14 days  before 
cohabitation,  during  the  mating  period,  and  until  Gestation  Day 7. 
Uterine examination on Gestation Day 13 showed a decrease in mean 
number of viable embryos and an increase in post-implantation loss 
at all dosage levels. Therefore, the NOAEL for these observed effects 
was  < 25  mg/kg/day  (AUC24h  was  39960  ng•h/mL  at  this  lowest 
dose  tested,  and  the  exposure  ratio  was  99-fold  relative  to  a  4 mg 
clinical  dose).  When  treated  males  on  this  study  were  mated  with 
untreated  females,  all  uterine  parameters  were  comparable  to  the 
controls. Based on these results, the observed effects were attributed 
to the treatment of females.
Pomalidomide was found to be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits 
when administered during the period of major organogenesis. In the 
Relevance to human usage
Pomalidomide  must  not  be  taken  during 
pregnancy,  since  a  teratogenic  effect  is 
expected.  Pomalidomide 
is  structurally 
related  to  thalidomide,  a  known  human 
teratogen that causes severe life-threatening 
birth defects (SmPC, Section 4.4).
The conditions of the PPP must be fulfilled 
for all patients.

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies)
rat  embryofoetal  developmental  toxicity  study,  malformations  of 
absence of urinary bladder, absence of thyroid gland, and fusion and 
misalignment  of  lumbar  and  thoracic  vertebral  elements  (central 
and/or neural arches) were observed at all dosage levels (25, 250, and 
1000 mg/kg/day).  There  was  no  maternal  toxicity  observed in  this 
study. Therefore, the maternal NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day, and the 
NOAEL  for  developmental  toxicity  was  < 25 mg/kg/day  (AUC24h
was 34340 ng•h/mL on Gestation Day 17 at this lowest dose tested, 
and the exposure ratio was 85-fold relative to a 4 mg clinical dose). 
In rabbits, pomalidomide at dosages ranging from 10 to 250 mg/kg 
produced  embryo  foetal  developmental  malformations.  Increased 
cardiac anomalies were seen at all doses with significant increases at 
250 mg/kg/day.  At  100  and  250 mg/kg/day,  there  were  slight 
increases  in  post-implantation  loss  and  slight  decreases  in  foetal 
body  weights.  At  250 mg/kg/day,  foetal  malformations  included 
limb  anomalies  (flexed  and/or  rotated  fore- and/or  hind-limbs, 
unattached  or  absent  digit)  and  associated  skeletal  malformations 
(not  ossified  etacarpal,  misaligned  phalanx and metacarpal,  absent 
digit,  not  ossified  phalanx,  and  short  not  ossified  or  bent  tibia); 
moderate  dilation  of  the  lateral  ventricle  in  the  brain;  abnormal 
placement of the right subclavian artery; absent intermediate lobe in 
the lungs; low-set kidney; altered liver morphology; incompletely or 
not ossified pelvis; an increased average for supernumerary thoracic 
ribs  and  a  reduced  average  for  ossified  tarsals.  Slight  reduction  in 
maternal body weight gain, significant reduction in triglycerides, and 
significant  decrease  in  absolute  and  relative  spleen  weights  were 
observed at 100 and 250 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOAEL was 10 
mg/kg/day,  and  the  developmental  NOAEL  was  < 10  mg/kg/day 
(AUC24h was 418 ng•h/mL on Gestation Day 19 at this lowest dose 
tested, which was similar to that obtained from a 4 mg clinical dose).

 Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity
Pomalidomide  was  not  mutagenic  in  bacterial  and  mammalian 
mutation  assays,  and  did  not  induce  chromosomal  aberrations  in 
human  peripheral  blood  lymphocytes  or  micronuclei  formation  in 
polychromatic  erythrocytes  in  bone  marrow  of  rats  administered 
doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day.
General Safety Pharmacology
Pomalidomide had no effects on CNS and respiratory function in rats 
at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg. Pomalidomide up to 87.5 μM did not 
produce  any  statistically  significant  hERG  current  blockade  in 
HEK293 cells expressing hERG channels, indicating a low potential 
to  block  cardiac  IKr  (rapidly  activating  component  of  cardiac 
delayed  rectifier  K+  current)  in  vitro.  In  anesthetised  dogs, 
pomalidomide had no effects on QTc following IV administration at 
dose levels of up to 25 mg/kg. However, the NOAEL in this study is 
considered to be 10 mg/kg based on the changes in respiratory rate 
and blood pressure observed in 1 of 4 dogs in the 25 mg/kg group. 
No significant differences from vehicle controls were observed in the 
remaining  3  dogs.  In  a  conscious,  telemetry-instrumented  male 
monkey  study,  pomalidomide  at  oral  doses  ranging  from  0.2  to 
10 mg/kg  had  no 
effects  on 
cardiovascular  function,  electrocardiographic  and  haemodynamic 
parameters, or respiration.
adverse  pharmacodynamic 
Cardiovascular assessment (vital signs, ECG, respiration, and heart 
rate) conducted in the 1-, 3- and 9-month monkey studies indicated 
no  pomalidomide-related  cardiovascular  changes  at  doses  up  to 
2 mg/kg/day  for  up  to  3 months,  and  up  to  1  mg/kg/day  after  9 
months  (Cmax =  1249 and  653 ng/mL;  both  sexes  combined,  at  2 
and 1 mg/kg/day respectively).
Mechanisms for Drug Interactions
In the human AME study, CYP dependent metabolites accounted for 
approximately  43%  of  the  excreted  radioactivity,  while  non-CYP 
dependent hydrolytic metabolites accounted for 25%, and excretion 
of  unchanged  pomalidomide  accounted 
for  10%.  Since 
pomalidomide was eliminated in humans via multiple pathways and 
several CYP enzymes were capable of metabolising pomalidomide, 
namely  CYP1A2,  CYP3A4,  and  to  a  minor  extent  CYP2C19  and 
CYP2D6, it is not anticipated that inhibitors of these CYPs will have 
a  significant  impact  on  pomalidomide  pharmacokinetics.  No 
pharmacokinetic  interaction  was  observed  between  pomalidomide 
(4 mg)  and  dexamethasone  (20 to  40 mg),  a  weak  to  moderate 
inducer  of  CYP3A  in  MM  subjects  (see  Section 11.6  of  the 
CC-4047-MM-002 CSR43; SmPC, Section 4.5).
Pomalidomide  (up  to  30  μM)  produced  no  direct  inhibition  of

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies)
CYP2D6,  CYP2E1,  and  CYP3A4/5  in  human  liver  microsomes. 
Furthermore,  little  to  no  time-dependent  inhibition  of  CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6  or  CYP3A4/5  was  observed  with 
pomalidomide at concentrations up to 30 μM. 
In human hepatocyte cultures, pomalidomide (0.3 to 3 μM, three day 
treatment)  did  not  induce  the  catalytic  activities  of  CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19  and  CYP3A4/5  to a notable  extent. 
Since the mean Cmax value following multiple daily doses of 5 mg to 
subjects  with  MM  was  approximately  50  ng/mL  (0.2 μM), 
pomalidomide  is  unlikely  to  cause  inhibition  or  induction  of  CYP 
enzyme activities at clinically relevant concentrations.
Pomalidomide  (up  to  10  μM) is not an  inhibitor  of  P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp)  and  is  not  anticipated  to  cause  drug-drug  interactions  at 
therapeutic  doses  when  administered  with  substrates  of  P-gp.

did not appear to be limited by this. In the human AME study, at least 
70% of the dose was absorbed, indicating good oral absorption. The 
potential  for  clinically  relevant  drug-drug  interactions  when
pomalidomide is coadministered, with inhibitors of P-gp is low, but 
has not been evaluated clinically.
Pomalidomide (at 2 and 20 μM) did not inhibit BCRP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3 and OCT2 transporter mediated activities. Pomalidomide 
weakly  (approximately  26%  to 30%)  inhibited  OAT1  and  OAT3 
activities at the 20 μM concentration, with no inhibition observed at 
2 μM.
Pomalidomide  is not anticipated  to  cause  drug-drug  interactions at 
therapeutic  doses  when  administered  with  substrates  of  BCRP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, OAT1 and OAT3.
Other Toxicity-related Information or Data

Preclinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
Pomalidomide is a chiral molecule that contains an equal mixture of the 
S-enantiomer and the R-enantiomer. Interconversion of the enantiomers 
(non-enzymatic 
occurred  gradually 
interconversion),  more  rapidly  in  vitro  in  plasma  (presumably  due  to 
enzymatic interconversion), and in vivo in monkeys following IV or oral 
administration of the individual enantiomers.
in  buffer  at  neutral  pH 
Following IV administration of pomalidomide to rats and monkeys, the 
systemic clearance was low (< 1/6th liver blood flow) and the volume 
of  distribution  was  moderate  (2- to  4-fold  body  water  volume).  The 
terminal half-life of pomalidomide was approximately 6 h in rats and 4 
to 7 h in monkeys.
Following  oral  dosing  to  animals,  pomalidomide  (racemate)  was 
absorbed  at a  moderate rate,  with  median  time  of  maximum  observed 
plasma  concentration  values  of  2  to  4  h. The  oral  bioavailability  of  a 
2 mg/kg dose of pomalidomide in monkeys  was approximately 100%. 
However, at a higher dose of 100 mg/kg in both rats and monkeys, the 
Metabolites  observed  in  humans  are 
similar to those observed in animals and 
have thus been adequately characterised 
with regard to their potential toxicity.
As pomalidomide has been observed in 
milk  from  lactating  rats  and  can  cross 
the placenta, it must not be administered 
to pregnant or lactating females.

oral bioavailability of pomalidomide was low (< 20%), suggesting oral 
bioavailability may be solubility limited.
Relevance to human usage
Pomalidomide plasma protein binding was low to moderate in animals 
and humans, ranging from approximately 12% to 59% at concentrations 
between 30 and 1000 ng/mL.
Following  a  single  oral  administration  of  [14C]pomalidomide 
(100 mg/kg)  to  pigmented  male  Long-Evans  rats,  compound-derived 
radioactivity  was  widely  distributed  into  tissues,  with  most  tissue 
concentrations peaking at 3 hours and decreasing to below quantifiable 
levels (< 0.418 μg equiv/g) by 12 hours postdose. The highest measured 
tissue  concentrations  occurred  in  the  kidney  and  in  gastrointestinal 
organs.  Radioactivity  was  present  in  the  bile  and  the  urinary  bladder 
indicating liver and kidney are involved in excretion. Most tissues had 
moderate  levels  of  radioactivity,  including  liver,  endocrine  glands, 
secretory  glands,  and  pigmented 
skin.  Pomalidomide-derived 
radioactivity was  observed in the spinal cord and brain, with tissue to 
blood  ratios  between  0.27  and  0.43  at  3  hours  postdose.  These  data 
indicate  good  distribution  of  pomalidomide-related  material  into  most 
tissues.  Additional  studies 
the  penetration  of 
pomalidomide into the CNS were performed in rats and mice. Brain to 
plasma/blood ratios ranged from 0.39 to 0.49 in these studies, indicating 
moderate distribution into the brain.

dose-range 
foetal  plasma 
pomalidomide concentrations were approximately 50% of the maternal 
Cmax at all dosages (5 to 250 mg/kg/day), indicating that pomalidomide 
crossed  the  placenta.  Following  a  single  oral  administration  of 
pomalidomide  to  lactating  rats  approximately  14 days  postpartum, 
pomalidomide was transferred into milk, with milk to plasma ratios of 
0.63 to 1.46.
rabbits, 
During in vitro incubation of [14C]pomalidomide in cell-free medium, 
multiple  degradation  products  were  formed  due  to  non-enzymatic 
hydrolysis of the glutarimide and phthalidmide rings of pomalidomide. 
The levels of some hydrolysis products were increased in the presence 
of hepatocytes, indicating they may be formed enzymatically as well as 
non-enzymatically. The extent of pomalidomide metabolism was low in 
human hepatocytes,  with metabolites  formed  via hydroxylation  of  the 
phthalimide ring and glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites.
Following  oral  administration  of  [14C]pomalidomide  to  rats  or 
monkeys,  > 80%  of  the  circulating  radioactivity  was  characterised  as 
unchanged  pomalidomide.  With  the  exception  of  a  hydroxylated 
metabolite in male rats, all plasma metabolites were present at < 10% 
relative  to  parent  compound.  In  rats,  [14C]pomalidomide  was  poorly 
absorbed following an oral dose (100 mg/kg), with faecal radioactivity 
containing primarily unchanged, and likely unabsorbed pomalidomide, 
while in monkeys, unchanged pomalidomide in faeces represented < 5% 
of  the  dose.  In  both  species,  urinary  radioactivity  contained  primarily 
metabolites  and  urinary  excretion  of  parent  compound  was  a  minor

elimination  pathway.  In  rats  and  monkeys,  the  primary  pathways  for 
metabolism  of  [14C]pomalidomide  included  hydroxylation  of  the 
phthalimide  ring,  glucuronidation  of  the  hydroxylated  metabolites, 
hydrolysis  of  the  glutarimide  ring,  and  hydrolysis  of  the  phthalimide 
ring. Following administration of a single oral 2 mg [14C]pomalidomide 
dose  to  healthy  male  subjects,  pomalidomide  was  the  predominant 
circulating radioactive  component,  accounting  for  approximately  70% 
of the circulating radioactivity. 
The metabolic pathways observed were the same as those observed in 
rats and monkeys and no circulating human metabolites were present at 
> 10% relative to parent or relative to total radioactivity. Based on the 
in vivo rat, monkey and human metabolism data, there were no unique 
or disproportionate metabolites observed in humans.
Following  oral  (10  mg/kg)  or  IV  (1  mg/kg)  administration  of 
[14C]pomalidomide to rats or monkeys, excretion of radioactivity was 
rapid  and  nearly  complete  (>  90%).  In  rats,  the  predominant  route  of 
elimination was in the faeces following oral administration and in urine 
following  IV  administration.  Based  on  excretion  data  from  bile  duct 
cannulated  male  and  female  rats,  approximately  28%  of  orally 
administered  [14C]pomalidomide  was  absorbed.  In  monkeys,  the 
primary  route  of  elimination  was  via  the  urine,  which  contained 
approximately 72% of the radioactive dose following either oral or IV 
administration, demonstrating that at least 72% of the drug was absorbed 
following  oral administration.  These  data  indicate  that  urine  is  the 
primary  route  of  elimination  for  circulating  pomalidomide  related 
material in both species, with the urinary radioactivity consisting mainly 
of metabolites rather than parent compound. Following administration 
of a single oral [14C]pomalidomide dose to healthy male subjects, the 
excretion profile was similar to monkeys, with 73% of the radioactive 
dose eliminated in urine, but urinary excretion of unchanged drug was 
< 3%.

2.4.2
Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes 
The  clinical  development  programme  is  unlikely  to  detect  rare  adverse  reactions.  Patients  with 
RRMM have a limited survival time meaning that the trial programme may be limited in its ability 
to assess cumulative effects, effects due to prolonged exposure, and effects with a long latency. 
Furthermore, these are, to a great extent, elderly patients with a limited natural life expectancy.
2.4.3
Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-represented in 
Clinical Trial Development Programmes
Specific populations of patients were excluded from the clinical studies, thus experience in these 
populations is limited. Exposure of special populations is presented in Table 2.4.3-1.

Patients with relevant comorbidities:
Patients with renal impairment
In Study MM-007, 28.5% (80/281) versus 23.7% (66/278) of patients had 
moderate  renal  insufficiency  (CrCl  ≥ 30  and  < 60 mL/min),  and  3.9% 
(11/281) versus 3.6% (10/278) of patients had severe renal insufficiency 
(CrCl < 30 mL/min) in the pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib 
and  dexamethasone  and  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  arms, 
respectively.  Patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (CrCl < 30 mL/min) 
were eligible for the study as long as they were not requiring dialysis.
Clinical  studies  in  MM  subjects  with  moderate  and  severe  renal 
impairment are  ongoing  (CC-4047-MM-008 and  CC-4047-MM-013). A 
meta-analysis combining pharmacokinetics data from both of these studies 
is  complete  (CC-4047-MPK-002).  In  CC-4047-MPK-002,  in  total 
63 subjects have been exposed with the following renal functions (creatine 
clearance [CLcr] or estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]): normal 
renal  function  (> 60 mL/min,  n=8);  moderate  renal  impairment  (30  to 
60 mL/min,  n=15);  severe  renal  impairment  without  dialysis  (15  to 
30 mL/min, n=30); severe renal impairment with dialysis (0 to 15 mL/min; 
n=10).
Patients with hepatic impairment A  clinical  study  in  healthy  subjects  with  varying  degrees  of  hepatic 
impairment (CC-4047-CP-009) is complete with a final CSR (the synopsis 
for Study-CC-4047-CP-009 is included in Annex 9 of RMP Version 9.0). 
In total, 32 male subjects were included in this study.
Patients with cardiovascular 
impairment
Pomalidomide has been evaluated in a randomised, double-blind crossover 
study with four treatments, four periods and four sequences to investigate 
the effects of orally administered single doses of pomalidomide on the QT 
interval  in  healthy  male  subjects  (CC-4047-CP-010).  The  study  was 
designed  according  to  International  Conference  on  Harmonisation 
Guideline E14. It was shown that pomalidomide, when given as a single 
oral dose of up to 20 mg, is not associated with QT prolongation in healthy 
male subjects, and that this is a negative, thorough QT/QTc study. A single 
dose of 4 mg and 20 mg pomalidomide was safe and well tolerated by the 
healthy male subjects in this study.
Immunocompromised patients
The target population used in the clinical trial development programme 
were immunocompromised patients.

The information received has not provided new safety findings with regard 
to the use of pomalidomide in patients of different racial origins. Based on 
the current information, no updates to risk minimisation are needed at this

Other 
Paediatric Population:
Pomalidomide  is  not  authorised  for  use  in  children  in  the  EU/EEA  or 
elsewhere in the world. A class waiver for MM in paediatrics was granted 
by the PDCO at the EMA on 03 Dec 2007 due to the rareness of MM in 
the  paediatric  population  (EMA/PDCO/920049/2011).50 Children  were 
not included in the clinical studies.
Elderly Population:
MM  is  a  disease  of  the  elderly.  Of  the  278  subjects  exposed  to 
pomalidomide  in  combination  with  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  in 
Study MM-007, 158 (56.8%) were aged > 65 years, with 46 (16.5%) aged 
> 75 years. Of the 686 subjects exposed to pomalidomide in combination 
with  dexamethasone  in  Studies MM-001,  MM-002,  MM-003  and 
IFM-2009-02,  217  (31.6%)  were  aged  > 65  to  75 years,  and  65 (9.5%) 
were aged > 75 years.
A clinical pharmacology study in healthy elderly subjects, aged 61 to 85 
(CC-4047-CP-011)  is  complete  with  a  final  CSR. 51 The  mean  drug 
exposures were generally similar to younger subjects. No dose adjustment 
is required for pomalidomide.
Pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone 
For patients aged > 75 years, the starting dose of dexamethasone is 20 mg 
QD  on  Days 1,  8,  15  and  22  of  each  28-day  treatment  cycle  (SmPC,

Method Used to Calculate Exposure
The cumulative value for exposure represents the estimated number of unique patients exposed to 
the product from 08-Feb-2013 through 07-Feb-2022. 
The methodology for estimating commercial patient exposure utilizes up to 3 data sources:
1) BMS’s  Sales/Shipment  Data  – this data  consist  of  all  shipments  of  BMS product  to  all 
applicable countries and includes commercial and free-of-charge units for both branded and 
generic product (as applicable). The data are used to determine the units (eg, milligrams) of a 
product that was sold to a geography to estimate the number of patients who would have been 
exposed to that product, based on expected dosing in the geography. Shipment data are used 
to estimate the active patients for a period of time by dividing the total units sold by the average 
units per patient (note that average units per patient is derived from epidemiologic or market 
research).

was found to be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered 
during the period of major organogenesis (SmPC, Sections 4.4, 4.8 and 
5.3). If pomalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of 
pomalidomide in humans is expected (SmPC, Sections 4.4, 4.6 and 4.8).

Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and 
Missing Information
The  important  identified  and  potential  safety  risks  of  pomalidomide  are  summarised  in  the 
following  tables,  based  on  data  from  Study  MM-007  and  pooled  data  from  Studies  MM-002, 
MM-003, and IFM-2009-02. These are established as identified or potential safety risks based on 
the nonclinical and clinical development programme of the drug. Calculation of relative and excess 
risks  is  not  applicable  for  these  studies  as  the  majority  of  subjects  in  Studies  MM-002  and 
IFM-2009-02 received pomalidomide with low-dose dexamethasone. In Study MM-007, subjects 
received either pomalidomide in combination with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone, or 
bortezomib with low-dose dexamethasone. Of note, Study MM-002 had a pomalidomide only arm, 
which included 107 subjects. Of these subjects, 46 received pomalidomide only and did not have 
low-dose  dexamethasone  subsequently  added  to  their  regimen.  In  Study  MM-003,  subjects 
received  either  pomalidomide  in  combination  with  low-dose  dexamethasone,  or  high-dose 
dexamethasone  alone.  For  the  following  important  identified  and  potential  risks,  data  from  the 
pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone arm are pooled for Studies MM-002, IFM-2009-02 
and MM-003. In addition, as Study MM-003 included a comparator arm, data for this study are 
presented for the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone versus high-dose dexamethasone 
arms. Data from Study MM-007 are presented by treatment arm.
Pooled data for frequency with 95% CIs only also included data from Study MM-001. Data from 
Study MM-007 were not pooled with the other studies in the RMP because the study regimen was 
a  triplet  regimen,  which  included  bortezomib,  meaning  the  results  were  not  comparable.  In
addition, the study population and treatment duration in Study MM-007 were not comparable to 
that of the pooled Studies MM-002, MM-003, and IFM-2009-02 (Part II SVIII).
The RMP search criteria have been defined for each study based on the MedDRA version as noted 
in Table 2.7.3-1. Due to the different MedDRA versions used for each clinical study's database, 
the terms were used based on the MedDRA version used to code AEs in the clinical database.

Characterization of risk 
No mechanism by which pomalidomide may cause teratogenicity has been 
fully established.
Pomalidomide  is  structurally  related  to  thalidomide,  a  known  human 
teratogen that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide was 
found to be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the 
period of major organogenesis. If pomalidomide is taken during pregnancy, 
a teratogenic effect of pomalidomide in humans is expected.
Although  women  of  childbearing  potential  taking  pomalidomide  are 
particularly at risk, female partners of male patients taking pomalidomide are 
also at risk as pomalidomide may be present in semen.
There are no cases of pregnancy reported in female subjects on 
pomalidomide or female partners of male subjects on pomalidomide in 
studies MM-007, MM-001, MM-002, MM-003 and IFM-2009-02.
A multiple ascending dose study that evaluated the transfer of 
pomalidomide (CC-4047-CP-00652) in semen in healthy volunteers after 
4 doses of pomalidomide (4 mg QD) was completed in Quarter 4 (Q4) 
2011.
Risk factors and risk groups 
The ‘at risk’ group comprises female patients of childbearing potential or 
female partners of male patients treated with pomalidomide.

Impact on the risk-benefit balance 
of the product
Pomalidomide  is  contraindicated  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of 
childbearing potential, unless all the conditions of the PPP are met (SmPC, 
Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6). Prescriptions for women of childbearing potential 
can be for a maximum duration of 4 weeks whereas prescriptions for all other 
patients can be for a maximum duration of 12 weeks (SmPC, Section 4.4).
The  teratogenic  effect  of  pomalidomide  in  humans  cannot  be  ruled  out. 
Therefore, a PPP is in place, with details provided in the SmPC (Section 4.4). 
This includes  the requirement  for  females  of  childbearing potential to  use 
effective means of contraception for at least 4 weeks before therapy, during 
pomalidomide  therapy  and  dose  interruptions,  and  for  4  weeks  following 
discontinuation  of  pomalidomide  therapy,  or  continually  abstain  from 
reproductive  heterosexual  sexual  intercourse.  Females  of  childbearing 
potential  must  undergo  regular  pregnancy  testing  during  treatment  with 
pomalidomide  and  immediately  discontinue  pomalidomide  therapy  if 
pregnancy occurs. Furthermore, it is mandatory that women of childbearing 
potential receive counselling to be made aware of the risks of pomalidomide. 
A multiple ascending dose study that evaluated the transfer of pomalidomide 
(CC-4047-CP-00652)  in  semen  in  healthy  volunteers  after  4  doses  of 
pomalidomide  (4  mg  QD)  was  completed  in  Q4  2011.  The  amount  of 
pomalidomide recovered in semen at 4 hours post dose (on Day 4) ranged 
from 10.5 to 113 ng with a mean concentration of 16.4 ng/mL, which was 
approximately 67% of the pomalidomide plasma concentration observed at 
the  same  time  point  on  Day  5  (ie,  24.5  ng/mL).  Male  patients  taking 
pomalidomide  must  use  effective  contraception  during  therapy  and  for 
7 days following discontinuation of pomalidomide therapy if their partner is 
of  childbearing  potential  and  not  using  effective  contraception.  As 
pomalidomide  is  distributed  in  semen,  male  patients  taking  pomalidomide 
must  not  donate  sperm.  Vasectomised  males  should  wear  a  condom  if 
engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman as seminal fluid may still 
contain pomalidomide in the absence of spermatozoa.
All patients (males and females with or without childbearing potential) must 
agree  to  abstain  from  donating  blood,  semen  and  sperm  while  taking 
pomalidomide and for 7 days after the last dose.
It  is  unknown  whether  pomalidomide  is  excreted  in  human  milk. 
Pomalidomide was detected in milk of lactating rats following administration 
to  the  mother.  Because  of  the  potential  for  adverse  reactions  in  breastfed 
infants from pomalidomide, a decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breastfeeding  or to  discontinue  the medicinal  product,  taking  into  account 
the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of the therapy for 
the woman (SmPC, Section 4.6).
Further details of the risk minimisation measures for the risk of teratogenicity 
are outlined in Part V.
Pomalidomide  is  structurally  related  to  thalidomide,  a  known  human 
teratogen,  inducing  a  high  frequency  (about  30%)  of  severe  and

Important Identified Risk: Severe Infection due to Neutropenia and Pancytopenia
Information  concerning  the  risk  of  severe  infection  due  to  neutropenia  and  pancytopenia  is 
summarised in Table 2.7.3.1-2.
Table 2.7.3.1-2:
Important Identified Risk: Severe Infection due to Neutropenia and 
Pancytopenia
Severe Infection due to Neutropenia and Pancytopenia
Potential mechanisms
No  mechanism  by  which  pomalidomide  may  directly  cause  infection  has 
been established. Infection may be secondary to underlying disease and/or in 
some  cases  neutropenia.  The  pathogenesis  of  pomalidomide-induced 
neutropenia and pancytopenia has not been elucidated.
Viral infection/reactivation  in patients receiving  pomalidomide  is likely  to 
be  caused  by  many  factors  including  underlying  MM,  cumulative 
immunosuppression and a generally older population.
Evidence source and strength of 
evidence 
In  non-clinical  studies,  decreased  WBC  counts  (neutrophils,  lymphocytes, 
and monocytes) were observed. 
In the clinical studies, infection was the most common non-haematological 
toxicity reported in patients who received pomalidomide, and approximately 
half of the events were Grade 3 or 4. The most commonly reported adverse 
reactions in clinical studies have been blood and lymphatic system disorders

Risk factors and risk groups 
Neutropenia
By  far the most  common  cause  of  neutropenia in  oncology  practice  is the 
myelosuppressive effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation treatment. 
Because  of  their  relatively  short  life  spans,  neutrophils  are  particularly 
sensitive to the effects of recently administered chemotherapy, and nadirs of 
neutrophil  counts  are  frequently  observed  7  to  10  days  following  the 
administration of chemotherapy. Less commonly, antibodies to neutrophils, 
bone marrow infiltration with disruption of normal marrow stromal function, 
and  splenic  sequestration  can  play  a  role.  Although  there  are  several 
glycoproteins with effects on neutrophil precursor cells including interleukin

3,  granulocyte  macrophage  colony  stimulating  factor,  and  macrophage 
colony stimulating factor, G CSF seems to be the primary regulator of basal 
and emergency neutrophil production as well as mature neutrophil function. 
There are also negative regulatory factors of neutrophil production that are 
less  well  understood,  including  neutrophil  elastase  and  the  src  family 
kinases.  Neutropenia  can  also  result  from  decreased  neutrophil  survival 
associated with immune destruction, sequestration, consumption at sites of 
infection, and the effects of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis 
factor.54
Pancytopenia
The  underlying  aetiology  and  presentation  for  pancytopenia  can  include 
aplastic  anaemia,  megaloblastic  anaemia,  MDS,  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukaemia,  hypersplenism,  NHL,  MM,  acute  myeloblastic  leukaemia  and 
chronic myelocytic leukaemia.55
GvHD  has  also  been  described  within the  literature  as  contributory  to  the 
onset  of  pancytopenia. 56 A  comprehensive  review  of  61 articles  and 
87 patients with pancytopenia onset after liver transplantation noted the most 
frequent presenting symptoms prior to the diagnosis of GVHD included rash 
(94.2%), fever (66.6%), diarrhoea (54%), and pancytopenia (54%). 
Diabetes mellitus type II may also contribute to the onset of pancytopenia. 
Several  cross  sectional  studies  and  case  reports  have  documented  that  an 
increased frequency of vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes 
mellitus  type  II  is  commonly  related  to  inadequate  dietary  intake  or 
malabsorption. Metformin use has been unequivocally demonstrated as the 
prime  factor  associated  with  vitamin  B12  deficiency  among  patients  with 
diabetes  mellitus  type  II.  Studies  assessing  type  2  diabetic  patients on 
metformin have reported the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency to range 
from 5.8% to 33%. Patients enrolled in this study were those who were on 
high  dose  (> 2 g/day)  and  long-term  (4  years)  metformin  treatment,  both 
clinical factors known to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. In the 
absence of concurrent comorbidity like renal and hepatic dysfunction, recent 
guidelines  advocate  for  the  use  of  metformin  as  the  first-line  glucose 
lowering agent concurrently with life-style modification approaches. Despite 
its  superior  glycaemic  lowering  effect,  metformin has long been  shown to 
decrease vitamin B12 levels compounding the risk of megaloblastic anaemia. 
The  risk  of  developing  metformin  associated  vitamin  B12  deficiency  is 
greatly influenced by increasing age, metformin dose and duration of use.57
Severe hepatocellular disease has also demonstrated a relative relationship 
to  anaemia  and  pancytopenia.  This  may  include  acute  or  chronic 
gastrointestinal  haemorrhage,  and  hypersplenism  secondary  to  portal 
hypertension.  Severe  hepatocellular  disease  predisposes  to  haemorrhage 
because  of  impaired  blood  coagulation  caused  by  deficiency  of  blood 
coagulation factors synthesised by hepatocytes. Aplastic anaemia, which is 
characterised by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow may follow the 
development of hepatitis. In patients with chronic liver disease, anaemia may 
be exacerbated by deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12.58,59

Numerous  disease-related  and  chemotherapy-induced  factors  render  the 
subject with cancer at increased risk for infection.60 These include the type 
of  cancer,  depth  and  duration  of  neutropenia,  and  impairments  in  cellular 
function caused by cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs; breaches in the 
integument from surgical procedures, presence of indwelling plastic venous 
catheters,  or  mucositis  of

immunosuppressive  effect,  including  impaired  chemotaxis  and  killing  by 
neutrophils,  impaired  T-cell  function,  and  alterations  in  skin  and  mucosal 
barriers. Long-term or high-dose steroid therapy is a significant risk factor 
for invasive fungal infections in particular; such therapy also may predispose 
affected subjects to development of bacterial infections and Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis reactivation.

One US study that utilised the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 
(SEER)-Medicare database reported that elderly cancer patients run a 1.2 to 
2.4 times  higher  risk  of  developing  VZV  than  those  without  cancer. 
Additional noted risk factors for developing VZV included age, gender, race, 
therapies 
immunosuppressive 
(eg, haematologic  cancer  patients:  autologous  and  allogeneic  stem  cell 
transplants;  solid  cancer  patients:  radiotherapy).  Haematologic  or  solid 
cancer  patients  with  immunocompromising  conditions ran a higher risk  of 
developing VZV, as did haematologic cancer patients who received stem cell 
transplants (despite the routine use of prophylaxis post-transplant). Cancer 
patients aged 75 to 85 years old had a higher risk of developing VZV than 
patients 85 years and older which may be attributed to the different treatment 
approaches  (ie, more  aggressive  chemotherapies  used  in  younger patients, 
inducing  greater  immune  suppression)  and  may  lead  to  different  VZV 
risks.61 For patients with haematologic malignancies, the risk of developing 
shingles  increases  from  13%  to  55%  the  year  after  a  stem  cell  transplant 
(SCT).62
factors 
for  HBV 
reactivation 
Risk 
include  baseline  HBV  DNA 
> 105 copies/mL, baseline ALT levels, HBeAg seropositivity, corticosteroid 
therapy,  anthracyclines, rituximab,  male  sex,  younger  age, and  underlying 
disease  of  lymphoma  or  breast  cancer.63,64 The  most  common  causes  of 
HBV  reactivation  are  the  immunosuppression  regimens  adopted  in  solid 
organ transplantation,  chemotherapy  for  onco-haematological  diseases  and

immunosuppressive  drugs  used  in  the  treatment  of  autoimmune  diseases. 
The immunosuppressive properties related to chemotherapy can cause flares 
of HBV in people who carry HBsAg in their serum. Flares can occur despite 
normal baseline serum ALT levels and can lead to HBV-related morbidity 
and mortality.65 The rate of HBV reactivation after allogeneic BMT ranges 
14%  to  50%,  with  a  lesser  rate  in  autologous  BMT;  risk  factors  include 
corticosteroid  use,  donor  HBsAg  antibody  sero-negativity,  and GVHD.64
The time-to-recovery  of cellular immunity after peripheral blood stem cell 
transplantation is 3 to 5 months, which is the time course during which HBV 
reactivation has been documented.66
Preventability
The major dose-limiting toxicities of pomalidomide include neutropenia.
Neutropenia can be managed with dose reduction. Dosing recommendations 
in the event of neutropenia can be found in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. Subjects 
may  require  use  of  blood  product  support  and/or  growth  factors  (SmPC, 
Sections 4.2 and 4.4).
Monitoring  of  subjects,  particularly  in  the  initial  weeks  of  treatment,  is 
important to reduce the risk of myelosuppression-related complications like 
infection,  fatigue,  or  weakness.  A  dose  modification  may  be  required 
(SmPC,  Section  4.4).  Complete  blood  cell  counts  should  be  monitored  at 
baseline,  weekly  for  the  first  8  weeks  of  pomalidomide  treatment  and 
monthly thereafter (SmPC, Section 4.4) to monitor for haematologic adverse 
reactions, especially neutropenia.
Infections  and  infestations  is  included  in  Section 4.8  of  the  SmPC,  with 
herpes zoster listed as a common ADR and hepatitis B reactivation listed as 
unknown frequency.
Infections  text  added  to  Section 4.4  of  the  SmPC,  based  on  the  PRAC 
Assessment Report for Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 4 (reporting 
period 08-Feb-2015 to 07-Aug-2015) warns that HBV reactivation has been 
reported  rarely  in  patients  receiving  pomalidomide  in  combination  with 
dexamethasone  and  some  cases 
to  acute  hepatic  failure  and 
discontinuation  of  pomalidomide.  This  text  also  advises  that  HBV  status 
should  be  established  before  initiating  treatment  with  pomalidomide  and 
recommends that patients who test positive for HBV infection consult with 
a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B. It advises caution 
when pomalidomide is used in combination with dexamethasone in patients 
previously infected with HBV. It also advises these patients should be closely 
monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of active  HBV  infection  throughout 
therapy.

MM  entered into  UK  MRC trials  from  1980 to  2002,14 demonstrated  that 
there  was  a  significant  correlation  between  early  death  and  neutropenia 
(P < 0.01),  and  that  death  within  60 days  of  trial  entry  occurred  in 
299 subjects  (10%).  Forty-five  percent  of  these  deaths  were  directly 
attributable to bacterial infection: pneumonia in 89 (66%), generalised sepsis 
in  31 (23%)  and  other infections  in  15 (11%).  Neutropenia was  present at 
diagnosis in only 11 of the 135 deaths attributed to infection.
Neutropenia is a critically important problem in oncology practice for two 
reasons.  First,  neutropenia  is  the  major  factor  driving  the  risk  of  life 
threatening infections, one of the most serious and costly toxicities of cancer 
treatment.54 Second, neutropenia frequently results in substantial reductions 
in the delivered dose intensity of chemotherapy, causing even subjects with 
curable  malignancies  to  receive  less  than  the  planned,  optimal  antitumour
treatment.  For  both  reasons,  good  neutropenia  management  is  essential  in 
oncology care.54
Pancytopenia  occurs  frequently  in  subjects with  malignancies  who  are 
receiving myelosuppressive or myeloablative therapies.
A Safety Topic Review in which a cumulative search was performed in the 
BMS safety database through 24-Jul-2013 did not confirm an independent 
relationship  between  pomalidomide 
therapy  and  the  appearance  of 
pancytopenia.
The  risk  minimisation  activities  put  in  place  to  control  pancytopenia  are 
considered adequate to prevent the risk of severe pancytopenia.
A large study using population-based data from Sweden to estimate the risk 
of  bacterial  and  viral  infections  among  9610  MM  patients  compared  to 
37,718 matched controls demonstrated that MM patients had a 6-fold (hazard 
ratio = 5.9; 95% CI = 5.7-6.1) risk of developing any infection compared to 
matched controls.67 Infection is frequently associated with early mortality in 
subjects with MM.
Herpes zoster virus-specific cell-mediated immunity keeps VZV in latency 
and prevents its reactivation.68 Reviews have reported that the prevalence of 
latent  VZV  in  the  normal  population  ranges  from  63%  to  100%. 69 A 
retrospective  analysis  reported that  in  general,  MM  patients have  shown a

HBV  persists  for  decades  in  patients  following recovery  from  acute  HBV 
infection  during  which  it  is  controlled  by  the  immune  system.  Therefore, 
situations  that  lead  to  immunosuppression  in  patients  with  chronic  HBV 
infection  may  alter  the  natural  history  of  this  infection  and  give  rise  to 
reactivation.

Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding
Potential mechanisms 
Evidence source and strength of 
evidence 
The pathogenesis of pomalidomide-induced thrombocytopenia has not been 
described.
Decreased platelets in the blood and bleeding occur due to MM so may occur 
during treatment with pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone. In 
addition,  pomalidomide  may  cause  reductions  in  platelet  numbers  which 
make patients more prone to bleeding.

Table 2.7.3.1-3:
Important Identified Risk: Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding
Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding
Risk factors and risk groups 
The  rate  of  blood  cell  production  is  both  tightly  regulated  and  highly 
variable.  Under  conditions  of  either  increased  destruction  of  cells,  such  as 
bleeding, haemolysis, or immune destruction of platelets, production rates of 
appropriate cells increase several fold. The regulation of this dynamic system 
is  complex  but  for  practical purposes  can  be  conceived  of  as involving  an 
interaction between a pool of pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells, capable 
of both infinite self-renewal and differentiation into mature blood cells and 
regulatory  factors,  including  both  a  well-characterised  set of  glycoprotein 
haematopoietic growth factors and a less well-understood group of inhibitory 
factors.54
The primary regulator of the platelet count in humans is thrombopoietin, a 
glycoprotein that is produced primarily in the liver and cleared primarily by 
platelets  and 
their  precursors.  Thrombopoietin  induces  growth  and 
development  of  megakaryocytes;  levels  fluctuate  with  changes  in  platelet 
count due to variations in clearance. Thrombocytopenia that is encountered 
in  oncology  practice  may  be  due  to  the  effects  of  chemotherapy,  or  after 
multiple  cycles  of  treatment,  liver  disease  with  decreased  thrombopoietin 
in  subjects  with  lymphoid 
immune  destruction,  particularly 
levels, 
malignancies or infection with HIV, and sequestration. 
The  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  increases  with  advanced 
age.71 Individuals  aged60 years  and  older  account  for  35%  to  45%  of  all 
cases of acute UGIB. A review of epidemiology studies of the complications 
of  peptic  ulcer  disease  reported  annual  incidence  rates  of  haemorrhage 
ranging from 0.19 to 0.57 per 1000 persons in the general population and an 
annual incidence of 0.79 per 1000 persons older than 60 years of age.72 A 
prospective study of patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at 
the National University Hospital of Iceland reported annual incidence rates 
of acute UGIB by age group as follows: 0.30 per 1000 individuals aged 18 to 
24 years,  0.15  per  1000  individuals  aged  25  to  39 years,  0.48 per  1000 
individuals  aged  40  to  59  years,  2.13  per  1000  individuals  aged  60  to 
79 years, and 5.70 per 1000 individuals aged 80 and older.73
Relatively  common  medications  in  the  elderly  that  may  predispose 
individuals to gastrointestinal haemorrhage include aspirin and NSAIDs. A 
meta-analysis of 24 randomised controlled trials (almost 66,000 participants) 
revealed  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  in  2.47%  of  patients  taking  aspirin 
compared with 1.42% taking placebo.74 A medical record review conducted 
in Japan reported incidence rates for UGIB of 2.65 and 1.29 per 1000 users 
of  low-dose  aspirin  and  NSAIDs,  respectively. 75 A  study  using  the  UK 
General Practice Research Database (GPRD) reported a RR of 4.1 (95% CI: 
3.5-4.7)  of  UGIB  associated  with  current  NSAID  use  (Hernández-Díaz, 
2001a).  Given  previously  published  incidence  rates  of  hospitalisation  for 
peptic ulcer disease among nonusers of NSAIDs of 1 per 1000 person-years, 
Hernández-Díaz76 reported that this risk translates to more than 3 additional 
cases per 1000 exposed persons per year. Also in the UK GPRD study, the 
risk of serious UGIB or perforation among current users of systemic steroids 
(85%  of  which  was  prednisolone)  was  RR = 1.8.  The  risk  was  greater 
(RR = 2.9) among users with steroid doses ≥ 30 mg prednisone, but the test

for dose-response was non-significant.77 Steroids were similarly associated 
with bleeding OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3-2.4) and perforations (OR = 1.6; 95% 
CI:  0.9-3.1).  Simultaneous  use  of  steroids  with  low-medium  and high 
NSAID  doses,  respectively,  produced  ORs  of  4.0  (95% CI: 1.3-12.0)  and 
12.7 (95% CI: 6.2-26.1), compared with users of none.78
Thrombocytopenia  can  be  managed  with  dose  reduction.  Dosing 
recommendations in the event of thrombocytopenia can be found in Section 
4.2 of the SmPC. Subjects may require use of blood product support and/or 
growth factors (SmPC, Section 4.4). 
Monitoring  of  subjects,  particularly  in  the  initial  weeks  of  treatment,  is 
important to reduce  the risk  of  myelosuppression related  complications.  A 
dose  modification may  be  required.  Complete  blood  cell  counts  should  be 
monitored  at  baseline,  weekly  for  the  first  8  weeks  of  pomalidomide 
treatment  and  monthly  thereafter  (SmPC,  Section 4.4)  to  monitor  for 
haematologic adverse reactions.
Physicians should observe patients for signs of bleeding including epistaxes, 
especially with use of concomitant medicinal products known to increase the 
risk of bleeding (SmPC, Section 4.4).
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage is listed as a common ADR in Section 4.8 of 
the SmPC.
Events of thrombocytopenia and bleeding leading to drug discontinuation in 
the  RRMM  clinical  studies  (Studies MM-002,  MM-003and IFM-2009-02) 
were experienced by 3 (0.7%) and 1 (0.2%) subjects, respectively.
Further  details  of  the  risk  minimisation  measures  for  the  risk  of 
thrombocytopenia and bleeding are outlined in Part V.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance 
of the product
Moderate  impact  - local  or  non-invasive  intervention,  or  limited  invasive 
intervention (platelet transfusion) needed.
Public health impact 
Disorders of blood cell production are frequently observed in subjects with 
cancer. Under ordinary conditions in the healthy adult, blood cell production 
is  extraordinarily  prolific,  with  daily  outputs  in  the  range  of  2 × 1011 
erythrocytes,  5 × 1010  neutrophils,  and  2.5 × 1011  platelets,  as  well  as 
substantial numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, antigen processing cells, 
eosinophils  and  basophils.  With  more  than  5 million  blood  cells  produced 
every  second  under  ordinary  conditions,  the  mitotic  yield  of  normal  bone 
marrow  is  greater  than  that  of  almost  any malignancy.  It  is  not  surprising 
therefore  that  thrombocytopenia  is  a  frequent  unintended  consequence  of 
cancer  treatments.54 Haemorrhage  is  a  very  frequently  observed  AE  in 
subjects with MM due to disorders of blood cell production. Approximately 
15% of subjects with MM develop haemorrhage.79 Thrombocytopenia is a 
common ADR associated with lenalidomide and thalidomide.
In a retrospective case series of 2584 patients with MM, 24 (0.93%) patients 
had  gastrointestinal  involvement  documented  by  tissue  biopsy,  with 
haemorrhage.30

(3/24  or  13%)  and  was  more  typically  seen  later  in  the  course  of  disease 
(21/24 or 88%) often developing following SCT.
In two reported case studies, MM patients experienced amyloidosis-induced 
gastrointestinal bleeding.80,81 Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with 
MM  have  associated  amyloidosis. 82 , 83 The  cause  of  gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage during the course of MM is likely to be multifactorial. Other 
possible  causes  include  mucosal  changes  attributable  to  bone  marrow 
suppression, immunodeficiency, infections, and prior history of peptic ulcer 
disease.31
Thrombocytopenia  has  been  associated  with  pomalidomide  treatment. 
Previous/concomitant  anti-MM  therapies  and  severity  of  the  underlying 
disease are also important in the thrombocytopenia and subsequent bleeding 
risks.  The  risk  minimisation  activities  put  in  place  to  control  the 
thrombocytopenias are thus considered adequate to prevent the risk of severe 
thrombocytopenia  and  bleeding  risks.  In  addition,  the  risk  minimisation 
activities put in place to control gastrointestinal haemorrhage are considered 
adequate to prevent the risk of severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

Based  on  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  for  PSUR  2  (reporting  period: 
08-Feb-2014  to  07-Aug-2014), the  PRAC  Assessor agreed with  the  MAH 
that there is not enough evidence at the moment to include gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage in the product information; however, the MAH should keep this 
event under close review in the next PSUR and provide CIOMS forms for 
new cases. Based on the PRAC Assessment Report for PSUR 4 (reporting 
period  08-Feb-2015  to  07-Aug-2015),  the  PRAC  requested  the  MAH  to 
update  the  SmPC  to  include  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  in  Section 4.8 
(tabulated list of adverse reactions) and that haemorrhagic disorders is added 
to the description of selected AEs in Section 4.8. The PRAC also requested 
the addition of gastrointestinal haemorrhage to the important identified risk 
of thrombocytopenia and bleeding.

Cardiac symptoms in patients with MM can often be due to anaemia and may 
be  due  to  iron  overload  and  side  effects  of  therapy84 and  possible  fluid 
overload. General risk factors for CHF include increasing age, previous heart 
disease,  diabetes,  hypertension,  amyloidosis,  and  previous  anthracycline 
treatment. 85 Cardiotoxicity  of  anthracyclines 
based  chemotherapy 
(eg, doxorubicin,  daunorubicin  and  epirubicin)  is  usually  cumulative  and 
dose dependent. Risk factors include older age, pre-existing heart disease and 
hypertension.86

Data source
MedDRA terms
Possible  monitoring  of  patients  with  known  medical  history  that  may  be 
contributory to a cardiac failure event should be carried out by the treating 
physician. Additionally, if serious infection occurs in patients, they should 
be  monitored/assessed/observed  for  cardiac  failure  symptoms/events. 
Section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  states  that  patients  with  significant  cardiac 
dysfunction (CHF [New York Heart Association Class III or IV]; MI within 
12 months of starting study; unstable or poorly controlled angina pectoris) 
were  excluded  from  clinical  studies  with  pomalidomide.  Cardiac  events, 
including  congestive  cardiac  failure,  pulmonary  oedema  and  atrial 
fibrillation have been reported, mainly in patients with pre-existing cardiac 
disease or cardiac risk factors. Appropriate caution should be exercised when 
considering  the  treatment  of  such  patients  with  pomalidomide,  including 
periodic monitoring for signs or symptoms of cardiac events.
Further  details  of  the  risk  minimisation  measures  for  the  risk  of  cardiac 
failure are outlined in Part V.
Can have mild to severe to life-threatening or fatal impact. Symptoms can be 
mild with moderate activity or exertion to severe with minimal activity or at 
rest.  Non-invasive  intervention  to  urgent  continuous  intervention  (eg,  IV, 
mechanical haemodynamic support) indicated.
Heart  failure  is  a  disease  of  the  elderly,  and  the  prevalence  increases 
dramatically  with  age.87 Congestive  heart  failure  is  predominantly  caused 
by cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and 
valvular  heart  disease.  Chemotherapeutic  drugs  with  potential  ability  to 
induce or exacerbate heart failure include anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, 
paclitaxel, mitocantrone, 5-fluorouracil, and cytarabin. High-output cardiac 
failure is one of the known cardiovascular issues associated with MM and is 
frequently seen in patients with extensive bone lesions.88
An  association  between  cardiac  failure  and  pomalidomide  combined  with 
dexamethasone or pomalidomide alone has not been established.

Potential mechanisms 
No mechanism whereby pomalidomide may cause second malignancies has 
been identified.
While  none  of  the  following  may  be  exclusive  there  may  be  several 
explanations  why  patients  with  MM  might  develop  secondary  cancers, 
including:

Treatment-related
Change of natural disease history as a result of improved survival in recent 
years.
 As a consequence of the use of alkylating agents
Prolonged immunosuppression (cytopenias).
Use of G-CSF, especially in combination with high-dose chemotherapy.
Increased surveillance of cancer patients.
As a consequence of selective reporting.

Syndromic
Cytogenetic factors associated with MM.
Exposure to environmental agents (hypothetical).
Evidence source and strength of 
evidence 
Patients treated with pomalidomide may be at an increased risk of developing 
new  cancers  (including  skin  cancers).  In  clinical  studies,  NMSC  has  been 
reported in patients receiving pomalidomide. Drug reaction with eosinophilia 
and  systemic  symptoms,  toxic  epidermal necrolysis  and  Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome have been observed in the postmarketing setting.

tobacco  use,  photosensitive  drugs,  and  viral  infections  (human  papilloma 
virus,  HIV)  have  been reported  to  be  associated  with  NMSC  in  rare 
instances.90
Rates of NMSC are higher in men as compared to women. NMSC rates are 
also  higher  in  older  age  groups.  One  study  based  on  the  US  insured

A comprehensive systematic review of the published literature reported that 
the  global  incidence  of  NMSC  ranges  from  greater  than  1000 per 
100,000 person-years 
than  1 per 
100,000 person-years in some areas of Africa.89 In Europe, the incidence of 
BCC  ranges  from  33.6  per  100,000 person-years  in  Croatia  to  115.6 per 
100,000  person-years  in  the  UK  while  SCC  ranges  from  8.9  per 
100,000 person-years in Croatia to 31.7 per 100,000 person-years in Wales 
(Lomas, 2012). In North America, the incidence of BCC ranges from 147 per 
100,000 person-years in Canada to 935.9 per 100,000 person-years in the US 
(Arizona) while SCC ranges from 60.2 per 100,000 person-years in Canada 
to  290  per  100,000 person-years  in  the  US  (New  Mexico).89 The  highest 
rates of NMSC in the world have been reported in Australia. The incidence 
of  BCC  in  Australia  was  884  per  100,000  person-years  while  SCC  was 
387 per 100,000 person-years.89
NMSC  has  also  been  observed  as  a  second  primary  cancer  among  cancer 
patients  in  a  few  studies.  In  a  study  following  a  cohort  of  people  who 
developed  cancers  in  childhood  and  survived  for  5 years  or  more,  the 
incidence of BCC was 168.4 per 100,000 person-years in those less than 35, 
1449.3  per  100,000 person-years  for  those  35  to  44  and  3785.9  per 
100,000 person-years  for  those  45 to  54. 92 The  highest  proportion  of 
reported cases was among those with Hodgkin’s and leukaemia. In a pooled 
analysis  of  lenalidomide  clinical trials,  the  incidence rate  of  NMSC  in the 
placebo/dexamethasone  arm  was  0.91  per  100  person-years  in  MM 
patients.93 An  analysis  of  the  Swedish  Cancer  Registry  reported  a  SIR  of 
2.22 for second primary NMSC in MM patients as compared to the general 
population.27
A Safety Topic Review of NMSC in patients treated with pomalidomide in 
which  a  cumulative  search  was  performed  in  the  BMS safety  database 
through 15-Jul-2015 did not determine a causal association between NMSC 
and pomalidomide.
Based  on  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  for  PSUR 4  (reporting  period 
08-Feb-2015 to 07-Aug-2015), the PRAC requested the MAH to update the 
SmPC to include NMSC in Sections 4.4 and 4.8. In addition, based on PRAC 
assessment NMSC was added to the RMP as an important identified risk.

Potential mechanisms 
No mechanism whereby pomalidomide may cause second malignancies has 
been identified.
While  none  of  the  following  may  be  exclusive  there  may  be  several 
explanations  why  patients  with  MM  might  develop  secondary  cancers, 
including:

Treatment-related
Change of natural disease history as a result of improved survival in recent 
years.
 As a consequence of the use of alkylating agents
Prolonged immunosuppression (cytopenias).
Use of G-CSF, especially in combination with high-dose chemotherapy.
Increased surveillance of cancer patients.
As a consequence of selective reporting.

Syndromic
Cytogenetic factors associated with MM.
Exposure to environmental agents (hypothetical).
Evidence source and strength of 
evidence 
Patients treated with pomalidomide may be at an increased risk of developing 
new cancers. In clinical studies, SPM has been reported in patients receiving 
pomalidomide.

Travis29 has grouped second primary cancers into three major groups based 
on  the  predominant  etiologic  factors  ie,  treatment  related,  syndromic,  and 
those due to shared etiologic factors, while emphasising the non-exclusivity 
of these groups. In the following, possible explanations for the epidemiologic 
findings presented in the previous section will be discussed.

Prolonged survival as a result of improved therapies
Due  to  improvements  in  the  care  of  patients  with  cancer,  the  number  of 
cancer  survivors  has  been  increasing  in  recent  years.  Increased  longevity 
increases the risk of developing a second malignancy, whether due to the late 
sequelae  of  treatment,  lifestyle  factors,  environmental  exposures,  or  host 
factors  (eg,  aging,  genetic  factors,  gene-environment  interactions),  or  a 
combination  of  these  factors.  Second  solid tumours are a  leading  cause  of 
mortality among several populations of long-term survivors.
As  reported  from  the  SEER  Cancer  Statistics Review  1975  to  2009,  the 
5-year  relative  survival  among  MM  patients  has  increased  from  25.1% 
among patients first diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 to 42.6% among patients first 
diagnosed between 2002 and 2008 (p < 0.05). Among patients aged less than 
65 years at first diagnosis between 2002 and 2008, 5-year relative survival is 
54.4%; among those aged 65 years and older, survivorship is 31.3%.94
 Heredity
Additional  insight  has  also  been  obtained  in  elucidating  the  risk  of 
malignancies  in  close  family  members  of  patients  affected  by  MM.  The 
available data show an increased risk of more than one malignancy in MM 
patients and first-degree relatives compared to the general population. The 
reason for this finding is still unclear but may clearly involve risk conferred 
by shared genetic factors.95,96
SPM,  such  as  NMSC,  have  been  reported 
in  patients  receiving 
pomalidomide.  Physicians  should  carefully  evaluate  patients  before  and 
during treatment using standard cancer screening for occurrence of SPM and 
institute treatment as indicated (SmPC, Section 4.4).

Dores25 undertook  an  analysis  of  all  second  primary  cancers  among 
23,838 MM patients in  the  SEER-9  Cancer  Registries  from  1973  to  2000. 
Non-melanoma skin cancers are not reportable to the SEER programme and 
therefore  are  not  included  in  these  data.  The  authors  reported  that 
among patients of all ages, the overall risk of second primary cancer was not 
increased (SIR = 0.98; 95% CI 0.93-1.04). Despite these findings, research 
has identified an elevated risk of specific forms, in particular MDS, AML, 
NHL and Kaposi sarcoma in North American and European populations. 
Increased risk of second cancer was shown in the SEER analysis by Dores25
for patients  less  than  70 years  of  age  (SIR = 1.09).  Within  this  age  group, 
increased risks  were associated  with  AML  (SIR = 13.43), Kaposi  sarcoma 
(SIR = 4.89),  melanoma  of  skin  (SIR = 1.67)  and  cancer  of  the  urinary 
bladder  (SIR = 1.62).  Among subjects  aged  ≥ 70 years,  significantly 
increased risks were observed for AML (SIR = 4.62) and for chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (SIR = 2.79). In this study, the risk for NHL was not significantly 
elevated  over  the  entire  time  period,  but  was  noted  to  be  significantly 
elevated at 5 to 9 years (SIR = 2.02) and most of these may be assumed to be 
B-cell malignancies. 
Among patients  of  all  ages  in  the  SEER  analysis,  the  risk  of  AML  in 
MM patients  was  highly  elevated  overall  (SIR = 8.32)  and  followed  an 
inverted-U curve by duration of follow-up, with statistically significant risk 
increases  noted  at  1  to  4  years  of  follow-up (SIR = 7.21),  5  to  9  years  of 
follow-up (SIR = 18.53) and > 10 years of follow-up (SIR = 11.52).
Cannon,97 looking  at  SEER  data  for  MM  and  Kaposi  sarcoma  during  the 
period 1973 to 1995, found significant associations between MM and Kaposi 
sarcoma  (SIR = 5.42),  NHL  (SIR = 1.51),  cancer  of  the  urinary  bladder 
(SIR = 1.42),  the  colon  (SIR = 1.25)  and  of  the  prostate  (SIR = 1.13), 
including synchronous cases diagnosed at the same time as MM that were 
excluded from the previous study. 
Dong24 summarised  the  risk  of  second  primary  neoplasms  among 
8656 myeloma patients  in  the  Swedish  Family  Cancer  Database  1958  to 
1996.  Overall,  475 subsequent  malignancies  were  observed.  Again,  the 
overall  risk  of  a  second  malignancy  was  not  increased  (SIR = 0.94).
However, the  aggregate risk  of  haematolymphoproliferative  disorders  was 
significantly  elevated  (SIR = 2.19),  driven  primarily  by  a  significantly 
increased risk  for myeloid  leukaemia  (SIR = 8.19)  and  NHL  (SIR = 1.74). 
The risk of developing myeloid leukaemia was greatest 1 to 9 years after the 
initial diagnosis (SIR = 9.50).
In  a  large  systematic  evaluation  of  population-based  data  from  Sweden, 
Mailankody27 found that compared to the general population, MM patients 
had a 1.26-fold increased risk of developing any secondary malignancy and

pomalidomide
Table 2.7.3.1-6:

Other Second Primary Malignancies
an 11-fold increased risk of developing AML/MDS. In exploratory analyses, 
the  authors  demonstrated  that  the  risk  of  AML/MDS  among  MM patients 
diagnosed prior to the introduction of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs; pre 
2000  in  Sweden;  SIR = 13.51  [95%  CI  8.83-19.80])  was  not  significantly 
different  to patients  diagnosed  after  IMiDs  introduction  (follow-up  until 
2006, ie, when thalidomide was the only IMiD in use; SIR = 8.35 [95% CI 
4.17-14.94]).  However,  as  the  actual  usage  of  IMiD  therapy  in  Sweden 
during the study period was relatively low and the follow-up time restricted, 
these analyses should be interpreted with caution.
One  large  clinical  case  series  by  Hasskarl26 described  the  occurrence  of 
metachronous  malignancy  among  589 myeloma patients  identified  during 
1997  to  2008  at  one  large  university  centre  in  Germany.  Of  interest, 
41/589 patients (7%) had a malignancy other than MM diagnosed either prior 
to or at the same time as MM. These prior or synchronous neoplasms were 
composed of colorectal (7), gynaecologic (7), skin including melanoma (6), 
renal-urothelial  (6),  prostate  (4),  and  others.  There  were  7 lymphomas 
diagnosed, of which 6 were mature B-cell neoplasms which occurred prior 
to or synchronously. Fewer patients experienced second cancer after an MM 
diagnosis  (18/589;  3%).  Among  the  latter,  haematologic  malignancies, 
specifically AML/MDS, were the most common, being identified at the same 
time in one patient and after the MM diagnosis in 5 patients.
As  survival  after  a  diagnosis of  cancer  improves,  identification  and 
quantification  of  the  late  effects  of  cancer  and  its  therapy  have  become 
critical. Generally, new cancer is considered to be  one of the most serious 
events  experienced  by  cancer  survivors.  The  number  of patients  with
multiple  primary  cancers  is  growing  rapidly,  with  independent  second 
malignancies now comprising about 16% of incident cancers reported to the 
National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  SEER  Programme  in  2003.  Moreover, 
second tumours may be a cause of mortality among several populations of 
long-term  survivors.29 It  should  be  noted, however,  that  the  risk  of  dying 
from  MM  is  considerably  higher  than  the  risk  of  developing  a  second 
cancer.98
Based  on  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  for  PSUR 4  (reporting  period 
08-Feb-2015  to  07-Aug-2015),  NMSC  was  added  to  the  RMP  as  an 
important  identified  risk  and  the  important  potential  risk  of  SPM  was 
redefined as other SPM.

The frequency of SAEs of Grade 3, 4 or 5 was low in both treatment groups.
The AnTicoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) study 
showed  that  AF  occurred  more  often  in  men  than  in  women  and  the 
prevalence  rates  were  0.1%  in people  < 55  years  of  age  to  3.8%  in  those

No  mechanisms  by  which  pomalidomide  may  cause  cardiac  arrhythmias 
have  been  identified.  Section  4.4  of  the SmPC states  that  patients  with 
significant cardiac dysfunction (CHF [New York Heart Association Class III

mild  or  moderate  with  no  or  minimal  non-invasive  medical  intervention 
indicated. Severe or life-threatening symptoms may warrant urgent invasive 
intervention (eg, pacemaker, ablation).
AF is the most prevalent major arrhythmia in the elderly.100 In the US, 80% 
of AF occurs in patients over the age of 65 years. In the Framingham Heart 
Study, 2.2% of men had AF and women had a slightly lower prevalence of 
1.7%.100 Drug-induced  cardiotoxicity  may  present  as  drug-induced 
arrhythmia.101
Patients  who  develop  AF  are  at  increased  risk  of  serious  cardiovascular 
complications, such as heart failure and ischaemic stroke.101 However, an 
association between cardiac arrhythmias and pomalidomide in combination 
with dexamethasone or pomalidomide alone cannot be established.

PART III:  PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
Routine Pharmacovigilance activities in BMS as described in the BMS Pharmacovigilance System 
Master  File  and  Drug  Safety’s  Standard  Operating  Procedures  are  in  accordance  with  “Good 
Pharmacovigilance Practices in the EU”.
In addition to expedited reporting, BMS vigilantly undertakes follow-up on all ADRs, including 
serious  ADRs  that  are  provided  to  health  authorities  to  ensure  that  all  details  of  the  case  are 
captured for optimal clinical evaluation. This  includes efforts to obtain all relevant  information 
and to establish the final outcome of the ADRs.
3.1.1
An Analysis of Adverse Drug Reactions of Special Interest within the 
Required PSURs
Emerging  potential  safety  signals  can  be  detected  by  periodic  and  if  appropriate,  cumulative 
evaluation of the ADRs. The results are compiled in the PSUR with summaries and conclusions 
submitted to the health authorities. PSURs are submitted in accordance with “Guidelines on Good 
112
EU Risk Management Plan
BMS-986379
Version 17.0
pomalidomide
Pharmacovigilance Practices in the EU”. Periodicity of the PSUR submissions is defined by the 
most current EURD list. 
In  addition,  data  regarding  pregnancy  exposure  to  pomalidomide  are  targeted  for  review  and 
specifically  discussed  in  the  PSUR  document.  These  data  include  all  pregnancy  case  reports 
collected during the specified period together with cumulative data. Non-medically confirmed case 
reports of suspected foetal exposure are also provided, whenever applicable. Non-patient exposure 
in  pregnant  females  (eg,  a  nurse  opening  the  capsules,  laboratory  technician,  or  carer)  is  also 
provided with the corresponding outcome in each PSUR.
3.1.2
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities Beyond Adverse Reactions 
Reporting and Signal Detection
3.1.2.1
Specific Adverse Reaction Follow-up Questionnaire
For  events  of  special  interest,  materials  and  tools  (such  as  event-specific  questions)  have  been 
developed to ensure that consistent and good quality follow-up information can be obtained.
Event-specific questionnaires are used to collect adverse reaction and follow-up information for 
all of the important identified and potential risks (see Section 2.7.3). These forms are provided in 
Annex 4 of the RMP.
3.1.2.2
Other Forms of Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
Expedited Reporting and Follow-up of Pregnancy
The pregnancy capture and follow-up procedure is detailed below.
The  PPP  aims  to  minimise  the  risks  of  teratogenicity  by  ensuring  HCPs  and  patients  are  fully 
informed  of  and  understand  the  risks  of  teratogenicity  prior  to  starting  their  pomalidomide 
treatment. Like thalidomide and lenalidomide, pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with 
expected teratogenic effects in humans. Therefore, the core PPP for pomalidomide is based on the 
EU and EEA approved core PPP for lenalidomide and thalidomide. It reflects advice, guidance 
and  direction  obtained  from  the  Member  States during  the  implementation  process  for 
lenalidomide  and  thalidomide.  Where  possible  and  with  the  agreement  of  the  NCA,  BMS
harmonised  the  pomalidomide  PPP  with  the  already  implemented  lenalidomide  PPP  and/or 
thalidomide PPP in each Member State. In order to ensure there is a consistent approach with the 
ability  to  capture  all  information  globally,  the  same  principles  on  obtaining  follow-up  data  on 
pregnancies are implemented in all territories where pomalidomide is marketed whilst taking into 
account the legal and healthcare differences in those territories worldwide.
The objectives of the system are:
 To obtain information on all reported pregnancies of females exposed to pomalidomide.
 To obtain information on all reported pregnancies of female partners of male patients exposed 
to pomalidomide.
 To determine the root cause of all pregnancies and hence failures of the PPP.
113
EU Risk Management Plan
BMS-986379
Version 17.0
pomalidomide
In the EU, BMS uses the following method to enhance the capture of reports of pregnancy over 
and above reliance upon spontaneous reporting:
 Standard Initial Pregnancy Reporting Forms, which are included with each HCP Kit. 
 The Educational Materials in the Educational HCP’s Kit make reference to the requirement to 
report all suspected pregnancies to the local BMS office and where applicable to the NCA. The 
Patient Brochure also advises the patient to immediately seek medical advice if there is any 
risk  or  suspicion  of  possible  pregnancy.  Similar  advice  is  also  provided  with  reference  to 
female partners of male patients.
Database of Pregnancy Reports
All reports of pregnancies received by BMS are entered into BMS’s Global Safety Database. This 
includes all Consumer reports in addition to HCP reports. Any abnormal pregnancy test result (eg, 
β-hCG  elevated  and  positive  urine  pregnancy  test)  is  immediately  processed.  EU  Health 
Authorities are notified of these reports.

Frequency/Duration of Follow-up
Upon receipt of a notification of pregnancy, the HCP is asked to complete the Initial Pregnancy 
Report Form. The Initial Pregnancy Report Form includes a field for Estimated Date of Delivery. 
Upon receipt of this information by BMS, dates for further follow-up actions are tracked. 
The HCP/Obstetrician is also sent a Follow-Up and Outcome Form to be completed at the outcome 
of the Pregnancy. 
An  Infant  follow-up  form  is  available  for  use  in  the  event  that  a  birth  defect  is  detected  as  an 
outcome. 
Corresponding standard forms are available on request.
Root Cause of Failure of Pregnancy Prevention Programme
The Pregnancy Background Form includes questions to determine why the PPP was unsuccessful 
for the case in question.
Regulatory Reporting of Pregnancies
All initial pregnancy reports and follow-up information are reported on an expedited basis within 
15 days.

EU Risk Management Plan
BMS-986379
Version 17.0
pomalidomide
Should any suspected teratogenic effect be reported following treatment with pomalidomide, this 
is expedited immediately.
Compliance with the PPP is  monitored in each  member state. Examples of  methods to monitor 
compliance  include keeping a record of counselling patients prior to prescription, a record of a 
negative pregnancy test within 3 days of prescription and a record of dispensing within 7 days of 
the prescription date, etc. The maximum interval of consecutive PPP compliance studies is agreed 
on between BMS and individual NCAs.

PART V:  RISK MINIMISATION MEASURES (INCLUDING EVALUATION 
OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES)
The  core  requirements  of  the  PPP,  other  additional  risk  minimisation  measures  and  controlled 
access apply  across  all  Member  States, however,  the  local  implementation  may  differ  between 
Member States taking into account the local differences in healthcare delivery, legal framework, 
and  culture.  Therefore,  consultations  will  take  place  with  NCAs  to  determine  the  appropriate 
method of delivery of the PPP, other additional risk minimisation measures, and controlled access
system  in  each  Member  State. The  MAH  has  a  number  of  years’  experience  running  such  risk 
minimisation measures for both thalidomide and lenalidomide, and the pomalidomide programme 
is similar to existing thalidomide and lenalidomide programmes. However, in some countries, the 
more than 5  years  implemented controlled access system differs between products according to 
NCA agreement within one country. 
In  countries  where  pomalidomide  is  already  marketed,  DHPC  has  provided  the  most  important 
information on the safety and the risk minimisation measures to be taken in a non-promotional, 
clear and consistent way across the EU. The DHPC mentioned:
 That a PPP has been implemented in conjunction with the NCAs and the importance that the 
PPP should be adhered to.
 That educational HCP kits are available and will  be provided to them and that they are  not 
promotional material.
 The  approved  indication  to  reduce  “off-label”  use  with  a  different  target  population  with  a 
higher rate of women of childbearing potential impacted and the risk of teratogenicity.
It must also be noted that other activities aimed at minimising the risk of other safety concerns, 
such as myelosuppression are also included in the additional risk minimisation activities.

ADRs and neutropenia and infection are discussed in Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.
The PL warns that pomalidomide may cause a fall in the number of RBCs, 
WBCs, and platelets at the same time (pancytopenia), and describes possible 
symptoms. It also warns that if a patient has had HBV infection pomalidomide 
may cause the virus to become active again; therefore, the doctor is advised 
to check if the patient has ever had hepatitis B infection prior to pomalidomide 
treatment.  Infections,  including  shingles  and  recurrence  of  hepatitis B 
infection, are listed as possible side effects.
Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk:
Dose  modification  advice  for  neutropenia  is  included  in  Section  4.2  of  the 
SmPC.

Table 5.2-1:
Additional Risk Minimisation Measures
Pregnancy Prevention 
Programme
Objectives:
The BMS PPP is designed to minimise the risk of teratogenicity by:




Ensuring that exposure of an unborn child to pomalidomide does not occur
Ensuring early alert to the physician of any pregnancies
Educating patients and HCPs on the safe use of pomalidomide 
Pregnancy testing and contraceptive requirements
 A system to ensure that all appropriate measures have been performed prior to 
the drug being dispensed
123
EU Risk Management Plan

pomalidomide
Table 5.2-1:
Additional Risk Minimisation Measures
 Managing and monitoring the distribution of pomalidomide

Follow-up on the effectiveness of the PPP
 Compliance monitoring and assessment (examples include record of counselling 
patients prior to prescription, record of negative pregnancy test within 3 days of 
prescription and record of dispensing within 7 days of prescription date).
This  controlled  access is  designed  to  minimise  the  risk  of  exposure  to  paediatric 
patients  or  non-target  populations  and  provide  education  on  the  risk  and  the 
necessary steps to prevent foetal exposure.
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity:
To  minimise  the  risk  of  teratogenicity  and  provide  education  on  the  risk  and 
necessary steps to prevent foetal exposure to pomalidomide.
Target audience and planned distribution path:
The target audience is HCPs who will prescribe pomalidomide and patients.
Proposed Actions
The key elements of the BMS PPP are:
 Direct communication with the HCP prior to launch ('Dear HCP' letter).

Educational Programme:




Therapy management
Prescribing controls
 Dispensing controls
 Assessment
The Patient Card and/or an equivalent tool is used to manage the controlled access 
within the national territory as agreed with the NCA.

Plans  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  interventions  and  criteria  for 
success:
 Compliance with the PPP will be monitored in each member state in agreement 
with the relevant NCA (eg, record of counselling patients prior to prescription, 
record of a negative pregnancy test within 3 days of prescription and a record of 
dispensing within 7 days of the prescription date, etc).

Study  CC-4047-MM-015:  Noninterventional  postauthorisation  registry  of 
patients treated with pomalidomide for RRMM to monitor incidence of ADRs 
in “real world” situation and to monitor the implementation and compliance of 
BMS PPP and controlled access system on a country basis in agreement with 
the relevant NCA (ie, monitoring of Patient Card completion).

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for IMNOVID (POMALIDOMIDE)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Imnovid. The RMP details important 
risks of Imnovid, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Imnovid 's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Imnovid  's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Imnovid should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP for  Imnovid should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Imnovid's 
RMP.
I.  The medicine and what it is used for
Imnovid in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least two prior treatment 
regimens,  including  both  lenalidomide  and  bortezomib,  and  have  demonstrated  disease 
progression on the last therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). Imnovid contains pomalidomide
as the active substance and it is given by oral route of administration. 
Imnovid in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with MM who have received at least one prior treatment regimen including lenalidomide.
Further information about the evaluation of Imnovid’s benefits can be found in Imnovid’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpagehttp://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/0026
82/human_med_001669.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124.
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important  risks  of Imnovid, together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the proposed 
studies for learning more about Imnovid's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use, in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly
132
EU Risk Management Plan
BMS-986379
Version 17.0
pomalidomide
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In  the  case  of  Imnovid, these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment, so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Imnovid are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Imnovid. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected.

Teratogenicity

Risk factors and risk groups
Pomalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, a known human teratogen 
that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide was found to 
be teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of 
major organogenesis. If pomalidomide is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic 
effect of pomalidomide in humans is expected.
Although  women  of  childbearing  potential  taking  pomalidomide  are 
particularly at risk, female partners of male patients taking pomalidomide are 
also at risk as pomalidomide may be present in semen.
The  ‘at  risk’  group  comprises  female  patients  of  childbearing  potential  or 
female partners of male patients treated with pomalidomide.
Risk minimization measures
Routine risk minimization activities: 
SmPC
 Contraindicated  in  pregnant  women  and  in  women  of  childbearing 
potential,  unless  all  the  conditions  of  the  Pregnancy  Prevention 
Programme (PPP) are met. Pomalidomide is also contraindicated in male 
patients  unable  to  follow  or  comply  with  the  required  contraceptive 
measures (Section 4.3).
 Warnings: criteria for women of non-childbearing potential, counselling, 
testing,  precautions  for  men,  additional 
contraception,  pregnancy 
precautions, prescription duration (Section 4.4).

PL

Stringent controls are required to ensure exposure of an unborn child to 
pomalidomide does  not  occur  (Section 4.4). These  include:  counselling, 
contraception,  pregnancy 
testing,  precautions  for  men,  additional 
precautions and prescription duration.
The PL warns of the potential teratogenic effects of pomalidomide and the 
need to avoid pregnancy.

Severe Infection due to Neutropenia and Pancytopenia
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
In non-clinical studies, decreased WBC counts (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and 
monocytes) were observed.
In  the  clinical  studies,  infection  was  the  most  common  non-haematological 
toxicity reported in patients who received pomalidomide, and approximately 
half  of  the  events  were  Grade  3  or  4.  The  most  commonly  reported adverse 
reactions in clinical studies have been blood and lymphatic system disorders 
including  neutropenia,  and  it  is  one  of  the  major  dose-limiting  toxicities  of 
pomalidomide.
Pancytopenia has been identified from postmarketing data. In clinical studies, 
pancytopenia  has  been  reported  as  a  common  ADR  of  pomalidomide 
treatment.
Neutropenia
By  far  the  most  common  cause  of  neutropenia  in  oncology  practice  is  the 
myelosuppressive effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation treatment. 
Because  of  their  relatively  short  life  spans,  neutrophils  are  particularly 
sensitive to the effects of recently administered chemotherapy, and nadirs of 
neutrophil  counts  are  frequently  observed  7  to  10 days  following  the 
administration  of  chemotherapy.  Less  commonly,  antibodies  to  neutrophils, 
bone marrow infiltration with disruption of normal marrow stromal function, 
and  splenic  sequestration  can  play  a  role.  Although  there  are  several 
glycoproteins with effects on neutrophil precursor cells including interleukin 
3, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, and macrophage colony 
stimulating  factor,  G  CSF  seems  to  be  the  primary  regulator  of  basal  and 
emergency neutrophil production as well as mature neutrophil function. There 
are also negative regulatory factors of neutrophil production that are less well 
understood,  including  neutrophil  elastase  and  the  src  family  kinases. 
Neutropenia can also result from decreased neutrophil survival associated with 
immune destruction, sequestration, consumption at sites of infection, and the 
effects of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor.
Pancytopenia
The  underlying  aetiology  and  presentation  for  pancytopenia  can  include 
aplastic  anaemia,  megaloblastic  anaemia,  MDS,  acute 
lymphoblastic 
leukaemia,  hypersplenism,  NHL,  MM,  acute  myeloblastic  leukaemia  and 
chronic myelocytic leukaemia.
Graft  versus  host  disease  has  also  been  described  within  the  literature  as 
contributory  to  the  onset  of  pancytopenia.  A  comprehensive  review  of 
61 articles and 87 patients with pancytopenia onset after liver transplantation 
noted the most frequent presenting symptoms prior to the diagnosis of GvHD 
included  rash  (94.2%),  fever  (66.6%),  diarrhoea  (54%),  and pancytopenia 
(54%). 
Diabetes  mellitus  type  II  may  also  contribute  to  the  onset  of  pancytopenia. 
Several  cross  sectional  studies  and  case  reports  have  documented  that  an 
135
EU Risk Management Plan
BMS-986379
Version 17.0
pomalidomide
increased frequency of vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes 
mellitus  type  II  is  commonly  related  to  inadequate  dietary  intake  or 
malabsorption.  Metformin  use  has  been  unequivocally  demonstrated  as  the 
prime  factor  associated  with  vitamin  B12  deficiency  among  patients  with 
diabetes  mellitus  type  II.  Studies  assessing  type  2  diabetic  patients  on 
metformin have  reported  the  prevalence  of  vitamin  B12  deficiency  to  range 
from 5.8% to 33%. Patients enrolled in this study were those who were on high 
dose  (> 2 g/day)  and  long-term  (4 years)  metformin  treatment,  both  clinical 
factors known to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. In the absence of 
concurrent  comorbidity  like renal and hepatic  dysfunction, recent  guidelines 
advocate  for  the  use  of  metformin  as  the  first-line  glucose  lowering  agent 
concurrently  with  life-style  modification  approaches.  Despite  its  superior 
glycaemic lowering effect, metformin has long been shown to decrease vitamin 
B12  levels  compounding  the  risk  of  megaloblastic  anaemia.  The  risk  of 
developing metformin-associated vitamin B12 deficiency is greatly influenced 
by increasing age, metformin dose and duration of use.
Severe hepatocellular disease has also demonstrated a relative relationship to 
anaemia and pancytopenia. This may include acute or chronic gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage,  and  hypersplenism  secondary  to  portal  hypertension.  Severe 
hepatocellular disease predisposes to haemorrhage because of impaired blood 
coagulation caused by deficiency of blood coagulation factors synthesised by 
hepatocytes.  Aplastic  anaemia,  which  is  characterised  by  pancytopenia  and 
hypocellular bone marrow may follow the development of hepatitis. In patients 
with chronic liver disease, anaemia may be exacerbated by deficiency of folic 
acid and/or vitamin B12.
Without  regard  to  underlying  comorbidity,  drug-induced  pancytopenia is 
acknowledged  with  many  drug  classes.  Many  patients  are  on  multiple 
concurrent therapies that may compound the risk of myelosuppressive effects 
and the induction of pancytopenia. These products, which may be used alone

Infection
Numerous  disease-related  and  chemotherapy-induced  factors  render  the 
subject  with cancer at increased risk for infection. These include the type  of 
cancer, depth and duration of neutropenia, and impairments in cellular function 
caused by cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs; breaches in the integument 
from surgical procedures, presence of indwelling plastic venous catheters, or 
mucositis  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  secondary  to  chemotherapy;  and 
comorbid  conditions  such  as  malnutrition,  deconditioning,  or  medical 
problems  such  as  chronic obstructive  lung  disease  or  diabetes.  In  addition, 
steroid therapy induces a broad immunosuppressive effect, including impaired 
chemotaxis and killing by neutrophils, impaired T-cell function, and alterations 
in  skin  and  mucosal  barriers.  Long-term  or  high-dose  steroid  therapy  is  a 
significant risk factor for invasive fungal infections in particular; such therapy 
also may  predispose  affected  subjects  to  development  of  bacterial  infections 
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis reactivation.
One US study that utilised the SEER-Medicare database reported that elderly 
cancer patients run a 1.2 to 2.4 times higher risk of developing VZV than those 
without  cancer.  Additional  noted  risk  factors  for  developing  VZV  included 
age, gender, race, immunosuppressive conditions, and certain cancer therapies 
(eg,  haematologic  cancer  patients:  autologous  and  allogeneic  stem  cell

transplants; solid cancer patients: radiotherapy). Haematologic or solid cancer 
patients with immunocompromising conditions ran a higher risk of developing 
VZV, as did haematologic cancer patients who received stem cell transplants 
(despite the routine use of prophylaxis post-transplant). Cancer patients aged 
75 to 85 years old had a higher risk of developing VZV than patients 85 years 
and  older  which  may  be  attributed  to  the  different  treatment  approaches 
(ie, more aggressive chemotherapies used in younger patients, inducing greater 
immune suppression) and may lead to different VZV risks. For patients with 
haematologic  malignancies,  the  risk  of  developing  shingles  increases  from 
13% to 55% the year after a SCT. 
factors 
for  HBV 
reactivation 
Risk 
include  baseline  HBV  DNA 
> 105 copies/mL,  baseline  ALT  levels,  hepatitis B  e  antigen  seropositivity, 
corticosteroid therapy, anthracyclines, rituximab, male sex, younger age, and 
underlying disease of lymphoma or breast cancer. The most common causes of 
HBV reactivation are the immunosuppression regimens adopted in solid organ 
for  onco-haematological  diseases  and 
transplantation,  chemotherapy 
immunosuppressive drugs used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The 
immunosuppressive  properties  related  to  chemotherapy  can  cause  flares  of 
HBV  in  people  who  carry  HBsAg  in  their  serum.  Flares  can  occur  despite 
normal baseline serum ALT levels and can lead to HBV-related morbidity and 
mortality. The rate of HBV reactivation after allogeneic BMT ranges 14% to 
50%, with a lesser rate in autologous BMT; risk factors include corticosteroid 
use, donor HBsAg antibody sero-negativity, and GvHD. The time-to-recovery 
of  cellular  immunity  after  peripheral  blood  stem  cell  transplantation  is  3 to 
5 months, which is the time course during which HBV reactivation has been 
documented.

pomalidomide
Decreased platelets in the blood and bleeding occur due to MM so may occur 
during treatment with pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone. In 
addition, pomalidomide may cause reductions in platelet numbers which make 
patients more prone to bleeding.
The rate of blood cell production is both tightly regulated and highly variable. 
Under  conditions  of  either  increased  destruction  of  cells,  such  as  bleeding, 
haemolysis, or immune destruction of platelets, production rates of appropriate 
cells increase several fold. The regulation of this dynamic system is complex 
but  for  practical  purposes  can  be  conceived  of  as  involving  an  interaction 
between  a  pool  of  pluripotent  haematopoietic  stem  cells,  capable  of  both 
infinite self-renewal and differentiation into mature blood cells and regulatory 
factors, including both a well-characterised set of glycoprotein haematopoietic 
growth factors and a less well-understood group of inhibitory factors. 
their  precursors.  Thrombopoietin 
The  primary  regulator  of  the  platelet  count  in  humans  is  thrombopoietin,  a 
glycoprotein that  is  produced primarily  in  the liver  and  cleared  primarily  by 
platelets  and 
induces  growth  and 
development  of  megakaryocytes;  levels  fluctuate  with  changes  in  platelet 
count due to variations in clearance. Thrombocytopenia that is encountered in 
oncology practice may be due to the effects of chemotherapy, or after multiple 
cycles  of  treatment,  liver  disease  with  decreased  thrombopoietin  levels, 
immune  destruction,  particularly  in  subjects  with  lymphoid  malignancies  or 
infection with HIV, and sequestration. 
The  incidence  of  gastrointestinal haemorrhage  increases  with  advanced  age. 
Individuals aged  60 years  and  older account  for 35%  to  45%  of  all  cases  of 
UGIB. A review of epidemiology studies of the complications of peptic ulcer 
disease reported annual incidence rates of haemorrhage ranging from 0.19 to 
0.57 per  1000 persons  in  the  general  population  and  an  annual  incidence  of 
0.79 per  1000 persons  older  than  60  years  of  age.  A  prospective  study  of 
patients  undergoing  upper  gastrointestinal  endoscopy  at  the  National 
University Hospital of Iceland reported annual incidence rates of acute UGIB 
by age group as follows: 0.30 per 1000 individuals aged 18 to 24 years, 0.15 
per 1000 individuals aged 25 to 39 years, 0.48 per 1000 individuals aged 40 to 
59  years,  2.13 per  1000  individuals aged  60  to  79 years, and 5.70  per  1000 
individuals aged 80 and older.
Relatively common medications in the elderly that may predispose individuals 
to gastrointestinal haemorrhage include aspirin and NSAIDs. A meta-analysis 
of  24 randomised  controlled  trials  (almost  66,000  participants)  revealed 
gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  in  2.47%  of  patients  taking  aspirin  compared 
with  1.42%  taking  placebo.  A  medical  record  review  conducted  in  Japan 
reported incidence rates for UGIB of 2.65 and 1.29 per 1000 users of low-dose 
aspirin and NSAIDs, respectively. A study using the UK GPRD reported a RR 
of 4.1 (95% CI: 3.5-4.7) of UGIB associated with current NSAID use. Given 
previously published incidence rates of hospitalisation for peptic ulcer disease 
among  nonusers  of  NSAIDs  of  1  per  1000  person-years,  Hernández-Díaz 
reported  that  this  risk  translates  to  more  than  3  additional  cases  per  1000 
exposed  persons  per  year.  Also  in  the  UK  GPRD  study,  the  risk  of  serious 
UGIB or perforation among current users of systemic steroids (85% of which 
was prednisolone) was RR = 1.8. The risk was greater (RR = 2.9) among users 
with  steroid  doses  ≥ 30 mg  prednisone,  but  the  test  for  dose-response  was 
non-significant.  Steroids  were  similarly  associated  with  bleeding  (OR = 1.8; 
95% CI: 1.3-2.4) and perforations (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 0.9-3.1). Simultaneous

Patients treated with pomalidomide may be at an increased risk of developing 
new  cancers  (including  skin  cancers).  In  clinical  studies,  NMSC  has  been 
reported in patients receiving pomalidomide. Drug reaction with eosinophilia 
and  systemic  symptoms,  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis  and  Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome have been observed in the postmarketing setting.
Skin  colour  and  being  exposed  to  sunlight  are  recognised  risk  factors  for 
NMSC.  NMSC  is  the  most  frequent  malignancy  mainly  in  fair-skinned 
populations.  However  other  risk  factors  such  as  immune  disorders,  tobacco 
use, photosensitive drugs, and viral infections (human papilloma virus, HIV) 
have been reported to be associated with NMSC in rare instances. 
Rates  of  NMSC  are higher in  men as  compared to  women.  NMSC rates are 
also higher in older age groups. One study based on the US insured population 
reported the mean age of NMSC was 69 years.

Section 4.4  contains  a  warning  that  secondary  primary  malignancies 
(SPM), such as non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), have been reported 
in patients receiving pomalidomide; physicians should carefully evaluate 
patients before and during treatment using standard cancer screening for
occurrence of SPM and institute treatment as indicated.

Risk factors and risk groups
Patients treated with pomalidomide may be at an increased risk of developing 
new cancers. In clinical studies, SPM has been reported in patients receiving 
pomalidomide.
Travis has grouped second primary cancers into three major groups based on 
the predominant etiologic factors ie, treatment related, syndromic, and those 
due to shared etiologic factors, while emphasising the non-exclusivity of these

groups. In the following, possible explanations for the epidemiologic findings 
presented in the previous section will be discussed.

Due to improvements in the care of patients with cancer, the number of cancer 
survivors has been increasing in recent years. Increased longevity increases the 
risk of developing a second malignancy, whether due to the late sequelae of 
treatment, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, or host factors (eg, aging, 
genetic  factors,  gene-environment  interactions),  or  a  combination  of  these 
factors. Second solid tumours are a leading cause of mortality among several 
populations of long-term survivors.
As reported from the SEER Cancer Statistics Review 1975 to 2009, the 5-year 
relative survival among MM patients has increased from 25.1% among patients 
first  diagnosed  in  1975  to  1977  to  42.6%  among  patients  first  diagnosed 
between 2002 and 2008 (p < 0.05). Among patients aged less than 65 years at 
first  diagnosis  between  2002  and  2008,  5-year  relative  survival  is  54.4%; 
among those aged 65 years and older, survivorship is 31.3%.
 Heredity
Additional  insight  has  also  been  obtained  in  elucidating  the  risk  of 
malignancies  in  close  family  members  of  patients  affected  by  MM.  The 
available  data  show  an  increased  risk  of  more  than  one  malignancy  in  MM 
patients  and  first-degree  relatives  compared  to  the  general  population.  The 
reason for this finding is still unclear but may clearly involve risk conferred by 
shared genetic factors.

Invasive SPM will be considered important medical events.
Patients treated with pomalidomide in combination with dexamethasone may 
be at increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. It is unclear whether pomalidomide 
can  cause  cardiac  arrhythmias.  In  clinical  studies,  a  greater  proportion  of 
patients  treated  with  pomalidomide  in  combination  with  dexamethasone

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for trabectedin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During this PSUR reporting period safety data on cardiac toxicity has become available. Cardiac toxicity 
is a potential short or long-term complication that might be associated with the use of anticancer 
therapy both conventional chemotherapy but also novel therapies. Following completion of the 
comparative trial ET743SAR3007, cardiac dysfunction was observed in 20 (5.3%) of 378 patients 
receiving trabectedin as compared with 4 (2.3%) of 172 patients treated with dacarbazine. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information of medicinal products containing trabectadin were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for trabectedin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing trabectedin is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

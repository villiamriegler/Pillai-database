1.  Introduction 
On 21 October 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for deferasirox (EXJADE), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
CHMP’s comment 
This study has been identified for Art 46 submission as part of a remediation exercise conducted by the 
MAH, reviewing all interventional and non-interventional studies with paediatric patients in scope of Art 
46 requirements. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study CICL670A2201 : a randomised, open label, multi-center, phase II study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral deferasirox 20 mg/kg/day relative to SC deferoxamine in sickle 
cell disease patients with iron overload from repeated blood transfusions is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Exjade is brand name for deferasirox presented as dispersible tablets in 3 doses strengths: 125, 250 
and 500mg. The investigational drug was available as tablets at dosage strengths of 125 mg, 250 mg 
and 500 mg, packaged in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with an induction seal and child 
resistant closure. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Deferasirox (company research code: ICL670, DFX) is an orally active chelator that is highly selective 
for iron (III). It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Deferasirox 
promotes excretion of excess iron, primarily in the feces. Deferasirox was developed by Novartis for 
the treatment of chronic iron overlo ad due to frequent blood transfusions (≥ 7 mL/kg/month of packed 
red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassemia major aged 6 years and older. It is also indicated for 
the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is 
contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
 in  p e d ia t r ic  p a t ie n t s  w it h  b e t a  t h a la s s e m ia  m a jo r  w it h  ir o n  o v e r lo a d  d u e  t o  fr e q u e n t  b lo o d  
transfusions (≥ 7 mL/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
 in  a d u lt  a n d  p e d ia t r ic  patients with beta thalassemia major with iron overload due to infrequent 
blood transfusions (<7 mL/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older, 
 in  a d u lt  a n d  p e d ia t r ic  p a t ie n t s  w it h  o t h e r  a n e m ia s  a g e d  2  y e a r s  a n d  o ld e r .  
Further it is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non - transfusion-dependent 
thalassemia syndromes aged 10 years and older.

Deferasirox was first registered on 02-Nov-2005 in the United States and subsequently in the EU via 
centralized procedure on 28-Aug-2006. Deferasirox is currently approved in over 100 countries. 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for: 
CICL670A2201 : a randomised, open label, multi-center, phase II study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of oral deferasirox 20 mg/kg/day relative to SC deferoxamine in sickle cell disease patients 
with iron overload from repeated blood transfusions. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study  
CICL670A2201: a randomised, open label, multi-center, phase II study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of oral deferasirox 20 mg/kg/day relative to SC deferoxamine in sickle 
cell disease patients with iron overload from repeated blood transfusions.  
Description 
This study was conducted in 33 centers in 2 countries (Canada and US). First patient enrolled on 12 
May 2005 and the last patient completed on 08 Apr 2008. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of ICL670 compared to deferoxamine, 
during 24 weeks, in patients with sickle cell disease and iron overload from repeated blood 
transfusions. 
The secondary objectives were as follows: 
• To assess the long-term safety of ICL670, for up to 104 weeks (2 years), in patients with sickle cell 
disease and iron overload from repeated blood transfusions. 
• To assess the safety of ICL670 in a subgroup of the patients receiving concomitant hydroxyurea. 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ICL670 versus DFO, after 24 weeks, in patients with sickle cell disease 
and iron overload from repeated blood transfusions. 
• To evaluate the efficacy of ICL670, for up to 104 weeks (2 years), in patients with sickle cell disease 
and iron overload from repeated blood transfusions. 
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of ICL670 in patients with sickle cell disease, including 
patients receiving concomitant hydroxyurea. 
• To explore the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of the efficacy of therapy 
with iron chelators in a sub-set of patients. 
CHMP’s comment 
As a general comment, the investigation of paediatric use was not a primary objective of this study 
and no specific analysis in paediatric population was performed in the clinical study report.

Study design 
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio for a treatment period of 24 weeks to receive either oral DFX 
at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day once daily or subcutaneous DFO at a total weekly dose of 175 mg/kg for 5 
to 7 days. The randomization was stratified by age (≥ 2 to < 12, ≥ 12 to < 16, and ≥ 16 years) and by 
concomitant administration of hydroxyurea. After the initial 24-week treatment period, all DFO treated 
patients discontinued DFO and crossed over to receive once daily administration of oral DFX up to 
Week-52, which was then followed by an extension period during which all patients received DFX until 
Week-104. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 268 patients were screened, and 212 patients were randomized. Nine patients were excluded 
from the full analyses (due to exclusion of Center 512), and 12 patients did not receive any treatment. 
Hence, 191 patients received at least one dose of study medication (135 in DFX and 56 in DFO), and 
included in the safety analyses. Of the 203 patients, 140 (69.0%) were in the pediatric age range 
(defined as between 2 to < 18 years for this study). 
Repartition of paediatric patients 
In safety set 1, 10 patients are between 2-6 years-old (6 in DFX arm and 4 in DFO arm), 63 patients 
between 6-12 years old (42 in DFX arm and 21 in DFO arm) and 53 between 12 and 16 years-old (35 
in DFX arm and 18 in DFO arm). 
In safety set 2, 10 patients are between 2-6 years-old (6 in DFX arm and 4 in cross over arm), 57 
patients between 6-12 years old (42 in DFX arm and 15 in cross over arm) and 49 between 12 and 16 
years-old (35 in DFX arm and 14 in cross over arm). 
CHMP’s comment 
A majority of patients enrolled in this study are paediatric patients (around 70%). In this study, 
paediatric population between 2 and 6 years-old is included but the number of children is relatively low 
(10/140; 7%). No child under 2 years-old was enrolled. 
The long term safety in paediatric population (especially in youngest patients: 2-6 years-old) is listed 
as missing information in the current RMP (V13).

Treatments 
Safety set 1 
A total of 129 (95.6%) patients were planned to receive 15 - <25 mg/kg/day ICL670; all 129 patients 
received the planned dose. Although 35 (62.5%) patients were planned to receive 30- <50 mg/kg/day 
DFO, 50 (89.3%) patients actually received this dosage. No patient received a dosage of ≥ 25 
mg/kg/day ICL670 or ≥ 50 mg/kg/day DFO during the first 24 weeks. 
The duration of exposure of patients is respectively 5.9 months and 6.2 months for DFX and DFO arm. 
Safety set 2:  
A total of 154/188 (81.9%) patients in both arms were planned to receive 15 - <25 mg/kg/day 
ICL670; 150 (79.8%) patients received the planned 15 - <25 mg/kg/day dose. No patient received a 
dosage of ≥ 35 mg/kg/day ICL670 after start of treatment with ICL670. 
The duration of exposure of patients is respectively 21.6 months and 19.6 months for DFX and cross 
over arm. 
CHMP’s comment 
We regret that the average daily dose (planned/actual) and duration of exposure were not recorded by 
age group.  
As all patients received planned dose between 15-25 mg/kg/day of DFX (mean : 19.8 in SA1 and 21.2 
in SA2) and as 70% of patients are paediatrics, it can be estimated that a majority of paediatric 
patients received roughly the approved dose of 20mg/kg/day of DFX. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Serum ferritin, total iron, and transferrin will be measured at screening and at every study visit on the 
chemistry blood samples sent to the central laboratory. These values will be monitored as efficacy 
parameters. In addition, the change in serum ferritin values obtained during the study will serve as a 
secondary endpoint for efficacy analysis. 
Safety assessment was based on descriptions of AEs and SAEs occurring in this study as well as clinical 
laboratory data for hematology, blood chemistry, SF, total iron, transferrin, urinary protein, urinary 
creatinine, viral serology (hepatitis B and C) and pregnancy testing. Height and weight of patients were 
also evaluated for safety. 
Other safety evaluations included ECG, ECG/holter monitoring, ocular examination and audiometry. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary variables were adverse events (AEs) and laboratory parameters : AE data were 
summarized descriptively by treatment group using number and frequencies for categorical variables, 
while summary statistics of laboratory data (means, median, standard deviation, ranges) as well as 
shift tables and listings for patients with notable laboratory values were provided.

The primary efficacy variable was the absolute change in serum ferritin. Summary statistics and 
graphical displays of serum ferritin measurements as well as absolute and relative changes from 
baseline were provided by treatment group. Absolute and relative change from baseline was 
summarized by age category, splenectomy and hydroxyurea category, and by treatment group. For the 
first 24 weeks, a two-sided 95% confidence interval of the mean difference in the absolute change 
between ICL670 and DFO arms was calculated with adjustment of stratification factors (age and 
hydroxyurea) and the amount of transfused blood during the study. For week 52 and week 104, 
twosided 95% confidence intervals of the average change were calculated for the ICL670 arm as well 
as for all the patients also with adjustment of age, hydroxyurea and amount of transfusion. An 
exploratory mixed model (time and treatment as fixed factors and patient as a random factor) analysis 
was done using all available serum ferritin values to compare the change over time of serum ferritin 
between the two treatment arms in the first 24 weeks, as well as to assess the change over time of 
serum ferritin from start of ICL670 to end of study. 
The pre-dose and 2-hour post-dose levels of deferasirox and Fe-[ICL670]2 obtained in this study were 
summarized descriptively by hydroxyurea therapy group. Descriptive statistics included mean, SD, CV, 
geometric mean, CV geometric mean, min, max and median. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
For the 24 week period (FA-1 Set), the majority (96.1%) of patients were Black. More than half 
(56.2%) were female. Of the 203 patients, 140 were pediatric patients (<18 years); 92/135 (68.1%) 
pediatric patients in DFX and 48/68 (70.6%) pediatric patients in DFO group. More than 80% (116 
patients, 82.9%) of the 140 pediatric patients were between 6 and <16 years of age; 77/92 (83.7%) 
in the pediatric DFX group and 39/48 (81.2%) in the pediatric DFO group  
At start of treatment with DFX (FA-2 set), the majority of patients (96%) were Black and more than 
half (56.4%) were female. Of the 188 patients, 130 (69.1%) were pediatric patients; 92/135 (68.1%) 
pediatric patients in DFX and 38/53 (71.6%) were in cross-over group. More than 80% (106 patients, 
81%) of the 130 pediatric patients were between 6 and <16 years of age; 77/92 (83.7%) in the 
pediatric DFX group and 29/38 (76.3%) in the pediatric DFO group. 
CHMP’s comment 
A majority of patients enrolled in this study are paediatric patients (around 70%). In this study, 
paediatric population between 2 and 6 years-old is included but the number of children is relatively low 
(10/140; 7%). No child under 2 years-old was enrolled. 
Efficacy results 
According to the MAH, there was a similar reduction in serum ferritin observed in the DFX and DFO 
treatment groups during the first 24-week period and in the cross-over group after the start of DFX 
treatment, although there was a numerically greater reduction observed in the DFO group in the first 
24 weeks; the differences observed between DFX vs. DFO and the cross-over group was less 
pronounced as the study progressed (could be due to start of DFX treatment in crossover group). The 
mean (± SE) change in serum ferritin from baseline (adjusted for amount of transfused blood) was -

146.7 (± 266.75) mg/mL at Week 24, -487.3 (± 138.83) mg/mL at Week 52 and -682.6 (±205.06) 
mg/mL at Week 104 for the DFX group 
Efficacy in paediatric population: 
At first 24-weeks, an overall decreasing trend for all age categories similar to overall population, 
although the variability was high and the number of patients was small for some of the age categories 
(Table 4-1).  
In the DFX treatment arm, the decrease was more pronounced in 16 to ≤ 18 years age group (but 
number of patients in this treatment group is low) while it was more evident in 6 to ≤ 12 years age 
group for DFO treatment arm. It is important to note that in the 6 to ≤ 12 years age group there 
appears to be a mean increase in serum ferritin over the first 24 weeks of treatment with DFX. 
However, this was possibly due to the effect a single high ferritin value in one patient. 
For pediatric patients, in months 3 to 6, the mean absolute changes in serum ferritin were - 171.4 
(±506.92), 33.1 (±1885.21), and -271.2 (±1039.28) mg/mL for ICL670 patients aged 2- <6, 6-<12, 
and 12-<16 years, respectively; for DFO patients, the mean changes were -131.5 (±467.22), -1153.1 
(± 2971.39), and -578.5 (±660.23) mg/mL respectively 
After start of treatment with DFX, an overall decreasing trend continued for all age categories except 
for 16 to <18 years where increase was observed, this could be due to high variability, less number of 
patients (2 to 6 and 16 to <18), and possible outliers. Hence, no definitive conclusions can be made. 
In the DFX arm, the decrease was more pronounced in 2 to <6 years while it was more evident in 12

to <16 years for cross-over group at week 52 (Table 4-2). There were no meaningful differences in the 
change in serum ferritin at 104-week after the start of DFX treatment patients. 
For all pediatric patients after the start of ICL670 treatment, in months 21 to 24, the mean absolute 
changes in serum ferritin were -1025.2 (±887.77), -277.7 (±1833.16), and -651.2 (±1388.79) mg/mL 
for patients aged 2-<6, 6-<12, and 12-<16 years, respectively. An overall decreasing trend was 
observed for all age categories, although the variability was high and the number of patients was small 
for some of the age categories.  
According to the MAH, age has no clinically relevant influence on the absolute change of SF seen with 
ICL treatment. 
CHMP’s comment 
No specific analysis of paediatric efficacy was specified as a protocol objective.  
At first 24-weeks, an overall decreasing trend for all age categories similar to overall population. 
However the variability was high and the number of patients was too small for some of the age 
categories (Ages 2-<6; age 16-<18) to draw any conclusion. In the 6 to ≤ 12 years age group there 
appears to be a mean increase in serum ferritin over the first 24 weeks of treatment with DFX. 
According to the MAH, this was possibly due to the effect of one patient’s single high ferritin value. 
After start of treatment with DFX, an overall decreasing trend continued for all age categories except 
for 16 to <18 years where increase was observed.  In the same way, no definitive conclusions can be 
made due to the small size of sample.

Safety results 
According to the MAH, in overall population, DFX appeared to be well tolerated when comparing the 
adverse event (AE) profiles of DFX and DFO. The AEs reported in study with DFX were similar to those 
observed in other studies with DFX. Fewer AEs were observed in the DFX-treated patients than in the 
DFO-treated patients during the first 24 weeks of treatment. The observed AEs are in line with those 
expected from this treatment in this condition/population. 
Safety in pediatric patients 
According to the MAH, in the pediatric population, DFX was also well tolerated when comparing the AE 
profile across DFX, DFO and cross-over treatment groups. AEs reported in all age categories were 
consistent with the safety profile observed in other studies with DFX as well as with established safety 
profile of DFX. 
There were very few pediatric patients in the age group 2 to <6 years, hence the safety evaluation is 
focused on 6 to <12, 12 to <16, and 16 to <18 years age group. Due to small sample size in 16 to 
<18 years group the results should be interpreted with caution. For reporting purpose, all percentages 
are calculated based on total number of patients in each treatment group. 
1-  Safety during the 1st 24-weeks of treatment (safety-1 set) 
Adverse events by system organ class and preferred terms 
Overall, incidence of AEs was low in pediatric patients compared to adults. 
The incidence of AEs were less frequent in the DFX-treated patients than in the DFO-treated patients 
during the first 24 weeks of treatment across all age groups; 6 to <12 (20.7% vs. 26.8%), 12 to <16 
(20% vs. 21.4%), 16 to <18 (5.9% vs. 8.9%). 
In the Safety-1 set (first 24-weeks), the most commonly affected SOCs across all age groups were: 
gastrointestinal disorders, infections and infestations, nervous system disorders, general disorders and 
administration site conditions.

In the 6 to 12, and 12 to 16 years age groups, only one SAE (liver function abnormality) was reported 
(one in each age group) to be study drug related in the DFX group. No study drug related SAE was 
reported in both age groups in the DFO arm. 
Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation 
Study-drug related AEs leading to discontinuations were uncommon in pediatric population with only 
one patient in 6 to <12 age group (2 AEs reported for 1 patient) leading to study discontinuation due 
to increased ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). No patients in the other pediatric age groups 
(2 to <6, 12 to <16, 16 to <18) experienced suspected AEs leading to study drug discontinuation.  
Adverse events leading to dose adjustment or interruptions 
AEs leading to dose adjustment or study drug interruptions were infrequent in pediatric population. In 
the DFX treatment group, 7 (5.2%) patients in 6 to <12 age group and 3 (2.2%) patients in 12 to <16 
age group had AEs which required dose adjustment or interruptions. The most frequent reason for 
study drug adjustments in the 6 to <12 age groups were abnormal liver function (including ALT/AST 
increased). No patients experienced AEs leading to dose adjustment or study drug interruptions in 16 
to <18 years age group in the DFX arm. 
Hematology and clinical chemistry 
No clinically significant difference in the frequency of absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, 
ALT/AST increased, abnormal serum creatinine or urinary protein/creatinine ratios values was observed 
between DFX, and DFO treatment groups across all pediatric age categories. Increase of AST during 
study > upper limit of normal (ULN) when baseline is <ULN seems to occur more often compared to 
ALT, however this effect is seen across all age groups and across treatments. 
CHMP’s comment 
No new safety concern emerges from the safety data observed within the 1st 24 weeks of DFX therapy.

2-  Safety after start of treatment with DFX (Safety-2 set) 
Adverse events by system organ class and preferred terms 
In the Safety-2 set (patients who received at least one dose of DFX), infections and infestations and 
gastro-intestinal disorders were the most commonly affected SOCs in the pediatric population across 
all age groups. The incidence of AEs were similar in DFX-treated patients (started with DFX right from 
the beginning of the study) compared to the cross-over group in 6 to <12 group (27.4% vs. 28.3%), 
16 to <18 (6.7% vs.7.5%) and was slightly higher in 12 to <16 group (25.9% vs. 22.6%).

Suspected adverse events 
In 6 to <12 years age group (after start of DFX), 12 patients (8.9%) in the DFX group and 3 patients 
(5.7%) in the cross-over group had reported suspected AEs. The most frequently reported suspected 
AEs by PT occurring >2% DFX-treated patients were ALT (3.0%), AST (2.2%) increased, abnormal

Serious adverse events and Deaths 
Overall, very few patients experienced SAEs in both treatment groups after start of treatment with DFX 
across all age categories. No deaths were reported in pediatric patients. 
 I n  6  t o  < 1 2  y e a r s  age group (after start of DFX), 18 (13.3%) patients in DFX, and 5 (9.4%) patients 
in cross-over group have reported SAEs. Pyrexia was the most common SAE reported in 6 (4.4%) 
DFX-treated patients, and in 4 (7.5%) cross-over patients. 
 I n  1 2  t o  < 1 6  y e a r s  age group, SAEs were reported in 18 (13.3%) DFX -treated patients and 4 
(7.5%) patients in cross-over group. The most common SAEs occurring in >2% of DFX treated 
patients were sickle cell anaemia with crisis (5.2%), pyrexia (4.4%), abdominal pain (2.2%), and 
sickle cell anaemia with crisis (3.8%) occurring in >2% of cross-over patients. 
 I n  1 6  t o  < 1 8  y e a r s  a g e  g r o u p ,  S AEs  w e r e  r e p o r t e d  in  7  ( 5 . 2 % )  DFX-treated patients and 3 (5.7%)

>2% of DFX-treated patients. In the cross-over group, no AE reached the 3% threshold. 
Two (1.5%) patients each in 6 to <12 (liver function abnormalities) and 12 to <16 age group (liver 
function abnormalities, increased serum ferritin and rash) experienced an SAE that was suspected to 
be study drug related by the Investigator. No patients in cross-over group reported suspected SAEs.

Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation 
After start of treatment with DFX, one patient in 6 to 12 (DFX group) and 2 patients in the 12 to 16 
age group (one in DFX and one in cross-over group) had suspected AEs leading to discontinuation from 
the study. The most commonly reported suspected AEs leading to discontinuations were liver function 
abnormalities including AST or ALT increased. Other reasons were cataract and increased serum 
ferritin. No patients experienced suspected AEs leading to study drug discontinuation in 16 to <18 
years age group. 
Adverse events leading to dose adjustment or interruptions 
After start of treatment with DFX, 12 (8.9%), 6 (4.4%), and 2 (1.5%) patients had AEs leading to dose 
adjustment or study drug interruption in 6 to ≤ 12, 12 to ≤ 16, and 16 to ≤ 18 years age group, 
respectively for patients in the DFX group. For cross-over patients, this was the case for one patient in 
the 6 to ≤ 12, no patient in the 12 to ≤ 16 and two patients in the 16 to ≤ 18 years age group. Majority 
of AEs were related to liver function abnormalities. 
Hematology and clinical chemistry 
No clinically significant difference in the frequency of absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, 
ALT/AST increased, abnormal serum creatinine or urinary protein/creatinine ratios values was observed 
between DFX, and cross-over treatment groups across all age categories.  
CHMP’s comment 
No new safety concern emerges from the safety data observed after the start of DFX therapy. 
The long term safety in paediatric population (especially in youngest patients : 2-6 years-old) is listed 
as missing information in the current RMP (V13). In this study, paediatric population between 2 and <6 
years-old is included but the number of children is relatively low (10/140; 7%). A total of 2 serious 
cases were reported (one TIA not related and one streptococcal/parvovirus infection, both considered 
not suspected). No conclusion can be drawn from these data. Of note, no child under 2 years-old was 
enrolled. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In the Study A2201, overall there were no unexpected safety findings in the pediatric population 
following treatment with deferasirox. Data from the pediatric patients indicate an efficacy and safety 
profile that is aligned with adult population and similar to the known clinical profile of deferasirox. 
No specific analysis of pediatric efficacy was specified as a protocol objective.  
An overall decreasing trend for all age categories similar to overall population. However the variability 
was high and the number of patients was too small in each age categories to make definitive 
conclusion.  
There are no new safety concerns observed. Overall incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AE leading to 
discontinuation was lower in pediatric patients compared to the adult patients. Both deaths that 
occurred in this study were in adult patients. This study did not bring any new information on the long 
term use in the youngest patients (2 - <6 years-old) due to the low number of patients of this age 
range enrolled.

In conclusion, the benefit-risk assessment for deferasirox remains unchanged for the currently 
approved indications. No changes to the pediatric information of the current deferasirox EU SPC are 
proposed. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
This study has been identified for Art 46 submission as part of a remediation exercise conducted by the 
MAH, reviewing all interventional and non-interventional studies with paediatric patients in scope of Art 
46 requirements. 
The investigation of paediatric use was not a primary objective of this study and no specific analysis for 
efficacy and safety in paediatric population was performed in the clinical study report. 
An overall decreasing trend for all age categories similar to overall population. However the variability 
was high and the number of patients was too small in each age categories to make definitive 
conclusion.  
There were no unexpected safety findings in the pediatric population following treatment with 
deferasirox. This study did not bring any new information on the long term use in the youngest 
patients (2 - <6 years-old) due to the low number of patients of this age range enrolled. 
In conclusion, the benefit-risk assessment for deferasirox remains unchanged for the currently 
approved indications. No changes to the pediatric information of the current deferasirox EU SPC are 
proposed. 
4.  MS comments 
During the procedure we have received MS 1 and MS 2 comments. We have not received any 
comments from other MS:  
-  MS 1 agrees with the rapporteur’s conclusions and have no further comments. 
-  MS 2 comments :  
In general we can agree with the conclusions as stated by the Rapporteur for the above 
mentioned procedure. However, we would kindly ask you whether you have considered to 
provide an integrated report and discussion of the 3 current paediatric worksharing procedures, 
as it may facilitate decision-making regarding any amendments that might be needed in the 
SmPC for paediatric patients. 
CHMP’s comment 
After discussion with EMA, it was necessary to have 3 different assessment reports as the applicant 
submitted P46 071, P46 072 and P46 073 as three separate eCTD sequences (0144, 0145 and 0146 
respectively) on 17/10 for P46071 and P46 072 and on 20/10/2017 for P46 073. 
However, it could be highlighted that, in all 3 procedures, we are not recommending any PI changes.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

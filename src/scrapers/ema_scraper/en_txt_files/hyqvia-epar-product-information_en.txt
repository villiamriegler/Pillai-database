CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Replacement therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0 to 18 years) in: 
• 
• 
Primary immunodeficiency syndromes (PID) with impaired antibody production 
(see section 4.4). 
Secondary immunodeficiencies (SID) in patients who suffer from severe or recurrent infections, 
ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure (PSAF)* or serum 
IgG level of < 4 g/L. 
*PSAF = failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide 
and polypeptide antigen vaccines. 
Immunomodulatory therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0 to 18 years) in: 
• 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) as maintenance therapy after 
stabilization with IVIg. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of immunodeficiency/CIDP. 
The medicinal product should be administered via the subcutaneous (SC) route. The dose and 
dose regimens are dependent on the indication. 
The dose may need to be individualized for each patient dependent on the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and clinical response. Dose based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or 
overweight patients. The following dose regimens are given as a guideline. 
Posology 
Replacement therapy in PID 
Patients naïve to immunoglobulin therapy 
The dose required to achieve a trough level of 6 g/L is of the order of 0.4 to 0.8 g/kg body weight 
per month. The dose interval to maintain steady-state levels varies from 2-to-4 weeks. 
IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. 
To reduce the rate of infection, it may be necessary to increase the dose and aim for higher 
IgG trough levels (> 6 g/L). 
At the initiation of therapy, it is recommended that the treatment intervals for the first infusions be 
gradually prolonged from a 1-week dose to up to a 3- or 4-week dose. The cumulative monthly dose of 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IG 10% should be divided into 1-week, 2-week etc. doses according to the planned treatment intervals 
with HyQvia. 
Patients previously treated with Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 
For patients switching directly from IVIg, or who have a previous IVIg dose that can be referenced, 
the medicinal product should be administered at the same dose and at the same frequency as their 
previous IVIg treatment. If patients were previously on a 3-week dosing regimen, increasing 
the interval to 4-weeks can be accomplished by administering the same weekly equivalents. 
Patients previously treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg)  
The initial dose of the medicinal product is the same as for SCIg treatment but may be adjusted 
to 3- or 4-weeks interval. The first infusion should be given one week after the last treatment with the 
previous immunoglobulin. 
Replacement therapy in SID 
The recommended dose is 0.2 to 0.4 g/kg every 3 -to -4 weeks. 
IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. 
Dose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, an increase may 
be necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be considered when the patient 
remains infection free. 
Immunomodulatory therapy in CIDP 
Before initiating therapy, the weekly equivalent dose should be calculated by dividing the planned 
dose by the planned dose interval in weeks. The typical dosing interval range for HyQvia is 3 -
to 4 - weeks. The recommended subcutaneous dose is 0.3 to 2.4 g/kg body weight per month, 
administered in 1-or 2-sessions over 1-or 2-days. 
The patient’s clinical response should be the primary consideration in dose adjustment. The dose may 
need to be adapted to achieve the desired clinical response. In clinical deterioration, the dose may be 
increased to the recommended maximum of 2.4 g/kg monthly. If the patient is clinically stable, 
periodic dose reductions may be needed to observe whether the patient still needs IG therapy. 
A titration schedule that permits gradual dose increase over time (ramp-up) is recommended to ensure 
the patient’s tolerability until the full dose is reached. During the titration schedule, the calculated 
HyQvia dose and recommended dose intervals must be followed for the first and second infusions. 
Depending on the treating physician's discretion, in patients who tolerate the first 2 infusions well, 
subsequent infusions may be administered by gradually increasing doses and dose intervals, 
considering the volume and total infusion time. An accelerated titration schedule may be considered if 
the patient tolerates the SC infusion volumes and the first 2 infusions. Doses less than or equal to 
0.4 g/kg may be administered without a titration schedule, provided acceptable patient tolerance. 
Patients must be on stable doses* of IVIg. Before initiating therapy with the medicinal product, the 
weekly equivalent dose should be calculated by dividing the last IVIg dose by the IVIg dose interval 
in weeks. The starting dose and dosing frequency are the same as the patient’s previous IVIg 
treatment. The typical dosing interval for HyQvia is 4-weeks. For patients with less frequent IVIg 
dosing (greater than 4-weeks), the dosing interval can be converted to 4-weeks while maintaining the 
same monthly equivalent IgG dose. 
As shown in the table below, the calculated one-week dose (1st infusion) should be administered 
2 - weeks after the last IVIg infusion. One week after the first dose, the next weekly equivalent dose 
(2nd infusion) should be administered. A titration schedule can take up to 9-weeks (Table 1), 
depending on the dosing interval and tolerability.

*(Variations in the dosing interval of up to ±7 days or monthly equivalent dose amount of up to ±20% 
between the subject’s IgG infusions are considered a stable dose.)

On a given infusion day, the maximum infusion volume should not exceed 1200 mL for patients 
weighing ≥40 kg or 600 mL for <40 kg. Suppose the maximum daily dose limit is exceeded or the 
patient cannot tolerate the infusion volume. In that case, the dose may be administered over multiple 
days in divided doses with 48-to 72-hours between doses to allow absorption of infusion fluid at the 
infusion site(s). The dose can be administered up to 3 infusion sites with a maximum infusion volume 
of 600 mL per site (or as tolerated). If using three sites, the maximum is 400 mL per site. 
Paediatric population 
Replacement therapy 
The dosing schedule for children and adolescents (0 to 18 years) is the same as for adults. The dosing 
is based on body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome. Currently, available data are described 
in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
Immunomodulatory therapy 
The dosing schedule for children and adolescents (0 to 18 years) is the same as for adults. The dosing 
is based on the calculated weekly equivalent dose and adjusted to the clinical outcome. Currently, 
available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
Method of administration 
The medicinal product is for subcutaneous use only, do not administer intravenously. 
Each vial of IG 10% is supplied with the appropriate corresponding quantity of rHuPH20 
(see section 6.5). The full contents of the rHuPH20 vial should be administered regardless of whether 
the full content of the IG 10% vial is administered. 
The 2 components of the medicinal product must be administered sequentially through the same 
subcutaneous needle beginning with the rHuPH20 followed by IG 10%. 
Example: Patient is prescribed 110 grams (g) of HyQvia: This will require 3 vials of 30 g and 1 vial of 
20 g for the total dose of 110 g/1100 mL of the IG 10% component of HyQvia. The volume of 
rHuPH20 will be (3 x 15 mL + 1 x10 mL) = 55 mL. If the dose is greater than 120 g, HyQvia may be 
administered over multiple days in divided doses with 48-to 72-hours between doses to allow 
absorption of infusion fluid at the infusion site(s). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infusion site leakage can occur during or after subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulin, 
including HyQvia. Consider using longer needles (12 mm or 14 mm) and/or more than one infusion 
site. Any change of needle size would have to be supervised by the treating physician. 
Home-treatment 
In case subcutaneous infusion of HyQvia is used for home treatment, therapy should be initiated and 
monitored by a physician experienced in the guidance of patients for home treatment. The patient or a 
caregiver must be instructed in infusion techniques, the use of an infusion pump or syringe driver, the 
keeping of a treatment diary, recognition of possible severe adverse reactions and measures to be taken 
in case these occur. 
HyQvia can be administered in a full therapeutic dose at up to 3 infusion sites up to every 4-weeks. 
Adjust the frequency and number of infusion sites, considering volume, total infusion time, and 
tolerability so that the patient receives the same weekly equivalent dose. If a patient misses a dose, 
administer the missed dose as soon as possible and then resume scheduled treatments as applicable. 
Device-assisted infusion 
The IG 10% component should be infused using a pump. The rHuPH20 may be hand-pushed or 
infused by a pump. A 24-gauge needle may be required to allow patients to infuse at flow rates of 
300 mL/hr/infusion site. However, needles with smaller diameters may be used if slower flow rates are 
acceptable. For the 1.25 mL rHuPH20 vial size use an 18-to 22-gauge needle to withdraw the contents 
of the vial to prevent stopper push through or coring; for all other vial sizes a needle or needleless 
device may be used to withdraw the contents of the vial. 
Infusion site 
The suggested site(s) for the infusion of the medicinal product are the middle to upper abdomen and 
thighs. If 2 sites are used, the 2 infusion sites should be on contra lateral sides of the body. If using 
three infusion sites, the sites should be at least 10 cm apart. Avoid bony prominences, or scarred areas. 
The product should not be infused at or around an infected or acutely inflamed area due to the 
potential risk of spreading a localized infection. Avoid at least 5 cm away from the umbilicus. 
Infusion rate 
It is recommended that the rHuPH20 component be administered at a constant rate and that the rate of 
administration of the IG 10% should not be increased above the recommended rates, particularly when 
the patient has just started with HyQvia therapy. 
First, the full dose of rHuPH20 solution is infused at a rate of 1 to 2 mL/minute (or 60 mL/hr to 
120 mL/hr) per infusion site or as tolerated. Within 10 minutes of the rHuPH20, start the infusion of 
the full dose per site of IG 10% through the same subcutaneous needle set. 
The following infusion rates of the IG 10% are recommended per infusion site.

If the patient tolerates the initial infusions at the full dose per site and maximum rate, an increase in 
the rate of successive infusions may be considered at the discretion of the physician and the patient. 
For instructions on the handling and preparation of the medicinal product before administration, 
see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
HyQvia must not be given intravenously or intramuscularly. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance (IgG) or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1 (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, especially in very rare cases of IgA deficiency when 
the patient has antibodies against IgA. 
Known systemic hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or rHuPH20. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Precautions for use 
If HyQvia is accidentally administered into a blood vessel, patients could develop shock. 
The recommended infusion rate given in section 4.2 should be adhered to. Patients must be 
closely monitored throughout the infusion period, particularly patients starting with therapy. 
Certain adverse reactions may occur more frequently in patients who receive human normal 
immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when the human normal immunoglobulin 
product is switched or when there has been a long interval since the previous infusion. 
Potential complications can often be avoided by: 
• 
• 
initially infusing the product slowly (see section 4.2). 
ensuring that patients are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. 
In particular, patients naive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an 
alternative immunoglobulin product or when there has been a long interval since the previous 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infusion should be monitored during the first infusion and for the first hour after the first 
infusion, to detect potential adverse signs. 
All other patients should be observed for at least 20 minutes after the administration. 
When treatment is given at home, support from another responsible person should be available for 
treating adverse reactions or to summon help should a serious adverse reaction occur. Patients on self-
home treatment and/or their guardian should also be trained to detect early signs of hypersensitivity 
reactions. 
In case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration must be reduced, or the infusion stopped. 
The treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction. In case of shock, 
immediately discontinue the infusion and treat the patient for shock. 
No chronic changes in the skin were observed in the clinical studies. Patients should be reminded 
to report any chronic inflammation, nodules or inflammation that occurs at the infusion site and 
lasts more than a few days. 
Hypersensitivity to IG 10% 
True hypersensitivity reactions are rare. They can particularly occur in patients with anti-IgA 
antibodies who should be treated with particular caution. Patients with anti-IgA antibodies, in whom 
treatment with SCIg products remains the only option, should be treated with HyQvia only under close 
medical supervision.  
Rarely, human normal immunoglobulin can induce a fall in blood pressure with anaphylactic reaction, 
even in patients who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If a patient is at high risk for any allergic reactions, the medicinal product should be 
administered only where supportive care is available for life threatening reactions. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity (hives, pruritus, 
generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, and hypotension). 
Depending on the severity of associated reaction, and medical practice, pre-medication may 
prevent this type of reaction. 
If known anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin exists, it should 
be noted in the patient records. 
Hypersensitivity to rHuPH20 
Any suspicion of allergic or anaphylactic like reactions following rHuPH20 administration requires 
immediate discontinuation of the infusion and standard medical treatment should be administered, if 
necessary. 
Immunogenicity of rHuPH20 
Development of non-neutralizing antibodies and neutralizing antibodies to the rHuPH20 component 
has been reported in patients receiving HyQvia in clinical studies. The potential exists for such 
antibodies to cross-react with endogenous hyaluronidase, which is known to be expressed in the adult 
male testes, epididymis, and sperm. It is unknown whether these antibodies may have any clinical 
significance in humans (see section 4.8). 
Thromboembolism 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Arterial and venous thromboembolic events including myocardial infarction, stroke, deep venous 
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been associated with the use of immunoglobulins. Patients 
should be sufficiently hydrated before using immunoglobulins. Caution should be exercised in patients 
with preexisting risk factors for thromboembolic events (such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic episodes, patients with acquired or inherited 
thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods of immobilization, severely hypovolemic 
patients, patients with diseases which increase blood viscosity). Monitor for signs and symptoms of 
thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. Thrombosis may also 
occur in the absence of known risk factors. 
Patients should be informed about first symptoms of thromboembolic events including shortness of 
breath, pain and swelling of a limb, focal neurological deficits and chest pain and should be advised to 
contact their physician immediately upon onset of symptoms. 
Haemolytic anaemia 
Immunoglobulin products contain antibodies to blood groups (e.g. A, B, D) which may act as 
haemolysins. These antibodies bind to red blood cells (RBC) epitopes (which may be detected as a 
positive direct antiglobulin test [DAT, (Coombs’ test)] and, rarely, may cause haemolysis. 
Immunoglobulin product recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of 
haemolysis. 
Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) 
Aseptic meningitis syndrome has been reported to occur in association with IVIg and SCIg treatment; 
the symptoms usually begin within several hours to 2 days following immunoglobulin treatment. 
Patients should be informed about the first symptoms which encompass severe headache, neck 
stiffness, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Discontinuation of immunoglobulin 
treatment may result in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae. Cerebrospinal fluid 
studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm3, predominantly 
from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL. 
AMS may occur more frequently in association with high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg treatment. From 
post-marketing data no clear correlation of AMS to higher doses was observed. Higher incidences of 
AMS were seen in women. 
Interference with serological testing 
After infusion of immunoglobulins, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies 
in the patient’s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing.  
Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte´s surface antigens, (e.g., A, B, D) may interfere with 
some serological tests for red cell antibodies for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct 
Coombs’ test). 
Infusions of immunoglobulin products may lead to false positive readings in assays that depend on 
detection of β-D-glucans for diagnosis of fungal infections; this may persist during the weeks 
following infusion of the product. 
Transmissible agents 
Human normal immunoglobulin and human serum albumin (stabilizer of the rHuPH20) are produced 
from human plasma. Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal 
products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual 
donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective 
manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products 
prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infectious 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other 
pathogens. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for the non-enveloped hepatitis 
A (HAV) and parvovirus B19 viruses. 
There is reassuring clinical evidence regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 transmission 
with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an important 
contribution to viral safety. 
Sodium content 
The IG 10% component is essentially sodium-free. The rHuPH20 contains the following amount (mg) 
of sodium per vial: 
1.25 mL contains 5.0 mg of sodium 
2.5 mL contains 10.1 mg of sodium 
5 mL contains 20.2 mg of sodium 
10 mL contains 40.3 mg of sodium 
15 mL contains 60.5 mg of sodium 
This is equivalent to 0.25 to 3% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for 
an adult. 
Paediatric population 
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Live attenuated virus vaccines 
Immunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6-weeks and up to 3-months 
the efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After 
administration of this medicinal product, an interval of 3-months should elapse before vaccination 
with live attenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up 
to 1 year. Therefore, patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked. 
Paediatric population 
The listed interactions apply both to adults and children. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled 
clinical studies and therefore should only be given with caution to pregnant women and breast-feeding 
mothers. 
Nine women ever treated with HyQvia were enrolled in a prospective, uncontrolled, multicenter 
post-authorization Pregnancy Registry (Study 161301). Of the 8 pregnancies with known outcomes, 
there were 8 live births with normal APGAR scores. There were no specified labor or delivery 
complications. No adverse events were reported as related to this medicinal product. Four (4) mothers 
were tested for anti-rHuPH20 binding, or neutralizing antibodies and no antibodies were detected. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunoglobulin products have been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly during the third 
trimester. Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of 
pregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are to be expected. 
Development and reproductive toxicology studies have been conducted with rHuPH20 in mice and 
rabbits. No adverse reactions on pregnancy and foetal development were associated with 
anti-rHuPH20 antibodies. In these studies, maternal antibodies to rHuPH20 were transferred to 
offspring in utero. The effects of antibodies to the rHuPH20 component of this medicinal product on 
the human embryo or on human foetal development are currently unknown (see section 5.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Immunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may contribute to protecting the neonate from 
pathogens which have a mucosal portal of entry. One infant in the Pregnancy Registry (Study 161301) 
was breastfed. All adverse events were reported as not related to previous or current HyQvia 
treatment. 
Fertility 
There are currently no clinical safety data for this medicinal product on fertility available. 
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects of IG 10% on fertility 
are to be expected. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of rHuPH20 with respect to 
reproductive potential at the doses used for facilitating administration of IG 10% (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions e.g., dizziness 
(see section 4.8) associated with this medicinal product. Patients who experience adverse reactions 
during treatment should wait for these to resolve before driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (ARs) of HyQvia were local reactions. The most 
frequently reported systemic ARs were headache, fatigue, nausea and pyrexia. The majority of these 
ARs were mild to moderate. 
IG 10% 
Adverse reactions such as chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, 
arthralgia, low blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally. 
Rarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated 
cases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous 
administration. 
Local reactions at infusion sites: swelling, soreness, redness, induration, local heat, itching, bruising 
and rash, may frequently occur. 
Cases of transient aseptic meningitis, transient hemolytic reactions, increase in serum creatinine level 
and/or acute renal failure have been observed with human normal immunoglobulin, see section 4.4. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein 
thrombosis have been rarely observed with IVIg and SCIg products. 
rHuPH20 
The most frequent adverse reactions reported during post-marketing use of rHuPH20 in similar 
formulations administered subcutaneously for the dispersion and absorption of subcutaneously 
administered fluids or medicinal products have been mild local infusion site reactions such as 
erythema and pain. Oedema has been reported most frequently in association with large volume 
subcutaneous fluid administration. 
Antibodies against rHuPH20 
A total of 13 out of 83 subjects who participated in pivotal PID study developed an antibody capable 
of binding to rHuPH20 at least once during the clinical study. These antibodies were not capable of 
neutralizing rHuPH20. No temporal association between adverse reactions and the presence of anti-
rHuPH20 antibodies could be demonstrated. There was no increase in incidence or severity of adverse 
reactions in patients who developed antibodies to rHuPH20. 
A total of 16 out of 132 patients who received rHuPH20 developed anti-rHuPH20 binding antibodies 
at least once in CIDP studies that included 196 patient-years of follow-up. One subject had transient

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of HyQvia was evaluated in 4 clinical studies (160602, 160603, 160902, and 161101) 
in 124 unique patients with PID receiving 3,202 infusions and 2 clinical studies (161403 and 161505) 
in 100 unique patients with CIDP receiving 3,188 infusions. 
The table presented below is according to the MedDRA System Organ Classification (SOC and 
Preferred Term Level). 
Frequencies per infusion have been evaluated using the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), 
very rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are selected based on the assessment by the sponsor. All occurrences 
of an ADR (during or after the first dose) are presented in the table, regardless of the relationship 
assessed by the investigator. For analysis purposes, certain preferred terms were collapsed.

Investigations 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
The most common local reactions observed during the pivotal clinical studies include infusion site 
pain, infusion site erythema and infusion site oedema. Most of the local reactions were mild in severity 
and self-limited. In the PID studies, 2 instances of local adverse reactions were severe (infusion site 
pain and infusion site swelling) and in the CIDP studies 4 instances were severe (infusion site 
extravasation, infusion site inflammation, infusion site pruritus and infusion site reaction). In the PID 
studies, there were 2 instances of transient genital oedema, one considered severe, that resulted from 
diffusion of the medicinal product from the infusion site in the abdomen. In the CIDP studies there 
was one mild instance of genital oedema (penile swelling). No skin changes were observed that did 
not resolve during the clinical study. 
Paediatric population 
PID 
In the pivotal study 160603 there were 2 of the 24 paediatric patients with total anti-rHuPH20 
antibody levels at or above 1:160. None had neutralising antibodies. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A prospective, Phase 4, multicentre study in Europe evaluated 42 paediatric subjects (age 2 to 
<18 years) who had received prior immunoglobulin therapy (Study 161504). No new safety concerns 
were identified. No subject was positive (titer ≥160) for binding antirHuPH20 antibodies. HyQvia was 
found to be safe and tolerable among paediatric subjects (2 to <18 years old) with PIDD. 
Results of clinical studies indicate similar safety profiles in adults and paediatric population, including 
the nature, frequency, seriousness and reversibility of adverse reactions. 
CIDP 
HyQvia has not been evaluated in clinical studies in children or adolescent patients (0 to 18 years) 
with CIDP. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. 
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The consequences of an overdose are not known.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group (human normal immunoglobulin): immune sera and immunoglobulins: 
immunoglobulins, normal human, ATC code: J06BA01 
Mechanism of action 
The IG 10% component provides the therapeutic effect of this medicinal product. The rHuPH20 
facilitates the dispersion and absorption of IG 10%. 
Human normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of 
opsonising and neutralizing antibodies against infectious agents. Human normal immunoglobulin 
contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is usually prepared from pooled 
human plasma from not fewer than 1000 donations. It has a distribution of IgG subclasses closely 
proportional to that in native human plasma. Adequate doses of human normal immunoglobulin may 
restore abnormally low IgG levels to the normal range. The mechanism of action in indications other 
than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated but includes immunomodulatory effects. 
Recombinant human hyaluronidase is a soluble recombinant form of human hyaluronidase that 
increases the permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by temporarily depolymerizing hyaluronan. 
Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the intercellular matrix of the connective tissue. It is 
depolymerized by the naturally occurring enzyme hyaluronidase. Unlike the stable structural 
components of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a very fast turnover with half-life of 
approximately 0.5 days. The rHuPH20 of HyQvia acts locally. The effects of the hyaluronidase are 
reversible, and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
PID 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy and safety of HyQvia was assessed in a phase 3 study (160603) in 83 patients with PID. 
Patients were treated with it at either 3- or 4-week treatment intervals for a total of 12-months 
(following a brief titration period). The dose was based on the previous treatment with intravenous 
IG 10% (320 to 1000 mg/kg body weight /4-weeks) and was individually adapted, ensuring adequate 
IgG levels throughout the study. 
The results of the study showed a rate of validated, acute, serious bacterial infections per year during 
HyQvia treatment of 0.025 (upper limit of the one-sided 99% confidence interval 0.046). The overall 
rate of infections was less during HyQvia administration than during the 3-months intravenous 
administration of IG 10%: the point estimate of the annualized rate of all infections was 
2.97 (95% CI: 2.51 to 3.47) for HyQvia and 4.51 (95% CI: 3.50 to 5.69) for intravenous IG 10% 
infusions. 
Nearly all of the subjects were able to attain the same dose interval with HyQvia as they had for 
intravenous administration. Seventy-eight (78) of 83 (94%) subjects attained the same 3- or 4-week 
dosing whereas one decreased from 4-to 3-weeks, one from 4-to 2-weeks and one from 3-to 2-weeks 
(2-subjects withdrew during the titration period). 
The median number of infusion sites per month for HyQvia was 1.09, which is slightly lower than 
the median number of intravenous IG 10% infusion sites used in this study (1.34), and considerably 
lower than the median number of infusion sites in the study of subcutaneous administration of 
IG 10% (21.43). 
Sixty-six (66) patients who completed the pivotal phase 3 study participated in an extension study 
(160902) for the evaluation of long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of HyQvia in PID. 
The overall combined exposure of PID patients in both studies was 187.69 patient years; the longest 
exposure for adults was 3.8-years and 3.3-years for paediatric patients. 
CIDP 
Study 161403 (ADVANCE-1): 
In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, 132 adult subjects with CIDP 
underwent evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of HyQvia as a maintenance therapy to 
prevent relapse that allows self-infusion of a total therapeutic dose every 2- to 4-weeks. The study 
enrolled subjects ≥18 years of age (male or female) at the time of screening who had a documented 
diagnosis of definite or probable CIDP as per the European Federation of Neurological 
Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) 2010 criteria. All eligible subjects had responded to 
IgG treatment in the past (partial or complete resolution of neurological symptoms and deficits) and 
were on a stable dose of IVIg treatment within the dose range equivalent to a cumulative monthly dose 
of 0.4 to 2.4 g/kg body weight administered intravenously for at least 12-weeks before screening. The 
primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who experienced a relapse, defined as an increase of 
≥1 point relative to the pre-SC treatment baseline score in 2 consecutive adjusted inflammatory 
neuropathy cause and treatment (INCAT) disability scores obtained less than seven days apart. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint employing appropriate post-hoc strategies to handle intercurrent 
events and missing outcome values using multiple imputation revealed a relapse rate of 15.5% 
(95% CI: 8.36, 26.84) in the HyQvia and 31.7% (95% CI: 21.96, 43.39) in the placebo groups. The 
treatment difference was -16.2 (95% CI: -29.92, -1.27), favouring HyQvia over placebo. 
Paediatric population 
PID 
In the pivotal studies, HyQvia was evaluated in 24 paediatric patients, including 13 patients 
between 4 and < 12 years and 11 between 12 and < 18 years, who were treated for up to 3.3-years with 
an overall safety experience equivalent to 48.66 patient years (as described in section Clinical efficacy 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and safety). No appreciable differences in the pharmacodynamic effects or efficacy and safety of 
HyQvia were observed between paediatric patients and adults. See sections 4.2 and 4.8. 
The medicinal product was evaluated in 42 pediatric subjects (age 2 to <18 years), in a Phase 4, 
non-controlled, multicenter study in pediatric subjects who had received prior immunoglobulin 
therapy. No new safety concerns were identified in pediatric subjects with PID. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
HyQvia in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of PID as model for 
replacement therapy. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
CIDP 
HyQvia has not been evaluated in clinical studies in children or adolescent patients (0 to 18 years) 
with CIDP. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following subcutaneous administration of HyQvia in PID patients, peak serum IgG levels are 
achieved in the recipient’s circulation after approximately 3 to 5 days. 
IgG and IgG complexes are broken down in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. 
PID 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of HyQvia were evaluated in a clinical study (160601, 160602 and 
160603) in patients with PID aged 12 years and older. Data from the PID clinical studies show that 
serum IgG trough levels can be maintained by dosing regimens of 320 to 1000 mg/kg body 
weight/4-weeks given at intervals of 3- or 4-weeks. 
The pharmacokinetic results are presented in the table below, as compared to data for intravenous 
administration of IG 10% obtained in the same study.

CIDP 
The complete pharmacokinetic profile of HyQvia was not evaluated in the clinical study (161403) in 
patients with CIDP aged 18 years and older. Only the serum trough levels of total IgG were assessed 
throughout the study. Overall, during the treatment periods with HyQvia, serum trough levels of total 
IgG remained stable. For subjects who developed a relapse and switched to IVIg (n=6), the serum 
trough levels of total IgG also appeared stable throughout the treatment periods on HyQvia or IVIg. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median serum trough levels of total IgG in CIDP were approximately 40% greater than in PID. 
Paediatric population 
PID 
In the clinical study with HyQvia, no differences in the plasma IgG trough levels were observed 
between adult and paediatric patients. 
CIDP 
HyQvia has not been evaluated in clinical studies in children or adolescent patients (0 to 18 years) 
with CIDP. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Immunoglobulins are normal constituents of the human body. 
The safety of IG 10% has been demonstrated in several non-clinical studies. Non-clinical data reveal 
no special risk for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and toxicity. Studies 
of repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction in animals are impracticable due 
to induction of and interference by developing antibodies to heterologous proteins. 
Long term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of rHuPH20 have not 
been conducted. No adverse reactions on fertility were observed in mice, rabbits and cynomolgus 
monkeys exposed to antibodies that bind to rHuPH20 and species-specific hyaluronidase. Reversible 
infertility has been observed in male and female guinea pigs immunized to produce antibodies to 
hyaluronidase. However, antibodies to hyaluronidase did not influence reproduction following 
immunization of mice, rabbits, sheep, or cynomolgus monkeys. The effects of antibodies that bind to 
rHuPH20 on human fertility are unknown.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What HyQvia is and what it is used for 
What HyQvia is 
HyQvia contains 2 solutions for infusion (drip) under the skin (subcutaneous or SC infusion). 
It is supplied as a package containing: 
•  one vial of human normal immunoglobulin 10% (the active substance)  
•  one vial of recombinant human hyaluronidase (a substance which helps the human normal 
immunoglobulin 10% reach your blood). 
Human normal immunoglobulin 10% belong to a class of medicines called “human normal 
immunoglobulins”. Immunoglobulins are also known as antibodies and are found in healthy people’s 
blood. Antibodies are part of the immune system (the body’s natural defences) and help your body to 
fight infections. 
How HyQvia works 
The recombinant human hyaluronidase is a protein that makes it easier for the immunoglobulins to be 
infused (dripped) under the skin and to reach your blood system. 
The vial of immunoglobulins has been prepared from the blood of healthy people. Immunoglobulins 
are produced by the human body’s immune system. They help your body to fight infections caused by 
bacteria and viruses or maintain the balance in your immune system (referred to as 
immunomodulation). The medicine works in the same way as the immunoglobulins naturally present 
in the blood. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What HyQvia is used for  
Replacement therapy in adults and children (0to 18 years) 
HyQvia is used in patients with a weak immune system,who do not have sufficient antibodies in their 
blood and tend to get frequent infections, including the following groups: 
• 
patients with an inborn inability or reduced ability to produce antibodies (primary 
immunodeficiencies). 
patients who experience severe or recurrent infections due to a weakened immune system 
resulting from other conditions or treatments (secondary immunodeficiencies). 
• 
Regular and sufficient doses of HyQvia can raise abnormally low immunoglobulin levels in your 
blood to normal levels (replacement therapy) 
Immunomodulatory therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0 to-18 years) 
HyQvia is used in adults, children and adolescents (0 to 18 years) patients with chronic inflammatory 
demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a form of autoimmune disease. CIDP is characterised by 
chronic inflammation of the peripheral nerves that causes muscle weakness and/or numbness mainly 
in the legs and arms. It is believed that the body’s own defense system attacks the peripheral nerves 
and causes nerve damage and inflammation. Immunoglobulins present in HyQvia are thought to help 
protect the nerves from being damaged by the immune system. 
2.  What you need to know before you use HyQvia 
Do not inject or infuse HyQvia 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to immunoglobulins, hyaluronidase, recombinant hyaluronidase or any 
of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6, “Contents of the pack and other 
information”). 
if you have antibodies against immunoglobulin A (IgA) in your blood. This may occur if you 
have IgA deficiency. Since HyQvia contains trace amounts of IgA, you might have an allergic 
reaction. 
into a blood vessel (intravenously) or into a muscle (intramuscularly). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using HyQvia. 
► 
Tell your doctor or healthcare professional prior to treatment if any of the circumstances 
listed below applies to you: 
•  You may be allergic to immunoglobulins without knowing it. Allergic reactions such as sudden 
fall in blood pressure or anaphylactic shock (a sharp fall in blood pressure with other symptoms 
such as swelling of the throat, breathing difficulties and skin rash) are rare but they can 
occasionally occur even if you have not previously had problems with similar treatments. You are 
at increased risk of allergic reactions if you have IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies. Signs or 
symptoms of these rare allergic reactions include: 
o 
feeling light-headed, dizzy or faint, 
o  skin rash and itchiness, swelling in the mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, wheezing, 
o  abnormal heart rate, chest pain, blueness of lips or fingers and toes, 
o  blurred vision. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
► 
If you notice any of these signs during the infusion, tell your doctor or nurse immediately. 
He or she will decide whether to slow down the infusion rate or stop the infusion 
completely. 
Your doctor or nurse will first infuse HyQvia slowly, and carefully monitor you throughout the first 
infusions so that any allergic reaction can be detected and treated immediately. 
•  Your doctor will take special care if you are overweight, are elderly, have diabetes, have been 
bedridden for a long time, have high blood pressure, have low blood volume (hypovolaemia), have 
problems with your blood vessels (vascular diseases), have an increased tendency for blood 
clotting (thrombophilia or thrombotic episodes) or have a disease or a condition which causes your 
blood to thicken (hyper viscous blood). In these circumstances, immunoglobulins may increase the 
risk of heart attack (cardiac infarction), stroke, blood clots in the lung (lung embolism), or 
blockage of a blood vessel in the leg, although only very rarely. 
► 
If you notice any of these signs and symptoms, including shortness of breath, pain, 
swelling of a limb and chest pain during the infusion, tell your doctor or nurse 
immediately. They will decide whether to slow the infusion rate or stop it completely. 
Your doctor or nurse will carefully monitor you throughout the infusions so that any thromboembolic 
events can be detected and treated immediately. 
•  You will receive this medicine in high doses either on 1 day or 2 days, and if you have a blood 
group A, B, or AB and have an underlying inflammatory condition. In these circumstances, it has 
been commonly reported that immunoglobulins increase the risk of the breakdown of red blood 
cells (haemolysis). 
• 
Inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (Aseptic meningitis 
syndrome) has been reported to occur in association with immunoglobulin treatment. 
► 
If you notice any of these signs and symptoms, including severe headache, neck stiffness, 
drowsiness, fever, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting after the infusion, tell your doctor 
or nurse immediately. 
Your doctor will decide if further tests are necessary and whether HyQvia should be continued. 
Infusion speed 
It is very important to infuse the medicine at the correct speed. Your doctor or nurse will advise 
you on the appropriate infusion speed to use when you are infusing HyQvia at home (see section 3, 
“How to use HyQvia”). 
Monitoring during infusion 
Certain side effects may occur more frequently if: 
- 
you are receiving HyQvia for the first time. 
- 
you have received another immunoglobulin and have been switched to HyQvia. 
- 
there has been a long interval (e.g., more than 2 or 3 infusion intervals) since you last received 
HyQvia. 
► 
In such cases, you will be closely monitored during your first infusion and for the first 
hour after your infusion has stopped. 
In all other cases you should be monitored during the infusion and for at least 20 minutes after you 
receive HyQvia for the first few infusions. 
Home treatment 
Before you start home treatment you should assign a person as guardian. You and your guardian will 
be trained to detect early signs of side effects, especially allergic reactions. This guardian should help 
you keep an eye on potential side effects. During the infusion you must look out for the first signs of 
side effects (for further details see section 4, “Possible side effects”). 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
► 
► 
If you experience any side effects, you or your guardian must stop the infusion 
immediately and contact a doctor. 
If you experience a severe side effect, you or your guardian must seek emergency 
treatment immediately. 
Spread of localised infections 
Do not infuse HyQvia into or around an infected or red swollen area on your skin because it may 
cause the infection to spread. 
No long-term (chronic) changes in the skin were observed in the clinical studies. Any long-term 
inflammation, lumps (nodules) or inflammation that occur at the infusion site and last more than 
a few days should be reported to your physician. 
Effects on blood tests 
HyQvia contains many different antibodies, some of which can affect blood tests (serological tests). 
Tell your doctor about your treatment with HyQvia before any blood test. 
► 
Information on the source material of HyQvia 
The human normal immunoglobulin 10% of HyQvia and human serum albumin (an ingredient of the 
recombinant human hyaluronidase) are made from human plasma (the liquid part of blood). When 
medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include: 
- 
- 
careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded, and 
the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of viruses/infections. 
Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can 
inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or 
plasma are used, the possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to 
any unknown or emerging viruses or other types of infections. 
The measures taken for the manufacture of HyQvia are considered effective for enveloped viruses 
such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus and for the 
non-enveloped hepatitis A virus and parvovirus B19. 
Immunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections possibly 
because the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in HyQvia, are protective. 
► 
It is strongly recommended that every time you use HyQvia, the following data are 
recorded in your treatment diary: 
▪ 
the date of administration, 
▪ 
the batch number of the medicine, and 
▪ 
the injected volume, flow rate, the number and location of infusion sites. 
Children and adolescents 
Replacement therapy  
The same indications, dose and frequency of infusion as for adults apply for children and adolescents 
(0 to18 years).  
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunomodulatory therapy in CIDP patients  
The safety and effectiveness of HyQvia have not been established in children and adolescents (0 to 
18 years) with CIDP. 
Other medicines and HyQvia 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Vaccinations 
HyQvia may reduce the effect of some virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and chicken 
pox (live virus vaccines). Therefore, after receiving HyQvia, you may have to wait for up to 3 -months 
before receiving certain vaccines. You may have to wait for up to 1 year after receiving HyQvia before 
you can receive your measles vaccine. 
► 
Please tell your vaccinating doctor or nurse about your treatment with HyQvia. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
The data on the effects of long-term use of recombinant human hyaluronidase on pregnancy, 
breast-feeding and fertility are limited. HyQvia should only be used by pregnant and breast-feeding 
women after discussion with your physician. 
Driving and using machines 
Patients may experience side effects (for example dizziness or nausea) during treatment with HyQvia 
that might affect the ability to drive and use machines. If this happens, you should wait until the 
reactions have disappeared. 
HyQvia contains sodium 
This medicine contains 5.0 to 60.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each 
recombinant human hyaluronidase vial of HyQvia. This is equivalent to 0.25 to 3% of the 
recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. The IG 10% component is 
essentially sodium-free. 
3. 
How to use HyQvia 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are 
not sure. 
HyQvia has to be infused under the skin (subcutaneous or SC administration). 
Treatment with HyQvia will be started by your doctor or nurse, but you may be allowed to use the 
medicine at home once you have received the first few infusions under medical supervision and you 
(and/or your guardian) have been adequately trained. You and your doctor will decide if you can use 
HyQvia at home. Do not begin treatment with HyQvia at home until you have received complete 
instructions. 
Dosing 
Replacement therapy 
Your doctor will calculate the correct dose for you based on your body weight, any previous treatment 
you may have received and your response to treatment. The recommended starting dose is one that 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
supplies 400 to 800 mg of active substance per kg of bodyweight per month. In the beginning you will 
receive one quarter of this dose at 1-week intervals. This will be increased step-wise to larger doses 
at 3- to 4-week intervals with the next infusions. Sometimes your doctor may recommend that larger 
doses are split and given at 2 sites at once. Your doctor may also adjust your dose depending on your 
response to treatment. 
Immunomodulatory therapy 
Your doctor will calculate the correct dose for you based on the previous treatments you may have 
received and your response to treatment. Therapy typically begins 1-to 2-weeks after your last 
immunoglobulin infusion, delivered subcutaneously at the calculated weekly equivalent dose. Your 
doctor may adjust the dose and frequency based on your response to treatment.  
In case the maximum daily dose is exceeded (>120 g) or if you can't tolerate the immunoglobulin 
infusion volume, the dose may be divided and given over multiple days, with 48 to 72 hours between 
doses for proper absorption and the administration of hyaluronidase should also be divided 
appropriately. 
Starting treatment 
Your treatment will be started by a doctor or nurse experienced in treating patients with a weak 
immune system (immunodeficiency) and CIDP in guiding patients for home treatment. You will be 
watched carefully throughout the infusion and for at least 1 hour after stopping the infusion to see how 
well you tolerate the medicine. In the beginning your doctor or nurse will use a slow infusion speed 
and gradually increase it during the first infusion and in the following infusions. Once the doctor or 
nurse has found the right dose and speed of infusion for you, you may be allowed to give the treatment 
to yourself at home. 
Home treatment 
Do not use HyQvia at home until you get instructions and training from your healthcare professional. 
You will be instructed in: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Germ-free (aseptic) infusion techniques, 
The use of an infusion pump or syringe driver (if needed), 
Keeping a treatment diary, and 
Measures to be taken in case of severe side effects. 
You must carefully follow your doctor’s instructions regarding the dose, infusion speed and schedule 
for infusing HyQvia so that your treatment works for you. 
The following infusion rates of the IG 10% are recommended per infusion site:

The infusion rates above are for a single infusion site. In case the patient requires 2 or 3 infusion sites 
the infusion rates may be adjusted accordingly, (i.e., doubled or tripled based on the maximum 
infusion rate of the pump) 
If you have an infusion site leakage 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse if another needle size would be more appropriate for you. 
Any change of needle size would have to be supervised by the treating physician. 
If you use more HyQvia than you should 
If you think that you used more HyQvia than you should, speak to your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you forget to use HyQvia 
Do not infuse a double dose of HyQvia to make up for a missed dose. If you think that you have 
missed a dose speak to your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, or pharmacist or nurse.

8.  
Prepare human normal immunoglobulin 10% vial: 
• 
Prepare to transfer the immunoglobulin 10% component 
of HyQvia by wiping each vial stopper with a separate 
alcohol swab, if directed and allow to air dry (at 
least 30 seconds). 
The human normal immunoglobulin 10% of HyQvia may 
be infused either 
o 
• 
o 
by pooling from the vials either into larger syringe 
(a) or an infusion bag (b) as directed by your 
healthcare professional, depending upon the pump 
to be used; or 
directly from the IG vial. Insert the spike of the 
vented pump tubing or spike and venting needle 
into human normal immunoglobulin 10% vial(s). 
Fill the administration pump tubing and set aside 
until the recombinant human hyaluronidase has 
been administered. 
• 
If more than one vial is required for a full dose, spike 
subsequent vials after the first vial has been fully 
administered. 
Prepare the pump: 
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for preparing the pump. 
9.  
10.   Prepare the infusion site: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Choose an infusion site(s) in either the middle to upper 
abdomen or thigh. See image for infusion site locations. 
o 
Select sites on the opposite sides of the body if 
instructed to infuse in two sites for doses 
above 600 mL. 
If using three sites, the sites should be 10 cm apart 
o 
Avoid bony areas, visible blood vessels, scars and any 
areas of inflammation or infection. 
Rotate infusion sites by choosing opposite sides of the 
body between future infusions. 
If instructed by your health care professional, clean the 
infusion site(s) with an alcohol swab. Allow to dry (at 
least 30 seconds). 
11.  
Insert the needle: 
• 
Remove the needle cover. Firmly grasp and pinch at 
least 2 to 2.5 cm of skin between two fingers. 
Insert needle completely to the wings of the needle with a 
rapid motion straight into the skin at a 90degree angle. 
Wings of needle should lay flat on the skin. 
Secure needle in place with sterile tape. 
Repeat this step if you have a second or third infusion site. 
• 
• 
• 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.   Check for proper needle placement before starting the 
infusion if instructed by your healthcare professional. 
13.   Secure the needle to the skin: 
• 
• 
Secure the needle(s) in place by putting a sterile clear 
bandage over the needle. 
Check infusion site(s) occasionally throughout the 
infusion for dislodgement or leaking. 
14.   Administer the recombinant human hyaluronidase infusion 
first: 
Divide the contents equally between all sites, if more than one 
site is used. 
If using the push method to deliver HY: 
• 
Slowly push the plunger of the smaller syringe with the 
recombinant human hyaluronidase at an initial rate per 
infusion site to approximately 1 to 2 mL per minute and 
increase as tolerated. 
If using the pump method to deliver HY: 
• 
If using a pump, prepare the pump to infuse the 
recombinant human hyaluronidase at an initial rate per 
infusion site of 60 to 120 mL/hour/site and increase as 
tolerated. 
15.   Administer the human normal immunoglobulin 10%: 
After infusing all of the content of the smaller syringe 
(recombinant human hyaluronidase), remove the syringe from 
the hub of the needle set/pump tubing. 
Attach the pump tubing to the IG container/vial or, the larger 
syringe containing human normal immunoglobulin 10% to the 
needle set. 
Administer the human normal immunoglobulin 10% with a 
pump at the rates prescribed by your healthcare professional and 
start the infusion. 
16.   Flush the pump tubing when the infusion is complete if 
instructed by your healthcare professional: 
• 
If instructed by your healthcare professional, attach a 
sodium chloride solution bag to the pump tubing/needle 
set to push the human normal immunoglobulin 10% up to 
the needle wings. 
17.   Remove needle set:

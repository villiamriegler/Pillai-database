C.I.4: Update of sections 4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC of 
Humalog/Liprolog in pre-filled pens and cartridges to 
address the PRAC recommendation regarding the 
potential increased risk of medication error 
associated with withdrawing insulin from pre-filled 
pens and cartridges, leading to dysglycaemia.

risk of medication error associated with withdrawing insulin 
from pre-filled pens and cartridges, leading to 
dysglycaemia and to add the recommendation to only use 
Lilly insulin cartridges in with Lilly reusable pens. 
 In addition, the MAH has included in section 6.6 of the 
SmPC the recommendation that Humalog cartridges are to 
be used with a Lilly reusable insulin pen and should not be 
used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy 
has not been established with other pens and that Liprolog 
cartridges are to be used with a Lilly reusable insulin pen 
and should not be used with any other reusable pen as the 
dose accuracy has not been established with other pen.  
The Basal presentation has also been deleted from the 
marketing authorisation.

Review of the safety information from Lilly Safety System 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Further to a review of safety information pertaining 
to the risk of fluid retention and congestive heart 
failure with the use of insulin lispro, section 4.8 of 
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) is 
updated by adding a warning on an increased 
incidence of oedema. The Package Leaflet section 4 
is updated accordingly. 
This application was submitted for a group of 
variations consisting of Type II variations following a 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
and literature data sources pertaining to the risk of fluid 
retention (including oedema and peripheral oedema) with 
the use of insulin lispro suggests a causal association 
between insulin lispro and the adverse event of oedema. 
Therefore it was proposed to provide information regarding 
oedema in the adverse event sections of the product 
information. Analysis of the patients exposed to insulin 
lispro between 1 January 1983 through 31 August 2010 
confirmed causal association between insulin lispro and the 
adverse event of oedema. Consequently Summary of 
Product Characteristics section 4.8 is updated by adding a 
warning on an increased incidence of oedema. It was 
agreed not to mention frequency as the majority of the 
reports occur within the first weeks of treatment. The 
Package Leaflet section 4 is updated accordingly.

increased risk of fluid retention and exacerbation of heart 
failure with the concomitant use of pioglitazone and insulin 
should apply to all centrally authorised insulin products. 
After the review of the available evidence, during its 
October 2010 meeting the PhVWP has concluded this 
review with a recommendation to the CHMP on the need to 
harmonise the SmPC and PL for all insulin products by 
including appropriate warning. The CHMP endorsed this 
recommendation, and in this context the Committee agreed 
that all centrally authorised insulin containing products 
should include warning on increased cardiac failure when 
pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially 
in patients with predisposing factors in the in the section 
4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL. 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Further to a CHMP request based on the 
recommendations from PhVWP, the Product 
Information (Summary of Product Characteristics 
section 4.4 and Package Leaflet section 2) is updated 
by adding a warning on an increased incidence of 
heart failure when pioglitazone is used in 
combination with insulin, especially in patients with 
predisposing factors.  
In addition to the above the MAH took the 
opportunity to update annex IIB "Other conditions"

The MAH reviewed their safety database over the period 01 
to add angiotensin II receptor blockers in the list of 
medicinal products that may reduce insulin 
requirements. The details of local representatives are 
updated. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
January 1983 - 28 February 2005.  
No suspected interaction with an angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARB) was reported. However, the review of the 
safety database showed a slight increased frequency of 
hypoglycaemic events in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor 
or an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ARB) as concomitant 
medication, which supports a possible interaction with 
insulin. Although the overall number of reports is lower 
with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors, the reporting rate 
appears to be the same. Although the mechanism of the 
interaction is not well understood, both types of medicinal 
products share the similar endpoint to decrease the effect 
of angiotensin II and thus, both have the potential to 
increase insulin sensitivity. A published clinical study 
comparing the effects of an ACEI and an ARB showed more 
pronounced effects of the ACE inhibitors on endothelial 
function but similar effects on insulin sensitivity (Am J 
Hypertens. 2005 Feb;18(2 Pt 1):178-82) and thus support 
the data from the MAH safety database. Therefore section 
4.5 of the SPC was updated to include ARBs in the list of 
medicinal products that may reduce insulin requirements

basal insulins for optimal glucose control, in 
particular nocturnal/fasting glucose control. In 
insulin lispro showed that there were no major differences 
in overall safety and efficacy between insulin lispro and 
human regular insulin. However, in two of the studies there 
were differences concerning fasting and nocturnal blood

glucose concentrations with higher concentrations in 
patients treated with insulin lispro. Therefore, and as 
recommended by the CHMP, sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the 
SPC are revised so that all information regarding 
adjustment of insulin doses can be found in the same 
section, and to strengthen that a patient also on basal 
insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to obtain 
glucose control across the whole day, particularly 
nocturnal/fasting glucose control.

hyperglycaemic plus one daily injection of insulin or a 
conventional insulin regimen consisting of once- or twice-

twice-daily insulin lispro LM in combination with metformin

glargine with metformin, as expressed in mean % HbA1c 
thereafter. The new data were reflected in section 5.1 of

provided a review of some studies included in the original 
dossier aiming to evaluate the overall reproductive 
performance in animals.  The studies showed that insulin 
lispro did not induced fertility impairment, embryotoxicity 
or teratogenicity in animals. The MAH also applied to 
include the following sentence in section 5.1 of the SPC: 
"Insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human 
insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and a 
shorter duration". Previously submitted data from the IMAC 
study was referred by the MAH to support this claim. Data 
from IMAC study demonstrated that at different doses, 
insulin lispro and regular human insulin showed almost 
identical pharmacokinetics and glucodynamics.Additionally, 
the MAH applied to update the SPC regarding the 
concomitant use of Liprolog and monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors. The reference that certain antidepressants might 
reduce insulin requirements was updated with monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors in section 4.5 of the SPC and PL. Three 
published papers were cited by the MAH as supporting 
evidence.Conditions which describe warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia were also updated in section 4.4 of the SPC.

provided data from five published clinical studies comparing 
postprandial glucose control with insulin lispro and regular 
human insulin. The following wording was added to section 
5.1 of the SPC for Liprolog: "Clinical trials in patients with 
Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced 
postprandial hyperglycaemia with insulin lispro compared to 
soluble human insulin. For fast acting insulins, any patient 
also on a basal insulin must optimise dosage of both 
insulins to obtain improved glucose control across the 
whole day" and the following sentence was added for 
Liprolog Mix25: "Clinical trials in patients with Type 1 and 
Type 2 diabetes have demonstrated reduced postprandial 
hyperglycaemia with Liprolog Mix25 compared to human

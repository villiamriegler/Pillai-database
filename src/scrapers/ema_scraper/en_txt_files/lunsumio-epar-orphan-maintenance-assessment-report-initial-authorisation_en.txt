2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2021 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing mosunetuzumab was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data which showed that heavily pre-treated 
patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma achieved partial or complete responses which 
were durable; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, 
splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction and the potential of transformation to aggressive 
lymphoma; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4.8 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing mosunetuzumab will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data that demonstrate sustained partial and complete 
responses in a high proportion of heavily pre-treated relapsed/refractory patients with follicular 
lymphoma who have failed several lines of approved therapies. The Committee considered that this 
constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) represents the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(NHL). It is an indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed germinal center B-cells 
consisting of a mixture of centrocytes (small to medium-sized cleaved follicular center cells) and 
centroblasts (large non-cleaved follicular center cells), mixed with non-malignant cells such as T-cells, 
follicular dendritic cells, and macrophages (Smith et al., 2013; Xerri et al., 2016). The WHO 
classification has adopted a grading from 1-3, where grade 3 has been subdivided into grade 3a, in 
which centrocytes are present, and grade 3b, in which there are sheets of centroblasts (Ott et al., 
2002). The clinical aggressiveness of FL increases with increasing numbers of centroblasts, and 
subsequently grades. FL grade 1-3a comprises the most prevalent indolent (low-grade) lymphoma 
subtype of NHL. FL grade 3b is categorized with other FLs but is at an intermediate stage of large cell 
transformation and is typically treated as an aggressive (high-grade) lymphoma (Dreyling et al., 2021; 
Swerdlow et al., 2017).

The aetiology of FL is still poorly understood. It has been suggested that age, gender, and ethnicity 
may affect a person’s likelihood of developing FL. The incidence increases with age; although in 
principle FL may occur at any age, it is extremely rare in children and adolescents. The median age at 
diagnosis of FL is around 60-65 years. Although onset can be gradual at the time of initial diagnosis, 
advanced FL is typically incurable, and the response rates are lower with shorter durations of response 
with successive lines of therapy. 
FL involves lymph nodes, but also spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and Waldeyer ring. 
Involvement of non-haematopoietic extra-nodal sites, such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or soft 
tissue are uncommon but may occur in a setting of widespread nodal disease. FL may occasionally be 
primary in extra-nodal sites, including skin, GI tract, particularly the duodenum, ocular adnexa, breast, 
and testis. 
Patients with FL generally present with asymptomatic lymphadenopathy, with waxing and waning 
symptoms present for years. Most patients therefore have widespread disease at diagnosis, including 
peripheral and central (abdominal and thoracic) lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Approximately 
10% of the patients have localized disease at diagnosis and less than 20% present with B symptoms 
(fever, night sweats and weight loss) and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The 
bone marrow is involved in 40-70% of the cases (Swerdlow et al., 2017; Freedman, 2020). As an 
intrinsic disease characteristic, FL typically evolve over time to an aggressive subtype, in 15% of 
cases. Disease relapse is usually rapid, where remissions become a serious challenge despite multiple 
interventions. Eventually, patients succumb to the refractory, high-grade disease transformation and 
the complications driven by treatments. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Lunsumio as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior 
systemic therapies” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of follicular 
lymphoma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Patients with advanced stage FL disease may experience B symptoms and suffer from unexplained 
fatigue/asthenia, local effects of lymphadenopathy such as abdominal pain, chest pain, cough or 
dyspnoea, or symptoms of bone marrow failure leading to cytopenia. Other symptoms depend on the 
location of the lymphoma (e.g., GI bleeding due to GI lymphomas, superior vena cava syndrome due 
to vein compression, renal failure due to ureter compression, and rarely spinal cord compression). 
Particularly patients with relapsed disease may have reduced quality of life. 
Although the life expectancy has improved due to recent therapeutic advances, FL patients frequently 
relapse and become progressively more refractory to subsequent lines of therapy. Advanced-stage FL 
is considered incurable with conventional chemotherapy, although patients often have good responses 
to treatment and might live for several years. The survival outcome worsens significantly as the 
patients progress through multiple lines of therapy and most patients eventually die of progressive 
lymphoma and its complications (Link et al., 2019). Furthermore, histologic transformation to high-
grade NHLs that are clinically more aggressive with a poor outcome is relatively common in patients 
with FL, occurring at a rate of approximately 2-3% per year (Kridel et al., 2016; Freedman, 2018).

The sponsor has not identified any changes in the severe nature of the condition since the orphan 
designation in 2021. FL remains life-threatening and chronically debilitating, mainly due to 
lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction, and the potential of transformation to 
aggressive lymphoma. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor conducted an extensive review of cancer registry data from the 27 EU member states 
(EU27) for the estimation of the prevalence of FL. Two different approaches were applied. For one of 
the methods, prevalence data were directly extracted from the following population-based cancer 
registries: the Integraal Kankercentrum Nederland (IKNL), Slovenian Cancer Registry, the Italian 
Association of Cancer Registries (AIRTUM), the Spanish Cancer Registries Network (REDECAN), 
Belgium Cancer Registry, HMRN (Yorkshire region in the UK), and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results (SEER) program in US (representing 28% of the US population). For the other method, the 
prevalence of NHL reported by the two population-based cancer registries NORDCAN (Nordic countries: 
Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) and the national German 
cancer registry Robert Koch Institute were used for indirect estimation. In the latter approach, the 
ratio of the crude incidence of FL to NHL was applied to the NHL prevalence. The NHL crude incidence 
estimates were obtained directly from the European Cancer Information System (ECIS). 
Two methodologies have been used in the direct approach based on data abstracted from available 
national cancer registries in the EU27 (i.e., IKNL, Slovenian Cancer Registry, and AIRTUM). Data from 
the HMRN and US SEER registry were only used to help indicate the potential direction the prevalence 
was going in for FL. The indirect methodology was conducted in a two-step process using data 
abstracted from cancer registry sources. Firstly, data were obtained on NHL prevalence, NHL incidence, 
and FL incidence, then the incidence rate ratio of FL to NHL was applied, multiplied by NHL prevalence.

Regarding the direct estimate for the prevalence, the sponsor noted they combined the directly 
reported complete prevalence for Slovenia (5.06 per 10,000), Italy (4.89), Spain (4.54), and the 
approximations used for the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and Germany (4.49) (based on the US 
data to establish trends). The sponsor arrived at a complete prevalence for these countries as 4.74 per 
10,000 people. 
A second prevalence estimate based on an indirect methodology was also discussed to supplement the 
direct estimates for the prevalence as noted above. The sponsor used a population-based incidence of 
0.329 per 10,000 for FL in this method, which represented a FL to NHL incidence ratio of 18.3%. This 
estimate was calculated based on data sources from cancer registries published after 2015. The 
sponsor proposed two indirect calculations and challenged the use of a median OS of 20 years. It was 
highlighted that hospital-based cancer registries are biased, especially when attempting to extrapolate 
to the broader population (dos Santos Silva 1999). As for the specific case of FL, hospital-based 
registries (relative to population-based cancer registries) overestimated survival by 5-10 years (Batlevi 
et al., 2020; Janikova et al., 2018; Mozas et al., 2020; Provencio et al., 2017) when compared with 
population-based registries from the European sources and lower median ages at diagnosis were 
reported (57-58 years versus 64-65 years). Data from population-based cancer registries was 
therefore considered more appropriate than data obtained from hospital-based cancer registries when 
attempting to estimate the total number of people affected by the disease at a population level. 
The sponsor acknowledged that survival of FL patients is improving and provided a population-based 
median OS estimate range of 12.5 to 14.8 years. When the median OS of 12.5 years was applied to 
the average age of FL diagnosis of 64 years (at the population level), the average age at death 
equated to 77 years. Similarly, if a median OS of 14.8 years was applied, an average age at death of 
79 years was approached. This correlated with the age range seen in recent publications reported from 
Denmark, Sweden, and Spain. 
Following these assumptions, a sensitivity analysis of indirect prevalence estimates of FL was explored 
using various ranges of median OS and incidence rates. as summarized in the diagram below: 
Figure 1.  
* 17.56% based on a FL to NHL incidence ratio for 17 EU countries and England (0.347/ 1.978 per 10,000). 
**18.3% based on an estimate excluding patients diagnosed before 2015 (0.329 / 1.801 per 10,000). 
*** 20% is based on a ratio previously recommended by the COMP and applied to the EU27 members states rate of 
(0.2 x 1.96 per 10,000 = 0.392 per 10,000). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 1/20 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The sponsor then proposed that the conservative estimate of 4.77 (which could be rounded up to 4.8) 
in 10,000 people can be taken as the estimate for the prevalence using the indirect method. 
In conclusion, the sponsor arrived at a complete prevalence estimate of 4.74 (or 4.7) per 10,000 
people for the EU27 population by using directly reported estimates (which also included an upper 
range of 4.8) and a range which included 4.8 in 10,000 people in the indirectly reported prevalence 
estimates. 
The sponsor rechecked each of the EU27 cancer registries used for the estimation of the FL prevalence 
which was accepted for the orphan designation in 2021 with updated information and did not find any 
major change. The COMP agreed that the estimate of approximately 4.8 per 10,000 persons in the 
European community remains accurate at this stage. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor described the treatment methods available to patients with FL based on European and 
American treatment guidelines (Dreyling et al., 2021; NCCN 2021). Several therapies are authorised 
both centrally and nationally in the EU for treatment of adult patients with FL, NHL, and lymphomas. 
These medicines include rituximab (MabThera), yttrium-90 [90Y]-radiolabelled ibritumomab tiuxetan 
(Zevalin), idelalisib (Zydelig), duvelisib (Copiktra), obinutuzumab (Gazyvaro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), 
pixantrone (Pixuvri), bendamustine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, 
etoposide, interferon-alpha-2a/b, prednisolone, and vincristine. Other treatment options also exist, 
such as radiotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or allogenic SCT. 
The clinical course of FL is characterized by recurrences requiring multiple lines of treatment until 
eventually patients run out of treatment options and develop fatal disease resistant to any available 
treatment. 
Patients with newly diagnosed FL are generally treated with an anti-CD20 antibody in monotherapy, 
rituximab (R) or obinutuzumab (G), or an anti-CD20-containing regimen (e.g., G/R-B, G/R-CHOP, and 
G/R-CVP) Available treatment options for r/r FL patients depends on the patient’s health, age, stage of 
disease, comorbidities, tumour burden, and the type and duration of response to prior therapy. The 
most recent European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines for newly diagnosed and 
relapsed FL describe the current standard of care for these patients (Dreyling, Ann Oncol. 2021; 32(3): 
298-308). According to the guidelines, therapy should be initiated only upon the development of 
symptoms. The guidelines identifies two types of FL patient populations that are offered two different 
treatment algorithms depending on their tumour burden, being either low (Figure 1) or high (Figure 2).

Significant benefit 
The sponsor did not seek protocol assistance from EMA for the justification of significant benefit. 
However, prior to the granting of the orphan designation, the sponsor received scientific advice on the 
mosunetuzumab clinical development plan in FL (Procedure No. EMEA/H/SA/4405/1/2020/III, 
EMEA/H/SA/4405/1/FU/1/2020/III). 
The sponsor argued that mosunetuzumab, which is a novel bispecific anti-CD20/CD3 antibody, has 
demonstrated to be of significant benefit with a clinically relevant advantage in terms of higher and 
durable observed complete responses (CRs) compared to those reported for existing methods of 
treatment for the target patient population. It was further emphasised that the improved efficacy has 
been demonstrated over the recommended treatment options for later relapse/progression in patients 
with low tumour burden (immunochemotherapy, rituximab monotherapy, radioimmunotherapy) and 
high tumour burden (immunochemotherapy, radioimmunotherapy, rituximab monotherapy, rituximab 
combined with lenalidomide, PI3K inhibitor) in both younger (<65 years) and older adults (>65 years). 
According to the sponsor, the clinical data from the pivotal study, with a clinical cut-off date of 15 
March 2021, showed that mosunetuzumab had similar efficacy and safety in the two age groups of r/r 
FL patients <65 years old and ≥65 years old. The primary data supporting the efficacy and safety of 
mosunetuzumab in FL in the CMA application were obtained from the ongoing, open-label, multicentre, 
dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase 1/2 study GO29781 (n=90) conducted in patients with r/r 
hematologic malignancies expected to express CD20, including B-cell NHL and chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL). Eligible patients in the expansion cohorts with FL had histologically documented 
grade 1-3a after ≥2 prior lines of systemic therapy and must have received prior treatment with an 
anti-CD20-directed therapy and an alkylating agent. The median age of the enrolled patients treated 
with mosunetuzumab at the recommended phase two dose (RP2D) in the expansion cohort was 60 
years (range: 29-90) and 31.1% were >65 years. Mosunetuzumab demonstrated a high response rate 
and CR rate in both age groups analysed. The ORR was 77% versus 83% in patients <65 years 
compared to those ≥65 years, and the CR rate was 52% versus 70%, respectively. In the broader 
patient population who received mosunetuzumab with the IV Cycle 1 step-up dosing regimen (Group 
B; N=410), the median age was 63 (range: 19-96), and 40.5% were >65 years. The safety profile of 
mosunetuzumab IV monotherapy in Group B was generally similar between patients aged 18-65 years 
(N=244) and those aged >65 years (N=166), supporting the use of mosunetuzumab in both age 
groups. 
Mosunetuzumab had consistent response rates in high-risk patient subgroups with r/r FL, including 
those with double-refractory disease (n=48; ORR: 69%, CR: 48%), those who progressed within 24 
months of initial first-line systemic therapy (POD24 [n=47]; ORR: 83%, CR: 55%), and patients who 
were refractory to PI3K inhibitors (n=12; ORR: 75%, CR: 50%). In the pivotal B11 r/r FL expansion 
cohort, the median number of prior lines of anti-lymphoma therapies was 3 (range: 2-10), and a high 
proportion had disease that was refractory to the last prior therapy (69%; 62/90), with approximately 
half of the patients double-refractory to a prior anti-CD20 and alkylator therapy (53%; 48/90). Around 
half of the patients had also POD24 (52%; 47/90), a prognostic factor being predictive of poor OS 
(Casulo et al., 2017; Seymour et al., 2019). Efficacy subgroup analyses revealed high and consistent 
CR rate and ORR in all analysed subgroups defined by various demographic- and baseline disease 
characteristics, including with regards to prior therapies and refractory status, supporting the use of 
mosunetuzumab in the broad r/r FL population after two prior systemic therapies. 
In the heavily pre-treated r/r FL population in study GO29781 that has exhausted several available 
treatment options, mosunetuzumab induced a high CR rate of 57.8% (95% CI: 46.9, 68.1), with an 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 1/20 
 
 
 
 
  
 
ORR of 78.9% (95% CI: 69.0, 86.8), which compares favourably with other approved therapies. CR 
induced by mosunetuzumab was demonstrated to be sustained. In patients who achieved a CR as the 
best response, it was estimated that 80.1% (95% CI: 67.4, 92.7) maintained their response at 12 
months after the first response. 
The sponsor has provided table overviews of indirect comparisons to currently authorised medicinal 
products such as the PI3K inhibitors Zydelig (idelalisib) and Copiktra (duvelisib), the anti-CD20 
containing regimens MabThera (rituximab) plus Revlimid (lenalidomide), and Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab) 
plus bendamustine, and bendamustine in monotherapy. The data for these therapies were selected to 
support the claim for significant benefit as they were granted full approval in the EU for treatment of 
adult patients with r/r FL after at least two prior systemic therapies (see the tables below). Of these 
medicinal products, only the combination treatment with Revlimid plus rituximab is considered a 
satisfactory method of treatment for the target FL population for mosunetuzumab. In addition, Zevalin 
is another treatment method considered relevant for a discussion on the significant benefit of 
Lunsumio in r/r FL patients after two or more lines of systemic therapy. A descriptive comparison to 
Zevalin was also provided.

The rituximab-lenalidomide regimen was investigated in two phase 3 studies (the AUGMENT study and 
the ongoing MAGNIFY study) which enrolled earlier line, less heavily pre-treated, and less refractory 
patients, making the patient populations and efficacy results in these studies less comparable to those 
reported for mosunetuzumab in study GO29781. Between these two phase 3 studies, the MAGNIFY 
study allowed enrolment of rituximab-refractory patients (47%) while AUGMENT excluded rituximab-
refractory patients. The sponsor therefore considered the study results from MAGNIFY to be a better 
comparator for study GO29781, which enrolled 79% of patients who were refractory to prior anti-
CD20-directed therapy. In MAGNIFY, the ORR was 54% and the CR rate was 14% for the rituximab-
lenalidomide regimen in the subpopulation of patients with r/r FL who had received at least 2 prior 
therapies. The median duration of response (DOR) was 5.1 months (95% CI: 2.3, 8.5). The sponsor 
noted that the efficacy of mosunetuzumab compares favourably to that reported for this regimen with 
higher response rates and longer DOR in a more refractory patient population, which is supported.

Descriptive comparison to the radioimmunotherapy Zevalin (ibritumomab) 
Ibritumomab is authorised in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with rituximab-relapsed or 
refractory CD20+ follicular B-cell NHL (Zevalin SmPC) and may represent an effective treatment 
approach in elderly patients with comorbidities not appropriate for chemotherapy.  
In the pivotal single-arm phase 2 study 106-06 conducted in 54 patients with relapsed FL who were 
refractory to rituximab, an ORR of 74% (95% CI: 60, 85) and a CR rate of 15% (95% CI: 7, 27) were 
observed in response to treatment with ibritumomab. A median DOR of 6.4 months and a median time 
to progression (TTP) of 6.8 months was shown (Zevalin SmPC; Witzig et al., 2007). The FL patients in 
this study had received a median of 4 (range: 1-9) prior regimens. Another phase 3 randomized study 
compared ibritumomab (n=73, 55 with FL) versus rituximab (n=70) in rituximab-naïve patients with 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

r/r low-grade or follicular NHL or transformed B-cell NHL. The ORR was significantly higher for patients 
treated with ibritumomab (80% versus 56%, p=0.002). The duration of CR and time to progression, 
however, were not significantly different between the two treatment arms, not in the overall patient 
population, nor in the FL subgroup (Gordon et al., 2004). 
Because of bone marrow depletion, haematological toxicity has been very commonly observed with 
ibritumomab and is dose-limiting. Due to this risk, ibritumomab is contraindicated in patients with 
>25% of the bone marrow infiltrated by lymphoma cells, or prior external beam radiation affecting 
more than 25% of active bone marrow, or decreased platelet counts or neutrophil counts, or those who 
had prior bone marrow transplant or stem cell support. The use of ibritumomab is also associated with 
an increased risk of secondary malignancies, including acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic 
syndrome (Zevalin SmPC). 
The sponsor concluded that the sustained CR rate and ORR combined with an acceptable safety profile 
as observed in the patient population from the pivotal B11 expansion cohort in study GO29781 support 
a favourable benefit-risk profile for mosunetuzumab in r/r FL patients after ≥2 prior therapies and 
demonstrate a clinically meaningful advantage over currently available therapies in the EU. 
It is agreed that the data provided indicate improved and sustained responses in patients treated with 
mosunetuzumab compared to authorised therapies for r/r FL in the third- and later lines setting, 
including the satisfactory methods of treatment lenalidomide in combination with rituximab, and 
ibritumomab. The CRR observed for mosunetuzumab in GO29781 was almost 4 times higher than 
those reported in the pivotal study 106-06 for ibritumomab and in the MAGNIFY study for rituximab 
and lenalidomide (58% vs. 15% and 14%, respectively). The ORR for mosunetuzumab was 
comparable to that reported for ibritumomab (79% vs. 74%), but higher than for the rituximab-
lenalidomide regimen (79% vs. 54%). The DOR observed for mosunetuzumab was also more durable 
than those reported for both ibritumomab and the rituximab-lenalidomide regimen (not reached for 
mosunetuzumab after a median follow-up of 10.7 months, median 6.4 months for ibritumomab, and 
median 5.1 months for rituximab plus lenalidomide) in patients with r/r FL. In addition, the patients 
enrolled in the MAGNIFY study appeared to have a better prognosis than those enrolled in study 
GO29781. 
In summary, the indirect comparisons of clinical efficacy data presented provide adequate evidence to 
support the claim for significant benefit of mosunetuzumab based on improved efficacy in terms of 
higher and more durable responses as compared to treatment with lenalidomide (Revlimid) plus 
rituximab and Zevalin in patients with r/r FL who have received at least two prior lines of systemic 
therapy.

4.  COMP position adopted on 29 April 2022 
The COMP concluded that: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of follicular lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4.8 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to lymphadenopathy, 
splenomegaly, bone marrow dysfunction, and the potential of transformation to aggressive 
lymphoma; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Lunsumio may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor provided clinical data that demonstrated 
improved and sustained response rates after treatment with Lunsumio as compared to treatment 
with Revlimid plus rituximab and Zevalin in patients with relapsed and refractory follicular 
lymphoma who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Lunsumio, mosunetuzumab for 
treatment of follicular lymphoma (EU/3/21/2517) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

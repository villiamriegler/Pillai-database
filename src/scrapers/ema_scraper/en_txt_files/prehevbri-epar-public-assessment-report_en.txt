2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
HBV infection causes a broad spectrum of disease severity from subclinical self-limiting infections to 
fulminant hepatitis or chronic infection. Up to 50% of adults develop symptomatic icteric hepatitis, 
which is characterized by fatigue, fever, anorexia, and jaundice. Acute HBV infection can develop into a 
chronic disease. The likelihood that HBV infection becomes chronic is age-dependent. While infants 
infected with HBV in the first year of life almost universally develop chronic infection, 
immunocompetent adults develop chronic hepatitis at a rate of 5-10%. Immunosuppressed individuals, 
including those with diabetes and older adults are at an increased risk of developing chronic HBV. In 
adults, while acute HBV symptoms are typically transient and self-limiting, among those who become 
chronically infected with HBV, 20-30% will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer.
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention
Transmission
HBV is highly transmissible, and is 50-100 more infectious than the human immunodeficiency Virus. 
Main modes of transmission are by exposure of mucosal membranes or dermal lesions to infected 
blood or body fluids (saliva, sperm, vaginal fluids). HBV infection can occur during birth, from an 
infected mother to her baby and or by sharing toothbrushes, razors, percutaneous instruments 
(needles, syringes) or having sexual contact with an infected individual.
Epidemiology
Recent estimates of the number of people chronically infected with HBV have ranged from 240 million 
to 350 million globally, with more than two billion humans ever having been infected. In the United 
States (US), though it is estimated that approximately 850,000 people are chronically infected with 
HBV, the actual number may be as high as 2.2 million, due to incomplete disease surveillance for viral 
hepatitis. It is estimated that 4.7 million people living in the European Union (EU) and the European 
Economic Area (EEA) countries are chronically infected with the HBV. Of the cases reported in Europe 
in 2017 (at a rate of 7.2 per 100 000 population), 15,472 (58%) were chronic. Notification rates varied 
by country, ranging from <0.1 per 100,000 population in Romania to 18.0 per 100,000 population in 
Iceland, with the United Kingdom (UK) reporting 62% of all chronic cases. The geographical variation 
likely reflects differences in local testing and reporting practices as well as underlying epidemiological 
differences.
Globally, liver cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths. Over half of which 
are the result of chronic HBV. Incidence rates for liver cancer among Americans have increased 38% 
from 2003 to 2012, and liver-cancer related deaths have increased 56% from 2003 to 2012. In 
Europe, 28% of liver cancer cases have been attributed to chronic HBV infection. It is estimated that 
one fifth of the cases of HBV associated cirrhosis and liver cancer is caused by HDV. The higher rates 
of comorbid conditions in older individuals are likely to increase the risk of complications from both 
acute HBV infection and chronic liver disease, thus altering the clinical manifestation of HBV disease in 
this population.
Hepatitis B screening
Assessment report 
Page 9/83
 
Most international guidelines recommend that several high-risk groups be screened for HBsAg, and 
that those at risk and not immune should be offered hepatitis B vaccination.
Guidelines recommend that persons at high risk for HBV infection should be screened. For example, 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated 2008 guidelines recommend testing 
injection drug users, men having sex with men, persons needing immunosuppressive therapy, 
including chemotherapy, immunosuppression related to organ transplantation, and immunosuppression 
for rheumatologic or gastro-enterologic disorders. The recommendation also includes persons with 
elevated ALT/AST of unknown aetiology, donors of blood, plasma, organs, tissues, or semen, all 
pregnant women, infants of HBsAg-positive mothers. Moreover, household, needle-sharing, or sex 
contacts of persons known to be HBsAg positive, and HIV-positive persons should be screened.
HBV has three antigens (surface, core, and e), some of which can be detected in the blood. The body’s 
immune response produces antibodies tailored to each type of antigen (surface antibody, core 
antibody, and e antibody), which can also be detected from a blood test. The basic blood test for 
hepatitis B consists of the following three screening tests. A hepatitis B surface antigen test determines 
whether a person currently has the infection. A hepatitis B core antibody test determines whether a 
person has ever been infected, and a hepatitis B surface antibody test determines whether a person 
has cleared the virus after infection, or has been vaccinated and is now immune to future infections.
Prevention and unmet need
Recombinant DNA-derived vaccines against HBV have been available for more than two decades. The 
primary hepatitis B immunization series conventionally consists of three doses of vaccine. Vaccination 
of infants and, in particular, delivery of hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth is 90–95% effective 
in preventing infection with HBV as well as decreasing HBV transmission if followed by at least two 
other doses. WHO recommends universal hepatitis B vaccination for all infants, and that the first dose 
should be given as soon as possible after birth. 
In the EU, the recommendations for adult HBV vaccination reflect regional differences in the hepatitis B 
vaccination program, which depend on the epidemiology of HBV in the region and logistic 
considerations and are largely based on targeted risk-group vaccination strategies. Adults who were 
not immunized as children remain at risk of becoming infected with HBV. Up to 10% of all adults fail to 
achieve seroprotective levels of antibodies against HBV (i.e. anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL) with a three-dose 
schedule of conventional HBV vaccines, and are considered “non-responders” to hepatitis B 
vaccination. 
In addition to age and genetic factors, other factors are known to be associated with reduced 
immunogenicity of HBV vaccines in adults, including obesity, diabetes, smoking, and concomitant 
disease.
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis
Viral hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting from infection with a hepatitis virus. The 
pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of hepatitis B are due to the interaction of the virus and the 
host immune system, which leads to liver injury and, potentially, cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma.
Assessment report 
Page 10/83
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis
Hepatitis B signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis B may include abdominal pain, fever, loss of 
appetite, nausea, vomiting, weakness and fatigue, and jaundice. The diagnostic includes serological 
testing, liver ultrasound, and liver biopsy. It is not possible, on clinical grounds, to differentiate 
hepatitis B from hepatitis caused by other viral agents, hence, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis 
is essential. The basic blood test for hepatitis B can determine whether a person currently has the 
infection, has ever been infected, has cleared the virus after infection, or has been vaccinated and is 
now immune to future infections. Acute HBV infection is characterized by the presence of HBsAg and 
immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to the core antigen, HBcAg. During the initial phase of infection, 
patients are also seropositive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). HBeAg is usually a marker of high 
levels of replication of the virus. The presence of HBeAg indicates that the blood and body fluids of the 
infected individual are highly infectious. Chronic infection is characterized by the persistence of HBsAg 
for at least 6 months (with or without concurrent HBeAg). Persistence of HBsAg is the principal marker 
of risk for developing chronic liver disease and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) later in life.
HBV infection causes a broad spectrum of disease severity from subclinical self-limiting infections to 
fulminant hepatitis or chronic infection. Up to 50% of adults develop symptomatic icteric hepatitis. The 
likelihood that HBV infection becomes chronic is age-dependent. While infants infected with HBV in the 
first year of life almost universally develop chronic infection, immunocompetent adults develop chronic 
hepatitis at a rate of 5-10%. Immunosuppressed individuals, including those with diabetes and older 
adults are at an increased risk of developing chronic HBV. Among those who become chronically 
infected with HBV, 20-30% will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer.
2.1.5.  Management
There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B. Therefore, care is aimed at maintaining comfort 
and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Most important is the avoidance of unnecessary medications. 
Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with antiviral agents. Treatment can slow the progression 
of cirrhosis, reduce incidence of liver cancer and improve long term survival.
2.2.  About the product
PreHevbri is a recombinant, alum-adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine, produced by expression of the Pre-
S1, Pre-S2 and S protein components of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) in Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. PreHevbri was developed with the aim to produce a more immunogenic 
HBV vaccine, that would be better able to elicit an adequate immune response against HBV in those 
individuals with poor or delayed responses to the current second-generation yeast-derived HBV 
vaccines. Antigens from current licensed Hepatitis B vaccines are expressed in yeast host cells, 
whereas the antigens of PreHevbri are expressed in CHO mammalian cells. In contrast to yeast cells, 
CHO mammalian cells secrete HBV particles that resembles the naturally occurring HBV particles in 
terms of protein composition, glycosylation pattern and harbour all antigenic epitopes and domains of 
the HBV envelope which are present in PreHevbri. These characteristics  may contribute to more 
conformationally appropriate presentation of the immunogenic epitopes to the immune system. 
For use in adults, PreHevbri is presented as a sterile suspension for intramuscular [IM] injection in 1.0 
mL single-dose vials, with each vial containing 10 μg/mL HBsAg with aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3] 
0.5 mg/mL as an adjuvant.
Assessment report 
Page 11/83
 
2.3.  Quality aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
The finished product (“PreHevbri”) is presented as 1 mL sterile suspension for intramuscular injection 
containing 10 µg of hepatitis B surface antigens (S [83%], pre-S1 [11%] and pre-S2 [6%])) as active 
substance, adsorbed on 500 µg of Al3+ as aluminum hydroxide, hydrated. 
Other ingredients are: sodium chloride, potassium chloride, disodium phosphate dodecahydrate, 
potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), hydrochloric acid (for pH 
adjustment), water for injections.
The product is available in single-dose glass vial, fitted with a rubber stopper and sealed with an 
aluminum seal with a plastic coloured flip-off top.
2.3.2.  Active Substance
2.3.2.1.  General information
PreHevbri is a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine produced in mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) 
cells genetically modified to produce the hepatitis B virus envelope proteins, which include the small 
(S), middle (pre-S2) and large (pre-S1) hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg), representing the active 
substance. The manufacturing process yields particles with protein composition and glycosylation 
patterns that resemble wild type virions. 
The HBsAg theoretical amino acid sequences were provided. Total amino acid analysis, N-terminal 
sequencing and determination of the primary protein structure were conducted in order to obtain 
confirmation of the bulk HBsAg structure. The individual surface antigens consist of 226 (S), 281 (pre-
S2) and 399 (pre-S1)  amino acids, respectively, and occur in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated 
forms. The hepatitis B surface antigen proteins are covalently linked to each other by intermolecular 
disulfide bonds between the S domains and are partially embedded in the membrane lipids, creating 
virus like particles that are approximately 30 nm in diameter. 
The lipid composition of the HBsAg consists of phosphatidylcholine (PCs), low levels of 
phosphatidylethanolamine (PEs), phosphatidylinositol (PIs), lysophosphatidylcoline (LPC), 
lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and possible traces of free cholesterol. The secondary structure of 
recombinant HBsAg active substance was investigated using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and 
has been confirmed to be predominantly alpha-helical.
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
SciVac Ltd. (Rehovot, Israel) is the only site involved in manufacturing of the HBsAg Drug Substance. 
Quality control testing is conducted at SciVac Ltd., as well as at external GMP compliant laboratories.
The active substance is manufactured, packaged, stability tested and quality-control tested in 
accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP).
Description of manufacturing process and process controls
The active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. The manufacturing 
process is divided in upstream and downstream processes. Main steps are cell propagation, inoculation 
Assessment report 
Page 12/83
 
in the bioreactor, harvest of the HBsAg-containing media, concentration of media harvest and HBsAg 
purification. 
The upstream manufacturing process starts with thawing and expansion of cells from WCB for 
bioreactor inoculation, followed by the bioreactor growth phase and HBsAg production and harvest of 
the media. The cells are grown in successively larger flasks to confluence until the bioreactor is 
seeded. The cells are then inoculated into the bioreactor and grown until specified conditions, which 
favour product accumulation over cell growth, are reached. Production phase starts at predefined 
thresholds, during which the culture medium and bioreactor operating conditions (e.g. pH, 
temperature, perfusion rate, etc.) are adjusted. The harvest is collected in harvest bags.
The downstream manufacturing process includes HBsAg harvest clarification, up-concentration and 
(dia-) filtration of the media harvest, followed by two consecutive protein purification steps and viral 
inactivation. A terminal sterile filtration step is conducted to obtain the purified bulk active substance. 
There are no reprocessing steps during active substance manufacturing process.
The active substance manufacturing process has been adequately developed and the In-Process 
Controls (IPCs) are considered effective to monitor and confirm process consistency. Re-use of 
chromatographic columns has been clearly indicated where applicable and it is found acceptable. 
Process parameters and in-process tests are well defined and controlled within appropriate ranges as 
well as in-process test controlled by action limit or acceptance criteria. Typical process and maximum 
hold-times are stated and are considered acceptable.
Significant variations of the total HBsAg content at the different downstream process steps are 
proposed by the applicant, however this is considered acceptable based on batch data generated so 
far. Moreover, the applicant committed to re-asses the IPC limits following the collection of data of 20 
manufacturing scale purification batches tested with the new antigen quantification method by Q3 
2023 (Recommendation 1).
The batch size for the active substance depends on the bioreactor productivity, as well as purification 
yield. The batch numbering system is adequately presented in the dossier.
The container closure system for HBsAg bulk active substance consists of  type I glass bottles with a 
screw cap and a pouring ring. 
The bottles are stored with appropriate protection against light exposure.
Adequate specifications have been proposed for the container closure system. Both primary container 
and closure comply with relevant standards and are commonly used for pharmaceutical products. Prior 
to filling, the bottles are washed and sterilized using a validated autoclave cycle. 
Extractable studies on the biocontainer bags (used for holding growth medium, harvest material and 
concentrated harvest), on the 0.2 µm filter and on the active substance storage container were 
conducted by the applicant and demonstrated that there is no safety concern associated with their use. 
A justification for not conducting a leachable study for the active substance storage container was 
presented by the applicant and it was deemed acceptable, as there are no extractables identified above 
the analytical evaluation threshold or above levels that are considered to be harmful.
Overall, the active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable.
Control of materials
The raw materials, components, resins, filters, membranes, and container and closures used in the 
manufacture of HBsAg active substance were adequately described. All raw materials used in the 
upstream and downstream manufacturing processes are released for use based on testing against the 
Assessment report 
Page 13/83
 
relevant Pharmacopoeia specifications (compendial materials), in-house specifications (non-compendial 
materials) and on review of documentation provided by the vendors of the materials such as Certificate 
of Analysis (CoA) and, for materials of animal origin, documentation on the country of origin. The 
control testing applied to the raw materials is considered appropriate.
The DNA sequence encoding for the S, pre-S2, and pre-S1 HBsAg proteins was derived by recombinant 
DNA technology from a naturally occurring hepatitis B viral (HBV) gene. The HBsAg expression vector 
was used to transfect the chosen CHO cell line and stable integrants (clones with the expression vector 
DNA integrated into the host genome) were selected. A suitable strain was selected for further 
subcloning and final generation of the HBsAg-producing strain, secured in form of a pre-master cell 
bank, was used to prepare master and working cell banks. Therefore, the cloning strategy, the 
construction of the expression vector and the generation of a stably transfected CHO cell line, 
overexpressing the three hepatitis B envelope surface antigens, has been adequately described. The 
genetic stability of cell banks and the production cell line was confirmed. Cell Bank characterization for 
MCB and WCB is considered sufficient to ensure consistency.
The MCB and the WCB intended for commercial manufacture were prepared in 1993 and 1998, 
respectively, at the Rehovot site which is no longer involved in the manufacture of PreHevbri. During 
assessment, a major objection was raised concerning the availability of documents supporting the GMP 
status of the WCB used for commercial manufacturing. To demonstrate GMP compliance of the MCB 
and WCB#2 cell banks, the applicant presented a history of approved Marketing Authorisations 
involving manufacture at the site including manufacture of Bio-Hep-B ( previous name for the same 
recombinant hepatitis B vaccine). Furthermore, a variety of documents, including GMP certificates, has 
been provided to substantiate GMP compliance. Additionally, the applicant has re-tested its WCB#2 
according to ICH Q5A, ICH Q5D and Ph. Eur. 5.2.3 cell bank standards. All test results met the 
acceptance criteria of the specification and supported the safety, identity and quality of the WCB#2. 
Overall, the response provided sufficient evidence to support that WCB#2 can be considered GMP 
compliant and safe, and therefore acceptable for use in commercial manufacture. 
An end of production cell bank (EoPCB) is routinely prepared from cells following termination of the 
bioreactor run on a periodic basis. Each batch of EoPCB is tested to show continued control of the cell 
line. The EoPCB testing program was updated upon request during assessment and is considered 
acceptable.
Protocol for the establishment of future WCBs and EoPCBs was provided and assessed as acceptable. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the HBsAg active substance manufacturing process were given. Acceptable information has 
been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance 
manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-
process tests. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. There are no isolated intermediates in 
the manufacturing process of the active substance. Hold-times for in-process materials are adequately 
defined. 
Process validation
The active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. 
The upstream manufacturing process validation is being supported by a retrospective continuous 
process validation study gathering 16 harvest batches and data has been shown that the process is 
reliable, robust, reproducible and adequately controlled. 
Assessment report 
Page 14/83
 
For the downstream manufacturing process validation, a process performance qualification (PPQ) study 
has been conducted, using 3 consecutive active substance commercial batches. All acceptance criteria 
for the critical operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests were 
fulfilled, demonstrating that the purification process consistently produces active substance of 
reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance 
criteria. 
The process is maintained in a validated state by continued process verification which will be assured 
by continued monitoring and trending of process parameters, in-process tests, critical quality attributes 
(CQAs) and release data. 
Shipping validation was not necessary as both active and finished product are manufactured in the 
same building. The life cycle studies presented support multiple uses of the chromatography columns 
and membrane filtration system in downstream manufacturing processes. The applicant discussed 
occurring deviations in the specification of the specific productivity during CHO cell incubation. It can 
be concluded that these deviations are not expected to have any effect on product quality. 
Manufacturing process development
Development history was presented in an adequate manner covering sufficient information of all 
processes and all changes introduced in the active substance manufacturing process. The changes in 
the process were evaluated with various combined validation/comparability studies and demonstrate 
that there is no significant influence on the quality of the product. Data obtained throughout 
development for input materials, manufacturing process parameters and IPCs were discussed and 
CQAs are defined in line with requirements. An acceptable risk assessment of the CQAs was performed, 
ranking CQA based on potential clinical impact and uncertainty.
The initial development of the manufacturing process was designated as manufacturing process A. The 
availability of data from the initial manufacturing process development studies performed by the 
previous manufacturer (BTG, Israel) are limited. In 2007, the active substance and finished product 
manufacture were transferred from BTG to SciVac Ltd. facility located in Rehovot, Israel. The process 
that was transferred and validated by SciVac is denoted as Process B. Differences between Process B 
and Process A consist of facility related adaptations. For Process C, the purification process was 
replaced and implemented. This process was used to manufacture the clinical batches in support of this 
application, three primary stability batches and materials used to prepare the in-house reference 
standards. Minor optimizations concerning the viral inactivation step were implemented to the Process 
C (Process denoted C+), which is the current manufacturing process of HBsAg active substance. With 
these changes, process qualification including extended characterization testing and virus 
removal/inactivation validation were performed and are considered acceptable. 
Characterisation
A detailed characterisation of the HBsAg active substance was presented and included analysis of 
primary and higher order structures, as well as characterisation of the HBsAg particles, by 
physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art methods. A characterization of process- and product-
related impurities was also provided. Several outliers of particles with higher diameter was observed in 
one batch, as well as lipid content of a batch, which has been sufficiently discussed in terms of 
identity, cause and impact. For analysis of amino acid sequence, incomplete amino acid coverage to 
the reference sequence is reported. Nevertheless, the applicant presented a discussion on the potential 
cause impact of the incomplete coverage of the peptide mapping to the reference sequence. Although 
the overall coverage obtained in the historical 2007-2008 manufacturing campaigns was 88.5%, the 
coverage increased to 94.5% due to the additional twenty-four amino acids identified for the four 
active substance batches manufactured from 2017 to 2020. The justification is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report 
Page 15/83
 
An analysis of the ratio of glycosylated versus non-glycosylated antigens on different batches has been 
provided, showing consistent glycosylation. 
In summary, the characterization is considered appropriate for this type of molecule.
2.3.2.1.  Specification
The HBsAg active substance release specifications are defined based on manufacturing experience, 
pharmacopoeial standards and statistical analysis of lot release data. In principle, release tests have 
been chosen adequately for this type of active substance. Parameters covered include: appearance, 
protein content, antigen identity, antigen content, antigen purity, relative amounts of surface antigens, 
pH, carbohydrate content, lipid content, residual DNA, HCP (Host Cell Protein) impurities, BSA (Bovine 
Serum Albumin) impurities, residual formaldehyde, bacterial endotoxins and sterility.
Comprehensive justification of specification limits for parameters stated in the active substance 
specification is provided. Introduction of an additional test for determining the antigen content for the 
active substance (in accordance to Ph. Eur. 1056), maintaining of lipid content determination as part of 
the release specification and tightening of several specifications (in particular for protein content, pH 
and Pre-S2 content) were requested during assessment.
In summary, the proposed tests panel and acceptance criteria for batch release testing are considered 
adequate.
Analytical methods
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
The antigenicity of HBsAg (defined as the ratio of antigenic HBsAg and total protein content in HBsAg 
active substance) is determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For the 
determination of the relative amounts of HBsAg components, fluorescent labelling of the cysteine 
residues in the shared S protein sequence is performed. The labelled active substance is then subject 
to SDS-PAGE and the labelled protein components are visualized on the gel and their fluorescence 
intensity is measured.
Batch analysis
The applicant provided batch data (n=32), including 3 PPQ lots as well as representative historical lots, 
manufactured in different buildings and using different processes. All batches meet the specifications in 
place at the time of release, indicating consistent quality of the active substance. No apparent trend or 
shift in analytical results between PPQ lots and historical lots presented is identified. The results are 
within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.
Reference materials
The applicant has established a qualification program for primary and secondary in-house reference 
standards for the active substance, in compliance to the requirements set in the Ph. Eur. monograph 
1056 for recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccines. As described in ICH Q6B, a tier-based strategy for 
establishing and maintaining HBsAg primary and secondary in-house reference materials has been 
developed. The HBsAg primary reference material was used to manufacture a clinical material and was 
fully characterized by an array of biochemical and biophysical techniques. The primary reference 
material may be used in routine release and stability testing. Secondary reference materials are 
calibrated against the primary material and are also adequately characterized. The in-house reference 
materials were qualified using the HBsAg active substance release specifications and additional 
Assessment report 
Page 16/83
 
characterization tests. The qualification of present and future in-house primary and secondary 
reference standards is sufficiently described.
2.3.2.2.  Stability
The HBsAg active substance stability program was established according to the ICH guidelines. The 
active substance shelf-life is claimed for storage at 5±3°C, in the designated container closure system. 
Stability data have been provided for long-term 5±3°C and accelerated 25±2°C (60±5% RH) 
conditions. 
The analytical methods and acceptance criteria applied during stability studies are identical to the 
active substance release specifications, except for the limits assigned to one test parameter. In 
addition, it was requested during assessment that characterization tests for particle size and density 
need to be included in the active substance post-approval stability program, until sufficient batch data 
will become available. 
The containers used for the active substance stability evaluation are Duran bottles, being significant 
smaller than the ones used for the actual manufacturing process, but otherwise identical. However, 
because the active substance volume to air ratio in the smaller containers used for the stability 
samples might not reflect the exact conditions for routine storage of commercial batches, the applicant 
committed to adjust the storage conditions for stability testing of the active substance as a post-
approval stability commitment, which is endorsed. 
Due to an observed downward trend of a test parameter when stored under long-term storage 
conditions, tightening of the active substance shelf-life was requested during assessment. The 
proposed shelf-life is supported by data generated from three primary batches, studied for at least 18 
months at 5±3°C, as well as from active substance batches which were already used to manufacture 
finished product lots (for which stability is shown for 36 months at 5±3°C) and historical production 
batches supporting the changes throughout manufacturing process development. With the exception of 
one OOS (out-of-specification) event, all test criteria met the previously defined acceptance criteria for 
stability testing at 5±3°C. It can be assumed that the OOS occurred was due to an inherent 
characteristic of the bulk active substance with no influence on the quality.
Accelerated stability data from the studies conducted on the primary batches suggest that short-term 
temperature excursions up to 25°C (i.e. time out of refrigeration) that may be encountered during 
storage will not impact active substance quality.
Stability studies were also conducted under heat-forced degradation (45±2°C, 60±5% RH) and under 
light exposure stress conditions. The results from the forced degradation study demonstrate that the 
methods included in the stability program are stability indicating. Active substance quality attributes 
are affected following exposure to light, however all results were within the pre-defined acceptance 
criteria for the active substance stored both in primary and secondary packaging, demonstrating that 
they are adequate to protect the active substance from the light effect.
Adequate post-approval stability protocol information was presented and acceptable handling of any 
confirmed OOS was proposed. 
In conclusion, the stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the 
proposed shelf-life when stored at a temperature of 5±3°C, in the proposed container.

2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
The PreHevbri finished product is presented as a sterile aqueous suspension in a single-dose vial. Each 
single-dose of 1.0 ml contains a total of 10 μg/ml of the three included Hepatitis B antigens (S, pre-S1 
and pre-S2) adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3], with a final aluminum content of 0.5 mg/ml. 
The finished product appears turbid when mixed and forms a clear colorless supernatant and white 
precipitate upon settling. The vaccine is intended for intramuscular administration. 
The composition of the finished product was sufficiently described and contains beside HBsAg bulk DS, 
sodium chloride, potassium chloride, disodium phosphate dodecahydrate, potassium dihydrogen 
phosphate, aluminum hydroxide and water for injection.
All excipients are of pharmacopeial grade (Ph. Eur./USP), of non-animal origin and commonly used in 
parenteral formulations. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. No 
incompatibilities between HBsAg bulk active substance and the excipients used in the finished product 
formulation are reported in literature, thus no dedicated compatibility studies were deemed necessary. 
Moreover, the compatibility between the active substance and excipients is confirmed by the results of 
stability studies.
No overage of active substance to compensate for degradation during manufacture or shelf-life is 
required for PreHevbri finished product. The target fill volume is 1.1 ml ± 0.05 ml to ensure withdrawal 
of the nominal volume of 1.0 ml.
The primary packaging is a single-dose glass vial, fitted with a rubber stopper and sealed with an 
aluminum seal with a plastic coloured flip-off top. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
The original formulation development of PreHevbri was carried out by Bio-Technology General (Israel) 
Ltd. (BTG), the previous marketing authorization holder. The scientific rationale for the development of 
PreHevbri was to include additional hepatitis B antigen components, namely pre-S1 and pre-S2, in the 
formulation in order to increase vaccine immunogenicity and/or optimize vaccine performance in “non-
responders” to the common hepatitis B vaccines. As excipients, the initial vaccine formulation 
developed by BTG contained the adsorbent Aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) and thiomersal as a 
preservative. During the subsequent formulation development, the adsorbent component has been 
changed to aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] and thiomersal has been excluded. The present vaccine 
formulation intended for licensure is supported by the results from major recent clinical 
immunogenicity and safety trials. 
The applicant uses the same process designations (process A, process B, process C and process C+) 
for both active substance and finished product manufacturing process. Changes to the active substance 
manufacturing process may also have an impact on the quality attributes of the finished product and 
therefore the performed comparability exercises assessed both. 
The most recent change to the manufacturing process (for the establishment of process version C+) 
affecting vaccine finished product was the implementation of a new optimized filling line and the switch 
to “ready to fill” vials as final vaccine containers. 
Pharmaceutical development from the beginning up to present has been described adequately and 
changes introduced over time have been explained and justified. Altogether, the finished vaccine 
product development is deemed appropriate and the current finished product formulation, as well as 
Assessment report 
Page 18/83
 
the equipment and materials applied, are considered rationally designed and properly implemented for 
the intended purpose.
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls
The PreHevbri Drug Product (DP) is manufactured, filled, packaged and inspected and tested at the 
SciVac site in Rehovot, Israel,. Some additional testing is at external GMP compliant laboratories.
This manufacturing process is considered a straightforward process and consists of the sterile filtration 
and mixing of the individual vaccine components in a defined order to produce the final formulated 
HBsAg bulk. Next, the formulated bulk is filled into the single-dose vials, which are capped and 
crimped immediately after filling. Visual inspection of 100% of the vials in each PreHevbri finished 
product batch is conducted. The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail in the 
dossier. During assessment, concerns were raised regarding several measurement excursions and the 
implementation of holding times, however these have been adequately addressed by the applicant and 
are considered resolved. 
The intended batch size for each formulated bulk finished product batch has been described. Up to 
three HBsAg bulk active substance batches may be blended to prepare a single formulated finished 
product batch. The batch numbering system is adequately presented in the dossier.
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate. All operational steps included in the current finished product 
manufacturing process have been evaluated and included in the process validation. For the validation 
of the current process C+, three consecutive PPQ lots have been manufactured and analysed for 
compliance with specification and process parameters. The three PPQ batches met all product 
specifications and PPQ acceptance criteria, thus confirming the robustness and consistency of the 
manufacturing process.
The applicant proposes a continued process verification for the finished product manufacturing process, 
which includes continues monitoring and trending of all CQAs, critical process parameters (CPPs) and 
critical material attributes (CMAs) at minimum, using control charts, process capability index (Cpk) and 
other statistical methods. In addition, raw materials with the potential to cause process variability will 
also be monitored for their impact on process performance. Periodic reports will be produced, which is 
considered acceptable. 
Shipping validation studies have been presented. After licensure, PreHevbri finished product will be 
shipped from the SciVac manufacturing facility in Rehovot, Israel to EU for commercial distribution. The 
shipping strategy is adequately described and validated.
2.3.3.3.  Product specification
The finished product release specifications comprise tests for appearance, HBsAg identity, antigen 
purity, potency, aluminum content, adsorption degree, volume in container, bacterial endotoxins, pH, 
sterility and container closure integrity. 
These specifications are in line with Ph. Eur. Monograph 1056 requirements and ensure the appropriate 
and consistent quality of filled PreHevbri final vaccine batches. The justification of acceptance limits is 
considered acceptable as it is in line with Ph. Eur. requirements and reflects results from historical 
batches as well as from PPQ lots.
Assessment report 
Page 19/83
 
Revision of specifications was requested during assessment, in particular for introduction of an antigen 
purity test and introduction of an upper limit for potency testing in order to ensure continuous 
consistency in production, and further justification for non-inclusion of other tests. Overall, finished 
product acceptance criteria at release are considered acceptable.
The finished product has been characterised with respect to the presence of process related impurities, 
including formaldehyde, which is controlled at the level of active substance. For the presence of 
unadsorbed aluminum, extractables and leachables, a risk-based approach has been presented 
demonstrating all levels were within acceptable ranges. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. It was confirmed that the 
risk for any elemental impurities being present in the final vaccine is negligible.
An assessment of impurities resulting from the finished product itself during the manufacturing process 
or through shelf-life has not been conducted. Upon request, the applicant presented data that 
identified most of the product-related species and impurities. Additionally, the applicant presented 
long-term finished product stability data for the purity of several batches, demonstrating low levels of 
impurities throughout the proposed shelf-life. It can be agreed that product related impurities is low 
throughout the shelf-life.
During assessment, a major objection was raised to request for a risk evaluation concerning the presence 
of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. In response, a risk evaluation concerning the presence 
of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been  performed  (as  requested)  considering  all 
suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based  on  the  information  provided  it  is  accepted  that  no  risk  was 
identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  the  related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary.
Analytical methods
Analytical methods have been described in sufficient detail and non-compendial methods have been 
validated appropriately. Batch data provided confirm compliance of manufactured vaccine lots with the 
existing specifications.
Batch analysis
The applicant provided batch data (n=25), including 3 PPQ lots as well as representative historical lots, 
manufactured in different buildings and using different processes. All batches meet the specifications in 
place at the time of release, indicating consistent quality of the finished product. No apparent trend or 
shift in analytical results between PPQ lots and historical lots presented is identified. The results are 
within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.
Reference materials
In alignment with WHO recommendations product-specific primary and secondary in-house reference 
standards have been established from selected production lots. These lots have been comprehensively 
tested for relevant quality characteristics and stability-indicating parameters and are considered 
appropriate to be used as reference standards for the control of the finished product lots. The 
requalification test program for the reference standard beyond a time period of four years (end of 
shelf-life), will be tested for stability indicating parameters once every three months. The qualification 
of present and future in-house primary and secondary reference standards was sufficiently described.
Assessment report 
Page 20/83
 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product
The proposed finished product shelf-life is 36 months upon storage at 5±3°C. This shelf-life claim is 
supported by six primary stability finished product lots investigated for stability up to 48 months under 
long-term storage conditions (5±3°C). The active substance batches used for the manufacturing of 
these six finished product stability lots were manufactured using process C, but are still considered 
representative to the current manufacturing process C+ on the basis of the risk assessment performed 
by the applicant. Moreover, the six primary stability finished product lots were filled using the previous 
filling line and into vials procured from a different supplier which, in contrast to the vials used in the 
current process C+ (“ready-to-fill” vials), were washed with WFI and depyrogenated by dry heat at 
SciVac Ltd. prior to use. The characteristics of each vial type have been thoroughly compared and 
found to be almost identical. In order to exclude any adverse impact on the finished stability profile 
stability data collected on the finished product lots filled in previous vials are deemed suitable to 
support licensure of current process C+ vaccine finished product. Moreover, confirmatory stability 
studies of finished product lots filled in “ready-to-fill” vials, employing the three PPQ lots, are ongoing 
and will be completed according to the applicant’s post-approval stability commitment.
The same analytical methods and acceptance criteria used for the release of finished product were 
used for analysis of stability samples. Upon request, the applicant has included a test for particle size 
at the end of shelf-life at 36 months, to the real time stability plan for the PPQ batches.
All stability results remain within pre-determined specifications during the entire stability study 
demonstrating that the quality attributes are maintained. Further, in support of the current shelf-life 
claim, heat-forced degradation studies (at 45°±2°C) and a photostability study (conducted as per ICH 
guideline Q1B) have been conducted demonstrating that storage of the finished product filled in glass 
vials and packed in an opaque carton box (secondary packaging) are sufficient to protect it from 
adverse effects due to light.
Accelerated stability data at 25±2°C suggest that short-term temperature excursions (i.e. time out of 
refrigeration) that may be encountered during shipment or during fill/finish will not adversely impact 
product quality.
Adequate post-approval stability protocol information is presented and acceptable handling of any 
confirmed OOS is proposed. Furthermore, as part of the post-approval stability commitment, one 
finished product batch per year will be subjected to stability testing and evaluation for continuous 
stability monitoring.
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of PreHevbri finished product of 36 months and storage 
conditions (Store in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do not freeze. Store in the original package, in order 
to protect from light), as stated in the SmPC, are acceptable.
2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents
The PreHevbri manufacturing process contains two chromatography-steps and an intermediary 
chemical treatment for virus inactivation. No virus filtration step is introduced. Cell substrates and raw 
materials used during manufacture of PreHevbri are tested using validated methods according to the 
applicant’s internal policy to provide high confidence that extraneous agents are not present in the final 
product. The adventitious agent testing of the MCB, WCBs and EoPCB is considered acceptable. 
Upon request, the applicant has provided additional justification regarding retroviral clearance, 
together with a risk assessment including a calculation of the estimated number per dose of retroviral 
particles (potentially originating from the CHO cells). Moreover, reverse transcriptase (RT) activity is 
monitored routinely during the active substance manufacturing purification process, while a reduced 
Assessment report 
Page 21/83
 
hold-time for the concentrated harvest was introduced to prevent an aging process (which was shown 
to reduce the purification process performance). It was concluded that the risk of the presence of 
retroviral particles in the final product is therefore considered to be sufficiently mitigated.
No animal derived materials are used in the manufacturing process of the active substance and 
finished product, with the exception of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), used for cell cultivation, and Trypsin-
EDTA, used during the early stages of the upstream process for detachment of cells. Trypsin-EDTA is 
sourced from porcine (considered as a non TSE-relevant animal species) and is further subject to 
gamma irradiation at levels shown to provide significant inactivation of viruses and mycoplasma. FBS is 
sourced from Australia, which is a country considered to be free from Transmissible Spongiform 
Encephalopathies (TSEs) affecting animals, including Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and 
scrapie. Upon receipt at SciVac, FBS lots are tested as part of release process according to relevant 
monographs. In summary, the risk for TSE contamination is considered to be low for all raw materials 
used in production, cell line development, including the storage of the cell banks and raw material 
testing. Nevertheless, the applicant committed to implement a virus inactivation step for the FBS used 
for cell cultivation in routine commercial manufacturing by Q2 2023 (Recommendation 2). 
2.3.3.6.  GMO
N/A
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the PreHevbri active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.
During the evaluation procedure, two major objections were raised, and have been resolved 
throughout the procedure, the details of which are summarized below. 
The first major objection was raised to request for a risk evaluation concerning the presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. The requested risk evaluation has been provided by the 
applicant and it is therefore accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. 
A second major objection was raised later during the assessment, due to the unavailability of GMP 
certificates for the manufacturer employed in the preparation of MCB (1993) and WCB (1998) intended 
for commercial manufacture of PreHevbri, but which is no longer involved. As a response, the applicant 
has presented a history of approved medicinal products involving manufacture at that site, which 
includes manufacturing of a recombinant growth factor in which cell banks are use, as well as Bio-Hep-
B (previous name for the same recombinant hepatitis B vaccine), to demonstrate GMP compliance of 
the MCB and WCB#2 cell banks. Furthermore, a variety of documents, including GMP certificates, has 
been provided to substantiate GMP compliance. Additionally, the applicant has re-tested its WCB#2 
according to ICH Q5A, ICH Q5D, and Ph. Eur. 5.2.3 cell bank. All test results met the acceptance 
criteria of the specification and supported the safety, identity, and quality of the WCB#2. Overall, the 
response provided sufficient evidence to support that WCB#2 can be considered GMP compliant and 
safe, and therefore acceptable for use in commercial manufacture.
The requested risk assessment regarding possible retroviral contamination resulted in a negligible risk 
of having one infectious retrovirus particle in a dose, based on infection assay and TEM analyses 
calculations. Moreover, two recommendations have been agreed by the applicant in relation to the 
Assessment report 
Page 22/83
 
revision of IPC limits applied during active substance downstream manufacturing process and 
implementation of a virus inactivation step for the FBS used for cell cultivation.
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues having impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.
2.3.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following point for investigation:
1. The applicant is requested to re-asses the IPC limits following the collection of data of 20 
manufacturing scale purification batches tested with the new antigen quantification method by 
Q3 2023.
2. The applicant is requested to implement a virus inactivation step for the FBS used for cell 
cultivation in routine commercial manufacturing by Q2 2023.
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
The non-clinical development of PreHevbri comprises a series of single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity 
studies, a developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) study, and pharmacology studies. 
Assessment of the immunogenicity was additionally done as part of repeat-dose toxicity and DART 
studies. Only the DART study was carried out under GLP regulations. Earlier studies used the previous 
vaccine formulation (AlPO4, with thiomersal) and the remaining studies used the current vaccine 
formulation (Al(OH)3, without thiomersal).
2.4.2.  Pharmacology
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The primary pharmacodynamics studies have assessed the immunogenicity of individual anti-genic 
components of PreHevbri in Balb/C as well as in B10/S and B10/M mice, known to be less responsive 
to the S antigen. These studies were designed to determine anti-HBs humoral response to PreHevbri, 
in comparison with the yeast-derived recombinant HBV vaccines following i.p. administration. The 
suitability of rodent species for these studies was supported by their responsiveness to HBsAg.
In the original study conducted using the previous formulation (AlPO4, with thiomersal), the 
immunogenicity of PreHevbri was established in Balb/C mice showing dose-dependent seroconversion 
Assessment report 
Page 23/83
 
(at anti-HBs titer of ≥ 10 mIU/mL), with 100% at dose of 0.81 µg HBsAg after i.p. administration on a 
prime-boost schedule (a 30 days interval). Superior anti-HBs levels for PreHevbri versus a yeast 
derived hepatitis B vaccine was also evidenced. Similarly superior seroconversion response of 
PreHevbri to two other yeast derived hepatitis B vaccines was further shown in B10/S mice and B10/M 
mice.
Subsequently, the ability of the current formulation of PreHevbri to induce a strong immune response 
was established in another study in Balb/C mice that were dosed i.p. on Day 0 and Day 21. In this 
study, adjuvanted PreHevbri was found to elicit stronger responses than unadjuvanted PreHevbri or a 
yeast derived hepatitis B vaccine after one dose. One month after the second dose, adjuvanted 
PreHevbri produced 100% of seroconversion rate that was almost three times the seroconversion rate 
noted in unadjuvanted PreHevbri (37.5%). Thus, the benefit of the Al(OH)3 adjuvant in PreHevbri 
formulation was evidenced.
In addition, immunogenicity of the current vaccine formulation has also been demonstrated in rats as 
part of a repeat dose toxicity study and the DART study, after IM route of administration. In the 
repeated dose toxicity study, 100% and 70% seroconversion were observed for the 10 µg and 2 µg 
HBsAg dose level, respectively, when administered IM on a 3-dose schedule (Days 0, 14 and 28). The 
anti-HBs titers were 10-fold higher in the group vaccinated with 10 µg than for the group vaccinated 
with 2 µg HBsAg. In the DART study, female Sprague-Dawley rats immunized IM with PreHevbri (10 µg 
of HBsAg and 250 µg of Al(OH)3), on 30 and 15 days prior to mating and on GD 4 and 15, developed 
robust immuno-logical response in all animals receiving PreHevbri. This anti-HBs response persisted 
through the gestation and post-partum period, No anti-HBs were detected in the animals in the control 
groups administered placebo or placebo/adjuvant. Measurement of the anti-HBs levels in foetuses and 
offspring of mothers receiving PreHevbri showed that the circulating anti-HBs were transferred in 
utero.

2.4.4.  Toxicology
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity
A single-dose toxicity study was performed in rats to evaluate acute toxic effect of the old vaccine 
formulation. After IM injection with 5 µg HBsAg in the presence of AlPO4, animals were observed for 72 
hours. There were no vaccine-related effects on survival, clinical signs, body weight, clinical chemistry 
parameters, organ weight, and gross pathology and histopathology of selected organs.
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity
Two repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in rats to evaluate systemic adverse effects and local 
tolerance, one (IBR 9100.008) using the current vaccine formulation and the other (Weizmann Report 
1991) using the old vaccine formulation.
IBR 9100.008
This study, denoted as the main study, was conducted in order to evaluate the current vaccine 
formulation intended for marketing (Al(OH)3, without thiomersal). Although considered a non-GLP 
study, this study was noted to be performed in accordance with GLP principles, based on an audit of 
the animal unit and histology laboratory facilities, including the storage, handling and labelling 
procedures, as well as a review of study records and documentation and internal SOPs.
In this study, three groups of Wistar rats were dosed IM on Days 0, 14 and 28 with 0.5mL of PreHevbri 
(2 or 10 µg HBsAg per animal), or Al(OH)3 adjuvant alone, and were observed for signs of toxicity for 8 
weeks. Animals were sacrificed 2 days after the last dose (= 4-week time point) or at 8 weeks 
following recovery.
No mortality was observed in the study. There were no related effects on clinical signs, body weights, 
clinical chemistry or organ weights. Changes in haematologic parameters were limited to leukocytosis 
in individual animals in each group, which was considered related to the adjuvant. There were no 
vaccine-related adverse gross or microscopic pathologic findings observed at terminal necropsy other 
than isolated incidence of slight discrete lymphoid hyperplasia in the spleens and lymph nodes of the 
vaccine treated rats, which represented an expected immunostimulatory property of the vaccine. The 
analysis of the injection site at four weeks showed essentially a mononuclear cell infiltration with signs 
of myodegeneration and depositions of Al(OH)3 in all groups. These observations are commonly made 
after aluminum adjuvant injection. At eight weeks, the injection sites demonstrated focal and discrete 
mononuclear cell infiltration with small Al(OH)3 deposition.
Weizmann Report 1991
This study was performed early in the product's development. The study consisted of once daily IM 
dosing of CD-1 rats for 14 days with the previous vaccine formulation (AlPO4, with thiomersal), at 
0.04, 0.2 or 2 µg of HBsAg, AlPO4 adjuvant, or saline. There were no mortality and no related effects 
on clinical signs, haematology and clinical chemistry, gross pathology, organ weights, and 
histopathology. The only observation noted was the presence of peribiliar (and a few isolated findings 
of interstitial) mononuclear infiltrates in the liver. This observation, considered to be typical following 
adjuvant injection, was detected in all groups except for the saline-treated group.
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity
These studies were not performed for PreHevbri. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.
Assessment report 
Page 25/83
 
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity
These studies were not performed for PreHevbri. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity
A GLP-compliant embryo-fetal and pre/post-natal reproductive toxicity study was conducted with the 
current vaccine formulation of PreHevbri in female Sprague-Dawley rats. The PreHevbri dose contained 
10 µg HBsAg and 250 µg of Al(OH)3, delivered IM in a volume of 0.5 mL, split between two sites. Six 
groups of F0 rats received PreHevbri, placebo or placebo/adjuvant on 30 and 15 days prior to mating, 
and on gestation day (GD) 4 and GD 15 (Table 1). The study was divided into two arms: Groups 1-3 
comprised the embryofetal development arm (Caesarean sectioning groups), while Groups 4-6 
comprised the pre and post-natal development arm (natural delivery groups).
Parameters for evaluation during the study included viability, clinical observations, body weights, food 
consumption, mating, pregnancy status, and gross lesions. F0 rats were also evaluated for pregnancy 
rate, number of corpora lutea, live and dead foetuses, implantation sites, early and late resorptions 
and total resorptions, pre- and post-implantation losses, and gravid uterine weights; as well as for 
gestation index, the live birth index and litter size, live or dead pups.
All foetuses were sexed, weighed, and examined for external, internal or skeletal anomalies. F1 pups 
were evaluated for body weight, viability, survival and lactation indices, as well as for developmental 
performance including sensory, behavioural and functional assessments.
Blood samples for anti-HBs antibody analyses were collected from F0 dams, foetuses and F1 pups.
2.4.4.6.  Local Tolerance 
Local tolerance of PreHevbri given as three IM injections at two-week intervals was investigated in 
Wistar rats as part of the repeat-dose IM toxicity study IBR 9100.008 (see section 2.4.4.2).
2.4.4.7.  Other toxicity studies
No other toxicity studies were performed for PreHevbri. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
PreHevbri does not contain any genetically modified organism. The ingredients are not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. Therefore, in accordance with the guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use "EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00", no environmental risk 
assessment was performed.
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
The pharmacology studies clearly establish the immunogenicity of PreHevbri in immunized mice and 
rats. Regardless of the formulation evaluated, PreHevbri was found superior to yeast-derived 
recombinant HBV vaccines, following 2 doses of vaccines given i.p. in mice. The stronger anti-HBs 
antibody responses demonstrable for adjuvanted PreHevbri versus unadjuvanted PreHevbri justifies 
the inclusion of aluminium hydroxide in PreHevbri formulation.
Assessment report 
Page 26/83
 
The results of mice studies were generated for the i.p. route, which represents clear limitation of these 
studies. However, the conclusion that PreHevbri is immunogenic can be established from the rat 
toxicity studies, where the IM route was employed and a dose-response relationship was established.
The omission of secondary pharmacodynamic and safety pharmacology studies and of the 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies are in line with the applicable regulatory guidelines.
According to the Applicant, pharmacokinetic studies were not performed or required, as this vaccine is 
not considered a new vaccine (containing antigens that have been previously described in the 
European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.)). Moreover, its adjuvant (Al (OH)3) is not novel and the intended 
clinical route of administration (IM) is commonly used for commercial hepatitis B vaccines. This is in 
accordance with relevant regulatory guidelines (CPMP/SWP/465/95, WHO 2005, WHO 2014, ICH S6). 
Overall, it is supported that no pharmacokinetic studies are warranted with PreHevbri.
The description of the analytical methods used in the non-clinical programme provided during 
assessment was sufficient. Validated assays were employed for the mouse immunogenicity study and 
rat DART study. The general toxicity of PreHevbri was evaluated in single-dose and repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rats, however, not under the GLP conditions. According to current guidelines, pivotal 
toxicity studies should be conducted in compliance with GLP. The lack of GLP compliance was discussed 
in the Scientific Advice feedback provided by EMA in January 2019 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/25250/2019). 
The Applicant provided a clear justification for the absence of GLP for the pivotal 4-week repeat-dose 
toxicity study in rats and potential consequences of non-compliance. The study was considered to be 
reliable without restrictions. In addition, the Applicant stated that further GLP compliant studies were 
not considered scientifically justified in light of clinical experience with the vaccine (to date over 
760,000 neonates, children and adults have received the vaccine assuming that all individuals received 
the three-dose regimen) and are not warranted for ethical reasons (Guideline on the principles of 
regulatory acceptance of 3Rs)”. 
The CHMP considered that the main repeat-dose toxicity study did not include histology analysis of the 
full list of organs and tissues or assessment of reversibility of the microscopic changes in selected vital 
organs, and study groups were not adequately sized. Despite these limitations, the CHMP 
acknowledged that this main study was well documented, based on an audit of the animal unit and 
histology laboratory facilities, as well as a review of study records and documentation and internal 
SOPs. Together with availability of considerable human experience with PreHevbri, showing a safe and 
well-tolerated profile in varying age groups including infants, consistent with these nonclinical toxicity 
studies, the CHMP agreed that additional GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study with PreHevbri is 
not necessary. 
There were no studies on genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, which is in line with applicable guidelines.
A formal GLP-compliant developmental and reproductive toxicity study was performed in female rats. 
The suitability of rats as a model was demonstrated by collected immunogenicity data. There were no 
related maternal toxicities, based on mortality check, clinical observation and evaluations of the body 
weight, food consumption and gross pathology at necropsy. There were no related adverse effects on 
maternal performances, including, pregnancy rate, duration of parturition, pre and post implantation 
losses, gestation index, live birth index and litter size. In the natural delivery arm of the F0 generation, 
the gestation index was 100% in each group, and there were no related adverse effects on live or dead 
pups. In caesarean sectioning groups of the F0 generation, the pregnancy rate was comparable across 
groups and there were no total resorptions and no dams littered prior to caesarean section on GD 20.
With respect to foetal anomalies, the only findings were increased incidence of incomplete ossification 
of sternebrae (5-6) in foetuses from the PreHevbri group, and increased number of litters with 
incomplete ossification of the supra occipital bones in foetuses of the PreHevbri group, compared to the 
Assessment report 
Page 27/83
 
concurrent placebo control group. The Applicant considered them of no toxicological importance, since 
these findings were not associated with maternal toxicities or accompanied by decreases in foetal body 
weight. On request, the Applicant provided historical control data of the test facility for the test 
species, showing markedly lower rates of incomplete ossification of sternebra and supraoccipital bones 
than were observed in the placebo control group of the PreHevbri DART study. The Applicant ascribed 
this discrepancy to use of a more sensitive scoring technique in the PreHevbri DART study. Since 
incomplete ossification of the sternebrae and supraoccipital bones is common in rodents after 
Caesarean section on GD 20, which can be caught up with time, and that PreHevbri treatment did not 
adversely affect the prenatal increase of body mass and the F1 generation development, the CHMP 
agreed that the observed incomplete ossifications of sternebrae and supraoccipital bones in the 
PreHevbri group are likely a transient finding.
Regarding the physical and functional development of F1 pups, no PreHevbri related adverse effects 
were observed. However, there was slight but statistically significant decrease in the grip strength of 
hind limb in F1 pups of the PreHevbri group compared to controls, for which the relevance is difficult to 
interpret. The Applicant provided historical control data of the test facility, which showed markedly 
higher values for the grip strength of female hind limbs and also a high variability. 
A dedicated local tolerance study was not performed, which is acceptable, since local tolerance 
assessment was part of a repeat-dose toxicity study.
Overall, the non-clinical programme adequately supported the marketing authorization application for 
PreHevbri. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
The CHMP considered the vaccine approvable from a non-clinical perspective.
2.5.  Clinical aspects
2.5.1.  Introduction
GCP aspects
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics
No pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed for PreHevbri. This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
Anti-HBs assay
In the two pivotal Phase 3 studies (Sci B Vac 001 and Sci B Vac 002), the anti-HBs levels were 
measured using the validated CE-marked (CE-0459) VITROS anti-HBs quantitative assay at a central 
laboratory in the US. 
The immunoassay is based on measurement of chemiluminescence after antigen-antibody binding. 
The immunoassay was fully validated according to ICH M10 on bioanalytical method validation, 
including by use of calibrators referenced to the World Health Organization (WHO) 1st International 
Reference Preparation of anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulin.
Assessment report 
Page 30/83
 
In the supportive legacy adult studies, a number of commercially available anti-HBs platforms were 
used for quantitative measurement of immune response, all of which have demonstrated good 
sensitivity and specificity.
Dose response studies
In order to demonstrate dose response, three dose ranging studies in adults have been provided. In 
total, 245 healthy subjects were enrolled. Test-substance was the original vaccine with aluminium 
phosphate as an adjuvant and thimerosal as preservative. The studies were conducted inIsrael, 
Thailand, and Singapore. They were open-label, comprising two dose regimens, 5 and 10 µg. One had 
a preliminary phase 1 FIH part with a dosage up to 20 µg. The endpoint in each study was to achieve 
seroprotection, i.e. the defined antibody-titre of 10 mIU/ml or higher. The test vaccine was 
administered in a three consecutive dosage regimen.
In each of the studies, seroprotection as defined was achieved in the 10µg group in each participant 
within seven months, whereas in the 5µg group, the percentage was marginally lower. In contrast, the 
peak GMT-level that was reached at month seven was in all the three studies distinctly higher in the 
10µg group. That superiority is evident in the 10µg group during each of the conducted laboratory 
measurement at the 1, 2, 6, 7 and 12-month interval. Concomitantly, the 10µg dose regimen led 
faster to seroprotection.
Overall, the study results indicated a clear dose response relationship with an increased dosage of 10 
versus 5µg. Furthermore, the 10µg was superior with respect to both GMT as well as seroprotection. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
A pharmacokinetic evaluation was not performed, which is in line with the respective CHMP guideline 
CHMP/VWP/164653/2005. The pharmacodynamics evaluations were confined to three dose finding 
studies. They elucidated a clear relationship between the administered dosage of 5 versus 10 µg and 
the resulting antibody titre. The dosage of 10 µg has proven to be the most favourable under the 
aspect of the targeted defined immunogenic correlate of protection to achieve seroprotection (see the 
“Correlates of protection” outlined below). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The CHMP considered that all aspects dealing with clinical pharmacology have been well addressed by 
the Applicant.
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy
Correlates of protection
Anti-HBs is the only easily measurable correlate of vaccine induced protection using serologic assays. 
An anti-HBs concentration of 10 mIU/mL or more measured 1 to 3 months after administration of the 
last dose of the primary vaccination series is considered a reliable marker of protection against 
infection: in vaccine immunogenicity/efficacy studies, immunocompetent persons who developed anti-
HVs concentrations of 10 mIU/mL of higher after vaccination had virtually complete protection against 
both acute disease and chronic infection, even if subsequently, over time, anti HBs concentrations 
declined to less than 10 mIU/mL. Indeed, the protective efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination is related to 
the induction of anti- HBs antibodies, but it also involves the induction of memory-B and T cells. 
Therefore, vaccine-induced protection against HBV infection is defined as having an anti-HBs level of 
Assessment report 
Page 31/83
 
10 mIU/mL or higher, measured 1 to 3 months after receipt of a complete and adequately 
administered vaccination course. In immunocompromised patients who have ongoing exposure to HVB, 
annual anti—HBs testing is recommended, and booster doses are required to maintain anti-HBs 
concentrations of 10 mIU/mL or higher .
2.5.5.1.  Dose response studies
Dose response studies and their results are presented under section 2.5.2.2 Pharmacodynamics.
2.5.5.2.  Main studies
To support the authorisation of PreHevbri, two Phase 3 clinical studies (Sci B Vac 001 and Sci B Vac 
002) that compared PreHevbri to Engerix-B were conducted in Europe and North America to evaluate 
the immunogenicity, safety and manufacturing consistency of the adult 10 µg (10 µg HBsAg, Al(OH)3 
0.5 mg/mL without thimerosal) 3 dose regimen of PreHevbri. The comparator chosen for these phase 3 
trials, Engerix-B (20 µg HBsAg), is an approved standard-of-care HBV vaccine for the immunization of 
adults in Europe.
An overview of the 2 pivotal Phase 3 trials was summarized in Table 1.

Phase 3, Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial to Compare the 
Immunogenicity and Safety of a Three dose Regimen of PreHevbrito a 
Three-dose Regimen of Engerix-B in Adults (PROTECT)
Methods
 Study Participants
Male and female subjects, 18 years of age or older in stable health or with controlled chronic conditions 
who consented to participate were eligible for the study. The frailty index of subjects >65 years old 
was ≤3. Subjects who had received any hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine (licensed or experimental) 
previously were excluded. In addition, treatment by immunosuppressants within 30 days of enrolment, 
autoimmune diseases or secondary immunodeficiency disorder or primary immunodeficiency disorders 
were excluded.

Treatments
Vaccine administration
Study subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 3 IM injections of PreHevbri or Engerix-
B. The first was administered at Study Day 0, the second at Study Day 28 (at 4 weeks), and the third 
at Study Day 168 (at 24 weeks).
Blood sampling

Anti-HBs Assessments
Immunogenicity was assessed by measurement of anti-HBs levels at baseline, and at Study 
Days 28, 56, 168, 196, and 336.

Cell-mediated immunity
A small subset of subjects participating in the laboratory sub-study also participated in an 
optional sub study on cell mediated immunity. Subjects consenting to the cell-mediated 
immunity sub-study were required to provide an additional blood sample at V1 (Day 0) and at 
each of the additional visits (A1, A2, A3).
Anti-HBs Assessments
Immunogenicity was assessed by measurement of anti-HBs levels at baseline, and at Study Days 28, 
56, 168, 196 and 336.
 Objectives
Co-Primary:
•
To demonstrate that the seroprotection rate (SPR), 4 weeks after completion of the 3-dose 
regimen of PreHevbri, is non-inferior to the SPR 4 weeks after completion of the 3-dose 
regimen of Engerix-B in adults ≥18 years old i.e., the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the SPR in the PreHevbri arm minus the 
SPR in the Engerix-B arm, achieved 4 weeks after receiving the third vaccination, is > -5%
•
To demonstrate that the SPR, 4 weeks after completion of the 3-dose regimen of 
PreHevbri, is superior to the SPR 4 weeks after completion of the 3-dose regimen of 
Engerix-B in older adults ≥45 years old ie, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the 
difference between the SPR in the PreHevbri arm minus the SPR in the Engerix-B arm, 
achieved 4 weeks after receiving the third vaccination, is >5%

Secondary:
•
•
To determine whether the SPR after receiving 2 vaccinations of PreHevbri, evaluated at 4 
weeks and 20 weeks after receiving the second vaccination (just prior to receiving the third

To compare the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-
HBs), 4 weeks after receiving the first vaccination, the second vaccination and the third 
vaccination, 20 weeks after receiving the second vaccination (just prior to receiving the 
third vaccination), and 24 weeks after receiving the third vaccination with PreHevbri or 
Engerix-B

 Sample size
A total of 1564 participants were planned to be randomised. 
The study population is planned to be composed of 80% of subjects ≥45 years old and 20% of 
subjects 18-44 years old. The sample size calculation bases on the superiority analysis on subjects ≥
45 years of age (H2).
Assuming a SPR of 0.81 for Engerix-B and 0.96 for PreHevbri, a minimum of 540 subjects (270 per 
treatment group) is needed for a 90% power to demonstrate superiority of SPR with a 5% superiority 
margin and a significance level of 5% (two-sided). Based on the given sample size of 540 for subjects 
≥ 45 years, an additional 180 (20%) of 18-44 years old study subjects were planned to be required.
Assessment report 
Page 35/83
 
With an overall sample size of 680 the power is stated to be ≥90% to demonstrate non-inferiority if 
the PreHevbri SPR is 0.88, the Engerix-B SPR is 0.81, setting a two-sided alpha to be 0.05 and a non-
inferiority margin to be -5%. 
In order to have robust immunogenicity estimates, a total of 1564 subjects were planned to be 
enrolled. The total number of randomized subjects were 1607.
 Randomisation and Blinding (masking)
Patients were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to receive either 3 injections of PreHevbri 
or 3 injections of Engerix-B. Randomisation was stratified by study center and age (18-44 years, 45-64 
years, and ≥ 65 years). Randomization and treatment assignment were managed by an Interactive 
Web-based Response System (IWRS).
The study was planned as a double-blind study. 
 Statistical methods
Populations:
The All Enrolled Set was defined as all screened subjects who provided informed consent and provided 
demographic and/or baseline screening assessments, regardless of the subject’s randomization and 
treatment status in the study.
The ITT population is a subgroup of the All Enrolled Set, who were randomised. Subjects in the ITT 
population were analysed “as randomised”.
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all subjects of the All Enrolled Set who received at least one 
vaccination and provided at least one evaluable serum immunogenicity sample both at baseline and 
after baseline. Patients were analysed “as randomised”.
The PP set was defined as all subjects in the FAS who (i) received all 3 vaccinations, (ii) had an 
evaluable serum immunogenicity sample at baseline and at the time point of interest, (iii) were sero-
negative at baseline, and (iv) had no major protocol deviations leading to exclusion, which was 
planned to be identified prior to unblinding. Patients who received the wrong treatment were excluded 
from the PPS. 
The Safety Set was defined as is a subgroup of the All Enrolled Set, who received at least one dose of 
study vaccination. Subjects were analysed as vaccinated. In case of vaccination error, subjects were 
analysed as “treated”. 
The Clinical Laboratory Sub-Study Analysis Set (SSA 1) was defined as all subjects in the All Enrolled 
Set who actually receive at least on dose of study vaccination and participated in the clinical laboratory 
sub-study.
Analysis of Primary Endpoints:
The primary analysis was performed on seroprotection rate (SPR) four weeks after completion of the 
three-dose regimen. Seroprotection was defined as anti-HBs levels of ≥10 mIU/mL in serum and SPR 
was the percentage of subjects achieving seroprotection.
The two co-primary hypotheses that were tested in hierarchical order were defined as follows:
(1) H1: Non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B four weeks after the last vaccination on 
the PPS for the entire study population (>= 18 Years) with non-inferiority margin of -5%.
(2) H2: Superiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B four weeks after the last vaccination on the 
PPS for the entire study population (>= 45 Years) with superiority margin of 5%.
Assessment report 
Page 36/83
 
For testing hypothesis H1, non-inferiority was assessed using the PPS. Two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals for the difference in proportions [SPR(PreHevbri)-SPR(Engerix-B)] were conducted by 
Miettinen-Nurminen method. Non-inferiority was declared if the lower bound of the CI was greater than 
the non-inferiority margin of -5%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the FAS population, on 
patients with and without seropositive immunogenicity at baseline, and on the ITT set. Additional 
sensitivity analysis was performed using a Logistic Regression model by adjusting for age group.
For testing hypothesis H2, superiority was assessed using the FAS. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals 
for the difference in proportions were conducted by Miettinen-Nurminen method. Superiority was 
declared if the lower bound of the CI was greater than 5%. 
Statistical testing was performed in hierarchical order. 
For immunogenicity data, missing values were considered to be missing completely at random (MCAR), 
i.e., not informative. Therefore, each of the co-primary immunogenicity analyses were comprised a 
complete case analysis only, without introducing any bias. No imputation methods were planned.
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:
If the hypotheses of the primary analysis may be rejected the following hypotheses were planned to be 
tested in hierarchical order:
H3: Non-inferiority of PreHevbri 20 weeks after the second vaccination compared to Engerix-B 
four weeks after the third vaccination on the PPS for the entire study population ≥ 18 years).
H4: Non-inferiority of PreHevbri 4 weeks after the second vaccination compared to Engerix-B 
four weeks after the third vaccination on the PPS for the entire study population ≥ 18 years).
Non-inferiority was assessed with the same approach as for the primary hypotheses. Sensitivity 
analyses was performed as for the primary hypotheses.
Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints:
Exploratory immunogenicity endpoints were planned to be performed on the PPS. No adjustment for 
multiple testing was performed.
Adjusted estimates of geometric mean serum concentrations (GMCs) and their associated 95% CIs at 
Day 28, Day 56, Day 168, Day 196 and Day 336 were each planned to be determined using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with factors for treatment, age group, and a covariate for the 
log transformed pre-vaccination (baseline) titer. The difference in GMCs between the two
treatment groups, and associated two-sided 95% CIs were presented. All statistical analyses were 
planned on the logarithmically (base10) transformed values. The analyses were planned to be 
conducted for subjects age ≥ 18 years and for subjects age ≥ 45 years old.
Analysis of Safety Endpoints:
The analysis of the safety variables based on the Safety Set. Data of laboratory safety variables were 
calculated in the clinical laboratory sub-study analysis set (SSA 1). Numbers of adverse events and 
clinical laboratory tests were summarized using descriptive statistics.
Results
 Participant flow
A total of 1 607 subjects were randomized to PreHevbri (n=796) or Engerix-B (n=811). 
 Recruitment
Assessment report 
Page 37/83
 
A total of 2.472 subjects were screened for the study, of whom 865 failed screening. Thus, 1607 
subjects were randomized, including 796 subjects to the PreHevbri treatment arm and 811 subjects to 
the Engerix-B treatment arm. All randomized subjects received their assigned treatment. 
Most subjects in both treatment arms completed study treatment as planned, including 758 (95.2%) in 
the PreHevbri arm and 785 (96.8%) subjects in the Engerix-B arm. Early discontinuation from 
treatment was reported for 38 (4.8%) in the PreHevbri arm and 26 (3.2%) subjects in the Engerix-B 
arm. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation, contributing to the “other” category in 
was lost to follow-up (1.1% PreHevbri and 1.2% Engerix-B) followed by withdrawal of consent by the 
subject (1.0% PreHevbri and 0.6% Engerix-B). Treatment discontinuation due to non-serious AEs or 
SAE was uncommon, reported in 5 (0.6%) subjects in each treatment arm.
Overall, 756 (95.0%) in the PreHevbri arm and 769 (94.8%) subjects in the Engerix-B arm completed 
the study.
 Conduct of the study
One amendment was issued very early in the conduct of the trial before the first subjects was enrolled. 
Mainly exploratory endpoints clarification and exclusion criteria were better defined in the amended 
protocol.

Non-Inferiority of PreHevbri versus Engerix-B in Subjects ≥18 Years of Age at Study Day 196
Non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared with Engerix-B was assessed in all subjects ≥18 years of age by 
comparing the SPR induced by PreHevbri and Engerix-B at Study Day 196, 4 weeks after receiving the 
third vaccination. Results for the PPS analysis are presented in Table 5 below. Non-inferiority of 
PreHevbri as compared with Engerix-B at Study Day 196 in subjects ≥18 years of age was 
demonstrated and the co-primary endpoint was met.

Analyses were conducted to compare the SPR induced by PreHevbri and Engerix B within subgroups of 
age, sex, BMI, diabetic, smoking, alcohol consumption, concomitant receipt of any non-study licensed 
vaccines during the study, race, ethnicity, and country/region and to show whether SPR induced by 
PreHevbri or Engerix B differs by these demographic and baseline parameters or with the concomitant 
administration of another non-HBV licensed vaccine. Differences in SPR rates at Study Day 196 are

Among subjects ≥45 years old, the SPR was higher in the PreHevbri arm compared to the Engerix-B 
arm across the subgroups of age, gender, race, ethnicity, region, diabetic status, BMI, daily alcohol 
consumption, and smoking status. With the exception of subgroups of Black or African-American 
subjects, subjects in the ‘other’ race category, and those who were past smokers, all lower bounds of 
the 95% CI of the difference in SPR were above the 5% margin for clinical superiority. No asymmetry 
was evident from examination of the funnel plots for the difference in the SPR by region between 
Engerix-B and PreHevbri arm in subjects ≥45 years of age at Study Day 196.
The secondary immunogenicity endpoint to demonstrate Non-Inferiority of PreHevbri at Study Day 168 
(20 weeks following the second vaccination, just prior to the third vaccination) versus Engerix-B at 
Study Day 196 (4 weeks following the third vaccination) in Subjects ≥18 Years of Age was not met. 
Two doses of PreHevbri were not non-inferior to three doses of Engerix B, suggesting that the full three 
dose regimen of PreHevbri is required in a predominantly older population to achieve adequate levels 
of seroprotection.

vaccine and an achieved anti-HBs Levels ≥100 mIU/mL measured shortly after the vaccinations. At all 
timepoints the rate of subjects, who achieved the expected anti-HBs level was higher in the PreHevbri 
group compared to the Engerix-B group.
Rate of Non-Response at Study Day 196
The overall rate of non-responders is higher after vaccination in a 3-dose-schedule with Engerix-B 
compared to a 3-dose-schedule with PreHevbri. A favourable rate of non-responders (16.4 %) was 
shown for the age-stratum 65 years and above compared to Engerix-B (35.3%).
Revaccination data of non-responders who did not respond to a primary 3-dose vaccine series with 
anti-HBs concentration of ≥ 10 mIU/mL indicate that 25 % to 50 % responded to an additional vaccine 
dose, and 44 % to 100 % responded to a 3-dose re-vaccination series. Better response re-vaccination 
occurs in persons who have measurable but low [< 10 mIU/mL] levels after the initial series.
Preliminary results of the ongoing long-term persistence study
An investigator-initiated follow-up study is being conducted in Finland by one of the principal 
investigators of the Sci-B-Vac-001 Phase 3 study to evaluate the long-term persistence of hepatitis B 
surface antibodies (anti-HBs) in Sci-B-Vac-001 study subjects who achieved seroprotection (i.e. anti-
HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL) after a 3-dose regimen of PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B.
The preliminary results indicate that while the levels of anti-HBs in both the PreHevbri and Engerix-B 
groups demonstrated a decline in anti-HBs titers from Day 196, the mean anti-HBs titers in the 
PreHevbri group were 5 times higher compared to the Engerix-B group after approximately 2.5 years. 
After approximately 2.5 years, 11.9% of subjects that received PreHevbri have anti-HBs titers <10 
mIU/mL compared to 27.6% of subjects vaccinated with Engerix-B. A much higher proportion of 
subjects in the PreHevbri group have retained titers > 100 mIU/mL compared to the Engerix-B group. 
Analyses are ongoing to identify factors associated with loss of anti-HBs titers in follow-up.

A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess the Lot-to-lot 
Consistency of PreHevbri in Adults (CONSTANT)
Methods
 Study Participants
Eligible subjects were healthy men and women, 18 to 45 years who consented to participate in the 
study. Subjects who had previously received any hepatitis B virus vaccine (licensed or experimental) 
were excluded.

Treatments
Subjects were to receive 3 intramuscular (IM) injections according to their assigned treatment. The 
first dose was to be administered at Study Day 0, the second at 4 weeks (at Study Day 28), and the 
third at 24 weeks (at Study Day 168).
Assessment report 
Page 47/83
 
Duration of treatment was 24 weeks (vaccinations at 0, 4 and 24 weeks) with at least 24 weeks of 
follow up for safety assessments after the third vaccination. The total study duration for each subject 
was up to 48 weeks.
Anti-HBs Assessments
Immunogenicity was assessed by measurement of anti-HBs titers at Study Day 0, on Study Day 168 
just before the third vaccination, and 4 weeks and 24 weeks after the third vaccination on Study Day 
196 and on Study Day 336, respectively.
 Objectives
Primary Objective
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the manufacturing equivalence, in terms of 
immunogenicity, of 3 independent consecutive lots of PreHevbri 4 weeks after the third vaccination. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of the study were:
•
•
To demonstrate that the SPR 4 weeks after completion of the 3-dose regimen of PreHevbri 
was non-inferior to a 3-dose regimen of Engerix-B 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives of the study were:
•
•
•
•
•
To assess the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-
HBs) in serum after 2 vaccinations, just before receiving the third vaccination, and 24 
weeks after the third vaccination with PreHevbri or Engerix-B, on Study Days 168 and 336, 
respectively 
To assess the SPR after 2 vaccinations, just before receiving the third vaccination, and 24 
weeks after the third vaccination with PreHevbri or Engerix-B, on Study Days 168 and 336, 
respectively 
To assess the proportion of subjects achieving anti-HBs titers ≥100 mIU/mL in serum, as a 
measure of an especially robust immune response, on Study Days 168 and 196, just before 
and 4 weeks after the third vaccination with PreHevbri or Engerix-B, and on Study Day 336
To assess the rate of non-response on Study Day 196, 4 weeks after the third vaccination 
with PreHevbri or Engerix-B 
To assess SPR, GMC, and rate of non-response in subgroups of interest (eg, subjects with 
a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2), 4 weeks after receiving the third vaccination with 
PreHevbri or Engerix-B
 Outcomes/endpoints
The primary endpoint of the study to determine lot to lot consistency for immune response was 
assessed by measuring GMC of anti HBs across the 3 lots of PreHevbri at Day 196, 4 weeks after the 
third vaccination, and was based on the 95% CI of the GMC ratios of all three pairwise comparisons 
between lots.
The secondary immunogenicity endpoint of the study was SPR at Study Day 196, 4 weeks after 
receiving third vaccination, with either Hepthrio or Engerix B. Seroprotection was defined as anti HBs 
Assessment report 
Page 48/83
 
titers ≥10 mIU/mL in serum. Seroprotection rate was the percentage of subjects achieving 
seroprotection.
The exploratory immunogenicity endpoints of the study included: 
•
•
•
•
GMC of anti HBs in serum after 2 vaccinations, just before receiving the third vaccination, 
and 24 weeks after the third vaccination with PreHevbri or Engerix B, on Study Days 168 
and 336, respectively. 
SPR after 2 vaccinations, just before receiving the third vaccination and 24 weeks after the 
third vaccination with PreHevbri or Engerix B, on Study Days 168 and 336, respectively. 
Proportion of subjects achieving anti HBs titers ≥100 mIU/mL in serum after 2 
vaccinations, just before receiving the third vaccination, and 4 and 24 weeks after the third 
vaccination with PreHevbri or Engerix B on Study Days 168, 196, and 336, respectively. 
Rate of non-response on Study Day 196, 4 weeks after the third vaccination with PreHevbri 
or Engerix B. Rate of non-response was defined as the proportion of subjects not attaining 
anti HBs titers ≥10 mIU/mL in serum. 
An additional exploratory analysis was performed to determine whether the SPR after two doses of 
PreHevbri, evaluated 20 weeks after the second vaccination (just prior to receiving the third 
vaccination), was non inferior to the SPR 4 weeks after receiving the third dose of Engerix B. This 
additional exploratory analysis was summarized for both PPS1 and PPS2 (defined below) with data 
from all 3 PreHevbri lots (pooled) compared to Engerix-B.
Secondary and exploratory immunogenicity analyses were conducted on PPS2 for the following key 
subgroups of interest: gender (male vs female), BMI (≤ 30 kg/m2 vs > 30 kg/m2), Smoking Status 
(current vs past or non-smoker), Daily alcohol consumption (≥4 drinks/day vs 2-3 drinks/day vs 0-1 
drink/day), Non-study licensed vaccine (no vaccination vs vaccination), Race (White vs Black or African 
American vs Other), Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino vs Non-Hispanic or Latino), Country/region (United 
States vs Canada vs Europe).
 Sample size
3200 subjects (800 per arm) were planned to be recruited. Overall, 2838 subjects were enrolled: 712 
Engerix-B, 711 PreHevbri Lot A, 709 PreHevbri Lot B, 706 PreHevbri Lot C.
 Randomisation and Blinding (masking)
Patients were planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 allocation to receive 3 injections of one of the 
PreHevbri lots or 3 injections of Engerix-B. Randomisation was stratified by study centre. 
Randomization and treatment assignment were managed by an Interactive Web-based Response 
System (IWRS).
This study was planned as a double-blind study. 
 Statistical methods
Populations:
The All Enrolled Set was defined as all screened subjects who provided informed consent and provided 
demographic and/or baseline screening assessments, regardless of the subject’s randomization and 
treatment status in the study.
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was defined as all subjects of the All Enrolled Set who received at least one 
vaccination and provided at least one evaluable serum immunogenicity sample both before baseline 
and after baseline. Patients were analysed “as randomised”.
Assessment report 
Page 49/83
 
The PP set 1 was defined as all subjects in the FAS who (i) received all 3 vaccinations, (ii) had an 
evaluable serum immunogenicity sample at baseline and at the time point of interest, (iii) were 
seronegative at baseline, and (iv) had no major protocol deviations leading to exclusion, which was 
planned to be identified prior to unblinding. Patients with protocol violations that may have a 
significant impact on the immunogenicity result were excluded from the PPS (i.e., subjects enrolled 
who did not meet study entry criteria, subjects who did not receive the correct treatment, subjects 
who developed withdrawal criteria but were not withdrawn, subjects who received a prohibited 
concomitant medication). Subjects were analysed “as randomised”. 
The PPS2 was defined as all subjects in PPS1, but excluding those who attended study visits outside 
the following window: V3/Day 168 (+/- 28 days), V4/Day 196 (-7/+14 days).
The Safety Set was defined as is a subgroup of the All Enrolled Set, who received at least one dose of 
study vaccination. 
The Sub-Study analysis set (SSA) was defined as all subjects in the All Enrolled Set who actually 
receive at least one dose of study vaccination and participated in the clinical laboratory sub-study.
Primary Analysis:
The primary analysis was performed on the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of anti-HBs 4 weeks 
after the third injection (primary endpoint). The PPS1 and PPS2 were used for the primary analysis.
One primary hypothesis, consisting of three pairwise comparisons, was planned to be tested:
(1) H1: GMC of anti-HBs 4 weeks after the third injection for all pairwise comparisons (lot A vs B, 
lot B vs C, lot A vs C) are outside a margin of [0.67, 1.5] (i.e., equivalence margin).
For testing hypothesis H1, two-sided 95% confidence intervals of the GMC ratios were conducted using 
ANCOVA with a factor for vaccine lot group, and a covariate for the log transformed pre-vaccination 
(baseline) titer. Equivalence was demonstrated if the 95% CI lie within the equivalence margin of 
[0.67, 1.5]. Manufacturing equivalence (lot-to-lot consistency) was shown if all three pairwise 
comparisons were shown to be equivalent. All statistical analyses were planned to be performed on the 
logarithmically (base 10) transformed values. Individual titers below the detection limit were set to half 
the limit. Data from centers were planned to be pooled. Missing values were not planned to be imputed 
(complete case analysis).
Sensitivity analysis was conducted by performing the primary analysis on the FAS, with and without 
seropositive patients at baseline.
Secondary analysis:
If the primary hypothesis test was successful, the secondary hypothesis may be tested:
H2: Non-inferiority of SPR 4 weeks after completion of the three-dose regimen of PreHevbri 
compared to Engerix-B. Seroprotection was defined as anti-HBs levels ≥ 10mIU/mL in serum. 
Seroprotection rate (SPR) is the percentage (%) of subjects achieving seroprotection.
The non-inferiority margin was defined as -5%. A two-sided 95% confidence interval of the difference 
between the SPR in the PreHevbri arm minus the SPR in the Engerix-B arm was calculated using the 
Miettinen and Nurminen method. Missing values were not planned to be imputed. The secondary 
analysis was planned to be performed on the PPS2.
Sensitivity analysis were planned to be performed on the FAS, with and without patients who were 
seropositive at baseline.
Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints:
Assessment report 
Page 50/83
 
Exploratory immunogenicity endpoints were planned to be performed on the PPS2. No adjustment for 
multiple testing was planned.
Each of the exploratory endpoints defined in the protocol were summarized for each PreHevbri lot 
separately, as well as for the difference between each PreHevbri lot. Analysis of GMC endpoints were 
used the same methods as described for the primary endpoint. For binary data, proportions and two-
sided 95% CIs were planned to be reported. The difference in proportions and two-sided 95% CIs, 
were calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.
Additionally, each of the exploratory endpoints will be summarized with data from all 3 lots of 
PreHevbripooled together. Summaries were presented for PreHevbri, Engerix-B and for the treatment 
difference. Adjusted estimates of geometric mean serum concentrations (GMCs) and their associated 
95% CIs were planned to be determined using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with factors 
for treatment group, and a covariate for the log transformed pre-vaccination (baseline) titer. The ratio 
in GMCs between treatment groups (GMC of anti-HBs in PreHevbri / GMC of anti-HBs in Engerix-B), 
and their associated two-sided 95% CIs were planned to be presented. For binary data, proportions 
and two-sided 95% CIs were reported. The difference in proportions and two-sided 95% CIs, were 
calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.
Analysis of Safety Endpoints:
The analysis of laboratory variables was based on SSA. The analysis of the rest safety variables will be 
based on the Safety Set. Data from each PreHevbri lot were presented both individually as well as 
pooled together, while data from Engerix-B were presented separately.
Results
 Participant flow
4,452 subjects were screened. At total of 2,838 subjects were randomized to Engerix (n= 712) or to 
Lot A (n=711), Lot B (n=709) or Lot C (n=706) of PreHevbri. At baseline, a higher proportion (57.8%) 
of subjects were females and most subjects (91.5%) were white. The median age ranged from 34 to 
36 years across the vaccine groups. Median BMI of subjects in the safety set was 25.4 kg/m2 and over 
80% of subjects in each treatment group had BMI ≤30 kg/m2. Demographic and baseline 
characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups.

 Numbers analysed
The FAS included 2640 subjects who received at least 1 vaccination and had at least baseline and 1 
post baseline immunogenicity assessment: 673 in the Engerix-B group, 650 in the Lot A PreHevbri 
group, 661 in the Lot B PreHevbri group and 656 in the Lot C PreHevbri group.
The PPS1, which included all subjects in the FAS who received all 3 vaccinations, had at least baseline 
and 1 post-baseline immunogenicity assessment (at the timepoint of interest), were seronegative at 
baseline, and had no major protocol deviations leading to exclusion comprised 2,511 subjects, 
including 642 subjects in the Engerix-B group, 620 subjects in the Lot A PreHevbri group, 622 subjects 
in the Lot B PreHevbri group and 627 in the Lot C PreHevbri group.
The PPS2, which included all subjects in the PPS1 except those who attended study visits 3 and 4 
outside of the defined windows (V3/Day 168 [+/- 28 days], V4/Day 196 [-7/+14 days]), comprised 
,2381 subjects, including 603 subjects in the Engerix-B group, 590 subjects in the Lot A PreHevbri 
group, 591 subjects in the Lot B PreHevbri group, and 597 in the Lot C PreHevbri group.
 Outcomes and estimation
Primary Immunogenicity Endpoint: Lot-to-Lot Consistency of PreHevbri
The primary endpoint of the study was lot-to-lot consistency for immune response, as measured by 
GMC of anti-HBs across the 3 independent, consecutively-manufactured lots of PreHevbri at Day 196 
(Lots A, B, and C), i.e. 4 weeks after the third vaccination. The results for PPS1 are presented in Table 
10. below. Lot-to-Lot consistency was demonstrated as the 2-sided 95% CIs for the GMC ratios 
between lots were within the pre-specified margin of [0.67, 1.5] and therefore, the primary endpoint of 
the study was met.

Note: Sci-B-Vac = PreHevbri 
Although, the 2-sided 95% CIs of the anti-HBs GMC ratio between Lot A and C and between Lots B and 
C were within the pre-specified margin of [0.67, 1.5]; the 95% CIs for the pairwise comparison of Lots 
A and B [0.66, 0.99] were not within this pre-defined interval. 
Results for the FAS analysis (including and excluding subjects who were seropositive at baseline) were 
consistent with the PPS1 analysis.  
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoint: Non-Inferiority of PreHevbri versus Engerix-B at Day 196
Non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared with Engerix-B was assessed by comparing the SPR induced by 
PreHevbri and Engerix-B at Study Day 196, 4 weeks after receiving the third vaccination. Data from 
the 3 lots of PreHevbri were pooled for this analysis. Results based on PPS2 are provided in Table 12. 
below. The lower bound of the 95% CI of the difference in SPR was 2.9%, which was greater than the 
preset margin of 5%. As such, non-inferiority of PreHevbri as compared with Engerix-B at Day 196 was 
demonstrated and the secondary endpoint was met.

Results for the FAS analysis (including and excluding subjects who were seropositive at baseline) were 
consistent with the PPS2 analysis. Excluding subjects who were seropositive at baseline, the SPR in 
FAS was 99.1% in pooled PreHevbri group and 94.5% in the Engerix-B group at Day 196. The 
difference in SPR (PreHevbri minus Engerix-B) was 4.6% (95% CI: 3.04%, 6.67%). Results for the ITT 
analysis were also similar.

Given that only young (18-45 years) healthy subjects were enrolled to Sci-B-Vac-002 and the 
universally high rates of seroprotection across both PreHevbri and Engerix-B after the third 
vaccination, the advantage of PreHevbri over Engerix-B in subgroup-based intrinsic factors known to 
be associated with reduced immunogenicity (such as such as male gender, age and diabetes) was not 
as evident in Sci-B-Vac-002.

Exploratory analyses
Non-Inferiority of PreHevbri at Study Day 168 versus Engerix-B at Study Day 196 
Non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared with Engerix-B was assessed by comparing the SPR induced by 
PreHevbri at Study Day 168 (20 weeks following the second vaccination, just prior to the third 
vaccination) and Engerix-B at Study Day 196 (4 weeks following the third vaccination); results for the 
PPS2 analysis are presented in Table 14.

The lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded -10%, the commonly-used statistical margin of non-inferiority 
for vaccines (Donken, de Melker et al. 2015). The statistical criterion for non-inferiority of SPR after 2 
doses of PreHevbri compared with 3 doses of Engerix-B was met in the age group of adults 18-45 
years.
Seroprotection rates at Study Days 168, 196 and 336
Consistent with the SPR results at Day 196 reported above, higher SPR was noted in the pooled 
PreHevbri group as compared with the Engerix-B group at Day 168 and Day 336. Comparison of SPR in 
the pooled PreHevbri group to Engerix-B group in the PPS2 is presented in Table 15

98.3% Lot C).
The higher SPR in the pooled PreHevbri group compared with Engerix-B was also noted across 
subgroups at Day 168 and Day 336 with always the highest estimated difference at day 168 compared 
to Days 196 and 336.

The secondary endpoint is significant, non-inferiority of Pooled-PreHevbri vs 
Engerix-B regarding SPR at Day 168 was demonstrated. Seroprotection was 
defined as anti-HB titers 10≥ mIU/mL in serum. The estimated difference in 
proportions [SPR(pooled PreHevbri) -SPR(Engerix-B)] and 2-sided 95% CIs 
were calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.
2.5.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations
Since PreHevbri was licenced in several countries since year 2000, a number of investigator-initiated 
studies have been conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity in populations that are known to respond 
Assessment report 
Page 61/83
 
sub-optimally to HBV vaccination. These investigator-initiated studies included e.g. subjects with HIV 
(Alon 2017), ESRD (Weinstein 2004), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Elhanan 2018) and dialysis 
patients (Hung 2020). The immunogenicity in these investigator-initiated studies, including studies at 
different doses and using different administration routes than proposed in the current MAA, support 
the use of Prehevbri in subjects with HIV, end-stage renal disease and patients on dialysis.
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
The study design of the first pivotal study Sci-B Vac 001 was planned and conducted to compare the 
immunogenicity of a three-dose regimen of PreHevbri to a three-dose regimen of Engerix-B as a 
comparator to generate immunogenicity data in older adults. Engerix-B is considered the standard of 
care for the prevention of hepatitis-B in Europe. The study enrolled adult subjects 18 years and older, 
who were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive PreHevbri or Engerix.
Study Sci-B-Vac-002 was a double-blind, 4-arm, randomized study to demonstrate the manufacturing 
equivalence of 3 lots of the PreHevbri and to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a 3-dose 
regimen of PreHevbri to a 3-dose regimen of Engerix-B. Eligible subjects were healthy men and women 
who were 18 to 45 years of age. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of three lots of 
PreHevbri (Lot A, Lot B, or Lot C) or to Engerix-B.
Objectives and endpoints were planned similar in both studies and are considered appropriate by the 
CHMP. Enrolled subjects suffered from the same spectrum of comorbidities. The age-range in the 
second pivotal study (Sci-B-Vac 002) was limited to 45 years. The CHMP considered that the 
proportion of adult non-responders is higher in individuals aged 30 years and above: there is a well-
documented age-dependent decline in response rate to the currently licensed HBV vaccines. Therefore, 
the pivotal trial Sci-B-Vac 001 was the most important study to demonstrate a higher immune-
response in older adults. 80 % of subjects enrolled were aged 40 years and above. The studies 
included a larger subgroup of subjects with obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2), but a rather small subgroup of 
subjects with e.g. diabetes, i.e. other common factors known to be associated with impaired immune 
response. 
The Applicant has provided only limited data from groups with reduced response to hepatitis vaccines 
other than older adults, such as people with kidney or liver disease, or HIV infection.
Efficacy data and additional analyses
Study Sci-B-Vac-001 had two co-primary endpoints that were tested hierarchically. The primary 
immunogenicity endpoint of the study was the SPR at Study Day 196, 4 weeks after receiving the third 
injection of either PreHevbri or Engerix B. Seroprotection was defined as anti HBs levels of ≥10 
mIU/mL in serum and SPR was the percentage of subjects achieving seroprotection. The two co 
primary analyses were (1) non inferiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix B in subjects ≥18 years old 
at Study Day 196 and (2) superiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix B in subjects ≥45 years old at 
Study Day 196. Both co-primary endpoints were met in Study Sci-B-Vac 001. These results of non-
inferiority and superiority were consistent across key subgroups, which were enrolled in this study. Key 
subgroups were defined by age, gender, diabetes status, BMI, daily alcohol consumption, and smoking 
habits. Women achieved higher seroprotection rates compared to male subjects in both treatment 
groups. The SPR values decreased in both vaccine-arms with increasing age, smoking, BMI above 30 
Assessment report 
Page 62/83
 
and more than 1 drink per day. The CHMP considered that this phenomenon of decreased immune 
response is known from former hepatitis-B vaccines and that the Applicant addressed the issue by 
adding the key subgroups in the study design and the corresponding immunogenicity analysis. 
A hierarchical testing method was used for the secondary endpoints analyses. First, non-inferiority of 
the SPR for PreHevbri at Study Day 168, compared to the SPR for Engerix- B at Study Day 196 was to 
be assessed. If that endpoint was met, then non-inferiority of PreHevbri at Study Day 56, compared to 
Engerix- B at Study Day 196 was to be assessed. The first secondary objective was not met. Two 
doses of PreHevbri were not non inferior to three doses of Engerix B, suggesting that the full three 
dose regimen of PreHevbri is required in a predominantly older population to achieve adequate levels 
of seroprotection. Only the youngest age stratum (18-44 years) developed a comparable SPR after two 
doses PreHevbri compared to three doses Engerix 87.2% vs 91.1%. The first secondary objective was 
not met and therefore, the results for the non-inferiority analysis of PreHevbri at Study Day 56, 
compared to Engerix B at Study Day 196 are not discussed due to hierarchical testing method.
Exploratory analysis showed that SPR in the PreHevbri arm was more than twice as high as the SPR in 
the Engerix-B arm at all timepoints in the first 6 months: 16.0% vs. 7.7% at Study Day 28, 51.5% vs. 
23.9% at Study Day 56, and 66.0% vs. 27.4% at Study Day 168. Furthermore, significantly higher 
GMCs of anti-HBs were noted for PreHevbri compared with Engerix-B at all timepoints. Markedly higher 
anti-HBs titers were noted after the second dose of PreHevbri (Study Day 56) with GMC of 17.25 
mIU/mL as compared with 5.85 mIU/mL in the Engerix B arm. Anti-HBs titers peaked at Study Day 
196 in both treatment arms with higher GMCs noted in the PreHevbri arm as compared with the 
Engerix-B arm (1148.31 mIU/mL vs 192.65 mIU/mL).
At all timepoints, the rate of subjects who achieved the expected anti-HBs level ≥100 mIU/mL was 
higher in the PreHevbri group compared to the Engerix-B group. The rate of non-responders was 
higher in the Engerix-B arm compared to the PreHevbri arm. Overall, subjects generally responded well 
to PreHevbri and better than to Engerix-B, regardless of demographic and baseline factors. While 
increasing age is a factor associated with non-response to HBV vaccination in both vaccines, the impact 
of this factor is consistently lower across all age groups in the PreHevbri group compared to the 
Engerix-B group. These results indicate a promising treatment option in cases of insufficient immune 
response.
Of note, investigations to address the exploratory endpoints related to antibody responses against pre-
S1 and pre-S2, as well as cell-mediated immune response against HBsAg were provided by the 
Applicant. Regarding anti-Pre-S1 and anti Pre-S2 antibody responses, high avidity antibody responses 
were induced against pre-S1 and/or pre-S2 in approximately 23% of subjects vaccinated with 
PreHevbri. It is possible that the response rate is higher than seen, but the lack of sensitivity of the 
assay may preclude its detection. Although there appears to be some degree of correlation of positive 
response to pre-S1 and pre-S2 with anti-HBs titers, the sample size was very limited and may limit the 
interpretation of the data. Despite assay variability and false positives associated with the cultured 
ELISpot assay to detect cell-mediated immunity results, the frequency of detectable responders and 
magnitude of response was greater with PreHevbri (N=80). Statistically significant between group 
differences were observed on Day 35 (7 days after the second vaccination with both vaccines). At this 
timepoint, background activity was high in both groups. However, the difference in adjusted mean 
frequency of IFN-γ-secreting SFU/million PBMCs was statistically significant (p < 0.05) and greater in 
PreHevbri subjects. These responses to pre-S1 and pre-S2 at Day 35 in the PreHevbri group were 
correlated with anti-HBs titer at Day 196. A similar, statistically significant correlation between ELISpot 
responses against the pre-S1, pre-S2 and S antigens at Day 175 and anti-HBs titers at Day 196 was 
also observed in PreHevbri subjects after 3 doses of vaccines. Notwithstanding the limited sample size 
(N=50), correlation of mean stimulation index of pre-S2 on Day 175 with anti-HBs Geometric Mean 
Titers on Day 196 was also statistically significant in the PreHevbri subjects. Further correlation 
Assessment report 
Page 63/83
 
analyses demonstrated strong and statistically significant correlations between ELISpot responses to 
pre-S2 at Day 35 after vaccination with PreHevbri and anti-HB titers in subjects at Days 56 and 168. 
No such correlations to pre-S1 and pre-S2 were seen in the Engerix-B group indicating that the 
ELISpot response observed in this group were likely background "noise" of the assay. Despite 
containing half the antigen content of Engerix-B, PreHevbri is considered to induce a comparable 
magnitude of response to HBsAg in a similar number of subjects after the second and third doses 
relative to Engerix-B.
Data from investigator-led studies indicated an adequate immune response to PreHevbri (at 10 μg and 
20 μg doses) in subjects with HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and patients on dialysis who were 
vaccine-naïve or non-responders to previous vaccinations. 
The primary immunogenicity endpoint in study Sci-B-Vac 002 of lot-to-lot consistency between the 3 
batches was met for the PPS1 and FAS population, but not for the PPS2 population subjects who 
attended study visits 3 and 4 outside of the defined windows (V3/Day 168 [+/- 28 days], V4/Day 196 
[-7/+14 days]). Even though the lot-to-lot consistency could not be proven for the PPS2 population for 
the comparison of Lot A vs Lot B, the difference in PPS1 and PPS2 results are negligible. 
The secondary immunogenicity endpoint, i.e. the demonstration of non-inferiority of PreHevbri 
compared with Engerix-B, was assessed by comparing the SPR (ie, percentage of subjects with anti-
HBs titers ≥10 mIU/mL) induced by PreHevbri and Engerix-B at Study Day 196, 4 weeks after 
receiving the third vaccination. Data from the 3 lots of PreHevbri were pooled for this analysis. The 
pooled SPR at study day 196 in subjects in the PPS2 and FAS who received PreHevbri was 99.3 % 
compared to 94.8% for subjects who received Engerix-B, i.e. a difference of 4.50% (95% CI: 2.9, 
6.6). Non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix B was based on the difference in SPR and the 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI, using a -5% margin of non-inferiority. 2.9 as the lower bound 
proved the non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B. The SPR in the PreHevbri group was 
consistent across all subgroups evaluated, and a higher SPR as compared with the Engerix-B group 
was noted in all subgroups, with the exception of the subgroup of Black or African American subjects 
and the subgroup of subjects who consumed ≥4 alcoholic drinks at baseline. These subgroups of 
subjects achieved a 100% SPR with both Engerix-B and PreHevbri, although the sample sizes were 
small. 
The first exploratory objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared with Engerix-B 
was assessed by comparing the SPR induced by PreHevbri at Study Day 168 (20 weeks following the 
second vaccination, just prior to the third vaccination) and Engerix-B at Study Day 196 (4 weeks 
following the third vaccination). The statistical criterion for non-inferiority of SPR after 2 doses of 
PreHevbri compared with 3 doses of Engerix-B was met in the age group of adults 18-45 years.
Higher mean GMC of anti-HBs were noted after vaccination with PreHevbri (pooled) compared to 
Engerix B after the second vaccination at Study Day 168 (118.95 mIU/mL vs 14.99 mIU/mL) and after 
the third vaccination at Study Day 196 (5443.07 mIU/mL vs 1526.26 mIU/mL). The rate of non-
responders was lower in subjects who received PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B.
Overall, the substantially higher mean GMC in the PreHevbri group compared to the Engerix-B group at 
all measured time points is considered clinically relevant. In addition, a plot showing the distribution of 
anti-HBs titers (reverse cumulative distribution plot) for the PreHevbri group and the Engerix-B group 
was provided for each time point from both the Sci-B-Vac 001 and the Sci-B-Vac 002 study. At each 
timepoint, higher titers were achieved by a greater percentage of subjects in the PreHevbri group 
compared to the Engerix-B group in both studies. Peak titers were achieved at Day 196, 4 weeks after 
the third vaccination in both studies. 
Assessment report 
Page 64/83
 
It was observed that GMC of anti-HBs titers in the PreHevbri group continued to be higher compared to 
the Engerix-B group up to day 336 (6 months after the third vaccination). The higher peak titers at 
Day 196 in the PreHevbri group in both studies were shown to translate into higher rates of 
seroprotection at one year (Day 336) at both the 10 mIU/mL and the 100 mIU/mL thresholds.
An investigator-initiated follow-up study is being conducted in Finland by one of the principal 
investigators of the Sci-B-Vac-001 Phase 3 study to evaluate the long-term persistence of hepatitis B 
surface antibodies (anti-HBs) in Sci-B-Vac-001 study subjects who achieved seroprotection (i.e. anti-
HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL) after a 3-dose regimen of PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B. With this submission, 
the Applicant provided persistence data up to 2.5 years after vaccination either with Engerix-B or 
PreHevbri. These data indicated a robust and lasting immune response, which was considered 
convincing by the CHMP. It was demonstrated that the level of GMTs and seroprotection rates for the 
PreHevbri vaccine group are higher than for the Engerix-B-group. Moreover, the proportion of subjects 
in the PreHevbri group that have retained titers > 100 mIU/mL is approximately two-fold compared to 
the Engerix-B group. 
The CHMP recommended that results from this investigator-initiated follow-up study be submitted once 
published.
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
Overall, the data from the two pivotal and several supportive studies indicated immunogenicity of 
PreHevbri across the age (above 18 years) as well as other key subgroups. The proposed 3-dose 
schedule was supported by SPRs and GMCs documented in the pivotal trials. 
The efficacy profile of PreHevbri is considered to support a positive B/R balance.
2.5.8.  Clinical safety
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure
Within the two pivotal studies (Sci-B-Vac-001 and Sci-B-Vac 002) a total of 2,920 subjects were 
exposed to PreHevbri, of whom 2,725 (93.3%) received the full 3-dose schedule. This number is 
regarded as adequate, in accordance with the WHO guideline (2017 “Annex 9, Guidelines on clinical 
evaluation of vaccines: regulatory expectations”), taking into consideration that also data from the 
post marketing setting are available for this vaccine and no safety concerns arouse to date. The most 
frequent reasons for not completing the study were “lost to follow up” (N=166), “withdrawal of consent 
not due to AE” (N=56), “pregnancy” (N=13) and “moved from the study area” (N=9). Withdrawal for 
non-serious AE was documented for 6 subjects, and due to SAEs for 3 subjects.
The studies enrolled only adult patients (≥18 years). This was considered acceptable, as the paediatric 
indication is not sought by the Applicant. Elderly subjects ≥65 years (N=296, 37.2% in study Sci-B-
Vac-001) were included. Demographics between PreHevbri and the comparator Engerix-B in the pooled 
data set were well matched, except for age. The imbalance was due to study Sci-B-Vac-002, which 
only enrolled subjects 18-45 years of age, randomized 1:3 to either Engerix-B or PreHevbri. Thus, in 
the polled data set, the percentage of older subjects was lower for PreHevbri (10.1% ≥65 years of 
age) compared to Engerix-B (19.4%).
An additional 1,881 subjects were exposed to PreHevbri or a former formulation of the vaccine 
(containing thiomersal, until 1998; containing AlPO4, until 1994) within other clinical studies, of which 
743 subjects were vaccinated with the current formulation of PreHevbri.
Assessment report 
Page 65/83
 
In the post-marketing setting, an estimated 305,302 subjects have been vaccinated with the 10 µg 
dose in a 3 dose schedule since 2000.
2.5.8.2.  Adverse events
In the two pivotal studies, adverse events were classified as solicited local, solicited systemic and 
treatment emergent adverse events, the latter including all unsolicited adverse events occurring within 
28 days after each vaccination and all solicited events continuing beyond Day 7.
Solicited AEs were assessed Day 1-7 following vaccination. Unsolicited AEs were assessed through day 
28 post vaccination, and serious adverse events (SAE), medically attended adverse event (MAAE) and 
new onset of a chronic illness (NOCI) were assessed through day 336. 
Any solicited local adverse events were reported in 81.4% and 55.7% of subjects vaccinated with 
PreHevbri and Engerix-B, respectively. The differences between the vaccines were mainly driven by the 
AE of local pain (72.2% and 44.5%, respectively) and tenderness (71.2% and 44.2%, respectively). 
Local reactions to PreHevbri were more frequent after the first vaccination (69.8%), compared to the 
2nd (61.3%) and 3rd (61.4%) vaccination.
The majority of solicited local reactions were mild to moderate. Severe solicited local AEs were 
reported more frequently in the PreHevbri group (2.4%) compared with the Engerix-B group (0.9%). 
Both frequency and severity of solicited local reactions were higher in study Sci-B-Vac-002 compared 
to study Sci-B-Vac-001 for both vaccines. A higher reactogenicity of PreHevbri compared to 
comparator vaccines has also been observed in former trials. Concerning the higher local and to a 
lesser extent systemic reactogenicity for PreHevbri in this trial, the difference might be lower than the 
data indicate; of note, Sci-B-Vac-002 enrolled younger subjects (18-45 years of age), randomized 1:3 
to either Engerix-B or PreHevbri. Thus, in the pooled data set, percentage of older subjects with less 
reactogenicity was lower for PreHevbri (10.1% ≥65 years of age) compared to Engerix-B (19.4%). 
Severe local reactions were reported in 0.6% (Sci-B-Vac-001) and 1.1% (Sci-B-Vac-001) subjects for 
the Engerix-B group, and for 1.3% and 2.9% for the PreHevbri group. Due to the imbalance in patient 
numbers in study Sci-B-Vac-002, pooled data slightly increase the differences in reactogenicity 
observed between the two vaccines.
Grade 4 local reactions were reported for 0.7% (N=10) subjects in the Engerix-B group and 0.5% 
(N=14) subjects in the PreHevbri group. The AE or either redness or swelling/ oedema were not 
medically confirmed, as they were not medically attended. The maximum diameter was up to 50 mm 
(defined as grade 1) and did not (re-)occur after previous/following vaccinations. Redness and/or 
swelling/ oedema were reported by less than 3% of subjects vaccinated with either Engerix-B or 
PreHevbri. 
Solicited systemic adverse events included nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, fatigue and 
myalgia. Body temperature was measured and recorded daily by the subjects for 7 days after each 
vaccination. Solicited systemic AEs were reported after any vaccination in 54.1% and 64.7% of 
subjects in the Engerix-B and PreHevbri group, respectively. Similar to the local reactions but to a 
lesser extent, the frequency and severity of solicited systemic AEs was higher in study Sci-B-Vac-002 
compared to study Sci-B-Vac-001.
The difference in the overall systemic reactogenicity was mainly due to myalgia, reported for 28.1% of 
subjects in the Engerix-B vaccine group and 41.7% in the PreHevbri vaccine group, respectively. For 
myalgia, differences between the vaccines were evident in both studies (24.3% and 34.7%, 
respectively in study Sci-B-Vac-001 and 32.4% and 44.4%  respectively in study Sci-B-Vac-002). 
Assessment report

Again, the pooled data further increased the difference due to the aspects discussed above for local 
reactogenicity. 
The majority of solicited systemic AEs were mild to moderate. In the pooled data, severe solicited 
systemic AEs were reported in 2.8% subjects in the PreHevbri and 2.6% in Engerix-B group. Despite 
higher frequencies for severe systemic reactions in the Engerix-B group in Study Sci-B-Vac-001 (2.3% 
versus 1.6%), and 2.9% versus 3.2% in study Sci-B-Vac-002, the higher percentage for PreHevbri in 
the pooled data again was due to the imbalances in subjects enrolled in study Sci-B-Vac-002. Grade 4 
solicited systemic reactions were reported for 3 subjects in the PreHevbri group, with one case of 
nausea/vomiting, headache and fatigue each. 
Fever, defined as body temperature ≥38°C, was reported in 0.7% to 1.3% of subjects vaccinated 
within Sci-B-Vac-001 or with one of the three lots (A, B or C) in study Sci-B-Vac-002. Severe fever (39
°C to 40°C) was recorded in 0.1% of subjects in study Sci-B-Vac-001 and in 0.3% (N=2) of 
participants vaccinated with Lot B, and for none vaccinated with Lot A or Lot C. Fever >40°C was 
documented for one subject (0.1%) vaccinated with Lot C. 
Treatment emergent AEs were reported at similar frequencies within each study and in the pooled data 
for both treatment arms. The most frequent TEAEs that were reported within 28 days of any 
vaccination in the PreHevbri and Engerix-B group were headache (11.0% and 10.0%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (8.4% and 7.6%), nasopharyngitis (4.6% and 4.8%) and fatigue (3.9% and 
3.7%), respectively. Also the table presenting all TEAEs, i.e. including events that occurred with a 
frequency below 1%, did not reveal any meaningful imbalance with regards to the nature or frequency 
of TEAS.
The overall frequency of reported TEAEs decreased in both vaccine groups after successive 
vaccinations; subjects in the PreHevbri and Engerix-B groups reported TEAEs at 29.6% and 30.0% 
after vaccination 1, 21.3% and 21.9% after vaccination 2, and 21.2% and 19.4% after vaccination 3, 
respectively.
Unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 28 days of vaccination and lasted longer than 28 days 
were uncommon and similar with Engerix B in both Sci-B-Vac-001 and Sci-B-Vac-002 pivotal studies. 
Most of the TEAEs within 28 days of any vaccination were mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 and 4 
TEAEs within 28 days of any vaccination were low and reported at similar incidences in the PreHevbri 
and Engerix-B groups (6.4% and 6.3%, respectively).
Excluding the solicited AEs persisting beyond day 7 after any vaccination, TEAEs in 305 subjects 
(10.4%) in the PreHevbri group and 130 subjects (8.5%) in the Engerix-B group were deemed 
vaccine-related. Of those, the most frequent TEAEs for PreHevbri vs. Engerix-B were upper respiratory 
tract infection (1.0% vs. 0.7%), dizziness (1.0% vs. 0.5%), injection site bruising (0.8% vs. 0.6%), 
oropharyngeal pain (0.7% vs. 0.5%), nasopharyngitis (0.6% vs. 0.4%) and headache (0.5% vs. 
0.7%). The only Grade 3 or 4 related TEAEs reported were two cases of gastroenteritis in the 
PreHevbri group (0.1%).
2.5.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
The incidence of SAEs was slightly higher in the PreHevbri, compared with the Engerix-B vaccine 
group. SAEs were reported in 74 subjects (2.5%) and 24 subjects (1.6%), respectively. One SAE was 
assessed as related by the investigator, but not by the sponsor: viral gastroenteritis in the PreHevbri 
group. The sponsors´ assessment which concluded against causality was accepted and therefore the 
AE of viral gastroenteritis is not listed in the SmPC. None of the SAEs in the Engerix B group were 
considered vaccine-related. 
Assessment report 
Page 67/83
 
The frequency of Medically attended solicited and unsolicited adverse events (MAAEs) was similar for 
PreHevbri and Engerix-B vaccinated (0.6% vs. 0.5% solicited, and 22.7% vs. 23.4% unsolicited). The 
most frequently reported MAAEs during the study in the PreHevbri group (with corresponding incidence 
in the Engerix-B group) were upper respiratory tract infection (1.5% vs. 1.3%), sinusitis (1.3% vs. 
1.2%), urinary tract infection (1.2% vs. 1.6%), back pain (0.9% vs. 0.5%), and depression (0.7% 
both groups). 
The frequency of Investigator determined New Onset of Chronic Illness Events (NOCI) was similar for 
PreHevbri and Engerix-B vaccinated (2% vs. 2.5%). Hypertension was the most often reported event 
for both groups (0.3% vs. 0.5%) and the SmPC includes information regarding hypertension with the 
frequency rare. 
Contrary to local and systemic reactogenicity, frequency of SAEs was higher in study Sci-B-Vac-001 
compared to Sci-B-Vac-002, experienced by 2.6% and 4.0% of subjects in the Engerix-B and Hebhtiro 
group, respectively in study Sci-B-Vac-001 compared to 0.4% and 2.0% also respectively, for study 
Sci-B-Vac-002. The differences in frequency were mainly due to SAEs in the SOCs of cardiac and 
gastrointestinal disorders, infections and neoplasms, which were reported more frequently in study Sci-
B-Vac-001, i.e. the study with the older study population.
It was reported that one patient died of cardiac arrest on day 7 after first vaccination with PreHevbri. 
The cause of death was not related to the vaccine.
Overall, there was no specific pattern of SAEs or deaths that are suspected to be related to vaccination 
with PreHevbri.
2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings
A laboratory substudy was performed in 393 Sci-B-Vac subjects and 193 Engerix-B subjects. The 
majority of subjects had no shifts from their baseline biochemistry values or shifted to Grade 1 or 2 
abnormalities.
2.5.8.5.  Safety in special populations
Safety was assessed in different sub-populations based on age, gender, ethnicity, race, region (US, 
Canada, Europe), BMI, smoking status, alcohol intake and diabetes (yes/no).
Of all subjects enrolled, 296 subjects ≥65 years were vaccinated with PreHevbri, of whom 53 were 
≥75 years of age. As for the pooled date, local and systemic solicited AEs were more frequently 
reported for PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B. Local reactogenicity was lower in the elderly compared 
to the pooled data. The most frequent local reactions pain and tenderness were reported in 55.1% and 
54.7% of subjects, respectively, aged 65-74 years and 45.1% for both reactions in the 75-84 years 
old, compared to 72.2% and 71.1%, respectively, in the pooled date-set. 
Solicited systemic events were reported at similar frequencies for the 65-74 and 75-84 years age 
groups (43.2% and 43.1%). This was below the overall frequency in the pooled data set of 64.7% for 
any systemic solicited AE. 
The most frequent solicited systemic adverse event, myalgia, was reported in 27.6% in the 65-74 and 
27.5 % in the 75-84 year old subgroups, compared to a frequency of 41.7% in the pooled data-set. 
Lower frequencies were also reported for fatigue, occurring in 24.7% and 23.5% of the 65-74 and 74 -
84 years old, respectively, compared to 37.5% in the pooled data. Similarly, headache was less 
frequent with 18.5% and 13.7%, also respectively for the two elderly age groups, compared to 36.3% 
in the pooled data.
Assessment report 
Page 68/83
 
With regards to gender, solicited AEs were more frequent in female subjects, with local AEs in the 
PreHevbri versus Engerix-B group at 86.5% vs. 60.5% for females and 74.4% vs. 48.1% for males, 
respectively. The overall rate of solicited systemic AEs was 70.7% vs. 58.8% for females and 56.5% 
vs. 46.8% for males, respectively. Severity grade 3 was more frequent for woman than for men.
Concerning race, solicited AEs were more frequent in White subjects. The overall rate of solicited local 
AEs in the PreHevbri and Engerix-B groups was 83.3% vs. 56.8% for White subjects and 55.6% vs. 
35.0% for Black or African American subjects, respectively. However, pruritus was more frequently 
reported in Black or African American subjects receiving PreHevbri, with 16.4% compared to 11,7% in 
Whites. The overall rate of solicited systemic AEs in the PreHevbri and Engerix-B groups was 66.2% vs. 
55.3% for White subjects and 41.8% vs. 35.9% for Black or African American subjects, respectively. 
White subjects reported a slightly higher incidence of SAEs than Black or African American subjects 
who received PreHevbri (2.6% vs. 1.6%, respectively). A similar picture was seen for Hispanics/Latinos 
vs. non-Hispanics, with higher frequencies of solicited AEs in the Non-Hispanic subjects. Similarly to 
the above, pruritus was the exception with higher frequencies reported in Hispanics after vaccination 
with PreHevbri, with 13.1% versus 12.1% in non-Latinos/non-Hispanics.
With regards to age, Sci-B-Vac-001 is considered a more relevant source of adverse event data in the 
older adults, as this study enrolled a wider population of adults across a broad age range and included 
adults with well-controlled chronic conditions. All 296 study participants of 65+ years that received 
PreHevbri were enrolled in Sci- B-Vac-001. Upon request, the Applicant submitted an integrated 
analysis of Sci-B-Vac-001 and Sci-B-Vac-002. A small increase in the frequency of general age-related 
adverse events among older PreHevbri subjects in the Sci-B-Vac-001 study was noted. These events, 
which include cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, hospitalization and cataracts, are not unexpected 
and only occurred in 2 people each in the 75–84 year-old age group. Injection site pain, as an adverse 
event, appeared to be more common in the 75–84 year-olds than in younger subjects, but occurred at 
a low absolute frequency (n=4), and again is not unexpected in older subjects due to changes in body 
composition. Given the low frequency of these events among older subjects, no updates to the Product 
Information were considered necessary. The frequency of SAEs across age groups was comparable in 
the Sci-B- Vac-001 study.
Non-diabetic subjects reported a higher overall rate of solicited AEs. Solicited local AEs in the PreHevbri 
and Engerix-B groups was 81.7% vs. 56.7% for non-diabetic subjects and 65.6% vs. 32.3% for 
diabetic subjects, respectively. Again, the exception is pruritus with slightly higher rates in diabetics 
(13.1%) versus non-diabetics (12.2%) after PreHevbri vaccination. The overall rate of solicited 
systemic AEs in the PreHevbri and Engerix-B groups was 65.0% vs. 55.1% for non-diabetic subjects 
and 52.5% vs. 30.8% for diabetic subjects, respectively.
Subjects with a BMI ≤30 reported a higher frequency of the two local solicited AEs of pain and 
tenderness compared to subjects with BMI>30, while the other local AEs were slightly lower. There 
were no differences with respect to systemic solicited AEs.
Analysing the subgroups by extrinsic factors, the overall frequency of solicited local and systemic 
events were similar between smokers and non-smokers and alcohol consumption. 
Several groups of patients and special populations were not included in the pivotal trials. Additional 
information was requested for pregnant and lactating women, patients with autoimmune diseases, 
immunosuppressed patients, subjects with kidney or liver disease, HIV infection or diabetes. The 
Applicant provided high level clinical safety data for patients with intestinal bowel disease, HIV infected 
individuals, patients with kidney disease/renal failure and hepatic disease/liver transplant patients. In 
summary, the available clinical data in the mentioned special population subgroups did not raise 
concerns but are still considered limited. 
Assessment report 
Page 69/83
 
While pregnant and lactating women were excluded per exclusion criteria, fourteen subjects who 
received at least one dose of PreHevbri reported pregnancies in the course of the study, of whom four 
had an AE associated with pregnancy. Three were regarded SAEs, including one spontaneous abortion, 
one intrauterine death of a child diagnosed with Trisomy 21 and one case of ankyloglossia congenital, 
with the relationship to vaccination considered unlikely. Whether PreHevbri has been administered to 
pregnant or lactating women during marketed use is not known. 
The SmPC includes information that there are no data for use of the vaccine in pregnant woman, and 
that it is unknown whether the vaccine is excreted in human milk. The safety specifications includes 
the use in pregnancy or breastfeeding as missing information.
2.5.8.6.  Immunological events
No allergic or anaphylactic reactions were reported.
2.5.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
Specific drug-drug interactions were not assessed in the 2 pivotal trials. Specifically, administration of 
PreHevbri and other vaccines has not been studied, which is adequately reflected in the SmPC. The 
prophylactic use of antiphlogistics has not been studied, either. 
An analysis of concomitantly administered medication was provided in the dossier. The submitted data 
did not reveal any meaningful imbalance in the 2 vaccine groups with regards to the use of 
concomitant medication, either in the individual studies or in the pooled analysis. The frequency of 
administration of concomitant medication in both vaccine groups was slightly higher in trial Sci-B-Vac-
001 than in Sci-B-Vac-002, which could be explained by the different age range in these two trials. 
Individuals older than 45 years of age with or without well-controlled chronic disease were only 
included in Sci-B-Vac-001.
2.5.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events
In the pooled data set, 0.4% and 0.5% of subject of the Engerix-B and PreHevbri group, respectively 
were withdrawn from vaccination due to TEAE. 
No obvious pattern in the nature of TEAE could be detected. The discontinuation of 8 subjects in the 
PreHevbri group were due to diagnosis of Arnold-Chiari malformation, sudden cardiac death, viral 
gastroenteritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, dizziness, oropharyngeal pain, and migraine.
2.5.8.9.  Post marketing experience
No new safety concerns arose from the post-marketing experience.
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety
The safety data base, including data from 2,920 subjects having been exposed to PreHevbri within the 
two pivotal studies, in conjunction with the data from post-marketing surveillance, with approx. 
305,302 subjects having been vaccinated in a 3-dose schedule with the current formulation of the 
vaccine and additional data from supportive studies is considered sufficient by the CHMP. 
Across both studies (pooled data) and all subgroups analysed, local reactogenicity and solicited 
systemic adverse events occurred more frequently in the PreHevbri group compared to Engerix-B. It 
Assessment report 
Page 70/83
 
has to be taken into account, that more subjects were randomized to PreHevbri in the lot-to-lot 
consistency study that enrolled younger subjects, i.e. study Sci-B-Vac-002. This study reported higher 
frequencies for both local and system solicited reactions for both vaccines. Thus in the pooled data, 
younger subjects are overrepresented in the PreHevbri group. 
Local AEs were reported in 55.7% and 81.4% of subjects in the Engerix-B and PreHevbri group, 
respectively. For the systemic solicited AEs, the differences were less pronounced, with frequencies of 
54.1 % and 64.7 % also respectively. The differences in frequencies were mainly driven by higher 
frequency of pain and tenderness at the injection site and the solicited systemic AE of myalgia. Most of 
the solicited AEs (local and systemic) were mild to moderate in intensity. Frequencies of solicited local 
and systemic AEs were highest after the first vaccination for both vaccines.
TEAEs were reported at similar frequencies within each study and for the pooled data for both 
treatment arms, reported in 48.4% of subjects vaccinated with Engerix-B and 48.3% vaccinated with 
PreHevbri. No substantial differences were detected between the treatment groups neither with respect 
to the nature of the TEAE nor to its severity. Few subjects experienced an SAE, with only one being 
assessed as vaccine-related by the investigator (viral gastroenteritis), assessed as unrelated by the 
sponsor. SAEs were reported slightly more often in the PreHevbri group, driven by events in the SOC 
of Infections and infestations, and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications. Only few subjects 
were withdrawn from further dosing or from the study due to AEs.  
Regarding the different subgroups analysed, higher frequencies of adverse event were generally 
reported in female versus male, Whites versus Black or African Americans, non-Latinos/non-Hispanics 
vs Latinos, non-diabetics versus diabetics, participants from Europe vs North America, except for the 
AE of pruritus. Of note, no allergic or anaphylactic reactions were recorded.
Regarding the lot-to-lot consistency study (Sci-B-Vac-002), similar frequencies and severity were 
reported for the three lots for local and systemic solicited adverse events, unsolicited, treatment 
emergent adverse events, TEAE leading to study withdrawal and SAEs. There was also no difference in 
the assessments of relatedness.
Some patient groups have been excluded from the studies, for instance patients with hepatic 
impairment, kidney impairment, cardiac impairment, autoimmune disease, immunocompromised 
patients, pregnant and lactating women.  Clinical data are therefore limited. Due to scarce data in 
humans, PreHevbri should preferably only be used during pregnancy when there is a clear risk of 
hepatitis B infection and when benefit outweighs the risk. This has been adequately addressed in the 
SmPC.
Due to the fact, that total number of subjects in the clinical database exposed to PreHevbri was slightly 
below three-thousand, the lowest category of frequency for any event, even occurring in a single 
subjects only, was reported as “rare”. The category “very rare”, with frequencies < 1/10,000 was not 
applicable.
The vaccine had been licensed in several countries and post-marketing surveillance did not detect any 
safety signal.
Despite the fact that PreHevbri showed a higher reactogenicity profile compared to Engerix-B with 
respect to local reactions and, to a lesser extent, with respect to systemic solicited AEs, the safety 
profile is acceptable as the intensity of the solicited AEs was mostly mild to moderate and did not 
warrant any safety concerns. No differences between the three lots tested in study Sci-B-Vac-002 
regarding safety and reactogenicity profile of the vaccine could be detected. No major differences were 
seen for unsolicited treatment emergent AEs or related AEs between the two vaccines.
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
Assessment report 
Page 71/83
 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
Overall, the submitted clinical safety data indicate an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile for 
PreHevbri. No major safety concerns were identified. The safety profile of PreHevbri is considered to 
support a positive B/R balance.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
HBV infection causes a broad spectrum of disease severity from subclinical self-limiting infections to 
fulminant hepatitis or chronic infection. Up to 50% of adults develop symptomatic icteric hepatitis, 
which is characterized by fatigue, fever, anorexia and jaundice. Acute HBV infection can develop into a 
chronic disease. The likelihood that HBV infection becomes chronic is age-dependent. While infants 
infected with HBV in the first year of life almost universally develop chronic infection, 
immunocompetent adults develop chronic hepatitis at a rate of 5-10%. Immunosuppressed individuals, 
including those with diabetes and older adults are at an increased risk of developing chronic HBV. In 
adults, while acute HBV symptoms are typically transient and self-limiting, among those who become 
chronically infected with HBV, 20-30% will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Recombinant DNA-derived vaccines against HBV have been available for more than two decades. The 
primary hepatitis B immunization series conventionally consists of three doses of vaccine. Vaccination 
of infants and, in particular, delivery of hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth is 90–95% effective 
in preventing infection with HBV as well as decreasing HBV transmission if followed by at least two 
other doses. WHO recommends universal hepatitis B vaccination for all infants, and that the first dose 
should be given as soon as possible after birth. In the EU, the recommendations for adult HBV 
vaccination reflect regional differences in the hepatitis B vaccination programme, which depend on the 
epidemiology of HBV in the region and logistic considerations and are largely based on targeted risk-
group vaccination strategies.
Adults who were not immunized as children remain at risk of becoming infected with HBV. Up to 10% 
of all adults fail to achieve seroprotective levels of antibodies against HBV (i.e. anti-HBs ≥10 mIU/mL) 
with a three-dose schedule of conventional HBV vaccines, and are considered “non-responders” to 
hepatitis B vaccination. 
In addition to age and genetic factors, other factors are known to be associated with reduced 
immunogenicity of HBV vaccines in adults, including obesity, diabetes, smoking and concomitant 
diseases.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
To support the authorisation of PreHevbri in Europe and North America, two Phase 3 clinical trials (Sci-
B-Vac-001 and Sci-B-Vac-002) that compared PreHevbri to Engerix-B were conducted in Europe and 
North America to further evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and manufacturing consistency of the 
adult formulation to be marketed. The chosen comparator for these phase 3 trials, Engerix-B (20 μg 
HBsAg), is an approved standard-of-care HBV vaccine for the immunization of adults.
The phase 3 clinical development programme of PreHevbri in North America and Europe was developed 
with the knowledge that many people who remain at risk of HBV infection are over the age of 30 and 
may suffer from comorbid condition that may prevent them from mounting an effective immune 
response following vaccination with HBV vaccines. With this in mind, the phase 3 trial (Sci-B-Vac-001) 
Assessment report 
Page 77/83
 
enrolled adults ≥18 years old, including those with well-controlled chronic diseases. Moreover, a high 
proportion of adults ≥45 years of age, with targeted enrolment of 40% in the 45-64 year old age 
group and 40% in the ≥65 year old age group, has been enrolled.
Sci-B-Vac-001 was a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, comparative, controlled study with the 
primary objective to establish the non-inferiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B, based on the 
SPR 4 weeks after the third vaccination in adults (≥18 years) and the superiority of PreHevbri 
compared to Engerix-B in subjects ≥45 years old (co-primary objectives). Eligible subjects were men 
and women, 18 years of age or older, in stable health or with controlled chronic conditions. Pregnant 
and breastfeeding females, individuals with autoimmune disease and immunodeficiency disorders were 
not enrolled in the trial. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a web-based randomization 
system to receive either 3 intramuscular injections of PreHevbri or 3 injections of Engerix-B delivered 
at 0, 1 and 6 months and followed for 24 weeks after the third vaccination to ensure an adequate 
safety assessment. 1607 subjects were randomized, including 796 subjects to the PreHevbri treatment 
arm and 811 subjects to the Engerix-B treatment arm. All randomized subjects received their assigned 
treatment.
Sci-B-Vac-002 was a double-blind, 4-arm, randomized study with the primary objective to demonstrate 
the manufacturing equivalence of three consecutive lots of PreHevbri, in terms of immunogenicity four 
weeks after the third vaccination (Study Day 196). Eligible subjects were healthy men and women, 18 
to 45 years of age. Pregnant and breastfeeding females, individuals with autoimmune disease and 
immunodeficiency disorders were not enrolled in the trial. Overall, 2838 subjects were randomized in 
the study, including 712 subjects in the Engerix-B group, 711 subjects in the Lot A PreHevbri group, 
709 subjects in the Lot B PreHevbri group and 706 in the Lot C PreHevbri group.
The pooled safety data from the 2 pivotal phase 3 trials included a total of 2,920 individuals who 
received at least one dose of PreHevbri.
3.2.  Favourable effects
The two co-primary analyses were (1) non inferiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix B in subjects ≥
18 years old at Study Day 196 and (2) superiority of PreHevbri compared to Engerix B in subjects ≥45 
years old at Study Day 196. Both co-primary endpoints were met in Study Sci-B-Vac-001. These 
results of non-inferiority and superiority were consistent across key subgroups, which were enrolled in 
this study. Key subgroups were defined by age, gender, diabetes status, BMI, daily alcohol 
consumption and smoking habits. Women achieved higher seroprotection rates compared to male 
subjects in the Engerix-B and PreHevbri group. The SPR had lower values in both vaccine-arms by 
increasing age, smoking, BMI above 30 and more than 1 drink per day.
Exploratory analysis showed that SPR in the PreHevbri arm was more than twice as high as the SPR in 
the Engerix-B arm at all timepoints in the first 6 months: 16.0% vs. 7.7% at Study Day 28, 51.5% vs. 
23.9% at Study Day 56, and 66.0% vs. 27.4% at Study Day 168. Furthermore, significantly higher 
GMCs of anti-HBs were noted for PreHevbri compared with Engerix-B at all timepoints. Markedly higher 
anti-HBs titers were noted after the second dose of PreHevbri (Study Day 56) with GMC of 17.25 
mIU/mL as compared with 5.85 mIU/mL in the Engerix B arm. Anti-HBs titers peaked at Study Day 
196 in both treatment arms with higher GMCs noted in the PreHevbri arm as compared with the 
Engerix-B arm (1148.31 mIU/mL vs 192.65 mIU/mL).
At all timepoints, the rate of subjects who achieved the expected anti-HBs level ≥100 mIU/mL was 
higher in the PreHevbri group compared to the Engerix-B group. The rate of subjects of non-
responders was higher in the Engerix-B arm compared to the PreHevbri arm.
Assessment report 
Page 78/83
 
The primary immunogenicity endpoint in study Sci-B-Vac-002 of lot-to-lot consistency between the 3 
batches was met for the PPS1 and FAS population. The exploratory objective to demonstrate non-
inferiority of PreHevbri compared with Engerix-B was assessed by comparing the SPR induced by 
PreHevbri at Study Day 168 (20 weeks following the second vaccination, just prior to the third 
vaccination) and Engerix-B at Study Day 196 (4 weeks following the third vaccination). The statistical 
criterion for non-inferiority of SPR after 2 doses of PreHevbri compared with 3 doses of Engerix-B was 
met in the age group of adults 18-45 years. Higher mean GMC of anti-HBs were noted after 
vaccination with PreHevbri (pooled) compared to Engerix B after the second vaccination at Study Day 
168 (118.95 mIU/mL vs 14.99 mIU/mL) and after the third vaccination at Study Day 196 (5443.07 
mIU/mL vs 1526.26 mIU/mL). Similar observations regarding the rate of non-responders and subjects, 
who achieved the anti-HBs level ≥100 mIU/mL, were also seen in this study. The rate of non-
responder was lower in subjects who received PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
While the younger population in study Sci-B-Vac 002 aged 18 to 45 years who received PreHevbri 
achieved a SPR > 90% after two doses, PreHevbri recipients (≥ 18 years, with approximately 80% ≥ 
45 years) in study Sci-B-Vac 001 required the third dose of PreHevbri to achieve these levels of 
seroprotection. Lower mean geometric titers at each timepoint were observed in study Sci-B-Vac 001 
compared to Sci-B-Vac 002.
Immunosuppressed /immune-deficient individuals were excluded from the study. These patients may 
not be able to elicit a strong immune response to sufficiently protect them from infection. Data are also 
lacking from pregnant and breast-feeding women, as well as from individuals with unstable health 
conditions and comorbidities.
Interaction with other vaccines has not been evaluated during the clinical development programme of 
PreHevbri.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Across both studies and all subgroups analysed, local reactogenicity and to a lesser extent solicited 
systemic adverse events occurred more frequently in the PreHevbri group compared to Engerix-B 
(PreHevbri 81.4% vs. Engerix-B 55.7%). The higher local reactogenicity was mainly driven by a higher 
incidence of injection site pain (72.2% and 44.5%, respectively) and tenderness (71.2% and 44.2%, 
respectively), which were the most commonly reported solicited local adverse reactions. Severe 
solicited local AEs were reported more frequently in the PreHevbri group with 2.4% of participants 
compared to Engerix-B with 0.9%, again driven by pain 0.7% vs 0.3% and tenderness 1.8% vs 0.5% 
for PreHevbri and Engerix-B, respectively. The incidence of local AEs in subjects who received 
PreHevbri was highest following the first vaccination (69.8%). It decreased after the second 
vaccination (61.3%) and remained similar after the third vaccination (61.4%). Only the incidence of 
pruritus was highest after the third vaccination. The difference in systemic reactogenicity was less 
notable in the two vaccine groups and mainly observed for myalgia (41.7% and 28.1%, respectively). 
The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions beside myalgia were fatigue (37.5% versus 
35.0%), and headache (36.3% versus 33.2%). Severe (Grade 3) solicited systemic reactions were 
reported in 2.8% and 2.6% of subjects vaccinated with PreHevbri and Engerix-B, respectively. The 
most common Grade 3 reaction was fatigue (PreHevbri: 1.4%, Engerix-B: 1.6%).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
A higher reactogenicity of PreHevbri compared to comparator vaccines has already been observed in 
former trials. However, concerning the higher local and systemic reactogenicity for PreHevbri in trial 
Sci-B-Vac 002, it has to be taken into account that the difference might be lower than the data 
indicate. More subjects were randomized to PreHevbri in the lot-to-lot consistency study that enrolled 
younger subjects who in general showed a higher reactogenicity. Thus in the pooled data, younger 
subjects are overrepresented in the PreHevbri group.
A total of 25 Grade 4 solicited local AEs occurred in 24 subjects (14 in PreHevbri [0.5%] and 10 in 
Engerix-B [0.7%] groups), comprising 20 AEs of redness and 5 AEs of swelling at injection site. These 
AEs were not medically-attended, and, as the subjects did not seek medical attention for the events, 
the presence of skin necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis could not be medically confirmed.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Though the safety data indicate a higher reactogenicity profile for PreHevbri compared to Engerix-B 
with respect to local reactions and to a lesser extent with respect to systemic solicited AEs, the safety 
profile is deemed acceptable. The intensity of solicited AEs was mostly mild to moderate. Moreover, 
concerning the reactogenicity for PreHevbri, the CHMP considered that the difference might be lower 
than the data indicate. Specifically, more subjects were randomized to PreHevbri in the lot-to-lot 
consistency study that enrolled younger subjects leading to an over representation of younger 
subjects, who in general showed a higher reactogenicity in the pooled safety data. The evaluation of 
unsolicited AEs and SAEs did not reveal any safety concerns. The somewhat higher reactogenicity must 
be weighed against the higher immune response of PreHevbri, reflected in the immunogenicity data. At 
all time-points, higher SPRs and GMCs were measured in the PreHevbri group compared to the 
Engerix-B group, even in adults aged above 45 years, were a superior immune response has been 
shown. The rate of non-responders was lower in the PreHevbri group compared to the Engerix-B 
group. Younger adults 18-45 years of age years who received PreHevbri achieved a SPR > 90% after 
two doses compared to recipients of 3 doses Engerix-B, which means that level of seroprotection was 
reached at an earlier time point. Elderly subjects required the third dose of PreHevbri to achieve these 
levels of seroprotection.

Page 81/83
 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The safety database comprised of pooled data from the 2 pivotal trials Study Sci-B-Vac-001 and Sci-B-
Vac-002 is considered adequate. The submitted safety data did not reveal any safety concern and 
indicated an acceptable safety profile. Across both studies and all subgroups analysed, local 
reactogenicity and to a lesser extent solicited systemic adverse events occurred more frequently in the 
PreHevbri group compared to Engerix-B. This unfavourable reactogenicity is outweighed by a higher 
immune response, i.e. higher efficacy of PreHevbri as compared with Engerix-B.
Given the favourable effects concerning the immune response, a favourable B/R balance in the 
proposed indication is concluded. This conclusion is particularly relevant for individuals at risk of 
reduced immune response after hepatitis B vaccination, e.g. elderly above 65 years of age, obese 
individuals, and patients with diabetes mellitus etc. The superiority of PreHevbri in subjects with 
comorbidities was observed in the pivotal trial Sci-B-Vac 001 for the age-group 45 years and older. 
The advantage of PreHevbri over Engerix-B in subgroups based on intrinsic factors known to be 
associated with reduced immunogenicity was not evident in the age group 18-45 years (Sci-B-Vac-
002).
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
It was observed that GMC of anti-HBs titers in the PreHevbri group continued to be higher compared to 
the Engerix-B group up to day 336 (6 months after the third vaccination). The higher peak titers at 
Day 196 in the PreHevbri group in both studies were shown to translate into higher rates of 
seroprotection at one year (Day 336) at both the 10 mIU/mL and the 100 mIU/mL thresholds. 
Additionally, participants of study Sci-B-Vac-001 were recruited to take part in a study evaluating long-
term persistence of anti-HBs antibodies after vaccination with 3-antigen PreHevbri vaccine, as 
compared to Engerix-B vaccine. 500 subjects are being invited with a ratio 1:1 to provide additional 
blood samples 2.5-3.0 years after having received their third study vaccination. The preliminary results 
of this long-term persistence study were provided by the Applicant. The 2.5 years persistence data 
indicated a robust and lasting immune response for PreHevbri. It was observed that the level of GMTs 
and seroprotection rates for the PreHevbri vaccine group were higher than for the Engerix-B-group. 
Moreover, the proportion of subjects in the PreHevbri group that have retained titers > 100 mIU/mL 
was approximately two-fold compared to the Engerix-B group. 
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of PreHevbri is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.
4.  Recommendations
Outcome
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of PreHevbri is favourable in the following indication(s):
PreHevbri is indicated for active immunisation against infection caused by all known subtypes 
of the hepatitis B virus in adults. 
It can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by immunisation with PreHevbri as 
hepatitis D (caused by the delta agent) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection.

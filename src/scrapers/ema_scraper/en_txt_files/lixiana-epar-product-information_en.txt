CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Lixiana is indicated in prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular 
atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, 
age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). 
Lixiana is indicated in treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and 
for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable 
PE patients).

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism 
The recommended dose is 60 mg edoxaban once daily.  
Therapy with edoxaban in NVAF patients should be continued long term. 
Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTE) 
The recommended dose is 60 mg edoxaban once daily following initial use of parenteral anticoagulant 
for at least 5 days (see section 5.1). Edoxaban and initial parenteral anticoagulant should not be 
administered simultaneously. 
The duration of therapy for treatment of DVT and PE (venous thromboembolism (VTE)), and 
prevention of recurrent VTE should be individualised after careful assessment of the treatment benefit 
against the risk for bleeding (see section 4.4). Short duration of therapy (at least 3 months) should be 
based on transient risk factors (e.g. recent surgery, trauma, immobilisation) and longer durations 
should be based on permanent risk factors or idiopathic DVT or PE. 
For NVAF and VTE the recommended dose is 30 mg edoxaban once daily in patients with one or 
more of the following clinical factors: 
• 
• 
• 
Moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCl) 15 - 50 mL/min) 
Low body weight ≤ 60 kg 
Concomitant use of the following P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: ciclosporin, dronedarone, 
erythromycin, or ketoconazole.

following day with the once-daily intake as recommended. The patient should not take double the 
prescribed dose on the same day to make up for a missed dose. 
Switching to and from edoxaban 
Continued anticoagulant therapy is important in patients with NVAF and VTE. There may be 
situations that warrant a change in anticoagulation therapy (Table 2).

Recommendation 
There is a potential for inadequate anticoagulation 
during the transition from edoxaban to VKA. 
Continuous adequate anticoagulation should be 
ensured during any transition to an alternate 
anticoagulant. 
Oral option: For patients currently on a 60 mg dose, 
administer an edoxaban dose of 30 mg once daily 
together with an appropriate VKA dose. 
For patients currently on a 30 mg dose (for one or 
more of the following clinical factors: moderate to 
severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 - 50 mL/min), low 
body weight, or use with certain P-gp inhibitors), 
administer an edoxaban dose of 15 mg once daily 
together with an appropriate VKA dose. 
Patients should not take a loading dose of VKA in 
order to promptly achieve a stable INR between 2 
and 3. It is recommended to take into account the 
maintenance dose of VKA and if the patient was 
previously taking a VKA or to use valid INR driven 
VKA treatment algorithm, in accordance with local 
practice. 
Once an INR ≥ 2.0 is achieved, edoxaban should be 
discontinued. Most patients (85%) should be able to 
achieve an INR ≥ 2.0 within 14 days of concomitant 
administration of edoxaban and VKA. After 14 days 
it is recommended that edoxaban is discontinued 
and the VKA continued to be titrated to achieve an 
INR between 2 and 3. 
It is recommended that during the first 14 days of 
concomitant therapy the INR is measured at least 3 
times just prior to taking the daily dose of edoxaban 
to minimise the influence of edoxaban on INR 
measurements. Concomitant edoxaban and VKA 
can increase the INR post edoxaban dose by up to 
46%. 
Parenteral option: Discontinue edoxaban and 
administer a parenteral anticoagulant and VKA at 
the time of the next scheduled edoxaban dose. Once 
a stable INR of ≥ 2.0 is achieved, the parenteral 
anticoagulant should be discontinued and the VKA 
continued. 
Discontinue edoxaban and start the non-VKA 
anticoagulant at the time of the next scheduled dose 
of edoxaban.

Recommendation 
Edoxaban 
Parenteral 
anticoagulants 
These medicinal products should not be 
administered simultaneously. Discontinue edoxaban 
and start the parenteral anticoagulant at the time of 
the next scheduled dose of edoxaban. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
No dose reduction is required (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Renal function should be assessed in all patients by calculating the CrCl prior to initiation of treatment 
with edoxaban to exclude patients with end stage renal disease (i.e. CrCl < 15 mL/min), to use the 
correct edoxaban dose in patients with CrCl 15 – 50 mL/min (30 mg once daily), in patients with CrCl 
> 50 mL/min (60 mg once daily) and when deciding on the use of edoxaban in patients with increased 
CrCl (see section 4.4). 
Renal function should also be assessed when a change in renal function is suspected during treatment 
(e.g. hypovolaemia, dehydration, and in case of concomitant use of certain medicinal products). 
The method used to estimate renal function (CrCl in mL/min) during the clinical development of 
edoxaban was the Cockcroft-Gault method. The formula is as follows: 
•  For creatinine in µmol/L: 
1.23 × (140-age [years]) × weight [kg] (× 0.85 if female) 
serum creatinine [µmol/L] 
•  For creatinine in mg/dL: 
(140-age [years]) × weight [kg] (× 0.85 if female) 
72 × serum creatinine [mg/dL] 
This method is recommended when assessing patients’ CrCl prior to and during edoxaban treatment. 
In patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl > 50 - 80 mL/min), the recommended dose is 60 mg 
edoxaban once daily. 
In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 - 50 mL/min), the recommended dose 
is 30 mg edoxaban once daily (see section 5.2). 
In patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) (CrCl < 15 mL/min) or on dialysis, the use of 
edoxaban is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Edoxaban is contraindicated in patients with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and 
clinically relevant bleeding risk (see section 4.3). 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment edoxaban is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment the recommended dose is 60 mg edoxaban once 
daily (see section 5.2). Edoxaban should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) 
> 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)) or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN, were excluded in clinical studies. 
Therefore edoxaban should be used with caution in this population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Prior to 
initiating edoxaban, liver function testing should be performed. 
Body weight 
For patients with body weight ≤ 60 kg, the recommended dose is 30 mg edoxaban once daily (see 
section 5.2). 
Gender 
No dose reduction is required (see section 5.2). 
Concomitant use of Lixiana with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors 
In patients concomitantly taking Lixiana and the following P-gp inhibitors: ciclosporin, dronedarone, 
erythromycin, or ketoconazole, the recommended dose is 30 mg Lixiana once daily (see section 4.5). 
No dose reduction is required for concomitant use of amiodarone, quinidine or verapamil (see 
section 4.5). 
The use of Lixiana with other P-gp inhibitors including HIV protease inhibitors has not been studied. 
Patients undergoing cardioversion 
Lixiana can be initiated or continued in patients who may require cardioversion. For transoesophageal 
echocardiogram (TEE) guided cardioversion in patients not previously treated with anticoagulants, 
Lixiana treatment should be started at least 2 hours before cardioversion to ensure adequate 
anticoagulation (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Cardioversion should be performed no later than 12 hours 
after the dose of Lixiana on the day of the procedure.  
For all patients undergoing cardioversion: Confirmation should be sought prior to cardioversion 
that the patient has taken Lixiana as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and duration of treatment 
should follow established guidelines for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing cardioversion. 
Paediatric population 
Edoxaban is not recommended for use in children and adolescents from birth to 18 years of age with 
confirmed VTE (PE and/or DVT) event as the efficacy has not been established. Available data in 
VTE patients are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Edoxaban can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Lixiana tablets may be crushed and mixed with 
water or apple puree and immediately administered orally (see section 5.2). 
Alternatively, Lixiana tablets may be crushed and suspended in a small amount of water and 
immediately delivered through a nasogastric tube or gastric feeding tube after which it should be 
flushed with water (see section 5.2). Crushed Lixiana tablets are stable in water and apple puree for up 
to 4 hours. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Clinically significant active bleeding. 
Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk. 
Lesion or condition, if considered to be a significant risk for major bleeding. This may include current 
or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, 
known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major 
intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. 
Uncontrolled severe hypertension. 
Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants e.g. UFH, LMWH (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), 
heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, 
rivaroxaban, apixaban etc.) except under specific circumstances of switching oral anticoagulant 
therapy (see section 4.2) or when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous 
or arterial catheter (see section 4.5). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Edoxaban 15 mg is not indicated as monotherapy, as it may result in decreased efficacy. It is only 
indicated in the process of switching from edoxaban 30 mg (patients with one or more clinical factors 
for increased exposure; see table 1) to VKA, together with an appropriate VKA dose (see table 2, 
section 4.2). 
Haemorrhagic risk 
Edoxaban increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal bleeding. Edoxaban, 
like other anticoagulants, is recommended to be used with caution in patients with increased risk of 
bleeding. Edoxaban administration should be discontinued if severe haemorrhage occurs (see 
sections 4.8 and 4.9). 
In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. epistaxis, gastrointestinal, genitourinary) and anaemia 
were seen more frequently during long term edoxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, 
in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be 
of value to detect occult bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. 
Several sub-groups of patients, as detailed below, are at increased risk of bleeding. These patients are 
to be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications and anaemia after 
initiation of treatment (see section 4.8). Any unexplained fall in haemoglobin or blood pressure should 
lead to a search for a bleeding site. 
The anticoagulant effect of edoxaban cannot be reliably monitored with standard laboratory testing.  
A specific anticoagulant reversal agent for edoxaban is not available (see section 4.9). 
Haemodialysis does not significantly contribute to edoxaban clearance (see section 5.2). 
Elderly  
The co-administration of edoxaban with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in elderly patients should be used 
cautiously because of a potentially higher bleeding risk (see section 4.5). 
Renal impairment 
The plasma area under the curve (AUC) for subjects with mild (CrCl > 50 - 80 mL/min), moderate 
(CrCl 30 - 50 mL/min) and severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min but not undergoing dialysis) renal impairment 
was increased by 32%, 74%, and 72%, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function 
(see section 4.2 for dose reduction). 
In patients with end stage renal disease or on dialysis, Lixiana is not recommended (see sections 4.2 
and 5.2). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal function in NVAF 
A trend towards decreasing efficacy with increasing CrCl was observed for edoxaban compared to 
well-managed warfarin (see section 5.1 for ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and additional data from E314 and 
ETNA-AF).  
Edoxaban should be used in patients with NVAF and high CrCl only after a careful evaluation of the 
individual thromboembolic and bleeding risk. 
Assessment of renal function: CrCl should be monitored at the beginning of the treatment in all 
patients and afterwards when clinically indicated (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Edoxaban is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Edoxaban should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2). 
Patients with elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST > 2 x ULN) or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN were 
excluded in clinical studies. Therefore edoxaban should be used with caution in this population (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). Prior to initiating edoxaban, liver function testing should be performed. 
Periodic hepatic monitoring is recommended for patients on edoxaban treatment beyond 1 year. 
Discontinuation for surgery and other interventions 
If anticoagulation must be discontinued to reduce the risk of bleeding with surgical or other 
procedures, edoxaban should be stopped as soon as possible and preferably at least 24 hours before the 
procedure. 
In deciding whether a procedure should be delayed until 24 hours after the last dose of edoxaban, the 
increased risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of the intervention. Edoxaban should 
be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate haemostasis has been 
established, noting that the time to onset of the edoxaban anticoagulant therapeutic effect is 
1 – 2 hours. If oral medicinal products cannot be taken during or after surgical intervention, consider 
administering a parenteral anticoagulant and then switch to oral once daily edoxaban (see section 4.2). 
Interaction with other medicinal products affecting haemostasis 
Concomitant use of medicinal products affecting haemostasis may increase the risk of bleeding. These 
include ASA, P2Y12 platelet inhibitors, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and 
chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (see section 4.5). 
Prosthetic heart valves and moderate to severe mitral stenosis 
Edoxaban has not been studied in patients with mechanical heart valves, in patients during the first 
3 months after implantation of a bioprosthetic heart valve, with or without atrial fibrillation, or in 
patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis. Therefore, use of edoxaban is not recommended in 
these patients. 
Haemodynamically unstable PE patients or patients who require thrombolysis or pulmonary 
embolectomy 
Edoxaban is not recommended as an alternative to UFH in patients with pulmonary embolism who are 
haemodynamically unstable or may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy since the safety 
and efficacy of edoxaban have not been established in these clinical situations.

Patients with active cancer 
Efficacy and safety of edoxaban in the treatment and/or prevention of VTE in patients with active 
cancer have not been established. 
Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome 
Direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including edoxaban are not recommended for patients with 
a history of thrombosis who are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular for patients 
that are triple positive (for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein 
I antibodies), treatment with DOACs could be associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic 
events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy. 
Laboratory coagulation parameters 
Although treatment with edoxaban does not require routine monitoring, the effect on anticoagulation 
can be estimated by a calibrated quantitative anti-Factor Xa (anti-FXa) assay which may help to 
inform clinical decisions in particular situations as, e.g. overdose and emergency surgery (see also 
section 5.2). 
Edoxaban prolongs standard clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT) as a result of Factor Xa (FXa) inhibition. Changes observed in these 
clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose are, however, small, subject to a high degree of 
variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of edoxaban. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Edoxaban is predominantly absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Thus, medicinal products 
or disease conditions that increase gastric emptying and gut motility have the possibility of reducing 
edoxaban dissolution and absorption. 
P-gp inhibitors 
Edoxaban is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, concomitant 
administration of edoxaban with the P-gp inhibitors ciclosporin, dronedarone, erythromycin, 
ketoconazole, quinidine, or verapamil resulted in increased plasma concentrations of edoxaban. 
Concomitant use of edoxaban with ciclosporin, dronedarone, erythromycin, or ketoconazole requires 
dose reduction to 30 mg once daily. Concomitant use of edoxaban with quinidine, verapamil, or 
amiodarone does not require dose reduction based on clinical data (see section 4.2). 
The use of edoxaban with other P-gp inhibitors including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
protease inhibitors has not been studied. 
Edoxaban 30 mg once daily must be administered during concomitant use with the following P-gp 
inhibitors: 
• 
Ciclosporin: Concurrent administration of a single dose of ciclosporin 500 mg with a single 
dose of edoxaban 60 mg increased edoxaban AUC and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) by 
73% and 74%, respectively. 
Dronedarone: Dronedarone 400 mg twice daily for 7 days with a single concomitant dose of 
edoxaban 60 mg on day 5 increased edoxaban AUC and Cmax by 85% and 46%, respectively. 
Erythromycin: Erythromycin 500 mg four times daily for 8 days with a single concomitant dose 
of edoxaban 60 mg on day 7 increased the edoxaban AUC and Cmax by 85% and 68%, 
respectively. 
Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 7 days with a single concomitant dose of 
edoxaban 60 mg on day 4, increased edoxaban AUC and Cmax by 87% and 89%, respectively. 
• 
• 
• 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Edoxaban 60 mg once daily is recommended during concomitant use with the following P-gp 
inhibitors: 
• 
Quinidine: Quinidine 300 mg once daily on days 1 and 4 and three times daily on days 2 and 3, 
with a single concomitant dose of edoxaban 60 mg on day 3, increased edoxaban AUC over 
24 hours by 77% and Cmax by 85%, respectively. 
Verapamil: Verapamil 240 mg once daily for 11 days with a single concomitant dose of 
edoxaban 60 mg on day 10 increased the edoxaban AUC and Cmax by approximately 53%. 
Amiodarone: Co-administration of amiodarone 400 mg once daily with edoxaban 60 mg once 
daily increased AUC by 40% and Cmax by 66%. This was not considered clinically significant. 
In ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study in NVAF, efficacy and safety results were similar for subjects 
with and without concomitant amiodarone use. 
Clarithromycin: Clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) for 10 days with a single concomitant 
dose of edoxaban 60 mg on day 9 increased the edoxaban AUC and Cmax by approximately 53% 
and 27%, respectively. 
• 
• 
• 
P-gp inducers 
Co-administration of edoxaban with the P-gp inducer rifampicin led to a decrease in mean edoxaban 
AUC and a shortened half-life, with possible decreases in its pharmacodynamic effects. The 
concomitant use of edoxaban with other P-gp inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital 
or St. John's Wort) may lead to reduced edoxaban plasma concentrations. Edoxaban should be used 
with caution when co-administered with P-gp inducers. 
P-gp substrates 
Digoxin 
Edoxaban 60 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 with coadministration of multiple daily doses of digoxin 
0.25 mg twice daily (days 8 and 9) and 0.25 mg once daily (days 10 to 14) increased the Cmax of 
edoxaban by 17%, with no significant effect on AUC or renal clearance at steady state. When the 
effects of edoxaban on digoxin PK were also examined, the Cmax of digoxin increased by 
approximately 28% and AUC by 7%. This was not considered clinically relevant. No dose 
modification is necessary when edoxaban is administered with digoxin. 
Anticoagulants, antiplatelets, NSAIDs and SSRIs/SNRIs 
Anticoagulants 
Co-administration of edoxaban with other anticoagulants is contraindicated due to increased risk of 
bleeding (see section 4.3). 
ASA 
Co-administration of ASA (100 mg or 325 mg) and edoxaban increased bleeding time relative to 
either medicinal product alone. Co-administration of high dose ASA (325 mg) increased the steady 
state Cmax and AUC of edoxaban by 35% and 32%, respectively. The concomitant chronic use of high 
dose ASA (325 mg) with edoxaban is not recommended. Concomitant administration of higher doses 
than 100 mg ASA should only be performed under medical supervision. 
In clinical studies concomitant use of ASA (low dose ≤ 100 mg/day), other antiplatelet agents, and 
thienopyridines was permitted and resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in major bleeding in 
comparison with no concomitant use, although to a similar extent in the edoxaban and warfarin groups 
(see section 4.4). Co-administration of low dose ASA (≤ 100 mg) did not affect the peak or total 
exposure of edoxaban either after single dose or at steady-state. 
Edoxaban can be co-administered with low dose ASA (≤ 100 mg/day). 
Platelet inhibitors 
In ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 concomitant use of thienopyridines (e.g. clopidogrel) monotherapy was 
permitted and resulted in increased clinically relevant bleeding although with a lower risk of bleeding 
on edoxaban compared to warfarin (see section 4.4). 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is very limited experience on the use of edoxaban with dual antiplatelet therapy or fibrinolytic 
agents. 
NSAIDs 
Co-administration of naproxen and edoxaban increased bleeding time relative to either medicinal 
product alone. Naproxen had no effect on the Cmax and AUC of edoxaban. In clinical studies, co-
administration of NSAIDs resulted in increased clinically relevant bleeding. Chronic use of NSAIDs 
with edoxaban is not recommended. 
SSRIs/SNRIs 
As with other anticoagulants the possibility may exist that patients are at increased risk of bleeding in 
case of concomitant use with SSRIs or SNRIs due to their reported effect on platelets (see section 4.4). 
Effect of edoxaban on other medicinal products 
Edoxaban increased the Cmax of concomitantly administered digoxin by 28%; however, the AUC was 
not affected. Edoxaban had no effect on the Cmax and AUC of quinidine.  
Edoxaban decreased the Cmax and AUC of concomitantly administered verapamil by 14% and 16%, 
respectively. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with edoxaban. 
Pregnancy 
Safety and efficacy of edoxaban have not been established in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Due to the potential reproductive toxicity, the 
intrinsic risk of bleeding and the evidence that edoxaban passes the placenta, Lixiana is 
contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Safety and efficacy of edoxaban have not been established in breast-feeding women. Data from 
animals indicate that edoxaban is secreted into breast milk. Therefore Lixiana is contraindicated 
during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-
feeding or to discontinue/abstain from therapy. 
Fertility 
No specific studies with edoxaban in human beings have been conducted to evaluate effects on

Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of edoxaban is based on two Phase 3 studies (21,105 patients with NVAF and 8,292 
patients with VTE (DVT and PE)), and from post-authorisation experience.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions associated with edoxaban treatment are epistaxis 
(7.7%), haematuria (6.9%) and anaemia (5.3%). 
Bleeding can occur at any site and may be severe and even fatal (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 3 provides the list of adverse reactions from the two pivotal Phase 3 studies in patients with 
VTE and NVAF combined for both indications and adverse drug reactions identified in the post-
marketing setting. The adverse reactions are classified according to the MedDRA system organ class 
(SOC) and frequency, using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and 
not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Haemorrhagic anaemia 
Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of edoxaban may be associated with an increased 
risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic 
anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the 
location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9). In the clinical studies 
mucosal bleedings (e.g. epistaxis, gastrointestinal, genitourinary) and anaemia were seen more 
frequently during long term edoxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to 
adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to 
detect occult bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain 
patient groups e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant 
treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or 
prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or 
unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and unexplained shock. 
Known complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure 
due to hypoperfusion, or anticoagulant-related nephropathy have been reported for edoxaban. 
Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in evaluating the condition in any 
anticoagulated patient. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of edoxaban was evaluated in two Phase 3 studies (Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS and 
ENNOBLE-ATE) in paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age with VTE (286 patients, 
14 
 
 
 
 
145 patients treated with edoxaban) and cardiac diseases at risk of thrombotic events (167 patients, 
109 patients treated with edoxaban). Overall, the safety profile in children was similar as in the adult 
patient population (see Table 3). In total, 16.6% of paediatric patients treated with edoxaban for VTE 
experienced adverse reactions.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose with edoxaban may lead to haemorrhage. Experience with overdose cases is very limited. 
A specific antidote antagonising the pharmacodynamic effect of edoxaban is not available. 
Early administration of activated charcoal may be considered in case of edoxaban overdose to reduce 
absorption. This recommendation is based on standard treatment of medicinal product overdose and 
data available with similar compounds, as the use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption of 
edoxaban has not been specifically studied in the edoxaban clinical programme. 
Management of bleeding 
Should a bleeding complication arise in a patient receiving edoxaban, the next edoxaban 
administration should be delayed or treatment should be discontinued as appropriate. Edoxaban has a 
half-life of approximately 10 to 14 hours (see section 5.2). Management should be individualised 
according to the severity and location of the haemorrhage. Appropriate symptomatic treatment could 
be used as needed, such as mechanical compression (e.g. for severe epistaxis), surgical haemostasis 
with bleeding control procedures, fluid replacement and haemodynamic support, blood products 
(packed red cells or fresh frozen plasma, depending on associated anaemia or coagulopathy) or 
platelets. 
For life-threatening bleeding that cannot be controlled with the measures such as transfusion or 
haemostasis, the administration of a 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) at 50 IU/kg has 
been shown to reverse the effects of edoxaban 30 minutes after completing the infusion. 
Recombinant factor VIIa (r-FVIIa) can also be considered. However, there is limited clinical 
experience with the use of this product in individuals receiving edoxaban. 
Depending on local availability, a consultation with a coagulation expert should be considered in case 
of major bleedings. 
Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of edoxaban. 
There is no experience with antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid) in individuals 
receiving edoxaban. There is neither scientific rationale for benefit nor experience with the use of 
systemic haemostatics (desmopressin, aprotinin) in individuals receiving edoxaban. Due to the high 
plasma protein binding edoxaban is not expected to be dialysable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, direct factor Xa inhibitors; ATC code: B01AF03 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Edoxaban is a highly selective, direct and reversible inhibitor of FXa, the serine protease located in the 
final common pathway of the coagulation cascade. Edoxaban inhibits free FXa, and prothrombinase 
activity. Inhibition of FXa in the coagulation cascade reduces thrombin generation, prolongs clotting 
time and reduces the risk of thrombus formation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Edoxaban produces rapid onset of pharmacodynamic effects within 1 - 2 hours, which corresponds 
with peak edoxaban exposure (Cmax). The pharmacodynamic effects measured by anti-FXa assay are 
predictable and correlate with the dose and the concentration of edoxaban. As a result of FXa 
inhibition, edoxaban also prolongs clotting time in tests such as PT, and aPTT. Changes observed in 
these clotting tests are expected at the therapeutic dose, however, these changes are small, subject to a 
high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of edoxaban. 
Effects of coagulation markers when switching from rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or apixaban to 
edoxaban 
In clinical pharmacology studies, healthy subjects received rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, dabigatran 
150 mg twice daily, or apixaban 5 mg twice daily, followed by a single dose of edoxaban 60 mg on 
day 4. The effect on PT and other coagulation biomarkers (e.g. anti-FXa, aPTT) was measured. 
Following the switch to edoxaban on day 4 the PT was equivalent to day 3 of rivaroxaban and 
apixaban. For dabigatran higher aPTT activity was observed after edoxaban administration with prior 
dabigatran treatment compared to that after treatment with edoxaban alone. This is considered to be 
due to the carry-over effect of dabigatran treatment, however, this did not lead to a prolongation of 
bleeding time. 
Based on these data, when switching from these anticoagulants to edoxaban, the first dose of edoxaban 
can be initiated at the time of the next scheduled dose of the previous anticoagulant (see section 4.2). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism 
The edoxaban clinical programme for atrial fibrillation was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and 
safety of two dose groups of edoxaban compared to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic 
embolism in subjects with NVAF and at moderate to high risk of stroke and systemic embolic events 
(SEE). 
In the pivotal ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study (an event-driven, Phase 3, multi-centre, randomised, 
double-blind double-dummy parallel-group study), 21,105 subjects, with a mean congestive heart 
failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke (CHADS2) score of 2.8, were 
randomised to either edoxaban 30 mg once daily treatment group, or edoxaban 60 mg once daily 
treatment group or warfarin. Subjects in both edoxaban treatment groups had their dose halved if one 
or more of the following clinical factors were present: moderate renal impairment 
(CrCl 30 – 50 mL/min), low body weight ( 60 kg) or concomitant use of specific P-gp inhibitors 
(verapamil, quinidine, dronedarone). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of stroke and SEE. Secondary efficacy endpoints 
included: composite of stroke, SEE, and cardiovascular (CV) mortality; major adverse cardiovascular 
event (MACE), which is the composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, non-
fatal SEE, and death due to CV cause or bleeding; composite of stroke, SEE, and all-cause mortality. 
The median study medicinal product exposure for both the edoxaban 60 mg and 30 mg treatment 
groups was 2.5 years. The median study follow-up for both the edoxaban 60 mg and 30 mg treatment 
groups was 2.8 years. The median subject-year exposure was 15,471, and 15,840 for the 60 mg and 
30 mg treatment groups, respectively; and the median subject-year follow-up was 19,191 and 19,216 
for the 60 mg and 30 mg treatment groups, respectively. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the warfarin group, the median TTR (time in therapeutic range, INR 2.0 to 3.0) was 68.4%. 
The main analysis of efficacy was aimed to show the non-inferiority of edoxaban versus warfarin on 
first stroke or SEE that occurred during treatment or within 3 days from the last dose taken in the 
modified intention to treat (mITT) population. Edoxaban 60 mg was non-inferior to warfarin for the 
primary efficacy endpoint of stroke or SEE (upper limit of the 97.5% CI of the hazard ratio (HR) was 
below the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 1.38) (Table 4).

During the overall study period in the ITT population (analysis set to show superiority), adjudicated 
stroke or SEE occurred in 296 subjects in the edoxaban 60 mg group (1.57% per year), and 
337 subjects in the warfarin group (1.80% per year). Compared to warfarin-treated subjects, the HR in 
the edoxaban 60 mg group was 0.87 (99% CI: 0.71, 1.07, p = 0.08 for superiority). 
In subgroup analyses, for subjects in the 60 mg treatment group who were dose reduced to 30 mg in 
the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study (for body weight ≤ 60 kg, moderate renal impairment, or 
concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors), the event rate was: 2.29% per year for the primary endpoint, 
compared to the event rate of 2.66% per year for the matching subjects in the warfarin group [HR 
(95% CI): 0.86 (0.66, 1.13)]. 
The efficacy results for pre-specified major subgroups (with dose reduction as required), including 
age, body weight, gender, status of renal function, prior stroke or TIA, diabetes and P-gp inhibitors 
were generally consistent with the primary efficacy results for the overall population studied in the 
trial.

The HR (edoxaban 60 mg vs. warfarin) for the primary endpoint in the centres with a lower average 
time of INR in the therapeutic range (INR TTR) for warfarin was 0.73 – 0.80 for the lowest 3 quartiles 
(INR TTR ≤ 57.7% to ≤ 73.9%). It was 1.07 in centres with the best control of warfarin therapy (4th 
quartile with > 73.9% of INR values in the therapeutic range). 
There was a statistically significant interaction between the effect of edoxaban versus warfarin on the 
main study outcome (stroke/SEE) and renal function (p-value 0.0042; mITT, overall study period). 
Table 5 shows ischaemic strokes/SEE by CrCl category in NVAF patients in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48.

Within renal function subgroups, results for the secondary efficacy endpoints were consistent with 
those for the primary endpoint. 
Superiority testing was performed on the ITT overall study period. 
Stroke and SEE occurred in fewer subjects in the edoxaban 60 mg treatment group than in the warfarin 
group (1.57% and 1.80% per year, respectively), with a HR of 0.87 (99% CI: 0.71, 1.07, p = 0.0807 
for superiority). 
The pre-specified composite endpoints for the comparison of the edoxaban 60 mg treatment group to 
warfarin for stroke, SEE, and CV mortality HR (99% CI) was 0.87 (0.76, 0.99), MACE 0.89 
(0.78, 1.00), and stroke, SEE, and all-cause mortality 0.90 (0.80, 1.01). 
The results for all-cause mortality (adjudicated deaths) in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study were 769 
(3.99% per year) for subjects taking edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg dose reduced) as opposed to 836 (4.35% 
per year) for warfarin [HR (95% CI): 0.91 (0.83, 1.01)]. 
All-cause mortality (adjudicated deaths) per renal subgroups (edoxaban vs. warfarin): CrCl 30 to ≤ 50 
mL/min [HR (95% CI): 0.81 (0.68, 0.97)]; CrCl > 50 to < 80 mL/min [HR (95% CI): 0.87 (0.75, 
1.02)]; CrCl ≥ 80 mL/min [HR (95% CI): 1.15 (0.95, 1.40)]. 
Edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg dose reduced) resulted in a lower rate of cardiovascular mortality compared 
to warfarin [HR (95% CI): 0.86 (0.77, 0.97)]. 
Adjudicated efficacy cardiovascular mortality per renal subgroups (edoxaban vs. warfarin): CrCl 30 to 
≤ 50 mL/min [HR (95% CI): 0.80 (0.65, 0.99)]; CrCl > 50 to < 80 mL/min [HR (95% CI): 0.75 (0.62, 
0.90)]; CrCl ≥ 80 mL/min [HR (95% CI): 1.16 (0.92, 1.46)]. 
The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was a significant risk reduction in the edoxaban 60 mg treatment group compared with the 
warfarin group in major bleeding (2.75%, and 3.43% per year, respectively) [HR (95% CI): 0.80 (0.71, 
0.91); p = 0.0009], ICH (0.39%, and 0.85% per year, respectively) [HR (95% CI): 0.47 (0.34, 0.63); 
p < 0.0001], and other types of bleeding (Table 6). 
The reduction in fatal bleeds was also significant for the edoxaban 60 mg treatment group compared 
with the warfarin group (0.21%, and 0.38%) [HR (95% CI): 0.55 (0.36, 0.84); p = 0.0059 for 
superiority], primarily because of the reduction in fatal ICH bleeds [HR (95% CI): 0.58 (0.35, 0.95); 
p = 0.0312].

In subgroup analyses, for subjects in the 60 mg treatment group who were dose reduced to 30 mg in 
the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study for body weight ≤ 60 kg, moderate renal impairment, or concomitant 
use of P-gp inhibitors, 104 (3.05% per year) of edoxaban 30 mg dose reduced subjects and 166 (4.85% 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
per year) of warfarin dose reduced subjects had a major bleeding event [HR (95% CI): 0.63 (0.50, 
0.81)]. 
In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study there was a significant improvement in net clinical outcome (first 
stroke, SEE, major bleed, or all-cause mortality; mITT population, overall study period) in favour of 
edoxaban, HR (95% CI): 0.89 (0.83, 0.96); p = 0.0024, when edoxaban 60 mg treatment group was 
compared to warfarin. 
Treatment of DVT, treatment of PE and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (VTE) 
The edoxaban clinical programme for VTE was designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 
edoxaban in the treatment of DVT and PE, and the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. 
In the pivotal Hokusai-VTE study, 8,292 subjects were randomised to receive initial heparin therapy 
(enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin) followed by edoxaban 60 mg once daily or the comparator. In 
the comparator arm, subjects received initial heparin therapy concurrently with warfarin, titrated to a 
target INR of 2.0 to 3.0, followed by warfarin alone. The treatment duration was from 3 months up to 
12 months, determined by the investigator based on the patient’s clinical features. 
The majority of edoxaban treated patients were Caucasians (69.6%) and Asians (21.0%); 3.8% were 
Black, and 5.3% were categorised as Other race. 
The duration of therapy was at least 3 months for 3,718 (91.6%) edoxaban subjects versus 3,727 
(91.4%) of warfarin subjects; at least 6 months for 3,495 (86.1%) of edoxaban subjects versus 3,491 
(85.6%) of warfarin subjects; and 12 months for 1,643 (40.5%) edoxaban subjects versus 1,659 
(40.4%) of warfarin subjects. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the recurrence of symptomatic VTE, defined as the composite of 
recurrent symptomatic DVT, non-fatal symptomatic PE and fatal PE in subjects during the 12-month 
study period. Secondary efficacy outcomes included the composite clinical outcome of recurrent VTE 
and all-cause mortality. 
Edoxaban 30 mg once daily was used for subjects with one or more of the following clinical factors: 
moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 - 50 mL/min); body weight ≤ 60 kg; concomitant use of specific 
P-gp inhibitors. 
In the Hokusai-VTE study (Table 10) edoxaban was demonstrated to be non-inferior to warfarin for 
the primary efficacy outcome, recurrent VTE, which occurred in 130 of 4,118 subjects (3.2%) in the 
edoxaban group versus 146 of 4,122 subjects (3.5%) in the warfarin group [HR (95% CI): 0.89 (0.70, 
1.13); p < 0.0001 for non-inferiority]. In the warfarin group, the median TTR (INR 2.0 to 3.0) was 
65.6%. For subjects presenting with PE (with or without DVT), 47 (2.8%) of edoxaban and 65 (3.9%) 
of warfarin subjects had a recurrent VTE [HR (95% CI): 0.73 (0.50, 1.06)].

a  The primary efficacy endpoint is adjudicated symptomatic recurrent VTE (i.e., the composite 
endpoint of DVT, non-fatal PE, and fatal PE). 
b  The HR, two-sided CI are based on the Cox proportional hazards regression model including 
treatment and the following randomisation stratification factors as covariates: presenting diagnosis 
(PE with or without DVT, DVT only), baseline risk factors (temporary factors, all others), and the 
need for 30 mg edoxaban/edoxaban placebo dose at randomisation (yes/no). 
c  The p-value is for the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 1.5. 
For the subjects who were dose reduced to 30 mg (predominantly low body weight or renal function) 
15 (2.1%) edoxaban and 22 (3.1%) of warfarin subjects had a recurrent VTE [HR (95% CI): 0.69 
(0.36, 1.34)]. 
The secondary composite endpoint of recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality occurred in 138 subjects 
(3.4%) in the edoxaban group and 158 subjects (3.9%) in the warfarin group [HR (95% CI): 0.87 
(0.70, 1.10)]. 
The results for all-cause mortality (adjudicated deaths) in Hokusai-VTE were 136 (3.3%) for subjects 
taking edoxaban 60 mg (30 mg dose reduced) as opposed to 130 (3.2%) for warfarin. 
In a pre-specified subgroup analysis of PE subjects 447 (30.6%) and 483 (32.2%) of edoxaban and 
warfarin treated subjects, respectively, were identified as having PE and N-terminal pro–B-type 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) ≥ 500 pg/mL. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 14 (3.1%) 
and 30 (6.2%) of edoxaban and warfarin subjects, respectively [HR (95% CI): 0.50 (0.26, 0.94)]. 
The efficacy results for pre-specified major subgroups (with dose reduction as required), including 
age, body weight, gender and status of renal function were consistent with the primary efficacy results 
for the overall population studied in the trial. 
The primary safety endpoint was clinically relevant bleeding (major or clinically relevant non-major). 
Table 11 summarises adjudicated bleeding events for the safety analysis set on-treatment period. 
There was a significant risk reduction in the edoxaban group compared with warfarin for the primary 
safety endpoint of clinically relevant bleeding, a composite of major bleeding or clinically relevant 
non-major (CRNM) bleeding, which occurred in 349 of 4,118 subjects (8.5%) in the edoxaban group 
and in 423 of 4,122 subjects (10.3%) in the warfarin group [HR (95% CI): 0.81 (0.71, 0.94); p = 0.004

In subgroup analyses, for subjects who were dose reduced to 30 mg in the Hokusai-VTE study for 
body weight ≤ 60 kg, moderate renal impairment, or concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors, 58 (7.9%) of 
edoxaban 30 mg dose reduced subjects and 92 (12.8%) of warfarin subjects had a major bleeding or 
CRNM event [HR (95%): 0.62 (0.44, 0.86)]. 
In the Hokusai-VTE study the net clinical outcome (recurrent VTE, major bleed, or all-cause 
mortality; mITT population, overall study period) HR (95% CI) was 1.00 (0.85, 1.18) when edoxaban 
was compared to warfarin. 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in NVAF patients with high CrCl (CrCl > 100 mL/min) 
A dedicated randomised, double-blind trial (E314) was conducted in 607 NVAF patients with high 
CrCl (CrCl > 100 mL/min as measured by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) with the primary aim to 
evaluate the PK/PD of an edoxaban 60 mg once daily vs 75 mg once daily regimen. In addition to the 
primary PK/PD endpoint, the study included the evaluation of clinical endpoints of stroke and 
bleeding over a 12-months treatment period. 
An edoxaban dose of 75 mg QD in the high CrCl sub-group (> 100 mL/min) provided an ~25% 
increase in exposure as compared to an edoxaban dose of 60 mg QD as predicted. 
The number of subjects experiencing the adjudicated composite endpoint of stroke/transient ischaemic 
attack (TIA)/systemic embolic event (SEE) efficacy events was limited and included 2 stroke events in 
the edoxaban 60 mg group (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.1% to 2.4%) and 3 stroke events in the edoxaban 75 mg 
group (1%; 95% CI: 0.2% to 2.9%). 
Adjudicated major bleeding events occurred in 2 (0.7%; 95% CI: 0.1% to 2.4%) subjects in the 
edoxaban 60 mg group compared to 3 (1.0%; 95% CI: 0.2% to 2.9%) subjects in the edoxaban 75 mg

group. Of the 2 major bleeds in the edoxaban 60 mg group, one was in a critical area/organ 
(intraocular) and the other major bleed was an intramuscular bleed. Of the 3 major bleeds in the 
edoxaban 75 mg group, 2 occurred in a critical area/organ (intracerebral/ 1 fatal outcome) and 1 was 
an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed (life-threatening). There were also 9 (3%) clinically relevant non-
major (CRNM) bleedings in the edoxaban 60 mg group and 7 (2.3%) CRNM bleedings in the 
edoxaban 75 mg group. 
In addition to the E314 clinical trial, a prospective, multinational, multi-centre, post authorisation, 
observational study (ETNA-AF) was conducted in 10 European countries and has included 13,980 
subjects. Within this population 1,826 had a CrCl > 100 ml/min and received edoxaban 60 mg in 
accordance with dosing criteria outlined in the SmPC. The annual rates of the composite of ischaemic 
stroke or systemic embolism were 0.39%/y, and major bleeding events occurred in 0.73%/y. 
Given the totality of the data from ENGAGE AF, E314 and ETNA-AF, patients with NVAF and high 
CrCl treated with edoxaban 60 mg are expected to have an annual rate of ischaemic stroke/systemic 
embolism ≤ 1%. Increasing the dose above 60 mg in NVAF patients with high CrCl (> 100 mL/min) is 
not expected to provide more protection against stroke and can be associated with increased adverse 
events. As such, an edoxaban 60 mg once daily regimen is recommended in these patients after a 
careful evaluation of the individual thromboembolic and bleeding risk (see section 4.4.). 
Patients undergoing cardioversion 
A multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label study with blinded endpoint evaluation (ENSURE-
AF) was conducted which randomised 2199 subjects (oral anticoagulant naïve and pre-treated) with 
NVAF scheduled for cardioversion, to compare edoxaban 60 mg once daily with enoxaparin/warfarin 
to maintain a therapeutic INR of 2.0 to 3.0 (randomised 1:1), mean TTR on warfarin was 70.8%. A 
total of 2149 subjects were treated with either edoxaban (N = 1067) or enoxaparin/warfarin 
(N = 1082). Subjects in the edoxaban treatment group received 30 mg once daily if one or more of the 
following clinical factors were present: moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 – 50 mL/min), low body 
weight ( 60 kg) or concomitant use of specific P-gp inhibitors. The majority of subjects in the 
edoxaban and warfarin groups had cardioversion performed (83.7% and 78.9%, respectively) or were 
auto-converted (6.6% and 8.6%, respectively). TEE-guided (within 3 days of initiation) or 
conventional cardioversion (at least 21 days of pre-treatment) was employed. Subjects were 
maintained on treatment for 28 days post cardioversion. 
The primary efficacy outcome consisted of a composite of all stroke, SEE, MI and CV mortality. A 
total of 5 (0.5%, 95% CI 0.15% - 1.06%) events occurred in subjects in the edoxaban group 
(N = 1095) and 11 (1.0%, 95% CI 0.50% - 1.78%) events in the warfarin group (N = 1104); odds ratio 
(OR) 0.46 (95% CI 0.12 - 1.43); ITT analysis set overall study period with mean duration of 66 days. 
The primary safety outcome was a composite of major and CRNM bleeding. A total of 16 (1.5%, 95% 
CI 0.86% - 2.42%) events occurred in subjects in the edoxaban (N = 1067) group and 11 (1.0%, 95% 
CI 0.51% - 1.81%) events in the warfarin (N = 1082) group; OR 1.48 (95% CI 0.64 - 3.55); safety 
analysis set on-treatment period. 
This exploratory study showed low rates of major and CRNM bleeding and thromboembolism in the 
two treatment groups in the setting of cardioversion. 
Paediatric population 
The safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of edoxaban in paediatric subjects 
from birth to 18 years of age with VTE and cardiac diseases at risk of thrombotic events were 
evaluated in two Phase 3 studies, Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS and ENNOBLE-ATE (see section 4.2). 
The pivotal paediatric study, Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS, is described below. 
The pivotal study (Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS) was a Phase 3, open-label, randomised, multi-centre, 
controlled study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of edoxaban and compare 
the efficacy and safety of edoxaban with standard of care (control group) anticoagulant therapy in 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paediatric subjects from birth to less than 18 years of age with confirmed venous thromboembolism 
(VTE). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite endpoint of symptomatic recurrent venous 
thromboembolic disease, death as result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic burden 
during the first 3-month period (intended duration of treatment was 6 to 12 weeks for paediatric 
patients from birth to less than 6 months of age). 
The edoxaban doses tested in the Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS were established according to age and 
weight. Dose reductions were recommended based on clinical factors, including renal function and 
concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors (Table 12).

inhibitors (e.g.: ciclosporin, dronedarone, erythromycin, ketoconazole). 
A total of 290 subjects were randomised into the study: 147 in the edoxaban group and 143 in the 
standard of care control group, of which 286 subjects took at least one dose of study medication 
(mITT); 145 subjects in the edoxaban group and 141 subjects in the control group. Approximately half 
of the overall subjects were male (52.4%) and the majority of subjects treated were white (177 
[61.9%] subjects). The mean weight was 45.35 kg and the mean BMI was 20.4 kg/m2. In total, 167 
(58.4%) subjects were in the 12 to <18 years cohort, 44 (15.4%) subjects were in the 6 to <12 years 
cohort, 31 (10.8%) subjects were in the 2 to <6 years cohort, 28 (9.8%) subjects were in the 6 months 
to <2 years cohort, and 16 (5.6%) subjects were in the 0 to <6 months cohort. A total of, 28 (19.3%) 
children in the edoxaban group and 31 (22.0%) children in the control group had a medical history of 
neoplasms. The type of index event was DVT with or without PE in 125 (86.2%) of 145 children of 
the edoxaban group and 121 (85.8%) of 141 children in the control group, while the remaining cases, 
20 (13.8%) in the edoxaban group and 20 (14.2%) in the control group were PE without DVT. DVTs 
were most frequently localized in the lower extremities (50 (34.5%) and 44 (31.2%) cases in the 
25 
 
 
 
 
edoxaban and control groups, respectively), upper extremities (22 (15.2%) vs 24 (17.0%)), and 
cerebral venous sinus (27 (18.6%) vs. 21 (14.9%)). 
The HR for the edoxaban group versus the standard of care control group was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.59 to 
1.72). The upper bound of the 95% CI (1.72) exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 1.5, 
hence the non-inferiority of edoxaban versus standard of care was not confirmed (see Table 13).

Note: Adjudicated composite primary efficacy endpoint includes symptomatic recurrent VTE, death as 
a result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic burden based on imaging. 
Note: Main Treatment Period is defined as from randomization to Month 3 Visit + 3 days. 
The primary safety endpoint was a combination of major and CRNM bleeding events, occurring 
during the Main Treatment Period (3 months + 3 days). 
The safety results were comparable between the edoxaban and standard of care control groups. A total 
of 3 (2.1%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) subjects in the control group experienced at 
least 1 adjudicated confirmed major and CRNM bleeding event during the Main Treatment Period and 
On-Treatment [HR (95% CI): 0.60 (0.139, 2.597)]. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Edoxaban is absorbed with peak plasma concentrations within 1 - 2 hours following oral 
administration of edoxaban tablets. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 62%. Food increases 
peak exposure of edoxaban tablets to a varying extent, but has minimal effect on total exposure. 
Edoxaban was administered with or without food in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and the Hokusai-VTE 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studies as well as paediatric efficacy and safety studies. Edoxaban is poorly soluble at pH of 6.0 or 
higher. Co-administration of proton-pump inhibitors had no relevant impact on edoxaban exposure. 
In a study with 30 healthy subjects, both mean AUC and Cmax values for 60 mg edoxaban administered 
as a crushed tablet orally mixed in apple puree or via nasogastric tube suspended in water were 
bioequivalent to the intact tablet. Given the predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile of 
edoxaban, the bioavailability results from this study are likely applicable to lower edoxaban doses. 
Distribution 
Disposition is biphasic. The volume of distribution is 107 (19.9) L mean (SD). 
In vitro plasma protein binding is approximately 55%. There is no clinically relevant accumulation of 
edoxaban (accumulation ratio 1.14) with once daily dosing. Steady state concentrations are achieved 
within 3 days. 
Biotransformation 
Unchanged edoxaban is the predominant form in plasma. Edoxaban is metabolised via hydrolysis 
(mediated by carboxylesterase 1), conjugation or oxidation by CYP3A4/5 (< 10%). Edoxaban has 
three active metabolites, the predominant metabolite (M-4), formed by hydrolysis, is active and 
reaches less than 10% of the exposure of the parent compound in healthy subjects. Exposure to the 
other metabolites is less than 5%. Edoxaban is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp, but not a 
substrate for uptake transporters such as organic anion transporter polypeptide OATP1B1, organic 
anion transporters OAT1 or OAT3 or organic cation transporter OCT2. Its active metabolite is a 
substrate for OATP1B1. 
Elimination 
In healthy subjects, the total clearance is estimated as 22 (± 3) L/hour; 50% is renally cleared 
(11 L/hour). Renal clearance accounts for approximately 35% of the administered dose. Metabolism 
and biliary/intestinal excretion account for the remaining clearance. The t½ for oral administration is 
10 - 14 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Edoxaban displays approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics for doses of 15 mg to 60 mg in 
healthy subjects. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
After taking renal function and body weight into account, age had no additional clinically significant 
effect on edoxaban pharmacokinetics in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 
study in NVAF (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48). 
Renal impairment 
The plasma AUCs for subjects with mild (CrCl > 50 - 80 mL/min), moderate (CrCl 30 - 50 mL/min) 
and severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min but not undergoing dialysis) renal impairment were increased by 32%, 
74%, and 72%, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with renal 
impairment the metabolite profile changes and a higher quantity of active metabolites are formed. 
There is a linear correlation between edoxaban plasma concentration and anti-FXa activity regardless 
of renal function. 
Subjects with ESRD undergoing peritoneal dialysis had 93% higher total exposure compared with 
healthy subjects.  
Population PK modeling indicates that exposure approximately doubles in patients with severe renal 
impairment (CrCl 15 – 29 mL/min) relative to patients with normal renal function.

Although treatment with edoxaban does not require routine monitoring, the effect on anticoagulation 
can be estimated by a calibrated quantitative anti-FXa assay which may be useful in exceptional 
situations where knowledge of edoxaban exposure may help to inform clinical decisions, e.g. overdose 
and emergency surgery (see also section 4.4). 
A 4 hour haemodialysis session reduced total edoxaban exposures by less than 9%. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment exhibited comparable pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics to their matched healthy control group. Edoxaban has not been studied in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). 
Gender 
After accounting for body weight, gender had no additional clinically significant effect on edoxaban 
pharmacokinetics in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the Phase 3 study in NVAF (ENGAGE 
AF-TIMI 48). 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ethnic origin 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, peak and total exposure 
in Asian patients and non-Asian patients were comparable. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of edoxaban was evaluated in 208 paediatric subjects across 3 clinical studies 
(Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS, ENNOBLE-ATE, and a single-dose PK/PD study) using a population 
pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model. The pharmacokinetic data of 141 paediatric subjects enrolled in 
Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS and ENNOBLE-ATE were included in the PopPK analysis. The 
exposure of edoxaban in paediatric subjects tended to be within the range of exposures observed in 
adult patients, but there was a 20-30% underexposure in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years compared to 
adults who received the edoxaban 60 mg tablets. In Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS and ENNOBLE-
ATE, the observed geometric mean trough exposures of edoxaban in the paediatric population were 
7.8 ng/mL in subjects 0 to <6 months of age (N = 9), 8.6 ng/mL in subjects 6 months to <2 years of 
age (N = 19), 7.4 ng/mL in subjects 2 to <6 years of age (N = 36), 13.7 ng/mL in subjects 6 to <12 
years of age (N = 38), and 10.8 ng/mL in subjects 12 to <18 years of age (N = 39). 
Body weight 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study in NVAF, Cmax and 
AUC in patients with median low body weight (55 kg) were increased by 40% and 13%, respectively, 
as compared with patients with median high body weight (84 kg). In Phase 3 clinical studies (both 
NVAF and VTE indications) patients with body weight ≤ 60 kg had a 50% edoxaban dose reduction 
and had similar efficacy and less bleeding when compared to warfarin. 
Pharmocokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) 
PT, INR, aPTT and anti-FXa correlate linearly with edoxaban concentrations in adults. A linear 
correlation was also observed between anti-FXa activities and the plasma concentrations of edoxaban 
in paediatric patients from birth to 18 years of age. Overall, the PK-PD relationships were similar 
between paediatric patients from birth to 18 years of age and adult VTE patients. However, the 
variability in PD generated considerable uncertainty in the assessment of this relationship. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, or phototoxicity. 
Reproductive toxicology 
Edoxaban showed vaginal haemorrhage at higher doses in rats and rabbits but had no effects in the 
reproductive performance of parent rats. 
In rats, no effects on male or female fertility were seen. 
In animal reproduction studies, rabbits showed increased incidence of gallbladder variations at a dose 
of 200 mg/kg which is approximately 65 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 
60 mg/day based on total body surface area in mg/m2. Increased post-implantation pregnancy losses 
occurred in rats at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 49 times the MRHD) and in rabbits at 
200 mg/kg/day (approximately 65 times the MRHD) respectively. 
Edoxaban was excreted in the breast milk of lactating rats. 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
The active substance edoxaban tosilate is persistent in the environment (for instructions on disposal 
see section 6.6).

INFORMATION FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS 
•  Lixiana is an oral anticoagulant factor Xa inhibitor. 
•  When an invasive procedure is required, Lixiana should be stopped at least 24 hours beforehand, 
and appropriate caution exercised. 
•  Lixiana may increase the risk of bleeding. In case of clinically significant bleeding, stop treatment 
immediately. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Coagulation tests such as international normalised ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), or activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are not a useful measure of the effect of Lixiana. However, a 
calibrated anti-Factor Xa assay may help inform clinical decisions. 
Please consult the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for more information.

ABOUT YOUR TREATMENT 
You have been prescribed Lixiana, an anticoagulant medicine, which thins your blood and helps 
prevent you from suffering blood clots. It is important that you take your medicine exactly as 
instructed by your doctor. 
•  If you miss a dose, take it immediately and then continue the following day as normal – do not take 
double the prescribed dose in a single day. 
•  Do not start any other medications (including over the counter) without consulting your doctor. 
•  Do not stop taking Lixiana without consulting your doctor as this can increase your risk of 
developing a blood clot. 
•  Please read the Patient Information Leaflet found inside each pack of Lixiana. 
WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE 
RISK OF BLEEDING 
Taking an anticoagulant medicine such as Lixiana can increase your risk of bleeding. It is therefore 
important to be aware of the possible signs and symptoms of bleeding and to speak to your doctor 
immediately if you experience any of the following: 
•  Bruising or bleeding under the skin 
•  Blood in the urine 
•  Coughing up blood 
•  Vomiting blood or material that looks like ground coffee 
•  Nose bleeds or cuts that take a long time to stop bleeding 
•  Tar-coloured stools 
•  Dizziness or sudden headache 
•  Unexplained tiredness 
•  Abnormal vaginal bleeding, including heavier or prolonged menses  
Please talk to your doctor if you experience any unusual symptoms.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Lixiana is and what it is used for 
Lixiana contains the active substance edoxaban and belongs to a group of medicines called 
anticoagulants. This medicine helps to prevent blood clots from forming. It works by blocking the 
activity of factor Xa, which is an important component of blood clotting. 
Lixiana is used in adults to: 
- 
prevent blood clots in the brain (stroke) and other blood vessels in the body if you have a 
form of irregular heart rhythm called nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and at least one additional 
risk factor, such as heart failure, previous stroke or high blood pressure; 
treat blood clots in the veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis) and in the blood vessels in 
the lungs (pulmonary embolism), and to prevent blood clots from re-occurring in the blood 
vessels in the legs and/or lungs. 
- 
2. 
What you need to know before you take Lixiana 
Do not take Lixiana 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to edoxaban or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6); 
if you are actively bleeding; 
if you have a disease or condition that increases the risk of serious bleeding (e.g. stomach ulcer, 
injury or bleeding in the brain, or recent surgery of the brain or eyes); 
if you are taking other medicines to prevent blood clotting (e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban, apixaban or heparin), except when changing anticoagulant treatment or while 
getting heparin through a venous or arterial line to keep it open; 
if you have a liver disease which leads to an increased risk of bleeding; 
if you have uncontrolled high blood pressure; 
if you are pregnant or breast feeding. 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lixiana, 
- 
if you have an increased risk of bleeding, as could be the case if you have any of the following 
conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you have a mechanical heart valve. 
endstage kidney disease or if you are on dialysis; 
severe liver disease; 
bleeding disorders; 
a problem with the blood vessels in the back of your eyes (retinopathy); 
recent bleeding in your brain (intracranial or intracerebral bleeding); 
problems with the blood vessels in your brain or spinal column; 
- 
Lixiana 15 mg is only to be used when changing from Lixiana 30 mg to a vitamin K antagonist (e.g. 
warfarin) (see section 3. How to take Lixiana). 
Take special care with Lixiana, 
- 
if you know that you have a disease called antiphospholipid syndrome (a disorder of the 
immune system that causes an increased risk for blood clots), tell your doctor who will decide if 
the treatment may need to be changed. 
If you need to have an operation, 
- 
it is very important to take Lixiana before and after the operation exactly at the times you have 
been told by your doctor. If possible, Lixiana should be stopped at least 24 hours before an 
operation. Your doctor will determine when to restart Lixiana. 
In emergency situations your physician will help determine the appropriate actions regarding 
Lixiana. 
Children and adolescents 
Lixiana is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Lixiana 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
If you are taking any of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
some medicines for fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole); 
medicines to treat abnormal heart beat (e.g. dronedarone, quinidine, verapamil); 
other medicines to reduce blood clotting (e.g. heparin, clopidogrel or vitamin K antagonists such 
as warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon or dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban); 
antibiotic medicines (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin); 
medicines to prevent organ rejection after transplantation (e.g. ciclosporin); 
anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medicines (e.g. naproxen or acetylsalicylic acid); 
antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Lixiana, because these medicines 
may increase the effects of Lixiana and the chance of unwanted bleeding. Your doctor will decide, if 
you should be treated with Lixiana and if you should be kept under observation. 
If you are taking any of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
some medicines for treatment of epilepsy (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital); 
St John’s Wort, a herbal product used for anxiety and mild depression; 
rifampicin, an antibiotic medicine. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Lixiana, because the effect of 
Lixiana may be reduced. Your doctor will decide if you should be treated with Lixiana and if you 
should be kept under observation. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not take Lixiana if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If there is a chance that you could become 
pregnant, use a reliable contraceptive while you are taking Lixiana. If you become pregnant while you 
are taking Lixiana, immediately tell your doctor, who will decide how you should be treated. 
Driving and using machines 
Lixiana has no or negligible effects on your ability to drive or use machines. 
3. 
How to take Lixiana 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How much to take 
The recommended dose is one 60 mg tablet once daily. 
- 
If you have impaired kidney function, the dose may be reduced to one 30 mg tablet once daily 
by your doctor; 
if your body weight is 60 kg or lower, the recommended dose is one 30 mg tablet once daily; 
if your doctor has prescribed medicines known as P-gp inhibitors: ciclosporin, dronedarone, 
erythromycin, or ketoconazole, the recommended dose is one 30 mg tablet once daily. 
- 
- 
How to take the tablet 
Swallow the tablet, preferably with water. 
Lixiana can be taken with or without food. 
If you have difficulty swallowing the tablet whole, talk to your doctor about other ways to take 
Lixiana. The tablet may be crushed and mixed with water or apple puree immediately before you take 
it. If necessary, your doctor may also give you the crushed Lixiana tablet through a tube via the nose 
(nasogastric tube) or a tube in the stomach (gastric feeding tube). 
Your doctor may change your anticoagulant treatment as follows: 
Changing from vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) to Lixiana 
Stop taking the vitamin K antagonist (e.g. warfarin). Your doctor will need to do blood measurements 
and will instruct you when to start taking Lixiana. 
Changing from non-VKA oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) to Lixiana 
Stop taking the previous medicines (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) and start Lixiana at the 
time of the next scheduled dose. 
Changing from parenteral anticoagulants (e.g. heparin) to Lixiana 
Stop taking the anticoagulant (e.g. heparin) and start Lixiana at the time of the next scheduled 
anticoagulant dose. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Changing from Lixiana to vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) 
If you currently take 60 mg Lixiana: 
Your doctor will tell you to reduce your dose of Lixiana to a 30 mg tablet once daily and to take it 
together with a vitamin K antagonist (e.g. warfarin). Your doctor will need to do blood measurements 
and will instruct you when to stop taking Lixiana. 
If you currently take 30 mg (dose reduced) Lixiana: 
Your doctor will tell you to reduce your dose of Lixiana to a 15 mg tablet once daily and to take it 
together with a vitamin K antagonist (e.g. warfarin). Your doctor will need to do blood measurements 
and will instruct you when to stop taking Lixiana. 
Changing from Lixiana to non-VKA oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) 
Stop taking Lixiana and start the non-VKA anticoagulant (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) at 
the time of the next scheduled dose of Lixiana. 
Changing from Lixiana to parenteral anticoagulants (e.g. heparin) 
Stop taking Lixiana and start the parenteral anticoagulant (e.g. heparin) at the time of the next 
scheduled dose of Lixiana. 
Patients undergoing cardioversion: 
If your abnormal heartbeat needs to be restored to normal by a procedure called cardioversion, take 
Lixiana at the times your doctor tells you to prevent blood clots in the brain and other blood vessels in 
your body. 
If you take more Lixiana than you should 
Tell your doctor immediately if you have taken too many Lixiana tablets. 
If you take more Lixiana than recommended, you may have an increased risk of bleeding. 
If you forget to take Lixiana 
You should take the tablet immediately and then continue the following day with the once daily tablet 
as usual. Do not take a double dose on the same day to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Lixiana 
Do not stop taking Lixiana without talking to your doctor first, because Lixiana treats and prevents 
serious conditions. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Like other similar medicines (medicines to reduce blood clotting), Lixiana may cause bleeding which 
may potentially be life-threatening. In some cases the bleeding may not be obvious. 
If you experience any bleeding event that does not stop by itself or if you experience signs of 
excessive bleeding (exceptional weakness, tiredness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained 
swelling) consult your doctor immediately.  
Your doctor may decide to keep you under closer observation or change your medicine.

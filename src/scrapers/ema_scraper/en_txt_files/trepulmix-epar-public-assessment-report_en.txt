2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a centralised procedure application submitted under Article 10(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, with Remodulin as the reference product. Remodulin is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic 
or inherited pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), to improve exercise capacity and symptoms of disease in 
patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA class III). The applied indication for Trepulmix is treatment 
of adult patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or persistent or 
recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment (severity classified WHO Functional Class (FC) II, III or IV), to 
improve exercise capacity and symptoms of the disease. Remodulin is also available as a solution for infusion 
and the same strengths as Trepulmix.   
2.2.  Problem statement 
2.2.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a rare and life-threatening form of pulmonary 
hypertension (PH). It is thought to be the long-term complication of pulmonary embolism (PE), although the 
processes are poorly understood and likely to be multifactorial. Along with other forms of PH, symptoms are 
non-specific and mainly related to progressive right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Initial symptoms are 
typically induced by exertion. They include shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, angina and syncope. Less 
commonly, patients may also describe dry cough and exercise-induced nausea and vomiting. Symptoms at 
rest occur only in advanced cases. Abdominal distension and ankle oedema will develop with progressing RV 
failure.  
2.2.2.  Epidemiology 
Among patients with PH, the incidence of CTEPH subtype remains unknown, partly due to the difficulty in 
accurately diagnosing CTEPH and distinguishing it from other forms of PH (Edward and Mandras, 2017). 
However, CTEPH occurs in 3 out of 100 adult patients with a symptomatic pulmonary embolism (Lang and 
Klepetko, 2008), or presents with an incidence of 1% to 5% within 2 years after the occurrence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 9/65 
  
  
 
 
symptomatic PE. The median age of CTEPH patients at diagnosis is 63 years and both genders are equally 
affected; cases of patients below the age of 18 are extremely rare (Galiè et al., 2016). Specifically, using an 
upper estimate of 1-9 per 100,000 (Orphanet, 2009) adult patients, roughly half of these cases are 
inoperable (Klepetko et al., 2004), and one group's (Madani et al., 2011) observation that only 1% of the 
patients with CTEPH that had undergone a PTE surgery were children would suggest that the prevalence of 
CTEPH in paediatrics may, in fact, be below one in two million (0.05 per 100,000). 
If left untreated, CTEPH patients have a poor prognosis (Rich and McLaughlin, 2003). When mean pulmonary 
arterial pressure (PAP) is greater than 50 mm Hg, the 1-year survival rate in untreated patients with CTEPH 
is less than 50% (Lang and Klepetko, 2008). 
2.2.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
In CTEPH, the sequence of events leading to PH is triggered by single or recurrent pulmonary embolism 
arising from sites of venous thrombosis; it occurs when a clot fails to resolve completely after an acute 
pulmonary embolic event. The rate of resolution of clots after acute pulmonary embolism varies and is longer 
in patients with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease, and anatomic resolution of acute embolism is often 
incomplete, but sufficient resolution restores normal haemodynamics usually by 4 to 6 weeks after an acute 
event. To some extent, the rate of resolution depends on the initial clot burden or the size of the acute 
pulmonary embolism. If the clot fails to resolve, it becomes organised before it can be completely 
fibrinolysed; this organised thrombus is incorporated into the wall of the pulmonary artery, becomes covered 
by endothelial cells and a process of vascular remodelling starts and forms a false intima. The organised 
material occludes the vascular lumen, which increases pulmonary vascular resistance and leads to pulmonary 
hypertension. It has been reported that 52% of patients had evidence of residual emboli 11 months after the 
acute event (Nijkeuter et al., 2006). 
2.2.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Early diagnosis remains a challenge in CTEPH, with a median time of 14 months between symptom onset and 
diagnosis in expert centres. When present, the clinical symptoms of CTEPH may resemble those of acute PE 
or IPAH; in the latter context, oedema and haemoptysis occur more often in CTEPH, while syncope is more 
common in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) (Rich, 2011). Several clinical features and risk 
factors distinguish the two diseases, as briefly summarised in Table 1; CTEPH is usually confirmed by 
ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scan.

Table 1. Summary comparison of CTEPH with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) 
The diagnosis of CTEPH is based on findings obtained after at least 3 months of effective anticoagulation in 
order to discriminate this condition from ‘subacute’ PE. CTEPH is frequently found in adult patients without 
any previous clinical episode of acute PE or deep venous thrombosis (up to 50% in different series), and a 
clear understanding of why some patients resolve after PE and others do not is poorly understood (Rich, 
2011). 
2.2.5.  Management 
Surgery to remove the obstruction, pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the treatment of choice for most 
patients with CTEPH: with the advent of PEA, 1-year mortality rates from European CTEPH registry studies 
have been reported to be less than 20%, while overall operative in-hospital mortality risk is 2.2% following 
PEA (Edward and Mandras, 2017). However, since an estimated one-half of CTEPH cases are inoperable 
(Klepetko et al., 2004), there remains a need for drugs to treat CTEPH patients where PEA is infeasible or 
ineffective.  
Since March 2014, Adempas (riociguat) has been approved for the treatment of adult patients with WHO 
Functional Class (FC) II to III with inoperable CTEPH, to improve exercise capacity. There are no other 
approved therapeutic agents in the EU specifically indicated for the treatment of inoperable CTEPH.

About the product 
Mechanism of action 
The primary mechanism of action of treprostinil (a prostacyclin (PGI2) analogue) is a reduction in pulmonary 
artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance through direct vasodilation of the pulmonary and systemic 
arterial vascular beds, thereby improving systemic oxygen transport and increasing cardiac output (CO) with 
minimal alteration of heart rate (HR).  
Treprostinil, like endogenous prostacyclin (PGI2) and other active analogues, binds to the G protein-coupled 
IP receptor which is linked with adenylyl cyclase. The IP receptor is present on the surface of several cell 
types including endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and platelets (Tuder and Zaiman, 2002). 
Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is thought to be reduced via activation of the IP receptor on vascular 
smooth muscle cells resulting in increases in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and, 
ultimately, vasodilation (Sprague et al., 2008). Furthermore, activation of the second messenger cAMP 
accounts for additional mechanisms of prostacyclin action, including inhibition of pulmonary artery smooth 
muscle cell proliferation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and reversal of pulmonary artery remodelling 
(Falcetti et al., 2010; Whittle et al., 2012).  
The initially proposed indication for Trepulmix was:  
Treatment of adult patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or 
persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment (severity classified WHO Functional Class (FC) II, III or 
IV), to improve exercise capacity and symptoms of the disease. 
During the evaluation, the applicant amended the proposed indication to: 
Treatment of adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) III or IV and: 
- inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or  
- persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment to improve exercise capacity. 
The recommended initial infusion rate for Trepulmix is 1.25 ng/kg/min. If this initial dose is poorly tolerated, 
the infusion rate should be reduced to 0.625 ng/kg/min. 
The infusion rate should be increased under medical supervision in increments of up to 1.25 ng/kg/min per 
week for the first four weeks of treatment and then up to 2.5 ng/kg/min per week.   
The dose should be adjusted on an individual basis and under medical supervision in order to achieve a 
maintenance dose at which symptoms improve and which is tolerated by the patient.

2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as a solution for infusion containing 1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml or 
10 mg/ml treprostinil (as treprostinil sodium) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are sodium citrate, hydrochloric acid, metacresol, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride and 
water for injections.  
The product is available in 10 ml type I clear glass vials sealed with a rubber teflon-coated stopper and fitted 
with a yellow, blue, green or red cap respectively for the different strengths. 
2.3.2.  Active substance 
General Information 
The chemical name of treprostinil is [[(1R,2R,3aS,9aS)-2,3,3a,4,9,9a-Hexahydro-2-hydroxy-1- [(3S)-3-
hydroxyoctyl]-1-H-benz[f]inden-5-yl]oxy]acetic acid. It corresponds to the molecular formula C23H34O5, its 
relative molecular mass is 390.51 and it has the structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Structure of treprostinil 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, infrared 
spectroscopy (IR), 1H-and 13C- nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectroscopy (MS), 
specific rotation and melting point. 
Treprostinil is a white or slightly yellowish hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in methanol, 
ethanol and isopropanol but practically insoluble in water and acidic solutions. Treprostinil has no known 
polymorphic forms. The molecule has 5 chiral centres but is synthesized as a single enantiomer. The 
stereochemistry of these 5 centres is derived from that of an isolated intermediate. Optical orientation cannot 
be further changed by subsequent chemical neither by physical manufacturing processing steps; this was 
further confirmed by NMR.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
The manufacturing process consists of two main stages and a total 13 steps (different reactions). The 
selection of the regulatory starting materials is acceptable as is the control of the SM. Both SMs are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 13/65 
  
  
 
 
introduced early in the synthesis and their introduction is followed by multiple chemical transformations with 
isolated intermediates up to the final drug substance with isolated intermediates up to the final AS. Both SMs 
incorporate a stereogenic centre in their structure and are pure enantiomers. The stereochemical 
configuration of the SMs determines the stereochemical configuration of the final AS. The batch sizes have 
been clearly defined. 
Critical steps have been specified and justified as requested. The process is sufficiently described in general 
and the overall control strategy (including in process controls, testing of starting material, monitoring of 
process parameters etc.) and the risk mitigation measures are adequate to control the process leading to an 
AS of intended and consistent quality. No design space has been claimed.  
The characterisation of the AS and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with  regards  to  their  origin  and 
characterised. An adequate discussion on potential genotoxic impurities, their control and carry-over has been 
given. The threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) limit applied has been based on the actual maximum daily 
dose of the product. None of the potentially mutagenic impurities was found to carry over into the final active 
substance. This was further supported by actual analytical data which demonstrated that their levels are below 
30%  of  the  TTC  limit.  No  additional  control  of  these  impurities  is  considered  necessary.  In  addition,  a  risk 
evaluation has been performed on the potential of nitrosamine formation during the manufacture of the active 
substance,  the  manufacture  of  the  finished  product  and/or  during  its  storage  throughout  its  shelf  life.  No 
relevant risk for formation of nitrosamines was identified and no further controls need to be implemented. The 
reassurance by the applicant to further work on the risk assessment to reassure the results obtained in this 
first assessment and inform EMA is noted and is considered sufficient.  
Satisfactory validation study data has been presented for all the proposed batch sizes.   
The packaging of the active substance has been described and is acceptable. Specification for the packaging 
materials has been presented and confirmation given that the primary packaging material comply with Ph. Eur. 
chapter 3.1.3 and EU legislation for plastic materials intended to come into contact with food. 
Specification 
Treprostinil active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for description (visual), 
identification (IR, UPLC), specific rotation (polarimetry), residue in ignition (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), heavy metals (USP), enantiomer (chiral HPLC), related substances (UPLC), residual solvents (GC), 
benzene (GC) and assay (UPLC). 
The proposed specifications and limits are acceptable. The analytical methods used have been adequately 
described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented.  
Batch analysis data has been provided for 8 validation batches covering all three proposed batch sizes. All 
presented batches comply with proposed specifications; consistency of active substance has been 
demonstrated.

Stability 
Stability data on eight commercial scale batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial 
packaging for up to 60 months under long term conditions (-20 ± 5°C), and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (5 ± 3°C) was provided according to the ICH guidelines. 
Parameters investigated: description, water content, related substances and assay. The analytical methods 
used correspond to the release methods, while acceptance criteria were those at time of testing.  
At the long-term storage condition (-20°C) no clear changes or trends were seen in any of the tested 
parameters up to 60 months storage. At the elevated temperature of 5°C an increase in the levels of 
impurities was observed leading to out-of-specification (OOO) results after 6 months storage in one batch 
(for two of the impurities). After 3 months storage the levels were within the specification limits. No clear 
changes or trends were seen at 5°C for the other tested parameters. These OOS results observed at elevated 
temperature are not relevant for determining the retest period since the AS is intended for storage in a 
freezer; the retest period should be based on long-term data alone in accordance with the ICH Q1E. 
Forced degradation study 
A forced degradation study was performed where the AS was exposed to acid, base, oxidation, heat and 
photolytic conditions (ICH Q1B).  Degradation was most pronounced after acid exposure and high heat. 
Although less pronounced, some degradation was also observed after basic, oxidation, medium heat 
exposure and photolytic conditions. There are no indications from the stress studies that the active substance 
is sensitive to light exposure as the observed degradation at this condition rather seems related to the study 
temperature. However, the proposed storage precaution to store the AS protected from light is acceptable. 
Peak purity was confirmed under all conditions demonstrating the methods are stability indicating. 
Based on the presented stability data, the claimed retest period of 2 years when stored in a freezer at -20°C 
is considered justified. 
2.3.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The finished product is a clear, colourless or lightly yellowish, pH controlled, sterile and preserved solution 
practically free from particles. It is supplied as a multi-dose solution (10 ml) at four different strengths of 
1 mg/ml, 2.5 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml in 10 ml glass vials. The finished product is administered 
undiluted by continuous subcutaneous infusion via a subcutaneous catheter using an ambulatory infusion 
pump. The infusion pump system is not supplied with the product. Requirements for the infusion pump 
system that is to be used to administer the product have been laid down in the product SmPC. 
The product has been developed with reference to the authorised product Remodulin (treprostinil) solution for 
infusion  1  mg/ml,  2.5  mg/ml,  5  mg/ml  and  10  mg/ml.  The  proposed  formulation  is  essentially  similar  to 
Remodulin. 
Treprostinil has low bioavailability after oral administration. The AS is only very sparsely absorbed from the GI 
tract and can cause local irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa. Due to these characteristics a non-oral route 
of administration is preferable. 
The manufacturing process takes advantage of the solubility characteristics of the active substance. Because 
the AS is present in the finished product in dissolved form polymorphic form and particle size are not critical 
parameters. Information on the choice of the excipients and their functions in the formulation has been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 15/65 
  
  
provided. The multi-dose presentation of the formulation (to permit multiple entries for pump syringe refill) 
necessitates the addition of an antimicrobial preservative. Metacresol was selected based on its established 
use in parenteral preparations and especially its safety profile over many years in insulin preparations. The 
antimicrobial efficacy of the chosen concentration of metacresol (i.e. 0.3% w/v) has been demonstrated. 
Metacresol is compatible with the other components of the formulation and the AS is compatible with the 
chosen excipients. Sterile water for injections is used as solvent. The level of 0.3% w/v of the antimicrobial 
preservative metacresol is within the usual range of 0.15-0.3% for subcutaneous preparations according to 
the Handbook on pharmaceutical excipients. The antimicrobial efficacy of the chosen concentration of 
metacresol will also be confirmed in accordance with Ph.Eur.5.1.3 at the end of storage in the stability testing 
program. 
Well-established excipients are used in the manufacture of the FP. No incompatibilities between the 
components of the formulation are to be expected. Compatibility between the components of the drug 
formulation and the proposed packaging material was discussed and assessed as part of ongoing stability 
studies. No additional studies beyond the proposed stability testing programme have been conducted. This 
approach is considered justified as the qualitative and quantitative composition of the drug product is 
essentially similar to the reference product.  
The manufacturing process is relatively straightforward. The product is terminally sterilised by autoclaving 
using standard Ph. Eur. reference conditions (121°C for 15 minutes). Terminal sterilisation by moist heat at 
121°C for 15 minutes is the preferred sterilisation method for aqueous products. The manufacturing method 
remained essentially unchanged throughout the manufacture of stability and clinical batches at the 
development site. However, during transfer to the proposed manufacturer the manufacturing process has 
been slightly adapted. 
The in-use compatibility with the proposed polypropylene infusion pump container has been adequately 
demonstrated. It is stated in the SmPC that “The reservoir must be made of polypropylene or glass.”; this is 
acceptable. There are no concerns with regard to the compatibility with glass as the product itself is stored in 
glass vials. 
The FP is packed in 10 ml type I glass vials at a nominal filling volume of 10 ml. The vials are closed with a 
fluoropolymer-coated rubber stopper. The stoppers are secured onto the vials with a centre-tear crimped 
aluminium cap. Based on results of a stress study, it was concluded that photostability was not an issue for 
the drug product and therefore clear glass vials were adopted. The glass vials meet the Ph. Eur. requirements 
for Type I borosilicate glass. The rubber stopper conforms to the Ph. Eur. requirements for use with aqueous 
parenteral preparations. The suitability of the primary packaging materials is demonstrated by the results 
from container closure integrity testing (vacuum test) and ongoing stability studies. In addition, multi-
puncture studies have been carried out on container samples from FP batches to support in-use conditions. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The main steps of the manufacturing process are the manufacture of the bulk solution, filtration of the solution 
filling of the solution into the final containers, stoppering of the vials and terminal sterilisation in an autoclave 
using  standard  Ph.  Eur.  reference  conditions; therefore  the  manufacturing  process  is  considered  a  standard 
process. 
There are no intermediates during drug product manufacture. No critical steps were identified in the 
manufacturing process. The type of sterilisation filters has been laid down in the dossier and satisfactory filter 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 16/65 
  
  
validation studies have been performed, which address sufficiently solution compatibility and leachable filter 
material.  
The manufacturing process is considered a standard process. The manufacturing process has been 
adequately validated on three production scale batches per strength as well as on six additional production 
scale batches that are considered as supportive. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for appearance 
(clarity, colour of solution (Ph. Eur.)), visible particles (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter  (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
extractable volume (Ph. Eur.),  identification of treprostinil (HPLC), identification of metacresol (HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), related substances (HPLC), metacresol content (HPLC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. 
Eur.), and preservative efficacy (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. A Risk Analysis on elemental impurities 
according to the above guideline has been conducted by the finished product manufacturer. The 
determinations of the exposure limits were based on their parenteral Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) values. 
The elemental impurities assessment showed that all elemental impurities are well below the parenteral PDE 
limits as provided in the ICH Q3D guideline. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of finished 
product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three production scale batches of each product strength have been provided in the 
dossier, demonstrating compliance with the drug product release specification, confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Formal stability data have been provided on six production scale batches (two per strength) that have been 
manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site and were packed in the commercial packaging 
configuration. The batches were stored at 25 °C /60% RH (36 months), 30 °C /65% RH for 36 months and 
40 °C /75% RH for 6 months; only the 1 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml products. The storage conditions are in 
accordance with the ICH recommendations.  
The following parameters have been investigated: appearance, sub-visible particles, pH, assay of treprostinil, 
related substances, the content of metacresol, sterility and preservative efficacy. A reduced testing design 
has been applied; the testing design is considered justified. No differences were seen with different 
orientations. The stability results showed no clear trends or changes in any of the tested parameters at both 
storage conditions.  
Results of a formal photostability study as per ICH 1QB showed that the product in its container closure 
system without outer carton was not sensitive to light exposure. 
An in-use stability study after first opening, with repeated puncture of the vial was performed on a 1 mg/ml 
batch (representing worst-case). Supportive in-use study results with repeated puncture have also been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 17/65 
  
  
provided in the dossier for 1 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml batches manufactured at the development site showing no 
changes or trends under the same conditions. The claimed in-use shelf-life after first opening of 30 days 
when stored at or below 30 °C (SmPC sections 6.3), is considered justified based on the in-use study results. 
The product is administered undiluted by continuous subcutaneous infusion via a subcutaneous catheter 
using an infusion pump. In-use stability was investigated for the undiluted solution with continuous 
subcutaneous infusion. Except for a clear decrease in metacresol content, the data showed no trends or 
changes in any of the tested parameters. Chemical, physical and microbial in-use stability of a single 
container (syringe) of undiluted Trepulmix administered subcutaneously has been demonstrated for 72 h at 
37°C (SmPC sections 6.3). Preservative efficacy was confirmed after 72 hours at the lowest metacresol level. 
The presented stability data are sufficient to support the claimed shelf-life of 3 years without any special 
storage conditions (SmPC sections 6.3). 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing of the FP. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality 
perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and biological 
aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled 
in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
None. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.4.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

2.4.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
As treprostinil is a well-known active substance, no further studies concerning pharmacodynamic, 
pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of this active substance are required. Therefore the submitted 
overview based on literature review was considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
In terms of the Environmental Risk Assessment, using the refined Fpen of 0.000052, a PECsw of 0.00031 
µg/L was obtained, which is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.  
The applicant conducted a literature search but was not able to find a reliable log Kow value. In the absence 
of such data, PBT-assessment is not possible. Therefore, the CHMP recommended that the applicant should 
perform an OECD TG 107 test.  
This study has been initiated and the applicant should submit an updated ERA as soon as the study report is 
available. 
2.4.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP agreed that there are no objections to the approval of Trepulmix from a non-clinical point of view. 
The applicant should submit to the Agency an updated ERA as soon as the report from the ongoing OECD TG 
107 test is available.  
2.5.  Clinical aspects  
2.5.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for a solution for infusion containing treprostinil. To support the marketing authorisation 
application in the applied indication the applicant conducted a comparator-controlled, double-blind 
prospective 24-week study in 105 patients with CTEPH (study CTREPH 116-02).  This study was the pivotal 
study for the assessment of this application. 
GCP 
A routine GCP inspection at two clinical investigator sites and one CRO site was requested by the CHMP. 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Exemption  
The formulation of treprostinil solution for infusion can be considered virtually identical to the commercially 
available product Remodulin. In accordance with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, bioequivalence studies between the two products were not submitted as 
these are generally not required if the test product is to be administered subcutaneously and contains the 
same concentration of the same active substance and the same excipients in similar amounts as the 
medicinal product currently approved.

2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No pharmacokinetic studies were submitted by the applicant. The formulation of treprostinil solution for 
infusion used in clinical study CTREPH 116-02 can be considered identical to that of the reference medicinal

product Remodulin. It was therefore considered that pharmacokinetic studies with the proposed formulation 
were not necessary.  
2.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.6.  Clinical efficacy  
2.6.1.  Dose response study 
Dose response studies were not submitted by the applicant. 
The determination of target doses was based on published literature and the clinical experience of 
investigators with the use of treprostinil in PAH patients.  
Long-term data have shown a positive outcome of exercise capacity after three years at an average dose of 
40 ng/kg/min in PAH and CTEPH patients (Lang et al., 2006). A significant increase of long-term survival in 
PAH patients was observed after one year at an average dose of 26 ng/kg/min in another analysis (Barst et 
al., 2006). In contrast, doses of < 5 ng/kg/min showed no clinical improvement (Simonneau et al., 2002). 
In the study by Skoro-Sajer et al. (2007) effectiveness and safety at mean doses of 21 ng/kg/min (range: 
11-30 ng/kg/min) and 28 ng/kg/min (range: 12.5-42 ng/kg/min) at 6 and 12 months, respectively, has been 
shown. Nevertheless, in this study doses up to 100 ng/kg/min were reached after 29 ± 15 months.  
A prospective registry (Sadushi-Kolici et al., 2012), evaluating the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment 
of SC treprostinil in severe PH (N=111; 42 subjects with CTEPH) reported doses of over 100 ng/kg/min 
within an observation period of 8 years. Earlier terminations in 13 patients due to intolerable drug side 
effects, such as infusion site pain, occurred at < 6 months of treatment at a median dose of just 14 
ng/kg/min. The registry showed that it is essential to up-titrate an observed attrition rate and a 12 % drug 
intolerance rate within the first 6 months. 
Several other publications confirm that SC treprostinil requires up-titration and dose adaptions over time 
driven by clinical symptoms and objective criteria (6MWD, WHO FC, NT-proBNP) (Simonneau et al., 2002, 
Lang et al., 2006, Barst et al., 2006, Benza et al., 2011). 
The selected doses included target dose of ~ 30 ng/kg/min (high dose) versus ~3 ng/kg/min (low dose; 
comparator). A placebo-controlled design was considered not feasible due to the characteristic smell of the 
treprostinil solution and the anticipated local site reactions induced by s.c. administered treprostinil. As such, 
the low dose of ~3ng/kg/min was used as a comparator in order to facilitate complete double blinding. 
Thereafter, in the open label phase dosing was not stipulated by the study protocol but was at the discretion 
of the investigator in order to maintain a stable condition with an acceptable adverse event profile. A 
summary of the doses achieved in the open-label extension phase of CTREPH 116-02 up until the latest data 
cut-off date is summarised in Table 3.

2.6.2.  Main study 
Study CTREPH 116-02: A double blind controlled clinical study to investigate the efficacy and tolerability 
of subcutaneous Treprostinil sodium in patients with severe non-operable Chronic Thromboembolic 
Pulmonary Hypertension (CTREPH). 
Methods 
This was a double blind, multi-centre, randomised, controlled, parallel-group study in patients with severe 
non-operable CTEPH. Assessments were done at Baseline (Randomisation, start of therapy), week 6, week 
12, week 18 and week 24 (end of study).  
The study included four periods: 
-  A baseline period of 2 weeks consisting of a screening visit (Visit 1/ between day -14 and day 1) and 
a randomisation visit (Visit 2: at day 1). Both visits could be on one day. During this period baseline 
assessment were performed and baseline status for eligibility was assessed. Patients who met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria were scheduled for visit 2/ randomization 1:1.  
-  A randomized double-blind treatment period of 24 weeks in which patients received sc infusion of 
treprostinil (target dose of 3 ng/kg/min (low dose) or target dose of 30 ng/kg/min (high dose)). 
Assessments were performed at week 6, 12, 18 and 24, whereas 6MWT were performed at week 12 
and 24. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 23/65 
  
  
 
 
 
 
-  A dose reduction period of up to 2 weeks for patients who completed last visit or who had to 
withdraw at an earlier stage of the study and who did not enter the follow-up open label extension 
period. In this period the investigator created a down titration schedule (infusion pump setting). The 
down titration period did not need to take two weeks but should not exceed this time. During this 
period, the investigator was still obliged to track all adverse events which continued or started during 
this time. 
-  A follow up open label extension phase was added in order to give patients the possibility to be 
treated with treprostinil after finishing 24 weeks of the randomized double-blind phase of the clinical 
trial.

Low Dose Group: Doses were planned to be titrated to a target dose of 3 ng/kg/min. The dose was 
escalated to an approximate target dose of 3 ng/kg/min after the first 12 weeks and was maintained 
for another 12 weeks. Due to the predefined infusion rate setting schedule and the handling 
requirements of the infusion pump an interim dose of up to 6 ng/kg/min could be reached for few 
days at the end of the periods 1, 2 and 3. This depended on the patient’s exact weight and was 
caused by the limited infusion rate setting possibility of the infusion pump. This dose was anticipated 
not to have an effect on efficacy and was used as a comparator instead of placebo in order to obtain 
blinding. 
-  High Dose Group: Doses were planned to be titrated to a target dose of 30 ng/kg/min. The dose was 
escalated to an approximate target dose of 30 ng/kg/min after the first 12 weeks and was maintained 
for another 12 weeks. Due to the predefined infusion rate setting schedule a dose of up to 
33 ng/kg/min could be reached. 
The dosing schedule ensured that there were no differences in the up-titration of study medication and 
changes of vials between high dose and lose dose grouped patients in order to guarantee blinding. Patients

with the same weight followed the same dosing schedule regardless their randomization group. The vials for 
patients in the low dose group contained only solution with a dosage of 1mg/ml of treprostinil sodium while 
the strengths of the vials for the high dose group were raised continuously during the first 12 weeks (Period I 
– 1 mg/ml; Period II – 2.5 mg/ml; Period III – 5 mg/ml; Period IV-VIII – 10mg/ml). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the effect of subcutaneously administered treprostinil 
sodium on 6MWT distance after 24 weeks in patients with severe non-operable chronic thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension. 
The secondary objectives were: 
1.To assess clinical worsening defined as a decrease of 6MWT distance of more than 20% from baseline due 
to CTEPH, as decrease of NYHA functional class, hospitalization with the requirement for additional PH 
specific treatment or death due to worsening CTEPH  
2. To assess the effect on maximal Borg score, heart rate and oxygen saturation during 6MWT  
3. To assess the effect on WHO NYHA functional class 4. To assess the effect on QOL by the MINNESOTA 
instrument 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in 6MWT distance after 24 weeks. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Clinical worsening defined as a decrease of 6MWT distance of more than 20% from Baseline due to 
CTEPH, decrease of NYHA functional class, hospitalization with the requirement for additional PH 
specific treatment or death due to worsening CTEPH 
•  Change in 6MWT after 12 weeks 
•  Change in maximal Borg score, heart rate and oxygen saturation during 6MWT 
•  Change in WHO functional class 
•  Change in MINNESOTA QOL instrument 
The exploratory efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Change in pro-BNP levels after 24 weeks  
•  Change in hemodynamic parameters (PVR, mPAP, mRAP, CO, CI)  
•  Change in signs & symptoms 
Sample size 
Sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint, i.e. the 6MWT distance in walk test. Using results 
on the baseline variability in previous trials in patients with pulmonary hypertension for the 6MWT distance 
(Simmoneau, 2002, Olschewski, 2002, Barst, 2004, Galie, 2005, McLaughlin, 2006, Rubin, 2002, Hoeper, 
2006). An equal standard deviation of 83m was assumed. A sample size of 46 patients per group was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 26/65 
  
  
therefore required to detect a difference in mean 6MWT distance of 50m (effect size 0.6) at 80% power 
(when applying the 2-sided t-test for the 6MWT at the two-sided significance level of 0.05). Since an analysis 
of covariance adjusting for Baseline levels of 6MWT distance was pre-planned for evaluating the primary 
efficacy outcome the actual power was expected to be larger than 80%. 
An interim analysis was planned to be performed after 23 patients per treatment group applying O´Brien-
Fleming critical boundaries. The interim analysis had the following goals: 
a) 
if the efficacy boundary is crossed recruitment is stopped and a thorough statistical analysis will be 
performed for regulatory submissions. 
b)  If there is no positive trend at all the investigators can stop the study for futility. A stopping for 
futility is not considered when calculating for critical boundaries. Therefore, stopping for futility 
cannot inflate the type I error rate. 
c)  If neither a) nor b) occurs the study goes on. 
Sample Size Recalculation for the Stage II 
As a result of the interim analysis after 26 patients in the control group and 28 patients in the test group the 
study was continued following option c) of the goals of the interim analysis. Based on the results of the 
interim analysis it was decided to continue the study and proceed with the originally planned sample size for 
stage II of n=23 per treatment group. 
Keeping the sample size of 23 patients per group in stage II seemed to be sufficient considering conditional 
and predictive power arguments. The same statistical model has been used to derive the second stage p-
value as it was used for the first stage data. 
The study was planned with a boundary calculation using an alpha spending function of O'Brien-Fleming type.  
Overall significance-level was 5% two-sided symmetric (so 2.5% one-sided). One interim analysis was done 
when 50% of information was collected. Bound for discontinuation after interim analysis was 2.797 with 
alpha = 0.0052 (0.0026 one-sided). Bound for end-analysis was 1.977 with alpha = 0.048 (0.024 one-sided), 
which allows to control the overall alpha level below 0.05 (0.025 one-sided). 
A dropout rate of 17% was observed in stage I. Therefore, a maximum of 29 patients per group was planned 
to be recruited unless 23 patients per group were appropriate for the analysis of the primary objective. 
Recruitment was planned to stop if 23 patients per group were evaluable for the primary objective or at a 
maximum of 29 patients per group (assuming a drop-out rate of about 20%). 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio either to the low dose or high dose group. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was change from Baseline in 6MWT distance after 24 weeks, defined as difference 
between Baseline and 24 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 27/65 
  
  
The hypothesis to be tested was superiority regarding the change of the primary efficacy variable “6MWT” 
(difference between 24 weeks and Baseline) in the “High dose” group in comparison to the “Low dose” group. 
To derive a stage-wise p-value, the same statistical model was planned to be used for the first and second 
stage. A parametric analysis of covariance was planned to be used for the analysis of the 6MWT distance 
after 24 weeks using as covariate the Baseline levels of 6MWT distance. To account for repeated significance 
testing, an alpha spending function of O'Brien-Fleming type was planned to be used. 
Using a two-sided overall significance-level of 5% (2.5% one-sided), using an inverse normal function with 
equal weights (i.e., the Interim-analysis was planned to be done when about 50% of information is 
collected), this results in O´Brien & Fleming bound for the interim-analysis of 2.797 with alpha = 0.0052 
(0.0026 one-sided). Bound for end-analysis was 1.977 with alpha = 0.048 (0.024 one-sided), which allows to 
control the overall alpha level below 0.05 (0.025 one-sided). 
For the final statistical test of the primary endpoint the one-sided stage-wise p-values will be combined using 
the inverse normal function with equal weights. This means in the final stage the one-sided null hypothesis 
for the primary endpoint can be rejected if the combination test statistics Z*(2) exceeds 1.977, whereby 
and p(1) and p(2) denotes the one-sided p-value of stage I and II, respectively. 
Furthermore, as sensitivity analysis, the first and second stage data were planned to be pooled and the same 
ANCOVA model applied for the pooled data. 
In case the data were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test) and/or the homogeneity of variances 
(homoscedasticity) could not be assumed (Levene test), an additional non-parametric testing was planned to 
be performed, using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U- test. 
The main analysis with respect to the primary efficacy variable was planned to be done using the ITT 
population with missing values imputed by the last observation carried forward (LOCF). 
Supportive analysis 
The ANCOVA analysis on the pooled data was planned to be repeated using the PP population. 
In addition, analysis for the primary efficacy variable was planned to be repeated by using an alternative 
imputation rule for missing values: worst observation carried forward (WOCF) was planned to be used for 
missing values due to clinical worsening, i.e. imputing a 0-meter distance at the missing time point. 
Statistical Analysis Performed on Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The secondary efficacy variables were planned to be analysed only for the ITT set of patients. Missing values 
of the secondary efficacy variables were not planned to be imputed except of change in 6MWT after 12

weeks. The statistical tests and the resulting p-values are to be interpreted in an exploratory sense and not 
as confirmatory tests of formal statistical hypotheses. 
Data were planned to be summarized by treatment group using the following descriptive statistics: number, 
mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, lower quartile (if appropriate), median, upper quartile (if 
appropriate) and maximum. 
All secondary analysis was based on pooling the data of the first and second stage. All secondary variables 
are considered as exploratory only. No further multiplicity adjustment was planned to be performed. Missing 
data were not to be imputed, except for a LOCF imputation for 6MWT at 12 weeks. 
The following analyses were planned to be performed: 
•  Clinical worsening of CTEPH: Number of patients/group with clinical worsening were planned to be 
compared using Fisher Exact test. Separate analyses were planned to be done for decrease of 6MWT 
distance of more than 20% from Baseline due to CTEPH, decrease of NYHA functional class, 
hospitalization with the requirement for additional PH specific treatment or death due to worsening 
CTEPH. 
•  Change to Baseline in 6MWT after 12 weeks: analogous ANCOVA to primary efficacy endpoint. 
•  Change in maximal Borg score during 6MWT, difference between Baseline and Week 24: Wilcoxon-
Mann-Whitney U- test. 
•  Change in heart rate during 6MWT, difference between Baseline and Week 24: Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney U- test. 
•  Change to Baseline in oxygen saturation during 6MWT, difference between Baseline and Week 24: 
analogues to primary endpoint. 
•  Change in WHO functional class (Week 24 versus Baseline): Chi-square test 
•  Change in MINNESOTA QOL instrument (Week 24 versus Baseline): Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U- test. 
Adverse events and safety: 
Adverse events were summarised descriptively by body system and preferred term. Additional tables 
summarise adverse events by severity and relationship to the study drug, as well as separate tables for 
adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study, and SAEs. 
Physical examination findings, clinical laboratory data and vital signs were summarised over the complete 
treatment period and analysed using tests appropriate for the data (e.g. U-test, Chi square tests). The 
statistical tests and the resulting p-values were interpreted in a descriptive sense.

Conduct of the study 
There were resulted 726 documented protocol deviations of which 649 were rated as minor and 77 as major. 
Of the 77 issues rated as major protocol deviation, only three cases were confirmed as significantly impacting 
the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data in course of data cleaning session by the 
independent data cleaning board. 
One patient was included in the study even though the diagnosis of CTEPH was subsequently determined as 
wrong. In the second case the primary endpoint measurement was not performed during termination visit 
and in the third case the patient was unblinded before the primary endpoint measurement was performed. 
Data of all three patients were excluded from PP analysis.

Full Analysis (intention to treat) population: This analysis set included patients randomized who received at 
least one dose of study medication. Analyses of the primary efficacy variable was performed on the “intention 
to treat” set of patients.  
Per-protocol (PP) set:  This analysis set comprised all patients of the Full Analysis Set for whom valid data are 
available.

CTREPH 116-02 (ITT population) 
In the PP population, the mean improvement in the high dose group was 60.3 meters and 4.83 meters in the 
low dose group, resulted in a p-value of 0.00002 in favour of the high dose group. 
The interaction between the PH specific concomitant medication (bosentan, macitentan, sildenafil and 
riociguat) and dose effect of treprostinil was added to the ANCOVA model to check if the dose effect is 
significantly different between the pre-treated and not pre-treated populations at weeks 12 and 24. This 
analysis was also performed by type of PH specific concomitant medication. Whereas the effect of dose at 
week 24 remains significant in both pre-treated and not pretreated populations separately, the difference 
between the dose effects within the two populations is not significant, for all the four medication types (data 
not shown).  
Additionally, centre effect on the primary outcome was also assessed by comparing the p-values of dose 
effect between those obtained by fitting the model to the data with and without centre effect. The analyses 
showed that significance of the dose effect remains unchanged (significant for week 24 and not significant- 
for week 12) when corrected for centre effect (data not shown).

Subgroup Analysis NYHA classification 
An ANCOVA analysis was conducted to compare the effect of the dose of Treprostinil on the change of 6MWD 
from baseline after 24 weeks in different NYHA classes as subgroups. The effect was evaluated by including 
additional terms NYHA class at BL and interaction between NYHA class at BL and dose (low/high), in addition 
to dose and baseline 6MWD, that were previously included in the main efficacy assessment (Table 7). 
Table 7. Dose effects (high-low dose) in each NYHA subgroup and in the main efficacy 
assessment, 6MWT distance in meters 
Subgroup Analysis non-operability 
An ANCOVA analysis was also conducted to compare the effect of the dose of treprostinil on the change of 
6MWD from baseline after 24 weeks in the different CTEPH type subgroups. The effect was evaluated by 
including additional terms in the ANCOVA model – CTEPH operability (inoperable/persistent) and interaction 
between CTEPH operability and dose (high/low) in addition to baseline 6MWD (BL) and dose (high/low) 
(Table 8) and a Forest plot was generated to visualise the differences in change from BL after 24 weeks in 
6MWD by CTEPH subgroup (Figure 3).

Secondary endpoints 
Clinical worsening 
Clinical worsening was defined as a reduction of 6MWD of 20% compared to baseline, worsening of WHO 
NYHA functional class and/or hospitalization due to CTEPH with the need of additional PH specific treatment 
(including additional diuretics therapy) or death due to worsening CTEPH. 
Two subjects in the high dose and seven in the low dose group showed a reduction of more than 20 % in 
6MWT. Two subjects in the high dose and four in low dose group experienced a worsening of WHO NYHA 
functional class and four subjects in the high dose and six subjects in the low dose group had to be 
hospitalized due to CTEPH during study period and needed additional PH specific treatment. None of these 
patients needed additional vasodilators but received diuretic treatment. In total seven subjects receiving high 
dose treprostinil and twelve subjects receiving low dose treprostinil developed a clinical worsening during the 
study period (p=0.189). 
Change in 6MWT after 12 weeks 
The improvement in 6MWT between baseline and week 12 was 32.7 meters in high dose subjects and 27.31 
meters in low dose subjects (ANCOVA p=0.72, Mann-Whitney U-test p=0.27).  
Change in maximal Borg score, heart rate and oxygen saturation during 6MWT 
The Borg Dyspnoea Score (measured during the 6MWT) was reduced by 0.44 score points in high dose group 
and 0.13 points in low dose group. A trend for reduction of the Borg Dyspnoea Score could be evaluated in 
both treatment groups but the difference was not clinically relevant (Mann-Whitney-U p=0.307). 
Change in NYHA class 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020

An improvement in NYHA (WHO) functional class was observed in 27 subjects (50.9 %) of the high dose 
group and in 9 subjects (17.3 %) of the low dose group whereas 2 subjects ( 3.8 %) experienced a 
worsening of NYHA functional class in the high dose group and 3 subjects (5.8 %) in the low dose group (Chi-
square: p=0.0019; Fisher exact test: p=0.0012). No change was reported in 22 subjects (41.5%) vs. 36 
subjects (69.2%) in the high and low dose group, respectively. These results are summarised by dose group 
in Table 9.

Change in MINNESOTA QOL instrument 
There was no clinically relevant change in the score sum of quality of life assessment by Minnesota Living 
with Heart Failure Questionnaire.  
Exploratory endpoints 
Treatment with a high dose of treprostinil resulted in significant improvements in haemodynamic parameters 
compared with the low dose. Mean pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) decreased by a mean of 214.23 
dyn.s.cm-5 (-25.3%) in the high dose and increased by 72.96 dyn.s.cm-5 (+9.02%) in the low dose group. 
Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) decreased by a mean of 3.36 mm Hg (-6.7%) in the high dose and 
by 0.4 mm Hg (-0.80%) in the low dose group. Mean cardiac output (CO) increased by 0.63 L/min (+14.7%) 
in high dose subjects and decreased by 0.22 L/min (-5.0%) in low dose subjects. Mean cardiac index (CI) 
increased by 0.42 L/min/m² (+18.5%) in the high dose and decreased by 0.16 L/min/m² (-7.0%) in the low 
dose group. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which was evaluated in only 65 patients, decreased by a 
mean of 362.74 dyn.s.cm-5 (-19.6%) in the high dose group and increased by a mean of 40.4 dyn.s.cm-5 
(+2.4%) in the low dose group. No differences were found in right atrial pressure (RAP) and pulmonary 
capillary wedge (PCWP). 
Furthermore, in the high dose group, a slight deterioration in pro-BNP of 0.84% vs an increase of 41.68 % in 
the low group was observed.

Open label extension phase 
In total 51 patients were enrolled in stage II in the blinded phase. 47 patients were eligible to participate the 
open-label extension phase and gave consent for the follow-up treatment. In total 27 patients (10 former 
high dose / 17 former low dose) withdrew from the follow-up phase until data collection break (31st October 
2018).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Table 11. Summary of age classes by dose 
An ANCOVA analysis was conducted to compare the effect of age class on the observed dose effect of 
Treprostinil, i.e. on the change of 6MWD from baseline (BL) after 24 weeks. The effect was evaluated by 
including additional terms age class and interaction between age class and dose (low/high), in addition to 
dose (low/high) and baseline 6MWD, that were previously included in the model within the main efficacy 
assessment. 
The effect of age class on the dose effect was not statistically significant (as p-value of interaction between 
“age class” and “dose” was 0.1543), suggesting that the effect of dose on the 6MWT outcome was not 
impacted by patients` age class. This is also confirmed by non-significant difference in dose effects between 
the age class subgroups at 24 weeks. After 24 weeks a significant dose effect in the age class 75+ was 
detected, whereas the dose effect in the age class 65-74 showed non-significant p-value. 
Supportive studies 
Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 
The study was a prospective non-controlled open-label phase II study to investigate the effect of up to 24 
months treatment of treprostinil s.c. in 25 patients with severe inoperable CTEPH (WHO functional class III or 
IV).  
Criteria for inclusion were inoperable CTEPH (distal disease or persistent/recurrent PH following PEA, and 
severe comorbidities precluding a surgical approach) in WHO functional classes (as modified for PAH from the 
New York Heart Association classification) III and IV, 6-MWD ≤ 380 m and at least one hospitalisation for 
right heart decompensation within the previous six months, not within one month before treatment start, 
mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) > 25 mmHg, a PVR > 500 dynes.s.cm-5, in the presence of a 
pulmonary wedge pressure < 15 mmHg. 
A historical group of 31 patients (diagnosed between September 1994 and September 1999, and who did not 
receive any specific PH medication) matched for disease severity by haemodynamic assessment, WHO 
functional class and 6-MWD served for comparative survival analyses.  
With respect to the dose, patients started at 2 ng/kg/min and doses were increased over 12 weeks to a 
maximum dose with an acceptable side effect profile. Dose adjustments were performed every three months 
from then on and were based on signs and symptoms of PH. Infusion site changes were performed every 26 
± 8 days. 
Patients were followed for a mean period of 24 ± 18 months (range: 6-72 months). Mean treprostinil dose at 
six months was 21 ± 5 ng.kg-1.min-1 (range: 11-30 ng/kg/min). Functional class improved in 13 patients and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020

was unchanged in 12 patients. At 6 months, treprostinil therapy resulted in a mean increase in 6MWD of 59 
m compared to baseline (260 ± 111 m at baseline and 319 ± 117 m at follow up, p= 0.01). WHO functional 
class improved in 13 patients and was unchanged in 12 patients (P ≤ 0.001). 
At 12 months, the mean treprostinil dose was 28 ± 10 ng/kg/min (range: 12.5–42 ng/kg/min, n= 19). The 
mean increase in the 6MWD was 105 m (from 271 ± 107 to 376 ± 89 m). Five patients were classified as 
functional class II, 13 patients remained in class III and one patient in class IV. 
Furthermore, treprostinil therapy was associated with significant improvements in cardiac output (CO; 3.8 ± 
0.9 to 4.6 ± 1.5 L min-1, P = 0.007), CI (2.1 ± 0.5 to 2.4 ± 0.6 L min-1 m-2, P = 0.02) and PVR (924.6 ± 
347 to 808.1 ± 372.5 dynes s cm-5, P = 0.01), whereas systolic PAP, diastolic PAP and MPAPs did not change 
significantly from baseline. BNP plasma levels had decreased from 270 ± 197 pg/mL to 180 ± 78 pg/mL 
(p=0.02). Changes in BNP plasma levels correlated with changes in functional class (r = 0.407, P < 0.01) 
and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.46, P < 0.05). 
Kaplan-Meyer survival estimates for the treprostinil treated patients and the historical controls are shown in 
Figure 6.    
Figure 6. Survival rates of inoperable CTEPH patients, Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 
Notes: Kaplan–Meier survival estimates in 25 patients with inoperable CTEPH, starting at the initiation of treprostinil 
therapy. For comparison, survival data are also shown for an untreated control group with inoperable CTEPH matched for 
disease severity, who did not receive vasodilator therapy.  
In the group of patients treated with treprostinil the overall survival rates at one, two, three and five years 
were 80%, 80%, 80% and 53%, respectively, compared with 67%, 43%, 37% and 16% (p = 0.02). In the 
univariate and multivariate analyses, baseline functional class and treprostinil treatment were predictors of 
survival. While class IV was associated with high overall mortality, treprostinil treatment significantly reduced 
the risk of death in these patients. These associations were independent of gender, age, PVR, CI or 6-MWD.

Lang et al., 2006 
This was a multicentre retrospective non-controlled study to investigate the effect of s.c. infused treprostinil 
in the treatment of PAH and CTEPH.  
Patients with either PAH or distal CTEPH were considered for analysis. Diagnosis was established according to 
standard criteria, including a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest, a pulmonary 
capillary wedge pressure < 15 mm Hg, and a pulmonary vascular resistance > 3 Wood units.  
With respect to dose, treprostinil sodium was initiated in the hospital at a starting dose of 1.25 to 4 
ng/kg/min and up-titrated in an outpatient setting at least once a week by dose increment of 1.25 ng/kg/min 
with a target dose of at least 20 ng/kg/min at 3 months. Further increments were essentially governed by 
symptom progression and/or side effects. All changes in conventional therapy were monitored and recorded. 
In this long-term study of patients with PAH (n=99) and CTEPH (n=23), treprostinil showed improvements in 
NYHA-FC scores, exercise capacity and survival when compared with historical data for untreated patients. At 
3 years, significant improvements from baseline were observed in mean 6MWD (305 ± 11 to 444 ± 29 m, 
p=0.0001), Borg dyspnoea score (5.7 ± 0.3 to 5.2 ± 1.5, p=0.0006), and NYHA class (3.20 ± 0.04 to 2.1 ± 
0.1, p=0.0001). These changes were observed under a mean dose of subcutaneously-infused treprostinil at 
40 ± 2.6 ng/kg/min (range, 16 to 84 ng/kg/min). 
Survival rates by Kaplan Meier analysis reached 88.6%, 70.6%, and 65.6% after 1 year, 3 years, and 4 
years, respectively. The probability of event-free survival, defined as survival without hospitalization for 
clinical worsening, transition to IV epoprostenol, and need for combination therapy or atrial septostomy, were 
similar to overall survival rate.  
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is based on efficacy data obtained from the pivotal phase III study CTREPH 116-02. 
Additional data came from two published open-label non-controlled clinical studies (Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 
and Lang et al., 2006).  
The selection of the high target dose (~30 ng/kg/min) and the low target dose (~3 ng/kg/min) used in the 
pivotal study is based on published literature (both in patients with CTEPH and PAH) and clinical experience 
of investigators with the use in PAH patients; this is acceptable, considering the similar pathophysiologic and 
clinical features of CTEPH and PAH. The dose will be up-titrated according to a predefined infusion rate 
setting schedule to improve tolerability (e.g. hypotension). Moreover, the predefined infusion rate setting 
schedule, which has also been proposed in the SmPC, is in line with the recommended posology for 
Remodulin (treprostinil) for the treatment of PAH and therefore acceptable. 
The low dose of 3 ng/kg/min, which did not show clinical improvement in patients with PAH, has been used 
as a comparator since it was considered not feasible to conduct a placebo controlled design due to the 
characteristic smell of the treprostinil solution and the anticipated local site reactions induced by s.c. 
administered treprostinil; this approach is considered appropriate.  
According to the Applicant, the maximum dose for treprostinil is not strictly defined as patients are titrated to 
a dose where symptoms improve but treprostinil is still tolerable. The SmPC proposes no maximum dose 
which is in line with that of the reference product Remodulin. The Applicant provided data from the open label 
phase of CTREPH 116-02 in which treprostinil was up-titrated to doses of up to 53.84 ng/kg/min which was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 42/65 
  
  
required to maintain stable condition with an acceptable adverse event profile. Additional information in 
support of the maximum dose, was provided by the studies of Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 and Sadushi-Kolici et 
al., 2012 in which doses up to 100 ng/kg/min were reached. The CHMP noted that there is no defined 
maximum dose for treprostinil in PAH but it is rather adjusted on an individual basis and under medical 
supervision. As there is no evidence to suggest that the adverse event profile of treprostinil is different 
between CTEPH and PAH the CHMP considered the omission of a maximum dose acceptable. 
General inclusion /exclusion criteria of the pivotal study were generally appropriate to reflect inoperable 
CTEPH patients or persistent or recurrent CTEPH patients for whom an indication is sought. The CHMP 
however noted that persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment and WHO Functional Class (FC) II 
and IV were underrepresented in the main clinical program (see also section Efficacy data and additional 
analyses). 
The design of the CTREPH 116-02 study is appropriate to address the objective of the study. The double-blind 
treatment period of 24 weeks is sufficient to evaluate efficacy of s.c. infusion of treprostinil of ~30 ng/kg/min 
(high dose arm) vs ~3 ng/kg/min (low dose arm; comparator), although the treatment period of 24 weeks 
may be considered limited for information on long term efficacy and safety of treprostinil. For long-term 
maintenance of effect reference is made to the two published studies of Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 and Lang et 
al., 2007. Inclusion of a dose reduction period at the end of the study is considered appropriate given the 
rebound effects of pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, a follow-up open label extension phase was present 
in order to give the patients the possibility to be treated with treprostinil after finishing the treatment period 
of 24 weeks provides additional support on the long-term efficacy of treprostinil.  
The efficacy primary endpoint was the change from baseline in 6MWT distance after 24 weeks, which is 
considered appropriate for the claim of the orphan CTEPH indication for improvement of exercise capacity. As 
the relevant CHMP guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008) does not specifically address CTEPH, 
developing a clinical program in line with that recommended for PAH products is acceptable due to the 
disease similarities. This guideline indicates that the 6MWT can be used as a primary endpoint when the 
proposed indication is restricted to exercise capacity, if no negative impact on survival is observed. Further, 
the use of other clinical endpoints is encouraged to support the findings of the primary analysis.  
The investigated secondary endpoints of clinical worsening, change in 6MWT after 12 weeks, change in Borg 
score, heart rate and oxygen saturation during 6MWT, change in NYHA/WHO FC, and MINNESOTA QOL are 
relevant and provide further insight on the effects of the drug under investigation and are in line with the 
CHMP guideline EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008. However, as the secondary endpoints were not controlled 
for multiplicity they will be considered as exploratory. 
The analysis populations and the statistical analysis of primary and secondary endpoints were considered 
acceptable. Missing data were handled with LOCF (or BOCF if only baseline measurement was available), 
which is not the most appropriate method for imputing missing data in this setting since it assumes 
treatment effects remain stable. However, sensitivity analyses using other imputation methods (data not 
shown) also resulted in statistically significant differences, with the more conservative methods leading to 
smaller differences. 
The planned interim analysis was performed twice because the first was not performed according to protocol. 
Furthermore, after the first performance of the interim analysis, several changes were made to the protocol. 
Although this practice is not ideal, the applicant confirmed that the blind was not broken except for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 43/65 
  
  
 
interim analysis statistician and any protocol amendments were the result of a careful review of the protocol, 
SAP and interim analysis report, leading to clarifications. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the primary analysis, treatment with a high dose of treprostinil resulted in a significant improvement in 
6MWT from baseline to week 24 as compared to low dose in the ITT analysis set ( 41.6 m, ANCOVA p=0.002; 
Mann-Whitney U-test p=0.0003) from a baseline level of 308 m and 299 m for the high and low dose group, 
respectively. This increase is comparable to the 6MWT results observed for riociguat of 46 m from a baseline 
level of approximately 350 m after 16 weeks of treatment also in patients with CTEPH, although more 
patients with NYHA II were included. Subgroup analyses regarding concomitant therapy PH medication, 
showed a consistent beneficial effect in 6MWD. Additionally, primary outcome analysis regarding centre effect 
showed that significance of the dose effect remains unchanged (significant for week 24 and not significant- 
for week 12) when corrected for centre effect. At 12 weeks of treatment, the increase in 6MWT from baseline 
was not significant different between the high and low dose group (32.7 m vs 27.31 m, respectively; ANCOVA 
p=0.72, Mann-Whitney U-test p=0.27).  
Treatment with treprostinil also resulted in a trend of a beneficial effect in other secondary or exploratory 
endpoints. 11 patients (6 low dose / 5 high dose) developed clinical worsening during the study and needed 
additional treatment. In all cases, additional diuretics were added to treat the clinical worsening symptoms. 
The subgroup without additional diuretic treatment had a slightly better 6MWT outcome after 24 weeks 
compared to the full analysis set. The difference is not considered large enough to have substantially 
influenced the overall results. 
Further, significant improvements are also shown in WHO functional class with 27 subjects (50.9 %) of the 
high dose group and in 9 subjects (17.3 %), whereas 2 subjects (3.8 %) experienced a deterioration  of 
NYHA functional class in the high dose group and 3 subjects (5.8 %) in the low dose group (Chi-square: 
p=0.0019; Fisher exact test: p=0.0012). 
The beneficial effect of treprostinil was further supported by improvements in haemodynamic parameters 
(exploratory endpoint). PVR shows a reduction of -25.3% in the high dose group (vs +9.02% in the low dose 
group), PAP a reduction of -6.7% (vs -0.80% in the low dose group), whereas CO was increased by +14.7 % 
(vs -5.0% in the low dose group) and CI by +18.5% (vs -7.0 % in the low dose group). With respect to pro-
BNP, in the high dose group, a slight deterioration of +0.84% vs +41.68 % in the low group was observed, 
which is reassuring. 
Other clinical measurements like QOL and Borg Dyspnoea score also showed a non-significant positive trend 
for treprostinil treatment.  
The applicant had initially applied to include “to improve symptoms of the disease” as part of the indication of 
the product. However, this was not supported by the available data in which an effect was observed only for 
functional class, whereas the effects on clinical worsening and QOL only showed a trend for improvement. 
Moreover, type I error was only controlled at the primary endpoint level (exercise capacity as measured by 
6MWT and there was no formal hypothesis testing for the other component; symptoms of the disease. The 
claim “to improve symptoms of the disease” was therefore not considered justified by the CHMP. This 
statement was then removed from the claimed indication. 
Several subgroup analyses were performed in the different sub-populations of the initially claimed indication.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 44/65 
  
  
Only 6 subjects (5.7%) with WHO NYHA class II were included, while according to the inclusion criteria only 
patients with FC III or IV should be enrolled in study CTREPH 116-02. This was due to the fact that in the 
first stage of the CTREPH study the study protocol stipulated to include patients with severe CTEPH but NYHA 
classification was not part of the inclusion/exclusion assessment. The number of patients with NYHA IV 
included in the study was also low (three patients received the therapeutic dose in the NYHA Class IV 
subgroup, and five the sub-therapeutic low dose), and this can possibly be explained by the fact that patients 
had to be capable of walking for enrolment in the study, while a significant proportion of patients in NYHA IV 
are confined to bed or not able to walk at least 150 m in 6 minutes. 
The effect of the dose of treprostinil on the change of 6MWD from baseline after 24 weeks in different NYHA 
classes and the different CTEPH type subgroups was also investigated.  
This analysis showed a comparable effect in favour of the high dose group in all three NYHA classes. The wide 
confidence intervals for NYHA classes 2 and 4 reflected the small sample sizes in these subgroups. 
Nevertheless, a trend for positive treatment effect was detected in both subgroups. 
The effect of CTEPH type (inoperable/persistent) on the dose effect was not statistically significant (as p 
value of the interaction between “dose” and CTEPH operability was 0.7280) suggesting that the effect of dose 
on the 6MWT outcome is not impacted by patient`s operability classification and comparable dose effect in 
favour of the high dose group was observed in all three CTEPH types. In patients with an inoperable CTEPH 
the EMMs difference showed a significant effect (p=0.0016) in comparison to patients with a persistent 
CTEPH, but it was considered that this difference might be due to the small sample size. Overall, it was 
agreed that available evidence supported the use of Trepulmix in persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical 
treatment. 
The small number of WHO NYHA class II patients included in the study and available data in this sub-
population is too limited to draw conclusions about efficacy and safety in this sub-group. Taking also into 
account the available clinical guideline from the European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society 
(ESC/ERS) guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of PH, which does not recommend prostacyclin 
treatment for NYHA II patients (Galie et al. 2015), the applicant agreed to exclude patients with NYHA class 
II from the indication. 
The number of patients with NYHA IV included in the study was also low and this could possibly be explained 
by the fact that patients had to be capable of walking for enrolment in the study, while patients in NYHA IV 
are commonly confined in bed or not able to walk at least 150 m in 6 minutes. The CHMP noted that 
treatment options are very limited in patients in this subgroup of patients. Moreover, efficacy in this subgroup 
was also supported by literature data (Lang et al 2006) with all available results suggestive of consistent 
treatment effect between WHO FC III and FC IV. The CHMP concluded that patients with WHO FC III and IV 
should therefore be included in the target population for Trepulmix. 
Evidence of longer-term efficacy for the use of treprostinil in CTEPH comes from the open- label extension 
phase of the pivotal trial, which included 47 patients. The change in 6 MWT results from BL-E were analysed 
by 6-monthly periods on the FAS-FU population. A significant positive change from BL-Ein 6MWT was 
observed for the FAS-FU population all across the period between 6 months and 36 months (p-value < 
0.0227). 
The small prospective open-label uncontrolled study of 25 subjects with inoperable CTEPH (Skoro-Sajer et al. 
2009) supports the beneficial effect of treprostinil in 6MWD observed in the CTREPH 116-02 study but also 
provides some evidence of long term maintenance of the effect of treprostinil in 6MWD and beneficial effect 
on clinical outcomes, i.e. survival rates, compared with historical controls (overall survival rates at one, two, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020

three and five years of  80%, 80%, 80% and 53% compared with 67%, 43%, 37% and 16%, respectively (p 
= 0.02). In the study of Lang et al. which was retrospectively performed and included both PAH and CTEPH 
patients long term maintenance of effect was also observed. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The use of treprostinil in CTEPH is supported by one pivotal phase III study and two published open-label 
studies in which efficacy is well established in terms of improvement in exercise capacity. The beneficial 
effect of treprostinil is further supported by improvements in NYHA class, haemodynamic parameters, and 
pro-BNP. The long-term maintenance of effect of treprostinil in CTEPH is supported by available data from the 
open-label extension phase of the pivotal study and one small prospective open-label uncontrolled study from 
the literature. 
2.6.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Study CTREPH 116-02 
In this study, 105 CTEPH patients were divided into a high dose group (n=53) and a low dose group (n= 52) 
and treated up to 24 weeks. The mean exposure was 22.8 weeks in the high dose and 22.5 weeks in the low 
dose groups. 
After 12 weeks, patients in the high dose group reached a mean dose of treprostinil of 29.15 ng/kg/min, 
whereas patients in the low dose group reached a mean dose of 2.99 ng/kg/min. After 24 weeks, the mean 
dose of treprostinil in the high dose group was 29.11 ng/kg/min (Table 12).

The target dose of 30 ng/kg/min was achieved by 27 out of 53 patients (50.9%) randomized to the high dose 
group. One patient was excluded prior week 12 and was therefore not up-titrated to the target dose at time 
of withdrawal. Eleven patients experienced adverse drug reactions (infusion site pain) leading to decrease of 
the infusion rate. Five patients gained weight within study period without adaptation of the dose. Nine 
patients didn’t achieve the target dose due to limitation of infusion rate settings.

Open-label extension phase (data cut-off: 31st October 2018) 
47 patients were eligible to participate the open- label extension phase and gave consent for the follow-up

In the study of Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007, actual patient exposure was not reported in the study but can be 
assumed from a maximal continuous exposure in 25 CTEPH patients to a 30 ng/kg/min continuous SC 
infusion for 24 months. 
In the study of Lang et al., 2006, actual patient exposure was not reported in the study, but worst-case 
exposure can be estimated assuming 99 PAH and 23 CTEPH (122 total) patients to a 40 ng/kg/min 
continuous SC infusion for 36 months.

Most of the AEs observed during the study were mild (low dose: 139/220 (63.2%), high dose: 182/293 
(62.1%)) or moderate (low dose: 68/220 (30.9%), high dose: 87/293 (29.7%)) in intensity. Twelve AEs in 
the low dose (5.5%) and 21 AEs (7.2%) in the high dose group were severe in intensity.  
Most of the TEAEs (190/513 = 37.0%) came from the “General disorders and administration site conditions 
system organ class” (SOC), with “infusion site pain” being the most commonly reported (95/513 = 18.5%) 
preferred term (PT).  
Treatment related AEs 
In study CTREPH 116-02, 273 TEAEs were classified as related to the study drug (low dose: 118, high dose: 
155) (Table 15).

Open-label extension phase (data cut-off: 31st October 2018) 
106 TEAEs were classified as related to the study drug and reported for 26 out of 47 patients in the open-
label extension phase. Most frequently infusion site pain (19.8%), other infusion site reactions (29.2%), 
diarrhoea (17.0), headache (5.7%), pain in extremities (4.7) and nausea (4.7) were reported. 
Treatment related diarrhoea was reported for 13 patients (27.7%), from which 9 were previously randomized 
to the high dose group and 4 to the low dose group. 
In the follow up phase four patients experienced TEAEs related to study drug (infusion site pain) which led to 
consent withdrawal, all of them were previously randomized to the low dose group in the blinded study 
phase. Overall eight patients were withdrawn from the study due to treatment related adverse events after a 
mean time of 97.25 ± 84.59 days. Mean dose at withdrawal was 7.4 ng/kg/min ± 11.25 (min. 0.51 
ng/kg/min – max. 33.3 ng/kg/min, median: 2,9 ng/kg/min). 
Supportive studies 
Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 
In the 25 patients with severe, inoperable CTEPH who were treated up to 24 months with SC treprostinil, 
abdominal infusion site pain was the most common adverse event (86%), followed by infusion site erythema 
(76%) and hematoma (34%). Other frequent ADRs were diarrhoea (12%), infusion site abscesses (8%), jaw 
pain (4%), flushing (4%). There were two cases of infusion site abscesses (8%) requiring surgical incision 
and treatment with oral antibiotics, with no serious adverse consequences.  
Lang et al., 2006 
In Lang et al., 2006, the most common AEs/ADRs (relation to study drug / drug application were not 
reported in the publication) were infusion site pain (4.9%), abscesses (13.1%), cellulitis (8.2%), and 
bleeding (7.4%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
During the study, 19 patients (10 (19.2%) in the low dose group and 9 (17.0%) in the high dose group) 
experienced a total of 28 serious AEs (SAEs). 5 subjects (9.6%) in the low dose group and 6 subjects 
(11.3%) in the high dose group developed SAEs related to the underlying disease CTEPH (Table 16).

QT prolongation 
In a retrospective analysis the ECG data of 202 PAH patients were compared to data of an age and sex-
matched control group with normal ECGs (Rich et al. 2013). 42 patients (20.8%) of the PAH cohort received 
Assessment report

Page 51/65 
  
  
 
 
prostacyclin (epoprostenol or treprostinil) therapy, 35 patients (17.3%) a prostacyclin and PDE5-inhibitor 
combination therapy. Thus, a total of 77 patients (38.1%) of the PAH cohort received epoprostenol or 
treprostinil therapy.  
The ECGs were evaluated for QT interval, QTc interval, QRS duration, presence of RV hypertrophy and 
presence of right axis deviation. The analysis resulted in a significantly longer QTc interval (454.8±29 ms vs. 
429.8±18 ms, p<0.001) and QRS duration (96.5±16 ms vs. 84.4±8 ms, p<0.001) for PH patients as 
compared to controls. No significant difference in QTc interval could be seen for patients receiving 
prostacyclin therapy compared to other PAH patients. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant shifts in laboratory parameters during the study could be detected except 9 cases of 
hypokalaemia (low dose: 5, high dose: 4) which were considered not related to study drug but related to 
concomitant diuretics therapy.

Renal or hepatic impairment 
Out of 105 patients enrolled in the study, nine patients had renal impairment defined as renal insufficiency (2 
patients), chronic renal insufficiency (1 patient), chronic renal failure (2 patients), chronic kidney disease (2 
patients) and chronic kidney failure (2 patients). 
Four patients had hepatic impairment defined as congestive hepatopathy (1 patient), hepatic steatosis (1 
patient), liver haemangioma (1 patient), liver test elevation (at time of baseline) (1 patient). Additionally, for 
two patients both renal and hepatic impairment was document as medical history (1 patient with congestive 
hepatopathy and renal insufficiency and 1 patient hepatopathy and chronic interstitial nephritis). 
No difference in safety profile of treprostinil for patients with forms of hepatic and/or renal impairment 
documented as medical history could be observed. Furthermore, no difference in the rate of occurrence of 
specific adverse events were detected. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Thirty-three patients were pre-treated with other PH specific medications (bosentan, sildenafil, riociguat, and 
macitentan) and were kept on stable doses throughout their study participation. The data observed in the 
study did not indicate drug-drug interactions between treprostinil and concomitant medication. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In this study, 14 patients (8 high dose/ 6 low dose) discontinued study treatment. Ten subjects experienced 
SAEs which lead to withdrawal; however, none was classified as related to the study drug. Four subjects 
experienced TEAEs related to study drug (infusion site pain) which lead to consent withdrawal or withdrawal 
due to subject non-compliance. 
2.6.6.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.6.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue which is currently approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH).  The primary safety data for the current dossier are derived from the pivotal phase III 
CTREPH 116-02 study. Additional safety data came from the two published open-label non-controlled studies 
of Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 and Lang et al., 2006. Information on the safety profile of treprostinil can also be 
extrapolated from the use of the reference product, Remodulin, in PAH.  
Study CTREPH 116-02 was a comparator-controlled study in which a low dose of treprostinil, which was 
anticipated not to have an effect on efficacy, was used as a comparator in order to obtain blinding. A classical 
placebo-controlled design was not feasible due to the characteristic smell of treprostinil and the anticipated 
local site reactions, which is plausible. As such safety data compared to placebo are not available.  
Comparator controlled safety data is available for 53 patients administered the high dose of treprostinil (~30 
ng/kg/min) compared to 52 patients in the low dose group (~3 ng/kg/min) for at least 24 weeks (mean 
exposure of 22.8 weeks in the low dose group and 22.5 weeks in the high dose group). The numbers of 
CTEPH patients exposed is very limited, however, expected considering the orphan designation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 53/65 
  
  
The mean dose of treprostinil in the high dose group at week 24 was 29.11 ng/kg/min, which indicates that 
not all patients achieved the target dose of 30 ng/kg/min. Out of 53 patients, 26 patients (49.1%) didn’t 
achieve the target does at week 24. The common reason was adverse drug reactions (11 patients (20.8%)) 
and weight gain (5 patients (9.4%)). However, In the open label follow up phase doses of up to 53.84 
ng/kg/min were reached. Supported by toxicological investigations no maximum dose of treprostinil has been 
defined and no evidence is available that the adverse event profile differs in CTEPH compared to PAH. The 
dose should be adjusted on an individual basis and under medical supervision in order to achieve a 
maintenance dose at which symptoms improve and which is tolerated by the patient. The applicant presented 
additional data from a prospective registry (Sadushi-Kolici et al 2012), evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
long-term treatment of SC Treprostinil in severe pulmonary hypertension (N=111; 42 patients with CTEPH) 
which reported doses of over 100 ng/kg/min within an observation period of 8 years. Earlier terminations in 
13 patients due to intolerable drug side effects, such as infusion site pain, occurred at < 6 months of 
treatment at a median dose of just 14 ng/kg/min. Based on this information the CHMP agreed that even 
though not used during the pivotal trial, the inclusion of no maximum subcutaneous infusion delivery rate of 
treprostinil as proposed in the dose recommendations in the SmPC was acceptable.  
The adverse event profile as reported in the pivotal safety data is in line with the safety profile of the 
approved Remodulin product and with other prostacyclin analogues. Infusion site pain and infusion site 
reactions were also mentioned and based on the documentation of Remodulin well-known adverse events of 
treprostinil. The number of TEAEs considered treatment-related was slightly higher in the high dose group 
(155) compared with the low dose group (118), which was mainly due to a higher incidence in diarrhoea in 
the high dose group (33 vs 15 in the low dose group). The most common reported adverse events related to 
study drug were infusion site pain (73.6% of the patients in the high dose group vs 80.8% of the patients in 
the low dose), other infusion site reactions (47.2% vs 46.2%), diarrhoea (58.5% vs 25.0%), headache 
(13.2% vs 7.7%), pain in extremities (17.0% vs 1.9%) and flushing (7.5% vs 7.7%).  
The incidences of serious adverse events were relatively high (n=19, 18.1%), however a slightly lower 
percentage of subjects in the high dose group experienced SAE compared with the low dose group (17.0% vs 
19.2%), which is reassuring. No pattern indicative for a safety signal could be identified among the types of 
adverse events. Importantly, only one of the SAEs reported (hospitalization due to mild diarrhoea and 
nausea) was considered related to study drug.  
Discontinuations due to AE were relatively low and even lower in the high dose group (1/53 (1.9%) compared 
with the low dose group (5.8%), which is reassuring. All discontinuations due to TEAE were associated with 
infusion site pain. Discontinuations because of clinical worsening were reported in 3 subjects in the high dose 
group 3/53 (5.7%) and 2 subjects in the low dose group (3.8%), emphasizing disease progression and the 
severity of the disease. 
Three deaths were reported in the study (2 in the high dose group and 1 in the low dose group), however, 
none were related to study drug. Nevertheless, the study was too small to provide definitive data on 
mortality. Longer-term data in the Skoro-Sajer et al. 2007, do not indicate any imbalance in mortality when 
compared with historical controls, which is reassuring. 
Events of hypotension were not observed in the pivotal study, probably due to the low number of patients 
included. Considering the mode of action of treprostinil as a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator and 
that hypotension is a known adverse event of Remodulin, information on the risk of hypotension has been 
included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the proposed SmPC and as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 54/65 
  
  
Bleeding events were not observed in study CTREPH 116-02, most likely due to the limited number of 
patients included but have been reported in the study of Lang et al, 2006 and are included in the Product 
monograph of Remodulin. Additional mechanisms of prostacyclin action include inhibition of platelet 
aggregation which may increase the risk of bleeding. As such, information on the risk of bleeding has been 
included in the SmPC, in line with the SmPC of Remodulin and bleeding tendencies is classified as an 
important potential risk in the RMP. 
No thorough QT study has been performed. Preclinical data do not raise concerns of a QT prolongation effect. 
Furthermore, supportive data are submitted relating to PAH patients associated with an impaired right 
ventricular function (Rich et al. 2013). In this higher risk patient population, longer QTc interval and QRS 
duration were observed in PAH, patients compared to sex-matched controls. However, no differences could 
be found for patients on prostacyclin therapy compared to other PAH patients, although the dataset is quite 
limited. Moreover, Trepulmix can rely on the safety profile of Remodulin for which there are no concerns in 
relation to QT prolongation. 
No clinically relevant shifts in laboratory parameters during the study could be detected except 9 cases of 
hypokalaemia (low dose: 5, high dose: 4) which were rated as not related to study drug but induced by 
diuretics therapy.  
Most of the patients were > 65 years of age (60%). For the data observed, a comparable number of events 
could be observed in comparison to the patients < 65% group, except that diarrhoea and headache events 
were higher in the older age groups and that events related to musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders were lower in the older age groups.   
Furthermore, no pattern indicative for a safety signal could be identified among the types of adverse events 
between patients with renal or hepatic impairment compared with patients without renal or hepatic 
impairment, although firm conclusion cannot be made due to the limited database (9 patients with renal 
impairment and 4 patients with hepatic impairment) and therefore use in patients with hepatic and / or renal 
impairment is included in the RMP as missing information. 
Nevertheless, Trepulmix, as a hybrid product of Remodulin, could rely on the study results from Remodulin 
that indicate that plasma treprostinil exposure increases in mild to moderate hepatic impairment and 
therefore caution is advised when treating patients with hepatic impairment. However, as treprostinil and its 
metabolites are excreted mainly through the urinary route, caution is recommended when treating patients 
with renal impairment. 
Available data from study CTREPH do not indicate drug-drug interactions between treprostinil and 
concomitant PAH medication. However, as metabolism of treprostinil is suspected to be influenced by the 
enzyme CYP2C8, a recommendation to adjust treprostinil dose when used with concomitant CYP2C8 
inhibitors or inducers has been included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. Furthermore, co-administration with 
CYP2C8 inhibitors / inducers is regarded as missing information in the RMP. 
Long-term safety is based on the open-label extension phase of the study and the published studies of Skoro-
Sajer et al., 2007 and Lang et al., 2006. The most commonly reported TEAS in this phase of the study were 
infusion site pain , other infusion site reactions (29.2%), diarrhea (17.0), headache (5.7%), pain in 
extremities (4.7) and nausea (4.7) which are expected and in accordance to the well-known side-effect 
profile of treprostinil sodium from its use in PAH.

2.6.8.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Despite the limited size of the safety database which is justified due to the rarity of CTEPH, the overall safety 
profile of treprostinil is in line with what is known from Remodulin. The main safety concerns identified are 
addressed adequately through appropriate routine risk minimisation measures.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
3.1.    Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for Trepulmix was the treatment of adult patients with inoperable chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment 
(severity classified WHO Functional Class (FC) II, III or IV), to improve exercise capacity and symptoms of 
the disease. CTEPH is defined as pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) as assessed by right heart 
catheterization (mean PAP ≥25 mmHg, PCWP ≤15 mmHg) in the presence of multiple chronic/organized 
occlusive thrombi/emboli in the elastic pulmonary arteries (main, lobar, segmental, subsegmental) after at 
least three months of effective anticoagulation. CTEPH is a rare debilitating, life-threatening disease 
characterized clinically by dyspnoea, fatigue, chest pain, dizziness, peripheral oedema, coughing, 
haemoptysis, and in advanced stages, fainting and syncope. CTEPH is thought to result from isolated or 
recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism and has been estimated to occur in 3% of patients who survive 
pulmonary embolism (Lang and Klepetko 2009). Using an upper estimate, CTEPH affects 1-9 patients per 
100.000 (Orphanet, 2009). If left untreated, CTEPH patients have a poor prognosis. When mean pulmonary 
arterial pressure (PAP) is greater than 50 mm Hg, the 1-year survival rate in untreated patients with CTEPH 
is less than 50% (Lang and Klepetko, 2008). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 58/65 
  
  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the treatment of choice for patients with CTEPH as it is a potentially 
curative treatment option. However, it is estimated that in 50% of CTEPH, PEA is infeasible or ineffective 
(Klepetko et al. 2004). Since March 2014, Adempas (riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator) has 
been approved for the treatment of adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III with inoperable 
CTEPH, or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment to improve exercise capacity. There are no 
other approved therapeutic agents specifically indicated for the treatment of inoperable CTEPH.  
According to the ESC ERS guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension (2015), off-
label use of drugs approved for PAH may be considered in symptomatic patients who have been classified as 
having inoperable CTEPH by a CTEPH team including at least one experienced PEA surgeon, indicating the 
unmet medical need.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Treprostinil has been investigated in a double-blind, comparator-controlled, 24-week phase 3 study in 105 
patients with severe non-operable CTEPH (CTREPH 116-02 trial). Patients were selected based on perfusion 
scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography and/or multi-slice CT, right heart catheterization, effective 
anticoagulation therapy, baseline 6MWT between 150-400 m, WHO/NYHA FC III or IV and inoperable or 
persistent/recurrent CTEPH. During the double-blind treatment period, CTEPH patients received s.c. infusion 
of treprostinil to a target dose of 30 ng/kg/min (high dose group) or the target dose of 3 ng/kg/min (low 
dose group: comparator). The low dose, which did not show clinical improvement in patients with PAH has 
been used as a comparator since it was considered not feasible to conduct a placebo-controlled design due to 
the characteristic smell of the treprostinil solution and the anticipated local site reactions induced by s.c. 
administered treprostinil. Treprostinil was titrated to the target dose based on a predefined infusion rate 
setting schedule. In both the high and the low dose group, the dose was escalated to the target dose after 
the first 12 weeks and was stable thereafter for another 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change 
from baseline in 6MWT distance after 24 weeks. Important secondary endpoints included clinical worsening, 
change in 6MWD after 12 weeks, change in WHO functional class, while changes in haemodynamic 
parameters and pro-BNP were included as exploratory endpoints. 
The effect of treprostinil in CETPH was supported by two published clinical studies (Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 
and Lang et al., 2007). The study of Skoro-Sajer et al. was a prospective open-label non-controlled phase II 
study to investigate the effect of up to 24 months treatment of treprostinil s.c. in 25 patients with severe 
inoperable CTEPH (WHO functional class III or IV). The study of Lang et al. was a multicentre retrospective 
study to investigate the effect of up to 36 months of s.c. infused treprostinil on exercise capacity and survival 
benefits in patients with PAH (n= 99) and CTEPH (n=23). Both studies used historical controls for 
comparative survival analysis.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal study CTREPH 116-02, the high dose of treprostinil (30 ng/kg/min) resulted in a significant 
improvement in 6MWD from baseline to week 24 compared to the low dose group (3 ng/kg/min) (45.43 vs 
3.83 m; ANCOVA p =0.002; Mann-Whitney U-test p = 0.0003). 
Significant improvements are also shown in NYHA/WHO functional class for 27 subjects (50.9 %) in the high 
dose group and 9 subjects (17.3 %) in the low dose group, whereas 2 subjects (3.8 %) experienced a 
Assessment report

deterioration increase of NYHA functional class in the high dose group and 3 subjects (5.8 %) in the low dose 
group (Chi-square: p=0.0019; Fisher exact test: p=0.0012). A lower number of subjects in the high dose 
group compared with the low dose group developed a clinical worsening during the study period (7 (13.2%) 
vs. 12 (23.1%) in the high and low dose group, respectively), however, this difference was not significant 
(p=0.189). Of the patients with clinical worsening, 2 vs 7 subjects showed a reduction of more than 20% in 
6MWT, 2 vs 4 subjects experienced a worsening of WHO NYHA FC and 4 vs 6 subjects had to be hospitalized 
due to CTEPH and needed additional PH-specific treatment. Also, a non-significant positive trend on the 
clinical secondary endpoint Borg Dyspnoea and MINNESOTA QOL was observed. 
The effect of dose on the 6MWT outcome was not impacted by CTEPH type (inoperable/persistent) (p value of 
the interaction between “dose” and CTEPH operability 0.7280) as expected. The subgroup analysis (forest 
plot) with respect to the type of CTEPH (inoperable or persistent/recurrent CTEPH), and NYHA/WHO FC at 
baseline supported the primary analysis.  
Comparable results were recorded in the study of Skoro-Sajer et al. where 6 months of treatment with 
treprostinil (mean dose of 21 ± 5 ng/kg/min (range: 11-30 ng/kg/min)) resulted in a mean increase in 
6MWD compared to baseline of 59m in patients with severe inoperable CTEPH. In addition, this study 
demonstrated long term maintenance of the effect of treprostinil in 6MWD and a beneficial effect on clinical 
outcomes, i.e. survival rates, compared with historical controls (overall survival rates at one, two, three and 
five years of  80%, 80%, 80% and 53% compared with 67%, 43%, 37% and 16%, respectively (p = 0.02). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The pivotal study included only a limited number of patients with CTEPH NYHA FC II and IV. Even though 
subgroup analyses showed a comparable effect for treprostinil in all three NYHA classes. As patients with 
NYHA class II are only slightly limited in physical activity, available data are too limited to draw conclusions 
about efficacy and safety, and available clinical guidelines advice against the use of prostacyclin treatment in 
such patients, it was agreed to remove this patient group from the approved indication. Although the number 
of patients with NYHA IV was also low, the CHMP noted that treatment options are very limited in patients 
unable to carry out any physical activity. Moreover, the data in this subgroup was supported by literature 
data (Lang et al 2006). As all available results seem to confirm consistent efficacy between FC III and FC IV, 
the CHMP agreed on the inclusion of this group of patients in the indication. 
The proposed SmPC provides guidance for subcutaneous infusion delivery rates of treprostinil with no defined 
maximum dose, although in study CTREPH 116-02, patients in the high dose group received s.c. treprostinil 
infusions up to a target dose of 30 ng/kg/min in the blinded phase. The Applicant however presented 
literature data to demonstrate that in this setting, higher doses than those used in the clinical trial have been 
used and that the maximum dose is defined for each individual patient based on their needs and tolerability 
to treprostinil. Considering that the product will be administered under close medical supervision with 
continuous adjustment of the dose, and there is no evidence to suggest that the adverse event profile of 
treprostinil is different between CTEPH and PAH, the CHMP agreed to maintain the dosing instructions 
consistent with those of the reference product Remodulin. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The primary safety data are derived from the pivotal phase III CTREPH 116-02 study. Additional safety data 
are available from the two published open-label non-controlled studies of Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 and Lang 
et al., 2006 and available published data for the reference product Remodulin. Comparator controlled safety 
Assessment report

data is available for 53 patients administered the high dose of treprostinil (~30 ng/kg/min) compared to 52 
patients in the low dose group (~3 ng/kg/min) for at least 24 weeks (mean exposure of 22.8 weeks and 22.5 
weeks in the high and low dose group, respectively). 
The system organ classes mostly affected and with a higher rate of reported adverse events in the high dose 
group were “General disorders and administration site conditions” (190/513 (37.0%); low dose 90 and high 
dose 100) and “Gastrointestinal disorders” (75/513 ( 14.6%); low dose 23 and high dose 52). The most 
frequently reported adverse events (PT) with a higher rate in the high dose group were diarrhoea (33 
subjects (62.3%) in the high dose group vs 13 subjects in the low dose group (25.0%)), headache (12 
(22.6%) vs 4 (7.7%)) and pain in extremities (11 (20.8%) vs 1 (1.9%)).  
Other frequently reported adverse events with a similar rate between the groups were infusion site pain (39 
subjects (73.6%) in the high dose group vs 42 subjects in the low dose group (80.8%) and infusion site 
erythema (18 (34.0%) vs 20(38.5%)). 
The most common reported adverse events related to study drug were infusion site pain (73.6 % of the 
patients in the high dose group vs 80.8% of the patients in the low dose group), other infusion site reactions 
(47.2% vs 46.2%), diarrhoea (58.5% vs 25.0%), headache (13.2% vs 7.7%), pain in extremities (17.0% vs 
1.9%) and flushing (7.5% vs 7.7%).  
A slightly lower percentage of subjects in the high dose group experienced SAE compared with the low dose 
group (17.0% vs 19.2%). No pattern indicative for a safety signal could be identified among the types of 
adverse events. Importantly, all but one (hospitalization due to mild diarrhoea and nausea) of the SAEs were 
considered not related to study drug. Most of the SAEs were related to the underlying disease CTEPH.  
The incidence rate of death was numerically higher in the high dose group (n=2, 3.8%) compared with the 
low dose group (n=1, 1.9%), however, none of the deaths was rated as related to study drug.  
Treprostinil up to doses of 30ng/kg/min was well tolerated. TEAEs leading to discontinuations were relatively 
low, despite the frequently reported infusion site reactions and even lower in the high dose group (n= 1, 
1.9%) compared with the low dose group (n=3, 5.8%), which were all related to infusion site pain.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The numbers of CTEPH patients exposed in study CTREPH 116-02 is limited, however this is to be expected 
considering the orphan designation. Additionally, the double-blind treatment phase of 24 weeks, was too 
short to assess long-term safety. Therefore, reference is made to open-label extension phase of the pivotal 
study and the published studies of Skoro-Sajer et al., 2007 and Lang et al., 2006. Although these are non-
controlled and open-label, the safety profile of the published studies is comparable to the safety profile 
observed in study CTREPH 116-02.  
Events of hypotension were not observed in the pivotal study, probably due to the low number of patients 
included. Considering the mode of action of treprostinil as a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator and 
that hypotension is a known adverse event of treprostinil, information on the risk of hypotension has been 
included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the proposed SmPC and as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
A known mechanism of prostacyclin action is inhibition of platelet aggregation. Due to this effect, treprostinil 
may increase the risk of bleeding as observed by an increased incidence of epistaxis and gastrointestinal (GI) 
bleeding in controlled clinical studies for treprostinil in PAH and in the study of Lang et al. Bleeding events 
were not reported in the study CTREPH 116-02, most likely due to the limited number of patients, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/86002/2020 
Page 61/65 
  
  
emphasizing the limited dossier of Trepulmix, nevertheless bleeding tendencies has been included in the RMP 
as an important potential risk to ensure adequate monitoring of these type of events.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treatment with treprostinil (Trepulmix) is targeted at patients with inoperable chronic thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment. Subcutaneous 
infusions with high dose treprostinil of 30 ng/kg/min resulted in a clinically relevant and statistically 
significant improvement in 6MWT after 24 weeks of treatment when compared with low dose treprostinil of 3 
ng/kg/min. The presented results are nominally comparable to the results of the other authorised product for 
CTEPH (Adempas (riociguat)). The 6MWT is considered an acceptable surrogate according to the CHMP PAH 
guideline to apply for an indication including improvement in exercise capacity.  
The beneficial effect on the primary endpoint is supported by improvements in other relevant endpoints of 
WHO (NYHA) functional class and pulmonary haemodynamics. Beneficial trends were also observed in other 
(exploratory) endpoints including clinical worsening and QOL. The use of the primary endpoint and the other 
(secondary and exploratory) endpoints is generally in line with endpoints used in several PAH dossiers and 
Assessment report

Page 62/65 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also in the approved riociguat dossier for CTEPH (only the analysis of the percentage of patients with clinical 
worsening is not in accord with the guideline-recommended time to worsening). This is acceptable 
considering the in principal comparable disease characteristics and treatment goals for CTEPH vs PAH. The 
effect of dose on the 6MWT outcome was not impacted by CTEPH type (inoperable/persistent). The subgroup 
analysis with respect to the type of CTEPH (inoperable or persistent/recurrent CTEPH) at baseline supported 
the primary analysis.  
Safety data are based on one pivotal active-controlled study, providing a mean exposure of 22.8 weeks for 
53 patients treated with treprostinil 30 ng/kg/min and supported by two published open-label and non-
controlled studies). Also, the safety data of Remodulin in PAH, can be considered supportive to assess safety. 
This is considered sufficient, especially for an orphan indication. The common AEs are mainly related to the 
route of administration, including infusion site pain and other infusion site reactions, and to the mechanism of 
action of vasodilation, including headache, nausea, vomiting and flushing. Overall, treprostinil up to doses of 
30 ng/kg/min is well tolerated, despite the frequently reported infusion site reactions, and displays an 
acceptable safety profile with very limited patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. 
Also, data on clinical worsening do not indicate a negative effect on morbidity. The reported adverse event 
profile is in line with the safety profile of Remodulin in PAH patients and of other prostacyclin analogues.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The main clinical data are limited due to the rarity of the disease but do show a clinically relevant and 
significant effect on exercise time after 24 weeks. This clinically relevant benefit is further supported by 
improvement in functional class and haemodynamic parameters. For the proposed indication provided safety 
was acceptable, generally well tolerated and appears in line with the known safety profile of other 
prostaglandin analogues, including treprostinil in PAH. The demonstrated clinical benefit outweighs the risks 
related to the product.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of treprostinil is positive.

4.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Trepulmix is not similar to Adempas within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the benefit-risk balance of Trepulmix is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of adult patients with WHO Functional Class (FC) III or IV and: 
• 
• 
inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or  
persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment  
to improve exercise capacity.

Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of
adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell
transplantation.
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and 
dexamethasone, or melphalan and prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant.
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment
of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy.
Follicular lymphoma
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Lenalidomide treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer 
therapies.
For all indications described below:
-
-
Dose is modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings (see section 4.4).
Dose adjustments, during treatment and restart of treatment, are recommended to manage Grade
3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or other Grade 3 or 4 toxicity judged to be related to 
lenalidomide.
In case of neutropenia, the use of growth factors in patient management should be considered.
If less than 12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose, the patient can take the dose. If more than 
12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose at the normal time, the patient should not take the dose,
but take the next dose at the normal time on the following day.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)
All patients should receive TLS prophylaxis (allopurinol, rasburicase or equivalent as per 
institutional guidelines) and be well hydrated (orally) during the first week of the first cycle or for 
a longer period if clinically indicated. To monitor for TLS, patients should have a chemistry panel 
drawn weekly during the first cycle and as clinically indicated.
Lenalidomide may be continued (maintain dose) in patients with laboratory TLS or Grade 1 
clinical TLS, or at the physician’s discretion, reduce dose by one level and continue lenalidomide. 
Vigorous intravenous hydration should be provided and appropriate medical management 
according to the local standard of care, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Rasburicase 
therapy may be needed to reduce hyperuricaemia. Hospitalisation of the patient will be at 
physician’s discretion.
In patients with Grade 2 to 4 clinical TLS, interrupt lenalidomide and obtain a chemistry panel 
8
weekly or as clinically indicated. Vigorous intravenous hydration should be provided and 
appropriate medical management according to the local standard of care, until correction of 
electrolyte abnormalities.
Rasburicase therapy and hospitalisation will be at physician’s discretion. When the TLS resolves 
to Grade 0, restart lenalidomide at next lower dose per physician’s discretion (see section 4.4).
Tumour flare reaction 
At the physician’s discretion, lenalidomide may be continued in patients with Grade 1 or 2 tumour 
flare reaction (TFR) without interruption or modification. At the physician’s discretion, therapy 
with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), limited duration corticosteroids, and/or 
narcotic analgesics may be administered. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, withhold treatment 
with lenalidomide and initiate therapy with NSAIDs, corticosteroids and/or narcotic analgesics. 
When TFR resolves to ≤ Grade 1, restart lenalidomide treatment at the same dose level for the rest 
of the cycle. Patients may be treated for management of symptoms per the guidance for treatment 
of Grade 1 and 2 TFR (see section 4.4).
All indications
For other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities judged to be related to lenalidomide, treatment should be stopped and 
only restarted at next lower dose level when toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 2 depending on the 
physician’s discretion.
Lenalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2 or 3 skin rash. 
Lenalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or 
bullous rash, or if Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Drug Reaction 
with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is suspected, and should not be resumed following 
discontinuation from these reactions.
Special populations
Paediatric population
Lenalidomide should not be used in children and adolescents from birth to less than 18 years because
of safety concerns (see section 5.1).
Elderly
Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2. Lenalidomide has been used in
clinical trials in multiple myeloma patients up to 91 years of age (see section 5.1).
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose
selection and it would be prudent to monitor renal function.
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant
Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older should be carefully assessed
before treatment is considered (see section 4.4).
For patients older than 75 years of age treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone, 
the starting dose of dexamethasone is 20 mg once daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day 
treatment cycle.
No dose adjustment is proposed for patients older than 75 years who are treated with lenalidomide in
combination with melphalan and prednisone.
In patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older who received 
lenalidomide, there was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions that led to 
treatment discontinuation.
Lenalidomide combined therapy was less tolerated in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients older 
than 75 years of age compared to the younger population. These patients discontinued at a higher rate 
9
due to intolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events and serious adverse events), when compared to patients 
< 75 years.
Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy
The percentage of multiple myeloma patients aged 65 or over was not significantly different between 
the lenalidomide/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups. No overall difference in safety 
or efficacy was observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater pre-disposition of 
older individuals cannot be ruled out.
Follicular lymphoma
For follicular lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with rituximab, the overall 
rate of adverse events is similar for patients aged 65 years or over compared with patients under 65 
years of age. No overall difference in efficacy was observed between the two age groups.
Patients with renal impairment
Lenalidomide is primarily excreted by the kidney; patients with greater degrees of renal impairment 
can have impaired treatment tolerance (see section 4.4). Care should be taken in dose selection and 
monitoring of renal function is advised.
No dose adjustments are required for patients with mild renal impairment and multiple myeloma or 
follicular lymphoma.
The following dose adjustments are recommended at the start of therapy and throughout treatment for
patients with moderate or severe impaired renal function or end stage renal disease.
There are no phase 3 trial experiences with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (CLcr < 30 mL/min,
requiring dialysis).

daily. 
3 Patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD were excluded from study.
No data available3
No data available3
After initiation of lenalidomide therapy, subsequent lenalidomide dose modification in renally
impaired patients should be based on individual patient treatment tolerance, as described above.
10
Patients with hepatic impairment
Lenalidomide has not formally been studied in patients with impaired hepatic function and there are no 
specific dose recommendations.
Method of administration
Oral use.
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto capsules should be taken orally at about the same time on the 
scheduled days. The capsules should not be opened, broken or chewed (see section 6.6). The capsules 
should be swallowed whole, preferably with water, either with or without food.
Lenalidomide capsules should not be pushed through the foil in the blister pack as this could cause 
damage to the capsule. The capsule should be removed from the package by peeling off the foil from 
one separated blister cell.
4.3 Contraindications
-
-
-
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Women who are pregnant.
Women of childbearing potential unless all of the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention
Programme are met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
When lenalidomide is given in combination with other medicinal products, the corresponding 
Summary of Product Characteristics must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment.
Pregnancy warning
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. In monkeys lenalidomide induced
malformations similar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide is 
taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected.
The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for all patients unless there is
reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential.
Criteria for women of non-childbearing potential
A female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered to have childbearing potential
unless she meets at least one of the following criteria:
-
Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year (Amenorrhoea following cancer therapy
or during breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing potential).
Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist.
Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.
XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis.
-
-
-
Counselling
For women of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are 
met:
-
-
She understands the expected teratogenic risk to the unborn child
She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, at least 4 weeks
before starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after
the end of treatment
Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on
effective contraception
-
11
-
-
-
-
-
She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures
She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to
rapidly consult if there is a risk of pregnancy
She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as lenalidomide is dispensed
following a negative pregnancy test
She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing at least every 4 weeks except
in case of confirmed tubal sterilisation
She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with
the use of lenalidomide.
For male patients taking lenalidomide, pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated that lenalidomide is
present in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable in human semen
3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a precaution and taking
into account special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal impairment, all male
patients taking lenalidomide must meet the following conditions:
-
Understand the expected teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or
a woman of childbearing potential.
Understand the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman 
or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (even if the man has had a 
vasectomy), during treatment and for at least 7 days after dose interruptions and/or cessation of 
treatment.
Understand that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking lenalidomide or 
shortly after he has stopped taking lenalidomide, he should inform his treating physician 
immediately and that it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or 
experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice.
-
-
The prescriber must ensure that for women of childbearing potential:
-
The patient complies with the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, including 
confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding.
The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions.
-
Contraception
Women of childbearing potential must use at least one effective method of contraception for at least 4 
weeks before therapy, during therapy, and until at least 4 weeks after lenalidomide therapy and even in 
case of dose interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence confirmed 
on a monthly basis. If not established on effective contraception, the patient must be referred to an 
appropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive advice in order that contraception can be 
initiated.
The following can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception:
-
-
-
-
-
Implant
Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)
Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot
Tubal sterilisation
Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two 
negative semen analyses
Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel)
-
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking
lenalidomide in combination therapy, and to a lesser extent in patients with multiple myeloma, taking
lenalidomide monotherapy, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (see also section
4.5). If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to one of the
effective methods listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after
discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced
during co-treatment with dexamethasone (see section 4.5).
12
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of
infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be
considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.
Copper-releasing intrauterine devices are generally not recommended due to the potential risks of
infection at the time of insertion and menstrual blood loss which may compromise patients with
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.
Pregnancy testing
According to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of
25 mIU/mL must be performed for women of childbearing potential as outlined below. This
requirement includes women of childbearing potential who practice absolute and continuous abstinence.
Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same day.
Dispensing of lenalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the
prescription.
Prior to starting treatment
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation, when
lenalidomide is prescribed, or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had been
using effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant
when she starts treatment with lenalidomide.
Follow-up and end of treatment
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated at least every 4 weeks, including at least 4 
weeks after the end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy 
tests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the
prescriber.
Additional precautions
Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any
unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment for safe disposal.
Patients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 7 days following discontinuation of
lenalidomide.
Healthcare professionals and caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the blister or 
capsule. Women who are pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or 
capsule (see section 6.6).
Educational materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to lenalidomide, the marketing authorisation 
holder will provide educational material to health care professionals to reinforce the warnings about the 
expected teratogenicity of lenalidomide, to provide advice on contraception before therapy is started, 
and to provide guidance on the need for pregnancy testing. The prescriber must inform male and female 
patients about the expected teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures as specified in 
the Pregnancy Prevention Programme and provide patients with appropriate patient educational 
brochure, patient card and/or equivalent tool in accordance to the national implemented patient card 
system. A national controlled distribution system has been implemented in collaboration with each 
National Competent Authority. The controlled distribution system includes the use of a patient card 
and/or equivalent tool for prescribing and/or dispensing controls, and the collecting of detailed data 
relating to the indication in order to monitor closely the off-label use within the national territory. 
Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same day. 
Dispensing of lenalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the 
prescription and following a medically supervised negative pregnancy test result. Prescriptions for 
13
women of childbearing potential can be for a maximum duration of treatment of 4 weeks, according to 
the approved indications dosing regimens (see section 4.2), and prescriptions for all other patients can 
be for a maximum duration of treatment of 12 weeks.
Other special warnings and precautions for use
Myocardial infarction
Myocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with
known risk factors and within the first 12 months when used in combination with dexamethasone. 
Patients with known risk factors – including prior thrombosis – should be closely monitored, and
action should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (eg. smoking, hypertension, and
hyperlipidaemia).
Venous and arterial thromboembolic events
In patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated
with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism). The risk of venous thromboembolism was seen to a lesser extent with
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone.
In patients with multiple myeloma, treatment with lenalidomide monotherapy was associated with a 
lower risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism) than in patients with multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide in combination therapy 
(see sections 4.5 and 4.8).
In patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated
with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (predominantly myocardial infarction and
cerebrovascular event) and was seen to a lesser extent with lenalidomide in combination with
melphalan and prednisone. The risk of arterial thromboembolism is lower in patients with multiple
myeloma treated with lenalidomide monotherapy than in patients with multiple myeloma treated with
lenalidomide in combination therapy.
Consequently, patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism – including prior thrombosis –
should be closely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g.
smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or
previous history of thromboembolic events may also increase thrombotic risk in these patients. 
Therefore, erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as
hormone replacement therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving
lenalidomide with dexamethasone. A haemoglobin concentration above 12 g/dl should lead to
discontinuation of erythropoietic agents.
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism.
Patients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of
breath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling. Prophylactic antithrombotic medicinal products should be
recommended, especially in patients with additional thrombotic risk factors. The decision to take
antithrombotic prophylactic measures should be made after careful assessment of an individual
patient’s underlying risk factors.
If the patient experiences any thromboembolic events, treatment must be discontinued and standard
anticoagulation therapy started. Once the patient has been stabilised on the anticoagulation treatment
and any complications of the thromboembolic event have been managed, the lenalidomide treatment
may be restarted at the original dose dependent upon a benefit risk assessment. The patient should
continue anticoagulation therapy during the course of lenalidomide treatment.
Pulmonary hypertension
Cases of pulmonary hypertension, some fatal, have been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide.
Patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to
initiating and during lenalidomide therapy.
14
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
The major dose limiting toxicities of lenalidomide include neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. A
complete blood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential count, platelet count,
haemoglobin, and haematocrit should be performed at baseline, every week for the first 8 weeks of
lenalidomide treatment and monthly thereafter to monitor for cytopenias. In follicular lymphoma, the 
monitoring scheme should be weekly for the first 3 weeks of cycle 1 (28 days), every 2 weeks during 
cycles 2 through 4, and then at the start of each cycle thereafter. A dose interruption and/or a dose 
reduction may be required (see section 4.2).
In case of neutropenia, the physician should consider the use of growth factors in patient management.
Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes.
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including
petechiae and epistaxis, especially in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to
induce bleeding (see section 4.8, Haemorrhagic disorders).
Co-administration of lenalidomide with other myelosuppressive agents should be undertaken with
caution.
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide
maintenance
The adverse reactions from CALGB 100104 included events reported post-high dose melphalan and
ASCT (HDM/ASCT) as well as events from the maintenance treatment period. A second analysis
identified events that occurred after the start of maintenance treatment. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse
reactions were from the maintenance treatment period only.
Overall, Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance
arms compared to the placebo maintenance arms in the 2 studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance
in NDMM patients who have undergone ASCT (32.1% vs 26.7% [16.1% vs 1.8% after the start of
maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 16.4% vs 0.7% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). 
Treatment-emergent AEs of neutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in
2.2% of patients in CALGB 100104 and 2.4% of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4
febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms
compared to placebo maintenance arms in both studies (0.4% vs 0.5% [0.4% vs 0.5% after the start of 
maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3% vs 0% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Patients
should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes, a treatment interruption and/or dose reduction 
may be required (see section 4.2).
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance
arms compared to the placebo maintenance arms in studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance in
NDMM patients who have undergone ASCT (37.5% vs 30.3% [17.9% vs 4.1% after the start of
maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0% vs 2.9% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Patients
and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including petechiae
and epistaxes, especially in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to induce
bleeding (see section 4.8, Haemorrhagic disorders).
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with
lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at a lower frequency in the lenalidomide in combination with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) arm compared to the Rd comparator arm (2.7% vs 5.9%) in the 
SWOG S0777 study. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the RVd arm 
and Rd arm (0.0% vs 0.4%). Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes; a 
treatment interruption and/or dose reduction may be required (see section 4.2).
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the RVd arm compared to the 
Rd comparator arm (17.2% vs 9.4%).
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with
lenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone
15
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in the lenalidomide arms in combination with dexamethasone to a
lesser extent than in the comparator arm (8.5% in the Rd [continuous treatment] and Rd18 [treatment
for 18 four-week cycles] compared with 15% in the melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide arm, see section
4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were consistent with the comparator arm (0.6% in the Rd
and Rd18 lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared with 0.7% in the
melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide arm, see section 4.8).
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed to a lesser extent in the Rd and Rd18 arms than in the
comparator arm (8.1% vs 11.1%, respectively).
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in clinical trials of newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma patients is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1% in
melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide arm followed by lenalidomide [MPR+R] and melphalan,
prednisone and lenalidomide followed by placebo [MPR+p] treated patients compared with 7.8% in
MPp+p-treated patients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed
infrequently (1.7% in MPR+R/MPR+p treated patients compared to 0.0% in MPp+p treated patients;
see section 4.8).
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in multiple myeloma patients is
associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (40.4% in
MPR+R/MPR+p treated patients, compared with 13.7% in MPp+p-treated patients; see section 4.8).
Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients with at least one
prior therapy is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared with 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated
patients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed infrequently (0.6% in
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone treated
patients; see section 4.8).
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with
a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone-
treated patients; see section 4.8).
Follicular lymphoma
The combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma patients is associated with a 
higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia compared with patients on the placebo/rituximab arm. 
Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia were more commonly observed in the 
lenalidomide/rituximab arm (see section 4.8).
Thyroid disorders
Cases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported. Optimal control of co-
morbid conditions influencing thyroid function is recommended before start of treatment. Baseline and 
ongoing monitoring of thyroid function is recommended.
Peripheral neuropathy
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, which is known to induce severe peripheral
neuropathy. There was no increase in peripheral neuropathy observed with lenalidomide in combination 
with dexamethasone or melphalan and prednisone or lenalidomide monotherapy or with long term use 
of lenalidomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
The combination of lenalidomide with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone in multiple 
myeloma patients is associated with a higher frequency of peripheral neuropathy. The frequency was 
lower when bortezomib was administered subcutaneously. For additional information, see Section 4.8 
16
and the SmPC for bortezomib.
Tumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome
Because lenalidomide has anti-neoplastic activity, the complications of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)
may occur. Cases of TLS and tumour flare reaction (TFR), including fatal cases, have been reported (see 
section 4.8). The patients at risk of TLS and TFR are those with high tumour burden prior to treatment.
Caution should be practiced when introducing these patients to lenalidomide. These patients should be 
monitored closely, especially during the first cycle or dose-escalation, and appropriate precautions
taken. 
Follicular lymphoma
Careful monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Tumour flare may mimic PD. Patients 
who experienced Grade 1 and 2 TFR were treated with corticosteroids, NSAIDs and/or narcotic 
analgesics for management of TFR symptoms. The decision to take therapeutic measures for TFR 
should be made after careful clinical assessment of the individual patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Careful monitoring and evaluation for TLS is recommended. Patients should be well hydrated and 
receive TLS prophylaxis, in addition to weekly chemistry panels during the first cycle or longer, as 
clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions
Cases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous reactions
including SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide (see section 
4.8). Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of these reactions by their prescribers and
should be told to seek medical attention immediately if they develop these symptoms. Lenalidomide
must be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, exfoliative or bullous rash, or if SJS, TEN
or DRESS is suspected, and should not be resumed following discontinuation for these reactions. 
Interruption or discontinuation of lenalidomide should be considered for other forms of skin reaction
depending on severity. Patients who had previous allergic reactions while treated with thalidomide 
should be monitored closely, as a possible cross-reaction between lenalidomide and thalidomide has 
been reported in the literature. Patients with a history of severe rash associated with thalidomide
treatment should not receive lenalidomide.
Second primary malignancies
An increase of second primary malignancies (SPM) has been observed in clinical trials in previously
treated myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide/dexamethasone (3.98 per 100 person-years)
compared to controls (1.38 per 100 person-years). Non-invasive SPM comprise basal cell or squamous
cell skin cancers. Most of the invasive SPMs were solid tumour malignancies.
In clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients not eligible for transplant, a 4.9-fold
increase in incidence rate of hematologic SPM (cases of AML, MDS) has been observed in patients
receiving lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone until progression (1.75 per 100 
person-years) compared with melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.36 per 100 person-years).
A 2.12-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving
lenalidomide (9 cycles) in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.57 per 100 person-years)
compared with melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.74 per 100 person-years).
In patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18
months, the hematologic SPM incidence rate (0.16 per 100 person-years) was not increased as
compared to thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (0.79 per 100 person-years).
A 1.3-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving
lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18 months (1.58 per 100
person-years) compared to thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.19 per 100
person-years).
17
In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone, the hematologic SPM incidence rate was 0.00 – 0.16 per 100 person-
years and the incidence rate of solid tumour SPM was 0.21 – 1.04 per 100 person-years.
The increased risk of secondary primary malignancies associated with lenalidomide is relevant also in
the context of NDMM after stem cell transplantation. Though this risk is not yet fully characterized, it
should be kept in mind when considering and using lenalidomide in this setting.
The incidence rate of hematologic malignancies, most notably AML, MDS and B-cell malignancies
(including Hodgkin’s lymphoma), was 1.31 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 0.58
per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.02 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to
lenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after
ASCT). The incidence rate of solid tumour SPMs was 1.36 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide
arms and 1.05 per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.26 per 100 person-years for patients
exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to
lenalidomide after ASCT).
The risk of occurrence of hematologic SPM must be taken into account before initiating treatment with
lenalidomide either in combination with melphalan or immediately following high-dose melphalan and 
ASCT. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during treatment using standard cancer
screening for occurrence of SPM and institute treatment as indicated.
Second primary malignancies in follicular lymphoma
In a relapsed/refractory iNHL study which included follicular lymphoma patients, no increased risk of 
SPMs in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to the placebo/rituximab arm, was observed. 
Hematologic SPM of AML occurred in 0.29 per 100 person-years in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm 
compared with 0.29 per 100 person-years in patients receiving placebo/rituximab. The incidence rate of 
hematologic plus solid tumour SPMs (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) was 0.87 per 100 person-
years in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to 1.17 per 100 person-years in patients receiving 
placebo/rituximab with a median follow-up of 30.59 months (range 0.6 to 50.9 months).
Non-melanoma skin cancers are identified risks and comprise squamous cell carcinomas of skin or 
basal cell carcinomas.
Physicians should monitor patients for the development of SPMs. Both the potential benefit of
lenalidomide and the risk of SPMs should be considered when considering treatment with lenalidomide.
Hepatic disorders
Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide in
combination therapy: acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, and
mixed cytolytic/cholestatic hepatitis have been reported. The mechanisms of severe drug-induced
hepatotoxicity remain unknown although, in some cases, pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated
baseline liver enzymes, and possibly treatment with antibiotics might be risk factors.
Abnormal liver function tests were commonly reported and were generally asymptomatic and
reversible upon dosing interruption. Once parameters have returned to baseline, treatment at a lower
dose may be considered.
Lenalidomide is excreted by the kidneys. It is important to dose adjust patients with renal impairment
in order to avoid plasma levels which may increase the risk for higher haematological adverse
reactions or hepatotoxicity. Monitoring of liver function is recommended, particularly when there is a
history of or concurrent viral liver infection or when lenalidomide is combined with medicinal
products known to be associated with liver dysfunction.
Infection with or without neutropenia
Patients with multiple myeloma are prone to develop infections including pneumonia. A higher rate of 
infections was observed with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone than with MPT in 
18
patients with NDMM who are not eligible for transplant, and with lenalidomide maintenance compared 
to placebo in patients with NDMM who had undergone ASCT. Grade ≥ 3 infections occurred within
the context of neutropenia in less than one-third of the patients. Patients with known risk factors for 
infections should be closely monitored. All patients should be advised to seek medical attention 
promptly at the first sign of infection (eg, cough, fever, etc) thereby allowing for early management to 
reduce severity.
Viral reactivation
Cases of viral reactivation have been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, including serious
cases of herpes zoster or hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation.
Some of the cases of viral reactivation had a fatal outcome.
Some of the cases of herpes zoster reactivation resulted in disseminated herpes zoster, meningitis
herpes zoster or ophthalmic herpes zoster requiring a temporary hold or permanent discontinuation of
the treatment with lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment.
Reactivation of hepatitis B has been reported rarely in patients receiving lenalidomide who have
previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Some of these cases have progressed to
acute hepatic failure resulting in discontinuation of lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment.
Hepatitis B virus status should be established before initiating treatment with lenalidomide. For
patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the
treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when lenalidomide is used in
patients previously infected with HBV, including patients who are anti-HBc positive but HBsAg
negative. These patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection
throughout therapy.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have been reported
with lenalidomide. PML was reported several months to several years after starting the treatment with
lenalidomide. Cases have generally been reported in patients taking concomitant dexamethasone or
prior treatment with other immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Physicians should monitor patients at
regular intervals and should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or
worsening neurological symptoms, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. Patients should also
be advised to inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms
that the patient is not aware of.
The evaluation for PML should be based on neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging of
the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) or a brain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional
follow-up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established.
If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is
confirmed, lenalidomide must be permanently discontinued.
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients
There was a higher rate of intolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, serious adverse events,
discontinuation) in patients with age > 75 years, ISS stage III, ECOG PS≥2 or CLcr<60 mL/min when
lenalidomide is given in combination. Patients should be carefully assessed for their ability to tolerate
lenalidomide in combination, with consideration to age, ISS stage III, ECOG PS≥2 or CLcr<60
mL/min (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Cataract
Cataract has been reported with a higher frequency in patients receiving lenalidomide in combination
with dexamethasone particularly when used for a prolonged time. Regular monitoring of visual ability
is recommended.
19
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone
replacement therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide
with dexamethasone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
Oral contraceptives
No interaction study has been performed with oral contraceptives. Lenalidomide is not an enzyme
inducer. In an in vitro study with human hepatocytes, lenalidomide, at various concentrations tested
did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. Therefore, induction leading
to reduced efficacy of medicinal products, including hormonal contraceptives, is not expected if
lenalidomide is administered alone. However, dexamethasone is known to be a weak to moderate
inducer of CYP3A4 and is likely to also affect other enzymes as well as transporters. It may not be 
excluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during treatment. Effective measures
to avoid pregnancy must be taken (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
Warfarin
Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of lenalidomide had no effect on the single dose
pharmacokinetics of R- and S- warfarin. Co-administration of a single 25 mg dose of warfarin had no
effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide. However, it is not known whether there is an
interaction during clinical use (concomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Dexamethasone is a weak
to moderate enzyme inducer and its effect on warfarin is unknown. Close monitoring of warfarin
concentration is advised during the treatment.
Digoxin
Concomitant administration with lenalidomide 10 mg once daily increased the plasma exposure of
digoxin (0.5 mg, single dose) by 14% with a 90% CI (confidence interval) [0.52%-28.2%]. It is not
known whether the effect will be different in the clinical use (higher lenalidomide doses and
concomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Therefore, monitoring of the digoxin concentration is
advised during lenalidomide treatment.
Statins
There is an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when statins are administered with lenalidomide, which
may be  simply additive. Enhanced clinical and laboratory monitoring is  warranted notably during the
first weeks of treatment.
Dexamethasone
Co-administration of single or multiple doses of dexamethasone (40 mg once daily) has no clinically
relevant effect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25 mg once daily).
Interactions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors
In vitro, lenalidomide is a substrate of P-gp, but is not a P-gp inhibitor. Co-administration of multiple
doses of the strong P-gp inhibitor quinidine (600 mg, twice daily) or the moderate P-gp
inhibitor/substrate temsirolimus (25 mg) has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of
lenalidomide (25 mg). Co-administration of lenalidomide does not alter the pharmacokinetics of
temsirolimus.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Due to the teratogenic potential, lenalidomide must be prescribed under a Pregnancy Prevention
Programme (see section 4.4) unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing 
20
potential.
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females
Women of childbearing potential should use effective method of contraception. If pregnancy occurs in
a woman treated with lenalidomide, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a
physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. If pregnancy occurs in a
partner of a male patient taking lenalidomide, it is recommended to refer the female partner to a
physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice.
Lenalidomide is present in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable
in human semen 3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a
precaution, and taking into account special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal
impairment, all male patients taking lenalidomide should use condoms throughout treatment duration,
during dose interruption and for 1 week after cessation of treatment if their partner is pregnant or of
childbearing potential and has no contraception.
Pregnancy
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects.
In monkeys lenalidomide induced malformations similar to those described with thalidomide (see 
section 5.3). Therefore, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide is expected and lenalidomide is
contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether lenalidomide is excreted in breast milk. Therefore, breast-feeding should be
discontinued during therapy with lenalidomide.
Fertility
A fertility study in rats with lenalidomide doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 200 to 500 times the
human doses of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively, based on body surface area) produced no adverse
effects on fertility and no parental toxicity.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Lenalidomide has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue,
dizziness, somnolence, vertigo and blurred vision have been reported with the use of lenalidomide.
Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide 
maintenance
A conservative approach was applied to determine the adverse reactions from CALGB 100104. The
adverse reactions described in Table 1 included events reported post-HDM/ASCT as well as events
from the maintenance treatment period. A second analysis that identified events that occurred after the
start of maintenance treatment suggests that the frequencies described in Table 1 may be higher than
actually observed during the maintenance treatment period. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse reactions
were from the maintenance treatment period only.
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with lenalidomide maintenance than
21
placebo were:
-
-
Pneumonia (10.6%; combined term) from IFM 2005-02
Lung infection (9.4% [9.4% after the start of maintenance treatment]) from CALGB 100104
In the IFM 2005-02 study, the adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide
maintenance than placebo were neutropenia (60.8%), bronchitis (47.4%), diarrhoea (38.9%),
nasopharyngitis (34.8%), muscle spasms (33.4%), leucopenia (31.7%), asthenia (29.7%), cough 
(27.3%), thrombocytopenia (23.5%), gastroenteritis (22.5%) and pyrexia (20.5%).

respiratory tract infection (26.8% [26.8%]), fatigue (22.8% [17.9%]), leucopenia (22.8% [18.8%]) and 
anaemia (21.0% [13.8%]).
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving lenalidomide 
in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone
In the SWOG S0777 study, the serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥ 5%) with 
lenalidomide in combination with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone than with lenalidomide 
in combination with dexamethasone were:
-
Hypotension (6.5%), lung infection (5.7%), dehydration (5.0%)
The adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and 
dexamethasone than with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone were: Fatigue (73.7%), 
peripheral neuropathy (71.8%), thrombocytopenia (57.6%), constipation (56.1%), hypocalcaemia 
(50.0%).
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with lenalidomide in combination with
low dose dexamethasone (Rd and Rd18) than with melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT)
were:

appetite (23.1%), cough (22.7%), pyrexia (21.4%), and muscle spasms (20.5%).
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥5%) with melphalan, prednisone and
lenalidomide followed by lenalidomide maintenance (MPR+R) or melphalan, prednisone and
lenalidomide followed by placebo (MPR+p) than melphalan, prednisone and placebo followed by
placebo (MPp+p) were:
-
-
Febrile neutropenia (6.0%)
Anaemia (5.3%)
The adverse reactions observed more frequently with MPR+R or MPR+p than MPp+p were:
neutropenia (83.3%), anaemia (70.7%), thrombocytopenia (70.0%), leucopenia (38.8%), constipation 
(34.0%), diarrhoea (33.3%), rash (28.9%), pyrexia (27.0%), peripheral oedema (25.0%), cough 
(24.0%), decreased appetite (23.7%), and asthenia (22.0%).

In two phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, 353 patients with multiple myeloma were exposed to the
lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination and 351 to the placebo/dexamethasone combination.
22
The most serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in lenalidomide/dexamethasone than
placebo/dexamethasone combination were:
-
-
Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (see section 4.4)
Grade 4 neutropenia (see section 4.4).
The observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently with lenalidomide and dexamethasone
than placebo and dexamethasone in pooled multiple myeloma clinical trials (MM-009 and MM-010)
were fatigue (43.9%), neutropenia (42.2%), constipation (40.5%), diarrhoea (38.5%), muscle cramp
(33.4%), anaemia (31.4%), thrombocytopenia (21.5%), and rash (21.2%).
Follicular lymphoma
The overall safety profile of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in patients with previously 
treated follicular lymphoma is based on data from 294 patients from a Phase 3 randomised, controlled 
study NHL-007. Additionally, adverse drug reactions from supportive study NHL-008 have been 
included in Table 3.
The serious adverse reactions observed most frequently (with a difference of at least 1 percentage 
point) in study NHL-007 in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm compared with the placebo/rituximab arm 
were:
-
-
-
Febrile neutropenia (2.7%)
Pulmonary embolism (2.7%)
Pneumonia (2.7%)
In the NHL-007 study the adverse reactions observed more frequently in the lenalidomide/rituximab 
arm compared with the placebo/rituximab arm (with at least 2% higher frequency between arms) were 
neutropenia (58.2%), diarrhoea (30.8%), leucopenia (28.8%), constipation (21.9%), cough (21.9%) 
and fatigue (21.9%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The adverse reactions observed in patients treated with lenalidomide are listed below by system organ
class and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of
decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 
1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not
known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Adverse reactions have been included under the appropriate category in the table below according to
the highest frequency observed in any of the main clinical trials.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Teratogenicity
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. In monkeys, lenalidomide induced
malformations similar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide is 
taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected.
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide 
maintenance
Lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia
compared to placebo maintenance (32.1% vs 26.7% [16.1% vs 1.8% after the start of maintenance
treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 16.4% vs 0.7% in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Treatment-emergent
AEs of neutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in 2.2% of patients in
CALGB 100104 and 2.4% of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was
reported at similar frequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms compared to placebo
maintenance arms in both studies (0.4% vs 0.5% [0.4% vs 0.5% after the start of maintenance
treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3% vs 0% in IFM 2005-02, respectively).
31
Lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4
thrombocytopenia compared to placebo maintenance (37.5% vs 30.3% [17.9% vs 4.1% after the start
of maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0% vs 2.9% in IFM 2005-02, respectively).
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving lenalidomide 
in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in the RVd arm to a lesser extent than in the Rd comparator arm 
(2.7% vs 5.9%) in the SWOG S0777 study. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar 
frequencies in the RVd arm compared to the Rd arm (0.0% vs 0.4%).
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in the RVd arm to a greater extent than in the Rd 
comparator arm (17.2 % vs 9.4%).
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with
lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients
is associated with a lower frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (8.5% in Rd and Rd18, compared with
MPT (15%). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was observed infrequently (0.6% in Rd and Rd18 compared
with 0.7% in MPT).
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients
is associated with a lower frequency of Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (8.1% in Rd and Rd18)
compared with MPT (11.1%).
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma patients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1% in
MPR+R/MPR+p) compared with MPp+p (7.8%). There was a higher frequency of Grade 4 febrile
neutropenia observed (1.7% in MPR+R/MPR+p compared to 0.0% in MPp+p).
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma patients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
(40.4% in MPR+R/MPR+p) compared with MPp+p (13.7%).
Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with
a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (5.1% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients
compared with 0.6% in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes
were observed infrequently (0.6% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 0.0%
in placebo/dexamethasone treated patients).
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with
a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9% and 1.4%, respectively, in
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3% and 0.0% in placebo/dexamethasone-
treated patients).
Follicular lymphoma patients
The combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma is associated with a 
higher rate of Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia (50.7% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients 
compared with 12.2% in placebo/rituximab treated patients). All Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia were 
reversible through dose interruption, reduction and/or supportive care with growth factors. 
Additionally, febrile neutropenia was observed infrequently (2.7% in lenalidomide/rituximab 
treated patients compared with 0.7% in placebo/rituximab treated patients).
Lenalidomide in combination with rituximab is also associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 
32
or 4 thrombocytopenia (1.4% in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared to 0% in 
placebo/rituximab patients).
Venous thromboembolism
An increased risk of DVT and PE is associated with the use of the combination of lenalidomide with
dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma, and to a lesser extent in patients treated with
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone or in patients with multiple myeloma,
treated with lenalidomide monotherapy (see section 4.5).
Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or previous history of DVT may also increase
thrombotic risk in these patients.
Myocardial infarction
Myocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with
known risk factors.
Haemorrhagic disorders
Haemorrhagic disorders are listed under several system organ classes: Blood and lymphatic system
disorders; nervous system disorders (intracranial haemorrhage); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal
disorders (epistaxis); gastrointestinal disorders (gingival bleeding, haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, rectal
haemorrhage); renal and urinary disorders (haematuria); injury, poisoning and procedural
complications (contusion) and vascular disorders (ecchymosis).
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions
Cases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous reactions 
including SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of lenalidomide. A possible cross-
reaction between lenalidomide and thalidomide has been reported in the literature.
Patients with a history of severe rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive
lenalidomide (see section 4.4).
Second primary malignancies
In clinical trials in previously treated myeloma patients with lenalidomide/dexamethasone compared to 
controls, mainly comprising of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers.
Acute myeloid leukaemia
Multiple myeloma
Cases of AML have been observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients
taking lenalidomide treatment in combination with melphalan or immediately following HDM/ASCT 
(see section 4.4). This increase was not observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma in patients taking lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared to thalidomide 
in combination with melphalan and prednisone.
Hepatic disorders
The following post-marketing adverse reactions have been reported (frequency unknown): acute
hepatic failure and cholestasis (both potentially fatal), toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, mixed
cytolytic/cholestatic hepatitis.
Rhabdomyolysis
Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been observed, some of them when lenalidomide is administered 
with a statin.
Thyroid disorders
Cases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported (see section 4.4 Thyroid 
disorders).
Tumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome
In study NHL-007, TFR was reported in 19/146 (13.0%) of patients in the lenalidomide/rituximab 
33
arm versus 1/148 (0.7%) patients in the placebo/rituximab arm. Most TFRs (18 out of 19) reported 
in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm occurred during first two cycles of treatment. One FL patient in 
the lenalidomide/rituximab arm experienced a Grade 3 TFR event versus no patients in the 
placebo/rituximab arm. In study NHL-008, 7/177 (4.0%) of FL patients experienced TFR; (3 
reports were Grade 1 and 4 reports were Grade 2 severity); while 1 report was considered serious. 
In study NHL-007, TLS occurred in 2 FL patients (1.4%) in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm and 
no FL patients in the placebo/rituximab arm; neither patient had a Grade 3 or 4 event. TLS 
occurred in 1 FL patient (0.6%) in study NHL-008. This single event was identified as a serious, 
Grade 3 adverse reaction. For study NHL-007 no patients had to discontinue 
lenalidomide/rituximab therapy due to TFR or TLS.
Gastrointestinal disorders
Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. Gastrointestinal
perforations may lead to septic complications and may be associated with fatal outcome.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no specific experience in the management of lenalidomide overdose in patients, although in
dose-ranging studies some patients were exposed to up to 150 mg, and in single-dose studies, some
patients were exposed to up to 400 mg. The dose limiting toxicity in these studies was essentially
haematological. In the event of overdose, supportive care is advised.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AX04.
Mechanism of action
Lenalidomide binds directly to cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme 
complex that includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage-binding protein 1(DDB1), cullin 4 
(CUL4), and regulator of cullins 1 (Roc1). In haematopoietic cells, lenalidomide binding to cereblon 
recruits substrate proteins Aiolos and Ikaros, lymphoid transcriptional factors, leading to their 
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation resulting in direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory 
effects.
Specifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and enhances apoptosis of certain haematopoietic 
tumour cells (including MM plasma tumour cells, follicular lymphoma tumour cells and those with 
deletions of chromosome 5), enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and 
increases the number of NK, T and NK T cells. 
The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab increases ADCC and direct tumor apoptosis in 
follicular lymphoma cells.
The lenalidomide mechanism of action also includes additional activities such as anti-angiogenic and 
pro-erythropoietic properties. Lenalidomide inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and 
adhesion of endothelial cells and the formation of microvessels, augments foetal haemoglobin 
production by CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by monocytes.
Clinical efficacy and safety
34
Lenalidomide efficacy and safety have been evaluated in six phase 3 studies in newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma, two phase 3 studies in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma and one phase 3 and 
one phase 3b study in iNHL, as described below.
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
Lenalidomide maintenance in patients who have undergone ASCT
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide maintenance was assessed in two phase 3 multicentre,
randomised, double-blind 2-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled studies: CALGB 100104 and IFM
2005-02.
CALGB 100104
Patients between 18 and 70 years of age with active MM requiring treatment and without prior
progression after initial treatment were eligible.
Patients were randomised 1:1 within 90-100 days after ASCT to receive either lenalidomide or placebo
maintenance. The maintenance dose was 10 mg once daily on days 1-28 of repeated 28-day cycles
(increased up to 15 mg once daily after 3 months in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity), and
treatment was continued until disease progression.
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS) from randomisation to
the date of progression or death, whichever occurred first; the study was not powered for the overall
survival endpoint. In total 460 patients were randomised: 231 patients to lenalidomide and 229 patients
to placebo. The demographic and disease-related characteristics were balanced across both arms.
The study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after surpassing
the threshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients in the placebo arm
were allowed to cross over to receive lenalidomide before disease progression.
The results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 17
December 2009 (15.5 months follow up) showed a 62% reduction in risk of disease progression or
death favouring lenalidomide (HR = 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.54; p <0.001). The median overall PFS was 
33.9 months (95% CI NE, NE) in the lenalidomide arm versus 19.0 months (95% CI 16.2, 25.6) in the
placebo arm.
The PFS benefit was observed both in the subgroup of patients with CR and in the subgroup of patients
who had not achieved a CR.
The results for the study, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016, are presented in Table 5.

Data cuts: 17 Dec 2009 and 01 Feb 2016
IFM 2005-02
Patients aged < 65 years at diagnosis who had undergone ASCT and had achieved at least a stable
disease response at the time of hematologic recovery were eligible. Patients were randomised 1:1 to
receive either lenalidomide or placebo maintenance (10 mg once daily on days 1-28 of repeated 28-day
cycles increased up to 15 mg once daily after 3 months in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity)
following 2 courses of lenalidomide consolidation (25 mg/day, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle). Treatment
was to be continued until disease progression.
The primary endpoint was PFS defined from randomisation to the date of progression or death,
whichever occurred first; the study was not powered for the overall survival endpoint. In total 614
patients were randomised: 307 patients to lenalidomide and 307 patients to placebo.
The study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after surpassing
the threshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients receiving placebo
were not crossed over to lenalidomide therapy prior to progressive disease. The lenalidomide arm was
discontinued, as a proactive safety measure, after observing an imbalance of SPMs (see Section 4.4).
The results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 7 July
2010 (31.4 months follow up) showed a 48% reduction in risk of disease progression or death favouring
lenalidomide (HR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.41, 0.66; p <0.001). The median overall PFS was 40.1 months 
(95% CI 35.7, 42.4) in the lenalidomide arm versus 22.8 months (95% CI 20.7, 27.4) in the placebo
arm.
The PFS benefit was less in the subgroup of patients with CR than in the subgroup of patients who had
not achieved a CR.
The updated PFS, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016 (96.7 months follow up) continues to show a PFS
advantage: HR = 0.57 (95% CI 0.47, 0.68; p < 0.001). The median overall PFS was 44.4 months (39.6,
52.0) in the lenalidomide arm versus 23.8 months (95% CI 21.2, 27.3) in the placebo arm. For PFS2,
the observed HR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.66, 0.98; p = 0.026) for lenalidomide versus placebo. The median
overall PFS2 was 69.9 months (95% CI 58.1, 80.0) in the lenalidomide arm versus 58.4 months (95%
CI 51.1, 65.0) in the placebo arm. For OS, the observed HR was 0.90: (95% CI 0.72, 1.13; p = 0.355)
for lenalidomide versus placebo. The median overall survival time was 105.9 months (95% CI 88.8, 
NE) in the lenalidomide arm versus 88.1 months (95% CI 80.7, 108.4) in the placebo arm.
Lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who are not eligible for 
stem cell transplantation
The SWOG S0777 study evaluated the addition of bortezomib to a foundation of lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone, as initial treatment, followed by continued Rd until disease progression, in patients 
with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are either ineligible for transplant or eligible for 
transplant with no plan to undertake immediate transplant.
Patients in the lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) arm received lenalidomide 
25 mg/day orally on days 1-14, intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and 
dexamethasone 20 mg/day orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of repeated 21-day cycles for up to 
eight 21-day cycles (24 weeks). Patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) arm received 
lenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on days 1-21, and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on days 1, 8, 15, 
36
and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles for up to six 28-day cycles (24 weeks). Patients in both arms took 
continued Rd: lenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on 
days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles.
Treatment was to be continued until disease progression.
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 523 patients 
were enrolled into the study, with 263 patients randomised to RVd and 260 patients randomised to Rd. 
The demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of the patients were well balanced 
between arms.
The results of PFS, as assessed by IRAC, at the time of the primary analysis, using a cut-off of 05 
November 2015 (50.6 months follow up) showed a 24% reduction in risk of disease progression or 
death favouring RVd (HR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.61, 0.94; p = 0.010). The median overall PFS was 42.5 
months (95% CI 34.0, 54.8) in the RVd arm versus 29.9 months (95% CI 25.6, 38.2) in the Rd arm. 
The benefit was observed regardless of eligibility for stem cell transplant.
The results for the study, using a cut-off of 01 December 2016, where the median follow-up time for 
all surviving subjects was 69.0 months, are presented in Table 6. The benefit favouring RVd was 
observed regardless of eligibility for stem cell transplant.

The proportion of subjects alive after 7 years was 54.7% in the RVd arm versus 44.7% in the Rd arm.
Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in patients who are not eligible for stem cell 
transplantation
The safety and efficacy of lenalidomide was assessed in a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label,
3-arm study (MM-020) of patients who were at least 65 years of age or older or, if younger than 65 
years of age, were not candidates for stem cell transplantation because they declined to undergo stem
cell transplantation or stem cell transplantation is not available to the patient due to cost or other
reason. The study (MM-020) compared lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) given for 2 different
durations of time (i.e., until progressive disease [Arm Rd] or for up to eighteen 28-day cycles [72
37
weeks, Arm Rd18]) to melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) for a maximum of twelve 42-day
cycles (72 weeks). Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Patients were stratified at
randomisation by age (≤75 versus >75 years), stage (ISS Stages I and II versus Stage III), and country.
Patients in the Rd and Rd18 arms took lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on days 1 to 21 of 28-day cycles
according to protocol arm. Dexamethasone 40 mg was dosed once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of
each 28-day cycle. Initial dose and regimen for Rd and Rd18 were adjusted according to age and renal
function (see section 4.2). Patients >75 years received a dexamethasone dose of 20 mg once daily on
days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. All patients received prophylactic anticoagulation (low
molecular weight heparin, warfarin, heparin, low-dose aspirin) during the study.
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 1623 patients
were enrolled into the study, with 535 patients randomised to Rd, 541 patients randomised to Rd18 and
547 patients randomised to MPT. The demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of the 
patients were well balanced in all 3 arms. In general, study subjects had advanced-stage disease: of the
total study population, 41% had ISS stage III, 9% had severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance
[CLcr] < 30 mL/min). The median age was 73 in the 3 arms.
In an updated analysis of PFS, PFS2 and OS using a cut off of 3 March 2014 where the median follow-
up time for all surviving subjects was 45.5 months, the results of the study are presented in Table 7:

Lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone followed by maintenance therapy in 
patients who are not eligible for transplant
The safety and efficacy of lenalidomide was assessed in a phase 3 multicentre, randomised double
blind 3 arm study (MM-015) of patients who were 65 years or older and had a serum creatinine
<2.5 mg/dL. The study compared lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (MPR)
with or without lenalidomide maintenance therapy until disease progression, to that of melphalan and
prednisone for a maximum of 9 cycles. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment
arms. Patients were stratified at randomisation by age (75 vs. > 75 years) and stage (ISS; Stages I and 
II vs. stage III).
This study investigated the use of combination therapy of MPR (melphalan 0.18 mg/kg orally on days
1 to 4 of repeated 28-day cycles; prednisone 2 mg/kg orally on days 1 to 4 of repeated 28-day cycles;
and lenalidomide 10 mg/day orally on days 1 to 21 of repeated 28-day cycles) for induction therapy, up 
to 9 cycles. Patients who completed 9 cycles or who were unable to complete 9 cycles due to
intolerance proceeded to maintenance therapy starting with lenalidomide 10 mg orally on days 1 to 21
of repeated 28-day cycles until disease progression.
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 459 patients
were enrolled into the study, with 152 patients randomised to MPR+R, 153 patients randomised to
MPR+p and 154 patients randomised to MPp+p. The demographics and disease-related baseline
characteristics of the patients were well balanced in all 3 arms; notably, approximately 50% of the
patients enrolled in each arm had the following characteristics; ISS Stage III, and creatinine clearance < 
60 mL/min. The median age was 71 in the MPR+R and MPR+p arms and 72 in the MPp+p arm.
In an analysis of PFS, PFS2, OS using a cut-off of April 2013 where the median follow up time for all
surviving subjects was 62.4 months, the results of the study are presented in Table 8:

Supportive newly diagnosed multiple myeloma studies
An open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 study (ECOG E4A03) was conducted in 445 patients
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma; 222 patients were randomised to the lenalidomide/low dose
dexamethasone arm, and 223 were randomised to the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm.
Patients randomised to the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm received lenalidomide
25 mg/day, days 1 to 21 every 28 days plus dexamethasone 40 mg/day on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17
to 20 every 28 days for the first four cycles. Patients randomised to the lenalidomide/low dose
dexamethasone arm received lenalidomide 25 mg/day, days 1 to 21 every 28 days plus low dose
dexamethasone – 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days. In the lenalidomide/low dose
dexamethasone group, 20 patients (9.1%) underwent at least one dose interruption compared to 65
patients (29.3%) in the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm.
In a post-hoc analysis, lower mortality was observed in the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone arm
6.8% (15/220) compared to the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm 19.3% (43/223), in the
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patient population, with a median follow up of 72.3 weeks.
However with a longer follow-up, the difference in overall survival in favour of lenalidomide/ low
dose dexamethasone tends to decrease.
Multiple myeloma with at least one prior therapy
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide were evaluated in two phase 3 multicentre, randomised,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group controlled studies (MM-009 and MM-010) of
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone therapy versus dexamethasone alone in previously treated patients
with multiple myeloma. Out of 353 patients in the MM-009 and MM-010 studies who received
lenalidomide/dexamethasone, 45.6% were aged 65 or over. Of the 704 patients evaluated in the MM-
009 and MM-010 studies, 44.6% were aged 65 or over.
In both studies, patients in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone (len/dex) group took 25 mg of
lenalidomide orally once daily on days 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on days 22
to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in the placebo/dexamethasone (placebo/dex) group took 1 placebo
capsule on days 1 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of
dexamethasone orally once daily on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first
4 cycles of therapy. The dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 4
of each 28-day cycle after the first 4 cycles of therapy. In both studies, treatment was to continue until
disease progression. In both studies, dose adjustments were allowed based on clinical and laboratory
finding.
40
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was time to progression (TTP). In total, 353 patients
were evaluated in the MM-009 study; 177 in the len/dex group and 176 in the placebo/dex group and,
in total, 351 patients were evaluated in the MM-010 study; 176 in the len/dex group and 175 in the
placebo/dex group.
In both studies, the baseline demographic and disease-related characteristics were comparable between
the len/dex and placebo/dex groups. Both patient populations presented a median age of 63 years, with
a comparable male to female ratio. The ECOG performance status was comparable between both
groups, as was the number and type of prior therapies.
Pre-planned interim analyses of both studies showed that len/dex was statistically significantly
superior (p < 0.00001) to dexamethasone alone for the primary efficacy endpoint, TTP (median
follow-up duration of 98.0 weeks). Complete response and overall response rates in the len/dex arm
were also significantly higher than the placebo/dex arm in both studies. Results of these analyses
subsequently led to an unblinding in both studies, in order to allow patients in the placebo/dex group to 
receive treatment with the len/dex combination.
An extended follow-up efficacy analysis was conducted with a median follow-up of 130.7 weeks.
Table 9 summarises the results of the follow-up efficacy analyses – pooled studies MM-009 and MM-
010.
In this pooled extended follow-up analysis, the median TTP was 60.1 weeks (95% CI: 44.3, 73.1) in
patients treated with len/dex (N = 353) versus 20.1 weeks (95% CI: 17.7, 20.3) in patients treated with
placebo/dex (N = 351). The median progression free survival was 48.1 weeks (95% CI: 36.4, 62.1) in
patients treated with len/dex versus 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 16.1, 20.1) in patients treated with
placebo/dex. The median duration of treatment was 44.0 weeks (min: 0.1, max: 254.9) for len/dex and 
23.1 weeks (min: 0.3, max: 238.1) for placebo/dex. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and
overall response (CR+PR) rates in the len/dex arm remain significantly higher than in the placebo/dex
arm in both studies. The median overall survival in the extended follow-up analysis of the pooled
studies is 164.3 weeks (95% CI: 145.1, 192.6) in patients treated with len/dex versus 136.4 weeks (95%
CI: 113.1, 161.7) in patients treated with placebo/dex. Despite the fact that 170 out of the 351 patients
randomised to placebo/dex received lenalidomide after disease progression or after the studies were
unblinded, the pooled analysis of overall survival demonstrated a statistically significant survival
advantage for len/dex relative to placebo/dex (HR = 0.833, 95% CI = [0.687, 1.009], p=0.045).

AUGMENT - CC-5013-NHL-007
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab versus rituximab plus 
placebo was evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory iNHL including FL in a phase 3, 
multicentre, randomised, double- blind controlled study (CC-5013-NHL-007 [AUGMENT]).
A total of 358 patients who were at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed MZL or 
Grade 1, 2 or 3a FL (CD20+ by flow cytometry or histochemistry) as assessed by the investigator 
or local pathologist were randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects had been previously treated with at 
least one prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy.
Lenalidomide was administered orally 20 mg once daily for the first 21 days of repeating 28-day 
cycles for 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity. The dose of rituximab was 375 mg/m2 every 
week in Cycle 1 (days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and on day 1 of every 28-day cycle from cycles 2 through 5. 
All dosage calculations for rituximab were based on the patient’s body surface area (BSA), using 
actual patient weight.
The demographic and disease-related baseline characteristics were similar across the 2 treatment 
groups.
The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of lenalidomide in combination 
with rituximab to rituximab plus placebo in subjects with relapsed/refractory FL Grade 1, 2 or 3a or 
MZL. Efficacy determination was based upon PFS as the primary endpoint, as assessed by the IRC 
using the 2007 International Working Group (IWG) criteria but without positron emission 
tomography (PET).
The secondary objectives of the study were to compare the safety of lenalidomide in combination 
with rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo. Further secondary objectives were to compare the 
efficacy of rituximab plus lenalidomide versus rituximab plus placebo using the following other 
parameters of efficacy: Overall response rate (ORR), CR rate, and duration of response (DoR) by 
IWG 2007 without PET and OS.
Results from the overall population including FL and MZL showed that at a median follow up of
28.3°months, the study met its primary endpoint of PFS with a hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence 
interval [CI]) of 0.45 (0.33,0.61) p-value < 0.0001. The efficacy results from the follicular 
lymphoma population are presented in Table 10.

Follicular lymphoma for patients refractory to Rituximab
MAGNIFY - CC-5013-NHL-008
A total of 232 subjects who were at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed FL (Grade 1, 2, 
3a or MZL), as assessed by the investigator or local pathologist, were enrolled into the initial treatment 
period with 12 cycles of lenalidomide plus rituximab. Subjects who achieved CR/CRu, PR, or SD by 
the end of the induction treatment period were randomised to enter the maintenance treatment period. 
All enrolled subjects must have previously been treated with at least one prior systemic antilymphoma 
therapy. In contrast to study NHL-007, the NHL-008 study included patients who were refractory to 
rituximab (no response or relapsed within 6 months of rituximab treatment or who were double-
refractory to rituximab and chemotherapy).
During the induction treatment period, lenalidomide 20 mg was given on Days 1-21 of repeated 28-
day cycles for up to 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent or disease 
progression. The dose of rituximab was 375 mg/m2 every week in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and 
on Day 1 of every other 28-day cycle (cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) up to 12 cycles therapy. All dosage 
calculations for rituximab were based on the patient body surface area (BSA) and actual weight.
The data presented are based on an interim analysis focusing on the single-arm induction treatment 
period. Efficacy determinations are based on ORR by best response as the primary endpoint, using a 
modification of the 1999 International Working Group Response Criteria (IWGRC). The secondary 
objective was to evaluate other parameters of efficacy, such as DoR.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted a product-specific waiver for the reference 
medicinal product containing lenalidomide that applies to all subsets of the paediatric population for 
mature B-cell neoplasm conditions (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can therefore exist as the optically active forms S(-)
and R(+). Lenalidomide is produced as a racemic mixture. Lenalidomide is generally more soluble in
organic solvents but exhibits the greatest solubility in 0.1N HCl buffer.
Absorption
Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration in healthy volunteers, under fasting
conditions, with maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.5 and 2 hours post-dose. In
patients, as well as in healthy volunteers, the maximum concentration (Cmax) and area-under-the-
concentration time curve (AUC) increase proportionally with increases in dose. Multiple dosing does
not cause marked medicinal product accumulation. In plasma, the relative exposures of the S- and R-
enantiomers of lenalidomide are approximately 56% and 44%, respectively.
Co-administration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal in healthy volunteers reduces the extent of
absorption, resulting in an approximately 20% decrease in area under the concentration versus time
curve (AUC) and 50% decrease in Cmax in plasma. However, in the main multiple myeloma registration
trials where the efficacy and safety were established for lenalidomide, the medicinal product was
administered without regard to food intake. Thus, lenalidomide can be administered with or without
food.
Distribution
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins was low with mean plasma protein binding at
23% and 29% in multiple myeloma patients and healthy volunteers, respectively.
Lenalidomide is present in human semen (< 0.01% of the dose) after administration of 25 mg/day and
the medicinal product is undetectable in semen of a healthy subject 3 days after stopping the substance
(see section 4.4).
44
Biotransformation and elimination
Results from human in vitro metabolism studies indicate that lenalidomide is not metabolised by
cytochrome P450 enzymes suggesting that administration of lenalidomide with medicinal products that
inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes is not likely to result in metabolic medicinal product interactions in 
humans. In vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A, or UGT1A1. Therefore, lenalidomide is unlikely to cause any
clinically relevant medicinal product interactions when co-administered with substrates of these
enzymes.
In vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide is not a substrate of human breast cancer resistance protein
(BCRP), multidrug resistance protein (MRP) transporters MRP1, MRP2, or MRP3, organic anion
transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1),
organic cation transporters (OCT) OCT1 and OCT2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)
MATE1, and organic cation transporters novel (OCTN) OCTN1 and OCTN2.
In vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on human bile salt export pump
(BSEP), BCRP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT2.
A majority of lenalidomide is eliminated through urinary excretion. The contribution of renal excretion
to total clearance in subjects with normal renal function was 90%, with 4% of lenalidomide eliminated
in faeces.
Lenalidomide is poorly metabolized as 82% of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Hydroxy-
lenalidomide and N-acetyl-lenalidomide represent 4.59% and 1.83% of the excreted dose, respectively.
The renal clearance of lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is at least
actively secreted to some extent.
At doses of 5 to 25 mg/day, half-life in plasma is approximately 3 hours in healthy volunteers and
ranges from 3 to 5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma.
Elderly
No dedicated clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in the
elderly. Population pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with ages ranging from 39 to 85 years
old and indicate that age does not influence lenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). Because
elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection
and it would be prudent to monitor renal function.
Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide was studied in subjects with renal impairment due to
nonmalignant conditions. In this study, two methods were used to classify renal function: the urinary
creatinine clearance measured over 24 hours and the creatinine clearance estimated by Cockcroft-
Gault formula. The results indicate that as renal function decreases (< 50 mL/min), the total
lenalidomide clearance decreases proportionally resulting in an increase in AUC. The AUC was
increased by approximately 2.5, 4 and 5-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment, severe renal
impairment, and end-stage renal disease, respectively, compared to the group combining subjects with
normal renal function and subjects with mild renal impairment. The half-life of lenalidomide increased
from approximately 3.5 hours in subjects with creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min to more than 9 hours
in subjects with reduced renal function < 50 mL/min. However, renal impairment did not alter the oral
absorption of lenalidomide. The Cmax was similar between healthy subjects and patients with renal
impairment. Approximately 30% of the medicinal product in the body was removed during a single 4-
hour dialysis session. Recommended dose adjustments in patients with impaired renal function are
described in section 4.2.
45
Hepatic impairment
Population pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with mild hepatic impairment (N=16, total
bilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 x ULN or AST > ULN) and indicate that mild hepatic impairment does not
influence lenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). There are no data available for patients with
moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
Other intrinsic factors
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that body weight (33- 135 kg), gender, race and type of
haematological malignancy do not have a clinically relevant effect on lenalidomide clearance in adult
patients.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
An embryofoetal development study has been conducted in monkeys administered lenalidomide at
doses from 0.5 and up to 4 mg/kg/day. Findings from this study indicate that lenalidomide produced
external malformations including non-patent anus and malformations of upper and lower extremities
(bent, shortened, malformed, malrotated and/or absent part of the extremities, oligo and/or
polydactyly) in the offspring of female monkeys who received the active substance during pregnancy.
Various visceral effects (discoloration, red foci at different organs, small colourless mass above atrio-
ventricular valve, small gall bladder, malformed diaphragm) were also observed in single foetuses.
Lenalidomide has a potential for acute toxicity; minimum lethal doses after oral administration were > 
2000 mg/kg/day in rodents. Repeated oral administration of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day to rats for up 
to 26 weeks produced a reversible treatment-related increase in kidney pelvis mineralisation in all 3 
doses, most notably in females. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be
less than 75 mg/kg/day, and is approximately 25-fold greater than the human daily exposure based on
AUC exposure. Repeated oral administration of 4 and 6 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 20 weeks
produced mortality and significant toxicity (marked weight loss, reduced red and white blood cell and
platelet counts, multiple organ haemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract inflammation, lymphoid, and bone
marrow atrophy). Repeated oral administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 1 year
produced reversible changes in bone marrow cellularity, a slight decrease in myeloid/erythroid cell
ratio and thymic atrophy. Mild suppression of white blood cell count was observed at 1 mg/kg/day
corresponding to approximately the same human dose based on AUC comparisons.
In vitro (bacterial mutation, human lymphocytes, mouse lymphoma, Syrian Hamster Embryo cell
transformation) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at
either the gene or chromosomal level. Carcinogenicity studies with lenalidomide have not been
conducted.
Developmental toxicity studies were previously conducted in rabbits. In these studies, rabbits were
administered 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day orally. An absence of the intermediate lobe of the lung was
observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day with dose dependence and displaced kidneys were observed at 20 
mg/kg/day. Although it was observed at maternotoxic levels they may be attributable to a direct effect.
Soft tissue and skeletal variations in the foetuses were also observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day.

-
-
Multiple myeloma
Follicular lymphoma
Multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain kind of white blood cell, called the 
plasma cell. These cells collect in the bone marrow and divide, becoming out of control. This can 
damage the bones and kidneys.
Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms can be greatly 
reduced or disappear for a period of time. This is called a ‘response’.
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who have had a bone marrow transplant
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto is used on its own as a maintenance therapy after patients have 
recovered enough following a bone marrow transplant.
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who cannot have a bone marrow transplant
Lenalidomide Krka d.d. Novo mesto is taken with other medicines. These may include:
-
-
-
a chemotherapy medicine called ‘bortezomib’
an anti-inflammatory medicine called ‘dexamethasone’
a chemotherapy medicine called ‘melphalan’ and

an immunosuppressant medicine called ‘prednisone’.
-
You will take these other medicines at the start of treatment and then continue to take Lenalidomide

your blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen.

treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma.

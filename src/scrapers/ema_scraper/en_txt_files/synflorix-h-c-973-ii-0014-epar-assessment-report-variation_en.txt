1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
The aim of this type II variation is to update the Summary of the Product Characteristics in section 4.2 
with a recommendation for use of Synflorix with 2+1 schedule in routine infant immunization 
programmes based on the availability of immunogenicity data following primary vaccination and 
booster vaccination in subjects receiving Synflorix according to a 2+1 or 3+1 schedule. Two clinical 
trials were already presented in the registration file: the 2-dose primary vaccination study 10PN-PD-
DIT-002 and the 2-dose data from study 10PN-PD-DIT-011 including a post-hoc head to head 
comparison with Prevenar. The more recent study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 is the 2-3 years follow-up of 
study 002 and provides new data on persistence of antibodies for 2-3 years after a booster dose at 11-
12 months of age and an anamnestic response to an additional challenge dose (long-term immune 
response). Due to the shortness of time since licensure of Synflorix, there are currently no 
effectiveness data available. 
In addition, this variation application aims to update section 5.1 to reflect immunogenicity data on the 
2-dose primary schedule and the new immunological data from study 10PN-PD-DIT-046. The Package 
Leaflet has also been updated to reflect the total number of vaccine doses given to children. 
1.2.  Clinical aspects 
Clinical studies supporting the proposed changes 
Study 002 was part of the initial registration file in Europe and compared the post-primary and post-
booster immunogenicity following a 2+1 and 3+1 schedules for 10Pn-PD-DiT. A post-hoc analysis of 
study 011, was performed upon request of CHMP and provided a head to head comparison between 
10Pn-PD-DiT and Prevenar following two vaccine doses administered according to a 2, 4 month 
schedule. The recent study 046 assessed the persistence and immunological memory following 2+1 
and 3+1 vaccination and is the follow-up of study 002. An overview of the studies submitted is 
presented in Table 1. 
Only the new data presented in the Clinical Study Report of study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 are assessed in 
full in the current variation application. The data from studies 002 and 011 are presented first since 
they evaluate short term immunogenicity. Subsequently the new data from study 046 on longer term 
immunogenicity are evaluated.

Good clinical practice 
All studies were carried out by experienced investigators and all these studies were conducted in 
accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The protocols reflected the Declaration of 
Helsinki and its amendments as well as the GCP guidelines in use at the study outset. 
Methods to evaluate immunogenicity  
Total IgG antibodies specific to serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F were each 
measured by 22F-inhibition ELISA. The antibody concentration was determined by logistic log 
comparisons of the ELISA curves with the standard reference serum 89-SF for which concentration of 
IgM and IgG to the 10 serotypes was known in μg/ml. The cut off of the assay was 0.05 μg/ml. 
S. pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) was measured by a killing assay using a human HL-60 
cell line. The cut-off of the assay was an opsonic titre of 8. 
The ELISA antibody concentrations and OPA against the cross-reactive serotypes 6A and 19A were also 
determined (cut-off of the assay was 0.05 μg/ml for ELISA and 8 for OPA).

Anti-PD antibodies were determined by an ELISA assay (GSK Biologicals). Specific PD antibodies were 
determined using a standard reference serum. The cut-off of the assay was 100EL U/ml. 
The B-cell enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay allows the quantification of antigen specific 
memory B-cells after in vitro differentiation of B memory cells into antibody secreting plasma cells. The 
results are expressed as the frequencies of antigen-specific memory B-cells within the total memory B-
cell population. 
All serological assays used were performed in GSK Biologicals laboratory using standardised and 
validated procedures with adequate controls. 
Methods used to evaluate efficacy 
Antibody concentrations as measured by ELISA and OPA against all vaccine serotypes and vaccine 
related serotypes 6A and 19A were evaluated in all studies. The analysis was performed on the ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity but, in study 046, the ATP cohort for persistence included all subjects in the 
ATP cohort for safety with assay data for at least one vaccine serotype or protein D. The immune 
responses as measured by ELISA were evaluated in terms of percentages of subjects reaching an 
antibody concentration of 0.20 g/ml, and the geometric mean antibody concentrations (GMC). The 
percentage of subjects reaching an OPA titre of 8 and the geometric mean OPA titres (GMT) against 
the 10 vaccine serotypes one month after vaccination in studies 002 and 046 and two months post-
dose 2 in the post-hoc analysis of study 011 were assessed. If more than 5 % of the vaccinated 
subjects with immunogenicity results were excluded from the ATP cohort of immunogenicity, a 
secondary analysis of immunogenicity was conducted on the Total Vaccinated cohort that included all 
vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. 
The GMC/T calculations were performed by taking the anti-log10 of the mean of the log10 titer/ 
concentration transformations. Antibody titers below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary 
value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC/T calculation. 
In all studies and for each group, seropositivity rates with exact 95% CI and geometric mean antibody 
concentration/titre (GMC/T), with 95% CI, were calculated using standard methods.  
Populations evaluated 
Studies were conducted in healthy male and female children after checking eligibility criteria at study 
entry. In studies 002 and 011, exclusion criteria aimed to prevent administration of the candidate 
vaccine to individuals with medical conditions that might potentially interfere with the evaluation of the 
immune response; those in whom previous exposure to the vaccine antigens through vaccination or 
disease would prevent interpretation of the results and those individuals at risk of possible adverse 
reactions to the vaccine. Studies 002, 011 and 046 were conducted in EU countries; Denmark, 
Germany, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. The majority (>90%) of subjects who 
participated in the clinical studies were White/Caucasian. Males and females were approximately 
equally represented in all studies. 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria were similar across all studies with exception of the age range for 
enrolment and the vaccines given prior to clinical trials. 
Statistical methods  
The following descriptive analyses were common to all studies. For each treatment group, at each 
time-point that a blood-sample result was available: 
Assessment report

  Antibody GMCs/GMTs with 95% CIs was tabulated. 
 
 
Percentage of subjects with pneumococcal antibody concentrations >0.20 µg/ml with exact 
95% CIs was calculated for each serotype. 
Percentage of subjects with OPA titers >8 with exact 95% CIs was calculated for each 
serotype. 
Additional comparative, inferential analyses were performed in all studies, but are not reported here as 
the results are not directly relevant to the current application. 
Study objectives of studies 10PN-PD-DIT-002 and -011 
Study 10PN-PD-DIT-002  
Study 002 is an open, randomised clinical phase III trial with two parallel groups. The design is 
summarised in Table 1 above and in Figure 1. 
The primary objective was to assess the post-dose 2 immune response elicited by 10Pn-PD-DiT 
administered according to a 2-4-11 month schedule. Secondary immunogenicity objectives included 
evaluation of immunogenicity of 10Pn-PD-DiT in the 2-3-4-11 month schedule and evaluation of 
persistence of the immune response at 11 months of age. Safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine 
were also evaluated in this study.

Study 10PN-PD-DIT-011 
Study 011 is an open, randomised, controlled study with four parallel groups: (i) Group Pn-Men: 10Pn-
PD-DiT + DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib + Meningitec, (ii) Group Pn-Neis:10Pn-PD-DiT+ DTPa -HBV-IPV/Hib + 
NeisVac-C, (iii) Group Pn-HibC: 10Pn-PD-DiT + DTPa-HBV-IPV + Hib-MenC and (iv) Group Pr-HibC: 
Prevenar + DTPa -HBV-IPV + Hib-MenC. The study vaccines were administered at 2-4-6 months of age 
with the exception of Neisvac-C and Meningitec, for which two doses were administered at 2 and 4 
months of age. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that 10Pn-PD-DiT, when administered as a 3-dose primary 
course, is non-inferior to Prevenar, both co-administered with DTPa-HBV-IPV and Hib-MenC vaccines, 
in terms of post-immunization febrile reactions with fever > 39.0°C (measured rectally). 
Immunogenicity of 10Pn-PD-DiT was also evaluated in this study. 
This study is the only study to date that included a Prevenar group and where a blood sample was 
collected after the second dose. Immunogenicity was evaluated 1 month after the third dose as a 
secondary objective and 2 months after the second dose in a post-hoc analysis. After the second

primary dose, anti-pneumococcal immune responses were analyzed for a random subset of sera (about 
one-third) from the 10Pn-PD-DiT groups and all available sera from Prevenar vaccines.  
RESULTS - 10PN-PD-DIT-002 and -011  
Study 10PN-PD-DIT-002 (Denmark, Norway, Slovak Republic, Sweden) 
A total of 351 subjects were vaccinated in the study and received at least one dose of 10-Pn-PD-DiT. 
The mean age at first vaccination was 12.1 weeks (SD+1.91). Among 342 subjects who completed the 
study, a total of 9 subjects were withdrawn and one subject from the 3+1 group was withdrawn due to 
an SAE and two subjects (one in each group) were withdrawn due to a non-SAE.  
Out of 351 subjects, 312 (88.9%) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity.  
Comparison of immune responses with 10Pn-PD-DiT following 2+1 and 3+1 vaccination 
schedule 
Post primary: 
One month post primary vaccination at least 92.8% in the 2+1 group and 96.1% of subjects in 3+1 
group reached the ELISA antibody threshold of >0.20 μg/ml against each of the serotypes, except  
for serotypes 6B  (2- dose group: 55.7%; 3 -dose group: 63.l %) and 23F (2 dose group: 69.3%; 3 
dose group: 77.4 %). For most serotypes, post primary ELISA GMCs were higher (no overlap of CIs) 
after the 3 dose priming than after the 2 dose priming, particularly for 18C and for 19F. One month 
post-primary vaccination at least 20% and 42.7% of subjects had antibody concentrations > 0.20 
μg/ml against serotypes 6A and 19A, respectively. 
There was a lower percentage of subjects with OPA titers 8 in 2-dose primed subjects compared to 3-
dose primed subjects for serotypes 6B, 18C and 23F (74.4%, 82.8%, 86.3% respectively for the 2-
dose schedule and 88.9%, 96.2%, 97.7%, respectively for the 3-dose schedule). 
Pre-booster: 
In the time period after primary and before booster vaccination, a decline in ELISA GMCs was observed 
in both groups for all serotypes, except 6B and 23F. Persistence of the immune response was 
evaluated at 11 months of age, in both groups the rate with concentrations >0.20μg/ml was at least 
78.9% in the 2-dose group and at least 89.3% in the 3-dose group except for serotypes 1, 6B and 
23F (51.7%, 65.6%, 71.5%, respectively for the 2-dose schedule and 68.7%, 76.0%, 78.4%, 
respectively for the 3-dose schedule). 
The persistence of OPA immune response by serotype varied widely. At least 45.1% in the 2-dose 
groups and at least 42.1% in the 3 dose group remained at an OPA titre > 8, except for serotypes 1, 
4 and 18C in the 2 dose group (9.6%, 39.4%, 24.6%, respectively) and except for serotypes 1, 5 
and 18C in the 3 dose group (15.7%, 41.5%, 49.3%, respectively). The OPA GMTs were particularly 
low for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 18 C and 19F in both groups. For all serotypes except 23F, GMTs were higher 
in the 3-dose group. 
Post-booster: 
A booster dose to subjects primed with either 2 or 3 doses elicited increases in antibody concentration 
against all antigens. One month after the booster dose the percentage of subjects with antibody 
concentrations >0.20μg was at least 95.9% for each of the vaccine serotypes in both groups with the 
exception of serotype 6B  which was 88.5% in the 2-dose group, and 96.6% in the 3 dose group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795221/2011  
Page 6/33
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For most serotypes the ELISA GMCs were higher following the 3-dose primary vaccination course and 
similarly also post-booster vaccination, except for serotype 1. 
An increase in OPA GMTs was observed for all serotypes. At least 82.6% of subjects in the 2-dose 
group and 90.8% in the 3-dose group had OPA activity >8 after primary vaccination, except for 
serotypes 5 and 6B. A trend for higher OPA GMTs measured post-primary and post-booster was 
observed in the 3+1 groups compared to the 2+1 group. 
Serotypes 6A and 19A 
One month post-primary vaccination, at least 20% and 42.7% of subjects had antibody concentrations 
>0.20 µg/ml against serotypes 6A and 19A, respectively, in both groups. Post-booster vaccination, at 
least 63.6% and 81.4% of subjects reached antibody level >0.20 µg/ml against serotypes 6A and 19A, 
respectively. After primary vaccination at least 39.8% and 12.8% of subjects had OPA titre > 8 against 
serotypes 6A and 19A, respectively, in both groups. One month post booster vaccination, at least 
57.1% and 24.4% of subjects had OPA titre > 8 against serotypes 6A and 19A, respectively.  The 
GMTs observed after the booster dose in the 2-dose primary schedule remained below those observed 
after the booster dose in the 3-dose schedule. 
Protein D: Overall 98.0% of subjects in the 2-dose priming group and all subjects in the 3-dose 
priming group were seropositive for anti-PD antibodies. Prior to the booster dose, 90.1% of subjects in 
the 2-dose group and 95.3% in the 3-dose group remained seropositive for anti-PD antibodies, 
whereas one month post booster vaccination all children except one in the 2-dose priming group had 
anti-PD antibodies > 100 EL U/ml. 
In conclusion, for most serotypes, the ELISA GMCs were higher following 3-dose primary vaccination 
course compared to the 2-dose primary course. The same trend was observed post-booster 
vaccination, except for serotype 1. The difference between groups became less marked after the 
booster dose for both ELISA and OPA, but was still significant for percentage of subjects reaching 
ELISA/OPA thresholds for serotypes 6B (ELISA) and 5 (OPA). 
Study 10PN-PD-DIT-011 (Germany, Spain, Poland) 
A total of 1572 subjects were enrolled. Due to the findings of an audit, 24 subjects from one centre 
were eliminated from the total vaccinated cohort, leaving 1548 subjects for analysis. Of these, 1158 
received at least one dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT. The mean age of first vaccination was 8.1 weeks (SD + 
2.23 weeks). Forty-nine subjects were withdrawn, three due to SAE (2 subjects in the Pn-Neis group 
and 1 subject in the Pn-HibC group). A total of 1499 subjects completed the study. 
Overall 698/1548 (45.1%) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. 
A total of 766 subjects were not planned to have any blood sampling and received a specific 
elimination code. 
  Post-hoc head to head comparison of 10Pn-PD-DiT and Prevenar after 2 primary doses  
Study 011 evaluated the immune responses in infants vaccinated with either Prevenar or 10Pn-PD-DiT 
at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. A post-hoc analysis of the immunogenicity data measured 2 months 
after the second vaccine dose was performed to provide comparative data with Prevenar. 
For each of the 7 serotypes in common, the percentage of subjects with antibody concentration > 
0.20μg/ml after the second dose was within the same range for both vaccines except for the 
Assessment report

serotypes 6B (higher for 10Pn 64% vs. 31% for Prevenar) and 18C (higher for Prevenar 98% vs.10 
Pn 87%). The corresponding percentage for serotype 23F was 75% for both vaccines. Antibody GMCs 
were similar in both groups, but with one serotype (6B) higher for 10Pn-PD-DiT and with 4 of 7 
serotypes (4, 9V, 14 and 18C) higher for Prevenar (Figure 2). 
For each of the serotypes common to both vaccines, the OPA GMTs and the percentages of subjects 
reaching OPA GMTs > 8 after the second dose were within the same range for both vaccines, with the 
exception of serotypes 6B, 19F and 23F for which the responses were higher with 10Pn-PD-DiT. The 
OPA GMTs against serotype 18C were similar for both vaccines with a higher OPA seropositivity rate in 
the Prevenar group (75% vs. 61%).

6B (87.3% or 88.6% in 2 out of the 4 groups). OPA titers > 8 were observed for at least 90.4% of 
each of the serotypes except serotypes 1 (50.3% to 54.3%), 5 (86.5% to 92.8%) and 6B (81.8% to 
87.8%).  
One month after the third vaccine dose, all subjects vaccinated with 10Pn-PD-DiT except one in the Pn-
HibC group had measurable concentrations of antibodies against protein D (> 100 ELU/ml).  
STUDY 10PN-PD-DIT-046 (Slovakia and Sweden) 
Design 
Experimental design: phase III, open, controlled, multi-centre, long-term follow-up study of study 002 
with three parallel groups: 
  10Pn-2d group: subjects previously vaccinated with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine according to a 
2+1 schedule, receiving one dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT. 
  10Pn-3d group: subjects previously vaccinated with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine according to a 
3+1 schedule, receiving one dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT. 
  Unprimed group: age-matched* subjects not previously vaccinated with any pneumococcal 
vaccine receiving two doses of 10Pn-PD-DiT. 
*Age-matching was ensured by the enrolment of subjects 36-46 months of age. In order to ensure the 
appropriate treatment allocation ratio, the investigator was instructed to enrol one subject in the 
unprimed group for each subject enrolled in the 10Pn-2d group. 
Each subject was being offered vaccination against hepatitis A and/or hepatitis B or against 
chickenpox. 
Blood samples  
For serology 
• before vaccination (Day 0) and 7-10 days following the Day 0 vaccination in all groups 
• one month after the second vaccination in the unprimed group 
For memory B-cell quantification (serotypes 6B, 18C, 19F and 23F), in all groups 
• before vaccination (Day 0) 
• 7-10 days following the Day 0 vaccination 
Study objectives 
Primary objectives:

002) of age in children previously vaccinated with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in study 002 
according to either a 3-dose or 2-dose primary vaccination within the first 6 months of age and 
booster vaccination at 11 months of age and to assess the immune responses following 
vaccination with a single dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT in age-matched unprimed children. 
Secondary objectives:

6 months of age and booster vaccination at 11 months of age 
Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria specific to study 046 
Inclusion: 
  Male or female between, and including, ± 36-46 months of age at the time of vaccination. 
 
For primed subjects: having completed the full vaccination course with the 10Pn-PD-DiT 
vaccine in study 002. 
Exclusion:

Study population 
The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity and on the ATP cohort 
for analysis of antibody persistence, according to the objective.  
The ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all 
eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no 
elimination criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures 
were available, i.e. the subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least 
one vaccine serotype or protein D after vaccination. 
The ATP cohort for analysis of antibody persistence, 2-3 years after study 002, comprised all subjects 
included in the ATP cohort for analysis of safety for whom assay results were available for at least one 
vaccine serotype or protein D before the administration of the additional dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT. 
Criteria for evaluation 
Immunogenicity: 
  Antibody concentrations against serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F (22F- 
ELISA), prior to, 7-10 days post-dose 1 and one month post-dose 2 (unprimed group only). 
  Opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 
19F and 23F, prior to, 7-10 days post-dose 1 and one month post-dose 2 (unprimed group 
only). 
  Antibody concentrations and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against cross-reactive 
pneumococcal serotypes 6A and 19A, prior to, 7-10 days post-dose 1and one month post-dose 
2 (unprimed group only). 
  Antibody concentrations against protein D (ELISA), prior to, 7-10 days post-dose 1and one 
month post-dose 2 (unprimed group only). 
 
 Quantification of memory B-cells that produce antibodies against vaccine pneumococcal 
serotypes 6B, 18C, 19F and 23F (ELISPOT assay), prior to, and 7-10 days post-dose 1.

Safety/Reactogenicity: 
  Occurrence of solicited local and general (any and grade 3) adverse event within 4 days after 
each vaccination. 
  Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events within 31 days after each vaccination. 
  Occurrence of serious adverse events after vaccination throughout the entire study period. 
Statistical methods 
Sample size 
The sample size of the 10Pn-2d and 10Pn-3d groups was contingent on the number of subjects who 
received a full vaccination course with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in study 002. Slovakian and Swedish 
study centres were to participate in the current study, and 142 subjects received a full vaccination 
course in these 2 countries (70 in the 10Pn-2d group and 72 in the 10Pn-3d group). Assuming that 
around 40% of these subjects would not enter the long-term follow-up study, it was considered that 
~85 subjects would receive an additional dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in the present study at 36 
to 46 months of age (~42 subjects in the 10Pn-2d group and 43 in the 10Pn-3d group). 
Considering that ~85 subjects would be enrolled in the primed groups and 42 subjects would be 
enrolled in the unprimed group of the current study and considering that up to 10% of the subjects 
may be excluded from the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity, there would be ~115 evaluable 
subjects in the current study (~38 subjects in the 10Pn-2d primed group, 39 subjects in the 10Pn-3d 
primed group and 38 subjects in the unprimed group). 
Statistical analyses 
Demography: descriptive analyses were performed. 
Immunogenicity: descriptive and exploratory inferential analyses were performed: 
  Geometric mean antibody concentrations/Geometric mean titres (GMCs/GMTs) and 
seropositivity rates, were calculated with their 95% CI at each applicable blood sampling time 
point, for each group, for each serotype (vaccine and cross-reactive) and for protein D. 
 
The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres was displayed using reverse cumulative 
distribution curves. 
  Descriptive analyses on B-cell memory quantification was performed for each group, at Day 0 
and at Day 7-10 post vaccination, and was expressed as frequency of polysaccharide specific 
memory B-cells. 
 
The geometric mean of the ratio’s (GMR) of OPA titres/ELISA antibody concentrations with the 
95% CIs, was tabulated at each applicable blood sampling time point, for each group, for each 
pneumococcal serotype (vaccine and cross-reactive). 
Safety and reactogenicity: descriptive analyses were performed (see safety section). 
RESULTS 
Subject accounting 
A total 172 subjects were enrolled, 110 subjects in the primed groups and 62 children in the unprimed 
group (Table 3). Of the 171 subjects who completed the study, one subject from the 3+1 group 
withdrew from the study due to the parents’ withdrawal of consent at visit 1.

Among the 241 subjects from study 10PN-PD-DIT-002 who did not participate in this long term follow-
up study (124 in the 10Pn-2d group and 117 in the 10Pn-3d group), 208 belonged to centres not 
willing to participate to the current study, 2 were not eligible, 9 were lost to follow-up and 22 subjects 
did not want to participate. 
Demographic characteristics 
The mean age at the time of vaccination was 38.8 months (SD + 2.35 months) and ranged from 36 to 
45 months. Between 49.7% and 53.3% of the subjects were males and 95% and 100% of the subjects

Antibody persistence prior to challenge vaccine dose in the 4th year of life  
ELISA: Persistence of the immune response to the vaccine antigens 24-34 months after completion of 
the 2-dose or 3-dose primary vaccination course was observed, with at least 60% of subjects had 
antibody concentrations  0.20 g/ml, except for serotypes 1, 4 and 9V (24.5%-52.9%) in the 2+1 
group and for serotypes 1 and 4 in the 3+1 group (39.3%-50.8%). Overall, the percentage of 
subjects with antibody concentrations >0.20 µg/ml were higher in the 3+1 group. At least 96.0% of 
subjects in the 2+1 group had measurable antibody concentrations ( 0.05 g/ml), except for  
serotypes 1 (86.0%), 4 (83.7%), 6B (89.8%) and 23F (88.0%) in the 2+1 group and was at least 
96.6% in the 3+1 group for each vaccine serotype.

Higher antibody GMCs was observed in the 3+1 group as compared with the 2+1 group for all 
serotypes, except for 19F.  
OPA: The percentage of subjects in the 2+1 group with an OPA titre >8 24-34 months after 
vaccination in study 002 was at least 95.2% for serotypes 7F, 9V and 14, at least 66.7% for serotypes 
19F and 23F and ranged from 12.5% to 48.8% for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B and 18C in the 2+1 group. In 
the 3+1 group, the corresponding percentages were at least 98.1% for serotypes 7F, 9V and 14, at 
least 67.3% for serotypes 6B, 19F and 23F and ranged from 21.4% to 38.2% for serotypes 1, 4, 5 and 
18C. At the pre-booster time point, a decline in OPA GMTs was observed for all vaccine serotypes, 
especially for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B and 18C in the primary 2-dose group and for serotypes 1, 4, 5 and 
18C in the primary 3-dose group.  
Higher OPA GMTs was observed in the 3+1 group compared to the 2+1 group for all serotypes except 
for serotype 4, 7F, 9V and 23F. 
Although there was a trend towards lower antibody levels and functional immune responses for most 
serotypes at this time point in the 2+1 primed children compared to 3+1 primed children, waning of 
immunity occurred at similar pace for both groups.  
Serotype 6A and 19A: A decline of ELISA GMCs was observed in both groups 24-34 months after 
vaccination. The percentages of subjects with ELISA concentrations > 0.20 μg/ml were 46.9% (6A) 
and 54.0% (19A) in the 2+1 group and 68.4% (6A) and 50.8% (19A) in the 3+1 group. At least 
86.4% remained seropositive > 0.05 μg /ml for each serotype and with both schedules. The 
percentage of children with OPA titers > 8 in the 2+1 group was 58.5% (6A) and 28.3% (19A) and in 
the 3+1 group was 64.6% (6A) and 25.0% (19A)   . The OPA GMTs for serotype 6A were somewhat 
lower in the 2-dose group. As regards 19A, GMTs were similarly low in both groups. 
Anti-PD: The percentage of subjects with anti-PD concentrations >100 EL.U/ml observed 24-34 
months after booster vaccination was 82.4% in the 2+1 group and 96.6% in the 3+1 group. The GMCs 
were higher in the 3+1 group.  
Before additional vaccination, for each of the vaccine serotypes, the observed percentages of 
seropositive subjects and ELISA GMCs in the primed groups were higher than in the age-matched 
unprimed group prior to catch-up vaccination. This observation was less pronounced for OPA titres but 
also for some of the serotypes, the observed percentages of subjects with OPA titre >8 and/or OPA 
GMTs were higher in the primed groups prior to additional vaccination than those in the age-matched 
unprimed group prior to catch-up vaccination. 
 Evaluation of immunological memory following challenge vaccine dose in the 4th year of 
life 
ELISA: The percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations > 0.20 μg/ml, 7-10 days after the 
challenge dose was comparable in both schedule groups (at least 98.0% in the 2+1 group and 100% 
in the 3+1 group) (Table 5). In the unprimed group, the percentage of children with antibody 
concentration > 0.20 μg/ml were lower and ranged from 26.7% to 100%, depending on the serotype.

Marked increases in ELISA GMCs were observed after the challenge dose compared to pre-vaccination 
time point. The fold increase in ELISA GMCs pre to post vaccination was similar after 2-dose and 3-
dose vaccination. The ELISA GMCs of subjects vaccinated with a 2+1 or 3+1 schedule were higher 
than unprimed subjects for all vaccination serotypes demonstrating the induction of immune memory.

The percentage of subjects with OPA titre > 8, 7 to 10 days after the challenge dose  in the primed 
groups was 100% for each serotype except for serotypes 6B (94.4% in the 3+1 group and 95.7% in 
the 2+1 group) and 19F (97.9% in the 2+1 group) (Table 7). 
In the unprimed group, 7-10 days after the first vaccination, the observed percentage of subjects with 
an OPA titre > 8, was at least 94.7% for each serotype, except for serotype 6B (77.8%) and serotype 
19F (89.5%). 
Marked increases of OPA GMTs were seen after the challenge dose compared to pre-vaccination time 
point were higher than unprimed subjects for all vaccination serotypes demonstrating the induction of 
immune memory. The fold increase in OPA GMTs was similar in both vaccination schedules.  
Serotypes 6A and 19A: For the cross-reactive serotypes 6A and 19A, a robust anamnestic response 
indicative of immune memory was also demonstrated for both schedules. The percentage of subjects 
with antibody concentrations > 0.20 μg/ml, 7-10 days after the challenge dose was 88.0% (6A) and 
94% (19A) in the 2+1 group and 92.7% (6A) and 98.2% (19A) in the 3+1 group. Higher ELISA GMCs 
against serotype 6A were observed in both 2+1 and 3+1 groups compared to the unprimed group (4-
fold vs.1.4 fold increase). Similarly for serotype 19A, higher GMCs were observed in the 2-dose and 
the 3-dose primed subjects (14-fold and 19-fold increase, respectively) compared to unprimed 
subjects (2.5-fold increase).  
The percentage of subjects with OPA titres >8 7-10 days after the challenge dose was 97.8% (6A) and 
85.4% (19A) in the 2+1 group and 96% (6A) and 92.7% (19A) in the 3+1 group (Table 8). The 
corresponding percentages in the unprimed group were 86.5% and 81.8 % 7 days after the first dose. 
OPA GMTs against serotypes 6A and 19A were significantly higher than those in the unprimed children.

Immune responses following 2-dose catch-up vaccination with the pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine during the 4th year of life (unprimed group) 
Robust increases in ELISA antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were observed one month after the second 
dose of vaccine as compared to the pre-vaccination status. All subjects had vaccine pneumococcal 
antibody concentrations > 0.20 µg/ml for each vaccine serotype except for serotypes 6B and 23F 
(93.3%). 
One month after the second dose of vaccine, all subjects had an OPA titre >8 for each vaccine 
serotype except for serotypes 1 (89.3%), 5 (98.2%) and 6B (93.0%). 
One month after the second dose of vaccine, the observed percentage of subjects with measurable 
anti-PD antibody concentrations (>100 EL.U/ml) was 98.3% and the anti-PD GMC was 960.4 EL.U/ml. 
Like PCV7 and PCV13, Synflorix was initially registered with a 3+1 schedule for all children aged 6 
weeks to 6 months, regardless of the presence of underlying medical conditions such as HIV infection, 
sickle cell disease, asplenia or chronic disease. There is currently no data in the literature to conclude 
that PCV effectiveness will be inferior in such high risk populations vaccinated with the 2+1 schedule 
as compared to the 3+1 schedule. Only limited data have demonstrated that 3-dose primary series 
induced an acceptable immune response in infants with sickle cell disease vaccinated with PCV7 
(Reinert et al PIDJ, 2007). HIV-infected children benefiting from a substantial immune response 
boostability and anamnestic response after a 3-dose primary course of PCV9 showed substantial 
protection against IPD (Madhi et al JID, 2009). In addition, the MAH has recently submitted data 
demonstrating that Synflorix elicits generally robust immune responses in preterm infants after 3+1 
schedule when compared to full term infants. Based on these data, the Company has proposed the 
inclusion for a recommendation of the 3+1 schedule in preterm infants to ensure maximal individual 
protection, in a separate ongoing type II variation (EMEA/H/C/973/II/16). The currently available data 
in study 046 show strong immune priming, similar following both 2+1 and 3+1 schedules, and 
boostability even years after the primary series, supporting the use of the 2+1 schedule in the context 
of universal mass vaccination. Therefore, in the context of universal mass vaccination programmes, in 
which herd immunity may also play a role in protecting individuals who are not vaccinated or those 
with a lower immune response, the Company believes the data to date support the use of the 2+1 
schedule with the decision to vaccinate high-risk groups left at the discretion of the national health 
authorities. 
There are also some important practical considerations in favour of making no distinction between high 
risk and other populations on this issue. Some countries recommend the use of the 2+1 vaccination 
schedule in children regardless of whether they are high-risk group or not. For instance, high-risk 
groups in the UK should be given PCV according to the schedule for the routine immunisation

programme at 2, 4 and 13 months of age (Green Book, 2010). In South Africa, in order for HIV-
infected children to derive the most benefit from a 3-dose schedule and to fit with the current EPI, the 
third dose is given at 9 months of age following a 6 and 14 weeks primary vaccination course (Baker L, 
2010). More national authorities are considering to include high-risk groups in their routine 
immunization programmes using the 3-dose schedule as it is already the current practice in the UK and 
South Africa. In addition, it seems likely that GAVI countries introducing PCV vaccines will largely do so 
using a 2+1 schedule, without separate specific immunization recommendations for the high risk 
groups. In the setting of universal mass vaccination (UMV), the herd protection related to the PCV 
vaccination coverage starts to play role regardless the schedule applied in the country, so it may have 
additional protective effect for children who are not vaccinated or immunocompromised for any reason. 
This may provide reassurance that proper protection is provided to all children in UMV settings. 
III.3.3 Clinical safety 
Overview of safety 
Safety data on 10Pn-PD-DiT administered according to a 2+1 schedule are derived from studies 002 
and 046. The analyses of reactogenicity and safety were not performed in the post-hoc head-to-head 
analysis in study 011. 
Study 002 
No clinically relevant differences in the solicited reactogenicity profile were observed between the two 
vaccination schedules. During the primary vaccination course 27.8% of the doses in the 2-dose and 
35,7% of the doses in the 3-dose priming group were followed by at least one unsolicited adverse 
event (AE). The corresponding frequencies following booster doses were 36.2% and 41%, respectively. 
A total of 15 subjects: 7 in the 2-dose priming group and 8 in the 3-dose priming group reported non-
fatal serious adverse events (SAEs). In all 2 subjects, one in each group, were considered to be 
causally related to vaccination (i.e. lower respiratory infection and fever convulsions). All SAEs 
resolved without sequelae. 
Study 011 
The analyses of reactogenicity and safety were not performed in the post hoc analysis in study 011. 
From evaluation of safety and reactogenicity following 3-dose priming in the study 011 in the initial 
registration file of 10Pn-PD-DiT can be summarized: 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that the 10Pn-PD vaccine when administered 
as a 3-dose primary vaccination course is non-inferior to Prevenar, both co-administered with DTPa-
HBV-IPV and Hib-MenC vaccines, in terms of post–immunisation febrile reactions with temperature > 
39.0ºC (measured rectally). 
A second objective was to assess the safety and reactogenicity of 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when co-
administered with DTPa-combined and MenC or Hib-MenC vaccines. 
Solicited and unsolicited adverse events 
The overall/dose incidence of AEs (solicited and unsolicited) reported during the 31-day post 
vaccination period ranged between 82.9% (Pr-HibC group) and 86.0% (Pn-Men group).The most 
frequently reported solicited local and general AEs were redness and irritability in all four groups. A low 
overall/dose incidence of grade 3 solicited local and general AEs was observed, which did not exceed 
3.1% and 4.6%, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/795221/2011  
Page 19/33
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Five cases of grade 3 fever (> 40ºC) were reported (2 in the Pn-Neis group, 1 in the PnHibC group and 
2 in the Pr-HibC group) Antipyretic medication was administered within 4 days of vaccination following 
14.0% to 19.2% of the vaccines across the 4 groups. 
No fatal events were reported 
Safety conclusions 
The primary objective of the study was met because the upper limit of the 95%CI for the difference 
(PnHibC minus PrHibC) in terms of percentage of subjects with rectal temperature >39ºC after at least 
one vaccination dose was 3.32% and therefore below the pre-defined limit of 10%. 
The incidence of reported AEs and SAEs in the groups where 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine was co-administered 
with DTPa-combined and MenC or Hib-MenC vaccines did not show any significant difference. 
Study 046  
One challenge dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT was given to all subjects at approximately 36-42 months of age. 
This was the 4th dose to subjects primed with a 2+1 schedule and the 5th dose to subjects primed with 
a 3+1 schedule. In the unprimed group two 10Pn doses were administered during the 4th year of life. 
The analysis of safety was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort (Table 10).

MAH´s safety conclusions 
Primed groups: 
  After vaccination with additional dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT (4th or 5th dose respectively) in the 
fourth year of life, 92.2% of subjects in the 10Pn-2d group and 89.8% of subjects in the 10Pn-
3d group reported at least one AE (solicited or unsolicited, local or general). 
 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE was pain in both primed groups and the most 
frequently reported solicited general adverse events were irritability and drowsiness in the 
10Pn-2d group and irritability in the 10Pn-3d group. 
Large swelling reactions were reported by 1 subject in the 10Pn-3d group. 
 
  No cases of grade 3 fever (rectal temperature >40oC) were reported in any of the primed 
groups. 
 
The observed percentage of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited AE within 31 days after 
additional vaccination was 47.1% in the 10Pn-2d group and 40.7% in the 10Pn-3d group. Up 
to 5.1% of the primed subjects reported at least one unsolicited AE with grade 3 intensity. 
Unsolicited AEs considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination were 
reported by 5.9% and 8.5% of the subjects in the 10Pn-2d and the 10Pn-3d group 
respectively. 
Unprimed group: 
  Overall 85.5% of documented doses were followed by at least one adverse event. 
 
Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local AE was and irritability was the most 
frequently reported solicited general adverse event. 
Large swelling reactions were reported by 1subject. 
 
  None of the subjects reported fever >40oC or any other grade 3 solicited general AEs 
 
The observed percentage of administered doses followed by at least one unsolicited adverse 
event within 31 days after vaccination was 40.3%. 
Three subjects (one in each treatment group) reported each one SAE during the course of the study. 
None of these was considered to be causally related to vaccination and all subjects recovered 
uneventfully.

Efficacy / Immunogenicity discussion 
In study 002, it was demonstrated that the 2+1 schedule results in lower immune responses than the 
3+1 schedule. The real problematic serotypes include serotypes  6B  and  23F  with low post-primary 
GMCs in both schedules, but in particular in the 2-dose schedule with only 56% and 69% of subjects 
having  ELISA  GMCs  above  the  0.20  µg/ml  threshold.  These  findings  are  consistent  with  studies 
conducted  with  Prevenar,  which  also  showed  a  reduced  immune  response,  in  particular  for  serotypes 
6B and 23F, with the 2+1 schedule compared with the 3+1 schedule.  
Post-booster,  the  significant  differences  between  the  two  dose  regimens  remained  for  serotype  6B 
with  lower  ELISA  GMCs  and  OPA  GMTs,  88.5%  (vs.  96.6%  (3-dose))  of  subjects  achieving  GMCs 
>0.2µg/ml and 81% (vs. 90.3% (3-dose)) of subjects achieving OPA GMTs >8 in the 2-dose schedule. 
For  serotype  1  only  ~80%  of  subjects  had  OPA  GMT  >1:8  in  both  schedules,  whereas  there  was  a 
difference  seen  for  serotype  5  (87%  (2-dose)  vs.  97.5%  (3-dose)).  Overall  the  post-boost  ELISA 
GMCs  and  OPA  GMTs  were  lower  with  the  2+1  schedule  vs.  the  3+1  schedule,  except  for  some 
serotypes  that  were  in  the  same  range.  Thus,  the  differences  between  schedules  remained  after  the 
booster  dose  for  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine.  The  immune  responses  after  the  booster  dose  were 
comparable for all serotypes following a two- or three-dose series. 
In  study  011  a  direct  comparison  of  post-dose  2  responses  between  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  and  Prevenar 
was  made  (post-hoc  analysis).  The  results  were  somewhat  surprising  showing  that  the  immune 
responses  were  not  that  different  for  the  two  vaccines  and  the  functional  immune  response  were 
higher for three serotypes in the 10Pn group namely 6B, 19F and 18C. However, the low serotype 6B 
GMCs seen in the Prevenar groups of the GSK trials differ from published data which might be due to 
technical  particularities  with  the  GSK  22F-ELISA.  Overall,  antibody  GMCs  for  4  serotypes  (4,  9V,  14 
and 18C) were higher in the Prevenar group, GMCs for 6B were higher in the 10Pn group and GMCs for 
types 19F and 23F were in the same range for both vaccines. As regards OPA, GMTs were higher for 
serotypes 6B, 19F and 23F in the 10Pn group, but for other types in the same range. The OPA GMTs in 
study 011 were overall lower than those seen in study 002 (except for serotypes 7F and 23F). 
Recent licensure of Prevenar 13 in December 2009 has as yet not allowed the MAH to perform a head 
to  head  comparison  between  10Pn-PD-DiT  and  Prevenar  13.  However,  the  MAH  reviewed  published 
comparative  data  on  Prevenar  7  and  Prevenar  13  used  in  a  3-dose  priming  schedule  (2-4-6  months, 
Spain) (Diez-Domingo et al, 2009) and in a 2-dose-priming schedule (2-4-12 months, UK) (Paradiso et 
al  2010)  and  noted  some  similarities  with  the  comparative  data  on  Prevenar  and  the  10Pn-PD-DiT 
vaccine.  In  the  Spanish  trial  it  was  shown  that  the  immune  responses  after  two  primary  doses  of 
Prevenar  13  were  similar  to  those  after  two  doses  of  Prevenar  7  in  terms  of  the  number  of  subjects 
with ELISA antibody concentration 0.35 µg/ml, although the GMCs for all common serotypes following 
two doses of Prevenar 13 were lower than observed for Prevenar 7. In the second head to head study 
in the UK with a 2+1 schedule it was found that the OPA GMTs were higher for serotype 6B in those 
who received two doses of Prevenar 13 in comparison with Prevenar 7. For other serotypes OPA GMTs 
were either lower or similar to GMTs following two doses of Prevenar.

STUDY 10PN-PD-DIT-046 (Slovakia and Sweden)  
Antibody persistence:  
Persistence  of  ELISA  antibody  response  above  the  threshold  level  >0.20ug/ml  prior  to  administration 
of  the  challenge  dose  at  36-46  months  of  age  varied  widely  by  serotype.  For  both  schedules  low 
proportions of subjects remained at the antibody threshold level for serotypes  1  and  4 (and 9V for 
the 2+1 dose group) ranging from 25% to 54% in the 2+1 group and 37% to 49% in the 3+1 group, 
whereas for the other serotypes this figure was at least 60%. Overall, the percentage of subjects with 
antibody  concentrations  >0.20  µg/ml  and  ELISA  GMCs  were  higher  for  each  of  the  serotypes  in  the 
3+1 group. In comparison, the unprimed group had very low baseline ELISA antibody concentrations, 
except  for  serotypes  14  and  19F.  For  6B  it  is  noted  that  32%  of  unprimed  subjects  had  antibody 
concentrations >0.2 µg/ml. 
Similarly, with respect to the more important functional immune responses, the percentage of subjects 
with  OPA  titres  >8  were  always  higher  in  the  3+1  group  (except  for  23F).  Also  the  OPA  GMTs  were 
higher  in  the  3+1  group,  except  for  serotype  4,  7F,  9V  and  23F  where  the  GMTs  were  in  the  same 
range. Remarkably low OPA titres were observed for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 18C and 19F in both schedule 
groups. The same pattern was observed in the unprimed group.  
As  regards  the  `problematic´  serotypes  6B  and  23F  noted  during  the  primary/booster  series,  the 
differences in immune response by schedule was no longer apparent for serotype 23F. In contrast for 
serotype  6B,  differences  remained,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  antibody  concentrations  >0.20 
µg/ml  was  60.4%  (2+1  group)  and  77.2%  (3+1  group)  and  that  with  OPA  titres  >8  was  47.6%  and 
66.7%, respectively. 
The  persistence  data  must  be  assessed  together  with  the  robust  anamnestic  responses  as 
demonstrated  for  all  serotypes  after  a  challenge  dose  of  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  given  24-34  months 
after completion of the 2-dose or 3-dose primary vaccination series.  
Post-challenge vaccine dose in the 4th year of life: 
Seven  to  10  days  following  the  challenge  dose,  brisk  anamnestic  ELISA  and  OPA  responses  were 
observed  for  all  serotypes,  including  6B  and  23F,  regardless  of  primary  vaccination  schedule  used. 
However, ELISA GMCs were again nominally higher in the 3+1 group than those in the 2+1 group, but 
the  clinical  relevance  of  these  differences  could  be  questioned  taking  the  more  important  functional 
immune  response  into  consideration.  The  OPA  GMTs  and  proportion  of  subjects  with  OPA  titres  >8 
were in the same range in both primed groups, except  for  19F (higher GMTs in the 3+1 group 5684 
vs. 2231 in the 2+1 group). For serotypes 6B and 23F the OPA GMTs were even somewhat higher in 
the 2+1 group. 
Compared with the unprimed group, the proportion of subjects with ELISA concentrations >0.20µg/ml 
and  OPA  titres  >8  was  higher  for  the  majority  of  serotypes  in  the  primed  groups,  although  100%  of 
unprimed  subjects  also  achieved  the  OPA  threshold  for  6  of  the  10  serotypes.  However,  as  regards 
ELISA  GMCs  and  OPA  GMTs  substantially  higher  antibody  levels  were  always  reached  in  the  primed 
groups.  These  data  indicate  a  similar  induction  of  immunological  memory  after  primary  vaccination 
according  to  a  2+1  or  3+1  schedule.  The  data  suggest  that  comparable  long-term  protection  can  be 
obtained  with  both  vaccination  schedules.  Considering  the  lower  post-primary  and  post-booster 
immune  responses  noted  with  the  2+1  schedule,  the  MAH  proposed,  that  this  alternative  schedule 
should  only  be  used  as  part  of  the  routine  infant  immunisation  program,  since  the  benefit  of  herd 
protection can be taken advantage of it.

Surveillance data are available from Quebec where a PCV 7 infant immunisation program using a 2+1 
schedule  was  implemented  in  2004.  The  experience  in  Quebec  showed  that  PCV7  in  a  2+1  schedule 
was highly efficacious against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) due to vaccine serotypes (VST) in 
children <5 years (VE: 97%). A case control study, where IPD cases were reported in children aged 2-
59 months during the years 2005-2007, showed a VE of 60% against overall IPD and 92% against VST 
IPD. Of note is that an increase in the incidence of IPD in children < 5 years of age has been reported 
in Quebec since 2006. The increase is due to serotypes not included in PCV7, including serotypes 19A 
and 7F. 
In June 2009 Synflorix replaced PCV7 in the infant immunisation program in Quebec and the first post-
marketing data were provided in the MAH´s response. An ecological comparative analysis of impact of 
PCV7  and  Synflorix  on  IPD  was  performed.  IPD  data  was  collected  up  to  June  2010.  Post-booster 
impact of vaccination was not evaluated. 
During  the  surveillance  period,  a  total  of  21  cases  of  IPD  were  recorded  in  the  PCV7  cohort  (2  VST 
cases of 19F) and 8 cases in the Synflorix cohort (2 VST cases of 7F). 
Based on the distribution of cases of IPD and the length of follow up for the two cohorts, the incidence 
rate of IPD cases in infants of 6 to 11 months of age was calculated. In this age group, only two IPD 
cases (non-vaccine serotypes (NVST)  23B and  15A) were reported in the Synflorix cohort yielding an 
incidence rate of 18.1 cases/100 000 child-years of follow-up. In the PCV7 cohort, although there were 
no  VST  IPD  cases  reported,  the  overall  incidence  rate  was  higher  (59.4  cases/100  000  child-years  of 
follow-up). 
In  children  0-6  months  of  age,  who  had  not  completed  the  primary  vaccination  course,  a  similar 
number  of  IPD  cases  was  reported  in  the  PCV7  and  Synflorix  cohort  (8  vs.  6),  with  predominantly 
NVST.    Regarding  VST  cases,  there  were  two  cases  of  7F  IPD  in  the  Synflorix  cohort  (one  in  a  1-
month-old child and one in a 3-month-old) and two cases of 19F IPD in the PCV7 cohort (one in a less 
than 1-month old child and one in a 2-month old).  
These preliminary short-term data showed that following the 2-dose primary series of Synflorix, no IPD 
cases  due  to  vaccine  serotypes  were  reported.  However,  these  results  were  obtained  in  an 
epidemiological  situation  where  the  circulation  of  the  PCV7  serotypes  has  been  substantially  reduced 
by the direct and indirect effects of an universal mass immunisation (UMV) program with a high PCV7 
vaccine  uptake.  Although  there  was  evidence  of  19F  and  7F  circulation,  no  data  were  given  for  the 
other  two  additional  serotypes  in  Synflorix  (serotypes  1  and  5).  It  would  have  been  reassuring  if  the 
data  on  Synflorix  had  suggested  protection  against  serotypes  1  and  5  for  which  the  vaccine-induced 
OPA  responses  are  the  lowest.  Of  note  is  that  there  were  no  cases  of  19A  IPD  reported  in  Synflorix 
primed infants vs. 7 cases in PCV7 primed children. This finding requires monitoring during a longer-
term  period  and  post-booster  data  to  conclude  that  Synflorix  would  exert  cross-protection  against 
serotype 19A. 
Apart from the herd effect, other confounding factors of the study were discussed by the MAH, such as 
the truncated follow-up for the Synflorix cohort, incomplete recording of vaccination status and lack of 
case data on clinical severity as well as the influence of external factors such as the concurrent A/H1N1 
epidemic.  
In conclusion a preliminary post-marketing analysis of the impact of Synflorix vs. PCV7 in the context 
of 2+1 used in a routine immunization in Quebec was reported. The post-dose 2 data in the Synflorix 
Assessment report

cohort  showed  promising  results,  which,  however,  must  be  confirmed  by  data  from  longer-term 
surveillance and from the ongoing RCT studies in Finland. Currently no effectiveness data on the 2+1 
schedule are currently available from the still blinded Finnish studies. 
Upon request the MAH´s provided a useful review upon which it can be concluded that the importance 
of  maintaining  antibody  levels  above  a  specific  threshold  to  uphold  protection  against  VST  IPD,  for 
example, at a pre-booster time point is not known. The relationship between persistence of functional 
OPA responses and protection is even less well understood. The establishment of an immune memory 
and  maintenance  of  boostability  appears  to  be  very  important  for  short  and  longer-term  protection 
against invasive pneumococcal diseases. The data from several countries applying the 2+1 schedule in 
UVM support the effectiveness of PCV vaccines.  
As regards mucosal disease (AOM and pneumonia) even less is known about the relationship between 
antibody levels and protection. The current data provide no clear answer. 
There  are  no  data  on  Synflorix  with  respect  to  vaccine  safety  or  immunogenicity  in  infants/children 
with  increased  risk  for  pneumococcal  infection.  Only  limited  immunogenicity  data  are  available  on 
children  with  sickle  cell  disease  following  a  3-dose  primary  series  with  PCV7,  which  showed  an 
acceptable  immune  response.  In  the  study  by  Madhi  et  al  concerning  PCV7  vaccination  of  older  HIV 
infected children (> 5 years), it was concluded that “HIV-infected vaccinees experience a partial loss of 
anamnestic responses to PCV. The optimal timing and frequency of booster vaccination as well as the 
responses  to  them  among  HIV-infected  children  need  to  be  determined”.  Regrettably,  there  are 
currently no data from studies evaluating PCV efficacy/effectiveness in high risk children. 
In  the  setting  of  national  immunisation  programs  with  high  vaccine  uptake,  herd  protection  would 
confer  additional  benefit  to  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  subjects/high-risk  groups  regardless  of 
vaccination  schedule  applied.  It  is  evident  from  the  updated  Health  Protection  Agency  (HPA) 
surveillance  report  (2009/2010)  of  the  impact  of  PCV  7  vaccination  program  in  the  UK  employing  a 
2+1  schedule  that  vaccine  effectiveness  did  not  differ  by  high-risk  groups  or  by  prematurity.  The  VE 
estimate was similar to the overall estimate of 83% in the total vaccinated infant cohort. However, in 
individual  cases  the  3+1  schedule  with  Synflorix  should  be  recommended  to  all  children  (and  in 
particular the high-risk children) aged 6 week to 6 months to ensure optimal protection.  
The  MAH  agreed  to  perform  epidemiological  surveillance  for  the  identification  and  monitoring  of  IPD 
and AOM in a country routinely using Synflorix in a 2+1 schedule. 
Safety discussion 
In study 046 no increase of fever reaction in relation to vaccination in the 4th year of life was observed, 
however  all  fever  reactions  after  booster  vaccination  should  be  closely  monitored  and  cumulatively 
reported  on  in  future  PSURs.  The  Company  has  previously  made  a  commitment  to  monitor  febrile 
reactions including febrile convulsions. 
The main conclusions on safety of 10Pn-PD-DiT administered according to a 2+1 schedule derive from 
studies  002  and  046.  Data  from  the  analysis  of  the  reactogenicity  and  safety  of  the  head  to  head 
comparative  study  011  in  the  initial  registration  file  for10Pn-PD-DiT  do  not  differ  from  data  in  the 
analysis of the primary vaccination study 002 with the follow-up study 046. The safety profile for 10Pn-
PD-DiT in the study of primary vaccination and the follow-up study of the challenge dose in the 4th year 
of life showed no significant differences in local or systemic adverse reactions. There were no grade 3 
Assessment report

fever reactions reported after the challenge dose of vaccine in study 046. No new or significant safety 
issues were observed in any of these trials. 
In conclusion, an additional dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine (4th or 5th dose) administered at 36-46 
months of age in children previously vaccinated with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine according to a 2-dose or 
a 3-dose primary vaccination within the first 6 months of age and booster vaccination at 11 months of 
age, was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated. 
2.  Conclusion and Benefit-risk assessment 
Data from three clinical trials were submitted in this type II variation to support the use of a 2-dose 
primary course followed by a booster dose in the context of routine infant immunization programme. 
Two of the studies 10PN-PD-DIT-002 and 10PN-PD-DIT-011 were assessed previously in the MAA 
procedure and resulted in a recommendation in the current SmPC posology section of Synflorix that 
the infant vaccination schedule consists of 4 vaccine doses, i.e. 3-dose primary course followed by a 
booster dose in the 2nd year of life (3+1 schedule). In section 5.1, data are provided supporting the 
wording in section 4.2, but in addition the immune response following a 2-dose primary vaccination 
(2+1 schedule) is compared to a 3-dose primary series in subjects less than 6 months of age with the 
conclusion that the 3+1 schedule is recommended to ensure optimal protection. The new study 10PN-
PD-DIT-046 submitted in this type II variation is the 2-3 years follow-up of study 002 and provides 
data on persistence of antibodies for 2-3 years after a booster dose at 11-12 months of age and 
immune responses following an additional challenge dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine to children at 36-
46 months of age (long-term immune response). 
In previous study 002, lower ELISA GMC values were noted for all serotypes after the 2-dose series 
than the 3-dose series. In particular, low antibody titres were observed for serotypes 6B and 23F 
and a significantly smaller proportion of children achieved an antibody concentration > 0.20 μg/ml for 
these serotypes. As regards the functional immune response, differences between dose groups were 
even more pronounced. In study 011, the immune responses measured after two vaccine doses in the 
post-hoc head to head comparison with Prevenar were overall comparable, with notably higher 
responses observed for serotype 6B with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine. Studies on IPD effectiveness of 
Prevenar when used in national infant vaccination programs suggest that the lower immune response 
observed with the 2+1 schedule have no major impact on vaccine effectiveness.  
The only new data in this submission were from the follow-up study of 002, 10PN-PD-DIT 046, and 
the effectiveness modelling. In study 046, it was shown that persistence of antibodies was 
demonstrated 24-34 months after the booster dose under both vaccination schedules, although with 
varying results depending on the serotype. Overall, the percentage of subjects with antibody 
concentrations above the ELISA and OPA antibody thresholds were higher for the majority of serotypes 
in the 3+1 group. The clinical consequences of the low persistence of functional immune response for 
the particular serotypes in both schedules are not known. It is likely that this is of more importance in 
premature children, certain high-risk groups and in those with an impaired immune response, such as 
HIV infected children. The acceptability of using the lower immunogenic 2+1 schedule in these risk 
groups can be questioned. The importance of maintaining an immune response at the serum antibody 
threshold level during the periods between vaccine doses to uphold protection against vaccine type IPD 
is not known. Even less is known what is required for the non-invasive mucosal infections which likely 
require higher antibody levels to afford protection against AOM and pneumonia. The open questions 
can only be answered by the large long-term effectiveness studies that the MAH has committed to 
Assessment report  
EMA/795221/2011  
Page 31/33
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
perform. According to the MAH, effectiveness data following a 2-dose primary schedule with the 10Pn-
PD-DiT vaccine are currently not available. In Finland study 10PN-PD-DIT-043 is still ongoing and 
effectiveness results are expected from this study. 
The challenge dose administered to children in the 4th year of life primed according to either a 2+1 or a 
3+1 vaccination schedule was well tolerated. This dose elicited a robust immune response which was 
higher than in unprimed subjects, which indicate an immunological memory in primed subjects. The 
OPA GMTs were in the same range in both primed groups, except for serotype 19F (higher in the 3+1 
group). As regards serotypes 6B and 23F the OPA GMTs were even somewhat higher in the 2+1 group. 
Overall the data indicate a similar induction of immunological memory after primary vaccination 
according to a 2+1 or 3+1 schedule. The demonstration of immunological memory is considered a key 
factor for long term protection.  
Modelling of the direct impact of vaccination schedule on protection against IPD suggested that the 2-
dose schedule is expected to provide less protection than the 3-dose schedule and effectiveness of a 2 
dose primary course appeared to be greater with 10Pn-PD-DiT than with Prevenar. However, it is not 
possible to draw conclusions on effectiveness based on these predictions. The lack of effectiveness 
data on 10Pn-PD-DiT is a major shortcoming, which cannot be replaced by this modelling. 
The MAH provided further data on certain issues pertaining to any available effectiveness data on 2+1 
schedule from on-going study 043 in Finland, the potential consequences of a reduced primary immune 
response in premature children and high-risk groups, the acceptability of using the 2+1 schedules in 
these risk populations and missing data on the quantification of antigen specific memory B cells. In 
addition the SPC required modifications. 
All the ´other concerns´ were satisfactorily resolved. It was clarified that there are no effectiveness 
data on the 2+1 schedule currently available from the still blinded Finnish studies. A preliminary post-
marketing analysis of the impact of Synflorix versus PCV7 in the context of 2+1 used in a routine 
immunization program in Quebec was reported. The post-dose 2 data in the Synflorix cohort showed 
promising results, which, however, must be confirmed by data from longer-term surveillance and from 
the ongoing RCT studies in Finland. As regards the consequences of the lower immune responses of 
the 2+1 schedule in high-risk groups, it can be agreed, that in the setting of national immunisation 
programs with high vaccine uptake, herd protection would confer additional benefit to vaccinated and 
unvaccinated subjects/high-risk groups regardless of vaccination schedule applied. Moreover, from the 
updated HPA surveillance report (2009/2010) of the impact of PCV 7 vaccination program in the UK 
employing a 2+1 schedule, it is evident that vaccine effectiveness did not differ by high-risk groups or 
by prematurity; the VE estimate was similar to the overall estimate of 83% in the total vaccinated 
infant cohort. However, on an individual basis the 3+1 schedule with Synflorix should be recommended 
to all children (and in particular the high-risk children) aged 6 week to 6 months to ensure optimal 
protection. The MAH proposed a new wording in section 4.4 of the SmPC, clearly stating that 
vaccination in high-risk groups should be considered on an individual basis with a cross-reference to 
section 4.2, which is considered satisfactory. The data on the quantification of antigen specific memory 
B cells were provided as requested. 
In overall conclusion, the results in study 046 are considered important suggesting that comparable 
long-term protection can be obtained with both vaccination schedules. Considering the lower immune 
responses noted during the primary vaccination course and after the booster dose with the 2+1 
schedule, the MAH proposed, that the this alternative schedule should only be used as part of the 
routine infant immunisation program, since the benefit of herd protection can be taken advantage of. 
In the opinion of the CHMP, the study results justify this use of Synflorix in the 2-dose primary

schedule. Moreover, the MAH has committed to submit the surveillance data of the effectiveness of the 
2+1 schedule in the routine infant immunisation program in Finland. The SmPC has been revised. 
Benefit-risk assessment 
The overall expected benefit of the 10Pn-PD-DiT in the 2+1 schedule may be somewhat lower than the 
3+1 schedule. However, the results in study 046 indicate a similar induction of immunological memory 
after primary vaccination according to a 2+1 or 3+1 schedule, which suggest comparable long-term 
protection with both schedules. In addition, using the 2+1 schedule in routine infant immunization 
programs means that herd protection will contribute to protective efficacy so that any potential 
differences between the 2- and 3- primary schedules will not appear. 
The clinical consequences of the lower post-primary and post-booster immune responses observed 
after the 2+1 vaccination schedule are unknown, but might be of importance in premature children, 
the established high-risk groups and children with an impaired antibody response to vaccines, such as 
HIV infected subjects. Recent data from the UK surveillance of the impact of PCV 7 suggest that the 
2+1 schedule results in comparable efficacy in high-risk groups as in healthy infants. However, to 
ensure optimal protection against pneumococcal disease, it seems prudent to recommend the 3+1 
schedule to these vulnerable risk groups. The SmPC has accordingly been amended with a statement 
in section 4.4 that vaccination in high-risk groups should be considered on an individual basis with a 
cross-reference to section 4.2. 
Effectiveness data following a 2 dose primary schedule with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine are currently not 
available. However, preliminary post-marketing data on the impact of Synflorix versus PCV7 in the 
context of 2+1 used in a routine immunization program in Quebec have become available. The post-
dose 2 effectiveness data in the Synflorix cohort showed promising results, which, however, should be 
confirmed by data from longer-term surveillance and from the ongoing RCT studies in Finland. 
The CHMP concluded that the benefit risk ratio for the applied variation is favourable provided that the 
proposed wording in the SmPC section 5.1 was modified as requested. 
On 16 December 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

Extension of indication to include treatment of patients with GvHD aged 12 years and older who have 
inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies for Jakavi; as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8. 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated 
in accordance. Version 13.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives for The 
Netherlands in the Package Leaflet.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
P/0172/2021 (EMEA-000901-PIP03-16-M02) and P/0384/2019 (EMEA-000901-PIP04-17-M01) on the 
agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the P/0172/2021 (EMEA-000901-PIP03-16-M02) and 
P/0384/2019 (EMEA-000901-PIP04-17-M01) were not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
24 March 2022 
Ruxolitinib (Jakavi®/Jakafi®, INC424, INCB018424 phosphate) is an oral selective inhibitor of the 
Janus kinases (JAKs) JAK1 and JAK2. Ruxolitinib (Jakavi®) is currently indicated in EU and more than 
100 countries for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with 
PMF, PPV-MF or PET-MF and for the treatment of adult patients with polycythemia vera who are 
resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea.  
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 8/177 
 
 
 
The target indication subject to this Type II variation, is to extend the indications for ruxolitinib, as 
follows: 
• 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of patients with GvHD aged 12 years and older who have 
inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a well-established procedure for the 
treatment of malignant and non-malignant hematological diseases (Copelan 2006). However, despite 
the curative potential of alloSCT, graft versus host disease (GvHD) is a major barrier to the efficacious 
outcome. 
GvHD is an immunologically mediated, multi-organ disorder that occurs when donor-derived immune 
cells recognize the transplant recipient cells, organs and tissues as non-self, thereby initiating an 
adverse immune reaction leading to tissue damage, organ failure, or even death (Jagasia et al 2018, 
Greinix et al 2011, Ferrara et al 2009). GvHD It is the major cause of transplant-related morbidity and 
mortality, affecting up to 70% of HSCT recipients and accounting for 21-31% of deaths post-alloSCT 
among patients who received human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling and 31-40% of deaths 
in patients receiving unrelated donor transplants (D’Souza and Fretham 2019, Jagasia et al 2018, Hill 
et al 2018, Zeiser and Blazar 2017, Pavletic and Fowler 2012). 
GvHD is categorized into two main clinical forms namely acute GvHD (aGvHD) and chronic GvHD 
(cGvHD); although patients may also have disease characteristics of both, acute and chronic GvHD. 
Overlap syndrome, although infrequent, may occur with the presence of one or more features of 
aGvHD in patients with diagnosis of cGvHD or may develop clinical features of aGvHD after diagnosis 
of cGvHD (Jagasia et al 2015). 
Acute GvHD 
Acute GvHD is mainly characterized by mature donor T cell-mediated inflammatory disease (Hill et al 
2018, Zhang et al 2006). It usually presents early after engraftment, with a median time to onset 
(grade II-IV) of 20-25 days (Axt et al 2019, Flowers et al 2011). The clinical manifestations are seen 
primarily in three organs: the skin (maculopapular erythematous skin rash, erythroderma), the liver 
(cholestasis, hyperbilirubinemia, and/or jaundice), and the lower and upper gastrointestinal tract 
(nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, anorexia with weight loss, secretory diarrhea, GI bleeding and/or 
ileus) (Schoemans et al 2018, Harris et al 2016, Dignan et al 2012, Jacobsohn and Vogelsang 2007). 
The overall severity of aGvHD is graded from I (mild) to IV (life-threatening) according to the degree 
of involvement of the individual organs (Schoemans et al 2018). The diagnosis and clinical staging are 
assessed using a comprehensive and systematic approach for the determination of GvHD onset, 
confidence in the attribution of symptoms to aGvHD, and quantification of clinical severity of aGvHD in 
each target organ (The MAGIC criteria, Harris et al 2016). The extent of individual organ staging and 
overall grade of aGvHD is an important prognostic factor.  
Among all patients who had alloSCT, the occurrence of aGvHD ranges from 30% to 50%, with 14% to 
36% developing severe (grade III to IV) aGvHD (Malard et al 2020, Zeiser and Blazer 2017). The 
incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD in pediatric patients (2-12 years old) is lower than in adults, but 
adolescent patients (13-17 years old) can present higher rates, closer to that seen in adults (Gatza et 
al 2020, Qayed et al 2018).  
The occurrence and severity of aGvHD depends on various factors including donor type (i.e., matched 
or unmatched, related or unrelated), older patient/donor age, gender disparity, multiparous female 
Assessment report

donors, intensity of transplant conditioning regimen, and absence of or suboptimal GvHD prophylaxis 
(Nassereddine et al 2017, Ringden et al 2009). 
The likelihood of response to treatment decreases with increasing disease severity (Hill et al 2018). 
The overall aGvHD grade has major impact on the survival post HSCT. Adult and pediatric patients 
with grade III-IV aGvHD have a high mortality risk with a 2-year survival rate of 27-35% (Khoury et al 
2017).  
Acute GvHD is one of the most consistently reported risk factors for development of cGvHD. It is 
estimated that approximately 30-50% of the patients with aGvHD will develop cGvHD despite the 
treatment received (Pagliuca et al 2021, Ringden et al 2018). 
Chronic GvHD 
According to the current knowledge of cGvHD pathophysiology it begins with activation of host 
antigen-presenting cells (APC) expressed by damaged tissues and/or pathogens (Dhir et al 2014). 
Activated host APC then present host antigens to donor immune cells, leading to donor T-cell 
proliferation and inflammatory cytokine production. Cytokine dysregulation has also been implicated 
through observations that high levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IFNγ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
are associated with more severe cGvHD (Socie and Ritz 2014). These inflammatory cytokines then 
recruit and induce proliferation of additional immune effector cells, thereby perpetuating an adverse 
cycle of alloreactive tissue injury and inflammation (Paczesny et al 2010). 
Chronic GvHD is a major long-term complication after alloSCT (Jagasia et al 2015), occurring most 
frequently after 100 days post-transplant with a median time to onset reported as 162 days post-
transplant (Flowers et al 2011). While aGvHD is mainly a mature donor T cell-mediated inflammatory 
disease, cGvHD is characterized by the activation of complex signaling pathways in both T and B cells, 
reduced levels of circulating regulatory B cells (Bregs) and CD4+ Tregs (Hill et al 2018, Zhang et al 
2006). 
Chronic GvHD usually involves not only the epithelial target tissues affected in classic aGvHD (GI tract, 
liver, skin,) but also additional organ systems including lungs, muscles, fascia, joints, genitalia, eyes, 
and nails, (Jagasia et al 2015, Dhir et al 2014, Greinix et al 2011). The signs and symptoms include 
rash, raised or discoloured skin, thickening or tightening of skin, dry mouth, yellow discoloration of 
skin/eyes dry eyes, shortness of breath, weight loss, difficulty swallowing, fatigue, and muscle 
weakness (Pavletic et al 2006). 
Chronic GvHD is classified into mild, moderate, and severe based on degree and number of organs or 
sites involved according to standard criteria (Schoemans et al 2018, Jagasia et al 2015).  
Among patients who undergo alloSCT, cGvHD occurs in 30% to 70% of patients. The occurrence of 
cGvHD varies depending on the donor type, with 40% of recipients from matched sibling donor (Zeiser 
and Blazar 2017a, Lazaryan et al 2016). Approximately 30% of cGvHD are de novo without any 
preceding aGvHD (Lee 2017). The rates of cGvHD are lower in paediatric and adolescent patients as 
compared to adults (Dhir et al 2014, Flowers et al 2011, Kernan et al 1993). 
Chronic GvHD is a leading cause of non-relapse mortality and morbidity in patients surviving more 
than 2 years after transplantation. Chronic GvHD adversely affects physical and functional well-being 
as well as quality of life of most of the patients who are otherwise cured for their underlying disease 
after HSCT (Lee 2017, Arai et al 2015). The risk factors including grafting with growth factor mobilized 
blood cells and use of female donor for male recipients and unrelated donors associated with chronic 
GvHD were not changed after adjustment for prior aGvHD, suggesting that chronic GvHD is not simply 
an evolution of preceding acute GvHD (Flowers et al 2011). 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 10/177 
 
 
 
It is important to realize that the NIH diagnostic criteria (Jagasia 2015) were devised for clinical trials 
to ensure that study participants had unequivocal chronic GVHD. Many patients with signs and 
symptoms encountered in practice will not meet the NIH diagnostic criteria for chronic GVHD but 
nevertheless have active allo-immunity requiring systemic immunosuppression to improve symptoms 
and prevent ongoing organ damage. 
2.1.2.  Management 
There are no optimal or standard preventive methods for GvHD defined and treatments vary across 
institutions. Prophylaxis is mainly based on suppressing the donor T-cell function using 
immunosuppression regimens (calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF), anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), rituximab or T-cell depletion) (Hamilton 2018, Ruutu et 
al 2014), but often at the risk of underlying disease relapse or rejection (Ruutu et al 2012). 
Treatment for GvHD is based on the severity of the disease and the number of organs affected (please 
refer to aGvHD target organ staging below (Please refer to assessor’s comment, section 4.5.3.1.1. for 
aGcHD and the assessor’s comment, section 4.5.5.1.4 for cGvHD). Topical therapies including 
corticosteroids or CNI are recommended for patients with grade I aGvHD and mild cGvHD, whose 
disease is localized to the skin (Nassereddine et al 2017, Garnett et al 2013). Systemic treatments 
with corticosteroids are the standard first-line treatment for grade II to IV aGvHD and moderate to 
severe cGvHD.  
Management Acute GvHD 
In aGvHD, high dose systemic corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day or prednisone 2.0-2.5 
mg/kg/day) is the standard initial treatment of grade II to IV aGvHD (Penack et al 2020, Ruutu et al 
2014, Martin et al 2012).  
However, approximately 50% of patients with grade II to IV aGvHD do not show adequate response to 
corticosteroids and often become steroid resistant/refractory or fail to taper corticosteroids 
(Schoemans et al 2018, Jamil and Mineishi 2015). In addition, less than 50% of responding patients 
treated with steroids present a sustained response (Garnett et al 2013). Patients with aGvHD 
refractory to steroid therapy are at a high mortality risk with an estimated 2-year survival rate below 
20% (Malard et al 2020).  
Management chronic GvHD 
In cGvHD, systemic steroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg) with or without addition of CNIs are the 
recommended first-line therapy for patients with moderate to severe cGvHD (Penack et al 2020). 
Approximately 50% to 60% of patients do not respond or have inadequate control of disease with 
steroid treatment and require addition of another systemic therapy or fail to taper corticosteroids (Axt 
et al 2019, Inamoto et al 2014, Garnett et al 2013). Among patients who respond to treatment, 
responses were durable in 20% to 40% patients, and remaining patients were considered either 
resistant or refractory to steroids (Mawardi et al 2019, Garnett et al 2013). The estimated median 
duration of treatment with immunosuppressive therapy was 2 to 3 years (Jamil and Mineishi 2015). 
The long-term immunosuppressive treatment along with the disease associated immunodeficiency 
further increases the risk of serious and life-threatening infections.  
For patients with cGvHD who do not respond to steroids or are unable to taper steroids, the prognosis 
remains poor with a 5-year survival rate of 50 to 70%, necessitating the addition of other agents 
(Mawardi et al 2019, Wolff D et al 2011).

Tapering of corticosteroids is recommended in patients with clinical improvements to minimize the risk 
of infection and other toxicities. First-line treatment with a combination of steroids and other agents 
had failed so far to improve the outcomes and are associated with increased mortality or only sub-
optimal response rates. Adding additional therapy to prophylaxis and/or first line therapy is generally 
recommended for patients who fail to respond to corticosteroids, do not tolerate or fail to taper 
corticosteroids. The term “steroid intolerance” has not been formally validated but refers to the 
emergence of unacceptable toxicity (e.g. uncontrolled infections, avascular necrosis, arterial 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, myopathy, osteoporosis, etc.) attributed to corticosteroids, as 
evaluated by a healthcare professional.  
Due to the lack of large scale, positive randomized prospective studies to compare the efficacy and 
safety of second-line therapy for GvHD, no standard second-line treatment is defined in the EU. 
However, the most common used second-line agents recommended in both acute and chronic GvHD 
include ruxolitinib, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), low-dose MTX, MMF, mTOR inhibitors 
(everolimus or sirolimus), or infliximab. These agents may be used alone or in combinations with 
steroids (Penack et al 2020, Ruutu et al 2014, Wolff et al 2011). Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), 
etanercept, and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are also recommended for use as second line 
treatment of aGVHD. Additional treatments in cGvHD include rituximab, imatinib, pentostatin, and 
ibrutinib. A need exists for novel therapies in this hard-to-treat population. 
Ruxolitinib was first approved (treatment of MF) under the trade name of Jakafi® in Nov-2011 in the 
USA. Ruxolitinib is since 2019 registered for the treatment of SR-aGvHD in the USA, based on the data 
from single-arm, multi-centre, Phase II Study 18424-271 (REACH 1; supportive study for this 
submission; hereafter referred to as Study 271) (Jagasia et al 2020). Furthermore, the BTK inhibitor 
ibrutinib, is also approved in the USA and Canada since 2017, for the treatment of patients with cGvHD 
who had failed one to three lines of prior systemic therapy, based on the results from a Phase Ib/II 
single arm study (n=42).  
2.1.3.  About the product 
Ruxolitinib (Jakavi®/Jakafi®, INC424, INCB018424 phosphate) is a potent and selective inhibitor of 
Janus Kinases (JAKs), JAK1 and JAK2, mutated JAK2V617F, with moderate and minimal inhibitory 
activity against TYK2 and JAK3. Ruxolitinib interferes with the signalling of a number of cytokines and 
growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function. The JAK-STAT pathway 
plays a critical role in cytokine signalling and the development of several immune cell types, leading to 
T-cell proliferation, tissue damage and is a promising target for GvHD treatment (Schwartz et al 2016).  
Inhibition of JAK1/2 signalling results in reduced proliferation of donor effector T cells, suppression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to alloantigen, as well as impairment of antigen 
presenting cells, based on in vitro and in mouse models. Data from murine and mice models suggest 
that graft-versus-leukaemia effect of alloreactive T cells was maintained after ruxolitinib 
administration. 
2.1.4.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific Advice was sought in the EU for the Phase III study D2301 protocol in chronic GvHD 
(Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1155/2/2016/II). The CHMP acknowledged that a placebo-controlled 
study would not be possible considering the differences between the best available therapies (BAT) 
allowed in the comparator arm. The listing of acceptable BAT was endorsed but it was noted that the 
many options will add to the heterogeneity of the control group. The CHMP suggested to consider 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 12/177 
 
 
 
limitation of cross-over to ‘early-progressors’. Regarding the proposed study population, it was noted 
that adolescents aged ≥12 years might significantly differ in terms of underlying disease, prior anti-
neoplastic treatment, type of donor and stem cell source used and overall immunotolerance with 
unknown impact on study outcomes. Moreover, preclinical safety data in juvenile rats suggested bone 
effects of ruxolitinib with unknown consequences for safety in children. Next, it was advised to restrict 
the trial participation to true steroid-refractory patients according to NIH consensus on criteria for 
clinical trials in cGvHD, i.e. excluding steroid-dependent GvHD patients that are not able to taper the 
corticosteroid dose. Alternatively, steroid-refractoriness/steroid-dependency according to NIH definition 
should at least be considered for inclusion as stratification factor. With regard to the proposed 
endpoints, CHMP stated that clinically significant and statistically compelling results in favour of 
ruxolitinib in terms of ORR and failure free survival (FFS), if supported by consistent findings in 
relevant secondary endpoints, without detrimental effects on OS and the cumulative incidence of 
relapse of the underlying malignancy, could be sufficient to conclude on clinical benefit. The use of the 
Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale instrument (Lee 2002), FACT-BMT, and EQ-5D to characterize 
patients reported outcomes and symptom burden improvement was accepted.  
Pre-submission meetings with Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur were held in November 2020. 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) has been agreed with the Paediatric Committee for aGvHD (EMEA-
000901-PIP03-16-M01) and cGvHD (EMEA-000901-PIP04-17-M01). 
2.1.5.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The clinical studies included in this application were, as claimed by the applicant, conducted in full 
compliance with current Good Clinical Practices (ICH E6). Nevertheless, during assessment a GCP 
inspection has been performed due to the concerns raised by the high numbers of protocol deviations. 
Further details and impact of the inspection is provided in section 2.5.5 discussion on clinical efficacy. 
Overall, according to the inspectors, the observed findings are unlikely to have a significant impact on 
data integrity within the inspected clinical trials. The inspection team did not identify any restrictions 
on the usability of the reported trial data, and therefore it was the recommendation of the inspectors 
that the data of the REACH-2 and REACH-3 clinical trials could be used for evaluation and assessment 
of the application. The Committee/Rapporteurs shares this view and therefore concludes that the 
findings are unlikely to have had any significant impact on the benefit-risk balance with regard to both 
aGvHD and cGvHD. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
This variation does not include any specific quality variation application and the already approved 
formulations, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg tablets for adults, are proposed for the paediatric population from 
12 years of age. The 5 and 10 mg tablets are round curved tablets, 7.5 and 9.3 mm in diameter 
respectively. The 15 and 20 mg tablets are ovaloid or elongated tablets of approximately 15 x 7 mm 
and 17 x 7 mm respectively. The tablets contain the excipients microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium 
stearate, colloidal anhydrous silica, sodium starch glycolate, povidone, hydroxypropylcellulose and 
lactose monohydrate.  
Suitability of the formulation for the paediatric population from 12 years of age. 
Since the variation concerns an introduction of a paediatric population, the suitability of the proposed 
formulation in the proposed age group should be addressed, in line with the Guideline on 
pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev.2. No 
such justification has been provided but this can be accepted since the proposed adult formulation only 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 13/177 
 
 
 
contains commonly used excipients in amounts for which no safety issues are foreseen in the proposed 
target age group. The proposed adult formulation is considered acceptable from a quality point of view.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
With this submission, the MAH has provided data pharmacology non clinic studies with ruxolitinib in 
acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). All other aspects in of the nonclinical program 
remain unchanged, since the submission of the original dossier. 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Ruxolitinib oral administration in an MHC-mismatched allo-HSCT mouse model resulted in the 
decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines, reduced immune-cell infiltration in diseased colon 
tissue, reduced GvHD scores and body weight loss, preserved engraftment, and improved survival. 
Ruxolitinib inhibited pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 phosphorylation in T cells and in the inflamed colon tissue, 
consistent with JAK-STAT pathway inhibition. Ruxolitinib was efficacious in ameliorating disease 
severity in steroid-refractory mice with acute GvHD, leading to significant improvements in percent 
body weight loss, GvHD score, and increased survival. 
Additionally, ruxolitinib was efficacious in ameliorating disease severity in a MHC-matched, miHA-
mismatched chronic GvHD mouse model, leading to reduced GvHD scores, weight gain, significant 
survival benefits, improved skin integrity, and reduced incidence of skin and lung inflammation. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment 
For this new indication, the MAH has calculated a PECsw incorporating the previously approved 
indications. 
Total PECsurfacewater 
It is concluded that PECsw remains below the trigger value and no further steps are taken. Previous 
assessment has demonstrated ruxolitinib not be a PBT substance. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The presented non clinical data have provided proof of concept support for the clinical development of 
ruxolitinib in treatment of acute and chronic GvHD. The clinical data further developed has then 
provided the necessary safety and efficacy data to support the extension of indication. No further non-
clinical data have been provided which is considered acceptable. The updated data submitted in this 
application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of 
ruxolitinib in the new indication.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new drug strength was developed to support this submission. 
Bioanalysis 
The previously validated method DMB-07.111.2 (Incyte) was used for samples from study 271 /REACH 
1. Standard curve and QCs accuracy and precision in the within study validation were within pre-set 
acceptance criteria. Incurred sample reanalysis was performed for 77 samples (10.3%). All (77/77 or 
100%) of the results for INCB018424 agreed within 20% of the original results. The oldest plasma 
sample was 296 days old prior to analysis, which was within the long term stability of at least 372 days 
stored at -60 to -80°C. 
Two new liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were fully validated 
for the determination of ruxolitinib in plasma. The method validated at SGS [DMPK R1701012] was 
employed for the quantitative analysis of ruxolitinib in human plasma samples (with Ethylenediamine-
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as anticoagulant) collected in the Study C2301 as well as in the Study D2301, 
while the method validated at WuXi AppTec [DMPK R1100270a-02] supported the long term stability of 
ruxolitinib, but was not used to analyse study samples. The long-term stability period of 813 days (at ≤ 
-70 °C) covered the maximum length of time from specimen collection to analysis for the two studies. 
In both methods, 50 µL K2-EDTA plasma samples were subjected to liquid-liquid extraction, 
evaporation of the supernatant to dryness, and analysis of the reconstituted sample residue by LC-
MS/MS. Validation parameters are summarised in Table 1.

In the method validation DMPK R1701012, all following parameters were within pre-set acceptance 
criteria: no interference with fluconazole was demonstrated, no matrix effect (6 individual plasma 
lots), specificity (8 individual plasma lots), no effect of haemolysis or lipaemia, and dilution linearity 
upon 10 fold dilution. Certificates of analysis for analytes and internal standard were provided.  
The within study validation showed that the standard curve and QCs accuracy and precision were 
within pre-set acceptance criteria. Incurred sample reanalysis was performed in 47 of study samples 
from study C2301 and 95.7% of samples met the pre-specified criteria, and in 110 of study samples 
from study D2301 and 99.1% of samples met the pre-specified criteria.  
Study INCB 18424-271 (REACH 1 or 271) 
Study 271 was a prospective, open-label, single-cohort, multicenter Phase 2 study of ruxolitinib in 
combination with corticosteroids for the treatment of steroid-refractory Grades II to IV aGVHD. 
Seventy-one participants began treatment at ruxolitinib 5 mg b.i.d; if hematologic parameters were 
stable and no treatment-related toxicity was observed after the first 3 days of treatment, the dose 
could be increased to 10 mg b.i.d. 
PK samples were taken on Days 1, 7, and 14 (predose and 1 h (±15 min), 2 h (±30 min), and 4-8 h 
post-dose). PK parameters were calculated from the plasma concentrations of ruxolitinib according to a 
population PK approach, see below.  
Study C2301 (REACH 2) 
Two versions of the clinical study report were submitted, the Primary CSR dated 9.3.2020 with data 
cutoff 25.7.19 with its amendment, dated 12.08.2020 and the Secondary CSR dated 29.07.20 with 
data cutoff 6.1.2020. Only the primary CSR contained PK data and is presented here. 
Study C2301 was a randomized (1:1) Phase III, open label study of ruxolitinib compared to 
Investigator choice BAT in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (adults and adolescents (≥12 years 
old) with Grade II-IV aGVHD. The assessment of PK of ruxolitinib in SR-aGvHD patients was a 
secondary endpoint. 
Ruxolitinib was administered at a starting dose of 10 mg twice daily (as 2x 5 mg with or without food) 
until Week 4. Thereafter patients who had complete or partial response continued to receive ruxolitinib 
up to Week 24. Adolescents received the same ruxolitinib dose as adults. Dose reductions were 
allowed when given with strong CYP3A4 or dual CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dose and frequency of 
best available therapy (BAT) was based the Investigator’s opinion. 
The Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS) included a total of 200 patients, 152 of whom were patients 
randomized to ruxolitinib arm, and 48 patients who crossed over to ruxolitinib from BAT. PK 
parameters from patients with “extensive PK” sampling were available from 22 adult patients and 5 
adolescent patients. The sampling was as follows: days 1 and 7 at pre-dose and 0.5 h, 1.0 h, 1.5 h, 
2.0 h, 4.0 h, 6.0 h and 9 h (±15 min) post-dose; day 14, 28, 56 and 168: predose and 2 h postdose 
(± 15 min) for complete and partial responders. Sparse PK sampling was performed for all the other 
adult patients predose and postdose 2 h (± 15 min) on Days 1, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 168. 
Assessment report

PK data was analysed by non-compartmental analysis (NCA), as detailed here, and included in the 
population PK analysis. The NCA PK parameters were as follows: 
After a single dose of 10 mg ruxolitinib, mean plasma concentrations increased rapidly reaching the 
peak concentration at approximately 1.6 h followed by rapid distribution and elimination phases. On 
Cycle 1 Day 1, the geometric mean (Geo-mean) peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 118 (CV 
70.4%) ng/mL; AUCinf and AUClast were 470 (CV 71.2%) ng*h/mL and 511 (CV 95.7%) ng*h/mL 
respectively.  
After multiple dosing at Day 7, the accumulation ratio was low (1.2), indicating minimal accumulation 
of ruxolitinib with continuous dosing. After 7 days of continuous dosing, geometric mean Cmax was 
137.1 ng/mL and AUCtau was 713.4 ng.h/mL. 
Oral plasma clearance at steady state (CLss/F) of ruxolitinib after oral dosing at 10 mg twice daily was 
estimated as 23.3 L/h, which was comparable to the CL/F obtained from AUCinf after a single 10 mg 
oral dose. This suggested that clearance is not expected to change with time. Similarly, geometric 
mean terminal T1/2 appeared to be independent of time and ranged from 1.9-2.0 h after both single 
and repeated doses.  
Most of the patients in the ruxolitinib arm (134/152) received concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors during 
the study. The most frequently administered CYP3A4 inhibitors were cyclosporin (61.2%), 
posaconazole (48.0%) and voriconazole (20.4%) which are known to be moderate or strong inhibitor 
of CYP3A4. Though a large fraction of the ruxolitinib-treated population received CYP3A4 inhibitors, PK 
parameters on Day 7 could be estimated only for 22 patients from whom extensive PK samples were 
collected. Of these 22 patients, only 4 patients were without a strong or moderate concomitant CYP3A4 
inhibitor and the PK variability in these 4 patients was high. 
PK parameters at Day 1 in adolescent patients could be computed for only 5 patients, however, within 
the ambit of the available data, the exposure in adolescent patients was within the range observed in 
adult patients (Table below).

Study D2301 was a randomized, open-label, multi-center study of ruxolitinib vs. BAT in patients 
(adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years old) with moderate or severe cGvHD after allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation. The assessment of PK of ruxolitinib in SR-cGvHD patients was a secondary endpoint. 
Ruxolitinib vs. BAT was added to the patient’s immunosuppressive regimen corticosteroids ± 
calcineurin inhibitor (CNI). Dose and frequency of BAT was based the Investigator’s opinion. 
Ruxolitinib was administered at a dose of 10 mg b.i.d daily, (as 2x 5 mg with or without food) for a 
minimum of 6 (28 day) cycles until cycle 7 Day 1. Thereafter patients who had complete or partial 
response continued to receive ruxolitinib up to Cycle 39. Dose modifications (reductions and/or 
interruptions) and delays were permitted to address safety concerns related to haematological 
(primarily, cytopenias) or non-haematological reasons, or to avoid under- or over-exposure of 
ruxolitinib when combined with CYP450 modulators. Adolescents received the same ruxolitinib dose as 
adults.  
The Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS) included a total of 221 patients, 164 of whom were patients 
randomized to ruxolitinib arm, and 57 patients who crossed over to ruxolitinib from BAT. PK 
parameters from patients with “extensive PK” sampling were available from 17 adult patients and 4 
adolescent patients who received a dose of 10 mg ruxolitinib twice daily. PK parameters at Day 1 in 
adolescent patients could be computed for only 2 or 3 available samples for one of the adolescents.  
For the extensive PK dataset, on days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 samples were taken pre-dose (0 h), post-
dose (0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h (±15 min), 4 h, 6 h, 9 h (±1 hr); at Cycle 2, 7 and 39, one pre-dose and one-
post dose 1.5 hr (±15 min). Sparse PK sampling was available for all the other patients: predose and 
postdose 1.5 h (± 15 min) on Day 1 of Cycle 1, Day 15 of Cycle 1, and Day 1 of Cycle 2, 7 and 39. 
Sparse PK samples for cross-over patients from BAT to ruxolitinib were taken only at the time of a 
scheduled visit. 
PK data was analysed by non-compartmental analysis, as detailed here, and included in the population 
PK analysis.  
After a single dose of 10 mg ruxolitinib, median Tmax was 0.833 h; geo mean Cmax was 167 (39.3%) 
ng/mL; AUCinf and AUClast were 642 (32.7%) ng.h/mL and 636 (40.8%) ng.h/mL respectively; 
elimination half-life (T1/2) was 2.40h in patients receiving ruxolitinib at a dose of 10 mg. 
After multiple dosing at Day 15, ruxolitinib PK profile was similar to that at Day 1. A slightly higher 
peak plasma concentration level was observed in the Day 15 profile; however, large variability was 
noted. On Day 15, geo mean AUCtau was 656 (20.4%) ng.h/mL; AUClast was 945 (56.1%) ng.h/mL 
and Cmax was 215 (48.8%) ng/mL in patients receiving ruxolitinib at a dose of 10 mg b.i.d. 
Oral plasma clearance at steady state (CLss/F) of ruxolitinib after oral dosing at 10 mg twice daily was 
estimated as 15.2 L/h. The geometric mean terminal half-life (T1/2) appeared to be independent of 
time and ranged from 2.3 to 2.4 h.  
Within the ambit of the available data, the exposure in adolescent patients was within the range 
observed in adult patients (Table below).

Population Pharmacokinetic analysis 
The applicant has submitted three model based pharmacokinetic analysis reports.  
1. Report DMPK R1800133 (Projected Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Anticipated Therapeutic Dose of 
Ruxolitinib (INC424) in Paediatric population) describes dose selection in children from 0 years and is 
out of the scope for this application. Therefore, it is not reviewed. 
2. Report DMB-18.34.1 (Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of the JAK Inhibitor Ruxolitinib Tablets in 
Combination with Corticosteroids for the Treatment of Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft-Versus-Host 
Disease INCB 18424-271) only includes GvHD patient data from Reach 1 (phase 2 study). The report 
below is updated with additional phase 3 data, has similar objectives, and includes a re-assessment of 
the final model presented in this report. Therefore, this model is not assessed in dept or described in 
this assessment.  
3. Report named Population pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib in steroidrefractory (SR) acute and chronic 
(a+c) Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) adult and adolescent patients Modeling Report (Final, 27 Nov 
2020) includes GvHD patients’ data from Reach 1, 2 and 3 and an update of the model from Report 
DMB-18-34-1. This report is considered to include the pivotal analysis of ruxolitinib in the GvHD 
population and is described below.  
Methods 
The objective was to characterize PK in acute and chronic GvHD patients and investigate the covariates 
in this population which explain the inter-patient variability. 
Software 
The analysis is performed using the Monolix software system, Monolix 2019R2 (Lixoft, Paris, France) 
utilizing the DaVinci high performance computing environment accessed from GPSII. All model building 
was performed using Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM) method). 
Data 
The final model included data from the studies Reach 1, 2 and 3, added during model development in a 
staggered manner. 11.6% of data were censored (below quantification limit). 
Model 
The model was a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and linear elimination, with a lag 
time, and an exponential residual error structure (additional error model, with log-normal IIV 
distributions). Inter-individual variability (IIV) was estimated for all parameters apart from lag time 
and inter-compartmental clearance. Administration of CYP3A4-inhibitors (moderate and potent vs weak 
and none), aGvHD disease grade at each assessment (MAGIC score, <4 vs. 4), and liver involvement 
in aGvHD at each assessment (liver score >=1, Y/N), all included on apparent clearance, and aGvHD 
disease grade at each assessment (MAGIC score <=1 vs. >1) on the absorption rate. A covariance 
term was added for the IIV on apparent central volume and clearance.

Components of this model were reassessed to determine whether simpler or alternative models could 
better describe the PK data in aGvHD patients. In particular, according to [PK Report DMB-18 341], 
high IIV was observed on V2 and ka, which was attributed to the composition of the data used for 
model building, notably the limited dense PK sampling for REACH 1 (and also 1 of the MF studies).  
The original model incorporates an additive error model, with log-normal distributions implemented on 
the IIV terms. A normal distribution will be implemented in place of a log-normal distribution. 
The model was reassessed first by adding data from study Reach 2, and subsequently reassessed 
again adding data from study Reach 3. All comparisons will be made using the BIC, since models will 
not be nested and therefore a likelihood ratio test cannot be performed. A reduction of >3 BIC units 
constitutes a significant model improvement. 
Relevant covariates will be assessed with the aGvHD final base model, along with additional potential 
candidates that may be expected to impact ruxolitinib PK. Forward selection will be implemented and 
correlated covariates will be tested separately and the more appropriate covariate will then be included 
individually. Eighty percent of the datasets were used for covariate model building, with the remaining 
20% used for validation. The data was split with a random Bernoulli variable. Patients with 
missing/unknown levels of a covariate of interest (e.g. Race) were also excluded from the model 
building dataset and added to the external validation dataset provided they were not a significant 
covariate in the final model. All data (with valid covariate information as per the final model) was used 
for simulations.  
Final Model 
The final model is a 2-compartment, 1st order absorption model, with a lag time and linear elimination. 
Additional IIV was placed on CL/F and Vc/F. 
Median scaled BSA had a significant impact on Vc/F and Cl/F, with an increase in Vc/F observed with 
increasing BSA (as expected), and decreased Cl/F with increasing BSA. Lower GI involvement to the 
GvHD at baseline had a significant impact on primarily on the peripheral volume, but also on the 
absorption rate. The presence of lower GI involvement of the disease at baseline indicated a lower 
absorption rate and an increase in the peripheral volume. The reduction in absorption rate is expected, 
since ruxolitinib is orally administered, and therefore any indication of GI disease would logically 
impact the absorption of the drug. The indication of chronic GvHD (compared to acute GvHD) has a 
significant impact on Ka, Cl/F and Vc/F, resulting in an increased Ka, decreased Cl/F and decreased 
Vc/F. All of these impacts result in overall higher exposures in cGvHD patients compared to aGvHD 
patients, as previously indicated by the initial VPC (for the final aGvHD model on the cGvHD data).  
The final parameter estimates, after running the model with an increased number of simulations, are 
given below and the models ability to predict the observed data, stratified on acute and chronic GvHD 
is presented in Figure 1, and BSA <1.5 mf vs >=1.5 m2 is presented in Figure 2. The impact of BSA 
and other covariates is graphically presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4.

2.4.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-Response  
Data from the two phase 3 studies (C2301 for aGvHD and D2301 for cGvHD) were used and analysed 
separately. Time-averaged AUC0-12h was the exposure metrics that was used. Cmax was not 
considered for safety endpoints, since the safety endpoints selected were chosen based on underlying 
disease and systemic treatments. Several demographic and disease related covariates were 
investigated in the analysis. If there were more than 10% missing values for a covariate then the 
covariate was not included in the covariate selection.  
Overall response rate (ORR), durable response rate (DRR) and modified Lee symptoms score at Cycle 
7 Day 1 were analysed with logistic regression models. Overall Survival (OS), duration of response 
(DoR) and failure free survival (FFS) were analysed with Cox regression models. The PK-efficacy set 
included 150 patients each from Study C2301 (up to the data cut-off date of 06-Jan-2020) and Study 
D2301 (up to the data cut-off date of 15-May-2020). 
Only adverse events of special interest (AESI) that were reported in adequate numbers (at least 10% 
and no more than 90% of the patients in the PK Safety Set of each AESI) of patients were analysed. If 
there was a considerable portion of patients with several occurrences of the same AESI (e.g. if the 
median number of AESI per patient is 2 or more), this AESI in question was analysed with a count 
regression model. The PK-safety set included 194 patients from Study C2301 (up to the data cut-off 
date of 06- Jan-2020) and 150 patients from Study D2301 (up to the data cut-off date of 15-May-
2020) 
Results 
There was an absence of a strong relationship between the exposure metric (time-averaged AUC0-12) 
and the efficacy and safety endpoints for patients with aGvHD and cGvHD. This may be due to the 
limited exposure range observed with a dosing regimen of 10mg bid.

Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of ruxolitinib and platelet count 
in GvHD patients 
There were two main objectives with the below presented analysis  
1. To characterize exposure–response relationship of ruxolitinib and longitudinal platelet count, in the 
context of thrombocytopenia, in GvHD (acute+chronic) patients and investigate the covariates in this 
population which could explain a part of the inter-patient variability  
2. Quantify and qualify the impact of ruxolitinib dose on the ruxolitinib induced thrombocytopenia in 
acute and chronic GvHD population through simulations of patient platelet profiles, for fixed dosing 
regimens of 5mg bid and 10mg bid, accounting for predictors of platelets counts identified during 
model building.  
Methods 
Average predicted concentration between platelet measurements was used instead of observed 
concentrations (derived from the final pop PK model).  
A previously developed base semi-mechanistic life span model was modified in order for model to be 
able to capture the typically very low (<50 Gi/L) baseline platelet counts seen in acute GvHD patient. A 
small set of covariates were tested in the final acute and chronic GvHD model. The number of patients, 
platelet and transfusion observations per study in the corresponding modelling datasets is listed below. 
The modelling datasets included platelet and transfusion observations for the first 168 days of 
treatment. 
Number if platelet observations and platelet transfusions by study in the modelling datasets 
Distinct differences between the two studies were observed with baseline platelet count, as well as 
overall profiles whilst receiving ruxolitinib treatment (Figure 5). This is largely due to a longer time 
since stem cell transplant in the cGvHD indication, by definition, >100 days. For the aGvHD patients 
(from study C2301), there is limited trend. This is in general due to the fact that all patients are <100 
days since transplant, and therefore have not fully achieved platelet recovery. 
Assessment report

Page 25/177 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Boxplot of baseline platelet counts stratified by study 
Given the differences observed between the two studies, and in particular, the fact that study D2301 
(cGvHD patients) have generally normal platelet levels, the analysis moving forward will be conducted 
only on study C2301 (aGvHD patients).  
Final model 
The final base model therefore incorporated a chain of 5 compartments, including 1 precursor 
compartment with proliferative cells, such as stem cells and other progenitor cells, three transit 
compartments with maturating cells, and one compartment for circulating platelets. A feedback 
mechanism was incorporated to reproduce proliferation regulation based on ratio between normal 
baseline value and actual platelet count. In the acute GvHD population most patients start with 
extremely low platelet counts due to the short time since transplantation, and the inclusion of time-
varying baseline platelet count is needed to capture these observations. Plasma concentrations of 
ruxolitinib (averaged between platelet measurements) were assumed to inhibit the proliferation rate by 
a linear slope model. Platelet transfusion events were incorporated in the model to account for 
resulting quick elevations in platelet counts. Only the covariate “effect of time since the engraftment 
with the respect to the first dose” (TTRANSDOS1) on projected platelet count at engraftment time 
(PLTT) was carried into the final model. 
The parameter estimates for the final model are shown in Table below. The final fit of the model is 
displayed in Figure 6, with a further validation component to fit the model to a separate test dataset 
(20% of the original dataset) and is displayed in Figure 7. The VPC for the covariate model improves 
the fit towards the end of the treatment period, suggesting that by adjusting for time since transplant 
(relative to first dose) on the platelet count, allows a better description of the recovery phase.

The model well captures the initial reduction of platelet count, initiated from a very low baseline, and 
gradual recovery of platelet function (recovery is defined as >100,000/mm3) which is observed while 
still receiving ruxolitinib (within 4032 hours, which corresponds to Day 168 of study). Extrapolation of 
this model to high platelet count is somewhat optimistic in the early phase. The full recovery generally 
occurs before 100 days (by 2400 hours, 3 cycles) which is during the taper period. The results suggest 
that for aGvHD patients, there is an initial reduction of platelet count with initiation of ruxolitinib, but 
this can generally be managed well by short term dose reductions/interruptions and platelet 
transfusions as per protocol. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The bioanalytical method used for study 271 / REACH1 was previously assessed in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002464/II/16. Within study validation for study 271 is adequate. Both methods DMPK 
R1701012 & R1100270a have demonstrated acceptable sensitivity, specificity, selectivity and stability 
for the quantification of ruxolitinib. Within study validation was also adequate. Methods DMPK 
R1701012 & R1100270a are not cross-validated. This is acceptable since method R1100270a is only 
used to support the long term stability of samples and is itself adequately validated. 
Single and repeated PK data following a 10 mg ruxolitinib were obtained in acute GvHD and chronic 
GvHD subjects. In both groups, ruxolitinib was absorbed rapidly, with a tmax of approximately 1.5 
hour. After multiple dosing, the accumulation ratio was low (1.2), indicating minimal accumulation of 
ruxolitinib with continuous dosing. Terminal t1/2 was approximately 1.9-2.0h in aGvHD subjects and 
2.3-2.4h in cGvHD subjects. Further, ruxolitinib PK appeared to be independent of time. Clearance was 
10.4 l/h in patients with acute GvHD and 7.8 l/h in patients with chronic GvHD, with a 49% inter 
subject variability. No relationship was apparent between oral clearance and gender, patient age or 
race, based on a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in GvHD patients. 
Special populations & interactions 
Compared to the dedicated studies, no mechanistic or physiological difference is expected in the GvHD 
population for patients that have hepatic impairment (HI) or when combined with CYP3A4 inhibitors 
that would result in a different outcome with respect to PK. Therefore, a similar magnitude of 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 28/177 
 
 
 
 
interaction is expected in GvHD patients and this is aligned to the recommendation for CYP3A4 
inhibition and for hepatic impairment not due to GvHD with prior recommendation.  
Dual CYP3A4/CYP2C9 inhibitors. In line with the MF and PV indications and partly based on the popPK 
analysis where visual predictive checks suggested that administration of fluconazole in patients 
increased ruxolitinib concentration levels approximately 2-fold, the 50% dose reduction in patients 
with GvHD when co-administered with dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes is considered 
acceptable. 
Hepatic impairment. Based on the observed and predicted plasma exposures across all hepatic 
impairment categories (total bilirubin and AST levels) in the PopPK analyses no dose adjustment 
appears necessary in GvHD patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. Nevertheless, 
considering the  numbers of aGvHD and cGvHD patients included in each hepatic impairment subgroup 
(as classified by total bilirubin and AST levels) in the popPK analysis and the data collected, the 
proposed conservative approach and the advice that the starting dose of ruxolitinib in patients with 
liver impairment not related to GvHD should be reduced by 50%, in line with the current advice in MF 
and PV patients, is agreed. 
Renal impairment. In the popPK study, GvHD patients with moderate renal impairment had very 
similar observed and predicted plasma exposures to those who had no renal impairment at baseline. 
This provides support that the current posology advice for MF and PV patients with mild or moderate 
renal impairment patients, i.e. no dose adjustment is recommended, is also valid for GvHD patients 
belonging to the same special subpopulation.  
Considering the proposed recommendation on dosing of GvHD subjects with ESRD and in absence of 
further modelling and simulation data the SmPC has been updated including  the proposed text that no 
data are available for ESRD. 
The pharmacokinetics profile observed in adolescent patients with acute or chronic GvHD was 
comparable to the overall patient population 
Population PK 
The main objective of the model-based population PK analysis was to assess relevant covariates to 
explain the exposure in patients with acute and chronic GvHD and have a model adequate for 
simulation of post-hoc PK parameters to be used in exposure-response analysis. Adolescent subjects 
are expected to have a lower, or much lower, BSA than the average adult. In addition, the GvHD 
population is more sensitive to haematological side effects. It is of importance that the starting dose in 
the subjects with lowest BSA is appropriate. The presented VPCs indicate that the model can capture 
the general trend in the analysed population (no major deviations between observed and predicted 
data points), and the goodness-of-fit plots to not indicate any obvious major trends of model 
misspecification. There is a concern regarding the potential overparameterization of the final model. 
However, the VPCs adequately predict the data with respect to BSA and acute and chronic GvHD 
population and the final model parameters seem reasonable (i.e. not large RSEs or unreasonable 
parameter estimates). Therefore, given the application of the model (inform the suitability of the dose 
in subjects with low BSA) and that there is sufficient clinical efficacy and safety data, a new model is 
not requested. The safety and efficacy data are mainly represented by subjects with a BSA >1.5m2. 
(BSA 1.03-1.25m2 n=9; BSA 1.25-1.5 m2, n=47; BSA 1.5-1.75 m2, n=133; BSA >1.75 m2 n=293). All 
subjects included in the study received the same starting dose, which was adjusted based on safety 
and efficacy. BSA is the covariate that has the highest impact on exposure of ruxolitinib, however 
there is a considerable overlap of exposures. The impact of BSA on ruxolitinib exposure is presented in 
the SmPC section 5.2.

PK/PD modelling 
The exposure-response analysis was sufficiently explored, however the results from the analysis are 
inconclusive and should be interpreted with caution. This is because all subjects included in the 
exposure-response analysis received 10 mg b.i.d. which results in a limited exposure range. There is 
sufficient clinical patient efficacy and safety data to overcome the inconclusive data from Modelling. 
(see Clinical Efficacy and Clinical Safety sections). 
The applicant developed a model to characterize the relationship of ruxolitinib and longitudinal platelet 
count, in the context of thrombocytopenia, in acute GvHD patients. Only data from the phase 3 C2301 
study (aGvHD) study was used in the model development. There is limited information on impact of 
starting dose and subsequently exposure, because all patients had a starting dose of 10 mg b.i.d. 
Therefore, information available is too limited to answer the second objective (i.e. impact of starting 
dose on thrombocytopenia) and results of the simulations should be interpreted with caution.  
PD. For the pivotal clinical Phase 3 trials, PD related endpoints were defined to explore cytokines and 
GvHD biomarkers were planned to be collected and included as exploratory endpoint in both pivotal 
trials. Results of these exploratory endpoints have not been presented. No conclusion on predictive 
values of the biomarkers from the selected panels can be drawn at this point. Evaluations for the 
association of selected marker with response are continuing as the data matures and are expected to 
be reported when available. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, ruxolitinib PK in GvHD subjects is clarified to a sufficient extent.  
Population PK model adequately characterize the PK of ruxolitinib in the GvHD population. Body 
surface area was the covariate with highest impact on ruxolitinib exposure. Subjects with lower BSA 
have a higher exposure, which is reflected in the SmPC. The results from the exposure-response 
analysis are inconclusive and should be interpreted with caution because all subjects included received 
10 mg b.i.d. which results in a limited exposure range. The applicant developed a model to 
characterize the relationship of ruxolitinib and longitudinal platelet count in acute GvHD patients using 
only data from the phase 3 C2301 study (aGvHD), however, there is no information on impact of a 
different starting dose.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose-selection rationale 
No formal dose finding study has been presented. Ruxolitinib dose selection was based on the 
published data on preliminary efficacy and safety generated in patients with SR-GvHD and from the 
supportive study INCB 18424-271 (A Single-Cohort, Phase 2 Study of ruxolitinib in combination with 
corticosteroids for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease [REACH-
1])(Zeiser et al 2015). The dose administered in this study was lower than that generally administered 
in myelofibrosis patients (i.e. 15-20 mg bid), due to that alloSCT patients with SR-aGvHD would 
routinely be treated with concurrent CNI and azole prophylaxis that can inhibit the metabolism (via 
CYP3A4) of ruxolitinib, potentially increasing its exposure. The usage of same dose of ruxolitinib 10 mg 
b.i.d. in adolescents in Study C2301 and D2301 was supported by the published literature showing 
similar toxicity profiles, maximum tolerated doses, and ruxolitinib PK parameters in both adolescents 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022

and adults (Loh et al 2015). The dose selection seems adequate, based on preclinical and clinical 
publications and Pk analysis. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
There are two pivotal Phase III Studies (CINC424C2301 and CINC424D2301, hereafter referred to as

Grading of GvHD according to MAGIC criteria (Harris et al 2016), is a tool to standardize the collection 
of complex clinical data for acute GvHD (not advising treatment in clinical practice), and to collect a 
quantification of symptoms (extent of skin rash, total bilirubin level, volume of diarrhea etc) and still 
valid and used in most EU transplant centres and recommended by the EBMT.  
The choice of aGvHD grading according to Harris et al 2016 is appropriate and presently the most 
commonly used grading instrument. However, the adherence may vary between centres due to the 
meticulousness demanded and time-consuming task of grading. The applicant has presented means 
taken to ensure the reliability and integrity of the data. The high number of PD have been highlighted, 
however the actual numbers of PD with respect to efficacy assessment for the timepoint of primary 
and key secondary endpoints were relatively low. Furthermore, a post-hoc sensitivity analysis, based 
on data from the secondary analysis cut-off, has been conducted excluding patients with PDs related to 
aGvHD efficacy assessment on the primary and key secondary endpoints showing similar results to 
those reported in the overall patient population (FAS).  
Treatments 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either best available therapy (BAT) or ruxolitinib.  
Test and reference therapies, dose- and mode of administration: 
Patients were randomised to receive: 
•  RUX 10 mg orally twice daily or 
•  Best available therapy (BAT) identified by the Investigator prior to patient randomisation 
among the following treatments: anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), extracorporeal photopheresis 
(ECP), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), low-dose methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF), mTOR inhibitors (everolimus or sirolimus), etanercept, or infliximab. No other 
types or combinations of BAT were permitted. Within the first 28 days after randomisation, the 
initiation or addition of another BAT was allowed for patients meeting criteria of disease 
progression, mixed response, no response but was considered a treatment failure for both the 
primary and key secondary objectives. 
Dose modifications 
RUX dose modifications (reductions and/or interruptions) and delays were permitted to address safety 
concerns related to haematological (primarily, cytopenias) or non-haematological reasons, or to avoid 
under- or over-exposure of RUX when combined with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A4 inhibitors. RUX dose could be re-escalated to a maximum of 10 mg bid when the safety 
concern was resolved. The permitted daily dose range for RUX was 5 mg to 10 mg bid. 
In the BAT arm, dose adjustment was based on manufacturer’s instructions, labeling, patient’s medical 
condition, and institutional guidelines. 
Treatment duration and tapering 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 33/177 
 
 
 
 
All eligible patients randomised to study treatment were planned to receive treatment from the day of 
randomisation up to approximately 24 weeks (6 months), or up to approximately 2 years from 
randomisation, in case the end of RUX taper is delayed due to an aGvHD flare or other safety concerns 
or the patient met any discontinuation criteria, whichever was earlier. 
Tapering of immunosuppression therapy in responding patients was performed in two steps: 
1.  Taper of corticosteroids: initiated not earlier than Day 7 and performed per institutional 
guidelines 
2.  Taper of CNI and/or RUX once the patient stopped corticosteroids as follows: CNI taper was 
performed as per institutional guidelines. RUX taper was initiated after Day 56, and performed 
based on condition of the patient, current dosing regimen and clinical judgement of the 
investigator.  
The taper of corticosteroids, CNI, and RUX had to be completed by Week 96. 
Special guidelines for cessation or interruption of immunosuppression, in case of an aGvHD flare, were 
in place. 
The variety of therapies in the control arm is acceptable, as a result of differences in national and local 
guidelines. The most commonly used BAT treatment was ECP. Approximately 20% were treated with 
more than 1 concomitant BAT treatment.  
Initial BAT treatment C2301, REACH 2  
Patients continued to receive systemic corticosteroids with or without continued CNI with or without 
other systemic treatment for aGvHD per standard of care by the Investigator during the Screening 
period. Systemic medications for aGvHD other than corticosteroids +/- CNI could be continued after 
randomization only if used for aGvHD prophylaxis (i.e. started before the diagnosis of aGvHD) 
The continued treatment with systemic corticosteroids with or without continued CNI with or without 
other systemic treatment, after randomisation, is according to standard procedure, and RUX or BAT 
treatment is considered an add on treatment at randomisation.  
Concomitant treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 34/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Supportive treatments per institutional guidelines for management of alloSCT patients with SR-aGvHD 
were allowed, including systemic corticosteroids, CNI (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), and topical 
corticosteroid therapy, however, close monitoring of potential drug-drug interactions effects was 
recommended. Furthermore, antibiotics, anti-infectives, and immunizations could be used as 
prophylactic therapies for infections. Dose adjustments of ruxolitinib might be required particularly in 
patients treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors due to potential 
for drug-drug interactions leading to under- or over-exposure.  
In line with the MF and PV indications, a 50% dose reduction should be considered in patients with 
GvHD when co-administered with dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes. The concomitant 
use of ruxolitinib with fluconazole doses of greater than 200 mg daily was to be avoided. Due to the 
high risk of bleeding in alloSCT patients with SR-aGvHD, aspirin, NSAIDs, and related medications that 
would expectedly reduce platelet function and/or heparin, warfarin or related medication that would 
adversely affect blood coagulation, were prohibited. 
A new immunosuppressive agent could be added to RUX or BAT treatment regimen if the patient met 
the criteria for disease progression, no response, or mixed response, or aGvHD flare failure; this was, 
then, considered treatment failure. 
Objectives 
The primary and key secondary objectives were analysed when all patients completed Day 56 or 
discontinued from study participation earlier with a cut-off date of 25-Jul-2019 and the results were 
presented in the Primary analysis CSR. The second analysis with a cut-off date of 06-Jan-2020 includes 
data when all patients have completed approximately 6 months of treatment or discontinued from 
study participation earlier. 
The Primary analysis included the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint (cut-off date of 25-
Jul-2019) 
Primary objective was to compare the efficacy of ruxolitinib vs. Best Available Therapy (BAT) in 
patients with Grade II-IV SR-aGvHD assessed by Overall Response Rate (ORR) at Day 28. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 35/177 
 
 
 
The key secondary objective was to compare the rate of durable ORR (proportion of all patients in each 
arm who achieved a CR or PR at Day 28 and maintained a CR or PR at Day 56) between RUX and BAT. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Summary of efficacy endpoints Study C2301, 271 and D2301 
Efficacy analysis/ Criteria for evaluation 
Acute GvHD assessment: Acute GvHD grading was performed by the investigator at every visit 
during the treatment period and at EOT visit. aGvHD was graded using standard staging criteria for 
aGvHD (Harris et al 2016): measures of body surface area aGvHD skin rash, stool volumes or 
frequency per 24 h time period, and serum bilirubin levels, staging by organ (skin; liver; upper gastro-
intestinal; lower gastro-intestinal) and overall grading at the time of the evaluation. In addition, biopsy 
of the organ involved could be performed per institutional practices at Investigator’s discretion for 
aGvHD management. Once randomized, response to study treatment was assessed by the Investigator 
at every visit during the Treatment Period according to study protocol definition. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 36/177 
 
 
 
 
CR: defined as a score of 0 for the aGvHD grading in all evaluable organs that indicates complete 
resolution of all signs and symptoms of aGvHD in all evaluable organs without administration of 
additional systemic therapies for any earlier progression, mixed response or non-response of aGvHD. 
PR: defined as improvement of 1 stage in 1 or more organs involved with aGvHD signs or symptoms 
without progression in other organs or sites without administration of additional systemic therapies for 
an earlier progression, mixed response or non-response of aGvHD. 
Lack of response was defined as no response, mixed response, or progression. 
No response: defined as absence of improvement in any organ involved by aGvHD, without 
worsening in any involved organ. 
Mixed response: defined as improvement of at least 1 stage in the severity of aGvHD in at least one 
organ accompanied by progression in another organ or development of signs or symptoms of aGvHD in 
a new organ. 
Progression: defined as worsening in 1 or more organs by 1 or more stages without improvement in 
any involved organ. 
Patients were also monitored for occurrence of aGvHD flares occurring during steroid, CNI, and 
ruxolitinib taper. Additional aGvHD assessment could be performed as per institutional guidelines at 
investigator's discretion. 
Chronic GvHD assessment: Occurrence of definitive and possible manifestations of cGvHD was 
assessed monthly from Day 1 to Day 56 and at every visit thereafter during the treatment period, at 
the time of last dose if before Week 24, in responding patients, and at EOT (or Crossover EOT). After 
EOT (or Crossover EOT), patients were assessed for occurrence of cGvHD at the Safety Follow-up visit 
if applicable, and at Month 6, at Month 9, at Month 12, at Month 18 and at Month 24 during the Long-
Term Follow-up period. Occurrence of cGvHD was not considered an adverse event (AE). cGvHD was 
graded as per NIH consensus guidelines for cGvHD, as mild, moderate, or severe at the time of cGvHD 
diagnosis. Note: Clinical presentation resembling de novo chronic GvHD or GvHD overlap syndrome 
with both acute and chronic GvHD features were exclusion criteria, however a mixed picture can occur 
after randomization. 
Graft failure monitoring: Patients were monitored for any evidence of secondary graft failure at each 
visit from Day 1 during the Treatment, at the time of last dose if before Week 24, in responding 
patients, at EOT (or Crossover EOT), Safety Follow-up if applicable, and Long- Term Follow-up periods. 
Occurrence of graft failure was reported as an event and also as an AE. Graft failure was defined as 
initial whole blood or marrow donor chimerism >5% declining to <5% on subsequent measurements. 
Donor chimerism was closely monitored to detect graft failure. 
Chimerism: Donor chimerism after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant involves identifying the 
genetic profiles of the recipient and of the donor pre-transplant, and then evaluating the ratio of donor 
to recipient cells in the recipient's blood, or bone marrow. Chimerism testing using peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells or bone marrow (or peripheral blood selected CD3+ T cells) was performed during 
screening (prior to study treatment start), at Day 28 and at Day 56. In addition, for patients who 
Crossover from BAT to ruxolitinib, chimerism was also performed at Crossover Week 1. Additional 
chimerism testing could be performed at any time during study (Treatment and Long-Term Follow-up 
period) at the treating Investigator's discretion according to local institutional practice as indicated. 
Hematologic disease relapse/progression assessment: Patients were monitored for any evidence 
of underlying hematologic disease relapse or progression during the study. Patients were assessed at 
each visit from Day 1 during the Treatment period, including during crossover period if applicable, at 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022

the time of last dose if before Week 24, in responding patients, at EOT (or Crossover EOT), Safety 
Follow-Up if applicable, and the Long-Term follow-up period. 
- 
The relapse and progression of the underlying hematologic disease were assessed by the 
Investigator as per the definitions outlined in protocol. Evaluation and/or evidence of 
malignancy relapse/progression was conducted according to local institutional practices. Per 
protocol, study treatment was discontinued underlying hematological disease progression or 
relapse. 
Safety: Safety was monitored by assessing physical examination, vital signs, height and weight, and 
laboratory assessments including urinalysis, assessment of pregnancy and fertility, clinical chemistry 
and hematology. Adverse event data was collected at every visit. 
Special safety assessments included: 
- 
Pulmonary function test (PFT), if indicated clinically at investigator's discretion per local 
practices. 
-  Bleeding, due to the potential complications of thrombocytopenia and/or coagulopathy in the 
setting of alloSCT. 
- 
Infection monitoring identified as a risk associated with ruxolitinib and BAT for aGvHD therapy. 
-  Viral reactivation monitoring for hepatitis B and C (HBV viral DNA-PCR and HCV RNA-PCR), 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV viral DNA quantification), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV viral load), Human 
Herpes virus (HHV-6 viral load). 
-  Second primary malignancy monitoring defined as any new malignancy other than the 
underlying hematologic disease. 
Pharmacokinetics: Blood sampling for PK of ruxolitinib was performed in all patients enrolled in the 
study and treated with ruxolitinib to characterize the PK parameters in aGvHD patients. 
Extensive PK sampling schedule: “Extensive PK” sampling schedule was followed for approximately 
the first twenty-five (25) adult patients and all adolescent patients enrolled. The ‘Extensive PK’ 
sampling scheme includes a pre-dose and seven (7) post-dose samples on Day 1 and Day 7 thereafter, 
two (2) samples (1 pre-dose and 1 post-dose) per scheduled visit. 
Sparse PK sampling schedule: Adult patients randomized to ruxolitinib after the Extensive PK 
samples were collected, and any patients crossing over from BAT to ruxolitinib after Day 28, would 
follow the “Sparse PK” sampling schedule and had a total of two (2) samples (1 pre-dose and 1 post-
dose) per scheduled visit. The plasma samples from all patients were assayed for ruxolitinib 
concentrations using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method.  
Resource Utilization was captured for use in post-study Health Economics analysis. 
Patient-reported outcomes: In order to measure Quality-of-Life (QoL) among aGVHD patients, and 
potential changes over time, two patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments were administered: 
FACT-BMT and EQ-5D-5L. FACT-BMT is a 50-item self-report questionnaire that measures in adult 
patients only, the effect of a therapy on domains including physical, functional, social/family, and 
emotional wellbeing, together with additional concerns relevant for bone marrow transplantation 
patients. EQ-5D-5L descriptive classification consists of five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, anxiety/depression, and pain/discomfort (Brooks 1996). Each dimension of health has 
five levels of severity (Herdman et al 2011). 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 38/177 
 
 
 
These PRO instruments were planned to be administered on randomization day and every week during 
the first 2 months, and every 4 weeks thereafter until the end of treatment (EOT).  
PRO instruments were not used for adolescents. 
Sample size 
A study with a total of 308 patients and 1:1 randomization (ruxolitinib vs. BAT) stratified on aGvHD 
grade (Grade II vs. Grade III vs. Grade IV) would have 90% power to test for the primary endpoint 
(ORR at Day 28) and approximately 90% power to test for the key secondary endpoint (durable ORR 
at Day 56). The family wise α-level would be controlled at 0.025 overall for the two comparisons. 
Specifically, this study would claim to have achieved the efficacy objective when the primary endpoint 
ORR at Day 28 shows a significant treatment effect at one-sided α = 0.025. Conditional on significance 
of the primary endpoint, the key secondary endpoint durable ORR at Day 56 would be tested at one-
sided α = 0.025. 
The sample size calculation was based on the primary variable ORR at Day 28. Based on Martin P. et al 
BBMT 2013, the ORR at Day 28 in the BAT arm was expected to be 58%. The stratum specific rates 
(Grade II 69%, Grade III 59%, Grade IV 50%) were obtained assuming that the ratio of aGvHD Grade 
II: III: IV is 0.2:0.4:0.4. It was expected that treatment with ruxolitinib would result in an 18% 
increase in the ORR, i.e., an expected odds ratio of 2.25 (which corresponds to an increase in ORR to 
75%). Power for the CMH test, stratifying on aGvHD grade, was calculated using software package 
East V6. In order to ensure 90% power a total sample size of 308 patients is needed. With a sample 
size of 154 patients in each treatment arm, an observed odds ratio greater than or equal to 1.63 would 
achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint. Assuming that the observed response rates in 
Grades II/III/IV in BAT arm are 69%/59%/50% (overall 57%), observed response rates ≥ 
78%/70%/62% (overall 68%) in the ruxolitinib arm would achieve statistical significance. 
Based on [Van Groningen 2016], the durable ORR at Day 56 in the BAT arm was expected to be 
approximately 35%. It is expected that treatment with ruxolitinib would result in a 20% increase in the 
ORR, i.e., an expected odds ratio of 2.25 (which corresponds to an increase in durable ORR to 55%). 
With these assumptions and sample size of 308 patients, the power for the key secondary endpoint is 
at least 90%. With sample size 154 patients in each treatment arm, an observed odds ratio greater 
than or equal to 1.59 for durable ORR at Day 56 would achieve statistical significance. Assuming that 
the observed durable response rates in Grades II/III/IV in BAT arm are 45%/36%/30% (overall 35%), 
observed durable response rates ≥ 57%/47%/41% (overall 47%) in the ruxolitinib arm would achieve 
statistical significance. 
Randomisation 
A stratified 1:1 randomisation was conducted, and patients received either ruxolitinib or BAT. They 
were stratified by aGvHD grade (Grade II vs. III vs. IV). Before randomization, BAT was selected by 
the Investigator.  
Blinding (masking) 
As these BATs vary from administered tablets to cellular therapy and photopheresis, the open label 
design of these studies was inevitable. This has been acknowledged by the CHMP at the time of the 
Scientific Advice sought in 2016 for cGvHD (CHMP Scientific Advice). The open label strategy is, 
therefore, acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022

The BAT treatment was allocated before randomization took place, i.e., the treatment/s which would 
be standard treatment/s at the specific site. 
Treatment phases/study conduct 
Screening period 
Definition of steroid refractory aGvHD: 
During the screening period, patients were monitored for a diagnosis of Steroid-refractory aGvHD, 
which was defined as patients who had high-dose systemic corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 2 
mg/kg/day [or equivalent prednisone dose 2.5 mg/kg/day]), given alone or combined with CNI, who 
either: 
OR 
OR 
OR 
a)  Progressed based on organ assessment after at least 3 days compared to organ stage 
at the time of initiation of high-dose systemic corticosteroid +/- CNI for the treatment 
of Grade II-IV aGvHD, 
b)  Failed to achieve at a minimum a partial response based on organ assessment after 7 
days compared to organ stage at the time of initiation of high-dose systemic 
corticosteroid +/- CNI for the treatment of Grade II-IV aGvHD,  
c)  Failed corticosteroid taper defined as fulfilling either one of the following criteria: 
•  Requirement for an increase in the corticosteroid dose to methylprednisolone ≥ 2 
mg/kg/day (or equivalent prednisone dose ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day) 
• 
Failure to taper the methylprednisolone dose to <0.5 mg/kg/day (or equivalent 
prednisone dose <0.6 mg/kg/day) for a minimum 7 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 40/177 
 
 
 
 
 
The Screening Phase should not exceed 28 days. The period from suspicion of SR-aGvHD and urgent 
need of additional treatment is usually short and treatment delay is not desirable. 
Randomized treatment phase 
Duration of treatment: The End of Treatment (EOT) visit occurred when the patient completed the 
study treatment period or earlier if the patient met any of the criteria for discontinuation of study 
treatment. 
Patients’  treatment period was up to 6 months (Week 24). However, ruxolitinib taper could be delayed 
up to 2 years from randomization due to an aGvHD flare or other safety concerns. 
Patients meeting the primary endpoint at Day 28 will continue ruxolitinib at 10 mg BID until Day 56. 
Ruxolitinib will then be tapered in responding patients who have completed steroid taper starting Day 
56 to complete treatment by Week 24, while patients responding to BAT will be managed as per 
institutional practices. 
For patients not meeting the primary endpoint at Day 28: Patients who are randomized to ruxolitinib, 
will discontinue treatment and be treated per Investigator’s judgement.  
Crossover treatment phase 
Patients who are randomized to BAT, and who meet cross-over criteria after Day 28, may cross over to 
the ruxolitinib treatment arm and follow the same treatment duration and taper schedule as patients 
originally randomized to ruxolitinib treatment. 
Corticosteroids and CNI for aGvHD treatment are allowed to be continued, with cessation required of 
any other systemic immunosuppressive treatment prior to crossover. 
Cross-over to ruxolitinib during the Treatment Period for patients randomized to BAT was an option 
between Day 28 and Week 24 if they: 
Failed to meet the primary endpoint response definition (CR or PR) at Day 28 
Lost the response thereafter and met criteria for progression, mixed response, or no response, 
necessitating new additional systemic immunosuppressive treatment for aGvHD. 
OR 
• 
• 
AND 
•  Did not have signs/symptoms of chronic Graft vs. Host Disease (cGvHD) (overlap syndrome, 
progressive, or de novo cGvHD). Patients who crossed over to ruxolitinib were followed until 
completion of treatment with ruxolitinib and received the same treatment and tapering 
schedule as patients randomized to ruxolitinib treatment. 
Safety Follow-Up (last dose + 30 days) 
A 30-day Safety Follow-up visit was performed for all patients after the last dose of ruxolitinib 
(administered during Treatment Period or after Crossover) or BAT. 
Long-Term Follow-Up Period (From EOT to Month 24) 
As SR-aGvHD often leads to death within 2 years after the transplant, and assessment of long-term 
safety and durable efficacy is clinically relevant, all patients (responders and non-responders in both 
arms, regardless of when treatment was discontinued) would be followed up for long-term observation 
up to 24 months from randomization. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 41/177 
 
 
 
During this period, long-term data was collected: survival, any relapse/progression of the underlying 
hematologic disease for which the alloSCT procedure was performed, non-relapse mortality (NRM), any 
occurrence of graft failure, event-free survival (EFS), any occurrence of cGvHD, and occurrence of any 
second primary malignancies. Visits for these assessments occurred after EOT or Crossover EOT, at 6, 
9, 12, 18, and 24 months. 
Statistical methods  
Multiple analyses were performed:  
- 
The first analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints was performed with the cut-off 
date as 25-Jul-2019 after all patients have completed their Day 56 visit or have discontinued 
study. The results were summarized in the so called “primary” clinical study report (CSR).  
- 
Further analyses on secondary endpoints were performed when all patients have completed 6 
months treatment or discontinued from study participation earlier, using all data collected in 
the database up to the data cut-off at 06-Jan-2020.  
The final analysis will occur once all patients have completed the study (up to 24 months from 
randomization). All available data from all patients up to end of study will be reported in a final CSR. 
No formal interim efficacy analysis was planned in this study. 
Analysis sets 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprises all patients to whom study treatment has been assigned by 
randomization. According to the intent to treat principle, patients were analysed according to the 
treatment and strata they have been assigned to during the randomization procedure. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) consists of a subset of the patients in the FAS who are compliant with 
requirements of the clinical study protocol. The following list of protocol deviations lead to exclusion of 
the patient from the PPS: 
•  Not steroid refractory aGvHD  
•  More than one prior systemic therapy for the treatment of aGvHD other than corticosteroids 
+/- CNI (prophylaxis or treatment)  
•  Missing or incorrect aGvHD grade at randomization  
• 
Taking any prohibited medication as specified in the protocol after start of study treatment and 
before end of study treatment  
•  Study treatment received different from treatment arm assigned by randomization.  
The Safety Set includes all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Patients were 
analysed according to the study treatment received, where treatment received was defined as the 
randomized treatment if the patient took at least one dose of that treatment, or the first treatment 
received if the randomized treatment was never received during the randomized treatment period.  
The Crossover Analysis Set (CAS) comprises all patients randomized to and received BAT who then 
crossed over and received at least one dose of ruxolitinib. This analysis set was used for all analyses 
for crossover patients. 
Primary analysis 
The primary endpoint, ORR at Day 28, was defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR at Day 
28 according to standard criteria [Harris 2016]. Note that response is relative to the assessment of 
aGvHD at randomization. Lack of response is defined as no response, mixed response, or progression. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 42/177 
 
 
 
For definitions of these events, see section Outcomes/Endpoints. A patient was not considered a 
responder at Day 28 if any of the following events occurs: 
- Missing aGvHD assessment at baseline or Day 28 
- No CR or PR at Day 28 
- Additional systemic therapy for aGvHD prior to Day 28. 
The primary analysis was performed at the time when all patients have completed their Day 56 visit or 
discontinued earlier. The Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test, stratified by the 
randomization stratification factor (i.e., aGvHD Grade II vs III vs. IV), was used to compare ORR 
between the two treatment groups, at the one-sided 2.5% level of significance, using the analysis the 
FAS. The statistical hypotheses tested were: 
H0: ORRrux ≤ ORRBAT vs. H1: ORRrux > ORRBAT 
where ORRrux and ORRBAT are the overall response rates at Day 28 in the ruxolitinib and BAT group, 
respectively.  
One-sided p-value, odds ratio and 95% Wald confidence limits calculated from the stratified CMH test 
were presented. ORR was also summarized using descriptive statistics (N, %) by treatment arm along 
with two-sided exact binomial 95% CIs [Clopper and Pearson 1934].  
As a supportive analysis, the primary endpoint was analysed in the same way as in the primary 
analysis based on patients in PPS. A supportive analysis was also conducted using logistic regression 
model to estimate the treatment effect adjusting for key baseline and prognostic factors based on 
patients in FAS. The model included the followings covariates: age, gender, race, aGvHD grade, source 
of grafts, criteria for SR-aGvHD, prior aGvHD therapy in addition to treatment as one of the covariates.  
As a sensitivity analysis, the two treatment groups were compared using Fisher’s exact test. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint to examine the homogeneity of 
treatment effect. For each of the subgroups, the following statistics were presented: 
- Proportion of patients with ORR using descriptive statistics (N, %) along with two-sided exact 
binomial 95% CIs. 
- Odds ratio with 95% CI from a logistic regression model with treatment and stratification factors as 
covariates. 
Efficacy analyses in subgroups were purely exploratory and were intended to explore the consistency 
of treatment effect. No inferential statistics (p-values) were to be produced for the subgroups. 
ORR at Crossover Day 28 
ORR at Crossover Day 28 was defined as proportion of crossover patients with CR or PR at Crossover 
Day 28. Note that response is relative to the last assessment of aGvHD prior to or at the start date of 
crossover treatment (ruxolitinib). A patient was not considered a responder at Crossover Day 28 if any 
of the following events occurs: 
- Missing aGvHD assessment at Crossover baseline or Crossover Day 28 
- No CR or PR at Crossover Day 28 
- Additional systemic therapy for aGvHD prior to Crossover Day 28. 
ORR at Crossover Day 28 was summarized using descriptive statistics (N, %) along with two-sided 
exact binomial 95% CIs [Clopper and Pearson 1934] based on the CAS. 
Analysis of the key secondary endpoint 
The key secondary endpoint was Durable ORR at Day 56, an tested only if the primary endpoint was 
statistically significant. If a patient was a CR at Day 28 and a PR at Day 56, he/she was considered as 
Assessment report

a durable responder. A patient was not considered a durable responder at Day 56 if any of the 
following events occurs: 
- Not a responder at Day 28 
- Missing aGvHD assessment at Day 56 
- No CR or PR at Day 56. 
- Additional systemic therapy for aGvHD prior to Day 56. 
The patients randomized to BAT who met cross-over criteria and crossed-over to ruxolitinib were 
considered to have the additional systemic therapy for aGvHD and were not considered as a responder 
afterwards. Durable ORR at Day 56 was analyzed using the same method as in the primary analysis. 
Durable ORR at Crossover Day 56  
Durable ORR at Crossover Day 56 was defined as the proportion of all crossover patients who achieved 
a CR or PR at Crossover Day 28 and maintained a CR or PR at Crossover Day 56. Note that response is 
relative to the last assessment of aGvHD prior to or at the start date of crossover treatment 
(ruxolitinib). A patient was not considered a durable responder at Crossover Day 56 if any of the 
following events occurs: 
- Not a responder at Crossover Day 28 
- Missing aGvHD assessment at Crossover Day 56 
- No CR or PR at Crossover Day 56. 
- Additional systemic therapy for aGvHD prior to Crossover Day 56. 
Durable ORR at Crossover Day 56 was summarized using descriptive statistics (N, %) along with two-
sided exact binomial 95% CIs [Clopper and Pearson 1934] based on the CAS. 
Analyses of other secondary endpoints  
Other secondary endpoints were not part of the hierarchical testing. ORR at Day 14 and BOR were 
analysed only at the data cut-off date of 25-Jul-2019. The rest of the endpoints were re-analysed at 
the second analysis, i.e. when all patients have completed 6 months treatment or discontinued from 
study participation earlier (data cut-off date 06-Jan-2020). These secondary efficacy endpoint analyses 
were non-comparative in nature and analysed based on the FAS. 
Safety and PRO endpoints were analysed using descriptive statistics.  
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations 
Patients with missing assessments that prevent the evaluation of the primary endpoint were 
considered non-responders on that treatment arm. This includes missing aGvHD response assessments 
at baseline and Days 28 and 56. Duration of response was not censored based on a treatment 
discontinuation. No data imputation was to be applied. 
Multiplicity 
The primary and the key secondary endpoint were tested hierarchically. That is, if the ORR at Day 28 
was statistically significant, the durable ORR at Day 56 would be tested.  
The two endpoints were tested hierarchically controlling alpha at 2.5 % one-sided. As this is the only 
analysis of these two endpoints and included all patients, no further adjustment for multiplicity was 
required then the hierarchical procedure used.  
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 44/177 
 
 
 
A DMC has been added as a part of study protocol amendment 2, in order to limit potential bias in 
study conduct in the context of this ongoing open label trial. The DMC is responsible for assessing the 
safety data defined as SAEs/death and graft failures obtained in the study and ensuring that the event 
rates are balanced between the treatment arms.  
Changes from the planned analyses 
Compared to the protocol version 00 (dated 01-Sep-2016), ‘discontinuation from randomized 
treatment’ has been dropped as reason. Since some BATs have fixed duration which is less than 8 
weeks, to avoid bias, discontinuation from randomized treatment will not be used to disqualify the 
response or durable response. Also, duration of response was not censored based on a treatment 
discontinuation. 
According to the protocol version 00, patients who discontinued randomized treatment prior to or at 
Day 28 would be considered as ORR non-responders. Similar rule was to be applied for the durable 
ORR for the period prior to or at Day 56. 
There were very few substantial changes from the protocol specified analysis, and the analyses were 
actually performed in accordance to the original protocol (version 00). Handling of discontinuations 
from randomized treatment, which was identified as a change from the protocol specified analysis, is 
addressed in a separate question. It was noted that at the time of the second analysis (data cut-off 
date 06-Jan-2020), due to the data cleaning activities, one subject in each treatment arm has changed 
from a non-responder to responder at Day 28. Although there is no change to the odds ratio and the 
conclusion, it was of concern at what time-period the data cleaning was performed for the first (and 
second) analysis. Dates for the database locks, data cleaning period and SAP versions are provided for 
the two data cut-offs. 
According to the SAP, the one change to the analysis described in the original protocol was that 
treatment discontinuations would not be used to disqualify the response or durable response, which is 
not obvious to have been followed as all treatment discontinuations were treated as non-responders in 
the primary and the key secondary analysis. Among non-responders, the rates of early 
discontinuations appear to be well-balanced between the treatment groups, but together with death 
and missing visits, this may add to the uncertainty in the estimated outcome.  
Of note, for the interpretation of the phase III study results, the convention is to use 2-sided tests and 
p-values. For that reason, 2-sided p-values are included in the SmPC. 
Protocol amendments 
There were 2 protocol amendments. The key features of each amendment are presented below:  
Amendment 1 (31- May-2017): The main purpose of Amend 1 was to clarify the exclusion criterion #5 
and other eligibility criteria to follow standard medical practice. At the time of randomization, the 
investigator assessed if the patient presented with a viral infection or not based on his/her medical 
judgement and without waiting for viral load test results for CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HBV, HCV performed at 
screening in order not to delay the initiation of aGvHD treatment in this life-threatening condition.  
Amendment 2 (21- Jun-2018): The main purpose of the amendment was to allow for more flexibility in 
the tapering of corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and ruxolitinib; and if needed, for this taper 
to be completed safely beyond Week 24. This change included clarification that institutional guidelines 
for the tapering of corticosteroids and CNI could be followed. Additionally, the physician could tailor the 
tapering strategy to each patient’s condition, including stopping ruxolitinib more slowly in case of an 
acute Graft vs. Host Disease (aGvHD) flare or other safety concerns which may prevent the taper from 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 45/177 
 
 
 
being completed by Week 24. Patients, who met the protocol criteria for treatment discontinuation 
were not eligible to continue receiving ruxolitinib within the study but were given the possibility to 
continue/receive ruxolitinib outside the study (provided they met specified criteria), would not enter 
the Long-Term Follow-Up period. -Alignment with medical practices in managing adolescent patients, 
other systemic medications for aGvHD prophylaxis in addition to CNI could be maintained after 
randomization for all patients. To be allowed, these additional prophylactic medications start date must 
precede the diagnosis date of aGvHD. This change is anticipated to primarily improve adolescent 
enrolment but its impact on overall patient homogeneity is limited. -Simplifying the PK sampling. -
Alignment of the secondary endpoint BOR to aGVDH publications. A DMC was added to address the 
Study Steering Committee’s request to be informed on the balance of safety events between treatment 
arms. The DMC was added to maintain the Study Steering Committee blinding during their review of 
pooled safety data, in order to preserve the integrity of the trial. 
CSR amendment 
In addition to protocol amendments above, the Clinical Study Report was amended 12-Aug-2020 due 
to the following reasons 
-  Correction of the cumulative corticosteroids dosing results in the primary analysis CSR because 
the doses of methylprednisolone were not converted to equivalent prednisone doses. The 
conversion factor (1.25 to convert methylprednisolone dose in prednisone) was mistakenly 
omitted in the programming data specification document (PDS) and statistical analysis plan 
(SAP), which now has been added. Correction and update of the biochemistry results 
- 
Furthermore, Correction and update of the lipase biochemistry results has been added and a 
conversion issue was detected for creatinine, magnesium and phosphate where few cases were 
reported as CTCAE grade 1 instead of grade 0. Some laboratory listings have been reformatted 
for more clarity and a clarification was added as a footnote in the outputs to a category of a 
protocol deviation related to the screening informed consent in order to align with its definition 
in the study specification documents.  
The protocol amendments 1 and 2 are not expected to interfere with the integrity of the study. It is not 
expected that the amendments of the CSR, with regard to the recalculation of corticosteroids and 
biochemistry data, will affect the interpretation of data.

Results 
Recruitment 
Participant flow 
A high rate of screen failures was seen, 310 out of a total of 620 aGvHD screened patients (50%) did 
not complete screening. A majority of these were screen failures, with the primary reason for not

meeting eligibility criteria was that patients did not become steroid refractory (42.9%) according to 
study criteria.  
Due to the low acceptance of a lag period in these patients from the time of SR-aGvHD has occurred 
until treatment should start, screening activities and assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria 
began once the patient was diagnosed with aGvHD, i.e., before a possible conversion to SR-aGvHD. 
Out of the 309 patients included in the FAS, 154 were in the ruxolitinib arm (including 5 adolescent 
patients) and 155 in the BAT arm (including 4 adolescent patients).  
Any occurrence of SR-aGvHD was monitored closely.  
Disposition of patients 
Study treatment was discontinued due to following reasons: Lack of efficacy of aGvHD treatment, i.e. 
not achieving PR or CR at Day 28 or Crossover Day 28 and/or requiring additional systemic therapy for 
aGvHD, at any time; development of signs or symptoms of cGvHD including de novo, overlap, or 
progressive onset; underlying haematological disease progression or relapse; evidence of graft failure 
necessitating rapid taper of immunosuppression, administration of non-scheduled DLI, stem cell boost, 
chemotherapy, or other treatment that would expectedly affect aGvHD; adverse events leading to 
study treatment discontinuation. 
A majority of patients discontinued from the randomized treatment phase (24 weeks) in both arms. 
The median duration of exposure to RUX treatment and BAT treatment were 63 days (6.0 – 463.0 
days) and 29 days (1.0 - 188.0 days) respectively.

The study had three phases: Randomization treatment phase (n=309), crossover treatment phase 
(n=49) and long-term follow-up phase into which 87 patients entered (56.5%) in the RUX arm and 45 
(29.0%) patients in the BAT arm. In addition, 24 patients from the cross-over phase entered the long-
term follow-up phase.  
In the randomization treatment phase, thirty-five (22.7%) patients completed the treatment period in 
the RUX arm compared to 21 (13.5%) in the BAT arm. A total of 116 (75.3%) patients in RUX arm and 
134 (86.5%) patients in BAT arm discontinued during the randomized treatment period and the most 
common reasons for discontinuation were lack of efficacy (20.8% in ruxolitinib arm vs. 44.5% in BAT 
arm), death (16.2% in ruxolitinib arm vs. 13.5% in BAT arm) and AEs (17.5% in ruxolitinib arm vs. 
3.9% in BAT arm). Among the 14 patients (6 in ruxolitinib arm and 8 in BAT arm) who discontinued 
due to physician decision, one patient in ruxolitinib arm and two patients in BAT arm were reported to 
be responders. In the RUX arm, 62.3% entered the long-term follow up phase compared to 32.9% in 
the BAT arm. 
Due to the option for patients in the BAT arm to switch to a second BAT within the first 28 days (i.e., 
the timepoint for the analysis of the primary endpoint and also the option for BAT patients to crossover 
to RUX treatment), without discontinuing from the main treatment period, indicate no difference 
between treatment arms until this timepoint but a quick drop, for the BAT arm, was thereafter seen.  
The K-M plot over treatment discontinuations indicate similar and rather quick drop out in both 
treatment arms already from the study start, and a sharp drop in the BAT arm after day 28.  
The most frequent reasons for discontinuations during the first 28 days were lack of efficacy, death, 
and adverse events in ruxolitinib arm (13, 12 and 7 patients, respectively), and lack of efficacy and 
death in the BAT arm (26 and 9 patients, respectively). The sharp drop after day 28 was not surprising 
since per study design patients were expected to remain in the initial treatment at least until Day 28.

No patients discontinued due to protocol deviations. 
Cross over patients 
Forty-nine patients (31.6%) discontinued BAT and crossed over to RUX treatment of whom 55.1% 
entered the long-term follow-up phase. The median time to cross-over was 34 days (range 28.0-
162.0). At the secondary analysis data cut-off, 36 (73.5%) of patients discontinued the cross-over 
treatment period. The most common reason for discontinuation were AEs (24.5%), death (16.3%) and 
lack of efficacy (12.2%).

Conduct of the study  
Protocol deviations
The high rate of protocol deviations did, overall, not differ between the 2 study arms. The most 
common deviation belonged to the category “Other deviations” (61.7% and 65.2%) which included: 
Different aGvHD overall grades used for randomization between e-CRF and IRT; missing two 
consecutive monthly scheduled viral load testing; missing aGvHD assessment at day 28 or day 56; 
organ Staging assessment done per investigator criteria/judgement rather than MAGIC criteria (Harris 
et al); response assessment done per investigator criteria/judgement rather than protocol definition; 
protocol amendment 2 implemented before patient's re-consent obtained. “Prohibited drugs” were 
taken by 19.1% patients (20.1% in ruxolitinib arm and 18.1% in BAT arm). Deviations in these 
categories were the most common reasons for exclusion of patients from the PPS (see below).  
With the exception of protocol deviation ‘organ staging assessment done per investigator 
criteria/judgement rather Harris’ (18.8% with RUX vs. 34.2% with BAT), no imbalances in

subcategories of ‘other deviations’ have been observed. It is acknowledged that above-described 
exception was reported with similar rates at key time points (baseline, Day 28 and Day 56).

Baseline demographics were well-balanced between the two treatment arms  
In the general population that had undergone allo-transplantation, the incidence of Grade II-IV aGvHD 
in adolescent patients aged 12-18 years approximates 5% of that observed in adults >18 years (data 
Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research [CIBMTR] data – unpublished data). In 
the present study, the proportion of adolescents was 2.9%.  
Few patients had other than underlying malignant disease (0.6% and 3.2%). The predominant 
malignant diagnoses (AML, ALL, MDS) were generally balanced between the treatment arms. In 
addition, the CIBMTR risk categories (a validated tool to categorize groups of patients undergoing 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation, intended for research purposes to stratify patients in broad 
disease risk categories for retrospective or prospective studies), were also balanced between the 
treatment arms. 
Furthermore, the majority of conditioning regiments were myeloablative, however, a slight imbalance 
was noted, 55.2% of subjects in the RUX arm received myelo-ablative conditioning prior to transplant 
compared to 41.9% in the BAT arm. Consequently, fewer patients in ruxolitinib arm received the less 
intense forms of conditioning therapy (non-myelo-ablative: 20.1% and reduced intensity: 24.7%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022

compared to BAT arm (non-myelo-ablative: 26.5% and reduced intensity: 31.6%). T-cell depletion 
was performed in 39 patients overall.  
The transplant donor median age was 35 years, and the majority were male (balance between arms). 
The HLA match score was 10/0 or 9/10 in most cases.  
Most patients (75.3%) entered the study with low hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)- 
comorbidity scores (between 0 and 2).

The median time to conversion from grade 2 to 4 aGvHD to SR-aGvHD was 10 days (range: 1.0 to 
331.0 days).  The median time, from aGvHD grad ≥2 diagnosis and randomization was 14 days.  The 
median time from diagnosis of SR-aGvHD to randomization was 1 day. 
The number of patients randomized at baseline with grade II, III, and IV aGvHD was 104 (33.7%), 
136 (44.0%), and 62 (20.1%), respectively. 
Prior aGvHD therapy was steroids + Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) in 50.0% in RUX arm and 49.0% in BAT 
arm. Second most common prior aGvHD treatment was steroids as aGvHD prophylaxis.  
Prophylactic aGvHD treatments (systemic and/or locally active) were balanced between the two 
treatment arms. The most commonly used prior treatment for a GvHD was a combination of steroids 
and CNI and the most common reason for SR-aGvHD was failure to achieve a response after 7 days of 
treatment with steroids (46.8% in ruxolitinib arm and 40.6% in BAT arm).  
Current medical conditions were (except for medical history consistent with study indication) mostly 
related to post allo-HSCT and symptoms of aGvHD and/or use of high-dose steroid complications. Most 
conditions were reported in, more or less, the same frequency in both study arms.  However, CMV 
infections were reported more frequently among patients randomized to RUX arm than to BAT arm 
(CMV infection 23.4% vs 18.1%, CMV colitis 1.9% vs 0; CMV enteritis 1.3% vs 0.6%; and CMV viremia 
1.3% vs 0). In addition, CMV test positive was reported in medical history for 3.9% in ruxolitinib arm 
and 9.7% in BAT arm. 
The most common organs involved were skin (54.0%) and lower GI tract (68.3%). More patients in 
the RUX arm had symptoms of skin (60.4%) and liver (23.4%), than BAT arm (skin: 47.7% and liver: 
16.8%). Upper GI symptoms and lower GI symptoms were less frequent in RUX arm (18.2% and 
62.3%) than in BAT arm (23.9% and 74.2%). 
Concomitant therapies 
From randomization up to the data cut-off date, concomitant medications were taken by 98.7% and 
100% patients in ruxolitinib and BAT arm, respectively. The overall profile of concomitant medications 
was, overall, similar between the two treatment arms. In addition to corticosteroids and CNIs, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 56/177 
 
 
 
 
 
frequent concomitant medications also included agents for treatment of infections, gastric motility 
enhancers and electrolytes. 
Up to the data cut-off, more patients in the BAT arm (53.5%) received additional systemic aGvHD 
treatments than ruxolitinib arm (22.1%) during the treatment period. The most frequent additional 
systemic aGvHD treatment in BAT arm was ruxolitinib (39.4%) where most patients were crossing 
over, and etanercept (6.5%). No single additional systemic aGvHD treatment was given to >10% 
patients in the ruxolitinib arm. The most common by PT in ruxolitinib arm was ECP (5.8%). 
Prohibited medications 
Prohibited medication was taken by 29 (19.1%) and 21 (14.0%) of subjects (at least one medication 
or non-drug therapy in the RUX arm and the BAT arm, respectively. 
Transfusions 
A total of 79.6% patients in ruxolitinib arm and 80.0% patients in BAT arm underwent transfusion 
after start of randomized study treatment, the most common being packed red blood cells (RBC). 
Furthermore, 87.8% of the patients underwent transfusion in the Crossover period. 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses used the Full Analysis Set (FAS), following the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) principle, 
comprising all patients to whom study treatment has been assigned by randomisation. All 309 
randomised patients (except one patient who was randomised but did not sign the study consent) were 
included in the FAS: n=154 in the RUX arm and n=155 in the BAT arm. 
Supportive analyses were performed using the Per Protocol Set comprised of patients compliant with 
the requirements of the study. Fifty-six (36.4%) patients in the RUX arm and 68 (43.9%) patients in 
the BAT arm were excluded from the PPS, mainly due to intake of prohibited medications (20.1% and 
18.1%) and due to different aGvHD overall grades used for randomisation between CRF and IRT 
(18.2% and 17.4%). 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary analysis comprised of analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoint and was 
performed in all patients who completed Day 56 or who discontinued from study participation earlier 
and had a cut-off date of 25-Jul-2019. Most endpoints were either updated at time of the second 
analysis or analysed only at the second analysis 17-Jan-2020. 
Primary efficacy results 
The primary endpoint, ORR at Day 28, assessed by local investigator (INV) using protocol advised 
criteria (according to Harris et al), was met (see table). 
According to the SAP, a patient was not be considered a responder at Day 28 if any of the following 
events occurs; in case of missing aGvHD assessment at baseline or Day 28, no CR or PR at Day 28 or 
in case there was use of Additional systemic therapy for aGvHD prior to Day 28. It has been clarified 
that missing data in the primary analysis are presented in category ‘unknown’, while the category 
‘missing visits’ actually refers to invalid aGvHD assessments at Day 28.

Overall response rate at Day 28 (FAS) by INV (primary analysis) 
The number of patients who received a new systemic treatment for aGvHD prior to Day 28 was 10 
(6.5%) in the ruxolitinib arm and 39 (25.2%) in the BAT arm. The requested sensitivity analysis used 
actual response instead of imputed non-response, for patients who received a new systemic treatment 
for aGvHD prior to Day 28. The number of responders in this sensitivity analysis was higher in the 
ruxolitinib arm (98 patients; 63.6%) compared to the BAT arm (69 patients; 44.5%); the difference 
was statistically significant (p=0.0005) with an odds ratio of 2.22 (95% CI: 1.40, 3.53), i.e., 
supportive for the primary endpoint result. 
No response or progression were seen in 4,5% and 2,6% in the RUX arm and 6,5% and 8,4% in the 
BAT arm, respectively. 
Unknow responses were 23,4% and 30,3% in the RUX arm and BAT arm respectively, in this category 
deaths accounted for 9,7% and 14,2%, early discontinuations for 11,0% and 10,3% and missing visits 
for 2,6% and 5,8% in respective RUX and BAT arm. With respect to the imbalance in numbers 
between the two arms, it is apparently more non-response imputations in the BAT arm than in the 
ruxolitinib arm, but further analyses were not specifically requested. 
Subgroup analyses 
Efficacy showed that the subgroup analyses (Day 28) were overall consistent with results for the 
primary endpoint, as demonstrated by the odds ratio (at Day 28) ranging from 1.55 to 12.28 in 
subgroups with evaluable data. Results favouring the BAT arm was only seen for patients >65 years, 
patients with unknown race and patients who received prior “steroid+CNI+Other” systemic aGvHD 
treatment. The results in these subgroups cannot, however, be definitively concluded due to the wide 
confidence intervals and limited sample size and wide confidence intervals.  
The subgroup analysis demonstrated an advantage for the RUX arm compared to the BAT arm with an 
odds ratio (RUX/BAT) for ORR of 2.96 (Grade 2), 2.15 (Grade 3) and 3.76 (Grade 4), respectively.

Subgroup adolescents (12-18 years) 
The odds ratio in adolescent patients were inconclusive due to low number of evaluable patients 
(N=9). 
A sensitivity analysis was performed using Fisher’s exact test to compare ORR at Day 28 between the 
two treatment groups. The result was supportive of the primary analysis (odds ratio 2.55, with 95% CI 
(1.61, 4.03); p-value <0.0001) in favour of the RUX arm.  
Supportive analysis for ORR at Day 28 (PPS population) 
ORR in the PPS population  showed similar results compared to the ORR rate in the FAS population 
(63.9% in the RUX arm vs 39.1% in the BAT arm in the PPS population and 62,3% in the RUX arm vs 
39.4% in the BAT arm in the FAS population), indicating robustness of the results.

Shift in aGvHD by organ staging from baseline to Day 28  
The trend of improvements favors the RUX arm in all assessed organs, although some baseline 
imbalances were detected, more patients in the RUX arm had acute GvHD involving skin (60.4%) and 
liver (23.4%), compared to the BAT arm (skin: 47.7% and liver: 16.1%). Organ staging data was 
missing for 23.4% patients in the ruxolitinib arm and 30.3% patients in BAT arm at Day 28, due to 
missing visits, discontinuation, or death.

Among the 49 patients who crossed over to RUX treatment between Day 28 and Week 24, the ORR at 
Crossover Day 28 was consistent with the primary analysis in the RUX arm: 67.3% (95% CI: 52.5, 
80.1). The CR rate was higher compared with the primary analysis: 46.9%. 
Secondary efficacy results 
Durable ORR at Day 56 (key secondary endpoint) 
Duration of response (DOR) is assessed for responders only and is defined as the time from first 
response until aGvHD progression or the date of additional systemic therapies for aGvHD. Onset of 
chronic GvHD, or death without prior observation of aGvHD progression were considered as competing 
risks. 
Since the primary endpoint, ORR Day 28 was statistically significant at the primary analysis, the key 
secondary endpoint was also tested for significance at the primary analysis. 
The drop in Durable ORR at day 56 compared to ORR Day 28 indicates that almost half of the 
responses, in both treatment arms, at Day 28 are no longer recorded at Day 56.

Durable overall response rate at Crossover Day 56 (Crossover Analysis Set) (Second 
analysis) 
Durable ORR at Crossover Day 56 was also tested for the crossover analysis set (the proportion of all 
crossover patients who achieved a CR or PR at Crossover Day 28 and maintained a CR or PR at 
Crossover Day 56). Among the 49 patients who crossed over, the durable ORR at Crossover Day 56

was 42.9% (95% CI: 28.8, 57.8). Thirty-six (73.5%) of these patients discontinued the cross-over 
treatment period with the most frequent reason for discontinuation being AEs (24.5%).  
The durable ORR at Day 56 (FAS) during the randomized phase was consistent with the durable ORR 
for Crossover Day 56.

Overall response rate at Day 14  
The ORR at Day 14 at the Primary analysis data cut-off was higher in RUX arm (63.0%; 95% CI: 54.8, 
70.6) compared to BAT (47.1%; 95% CI: 39.0, 55.3; p<0.0029) with the OR for response in RUX arm 
compared to BAT arm being 1.98 and 95% CI: 1.24, 3.17. 
Best overall response by Day 28  
The BOR up to Day 28 at the Primary analysis data cut-off was higher in the RUX arm (81.8%) than in 
the BAT arm (60.6%; p<0.0001) with the odds ratio 3.07 and 95% CI: 1.80, 5.25 in favour of RUX.  
The response rates at Day 14, 63% in the RUX arm and 39% in the BAT, compared to ORR Day 28 
arm, 62.3% in the RUX arm and 39.4% indicate that the responses occur at an early timepoint after 
start of treatment. However, the BOR up to Day 28, 81.8% in the RUX arm and 60.6% in the BAT arm, 
also indicate that 19.5% and 21.2% of responses achieved up to Day 28, are no longer recorded. 
These “lost responses” are accounted for below, please refer to endpoint DoR and competing risks.

compared to the BAT arm (101 days, range: 10.0 to 456.0).

The probability of an event (progression or addition of systemic therapy for aGvHD) and 95% CIs at all 
estimated timepoints months, was lower in ruxolitinib arm compared to the BAT arm. 
Overall survival  
At the primary analysis, an interim OS analysis was performed with 72 (46.8%) deaths in the 
ruxolitinib arm and 79 (51.0%) deaths in the BAT arm. At the second analysis, there were 82 (53.2%) 
deaths in the ruxolitinib arm and 88 (56.8%) deaths in the BAT arm. OS median follow-up time was 
longer in ruxolitinib arm (7.34 months), compared to BAT arm (3.81 months).  
Time-to-event analysis of OS stratified by aGvHD grade, suggested greater benefits of RUX for patients 
with lower baseline aGvHD grades, as shown by HRs closer to zero at lower grades. Patients with 
grade II aGvHD were shown to benefit most by RUX treatment (HR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.34, 1.04). For 
patients with grade III the HR was 0.92, and in patients with grade IV the HR was 1.06.

There was no statistically significant impact on OS. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimated median OS, was 
longer in RUX arm (10.71 months), compared to BAT arm (5.82 months). However, the cumulative 
incidence of OS event rates was similar, for the two treatment arms, over time, indicating no major 
difference in survival in the treatment arms. Longer follow-up of OS data up to the end of study may 
provide better understanding of the data. 
Given the study design, OS is primarily viewed as a safety endpoint. The allowance of cross-over 
creates a bias towards unity. In REACH-2 study, 49 (31.6%) out of 155 BAT subjects switched to 
ruxolitinib on or after Day 28. The rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) model was applied 
post-hoc to investigate what would have been the OS analysis had patients not crossed over to 
ruxolitinib. After adjustment for cross-over with the RPSFT model, the HR estimate was 0.779 (95% 
CI: 0.515, 1.177) compared to 0.833 (95% CI: 0.616, 1.126) obtained in the pre-planned ITT 
analysis. Thus, the RPSFT results do not indicate any impact of cross-over on overall survival. 
Event free survival 
EFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of i) hematologic disease 
relapse/progression, ii) graft failure or death due to any cause. The EFS analysis at time of the second 
analysis cut-off date included 87 (56.5%) events in the RUX arm and 95 (61.3%) events in the BAT 
arm. 
The K-M estimated median EFS was longer in RUX arm (8.18 months), compared to BAT arm (4.17 
months). However, at DCO the difference in events between the arms have decreased and 
furthermore, a decreasing K-M probability estimates for survival at 2 months, 6 months, 12 months, 
18 months and 24 months in both treatment arms, was seen.

Sensitivity analysis for EFS including aGvHD progression as an event of interest produced similar results as primary 
analysis.  
Time to event, EFS, stratified by GvHD grade, indicate a higher benefit for the RUX arm with lower 
aGvHD grade.  
There reduction in risk of EFS event in the RUX arm relative to the BAT arm was not statistically 
significant and was also not corrected for multiplicity.

FFS, which is a composite endpoint of (i) relapse or recurrence of underlying disease or death due of 
underlying disease, (ii) non-relapse mortality, or (iii) addition or initiation of another systemic therapy 
for aGvHD and the competing risk was cGvHD. Median FFS in the RUX arm was longer than in the BAT 
arm (4.86 months vs. 1.02 months; HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.63; p<0.0001). The formal comparison 
using Log rank test was, however, not mentioned in the SAP and is considered only descriptively. As

anticipated, FFS is driven by item (iii), while there is no indication of any impact of treatment on items 
(i) and (ii). FFS is not considered readily interpretable and these data are generated in an open-label 
study. Given these concerns, the FFS endpoint is not included in the product information.

Incidence of malignancy relapse/progression (updated at second analysis) 
Out of 309 randomized patients, there were 147 subjects in each treatment arm with an underlying 
hematologic malignant disease at baseline. 
The probability of malignancy relapse/progression was relatively low in both treatment arms, namely 
16/147; 10.9% in ruxolitinib arm and 25/147; 17.0% in the BAT arm.

Number of patients at risk is the number of patients who may develop malignancy relapse / 
progression at the given time point. Patients may experience event, competing risk, or become 
censored. 
Non-relapse mortality 
The analysis of NRM among all FAS patients included 69 (44.8%) patients with events in RUX arm and 
70 (45.2%) patients in BAT arm. The cumulative incidence curves for NRM were overlapping for the 
RUX and BAT arms, indicating similar event rates over time. The competing risk (hematological disease 
relapse/progression) was low in both treatment arms (11.0% and 16.1%, respectively). However, 
censoring was high in both treatment arms (44.2% and 38.7%), implying a high proportion of patients 
who were alive and who had no relapse/progression of underlying malignancy. 
Cumulative incidence curve of non-relapse mortality (FAS) 
Death occurring after start of new systemic aGVHD therapy was not counted as an FFS event, if the 
patient already experienced an FFS event at the start of new systemic acute GvHD therapy. In other 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 70/177 
 
 
 
 
 
words, NRM death was only counted as FFS event if it occurred before the other FFS events 
(hematologic disease relapse/progression and addition of new systemic aGvHD). For NRM as sole 
endpoint, all NRM deaths were counted as events, as start of new therapy would not interfere with this 
endpoint. Based on this, it is understood that the cumulative incidence of NRM is generally higher than 
the probability of NRM in the analysis of FFS, which was also the case in in this study. Moreover, NRM 
appears to be higher for ruxolitinib versus BAT in the FFS analysis because in the BAT arm many more 
patients had FFS events due to start of new systemic acute GvHD therapy than in the ruxolitinib arm. 
Cumulative steroid dosing until Day 56  
A successful tapering of steroids is a crucial step for the wellbeing of a patient after an allo-HSCT. 
Tapering of steroids preceded any tapering of other immunosuppressants and should, according to the 
protocol, not be initiated before Day 7.  
At Day 56, a numerically larger proportion of patients in RUX arm (21.4%; 95% CI: 15.2, 28.8) had 
tapered off corticosteroids than in BAT arm (14.8%; 95% CI: 9.6, 21.4) in the Primary analysis. 
Similar results were shown at the Secondary analysis (22.1% vs. 14.8%). The relative dose intensity 
and cumulative dose of steroids were similar between the RUX and BAT arms at all assessments. 
Average weekly steroid dosing (FAS)  
A similar proportion of patients in both treatment arms were receiving ≤50% of RDI at Day 56 (29.2% 
and 23.9%). 
Tapering of CNI and/or ruxolitinib would be initiated once the patient stopped corticosteroids. CNI 
taper was performed as per institutional guidelines.

Table above, indicate a substantially longer use of CNI in the RUX arm. However, concomitant 
medications, such as CNI, were only captured in the study database up to 30 days after the last dose 
of the study treatment, thus including patients that that crossed over from BAT to ruxolitinib arm 
whose exposure to CNI was only collected until BAT discontinuation/the time of crossover. Hence, the 
reported shorter use of CNIs in the BAT arm reflects the study design rather than the actual exposure 
time to CNIs. 
Incidence of cGvHD 
Cumulative incidence of cGvHD (FAS) 
A total of 45 (29.2%) patients in the RUX arm and 29 (18.7%) patients in BAT arm had developed 
cGvHD at DCO, i.e. more patients in the RUX arm had experienced an event of cGvHD. However, the 
difference in favor for the BAT arm, was seen mainly in Grade II aGvHD at randomization, while the 
cGVHD events were similar between the two treatment arms with respect to those with an aGvHD 
Grade 3 and 4 at randomization.  
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 72/177 
 
 
 
 
 
Competing events (deaths without prior onset of cGvHD and hematologic disease relapse/progression) 
were similar between the treatment arms. 
The median time to onset of cGvHD was longer in the RUX arm (181.0 days) than the BAT arm (142.0 
days). A majority of cGvHD events were reported mild at time of onset in both treatment arms. 
Health related Quality of Life outcomes analysis 
EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and FACT-BMT completion rates as a percentage of available patients were 
similar between the two arms throughout the study. Baseline scores were similar between both 
treatment arms. In both the randomized treatment and crossover periods, there was an overall 
improvement in all aspects of EQ-5D-5L and FACT-BMT questionnaires in both arms and no statistical 
analyses were performed.  
Graft failure (Chimerism) 
Occurrence of graft failure was reported as an event and also as an AE.  
A small proportion of patients (9/309), 5 patients in ruxolitinib arm and 4 patients in BAT arm, 
experienced graft failure by the time of Second analysis cut-off date (no change in these numbers from 
the Primary analysis cut-off). In the ruxolitinib arm, 3/5 graft failures were detected by a drop in 
chimerism, and two patients discontinued due to graft loss. In the BAT arm, 1/4 graft failures were 
detected by a drop in chimerism, and one patient discontinued due to graft loss.  
In the present study, the rate of graft failure is low and also comparable in the RUX arm and the BAT 
arm.

Title of Study: A Single-Cohort, Phase 2 Study of Ruxolitinib in Combination With Corticosteroids for 
the Treatment of Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft Versus-Host Disease 
Study number: INCB 18424-271, REACH-1 
Study period: This study was conducted at 26 study centres in the United States and the study period 
was 27 Dec 2016 to 05 Jun 2019 (final DCO). 
Treatment for an individual participant could continue for as long as benefit was being observed 
and/or until treatment withdrawal criteria were met. The study ended, and the final analysis occurred 
when 75% of participants achieved 2-year NRM, died or were lost to follow-up. 
Statistical methods 
No formal statistical tests were performed. All CIs were 95%. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
All efficacy analyses were conducted in the efficacy evaluable population, defined as all patients 
enrolled in the study (N=71).  
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 73/177 
 
 
 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ruxolitinib in combination with corticosteroids in 
participants with Grades II to IV SR-aGVHD as assessed by ORR at Day 28 (CR, VGPR or PR) based on 
CIBMTR response criteria and before the start of new anti-aGvHD therapy, if applicable.  
Treatments 
Patients received ruxolitinib at a starting dose of 5 mg b.i.d and the dose could be increased to 10 mg 
b.i.d if hematologic parameters were stable and no treatment-related toxicity was observed after the 
first 3 days of treatment. Dose-selection was based on publications (Spoerl et al, 2014 and Zeiser et al 
2015), both using ruxolitinib as an add on treatment in SR-GvHD. 
Participants received prednisone 2.5 mg/kg per day PO or methylprednisolone 2.0 mg/kg per day IV. 
Participants who previously began corticosteroid therapy at a different dose were permitted to remain 
on that dose if considered appropriate by the treating physician. Corticosteroids were tapered as per 
institutional guidelines at a rate commensurate with resolution of GVHD manifestations. 
Study participants 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those for Study C2301. In the original protocol male or 
female, 18 years of age or older was an inclusion criterion, which was amended in Sept 2016, (Amend. 
1) to include male or female, 12 years of age or older. No patients < 18 years of age were, however, 
included.  
The majority of participants were < 65 years of age, with a median age of 58 years (range: 18-73 
years) and 49.3% males and 50.7% females. 
At baseline, mean donor chimerism was 95.3% (median: 100.0%; range 0%-100%).

Summary of Overall Response Rate at Day 28 (Efficacy Evaluable Participants) 
The 6-month DOR was the key secondary endpoint of the study. The median DOR for the 56.3% of 
patients who had response at Day 28 was 669.0 days, and for 76.1% of patients who had response at

any time point was 345.0 days. The 6-month event-free probability estimate for DOR based on 
response at Day 28 and response at any time point was 68.2% and 62.1%, respectively. 
NRM: A total of 40 participants (56.3%) died from causes other than relapse of the underlying 
malignancy. The cumulative incidence rates at 6, 9, and 12 months were 44.3% (95% CI: 32.5, 55.5), 
47.3% (95% CI: 35.2, 58.5), and 53.4% (95% CI: 40.9, 64.3), respectively. 
Relapse rate: Five participants (7.0%) had a relapse of the underlying malignancy; the relapse had a 
fatal outcome in 4 of those participants (5.6%). 
FFS: A total of 11 participants (15.5%) were still alive and had not had a relapse/progression of the 
underlying malignancy, had not required additional therapy for aGVHD, and had not demonstrated 
signs or symptoms of cGVHD. The median FFS time was 85.0 days (95% CI: 42.0, 158.0). 
OS: A total of 44 participants (62.0%) had died, and 27 participants (38.0%) were censored at the last 
date known to be alive. The median OS time was 232.0 days (95% CI: 93.0, 675.0). At Months 3 and 
6 the OS probability was >50%, and at Months 9 and 12, the OS probability was >40%.

randomisation for the treatment of EBV. This EBV infection was captured either into the 
Medical History or Adverse Event eCRF. If any medication included in the BAT list was used as 
prophylaxis for cGvHD before entering this study, it was allowed to be continued post-
randomisation and was captured on the Concomitant Medication eCRF.

flare and was considered a treatment failure for both the primary and key secondary 
objectives. 
Cycle length is 28 days. 
Following randomization, change or addition of a new systemic therapy in the BAT arm due to 
documented lack of response or toxicity was allowed in the first 6 cycles, but was considered a 
treatment failure. At Cycle 7 Day 1 or later after randomization, patients randomized to BAT that did 
not achieve or maintain a CR or PR, or who developed toxicity to BAT were allowed to cross over from 
BAT to ruxolitinib. 
The protocol defined BAT were based on a selection of therapies used as institutional standards since 
there is none uniformly used standard second line therapy in SR-cGvHD. Ibrutinib, included in the 
arsenal for the treatment of cGvHD after the protocol finalisation (however not an authorized indication 
in EU) was included as an of the electable choices of BAT, as a consequence of Amendment 1.

Tapering of concomitant immunosuppression 
Tapering of immunosuppression therapy in responding patients was performed in two steps: 
1. Taper of corticosteroids was attempted approximately 2 weeks after achieving a CR, based on 
protocol guidelines.  
2. Taper of CNI and/or ruxolitinib was not initiated until the patient was off corticosteroids AND 
completed the assessments for Cycle 7 Day 1. Ruxolitinib was not be tapered prior to Cycle 7 Day 1 for 
patients initially randomized to the ruxolitinib arm. 
Concomitant treatment 
Supportive treatments per institutional guidelines for management of alloSCT patients with SRcGvHD 
were allowed. Patients may have received other cGvHD medications administered either as cGvHD 
prophylaxis or as treatment prior to randomization which could include CNI (cyclosporine or 
tacrolimus), and corticosteroids. Viral prophylaxis and antibiotics were allowed as needed for 
prevention and treatment of any infections. 
Change or addition of new systemic immunosuppressive therapy after randomization and up to 
completion of Cycle 7 Day 1 was considered a treatment failure. 
Ruxolitinib dose adjustments might be required particularly in patients treated with CYP450 modulators 
due to potential for drug-drug interactions leading to under- or over-exposure. 
Permitted/prohibited medication according to the protocol are in line with Jakavi SmPC. 
Cross-over 
Patients randomised to BAT, and not achieving PR or better on or after Cycle 7 Day 1 were allowed to 
cross-over to the RUX treatment arm and were to follow the same treatment schedule as patients 
originally randomised to RUX treatment.  
Duration of treatment 
The End of Treatment (EOT) visit occurred when the patient permanently discontinued the study 
treatment and entered the Long-term survival follow-up, or completed the Randomized treatment 
period (ruxolitinib arm, or BAT patients not crossing over) or the Crossover period (BAT arm only). The 
total duration on study for an individual patient was 39 Cycles (156 weeks or 3 years).

Objectives 
Primary objective 
• 
To compare the efficacy of ruxolitinib vs. Investigator’s choice Best Available Therapy (BAT) in 
patients with moderate or severe SR-cGvHD assessed by Overall Response Rate (ORR) at the 
Cycle 7 Day 1 visit. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Endpoints according to Statistical Analysis Plan 
Primary endpoint 
Overall response rate (ORR) on Cycle 7 Day 1 after randomization, defined as the proportion of 
patients in each arm demonstrating a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) without the 
requirement of additional systemic therapies for an earlier progression, mixed response or non-
response. Scoring of response was relative to the organ score at randomization, using the established 
NIH consensus criteria. 
Secondary endpoints 
Key secondary endpoint-Composite time to event endpoint  
-First key secondary endpoint defined as the time from date of randomization to the earliest of the 
following FFS events: 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
relapse or recurrence of underlying disease or death due to underlying disease or 
non-relapse mortality, or  
addition or initiation of another systemic therapy for cGvHD.  
-The second key secondary objective was to assess the rate of patients with clinically relevant 
improvement of the modified Lee symptoms score at Cycle 7 Day 1 relative to baseline, as assessed by 
the rate of responders as per improvement ≥ 7 points of total symptom score (TSS) from baseline of 
the modified Lee Symptom Scale (mLSS).  
Other secondary endpoints- please also refer to table in section 2.5.3.1.4  
-Best overall response (BOR): Proportion of patients who achieved OR (CR+PR) at any time point (up 
Cycle 7 day 1 or the start of additional systemic therapy for cGvHD). 
- Proportion of patients who achieved OR (CR+PR) at Cycle 4 Day 1. 
- Duration of response (DOR) is assessed for responders only. DOR is defined as the time from first 
response until cGvHD progression, death, or the date of change/addition of systemic therapies for 
cGvHD. 
- Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to 
any cause. 
- Non-relapse mortality (NRM), defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death not 
preceded by underlying disease relapse/recurrence.  
-To assess proportion of patients with ≥50% reduction in daily corticosteroid dose at Cycle 7 Day1 
-To assess proportion of patients successfully tapered off all corticosteroids at Cycle 7 Day 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 80/177 
 
 
 
-To assess Malignancy Relapse/Recurrence (MR) is defined as the time from date of randomization to 
hematologic malignancy relapse/recurrence. Calculated for patients with underlying hematologic 
malignant disease. 
- Change in FACT-BMT from baseline to each visit where measured. Change in EQ-5D from baseline to 
each visit where measured. 
Efficacy analysis/ Criteria for evaluation 
The severity of cGvHD at screening was assessed based on the number and degree of organ 
involvement according to the established NIH consensus criteria. For the definition of SR-CGvHD, 
please refer to inclusion criteria since the patient had to have a confirmed diagnosis of corticosteroid 
refractory cGvHD defined per 2014 NIH consensus criteria (Lee 2015).  
The most frequently involved organs in patients with chronic GVHD are skin, mouth, and liver, with 
less frequent involvement of eye, lung, GI tract, joint/fascia, and genital tract. 
Global and organ-specific cGvHD clinician assessments were performed at baseline, weekly for the first 
4 weeks, and then every 28 days until Cycle 7 Day 1 according to the NIH Consensus Criteria 
described above. Following Cycle 7 Day 1, response was assessed on Cycle 9 Day 1 and every 12 
weeks thereafter. 
CR was defined as complete resolution of all signs and symptoms of cGvHD in all evaluable organs 
without additional therapies. 
PR was defined as an improvement in at least one organ (e.g., improvement of 1 or more points on a 
4 to 7-point scale, or an improvement of 2 or more points on a 10- to 12-point scale) without 
progression in other organs or sites, or addition/initiation of new systemic treatment. 
Lack of response was defined as unchanged, mixed response, or progression. 
PD was defined as worsening of at least one organ and no improvement (CR or PR) in any other organ 
Mixed response was a CR or PR in at least 1 organ accompanied by progression in another organ 
Unchanged response was defined as stable disease or absence of improvement in any organ 
involved by cGvHD 
cGvHD Flare was defined as any increase in symptoms during taper of any immunosuppressive 
therapy for cGvHD, after an initial response (CR or PR). A cGvHD flare was not considered a treatment 
failure unless severity requires addition and/or change of another systemic immunosuppressive 
treatment.  
cGvHD Recurrence was defined as the return of cGvHD symptoms after tapering off study treatment 
due to response. Following completion of a taper of systemic therapy, if worsening of cGvHD 
symptoms occur, the patient was allowed to resume treatment for cGvHD as per local institutional 
practice. However, this was to be documented as a recurrence of cGvHD. 
Graft failure monitoring Patients will be monitored for any evidence of graft failure at each visit after 
Cycle 1 Day 1. In addition, considering that Graft failure is defined as initial whole blood or marrow 
donor chimerism >5% declining to <5% on subsequent measurements, donor chimerism will be also 
closely monitored. Donor chimerism after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant involves identifying the 
genetic profiles of the recipient and of the donor pre-transplant, and then evaluating the ratio of donor 
to recipient cells in the recipient's blood, or bone marrow.

Sample size 
In a meta-analysis, Olivieri et al (2015) obtained an estimated pooled effect size for ORR for systemic 
treatment of SR-cGvHD of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.62–0.70). Sample size calculations were performed to 
achieve 90% power for different scenarios, assuming a targeted odds ratio of 2.35 and 2.5, 
respectively. A sample size of 324 patients was considered reasonable for this study based on stratified 
one-sided CMH test (alpha=2.5%, assuming same ORR and 50% of patients in each stratum). 
With a sample size of 162 patients in each treatment (e.g., ORR=0.66 on Cycle 7 Day 1 for BAT for 
each stratum), an observed odds ratio greater than or equal to 1.68 is expected to result in 
statistically significant differences between the arms. 
The sample size calculation seems appropriate. However, it is noted that the observed ORR rates are 
considerably lower than what was anticipated in the calculation. The ORR for Ruxolitinib estimated in 
the study is approximately 50%, i.e., only a fraction of the expected 82% as indicated above. The 
expected BAT effect (ORR of 66%) was not achieved in the study.  
Randomisation 
A stratified 1:1 randomisation was conducted, and patients received either ruxolitinib or BAT. They 
were stratified by cGvHD grade (Grade cGvHD moderate vs severe). Before randomization, BAT was 
selected by the Investigator.  
Blinding (masking) 
No blinding was performed due to the variety of treatments for SR cGvHD with different severity in the 
BAT arm. 
Treatment phases/study conduct 
-Screening period (Day -28 to Day -1): Prospective patients diagnosed with moderate or severe SR-
cGvHD and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented prior to beginning screening 
assessments. The screening period can last 28 days (Day -28 to Day -1).  
-Main treatment period (Day 1 to EOT): The total duration on study for an individual patient will be 39 
Cycles (156 weeks or 3 years), inclusive of the randomized treatment period, cross over treatment 
period, and long-term survival follow-up.  
-Crossover Treatment Phase: Patients randomized to the BAT arm who experience disease 
progression, have a mixed response, experience cGvHD flare, or experience toxicity to BAT are 
permitted to cross over to the ruxolitinib arm following completion of all assessments at Cycle 7 Day 1, 
or thereafter.  
A maximum of 39 cycles of study treatment and follow-up is completed, inclusive of the randomized 
treatment period, cross over treatment period, and long-term survival follow up (i.e. patients who 
cross over on Cycle 9 will only complete visits until Cross-Over Cycle 30). 
Primary efficacy period The Primary Efficacy Endpoint assessment will be conducted on Cycle 7 Day 1 
of the randomized treatment period with a window of +/- 7 days.

Overall cGvHD Response assessment vs baseline (prior to Cycle 7 Day 1) 
Extension period (Cycle 7 to Cycle 39) 
-Safety follow-up (Last Dose + 30 days): All patients must have safety evaluations at least 30 days (+ 
3 days) after the last dose of study treatment. During the safety follow up, adverse events, 
concomitant medications, transfusions, and monitoring of infections will be recorded. If an adverse 
event or a serious adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is 
judged to be permanent. 
-Long-term survival follow-up (EOT to 39 cycles on study): Patients who permanently discontinue the 
study treatment prior to the completion of 39 cycles on study for reasons other than achieving a CR or 
PR will enter the Long-Term Survival Follow-Up, and may be treated per Institutional practice. They 
will be followed approximately every 3 months by telephone call for survival, reporting of new cGvHD 
therapies until 39 cycles on study is completed, inclusive of randomized treatment, cross over 
treatment (BAT patients only), and long-term survival follow up. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy variable, ORR at Cycle 7 Day 1, was planned to be analysed at the time when all 
patients have completed their Cycle 7 Day 1 visit or discontinued earlier. The data cut-off date for the 
primary analysis was 08-May-2020. An interim analysis on the primary endpoint ORR and key 
secondary endpoints FFS and mLSS, based on cut-off date 9-Jul-2019, was performed in October 
2019. 
The final analysis will occur once all patients have completed the study (up to 39 cycles/3 years from 
randomization). 
Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprises all patients to whom study treatment has been assigned by 
randomization. According to the intent to treat principle, patients were analyzed according to the 
treatment and strata they have been assigned to during the randomization procedure. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) consists of a subset of the patients in the FAS who are compliant with 
requirements of the clinical study protocol (CSP).  
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 83/177 
 
 
 
 
The Safety Set includes all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Patients were 
analysed according to the study treatment received, where treatment received was defined as the 
randomized treatment if the patient took at least one dose of that treatment, or the first treatment 
received if the randomized treatment was never received. 
The Cross-over Analysis Set (CAS) comprises all patients randomized to and who receive BAT, who 
then crossed over and received at least one dose of ruxolitinib. This analysis set was used for all 
analyses for crossover patients. 
Primary analysis 
The primary endpoint of the study was ORR at Cycle 7 Day 1 defined as the proportion of patients with 
CR or PR, according to the NIH Consensus Criteria. Note that response is relative to the assessment of 
cGvHD at randomization. A patient was not considered a responder if any of the following events 
occurs prior to the Cycle 7 Day 1 visit: 
-  Missing overall cGvHD response assessment at Cycle 7 Day 1 
-  No CR or PR at Cycle 7 Day 1 
-  Addition of or start of new systemic therapy for cGvHD. 
The statistical hypotheses and method of analysis was similar to the primary analysis of the REACH 2 
study. The Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test, stratified by the randomization 
stratification factor (i.e., cGvHD moderate vs. severe), was used to compare ORR between the two 
treatment groups. The primary analysis was performed on the FAS according to ITT principle. One-
sided p-value, odds ratio (OR) and 95% Wald confidence limits calculated from the stratified CMH test 
were presented. ORR was also summarized using descriptive statistics (N, %) by treatment arm along 
with two-sided exact binomial 95% CIs [Clopper and Pearson 1934]. 
Supportive analyses included re-run of the primary efficacy analysis on the PPS, and detailed 
descriptions of response rates and organ specific responses at Cycle 7 Day 1. 
Subgroup analysis was performed for the primary efficacy endpoint to assess the homogeneity of 
treatment effect across demographic and baseline disease characteristics. Efficacy analyses in 
subgroups were purely exploratory and intended to explore the consistency of treatment effect. 
ORR at Crossover Cycle 7 Day 1 was defined as the proportion of crossover patients with CR or PR at 
Crossover Cycle 7 Day 1. ORR was summarized using descriptive statistics (N, %) along with two-sided 
exact binomial 95% CIs [Clopper and Pearson 1934] using local investigators’ overall response 
assessed at the Crossover Cycle 7 Day 1 visit and taking into account initiation or addition of new 
systemic therapy before this time point. Note that response was relative to the last assessment of 
cGvHD prior to or at the start date of crossover treatment (ruxolitinib). A patient was not considered a 
responder at Crossover Cycle 7 Day 1 if any of the following events occurs prior to Crossover Cycle 7 
Day 1: 
-  Missing overall cGvHD response assessment at crossover or Crossover Cycle 7 Day 1  
-  No CR or PR at Crossover Cycle 7 Day 1  
-  Addition of or start of new systemic therapy for cGvHD. 
Analysis of the key secondary endpoints 
The first key secondary endpoint was Failure free survival (FFS), in line with the CHMP/PMDA’s 
recommendation and defined as the time from date of randomization to the earliest of: i) relapse or 
recurrence of underlying disease or death due to underlying disease, ii) non-relapse mortality, or iii) 
addition or initiation of another systemic therapy for cGvHD. If a patient did not experience any of 
these events, FFS were censored at the latest contact data (on or before the cut-off date). A stratified 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 84/177 
 
 
 
one-sided log-rank test was used to test if FFS hazard ratio (ruxolitinib arm versus BAT arm) was 
lower than 1. The stratification was based on the randomization stratification factors (i.e. cGvHD 
moderate vs severe). 
No data imputation was performed for key secondary endpoints when missing values, censoring, or 
discontinuations occurred. 
The second key secondary objective was to assess the improvement of symptoms based on the total 
symptom score (TSS) using the modified Lee Symptom Scale. A responder was defined as having 
achieved a clinically relevant reduction by ≥7 scores from baseline of the TSS. A patient was not 
considered a responder at Cycle 7 Day 1 if any of the following events occurs prior to or at the Cycle 7 
Day 1 visit: 
-  Missing or insufficient data to calculate TSS at baseline or Cycle 7 Day 1 
-  No clinically relevant reduction of TSS at Cycle 7 Day 1 
-  Additional systemic therapy for cGvHD.  
The Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test, stratified by the randomization stratification factor 
(i.e., cGvHD moderate vs severe), was used to compare the response rates between the two treatment 
groups. 
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations 
Patients with missing assessments that prevent the evaluation of the primary endpoint were 
considered non-responders on that treatment arm. This includes missing overall cGvHD response 
assessments at baseline and Cycle 7 Day 1. The same rule was applied for the evaluation of the ORR 
at Cycle 4 Day 1 and BOR, including missing cGvHD assessments at Cycle 4 Day 1.  
No data imputation was to be applied. Addition or initiation of a new systemic therapy before Cycle 7 
Day 1 in any arm was considered a treatment failure, and patients were counted as non-responder in 
the primary analysis. 
Multiplicity 
A fixed sequence hierarchical testing strategy has initially been planned for the primary and the two 
key secondary endpoints, with all tests being one-sided with significance level alpha=2.5%. With 
protocol amendment 1, an efficacy and safety interim analysis (IA) was added based on a 2-look 
group-sequential study design, and a hierarchical testing procedure was implemented to control the 
familywise error rate (FWER) at the one-sided 2.5% level of significance for the primary and the two 
key secondary endpoints at the IA and the primary CSR analysis (see figure below). (In line with the 
CHMP/PMDA’s recommendation, FFS was used as the first key secondary endpoint for all regions 
except the US. A different testing sequence was used for the US (FDA), where mLSS was tested before 
testing FFS.) 
Figure 8. Hierarchical testing strategy used for all regions except for the US (RoW) 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 85/177 
 
 
 
 
The first efficacy look was planned when 194 (60% of the targeted 324 patients) had completed the 
Cycle 7 Day 1 visit or discontinued from the study earlier and data of assessments are available. 
Interim analysis was performed based on efficacy data of the first 196 patients (60.5% of the targeted 
324 patients) on cut-off date 9-Jul-2019. The resulting significance level alpha was 0.01176 for the 
interim analysis. With N=329 for the primary analysis the targeted alpha to re-test the hypotheses (if 
not rejected at the IA) was 0.01858. Following the overall hierarchical testing procedure, the 
hypotheses that were not rejected at the IA are to be tested again in this this CSR analyses spending 
the remaining alpha, i.e. IA results have to be taken into account when interpreting CSR results. 
Interim analysis 
One early safety interim analysis and an interim efficacy and safety analysis (both added in protocol 
amendment 1) were planned. An early safety analysis was generated when safety data on the first 80 
randomized patients who have completed Cycle 4 Day 1 were available. The interim analysis was to be 
performed by an independent statistician and programmer when 194 (60% of the targeted 324 
patients) have completed the Cycle 7 Day 1 visit or discontinued from the study earlier and data of 
assessments were available. Following a 2-look group sequential design a rho-spending function with 
parameter rho=1.5 was used as alpha spending function, for which operational characteristics were 
given in the amended protocol (dated 20-Dec-2017). If the number of patients at the IA is not exactly 
194 at the time of the interim cut-off, the efficacy stopping bound would be recalculated based on the 
pre-specified alpha spending function. 
The interim analysis was performed based on efficacy data of the first 196 patients (60.5% of the 
targeted 324 patients) on the significance level alpha of 0.01176. With N=329 for the primary analysis 
the targeted alpha to re-test the hypotheses (if not rejected at the IA) was 0.01858. The interim 
analysis p-values for the primary and the key secondary endpoints were: 0.0003, <0.0001 and 
0.0151. At the CSR primary analysis, the corresponding p-values were <0.0001, <0.0001 and 0.0011. 
The 3rd endpoint (proportion of responders based on the TSS) was according to the applied hierarchical 
testing procedure not significant at the interim analysis but could be re-tested at the primary CSR 
analysis on 0.01858 alpha level and therefore was statistically significant. 
Changes from the planned analyses 
No relevant changes were made between the (amended) protocol statistical section and the SAP.  
However, an error was detected in the programmed derivation of some of the mLSS subscales caused 
by an incorrect description in the SAP Amendment 2. The corrected description of the scoring is 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 86/177 
 
 
 
 
documented in the SAP Addendum to Amendment 2. The programs were updated for the respective 
analysis data and all outputs for mLSS were re-produced. The impact of these updates on the overall 
results for mLSS was low, the key secondary endpoint remained statistically significant.  
The addition of an interim efficacy and safety analysis in the protocol amendment 1 was made early 
during the study conduct (at the time when 15 subjects were screened and randomized) and is not 
likely to have been influenced by any observed study data. The analyses were performed in accordance 
with the amended protocol.  
Of note, for the interpretation of the phase III study results, the convention is to use 2-sided tests and 
p-values. For that reason, 2-sided p-values are included in the SmPC. 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was dated 14-MAR-2017 and an amended protocol version 01 was effective from 
20-DEC-2017; issued after 15 patients had been randomized.  
The main purpose of the amendment was to extend the available patient population. Due to protracted 
enrolment and feedback from health authorities and investigators, several inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were revised. Additionally, following the approval of ibrutinib, the original protocol-defined list 
of BAT options would not allow for a complete comparative assessment versus ruxolitinib. Therefore, 
adding ibrutinib to the list of eligible BAT was necessary to reflect the complete list of treatment 
options for this patient population. Lastly, a Data Monitoring Committee was been added based on 
health authority feedback to include an independent review group. 
At the time of the amendment finalization, 15 patients had been screened and all 15 had been 
randomized, and none of these patients had reached the 6-month visit that was used for the primary 
endpoint.  
With regards to amendments concerning inclusion and exclusion criteria, please also refer to section 
2.4.5.1.1.  
There was one protocol amendment, issued 20-DEC-2017, after 15 patients had been randomized in 
study D2301, REACH3. There were several changes including revision of some inclusion and exclusion 
criteria as well as some secondary endpoints. Most of the changes being of clarifying nature, however, 
some of more clinically relevant character. The updated number of patients for extensive PK sampling 
is acknowledged as well as the important update of the window for patients receiving systemic or 
topical corticosteroids for the treatment of cGvHD, which was extended from six months to twelve 
months. Furthermore, patients who had received two or more systemic therapies for cGvHD were 
excluded, thus only patients who had received one prior replacement dose range was allowed. The 
amendment allowing a broader inclusion population, i.e. updated definition of overlap syndrome might 
have facilitated the inclusion rate.  
With regard to the added DMC, interim analysis and the SAP addendum, these are endorsed. The 
addition of DMC and interim efficacy and safety analysis in the protocol amendment 1 was made early 
during the study conduct and is not likely to have been influenced by any observed study data. The 
scoring for mLSS was corrected prior to the CSR, and the key secondary endpoint remained 
statistically significant.

Patient disposition - End of randomized treatment (FAS) 
The median duration of exposure to RUX treatment and BAT treatment were 41.3 weeks (0.7-127.3) 
and 24.1 weeks (0.6-108.4) for RUX treatment and BAT treatment, respectively. 
As illustrated in the K-M plot, treatments were discontinued at similar pace up to the measurement 
timepoint for the primary endpoint (Cycle 7 Day 1), after which there is a sharp drop in the BAT arm, 
explained by the study design as it was targeted to keep patients in the main treatment period at least 
until the Cycle 7 Day 1 visit.  
A total of 82 (49.7%) and 122 (74.4%) patients discontinued the randomized treatment period in the 
ruxolitinib and BAT arm, respectively. The most frequent reasons for discontinuations during period up

to the Cycle 7 Day 1 visit were adverse events and lack of efficacy in ruxolitinib arm (21 and 13 
patients, respectively), and lack of efficacy in the BAT arm (29 patients). 
Cross-over patients 
At the end of Cycle 6, 61 (37.2%) patients in the BAT arm crossed over to RUX treatment and 37 
(22.6%) entered the Survival follow-up phase. No patient completed the Cross-over treatment period 
with RUX at the time of data cut-off, and 46 (75.4%, out of 61 patients) were still receiving RUX. 
Therefore, efficacy data for the cross-over treatment population are not presented in the present CSR.

Fifteen (24.6%) patients discontinued the Cross-over treatment period with RUX due to AEs: lack of 
efficacy each in 4 (6.6%) patients, physician decision and patient/guardian decision each in 3 (4.9%) 
patients and death in one patient.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol changes 
The original study protocol dated 14 Mar 2017 was amended once on 20-Dec-2017. The main purpose 
of the amendment was to extend the available patient population. Due to protracted enrollment and 
feedback from health authorities and investigators, several inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
revised: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The window for patients currently receiving systemic or topical corticosteroids for the 
treatment of cGvHD was extended from six months to twelve months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. 
Instead of excluding patients that received any systemic treatment for cGvHD in addition to 
corticosteroids ± CNI, patients who have received one prior systemic treatment in addition to 
corticosteroids ± CNI were eligible as well.  
The criterion regarding overlap syndrome was clarified to exclude those patients with active 
acute progressive disease. 
The definition of severely impaired renal function was updated by adding the text “having 
estimated creatinine clearance <30 ml/min measured or calculated by Cockroft Gault equation 
(confirmed within 48 hours prior to study treatment start)”. This criterion was updated to 
provide a more sensitive measure of mild or moderate kidney injury at study entry. 
•  Updated cholestatic criterion to add total bilirubin >2mg/dL attributable to GvHD. This criterion 
was added as a more specific exclusion of patients with ongoing hepatic acute-like GvHD 
•  Added impairment of GI function example of diarrhea attributed to GvHD. This criterion was 
added as a more specific exclusion of patients with ongoing acute-like GI GvHD. 
Additionally, with the recent approval of ibrutinib by the FDA the original protocol-defined list of BAT 
options would not allow for a complete comparative assessment versus RUX. Therefore, ibrutinib was 
added to this list to reflect the complete list of treatment options for this patient population.  
The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) and the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
patient-reported outcomes have been added as exploratory endpoint. 
Lastly, a Data Monitoring Committee was added to include an independent review group. 
Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations were observed in 63% of patients in the RUX arm and 66.5% in BAT arm. The most 
common deviation category was ‘other deviations’(32.7% vs. 37.2%), primarily consisting of Lee 
Symptom Scale not collected (13.9% vs. 17.1%) and HBV and/or HCV viral load testing value missing 
at Cycle 1 Day 1 (9.7% vs. 7.9%). 
Protocol deviations due to COVID-19 pandemic 
The study was fully recruited before the out brake of the COVID-19 pandemic and all, except 6, 
patients had completed Cycle 7 Day 1 visit (primary endpoint). The conduct of the clinical trial during 
the COVID-19 pandemic followed the guidance of FDA and EMA. One of the changes was allowing 
Assessment report

Page 91/177 
 
 
 
assessments to be done remotely (video, telephone) or at non-conventional location such as outside of 
site, when no other option was available. 
Deviations were noted with respect to drug supply (5.5%), visits conducted outside of study site 
(8,2%), cGVHD staging assessment missing (2,7%), assessment / procedure changed (2,7%), missing 
cGvHD assessment for cycle 6 and 7, resulting in “PD” (1.8%, 2 and 4 patients in the RUX arm and 
BAT arm, respectively). Due to challenges to assess GvHD patients, especially with regard to the 
staging of skin and lung involvement in cGvHD for patients with remote visits (video or telephone) 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicant has declared that the majority of patients had already 
reached the time for primary endpoint assessment before the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. 
For the 8 patients, for whom the Cycle 7 Day 1 visit could have been impacted due to the pandemic, 
measures were taken to ensure a reliable assessment. Other visits done outside of study site due to 
COVID-19 were handled the same way.

Underlying disease history/transplant and GvHD related history 
The most frequently reported underlying diseases were AML (36.5%), ALL (15.8%) and MDC 13.4%. 
The fraction of patients with a non-malignant underlying disease was low. 
Using the CIBMTR risk assessment tool (a validated tool to categorize groups of patients undergoing 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation, intended for research purposes, to stratify patients in broad 
disease risk categories for retrospective or prospective studies) approximately 25% were graded in 
each of the Low, Intermediate and High-risk groups. ~21% was missing or unknown. 
Median time from transplant to cGvHD diagnosis was 235.00 days (range: 20.0 – 8047.0) overall and 
similar between two arms. 
The median time since diagnosis to randomization was 2.33 years.  
The stem cell source was bone marrow in 13.3% and 18.9% of the patients in the RUX arm and the 
BAT arm, respectively and peripheral blood in 85.5% and 79.9% of the patients in the RUX arm and 
the BAT arm, respectively. Only two patients in each arm received cord blood. Most patients received 
grafts from identical HLA-matched donors (57.5%; 192/329). T-cell depletion was performed in 38 
(11.4%) patients overall.

Medical history and cGvHD disease history 
Most reported ongoing medical conditions were consistent with the study indication and the 
complications of treatment (transplantation and GvHD treatment).  
Prior prophylaxis - Among the 329 patients randomised, 33.9% of patients in RUX arm and 31.1% of 
patients in BAT arm received prior prophylaxis treatment for cGvHD. CNIs were the most frequently 
(24.0%) reported prophylactic therapy for cGvHD in both arms (23.6% and 24.4%, respectively), 
including cyclosporine (14.5% and 17.1%) and tacrolimus (9.1% and 7.9%). Use of glucocorticoids in 
the prophylactic treatment for cGvHD was reported in 10.0% of all patients. 
Prior treatment - Almost all patients reported a prior treatment for cGvHD or SR-cGvHD (RUX arm: 
98.2% and BAT arm: 95.7%). The most frequently used prior systemic therapy was steroid alone 
(42.4% in RUX arm and 49.4% in BAT arm) or steroids + CNI (41.2% vs. 42.1%). 
Concomitant cGvHD treatments – Almost all (≥99%) patients in both treatment arms used 
concomitant immunosuppressive medications on treatment (starting on or after the start of study 
treatment and no more than 30 days after EOT). Corticosteroids were used by 59.4% of patients in the 
RUX arm and 55.1% in the BAT arm. Calcineurin inhibitors were taken in 27.3% vs. 19%, respectively.  
Transfusions 
A total of 26.7% patients in the ruxolitinib arm and 21.5% patients in the BAT arm underwent 
transfusion starting on or after the start of study treatment (packed red blood cells in 23.6% and 
18.4% in each respective arm) and platelets (13.9% in each arm). 
Numbers analysed 
Analysis sets (all randomized patients) 
Efficacy analyses used the Full Analysis Set (FAS), following the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) principle, 
comprising all patients to whom study treatment has been assigned by randomisation. All 329 
randomised patients were included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) for the primary analysis with data 
cut-off date 08-May-2020: n=165 in the RUX arm and n=164 in the BAT arm. 
Supportive analyses were performed using the Per Protocol Set comprised of patients compliant with 
the requirements of the study (n=96 [58.2%] in the RUX arm, and n=92 [56.1%] in the BAT arm). 
Results of the interim analysis (IA) for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were based 
on the first 196 patients who completed Cycle 7 Day 1 visit (by data cut-off on 09-Jul-2019), after 
which the DMC recommended to proceed the study with primary analysis for all 329 randomized 
patients who completed Cycle 7 Day 1 visit or discontinued earlier (data cut-off on 08-May-2020). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Statistical tests of the primary and the two key secondary endpoints at the interim analysis and the 
primary analysis were performed according to an overall hierarchical testing procedure (please refer to 
Statistical methods).

Overall response rate at Cycle 7 Day 1 (Full analysis set – Interim Analysis) 
The results were confirmed at the primary analysis (data cut-off date 08-May-2020, N=329).

It is noticed that ORR rates are considerably lower than what was anticipated in the sample size 
calculation. 
The P-value of the stratified CMH test (P<0.0001) is given for descriptive purpose only, as significance 
was shown at the interim analysis.  
The proportion of complete responders was low in both arms (6.7% vs. 3%).

Sensitivity analysis using PPS (N=188), ORR at Cycle 7 Day 1 evaluated with the same analysis 
conventions as for the primary efficacy analysis, was consistent with the primary analysis using FAS.  
Overall response at Cycle 7 Day 1 – (Per Protocol Set, primary analysis) 
According to the SAP, a patient was not considered a responder at Cycle 7 Day 1 if any of the following 
events occur in case of missing cGvHD assessment at Cycle 7 Day 1, or in case there was use of 
Additional systemic therapy for cGvHD. It has been clarified that missing data in the primary analysis 
are presented in category ‘unknown’, while the category ‘missing visits’ actually refers to invalid 
cGvHD assessments. There were 19 (11.5%) and 49 (29.9%) patients in the ruxolitinib and BAT arm, 
respectively, who started new or additional systemic cGvHD treatment up to the pre-specified time 
window used to define a valid Cycle 7 Day 1. Sensitivity analysis was requested to use the actual 
response instead of imputed non-response for patients who received a new systemic treatment for 
cGvHD prior to Cycle 7 Day 1 visit. The analysis was not provided as done in REACH-2 study; instead, 
only frequency of the overall response was presented per treatment group: 87 (52.7%) and 51 
(31.1%) patients with overall response in the ruxolitinib and BAT arm, respectively. With non-
responder imputation in the primary analysis, the corresponding numbers were 82 (49.7%) and 42 
(25.6%) patients with overall response in the ruxolitinib and BAT arms, respectively, thus, potentially 
overestimating efficacy of ruxolitinib.

According to the SAP, a patient was not considered a responder at Cycle 7 Day 1 if any of the following 
events occurs in case of missing cGvHD assessment at Cycle 7 Day 1, or in case there was use of 
Additional systemic therapy for cGvHD. It has been clarified that missing data in the primary analysis 
are presented in category ‘unknown’, while the category ‘missing visits’ actually refers to invalid 
cGvHD assessments. There were 19 (11.5%) and 49 (29.9%) patients in the ruxolitinib and BAT arm, 
respectively, who started new or additional systemic cGvHD treatment up to the pre-specified time 
window used to define a valid Cycle 7 Day 1. Sensitivity analysis was requested to use the actual 
response instead of imputed non-response for patients who received a new systemic treatment for 
cGvHD prior to Cycle 7 Day 1 visit. The analysis was not provided as done in REACH-2 study; instead, 
only frequency of the overall response was presented per treatment group: 87 (52.7%) and 51 
(31.1%) patients with overall response in the ruxolitinib and BAT arm, respectively. With non-
responder imputation in the primary analysis, the corresponding numbers were 82 (49.7%) and 42 
(25.6%) patients with overall response in the ruxolitinib and BAT arms, respectively, thus, potentially 
overestimating efficacy of ruxolitinib.  
For the subgroup analyses, the odds ratio remained favorable for ruxolitinib, demonstrated by 
consistent odds ratio >1 in most subgroups. Subgroups with odds ratio <1 (Asian region, Steroid+ 
CNI+ other systemic therapy and steroid+ other systemic therapy), where all hampered by wide CI 
and small size. Point estimate of the treatment effect and 95% confidence intervals was provided.  
In subgroup age 12- <18 years, there were in total 12 patients randomized, 4 patients in the RUX arm 
and 8 in the BAT treatment arm. Seventy five percent (3/4) and 25% (2/8) in the RUX arm and the 
BAT arm, respectively, showed a PR response. The odds ratio in subgroup adolescent patients were 
inconclusive due to the low number of evaluable patients.

Baseline organ involvement are overall balanced between the two treatment arms, with the exception 
of lung involvement (42.4% in the RUX arm and 29.9% in the BAT arm). Response assessments, i.e., 
responders at Cycle 7 Day 1, generally shows a higher response rate for all assessed organs in the 
RUX arm compared to the BAT arm.

Cross-over population 
At the primary analysis data cut-off (last patient enrolled could have reached the Cycle 7 Day 1 visit), 
61 patients had crossed over from the BAT arm and started treatment with ruxolitinib, and treatment 
with ruxolitinib was still ongoing for 46 patients [Study D2301 PA Table 10-2]. Since not all of the 46 
ongoing patients have reached the Cross-over Cycle 7 day 1 visit at the data cut-off, the analysis was 
performed again with longer follow-up based on the data cut-off 25-Jun-2021 used for the later OS 
analysis performed. In total 69 patients crossed-over from BAT to ruxolitinib; 33 of these patients had 
a response at cross-over Cycle 7 Day 1 corresponding to ORR of 47.8% (95% CI: 35.6%, 60.2%). 
Overall, these results indicate a clinical benefit of ruxolitinib treatment also for SRcGvHD patients who 
failed treatment with BAT. 
Secondary efficacy results 
Failure free survival 
The first key secondary endpoint, FFS, assessed the time from date of randomization to the earliest of 
i) relapse or recurrence of underlying disease or death due to underlying disease, ii.) non-relapse 
mortality, or iii.) addition or initiation of another systemic therapy for cGvHD 
The study met the key secondary efficacy endpoint FFS at the interim analysis, with a HR of 0.315 
(95% CI: 0.205, 0.486; one-sided p-value = <0.0001).

Kaplan-Meier estimate of failure free survival (Full analysis set –Primary analysis) 
The superiority of FFS in the RUX arm compared to BAT was maintained at the primary analysis (n = 
329), with HR=0.370 (95% CI: 0.268, 0.510; descriptive one-sided p<0.0001. The 6-month FFS 
probability was 74.89% (95% CI: 67.48, 80.85) in the RUX arm and was 44.46% (95% CI: 36.46, 
52.14) in the BAT arm. The median FFS time was not reached for RUX and was 5.7 months for BAT.  
Kaplan-Meier estimate of failure free survival (Full analysis set – Primary analysis) 
A pronounced drop in the BAT curve is seen around month 6, supposedly triggered by cross over from 
BAT to RUX treatment. Patients in the BAT arm could cross over not earlier than Cycle 7 Day 1 visit 
and only if they were non-responders.  
The FFS endpoint is a composite of (i) relapse or recurrence of underlying disease or death due of 
underlying disease, (ii) non-relapse mortality, or (iii) addition or initiation of another systemic therapy 
for cGvHD. As anticipated, this endpoint is driven by item (iii), while there is no indication of any 
impact of treatment on items (i) and (ii). The data are generated in an open-label study, where the 
impact of the cross-over option results in a precipitate fall in the KM curve for the control arm. 
However, this key secondary endpoint, shows statistical significance (HR of 0.315 (95% CI: 0.205, 
0.486; one-sided p-value = <0.0001) in favor of ruxolitinib. The other items; NMR and MR, both each 
other’s competing risk, had the similar cumulative incidence, hence gain in the one was not at the cost 
of the other.

Total symptom score, TSS; Patient reported outcomes based on the total symptom score 
The second key secondary endpoint TSS, (rate of responders as per improvement ≥7 points of total 
TSS from baseline of the modified Lee Symptom Scale (mLSS), did not meet statistical significance 
(stratified CMH test p = 0.0151) during the interim analysis (based on N = 196). The results from the 
primary analysis are shown below.

Responders at Cycle 7 Day 1 based on the TSS by the mLSS (Full analysis set– Primary 
analysis) 
Significant improvement in TSS, (cycle 7 day 1) was shown for the RUX arm compared to the BAT arm 
at the primary analysis. The odds ratio (ruxolitinib/BAT) was 2.62 (95% CI: 1.42, 4.82, stratified CMH 
test, p = 0.0011).  
Given the significant impact of symptoms on quality of life (QoL) in patients with cGvHD, the change in 
a modified Lee symptom score was assessed as one of the key secondary objectives. However, given 
the open label nature of the study, there is a risk of bias that cannot be ascertained as to its 
magnitude. 
Therefore, TSS data are not included in the product information. 
•  Other secondary endpoints 
Best overall response 
BOR is defined as proportion of patients who achieved overall response (CR or PR) at any time point up 
to and including Cycle 7 Day 1 and before the start of additional systemic therapy for cGvHD. There 
was a statistically significant difference between the ruxolitinib and BAT (stratified CMH test p=0.0011, 
one-sided) with the odds ratio 2.17 (95% CI: 1.34, 3.52) for response in ruxolitinib arm compared to 
BAT arm. The rate of Non-responders in the RUX arm was 18.2% vs 28% in the BAT arm. 
Best overall response up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (Full analysis set)  
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 104/177 
 
 
 
 
 
BOR up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (RUX arm 76.4% vs BAT arm 60.4%) compared to the primary endpoint ORR 
at Cycle 7 Day 1 (RUX arm 49.7% vs BAT arm 25.6%) show a greater rate of loss of responses in the 
BAT arm than the RUX arm.  
While there is a high BOR rate (ORR [CR + PR] at any time point up to and including Cycle 7 Day 1) 
observed in both treatment arms, it is also noticed a relatively high rate of “lost responses” during the 
first 6 cycles (ruxolitinib and BAT treatment) as measured by the primary endpoint (i.e. ORR at Cycle 
7, Day 1). However, early discontinuation, deaths, changes in systemic cGvHD treatment before Cycle 
7 Day 1 or missing visits were the main reasons for the differences in BOR and ORR therefore, not 
necessarily meaning loss of response in all cases or treatment failure. For the RUX arm, 34.9% with 
BOR (CR or PR) had `no response´ at Cycle 7 D1 and the corresponding number for the BAT arm was 
57.5%. 
In addition, the probability of maintaining a response 12 months from the first documented response 
was 68.5% in the RUX arm and 40.3% in the BAT arm. 
Best overall response during Cross-over treatment with ruxolitinib 
In the Cross-over analysis set, 44 out of 61 patients had a duration of exposure to ruxolitinib longer 
than 24 weeks, i.e., completed 6 cycles of treatment. The ORR for the cross-over treatment period was 
78.7% compared to 74.4% ORR for the RUX arm in the randomized treatment period.  
Overall survival 
At the time of primary analysis there were 31 deaths in the RUX arm and 27 deaths in the BAT arm 
(based on Cycle 7 Day 1 data). No statistical difference was observed between the arms (HR = 1.086 
(95% CI: 0.648, 1.820), (log-rank p-value: 0.3764). The median OS estimated by Kaplan-Meier (K-M) 
was not reached at time of the analysis in either treatment arm.

Given the study design, OS is primarily viewed as a safety endpoint. OS data are rather immature at 
the primary endpoint. An updated analysis of OS data has also been provided.

Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival  
The results remain immature, as is expected in the setting of cGvHD. Updated HR for OS shows a HR 
just below 1 (0.956 vs. 1.086 with previous analysis) with a CI still crossing 1. Updated results for 
primary cause of death did not show any new safety signals compared to the primary analysis results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022

It is agreed that a detrimental effect on OS of ruxolitinib cannot be concluded based on available 
immature data. Mature OS data should be submitted post-marketing. 
The allowance of cross-over creates a bias towards unity with regards to the impact of treatment on 
OS. In REACH-3 study, 61 (37.2%) of 164 subjects switched from BAT to ruxolitinib after completion 
of Cycle 6. The rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) model was applied post-hoc to 
investigate what would have been the OS analysis had patients not crossed over to ruxolitinib. After 
adjustment for cross-over with the RPSFT model, the HR estimate was 0.967 (95% CI: 0.692, 1.352) 
compared to 0.956 (95% CI: 0.604, 1.512) obtained in the pre-planned ITT analysis. Thus, the RPSFT 
results do not indicate any impact of cross-over on overall survival.  
Duration of Response 
DOR was only measured in patients who achieved a CR or PR at or before Cycle 7 Day 1 (BOR). Median 
DOR was not reached in the RUX arm, while median DOR in the BAT arm was 6.2 months (95% CI: 
4.7 to 13.3). Furthermore, the 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months probability of maintaining a response, was 
in favor of the RUX arm.

Non-relapse mortality 
NRM curves for the RUX and BAT arms were overlapping (cumulative incidence) indicating similar 
event rates over time. The competing risk (hematological disease relapse/progression) was low in both 
treatment arms (9/165 and 8/164).  
The number of patients censored was high in both treatment arms (129/165 and 134/164), indicating 
a high proportion of patients who were alive and had no relapse/progression. 
Cumulative incidence of Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM) by treatment (Full analysis set) 
Incidence of Malignancy Relapse/ Recurrence 
There were 156 patients in the ruxolitinib arm and 160 patients in the BAT arm who had underlying 
malignant disease at baseline. With regard to these patients, events of malignancy relapse/progression 
were low in both arms (9/156 in the ruxolitinib arm; 8/160 in the BAT arm).  
Estimated cumulative event rates were 2.59% (95%CI: 0.85, 6.08) and 2.65% (95%CI: 0.87, 6.21) in 
respective treatment arms at 6 months and 4.94% (95%CI: 2.16, 9.45) and 5.80% (95%CI: 2.68, 
10.65) at 12 months. Thus, indicating that the choice of cGvHD treatment has little or no significance 
for malignancy relapse, however data are still immature.

Reduction of daily corticosteroid dose and successful tapering of all corticosteroids 
treatment 
Tapering of corticosteroids was not recommended before 2 weeks after achieving a CR and tapering of 
CNI and/or ruxolitinib was not to be initiated until the patient was off corticosteroids and completed 
the assessments for Cycle 7 Day 1. 
A comparable proportion of patients in both treatment arms had prior systemic therapy with steroids + 
CNI (RUX arm: 41.2%, BAT arm: 42.1%). As a consequence of successful tapering of steroids, 
subsequent tapering of CNI was to be initiated.  
During the time interval of Day 155 to Day 168 (end of Cycle 6), patients with≥ 50% reduction of 
corticosteroid dose (body weight-normalized) from baseline occurred in 71.2% (84 out of 118) of 
patients in the ruxolitinib arm and in 69.6% (80 out of 115) of patients in the BAT arm. The mean 
dose intensity of steroid was lower in ruxolitinib than BAT, starting from Cycle 2 and the trend of 
slightly larger reduction of steroid dose in the ruxolitinib arm remained during the study. 
Patients with no steroids during the interval occurred in 31.4% (37) of patients in the RUX arm and 
27.8% (32) of patients in the BAT arm.

Data concerning duration of CNI treatment and change of CNI exposure by time interval up to Cycle 7 
Day 1, by treatment arm and by type of CNI treatment (Cyclosporin or Tacrolimus) has been provided, 
showing similar exposure, between the arms, over time.  
Patient-reported outcomes (FACT-BMT and EQ-5D-5L) and Patient reported outcomes – 
PGIS and PGIC  
Although not defined as secondary endpoint, results of EQ-5D-5L and FACT-BMT questionnaires were 
presented. Completion rates as a percentage of available patients were similar between the two arms 
throughout the study.  
Baseline scores were similar between both treatment arms. Higher scores of FACT-BMT assessment 
suggested a better the quality of life. The mean (SD) change from baseline at Cycle 7 Day 1 of the 
FACT-BMT score was 3.76 (15.028) in the RUX arm (n = 91) and 0.66 (16.816) in the BAT arm (n = 
86). Change of EQ-5D-5L score from baseline was similar between the two arms, 0.07 (0.233) in the 
Rux arm (n = 90) vs. 0.00 (0.226) in the BAT arm (n = 84).

At Cycle 7 Day 1 visit, Patient global impression of severity (PGIS) values from patients that reported 
moderate, severe and very severe symptoms reduced as compared to Cycle 1 Day 1 in both arms. The 
PGIS values were lower in the RUX arm as compared to the BAT arm. The values for no and mild 
symptoms increased from Cycle 1 Day 1 visit. 
Patient global impression of change (PGIC) values from patients, that reported “No change” at Cycle 2 
Day 1, reduced at Cycle 7 Day 1 in the RUX arm from 20.9% to 7.1% and in the BAT arm from 28.6% 
to 22.4%. Numerically higher values of “moderately better” and “very much better” were reported in 
the RUX arm as compared to that in the BAT arm. 
FACT-BMT up to Cycle 7, Day 1, measuring the mean change from baseline, a higher score suggests a 
better QoL. The mean change from baseline in the RUX arm is scores higher than that of the BAT arm.

Data from the mLSS scoring (please refer to key secondary endpoint) is by comparison of greater 
importance since this is a validated tool for cGvHD assessment.  
The EQ-5D-5L mean score change from baseline up to Cycle 7 Day 1 was similar between both 
treatment arms. 
There was a decrease in number of patients available for evaluation with time in both arms and more 
reduced in the BAT arm, due to a higher number of FFS event in the BAT arm and to cross over, which 
was allowed after Cycle 7 Day 1. 
The The EQ-5D-5L and FACT-BMT were secondary endpoints and PGIC and PGIS were exploratory 
endpoints. The study was an open label study and none of these endpoints were controlled for 
multiplicity.  
In summary, the PRO outcomes for the RUX arm compared to the BAT arm are difficult to evaluate.  
Graft failure (Chimerism) 
Only one patient, in the RUX arm, experienced graft failure and subsequently discontinued from study 
treatment, due to graft loss. 
Summary of main studies 
The following table summarise the efficacy results from the two main studies supporting the present 
application in aGvHD and cGvHD. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion 
on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
aGvHD In Study C2301, 5 adolescents were treated with RUX and 4 with BAT, with a median age of 
15 (range 12-16) in the RUX arm. ORR was 80.0% (4/5) with RUX vs. 75.0% (3/4) with BAT. A total 
of 60% (3/5) patients in RUX arm and 75% (3/4) patients in BAT arm achieved a CR, and 20% (1/5) 
patients in RUX arm achieved a PR. 
cGvHD In Study D2301, 4 adolescents were treated with RUX (youngest 13 years) and 8 with BAT. It 
is reassuring that responses with RUX were observed in 3 (75%, PR) out of 4 adolescents in the RUX 
arm. In comparison: 2 out of 8 adolescents (25%) in the BAT arm had a partial response up to Cycle 7 
Day 1. 
The inclusion of adolescents in REACH-2 and REACH-3 was based on an extrapolation concept as 
described in the EMA reflection paper (2017). The inclusion of adolescents was based on the following 
rationale:

• 
The disease manifestation and progression of GvHD as well as treatment options are similar in 
adolescents and adults; 
• 
• 
Evidence for children treated with ruxolitinib already existed;  
Given the maturation of the cytochrome P450 system, the metabolism of ruxolitinib in 
adolescents is similar to that of adults; 
• 
Non-clinical toxicity studies did not identify toxicities that would be expected in adolescents. 
The use of the same dose (10 mg BID) in adolescents as in adult patients was supported by safety and 
PK data of ruxolitinib from a Phase I study in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies (Loh 
et al 2015). As the exposure-response relationship was expected to be the same for adolescents and 
adults with GvHD, both allometric scaling and PBPK modelling approaches suggested that the dose for 
adolescents required to obtain similar exposure in terms of AUC and Cmax was similar to that of adults 
(20 mg BID in adults would constitute 16-18 mg BID in adolescents). In fact, the exposure in 
adolescents enrolled in REACH-2 and REACH-3 was in the range of the adult exposure. It was also 
shown that although BSA is a significant covariate, no clinically meaningful differences are to be 
expected in patients with a lower BSA such as adolescents. 
Efficacy and safety were also expected to be similar between adolescents and adults with GvHD. 
Detrimental effects by ruxolitinib on bone formation and structure were not observed in toxicology 
safety studies using animals with a human equivalent age ≥ 12 years. Bone density measurement by 
dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) were therefore not performed in REACH-2. In REACH-3, 
there was no clinically relevant change in bone mineral density in adolescents enrolled in the ruxolitinib 
arm. Overall, the safety profile was confirmed to be similar between adults and adolescents enrolled in 
REACH-2 and REACH-3 studies. No concerns with bone abnormalities were seen.  
The rationale for extrapolation of adult data to adolescents has been adequately discussed based on 
disease manifestation, mode of action, non-clinical data, PK data and (expected) clinical efficacy and 
safety; and is acceptable. 
In the product information, the recommended dose for paediatric patients with GvHD aged 12 years 
and older is the same as in adults, based on pivotal trials REACH 2 and REACH 3. The safety and 
efficacy of RUX have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age. The BSA dependent 
exposure is commented on in the PK section. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Elderly 
No specific dose adjustments are recommended in the product information for elderly patients. 
Renal impairment 
In line with the existing recommendation for other indications, no specific dose adjustments are 
included in the product information for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. In patients 
with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) the recommended starting 
dose GvHD patients is 5 mg twice daily (in line with existing recommendations for patients with PV). 
Please refer to PK section of this report for raised uncertainty regarding this recommendation. There 
are limited data to determine the best dosing options for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
on haemodialysis. For GvHD patients the recommended starting dose with ESRD on haemodialysis is a 
single dose of 10 mg or two doses of 5 mg given 12 hours apart, to be administered post-dialysis and 
only on the day of haemodialysis. This recommendation is similar to PV patients. No data is available 
for dosing patients who are undergoing peritoneal dialysis or continuous venovenous haemofiltration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 116/177 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Dose adjustments have been recommended in the product information for PV and MF patients. 
However, in patients with GvHD, mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment was not found to have a 
significant impact on any parameter in the population pharmacokinetic model. Therefore, no starting 
dose adjustment is recommended for GvHD patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment, including liver GvHD. Please refer to PK section of this report for raised uncertainty 
regarding this conclusion. It is acknowledged that for patients with GvHD liver involvement and an 
increase of total bilirubin to >3 x ULN, a recommendation has been included in the product information 
to monitor blood counts more frequently for toxicity and to consider a dose reduction by one dose 
level.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
There are no data from the use of RUX in pregnant or lactating woman. Animal studies have shown 
that RUX is embryotoxic and foetotoxic. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have 
shown excretion of RUX and its metabolites in milk. As a precautionary measure, the use of Rux during 
pregnancy and lactation is contraindicated.  
2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has applied for a full marketing approval for the selective inhibitor of Janus Kinases 
(JAKs), JAK1 and JAK2, Jakavi (ruxolitinib) for the indication  
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with acute graft 
versus host disease or chronic graft versus host disease who have inadequate response to 
corticosteroids or other systemic therapies (see section 5.1). 
Since the initially proposed indication (Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of patients with graft 
versus host disease aged 12 years and older who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other 
systemic therapies) differentiation of the two clinical settings (acute and chronic GvHD) has been 
implemented and refence to section 5.1 of the SmPC has been added to allow complementation of the 
concise indication with some further relevant information for the Health care professionals using 
ruxolitinib. 
Overall, the eligibility criteria and exclusion criteria were acceptable for both studies 
Ruxolitinib dose - For both main studies dose and regimen were based on data from published data on 
preliminary efficacy and safety generated in patients with SR GvHD and from the supportive phase II 
study INCB 18424-271 (REACH-1) SR aGvHD. In addition, publications have shown that adolescents 
have similar toxicity profiles, maximum tolerated doses, and PK parameters compared to adults. A 10 
mg b.i.d. dose in adolescents is expected to provide a similar exposure as 10 mg b.i.d. dosing in 
adults. The dose-selection seems overall to be adequate, however, exposure is dependent on BSA, 
please refer to PK section. 
GvHD type and grade – Patients with higher grade acute and chronic GvHD were included in the pivotal 
trials with grading determined according to well established criteria. Patients with Grade I aGvHD or 
mild cGvHD were not eligible. In clinical practice these patients would rarely be offered (second or 
higher line) systemic treatment. Moreover, responses observed across GvHD stages did not indicate 
worse outcomes with lower grades. It is therefore considered acceptable not to specify the grade in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 117/177 
 
 
 
indication. For details with regard to GvHD grade and type (acute or chronic) of the studied population, 
a reference to SmPC section 5.1 is included in the indication.  
Line of treatment – Patients that had received more than one systemic treatment for SR GvHD were 
excluded, so eligible patients were in need of first- or second-line treatment for SR GvHD. The majority 
of aGvHD patients in Study C2301 (>93%) and cGvHD patients in Study D2301 (>54%) used 
corticosteroids and other prior systemic therapy for GvHD. The used definitions of steroid 
refractoriness are acceptable although this also referred to steroid-dependent patients, i.e., patients 
that were unable to taper corticosteroids but still responded to corticosteroids. It is reassuring that 
steroid-dependent patients were included with similar frequencies in both treatment arms (~28%). For 
acute GvHD, the definition of steroid dependency was stricter than currently recommended by the 
EBMT−NIH−CIBMTR Task Force position statement (Schoemans et al 2018). It could therefore be 
anticipated that a broader population of steroid-dependent aGvHD patients will be offered RUX 
treatment in clinical practice for which efficacy of ruxolitinib has not been established. Considering the 
persistent sensitivity to steroids in the steroid-dependent subgroup, it is anticipated that response 
rates in these patients will at least be similar compared to responses in steroid refractory patients or 
overall population. A cross reference in the indication to section 5.1 of the product information is 
provided, allowing prior and concomitant treatments in the studied population and used definitions of 
steroid refractoriness and dependency, to be captured in a concise indication.  
Missing information - Due to exclusion criteria for both pivotal trials, efficacy in patients with overlap 
syndrome or transition from active aGvHD to cGvHD without tapering off corticosteroids ± CNI and any 
systemic treatment is unknown. Efficacy in acute or chronic GvHD after pre-emptive treatment of 
malignancy recurrence with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and in patients who did not tolerate 
steroid treatment is unknown as well. This is specified in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Protocol deviations - In REACH-2, protocol deviations were observed in approximately 86% in both 
treatment arms. The most common deviation category was ‘other deviations’ (~63% in both arms). It 
has been clarified that the overall pattern of the most frequent subcategories of ‘other deviations’ was 
comparable between the two treatment arms in both studies, with the exception of PD ‘organ staging 
assessment done per investigator criteria/judgement rather Harris’, where there was a lower 
proportion of patients with recorded PD in the ruxolitinib arm (18.8%) compared to the BAT arm 
(34.2%) in REACH2. However, for key time points (baseline, Day 28 and Day 56) these were reported 
with low and similar rates. The additional supportive analyses for both studies with a subset of the 
patients in the FAS who were compliant with the requirements of the clinical study protocol indicated 
similar results to that observed with the FAS. No other imbalances in subcategories ‘other deviations’ 
have been observed.  
In REACH-3, protocol deviations were observed in 213 (64.7%) patients overall (63.0% in ruxolitinib 
arm and 66.5% in BAT arm). The most common deviation category was “Other deviations” (32.7% 
and 37.2%). Which included (ruxolitinib arm vs. BAT arm): Lee Symptom Scale not collected (13.9% 
vs. 17.1%); HBV and/or HCV viral load testing value missing at Cycle 1 Day 1 (9.7% vs. 7.9%); other 
deviations caused by COVID-19 pandemic as provided in Section 10.7. 
A GCP inspection, proposed by the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur due to the concerns raised by the 
high numbers of protocol deviations, has been performed. The scope of the inspection were 
documentation and results concerning the consistency of reported data with source documents, 
protocol deviations relating to e.g., staging/grading of graft versus host disease (GvHD), response 
assessment and use of prohibited medication, and reporting of the data. Moreover, the compliance 
with ICH-GCP and applicable regulations was to be verified, in particular where it had an impact on the 
validity of the data.

In total, the inspection revealed twelve major findings and one critical finding. None of the findings 
could be directly related to the specific triggers. The only critical finding concerned the violation of 
patients’ rights; race and ethnicity were captured in the electronic case report form (eCRF) without a 
sound rationale in the study protocols. This finding is considered as non-compliance to ICH-GCP and 
for the EU trial participants not in accordance with the GDPR.  
During inspection, it was observed that a significant number of important protocol deviations (PDs) 
occurred due to lack of clarity of the study protocol and its amendments. The process for PD 
management was not robust enough and should have been improved earlier in order to enhance a 
timely resolution. 
Mostly due to occurrence of PDs, for the REACH 2 clinical trial, 56 (36.4%) trial participants in the 
ruxolitinib arm and 68 (43.9%) in the BAT arm were excluded from the per protocol set. For the 
REACH 3 clinical trial 69 (41.8%) trial participants in the ruxolitinib arm and 72 (43.9%) trial 
participants in the BAT arm were excluded from the per protocol set. 
Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of some of these PDs on primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints as defined in the statistical analysis plans and reported in the respective 
clinical study reports. The results of these sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the primary 
analysis.  
mLSS - The second key secondary endpoint Total symptom score, TSS (rate of responders from 
baseline of the modified Lee Symptom Scale [mLSS]) was not validated prior to start of the trial and 
data are derived from an open-label study. The risk of bias due to this, cannot be measured or 
determined. Furthermore, it did not meet statistical significance during the interim analysis. The 
Applicant has agreed not to include the results in the SmPC, as requested by the Rapporteurs  
BAT - The sponsor did not require documentation as detailed for BAT as for IMP (investigational 
medical products). The classification of IMP or non-IMP in EU member states is based on the local 
implementation in national law of Directive 2001/20/EC, which provides the definition. However, also 
for these, certain minimum documentation requirements apply. As the documentation requirement of 
the Sponsor failed to assure for non-IMP appropriate traceability and compliance, even these lower 
standards were not fulfilled.  
In the worst scenario for the REACH-2, 12% of the trial participants and for the REACH-3, 41% of the 
trial participants receiving BAT, treatment compliance was not/insufficiently monitored. 
The approximately 12% of patients without drug accountability for BAT in acute GvHD Study REACH-2 
still allows sufficient interpretation of clinical study results, as impact is considered low. 
For BAT in chronic GvHD study REACH-3, max 41% of patients had no data on drug accountability. 
Novartis conducted additional exploratory analyses to assess the primary efficacy response of the 
different types of BATs. This is possible as at any time point, patients in the BAT arm were 
administered one single BAT on top of the backbone therapy of corticosteroids and CNI.  
Importantly, it is considered unlikely that all 41% of BAT treated patients were indeed non-compliant 
considering the severity of symptoms and known positive impact of the BAT treatment for patients. 
However, it cannot be excluded that (a proportion of the) patients in the BAT arm, or their treating 
physicians preferred a switch from BAT to Jakavi in this open label study as Jakavi was already 
prescribed off label in clinical practice and anticipated to be more active. This physician’s/patient’s 
preference, could have, in a worst-case scenario, influenced BAT treatment compliance in order to urge 
a cross-over to the ruxolitinib arm and thereby potentially have influenced treatment outcomes for 
ORR and durability of response.  
ORR was measured at Cycle 7 Day 1, prior to the possibility for BAT treated patients to cross-over to 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 119/177 
 
 
 
ruxolitinib. Now ORR results have been provided per BAT, and the observed ORR for each individual 
BAT is lower than the response rate reported in patients treated with ruxolitinib, regardless of the 
administration route and/or clinical setting i.e., in hospital versus at home. Importantly, the in-hospital 
BATs, which have high drug accountability (due to the setting), and the at-home BATs showed similar 
ORR per BAT. These exploratory results together are suggestive of a limited (if any) impact of the 
potential lower BAT compliance (worst case) in the at-home setting.  
Regarding the time to event endpoints, demonstration of at least non-detriment in OS is considered 
necessary for registration in cGvHD, as discussed in the previous rounds of assessment.  
As OS is multifactorial, for which BAT compliance is only one parameter of interest, it remains difficult 
to establish whether potential non-compliance in the BAT arm has substantially influenced OS 
outcomes. It is reassuring that with the latest OS update no sign of detriment was observed.  
Finally, even if outcomes would have been comparable to BAT, ruxolitinib could still be acceptable as 
new treatment modality for chronic GvHD. Therefore, despite some remaining uncertainties on the 
impact of potential non-compliance on the efficacy results due to the exploratory nature of the 
additional analyses, the B/R of ruxolitinib is considered positive in chronic GvHD as well. 
It is, however, acknowledged that patients with GvHD enrolled in the studies per study protocols were 
treated according to institutional guidelines, which represents local standard of care in real world 
practice. Transplanted patients are closely monitored by designated and experienced physicians 
working in specialized transplant units.  
In summary, it can be concluded that in general the conduct of the REACH 2 and REACH 3 clinical trials 
was partially ICH-GCP compliant. Nevertheless, despite the deviation described with respect to ethics 
and patients´ rights in the inspections report, the REACH 2 and REACH 3 clinical trials were still 
considered to be conducted within internationally accepted ethical standards. The inspectors 
considered the data of the REACH 2 and REACH 3 clinical trials, as reported in the interim CSRs, to be 
acceptable and the impact of the use of the non-validated mLSS and the mostly lacking documentation 
on BAT accountability and treatment compliance on the benefit-risk balance is referred to the 
assessors. 
According to the inspectors, the observed findings are unlikely to have a significant impact on data 
integrity within the inspected clinical trials. The inspection team did not identify any restrictions on the 
usability of the reported trial data, and therefore it was the recommendation of the inspectors that the 
data of the REACH-2 and REACH-3 clinical trials could be used for evaluation and assessment of the 
application. The Rapporteurs shares this view and therefore concludes that the findings are unlikely to 
have had any significant impact on the benefit-risk balance with regard to both aGvHD and cGvHD. 
Endpoints - ORR at day 28 after starting treatment in aGvHD and 6-month ORR in cGvHD patients are 
acceptable primary endpoints. Start of additional therapy before the primary endpoint is reached is 
considered non-response (composite strategy) and so is missing data. By design, only the primary 
endpoints (ORR at day 28 for aGvHD or ORR at cycle 7 day 1 for cGvHD) cannot be affected by cross-
over. Cross-over changes the interpretation of other endpoints and is handled by treatment policy. This 
may bias the effect compared to the situation when cross-over had not occurred. Under the 
assumption that RUX still has effect after BAT, the estimate will be conservative. Planned cross-over 
impacts the possibility to have reliable long-term efficacy data but should at least indicate no 
detrimental effect.  
Censoring - Information with regard to censoring and competing risk for each of the endpoints was 
summarized on request. The definitions were largely the same for REACH2 and REACH3, except for 
DoR and FFS where onset of cGvHD was a competing event (in REACH2). These are more supportive 
than pivotal endpoints, so this is not critical for the B/R. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 120/177 
 
 
 
Statistical analysis methods - The statistical tests and analysis models were standard. Multiple testing 
procedures used control the type I error adequately. Of note: in aGvHD Study C2301, only the primary 
endpoint ORR at Day 28 and key secondary endpoint ORR at Day 56 were formally tested. In cGvHD 
Study D2301, the primary endpoint ORR at Cycle 7 Day 1 and key secondary endpoints FFS and Lee 
Symptom Score were formally tested. This D2301 study also included an interim analysis, at which the 
hypotheses for the first two endpoints (primary + FFS) were already rejected.  
BAT subgroups – The choice of BAT, were the patient to be randomized to the BAT arm, was decided 
before randomisation. Results per the particular BATs have been provided. Furthermore, the BAT 
accountability has been described and commented on in the inspection report as reported above. 
Changes during the study - Most notably in both study REACH 2 and REACH 3 a data monitoring 
committee was added during the trial conduct (this was late in the study conduct of REACH 2, to 
address the Study Steering Committee’s request to be informed on the balance of safety events 
between treatment arms, while maintain blinding of the Study Steering Committee; and early in 
REACH 3). This is not considered to impact the results or interpretation of the endpoints. The analysis 
plans were not changed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy results for INC424C2301, aGvHD REACH-2 
Baseline characteristics –Overall, baseline characteristics were generally comparable between 
treatment arms and reflect a steroid refractory/steroid dependent population in need of first- or 
second-line systemic treatment (after first line corticosteroids) for aGvHD. 
Response rates - REACH-2 demonstrated a statistically significant higher ORR (primary endpoint) for 
patients in the RUX arm (62.3%) compared with those in the BAT arm (39.4%) (Odds ratio [HR] 2.64; 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65, 4.22; p < 0.0001), thus meeting the primary endpoint, ORR 
(CR+PR) at Day 28. The primary endpoint results were confirmed by an analysis using PPS with an 
ORR at Day 28 of 63.9% in the ruxolitinib arm and 39.1% in the BAT arm. Furthermore, the 
robustness of primary endpoint results was confirmed by sensitivity analysis performed without 
stratification factor using the Fisher’s exact method with an ORR at Day 28 (Odds ratio: 2.55; 95% CI: 
1.61, 4.03). 
Improvements in signs and symptoms were observed across all organs involved for aGvHD (skin, liver, 
lower GI and upper GI) at Day 28; these improvements were more pronounced in the ruxolitinib arm 
than in the BAT arm.  
Cross over population - Among the 49 patients who crossed over to RUX treatment between Day 28 
and Week 24, the ORR at Crossover Day 28 was consistent with the primary analysis in the RUX arm: 
67.3% (95% CI: 52.5, 80.1). The CR rate was higher compared with the primary analysis: 46.9%. 
The key secondary endpoint, durable ORR at Day 56 (proportion of patients that achieved response at 
Day 28 and maintained their response up to Day 56) showed statistically significant higher response 
rate in the RUX arm (39.6%) compared to the BAT arm (21.9%) (Odds ratio of 2.38, 95% CI: 1.43, 
3.94; p=0.0005). Analysis of durable ORR at Day 56 using PPS was consistent with that observed 
using FAS. 
Time-dependent endpoints - The magnitude of ORR and durability of response indicate activity of RUX. 
No nominally statistically significant differences in OS, EFS or NRM were observed, but results are 
impacted by the large proportion of cross-over from BAT to RUX (31.6%). It is acknowledged that 
results suggest no detrimental effect either and median OS and EFS were still numerically longer in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 121/177 
 
 
 
RUX arm (primary analysis OS: 11.14 vs. 6.47 months with BAT; EFS: 8.28 vs. 4.17 months). Given 
the high ORR in RUX after BAT (see cross-over population), it also seems reasonable to assume that 
RUX has beneficial effects after BAT. For FFS, where addition of new systemic aGvHD treatment was 
defined as event, results obtained were numerically in favour of RUX (4.99 months vs. 1.02 months 
with BAT; HR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.60), but this endpoint was not part of the confirmatory testing 
strategy. The favourable effect on FFS is largely driven by less additional systemic therapy for aGvHD 
in the ruxolitinib arm.  
Subgroups - Responses were observed across all included aGvHD severities, all categories of SR 
refractoriness/dependency and most combinations of prior therapies (steroid only, steroid + CNI, and 
most subgroups with prior steroid + CNI + other systemic treatment). In some subgroups, firm 
conclusions regarding efficacy cannot be drawn. considering the limited number of patients in these 
respective subgroups. For elderly, OR point estimate approximates to 1 suggesting similar efficacy of 
RUX and BAT. Even if this would be the case, RUX might still offer a valuable (registered and well 
characterized) treatment option that does not seem to come with additional risks compared to BAT but 
provides an alternative option with a different safety profile. 
cGvHD - A higher proportion of patients in the RUX arm developed chronic GvHD (29.2% vs. 18.7% 
secondary analysis, 24.7% vs. 16.8% primary analysis) in the context of similar/better competing 
events (MR and NMR) for RUX. It is acknowledged that this primarily concerned lower grade events, 
and RUX treatment was not continued for cGvHD or overlap syndrome in the clinical trial.  
Supportive study 271 
Single arm, open-label Phase II study 271 provided supportive data in SR acute GvHD. The study 
included 71 patients with Grade II-IV SR acute GvHD that had received corticosteroids alone or in 
combination with 1 or more additional agents as first-line therapy for aGVHD. RUX treatment started 
at a lower 5 mg b.i.d. dose. Results for the primary endpoint ORR at day 28 (56.3%) were in line with 
results for RUX in the confirmatory Phase 3 trial (62.3%). Median OS was lower (232 days, ~7.6 
months) than observed in the pivotal trial (11.14 months), but the RUX dose in this supportive trial 
was lower and a non-detrimental effect vs. BAT has been confirmed in the Phase 3 Study REACH-2 
(C2301). 
Efficacy results for the Pivotal study, INC424D2301, cGvHD REACH-3 
Baseline characteristics –Overall, baseline characteristics were generally comparable between 
treatment arms and reflect a steroid refractory/steroid-dependent population in need of first- or 
second-line systemic treatment (after first line corticosteroids) for cGvHD.  
Responses - At the time of the Primary Analysis, the median duration of study follow-up (from 
randomization to the data cut-off date) was approximately 13 months.  
The proportion of patients achieving response (CR or PR) at the interim analysis at Cycle 7 Day 1 in 
the RUX arm (50.5%) compared to the BAT arm (26.3%) was statistically significant, with an odds 
ratio of 2.98 (95% CI: 1.62, 5.48) in favour of the RUX arm. The result was maintained at the primary 
analysis, 49.7% in the RUX arm and 25.6% in the BAT arm; odds ratio of 2.99 (95%CI: 1.86, 4.80) 
(p<0.0001). The primary endpoint results at the PA using FAS, was confirmed for the supportive 
analysis using PPS.  
CR rates were low: 6.7% vs. 3% (RUX vs BAT). While a CR would provide most benefit to patients, it is 
acknowledged that the patient reported outcome (PRO) modified Lee symptom score (response rate 
24.2% vs. 11%) could indicate clinical benefit in cGvHD as well, although interpretation of PRO data is 
hampered by the open-label study design. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 122/177 
 
 
 
Results favouring the RUX arm was seen across majority of pre-defined baseline characteristics and 
prognostic subgroups including gender, race, cGvHD severity (moderate/severe) at randomization, and 
regardless of prior diagnosis of aGvHD (odds ratio >1 for ORR at Cycle 7 Day 1). Since heterogeneity 
in allowed previous as well as concomitant treatment and prophylaxis regimes for GvHD makes it 
difficult to interpret these subgroup results. For REACH-3, only 14 patients (10 in RUX arm vs. 4 in BAT 
arm) had been enrolled with multiple prior therapies, and consequently ORR subgroup analyses 
showed large confidence intervals. It is acknowledged that it is not possible to draw firm conclusions 
due to the small numbers.  
Cross over population - The ORR at Cycle 7 Day 1 for the cross-over population was slightly lower 
(39.3%) compared to the overall study population at Cycle 7 D1 (49.7%) although results became 
more similar with longer follow-up, 47.8% (at DCO 25-Jun-2021 used for the later OS analysis 
performed). These results suggest that responses can still be obtained for SR-cGvHD patients who 
failed treatment with BAT, to an (almost) similar level as in patients who received RUX for SR-cGvHD 
at an earlier stage. 
The primary key secondary endpoint, FFS, showed a statistically significant difference, at the IA 
(N=196), between the treatment arms, with a HR of 0.315 (95% CI: 0.205, 0.486) (stratified Cox 
model using cGvHD severity at randomization as strata, p-value was <0.0001). Therese results were 
confirmed at the Primary Analysis (HR of 0.370 (95% CI: 0.268, 0.510), p<0.0001). The gain in FFS 
was driven by less change of therapy in the ruxolitinib arm and in lesser extent the other components 
of this composite endpoint, i.e., (i) relapse or recurrence of underlying disease or death due to 
underlying disease and (ii) non-relapse mortality. Of note: no competing risks are defined for FFS in 
this study, facilitating interpretation of the data. NMR and MR, both each other’s competing risk, had 
the similar cumulative incidence, hence gain in the one was not at the cost of the other.  
The second key secondary endpoint, improvement in mLSS score at Cycle 7 Day 1 did not meet 
statistical significance at the Interim Analysis. However, the rate of responders with improvement of ≥ 
7 points in TSS at Cycle 7 Day 1, from baseline reached statistical significance, with 24.2% responders 
in the ruxolitinib arm and 11.0% in the BAT arm (odds ratio of 2.62 (95% CI: 1.42, 4.82) (one-sided 
p=0.0011) in favor of the RUX arm. 
Time-dependent endpoints-. At the primary data cut-off 08 May 2020, OS and NRM medians were not 
reached, and results showed overlapping KM curves. For OS, there was a slightly higher number of 
deaths (n=31, 18.8%) in the RUX arm vs. BAT (n=27 deaths, 16.4%) in the first 6 months of 
treatment, and HR of 1.086 (95% CI: 0.648, 1.820). Updated OS data (25 JUN 2021) is provided, and 
the results remain immature, as is expected in the setting of cGvHD. The updated HR for OS shows a 
HR just below 1 (0.956 vs. 1.086 with previous analysis) with a CI still crossing 1. The updated results 
for primary cause of death did not show any new safety signals compared to the primary analysis 
results. Interpretation of OS analysis is hampered by cross over from the BAT to the RUX arm. A 
detrimental effect on OS of ruxolitinib cannot be concluded based on available immature data. Final OS 
data should be submitted post-marketing.  
2.5.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Both pivotal studies, aGvHD and cGvHD, met their primary endpoints, showing statistical significance 
for the RUX arm compared to the BAT arm in terms of ORR and spared the use of other 
immunosuppressive treatments. This is considered clinical benefit per se, as it is anticipated to be 
associated with a lower symptom burden. Despite ORR not being an established trial-level surrogate 
for long term outcomes, efficacy is considered established.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
All patients who received at least one dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis 
(Safety Set).  
Overview of clinical studies that contributed to safety data 
Sources of safety data and safety presentation 
For this presentation, no pooling of data from the studies was performed due to the differences in the 
study populations, study designs, duration of treatment exposure and frequency, and severity and 
seriousness of AE data observed across the studies during the entire treatment period. 
The study population in acute GvHD and chronic GvHD are different. They differ with regard to aspects 
of the underlying pathophysiology, pathology, clinical manifestations, timing of transplant and disease 
management.  
In addition, the duration of ruxolitinib treatment exposure was longer in chronic GvHD (median 
exposure of 41.4 weeks in REACH-3 study) compared to acute GvHD (median exposure of 8.9 weeks in 
REACH-2, 6.6 weeks in REACH-1). 
Furthermore, the frequency and severity of adverse events was higher in REACH-2 study, compared to 
REACH-3 in both ruxolitinib and comparator arms, as expected in view of the recent transplant 
procedure and its complications in acute GvHD population. In addition, due to the differences in study 
design (single arm and randomized controlled study) and differences in the frequency and severity of 
AEs, REACH-1 and REACH-2 studies were not pooled.

Patient exposure 
Duration of exposure to ruxolitinib in acute and in chronic GvHD (Safety set) 
Exposure to BAT 
Acute GvHD 
Duration of exposure to BAT varied widely. The overall exposure of BAT (total exposure of BAT options 
used in the randomized treatment period) was 19.0 patient years (the median exposure to BAT was 29 
days; range: 1.0 to 188.0). The BAT administered the longest was everolimus, followed by 
extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP).  
Chronic GvHD 
Also, in cGvHD the duration of exposure to the different regimen of BAT varied widely. The overall 
exposure to BAT was 24.1 weeks (range: 0.6 to 108.4) (total exposure of BAT options used in the 
randomized treatment period). The BAT administered the longest was ECP, followed by mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF) The total exposure to ECP was 432.7 patient years. 
Post-marketing exposure 
Ruxolitinib was first approved for treatment of MF on 16-Nov-2011. The estimated cumulative post-
marketing exposure until the end of reporting period of recent PSUR (with data cut-off of 22-Feb-2020) 
was estimated to be 152,580 PTY. 
Due to the differences in study populations in acute GvHD and chronic GvHD the clinical manifestation 
and time elapsed since transplant, the extent of exposure is markedly different between the diagnoses. 
This accounts for both the RUX arm and for the BAT arm.  
Dosage 
RUX - In study REACH-2, the mean RDI up to Days 28 and 56 was 91.2% and 86.7%, with majority of 
patients receiving >90 to 110% of their assigned doses in both epochs. The total daily dose was 20 mg 
in majority of patients up to both Day 28 and Day 56 (99.3%) the majority of patients received a RUX 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 125/177 
 
 
 
 
daily dose of 20 mg during the randomised treatment period (99.3%) and during the crossover period 
(91.8%).  
In the supportive REACH-1 (study 271), per protocol the dosing was lower, 5 mg bid with the 
possibility to increase towards 10 mg b.i.d. The median daily dose received was 10.2 mg (5.1-19.7). 
In study REACH-3, mean RDI (relative dose intensity) for RUX was 87.4% up to Cycle 7 Day 1 and was 
83.4% for the Main treatment period. During the Cross-over period, mean (SD) dose intensity for the 
61 patients was 17.8 (3.53) mg/day and mean RDI for RUX was 88.8%. 
BAT - The safety sets with respect to the BAT arm for study REACH-2 functioning as the comparator 
set for ruxolitinib consist of 9 subsets, also there were 17 patients receiving more than one BAT 
treatment either simultaneously or replacing BAT 1. The safety sets with respect to the BAT arm for 
study REACH-3 consist of 10 subsets, also there were 16 patients receiving more than one BAT 
treatment either simultaneously or replacing the first BAT. 
Dose adjustments for RUX 
aGVHD: Majority of patients required at least one dose change or interruption of RUX (82.9%), and the 
primary reason was AEs (57.2%). Other frequent reasons for dose change or interruption were 
protocol requirements (39.5%), or dose tapering (28.9%), or by physician decision (19.1%). RUX dose 
interruptions occurred in 46.1% patients. In the Cross-over treatment period, all 49 patients had a 
dose change, and 63.3% patients had a dose interruption. Physician decision (91.8%) was the major 
reason for dose changes, followed by dose tapering (69.4%), AEs (61.2%), and per protocol 
requirements (46.9%). The CRFs did not collect the reason for the physician decision and as such the 
reason for dose change or dose interruption cannot be analysed for approximately 20% of the study 
population. Dose reescalation occurred in 38.8% patients, which was allowed as per protocol. Majority 
of patients (79.3%) received only one BAT post-randomisation; 18% of patients received two lines of 
BAT and 2.7% patients received more than 2 lines of BAT. The most common initial BAT administered 
to 27.3% patients was extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP). Other frequently administered BAT was 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (16.7%) and etanercept (14.7%). 
cGvHD: Up to the data cut-off date during the Main treatment period, the majority of patients required 
at least one dose reduction or interruption of RUX (74.5%), and the primary reason was due to AEs 
(47.3%). Other frequent reasons for dose change or interruption were protocol requirements (25.5%), 
physician decision (23.0%) and dose tapering (13.9%). RUX dose changes occurred in 69.1% patients 
and dose interruptions occurred in 43.0% patients. 
During the Crossover treatment period, 52.5% patients required at least one dose reduction or 
interruption of RUX, 47.5% had a dose change, and 31.1% patients had a dose interruption. AEs 
(31.1%) were the major reason for dose changes, followed by physician decision (19.7%). Dose re-
escalation occurred in 9.8% patients, which was allowed as per protocol. The majority of patients 
(80.4%) received only one BAT post-randomisation; 17.7% of patients received two lines of BAT and 
1.9% patients received more than 2 lines of BAT. The most common initial BAT, administered to 55 
(34.8%) patients was ECP, followed by MMF (35, 22.2%) and ibrutinib (27, 17.1%).

In addition, 49 patients randomized to BAT, crossed over to ruxolitinib treatment, whereof 36 (73.5%) 
patients discontinued crossover treatment period, the most common reason for discontinuation was 
AEs (in 24.5% of patients crossed over of whom 27 (55.1%) entered long term follow-up phase.

There were 61 (37.2%) patients initially randomized to BAT that crossed over to ruxolitinib treatment. 
At DCO, 15 (24.6%) patients had discontinued the crossover treatment period with the most common 
reasons AEs and lack of efficacy each in 4 (6.6%) patients. 
Adverse events 
REACH-2 
AEs considered related to the study treatment (all grades/grade ≥3) are considerably more frequent in 
the RUX arm compared to the BAT arm, however, for SAEs the frequencies are more or less similar.  
AEs leading to treatment discontinuations and dose adjustments/interruptions was 11.32% and 36.8% 
in the RUX arm and 4.0% and 9.3% in the BAT arm, displaying a large difference with respect to 
tolerability between the study arms in aGvHD up to Day 28 (primary endpoint). 
Overview of adverse events up to Day 28 visit (Safety set) 
Ruxolitinib treatment up to data cut-off (including cross-over period) show that a majority of the 
patients (98.5%) experienced at least one AE and 66.2% of patients had AEs (all grades) related to 
study treatment. SAEs were reported in 69.2% of patients and treatment related SAEs were reported 
in 26.9% of patients. Fatal SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs leading to dose 
adjustment/interruption occurred in 23.9% of patients, 29.4% of patients, and 53.7% of patients, 
respectively.

Overview of adverse events in acute and chronic GvHD (Safety set) (at time of DCO 
including cross-over) 
Adverse events by system organ class and by PT 
aGvHD:  
In REACH-2, the difference in incidence of all AEs (all grades and grade≥3) between the two treatment 
arms (RUX arm vs. BAT arm) was ≤10% with the exception of blood and lymphatic system disorders 
(all grades: 58.6% vs. 44.7% and grade 3/4 AEs: 47.4% vs. 34.7%). 
The most frequent AEs by SOCs (ruxolitinib treatment up to data cut-off including cross-over period) 
were infections and infestations (78.6% of patients), blood and lymphatic system disorders (69.2% of 
patients). 
The incidence (at least one event) of AE Gr ≥3 was 91% in the RUX overall treatment group of REACH-
2 of and 97.2% in REACH-1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 130/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There was an increase in the cumulative incidence of most AEs by SOC, between Day 28 vs overall 
population in acute GvHD patients receiving ruxolitinib. 
Up to Day 28, the frequently observed AEs by PT (≥20% in either treatment arm) were primarily those 
of cytopenias, including thrombocytopenia (32.9% vs. 18.0%), and anaemia (30.3% vs. 28.0%), 
followed by cytomegalovirus infection (25.7% vs. 20.7%). The difference in incidence of AEs by PT in 
both treatment arms was ≤10%, except for thrombocytopenia which was observed in more patients in 
the RUX arm (32.9%) than in BAT arm (18.0%). Up to the data cut-off date, the frequently observed 
AEs by PT (≥20% in either treatment arm) were those of cytopenias (including anaemia [40.1% vs. 
31.3%], thrombocytopenia [36.2% vs.20.0%], neutropenia [25.0% vs. 14.7%] and platelet count 
decreased [20.4% vs. 16.0%]), followed by cytomegalovirus infection (30.9% vs. 26.7%), oedema 
peripheral (24.3% vs. 21.3%), hypokalaemia (21.1% vs. 18.7%), and pyrexia (20.4% vs. 16.7%). 
The difference in incidence of all AEs by PT in both treatment arms was ≤10%, except for 
thrombocytopenia (36.2% vs. 20.0%) and neutropenia (25.0% vs. 14.7%) which were observed in 
more patients in the RUX arm compared to BAT arm. The incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs by PT was similar 
between the two treatment arms (90.1% vs 86.7%). The grade ≥3 AEs that were more frequent (≥10% 
difference) in RUX arm than BAT arm were anaemia (34.2% vs 24.0%), thrombocytopenia (32.9% vs 
16%) and neutropenia (22.4% vs 12%). The frequent (≥ 5% in either treatment arm) non-
haematological Grade ≥3 AEs by PT (RUX vs BAT) were cytomegalovirus infection (9.2% vs 12.0%), 
hypokalaemia (9.2% vs 11.3%), diarrhoea (6.6% vs 5.3%), hypertension (6.6% vs 4.7%), 
hypoalbuminemia (5.3% vs 6.7%), sepsis (8.6% vs 11.3%) and hypoglycaemia syndrome (3.3% vs 
6.0%).  
Hence, the most pronounced difference (>10%) in AEs between the RUX and the BAT arm up to Day 
28, was seen for thrombocytopenia (all grades and grade ≥3) in aGvHD. There were also more CMV 
infections/reactivations in the RUX arm compared to the BAT arm, 22.4% vs 5.6% (all grades).  
REACH-2 AEs by PT up to DCO 
The most frequent hematological AEs by PT (≥10% of patients) were anemia (37.8%), 
thrombocytopenia (35.3%), and neutropenia (23.4%), platelet count decreased (18.4%), white blood 
cell count decrease (11.9%), and neutrophil count decrease (11.4%).  
Non-hematological AEs reported in ≥15% were hypokalemia (22.4%), cytomegalovirus infection 
reactivation (22.4%), pyrexia (21.4%), edema peripheral (20.9%), and nausea (16.4%). 
Frequent non-hematological AEs by PT (≥10% in either treatment arm) were hypertension (15.8% vs. 
12.7%), pyrexia (15.8% vs. 9.5%) and ALT elevation (15.2% vs. 4.4%), blood creatinine increased 
(13.9% vs 4.4%), pneumonia (10.9% vs 8.9%), cough (10.3% vs 7.0%), diarrhea (10.3% vs 13.3%), 
and fatigue (10.3% vs 7.6%).  
In line with what is a known ADR for ruxolitinib, a higher incidence of CMV infections/reactivation is 
recorded in aGvHD. 
Study 271: Per PT, all patients experienced at least one AE and majority of patients (97.2%) had at 
least one AE grade ≥3. Exposure adjusted incidence of all grade AEs and grade ≥3 AEs were 11950.6 
events/100 PTY and 1666.8 events /100 PTY, respectively. All (71, 100.0%) patients experienced at 
least one AE and majority of them (97.2%) had at least one grade ≥3 event. Anaemia, platelet count 
decreased, neutrophil count decreased were the most frequently reported haematological AEs, and 
hypokalaemia and peripheral oedema were the most frequent non-haematological AEs.

Adverse events up to Day 28 visit, regardless of study treatment relationship in at least 
10% patients in either treatment arm (all grades column), by preferred term (Safety set) 
cGvHD: In REACH-3, the difference in incidence of all AEs (all grades and grade ≥3) between the two 
treatment arms (RUX arm vs. BAT arm) was ≤10% with the exception of blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (41.8% vs. 22.2%, all grades) and investigations (50.3% vs. 32.3%, all grades). 
In the RUX overall treatment group, the most frequent AEs by SOCs, were infections and infestations 
(68.6% of patients), blood and lymphatic system disorders (42.5% of patients). 
Other frequent AEs by SOCs ≥30% of patients) were investigations (49.1%), metabolic and nutrition 
disorders (39.8%), general disorders and administration site conditions (39.4%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (38.5%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (38.1%), and musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (31.4%)). 
There was a similar cumulative incidence for most in AEs by SOC in the RUX population up to Cycle 7 
Day 1 and in the overall period, in cGvHD patients receiving ruxolitinib, however, an increase of the 
cumulative incidence of AEs by SOC was obvious in infections/infestations, eye disorders, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and neoplasms benign/malignant. 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, the most frequently observed AEs by PT (≥15% in either treatment arm) were 
anemia (29.1% vs. 12.7%), followed by hypertension (15.8% vs. 12.7%), pyrexia (15.8% vs. 9.5%) 
and ALT elevation (15.2% vs. 4.4%). Of note, the exposure to RUX was much longer than to BAT up to 
the data cut-off. 
REACH-3 AEs by PT up to DCO 
The most frequent hematological AEs by PT (≥10% of patients) were anemia (28.8%), neutropenia 
(13.3%), and thrombocytopenia (11.5%). With the exception of pyrexia (18.1%), all other non-
hematological AEs were reported in ≤ 15%. 
The frequencies of AEs were similar between Cycle 7 Day 1 and up to DCO were similar.

With regard to Hematological and non-hematological AEs, up to DCO for the main treatment period, 
the frequently observed AEs by PT (≥15% in either treatment arm) were anemia (32.1% vs. 13.9%), 
pyrexia (20.0% vs. 10.8%), ALT increase (17.6% vs. 4.4%), hypertension (17.6% vs. 13.3%), blood 
creatinine increased (15.8% vs. 4.4%), diarrhea (15.8% vs. 15.8%), and pneumonia (15.8% vs.

CMV infections/reactivations were seen in 5.5% (Gr≥3: 1.2%) vs. 8.2% (Gr≥3: 0%) in the RUX and 
the BAT arm respectively.

Adverse events suspected to be related to the study drug 
In REACH-2 aGvHD, the most frequent AEs by PT (all grades) suspected to be related to study 
treatment (≥5% patients) in the RUX arm were haematological in nature, cytopenia including 
thrombocytopenia (19.1%), anemia and platelet count decreased (11.2% each), neutropenia (7.2%), 
WBC count decreased (5.9%), neutrophil count decreased (5.3%). All other non-haematological AEs 
were reported in ≤ 5%. Similarly, grade ≥3 AEs suspected to be related to RUX were also 
haematological AEs with the most frequent PTs including thrombocytopenia (14.5%), platelet count 
decreased (10.5%), anaemia (7.9%), neutropenia (5.9%), WBC count decreased (5.3%), and 
neutrophil count decreased (5.3% each). In the BAT arm, with the exception of platelet count 
decrease, white blood cell count decrease, and cytomegalovirus infection (which occurred in 4.7% of 
patients each), all other AEs by PT (all grades) suspected to be related to study treatment occurred in 
< 4%. Grade ≥3 AEs suspected to be related to study treatment were infrequent (<2%) with the 
exception of platelet count decreased (4.7%), decreased white blood cell count and thrombocytopenia 
(4.0% each), and anaemia (2.0%). Up to data cut-off (including cross-over period): AEs (all grades) 
and grade ≥3 AEs suspected to be related to study drug were reported in 66.2% and in 56.2% of 
patients. Similar to the frequencies observed up to Day 28, the most frequent AEs by PT (all grades) 
suspected to be related to study treatment (≥5% patients) in the RUX arm were haematological AEs. 
Exposure adjusted incidence of all grade AEs suspected to be related to study drug were 506.1 
events/100 PTY. The most frequent exposure-adjusted incident rates (per 100 PTY) of AEs (all grades) 
were thrombocytopenia (85.4) and anaemia (58.6). Exposure adjusted incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs 
suspected to be related to study drug were 320.1 events/100 PTY with thrombocytopenia (72.7) and 
anaemia (43.4) being the most frequent AEs.

Study 271: AEs (all grades) and grade ≥3 AEs suspected to be related to study drug were reported in 
76.1% and in 64.8% of patients, respectively. Exposure adjusted incidence of all grade AEs and grade 
≥3 suspected to be related to study drug were 722.5 events/100 PTY and 383.7 events/100 PTY. 
REACH-3 cGvHD: Up to Cycle 7 Day 1: In Study D2301, the most frequent (≥5% patients) AEs by PT 
(all grades) suspected to be related to study treatment in the RUX arm were haematological AEs. Up to 
Cycle 7 Day 1, the most frequent (in ≥ 5% patients) AEs by PT (all grades) reported as related to 
study treatment in the RUX arm were anaemia (21.7%), neutropenia (10.2%) and thrombocytopenia 
(8.4%), ALT (8.0%), and pneumonia (5.8%). The most frequent grade ≥ 3 AEs suspected to be 
related to RUX by PTs were also occurred with anaemia (9.7%), thrombocytopenia (7.1%), and 
neutropenia (6.6%). In Study D2301, RUX treatment up to data cut-off (including cross-over period) 
was similar to the frequencies observed up to Cycle 7 Day 1. During the Crossover treatment period, 
24 (39.3%) patients experienced at least one AE suspected to be related to study treatment, of whom 
12 (19.7%) patients experienced grade ≥ 3 AEs. The frequently reported incidence (≥ 10 %) of AEs by 
SOC suspected to be related to RUX treatment were: blood and lymphatic system disorders (23.0% 
with all grades and 8.2% with grade ≥ 3 in severity), infections and infestations (14.8% with all grades 
and 8.2 % with grade ≥ 3), and gastrointestinal disorders (11.5% with all grades and 1.6% (n=1) with 
grade ≥ 3) (CSR study D2301). 
With adjusted by exposure, the incidence rate of all grade AEs was higher in the RUX arm than in the 
BAT arm (1055.9 events/100 PTY vs. 863.3 events/100 PTY) with anaemia being the most frequent 
(42.9 vs 23.3 events/100 PTY), followed by pyrexia (24.4 vs 17.3) and ALT elevation (21.4 vs 6.9). 
(CSR study D2301). When adjusted for exposure, the incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs was higher in the 
BAT arm (149.0 events/100 PTY) than in the RUX arm (123.7 events/100 PTY) with as most frequent 
in the RUX arm anaemia (16.9 vs. 11.9), pneumonia (14.6 vs. 15.7), neutropenia (13.5 vs. 5.8), 
thrombocytopenia (12.8 vs. 8.9). 
AEs by age 
Differences were observed in the occurrence of AEs within the age subgroups (18 to 65 years old 
group and >65 years old group) in the RUX treatment arm of REACH 2. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were similar 
across the subgroups but patients with SAEs were higher the >65 years old group (82.8%) compared 
to the 18 to 65 years old group (66.9%). The comparison with BAT in the elderly age group shows that 
in Study C2301, patients older than 65 experience more grade 3 or higher AEs in RUX arm (95.2%) 
than in BAT (79.2%) and more were considered treatment related in the RUX arm. This was also 
confirmed with higher percentages SAE, AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs leading to dose 
adjustments and AEs requiring additional therapy (table 2-28), even though the sample size limits 
accurate definition of incidences. In REACH 3, in patients older than 65 experience numerical 
differences were noted but assessment is hampered by the limited number of subjects older than 65 
years of age (18 vs 22).Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths aGvHD 
For aGvHD and cGvHD, on-treatment deaths were defined as deaths from date of first administration 
of randomised treatment to 30 days after the last administration of randomised treatment or end of 
randomised treatment period, whichever is later. 
REACH-2 - Up to Day 28: Up to Day 28, there were a total of 36 on-treatment deaths (RUX 15 (9.9%) 
vs BAT 21 (14.0%)). The primary reason for death was reported as study indication (including 
complications of the disease that were attributed to aGvHD itself or to its treatments) (5.9% RUX vs 
11.3% BAT).  
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 135/177 
 
 
 
Up to data cut-off (including cross-over period), in RUX treated patients 62 on-treatment deaths 
(30.8%) were reported, of which in 29 patients (14.4%), the primary reason for death was reported as 
study indication (including complications of the disease that were attributed to aGvHD itself or to its 
treatments).  
Study 271: Of the 30 deaths, 25 (35.2%) were on-treatment deaths. Seven (9.9%) were due to study 
indication and 18 were due to other reasons. Of note, for this study, no primary reason for death was 
collected. Instead, all AEs with fatal outcome were summarized. Therefore, a patient can have more 
than one reason for death.

Deaths cGvHD 
REACH-3- Up to Cycle 7 Day 1: A total of 13 (7.9%) patients in the RUX arm and 9 (5.7%) patients in 
the BAT arm died during the study. Of the 13 deaths in the RUX arm, 12 were due to study indication 
(including complications of the disease that were attributed to cGvHD itself or to its treatments), and 
one (1.6%) was due to general physical health deterioration (reported more than 30 days after last 
dose of RUX but before end of randomisation period).  
- In Study REACH 3 up to data cut-off (including cross-over period), there were 19 deaths (8.4%) in 
RUX treated patients.  Of these, 16 reported the primary reason for death as study indication (4 
additional patients since cycle 7 day 1) (Table 7). 
A more detailed description of the primary cause of death depicted as “study indication” for cGVHD has 
been provided. An overview of corresponding fatal SAEs according to the primary cause of on-
treatment death reported as study indication up to Cycle 7 Day 1 by treatment arm with suspected 
treatment relationship was presented. Review of the 13 fatal cases in the ruxolitinib arm showed that 
the status of underlying GvHD prior to / at onset of events was either partial response or stable 
disease in all cases. None showed GvHD progression. It is clarified that the fatal cases of pneumonia 
can also be attributed to primary cause of death “study indication”, of which one case was not related 
to study treatment and 7 cases were related to RUX and/or concomitant treatment versus 2 cases of 
pneumonia in the BAT arm. The relation to RUX, in the majority of the cases could not be distinguished 
due to the concomitant administration of prednisolone, tacrolimus, cyclosporin.

SAEs with fatal outcome 
In REACH-2 up to Day 28, SAEs with a fatal outcome was 7.9% in RUX arm and 11.3% in BAT arm. 
The majority of the fatal SAEs up to Day 28 were not suspected to be related to study treatment. Fatal 
SAEs in 3.9% in the RUX arm and 8.7% in the BAT were due to the study indication (including 
complications of the disease that were attributed to aGvHD itself or to its treatments). Up to DCO 
(including cross-over period), a total of 48 (23.9%) ruxolitinib patients had SAEs with fatal outcomes, 
out of which 20 (10.0%) were attributed to study indication and 28 deaths due to other causes. The 
most common SAEs (≥ 1%) by PT with a fatal outcome due to other causes were respiratory failure (4 
patients, 2.0%), sepsis (3 patients, 1.5%), and septic shock (3 patients, 1.5%). Study treatment 
related SAEs with fatal outcome were reported in 14 patients. 
In REACH-1, a total of 28 (39.4%) patients had SAEs with fatal outcomes out of which 9 (12.7%) were 
due to study indication and 19 (26.8%) were due to other causes (most frequently reported were 
infections). 
In REACH-3, SAEs with a fatal outcome were reported in 7.3% in the RUX arm and 5.1% in the BAT 
arm. Also, in REACH-3, study indication was reported to be the primary cause of fatal SAEs in 6.7% 
patients in the RUX arm, and 3.2% patients in the BAT arm. The most common SAE(s) (≥ 1%) by PT 
with a fatal outcome was pneumonia (3.0%) in the RUX arm and pneumonia and septic shock (1.3% 
each) in the BAT arm. Study treatment related SAEs with fatal outcome were reported in 4.2% and 
2.5% patients in ruxolitinib and BAT arms, respectively. 
SAEs 
REACH-2 A similar proportion of patients in the RUX arm (57; 37.5%) and the BAT arm (51; 34.0%) 
experienced an SAE up to day 28, regardless of relationship to study treatment. Grade ≥3 SAEs were 
reported in 36.2% of patients in the RUX arm and 31.3% in the BAT arm (Table 35). The incidence of 
Grade ≥3 SAEs was 36.2% in the RUX arm and 31.3% in the BAT arm. In the RUX arm, sepsis (5.3%) 
was the only Grade ≥3 SAE by PT observed in >5% patients. In the BAT arm, cytomegalovirus infection 
(3.3%) and septic shock and respiratory failure (2.7% each), were the most frequent Grade ≥3 SAE by 
PT. Up to the data cut-off date, SAEs were observed in 65.1% patients in the RUX group and 52.7% 
patients in the BAT group. The difference was driven to some extent by the SOC of infections and 
infestations (38.2% in the RUX arm and 30.0% in the BAT arm). 
Overall, when adjusted for exposure, the incidence of SAEs (all grades) was higher in the BAT arm 
(427.4 per 100 PTY) than in the RUX arm (330.8 per 100 PTY). The exposure-adjusted incidence rate 
(per 100 PTY) of SAEs by PT higher (≥10 events difference) in the BAT arm relative to the RUX arm 
were (BAT vs RUX): Sepsis (38.4 vs 26.7), Cytomegalovirus infection (28.8 vs. 13.5, and Pneumonia 
(27.6 vs. 13.4). The exposure-adjusted incidence rate (per 100 PTY) of Grade ≥3 SAEs by PT observed

at a higher rate (≥10 events difference) in the BAT arm relative to the RUX arm (BAT vs RUX) were: 
Sepsis (38.4 vs 26.7), Cytomegalovirus infection (28.8 vs 13.5), Pneumonia (27.6 vs 13.4). 
Serious adverse events in REACH-2, regardless of relationship to study treatment, in at least

SAE related to study treatment:  
REACH-2: Up to Day 28, the incidence of SAEs suspected to be related to study treatment was similar 
between the RUX arm and BAT arm (10.5% vs. 7.3%), with as most common SOC in either treatment 
arm: infections and infestations (5.9% RUX vs 4.0% BAT). All other SOCs were observed in <2% 
patients in either treatment arm. The treatment related SOCs of cardiac disorders, general disorders 
and administrative site conditions, immune system disorders, hepatobiliary disorders and renal and 
urinary disorders were observed only in the BAT arm. Except for PT sepsis observed in 3 patients 
randomized to RUX arm, no other SAE by PT occurred in more than 1 or 2 patients each. 
Up to the data cut-off date, the incidence of SAEs suspected to be related to study treatment was 
higher in the RUX arm compared to BAT arm (25.7% vs. 11.3%). Except for PT sepsis, observed in 5 
patients randomized to RUX arm, no other SAE by PT occurred in more than 1 or 2 patients each. In all 
these 5 patients reported with sepsis, the events were attributed to both RUX and other study 
treatments (CNIs and/or steroids). The single SAE of graft loss in the RUX arm was observed at data 
cut-off. After crossover, the incidence (24.5%) and overall profile of SAEs suspected to be related to 
study treatment was consistent with that observed in patients randomized to RUX.  
In the crossover period, 77.6% patients had SAEs and Grade ≥3 SAEs were reported in (75.5%) 
patients and the most common Grade ≥3 SAEs by PT were: sepsis (14.3%) and respiratory failure

(12.2%). Up to the second analysis DCO, the incidence of SAEs suspected to be related to study 
treatment was higher in the RUX arm compared to BAT arm (27.0% vs. 12.0%), driven by higher 
incidence (≥5% difference) of the SOCs in the blood and lymphatic system disorders (5.3% vs 0.7%) 
and infections and infestations (14.5% vs. 6.7%) in the RUX arm relative to the BAT arm. After 
crossover, the incidence and overall profile of SAEs suspected to be related to study treatment was 
consistent with that observed in ruxolitinib arm at second analysis cutoff.  
Study 271: SAEs were reported in 83.1% of patients. Exposure adjusted incidence of SAEs was 487.2 
events/100 PTY. The most frequent SAEs by exposure adjusted incidence were pneumonia (33.9%), 
sepsis (33.5%), and pyrexia (31.8%). 
REACH-3 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, a similar proportion of patients in the RUX arm (33.3%) and the BAT arm 
(36.7%) experienced an SAE. By PT, the frequent (≥ 2% patients in either treatment arm) SAEs (RUX 
vs. BAT) were: pneumonia (7.9% vs. 8.2%), pyrexia (4.8% vs. 1.9%), lower respiratory tract infection 
(2.4% vs. 0), and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (1.2% vs. 2.5%). The incidence of grade ≥ 3 SAEs 
was 29.7% in the RUX arm and 33.5% in the BAT arm. Up to the data cut-off date for the Main 
treatment period, the overall SAE profile was similar to those up to Cycle 7 Day 1 with a slight increase 
in the incidence as expected due to longer exposure. SAEs were observed in 43.6% of patients in the 
RUX arm and 39.9% of patients in the BAT arm.  
Overall, when adjusted for exposure, the incidence of SAEs (all grades) was higher in the BAT arm 
(76.6 per 100 PTY) than in the RUX arm (60.3 per 100 PTY). Similarly, the incidence of grade ≥ 3 SAEs 
was higher in the BAT arm (65.4 events/100 PTY) than in the RUX arm (51.6 events/100 PTY). The 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rate of most commonly observed (with >5 per 100 PTY) all grades SAEs 
(by PT) in the RUX arm and the BAT arm (RUX and BAT, respectively) were: pneumonia (13.8 and 
13.7 per 100 PTY) and pyrexia (7.3 and 3.9 per 100 PTY). 
SAE related to study treatment:  
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, the incidence of SAEs reported as related to study treatment was 16.4% in the 
RUX arm and 10.1% in the BAT arm. The most common SAE (by PT) reported as related to study 
treatment was pneumonia in 6.1% of patients in RUX arm and 2.5% of patients in the BAT arm, 
followed by pyrexia 2.4% (4 patients) in RUX arm vs. 0.6% (1 patient) in the BAT arm. Other SAEs by 
PT occurred in < 2 patients in each arm. Up to the data cut-off date for the Main treatment period, the 
incidence of SAEs reported as related to study treatment was higher in the RUX arm compared to the 
BAT arm (21.2% vs. 10.1%). The incidence of SAEs (by PT) with pneumonia was higher in the RUX 
arm (n=12, 7.3%) compared to that in the BAT arm (n=4, 2.5%). Pyrexia was observed in 5 patients 
(3.0%) in the RUX arm vs. 1 patient (0.6%) in the BAT arm and lower respiratory tract infection was 
observed in 4 patients (2.4%). Other SAE by PT occurred in no more than 2 patients in each arm.  
After cross over to RUX treatment, SAEs related to study treatment were reported in 8 (13.1%) 
patients with all grades and in 8 (13.1%) patients with grade ≥ 3. The most common (≥ 5%) SAEs 
suspected to be related to study treatment by SOC (all grade, grade ≥ 3) were: infections and 
infestations (8.2%, 8.2%) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (6.6%, 4.9%). 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuations 
REACH-2 aGvHD 
Up to Day 28, AE(s) leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment were reported in 11.2% 
and 4.0% patients in the RUX arm and BAT arm, respectively, of whom most were of Grade ≥3 in

severity. The most common AEs (≥ 2%) by PT leading to discontinuation in RUX arm were anemia and 
thrombocytopenia. In the BAT arm, no single AE (by PT) occurred in more than one patient leading to 
discontinuation. 
Up to the second DCO, AEs leading to discontinuation were observed in 27% in the RUX arm and 9.3% 
in the BAT arm. The majority of AEs leading to discontinuation in both arms were Grade≥3 in severity 
(23.0% and 8.7%). The most common (≥2%) AEs leading to discontinuation in the ruxolitinib arm 
were neutropenia, sepsis (2.6% each) and anemia and thrombocytopenia (2.0% each). 
Study 271 AEs (all grades) leading to discontinuation were reported in 32.4% of patients and grade ≥3 
AEs in 28.2% matching the frequencies in REACH-2. 
REACH-3 cGvHD 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, AEs leading to discontinuation were observed in 16.4% in the RUX arm and 7.0% 
in the BAT arm. The majority of the AEs were grade ≥ 3 and pneumonia was the only AE (all grades) 
leading to discontinuation in at least 2% patients in ruxolitinib arm (4.8%, grade ≥ 3: 3,6%). 
Discontinuations due to pneumonia were 1.3% in BAT arm.  
Adverse events, leading to study drug discontinuation, by PT (Safety Set) (≥ 2 patients) 
Up to DCO, AEs (all grades) leading to discontinuation were reported in 18.1% and grade ≥3 AEs in 
13.3% of ruxolitinib treated patients. 
In aGvHD most treatment discontinuations were due to hematological AEs while most treatment 
discontinuations in cGvHD were due to infections.  
It should be noted that discontinuation criteria were outlined in protocol only for ruxolitinib treatment 
while discontinuation criteria of BAT treatments were left at INV’s judgement per standard of care. 
AEs leading to dose adjustment and/or interruption 
REACH-2 aGvHD 
Up to Day 28, 36.8% and 9.3% the RUX arm and BAT arm, respectively, experienced an AE leading to 
dose adjustment or interruption. Majority of the AEs leading to dose adjustment or interruption in both 
treatment arms were Grade ≥3 in severity (33.6% and 5.3%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 141/177 
 
 
 
 
The higher incidence of AEs leading to dose adjustment or interruption in the RUX arm compared to 
the BAT arm was driven by cytopenias (Thrombocytopenia: 14.5% vs. 1.3%, Neutropenia 11.8% vs. 
0.7%, Platelet count decreased 11.2% vs. 2.7%, Leukopenia (5.3% vs. 0.7%). 
Up to DCO, 54.6% of patients on ruxolitinib treatment experienced AEs (all grades) leading to dose 
adjustment or interruption, driven by cytopenias. In BAT arm 13.3% were dose adjusted or interrupted 
Most of the AEs were Grade≥3 in severity in both treatment arms (50.0% and 9.3%).  
In REACH-1, AEs (all grades) leading to dose adjustment or interruption were seen in 64.8% patients 
(grade≥3: 59.2%) and cytopenias were the most common reason. 
REACH-3 cGvHD  
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, 37.6% (grade ≥3. 23.0%) in the RUX arm and 16.5% (grade ≥3: 7.6%) in the 
BAT arm experienced an AE leading to dose adjustment or interruption. In the RUX arm, anemia 
(7.9%) and blood creatinine increased (6.1%) were the most frequent AEs leading to dose adjustment 
or interruption (≥5%). In the BAT arm, except for pyrexia observed in 3 patients, no other PTs were 
observed in more than two patients. 
Up to DCO for the main treatment period (including cross-over period) ruxolitinib treatment AEs lead 
to a dose adjustment or interruption in 43.0% (grade ≥3: 28.5%). In the BAT arm these events 
occurred in 18.4% (grade ≥3: 8.2%). In the RUX arm, AEs occurring ≥5% (all grades) and leading to 
dose adjustment or interruption were anemia (8.8%, grade≥ 3: 4.0%), and neutropenia (6.6%). Most 
frequent (≥2%) grade≥ 3 AEs were neutropenia (5.3%), anemia (4.0%), pneumonia (3.5%), 
thrombocytopenia (2.7%), and ALT increased (2.7%).  
Criteria for dose adjustment/ interruption for ruxolitinib were outlined in the protocol, however with 
respect to BAT this was left at the Investigator’s judgement. 
Adverse events of special interest 
AESIs are defined based on known safety data. 
The aggregated PTs used to identify the AESI were based on the standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) 
/or group of PTs using MedDRA version 22.1 for REACH-2 and version 23.0 for REACH-3. 
Note that the AESIs, in the RUX arm and in the BAT arm, are presented up to Day 28 in REACH-2, 
aGvHD and up to Cycle 7 Day 1 in REACH-3, cGvHD. 
Further, the safety data (AESI) for the entire treatment period up to cut-off date for ruxolitinib treated 
patients (including patients originally randomized to BAT and who crossed over to ruxolitinib) is 
presented (for aGvHD and cGvHD) followed by exposure adjusted analysis.

Overview of adverse events of special interest in acute and chronic GvHD 
It is noted that out of the selected AESIs, growth retardation, PML and tuberculosis, there were no 
patients under these safety topics in any of the three studies. 
In addition, there were only four patients in each pivotal study developing herpes zoster and one 
patient in each study with a hepatitis B reactivation. 
Infections 
Infection is major complication following an allo-transplant procedure. Furthermore, 
immunosuppressive agents given prophylactic for GvHD increase the risk of opportunistic viral and 
fungal pathogens as well as either a risk of reactivation of CMV or a de novo CMV infection (due to 
mis-match donor with respect to CMV status). Due to the transplant procedure all patients are also 
heavily myelosuppressed.  
REACH-2 aGvHD 
Up to Day 28, the proportion of patients with infections were comparable in the RUX arm (61.2%) vs. 
the BAT arm (58.7%). 
Up to data cut-off, the exposure adjusted overall incidence of infections in the RUX arm was 681.9/100 
PTY and 787.0/100 PTY in the BAT arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 143/177 
 
 
 
 
Up to DCO, ruxolitinib exposure adjusted overall incidence rate was 652.2/100 PTY. Treatment-related 
AEs and SAEs were noted in 24.9% and 39.8% respectively. At the time of data cut-off, in 57.7% AEs 
were recovered/resolved and in 34.3% not recovered/not resolved. The most frequent PTs (≥ 5%) 
were CMV infection reactivation (22.4%), sepsis (12.4%), pneumonia (10.4%), urinary tract infection 
(8.5%), CMV infection (7.5%), device related infection (7.0%), and septic shock (6.5%). The most 
common fatal AEs were sepsis (10 deaths), septic shock (7 deaths), pneumonia (2 deaths), and 
pseudomonal sepsis (2 deaths). The majority of infections occurred within the first 2 months of 
treatment. 
Until the DCO, sepsis and septic shock was 24.3% in the RUX arm and 20.7% in the BAT arm (of which 
most were of Grade ≥3 in severity. Study treatment discontinuations and dose interruptions were 
recorded in 4.6% vs 2.0% and dose interruptions was 4.6% in the RUX arm. However, up to the 
Secondary analysis data cut off, the exposure-adjusted IR of PT sepsis (all grades) was lower in 
ruxolitinib arm (33.2 events/100 PTY) compared to BAT arm (66.1 events/100 PTY). 
REACH-3 cGvHD 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1: Proportion of patients with infections were comparable in the ruxolitinib arm 
(62.4%) vs. the BAT arm (58.2%). 
Up to data cut-off (excluding cross-over), the exposure adjusted overall incidence rates was 169.0/ 
100 PTY in the ruxolitinib arm and 185.0 /100 PTY in the BAT arm. 
Up to DCO, ruxolitinib exposure adjusted overall incidence rate was 161.2/100 PTY. Treatment-related 
AEs and SAEs were noted in 26.5% and 27.0% respectively. At the time of data cut-off, 58.0% AEs 
were recovered/resolved (Table 2-15). The most frequent PTs (≥5%) were pneumonia (14.6%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (13.3%), influenza (8%), nasopharyngitis (7.1%), bronchitis, urinary tract 
infection (6.6% each), conjunctivitis and CMV reactivation (5.3%). 
Majority of the infections occurred within the first 4 months of treatment.

Pneumonia/opportunistic infections 
The proportion of patients with pneumonia during period up to Day 28 (aGvHD) or up to Cycle 7, Day 1 
(cGvHD), were comparable between the treatment arms. The exposure-adjusted overall incidence 
(EAIR per 100 STY), was considerably higher in aGvHD compared to cGvHD. 
The proportion of opportunistic infections during period up to Day 28 (aGvHD) was 27% vs 22% in the 
RUX vs BAT arm and for cGvHD, up to Cycle 7 Day 1, 11% vs 12% in the respective treatment arm. 
The exposure-adjusted overall incidence (EAIR per 100 STY), was considerably higher in aGvHD

CMV infection/disease and viral other infections 
REACH-2 aGvHD 
Up to Day 28, CMV infections were reported in 28.3% in the RUX arm vs. 24.0% in the BAT arm and 
during the period up to data cut-off, in 35.5% (Grade≥3: 12.5%) in the RUX arm and 32.0% (Grade 
≥3: 14.0%) in the BAT arm. 
The exposure adjusted overall incidence rate (excluding the crossover period), 154.0/100 PTY in the 
RUX arm and 214.5 /100 PTY in the BAT arm. At the time of data cut-off, in 21.4% AEs were 
recovered or resolved. 
REACH-3 cGvHD 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1: The proportions of patients with CMV infections were similar in the RUX arm 
(9.1%) vs. the BAT arm (10.8%). CMV disease (enteritis, pneumonia) was reported in 1.2% and 1.3% 
in the ruxolitinib arm and in the BAT arm, respectively.  
Up to data cut-off (excluding cross-over), the exposure adjusted overall incidence rates was 10.7/100 
PTY in the ruxolitinib arm and 18.4 /100 PTY in the BAT arm.

AESI CMV infections were reported for REACH-3 in 9.1% (Grade≥3: 1.8%) up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (Safety 
set) and approximately the same rate for the main treatment period. Furthermore, CMV infection using 
other PTs were also reported, in a lower frequency.

Adenovirus infections 
A review of the available cases of Adenovirus infection (n=26) in patients treated with ruxolitinib for 
GvHD, has been provided, including cases from clinical studies REACH-2 and REACH-3, spontaneous 
reports and literature.  
There were 11 paediatric cases and 15 cases reported in adults. All cases were either confounded with 
multiple immunosuppressant therapy or were poorly documented which precluded evaluation of cases. 
There was none case with ruxolitinib monotherapy or a case where causal association only with 
ruxolitinib was established or suspected. However, having considered multiple immunosuppressive 
treatment, occurrence or reactivation of infections, including viral, could be expected.  
The available data does not allow to assess the role of ruxolitinib on the incidence of adenoviral 
infection in patients with SR GvHD. 
Other Viral infections 
Proportion of aGvHD patients with viral infections, during the period up to Day 28, were higher in the 
RUX arm (39.5%, Grade≥3 14.5%) compared to the BAT arm (32.0%, Grade≥3 14.0%). The 
imbalance was mainly due to the differences among CMV infections. 
However, in cGvHD, the higher proportion of patients with viral infections in the RUX arm (28.5%) vs 
the BAT arm (23.4%) up to Cycle 7 Day 1, was mainly due to the differences among BK virus 
infections.  
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) 
REACH-2 aGvHD Up to Day 28: were reported in 9.9% in the RUX arm and 10.7% in the BAT arm, and 
up to DCO in 19.1% vs 14.0%. 
REACH-3 cGvHD Up to Cycle 7 Day 1: were reported in 8.5% in the RUX arm and 6.3 in the BAT arm, 
and up to DCO in 19.9 vs 9.5%.  
Haematology/Cytopenias 
aGvHD 
REACH-2 population: At baseline, consistent with the study population disease characteristics, majority 
of patients with aGvHD had low haemoglobin level (90.8% vs. 90.6%), and low platelet counts (79.6% 
vs. 82.0%) in the RUX arm and the BAT arm; majority of these laboratory abnormalities were CTC 
grade 1 or 2. The worst post-baseline of grade 3 haemoglobin was reported in similar proportion of 
patients (47.4% vs. 46.0%). The proportion of patients with worst post-baseline value of grade 3 
decreased platelets was lower in the RUX arm (25.7% vs. 32.7%) while higher for grade 4 decreased 
platelets (53.9% vs. 46.0%). Worst post-baseline of grade 3 (16.4% vs. 19.3%) and grade 4 (21.7% 
vs. 16.7%) neutrophil count was similar between the two arms. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Up to Day 28, 50.0% of the patients in the RUX arm and 32.7% of the patients in the BAT arm 
experienced at least one thrombocytopenia event. The incidence of Grade≥3 thrombocytopenia was 
41.4% in the RUX arm and 29.3% in BAT arm, no fatal events were reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022

Up to the Secondary analysis data cut-off, the overall incidence of thrombocytopenia events increased 
to 56.6% (Grade≥3: 50.7%) in RUX arm and 36.7% (Grade≥3: 32.0%) in BAT arm. In 36.8% and 
9.3%, in the RUX arm and the BAT arm, respectively the events were regarded as treatment related.  
Anemia 
Up to Day 28, the overall incidence of anemia events was 30.3% (Grade≥3: 22.4%) in the RUX arm 
and 28.0% (Grade≥3: 20.0%) in BAT arm. 
Up to the Secondary analysis data cut-off, the incidence of anemia events had increased to 40.8% 
(Grade≥3: 36.2%) and 34.0% (Grade≥3: 25.3%). In 16.4% and 5.3%, in the RUX arm and the BAT 
arm, respectively, the events were regarded as treatment related. 
Leukopenia 
Up to Day 28, the overall incidence of leukopenia events was 32.9% (Grade≥3: 28.9%) in the RUX 
arm and 26.7% (Grade ≥3: 22.0%) in BAT arm. 
Up to the Secondary analysis data cut-off, the incidence of leukopenia events had increased to 46.7% 
(Grade≥3: 42.2%) and 32.0% (Grade≥3: 27.3%). 
cGvHD 
REACH-3 population: At baseline, patients with cGvHD had low haemoglobin level (40.0% vs. 48.1%), 
and low platelet counts (39.4% vs. 34.9%) in the RUX arm and the BAT arm; majority of these 
laboratory abnormalities were CTC grade 1 or 2. Post-baseline values of CTC grade 3 haemoglobin 
decrease (17.6 vs. 9.5%) occurred more in the RUX arm than in the BAT arm. While post-baseline 
grade 3 neutrophil decrease (10.3% vs. 3.8%) was more frequent in RUX arm, grade 4 values were 
similar between the two arms (7.3% vs. 7.6%). Worst post-baseline platelet counts of grade 3 and 
grade 4was similar between the two arms [Study D2301 PA-Table 14.3-3.4]. More patients in the RUX 
arm had worst post-baseline grade 3 for haemoglobin decrease and neutrophil decrease. 
Anemia 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, the overall incidence of anemia events was 29.7% (Grade ≥3: 12.7%) in the RUX 
arm and 12.7% (Grade ≥3: 7.6%) in BAT arm. 
Up to DCO, the incidence of anemia events was 32.1% (Grade ≥3: 15.2%) in the RUX arm and 13.9% 
(Grade ≥3: 7.6%) in the BAT arm. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, 21.2% of the patients in the RUX arm and 14.6% of the patients in the BAT arm 
experienced at least one thrombocytopenia event. The incidence of Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia was 
15.2% in the RUX arm and 10.1% in BAT arm. 
Up to DCO, the overall incidence of thrombocytopenia was 23.0% (Grade ≥3: 17.6%) in RUX arm and

Bleeding 
aGvHD REACH-2 
Up to Day 28, bleeding events were seen in 25.0% (Grade ≥3: 4.6%) and 22.0% (Grade ≥3: 2.6%) 
patients in the RUX arm and the BAT arm, respectively. There were no fatal events.  
Up to the Secondary analysis data cut-off, the incidence of bleeding events was 40.1% (Grade ≥3: 
12.5%) in the RUX arm and 28.0% (Grade ≥3: 7.3%) in BAT arm.  
Corresponding exposure-adjusted IR of bleeding events were 158.2 and 174.3 per 100 PTYs in the RUX 
and the BAT arms respectively. One patient in ruxolitinib arm died due to lower GI hemorrhage in 
setting of aGvHD involving lower GI (stage 3). Events in 11.8% patients in ruxolitinib arm and 2.0% 
patients in BAT arm were regarded as treatment related. SAEs were observed in 6.6% patients in 
ruxolitinib and 5.3% patients in BAT arms. GI bleeding events occurred in 9.2% patients in the RUX 
arm and 6.7% patients in the BAT arm up. There were no fatal GI bleeding events. There was one 
intracranial haemorrhage reported, in each arm. 
cGvHD REACH-3 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, haemorrhages were seen in 11.5% (Grade ≥3: 2.4%) vs 14.6% (Grade ≥3: 1.9%) 
in the RUX arm and the BAT arm, respectively.

the RUX arm and the BAT arm, respectively. There was one intracranial hemorrhage reported, in the RUX 
arm.  
More bleeding events occurred in both treatment arms in REACH-2 than reported for REACH-3, 
concurrent with time elapsed since allo-tx and the higher frequency of thrombocytopenia.  
Hypertension 
REACH-2  
Up to Day 28, hypertension occurred in 10.5% patients in the RUX arm and 9.3% patients in the BAT 
arm. Grade 3 events were observed in 5.9% patients in the RUX arm and 4.0% patients in the BAT

Up to the Secondary analysis data cut-off, the proportion of patients with hypertension increased to 
13.8% in the RUX arm, and 12.7% in BAT arm. 
REACH-3 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, hypertension occurred in 16.4% (Grade ≥3: 6.1%) and in 12.7% (Grade ≥3: 
7.0%) RUX and BAT arms respectively. 
Up to DCO, hypertension occurred in 18.2% (Grade ≥3: 6.7%) and in 13.3% (Grade ≥3: 6.7%) RUX 
and BAT arms respectively.

Hypertension rate increased by time on ruxolitinib and is an identified ADR for ruxolitinib.  
Malignancies, including non-melanoma skin cancer 
REACH-2: Up to the Secondary analysis data cut-off, malignancy events occurred in 3 (2.0%) patients 
each in two treatment arms. Corresponding exposure-adjusted IR of malignancy events were 6.1 and 
9.9 per 100 PTYs in RUX and BAT arms respectively. 
The event in RUX arm was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (grade 3). On review of this case, the patient 
had relapse of underlying diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In the BAT arm, one patient each had 
recurrent AML (fatal), erythroleukaemia (grade 1), and recurrent leukaemia (grade 4), none of which 
were suspected to be related to study treatment. After crossover, one patient had grade SAE of central 
nervous system lymphoma which led to discontinuation of study treatment. 
REACH-3: Malignancy events were reported in 2 patients in the RUX arm and was not considered 
related to study treatment. These malignancy events were non melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) events. 
The event of grade 2 squamous cell carcinoma of skin was still ongoing by data cut-off in the Main 
treatment period. The events were reported as not related. No dose change, interruption or 
discontinuation occurred. The event of grade 3 basal cell carcinoma was resolved by Cycle 7 Day 1. No 
events were reported in the BAT arm. 
Thromboembolic events 
REACH-2: Up to Day 28, thromboembolic events occurred in 8.6% (Grade ≥3: 4.6%) and 6.7% (Grade 
≥3: 4.7%) in RUX and BAT arms respectively.  
Up to the Secondary analysis data cut-off thromboembolic events occurred in 12.5% (Grade ≥3: 7.2%) 
and 11.3% (Grade ≥3: 6.0%) in RUX and BAT arms respectively. 
REACH-3: Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, thromboembolic events occurred in 4.8% (Grade ≥3: 2.4%) and 7.6% 
(Grade ≥3: 6.3%) in RUX and BAT arms respectively.  
Up to DCO, thromboembolic events occurred in 6.1 (Grade ≥3: 3.0%) and 7.6% (Grade ≥3: 6.3%) in 
RUX and BAT arms respectively. 
Clinical chemistry 
Liver chemistry/Elevated Transaminases 
REACH-2  
Elevation of ALT, AST, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase was noted in many patients. Of note, the 
liver is one of the target organs of underlying aGvHD indication. In majority of patients, the worsening 
post-baseline was to grade 1 or 2. a total of 8 (5.3%) in ruxolitinib arm and 18 (12.0%) patients in 
BAT arm met the criteria for Hy’s law (concurrent ALT or AST >3x ULN and BILI >2x ULN and ALP <2x 
ULN). Confounders, like concomitant potentially hepatotoxic antibiotics or progressive liver GvHD, were 
found. 
The following incidence data were reported for AEs by SOC in REACH-2 CSR: 
Up to the DCO, 17.8% (Grade≥3: 6.6%) patients in the RUX arm and 10.0% (Grade≥3: 4.7%) 
patients in BAT arm had elevated transaminases. Events in 4.6% patients in ruxolitinib arm and 0.7% 
patients in BAT arm were suspected to be related to study treatment. There were dose reductions in 
Assessment report

3.3% and dose interruption in 0.7% of the patients in the RUX arm. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 
was reported as AE in 2 patients in ruxolitinib arm and 1 patient in BAT arm and all were assessed as 
non-serious events with Grade 2 severity. 
REACH-3 
No liver enzyme abnormalities that met Hy’s law were observed in the RUX arm. 4 patients in the 
BAT arm met the criteria for Hy’s law. Out of these 4 patients, 3 of whom had baseline GvHD liver 
involvement and had significant elevation of liver tests indicating the elevation was pre-existing.  
The following incidence data were reported for AEs by SOC in REACH-3 CSR: 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1 elevated transaminases were seen in 18.2% (Grade ≥3: 6.7%) of the patients in 
the RUX arm and 7.6% (Grade ≥3: 0.6%) in the BAT arm.  
Up to DCO, elevated transaminases were seen in 20.6% (Grade ≥3: 8.5%) of the patients in the RUX 
arm and 7.6% (Grade ≥3: 0.6%) in the BAT arm.  
Lipid abnormalities 
REACH-2 
Up to Day 28, lipid abnormalities were observed in 3.9% patients in ruxolitinib arm and 4.0% patients 
in BAT arm. Grade 3 abnormalities were observed in 1.3% patients each in both treatment arms. 
Treatment-related events occurred in 1.3% patients in the RUX arm only. One patient in BAT arm had 
a dose reduction. A total of 2.0% patients in each arm required medication in ruxolitinib arm and BAT 
arm. 
Up to the Secondary analysis data cut-off, lipid abnormalities were observed in 9.9% patients in 
ruxolitinib arm and 7.3% patients in BAT arm. 
REACH-3 
Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, lipid abnormalities were observed in 18.8% (Grade ≥3: 7.3%) of the patients in 
the RUX arm and 14.6% (Grade ≥3: 7.0%) in the BAT arm. 
Up to DCO, lipid abnormalities were observed in 20.6 (Grade ≥3: 7.3%) of the patients in the RUX arm 
and 14.6% (Grade ≥3: 7.0%) in the BAT arm. 
Lipid abnormalities were overall higher in the RUX arm compared to the BAT arm. Increased total 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are known 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with ruxolitinib therapy. 
Additional safety topics 
Subgroup analyses for safety were conducted for aGvHD and cGvHD. The subgroups were by age, by 
gender, by race, by region, by baseline hepatic impairment status, by baseline renal impairment 
status, by concomitant cyclosporine treatment.  
Safety assessment by age  
REACH-2 
Adolescents: There were 9 patients between 12 to <18 years (5 in the RUX arm and 4 in BAT arm). 
The median duration of exposure to RUX remained longer (163 days; range: 11.0 to 242.0) than to 
BAT (58.0 days; range: 2.0 to 162.0) and in line with overall population. The AE profile of adolescent 
Assessment report

Page 152/177 
 
 
 
patients were similar to other age groups with minor differences. Cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, 
and immune system disorders were not observed in patients between 12 to 18 years treated with RUX. 
The profile of suspected AEs and SAEs were similar to other age groups. Among patients of 12 to <18 
years, one patient died due to progression of underlying hematological disease. No fractures were 
reported in the RUX arm. Three patients reported events of bone pain, musculoskeletal pain (grade 1 
events) and osteoporosis (n=1 each) (grade 2). Osteoporosis reported on study day 106 was resolving 
after treatment and did not result in a change in RUX therapy due to the event. All these events were 
assessed as not related to RUX therapy. 
All ages: Due to the difference in the number of patients across age groups, 9 patients of 12 to <18 
years (5 in the RUX arm and 4 in BAT arm), 248 patients of 18 to 65 years (126 in the RUX arm and 
122 in BAT arm), and 45 patients of >65 years (21 in in the RUX arm and 24 in BAT arm) direct 
comparisons cannot be done.  
In the 18 to 65 years old, there were 47 deaths (28.3%) and in the >65 years old group there were 14 
deaths (48.3%).  
REACH-3  
Adolescents: There were only 11 patients in the age group 12-18 evaluable for safety, 4 received RUX 
and 7 BAT arm, 1 patient randomised to the BAT arm never received BAT dosing. Up to Cycle 7, Day 1, 
the median duration of exposure to RUX (25.6 weeks, range: 25.6 to 25.6) and to BAT (24.0 weeks, 
range: 8.9 to 25.6) was balanced. AEs profiles by SOC and PT were similar as observed in all-age 
group. No treatment-related AEs, and deaths and no fractures or bone abnormalities were reported. Up 
to Cycle 7 Day 1, 3 (75%) patients in the RUX arm and 7 (100%) patients in the BAT arm experienced 
at least one AE, of which, 1 patient in RUX arm and 2 patients in BAT arm experienced grade ≥3 AEs. 
AEs profiles by SOC and PT were similar as observed in all age group. Nervous system disorders (in 3 
patients) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (2 patients) only occurred in the BAT arm. 
Immune disorders were not observed in patients between 12 to <18 years of age treated with RUX. 
SAE was reported in only one patient in the BAT arm with a nervous system disorders of grade 3 
neuralgia and grade 2 transient ischemic attack. No death was reported for adolescent patients. No 
notable findings were observed in Tanner staging assessment for adolescent patients. Bone density 
measurement by DEXA scan were collected from adolescent patients. Results were not reported in this 
CSR. SAE was reported in only one patient No death was reported for adolescent patients.  
All ages: Subgroup by age 18 to 65 years included 277 patients and subgroup by age ≥65 years 
included 40 patients. The AE profiles were similar between age groups with a few exceptions. A higher 
proportion of deaths were reported in the subgroup >65 year of age and mostly due to study indication 
(cGvHD and complications attributed to the treatment of cGvHD). 
Safety analysis by organ involvement at randomization 
The CSR for aGvHD summarizes that overall the profile of AEs was similar between the aGvHD organ 
involvements, except for the following differences: AEs by gastrointestinal disorders were more 
frequent in aGvHD patients with upper GI involvement and AEs by general disorders and 
administration site conditions were less frequent in aGvHD patients with liver involvement. 
With respect to organ involvement at randomization in cGvHD, the overall population regardless of 
organs involved, the incidence of treatment-related AEs (any grade and grade ≥ 3), treatment related 
SAEs, AEs requiring dose adjustment/interruption, and AEs leading to discontinuation was higher in the 
ruxolitinib arm than in the BAT arm among patients with specific cGvHD organ involvement. However, 
this can be explained by the almost twice as high median total treatment exposure for the RUX arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 153/177 
 
 
 
Overall, when adjusted for exposure, the incidence of SAEs (all grades) was higher in the BAT arm 
(76.6 per 100 PTY) than in the RUX arm (60.3 per 100 PTY). 
With respect to organ involvement at randomization, the profile of AEs was in general consistent with 
that of the overall population regardless of organs involved.  
Vital signs 
aGvHD: There were few notable changes in blood pressure or occurrence of increased pulse rate 
values are infrequent and comparable between treatment arms. Also changes in the weight were 
comparable between treatment arms. Decrease in weight was more frequent than weight gain in both 
treatment arms in aGvHD. 
cGvHD: Changes in systolic blood pressure values was rare and comparable between treatment arms. 
However, the diastolic blood pressure changes were slightly different between 2 treatment arms: ≥105 
mmHg and increase ≥15 mmHg occurred more frequently in ruxolitinib arm (4.8%, n=8) than in BAT 
arm (3.2%, n=5); ≤50 mmHg and decrease ≥15 mmHg occurred less frequently in ruxolitinib arm 
(3.0%, n=5) than in BAT arm (5.7%, n=9). This difference was enhanced in the Main treatment period 
up to the data cut-off. 
The occurrence of increased pulse rate and corresponding AEs was comparable between two treatment 
arms and occurred in a low rate. Weight increase >10% was more common in the RUX arm (22.4%) 
compared to the in the BAT arm up to Cycle 7 Day 1 and even more pronounced up to DCO in the Main 
treatment period, 30.3% in the RUX arm and 16.5% in BAT arm.  
Increase in weight was more frequent than weight loss in both treatment arms in contrast to the 
aGvHD population.  
Exposure and AEs by age 
REACH-2: There were 166 patients 18-65-year-old vs N=29 patients >65 years old. The median 
duration of exposure of RUX was lower in >65-year-old patients (4.3 weeks; range: 0.3-25.1) than in 
the 18 to 65 year-old group (9.9 weeks; range: 0.9 to 66.1). The corresponding exposure in PTY was 
4.0 and 46.0 PTY. AEs by PT in all the subgroups were similar (18 to 65 years old group and >65 years 
old group) with a few exceptions. In the 18 to 65 years old group, cardiac failure and tachycardia were 
reported in 4 patients, and sinus tachycardia was reported in 3 patients. In the >65 years old group 
cardiac failure, tachycardia and sinus tachycardia were reported in one patient each. Occurrence of 
grade ≥ 3 AEs and occurrence of grade ≥3 suspected to study treatment were similar across the 
subgroups (18 to 65 years old group and >65 years old group). Patients with SAEs were higher the 
>65 years old group (82.8%) compared to the 18 to 65 years old group (66.9%). This was mainly due 
to infections and infestations (51.7%) (sepsis in 20.7% and pneumonia in 13.8%). Occurrence of all 
other SOCs and PTs were similar in the 18 to 65 years old group and in 65 years old group. In the 18 
to 65 years old, there were 47 deaths (28.3%) and in the >65 years old group there were 14 deaths 
(48.3%). Among the 47 deaths in the 18 to 65 years old, 22 (13.3%) were due to study indication and 
25 (15.1%) were due to other reason. The applicant has not provided this comparison for the BAT 
arm.  
For cGvHD REACH-3, the median duration of exposure of RUX was similar across the subgroups (41.4 
weeks in the 18 to 65 years old group (N=193); 42.6 weeks in the > 65 years old group (N=25). The 
AE profile was similar between age groups (12 to <18 years old group (N=8), 18 to 65 years old group 
and >65 years old group with few exceptions. Treatment related AEs (all grades and grade ≥3) were 
lower in 12 to <18 years old group compared to other subgroups. The proportion of patients with at

least one AE was 94.8% in 18 to 65 years old group, and 100% in >65 years old group. The proportion 
of patients with grade ≥ 3 AEs or SAEs was similar across the age groups. In study D2301, there were 
15 deaths (7.8%) in the 18 to 65 years old group and 4 deaths (16.0%) in the 65 years old group. The 
applicant has not provided this comparison for the BAT arm. 
Exposure and AEs by gender 
REACH-2: the exposure duration in males (N=116) was 30.7 patient years and in females (N=85) was 
21.1 patient. The AE profile (Occurrence of AEs related to study treatment, grade ≥3 AEs, SAEs, 
treatment related SAEs, fatal SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs requiring dose 
adjustment/interruption, and AEs requiring additional therapy) was similar between the 2 genders. In 
REACH-1, the exposure in males (N=35) was 15.7 patient years and in females (N=36) was 9.9 
patient years. The AE profile was similar between the 2 genders. 
REACH-3: In Study D2301, the exposure duration in females (N=80) was 69.8 patient years and in 
males (N=146) was 125.3 patient years. The AE profile (Occurrence of AEs related to study treatment, 
grade ≥3 AEs, SAEs, treatment related SAEs, fatal SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs requiring 
dose adjustment/interruption, and AEs requiring additional therapy) was similar between the 2 
genders. 
Exposure and AEs by race 
REACH-2: The exposure duration was 35.4 patient years in White (N=141), 8.7 patient years in Asian 
(N=26), and 7.7 patient years in Others (N=34). In Study C2301, AEs and treatment related AEs were 
similar between Whites and Asian and lower compared to Others (56.8%). Grade ≥3 AEs were higher 
in Whites (93.7%) and Asian (92.9%) compared to Others (86.5%), SAEs were higher in Whites 
(74.9%) and Others (70.3%) compared to Asians (60.7%). AEs leading to discontinuation were 
generally comparable in all three races. 
REACH-3: The exposure duration was 139.4 patient years in White (N=170), 35 patient years in Asian 
(N=36), and 20.7 patient years in Others (N=20). AEs were slightly higher in Others (100%) and 
Asian (97.2%) compared to Whites (93.5%). treatment related AEs were higher in Asian (77.8%) 
compared to Whites (56.5%) and Others (60.0%), grade ≥3 AEs were higher in Others (85%) 
compared to Whites (57.6%) and Asian (66.7%), SAEs were higher in Asian (55.6%) and Others 
(55.0%) compared to Whites (37.1%) AEs leading to discontinuation: higher in Asian (30.6%) 
compared to Whites (15.3%) and others (20.0%). 
Exposure and AEs by region 
REACH-2: The exposure duration was 4.6 patient years in Asia (excluding Japan), 3.7 patient years in 
Japan, and 43.5 patient years in Rest of the World. The number of patients in Rest of the World was 
highest (176) compared to patients in Asia (10) and Japan (15). Due to the differences in patient 
numbers, no conclusions could be made on the AEs by region.  
REACH-3: The exposure duration was 10.3 patient years in Asia region, 21.3 patient years in Japan 
and 163.6 patient years in Rest of the World. The number of patients in Rest of the World was higher 
(194) compared to patients in Asia (8) and Japan (24). Due to the differences in patient numbers, no 
conclusions could be made on the AEs by region.

By baseline hepatic impairment status 
REACH-2: In aGvHD, in the RUX arm (including cross over), 130 patients had no hepatic impairment, 
21 patients with mild hepatic impairment, 27 patients with moderate hepatic impairment, and 23 
severe hepatic impairment. Proportion of patients with SAEs in the no hepatic impairment group was 
67.7% (n=88) and comparable between mild (n=16, 76.2%), moderate (n=17, 63.0%), and severe 
(n=18, 78.3%) groups. The fatal SAEs were 39 cases (21.9%) in the no hepatic impairment group, 
and 7 cases (28.0%) in the mild group, 14 cases (37.0%) in the moderate group, and 9 cases (39.1%) 
in the severe group. AEs leading to discontinuation in the no hepatic impairment group was 30.3% (54 
cases) whereas in the mild, moderate and severe groups, it was 20.0% (5 cases), 38.2% (13 cases), 
and 28.6% (10 cases) respectively. No new safety concerns identified when safety data including 
hematological abnormalities were evaluated between patients with hepatic impairment and with no 
hepatic impairment at baseline. 
In REACH-1, no notable differences were observed in the AE profile, laboratory abnormalities and 
clinical chemistry in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment at baseline. 
REACH-3 In cGvHD, the RUX arm (including cross over), most of the patients (n=205) had no hepatic 
impairment, 14 patients with mild hepatic impairment, 4 patients with moderate hepatic impairment, 
and 3 severe hepatic impairment. The proportion of patients with SAEs in the no hepatic impairment 
group was in 41.5% and was 42.9% in the mild group. One out of 4 patients had SAEs in the moderate 
(25%) and 2 out of 3 patients in the severe group (66.7%). Fatal SAEs in no hepatic impairment group 
were noted in 6.3%. In the mild and severe groups fatal SAEs were in 21.4% and 33.3%. There were 
no cases of fatal SAEs in the moderate group. Proportion of patients with AEs leading to 
discontinuation in the no hepatic impairment was 18.0%. In mild and severe groups, it was noted in 
14.3% and 66.7%, respectively. In the moderate group, none of the 4 patients had an AEs leading to 
discontinuation. As there are few patients in the moderate and severe groups, these results should be 
interpreted with caution. No new safety concerns were identified. 
By baseline renal impairment status 
REACH-2: In aGvHD, 137 patients had no renal impairment at baseline, 49 in mild, 15 in moderate 
renal impairment groups. There were no patients with severe renal impairment. The proportion of 
patients with SAEs were 68.6% in no renal impairment group, similar to mild (69.4%) and moderate 
(73.3%) groups. The proportion of patients with fatal AEs were also similar across no renal impairment 
group (24.1%), mild (22.4%), and moderate (26.7%) groups. The AEs leading to discontinuation were 
in 28.5% in no renal impairment group, 34.7% in the mild group and in 20.0% in the moderate group.  
REACH-3: In cGvHD, 117 patients had no renal impairment at baseline, 71 in mild, 35 moderate, and 2 
severe renal impairment. The proportion of patients with SAEs were similar across the groups (41.9% 
in no renal impairment group, 38.0% in the mild group, and 42.9% in the moderate group), Also, the 
proportion of patients with fatal AEs were similar across the groups (8.5% in no renal impairment 
group, 7.0% in the mild group, and 5.7% in the moderate group). The AEs leading to discontinuation 
in the no renal impairment was 16.2%, similar to the moderate group (17.1%). In the mild group, AEs 
leading to discontinuation (22.5%) was slightly higher than in the no renal impairment.  
Safety in cross-over population 
It is acknowledged that the cross over groups (n=49) are expected to have more advanced disease. 
There were no new safety concerns identified between RUX randomized arm and crossover group in 
either pivotal study. In REACH 2, a similar proportion of patients had at least one AE in the ruxolitinib

arm (99.3%, grade ≥ 3: 91.4%) and in the cross-over group (95.9%, grade ≥3: 89.8%). The 
incidence of AEs, treatment related SAEs, and AEs requiring dose adjustment/interruption and 
additional therapy was also similar in the ruxolitinib arm and cross-over group. The incidence of SAEs, 
fatal SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were higher in the cross-over group than in the 
ruxolitinib randomized group but notably treatment related events were similar. In REACH 3 the 
incidence of SAEs, fatal SAEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was lower to that of the 
ruxolitinib randomized arm. Thus overall, it can be concluded that in general the safety of the cross 
over group is similar for the cross over patients 
Post marketing experience 
Published information on the safety of RUX is evaluated on an ongoing basis and is available in the 
PSURs for RUX, with PSUR 10 covering the period 23-Feb-2019 to 22-Feb-2020, please refer to section 
5. 
RUX was approved on 16 Nov 2011 for treatment of MF. An estimate of patient exposure is calculated 
based on worldwide sales volume in kilograms (kg) active substance sold during the reporting interval 
and the Defined Daily Dose of 30 mg. The sales volume of RUX cumulatively up to 22 Feb 2020 (PSUR 
10 data cut off) since the IBD of the product was estimated to be approximately 1,670.75 kg active 
substance (Novartis 1175.20 kg and Incyte 495.55 kg). The estimated cumulative exposure was 
approximately 152,580 PTY as discussed in PSUR 10 (reporting period 23-Feb-2019 to 22-Feb-2020). 
The Risk Management Plan (RMP) continues to adequately describe the measures to manage risk. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Due to the differences in study populations in acute GvHD and chronic GvHD, the clinical manifestation 
and time elapsed since transplant, the extent of exposure is markedly different between the diagnoses. 
This accounts for the RUX arm but also for the BAT arms. Many AEs can be difficult to distinguish from 
symptoms of aGvHD or by the transplant procedure itself. The exposure differed significantly between 
the acute GvHD studies and the chronic GvHD setting. In aGvHD (REACH-2) the median duration of 
exposure to RUX was 63.0 days (range: 6.0 to 396.0) and for BAT 29.0 days (range: 1.0 to 188.0). In 
contrast, in the chronic setting the median duration of exposure was 42.6 weeks (range: 21.7-74.6) in 
the RUX arm and 25.2 (range: 22.7-41.1) weeks in the BAT arm. Due to the differences in the study 
populations, study structure in the Phase 3 studies and differences in AE frequency and patterns, the 
safety data are separately presented for aGvHD and cGvHD. Overall, the exposure to RUX in presented 
studies was considered sufficient to allow for a primary assessment of safety in patients representative 
of the intended target population, long-term safety data has not been presented and is listed as 
missing information in the RMP. 
It is noted that out of the selected AESIs, growth retardation, PML and tuberculosis, there were no 
patients under these safety topics in any of the three presented studies. Other selected AESIs, e.g., 
dizziness, headache, flatulence, constipation and facture, were either not reported or low and 
comparable between the treatment arms. 
The comparator in respective study, consist of 9 and 10 subsets of treatment choices for aGvHD and 
cGvHD, respectively, of whom some treatment choices are the same and some are unique for the 
respective study. 
In REACH-2 the rate of discontinuation until day 28 was acceptable with 11.2% discontinuing due to an 
AE (mostly grade 3) with as main AE anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The majority of patients with 
aGVHD required at least one dose change or interruption of RUX (82.9%), with as primary reason AEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 157/177 
 
 
 
(57.2%), additionally a large proportion of subjects had a dose interruption by physician decision 
(19.1%) thus not classified as a discontinuation due to AE or lack of efficacy. However, the CRFs did 
not collect the reason for the physician decision and as such the reason for dose change or dose 
interruption cannot be analysed for approximately 20% of the study population.  
The side effects profile in the ruxolitinib arm is mainly characterised by hematological adverse events 
and infections, consistent with the mechanism of action of ruxolitinib and these are known ADRs for 
ruxolitinib. However, due to the new indications proposed, aGvHD and cGvHD, which are two 
populations much more vulnerable with respect to both cytopenias and infections, these ADRs are also 
the main ADRs in the comparator arm.  
With respect to the short time, 28 days, to the primary endpoint in REACH-2 study compared to the 
time up to primary endpoint in the cGvHD study REACH-3, Cycle 7 Day 1, and in addition, for both 
studies the double median exposure time on ruxolitinib compared to the BAT arm, complicated by the 
variety of BAT choices, comparisons between the two studies and between treatment arms is 
challenging. Hence, incidence of AE up to the data cut-off should be viewed with consideration of 
duration of exposure, population studied as well as the spectrum of BAT treatments.  
By time of Secondary analysis, DCO for aGvHD the most commonly affected AEs by SOC were 
infections and infestations (81.6% of patients) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (71.1% of 
patients) for the RUX arm and for the BAT arm, 71.3% and 51.3% for SOC infections and infestations 
and blood and lymphatic system disorders, respectively.  
The pattern for cGvHD is similar, namely by time of DCO the Main treatment period for cGvHD the 
most commonly affected AEs by SOC were infections and infestations (71.5% of patients) and blood 
and lymphatic system disorders (46.1% of patients) for the RUX arm and for the BAT arm, 65.8% and 
24.1% for SOC infections and infestations and blood and lymphatic system disorders, respectively. 
Analysis of AEs that were judged as permanent was based mainly on AEs that were not recovered/not 
resolved in patients who discontinued and who have finished their 30-day safety follow-up.  
In both REACH-2 and RECAH-3, the most frequent AEs that were not resolved were cytopenias, all 
other SAEs were reported infrequent and with no specific pattern and not leading to new safety 
concerns.  
Furthermore, there is a considerable difference with respect to SAEs, fatal SAEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuations and AEs leading to dose adjustment/interruption in relation to ruxolitinib treatments 
in acute and chronic GvHD. 
Since the incidences of AEs by SOC and by PT differs, in some respects, from those for the already 
approved ruxolitinib indications, a separate ADR table presenting data for the two pivotal studies in 
GvHD and the frequencies (all grades and grade 3/4), is introduced in the SmPC. This is endorsed. 
Cross over from BAT towards RUX was allowed in the study and it is reassuring that the type of AEs for 
cross over patients was similar and there were no new safety concerns identified and therefore, 
inclusion in the table in SmPC 4.8 is acceptable. 
The results for primary cause of death did not show any new safety signals compared to the primary 
analysis results. A detrimental effect on OS of ruxolitinib cannot be concluded based on still immature 
data (please refer to efficacy section).  
The rate of malignancy relapse/progression was roughly similar for ruxolitinib and BAT in each of the 
pivotal trials. 
Subgroups

Subgroup analyses of patients with baseline hepatic or renal impairment in REACH - and REACH-3 
were provided. There was no clear trend that patients with more severe baseline hepatic or renal 
impairment are at increased risk, but the assessment is hampered by sample size and numbers were 
not robust over the categories. Importantly, no new safety concerns were identified in patients with 
severe hepatic or renal impairment and the starting RUX dose will not be reduced, as the dose is 
already low, and there is a need to ensure an adequate dose for efficacy. For renal impairment no 
specific dose adjustments are advised for mild or moderate renal impairment, which is accepted.  
The comparison with BAT in the elderly age group shows that in REACH 2, patients older than 65 
experience more grade 3 or higher AEs in RUX arm (95.2%) than in BAT (79.2%) and more were 
considered treatment related in the RUX arm. This was also confirmed with higher percentages SAE, 
AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs leading to dose adjustments and AEs requiring additional therapy. 
However, the sample size limits accurate definition of incidences.  
A conclusion of ruxolitinib safety evaluation in adolescents is not readily feasible due to the low 
number of participants. With respect to patients >65 year of age, besides also a more limited number, 
these patients are already selected, with regard to few or any co-morbidities, before entering the allo-
transplant procedure. However, no data points towards a significant different AE profile between the 
age groups. The death rate is higher in patients >65 years in both the aGvHD and cGvHD study. 
Long term safety aspects 
In study REACH-2, one patient experienced a DLBCL (grade 3) up to data cut-off which was assessed 
not related to RUX treatment. In the chronic GvHD population REACH3, up to Cycle 7 Day 1, 
malignancy events were reported in 1.2%, judged as not related to RUX and no new events reported 
at the time of the data cut-off. Thus, within this reporting period the risk for malignancies is low even 
with prolonged exposure (as in cGvHD). Long-term safety data including secondary malignancies are 
listed in the RMP as missing information and relevant information are incorporated in SmPC section 
4.4. and 4.8.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety  
In study REACH-2, 3 patients reported events of bone pain, musculoskeletal pain and osteoporosis 
(n=1 each), with low grade and 1 patient reported osteoporosis as a grade 2 event (on study day 106) 
resolving after treatment and considered not related to RUX. In REACH-3, no notable findings were 
observed in Tanner staging assessment. The non-clinical data showed that ruxolitinib administration to 
juvenile rats (PND 21, roughly corresponding to 2-year-old children) was associated with reduced bone 
size (diameter and/or lengths). Serious adverse effects consisting of degeneration of the physis and 
physeal fractures have been observed at higher systemic exposures when starting to dose from PND 7 
(corresponding to preterm/neonate). Results in adolescent patients with sequential DEXA scan results 
revealed no clinically relevant change in the bone mineral density during the study, although data was 
limited to 4 subjects in RUX arm and 4 subjects in BAT arm. Additionally, no clinically relevant change 
in the weight and height was noted, which is reassuring.  
Thus, the available DEXA scans and data on growth and development in adolescents in REACH-2 and 
REACH-3 studies did not confirm the safety concerns associated with bone toxicity. Moreover, the 
clinical relevance of the non-clinical results for the current indication for adults and adolescents is 
limited. Considering the information available in paediatric patients (<12 years) is very limited at this 
point in time, the applicant adds this information as missing information in the RMP. Overall, the safety 
profile in adolescents could be considered similar to adults, although uncertainties are identified with 
respect to the small number of subjects and reassurance on the potential for bone toxicity is needed. 
When available Tanner and bone density measures and preliminary safety assessment of ongoing

paediatric studies (Study INC424F12201 [REACH-4] in aGvHD and Study INC424G12201 [REACH-5] in

2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of RUX-treated patients in both acute and chronic is consistent with its 
established safety profile and as expected in the study population. The safety profile of Jakavi is mainly 
characterised by cytopenias and infections. No new safety concerns were identified in the present 
GvHD studies with ruxolitinib therapy; however, ruxolitinib may be less tolerable in the GvHD setting 
compared to that of myelofibrosis or PV but appears to be manageable with the dose modification 
guidance.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative treatment option for a 
variety of hematologic malignancies and also several non-malignant hematologic diseases.  
Acute GvHD develops in 50% to 70% of patients after alloSCT with conventional prophylaxis and is one 
of the major barriers to successful transplant outcomes. The median time to onset (grade II-IV) of 20-
25 days after engraftment.  
The pathogenesis of aGVHD is complex and is initiated when alloreactive donor immune cells recognize 
immunologically disparate antigens in the host. The risk of developing aGVHD depends on the degree 
of HLA match, recipient age, graft source, underlying disease diagnosis, intensity of conditioning 
regimen and GVHD prophylaxis used.  
The clinical manifestations are seen primarily in three organs: the skin (maculopapular erythematous 
skin rash, erythroderma), the liver (cholestasis, hyperbilirubinemia, and/or jaundice), and the lower 
and upper gastrointestinal tract (nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, anorexia with weight loss, 
secretory diarrhea, GI bleeding and/or ileus). 
Patients who develop steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (SR-aGVHD) after allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation have poor prognosis. Systemic corticosteroids are the recommended 
first-line treatment of grades II to IV aGVHD, but less than 50% of patients achieve durable responses. 
The reported 6-month survival estimate for patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD is approximately 
50%, with 30% or less of patients surviving beyond 2 years 
Chronic GvHD is a major long-term complication after alloSCT, occurring most frequently after 100 
days post-transplant with a median time to onset reported as 162 days post-transplant. While aGvHD 
is mainly a mature donor T cell-mediated inflammatory disease, cGvHD is characterized by the 
activation of complex signalling pathways in both T and B cells, reduced levels of circulating regulatory 
B cells (Bregs) and CD4+ Tregs 
Among patients who undergo alloSCT, cGvHD occurs in 30% to 70% of patients. The occurrence of 
cGvHD varies depending on the donor type. Approximately 30% of cGvHD are de novo without any 
preceding aGvHD. 
Chronic GvHD is a leading cause of non-relapse mortality and morbidity in patients surviving more 
than 2 years after transplantation and unfavourably affects physical and functional well-being as well 
as quality of life of most of the patients who are otherwise cured for their underlying disease after 
HSCT. Mild cGvHD is associated with a good prognosis whereas moderate and severe disease are 
associated with higher treatment-related mortality and lower survival. The 2-year overall survival (OS) 
reported for mild, moderate, and severe disease is 97%, 86%, and 62%, respectively. 
Children are at less risk for GVHD than adults; however, that risk is still significant especially when 
using alternative donor sources. The incidence of grade II–IV aGvHD in children ranges from 28 to 
56%, depending on the degree of histocompatibility, recipient age, underlying condition, and 
conditioning regimen used. The mortality in adolescent patients ≥ 12 years of age is, however, similar 
to that in adults (49% survive beyond 6 months). Grade II-IV SR-aGvHD adult 
Chronic GvHD usually involves not only the epithelial target tissues affected in classic aGvHD (GI tract,

liver, skin,) but also additional organ systems including lungs, muscles, fascia, joints, genitalia, eyes, 
and nails. 
The final approved indication is: 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with acute graft versus host 
disease or chronic graft versus host disease who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other 
systemic therapies. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no uniformly used, second-line treatments following corticosteroid resistance or sustained 
need, in SR-GvHD. Ibrutinib has been approved by FDA and Health Canada for the treatment of adult 
patients with cGvHD after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. Ruxolitinib is registered for 
the treatment of aGvHD in the US since 2019, and therefore, practices vary as to the selection of 
various systemic therapies but also depending on availability (e.g., ECP). There are no products 
approved for steroid refractory GVHD in the EU. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The Applicant provided two pivotal studies to support the two claimed indications,  
- CINC424C2301 (REACH-2): A phase III randomized open-label multi-centre study of ruxolitinib 
versus BAT in patients with corticosteroid-refractory acute graft vs. host disease after allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation. Initiated 10-Mar-2017 and a DCO of 25-Jul-2019 for the primary analysis and 06-
Jan-2020, DCO for second analysis. The study is ongoing. 
- CINC424D2301 (REACH-3): A phase III randomized open-label multi-centre study of ruxolitinib 
versus BAT in patients with corticosteroid-refractory chronic graft vs. host disease after allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation. Study initiation date: 29-Jun-2017 and DCO 08-May-2020 for the primary 
analysis. The study is ongoing. 
A supportive Phase 2 study, INCB 18424-271 (REACH-1) was performed in SR-aGvHD.  
The choice of best available therapy (BAT) for the control group in the two presented pivotal studies, 
was decided by the Investigator, from a list defined in the protocol before randomization in respective 
study. 
Some treatment options were the same for aGvHD and cGvHD (Extracorporeal photopheresis 
(ECP)low-dose methotrexate (MTX) mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) mTOR inhibitors (everolimus or 
sirolimus) infliximab, while the choices anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), mesenchymal stromal cells 
(MSC) and etanercept were unique for REACH-2 (aGvHD); and rituximab, pentostatin, imatinib and 
ibrutinib were unique choices for REACH-3 (cGvHD). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pivotal study REACH-2; ruxolitinib versus vs BAT in SR-aGvHD 
•  ORR on Day 28 (primary endpoint, primary analysis) was 62.3% (95% CI: 54.2, 70.0) in the 
RUX arm and 39.4% (95% CI: 31.6, 47.5) in the BAT arm (p<0.0001, stratified Cochrane-
Mantel-Haenszel test, one-sided, odds ratio: 2.64 with 95% CI: 1.65, 4.22). The results were 
maintained at the Second analysis. 
Assessment report

Subgroup analysis (follow-up data up + 6 months) indicated consistent results with that of the 
Primary analysis results. The OR favoured ruxolitinib across most of baseline characteristics 
subgroups. 
•  Durable ORR at Day 56 (key secondary endpoint, primary analysis) were in favour of 
ruxolitinib (OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.43, 3.94; p=0.0005). Results were maintained at the second 
analysis. 
•  Median DOR was longer in RUX arm (163 days, range: 22.0 to 623.0) than in BAT arm (101 
days, range: 10.0 to 456.0). 
•  At Day 56, more patients in ruxolitinib arm (22.1%) had tapered off corticosteroids than in BAT 
arm (14.8%) 
Pivotal study REACH-3; ruxolitinib vs BAT in SR-cGvHD 
• 
• 
The ORR (Cycle 7 Day 1, primary endpoint, primary analysis) was 49.7% (95%CI: 41.8, 57.6) 
in the RUX arm and 25.6% (95%CI: 19.1, 33.0) in the BAT arm, odds ratio = 2.99 (95% CI: 
1.86, 4.80) (stratified CMH test p<0.0001, one-sided). 
FFS (failure free survival) showed a hazard ratio = 0.370 (95% CI: 0.268, 0.510), p<0.0001 in 
favour of the RUX arm. The 6-months FFS probability was 74.89% (95% CI: 67.48, 80.85) in 
the RUX arm and 44.46% (95% CI: 36.46, 52.14) in the BAT arm.  
•  Significant improvement in TSS, cycle 7 day 1 (second Key secondary endpoint) was shown for 
the RUX arm compared to the BAT arm at the primary analysis. The odds ratio (RUX/BAT) was 
2.62 (95% CI: 1.42, 4.82, stratified CMH test, p = 0.0011). 
•  Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, a numerically larger proportion of patients in the RUX arm (24.2%) had 
completely tapered off corticosteroids vs. 16.8% in the BAT arm. 
In GvHD paediatric patients (12 years of age and older), the safety and efficacy of Jakavi are 
supported by evidence from the randomised phase 3 studies REACH2 and REACH3 (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). In REACH2, responses were observed at day 28 in 4/5 adolescent 
patients with acute GvHD (3 had CR and 1 had PR) in the ruxolitinib arm and in 3/4 adolescent 
patients (3 had CR) in the BAT arm. In REACH3, responses were observed at cycle 7 day 1 in 3/4 
adolescent patients with chronic GvHD (all had PR) in the ruxolitinib arm and in 2/8 adolescent 
patients (both had PR) in the BAT arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Both of the pivotal studies are characterised by high numbers of protocol deviations (PD), relating e.g., 
to aGVHD grading/staging, response assessment and the use of prohibited medication, which raised 
concerns, not least due to the open-label nature of the studies.  For REACH-2, 36.4% of the 
participants in the RUX arm and 43% in the BAT and for REACH 3, 41.8% in the RUX arm and 43.9% 
in the BAT arm, were excluded from the sensitivity analyses. A GCP inspection found that the process 
for PD management was not robust enough and should have been improved in order to enhance a 
timely resolution of PD, e.g., related to prohibited medication and organ staging assessment done per 
investigator criteria/judgement rather Harris. 
Furthermore, with regard to BAT treatment accountability, which was not mandatory per study 
protocols, the inspection found that the Applicant failed to assure for non-IMP appropriate traceability 
and compliance (i.e., not compliant with the Guidance documents applying to clinical trials guidance on 
investigational medicinal products (IMPs) and 'non investigational medicinal products' (NIMPs) (rev. 1, 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 165/177 
 
 
 
 
March 2011)"). In the worst scenario for the REACH 2, 12% of the trial participants and for the REACH 
3, 41% of the trial participants receiving BAT, treatment compliance was not/insufficiently monitored. 
This introduces some uncertainty about estimates. 
aGVHD 
For the primary endpoint of REACH-2, patients were assigned as failing to reach OR, if there was a 
need to intensify immunosuppression. Thus, it is presently unclear whether to understand the 
contribution of Jakavi to the treatment armamentarium is mainly as an alternative treatment option, 
and to what extent it contributes to a greater total treatment efficacy  
Most responses noted at ORR Day 28, had already occurred at Day 14 (other secondary endpoint). 
However, ORR Day 56 (Durable ORR at Day 56) reveal that ORR dropped by 37% in the RUX arm and 
by 44% in the BAT arm between these two datum points, i.e. early responses, but for at large subset 
of responding patients, a short duration. Thus, there is some uncertainty about the extent of benefit 
shown.  
cGVHD 
Even though an updated OS analysis has been performed, data are still immature,  
For the primary endpoint, patients were assigned as failing to reach OR, if there was a need to 
intensify immunosuppression. Thus, it is unclear whether to understand the contribution of Jakavi to 
the treatment armamentarium is mainly as an alternative treatment option or to what extent it 
contributes to a greater total treatment efficacy.  
FFS is a composite endpoint, as described above. As anticipated, this endpoint is driven by impact on 
addition or initiation of another systemic therapy, while there is no indication of any impact of 
treatment on relapse of underlying disease or non-relapse mortality.  
For REACH 3 most responses noted for the primary endpoint ORR Cycle 7 Day 1, had already occurred 
at Cycle 4 Day 1 (other secondary endpoint). The endpoint BOR shows that one third of the initial 
responses to ruxolitinib were no longer recorded at the timepoint of the primary endpoint in cGvHD. 
However, early discontinuation, deaths, changes in systemic cGvHD treatment before Cycle 7 Day 1 or 
missing visits were the main reasons for the differences in BOR and ORR therefore, not necessarily 
meaning treatment failure or loss of response in all cases.  
The patient reported outcome TSS (second key secondary endpoint) derives from an open-label study. 
The risk of bias due to this cannot be measured or ascertained. Furthermore, the “mLSS” symptom 
scale on which TSS was based, according to the GCP inspectors, was not validated prior to start of the 
trial.  
REACH-2 and REACH-3 
Efficacy in patients with low grade GvHD and in patients who received more than one prior systemic 
treatment for SR GvHD has not been investigated (for both pivotal trials).  
The number of investigated adolescent patients is very limited (n=9 in total for both pivotal trials), 
emphasizing the need for extrapolation of adult data.  
Response rates seem similar to BAT or even more in favour of BAT in small subgroups of patients >65 
years of age (aGvHD), region Asia (a+cGvHD) and some subgroups with prior steroid + CNI + other 
systemic therapy for a or cGvHD. With regard to this last subgroup, heterogeneity in previously 
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022  
Page 166/177 
 
 
 
 
allowed as well as concomitant treatment and prophylaxis regimes for GvHD make it difficult to 
interpret results.  
The impact of RUX in terms of OS is uncertain since interpretation of data is hampered by cross-over in 
>30% of patients in both trials.  
Efficacy in patients with overlap syndrome, GvHD after pre-emptive treatment of malignancy 
recurrence with donor lymphocyte infusion and patients that did not tolerate steroid treatment is 
unknown. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
aGvHD REACH-2  
The side effects profile by SOC is mainly characterised by hematological adverse events and infections. 
Other AEs by SOC frequently seen in were investigations, GI-disorders, general disorders, metabolism 
and nutrition and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.  
•  AEs leading to treatment discontinuations Up to Day 28: 11.2% and 4.0% in the RUX arm and 
BAT arm, respectively.  
Up to the second DCO, AEs leading to discontinuation were observed in 27% in the RUX arm 
and 9.3% in the BAT arm. 
•  AEs leading to Dose adjustment or interruption up to Day 28, 36.8% and 9.3% the RUX arm 
and BAT arm, respectively. 
Up to DCO AEs (all grades) leading to dose adjustment or interruption, was 54.6% in the RUX 
arm and 13.3% in the BAT arm Most of the AEs were of grade ≥3 in severity (in (50.0% and 
9.3%), driven by cytopenias. 
•  Deaths up to Day 28: there were 9.9% and 14.0% on-treatment deaths recorded in RUX arm 
and the BAT arm, respectively. The primary reason for death was aGvHD. 
Up to DCO there were a total of 168 deaths, 53.9% deaths in the RUX arm and 57.3% deaths 
in the BAT arm. Deaths due to aGvHD occurred in 24.3% in the RUX arm and 25.3% in the 
BAT arm. 
•  SAEs Up to Day 28: 37.5% in the RUX arm and 34.0% in the BAT arm. By SOC: Infections and 
infestations (21.7% vs. 17.3%) and by PT, Sepsis (5.3% vs. 2.0%), CMV infection (2.6% vs. 
3.3%), Respiratory failure and septic shock (2.6% vs. 2.7%, each) and Pneumonia (2.0% 
each) 
SAEs Up to DCO were reported in 66.4% patients in RUX arm and 53.3% in BAT arm. The 
difference was mainly driven by the SOC of infections and infestations (38.2% in the RUX arm 
and 30.0% in the BAT arm)  
AESIs 
•  Hematological AEs up to Day 28, with respect to hematological events, were recorded in 58% 
(Gr ≥3: 47.4%) in the RUX arm and 44.7% (Gr ≥3: 4.7%) in the BAT arm. 
AEs by PT, up to Day 28, were thrombocytopenia (50.0% vs. 32.7%) anemia (30.3% vs 
28.0%), leukopenia (32.9% vs 26.7%) neutropenia (15.8% vs. 12.7%) and neutrophil count 
decreased (6.6% vs 10.0%) in the RUX arm and the BAT arm, respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/231935/2022

Up to the Secondary analysis DCO, the overall incidence of thrombocytopenia events increased 
to 56.6% (Grade≥3: 50.7%) in RUX arm and 36.7% (Grade≥3: 32.0%) in BAT arm the overall 
incidence of anemia 40.8% (Grade≥3: 36.2%) in the RUX arm and 34.0% (Grade≥3: 25.3%) in 
the BAT arm leukopenia in 46.7% (Grade≥3: 42.2%) and 32.0% (Grade≥3: 27.3%) in the 
RUX arm and the BAT arm, respectively. 
•  AEs Infections Up to Day 28, were reported in 61.2% the RUX arm vs 58.7% the BAT arm. The 
proportion of opportunistic infections during period up to Day 28 was 27% vs 22% in the RUX 
vs BAT arm and cytomegalovirus infection (25.7% vs. 20.7%). 
AE pneumonia up to Day 28 was seen in 27% vs 22% in the RUX vs BAT arm and CMV 
infections were reported in 28.3% in the RUX arm vs. 24.0% the BAT arm.

Similar to aGvHD as well as the other studied indications, the side effects profile is mainly 
characterised by hematological adverse events and infections. Other AEs by SOC frequently seen in 
were investigations, GI-disorders, general disorders, metabolism and nutrition and respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders as in the pivotal for aGvHD.  
•  AEs leading to Treatment discontinuations: Up to Cycle 7 Day 1: AEs leading to study 
treatment discontinuation were 16.4% vs. 7.0% in the BAT arm. Pneumonia was the most 
common (≥ 2% patients) AE leading to discontinuation in both arms. 
Up to DCO, AEs (all grades) leading to discontinuations were reported in 18.1% and grade ≥3 
AEs in 13.3% of ruxolitinib treated patients.  
•  AEs leading to Dose adjustment or interruption up to Cycle 7 Day 1: AEs leading to dose 
adjustment or interruption were 37.6% vs. 16.5% in the RUX arm and the BAT arm 
respectively. 
AEs leading to Dose adjustment or interruption Up to DCO for the main treatment period 
occurred in 43.0% in the RUX arm and 18.4% in the BAT arm.  
•  Deaths Up to Cycle 7 Day 1: 7.9% patients in the RUX arm and 5.7% patients in BAT arm died 
on treatment. Study indication, cGvHD, was the main cause of death.  
Deaths Up to the DCO were 18.8% in the RUX arm and 16.5% in the BAT arm.  
•  SAEs Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, were observed in 33.3% in the RUX arm and 36.7% in the BAT arm. 
By PT, the most frequent SAEs were pneumonia, pyrexia, lower respiratory tract infection, and 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. 
SAEs Up to DCO were seen in 43.6% of patients in the RUX arm and 39.9% in the BAT arm. 
AESIs 
•  Hematological AEs up to Cycle 7, Day 1, were recorded in 41.8% (Gr ≥3 23.0%) in the RUX 
arm and 22.2% (Gr ≥3 15.8%).  
AEs by PT, up Cycle 7 Day 1, subjects with at least one event of thrombocytopenia were 
21.2% vs. 14.6%, anemia 29.7% vs 12.7%, leukopenia 18.8% vs 13.9%) in the RUX arm and 
the BAT arm, respectively. 
Up to the Secondary analysis DCO, events of thrombocytopenia were 23.0% (Grade ≥3: 
17.6%) in the RUX arm and 15.8% (Grade ≥3: 11.4%) in the BAT arm, the overall incidence of 
anemia was 32.1% (Grade ≥3: 15.2%) in the RUX arm and 13.9% (Grade ≥3: 7.6%) in the 
Assessment report

BAT arm, leukopenia in 23.6% (Grade ≥3: 18.8%) and 14.6% (Grade ≥3: 11.4%) in the RUX 
arm and the BAT arm, respectively.  
•  AEs Infection Up to Cycle 7 Day 1, were reported for 62.4% vs. 58.2% in the RUX arm and the 
BAT arm respectively.  
The most frequently reported infectious events by PT (RUX vs BAT arm) were pneumonia 
(10.9% and 12.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.5% and 8.2%), urinary tract infection 
(6.7% and 3.2%), nasopharyngitis (6.1% and 3.8%), BK virus infection (5.5% and 1.3%), 
CMV infection (5.5% and 8.2%), influenza (4.8% and 3.8%), and conjunctivitis (4.8% and 
2.5%). 
•  AE pneumonia up to up to Cycle 7, Day 1 was seen in 11% vs 12% in the respective treatment 
arm (RUX vs BAT) and CMV infections in 9.1% in the RUX arm vs. 10.8% in the BAT arm. 
Other PT CMV infections were also separately reported. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Assessment of the safety profile of ruxolitinib and the crude incidence of AEs is challenging in a setting 
of immune compromised patients with severe underlying disease and concomitant use of 
corticosteroids and CNI bringing uncertainties with respect to the assessment of treatment-related 
AEs. 
The latest updated OS data are 25 Jun 2021 for REACH-3 (22.4% vs 22.0% for the RUX and the BAT 
arm respectively). The allowance of cross-over in both studies creates a bias towards unity with 
regards to the impact of treatment on OS.  
A proportion of treatment related AEs in REACH2 were not resolved at data cut-off, however, this was 
based on AEs that were not recovered/not resolved in patients who discontinued and who have 
finished their 30-day safety follow-up. In both REACH 2 and REACH 3 the most frequent AEs that were 
not resolved were cytopenias, all other SAEs were reported infrequent and with no specific pattern and 
not leading to new safety concerns. 
The requested indication includes adolescents. The AE profile was largely similar to adults with some 
exceptions. Nevertheless, RUX treatment is studied in a limited dataset (5 patients with aGVHD, 4 
patients with cGvHD). 
A significant proportion of subjects in study REACH 2 (19.1%) and REACH 3 (23%) discontinued RUX 
treatment due to physician decision (thus not classified as discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or 
due to an AE), it is unclear what the primary reason for discontinuation is and further information was 
not captured in the CRFs.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The applicant has selected objective response rate as primary endpoint in each of its studies on acute 
and chronic GvHD. While this is anticipated to confer symptomatic benefit, the applicant claims it is a 
surrogate for long term outcomes. The applicant has provided statistically robust evidence of the 
effects of ruxolitinib on this endpoint as defined. However, intensification of immunosuppressive 
treatment was considered failure to reach an objective response in the primary analysis. Thus, it 
remains unclear to what extent this is due to an overall increase in regimen efficacy, and to what 
extent this is due to sparing of other drugs through substitution. In either case, this is considered 
clinical benefit. 
The safety profile of Jakavi is similar to what has been seen in the previously approved indications and 
is dominated by cytopenias and increased risk of infection. There was no apparent increase in the risk 
of relapse or progression of malignancy. 
No effects on OS have been shown, which may be impacted by the cross-over option which creates 
bias towards unity.  
The proposed indication does not specify GvHD type or grade and allows treatment of patients that are 
first line steroid refractory as well as patients that have received multiple systemic therapies for GvHD. 
A reference to section 5.1 in the indication has therefore, been provided with regard to detailed 
information of the studied population. 
Overall, despite one critical finding and several major findings identified during the GCP inspection 
which showed that on several key aspects the processes were not robust for a sound conduct of the 
study and/or failing to prevent deviations from ICH-GCP, it was the recommendation of the inspectors 
that the data of the REACH-2 and REACH-3 clinical trials were of sufficient quality to be used for 
evaluation and assessment of the application, though the inspectors deferred to the assessors for the 
final conclusion on the impact of the lacking documentation on best available therapy (BAT) 
accountability in REACH- 2 and REACH-3. 
Notably, the study protocols for the REACH-2 and REACH-3 clinical trials explicitly warranted drug 
accountability for ruxolitinib only, but according to the most conservative assessment of the inspection 
team, for 12% out of 150 trial participants for REACH-2 and 41% out of 159 patients for REACH-3, 
BAT treatment compliance was insufficiently monitored. For acute GvHD the approximately 12% of 
patients without drug accountability for BAT in REACH-2 still allows sufficient interpretation of clinical 
study results, allowing for a positive B/R.   
Additional exploratory analyses to assess the primary efficacy response of the different types of BAT 
used in the chronic GvHD study REACH-3 showed for each independent BAT a lower ORR than the 
response rate reported in patients treated with RUX, regardless of the administration route and/or 
clinical setting, i.e. in hospital / at home. Furthermore, the in-hospital BATs, which have high drug 
accountability (due to the setting), and the at-home BATs showed similar ORR per BAT. These 
exploratory results together are suggestive of a limited (if any) impact of the potential lower BAT 
compliance (worst case) in the at-home setting.  
As OS is multifactorial, for which BAT compliance is only one parameter of interest, it remains difficult 
to establish whether potential non-compliance in the BAT arm has substantially influenced OS 
outcomes. It is reassuring that with the latest OS update no sign of detriment was observed.

Finally, even if outcomes would have been comparable to BAT, ruxolitinib could still be acceptable as 
new treatment modality for chronic GvHD. Therefore, despite some remaining uncertainties on the 
impact of potential non-compliance on the efficacy results due to the exploratory nature of the 
additional analyses, the B/R of ruxolitinib is considered positive in chronic GvHD as well. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The B/R of Jakavi is positive in acute GvHD and chronic GvHD. Final OS data from REACH-3, including 
modelling of the impact of cross-over, should be provided as a post marketing recommendation. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of patients with acute and chronic GvHD aged 12 years 
and older who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies for Jakavi; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8. 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 14.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representative for The 
Netherlands in the Package Leaflet.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan EMEA-000901-PIP03-16-M01 and EMEA-000901-PIP04-17-M01and the 
results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as 
appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

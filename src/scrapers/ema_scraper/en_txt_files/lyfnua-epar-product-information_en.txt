For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Film-coated tablet (tablet)
Pink, 10 mm, round and convex tablet debossed with “777” on one side and plain on the other side.
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Lyfnua is indicated in adults for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
The recommended dose of gefapixant is one 45 mg tablet taken orally twice daily with or without
food.
Missed dose
Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose, they should skip the missed dose and go back to
the regular schedule. Patients should not double their next dose or take more than the prescribed one.
Special populations
Elderly (≥ 65 years old)
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Gefapixant is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more
likely to have decreased renal function, the risk of adverse reactions to gefapixant may be greater in
these patients. Care should be taken with initial dosing frequency.
Renal impairment
Dose adjustment is required in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2)
not requiring dialysis. The dose should be reduced to one 45 mg tablet taken once daily.
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR
≥ 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2). Insufficient data are available in patients with end-stage renal disease
requiring dialysis to make dosing recommendations (see section 5.2).
2
Hepatic impairment
Patients with hepatic impairment have not been studied. However, given that hepatic metabolism is a
minor route of elimination of gefapixant, no dose adjustment is recommended (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of Lyfnua in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) for the
indication of refractory or unexplained chronic cough.
Method of administration
Oral use.
Tablets should be swallowed whole and may be taken with or without food. Patients should be
instructed not to break, crush or chew the tablets.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Obstructive sleep apnoea
In patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA, n=19) who were not using positive
airway pressure (PAP), gefapixant 180 mg daily at bedtime was associated with a lower mean SaO2
and a higher mean proportion of time with SaO2 < 90% across all sleep stages compared to placebo.
The clinical relevance of these findings for the use of 45 mg gefapixant twice daily in patients with
refractory chronic cough (RCC) or unexplained chronic cough (UCC) with comorbid OSA is not
known. For patients with OSA, appropriate treatment for OSA should be considered prior to initiating
treatment with gefapixant.
Hypersensitivity
Gefapixant contains a sulphonamide moiety but is considered to be a non-sulphonylarylamine.
Gefapixant has not been studied in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulphonamide,
therefore, cross-hypersensitivity with sulphonamide hypersensitivity cannot be excluded. Gefapixant
should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to sulphonamides.
Acute lower respiratory tract infection
Treatment with gefapixant should be evaluated and individualised in patients who develop an acute
lower respiratory tract infection (see section 5.1).
Taste-related adverse reactions 
Taste-related adverse reactions were very commonly reported in the clinical studies. In most patients,
these adverse reactions resolved soon after discontinuation of gefapixant (median time 5 days). In a
few patients, these reactions persisted for more than a year after discontinuation (see section 4.8).
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium free’.
3
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Based on in vitro studies (see section 5.2), relevant clinical interaction studies were performed and no
clinically meaningful interactions have been identified.
Paediatric population
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of gefapixant in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct
or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Lyfnua during pregnancy and in women of childbearing
potential not using contraception.
Lactation
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of gefapixant in milk
(see section 5.3).
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Lyfnua
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the
woman.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of gefapixant on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on
mating or fertility with gefapixant treatment (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Gefapixant has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In individual cases,
dizziness may occur following administration of gefapixant that may influence the ability to drive and
use machines.
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were dysgeusia (41%), ageusia (15%), and hypogeusia
(11%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The safety of gefapixant was evaluated in two phase III clinical studies (COUGH-1 and COUGH-2)
which included a total of 1,369 patients treated with gefapixant (15 mg or 45 mg twice daily) (see
section 5.1). The duration of exposure with gefapixant was 52 weeks.
The adverse reactions reported with gefapixant obtained from clinical studies are listed in the table
below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common
(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000),
and very rare (<1/10,000).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Taste-related adverse reactions
The majority of patients with taste-related adverse reactions (dysgeusia, ageusia, hypogeusia and taste
disorder) experienced the onset of the adverse reactions within 9 days of starting gefapixant; the
majority were mild (65%) to moderate (32%) in intensity. Resolution of the taste-related adverse
reactions occurred in 96% of patients with 25% reporting resolution on or before the last dose of
gefapixant. Taste-related adverse reactions persisted for more than a year after discontinuation in 1.6%
(7/447) of patients in the gefapixant group and 12.8% (6/47) of patients in the placebo group. Adverse
reactions resulting in discontinuation occurred in 22% of patients receiving gefapixant. The most
frequently reported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment were dysgeusia (9%) and
ageusia (4%).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose
In a clinical study with 8 healthy subjects administered gefapixant 1,800 mg twice daily (40 times the
recommended human dose) for up to 14 days, crystals composed of gefapixant were detected in the
urine of participants. No evidence of renal or urinary system injury was observed. 
In cases of overdose reported during the Phase III studies, no adverse events were reported.
In case of overdose, monitor the patient for adverse reactions and institute appropriate supportive
measures. Gefapixant is partially removed by haemodialysis.
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other cough suppressants, ATC code: R05DB29 
Mechanism of action
Gefapixant is a selective antagonist of the P2X3 receptor. Gefapixant also has activity against the
P2X2/3 receptor subtype. P2X3 receptors are ATP-gated ion channels found on sensory C fibres of the
vagus nerve in the airways. C fibres are activated in response to inflammation or chemical irritants.
ATP is released from airway mucosal cells under conditions of inflammation. Binding of extracellular
ATP to P2X3 receptors is sensed as a damage signal by C fibres. Activation of C fibres, which is
sensed by the patient as an urge to cough, initiates a cough reflex. Blockade of ATP signalling through
P2X3 receptors reduces excessive sensory-nerve activation and excessive cough induced by
extracellular ATP.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The efficacy of Lyfnua for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough was studied in
two 52-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adults with either
refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Refractory chronic cough (RCC) was defined as cough
associated with a co-morbid condition (e.g., asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or upper airway
cough syndrome) that persisted despite adequate treatment of the co-morbid condition. Unexplained
chronic cough (UCC) was defined as cough that was not associated with a co-morbid condition despite
a thorough clinical evaluation.
The primary objective of both Phase III studies was to assess Lyfnua efficacy in reducing 24-hour
cough frequency relative to placebo. Reduction in awake cough frequency and cough-specific quality
of life were secondary objectives. In both studies, patients were randomised to twice daily doses of
Lyfnua 45 mg, 15 mg, or placebo. The primary efficacy period for COUGH-1 (NCT03449134) was
12 weeks followed by a blinded extension period of 40 weeks. The primary efficacy period for
COUGH-2 (NCT03449147) was 24 weeks, followed by a blinded extension period of 28 weeks.
Patients enrolled in COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 were current non-smokers, not on angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diagnosed with RCC or UCC, and had chronic cough for greater
than 1 year. Most patients were female (75%), white (80%), and from Europe (53%) with a mean age
of 58 years (range 19 to 89) and 7% of patients were older than 75 years. A total of 61.5% of patients
were diagnosed with RCC, 38.5% with UCC, and the mean duration of chronic cough was 11 years.
Cough frequency
In COUGH-1 and COUGH-2, patients treated with Lyfnua 45 mg twice daily demonstrated a
significant reduction in 24-hour cough frequency compared with placebo (Table 2). The reduction in
the 24-hour cough frequency was observed by Week 4 and persisted throughout the primary efficacy
period (12 weeks in COUGH-1 and 24 weeks in COUGH-2; Figure 1).
6
The gefapixant 15 mg twice daily group did not demonstrate a significant reduction in 24-hour cough
frequency in either study.

Cough-specific quality of life
COUGH-2 was specifically designed to assess the impact of Lyfnua on cough-specific quality of life
relative to placebo as measured by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (possible score ranges
from 3 to 21, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life). A ≥ 1.3 point increase from
baseline in the LCQ total score was defined as clinically meaningful. In COUGH-2, the odds of having
a clinically meaningful improvement in cough-specific quality of life were significantly greater in the
Lyfnua 45 mg treatment group than in the placebo group as measured at Week 24 (see Table 3).

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with
Lyfnua (gefapixant) in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of unexplained or chronic
refractory cough (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of gefapixant were studied in healthy adults and in adults with RCC or UCC
and were similar between these two populations. The steady-state mean plasma AUC and peak
concentration (Cmax) are 4,144 ng∙hr/mL and 531 ng/mL with gefapixant 45 mg twice daily treatment.
Steady state is achieved within 2 days, with an accumulation ratio of 1.4- to 1.5-fold.
Absorption
Following oral administration of gefapixant, the time to achieve peak plasma concentrations (Tmax)
ranged from 1 to 4 hours. Exposure increases are dose-proportional following multiple doses up to
300 mg twice daily. The fraction absorbed for gefapixant is at least 78%.
Effect of food
Relative to fasting conditions, oral administration of a single dose of gefapixant 50 mg with a standard
high fat and high calorie meal had no effect on the AUC or Cmax of gefapixant.
Distribution
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the mean steady-state apparent volume of distribution
is estimated to be 138 L following oral administration of a 45 mg dose. 
In vitro, gefapixant exhibits low plasma protein binding (55%) and has a blood-to-plasma ratio of 1.1.
Based on preclinical studies, gefapixant has low CNS penetration.
Biotransformation
Hepatic metabolism is a minor route of gefapixant elimination, involving oxidation and
glucuronidation. Following oral administration of [14C] gefapixant, 14% of the administered dose was
recovered as metabolites in the urine and faeces. Unchanged gefapixant is the major drug-related
component in plasma (87%), and each circulating metabolite accounted for less than 10% of the total
radioactivity detected.
Elimination
Renal excretion is the major route of elimination of gefapixant and involves both passive renal
filtration and active transport mechanisms. Gefapixant is recovered in urine as parent (~64%) or
metabolites (~12%), and the remainder is recovered in feces as parent (~20%) or metabolites (~2%).
Active renal secretion is estimated to account for ≤ 50% of total elimination. In vitro, gefapixant is a
substrate of MATE1, MATE2K, P-gp, and BCRP transporters. Gefapixant has a terminal half-life (t½)
of 6 – 10 hours.
Special populations
Renal impairment
Renal excretion is the major route of elimination of gefapixant. Mild or moderate renal impairment
(eGFR  30 mL/minute/1.73 m2) does not have a clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of
gefapixant.
9
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis including patients with refractory or unexplained chronic
cough, the mean AUC and Cmax of gefapixant were predicted to increase by 89% and 54%,
respectively, in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2) compared to
those with normal renal function. To maintain similar systemic exposures to those with normal renal
function, dose adjustment is recommended (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment
Hepatic metabolism is a minor route of elimination. Most of an oral dose was recovered as unchanged
parent in the urine (64%) or faeces (20%). A dedicated study in subjects with hepatic impairment was
not conducted, because hepatic impairment is not likely to have a clinically meaningful effect on
exposure (see section 4.2).
Effects of age, body weight, gender, ethnicity, and race
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, gender, ethnicity, and race do not
have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of gefapixant.
Drug Interactions
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of gefapixant
Hepatic metabolism is a minor pathway for gefapixant elimination, and the potential for clinically
meaningful drug interactions for gefapixant with co-administration of inhibitors or inducers of
cytochrome P450 (CYP) or uridine 5’-diphosphoglucuronic acid glucuronosyl transferase (UGT)
enzymes is low.
Concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, did not have a clinically meaningful effect
on gefapixant pharmacokinetics.
Based on in vitro studies, gefapixant is a substrate of efflux transporters multidrug and toxin extrusion
1 (MATE1), MATE2K, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). In a
Phase 1 clinical study, a single dose of the MATE1/MATE2K inhibitor pyrimethamine increased
gefapixant AUC by 24%, an amount that is not clinically meaningful, and did not affect gefapixant
Cmax.
Effects of gefapixant on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products
Based on in vitro studies, the potential of gefapixant to cause CYP inhibition or induction is low, and
therefore it is unlikely that gefapixant would affect the CYP-mediated metabolism of other drugs.
Gefapixant is an inhibitor of MATE1, MATE2K, and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1
(OATP1B1) and OATP1B3 in vitro. However, the risk of clinically meaningful drug interactions via
inhibition of these transporters is low for gefapixant administered at 45 mg twice daily. The clinical
relevance of in vitro inhibition of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) by gefapixant is not established.
In a Phase 1 clinical study, multiple doses of gefapixant 45 mg did not affect exposure of the OATP1B
substrate pitavastatin.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Repeat dose toxicity
Crystalluria occurred in laboratory animals dosed with gefapixant and the majority of the urinary
crystals were confirmed to be composed of gefapixant.
In a six month repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, microscopic changes in the kidney (distended tubules
due to presence of crystalline material, degeneration of epithelial cells lining tubules and inflammation
in the interstitium), ureter (dilatation and inflammation) and bladder (transitional cell hyperplasia)
were observed at 9 times the exposure in humans at the maximum recommended human dose
(MRHD).
10
In a nine-month repeat-dose oral toxicity study in dogs, crystals were observed in the urine and
microscopic observation of focal, minimal tubular degeneration, involving occasional cortical tubules
was observed in one male dog at 35 times the exposure in humans at the MRHD. 
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies in rats (2-years in duration) and rasH2 transgenic mice (6-months in duration)
with gefapixant showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential (no treatment related tumours) at
exposures up to 9-times (rats) and 4-times (mice) the exposures at the MRHD.
Mutagenesis
Gefapixant was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays including microbial
mutagenesis, chromosomal aberration in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the in vivo rat
micronucleus test.
Reproductive toxicity
In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of gefapixant to pregnant rats and rabbits during
the period of organogenesis showed no evidence of teratogenicity or embryo-fetal lethality at
exposures (AUC) that were 6-times (rats) and 34-times (rabbits) the exposure at the MRHD. A slight
reduction in rat fetal weights, which was associated with maternal toxicity, was observed at an
exposure approximately 11-times the exposure at the MRHD.
Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits showed that gefapixant is transferred to the foetus through the
placenta, with foetal plasma concentrations of up to 21% (rats) and 25% (rabbits) that of maternal
concentrations observed on gestation day 20.
In a lactation study, gefapixant was excreted in milk of lactating rats when administered orally (up to
9-times the exposure at the MRHD) on lactation day 10, with milk concentrations 4 times that of
maternal plasma concentrations observed 1-hour post dose on lactation day 10.
There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development when
gefapixant was administered to female and male rats up to 9-times the exposure at the MRHD.

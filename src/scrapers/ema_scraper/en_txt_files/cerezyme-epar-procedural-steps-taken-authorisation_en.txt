Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The procedure started on 24 January 1997. 
The  Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  7  March 
1997.  The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  
10 March 1997. 
During the meeting on 15 April 1997 the CPMP adopted a draft-consolidated list of questions 
and circulated it for comments by 15 April 1997. 
During the meeting on 16 April 1997  the CPMP agreed on the consolidated list of questions to 
be  sent  to  the  company.  The  final  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  sent  to  the  company  on  
16 April 1997. 
On 14-18 April 1997 an inspection of the active substance manufacture and of the drug product 
manufacture  took  place  at  Allston,  Massachusetts  (USA).  The  Authority  responsible  for  the 
inspection was the Medicines Control Agency (UK). The final Inspection Report on Cerezyme 
active substance manufacture was issued on 6 June 1997. 
The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 7 May 1997. 
The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur circulated the response assessment report on the company’s 
responses to the list of questions to all CPMP Members on 13 June 1997. 
During the meeting on 21 July 1997 the CPMP discussed the recommendations presented by the 
Rapporteur, considering the responses provided by the company were satisfactory. Amendments 
were discussed to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet texts in order to 
ensure  consistency  among  the  two  texts.  Principal  modifications  consist  in  the  addition  of  a 
sentence in section 4.1 of the SPC (Therapy should be directed by physicians knowledgeable in 
the management of Gaucher disease) and deletion, in section 4.4, of a warning on impairment of 
fertility (applicable to Ceredase, but not to Cerezyme). 
During the meeting on 23 July 1997 the CPMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the 
scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a Marketing 
Authorisation to Cerezyme on 23 July 1997. 
The  CPMP  opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the 
European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 17 November 1997.

2.1.  Problem statement 
The indications proposed for Bydureon autoinjector is: 
“Bydureon is indicated in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control 
in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including basal insulin, when the therapy in use, 
together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control (see section 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for 
available data on different combinations).” 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology 
For the year 2015, it was estimated that diabetes affected approximately 415 million people worldwide in the 
age range 20 to 79 years. The majority of patients with diabetes are type 2 diabetes accounting for 87% to 91% 
in high-income countries; the rest are type 1 and other types of diabetes 
Diabetes and its complications are major causes of early death in most countries. People with diabetes have an 
increased risk of developing a number of serious health problems. Consistently high blood glucose levels can 
lead to serious diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. In addition, people 
with diabetes have a higher risk of developing infections. In almost all high-income countries, diabetes is a 
leading cause of CVD, blindness, kidney failure, and lower limb amputation. 
2.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Several risk factors have been associated with T2DM and include family history of diabetes, overweight, 
unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, older age and high blood pressure. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation 
Type 2 diabetes is a complex disorder which involves various degrees of decreased beta-cell function, peripheral 
insulin resistance and abnormal hepatic glucose metabolism. Glucose control in type 2 diabetes deteriorates 
progressively over time, and, after failure of diet and exercise alone, needs on average a new intervention with 
glucose-lowering agents every 3-4 years in order to obtain/retain good control.  
Overweight, hypertension and dyslipidaemia are often associated with diabetes mellitus and multiple 
cardiovascular risk factor intervention is a key issue in type 2 diabetes. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Initial management includes lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. Pharmacological treatment includes 
insulin, biguanides, TZDs, SUs, meglitinides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors 
and GLP-1RA. With the exceptions of insulin and GLP-1RA all are administered orally. 
Despite combination therapy and/or insulin treatment, a sizeable proportion of patients remain poorly 
controlled. One important issue is compliance to treatment. Some medicinal products for injection are 
complicated to administer and there is a need for formulations that are easier to use.

About the product 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Exenatide is a synthetic 39 amino acid peptide with partial sequence homology to the naturally occurring human 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that exhibits many of the same 
glucoregulatory or glucose-lowering actions as the naturally-occurring incretin hormone, but is not substantially 
degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which efficiently degrades native GLP-1 in vivo. 
Exenatide was first approved by the European Commission on 20 November 2006 under the name Byetta. 
Byetta is an immediate-release aqueous formulation. The administration schedule for this formulation is twice 
daily. 
Bydureon, a prolonged-release formulation of exenatide, was approved by the European Commission on 21 June 
2011. The drug delivery technology for the Bydureon formulation uses biodegradable polymeric microspheres, 
which entrap exenatide and provide prolonged release of the peptide over days to months. Once injected 
subcutaneously, the polymer biodegrades over time, thereby releasing the bioactive peptide for absorption into 
the systemic circulation. The Bydureon formulation is comprised of a powder that is combined with an aqueous 
vehicle to form a suspension immediately before injection. It is supplied as a vial and prefilled syringe ‘single 
dose tray’ or as a prefilled pen ‘dual-chamber pen’. 
EQWS is a modified formulation of Bydureon that contains the same drug substance, drug load and 
prolonged-release microspheres as Bydureon, but with a nonaqueous MCT vehicle. The change from the 
aqueous vehicle in Bydureon to a nonaqueous MCT vehicle in EQWS was primarily undertaken to develop a 
formulation that does not require addition of the vehicle immediately before administration and is suitable for 
use with an autoinjector. 
A key factor in the development of the EQWS is the utilisation of the commercially available Bydureon 
microspheres. No changes were made to the microsphere formulation or the manufacturing process. 
The safety and tolerability of exenatide has been documented in the large clinical programmes for Byetta and 
Bydureon. Over 7,000 patients with T2DM have received the immediate-release formulation of exenatide 
(Byetta) and over 5,300 patients have received the prolonged-release aqueous formulation of exenatide 
(Bydureon) in completed clinical trials. 
This submission for the non-aqueous formulation of exenatide (EQWS) administered via an autoinjector is 
supported by data from the Bydureon programme and by 3 completed clinical studies from the EQWS 
programme: 1 Phase 2 study (BCB110) and 2 Phase 3 studies (BCB118 and BCB120). The commercially 
representative device and formulation were used in both of the Phase 3 EQWS studies, whereas the Phase 2 
EQWS study (BCB110) was performed before development of the autoinjector and optimisation of the 
associated volume and concentration. The prolonged-release non-aqueous suspension formulation of exenatide 
for once-weekly administration (EQWS) has been administered to a total of 579 unique subjects in clinical trials. 
Guidance was provided by the CHMP in response to a follow-up request for Scientific Advice. The advice given 
has been adhered to in the design and conduct of the clinical studies.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as prolonged-release suspension for injection in pre-filled pen (BCise) 
containing 2 mg of exenatide as active substance.  
Other ingredients are:  
Powder: poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), sucrose 
Vehicle: medium chain triglycerides 
The product is available in a 2-ml Type I glass cartridge, sealed at one end with a (bromobutyl) rubber seal/cap 
combination (combiseal), and at the other end with a (bromobuty) rubber plunger, the finished medicinal 
product is comprised of the suspension-filled cartridge assembled into the pen, the pen contains an integrated 
needle as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used to manufacture the new pharmaceutical form: prolonged-release suspension for 
injection in pre-filled pen is the same as that used in the manufacture of the currently authorised Bydureon 
powder and solvent for prolonged release suspension for injection and Bydureon powder and solvent for 
prolonged release suspension for injection in pre-filled pen (EU/1/11/696/001-004) 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Exenatide prolonged-release suspension for injection in pre-filled pen is presented as a single use, fixed dose 
pen for subcutaneous injection of 2 mg of exenatide, once weekly. The active substance, exenatide, is a 
glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes to achieve glycaemic control.  
The finished product contains exenatide prolonged-release microspheres that are also components of the 
already authorised Bydureon authorised products and are used unchanged in the proposed new product. 
The exenatide prolonged-release microsphere technology enables patients to achieve continuous glucose 
control with once weekly injections. The pen is designed to simplify and improve the quality of the patient 
injection experience versus the existing Bydureon delivery configurations. The ergonomically designed pen 
utilises a new suspension formulation that eliminates the re-constitution step and enables mixing of the 
microspheres in up to 15 seconds. In addition, a pre-attached needle is hidden from view by a needle shield and 
the pen grip makes it easy to hold to enable pressure-activated injection.  
Pharmaceutical development focused on two key areas: development of the medium chain triglycerides (MCT) 
based suspension formulation and pen device development. Formulation development activities involved 
selection of MCT as an appropriate injection vehicle, understanding the impact of MCT on exenatide 
microspheres and developing an aseptic manufacturing process. 
 In case of pen device, design, performance and human factors engineering necessary to demonstrate that the 
device meet the appropriate device regulatory requirements and standards and it is safe and effective for use by 
the intended use population has been investigated during the pharmaceutical development.

Exenatide is a white to off-white powder. Exenatide is very soluble in water but much less soluble in organic 
solvents. Exenatide is slightly soluble in MCT. To ensure stability, exenatide is stored in tightly sealed containers 
and protected from exposure to excessive humidity by handling and dispensing in a humidity controlled, dry 
environment. 
The finished product consists of exenatide microspheres suspended in a vehicle of medium chain triglycerides 
(MCT). Exenatide microspheres contain poly-(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) and sucrose as excipients. PLG 
controls release of exenatide from the microspheres and sucrose acts as stabiliser. Full details of the formulation 
development of the exenatide microspheres for the Bydureon products have previously been submitted and 
approved. 
Compatibility of exenatide with the formulation excipients has been demonstrated in formulation development 
activities and long term stability studies. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards 
except MCT which comply with In House quality standards. The MCT used in the finished product complies with 
pharmacopoeial standards; however MCT is considered a novel excipient when employed for chronic use via 
subcutaneous injection. MCT has previously been used in commercially available parenteral pharmaceutical 
products as the fat component of parenteral nutrition emulsions. The suitability of MCT in the finished product 
has been demonstrated from a safety and tolerability perspective during preclinical and clinical development 
studies. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
MCT is an injection vehicle, facilitating delivery of the microspheres by the pen device. A non-aqueous vehicle 
was sought because exenatide microspheres are not stable during long term storage in aqueous media. The 
formulation of the finished product was determined following screening of a range of potential non-aqueous 
vehicles with a focus on stability of exenatide and exenatide microspheres within the vehicle. The safety of the 
MCT when dosed subcutaneously has been demonstrated during the development of the finished product.  
In the already authorised finished products, the exenatide microspheres and aqueous suspension vehicle are 
stored separately. The user combines the two components to produce a suspension immediately prior to dosing. 
The aqueous vehicle cannot be combined with the microspheres for long term storage because the microspheres 
are sensitive to water; exenatide release begins after hydration. To enhance the user experience by eliminating 
the constitution step required, a ready to use suspension formulation was sought and a Quality Target Product 
Profile (QTPP) was prepared. A pen was selected as the most appropriate device and development of the 
formulation, container closure and manufacturing process occurred in parallel with device development. 
The objective of the formulation development was to identify a non-aqueous vehicle which would be inert with 
respect to the microspheres and exenatide, facilitating long term storage of the suspension. A key assumption 
was that the new finished product utilised the commercially available exenatide microspheres and no change to 
the microsphere composition or manufacturing process was made. An aseptic manufacturing process was 
developed to combine exenatide microspheres with MCT, producing a bulk suspension that is aseptically filled 
into cartridges. The filled cartridges are then assembled into pens. 
The impact of MCT on microsphere characteristics potentially related to exenatide release was evaluated in 
formulation development studies. No changes in microsphere morphology, thermal properties or porosity were 
observed in the presence of MCT and it was selected as a suitable vehicle for the formulation. This was 
additionally supported by rat PK data, indicating no difference in performance between microspheres suspended 
in MCT for several weeks (aged) compared with those suspended immediately prior to administration. 
Subsequently, long term stability studies have supported the suitability of MCT as a suitable injection vehicle.

Formulation performance was first assessed clinically in a 2-Cohort Phase 2 Study. A suitable sustained-release 
profile of exenatide was observed following a single dose and steady-state plasma concentrations were in the 
desired therapeutic range. The formulation was therefore progressed to further clinical development. The 
applicant has applied Quality by design (QbD) principles in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed. A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) for the 
proposed commercial finished product set out a number of requirements and development studies were carried 
out to define critical quality attributes (CQAs) to ensure these would be met. The CQAs are related to product 
performance are: description, pen device functionality, exenatide release, delivered volume, identity, assay, 
uniformity of content, sterility, impurities, particulate matter, and stability 
Two key elements of the finished product design were the selection of the formulation components and the 
selection of the container closure system, taking into account device considerations. The formulation 
components of the Phase 3 and proposed commercial formulation are the same as those used in early 
development/Phase 2 studies. To facilitate dosing via a single use pen in Phase 3/commercial use, the container 
closure system was selected as a 2 mL Ph. Eur./USP Type 1 glass cartridge sealed at one end with an elastomeric 
seal/cap combination (Combiseal) and elastomeric plunger at the other. The cartridge, plunger and Combiseal 
were selected based on their suitability for sterilisation, depyrogenisation and their ability to maintain sterility 
and stability of the drug product. 
The studies showed that the suspension should be only be used if it is evenly mixed, white to off-white and 
cloudy, with no white medicine seen along the side, bottom or top of the pen window and must be mixed by 
shaking hard for at least 15 seconds 
Injection volume is an important aspect of the QTPP and development studies were carried out to define an 
injection volume that was acceptable from an injectability and manufacturability perspective.  
Exenatide release is controlled by the inherent microsphere characteristics, which are governed by the 
microsphere formulation and manufacturing process. The microspheres are the same as those used in the 
commercially available Bydureon products, therefore the in vitro release methods and specifications used for 
Bydureon have also been applied during the development of the prolonged release solution, to confirm that the 
inherent microsphere release characteristics remained within the acceptable range of performance.  
No bioequivalence study has been performed as the commercial product is identical to that used for the pivotal 
clinical studies. 
The manufacturing process development for exenatide suspension is divided into 4 process stages: bulk 
microsphere manufacture, sieving and dispensing of bulk microspheres, exenatide suspension filled cartridge 
manufacture, and exenatide suspension pen final assembly.  A risk based approach to process development has 
been followed, focusing on the attributes of the product that are critical to ensuring product quality.  
The finished product is manufactured aseptically. 
The primary packaging is in a 2-ml Type I glass cartridge, sealed at one end with a (bromobutyl) rubber seal/cap 
combination  (combiseal),  and  at  the  other  end  with  a  (bromobuty)  rubber  plunger.  The  finished  medicinal 
product is comprised of the suspension-filled cartridge assembled into the pen device. The pen  contains an 
integrated needle. All the selected materials are well established in the pharmaceutical industry as suitable for 
packaging  medicinal  products.  Exenatide  suspension  stability  studies  have  confirmed  the  suitability  of  the 
contact material. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. Stability studies 
have shown that neither the cartridge nor the elastomer used for both the plunger and the combiseal interacts

either physically or chemically with the product to alter the strength, quality or purity during the finished product 
shelf life. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for exenatide suspension is divided into 4 process stages: bulk microsphere 
manufacture, exenatide microsphere sieving and dispensing, exenatide suspension filled cartridge manufacture, 
and exenatide suspension pen final assembly. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing 
process. 
The bulk exenatide microsphere manufacturing process is the same as that used for the already authorised 
products, except that the bulk microsphere batches may be dispensed into smaller batches after sieving. 
The  process  stages  which  include  aseptic  processing  have  been  validated  on  three  batches  and  process 
validation  details  were  presented  for  bulk  microsphere  manufacture,  exenatide  microsphere  sieving  and 
dispensing, exenatide suspension filled cartridge manufacture, and exenatide suspension final assembly. The 
pen assembly process does not involve any aseptic processing. Process validation will be completed prior to 
product launch. This was considered acceptable. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls 
are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

There  has  been  no  significant  change  in  any  of  the  attributes  evaluated  under  long  term  and  accelerated 
conditions. 
ICH Q1B photostability studies have been carried out to assess the sensitivity of the exenatide suspension to 
light. Results confirm that the secondary packaging offers adequate protection from light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and stored in a refrigerator (2ºC - 8ºC) in 
the original package to protect from light, the pens may be kept for up to 4 weeks below 30ºC prior to use as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
This application is a line extension to Bydureon powder and solvent for prolonged release suspension. The 
applied product Bydureon prolonged-release suspension for injection in prefilled pen is presented as a single 
use, fixed dose prefilled pen for subcutaneous injection of 2 mg of exenatide, once weekly. The finished product 
is an oily suspension of exenatide controlled release microspheres in medium chain triglycerides (MCT). The 
microspheres are identical to the microspheres of the already approved products. The pen is designed to simplify 
and improve the quality of the patient injection experience versus the existing Bydureon delivery configurations. 
The ergonomically designed pen utilises a new suspension formulation that eliminates the re-constitution step 
and enables mixing of the microspheres in up to 15 seconds.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of finished product has been presented in a satisfactory 
manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product. However, no design space 
was claimed. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new pharmacology studies have been submitted in this application. This is acceptable since EQWS (exenatide 
once-weekly suspension) uses the same active ingredient as Bydureon and Byetta. The new product, EQWS, 
contains the same drug substance - exenatide, drug load (5% by weight), and extended-release microspheres 
as Bydureon (an aqueous formulation), but with a non-aqueous medium chain triglyceride (MCT) vehicle for use 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 14/68 
 
  
  
with an autoinjector. The pharmacological profile of exenatide when administered as EQWS is not expected to be 
significantly altered. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK parameters for exenatide from EQWS were determined in both the rat and monkey and showed that 
exenatide is absorbed over an extended period of time following a SC injection in a similar way as Bydureon 
(exenatide QW). With the exception of the initial release of exenatide in the first few days following injection. In 
rats, the exposure to exenatide was lower in the initial period following EQWS administration as compared to 
that seen with Bydureon (exenatide QW). This difference in the PK profile in rats is not expected to alter the long 
term pharmacodynamic (PD) or toxicity profiles of exenatide. In monkeys, systemic exposure following single 
and repeated doses of EQWS was slightly lower than that seen in previous studies conducted with Bydureon 
(exenatide QW), however at week 13, AUCs were comparable between the two formulations. 
Antibodies to exenatide developed over time in rats and monkeys with EQWS and impacted the measured 
plasma exenatide concentrations in a similar way as seen with both exenatide immediate release and Bydureon 
(exenatide QW). 
Distribution, metabolism, and elimination studies were not conducted for EQWS which is acceptable since these 
parameters already have been evaluated for exenatide (Byetta).  
EQWS uses a non-aqueous MCT vehicle as compared to the aqueous formulation used in Bydueron (exenatide 
QW). MCTs are found in many foods, such as dairy products, coconut and palm oils and are considered GRAS. As  
there is limited data available regarding the oral bioavailability of MCTs and PK profile following subcutaneous 
administration, a single dose (oral and SC) study was conducted in rats. This study showed that the PK profile 
following oral and SC administration of MCTs were comparable, with SC and oral dosing showing comparable 
absorption and elimination phases. This suggests that the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
profiles of MCTs are comparable following SC and oral dosing. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A complete nonclinical safety program evaluated the safety profile of Byetta in single and repeated dose 
toxicology, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, developmental and reproductive toxicology, and special toxicology 
studies. For Bydureon, nonclinical safety studies including repeated dose toxicology studies in rats and 
monkeys, in vitro genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, embryo-foetal development and juvenile toxicology studies in 
rats as well as special toxicology studies were conducted to ascertain that the profile of exposure to exenatide 
and the established safety profile of Byetta was unaffected by the change in formulation (addition of 
polylactide-co-glycolide- (PLG-) microspheres).  
The only toxicity previously reported for exenatide QW (Bydureon) were injection site reactions which showed 
partial or complete recovery. Injection site reactions have also been observed in the clinical program. No target 
organ or dose-limiting toxicity was observed in any of the toxicity studies. NOAEL values were in all cases set to 
the highest dose tested. Anti-exenatide antibodies were observed in all studies. While there were no 
toxicological consequences of antibody formation, antibody formation resulted in changes in exenatide 
exposure. In rats, exenatide antibodies developed in 23-46% of the animals, and presence of antibodies was 
associated with an increased exenatide exposure. In monkeys, exenatide antibodies developed in 58-75% of the 
animals. At low titers, exenatide exposure was increased, while at high titers exposure was decreased. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 15/68 
 
  
  
Additional nonclinical safety studies with EQWS were conducted to demonstrate that the safety profile of 
exenatide QW was unaffected by the addition of MCTs in the formulation. These included additional studies in 
rats (single dose PK and local tolerance) and monkeys (1- and 3-month repeat dose toxicity studies). As for 
exenatide QW (Bydureon) the only toxicological findings were injection site reactions and data obtained suggest 
that the granulomatous inflammation seen in the injection site was primarily a response to the presence of the 
microspheres, although an increased incidence of lymphocytic infiltration was indicated in EQWS-treated 
animals. No new toxicological findings were thus seen in the studies performed with EQWS. 
MCT is considered a novel excipient when employed for chronic use via subcutaneous injection and in order to 
evaluate the safety of MCT an single dose PK study with MCTs only in rats was conducted to bridge the available 
toxicity data following oral administration of MCTs and results obtained support the conclusion that data 
obtained after oral administration also are relevant for evaluation of safety after subcutaneous administration. 
A 4 week repeat dose oral toxicity study with MCT was also performed as part of this submission and a 
non-clinical overview regarding MCTs covering Single and Repeat dose toxicity, Genotoxicity, Carcinogenicity, 
Reproductive and Developmental toxicity, Local irritation and Immunotoxicity has also been provided. No safety 
concerns were identified. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment has been performed. This is acceptable and in line with the CHMP guideline 
which states that peptides are exempted from such assessment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological profile of exenatide when administered as EQWS is not expected to be significantly altered. 
Exenatide EQWS is absorbed over an extended period of time following a SC injection in rat and monkey in a 
similar way as Bydureon (exenatide QW), except for an initial decrease in the initial release of exenatide in the 
first few days following injection. The exposure was also found to be slightly lower in both species. However, 
these differences are not expected to alter the long term pharmacodynamic (PD) or toxicity profiles of 
exenatide. As for exenatide QW (Bydureon) the only toxicological findings seen were injection site reactions and 
data obtained suggest that the granulomatous inflammation seen in the injection site was primarily a response 
to the presence of the microspheres. No new toxicological findings were thus seen in the studies performed with 
EQWS. 
MCT are considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS) but is also considered to be a novel excipient when 
employed for chronic use via subcutaneous injection. In order to evaluate the safety of MCT the applicant have 
provided results from two own studies and a literature based non-clinical overview regarding MCTs covering 
Single and Repeat dose toxicity, Genotoxicity, Carcinogenicity, Reproductive and Developmental toxicity, Local 
irritation and Immunotoxicity. No safety concerns were identified. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections for an approval of Bydureon EQWS from a non-clinical point of view.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalysis 
A bioanalytical assay for determination of exenatide in plasma has earlier been developed, validated and 
assessed in the submissions of Byetta (EMEA/H/C698) and Bydureon (EMEA/H/C/2020). The assay was then 
transferred to Tandem Pharmaceuticals CA, US, where it was revalidated before analysis of samples taken in the 
current program. 
Within study validations, including incurred sample reproducibility in the two phase 3 studies, were performed 
and met the EMA bioanalytical guideline criteria. 
An ELISA for determination of exenatide-antibodies has been developed, validated and assessed in the 
Bydureon submission (EMEA/H/C/2020). The assay was transferred to Covance Laboratories where it was 
revalidated before analysis of samples taken in the current program. 
Absorption 
No bioequivalence study has been performed which is acceptable as the commercial formulation was used in 
phase 3. A non-final autoinjector was used but the changes are not considered to affect the functionality or the 
user interface. 
Exposure in the target population 
Phase 2 (BCB110 [MB001-087]) 
An extemporaneous non-aqueous suspension was used for administration in both the single and the repeated 
dosing cohort. Commercially microspheres and MCT suspension vehicle were used but differed from the 
formulation used in phase 3 in terms of the injection volume, microsphere concentration and administration 
device (syringe and vial). 
Single dose 
A supra therapeutic sc single dose 10 mg, dose proportionality has been reported up to at least 10 mg sc (EPAR 
Bydureon), resulted in a prolonged release of exenatide. An initial increase in exposure was seen during the first 
week followed by a relatively constant plasma level for ca 4 weeks and then an increase reaching maximum 
plasma concentration after ca 7 weeks. No initial peak during the first day post injection was seen as for 
Bydureon aqueous formulation. 
Repeated dosing once weekly 
Steady state was reached after ca 8 weeks following once weekly sc injections of 2 mg. The average 
concentration at steady state (Css,ave) of ca 345 pg/ml is comparable to the average steady state concentration 
following injection of Bydureon 2 mg aqueous suspension to be reconstituted before injection (EMEA/H/C/2020). 
Phase 3 (BCB118 [MB001-003]) 
Commercial formulation with only minor improvements of the autoinjector post phase 3 was used. 
Steady state was reached after ca 10 weeks following once weekly sc administration of EQWS 2 mg in T2DM 
patients. The geometric mean (SE) trough Css,ave was calculated to 208(9) pg/ml. 
Subjects with renal impairment (RI) showed a higher Css,ave compared to subjects normal renal function. The 
geometric mean Css,ave was 172, 220 and 289 pg/ml in normal, mild and moderate renal function, respectively. 
Phase 3 (BCB120 [MB001-004]) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 18/68 
 
  
  
Sparse trough sampling following repeated sc injection of EQWS 2 mg once weekly in T2DM patients resulted in 
a geomean(SE) Css,ave 153(10) pg/ml. The estimated inter-individual variability in Css,ave was CV 85%. The 
commercial formulation, with only minor improvements of the autoinjector post phase-3 was used. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that exhibits many of the same glucoregulatory or glucose-lowering 
actions as the naturally-occurring incretin hormone, but is not substantially degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
(DPP-4), which efficiently degrades native GLP-1 in vivo. 
Primary pharmacology 
Exenatide has been shown to reduce fasting and postprandial plasma glucose concentrations in nonclinical 
studies and clinical studies through multiple mechanisms of action and independent of background 
antihyperglycaemic therapies. These mechanisms of exenatide action include: 
 
beta cell effects 
o  enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion  
o 
restoration of first phase insulin secretion 
o  enhanced insulin synthesis and processing and increased beta cell mass in animals, 
glucose-dependent suppression of inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion 
slowing the rate of gastric emptying, resulting in slowed absorption of meal-derived glucose  
enhanced splanchnic glucose uptake 
reduction of caloric intake by promoting satiety. 
 
 
 
Clinical studies using exenatide have demonstrated that enhancement of insulin secretion and suppression of 
glucagon secretion are evident during hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic conditions but not under hypoglycaemic 
conditions. Nonclinical and clinical studies also indicate that the effect of exenatide to slow gastric emptying, 
which in turn slows the rate of glucose entry into the circulation, is reversed during hypoglycaemia. These 
glucose-dependent actions of exenatide lead to improvements in glucose control while minimising the risk of 
hypoglycaemia. In addition, reductions in food intake have been well-documented in nonclinical studies and also 
reported in a study of healthy volunteers and patients which may partly explain observed reductions in body 
weight. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The potential for exenatide to affect the QT interval was studied in both nonclinical models, and in the Byetta and 
Bydureon clinical development programmes. Exenatide has not been associated with prolongation of the 
corrected QT interval at therapeutic or supratherapeutic concentrations in clinical studies. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
Given that exenatide is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, it is not expected to have metabolism-based 
interactions with concomitantly administered oral medications. However, because it slows gastric emptying, 
exenatide has the potential to alter the absorption of orally administered drugs. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 19/68 
 
  
  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
An exposure-response analysis including data for both prolonged release formulations of exenatide (aqueous 
and suspension formulations) was performed. The exposure-response analysis included assessments of the 
effect on HbA1c response relative to predicted exenatide Css,av. The final exenatide population PK model was 
used to predict exenatide Css,av corresponding to the different HbA1c measurements. 
The estimated EC50 of the exenatide systemic exposure-response relationship is 52.1 pg/mL when antibody to 
exenatide titres are <125 and 85.4 pg/mL when antibody titre levels are ≥125. These values are similar to the 
empirical estimates of minimal efficacious concentrations defined during the Byetta clinical pharmacology 
programme based on observations that subcutaneous infusions leading to exenatide Css,av greater than 50 
pg/mL were required to elicit a glucose-lowering response (Taylor et al 2005). Furthermore, these are very 
similar to the values of 58.2 and 90 pg/mL, previously reported for Bydureon. Most (99%) of the individual 
median predicted exenatide Css,av values for EQWS 2 mg exceeded the model predicted EC50, further confirming 
that EQWS 2 mg would result in a robust clinical response, as observed in studies BCB118 and BCB120. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The systemic exposure of exenatide following once sc weekly injection with non-aqueous suspension using 
autoinjector has been monitored in one phase-2 and two phase-3 studies. Sparse PK samples have been 
collected, mainly through samples, following repeated dosing. 
The formulation used in phase-3 was the commercial formulation with only minor improvements of the 
autoinjector after the phase-3 studies. No bioequivalence study has been performed which is deemed 
acceptable. 
Following 2 mg once weekly sc injections, the steady state concentration Css,ave was determined to ca 345 pg/ml, 
using the non-final formulation in phase-2. This is comparable to the steady state level reported for the 
approved Bydureon aqueous product (EPAR 2011) of ca 300 ng/ml. 
The concentration-time profile of exenatide following a sc injection with a non-aqueous suspension was 
characterized after a supra therapeutic dose, 10 mg, using a non-final formulation and device. Dose 
proportionality has been reported up to at least 10 mg sc (EPAR Bydureon). An initial increase in exposure was 
seen during the first week followed by a relatively constant plasma level for ca 4 weeks and then an increase 
reaching maximum plasma concentration after ca 7 weeks. No initial peak during the first day post injection was 
seen, in contrast to what is known for the Bydureon aqueous formulation. 
In the two phase-3 studies Css,av, after 2 mg once weekly sc, lower steady state levels were determined than in 
the phase 2 study. In study BCB118 and BCB120 the Css,av was calculated to 208 pg/ml and 153 pg/ml, 
respectively.  
Css,av of 169 and 151 pg/mL for Bydureon and EQWS, respectively, are reported, from the current popPK 
analysis, using expanded data sets including two further phase 3 studies with Bydureon (variation II-41 and 
II-45) and EQWS. The values reported for Bydureon (169 pg/mL) and EQWS (151 pg/mL) using the population 
PK analysis (including steady-state data from 3 EQWS clinical studies and 8 Bydureon clinical studies) are typical 
values for a subject having normal renal function, median ideal body weight, and no anti-exenatide antibody 
titer. For Bydureon, a Css,av of 300 pg/ml is currently reported in the SmPC section 5.2 while for EQWS, a  Css,av 
of 208 pg/ml in section 5.2 is proposed by the applicant. Question on if the appropriateness of the Css,av values 
in the SmPCs was asked in round 1. The applicant suggests to follow precedent from the previous SmPC to let 
a single study represent the Css,av for each of the products, Bydureon would be represented as 265 pg/mL from 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 20/68 
 
  
  
Study BCB108 and EQWS as 208 pg/mL from Study BCB118. For Bydureon, the Css,av of 300 pg/mL currently 
reported in the SmPC, Section 5.2, results from observations in the original clinical trial LAR-105 (DURATION-1) 
in which non-commercial drug product was used. The CHMP agreed that updating Bydureon Css,av in the SmPC 
section 5.2 is necessary since the previous value came from a study using non-commercial drug product. The 
discussion regarding the typical patient values in the popPK (i.e. normal renal function, body weight and no 
anti-exenatide antibody titer) is accepted. However it is not understood why only a single study should represent 
the Css,av if there are several equally relevant studies using the commercial formulation. In the 3 Phase 3 studies 
(BCB108, D5553C00002 [DURATION 7], and D5553C00003 [DURATION 8]) that evaluated the 
pharmacokinetics of exenatide administered as the commercial formulation of exenatide once weekly 
(BYDUREON), the geometric mean plasma concentration at steady state (Css,av) ranged from 151 to 265 
pg/mL. In the 2 studies (BCB118 and BCB120) that evaluated the pharmacokinetics of exenatide administered 
as the once weekly suspension formulation (BYDUREON BCise), the geometric mean Css,av values were 208 
pg/mL and 153 pg/mL, respectively. As requested by the Rapporteur, the proposed SmPC contains Css,av 
ranges for BYDUREON (single-dose tray and dual chamber pen) (151 to 265 pg/mL) and BYDUREON BCise (153 
to 208 pg/mL). 
Extrapolation of both efficacy and safety from Bydureon to EQWS, with regards to parts of the indication not 
covered by the clinical development program for EQWS, is acceptable since the observed Css,av values for 
exenatide in the EQWS Phase 3 studies are in a comparable range as that observed for Bydureon. In addition, 
ninety-nine percent of the individual median predicted exenatide Css,av values for EQWS exceeded the model 
predicted half maximal effective concentration (EC50) (52.1 pg/ml). Thus the Css, av values are similar enough 
and well above the model predicted half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 52.1 pg/ml and extrapolation 
of efficacy is appropriate. Since EQWS has a lower Css, av than Bydureon, extrapolation of safety is also accepted. 
The increase Css in patients with mild and moderate RI compared to in subjects with normal renal function is not 
unexpected for exenatide, a GLP-1 compound eliminated mainly via renal excretion. No dose adjustment is 
recommended patients with mild RI and Bydureon is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance <50 
ml/min. Based on individual subjects, the exposure in mild RI is about 2.5-fold higher than in patients with 
normal renal function. Comparable effect on HbA1c are reported in the two groups but a slightly higher 
frequency of GI adverse events are seen in the subjects with mild RI compared to patients with normal renal 
function. 
Exenatide is a synthetic peptide with partial sequence homology to the naturally occurring human glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1). No new data have been submitted with regards to the mechanism of action or the primary 
and secondary pharmacology of exenatide, but reference is given to data obtained with Byetta and Bydureon. 
This is acceptable. Adequate preclinical and clinical studies have been performed to investigate any potential of 
exenatide to prolong QT interval. All these studies have been negative. 
No new PD interactions are expected due to the new formulation. The known interactions are adequately 
reflected in the PI. 
Efficacy and safety data are available, from the BCB118, and BCB120 studies, to support the new formulation.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Systemic exposure of exenatide has been monitored following once weekly sc injection with EQWS.  
In the SmPCs, the exposure for the new EQWS formulation is reported to be lower than for Bydureon.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 21/68 
 
  
  
Extrapolation of both efficacy and safety from BYDUREON to EQWS, with regards to parts of the indication not 
covered by the clinical development program for EQWS  is accepted. The Css, av values are similar enough and 
well above the model predicted half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 52.1 pg/ml and thus 
extrapolation of efficacy is appropriate. Since EQWS has a lower Css, av than Bydureon, extrapolation of safety is 
also adequate.   
The CHMP agreed that updating Bydureon Css,av in the SmPC section 5.2 is necessary since the previous value 
came from a study using non-commercial drug product. The updated SmPC contains Css,av ranges for 
BYDUREON (single-dose tray and dual chamber pen) (151 to 265 pg/mL) and BYDUREON BCise (153 to 208 
pg/mL) which is satisfactory. 
The pharmacodynamics of EQWS has been adequately investigated and described. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The EQWS clinical development programme consists of one completed Phase 2 study (BCB110) and two 
completed Phase 3 studies (BCB118 and BCB120). 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Dose selection 
Both the EQWS and Bydureon formulations of exenatide employ the same polymeric microspheres containing 
5% exenatide and the 2 formulations differ only with regard to the vehicle. Data from study BCB110 provide 
support for the choice of dose. 
Study BCB110 was a Phase 2, 2-cohort, single- and repeat-dose study conducted to assess the 
pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability, and safety of EQWS administered as a single dose in Cohort 1 and QW over 
a 12-week assessment period in Cohort 2. In Cohort 1, healthy subjects received a single SC dose of 10 mg 
EQWS, and in Cohort 2, subjects with T2DM were randomised to receive 2 mg EQWS or placebo in a 2:1 ratio for 
12 weeks.  
Efficacy was only assessed in Cohort 2 which included male and nonpregnant female subjects with T2DM, aged 
19 to 75 years of age. At screening, subjects were required to have HbA1c of 7.1% to 10.0%, inclusive; body 
mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 to 45 kg/m2, and FPG <260 mg/dL (14.4 mmol/L). Subjects had to be treated 
with diet and exercise alone or with a stable regimen of metformin, a thiazolidinedione (TZD), or a combination 
of metformin and a TZD for a minimum of 2 months prior to screening to be eligible to participate. 
In Cohort 2, treatment with EQWS for 12 weeks resulted in significant reductions in mean HbA1c (-0.87%), 
fasting serum glucose (-1.8 mmol/L), and body weight (-1.41 kg). 
Pharmacokinetic data from Study BCB110 demonstrated that weekly administration of 2 mg EQWS achieved 
steady-state exenatide concentrations that were modestly higher compared to 2 mg   Bydureon, but well within 
the range of exenatide systemic exposures previously observed with 2 mg   Bydureon. Based on these results, 
which were confirmed by subsequent PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling and simulations, a 2 mg dose was 
selected as the EQWS dose for the Phase 3 studies. 
Main studies 
Both Phase 3 studies were randomised, open-label trials of efficacy, safety, and tolerability of EQWS in subjects 
with T2DM.

Study BCB118 
Study BCB118 was a Phase 3, randomised, open-label, long-term, multicentre, comparator-controlled, 2-arm 
study designed to compare the glycaemic effects, safety, and tolerability of EQWS to Byetta BID over 28 weeks. 
Subjects with T2DM were randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 3:2. Randomisation 
was stratified by diabetes management method at screening, screening glycated HbA1c stratum, and renal 
function. 
Following the 28-week primary assessment period, subjects began an open-ended extension period during 
which all participating subjects (n=309) were to receive 2 mg EQWS from Week 29 through Week 52.

Study BCB120 
Study BCB120 was a Phase 3, randomised, open-label (oral agents blinded), long-term, multicentre, 
comparator- and placebo-controlled, 3-group study designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
EQWS to sitagliptin and placebo, and characterise the PK of EQWS over 28 weeks. Subjects were randomly 
assigned across the 3 treatment groups in a ratio of 3:2:1, with randomisation stratified by screening HbA1c 
stratum.

Study participants  
Study BCB118 and Study BCB120 both included male and nonpregnant female subjects, at least 18 years of 
age with T2DM. Subjects were required to have HbA1c of 7.1% to 11.0%, inclusive; BMI ≤45 kg/m2, and FPG 
concentration <280 mg/dL (15.5 mmol/L). Subjects with any exposure to Byetta,   Bydureon, any GLP-1 
analogue, or any dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor within 3 months of screening were excluded, and subjects 
treated with insulin within 2 weeks prior to screening or for more than 1 week within 3 months of screening were 
excluded.  
In Study BCB118, subjects were required to be treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with a 
stable regimen of oral antidiabetes medication, and in Study BCB120, subjects were required to be treated with 
a stable regimen of ≥ 1500 mg/day metformin for a minimum of 2 months before screening. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Phase 3 Studies BCB118 and BCB120 was the change in HbA1c from baseline 
to Week 28. 
Secondary endpoints were the following: 
 
Proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c target value of <7% at Week 28 
  Change in FPG concentrations from baseline to Week 28 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 24/68 
 
  
  
 
  Change in body weight from baseline to Week 28 
  Change in 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose concentrations from baseline to Week 16 for subjects in 
the meal test cohort. 
Statistical methods 
In both Phase 3 studies, the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 28 was compared between the EQWS group 
and the comparator group(s) using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) in the mITT 
population (observed data) as the primary analysis. No imputation of missing data was performed. 
For the analysis of secondary endpoints, namely FPG and weight, the same model as for primary endpoint was 
used. For analysis of portion of subjects <7% at Week 28, a Cochran- Mantel-Haenszel test was used. A 
generalised linear model was used for analysis of PPG. 
Multiplicity adjustment procedures were used to protect family-wise error rate for the primary endpoint and 
secondary endpoints. 
The data from the open-label extension in Study BCB118 were analysed descriptively using MMRM. 
Results  
Overall, 742 subjects were randomised to the 2 Phase 3 studies. The proportion of subjects completing each 
study was similar.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable: Change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 28 
In both Phase 3 studies, EQWS demonstrated a significantly larger reduction in HbA1c than the comparators as 
summarised in Table 5.

Secondary efficacy variables 
For the analysis of secondary endpoints in BCB120, the placebo group was not included in the hierarchical 
testing strategy. 
 
Proportion of subjects with HbA1c <7% at Week 28 
In both Phase 3 studies, a greater proportion of subjects achieved HbA1c of <7% at Week 28 in the EQWS group 
than in the active comparator groups (Table 6). In both studies, consistent results, with smaller differences 
between the treatment groups, were observed in a conservative supportive analysis, where subjects with 
missing values at Week 28 due to early termination or rescue therapy were treated as non-responders.

Table 6 Proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7% at Week 28 in the Phase 3 studies (mITT 
Population) 
  Change in fasting plasma glucose concentration from baseline to Week 28 
FPG decreased from baseline to Week 28 in all treatment groups, except the placebo group in Study BCB120, 
where it increased. The reduction in FPG from baseline to Week 28 was numerically greater in the EQWS group 
than in the active comparator groups in both Phase 3 studies (adjusted p=0.1668 vs Byetta BID in BCB118 and 
nominal p=0.0931 vs sitagliptin in BCB120). Greater reductions in FPG were observed with EQWS than placebo 
in BCB120 (nominal p=0.0002). 
  Change in body weight from baseline to Week 28 
Body weight decreased from baseline to Week 28 in all treatment groups, except the placebo group in Study 
BCB120, where it increased slightly. Reductions in body weight were smaller in the EQWS group than with 
Byetta BID in BCB118 and with sitagliptin in BCB120. The differences between groups were not statistically 
significant in either study (nominal p=0.3744 vs Byetta BID in BCB118 and nominal p=0.8625 vs sitagliptin in 
BCB120). There was a greater reduction in body weight in the EQWS group compared to the placebo group in 
Study BCB120 (nominal p= 0.0198). 
  Change in 2-hour PPG from baseline to Week 16 
2-hour PPG decreased from baseline to Week 16 in all treatment groups. In Study BCB118, the reduction in 
2-hour PPG was greater in the Byetta BID group than in the EQWS group; statistical testing was not performed 
due to the hierarchical closed testing procedure (nominal p-value=0.0999). In Study BCB120, the reduction in 
2-hour PPG was greater in the EQWS group compared with the sitagliptin group; statistical testing was not 
performed due to the hierarchical closed testing procedure (nominal p=0.0248). The reduction was also 
numerically greater in the EQWS group compared with the placebo group (nominal p=0.288).

Long-term effect 
Study BCB118 included a long-term extension treatment period after the end of the 28-week treatment period 
through Week 52 during which all subjects received EQWS. The primary purpose of the long-term extension 
treatment period was to assess the long-term safety of EQWS; exploratory efficacy analyses were also 
performed during the long-term extension treatment period to assess the long-term durability of treatment 
effects.  
Change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 
Reductions in HbA1c were observed through 52 weeks of treatment in both treatment groups. Although both 
groups received EQWS after Week 28, the pattern of HbA1c change over time differed during the long-term 
extension period between subjects previously randomised to EQWS and those previously randomised to Byetta 
BID, as shown in Figure 5. The LS mean change (SE) from baseline at Week 52 was -1.00% (0.11%) for subjects 
previously randomised to the EQWS and -0.99% (0.13%) for those previously randomised to Byetta BID. 
Figure 5 Plot of LS mean (SE) change from baseline to Week 52 in HbA1c in Phase 3 Study BCB118 
(All mITT Subjects) 
Change from baseline in FPG concentrations at Week 52 
FPG reductions were observed through 52 weeks of treatment in both groups. At Week 52, the mean change in 
FPG from baseline was similar in subjects previously randomised to EQWS and those previously randomised to 
Byetta BID, with LS mean (SE) changes of -26 (4) mg/dL and -31 (5) mg/dL, respectively, and an LS mean (SE) 
difference between the groups of 5 (6). 
Similar to the pattern of change observed in HbA1c over time, FPG gradually increased in subjects who received 
EQWS throughout the duration of the study, from a nadir achieved at Week 12 through Week 32, at which point 
FPG reached a plateau. FPG increased from Week 28 to Week 32 in subjects previously randomised to Byetta 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 34/68 
 
  
  
 
BID who were switched to EQWS after completion of the controlled-treatment period. In this group, FPG 
progressively decreased after Week 32 over the remaining weeks of the study. 
Proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c target value of <7% at Week 52 and up to Study Termination 
Increased proportions of subjects achieving HbA1c values of <7% compared to baseline were observed at Week 
52 in both treatment groups. At Week 52, the proportions of subjects who achieved an HbA1c of <7% were 
similar for subjects previously randomised to EQWS and those previously randomised to Byetta BID (38.4% of 
subjects in each group). 
Change in body weight in long-term treatment 
Body weight reductions were observed in both treatment groups through Week 52. Body weight appeared to 
stabilise at approximately Week 16 in subjects who received EQWS throughout the duration of the study while 
body weight decreased modestly throughout the study in subjects previously randomised to Byetta BID (Figure 
6). At Week 52, the LS mean (SE) difference between the groups was 0.9 (0.5) kg.

Ancillary analyses 
Comparison of results in sub-populations 
Summary statistics for change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 28 were generated for subgroups defined by 
gender (male, female), age (<65 years or ≥65 years), and race, and for randomisation strata defined by 
baseline HbA1c strata (<9.0% or ≥9.0%), diabetes management method at screening (diet/exercise alone, SU 
use, or non-SU use; for BCB118 only) and renal function status (normal, mild renal impairment, or moderate 
renal impairment; for BCB118 only) for the mITT population. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 35/68 
 
  
  
 
Patients who were on diet and exercise at baseline had greater HbA1c reductions at Week 28 in both the EQWS 
(n=27; -1.73%) and Byetta BID (n=13; -1.38%) groups when compared to the entire study population. 
Consistent with the entire study population, these reductions were greater for EQWS than Byetta BID.  
Larger decreases in HbA1c were achieved in the subgroup of subjects with screening HbA1c ≥9% across 
treatments in both studies. Otherwise, no interaction by subgroup was observed. 
Effect of antibodies to exenatide on efficacy 
Amongst EQWS-treated patients evaluable for antibodies at week 28 (n=309), approximately 43.4% of patients 
had low titre antibodies to exenatide and approximately 13.9% of patients had high titre antibodies. 
For Study BCB118, in the EQWS group, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) change from baseline to Week 28 
in HbA1c was -1.39% (1.11%) in subjects negative for antibodies (n=101), -1.48% (1.25%) for those with low 
antibody titres (n=94), and -0.74% (1.33%) in subjects with high antibody titres (n=31). 
For Study BCB120, in the EQWS group, the mean (SD) change from baseline to Week 28 in HbA1c was -1.05% 
(1.15%) in subjects negative for antibodies (n=61), -1.14% (1.30%) for those with low antibody titres (n=79), 
and -0.58% (1.28%) in subjects with high antibody titres (n=26).

Of the 410 EQWS-treated subjects in the Phase 3, controlled study periods, 336, 64, 10 and 0 subjects were 
aged <65, 65 to 74, 75 to 84 and ≥85 years, respectively. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
EQWS is a modified formulation of Bydureon that contains the same drug substance, drug load (5% by mass), 
and prolonged-release microspheres as Bydureon, but with a nonaqueous MCT vehicle. No changes were made 
to the microsphere formulation or the manufacturing process. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study program includes one Phase 2 study and two Phase 3 studies. Both Phase 3 studies measured the 
primary endpoint at week 28, and one of the studies includes a 24 week extension during which all patients were 
treated with EQWS. 
The primary objective of the Phase 2 study BCB110 was to investigate PK for the new formulation and to gather 
safety and efficacy data in support of the selected dose of 2 mg EQWS, i.e. the same dose as in the aqueous 
formulation. PK data was evaluated for both cohorts whereas efficacy data was only evaluated in Cohort 2 which 
included patients with T2DM. The inclusion criteria were set to enrol patients largely representative for the 
target population. Improvements in HbA1c and FPG as well as a decrease in body weight were observed after 12 
weeks of treatment. The choice of dose was mainly based on the PK and PK/PD modelling data which bridged to 
data for the already approved exenatide formulation. The efficacy data provide support that the 2 mg dose is 
effective. 
Both Phase 3 studies (BCB118 and BCB120) were randomised, open-label trials of efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of EQWS in subjects with T2DM. The open-label design is acceptable considering that double-dummy 
injection treatment otherwise have had to be used. In BCB118 EQWS was compared to Byetta BID and in study 
BCB120, which was a three-armed study, EQWS was compared to both sitagliptin and placebo. Oral treatment 
was blinded. Both studies measured the primary endpoint at 28 weeks which is adequate, and the extension 
period in study BCB118 (where all patients received EQWS) provides information both on the switch from Byetta 
BID to EQWS as well as long-term data (52 weeks). None of the studies had a run-in period which is acceptable 
since no changes were made to the background medication. In study BCB120, patients were required to be on 
stable metformin treatment before screening. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were generally acceptable in both studies. In the scientific advice, concerns 
were raised regarding the inclusion of patients on diet and exercise alone in study BCB118, as this is not in 
accordance with EU label. Therefore data from this subgroup is only to be considered supportive. 
Both studies included criteria for loss of glucose control, in which case rescue therapy should be initiated. The 
rescue therapy should be chosen in accordance with local prescribing information and the subject was allowed 
to continue study participation. 
The endpoints chosen were adequate and relevant. PROs were included among tertiary endpoints. The decision 
not to pool efficacy data is endorsed considering the difference in comparators. 
The sample size calculations were adequate. In study BCB118, a non-inferiority margin of 0.4% was applied 
which may be acceptable for planning purposes but is considered too wide when assessing the outcome. 
In both studies, more patients were randomised to EQWS than to comparators. Stratification for previous 
treatment, glycaemic control and renal function was done in study BCB118, whereas patients were only 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 40/68 
 
  
  
stratified by glycaemic control in study BCB120. This is acceptable, taking into account the low number of 
patients included in the placebo group in study BCB120. 
In the primary analysis model, a mixed model repeated measures model, no explicit imputation of missing 
assessments is performed. Considering that missing at random (MAR) seldom is a plausible assumption the 
planned sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the primary analysis to departures from the MAR 
assumption is generally needed. Generally, the preferred analysis is one with which a continued treatment 
benefit after study treatment discontinuation is avoided. Given the model used, of importance for the credibility 
of the estimated primary outcome is to what extent subjects stayed in a study and contributed with data.  Data 
after receiving rescue medication are censored and not used in the analysis. 
To understand the robustness of the results further data was requested. In study BCB118, only small differences 
in missing data was observed between treatment groups (24% and 27% for EQWS and Byetta BID, 
respectively). In study BCB120, the proportion of patients with missing data was considerably higher in the 
placebo treated group (38%) compared to the groups treated with EQWS (22%) or sitagliptin (20%). This is 
consistent with a higher drop-out rate in the placebo treated group compared to the groups on active treatment. 
A sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint based on all randomised patients using a conservative imputation 
approach in case data is missing (e.g. ANCOVA with BOCF) was performed. Also with this conservative analysis 
EQWS was found superior to Byetta BID and placebo, whereas the treatment difference to sitagliptin was 
attenuated and did not reach statistical significance. The additional analysis provides further support with 
regards to the robustness of the results. 
The use of hierarchical testing procedure to control the type I-error is endorsed. 
With regards to the conduct of the studies, protocol amendments were made in both studies. The amendments 
made are not considered to affect the outcome of the studies or the interpretation of the data. 
Protocol deviations were noted for 36% (BCB118) and 43 % (BCB120) of subjects; the majority of these were 
classified as “other” (≈30%). Violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria was rather uncommon. Notably two 
subjects were enrolled twice at different sites in study BCB118. The data from these subjects were treated as if 
four subjects were enrolled. The Applicant has re-run the analysis excluding the data from the two subjects. The 
results from the new analysis did not differ from the primary analysis. In study BCB120, one subject was 
enrolled twice at different sites. The data from this subject was excluded from the last randomisation. Notably, 
the double enrolment was discovered within a few months for two of the subjects which provide reassurance 
that the monitoring of the study was adequate. Thus no concerns with regards to the conduct of the study are 
raised. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, 742 subjects were randomised to the 2 Phase 3 studies. The completion rate at 28 weeks was 
comparable for EQWS in both studies (86% and 85%). The highest completion rate was observed in the 
sitagliptin treated group (89%) and the lowest in the Byetta BID (80%) and placebo treated groups (77%). 
“Withdrawal by subject” and “Lost to follow up” were the most common reasons for withdrawal in all treatment 
groups, these withdrawals were evenly distributed across the treatments. Few patients withdrew due to adverse 
events, the highest proportion was observed in the Byetta BID treated group (5.4%). 
The proportion of patients completing the 52 extension was highest in the EQWS treated group, mainly due to 
a higher withdrawal rate in the Byetta BID treated groups before week 28.

Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between treatment groups and comparable 
between the two studies. In study BCB118, subjects were slightly older and more overweight than in study 
BCB120. The background treatment differed in line with the differences in inclusion criteria. Notably, in study 
BCB118, about 12% of patients were on diet and exercise treatment alone.  In study BCB120, all patients were 
on background metformin treatment; whereas about 80% of subjects in study BCB118 were using metformin 
either as monotherapy or in combination with other OADs. 
Patients on EQWS therapy showed a medical history and concomitant medications at baseline as expected in this 
population. About 47% of EQWS patients had at least 1 concomitant medication added during the 28 weeks of 
the study. In the extension period, 17% of patients had at least 1 concomitant medication added used in 
diabetes. In Study BCB118, 13 (5.7%) patients on EQWS and 15 (10.1%) patients on BYETTA received rescue 
therapy. In Study BCB120, 6 (3.3%) patients on EQWS, 9 (7.4%) patients on sitagliptin, and 9 (14.8%) patients 
on placebo received rescue therapy. Thus the need for rescue was lowest in the EQWS treated group in both 
studies. 
The mITT includes all patients except for 3 patients in total. The proportion of patients excluded from the 
evaluable meal test set was generally higher but mostly balanced between groups. 
The primary endpoint was met in both studies, where EQWS showed a significantly larger reduction of HbA1c 
from baseline vs Byetta BID (treatment difference -0.4%; study BCB118) and vs sitagliptin (treatment 
difference -0.4%) and placebo (treatment difference -0.7%; study BCB120).  
The primary endpoint was calculated excluding patients on rescue therapy or terminated early. The proportion 
of patients included in the analysis was balanced between groups (BCB118: 77% on EQWS vs 74% on Byetta 
BID; study BCB120: 78% on EQWS vs 80% on sitagliptin). The only exception is the placebo group where only 
62% of patients were included in the analysis. 
The outcome is largely in line with the outcome observed in comparable studies with the aqueous solution of 
prolonged-release exenatide. 
In both studies, a numerically higher proportion of patients achieved the treatment goal of HbA1c <7% in the 
EQWS treated groups compared (49% and 43%, BCB118 and BCB120, respectively) to Byetta BID (43%) or 
sitagliptin (32%). The difference compared to sitagliptin reached statistical significance. The conservative 
sensitivity analysis showed a similar pattern although no significant differences were observed. 
In both studies, a numerically larger reduction in FPG was observed in the EQWS treated groups compared to 
Byetta BID, sitagliptin or placebo. Statistical significance was only reached when compared to placebo. 
The largest reduction in body weight was observed with Byetta BID (-1.9 kg), although not significantly different 
from EQWS (-1.5 kg; study BCB118). In study BCB120, the weight reduction with EQWS (-1.1 kg) was 
comparable to that observed with sitagliptin (-1.2 kg) but significantly larger than with placebo (+0.2 kg). 
Change in 2-hour PPG was evaluated in a subset of patients after a meal test. The numerically largest effect was 
observed with Byetta BID (-6.31 mmol/L), although the difference compared to EQWS (-4.83 mmol/L) was not 
statistically significant (study BCB118). In study BCB120, the decrease in 2-hour PPG was significantly larger 
with EQWS compared to sitagliptin but only numerically larger than placebo. 
Data from the long-term extension show that HbA1c increased from week 20 and onwards in the group treated 
with EQWS and appeared to reach a plateau after week 44. Patients switching from Byetta BID to EQWS showed 
a decrease in HbA1c after the switch and at week 52 both treatment arm showed no difference in change from 
baseline in HbA1c. The FPG showed a similar development as HbA1c, with some increase in the EQWS group 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 42/68 
 
  
  
which appeared to plateau. A further decrease in FPG was observed in patients switching from Byetta BID to 
EQWS and no difference was observed between treatment groups at week 52. The proportion of patients 
achieving HbA1c <7% decreased over time to 38.4% at week 52 compared to 49.3% at week 28. Body weight 
remained essentially stable after week 20 in both treatment groups. The larger reduction in body weight 
observed in patients who started on Byetta BID was maintained throughout the study period. 
Subgroup analysis did not reveal any difference in the effect of EQWS on HbA1c reduction in the adequately 
sized subgroups. Very few patients above the age of 75 years (10 patients) and only 44 patients with 
moderate/severe renal impairment were included in the studies. As expected, larger decreases in HbA1c was 
observed in patients with higher HbA1c at baseline. This was observed in all treatment groups. There was no 
apparent difference in HbA1c reduction between subgroups with normal or impaired renal function. The data for 
the subgroup only treated with diet and exercise at baseline showed that the mean HbA1c at baseline was 
slightly lower in this subgroup compared to the mean HbA1c for the total study population. The mean change in 
HbA1c was also more pronounced in this subgroup, for both treatments, compared to the total study population. 
The change from baseline in HbA1c was greater with EQWS than with Byetta BID, consistent with the primary 
outcome. The number of patients per treatment group was however small and the results should be interpreted 
with caution. 
Almost 60% of patients had positive antibody titres at week 28. In both studies, the effect on HbA1c was 
comparable in antibody-negative patients and patients with low antibody titers, whereas an attenuated but still 
clinically relevant response was observed in patients with high antibody titers. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of the new exenatide formulation EQWS has been evaluated in an adequately designed clinical study 
program, which includes two active comparators (Byetta BID and sitagliptin) as well as placebo. EQWS was 
found superior to all comparators with regards to the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HbA1c. The 
outcome of the secondary endpoints was generally supporting the primary outcome, although statistical 
significance was not always reached. The outcome is in line with previous observations for the aqueous 
prolonged-release formulation of exenatide. 
The efficacy of EQWS has been adequately shown 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Exenatide once-weekly suspension (EQWS) is a subcutaneously injectable prolonged-release non-aqueous 
suspension formulation that was developed as extension to Byetta (exenatide twice daily, approved in 2006) 
and Bydureon (exenatide once weekly aqueous suspension, approved in 2011) for the treatment of patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  
Safety assessments were based on medical review of AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs measurements, 
and physical examinations in the 3 clinical studies in the EQWS development programme. 
All of the safety analyses were performed using data from the Safety Population, which included all subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of any randomised study medication. Safety data for the 2 Phase 3 studies (BCB118 and 
BCB 120) were pooled and summarised. The results of the 28-week controlled periods in the Phase 3 studies 
constitute the primary safety and tolerability data, with supplemental information provided from the 
uncontrolled extension period of Study BCB118 and the Phase 2 Study BCB110.

Patient exposure 
The 3 EQWS clinical studies enrolled a total of 804 subjects. EQWS was administered to a total of 579 unique 
subjects in these clinical studies (Table 9). 
Table 9 Clinical studies and number of subjects by treatment in the EQWS clinical programme 
Adverse events 
Overall summary of adverse events 
In Phase 2 Study BCB110, there were no AEs resulting in discontinuation of study treatment or deaths. One 
subject in Cohort 2 experienced 2 SAEs during placebo treatment. In Cohort 1, 26 of 30 subjects (86.7%) 
experienced at least 1 AE and the corresponding values for Cohort 2 were 22 of 23 subjects (95.7%) in the 
EQWS group and 9 of 12 subjects (75.0%) in the placebo group. 
The adverse events for the Phase 3 studies are summarised in Table 10.

CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018

Common adverse events 
Phase 3 controlled period 
The most commonly reported AEs (≥5% of subjects) reported in the 410 Phase 3, EQWS-treated subjects during 
the controlled study periods were under the SOCs Gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, 9.3%), General disorders 
and administration site conditions (injection site nodule, 12.2%), and Nervous system disorders (headache, 
5.1%). Other AEs reported in ≥2% of subjects were diarrhoea (4.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.1%), 
injection site pruritus (3.7%), vomiting (3.4%), dizziness (2.9%), injection site bruising (2.9%) and erythema 
(2.7%), constipation (2.4%), injection site pain (2.4%), pain in extremity (2.4%), back pain (2.0%), 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (2.0%), injection site induration (2.0%), and urinary tract infection (2.0%) 
(Table 11). 
As shown in Table 11, gastrointestinal AEs, particularly nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, were less frequent in 
subjects in the EQWS treatment group compared with those in the Byetta group in study BCB118. Conversely, 
injection site reactions were more frequent amongst EQWS-treated subjects compared with those on Byetta 
treatment. 
Table 11 Adverse events reported in ≥2% of all EQWS subjects by system organ class and preferred 
term - Phase 3 controlled 
Phase 3 uncontrolled extension period 
In the Phase 3, uncontrolled extension period, AEs reported in ≥2% of all EQWS-treated subjects were 
nasopharyngitis (3.2%) and influenza (2.3%). The overall AE profile for subjects who switched from Byetta to 
EQWS was similar to that for subjects who were treated with EQWS throughout both periods of Study BCB118. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 45/68 
 
  
  
 
The only notable difference in terms of a possible increase in AEs when switching between the 2 formulations of 
exenatide was for the SOC General disorders and administration site conditions (EQWS to EQWS, 1.6%; Byetta 
to EQWS, 15.5%), which was mostly attributable to higher incidence rates of injection site AEs in subjects who 
switched from Byetta to EQWS. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Gastrointestinal events 
Gastrointestinal AEs, especially nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting, were among the most commonly reported AEs 
for EQWS-treated subjects; however, the incidence rates for these events were lower compared with 
Byetta-treated subjects (Figure 7). During the controlled period of study BCB118, nausea was reported in 9.6% 
of EQWS subjects and 20.5% of Byetta subjects. EQWS appears to have a lower propensity to cause nausea and 
vomiting than Byetta, particularly upon initiation of treatment, possibly due to a more gradual increase in 
plasma exenatide levels with EQWS administration relative to Byetta. 
In the controlled periods of the Phase 3 studies, the overall incidence of AEs in the SOC Gastrointestinal 
disorders was 20.5% in the EQWS-treated subjects and the most common events (>1% of subjects) were 
nausea (9.3%), diarrhoea (4.1%), vomiting (3.4%), constipation (2.4%), abdominal distension (1.7%), and 
dyspepsia (1.7%). 
Figure 7 Incidence (%) of nausea and/or vomiting over time (days) in the EQWS and Byetta 
treatment groups during the controlled period of Study BCB118 
Pancreatitis 
Two cases of pancreatitis were reported in EQWS-treated subjects during the Phase 3 studies that were 
confirmed by an adjudication committee; both cases were SAEs and considered related to study treatment by 
the investigator.  
Hypoglycaemia 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 46/68 
 
  
  
 
One subject in the Byetta group had an event of major hypoglycaemia in Study BCB118. This subject, who 
received background treatment with a sulphonylurea and was randomized to Byetta, had a hypoglycaemia event 
and experienced unconsciousness and required assistance. The subject received oral glucose, and recovered 
from the event. There was no associated blood glucose value.  
The overall incidence of minor hypoglycaemia in the 410 EQWS-treated subjects during the controlled period of 
the Phase 3 studies was low (6.3%). As expected, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was greater in EQWS subjects 
who were on an SU at baseline (26.1%) than in EQWS subjects who were not taking an SU at baseline (0.9%); 
appropriate warning has been incorporated into the product label. The incidence was also low in EQWS subjects 
who were taking metformin only at baseline (0.4%).  
Injection site adverse events 
Injection site AEs were reported in 23.9% of the 410 EQWS-treated subjects during the Phase 3, controlled 
study period. The most common injection site events were injection site nodule (12.2%), injection site pruritus 
(3.7%), injection site bruising (2.9%), injection site erythema (2.7%), injection site pain (2.4%), and injection 
site induration (2.0%). In the controlled period of study BCB118, injection site nodule AEs were reported in 
15.7% of the 229 subjects in the EQWS treatment group versus in 0.7% of subjects in the Byetta group. 
Almost all of the injection site AEs that were reported in the EQWS-treated subjects in the Phase 3, controlled 
study period were mild or moderate in intensity. The only reported severe injection site AE was a case of 
injection site urticaria in 1 subject. There were no injection site AEs reported as serious during the Phase 3 
controlled period or the uncontrolled extension period. 
The incidence of injection site AEs in the EQWS-treated subjects declined markedly after the first 3 months of 
treatment in the Phase 3, controlled study period. Similarly, the numbers of subjects reporting injection site AEs 
were low during the Phase 3, uncontrolled, extension period. 
These observations are suggestive of a localised reaction consistent with the known properties of the polymer 
microsphere formulation utilised in both EQWS and Bydureon. 
Cardiac disorders 
For all Phase 3 EQWS-treated subjects, the exposure-adjusted incidence and event rates (95% CI) were 
calculated as 45.7 (26.1, 70.6) per 1000 patient-years and 53.5 (32.2, 80.1) per 1000 patient-years, 
respectively. 
Among all of the Phase 3 EQWS-treated subjects, there were 2 cases of adjudication-committee confirmed 
myocardial infarction, 1 each in the controlled and extension study periods; the exposure-adjusted incidence 
rate (95% CI) for myocardial infarction was calculated as 2.82 (0.07, 10.4) per 1000 patient-years). A case of 
myocardial infarction was also reported in a subject in the placebo group of study BCB120. The 
exposure-adjusted subject incidence rate (95% CI) for myocardial infarction amongst EQWS and placebo 
subjects was 5.65 (0.07, 15.7) and 36.34 (0.92, 134.0) per 1000 patient-years, respectively. 
Neoplasms 
In the controlled period of the Phase 3 studies, 3 neoplasms were reported in EQWS-treated subjects that were 
confirmed by the adjudication committee: 1 case each of breast cancer, fibroadenoma of breast, and benign 
neoplasm of skin. Another 3 confirmed neoplasms were reported during the Phase 3 extension period: 1 case 
each of malignant melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. A case of acute myeloid 
leukaemia was reported during the follow-up period of study BCB118, 10 days after the last dose of EQWS. None 
of the confirmed neoplasms were judged as related to study treatment by the investigator. No reports of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 47/68 
 
  
  
pancreatic cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma or any other thyroid malignancies have been received for EQWS 
subjects. 
Acute renal failure 
There were no cases of acute renal failure reported in EQWS-treated subjects during the Phase 3 studies. A 
single case of acute renal failure occurred in a subject on Byetta treatment during the controlled period of study 
BCB118. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
There was 1 death in the EQWS clinical programme. During the extension phase of study BCB118, a subject who 
was originally assigned to treatment with Byetta died during the extension phase because of ascites and 
hepatocellular carcinoma that were judged as not related to study treatment by the investigator.  
Other serious adverse events 
During the Phase 3, controlled study period, 2.4% of the 410 EQWS-treated subjects experienced at least 1 SAE 
compared with 4.8%, 0%, and 3.3% of subjects in the Byetta, sitagliptin, and placebo groups, respectively. For 
the EQWS-treated subjects, the most common SAEs were Gastrointestinal disorders (0.7%; 1 case each of 
abdominal hernia obstructive, diarrhoea, and pancreatitis). 
During the extension period of study BCB118, 13 (4.2%) of the 309 EQWS-treated subjects experienced at least 
1 SAE, most commonly under the SOCs Cardiac disorders and Gastrointestinal disorders (3 subjects each SOC 
[1.0%]). 
Of the 35 events reported in EQWS-treated subjects, 2 events (severe SAEs of ascites and hepatocellular 
carcinoma) resulted in the death of a subject during the extension period of study BCB118. All events except 2 
cases of pancreatitis were considered to be unrelated to study treatment by the investigator.  
In Phase 2 study BCB110, there were 2 SAEs reported in the same subject in the placebo group of Cohort 2. 
Events of infected skin ulcer (recovered/resolved) and wound infection (not recovered/not resolved), both 
affecting the right foot, were reported in a 66-year-old, white, male. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Potentially clinically significant non-hepatic laboratory abnormalities 
The incidence of potentially clinically significant non-hepatic laboratory abnormalities was low (<1%) for most of 
the non-hepatic parameters in EQWS-treated subjects. The incidence of potentially clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities in EQWS-treated subjects was ≥1% and at least twice the rate for placebo only for 
bicarbonate <18 mmol/L, creatinine ≥1.5 x baseline, and triglycerides >5.65 mmol/L. 
Potentially clinically significant hepatic laboratory abnormalities 
The incidence of potentially clinically significant hepatic laboratory abnormalities was also low. The only 
potentially clinically significant hepatic laboratory abnormalities with an incidence at least twice the rate for 
placebo were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (1.0% versus 0%, placebo), 
ALT >5 x ULN (0.5% versus 0%, placebo), and aspartate aminotransferase >3 x ULN (0.5% versus 0%, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 48/68 
 
  
  
placebo). These transaminase elevations were transient and none were associated with a hepatobiliary AE. No 
elevations in bilirubin >1.5 x ULN or cases meeting possible Hy’s Law criteria were reported in the EQWS clinical 
studies. 
Vital signs 
Between baseline and the last on-treatment assessment during the Phase 3, controlled study periods, there 
were no clinically meaningful effects on heart rate, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the EQWS-treated 
subjects. Heart rate increased by a mean (SD) of 2.4 (9.0) beats per minute. Sitting systolic blood pressure 
decreased by a mean (SD) of 1.6 mmHg from a baseline value of 128.9 mmHg, and sitting diastolic blood 
pressure increased by a mean (SD) of 0.14 mmHg from a baseline value of 77.8 mmHg. 
Safety in special populations 
Effect of age 
Of the 410 EQWS-treated subjects in the Phase 3, controlled study periods, 336, 64, and 10 subjects were aged 
<65, 65 to <75, and ≥75 years, respectively. The small number of subjects aged ≥75 years precludes including 
this subgroup in comparisons based on age. 
Overall adverse events 
The overall incidence of AEs was similar in EQWS-treated subjects aged <65 years (63.7%) and those aged ≥65 
years (66.2%). At the SOC level, AEs were generally similar between the <65 years and ≥65 years 
EQWS-treated age groups. The most notable between-group differences for these 2 age groups were higher 
incidence rates in the ≥65 years age group of Eye disorders (6.8% vs 1.2%), Gastrointestinal disorders (27.0% 
vs 19.0%), General disorders and administration site conditions (32.4% vs 25.0%), Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (16.2% vs 9.2%), and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (9.5% vs 3.3%). The 
incidence of AEs in the SOC of Investigations was greater in the <65 years age group (8.0%) than in the ≥65 
years age group (4.1%). 
Among subjects in the Byetta treatment group in study BCB118, gastrointestinal AEs were reported in 25.0% of 
subjects aged ≥65 years and in 39.8% of subjects aged <65 years. In the study BCB120 placebo group, 
gastrointestinal AEs were reported in 0% of subjects aged ≥65 years and in 3.7% of subjects aged <65 years. 
The most frequently reported AEs by age group are summarised in Table 12.

Table 12  Adverse events reported in ≥5% of all EQWS-treated subjects by age – Phase 3 controlled 
Hypoglycaemia 
Events of minor hypoglycaemia and symptoms of hypoglycaemia (excluding data after rescue) were evenly 
balanced between EQWS-treated subjects aged <65 years and those aged ≥65 years. 
Antibodies to exenatide 
Among the EQWS-treated subjects, 74.8% of subjects aged <65 years and 70.6% of those aged ≥65 years were 
positive for antibodies to exenatide during the controlled periods of the Phase 3 studies. 
Effect of renal function status 
Of the 410 EQWS-treated subjects in the Phase 3, controlled study periods, 187 had normal renal function at 
baseline (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73m2), 193 had mild impairment (eGFR ≤60 to ≤89 mL/min/1.73m2), and 30 
had moderate impairment (eGFR 30 to ≤59 mL/min/1.73m2). Because of the relatively low number of subjects 
with moderate renal impairment, comparisons between this subgroup and the normal renal function and mild 
renal impairment subgroups should be made with caution. 
Overall adverse events 
The overall incidence of AEs was very similar in subjects with normal renal function (64.2%), mild renal 
impairment (64.2%), and moderate renal impairment (63.3%). For most SOCs, the incidence of AEs was 
balanced across the 3 subgroups. Compared with the subgroups with mild or moderate renal impairment, the 
incidence of AEs was lower in the normal renal function subgroup for the SOCs Gastrointestinal disorders (16.6% 
vs 23.8 and 23.3%, respectively), General disorders and administrative site conditions (23.5% vs 28.5% and 
30.0%, respectively), and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (6.4% vs 13.5% and 16.7%, 
respectively). In subjects with moderate renal impairment, the incidence of Eye disorders was greater than in 
subjects with normal renal function or mild impairment (6.7% vs 2.1% and 1.6%, respectively). Furthermore, 
the incidence of AEs was lower in the moderate renal impairment subgroup compared with the normal renal 
function and mild impairment subgroups for the SOCs Investigations (0% vs 6.4% and 9.3%, respectively) and 
Nervous system disorders (3.3% vs 9.6% and 11.9%, respectively). 
Among subjects in the Byetta treatment group in study BCB118, gastrointestinal AEs were reported in 38.2%, 
34.2%, and 46.7% of subjects with normal, mildly impaired, and moderately impaired renal function 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018

respectively. In the study BCB120 placebo group, gastrointestinal AEs were reported in of 2.9%, 3.8%, and 0% 
subjects with normal, mildly impaired, and moderately impaired renal function respectively. 
The most frequently reported AEs by renal function status are summarised in Table 13. 
Table 13 Adverse events reported in ≥5% of all EQWS-treated subjects by renal function status – 
Phase 3 controlled 
Hypoglycaemia 
Among the controlled study period Phase 3, EQWS-treated subjects, there was a slight trend towards an 
increased incidence of hypoglycaemia with increasing renal impairment. The respective rates of minor 
hypoglycaemia and symptoms of hypoglycaemia were 4.8% and 7.5% in subjects with normal renal function, 
6.7% and 11.9% in subjects with mild renal impairment, and 13.3% and 13.3% in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment. The incidence rates of minor hypoglycaemia were markedly higher in subjects taking a 
sulphonylurea (25.0% to 28.6%) compared with those not taking a sulphonylurea (0% to 0.6%) within each of 
the renal function subgroups. The incidence rates of hypoglycaemia in subjects who were taking or not taking a 
sulphonylurea at baseline were generally similar across the 3 renal function subgroups. 
Antibodies to exenatide 
Among the EQWS-treated subjects, 74.6% of subjects with normal renal function, 74.3% of subjects with mild 
renal impairment, and 69.0% of those with moderate impairment were positive for antibodies to exenatide 
during the controlled periods of the Phase 3 studies. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018

Immunological events 
Antibodies to exenatide 
Overall, 74.0% of EQWS-treated subjects developed antibodies to exenatide at some point during the Phase 3, 
controlled period, with 42.2% of EQWS subjects developing low-titre (<625) antibodies and 31.8% developing 
high-titre (≥625) antibodies. The percentage of antibody-positive subjects reached a peak by about 16 weeks of 
treatment and then showed a slight reduction during the remainder of the study period. 
During the controlled period of study BCB118, the incidence of treatment-emergent antibody-positive subjects 
was somewhat higher in the EQWS group (76.2%) compared with the Byetta group (50.3%). High-titre 
antibodies developed in 32.2% and 11.9% of EQWS and Byetta subjects, respectively. During treatment with 
EQWS in the uncontrolled, extension period, 52.1% of subjects initially randomised to EQWS and 61.8% of 
subjects initially randomised to Byetta were antibody-positive at Week 52. 
Potentially immune-related adverse events by antibody status and titre category 
During the Phase 3, controlled period, the overall incidence of potentially immune-related AEs in EQWS-treated 
subjects was 25.4% in those who were antibody-positive and 17.6% in those who were antibody-negative. For 
the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, the incidence of potentially immune-related AEs (such as rash, 
dermatitis, and urticaria) was 3.4% and 0% for antibody-positive and antibody-negative subjects, respectively. 
In study BCB118 (controlled period), the incidence of potentially immune-related AEs was greater in subjects in 
the EQWS treatment group (28.9%, antibody-positive; 27.8%, antibody-negative) than in the Byetta group 
(11.1%, antibody-positive; 9.9%, antibody–negative).  
During the Phase 3, uncontrolled, extension period, the overall incidence of potentially immune-related AEs in 
EQWS-treated subjects was lower in antibody-positive subjects than in antibody-negative subjects (4.6% 
versus 7.7%).  
In the antibody-positive, EQWS-treated subjects during the Phase 3, controlled period, the overall incidence of 
potentially immune-related AEs was greater in high-titre (29.6%) versus low-titre (22.3%) subjects.  
During the Phase 3, uncontrolled, extension period, the overall incidence of potentially immune-related AEs was 
5.8% in the low-titre, antibody-positive, EQWS-treated subjects and 1.7% in subjects in the high-titre category. 
Potentially immunogenic injection site-related adverse events by antibody status and titre category  
In the EQWS-treated subjects during the Phase 3, controlled period, potentially immunogenic injection 
site-related AEs under the SOC General disorders and administration site conditions were reported in 21.0% of 
antibody-positive and 15.7% of antibody-negative subjects.  
In the EQWS-treated subjects during the Phase 3, uncontrolled, extension period, the overall incidence of 
potentially immunogenic injection site-related AEs under the SOC General disorders and administration site 
conditions was low and similar in antibody-positive (3.1%) and antibody-negative (2.9%) subjects.  
In the antibody-positive, EQWS-treated subjects during the Phase 3, controlled period, the overall incidence of 
potentially immunogenic injection site-related AEs was greater in high-titre (27.2%) versus low-titre (16.3%) 
subjects. Moreover, the overall incidence of potentially immunogenic injection site-related AEs in low-titre 
subjects was similar to that in antibody-negative subjects (16.3% versus 15.7%).

During the Phase 3, uncontrolled, extension period, the overall incidence of potentially immunogenic injection 
site-related AEs was 4.3% in the low-titre, antibody-positive, EQWS-treated subjects and 0% in subjects in the 
high-titre category.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Given that exenatide is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, it is not expected to have metabolism-based 
interactions with concomitantly administered oral medications. However, because it slows gastric emptying, 
exenatide has the potential to alter the absorption of orally administered drugs. 
Although the effect of exenatide on gastric emptying has not been studied with the EQWS formulation, the 
effects of both Bydureon and Byetta on gastric emptying were assessed in a subset of subjects in study 
2993LAR-105. Gastric emptying was assessed by measuring the absorption of acetaminophen (paracetamol) 
after oral administration. From the results of this study, it was concluded that   Bydureon caused a smaller 
reduction in the rate of acetaminophen absorption than Byetta in both the fed and fasted states. Furthermore, 
the rate of acetaminophen absorption was marginally lower with   Bydureon treatment in the fasted state 
compared with that in the fed state. During Bydureon and, by extension, EQWS treatment, no adjustment of 
concomitant oral drug administration is needed, including drugs that must reach threshold levels for efficacy, 
such as certain antibiotics. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
During the controlled study period, AEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment occurred in 16 (3.9%) of 
EQWS-treated subjects, and in 7.5%, 0% and 4.9% of subjects in the Byetta, sitagliptin, and placebo treatment 
groups, respectively. For the EQWS subjects, the AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were most 
commonly under the SOCs Gastrointestinal disorders (8 subjects [2.0%]) and General disorders and 
administration site conditions (5 subjects [1.2%]). 
During the extension period of study BCB118, 4 (1.3%) of the 309 EQWS-treated subjects experienced at least 
1 AE that led to discontinuation of study treatment. One subject discontinued because of pancreatitis, 1 
discontinued due to visual impairment, and 1 discontinued due to injection site nodule, muscle spasms, and 
weight increased. The fourth subject discontinued because of ascites and hepatocellular carcinoma and 
subsequently died. 
There were no AEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment in Phase 2 study BCB110. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
EQWS is a subcutaneously injectable prolonged-release non-aqueous suspension formulation that was 
developed as extension to Byetta (approved in 2006) and Bydureon (approved in 2011). Thus there is long 
clinical experience with Byetta and Bydureon and the safety profile is well known.  
A total of 549 subjects have been exposed to the new formulation, the majority of these patients were exposed 
for 28 weeks. In addition, 193 subjects out of the 197 subjects who completed the 28-week controlled period in 
study BCB118 enrolled in the 24 week extension period and were thus exposed for up to 52 weeks. Considering 
the previous experience with Byetta and Bydureon, this is considered sufficient. 
Adverse events were most commonly reported in patients on Byetta BID treatment (75%) whereas 64% of 
patients on EQWS reported at least one AE (71% in study BCB118 and 56% in study BCB120). The lowest 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 53/68 
 
  
  
reporting of AEs was observed in the sitagliptin treated group (33%). The reporting of SAEs was low and 
balanced between groups treated with exenatide and placebo, whereas no SAEs were reported in the sitagliptin 
treated group. Discontinuations due to AEs occurred at a similar rate in patients treated with EQWS (4%) and 
placebo (5%), whereas the rate of discontinuations due to AE was somewhat more common in the Byetta BID 
treated group (8%). 
The predominating AEs with EQWS treatment were gastrointestinal events and injection site reactions. 
Gastrointestinal events were less common than with Byetta BID (20.5% vs 37%) but similarly distributed 
among preferred terms. In line with the mechanism of action for sitagliptin, gastrointestinal events were the 
most commonly reported AEs also in this group (7.4%). Injection site reactions were more common in EQWS 
treated subjects than in Byetta BID treated subjects (26% vs 2%). 
The overall rate of infections and infestations did not differ from that observed in the placebo treated group 
whereas musculoskeletal disorders were more commonly reported in the EQWS treated group. Headache and 
dizziness was also more common in the EQWS treated group than in the placebo treated group. In this context 
it should be taken into account that the placebo treated group was small (61 subjects). 
During the extension period, no apparent differences between patients continuing on EQWS or switching to 
EQWS were observed apart from a higher reporting of injection site reactions. Notably, the reporting of 
gastrointestinal events was lower during the extension period than in the controlled period in both groups. 
Adverse events of special interest were gastrointestinal events, pancreatitis, hypoglycaemias, injection site 
reactions, cardiovascular events, neoplasms and renal failure. The selection was based on previous experience 
with exenatide and is considered adequate. 
Gastrointestinal events were commonly reported with EQWS but less common than with Byetta BID. When 
presented graphically, it is clear that initiation and dose increase of Byetta BID is related to a high reporting of 
events. The reporting of events in the EQWS treated group slowly increased over time, which may represent the 
increase in exposure as steady state is reached. However after about four months, the reporting again 
decreased. The risk of gastrointestinal events is adequately reflected in the PI. 
Two cases of pancreatitis were reported in EQWS-treated subjects. The risk of pancreatitis is reflected in the PI. 
Previously pancreatitis was only described as observed post-marketing with Bydureon. The SmPC, sections 4.4 
and 4.8, has been updated to reflect the observed frequency in the studies. 
Hypoglycaemic events were collected separately from AEs. Only one major hypoglycaemic event was observed. 
This event occurred in a patient on concomitant treatment with Byetta and sulphonylurea. Minor events 
occurred in 6.3% of subjects on EQWS treatment. The highest reporting was observed in patients on 
concomitant SU treatment where 26% of patients reported an event. The risk of hypoglycaemia is adequately 
reflected in the PI. 
Injection site reactions were common in EQWS treated patients. One reaction (injection site urticaria) was 
considered severe; otherwise the reactions were mild to moderate. The incidence declined after the first three 
months of treatment. Localised reactions have also been frequently observed with Bydureon which contains the 
same polymer microsphere formulation. The risk of injection site reactions is adequately reflected in the PI. 
There were few events of cardiac disorder across the phase 3 program and no apparent difference in the 
incidence across the treatment groups in the controlled periods of the studies. The data does not evoke any new 
safety concerns with regards to cardiovascular safety.

EMA/700805/2018

All neoplasms were reported within one year of exposure to EQWS and the three neoplasms observed in the 
controlled period of the studies occurred within two months of study start (Day 1, Day 19 and Day 65). None of 
the confirmed neoplasms were judged as related to study treatment which is endorsed. 
One case of acute renal failure in relation to septic shock was reported in a subject treated with Byetta. No cases 
were observed in subjects treated with EQWS. 
Only one death (due to hepatocellular carcinoma) occurred. This event was not considered related to study 
treatment which is endorsed. 
The reporting of SAEs was low during the controlled period of the studies. All events were single events. The 
same pattern was observed in the open-label extension of study BCB118.  
No clinically significant changes in non-hepatic laboratory test were observed. Events of increased liver enzymes 
were few and no increased bilirubin values were recorded. In line with previous observations, an increase in 
heart rate of 2.4 beats per minute was observed. There was a slight decrease in SBT of 1.6 mmHg whereas DBT 
remained essentially unchanged. 
When analysed by age, AEs were essentially similar in patients ≥65 years than in patients <65 years (66.2% vs 
63.7%). However, injection site nodules and gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting) were 
more common in the older age group. No relevant difference in the occurrence of hypoglycaemia was observed 
between age groups. Comparable proportions of patients in both age groups developed antibodies against 
exenatide. Due to the low number of patients aged ≥75 years (10 patients), further analysis of the safety data 
in this age group is not considered meaningful. 
The overall incidence of AEs was very similar in subjects with normal renal function (64.2%), mild renal 
impairment (64.2%), and moderate renal impairment (63.3%). For the SOCs Gastrointestinal disorders 
(nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting), General disorders and administrative site conditions (injections site nodule, 
injection site pruritus) and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders there was an increase in the 
reporting by decreasing renal function, although the data in patients with moderate renal impairment has to be 
interpreted with caution due to the low number of patients (n=30).  
The SmPC does not recommend any dosage adjustment of EQWS in patients with mild renal impairment. EQWS 
is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease receiving 
dialysis. Considering that the exposure of exenatide is increased in patients with impaired renal function and 
that there appears to be an increase in AEs in this population, this recommendation should be maintained. 
A large proportion of patients (74%) had developed antibodies to exenatide by week 16. About 32% of patients 
had developed high-titre antibodies. After that time-point a slight decline was observed. After 52 weeks of 
treatment 52% of patients were still antibody-positive. Potentially immune-related AEs were more common in 
those who were antibody-positive than in those who were antibody-negative (25.4% vs 17.6%). This was 
mainly due to a higher reporting of injection site reactions. There was a decrease in reporting over time and 
there was no difference between groups in the extension period of study BCB118. The reporting was also higher 
in patients with high antibody titres compared to those with low titres. Notably, potentially immune-related 
events were about three times more common in the EQWS treated patients compared to patients treated with 
Byetta BID. The most common potentially immunogenic adverse events were different injection site reactions 
which constituted about 85% of these reactions. 
No new data regarding drug interactions have been submitted. Previous data obtained with Bydureon has shown 
that the delay of gastric emptying does not warrant any adjustments of concomitant oral drug administration. 
Based on the data on exposure with the new formulation, these data may be extrapolated. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 55/68 
 
  
  
In total 16 patients discontinued due to AEs among EQWS treated patients. The most common reasons for 
discontinuation were gastrointestinal events and injection site reactions. The discontinuation rate due to GI 
events was lower than observed in the groups treated with Byetta BID. 
No post-marketing data is available for the new formulation. In the postmarketing setting, the total cumulative 
exposure to Byetta is estimated to be over 3,117,218 patient-years since and the total cumulative exposure to 
Bydureon is estimated to be over 1,307,511 patient-years since market launch. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety data provided with this application is based on the exposure of a total of 549 subjects to the new 
formulation; the majority of these patients were exposed for 28 weeks. In addition, 193 subjects were exposed 
for up to 52 weeks. The data provided show that the safety profile of the new formulation is essentially 
comparable to that previously observed with exenatide. Compared to the immediate release formulation, 
gastrointestinal events are less prominent whereas injection site reactions are more common with the new 
formulation. This is in line with the observations made with Bydureon. Considering the previous experience with 
Byetta BID and exenatide once weekly aqueous suspension, the safety data provided for the new formulation is 
considered sufficient and no new safety concerns have emerged.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication proposed for Bydureon autoinjector is: 
“Bydureon autoinjector is indicated in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve 
glycaemic control in combination with other glucose lowering medicinal products when the therapy in use, 
together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for 
available data on different combinations).” 
The aim of therapy is to improve metabolic control in terms of blood glucose, thereby decreasing the risk of 
microvascular and macrovascular long-term complications. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Initial management includes lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. Pharmacological treatment includes 
insulin, biguanides, TZDs, SUs, meglitinides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors 
and GLP-1RA. With the exceptions of insulin and GLP-1RA all are administered orally. 
Despite combination therapy and/or insulin treatment, a sizeable proportion of patients remain poorly 
controlled. One important issue is compliance to treatment. Some medicinal products for injection are 
complicated to administer and there is a need for formulations that are easier to use. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The study program includes one Phase 2 study and two Phase 3 studies. 
Study BCB110 was a Phase 2 study with the primary objective to investigate PK for the new formulation and to 
gather safety and efficacy data in support of the selected dose of 2 mg EQWS. 
Both Phase 3 studies (BCB118 and BCB120) were randomised, open-label trials of efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of EQWS in subjects with T2DM.  
Study BCB118 included patients required to be treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with a 
stable regimen of oral antidiabetes medication and compared EQWS with Byetta BID. The controlled study 
period was of 28 weeks duration. In the 24 week extension period, all patients were treated with EQWS. 
Study BCB120 included patients required to be treated with a stable regimen of ≥ 1500 mg/day metformin. This 
was a three-armed study of 28 weeks duration in which EQWS was compared to both sitagliptin and placebo. 
Overall, 742 subjects were randomised to the 2 Phase 3 studies, 410 were exposed to EQWS, 146 subjects were 
exposed to Byetta, 122 to sitagliptin and 61 were treated with placebo. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was met in both studies, where EQWS showed a significantly larger reduction of HbA1c 
from baseline vs Byetta BID (treatment difference -0.4%; study BCB118) and vs sitagliptin (treatment 
difference -0.4%) and placebo (treatment difference -0.7%; study BCB120).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 61/68 
 
  
  
The primary endpoint was calculated excluding patients on rescue therapy or terminated early. The proportion 
of patients included in the analysis was balanced between groups (BCB118: 77% on EQWS vs 74% on BIB; 
study BCB120: 78% on EQWS vs 80% on sitagliptin). The only exception is the placebo group where only 62% 
of patients were included in the analysis. 
In both studies, a numerically higher proportion of patients achieved the treatment goal of HbA1c <7% in the 
EQWS treated groups compared (49% and 43%, BCB118 and BCB120, respectively) to Byetta BID (43%) or 
sitagliptin (32%). The difference compared to sitagliptin reached statistical significance. The conservative 
sensitivity analysis showed a similar pattern although no significant differences were observed. 
In both studies, a numerically larger reduction in FPG was observed in the EQWS treated groups compared to 
Byetta BID, sitagliptin or placebo. Statistical significance was only reached when compared to placebo. 
The largest reduction in body weight was observed with Byetta BID (-1.9 kg), although not significantly different 
from EQWS (-1.5 kg; study BCB118). In study BCB120, the weight reduction with EQWS (-1.1 kg) was 
comparable to that observed with sitagliptin (-1.2 kg) but significantly larger than with placebo (+0.2 kg). 
Change in 2-hour PPG was evaluated in a subset of patients after a meal test. The numerically largest effect was 
observed with Byetta BID (-6.31 mmol/L), although the difference compared to EQWS (-4.83 mmol/L) was not 
statistically significant (study BCB118). In study BCB120, the decrease in 2-hour PPG was significantly larger 
with EQWS compared to sitagliptin but only numerically larger than placebo. 
The outcome is largely in line with the outcome observed in comparable studies with Bydureon aqueous 
suspension. 
Data from the long-term extension show that HbA1c increased from week 20 and onwards in the group treated 
with EQWS and appeared to reach a plateau after week 44. Patients switching from Byetta BID to EQWS showed 
a decrease in HbA1c after the switch and at week 52 both treatment arm showed no difference in change from 
baseline in HbA1c. The FPG showed a similar development as HbA1c, with some increase in the EQWS group 
which appeared to plateau. A further decrease in FPG was observed in patients switching from Byetta BID to 
EQWS and no difference was observed between treatment groups at week 52. The proportion of patients 
achieving HbA1c <7% decreased over time to 38.4% at week 52 compared to 49.3% at week 28. Body weight 
remained essentially stable after week 20 in both treatment groups. The larger reduction in body weight 
observed in patients who started on Byetta BID was maintained throughout the study period. 
Almost 60% of patients had positive antibody titres at week 28. In both studies, the effect on HbA1c was 
comparable in antibody-negative patients (-1.39% and -1.05%) and patients with low antibody titers (-1.48% 
and -1.14%), whereas an attenuated response was observed in patients with high antibody titers (-0.74% and 
-0.58%, study BCB118 and BCB120 respectively). 
Subgroup analysis did not reveal any difference in the effect of EQWS on HbA1c reduction in the adequately 
sized subgroups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The study program is well designed but has limitations in relation to the proposed indication. However, as the 
exposure to exenatide with EQWS is comparable to that observed with the Bydureon aqueous formulation, 
efficacy data obtained with Bydureon can be extrapolated to EQWS.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A total of 549 subjects have been exposed to the new formulation, the majority of these patients were exposed 
for 28 weeks. In addition, 193 subjects out of the 197 subjects who completed the 28-week controlled period in 
study BCB118 enrolled in the 24 week extension period and were thus exposed for up to 52 weeks.  
Adverse events were reported by 64% of patients on EQWS (71% in study BCB118 and 56% in study BCB120) 
to be compared with 75% of patients on Byetta BID treatment. The lowest reporting of AEs was observed in the 
sitagliptin treated group (33%). The reporting of SAEs was low and balanced between groups treated with 
exenatide and placebo, whereas no SAEs were reported in the sitagliptin treated group. Discontinuations due to 
AEs occurred at a similar rate in patients treated with EQWS (4%) and placebo (5%), whereas the rate of 
discontinuations due to AE was somewhat more common in the Byetta BID treated group (8%). 
The predominating AEs with EQWS treatment were gastrointestinal events and injection site reactions. 
Gastrointestinal events were less common than with Byetta BID (20.5% vs 37%) but similarly distributed 
among preferred terms (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting). The reporting of events in the EQWS treated 
group slowly increased over time. However after about four months, the reporting again decreased. The risk of 
gastrointestinal events is adequately reflected in the PI. 
Injection site reactions were more common in EQWS treated subjects than in Byetta BID treated subjects (26% 
vs 2%). One reaction (injection site urticaria) was considered severe; otherwise the reactions were mild to 
moderate. The incidence declined after the first three months of treatment. Localised reactions have also been 
frequently observed with the aqueous formulation of Bydureon which contains the same polymer microsphere 
formulation. The risk of injection site reactions is adequately reflected in the PI. 
Two cases of pancreatitis were reported in EQWS-treated subjects. The SmPC, sections 4.4 and 4.8, has been 
updated to adequately reflect the risk of pancreatitis.  
Overall, the reporting of hypoglycaemic events was low. Minor events occurred in 6.3% of subjects on EQWS 
treatment. The highest reporting was observed in patients on concomitant SU treatment where 26% of patients 
reported an event. The risk of hypoglycaemia is adequately reflected in the PI. 
During the extension period, no apparent differences between patients continuing on EQWS or switching to 
EQWS were observed apart from a higher reporting of injection site reactions in those switching to EQWS (6.9% 
vs 0.5%). The reporting of gastrointestinal events was lower during the extension period than in the controlled 
period in both groups (7.8%). 
In line with previous observations with exenatide treatment, an increase in heart rate of 2.4 beats per minute 
was observed. There was a slight decrease in SBT of 1.6 mmHg whereas DBT remained essentially unchanged. 
When analysed by age, AEs were essentially similar in patients ≥65 years than in patients <65 years (66.2% vs 
63.7%). However, injection site nodules and gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting) were 
more common in the older age group. No relevant difference in the occurrence of hypoglycaemia was observed 
between age groups.  
The overall incidence of AEs was very similar in subjects with normal renal function (64.2%), mild renal 
impairment (64.2%), and moderate renal impairment (63.3%). For the SOCs Gastrointestinal disorders 
(nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting), General disorders and administrative site conditions (injections site nodule, 
injection site pruritus) and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders there was an increase in the 
reporting by decreasing renal function, although the data in patients with moderate renal impairment has to be 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/700805/2018 
Page 63/68 
 
  
  
interpreted with caution due to the low number of patients (n=30). Adequate recommendations on the use of 
exenatide in patients with renal impairment are given in the PI. 
A large proportion of patients (74%) had developed antibodies to exenatide by week 16. About 32% of patients 
had developed high-titre antibodies. After that time-point a slight decline was observed. After 52 weeks of 
treatment 52% of patients were still antibody-positive. Potentially immune-related AEs were more common in 
those who were antibody-positive than in those who were antibody-negative (25.4% vs 17.6%). This was 
mainly due to a higher reporting of injection site reactions. The reporting was also higher in patients with high 
antibody titres compared to those with low titres. Notably, potentially immune-related events were about three 
times more common in the EQWS treated patients compared to patients treated with Byetta BID. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In total 549 patients have been exposed to EQWS, thus the safety database is limited. However, considering the 
experience with Bydureon aqueous suspension this is deemed sufficient, since the exposure to exenatide is 
comparable for the two formulations.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The main objective when treating T2DM is to achieve glycaemic control in order to reduce the risk of long-term 
complications. Since many patients with T2DM are overweight, it is considered beneficial if weight is reduced by 
the treatment. The data provided with the clinical program show that EQWS provide clinically relevant effects on 
glycaemic control in terms of HbA1c reduction and superiority was shown compared to active control (Byetta 
and sitagliptin). This reduction was achieved with concomitant decrease in body weight of 1 to 1.5 kg. The effect 
was maintained up to 52 weeks. With the long-term extension, data on the switch from Byetta to EQWS was also 
provided. 
The safety profile of EQWS did not differ significantly from what is already known for the two already approved 
formulations of the substance. The major adverse reactions were gastrointestinal events which are related to 
the mechanism of action. Further to this, injection site reactions were common, in line with what is already 
known for Bydureon aqueous suspension. These adverse events appear to subside over time and are considered 
manageable. 
The current application concerns a line extension to Bydureon aqueous suspension. Extrapolation of both 
efficacy and safety from Bydureon to EQWS, with regards to parts of the indication not covered by the clinical 
development program for EQWS, is acceptable since the exposure to exenatide is comparable for the two 
formulations. Therefore, the same indication as approved for Bydureon is also approvable for EQWS. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The effect of EQWS in the treatment of T2DM has been adequately shown and the safety profile is considered 
acceptable. The benefit risk balance is considered positive 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bydureon (including prolonged-release suspension for injection in pre-filled pen (BCise)) is 
positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Bydureon new pharmaceutical form is favourable in the following indication: 
Bydureon is indicated in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in 
combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including basal insulin, when the therapy in use, 
together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control (see section 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for 
available data on different combinations). 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning the 
following change(s): 
Variations requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
IIIB 
Extension application to introduce new pharmaceutical form (prolonged-release suspension for injection in 
pre-filled pen) grouped with type II variation to align the PI for the approved Bydureon products (powder and 
solvent for prolonged-release suspension for injection, and powder and solvent for prolonged-release 
suspension for injection in pre-filled pen) with the PI proposed for the Bydureon new pharmaceutical form 
(prolonged-release suspension for injection in pre-filled pen). In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
minor editorial changes through SmPC. Moreover, RMP versions 28 and 30 (incorporating versions 28 and 29) 
have been submitted as part of this application. RMP version 30 has been approved as part of this application. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, labelling, Package Leaflet and to 
the RMP. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Bydureon subject to the 
following conditions:

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 25 June 2021 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested:

Update of sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to extend the existing therapeutic indications for 
Keytruda to include the adjuvant treatment in monotherapy of adults with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at 
intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and 
resection of metastatic lesions.  The Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. The RMP version 35.1 has 
also been submitted 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  (an)  EMA  Decision(s) 
P/0043/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP (EMEA-001474-PIP01-13-M01) covering the condition 
‘Treatment  of  all  conditions  included  in  the  category  of  malignant  neoplasms  (except  nervous  system, 
haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue) was not yet completed as some measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

Scientific advice 
The Applicant consulted CHMP on the clinical development program for adjuvant RCC 
(EMEA/H/SA/2437/16/2016/II).

diagnosed in Europe with approximately 54,054 people expected to die from the disease (GLOBOCAN, 
2020). 
Well-known risk factors for RCC are cigarette smoking, obesity and hypertension (Chow et al. 2010). 
Renal cell carcinoma generally resists both traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgical 
resection can be curative for patients presenting with localized disease. However, one third of patients 
present with regional or distant metastases and the 5-year survival rate for metastatic disease is 
approximately 12%. Of patients with localized RCC treated with nephrectomy with curative intent, 
approximately one quarter relapse at distant sites. The prognosis in these cases is poor (Choueiri and 
Motzer 2017). Advanced RCC entails both locally advanced disease that is not amenable to local therapy, 
i.e. curative surgery or radiation therapy, as well as metastatic disease. Advanced RCC thus requires 
systemic treatment. There are currently no approved adjuvant treatments for RCC and observation 
remains the standard of care after nephrectomy.  
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The proposed new indication for Keytruda in this procedure is: 
“KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with RCC at intermediate-
high or high-risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of 
metastatic lesions.” 
Management 
Patients diagnosed with renal cancer are usually managed with nephron-sparing or total nephrectomy. 
However, a significant percentage of patients will develop recurrent disease and eventually die of RCC. 
Most patients with intermediate-high or high-risk lesions will experience recurrence within 2 to 3 years 
following surgery. These patients have a higher incidence of metastasis at the time of disease recurrence. 
The estimated 5-year survival of patients with localized low-, intermediate-, and high-risk RCC is 
approximately 92%, 67%, and 44% (respectively), and decreases to 12% in metastatic RCC patients. 
Currently, there is no globally accepted standard of care in adjuvant RCC, including patients with resected 
metastatic disease (M1 NED). NCCN and ESMO guidelines recommend a clinical trial as an alternative 
adjuvant option, while post-nephrectomy surveillance (category 2A) and adjuvant sunitinib (category 3) 
are also recommended in the 2021 NCCN guidelines. The EMA, however, has not approved adjuvant 
therapy with sunitinib. Therefore, novel treatments in the adjuvant setting are needed to prevent disease 
recurrence in patients with RCC at intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to inhibit 
the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. This blockade enhances functional activity 
of the target lymphocytes to facilitate tumor regression and, ultimately, immune rejection.  
Currently, Keytruda is approved in the EU (SmPC Keytruda):

phase 3 study to support the proposed indication. The overall design and statistical plan of the pivotal 
study for the adjuvant treatment of RCC (KEYNOTE-564) were generally agreed to. As part of the 
discussion, it was noted that the proposed eligibility criteria were considered to result in a heterogeneous 
patient population with regard to prognosis and risk of relapse due to inclusion of M1 NED patients, and 
that data to support a filing should be sufficiently mature.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted from the submission of ERA studies because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab is a protein, therefore an ERA has 
not been submitted by the MAH. This is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Clinical Pharmacology 
No new pharmacology data were submitted in support of this application. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No additional data have been provided with this submission which is considered acceptable as the clinical 
pharmacology properties of pembrolizumab were described in detail in the original marketing application 
and previous supplemental applications with new clinical data are consistent with results in the original 
marketing application. Available clinical pharmacology data are considered sufficient to support this 
application 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy  
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No formal dose-response studies have been carried out for the adjuvant RCC indication. Pembrolizumab 
dose and regimen used in the pivotal KEYNOTE-564 study 200 mg Q3W IV is the dosage currently 
approved in combination with chemotherapy for other indications (NSCLC, HNSCC).

Sample size 
Sample size calculation for primary endpoint DFS and key-secondary endpoint OS: 
The study was initially planned to randomize 950 subjects in a 1:1 ratio between the pembrolizumab and 
the placebo group (495:495). To be more in line with the actual final number of randomized subjects, 
power calculation in Amendment 03 was changed to be based on 994 subjects.  
The study was event-driven with minimum follow-up (calendar time) requirement at first interim analysis. 
For primary DFS and key-secondary OS endpoint, a Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function 
was constructed to implement group sequential efficacy boundaries to control the Type I error and a 
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function with gamma = -6 to derive futility boundaries. 
Assessment report  
EMA/33031/2022 
Page 17/111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The power calculation of the primary endpoint DFS was based on the following assumptions: 1) DFS 
follows a Poisson mixture cure rate model (de Castro, M., et al 2010) with assumed cure rate of 0.3 
(Leibovich, B. C., et al 2003) and with a median of 45 months for those not cured in the placebo group; 
2) An enrollment period of 27 months; 3) A yearly drop-out rate of 2%; 4) the true HR was 0.67. 
With 265 DFS events, there was approximately 84% power at IA1 to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 
(pembrolizumab versus placebo) with one-sided alpha spending of 1.22% under the DFS assumptions 
(see above). At IA2 of the study (final DFS analysis), with 332 DFS events there was 95% power to 
detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 at a one-sided alpha bound of 2.14% level. Overall, based on a target total 
number of 332 DFS events and one IA at approximately 80% of the target number of events (I.e. 265 
DFS events), the study has approximately 95% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 at an overall alpha 
level of 2.5% (1-sided). 
For the key-secondary OS endpoint, the power was conditional on the null hypothesis of DFS being 
rejected. The power calculation was based on the following assumptions: 1) OS follows an exponential 
distribution with a median of 145 months in the placebo group; 2) An enrollment period of 27 months ; 3) 
A yearly dropout rate of 1%; 4) the true HR is 0.67 for OS. 
With 200 OS events at final analysis and three interim analyses at approximately 47%, 66%, and 86% of 
the target number of events, there was approximately 79% power to detect a HR of 0.67 or 
approximately 88% power to detect a HR of 0.635 at one-sided 2.5% alpha level. This hypothesis may 
only be tested if primary endpoint DFS was supported when the hypothesis testing of DFS met statistical 
significance criterion. 
Randomisation 
990 subjects were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into pembrolizumab group or placebo group 
using the IVRS/IWRS. Treatment allocation/randomization was planned to be stratified according to 
metastasis status (M0 versus M1 NED) and within M0 group additionally by ECOG PS (0 versus 1) and US 
participant (YES versus NO).

Blinding (masking) 
The study was planned to be double-blind. Pembrolizumab and placebo were to be prepared and/or 
administered in a blinded fashion by an unblinded pharmacist or qualified trial site personnel. The 
participant and the investigator who were involved in the study treatment administration or clinical 
evaluation of the participants were to remain unaware of the group assignments. 
An external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) had access to unblinded patient treatment assignment.  
Statistical methods 
Study populations 
The primary and key secondary efficacy analyses were performed on the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) 
population, which includes all randomized participants. Participants were analyzed in the treatment group 
to which they were randomized. The safety analysis was performed on the All Participants as Treated 
population (APaT), including all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study 
treatment. The Patient reported outcomes (PRO) analyses were performed on the PRO full analysis set 
(FAS), defined as participants who received at least one study treatment and completed at least one PRO 
assessment. Efficacy data from participants in ITT population were analyzed in the treatment group to 
which they were randomized. Safety data from participants in APaT population were analyzed in the 
treatment group they actually received, which is the same as the treatment group to which they were 
randomized in this study.  
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was planned to be DFS assessed by investigator, defined as time from 
randomization to the first documented local recurrence, or occurrence of distant kidney cancer 
metastasis(es), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The time of recurrence was defined by 
the first documented recurrence, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment.  
Key-secondary endpoint was planned to be OS, defined as time from randomization to death due to any 
cause. 
Treatment differences in the primary and key-secondary endpoint were assessed by the stratified log-
rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals from stratified Cox Model with Efron’s tie 
handling method were reported. The stratification factors used in the randomisation were used as 
stratification factors in the primary and key-secondary analysis. 
Further secondary endpoints were DRSS1 and DRSS2. Curves in each treatment group were estimated by 
nonparametric cumulative incidence estimator. EFS was analysed by Kaplan-Meier method. The ITT 
population was used for analysing those secondary endpoints. 
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) were assessed by visit. A constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) 
was performed for the analysis of change from baseline in PROs using the PRO FAS. 
Sensitivity analyses for primary endpoint  
One sensitivity analysis with different censoring rules for DFS was planned to be performed for the 
primary analysis, see Table below. The sensitivity analysis was the same as the primary analysis except 
that events immediately after 2 consecutive missed disease assessments or after new anticancer therapy, 
if any, should be censored at last disease assessment prior to the earlier date of ≥2 consecutive missed 
disease assessments and new anticancer therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/33031/2022 
Page 19/111 
 
 
 
 
 
The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analysis are summarized as follows: 
Table 4 censoring Rules for Primary and Sensitivity Analysis of Disease-Free Survival 
To evaluate the robustness of the results from the primary analysis method after adjusting the potential 
confounding effect of baseline disease status, the following sensitivity analyses were added resulting from 
Amendment 03 and 04. DFS by investigator assessment was evaluated using stratification factors for 
randomization with baseline disease status as assessed by BICR (no evidence of disease [ie, NED] vs. 
evidence of disease [ie, non-NED]) as an additional stratum. In addition, DFS by BICR were analyzed as a 
sensitivity analysis in which participants enrolled with baseline disease by BICR will be censored at 
randomization date.  
Interim analyses 
Three interim analyses were planned for the study. Results were planned to be reviewed by an external 
DMC. The timing for the interim analyses and final analysis were defined as follows:  
Table 5 Boundary Properties for Planned Interim and Final Analyses for DFS  
Table 6 Boundary Properties for Planned Interim and Final Analyses for OS 
Assessment report  
EMA/33031/2022 
Page 20/111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One interim analysis of DFS after approximately 265 events (80% information fraction) and a minimum 
follow-up of at least 12 months and a final analysis of DFS after 332 events were planned to be 
performed. Four analyses of OS were planned, where the final analysis of OS was planned to be 
conducted based on 200 events, and interim analyses were planned at the time of interim and final DFS 
analysis (47%, i.e. 94 OS events, and 66%, i.e. 132 OS events, of information fraction expected) and one 
year thereafter (86%, i.e. 172 OS events, of information fraction expected). The first IA was always to be 
driven by the number of DFS events. The second IA was to be driven by DFS events unless DFS was to be 
rejected in the first IA. In this case, it was to be driven by the number of OS events. 
For primary DFS and key-secondary OS endpoint, a Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function 
was constructed to implement group sequential efficacy boundaries to control the Type I error and a 
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function with gamma = -6 to derive non-binding futility boundaries. Bounds 
were planned to be adjusted according to the actual number of events at each analysis.  
The alpha-reallocation was pre-specified in advance, see paragraph on Multiplicity below.  
As the information fraction is based on sample sizes (number of events) that were estimated, the alphas 
may change according to the available information (observed data). 
Multiplicity 
The family-wise type-I error was planned to be controlled on the one-sided 2.5% level, covering the 
primary and key-secondary hypotheses. If the DFS null hypothesis would be rejected at the 2.5% level, 
then the OS null hypothesis was planned to be formally evaluated for statistical significance at the 2.5% 
level. For each endpoint, group sequential methods were planned to be used to adjust for the interim and 
final analyses planned. If the DFS null hypothesis would be rejected at an interim or final analysis, each 
OS interim and final analysis test was planned to be compared to its rejection boundary for formal 
testing. For instance, the OS hypothesis would not be formally evaluated for statistical significance until 
the DFS null hypothesis would be rejected. 
Safety analysis

The analysis of safety results were performed by tiered approach. Summary statistics for baseline, on-
treatment, and change from baseline values were provided by treatment group. For Tier 2 endpoints, 
point estimates and 95% Cis were provided for between-treatment differences; only point estimates by 
treatment group were provided for Tier 3 safety parameters in percentage of subjects with events using 
the Miettinen and Nurminen method. Additionally, exploratory analyses were performed for time to first 
Grade 3-5 AEs by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie 
handling.

-To include metachronous and synchronous M1 NED post-operative 
nephrectomy ≤1 year. Since study inception, the inclusion of 
metachronous and synchronous M1 NED patients was intended; 
however, during protocol finalization metachronous was inadvertently 
#01 (02 Nov 2017) 
removed. 
-Collection of PK and ADA revised from “30 days after treatment 
discontinuation (or until participant starts new anticancer treatment)” 
to “at Safety Follow up” 
- Deleted PK/ADA objective The PK/ADA objective is now exploratory, 
not a secondary objective. 
- Changed from 4 to 3 interim analyses may be conducted. Removed 
IA1 due to insufficient duration of minimum follow-up resulting from 
prolonged enrollment period. 
- Updated the total number of DFS events expected at 48 months 
with at least 91.7% power to detect an HR of 0.67 when the study 
enrollment is extended from 18 months to 25 months. 
#2 (4 Sep 2019) 
per the most recent oncology standard. 
- Updated the censoring rules for DFS. Updated the censoring rules 
- Updated analysis strategy for safety parameters, ie, updated the 
criterion for Tier 2 safety events and updated the list of additional 
events to be considered as Tier 2 or Tier 3 safety events. Subjects 
enrolled in this study usually experience various adverse events of 
similar types, adverse events reported less frequent than in 10%, or 
SAE, Grade 3-5 events reported in less than 5% of subjects would 
obscure the assessment of overall safety profile and add little to 
meaningful interpretation. 
- Added secondary endpoint to compare event-free survival (EFS) as 
assessed by the blinded independent radiology review for participants 
treated with pembrolizumab versus those receiving placebo. 
- Changed duration of trial required to achieve the primary objective 
from 48 months to approximately 50 months. Projected duration of 
trial extended due to increased total targeted number of DFS events 
# 3 (11 May 2020) 
at IA2. (1) Changed the timing of interim analyses and final analysis. 
(2) Changed α-spending function for primary DFS from Hwang-Shih-
DeCani (HSD) spending function with γ= -15 to Lan-DeMets O’Brien- 
Fleming spending approximation α-spending function. 
#4 (13 Oct 2020) 
- Removed PK/ADA sample collection. 
- Updated censoring rules for the primary analysis and the sensitivity 
analysis. The new primary analysis is the old sensitivity analysis 1

Numbers analysed 
For IA1, efficacy analyses were conducted using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, and safety 
analyses were conducted using the All Participants as Treated (APaT) population, which included all 
randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Disease free survival (DFS) 
As of the data cutoff for IA1, a total of 260 DFS events (78% of the total planned events at the final 
analysis) were observed in the 2 treatment groups (109 in the pembrolizumab group and 151 in the 
placebo group). At the prespecified 2.5% overall alpha level (one-sided), pembrolizumab demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in DFS compared with placebo (median DFS was not reached in 
either treatment group; HR: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.53, 0.87]; and log-rank test p-value 0.0010, p-value 
boundary: 0.0114) Table 11. The KM curve separated from the outset in favour of pembrolizumab. The 
difference in the DFS rates between treatment groups at 12, 18, and 24 months ranged from 9.2% to 
9.6%.

Figure 2 Kaplan-Meier curve for disease-free survival by treatment arm in KEYNOTE-564 (intent to treat 
population) (Data cut-off date 14JUN2021) 
Secondary endpoints 
Overall survival (OS) 
The OS data were immature at IA1 with 51 deaths (26% of total planned OS events at the final analysis). 
For OS, the HR was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.96) (p=0.0164037) and the median OS was not reached in 
either group. The p-value did not cross the statistical hypothesis testing p-value boundary of 9.3×10-6 at 
IA1. The upper bound of 95% CI for the OS HR was below 1.0, with nearly twice as many deaths in the 
placebo group (33) compared with the pembrolizumab group (18).

Exploratory Endpoint:  
Progression-Free Survival 2 
A post hoc exploratory analysis of PFS2 based on investigator assessment was conducted. PFS2 was 
defined as the time from randomization to disease progression on next-line anticancer drug therapy, or 
death from any cause, whichever occurred first. A total of 63 participants in the pembrolizumab group 
and 86 participants in the placebo group received subsequent anticancer drug therapy.

Patient-Reported Outcomes 
PROs were assessed at Cycles 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17, as well as at discontinuation, 30-day follow-up, and 
annually during post-treatment follow-up until disease recurrence or new anticancer treatment was 
initiated. 
The 3 prespecified PRO endpoints were mean change from baseline in FKSI-DRS score, EORTC-QLQ-
C30 global health status/quality of life scores, and EORTC-QLQ-C30 physical functioning scale. 
Nominal p-values were computed for between-treatment group comparisons. Results were not adjusted 
for multiplicity, and therefore should be interpreted with caution. 
Completion rates for FKSI-DRS by visit at baseline through Week 52 were generally high (90.4% at 
baseline, 64.3% at Week 52) as were compliance rates overall (90.4% at baseline, 85.0% at Week 52), 
and were similar in both treatment groups.  
The completion and compliance rates for EORTC QLQC30 and EQ-5D-5L were similar to those for the 
FKSI-DRS. 
Key PRO Endpoints 
Change from Baseline in FKSI-DRS and EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/Quality of Life 
A change in FKSI-DRS score of ≥3 and a change in EORTC QLQ-C30 score of ≥10 were considered to be 
clinically meaningful.

For both FKSI-DRS and EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL score, no clinically meaningful 
decreases from baseline to Week 52 were observed in either the pembrolizumab or placebo groups.

Table 21 Analysis of Change from Baseline in FKSI-DRS Score to Week 52 (PRO FAS Population) 
Overall Improvement and Overall Improvement/Stability in FKSI-DRS and EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health 
Status/Quality of Life 
The percentage of participants with improvement and improvement/stability in FKSI-DRS score was 
numerically higher in the placebo group (12.2% [95% CI: 9.4, 15.4] and 66.1% [95% CI: 61.8, 70.3], 
respectively) compared with the pembrolizumab group (7.7% [95% CI: 5.5, 10.4] and 56.9% [95% CI: 
52.4, 61.4], respectively). The percentage of participants who experienced deterioration in FKSI-DRS 
score was 30.6% (95% CI: 26.6, 35.0) in the pembrolizumab group and 23.1% (95% CI: 19.5, 27.1) in 
the placebo group.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Consistent treatment effects were observed for DFS by investigator assessment across the prespecified 
subgroups with all CIs overlapping the CI for the primary DFS HR.

In a post hoc analysis, DFS by investigator assessment was evaluated in subgroups with and without 
sarcomatoid features since the presence of sarcomatoid features is considered to be associated with high 
risk of disease recurrence. Consistent DFS results with pembrolizumab compared with placebo were 
observed regardless of the presence or absence of sarcomatoid features. The DFS rate at 12 months was 
78.2% in the pembrolizumab group and 62.7% in the placebo group in the presence of sarcomatoid 
features (HR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.06) and 86.3% and 78.0%, respectively, in the absence of 
sarcomatoid features (HR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.92).

 BICR: Blinded independent central review. 
 Discrepancy on disease recurrence time is counted when more than 1 imaging assessment timepoint difference is 
observed. 
 Database Cutoff Date: 14DEC2020 
Differential discordance of disease recurrence based on investigator review versus BICR was estimated 
and are presented in the table below. The early discrepancy rate was calculated to quantify the frequency 
with which the investigator review declared disease recurrence early relative to BICR within each 
treatment group; the late discrepancy rate was calculated to quantify the frequency with which the 
investigator review declared disease recurrence later than BICR within each treatment group. Based on 
the criteria in Mannino et al , the estimated difference of early discrepancy rate (0.050) did not cross its 
threshold value of ≤-0.05 and the estimated difference of late discrepancy rate (-0.056) also did not 
cross its threshold value of ≥0.075.

counted when more than 1 imaging assessment timepoint difference is observed.  EDR= Early 
discrepancy rate, calculated as BICR disagreed / (BICR agreed  + BICR disagreed). LDR= Late 
discrepancy rate, calculated as BICR declared at earlier time / (BICR declared at earlier time + BICR 
disagreed). A difference in EDR <=-0.05 or a difference in LDR>=0.075 are suggestive of a systematic 
bias in the investigator assessment favoring the pembrolizumab arm. Database Cutoff Date:

In this study, the protocol required radiographic evidence for disease recurrence, while the confirmation 
by pathological assessments (eg, biopsy) was strongly encouraged. Concordance and discordance of 
radiographic disease recurrence and local pathological assessment of disease recurrence was analyzed 
post hoc. Of the 39 participants with disease recurrence determined by investigator review but not by 
BICR, 17.9% (7 participants, 3 in the pembrolizumab group and 4 in the placebo group) were declared 
with disease recurrence by investigator review based on both radiographic and pathological evidence, 
while no disease recurrence was declared by BICR based on imaging only. In addition, of the 55 
participants with disease recurrence determined by BICR but not by investigator review, 9.1% (5 
participants, 4 in the pembrolizumab group and 1 in the placebo group) were declared with disease 
recurrence by BICR of imaging, while no disease recurrence was declared by investigator’s assessment of 
imaging plus negative local pathological assessment results. As a result, in the total of 94 participants 
with discordance of disease recurrence assessments between investigator review and BICR, discordance 
was generally similar in both groups and 12 (13%) could be explained by the additional local pathological 
results that were only available for investigator review.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This is an extension of indication for pembrolizumab in the adjuvant treatment of patients at 
immediate/high and high risk of recurrent renal carcinoma (RCC) post nephrectomy supported by the 
results from the pivotal phase III study KEYNOTE-564 of pembrolizumab vs. placebo.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-564 is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Phase III study of adjuvant 
pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W for 17 cycles or 1 year vs. placebo in patients with RCC at intermediate-
high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy. 
Overall, the population recruited is a so-called “intermediate–high” and “high” risk subset. In the 
literature, there is no clear consensus about the definition for high risk. The MAH definition seems to 
replicate partially the UCLA Integrated Staging System (UISS) that incorporates the TNM classification, 
ECOG PS score, and Fuhrman grade. To define the “intermediate-high” risk group, the MAH included a 
subset of the UISS intermediate risk criteria and a subset of UISS high risk criteria to select patients with 
higher risk of recurrence. Considering the outcome in the control arm, the chosen criteria appear to be 
relevant to determine a more dismal prognosis. Therefore, criteria used to define the proposed target 
population “adults with RCC at intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence ” can be considered 
acceptable.   
Indication wording  
KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with RCC at increased risk of 
recurrence following nephrectomy or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions (for 
selection of criteria, please see section 5.1) 
Only patients with ECOG PS 0-1 were enrolled. Median age was 60 years, which is younger than the usual 
age at diagnosis of RCC (64 years (NCI).  
Since there are currently no approved adjuvant treatments for RCC, the placebo-controlled design 
appears appropriate.  
DFS according to investigator review could be an acceptable primary endpoint considering the adjuvant 
treatment setting, the inclusion of OS as secondary endpoint and the double-blind placebo controlled trial.  
However, in the Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/2437/16/2016/II) the MAH stated that DFS by Blinded 
independent central review (BICR) was planned to be the primary endpoint of KN564. In the light of the 
typical safety profile of pembrolizumab, it could be anticipated that the blinding of the investigator could 
be corrupted and therefore the assessment of the investigator could be biased.  
The statistical analysis plan is overall acceptable. The definition of time-to-event variables DFS and OS as 
time from randomization to the event is supported. The approach to DFS as a composite of objective 
disease recurrence or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), and an additional analysis of OS as 
key-secondary endpoint is in line with current guidance (Guideline on multiplicity issues in clinical trials, 
EMA/CHMP/44762/201). Censoring rules for the primary endpoint DFS are generally supported. The 
approach to interim analyses is in principle acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The data cut-off for the submitted IA1 was 14th Dec 2020 with a median follow-up of 23.9 months (range 
2.5 to 41.5 months). Efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT population. Baseline patients and 
disease characteristics appeared overall balanced between the two arms. Patients were classified in 
“intermediate-high” (pT2, Grade 4 or sarcomatoid, N0, M0 / pT3, any grade, N0, M0) with n=86% of the 
study population, “high” (pT4, any grade, N0, M0/ pT any stage, any grade, N+, M0) with n=7.6% and 
“M1 NED” RCC participants with n=5.8%. Overall, the population is dominated by a so called 
“intermediate – high” risk subset.   
In the ITT population pembrolizumab showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in DFS 
according to investigator assessment [median DFS not reached; HR 0.68 (95%CI: 0.53, 0.87), p = 
Assessment report  
EMA/33031/2022 
Page 71/111 
 
 
 
 
0.001]. The probability of being event free at year 1 and year 2 was 85.7% vs. 76.2% and 77.3% vs. 
68.1% for pembrolizumab and placebo, respectively. Data were based on 260 events (78% of final 
analyses). A high number of censoring after 1 year was noted. 
The OS data were immature at IA1 with 51 deaths (26% of total planned OS events at the final analysis). 
For OS, the HR was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.96) and the median OS was not reached in either group.  As 
OS data were too immature, the MAH provided DRSS1 and DRSS2 data (Disease Recurrence-specific 
Survival as assessed by the investigator) which could support the assumption that DFS results will 
translate into OS benefit.  In addition, a post hoc exploratory analysis of PFS2 based on investigator 
assessment (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.81) indicated a reduced risk of disease progression or death on 
next-line drug therapy in the pembrolizumab group compared with the placebo group based on still 
limited event rates.  
PRO assessments, including FKSI-DRS scale, EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL scale, EORTC 
QLQ-C30 functional scales, and EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom scales, generally showed limited differences 
between treatment groups.  
During the procedure the MAH Applicant provided updated efficacy results with additional 6 months of 
follow up (median duration of follow-up 29.7 months based on a data cutoff date of 14-JUN-2021).  
In the ITT population 23 additional DFS events had occurred with 5 additional DFS events in the 
pembrolizumab arm and 18 additional events in the placebo arm; the higher number of additional events 
in the placebo arm is considered reassuring. The HR for DFS at the updated analysis was 0.63 (95% CI: 
0.50, 0.80) in the ITT population, compared with an HR of 0.68 [95% CI: 0.53, 0.87] at IA1. At the 
updated data cut-off the DFS event rates were 23% and 33.9% in the pembrolizumab arm vs the placebo 
arm, respectively, thus representing 85% of the planned events at the final DFS analysis. DFS KM curves 
do not converge anymore at the updated data cut-off and the curves could suggest a trend towards 
reaching a plateau. In conclusion, the updated results support the DFS benefit that demonstrated 
statistical significance in the first IA. Overall survival data in the ITT population are still too immature to 
draw any reliable conclusions; at the updated analyses only 66 events had occurred (33% of the targeted 
200 OS events at the final analysis). However, despite the low absolute event rates, nearly twice as many 
OS events were reported in the placebo arm compared with the pembrolizumab treatment arm (with 5 vs 
10 additional OS events in the pembrolizumab vs the placebo arm at the updated DCO date). 
Nevertheless, the OS data is still immature and the MAH is recommended to provide updated OS data 
from study KEYNOTE-564 (REC).  
Exploratory results of DFS by independent assessment were provided. The HR for DFS by BICR was 0.78 
(95% CI: 0.61, 0.99) as compared to 0.63 (95% CI 0.50, 0.80) for the HR of DFS by investigators, based 
on the most recent data cut-off of June 2021. In line with the inferior point estimate of the HR by BICR  
the difference of 24 months DFS rates between both treatment arms was smaller for the independent 
assessment compared to the investigator assessment (5.8% vs 11% for BICR vs. INV, respectively). The 
disease recurrence assessments by BICR and investigators cannot be considered highly concordant (rates 
of 80.6% in the pembrolizumab arm and 86.7% in the placebo arm).  
Nonetheless, it should be taken into account that the DFS analysis by investigators is rather reflecting the 
real practice use in the clinical setting. In addition, since the assessment of EFS is a more comprehensive 
measure of the treatment effect of pembrolizumab in all study participants (also reflecting a delay of 
disease progression for patients with baseline disease), the results of the EFS analysis by BICR based on 
the December 2020 data cutoff can be considered supportive: EFS HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.56, 0.91). 
As already outlined above, the proposed eligibility criteria (intermediate-high/high/M1 ) resulted in a 
heterogeneous population with regard to prognosis and risk of relapse. While it could be reasonably

assumed that the absolute anti-tumour activity of pembrolizumab was not so much influenced by the 
stage of disease, the relative magnitude of the effect, and consequently the B/R, might change depending 
on the baseline risk of relapse. While a clear DFS benefit was detected in the small groups with high risk 
(HR of 0.60; 95% CI 0.33, 1.11) and M1NED (HR of 0.29; 95% CI 0.12, 0.69), the benefit/risk in the 
large group of the intermediate-high risk patients (HR of 0.75; 95% CI 0.57, 1.00) could not be 
adequately determined with the initial submission given the considerable heterogeneity of this subgroup 
and the immaturity of OS provided, but reassurance was provided with the updated data where the HR 
for DFS decreased to 0.68 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.24). Attempts to divide the large heterogeneous 
“intermediate-high” risk subgroup further into T3 N0 M0 G2-4 (as classified as high risk by UISS) and the 
complementary group of intermediate-high group risk did not identify a subgroup that would certainly not 
benefit from the treatment. Although the results in the complementary subgroup (pT3, N0, M0, Grade 1 
or pT2 [Grade 4 or sarcomatoid], N0, M0) appeared inferior compared to the T3 N0 M0 G2-4 subgroup, 
the patient numbers were too small to draw reliable conclusions and given the observed similar dismal 
prognosis, there is no rationale to assume a lower treatment effect in one of these subgroups.    
With the initial data cutoff, the DFS HR was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.51) in participants whose tumours 
express PD-L1 CPS <1, for the comparison of pembrolizumab compared to placebo. KM curves indicated 
no clinically meaningful treatment effect in this subgroup. Cumulative data from both arms suggested 
that PD-L1 expression could be a negative prognostic marker (also based on published literature), 
resulting in a better prognosis for PD-L1 negative patients as seen in several other indications, which 
could influence the relative magnitude of the effect. In addition, there is a strong biological plausibility for 
PD-L1 being predictive. Considering the association of biomarker status and efficacy outcomes, the 
treatment benefit of pembrolizumab in the overall study population appeared to be driven by the 
subgroup of patients with high PD-L1 expression status.  
With the updated DFS data (DCO 14-Jun-2021) the point estimate of the HR decreased from 0.83 (95% 
CI 0.45, 1.51) to 0.68 (0.37, 1.24) in the PD-L1 negative subgroup. Thus, the point estimates of the DFS 
HRs became very similar between the PD-L1 negative and positive subgroups. Considering the point 
estimates the concern regarding a smaller (and not clinically relevant) benefit in the PD-L1 negative 
population appears not valid anymore. Updated DFS KM curve for the CPS<1 subgroup showed a 
separation (Figure 11).  
2.4.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Interim data of Study KEYNOTE-564 showed a statistically significant DFS advantage of pembrolizumab 
over placebo in the adjuvant treatment of RCC. Updated results with additional 6 months of follow-up 
supported a clinically meaningful DFS benefit in the overall study population. Although survival data were 
still immature, OS results indicated a trend in favour of pembrolizumab. Further OS data are expected to 
be submitted as soon as available (REC). Taking the supportive Disease Recurrence-specific Survival and 
PFS2 results into consideration, a favourable B/R balance is concluded on for patients with RCC at 
increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety data set in support of the new indication of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the adjuvant 
treatment of RCC post nephrectomy derived from 488 participants in Study KEYNOTE-564 (KN564)

received pembrolizumab (Indication Dataset) and n=496 received placebo. In addition, safety data from 
the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (RSD, n=5884) were included for comparison. 
Table 40 Safety Datasets 
The Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (RSD) RDS comprises pooled safety data 
from approved indications in the EU from following studies: KN001, KN002, KN006, KN010, KN012 
(HNSCC), KN013 Cohort 3 (Hodgkin Lymphoma), KN024, KN040, KN042, KN045, KN048, KN052, KN054, 
KN055, and KN087. 
Patient exposure 
The median duration of exposure to pembrolizumab was >2-fold longer for participants in the Indication 
Dataset compared with the RSD (11.1 months vs 4.9 months, respectively), which is expected for 
pembrolizumab monotherapy when used as an adjuvant treatment.

Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
The demographics and baseline characteristics were generally similar between the Indication Dataset and 
the RSD apart from ECOG PS and age (lower rate of ECOG PS 1 and more participants ≤65 years of age 
in the Indication Dataset versus the RSD; see Table 5.5.4). The characteristics of participants were well 
balanced for the Indication Dataset and the placebo group.

Every participant is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence 
criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
 Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are 
included. 
 MedDRA preferred terms "Neoplasm Progression", "Malignant Neoplasm Progression" and "Disease Progression" not 
related to the drug are excluded. 
The most frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥20%) in the pembrolizumab arm of study KN564 were 
fatigue, diarrhoea, pruritus, arthralgia, hypothyroidism, and rash. The AEs with greatest percentage 
difference (risk difference of approximately ≥10%) between the pembrolizumab and placebo groups were 
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, pruritus, and rash (see Figure 28). 
The observed incidences of hypothyroidism (21.1% vs 11.1%) and hyperthyroidism (11.9% vs 4.2%) 
were higher in the Indication Dataset than in the RSD; all hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism events in 
the Indication Dataset were Grade 1 and Grade 2 except for 1 participant each with Grade 3 
hypothyroidism and Grade 3 hyperthyroidism. Blood creatinine increased (10.2% vs 4.4%) were also 
higher in the Indication Dataset than in the RSD; however, participants in study KN564 had prior 
nephrectomy (rate of blood creatinine increase was 8.5% in the placebo arm).

The two deaths in the Indication Dataset were reported due to AEs with PTs of pneumonia and multiple 
organ dysfunction syndrome; and 1 death due to AEs was reported in the placebo group (PT: hemorrhage 
intracranial). None of the deaths were considered treatment related by the investigator.  
Other significant events - Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI) 
AEOSI are immune-related events and infusion-related reactions associated with pembrolizumab.

Laboratory findings 
The percentage of participants with laboratory abnormalities during the study were higher in the 
pembrolizumab group compared with the placebo group. The most frequently reported laboratory 
abnormalities (incidence ≥20%) in the Indication Dataset were generally consistent with the RSD, and 
the majority had a CTCAE toxicity Grade of 1 to 2. 
Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities with an incidence of ≥2% in the pembrolizumab group were the 
following: ALT increased (3.8%), AST increased (2.7%), glucose increased (8.0%), lymphocyte decreased 
(2.5%), phosphate decreased (2.2%), and sodium decreased (3.3%).

A total of 3 participants (0.6%) in the pembrolizumab group and no participant in the placebo group had 
concurrent increases in aminotransferase to ≥3 x ULN plus bilirubin to ≥2 x ULN plus ALP to <2 x ULN. In 
the three cases meeting potential DILI screening laboratory criteria the participants were taking multiple 
concomitant medications associated with liver toxicity and the MAH concluded that the DILI screening 
laboratory test results were most likely related to the concomitant application of medications and not 
related to pembrolizumab. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
The AE profile in the Indication Dataset was generally similar across age groups of <65, 65 to 74, and 75 
to 84, although there was a small number of participants in the 75 to 84 years category (n=18; no 
participant was ≥85 years) and generally similar between participants who were <65 years and those ≥65 
years. 
The AE profile for categories of interest (central nervous system confusion/extrapyramidal, AE related to 
falling, cardiovascular events, cerebrovascular events, and infections) in the Indication Dataset was also 
generally similar across age groups of <65, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food 
and DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 enzymes, and 
other metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to interfere with the metabolism of an IgG antibody. The 
IgG antibodies, in general, do not directly regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, other

Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 04-SEP-2019 through 03-SEP-2020. There are no records of any pembrolizumab registration being 
revoked or withdrawn for safety reasons in any country. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data set in support of the new indication of pembrolizumab monotherapy in the adjuvant 
treatment of RCC post nephrectomy derived from 488 participants in Study KEYNOTE-564 (KN564) 
received pembrolizumab (Indication Dataset) and n=496 received placebo. In addition, safety data from 
the Pembrolizumab Monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (RSD, n=5884) were included for comparison. 
The median duration of exposure to pembrolizumab was >2-fold longer for participants in the Indication 
Dataset compared with the RSD (11.1 months vs 4.9 months, respectively), which is expected for 
pembrolizumab monotherapy when used as an adjuvant treatment. Although the median duration on 
therapy was the same for both treatment arms of study KN564, drug exposure by duration was lower in 
the pembrolizumab arm reflecting the higher discontinuation rates of pembrolizumab.  
The adverse event summary showed higher incidences across all AE categories for the Indication 
Dataset versus the placebo group, as expected for the comparison of an active treatment versus placebo. 
Regarding the comparison of the Indication Dataset versus the RSD, participants in the KN564 
pembrolizumab group had fewer overall SAEs and Grade 3 to 5 AEs compared with the RSD (20.5% vs 
38.5% and 32.4% vs 48.1%), which is likely attributed to participants in the KN564 Safety Dataset being 
generally younger, without evidence of metastatic disease, but with better ECOG performance status at 
study entry. Incidences of drug-related AEs (79.1% vs 70.2%), related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (18.9% vs. 
15.5%) and related SAEs (12.1% vs 11.1%) were numerically higher or similar in the Indication Dataset 
compared to the RSD.  
Incidences of treatment discontinuations due to AEs were higher in the Indication Dataset compared with 
the RSD (AEs: 20.7% vs 13.4%; drug-related AEs: 17.6% vs 7.0%) and remained numerically higher 
also after adjustment for duration of exposure (all-cause AEs: 2.43 vs 1.80; drug-related AEs: 2.08 vs 
0.94 events/100 person-months in the Indication Dataset vs RSD). 
The same pattern was observed when pooled safety data from adjuvant pembrolizumab studies were 
compared with study data from the advanced/metastatic setting.  
The most commonly reported AEs (incidence ≥20%) in the pembrolizumab arm of study KN564 were 
fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, arthralgia, hypothyroidism, and rash. Most common adverse events of 
pembrolizumab in study KN564 were generally consistent with the RSD apart from notably higher 
incidences of hypothyroidism (21.1% vs 11.1%) and hyperthyroidism (11.9% vs 4.2%). The higher rate 
of blood creatinine observed in the Indication Dataset compared to the RSD (10.2% vs 4.4%) is likely 
partly associated with the prior nephrectomy (rate of blood creatinine increased 8.5% in the placebo 
arm). In addition, diarrhoea, pruritus, arthralgia and rash were reported with numerically slightly higher 
frequencies in the Indication Dataset compared with the RSD (Table 43).   
Most frequently reported Grade 3 to 5 AEs (incidence ≥1.6%) were hypertension, alanine 
aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased and diarrhoea. Higher incidences for 
related Grade 3 to 5 AEs in the Indication Dataset compared to the RSD were reported for ALT and AST

increased (1.8% vs 0.6% and 1.2% vs 0.6%), diarrhoea (1.6% vs. 0.9%), adrenal insufficiency (1.2% 
vs. 0.2%) and diabetic ketoacidosis (1.0% vs. 0.1%).  
The most frequently reported SAEs (incidence ≥1%) in the Indication Dataset were acute kidney injury, 
adrenal insufficiency, pneumonia, colitis, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Though the incidences of these SAEs 
were low (≤1.2%), higher rates for adrenal insufficiency and diabetic ketoacidosis (both drug-related) 
were observed in the Indication Dataset compared to the RSD (1.2% vs 0.3% and 1.0% vs 0.2%). Some 
clinically relevant SAEs with frequency <1% are notable: meningitis aseptic (0.4% [2 events] in the 
Indication Dataset vs. 0% [no event] in the RSD; both AEs drug-related); Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(0.2% vs. 0% [2 events overall in the RSD]); vasculitis (0.2% vs. 0% in the RSD; AE drug-related); type 
1 diabetes (0.8% vs. 0.2%), and myocardial infarction (0.6% vs 0.3%; 2 events [0.4%] drug-related).  
Two deaths due to AEs (0.4%) were observed in the Indication Dataset (multiple organ dysfunction 
after accident and pneumonia) compared to 0.2% in the placebo group and 5.3% in the RSD.  
The incidence of AEOSI was higher in the Indication Dataset compared with the RSD (any 35.5% vs 
25.1%; drug-related 31.8% vs 21.8%); higher incidences were also reported for any and drug-related 
grade 3-5 AEOSI, serious AEOSI and AEOSI leading to discontinuations (see Table 52). After adjustment 
for different exposure higher rates of all-cause and drug-related AEs and AEs resulting in drug 
discontinuations remained, whereas grade 3-5 and serious AEs were comparable between both datasets. 
The higher incidence of any AEOSI in the Indication Dataset compared with the RSD was primarily driven 
by the increased incidences of hypothyroidism (21.1% vs 11.1%) and hyperthyroidism (11.9% vs 4.2%). 
However, numerically higher frequencies in the Indication Dataset versus the RSD were also observed for 
adrenal insufficiency (2% vs 0.8%), type 1 diabetes mellitus (1.8% vs. 0.3%) and sarcoidosis (0.8% vs 
0.2%), which also remained higher after adjustment by exposure. 
Regarding severity of AEOSI, Grade 2 events were observed in 21.1% vs 12.3% in the Indication Dataset 
vs the RSD while Grade ≥3 of were observed in 9.0% in the Indication Dataset versus 6.5% in RSD. Of 
note were e.g. higher rates of Grade 3-4 type 1 diabetes mellitus (1.8% vs. 0.3%) or adrenal 
insufficiency (1.2% vs. 0.4), although slightly higher rates were observed across most categories. 
Summary of outcome of AEOSI at a cutoff at June 2021 (with 6 months of longer follow-up) showed that 
in both, the Indication Dataset and the RSD, approximately half of the patients had AEOSI reported as 
not resolved or with sequelae.  The proportion of resolving AEOSI was higher in study KN564 (17.8% vs 
6.6% in the RSD); according to the MAH the resolving AEOSI in KN564 were primarily low grade 
hypothyroidism AEs which are likely to require ongoing long-term hormone replacement therapy. 
Therefore overall, the proportion of resolved AEOSI is slightly lower in study KN564 compared to the RSD 
(33.9% vs. 41.6%).  
To better characterize the safety profile in the adjuvant setting and identify possible differences compared 
to the established toxicity profile of pembrolizumab in the metastatic setting pooled safety analyses for 
the adjuvant studies were submitted. 
Side-by-side presentation showed that the safety profile of pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-564 was overall 
consistent with that of the pooled pembrolizumab adjuvant monotherapy dataset and the observed 
differences compared to the RSD were mainly confirmed.  
The incidence of AEOSI was higher in the Adjuvant Dataset compared with the Advanced/Metastatic 
Dataset (all 36.1% vs 24.2%, drug-related AEOSI 33.4% vs 20.8%, respectively). Although these 
differences were again primarily driven by the increased incidences of low-grade hypothyroidism and 
hyperthyroidism, also Grade 3-5 and serious AEOSI were reported with numerically slightly higher 
incidences in the adjuvant compared to the metastatic setting (exposure adjusted events/100 person

months: drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs 1.09 vs. 0.79; drug-related SAEs 0.91 vs 0.79 in adjuvant vs 
metastatic studies, respectively); besides colitis and hepatitis, numerically higher rates were also 
observed for endocrine AEOSI of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes 
mellitus. Discontinuations due to AEOSI were 7.9% vs 3.7%, respectively. The higher incidences of 
AEOSI in the adjuvant vs the metastatic setting is reflected in the SmPC 
Incidences of treatment discontinuations due to AEs were higher in the Indication Dataset compared 
with the RSD. The most frequent (incidence ≥1%) AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation (any and 
drug-related) in the Indication Dataset were ALT increased, adrenal insufficiency, and colitis; all occurred 
at higher frequencies than in the RSD. AEs with incidences ≥0.6% with higher incidences in the Indication 
Dataset compared to the RSD were aspartate aminotransferase increased, acute kidney injury, blood 
creatinine increased, arthritis, diarrhoea, rash, sarcoidosis and type 1 diabetes mellitus. 5 participants 
(1%) discontinued due to cardiac disorders which were all considered drug-related (2 participants due to 
myocardial infarction and 1 each for atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure and pleuropericarditis).  
The severity and time to onset of AE resulting in treatment discontinuation in the Indication Dataset did 
not show relevant differences compared to the dataset in the metastatic setting. The higher frequency of 
drug discontinuation due to AEs reported in KEYNOTE-564 as compared with the RSD is likely attributed 
to the lower rate of treatment discontinuation due to disease progression in KEYNOTE-564 (10.5% in 
KEYNOTE-564 vs >=34% in the RSD) that resulted in a longer duration of exposure, which contributes to 
a higher likelihood for treatment discontinuation due to AEs.  
Safety in special populations 
The AE profiles showed a general trend towards higher rates of toxicities with increasing age. Comparing 
the age groups below and above 65 years, the largest difference was notable for discontinuations due to 
AEs in the Indication Dataset (17.7% vs 27.1%). This was even more emphasized in the age group of 75-
84 years with discontinuation rates of 44.4% (for comparison discontinuation rates of 19.8% for the same 
age group in the RSD).   
In addition, large increases of grade 3-5 AEs and SAEs were notable for patients with 75-84 years 
compared to younger age groups in the Indication Dataset (see Table 5.4.26). These data suggest a 
worse tolerability of pembrolizumab in the adjuvant setting for elderly patients beyond 75 years (even 
though conclusions are limited by the small sample size of the age group 75-84 years, n=43). 
For patients with ECOG PS 1, higher incidences of grade 3-4 and SAEs were generally observed in study 
KN564 and the RSD. Of note, high rates of discontinuation due to AEs were reported for patients with 
ECOG PS of 1 in the Indication Dataset (27.8% compared to 19.5% for patients with good PS in the 
Indication Dataset and 15.4% for patients with PS 1 in the RSD). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety data of pembrolizumab in Study KEYNOTE-564 were generally consistent with the established 
safety profile of pembrolizumab; however, higher rates of discontinuations due to AEs and higher 
incidences of AEOSI were observed in the Indication Dataset compared with the RSD. The differences 
were driven by increased low-grade incidences of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism but included also

higher rates of grade 3-4 and serious AEs such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. The higher rates of AEOSI 
were confirmed in the pooled safety data for the pembrolizumab adjuvant studies in comparison to the 
dataset in the advanced/metastatic setting. For half of the participants AEOSI were not resolved or 
resolved with sequelae. The proportion of resolving AEOSI which likely requires ongoing long-term 
hormone replacement therapy was higher in the adjuvant than the metastatic studies. Since long-term 
toxicities are of special clinical relevance in the adjuvant setting, these differences in the rate of AEOSI 
are reflected in the SmPC.

The  claimed  indication  is  for  pembrolizumab  (Keytruda)  as  monotherapy  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of 
adults  with  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC)  at  intermediate-high  or  high  risk  of  recurrence  following 
nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions. 
During the procedure, the indication was updated as follows:  
Keytruda as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults with renal cell carcinoma at 
intermediate high or high increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy 
and resection of metastatic lesions (for selection criteria, please see section 5.1). 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents the sixth most common cancer in men and the eighth most 
common cancer in women, accounting for 3%-4% of all adult malignancies in the US (Siegel et al. CA A 
Cancer J Clin. 2019). In 2020, an estimated 138,611 new cases of kidney cancer were expected to be 
diagnosed in Europe with approximately 54,054 people expected to die from the disease (GLOBOCAN, 
2020). 
Well-known risk factors for RCC are cigarette smoking, obesity and hypertension (Chow et al. 2010). 
Renal cell carcinoma generally resists both traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgical 
resection can be curative for patients presenting with localized disease. However, one third of patients 
present with regional or distant metastases and the 5-year survival rate for metastatic disease is 
approximately 12%. Of patients with localized RCC treated with nephrectomy with curative intent, 
approximately one quarter relapse at distant sites. The prognosis in these cases is poor (Choueiri and 
Motzer 2017). Advanced RCC entails both locally advanced disease that is not amenable to local therapy, 
i.e. curative surgery or radiation therapy, as well as metastatic disease. Advanced RCC thus requires 
systemic treatment. There are currently no approved adjuvant treatments for RCC and observation 
remains the standard of care after nephrectomy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment of choice for localized RCC (Stage I-III) is surgical resection, which is the only curative 
therapy. After nephrectomy, observation remains the standard of care, and no treatment is currently 
approved in the adjuvant setting in the EU.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence for efficacy and safety to support the present extension of indication is the Phase III 
study KEYNOTE-564, an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of adjuvant 
pembrolizumab vs. placebo. The ITT population includes 994 patients (496 in pembrolizumab arm and 
498 in the placebo arm). 
3.2.  Favourable effects  
The primary efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed disease-free-survival (DFS) in the ITT 
population. At the pre-specified interim analysis with a median follow-up time of 23.9 months, the study 
showed a statistically significant improvement in DFS (HR  0.68; 95% CI 0.53, 0.87; p-Value = 0.0010)  
for patients randomised to the pembrolizumab arm compared with placebo.  Median DFS was not reached 
in both arms. The probability of being event free at year 1 and year 2 was 85.7% and 77.3% for 
pembrolizumab vs. 76.2% and 68.1% for placebo. Data were based on 260 events (78% of final 
analyses).  With an additional 6 months of follow up (median duration of follow-up 29.7 months based on 
a data cutoff date of 14-JUN-2021) the HR for DFS was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.80) in the ITT population.  
A clear DFS benefit was observed in patients with high risk of recurrence (MO high) (HR 0.60; 95% CI 
0.33, 1.11) and M1 NED (HR 0.29; 95% CI 0.12, 0.69).  
Regarding OS, in the pre-specified interim analysis the HR was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.96) (p=0.016) and 
the median OS was not reached in either group. With an additional 6 months of follow up (cut-off date 
14-JUN-2021) the HR for OS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.86) in the ITT population.  
For Disease Recurrence-specific Survival the cumulative incidences of the event of interest (local and 
distant recurrence) were lower over time in the pembrolizumab group compared with the placebo group.  
Thirty participants in the pembrolizumab group and 56 participants in placebo group experienced a PFS2 
event (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.81; nominal p-value 0.0018 at IA1), indicating a reduced risk of 
disease progression or death on next-line drug therapy in the pembrolizumab group compared with the 
placebo group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
At the pre-defined data cut-off date 14 DEC 2020 the OS was events were largely immature with 
approximately 26% of the total events. With the updated analyses the OS events passed from 51 to 66 
which is still considered immature but showed a trend in favour of pembrolizumab. Further OS data are 
expected to be submitted as soon as available (REC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidence of AEOSI was higher in the Indication Dataset compared with the RSD with any AEOSI been 
35.5% vs 25.1% and the drug-related AEOSI been 31.8% vs 21.8%, including higher grade 3-5 AEOSI, 
serious AEOSI and AEOSI leading to discontinuation. For half of the participants the AEOSI were not 
resolved or resolved with sequelae at the time of data cutoff. 
The higher rates of AEOSI were confirmed in the pooled safety data for the pembrolizumab adjuvant 
studies in comparison to the dataset in the advanced/metastatic setting (all 36.1% vs 24.2%, drug-
related AEOSI 33.4% vs 20.8%, respectively).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Pembrolizumab showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo in DFS according to investigator 
assessment in the ITT population. Secondary and explorative analyses for OS, DRSS1 and PFS2 are 
overall supportive; but data are still immature with a median follow-up duration of 29.7 months (updated 
analysis). The MAH is recommended to provide updated OS data from study KEYNOTE-564.  
Although the safety profile of pembrolizumab is well established in the metastatic setting, higher 
incidences of AEOSI (including grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs) and higher rates of discontinuations due to AEs were 
observed in the adjuvant treatment compared to the established safety dataset. Long-term toxicities are 
of special clinical relevance in the adjuvant setting and are reflected in the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Updated results provided support for a beneficial treatment effect of pembrolizumab over placebo in the 
adjuvant setting of adults with renal cell carcinoma at increased risk of recurrence. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Keytruda is considered positive.

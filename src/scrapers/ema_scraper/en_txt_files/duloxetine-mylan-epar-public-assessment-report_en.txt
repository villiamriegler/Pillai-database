2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This report concerns the generic application for Duloxetine Mylan for which the originator product was Cymbalta 
30 mg and 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules marketed by Eli Lilly Netherland B.V.  
Duloxetine  is  a  combined  serotonin  (5-HT)  and  noradrenaline  (NA)  reuptake  inhibitor.  It  weakly  inhibits 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238550/2015 
Page 6/24 
 
  
  
 
 
 
dopamine  reuptake  with  no  significant  affinity  for  histaminergic,  dopaminergic,  cholinergic  and  adrenergic 
receptors. Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in various 
brain areas of animals. 
Duloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain and 
attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. The pain inhibitory action of duloxetine is believed to 
be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the central nervous system. 
To support this application Mylan applied for a marketing authorisation for 2 strengths of Duloxetine tablets 
30mg  and  60mg,  conducting  two  way  crossover  comparative  bioavailability  studies  under  fasting  and  fed 
conditions against the reference product. The bio-equivalence studies were conducted with the highest strength 
60 mg Duloxetine hard gastro-resistant capsules versus the Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl) 60 mg gastro-resistant 
capsules. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction

White  ink  (60  mg)  contains:  shellac, propylene glycol,  sodium hydroxide, povidone and titanium dioxide 
(E171 
The  product  is  available  in  PVC/PCTFE  /Al  blisters,  PVC/  PCTFE  /Al  perforated  unit  dose  blisters,  and  HDPE 
bottles.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
Duloxetine hydrochloride is an active substance described in the European Pharmacopoeia 
The chemical name of duloxetine is (3 S)-N-Methyl-3 -(naphthalen- 1 -yloxy)-3 -(thiophen-2- 
yl) propan- 1 -amine hydrochloride and has the following structure: 
The  active  substance  is  a  white  or  almost  white  powder,  no  hygroscopic,  sparingly  soluble  in  water,  freely 
soluble in methanol, practically insoluble in hexane.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238550/2015 
Page 7/24 
 
  
  
 
Duloxetine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 1 chiral centre. Enantiomeric purity is controlled 
routinely. Polymorphism has been observed for active substance and it is controlled during manufacturing. 
As there is a monograph of duloxetine in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active substance 
has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for duloxetine hydrochloride 
which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The active substance specifications adopted by both active substance and finished product manufacturers have 
been  provided  and  the  specifications  include  tests  as  per  current  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  together  with  the 
additional testing specified in the CEP for residual solvents by gas chromatography and test for residual catalyst 
(rhodium) by ICP-MS as mentioned in the CEP and based on the analytical procedures annexed with the CEP. 
The specifications adopted by the finished product manufacturer additionally include testing for particle size, and 
identification of polymorph (PXRD). In-house analytical methods have been satisfactorily validated. 
Batch analysis data (3 production scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is  sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development  
The purpose of the pharmaceutical development studies was to develop a bioequivalent generic version of the 
reference medicinal product Cymbalta. The developed product should be suitable for production scale batches 
and exhibit reproducible results. The product should also demonstrate acceptable stability performance in the 
proposed marketing packaging. 
The following active substance attributes were considered during the development of Duloxetine hard 
gastro-resistant capsules: bulk density, tapped density, particle size, solubility, particle size distribution, 
hygroscopicity and potential isomerism. 
The results indicated very poor to very-very poor flow properties of duloxetine hydrochloride. However, since 
the manufacturing processes of the finished product involves the preparation of drug coated pellets / beads by 
Wurster coating on inert sugar spheres, wherein the active substance is suspended in the coating solvent along 
with other excipients and is sprayed on to the core pellets, the flow properties of the active substance does not 
have any impact on manufacturing process. Solubility studies of the active substance demonstrated that 
duloxetine hydrochloride has pH dependent solubility with maximum solubility at pH 5.5 acetate buffer and is 
highly soluble as per the BCS solubility criteria. According to the particle distribution results, a satisfactory 
particle size limit was proposed. The active substance is slightly hygroscopic and the potential isomerism is 
controlled in line with the Ph Eur monograph. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238550/2015 
Page 8/24 
 
  
  
The excipients selected for the formulation development are based on literature search, compatibility study, 
past experience of developing delayed release capsules dosage form and the qualitative formula of reference 
medicinal product, so as to have an essentially similar generic version of the branded product. 
In order to select suitable excipients for the formulation, an active substance-excipient compatibility study was 
performed. The results of the excipients compatibility studies suggested that there was no significant change in 
physical appearance and related substances. Therefore it was concluded that all the excipients were compatible 
with duloxetine hydrochloride. Hence, these excipients were proposed for the prototype formulation 
development. 
All of the excipients are conventional pharmaceutical ingredients that comply with the requirements of Ph Eur 
with the exception of Opadry clear YS-1R-7006 and empty hard gelatin capsule shells. They are included in the 
formulation at suitable levels and for recognised purposes. Opadry clear YS-1R-7006 and empty hard gelatin 
capsule shells are non-pharmacopoeial proprietary materials supplied to the agreed specifications. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC. 
Two bioequivalence studies were performed using the 60 mg strength in fed and fasting conditions; bio-waiver 
for the 30 mg strength was applied. 
Comparative dissolution profile data in 0.1N hydrochloric acid for 120 minutes followed by pH 6.8 phosphate 
buffer for 120 minutes (official/release media) and pH 4.5 acetate buffer for 120 minutes followed by pH 6.8 
Phosphate buffer for 120 minutes (to simulate fed condition) on both strengths of the generic medicinal product 
and the reference product were provided. The amount of duloxetine released in acid resistance stage after 120 
minutes from all the formulations is not more than 10 % and therefore complies with requirements of dissolution 
test for delayed release formulation as per “Ph. Eur. General chapter –Dissolution test for Solid dosage forms 
(2.9.3)”. For buffer stage (i.e. pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer), the similarity factor (f2 value) was calculated between 
the test product (Duloxetine 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules) and the reference product (Cymbalta 60 mg 
gastro resistant capsules) used in the bio-equivalence study.  
The dissolution profiles of 60 mg strength Test biobatch vs. Reference biobatch, were not similar with the 
proposed QC dissolution method. The applicant justified the discrepancy for the in vitro dissolution data on the 
basis that although, the f2 value between the test and reference product was found to be below 50, these two 
products have been proven to be bioequivalent under both fasting and fed conditions. Therefore, it can be 
concluded that the difference in drug release profile of both strengths does not have any impact on the in vivo 
performance of the product 
The manufacturing process development strategy objective was to design and develop stable and bioequivalent 
generic product of Duloxetine hard gastro-resistant capsules using commonly used excipients and similar to 
reference medicinal product. It was confirmed that there was no difference between the manufacturing process 
used to produce clinical batches and the process of the finished product.  During optimisation of the 
manufacturing process, the drying temperature for drug coated pellets and for enteric coated pellets was 
evaluated. The enteric coating solvent composition was also optimised. The impact of the capsule filling machine 
speed was also evaluated during development.

The primary packaging is is PVC/PCTFE /Al blisters and HDPE bottle pack. The material complies with Ph Eur and 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of 6 main steps: preparation of drug coated pellets / beads, preparation of 
sub coated pellets/beads, preparation of lubricated enteric coated pellets / beads, encapsulation, and packaging. 
The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process is considered adequately validated for the proposed batch sizes for which full process 
validation results have been presented. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
However, as the manufacturing process is considered a non-standard process, process validation on the 
proposed additional larger commercial batch sizes should be successfully completed before product from these 
proposed larger scale batches can be marketed. The applicant committed to validate the commercial batches 
manufactured with the proposed additional batch sizes, as per the proposed validation protocol and the batches 
shall be released in the market only after successful completion of the process validation. The applicant has also 
documented the manufacturer’s experience of similar gastro-resistant formulations and confirmed that the 
same manufacturing equipment used for the validated batches sizes will be used for the larger scale batches. 
This was considered acceptable. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form description, 
identification (HPLC, thin layer chromatography), dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (content 
uniformity), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content (KF), residual solvents (GC), 
microbiological test (Ph Eur), and color identification for capsule shell. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 production scale batches of each strength of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for 36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% 
RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packagings proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, dissolution (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water 
content (KF)  and microbiological test (Ph Eur). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. 
An in-use stability study has been provided for the finished product in HDPE bottles in compliance with the CPMP 
guidance “Note for Guidance on in-use stability testing of human medicinal products”. 3 months data from a 6 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238550/2015 
Page 10/24 
 
  
  
month study show that results are within the proposed specifications. A 3 months in-use shelf-life can be 
granted for the finished product stored in HDPE bottles at the moment.  
In all the stability studies no significant changes and no trends were observed for all the investigated parameters. 
No formation or increase in levels of any degradation product was observed. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
The gelatin in the capsule shell used in the finished product is of animal (bovine) origin. Current EDQM 
Certificates of Suitability are provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided. The 
overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
Reference is made to the SmPC of the reference product Cymbalta. 
Duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which weakly 
inhibits dopamine reuptake and has no significant affinity for histaminergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic or 
adrenergic receptors. Duloxetine dose-dependently increases extracellular levels of serotonin and noradrenaline 
in various brain areas of animals. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Duloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain and 
attenuated pain behaviour in a model of persistent pain. The pain inhibitory action of duloxetine is believed to be 
a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the central nervous system. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238550/2015 
Page 11/24 
 
  
  
The effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of MDD is linked to its inhibition of presynaptic neuron reuptake 
of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system, resulting in elevated levels of serotonin and 
norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft, enhancing monoaminergic neurotransmission. Although no specific animal 
models for MDD are available, the in vivo pharmacodynamic studies provide indirect evidence for the potential 
clinical efficacy of duloxetine.  At therapeutic range, duloxetine is not expected to pose a risk on CNS, smooth 
muscle, renal, immune, or gastrointestinal functions. Substance abuse is unlikely. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Duloxetine is administered as a single enantiomer. Duloxetine is extensively metabolised by oxidative enzymes 
(CYP1A2 and the polymorphic CYP2D6), followed by conjugation. The pharmacokinetics of duloxetine 
demonstrate large inter subject variability (generally 50-60%), partly due to gender, age, smoking status and 
CYP2D6 metaboliser status. 
Absorption  
Duloxetine is well absorbed after oral administration with a Cmax occurring 6 hours post dose. 
The absolute oral bioavailability of duloxetine ranged from 32% to 80% (mean of 50%). Food delays the time to 
reach the peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption 
(approximately 11 %). These changes do not have any clinical significance. 
Distribution 
Duloxetine is approximately 96% bound to human plasma proteins. Duloxetine binds to both albumin and 
alpha-l acid glycoprotein. Protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. 
Biotransformation 
Duloxetine is extensively metabolised and the metabolites are excreted principally in urine. Both cytochromes 
P450-2D6 and 1A2 catalyse the formation of the two major metabolites glucuronide conjugate of 4-hydroxy 
duloxetine and sulphate conjugate of 5-hydroxy 6-methoxy duloxetine. Based upon in vitro studies, the 
circulating metabolites of duloxetine are considered pharmacologically inactive. The pharmacokinetics of 
duloxetine in patients who are poor metabolisers with respect to CYP2D6 has not been specifically investigated. 
Limited data suggest that the plasma levels of duloxetine are higher in these patients. 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of duloxetine ranges from 8 to 17 hours (mean of 12 hours). After an intravenous dose 
the plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 22 l/hr to 46 l/hr (mean of 36 l/hr). After an oral dose the 
apparent plasma clearance of duloxetine ranges from 33 to 261 l/hr (mean 101 l/hr). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Duloxetine hydrochloride has been evaluated in a variety of toxicology studies in laboratory animals and in vitro 
test systems (refer to Cymbalta EPAR). Studies included single-dose toxicity in mice, rats, and dogs; 
repeated-dosetoxicity in mice, rats, and dogs; in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity; carcinogenic potential in mice 
and rats; and reproductive and developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits. All issues of concern are adequately 
dealt with within the summary of product characteristics of the Reference product Cymbalta. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted by the applicant. The applicant justified the lack of an ERA on 
the following grounds:  “given that Duloxetine 30 mg and 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules are aimed at

replacing rather than increasing prescriptions of Cymbalta 30 mg and 60mg hard gastro-resistant capsules, no 
increased environmental burden is envisaged from the licensing of this product.” The CHMP agreed with the 
applicant since the legal basis for registration of Duloxetine Mylan gastro resistant capsules are according to 
article 10.1 (generic) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Thus an Environmental Risk Assessment does not need to be 
submitted in accordance with the guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr I. 
2.3.6.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Duloxetine Mylan from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant has conducted two way crossover comparative bioavailability studies under fasting and fed 
conditions against the reference product. The studies were conducted with the highest strength 60 mg 
Duloxetine hard gastro-resistant capsules versus the innovator’s Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl) 60 mg gelule 
gastro-resistant. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Exemption  
The applicant performed two bioequivalence studies using the 60mg strength fed and fasting, and applied for a 
biowaiver for the 30mg strength. The applicant argued that according to the CHMP Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bio-equivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98-Rev 01 – August 2010), Duloxetine 30 mg hard 
gastro resistant capsules satisfy the conditions for waiver of bioequivalence studies with Duloxetine 60 mg hard 
gastro-resistant capsules as discussed below: 
•  Both the strengths of Duloxetine hard gastro-resistant capsules are manufactured by the same 
manufacturer at the same manufacturing site using similar manufacturing process. 
• 
The qualitative composition of both the strengths i.e. Duloxetine 30 mg and 60 mg hard gastro-resistant 
capsules is the same. 
•  Duloxetine pharmacokinetics is linear “Duloxetine plasma exposure increases in proportion to dose for 
doses up to 60 mg twice a day (Cymbalta TGA PI, 2012)”. The bioequivalence study performed on 
Duloxetine 60mg hard gastro-resistant capsules can therefore be extended to Duloxetine 30mg hard 
gastro-resistant capsules. 
• 
• 
The excipients included in the composition of the formulation are well established and no interaction 
with the pharmacokinetics of the active substance is expected. The Duloxetine 60 mg hard 
gastro-resistant capsules are “scale up” of the Duloxetine 30 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules (the 
ratio of active ingredient to excipients is the same in the two strengths). 
The in vitro test of dissolution characteristics demonstrates that dissolution profiles of Mylan 
Laboratories Limited’s Duloxetine 30 mg and 60 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules are similar. 
Comparative dissolution studies had been provided as required and were properly discussed by the applicant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238550/2015 
Page 13/24 
 
  
  
The comparative dissolution studies between the test 60mg strength and the test 30mg strength were 
considered to be acceptable since the f2 similarity factor is over 50. 
 The claimed biowaiver to the 30mg strength was considered acceptable by CHMP.   
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Study ARL/13/025 Fasting 
Methods 
This was a randomized, balanced, open label, two period, two treatment, two sequence, single dose, crossover, 
comparative oral bioavailability study to establish comparative bioequivalence of  Duloxetine 60 mg hard gastro 
resistant capsules (Mylan Laboratories India) and Cymbalta 60 mg gelule gastro resistante (MAH: Eli Lilly 
Nederland B.V.) in 36 healthy, adult human subjects under fasting conditions. The objective of the study was to 
compare the rate and extent of absorption of both products and to monitor the adverse events to ensure the 
safety and tolerability of a single dose of Duloxetine 60 mg.  
Study design 
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours in both periods each 
volunteer received a single oral dose of Duloxetine 60mg capsule with 240ml of water in period I and either one 
tablet of the reference or test product in period II.  
Subjects were dosed while in sitting posture and were instructed to remain seated in an upright position for the 
first 2 hours following drug administration. Drinking water was not permitted one hour before dosing and until 
one hour post dose. Subjects were confined to the clinical facility from at least 12 hours prior to each drug 
administration until after the 72-hour blood sample collection in each study period. 
The two periods were separated by a wash-out phase of at least 17 days.  
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at  1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 
6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, 36.0, 48.0, and 72.0 hours after dosing.

Test and reference products 
Table 1: Test and Reference Product information  
Population studied   
36 healthy adult male and female (31 males and 5 females) human subjects were enrolled as per the protocol. 
The study started with 36 subjects and 34 completed the study. 
The population studied was considered appropriate and the main inclusion and exclusion criteria - in line with the 
requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01). The 
number of subjects not completing the study would not have an effect on the results as 34 patients are enough 
to power the study.  
With respect to product deviations, one subject was housed 23 minutes later than the protocol stipulated, some 
minor deviations to the blood sample time were observed in a few patients and water spillage upon taking the 
capsule occurred in one patients. These were not deemed to have any effect on the outcome of the study.  
Analytical methods   
Analysis of Duloxetine was performed using test method AMP-090-00 from 25 February to 8 March 2013.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/238550/2015

This Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Method with Tandem mass spectrometry method involved the 
extraction of Duloxetine and the internal standard Duloxetine d5 from human plasma. The samples upon receipt 
from Accutest Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd, Navi Mumbai on 22nd February 2013 were stored in a deep 
freezer under frozen condition at -70 ± 15°C at Bioanalytical lab of CRC from the date of their receipt until they 
were analysed. During transit the temperature was maintained below -55°C. Total Long term plasma stability 
required is 39 days however this has been provided for 71 days.  
1512 blood samples were expected however 1445 were received. 1424 samples (1419 + 5 samples for safety 
evaluation were analysed for the 34 subjects.  
Validation of the test method  
The method has been validated (VR-090-00) in July 2012 and partially revalidated once in August 2012. The 
following parameters were addressed; selectivity and specificity of Duloxetine and the internal standard (IS), 
calibration curve (linearity), carryover test, blank matrix specificity, selectivity and LOQ, recovery of both the 
analyte and the internal standard, precision, accuracy, dilution integrity accuracy and precision, stability of the 
stock solution (short and long term stability in the biological matrix, bench top, freeze-thaw, dry extract, auto 
sampler storage, and short and long term stock solution stability), haemolysis effect accuracy and precision, 
ruggedness (different analyst, column, instrument) and matrix effect. Each parameter has been assessed and 
the limits are justified. This is deem5ed acceptable.  
The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of this method for the estimation of Duloxetine concentrations in plasma 
was 0.401ng/ml (Precision 0.90%, Accuracy 102.24%). The linearity range of Duloxetine was from 0.401g/ml 
to 100.372ng/ml. (9 point curve) 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Primary parameters:  AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax  
Secondary parameters: Tmax, Residual area, Elimination rate constant, AUC0-t /AUC0-inf 
Bioequivalence criteria; Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% confidence interval of geometric mean of 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf between test and reference products fall within the range of 80.00 % to 125.00 % 
for Duloxetine. 
Statistical methods   
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, 
AUC0-t and AUC0-inf an alpha level of 0.05. The analysis of variance model included sequence, subjects nested 
within sequence, period and treatment as factors. Each analysis of variance also included calculation of 
least-square means (LSM’s), adjusted differences between formulation means and the standard errors 
associated with these differences. All effects were tested against the residual error (mean square error) from the 
ANOVA model as the error term. The sequence effect was tested at the 10% level of significance and all other 
main effects were tested at the 5% level of significance against the residual error (mean square error) from the 
ANOVA model as the error term.

Safety data 
Both formulations were well tolerated, with no major side effects and no relevant differences in safety profiles 
were observed between the preparations.  
A total of six adverse events were reported during the study, of which one adverse event was observed in the 
test product treated subjects, one adverse event was observed in the reference product treated subjects and 
four adverse events were observed during the post-study evaluation. As the subjects had received both the 
treatments, it was difficult to attribute the adverse events during Post study evaluation to either of the 
treatments. From the total of six adverse events were reported during the study, one adverse event was 
expected and definitely related, three adverse events were expected and probably related and two adverse 
events were unexpected and unrelated to the study drug. The adverse events were mild in severity and were 
resolved. 
The adverse events were mild in severity and were resolved. One adverse event was observed in the test 
product treated subjects and another was observed in a reference product treated subject. Four adverse events 
were observed during the post-study evaluation.

Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. under fasting conditions.   
Study ARL-13-026 
Methods 
This was a randomized, balanced, open label, two period, two treatment, two sequence, single dose, crossover, 
comparative oral bioavailability study to establish comparative bioequivalence of  Duloxetine 60 mg hard gastro 
resistant capsules (Mylan Laboratories India) and Cymbalta 60 mg gelule gastro resistante (MAH: Eli Lilly 
Nederland B.V.) in 36 healthy, adult male and female human subjects under fed conditions. The objective of the 
study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of both products and to monitor the adverse events to 
ensure the safety and tolerability of a single dose of Duloxetine 60 mg.  
Study design 
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours in both periods all 
subjects were given high fat and high calorie non-vegetarian breakfast of approximately 800-1000 calories 
(27.7% carbohydrate, 16.2% protein and 55.9% fat) 30 minutes prior to dosing. Each volunteer received a 
single oral dose of Duloxetine 60mg capsule with 240ml of water in period I and either one tablet of the 
reference or test product in period II.  
Subjects were dosed while in sitting posture and were instructed to remain seated in an upright position for the 
first 2 hours following drug administration. Drinking water was not permitted one hour before dosing and until 
one hour post dose. At all other times water was given any time. Subjects were confined to the clinical facility 
from at least 12 hours prior to each drug administration until after the 48-hour blood sample collection in each 
study period. 
Standardized meal was given to subjects during check-in night (in such a way to maintain 10 hrs fasting before 
high-fat and high-calorie non-vegetarian breakfast which was started by the subject 30 minutes prior to drug 
administration). 
Standardized meals were provided to the subjects at 4 hours post-dose (12:00 hours, standard lunch), at 9 
hours post-dose (17:00 hours, standard snacks), at 13 hours post-dose (21:00 hours, standard dinner), at 24 
hours post-dose (08:00 hours, standard breakfast), at 28 hours post-dose (12:00 hours, standard lunch), at 33 
hours post-dose (17:00 hours, standard snacks) and at 37bn hours post-dose (21:00 hours, standard dinner) in 
each study period. 
The two periods were separated by a wash-out phase of at least 10 days.  
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at  2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 
10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 16.0, 20.0, 24.0, 36.0, 48.0, and 72.0 hours after dosing.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of duloxetine hard capsule. The reference product Cymbalta is 
indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, and generalised 
anxiety disorder in adults. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate 
summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered 
sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview 
on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with a two way crossover comparative bioavailability design 
under fasting and fed conditions. These were considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and were in line with the respective European requirements.  Choice of dose, sampling points, 
overall sampling time, as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical methods were validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Duloxetine Mylan met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared 
with the reference product. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, 
AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range. Bioequivalence of the two 
formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Duloxetine Mylan in the “Treatment of major depressive disorder. Treatment of diabetic 
peripheral neuropathic pain. Treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. Duloxetine Mylan is indicated in adults. 
For further information see section 5.1.” is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions:

In the EU, at the time of this application, Dengvaxia was indicated for the prevention of dengue disease 
caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 in individuals 9 to 45 years of age with prior dengue 
virus infection and living in endemic areas. The current vaccination schedule consists of 3 injections 6-
month apart. 
At  the  time  of  the  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation,  the  MAH  committed  to  assess  the 
benefit/risk of Dengvaxia in younger populations below 9 years of age once the 2 pivotal efficacy studies, 
CYD14 and CYD15, were completed. As the final results of CYD14 and CYD15 studies became available, 
the MAH performed analyses of new and existing clinical data. Based on the results, the MAH proposed 
an  extension  of  the  age  specified  in  the  indications  to  include  children  6  to  8  years  of  age  dengue 
seropositive at baseline. 
Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Dengue is an acute, systemic viral infection caused by a virus that is transmitted primarily by the Aedes 
aegypti mosquito bites. The infection may be asymptomatic, cause flu-like illness, and can develop into 
a  potentially  lethal  complication  called  severe  dengue  (including  dengue  hemorrhagic  fever 
[DHF]/dengue shock syndrome [DSS]).   
There are 4 types of closely related but antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes (1, 2, 3, and 4). 
Primary  dengue  virus  infection  is  thought  to  provide  lifelong  protection  against  the  infecting  serotype 
and transient cross-protection against heterologous serotypes. Dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue

shock  syndrome  occur  mostly  in  individuals  during  secondary  dengue  virus  infection  with  a  different 
serotype. 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
With this variation, the MAH applied for an extension of the approved indication (SmPC section 4.1) to 
include children 6 to 8 years of age dengue seropositive at baseline: 
Dengvaxia is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 
and 4 in individuals 6 to 45 years of age with prior dengue virus infection and living in endemic areas. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, spreading globally during the past 
30  years  as  a  result  of  changes  in  human  ecology.  The  rapidly  expanding  global  footprint  of  dengue 
inflicts a significant public health, economic and social burden on the populations of endemic areas. Half 
of  the  world's  population  is  now  considered  at  risk  of  infection  by  the  dengue  viruses.  Worldwide,  an 
estimated 390 million dengue infections occur every year, of which around 100 million are associated 
with  clinical  manifestation  of  dengue.  Around  500.000  hospitalizations  are  reported  each  year,  and 
around 20.000 cases result in death. 
Geographical distribution 
Dengue disease is a major public health concern in more than 128 countries, with the four dengue virus 
serotypes found in tropical and sub-tropical regions, including some European territories. 
The terms ‘endemicity’ and ‘hyperendemicity1’ are used to indicate the simultaneous circulation of one 
or  several  Dengue  virus  serotypes,  respectively.  Dengue  epidemiology  varies  across  regions  and 
seasons. An endemic region is defined as a region where cases are present over the majority of time 
during the year. This means that transmission is constantly ongoing. In contrast, an epidemic region is 
a region where cases are only present during a short period of time. Yearly epidemics can happen, or an 
epidemic can happen over several years. 
Dengue is endemic in Asia, the Pacific area, Africa, and Latin America (including the Caribbean). In 2017, 
more than 500.000 dengue cases were reported to the WHO South-East Asia office and in 2019 more 
than 1 million cases were reported to the WHO Western Pacific region main countries for dengue (i.e., 
Australia, Cambodia, Lao Popular Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Viet Nam). 
A  decrease  of  75%  in  number  of  dengue  cases  was  reported  across  the  Americas  in  2017  and  2018, 
compared to 2016. However, the incidence of disease increased again in 2019 with a total of more than 
3 million cases reported for the WHO Americas region. 
After decades of absence in the United States of America (US), dengue has recently emerged with cases 
which were locally acquired.  
Sustained transmission of dengue fever does not naturally occur in continental Europe, though sporadic 
autochthonous dengue cases had been reported in Croatia in 2010 and in France in 2010, 2013, 2014, 
and  2015,  even  if  more  limited.  Dengue,  however,  is  endemic  in  the  overseas  territories  of  some 
European countries such as France (French Guiana, Martinique and Guadeloupe). 
In 2020, dengue continues to affect several countries, with reports of increases in the numbers of cases 
in  Bangladesh,  Brazil,  Cook  Islands,  Ecuador,  India,  Indonesia,  Maldives,  Mauritania,  Mayotte  (Fr), 
1 Trop. Med. Infect. Dis. 2020, 5, 156; doi:10.3390/tropicalmed5040156 
Assessment report

Page 7/116 
 
 
 
 
Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Yemen. 
While  geographical  expansion  of  dengue  and  its  vector  are  evident,  the  true  burden  of  symptomatic 
dengue  disease  is  underestimated.  The  true  numbers  are  probably  far  worse,  since  significant 
underreporting  and  misclassification  of  dengue  cases  have  been  documented.  Constraints  inherent  to 
public health surveillance systems and challenges specific to dengue do not allow dengue cases to be 
fully captured by public health surveillance systems. 
Age and serotype distribution 
In endemic areas, the entire population is at risk of dengue infection. The disease affects all age groups. 
The age distribution of infected individuals varies between countries and no clear pattern of populations 
at risk has been identified. For example, incidence rates were highest in adults in Mexico, Malaysia, and 
in  the  French  Caribbean,  highest  in  adolescents  in  Brazil  and  Thailand,  and  highest  in  children  in  the 
Philippines and Colombia. Additionally, the population at highest risk can shift over time, as was observed 
in Colombia and Thailand over the last decade. 
Dengue epidemiology is dynamic in terms of serotype circulation. The seroprevalence of each serotype 
fluctuates over time. The four dengue virus serotypes are genetically diverse and share limited identity 
(around  60-75%)  at  the  aminoacid  level.  Genetic  variations  between  serotypes  and  clades  may  be 
important determinants of differential viral fitness, virulence and epidemic potential. 
Risk factors for severe dengue  
Epidemiologic studies have identified young age, female sex, high body-mass index, virus strain, and 
genetic  variants  of  the  human  major-histocompatibility-complex  class  I–related  sequence  B  and 
phospholipase C epsilon 1 genes as risk factors for severe dengue.  
Young children in particular may be less able than adults to compensate for capillary leakage and are 
consequently at greater risk of dengue shock.  
Chronic  disease  (bronchial  asthma,  sickle  cell  anaemia  and  diabetes  mellitus)  and  ethnicity  may 
represent additional individual risk factors that determine the severity of disease. 
Secondary infection as risk factor for severe dengue   
Primary  dengue  virus  infection  is  thought  to  provide  lifelong  protection  against  the  infecting  serotype 
and transient cross-protection against heterologous serotypes. Dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue 
shock  syndrome  occur  mostly  in  individuals  during  secondary  dengue  virus  infection  with  a  different 
serotype.  Increased  risk  in  secondary  infection  is  thought  to  be  linked  to  antibody-dependent 
enhancement of virus infection in Fc receptor–bearing cells and the generation of a large infected cell 
mass in vivo The antibody-mediated enhancement of dengue seems to be related with the presence of 
suboptimal neutralizing heterotypic antibodies (that accelerate the rate of internalization of the virus and 
infection of host cells), and may also be related to the presence of memory T cells with low affinity for 
the present infecting virus but high affinity for previous infecting serotype(s). 
Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
Dengue  disease  has  a  wide  and  unpredictable  range  of  clinical  presentations,  from  asymptomatic  to 
severe  diseases.  According  to  CDC,  an  estimated  1  in  4  dengue  virus  infections  are  symptomatic. 
Symptomatic dengue virus infection most commonly presents as a mild to moderate, nonspecific, acute 
febrile illness. Approximately 1 in 20 patients with dengue virus disease progress to develop severe, life-
threatening  disease  called  severe  dengue.  Severe  dengue  is  a  potentially  fatal  complication,  due  to 
plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment. Dengue 
Assessment report

shock syndrome (DSS) is the most severe form of dengue disease and results from hypovolaemia caused 
by vascular leakage. Early clinical findings are nonspecific but require a high index of suspicion because 
recognizing early signs of shock and promptly initiating intensive supportive therapy can reduce risk of 
death among patients with severe dengue to <0.5%. 
Diagnostic methods to confirm dengue virus infection may involve detection of viable virus, viral nucleic 
acid,  peripherally  circulating  viral  antigens  or  host  antibodies,  or  a  combination  of  these  techniques. 
Depending on the time of patient presentation, the application of different diagnostic methods may be 
more  or  less  appropriate.  After  the  onset  of  illness,  dengue  virus  can  be  detected  in  serum,  plasma, 
circulating  blood  cells  and  other  tissues  for  four  to  five  days.  Dengue  infections  may  therefore  be 
diagnosed by detection of viral RNA RT-PCR, or by detection of viral antigens, such as the NS1 antigen 
(by  rapid  tests).  After  day  5,  dengue  viruses  and  antigens  disappear  from  the  blood  and  specific 
antibodies appear, making serology the method of choice for diagnosis. Detection of IgM by ELISA or of 
neutralizing  antibodies  by  PRNT  could,  among  others,  be  used.  It  should  however  be  mentioned  that 
people infected with or vaccinated against other flaviviruses (such as Zika, West Nile, yellow fever, and 
Japanese encephalitis viruses) may produce cross-reactive flavivirus antibodies, yielding false-positive 
serologic dengue diagnostic test results (WHO, CDC, Verhagen 2014). 
Management and prevention 
There is no specific treatment for dengue disease. The management of dengue disease is supportive, 
with rest, control of fever and pain with antipyretics/analgesics, and adequate fluid intake. Supportive 
intensive care and fluid management are the mainstays of therapy for severe disease. 
Up to the end of 2015, the only available prevention of dengue by vector control has proven to be of 
limited success, very difficult to sustain and costly. Vaccination provides a viable and practical alternative 
in disease control measures. The only vaccine currently on the market is Dengvaxia. 
Since the first marketing authorization obtained in Mexico on 8 December 2015, Dengvaxia has been 
licensed in 22 countries in total. However, due to a suspension for the license in the Philippines and the 
non-renewal  in  Malaysia,  at  the  time  of  this  application  the  vaccine  was  registered  by  21  regulatory 
authorities across the world. 
Based  on  EMA’s  CHMP  recommendation,  the  European  Commission  has  granted  the  marketing 
authorization in Europe on 12 December 2018. The prequalification by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) was granted on 25 March 2020.  
Unmet medical need 
Dengvaxia is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 
and 4 in individuals 9 to 45 years of age with prior dengue virus infection and living in endemic areas. 
The MAH proposed to extend the indication to include children 6-8 years of age, as suggested by health 
authorities.  
Similarly  to  adults,  children  experiencing  a  secondary  dengue  infection  have  a  much  higher  risk  of 
developing severe dengue. Children are however at a higher risk of severe dengue. National surveillance 
data  from  Asian  countries  show  that  infants  under  1  year  of  age  and  children  aged  4–9  years  have 
consistently  been  at  the  highest  risk  for  severe  dengue  disease  (Guzman  2002,  Verhagen  2014), 
underlying the need to vaccinate children below 9 yoa.

2.2.  About the product 
CYD  dengue  vaccine  is  a  tetravalent,  recombinant,  live  attenuated  viral  vaccine.  The  viruses  in  the 
vaccine consist of the replicative engine of the attenuated yellow fever vaccine virus 17D (coding for the 
non-structural proteins and capsid), along with the genes coding for the pre-membrane and envelope 
proteins of each of the 4 wild-type dengue serotypes. 
CYD dengue vaccine consists of a sterile, freeze-dried powder formulation that is reconstituted with a 
sodium chloride solution (0.4% for the single-dose presentation, 0.9% for the multi-dose presentation) 
before injection and does not contain any adjuvant or preservative. Each dose contains 4.5-6.0 log-10 
Cell-Culture Infectious Dose 50% (CCID50) per serotype (as per CCDS and EU Product Information).  
After reconstitution, one dose (0.5 mL) is to be administered by the subcutaneous route. 
Compliance with CHMP guidance 
All the clinical studies providing some new data used to update the integrated analyses and support the 
present variation were included in the Dengvaxia RMP. 
This extension of age indication in younger populations below 9 years of age has been considered since 
the time of licensure, when it was agreed with several regulatory authorities that the benefit/risk would 
have to be assessed below 9 years of age once the 2 pivotal efficacy studies had been completed.  
General comments on compliance with GCP guidelines 
All clinical studies evaluating the CYD dengue vaccine comply with the guidelines in force during the CDP, 
such as: the Quality Standards of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, the 
Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  guidelines  for  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP),  EU  Directive 
2001/20/EC, and the EMA guidelines on clinical evaluation of new vaccines. 
Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
At the time of the initial MAA, the MAH aimed at an indication irrespective of age and serostatus (i.e. 
whether a person has had a previous DENV infection before vaccination), based on the data of the pivotal 
trials in endemic regions.  
Data were presented irrespective of serostatus, and analyses stratified by age were performed. At that 
time, it was observed that efficacy (over the initial two years) increased with age, and was inconclusive 
in the youngest 2-5 years of age (YOA) category. Importantly, a harmful effect of CYD dengue vaccine 
(higher  risk  of  hospitalized  dengue  in  children  who  received  CYD  dengue  vaccine  as  compared  to  the 
controls) was detected in the 2-5 years group starting from Year 3 (the first year of long-term follow-up 
[LTFU]). Cumulatively, this translated to an about 20% excess risk of hospitalized dengue over 5 years 
(the  period  for  which  data  were  available  at  that  time)  in  CYD  vaccinated  2-5  years  old  children  vs 
controls.  This  finding  was  not  statistically  significant,  but  it  was  considered  plausible  that  it  actually

reflects the greater proportion of dengue naïve subjects in the youngest group, in whom sensitization to 
severe dengue may occur through mechanisms such as antibody disease enhancement (ADE).  
In additional exploratory pooled stratified analyses in the immunogenicity subset, CYD dengue vaccine 
was  found  poorly  effective  in  subjects  who  are  not  dengue  immune  (i.e.  seronegative  subjects)  at 
baseline. Starting from Years 3, the pattern observed in dengue seronegatives was very similar to the 
pattern found in the youngest children. Although the independent effect of age and baseline serostatus 
on  vaccine  efficacy/safety  could  not  be  determined  robustly  given  the  small  sample  size  of  the 
immunogenicity subset, data tended to suggest that the increased risk of hospitalized dengue associated 
to CYD dengue vaccine during Year 3 was concentrated in dengue non-immune subjects, whatever the 
age.  In  contrast  to  dengue  naïve  subjects,  data  consistently  suggested  high  VE  (approx.  80%)  in 
individuals who have had a past dengue exposure (i.e. seropositive subjects), whatever their age, and 
no safety issue on the long term. It was concluded that in dengue naïve subjects, CYD dengue vaccine 
is a weak primer, which induces immunity of poor quality, rapidly waning, and potentially sensitizing to 
severe dengue. In contrast, for individuals who have experienced at least one dengue virus infection, 
CYD  dengue  vaccine  constitutes  a  booster  of  pre-existing  immunity  which  protects  against  infections 
with new heterologous serotypes. 
The MAH subsequently performed the post hoc NS1 analyses whereby testing on M13 samples were used 
as  a  surrogate  of  past  dengue  exposure.  This  allowed  assessing  efficacy  and  safety  according  to 
serostatus  in  a  larger  population.  These  analyses  confirmed  a  negative  benefit-risk  for  seronegative 
individuals vaccinated with CYD dengue vaccine, whatever their age.  
In this context, at the time of the initial MAA, the MAH proposed an age-based approach for the sought 
indication, considering that with an age range of 9-45 years, a positive benefit-risk would be obtained 
overall in endemic areas (as the proportion of seronegatives would be sufficiently low). Based on post-
hoc  modelling  approaches  (kernel  smoothing  curve)  showing  VE  against  symptomatic  VCD  cases  and 
relative risk against hospitalized VCD cases in studies CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23/57 as a function of age, 
the MAH considered that significant efficacy and the absence of an imbalance in hospitalized VCD and 
hospitalized severe VCD were observed as off 9 years. The proposal of the MAH to restrict the indication 
to children ≥9 YOA whatever the baseline serostatus of the individual has not been considered acceptable 
given that the benefit/risk in the naïve subpopulation remained negative, whatever the age. This lead to 
the current indication, restricted to persons with prior dengue virus infection. Despite that restriction, 
the  MAH  preferred  to  keep  the  lower  age  limit  of  9  years  in  the  indication,  because  of  the  lack  of 
understanding of the independent effect of age. 
During the initial MAA, it was already noted that earlier Phase 1 and 2, and large-scale Phase 3 efficacy 
studies with the CYD dengue vaccine suggested that the vaccine has satisfactory immunogenicity and 
safety profiles in dengue seropositive participants aged 6 to 8 years. The Phase 3 efficacy studies also 
provided  preliminary  evidence  that,  among  dengue  seropositive  participants,  the  vaccine  could  be 
efficacious in preventing virologically-confirmed dengue disease in subjects aged 6 to 8 years. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
Overview of data supporting the present extension of indication 
To support this extension of the age specified in the indications to include children 6 to 8 years of age, 
the MAH presented data from new integrated analyses carried out with the existing overall clinical dataset 
implemented  with  the  new  available  clinical  data.  The  integrated  analyses  of  safety,  immunogenicity, 
Assessment report

and efficacy presented in the initial registration have been updated with new available data: 
1) Final results (long-term follow-up data) of the 2 pivotal efficacy studies CYD14 and CYD15. Data of 5 
years follow-up after the last injection are now available. 
2) Interim results of CYD65, a Phase 2 study that assesses reduced primary vaccination schedules (2-
dose and 1-dose schedules instead of 3-dose schedule) and booster dose in seropositive subjects 9 to 
50  years  of  age  in  the  Philippines  and  Colombia.  Results  up  to  1  year  after  the  primary  vaccination 
schedule and 28 days after the booster injection (given at Year 1) are available. The study is still ongoing. 
3)  Results  of  2  co-administration  studies  (CYD67,  and  CYD71).  These  Phase  3b  studies  assessed  the 
feasibility of co-administration of 2 human papilloma virus vaccines (tetravalent and bivalent) with the 
CYD dengue vaccine in terms of immunogenicity and safety in subjects aged 9 to 13-14 years. 
These last 3 studies (CYD65, CYD67, and CYD71), which included subjects aged above 9 years, allowed 
to increase the clinical database and were used for the comparison of results in subjects aged 6 to 8 
years with those in subjects aged 9 years and above. 
The main features of the new studies included in the integrated analyses are provided below. 
Figure 1: Overview of new studies included in the integrated analyses 
In addition, the extension of the age indication down to children 6 to 8 years of age is supported by the 
NS1 Supplemental Analyses. 
The  presentation  of  immunogenicity  and  efficacy  data  in  the  new  target  population  (6  to  8  years)  is

Efficacy data  
In order to support the extension of the indication to include children 6 to 8 years of age, the integrated 
analyses of efficacy presented in the initial registration have been updated with the final results (long-
term follow-up data) of the 2 pivotal efficacy studies CYD14 and CYD15. Data of 5 years follow-up after 
the last injection have also become available.  
Vaccine efficacy (VE) against symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) cases is presented in 
seropositive children 6 to 8 years of age, during the Active Phase, and during the surveillance expansion 
phase (SEP). Seropositive subjects aged 9 to 16 years are also presented as a benchmark, along with 
seropositive subjects aged 2 to 5 years in order to provide some perspective on VE in the younger age 
group.  Finally,  VE  is  also  presented  in  seropositive  subjects  aged  6  to  16  years  to  provide  a 
comprehensive overview of efficacy. 
Table 1: Number of seropositive subjects considered for the assessment of efficacy 
(Immunogenicity Subset) in the CYD dengue vaccine and Placebo groups  
In addition, the extension of indications to children 6 to 8 years of age is supported by the results of the 
NS1 Supplemental Analyses. 
The  actual  numbers  of  subjects  aged  6  to  8  years  considered  for  the  assessment  of  efficacy  of  the 
vaccine, supporting the extension of age indication, are presented in Table 1. The number of subjects in 
the  age  groups  2  to  5  years  and  9  to  17  years  is  also  presented  when  the  comparison  to  these  age 
groups was used in the analyses. 
Dengue  seropositivity  was  defined  as  a  neutralizing  Ab  level  ≥  10  1/dil  against  at  least  one  dengue 
serotype before the first injection, measured by PRNT50.  
The efficacy of the CYD dengue vaccine was also assessed in 236 baseline dengue seropositive subjects 
aged  6  to  8  years  (169  subjects  in  CYD14  and  67  subjects  in  CYD23)  who  received  the  CYD  dengue 
vaccine and 126 baseline dengue seropositive subjects aged 6 to 8 years (88 subjects in CYD14 and 38 
subjects in CYD23) who received the placebo. 
In addition, the NS1 Supplemental Analyses was used to impute the dengue serostatus at baseline in 
order to increase the precision of the vaccine efficacy and long-term safety assessments. 
The CHMP noted that, to support this extension indication to younger age groups, the MAH presented 
integrated analyses of efficacy updated with the final results of CYD14 and CYD15 for which data of 5 
years follow-up after the last dose are now available. Integrated analyses of efficacy include subjects 
aged  2 to 16 years from the Phase  3  efficacy trials (CYD14, 2-14 years and  CYD15, 9-16 years) and 
from the Phase 2b PoC (CYD23, 4-11 years) trial. The MAH presented efficacy data in the new target 
population  of  the  claimed  indication  (children  6  to  8  years),  which  are  mainly  data  from  CYD14  (and 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 13/116 
 
 
 
 
limited data from CYD23). The MAH presented efficacy data in children 9-16 years (CYD14 and CYD15) 
and 2-5 years (CYD14 mainly), as a benchmark and to update results from the prior submission. Data 
in the overall population 6-16 years (i.e. all available efficacy data supporting the new indication) are 
also presented. 
As the indication is limited to subjects with prior dengue virus infection, the efficacy analyses focused on 
seropositive  subjects.  Therefore,  these  analyses  are  limited  to  subjects  for  whom  baseline  serostatus 
data are available (Immunogenicity Subset).  
Dengue  seropositivity  was  defined  as  a  neutralizing  Ab  level  ≥  10  1/dil  against  at  least  one  dengue 
serotype before the first injection, measured by PRNT50. The MAH approach was considered acceptable 
given  the  already  low  number  of  subjects  in  the  subset,  and  considering  that  biases  (if  any)  are  not 
expected to lead to overestimation of VE. In contrast, there could be non-differential misclassification, 
leading  to  underestimation  of  VE  (dilution).  In  addition,  the  NS1  Supplemental  analyses  considered 
PRNT90. 
The NS1 Supplemental Analyses performed in the same studies are also presented as supportive data, 
as this allowed an assessment on a larger number of subjects. 
A similar approach (analyses in the Immunogenicity Subset, supported by NS1 Supplemental Analyses) 
was used to assess the effect of Dengvaxia over the longer term, during the Hospital Phase and over the 
entire study period (effect on dengue, hospitalised dengue and severe dengue). This was considered as 
safety  analysis  by  the  MAH  (instead  of  efficacy).  This  distinction  between  efficacy  and  safety  data  is 
considered artificial, but reflects the initial design of the studies (see below). Long-term safety/efficacy 
data analyses are presented in the safety but discussed together with the efficacy data in the efficacy 
section. 
Design of the (three) Efficacy Studies 
The  CYD  dengue  vaccine  development  program  included  2  pivotal  large-scale  randomised  placebo-
controlled Phase III efficacy studies: CYD14 and CYD15, conducted in endemic countries. 
CYD14  randomized  10,275  children  2  to  14  years  (6851  CYD  dengue  vaccine  vs.  3424  placebo)  in 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Viet Nam. 
CYD15 randomized N=20,869: children 9 to 16 years (13,920 CYD dengue vaccine vs 6949 placebo) in 
Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Puerto Rico. 
Both studies lasted approximately 6 years including an active surveillance phase (i.e. from M0 to M25) 
to  mainly  assess  vaccine  efficacy  (VE)  and  a  hospital  phase  (i.e.  M25  to  M72),  for  detection  of 
hospitalized cases with follow-up for an additional 4 years (i.e. ‘long term follow-up’ [LTFU]).  
An active surveillance system (i.e. ‘surveillance expansion phase’ [SEP]) was reinstituted in both studies 
after  the  detection  of  a  safety  signal  in  study  CYD14  to  better  monitor  VE  and  safety,  covering 
approximately the last 2 years of the planned follow-up period. 
The overall design and important timelines of CYD14 and CYD15 are presented Figure 2.

Figure 2: Outline of CYD14 and CYD15 Study Design and Timelines   
The third study, Study CYD23 was a Phase IIb efficacy study conducted in Thailand among children 4 to 
11 years with a similar study design. Active surveillance (Active Phase) was performed during the first 
2 years of the study. Subjects from study CYD23 were then followed in a hospital surveillance in CYD57 
for 4 years. However, no SEP was instituted as this study was finalized at the time the safety signal in 
study CYD14 was detected. As a Proof of Concept (PoC) study, the sample size in CYD23 was smaller 
than  in  CYD14  and  CYD15.  In  addition,  there  were  slight  differences  in  dengue  cases  definitions  and 
laboratory methods and testing algorithm. 
The primary objective of the efficacy studies was to assess the efficacy of the CYD dengue vaccine after 
3 injections administered 6 months apart in preventing the occurrence of symptomatic VCD cases due 
to any of the 4 serotypes. For the primary endpoint, the incidence of symptomatic VCD cases occurring 
> 28 days after the third injection was compared to the Control Group. 
Briefly, the 2 Phase III efficacy studies (CYD14 and CYD15) were essentially identical in terms of study 
design,  vaccine  formulation  and  schedule,  objectives,  definition  of  endpoints,  power  and  targeted  VE 
assumptions.  The  CYD23  differed  from  Phase  III  efficacy  studies,  as  it  was  a  PoC  study  designed  to 
assess  preliminary  proof  of  efficacy,  in  a  restricted  geographic  coverage  (mono-centric  mono-country 
study), and with a different algorithm used for defining a VCD case. 
In these three efficacy studies, dengue baseline serostatus was assessed in an Immunogenicity Subset 
corresponding  to  approximately  7.5%  (N=300),  10%  (N=2000),  and  20%  (N=2000)  of  study 
participants in CYD23, CYD15, and CYD14, respectively. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  studies  were  similar  in  terms  of  study  design.  CYD14  and  CYD15  used  the 
same  endpoints  definitions.  The  CYD23  used  a  slightly  different  dengue  cases  definition,  laboratory 
methods and testing algorithm (see below).  
Objectives 
The  main  objectives  and  endpoints  presented  in  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  considered  for  the 
assessments are described below. They are analogous to those considered for the efficacy assessments 
in the NS1 Supplemental Analyses. The statistical criteria for assessment of VE on the Immunogenicity 
Subset were consistent with criteria previously used in the Integrated Efficacy Analysis Report.

The CHMP noted that the main objectives of the efficacy analyses performed to support this extension 
of  indication  are  similar  in  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  and  the  NS1  Supplemental  analyses  and 
consistent with the previous Integrated Efficacy Analyses. Efficacy was assessed in dengue seropositive 
subjects aged 2-5 years (not mentioned in the objectives described by the MAH although the analyses 
were done), 6 to 8 years and 9 to 16 years, and 6 to 16 years during the whole Active Phase (M0-M25) 
and the Surveillance Expansion Phase (SEP) from the time of consent until the end of the study.  
Efficacy was assessed in preventing the occurrence of VCD due to any serotype and to each serotype. 
Efficacy in preventing HDCV and SVCD (as per IDMC definition) was also assessed. 
Endpoints 
Main endpoints and definitions relevant to the above-described objectives were as follows: 
Symptomatic VCD cases due to each or any serotype occurring: 
•  During the Active Phase, after at least one injection; i.e, occurring after the first injection until the 
end of the Active Phase. 
•  During the SEP; i.e. from date of subject reconsent to enter in the SEP until the end of the study, 
after at least one injection (only for CYD14 and CYD15, since no SEP was implemented in CYD23/57). 
SVCD (IDMC) and HVCD cases due to any serotype occurring: 
•  During the Active Phase. 
•  During the SEP (only for CYD14 and CYD15).

NS1 Supplemental Analyses 
In  the  three  efficacy  studies,  dengue  baseline  serostatus  was  assessed  in  an  Immunogenicity  Subset 
corresponding  to  approximately  7.5%,  10%,  and  20%  of  study  participants  in  CYD23,  CYD15,  and 
CYD14, respectively. Baseline serostatus of the other participants could not be determined as no samples 
had been collected at baseline (M0), limiting the precision of efficacy estimates. 
In order to improve precision of VE estimates by increasing the size of the population assessed, Sanofi 
Pasteur leveraged a dengue anti-nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
to test samples collected from each participant at Month 13 (M13; i.e. 1 month after the third vaccine 
dose). Blood samples from M13 were available from almost all individuals as per study design; however, 
they could not be analyzed with the traditional PRNT assay used to assess serostatus at baseline since 
it  is  largely  affected  by  the  vaccine  and  could  not  distinguish  between  vaccination  and  prior  dengue 
infection. 
The  NS1  assay  allows  differentiating  anti-NS1  antibodies  induced  by  wild-type  dengue  infection  from 
those  induced  by  vaccination  (since  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  contains  genes  encoding  NS1  from  the 
yellow  fever  17D  vaccine  virus  rather  than  from  dengue  virus);  therefore,  it  could  be  used  to  infer 
participants’ baseline dengue serostatus. 
The NS1 Supplemental Analyses were based on a case-cohort design to obtain efficacy and risk estimates 
according to dengue serostatus.  
Definition of the Case-Cohort 
The case-cohort design in the NS1 Supplemental Study, based on the approach introduced by Prentice 
(Prentice  RL.  A  case-cohort  design  for  epidemiologic  cohort  studies  and  disease  prevention  trials. 
Biometrika. 1986;73(1):1-11.), where, a random sample of subjects, referred to as the sub-cohort, was 
first chosen from the entire study population. Subjects with the event of interest but not selected in the 
sub-cohort were then included in the case-cohort analysis. 
The sub-cohort included a random selection of approximately 10% of the entire study cohorts of CYD14, 
CYD15, and CYD23/57 after stratifying for age and trial site, ie approximately 3500 subjects.  
The cases, corresponding to all events of interest (whether included or not in the sub-cohort), were all 
symptomatic VCD which occurred in CYD14, CYD15, and CYD23/57 during the Active Phase or in CYD14 
and  CYD15  during  the  SEP,  and  all  HVCD  and  SVCD  until  the  end  of  each  study,  depending  on  the 
analysis.  
Subjects from CYD23/57 were included in the sub-cohort. However, VCD cases from that study were not 
included in efficacy assessments in the NS1 Supplemental Analyses as consent from these subjects could 
not be obtained. 
The case-cohort included individuals from the sub-cohort (with  or without VCD cases) plus remaining 
individuals with VCD events. The case-cohort design is represented in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Diagrammatic representation of case-cohort design 
The CHMP noted that, given that the majority of study participants had no pre-vaccination blood sample, 
the MAH developed an approach to indirectly assess baseline serostatus by testing M13 samples (i.e. 1 
month after the third vaccine dose), which were taken in all subjects. PRNT assay could not be used as 
it is not able to distinguish immunity induced by vaccination and prior dengue infection. Therefore, the 
MAH developed a dengue anti-nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA).  This  NS1  assay  aims  at  differentiating  anti-NS1  antibodies  induced  by  wild-type  dengue 
infection from those induced by vaccination (since the CYD dengue vaccine contains genes encoding NS1 
from the yellow fever 17D vaccine virus rather than from dengue virus).  
This  led  to  the  NS1  Supplemental  Analyses,  which  confirmed  the  safety  issue  in  seronegatives  (see 
previous  assessments).  The  NS1  Supplemental  Analyses  aimed  at  obtaining  efficacy  and  relative  risk 
estimates according to dengue serostatus in the efficacy trials. 
A case-cohort design was used. A sample of subjects, referred to as the sub-cohort, was first selected 
randomly  from  the  entire  study  cohorts  of  CYD14,  CYD15,  and  CYD23/57.  Subjects  with  an  event  of 
interest (VCD, HVCD and SVCD) but not selected in the sub-cohort were then included in the case-cohort 
analysis. Approximately 10% of the total cohort were included. Subjects from CYD23/57 were included 
in the sub-cohort, but in the end, this study is not part of the NS1 Supplemental Analyses, as retesting 
of the samples was not allowed as per ICF. 
The case-cohort design is a specific type of case-control design where the cases are the same cases as 
would be included in a cohort study, and controls consist of a random sample selected from the entire 
source population that gives rise to the cases (i.e. the full cohort). The sample must be representative 
of the population giving rise to cases (the source population). Such design allows for the estimation of 
risk ratios (i.e. when the sample is randomly selected from the source population the risk ratio computed 
using  the  sample  equals  the  risk  ratio  computed  within  the  entire  cohorts).  An  advantage  of  a  case-
cohort  study  is  that  the  same  random  sub-cohort  can  be  used  as  the  comparison  group  for  studying 
different endpoints, rather than identifying a new set of controls for each endpoint. The CHMP considered 
that the case-cohort design is thus particularly well suited for the present study. In addition, this design 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 18/116 
 
 
 
 
is much more efficient than the corresponding cohort design, as a sample  much smaller than the full 
cohort  generally  results  in  only  a  marginal  loss  in  statistical  power  (the  statistical  power  is  mostly 
determined by the number of subjects with the event).  
Classification of cases: 
Four statistical approaches were used to assess serostatus, and therefore to classify subjects as dengue 
seropositive or seronegative. 
These  analyses  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  NS1  Supplemental  Analyses),  primarily  used  2  different 
approaches: 
MI PRNT50 M0: PRNT50 results either measured or imputed: PRNT50 results at Month 0, either measured 
(for subjects included in the Immunogenicity Subset) or predicted (multiple imputation of PRNT50) based 
on  anti-NS1  values  at  M13  and  covariates  such  as  age,  sex,  country,  and  treatment  group  using  a 
multiple imputation model (for subjects not included in the Immunogenicity Subset for whom baseline 
serostatus  data  were  not  available).  Imputation  of  PRNT50  serostatus  was  undertaken  by  a  logistic 
regression for the MI method. 
Anti-NS1 antibody titer at M13 using a cut-off threshold of ≥ 9 EU/mL (NS1 [Thr9] M13): NS1 (Thr9) 
M13: measured M13 anti-NS1 titers with cut-off thresholds ≥ 9 (EU)/mL. 
In  addition,  2  other  approaches  to  determine  participant’s  baseline  dengue  serostatus  were  used  to 
assess VE during the active surveillance phase and during the SEP. These analyses were conducted to 
increase  the  specificity  (i.e.  to  reduce  the  number  of  participants  wrongly  classified  as  baseline 
seropositive) and therefore, to improve assessment of vaccine performance, particularly in the younger 
population: 
MI PRNT90 M0: PRNT90 results either measured or imputed: PRNT90 results at Month 0, either measured 
(for  subjects  included  in  the  Immunogenicity  Subset)  or  predicted  using  a  multiple  imputation  model 
(for subjects not included in the Immunogenicity Subset for whom baseline data were not available). 
Anti-NS1 antibody titer at M13 using a cut-off threshold ≥ 50 EU/mL (NS1 [Thr50] M13): NS1 (Thr50) 
M13: measured M13 anti-NS1 titers with cut-off thresholds ≥ 50 (EU)/mL. 
NS1 Supplemental Analyses consisted of a series or 3 consecutive analyses/reports (CSRs), so called, 
by  order:  NS1  original,  NS1  Extended,  and  NS1  Close-out.  In  this  document,  the  NS1  Supplemental 
Analyses refers mainly to the NS1 Close-out report to gather the most comprehensive dataset. 
The  accuracy  of  the  imputation  approach  was  evaluated  using  cross-validation  by  comparing  the 
predicted baseline serostatus with observed baseline serostatus in the Immunogenicity Subset, for both 
PRNT50 and PRNT90. 
Approaches used in the NS1 Supplemental Analyses to classify subjects as dengue seropositive: 
The CHMP noted that four approaches were used in the NS1 Supplemental Analyses to classify subjects 
as dengue seropositive or seronegative at baseline.  
Two approaches were referred as ‘primary’. The first one (MI PRNT50 M0) used PRNT50 results at Month 
0,  either  measured  (for  subjects  included  in  the  Immunogenicity  Subset)  or  predicted  by  a  multiple 
imputation model based on anti-NS1 ELISA values at M13 and covariates (for subjects not included in 
the  Immunogenicity  Subset).  The  second  (NS1  [Thr9]  M13)  used  measured  anti-NS1  ELISA  antibody 
titers at M13 with a threshold of ≥ 9 (EU)/mL. These two methods were used in the previously presented 
NS1 Supplemental Analyses, and in particular to explore the safety issue in seronegative individuals.  
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 19/116 
 
 
 
Two additional approaches were used: PRNT90 results at Month 0 (MI PRNT90 M0) either measured or 
imputed  (similar  as  the  approach  for  PRNT50)  and  anti-NS1  antibody  titers  measured  at  M13  (NS1 
[Thr50] M13) with a thresholds of ≥ 50 (EU)/mL. These two additional methods are more appropriate in 
the present context, as by using more specific assays, they limit the probability of naïve subjects being 
wrongly  classified  as  baseline  seropositive.  Although  these  methods  are  more  adequate  for  correctly 
identifying those previously exposed to dengue, the real false positive rate remains uncertain.  
Dengue anti-NS1 IgG ELISA assay: 
The CHMP acknowledged that the dengue NS1 IgG ELISA assay, originally developed by University of 
Pittsburg  (Pittsburg,  PA,  USA)  was  optimized  by  Sanofi  Pasteur's  Global  Clinical  Immunology  (GCI) 
Department. This assay measures total IgG antibodies against the NS1 protein of the four dengue virus 
serotypes by ELISA. Due to the lack of standardised methods to assess the performance of assays (in 
particular the lack of reference samples, or criteria for the selection of reference samples), specificity 
and  sensitivity  of  the  assay  are  considered  uncertain.  Moreover,  the  time  since  infection  and  the 
epidemiological context influence sensitivity and specificity. Specificity is expected to be influenced by 
the circulation of other flaviviruses, as dengue IgG ELISA assays commonly present cross-reactivity with 
other flaviviruses. According to published data and data presented previously by the MAH, there is low 
cross-reactivity  when  subjects  were  previously  vaccinated  with  JEV  or  YFV,  and  noticeable  cross-
reactivity for subjects previously infected with ZIKV or West Nile virus (WNV) (Nascimento EJM et al. 
Development  of  an  anti-Dengue  NS1  IgG  ELISA  to  Evaluate  Exposure  to  Dengue  Virus,  Journal  of 
Virological Methods, 2010). Regarding the potential interference of dengue NS1-specific IgG to Zika, it 
has  to  be  noted  that  assessment  of  dengue  serostatus  was  performed  on  M13  blood  samples,  which 
were taken before Zika epidemics in Latin America, so with no impact on the results. It is unclear how 
the  circulation  of  various  flaviviruses  could  have  influenced  the  NS1  study  results  according  the  local 
epidemiology (such as tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Usutu, and Ilheus virus a flavivirus circulating in 
Latin America). 
The vaccine contains NS1 genes from the YF virus. Therefore, the Dengue anti-NS1 IgG ELISA assay is 
theoretically adequate to differentiate immunity induced by CYD vaccination from that induced by natural 
dengue infection, and previous exposure to CYD Dengue Vaccine was not expected to induce meaningful 
levels of antibody against the dengue NS1 protein. However, in the original NS1 Supplemental study, an 
influence  of  CYD  vaccination  on  the  read-out  was  observed.  To  address  the  potential  differential 
misclassification bias associated with CYD effect on anti-NS1 readout at M13, the MAH used the baseline 
(M0)  PRNT50  dengue  antibody  values,  either  measured  or  predicted  (when  measured  value  not 
available). The prediction was based on a model which used Dengue anti-NS1 ELISA values at M13 and 
other covariates such as age, sex, country, indicator of whether subject had VCD between M0 and M13, 
time between onset of VCD case and M13 sample collection date, and treatment group as predictors. 
The model used for the imputation was fitted in the immunogenicity subset using baseline serostatus 
(negative or positive) as dependent variable. Prediction of M0 PRNT50 was undertaken using multiple 
imputation (MI) and SuperLearner methods. 
Statistical methods 
Vaccine  efficacy  results  were  presented  for  both  Immunogenicity  Subset  and  NS1  Supplemental 
Analyses. The results presented include the following age groups in support to the claimed indication: 9 
to 16 years, 6 to 8 years, and 6 to 16 years. For subjects aged 6 to 8 years, analyses of VE against VCD 
cases due to any serotype are presented along with those for the 2 to 5 years age group in order to 
provide some perspective on VE in the younger age group.

Results from the Immunogenicity Subset include data from all 3 efficacy studies. Individual estimates 
for the 2 pivotal efficacy studies CYD14 and CYD15 and the integrated estimate from the pooled analysis 
of CYD14 + CYD15 are presented. As the outcome measures for efficacy were identical and the results 
from  the  2  Phase  III  efficacy  studies  were  highly  consistent  across  studies,  the  integrated  efficacy 
analysis  estimates  are  considered  as  robust  data  supporting  results  from  individual  studies.  A  Cox 
regression model including the study-by-group interaction was used to test heterogeneity and showed 
that results were consistent. The individual estimate for proof-of-concept study CYD23 and the integrated 
estimate from the pooled analysis on CYD14 + CYD15 + CYD23 or CYD14 +CYD23 are also provided as 
supportive  data.  The  same  statistical  methodology  was  used  to  assess  VE  against  symptomatic  VCD 
cases,  HVCD  cases,  and  SVCD  cases  during  both  the  Active  Phase  and  the  SEP.  VE  estimates  are 
considered conclusive when the lower bound of the CI is above 0. 
The NS1-related analyses presented in this document were based on those included in NS1 Close-out 
Report.  They  are  fully  aligned  with  the  ones  used  for  the  Immunogenicity  Subset,  with  the  following 
specifications: 
•  MI  PRNT50  M0  and  MI  PRNT90  M0  methods  included  all  cases  from  M0  to  M25  during  the  Active 
Phase and allowed estimating VE during the whole Active Phase (D0-M25). 
•  NS1 (Thr9) M13 and NS1 (Thr50) M13 methods excluded VCD cases from M0 to M13. The methods 
allowed estimating VE from PD3 until the end of Active Phase (M13-M25). 
•  Results from the NS1 Supplemental Analyses only include results from the Phase III efficacy trials 
(CYD14 and CYD15). Data on CYD23 are not included because future testing of samples collected 
for purposes unrelated to the study objectives was more restrictive in that study; therefore, retest 
of samples for objectives related to VE against symptomatic VCD was not possible. 
Impact of occurrence of dengue infection prior to M13: 
The CHMP noted that subjects naïve at baseline and who presented a dengue episode between M0 and 
M13 were classified as seropositives by the anti-NS1 readout at M13.  
Therefore, the evaluation of efficacy was performed from PD3 until the end of Active Phase (M13-M25) 
(excluding the events between M0-M13) for the NS1 (Thr9) M13 and NS1 (Thr50) M13 methods. 
For the MI PRNT50/90 M0 methods, VE was estimated over the whole Active Phase (D0-M25). The CHMP 
considered that relying on predicted/imputed M0 PRNT50/90 as a surrogate of prior exposure to dengue 
was  likely  to  minimise  the  differential  biases  as  compared  with  M13  anti-NS1  readouts,  especially 
because the model included as predictor an indicator of whether the subject had VCD between M0 and 
M13. It is unclear to what extent the bias was corrected, and in addition, the approach was not able to 
address misclassification of asymptomatic infection occurring between M0 and M13. 
VE Calculation for analysis of individual studies 
VE = 100* [1- (PCYD / PP)] = 100* [1-((CCYD / NCYD) / (CP / NP))] 
where: 
PCYD is the density incidence of dengue in the CYD dengue vaccine Group 
PP is the density incidence of dengue in the Control Group 
• 
• 
•  CCYD is the number of VCD cases in the CYD dengue vaccine Group 
•  NCYD is the number of person-year in the CYD dengue vaccine Group 
•  CP is the number of VCD cases in the Control Group 
•  NP is the number of person-years in the Control Group 
Person-years are the sum of individual units of time (years) for which the subjects contributed to the 
analysis. This is equal to the person-time at risk divided by 365.25. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 21/116 
 
 
 
For subjects with several episodes of dengue, only the first episode of VCD occurring more than 28 days 
after the third injection was included in the analysis of VE. 
The following statistics were provided: number of VCD cases, number of person-years at risk, density 
incidence and 95%  CI, VE and  95%  CI. CIs  for the single  proportion were calculated  using the  exact 
binomial method (Clopper-Person method, quoted by Newcombe. CIs for VE were calculated using the 
Exact method described by Breslow & Day. 
VE was assessed for a given timepoint and time period, depending on the objective. In addition to VE, 
the density incidence of VCD cases were calculated according to severity for each or any serotype 28 
days after each injection (to the end of the Active Phase), from at least 1 injection (from D0) to the end 
of Active Phase and from the start of the SEP to the end of the trial (SEP). 
RR was defined as the ratio of annualized density incidences in the CYD dengue vaccine Group to the 
Control Group. 
VE Calculation for analysis of pooled studies 
VE = 100* [1- (Hazard Ratio)] 
The Hazard Ratio was obtained using a Cox regression model which included, in addition to treatment 
group, the study and study-by-group interactions as fixed effects. The Cox regression model was used 
to calculate the VE (Hazard Ratio reduction) and the 95% CI. The 95% CI of HR and p-value associated 
with Wald-type test statistic was calculated using the variance estimator by Barlow. 
VE Calculation in the NS1 Supplemental Analyses 
The VE was estimated using a modified Cox regression model proposed by Prentice. The Prentice model, 
including the vaccine group as covariate, was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR). The 95% CI of HR 
and  p-value  associated  with  Wald-type  test  statistic  was  calculated  using  the  variance  estimator  by 
Barlow. 
Vaccine efficacy estimates against HVCD and SVCD cases were obtained from ‘hazard ratio’ estimates 
analyzed as part of the safety assessment. The relation between a VE estimate and the corresponding 
hazard ratio is VE = 100*(1 - Hazard Ratio). 
Hazard  ratios  for  HVCD  and  SVCD  disease  were  estimated  based  on  each  serostatus  classification 
approach over the Entire Study period (i.e. from either M0 or M13 until the end of the study), by time 
period  (i.e.  Active  Phase,  Year  1  of  Hospital  Phase,  Year  2  of  Hospital  Phase,  and  Beyond  Year  2  of 
Hospital Phase), and by study phase (i.e. Active Phase, Hospital Phase, and SEP). 
VE estimates against HVCD and SVCD cases over the Active Phase were calculated using analyses by 
time  period.  VE  estimates  over  the  SEP  were  calculated  using  analyses  by  study  phase.  A  Cox 
proportional  hazard  model  with  time-dependent  explanatory  variables  was  used,  with  interactions 
between treatment group and time period or study phase introduced in the model. 
Handling of Missing Data 
Febrile episodes without virological confirmation were not considered in the analysis of VCD cases. No 
test or search for outliers was performed. 
VCD cases: 
• 
If the NS1 test was positive and the DS dengue RT-PCR was missing (or, the other way around) for 
the same fever episode, the episode was considered as a VCD case. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 22/116 
 
 
 
 
• 
If the NS1 test was missing and the DS dengue RT-PCR was negative or missing (or, the other way 
around) for the same fever episode, the episode was not considered as a VCD case. 
The CHMP noted that Vaccine Efficacy results were presented by age category in seropositive subjects, 
for both Immunogenicity Subset and NS1 Supplemental Analyses. VE analyses are presented in the new 
target  age  category  (6  to  8  years)  and  also  for  subjects  aged  9  to  16  years  (benchmark)  and  2  to 5 
years age group, to provide a comprehensive view of efficacy in baseline seropositive subjects. 
Data were provided by study and pooled for CYD14 and CYD15. The CYD23 data and the pooled analysis 
on CYD14 + CYD15 + CYD23 or CYD14 +CYD23 are also provided as supportive data. As the endpoints 
were similar and the results from the 2 Phase 3 efficacy studies were highly consistent across studies, 
the integrated efficacy analysis estimates are considered robust.  
CYD23/57 was not included in the NS1 Supplemental Analyses (as consent from these subjects could 
not be obtained for retesting). 
The MAH described general methods for the estimation of efficacy in the Immunogenicity Subset. In the 
individual studies, incidence densities were estimated for each group, for the Active Phase and the SEP. 
For subjects with several episodes, only the first episode of VCD was included in the analysis of VE. VE 
was calculated using the incidence densities. In the pooled analyses, VE was calculated as the Hazard 
Ratio (HR) reduction using the HR obtained with a Cox regression model which included, in addition to 
treatment group, the study and study-by-group interactions.  
In  the  NS1  Supplemental  Analyses,  VE  was  estimated  by  using  HR  estimated  with  a  modified  Cox 
regression model proposed by Prentice.  
VE estimates are considered conclusive when the lower bound of the CI is above 0. 
A  similar  approach  was  used  for  safety  by  computing  RR  defined  as  the  ratio  of  annualized  density 
incidences (individual studies), or HRs (pooled analyses and NS1 Supplemental Analyses). RRs for HVCD 
and SVCD were estimated over the Entire Study period (i.e. from either M0 or M13 until the end of the 
study), by time period (i.e. Active Phase, Year 1 of Hospital Phase, Year 2 of Hospital Phase, and Beyond 
Year 2 of Hospital Phase), and by study phase (i.e. Active Phase, Hospital Phase, and SEP). 
Vaccine  efficacy  estimates  against  HVCD  and  SVCD  (Active  Phase  and  SEP)  were  obtained  from  HR 
estimates analyzed as part of the safety assessment.  
Definition of the Study Populations 
Statistical populations from the individual studies were clinically similar, therefore, the statistical analysis 
sets were transposed for the integrated analysis. 
For both safety and efficacy analyses, the FASE from the source trials or subsets of it were utilized. 
Full Analysis Set for Efficacy (FASE) 
The FASE comprises all subjects who received at least one injection of vaccine or placebo. 
Full Analysis Set of Immunogenicity (FASI) 
The  FASI  included  all  subjects  in  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  of  each  trial  who  received  at  least  one 
injection and who had a blood sample drawn and a result available after this injection. 
This analysis set was used to describe the efficacy according to baseline dengue serostatus during the 
Active Phase (D0-M25) in the Immunogenicity Subset. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 23/116 
 
 
 
 
Full Analysis Set for Surveillance Expansion Period (FASSEP) 
The  FASSEP  comprises  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  injection  and  who  signed  the  SEP  inform 
consent. This analysis set was used for VE calculation during the SEP. 
This analysis set was used to describe the efficacy according to baseline dengue serostatus during the 
SEP in the Immunogenicity Subset. 
The  CHMP  noted  that,  for  the  efficacy  assessments  in  the  Immunogenicity  Subset,  the  populations 
analysed consist of baseline seropositive subjects from the different age groups included in the FASI and 
the FASSEP, i.e. subjects from the Immunogenicity Subset during the Active Phase and SEP, respectively. 
For all safety-related analyses in the NS1 Supplemental Analyses, similar populations were used. 
Some aspects of the populations used for the analyses of seropositive subjects (Immunogenicity Subset 
and NS1 analyses) had to be clarified, both for the efficacy and safety analyses of dengue endpoints (i) 
The results section states that efficacy results are presented following a 3-dose schedule 6 months apart. 
This was not consistent with the methods section which refers to all subjects who received at least one 
injection. In addition, it was not clear whether the approach was different between analyses of efficacy 
and safety, and between the Immunogenicity Subset and the NS1 analyses. (ii) Overall methods used 
for the analyses of dengue endpoints (VCD, HCVD or SVCD cases during the Active Phase, Hospital Phase 
or the SEP) are deemed similar, whether presented as efficacy or safety results, but it was nevertheless 
not fully clear. The MAH was therefore requested to clarify. In the response, the MAH clearly confirmed 
that all efficacy and safety analyses on virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD), hospitalized VCD (HCVD) 
or Severe VCD (SVCD) were performed on subjects who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. 
The  MAH  acknowledged  some  erroneous  sentences  in  the  SCE.  These  sentences  were  corrected.  The 
present assessment report has been updated in line with those corrections. 
Summary of main studies 
The  following  tables  summarise  the  efficacy  results  from  the  main  studies  supporting  the  present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment. 
Table 2: Summary of Integrated analyses of Efficacy for trials CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23/57. 
Title:  
Integrated analyses of efficacy including subjects aged 2 to 16 years from the Phase 3 trials (CYD14 
and CYD15) and the Phase 2b PoC (CYD23) trial. Post-hoc analyses in seropositives, stratified by age. 
Study identifier  CYD14, CYD15, CYD23/57. 
Design 
CYD14 and CYD15 are randomised placebo-controlled Phase 3 efficacy trials. 
Study CYD23 (and its long term follow up part, study CYD57) is a Phase 2b PoC 
efficacy trial. 
All three studies were conducted in highly endemic countries. 
Studies were similar in terms of study design.

Main Phases 
Active Phase (M0 to M25, i.e. approximately until 6 months post-last dose), with an 
active surveillance of cases. 
Hospital Phase of 4 years (Year 3 to Year 6), over which only hospitalized dengue 
cases were searched for. 
Surveillance expansion phase (SEP) (only CYD14 and CYD15 subjects who re-
consented), with a surveillance system similar to the one of the Active Phase 
(approximately last 2 years of the planned follow-up period, Year 5 and Year 6). 
Subjects who did not re-consent (approximately 20% of subjects) continued to be 
followed-up as part of the Hospital Phase.  
Hypothesis 
Post-hoc analysis of efficacy (superiority) in seropositive subjects (Immunogenicity 
Subset and NS1 Supplemental analyses). Efficacy was assessed in the new target 
population (6 to 8 years), in 2 to 5 years and in 9 to 16 years populations. Data in the 
overall population 6-16 years were also presented.

Approximately 70% of the subjects in the Immunogenicity 
Subset are seropositive (dengue immune). 
Note: 
Data updated with the final results of CYD14 and CYD15 (5 years follow-up).  
Integrated efficacy analyses were performed in seropositive (PRNT50 ≥10 [1/dil] for at least one 
dengue serotype) subjects from the Immunogenicity Subset. The NS1 Supplemental Analyses are also 
presented as supportive data. These analyses used an approach to indirectly assess baseline serostatus 
by testing M13 samples using a dengue anti-NS1 IgG ELISA. A case-cohort design was used. A 
subcohort of approximately 10% of the total cohorts of CYD14 and CYD15 was included. All subjects 
with an event of interest (VCD, HVCD and SVCD) were included in the case-cohort analysis. Four 
approaches were used to classify subjects as dengue seropositive at baseline.  
Efficacy data refer to the effect of Dengvaxia on dengue endpoints during Year 1 and 2 (Active Phase), 
and approximately Year 5-6 (SEP). A similar approach was used to assess the effect of Dengvaxia on 
HVCD and SVCD during the Hospital Phase. VE extrapolated from RR against HVCD and severe HVCD 
by periods and over the entire study period are presented in this table although they were considered 
safety analyses by the MAH. 
The efficacy results presented in the table focus on those obtained in the new target population (6-8 
years) in comparison to those obtained in the current target population (9-16 years). Efficacy data in 
2-5 and 6-16 years groups are not presented in the table.

Results and Analysis  
Analysis population 
Baseline seropositive subjects included in the FASI and the FASSEP, i.e. subjects 
and time point 
from the Immunogenicity Subset during the Active Phase and SEP, respectively. In 
description 
the FASI, pooled over studies: 236 and 126 seropositive subjects 6-8 years; 1619 
and 784 children 9-16 years, and 259 and 115 children 2 to 5 years, respectively in 
the CYD and Control Groups. Respectively 71% and 67% subjects 6-8 years of age 
in the CYD and Control Groups remained in the FASSEP.  
The sub-cohort of the case-cohort NS1 study included a random selection of 10% 
of the entire study cohorts (n=3578). Of these, 374 were 6-8 years. The 
proportion of subjects classified as seropositive varied across the methods (62.4%-
78.3%). From the subjects of the sub-cohort 92.0% and 77.7% were enrolled in 
the SEP in CYD14 and CYD15, respectively. All relevant endpoint cases were also 
included in the case-cohort analyses. 
In the integrated analyses the ‘Active Phase’ efficacy endpoints were all cases 
collected from first dose until the end of the Active Phase.

All HVCD RRs are <1 in the Immunogenicity subset over the entire study period. 
RR tended to increase (i.e. be closer to 1) with decreasing age. In subjects 6 to 16 
years, the RR estimate was 0.310 (conclusive), corresponding to a VE against 
HVCD of 69%. 
In the NS1 Supplemental Analyses: 
-In subjects aged 6 to 8 years, HVCD RRs ranged from 0.210 to 0.404 (59.6% to 
79.0%). 
-In subjects aged 9 to 16 years, HVCD RRs ranged from 0.129 to 0.213 (78.7% to 
87.1%). 
The upper bound of the 95% CI around the RR was <1 for each estimate.  
SVCD, Entire study 
In the Immunogenicity Subset, a trend toward a lower risk of SVCD in the CYD vs 
the Placebo group was observed over the Entire Study (upper bound of the CI 
above 1).  
In the NS1 Supplemental Analyses: 
-In subjects aged 6 to 8 years, SVCD RRs ranged between 0.22 and 0.40 (VE 60% 
to 78%).  
-In children 9-16 years, SVCD RRs ranged from 0.10 to 0.17 (VE 83% to 90%).  
All RRs were conclusive (except for one of the 4 methods in children 6-8 years).

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To support this extension of indication to younger age groups, the MAH presented the integrated analyses 
of efficacy including subjects aged 2 to 16 years from the Phase 3 efficacy trials (CYD14 and CYD15) 
and from the Phase 2b PoC (CYD23) trial. The data were updated with the final results of the 2 pivotal 
efficacy  studies  CYD14  and  CYD15  for  which  data  of  5  years  follow-up  after  the  last  dose  are  now 
available. In addition to the efficacy data in the new target population of the claimed indication (children 
6 to 8 years), the MAH presented efficacy data in children 9-16 years (benchmark) and 2-5 years, to 
provide  a  comprehensive  view,  and  to  update  results  from  the  prior  submission.  Data  in  the  overall 
population  6-16  years  (i.e.  all  available  efficacy  data  supporting  the  proposed  indication)  are  also 
presented. Efficacy data in the new target population of the claimed indication (children 6 to 8 years) 
and  in  children  2-5  years  are  mainly  data  from  CYD14  (and  limited  data  from  CYD23),  while  data  in 
children 9-16 years are both from CYD14 and CYD15. 
As  the  indication  is  restricted  to  subjects  with  evidence  of  prior  dengue  virus  infection,  the  efficacy 
analyses focused on seropositive subjects. Therefore, these analyses are limited to subjects for whom 
baseline serostatus data are available (Immunogenicity Subset). Dengue seropositivity was defined as 
a  neutralizing  Ab  level  ≥  10  1/dil  against  at  least  one  dengue  serotype  measured  by  PRNT50. 
Importantly, the NS1 Supplemental Analyses are also presented as supportive data, as this allowed an 
assessment on a larger number of cases. 
Long-term data analyses related to hospitalised dengue are presented in the safety section but discussed 
together with the efficacy data in this section. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Design of the three Efficacy Studies: 
CYD14 and CYD15 are randomised placebo-controlled Phase 3 efficacy studies. These trials randomized 
(in  a  2:1  CYD:Placebo  ratio)  respectively  10,275  children  2  to  14  years  in  Asia  Pacific  (AP)  endemic 
countries and 20,869 children 9 to 16 years in LatAm endemic countries. Study CYD23 is a Phase 2b 
PoC efficacy study conducted in Thailand among 4002 children 4 to 11 years (also randomized in a 2:1 
CYD:Placebo ratio).

In  these  studies,  there  was  an  ‘Active  Phase’  (from  M0  to  M25),  over  which  an  active  surveillance  of 
cases was performed. This phase was followed by an Hospital Phase of 4 years (Year 3 to Year 6), over 
which only hospitalized dengue cases were searched for. Following the acknowledgment of the safety 
issue  (increased  risk  of  severe  dengue  in  sero-naïve  individuals)  by  the  MAH  (end  of  Year  4),  a 
surveillance system similar to the one of the Active Phase (‘surveillance expansion phase’ [SEP]) was 
set up. The SEP was restricted to subjects from CYD14 and CYD15. No SEP was instituted in CYD23/57 
(CYD57 being the follow-up study of study CYD23), as this study was already completed at that time. 
The SEP started more than 2 years after the end of the Active Phase, at various times depending of the 
time  of  protocol  approval  and  the  time  required  to  ask  re-consent  from  the  subjects.  The  SEP  lasted 
approximately the last 2 years of the planned follow-up period in CYD14 and CYD15 (Year 5 and Year 6) 
and allowed for persistence of efficacy assessment. Subjects who did not re-consent (approximately 20% 
of subjects) continued to be followed-up as part of the Hospital Phase.  
Studies were similar in terms of study design. CYD14 and CYD15 used the same endpoints definitions, 
supporting the pooled analyses. The CYD23 used a slightly different dengue case definition, laboratory 
methods and testing algorithm (see below).  
The main limitations of the efficacy trials as identified in previous assessments are as follows: 
- The trials did not aim to assess the effect of CYD on VCD and severe VCD according to dengue immune 
serostatus at baseline, and more generally, according to flaviviruses serostatus at baseline. The number 
of  subjects  for  whom  dengue  serostatus  was  determined  (by  PRNT50)  at  baseline  is  limited: 
approximately 7.5% (N=300), 10% (N=2000), and 20% (N=2000) of study participants in CYD23/57, 
CYD15, and CYD14, respectively.  
-  Efficacy  data  were  to  be  collected  during  the  Active  Phase  only  i.e.  up  to  1  year  post-last  vaccine 
injection.  The  Hospital  Phase  was  conceived  to  assess  long-term  safety  only  (detection  of  signals  of 
enhanced disease). In line with this approach, past the first year post dose 3, only hospitalised cases 
were detected, and surveillance methods were weakened. 
Overall, this implied that data on the long-term effect of CYD on clinically meaningful endpoints (including 
severe dengue) and in relevant subgroups (i.e. according to serostatus and age at baseline) could not 
be generated. This was considered as a weakness given that enhanced disease is more likely to occur in 
naïve individuals, when protective immunity wanes.  
To address these limitations, at the end of Year 4, the MAH set up a protocol amendment allowing for a 
more active follow up of dengue on the long term (SEP). The MAH also extended the number of available 
data on baseline serostatus by using post-hoc analyses (see NS1 Supplemental Analyses, below in this 
section). 
Objectives: 
The main objectives of the efficacy analyses performed to support this extension of indication are similar 
in  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  and  the  NS1  Supplemental  analyses  and  consistent  with  the  previous 
Integrated Efficacy Analyses. Efficacy was assessed in dengue seropositive subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 
6 to 8 years and 9 to 16 years, during the whole Active Phase (M0-M25) and the SEP (from the time of 
consent until the end of the study). Efficacy in preventing the occurrence of VCD due to any serotype 
and to each serotype was assessed. Efficacy in preventing HVCD and SVCD (as per IDMC definition) was 
also assessed during these periods. 
Efficacy  data  thus  refer  to  the  effect  of  Dengvaxia  on  dengue  endpoints  during  Year  1  and  2  (Active 
Phase), and approximately Year 5-6 (SEP). A similar approach (analyses in the Immunogenicity Subset, 
supported by NS1 Supplemental Analyses) was used to assess the effect of Dengvaxia on hospitalised 
dengue and severe hospitalised dengue during the Hospital Phase. RR against HVCD and severe HVCD

are presented. This was considered as safety analyses by the MAH (instead of efficacy). This distinction 
between efficacy and safety data is artificial, but reflects the initial design of the studies. 
Endpoints: 
Efficacy  endpoints  include  symptomatic  virologically-confirmed  dengue  (VCD),  severe  virologically-
confirmed dengue (SVCD) as ascertained by the IDMC and hospitalized virologically-confirmed dengue 
(HVCD), due to any and to each serotype, occurring during the Active Phase and during the SEP. HVCD 
and hospitalised SVCD during the Hospital Phase were collected as part of the safety endpoints. 
Detection of VCD and HVCD cases over the study phases: 
The Active Phase started on the day of the first dose and lasted until 13 months after the third injection. 
This Phase includes an intensive surveillance in order to maximize the detection of all symptomatic VCD 
episodes.  This  included  school-based  surveillance,  and  reminders  to  the  participants  through  phone 
calls/SMS or home visits. The Hospital Phase (approximately Year 3 to Year 6) started at the end of the 
Active Phase and ended up to 5 years after the third injection. During this period only hospitalized and 
severe hospitalized dengue cases were collected. The collection of events was based on surveillance of 
both  study  and  non-study  healthcare  sites.  There  was  a  minimum  frequency  of  one  contact  every  3 
months. During the SEP (approximately Year 5 and Year 6), a surveillance system similar to the one of 
the Active Phase (SEP) was set up.  
Efficacy endpoints, definition and ascertainment methods: 
Symptomatic  VCD  was  defined  as  an  acute  febrile  episode  virologically  confirmed  by  dengue  reverse 
transcriptase  polymerase  chain  reaction  (RT-PCR)  and/or  dengue  NS1  enzyme  linked  immunosorbent 
assay  (ELISA)  antigen  test,  in  line  with  WHO  recommendation.  In  case  of  a  febrile  episode,  2  blood 
samples were to be collected (a first as soon as possible and a second 7-14 days after the acute sample). 
RT-PCR assays for dengue are highly sensitive and specific if performed on early samples. The NS1 ELISA 
Ag assay is less sensitive and less specific than RT-PCR assays during the very few days after symptom 
onset, but is useful to identify dengue on samples collected later (days 4 and 5). Virologically-confirmed 
cases were serotyped. Overall, the protocol definition and assessment methods for VCD were considered 
appropriate. However, misclassification between dengue and other flaviviruses remains a possibility. It 
is not known whether this could have affected the VE results (by dilution), particularly during the SEP 
due to the zika outbreak in LatAm (CYD15 results).  
Severe VCD (SVCD) as ascertained by the IDMC was defined as VCD accompanied by at least one severity 
criteria: (i) Low platelet count with bleeding and plasma leakage, (ii) Shock, (iii) Bleeding requiring blood 
transfusion, (iv) Encephalopathy, (v) Liver impairment, (vi) Impaired kidney function, (vii) Myocarditis, 
pericarditis or clinical heart failure. The IDMC definition was supported as it takes into account the 1997 
and 2009 WHO definitions. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) evaluated all VCD/HVCD 
for severity according to pre-defined criteria. The definition of SVCD was identical between all phases, 
as  well  as  the  review  process  by  the  IDMC.  However,  due  to  differences  in  the  surveillance  systems, 
severe cases were identified among all VCD cases during the Active Phase and the SEP but only among 
hospitalized cases during the Hospital Phase. There were few cases assessed as severe without having 
been hospitalized.  
Hospitalized VCD (HVCD) was defined as any VCD case leading to hospitalization. This endpoint presents 
several limitations: (i) The rate of hospitalisation of VCD depends on local practices (in CYD14, this rate 
varied from 6% in Vietnam to 46% in Indonesia during the Active Phase); (ii) A high level of protocol 
deviations occurred in the Hospital Phase. For ex. acute samples were not collected within 5 days for the 
PCR confirmation of dengue (as required per protocol) in 2% of the subjects during the Active Phase and 
18% of the Year 3 (1st year of the Hospital Phase); (iii) The annual detection rate of hospitalization for 
Assessment report

VCD decreased between the Active and Hospital phases in the placebo group, raising the hypothesis of 
an underdetection/underreporting of (severe) HVCD during the Hospital Phase as compared to the Active 
Phase. Although data collected during the Hospital Phase are less robust than in the Active Phase, data 
on hospitalised dengue are very informative with respect to the duration of protection.  
Endpoints in individual vs pooled analyses: 
Endpoints  definitions  used  in  the  analyses  performed  to  support  this  extension  of  indication  are 
corresponding to those of each individual study. The endpoint definitions were similar over the 3 efficacy 
studies. Only slight differences in the definition of fever were noted between CYD14/CYD15 and CYD23, 
as well as a slight difference in the timepoint for the second blood sample (within 7 days of the onset of 
fever in CYD23, within 5 days of the onset of fever in CYD14 and CYD15). The methods for serotype 
identification slightly varied between CYD14/CYD15 and CYD23. 
In the primary analysis of each trial, the primary endpoint observation period extended from 28 days 
after the third dose up to the end of the Active Phase (period M13-M25). This differs from the integrated 
analyses in which the ‘Active Phase’ efficacy endpoints were all cases collected from the first dose until 
the end of the Active Phase. This might potentially have led to an underestimation of the VE. The ‘SEP’ 
efficacy  endpoints  used  in  the  integrated  analyses  were  all  cases  collected  from  date  of  subject  re-
consented until the end of the study. 
Additional analyses 
NS1 Supplemental Analyses: 
The MAH performed the NS1 Supplemental Analyses, which confirmed the safety issue in seronegatives. 
The  NS1  Supplemental  Analyses  aimed  at  obtaining  efficacy  and  relative  risk  estimates  according  to 
dengue  serostatus  in  the  efficacy  trials.  These  analyses  are  provided  for  seropositives  in  the  present 
application, updated with the full FU period. 
Given that the majority of study participants had no pre-vaccination blood sample, the MAH developed 
an approach to indirectly assess baseline serostatus by testing M13 samples (i.e. 1 month after the third 
vaccine dose), as these samples were taken in all subjects. PRNT assay could not be used as it is not 
able  to  distinguish  immunity  induced  by  vaccination  and  prior  dengue  infection.  Therefore,  the  MAH 
developed  a  dengue  anti-nonstructural  protein  1  (NS1)  IgG  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay 
(ELISA).  This  NS1  assay  aims  at  differentiating  anti-NS1  antibodies  induced  by  wild-type  dengue 
infection from those induced by vaccination (since the CYD dengue vaccine contains genes encoding NS1 
from the yellow fever 17D vaccine virus rather than from dengue virus).  
The  dengue  NS1  IgG  ELISA  assay  measures  total  IgG  antibodies  against  the  NS1  protein  of  the  four 
dengue virus serotypes by ELISA. As part of previous assessments, it was considered that due to the 
lack of standardised methods to evaluate the performance of assays (lack of reference samples or criteria 
for  their  selection),  specificity  and  sensitivity  of  the  assay  are  not  known.  Moreover,  the  time  since 
infection and the epidemiological context influence sensitivity and specificity. Specificity is expected to 
be  largely  influenced  by  the  circulation  of  other  flaviviruses,  as  dengue  IgG  ELISA  assays  commonly 
present  cross-reactivity  with  other  flaviviruses.  Regarding  the  potential  interference  of  dengue  NS1-
specific IgG to Zika, it has to be noted that the M13 blood samples were taken before Zika epidemics in 
Latin America, so with no impact on the results. It is unclear how the circulation of various flaviviruses 
could have influenced the NS1 study results according the local epidemiology. 
The vaccine contains NS1 genes from the YF virus. Therefore, the Dengue anti-NS1 IgG ELISA assay is 
theoretically adequate to differentiate immunity induced by CYD vaccination from that induced by natural 
dengue  infection.  Previous  exposure  to  CYD  vaccine  was  not  expected  to  induce  meaningful  levels  of

antibody against the dengue NS1 protein. However, in the original NS1 Supplemental study, an influence 
of CYD vaccination on the read-out was observed. To address the potential differential misclassification 
bias associated with CYD effect on anti-NS1 readout at M13, the MAH used the baseline (M0) PRNT50 
dengue  antibody  values,  either  measured  or  predicted  (when  measured  value  not  available).  The 
prediction was based on a model which used Dengue anti-NS1 ELISA values at M13 and other covariates 
such as age, sex, country, indicator of whether subject had VCD between M0 and M13, time between 
onset of VCD case and M13 sample collection date, and treatment group as predictors. The model used 
for  the  imputation  was  fitted  in  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  using  baseline  serostatus  (negative  or 
positive) as dependent variable. Prediction of M0 PRNT50 was undertaken using multiple imputation (MI) 
and SuperLearner methods. 
A case-cohort design was used. A sample of subjects, referred to as the sub-cohort, was first selected 
randomly  from  the  entire  study  cohorts  of  CYD14,  CYD15,  and  CYD23/57.  Subjects  with  an  event  of 
interest (VCD, HVCD and SVCD) but not selected in the sub-cohort were then included in the case-cohort 
analysis. Approximately 10% of the total cohorts was included. Subjects from CYD23/57 were included 
in the sub-cohort, but in the end, this study is not part of the NS1 Supplemental Analyses, as retesting 
of the samples was not allowed as per ICF. 
The  design  was  assessed  previously.  Briefly,  the  case-cohort  design  is  a  specific  type  of  case-control 
design where the cases are the same cases as would be included in a cohort study, and controls consist 
of a random sample selected from the entire source population that gives rise to the cases. Such design 
allows for the estimation of risk ratios (when the sample is representative from the source population, 
the risk ratio computed using the sample equals the risk ratio computed within the entire cohorts). An 
advantage of a case-cohort study is that the same sub-cohort can be used as the comparison group for 
studying different endpoints, rather than identifying a new set of controls for each endpoint. The case-
cohort design is thus particularly well suited for the present situation. In addition, this design is much 
more  efficient  than  the  corresponding  cohort  design,  as  a  sample  much  smaller  than  the  full  cohort 
generally results in only a marginal loss in statistical power (the statistical power is mostly determined 
by the number of subjects with the event).  
For the present extension of indication, four approaches were used in the NS1 Supplemental Analyses 
to classify subjects as dengue seropositive or seronegative at baseline. Two approaches were referred 
as  ‘primary’.  The  first  one  (MI  PRNT50  M0)  used  PRNT50  results  at  Month  0,  either  measured  (for 
subjects included in the Immunogenicity Subset) or predicted by a multiple imputation model based on 
anti-NS1 ELISA values at M13 and covariates (for subjects not included in the Immunogenicity Subset). 
The second (NS1 [Thr9] M13) used measured anti-NS1 ELISA antibody titers at M13 with a threshold of 
≥9 EU/mL. These two methods were used in the previously presented NS1 Supplemental Analyses to 
explore  the  safety  issue  in  seronegative  individuals.  Two  additional  approaches  were  used:  PRNT90 
results at Month 0 (MI PRNT90 M0) either measured or imputed (similar as the approach for PRNT50) 
and anti-NS1 antibody titers measured at M13 (NS1 [Thr50] M13) with a threshold of ≥50 EU/mL. These 
two  additional  methods  are  more  appropriate  in  the  present  context,  as  by using  more  specific  read-
outs,  they  limit  the  probability  of  naïve  subjects  being  wrongly  classified  as  baseline  seropositive. 
Although these methods are more adequate for correctly identifying those previously exposed to dengue, 
the real false positive rate remains uncertain.  
Subjects naïve at baseline and who presented a dengue episode between M0 and M13 are classified as 
seropositives by the anti-NS1 readout at M13. Therefore, the evaluation of efficacy was performed from 
post-dose 3 until the end of Active Phase (M13-M25) (excluding the events between M0-M13) for the 
NS1 (Thr9 and Thr50) M13 methods. For the MI PRNT50/90 M0 methods, VE was estimated over the 
whole  Active  Phase  (D0-M25).  Compared  to  M13  anti-NS1  value,  relying  on  predicted/imputed  M0 
PRNT50/90  as  a  surrogate  of  prior  exposure  to  dengue  is  likely  to  minimise  the  differential  biases, 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 32/116 
 
 
 
especially because the model included as predictor an indicator of whether the subject had VCD between 
M0  and  M13.  It  is  unclear  however  to  what  extend  the  bias  was  corrected,  especially  because  the 
approach was not able address misclassification of asymptomatic infection occurring between M0 and 
M13. 
Statistical analyses: 
Data are provided by study and pooled for CYD14+CYD15. The CYD23 data and the pooled analysis on 
CYD14+CYD15+CYD23 or CYD14+CYD23 are also provided as supportive data. As the endpoints were 
similar  and  the  results  from  the  2  Phase  3  efficacy  studies  were  highly  consistent  across  studies,  the 
integrated efficacy analysis estimates are considered robust.  
In the Immunogenicity Subset, incidence densities were estimated for each group, for the Active Phase 
and the SEP in the individual studies. For subjects with several episodes, only the first episode of VCD 
was  included  in  the  analysis  of  VE.  VE  was  calculated  using  the  incidence  densities.  In  the  pooled 
analyses,  VE  was  calculated  as  the  Hazard  Ratio  (HR)  reduction  using  the  HR  obtained  with  a  Cox 
regression  model  which  included,  in  addition  to  treatment  group,  the  study  and  study-by-group 
interactions. In the NS1 Supplemental Analyses, VE was estimated by using HR estimated with a modified 
Cox  regression  model  proposed  by  Prentice.  VE  estimates  are  considered  conclusive  when  the  lower 
bound of the 95%CI is above 0. 
A similar approach was used for safety estimations by computing RR defined as the ratio of annualized 
density incidences (individual studies), or HRs (pooled analyses and NS1 Supplemental Analyses). RRs 
for HVCD and SVCD were estimated over the Entire Study period (i.e. from either M0 or M13 until the 
end of the study), by time period (i.e. Active Phase, Year 1 of Hospital Phase, Year 2 of Hospital Phase, 
and beyond Year 2 of Hospital Phase), and by study phase. VE estimates against HVCD and SVCD (Active 
Phase and SEP) were obtained from HR estimates analyzed as part of the safety assessment.  
All efficacy and safety analyses were performed on subjects who received at least one dose of vaccine 
or placebo. For the efficacy assessments in the Immunogenicity Subset, the populations analysed consist 
of baseline seropositive subjects from the different age groups included in the FASI and the FASSEP, i.e. 
subjects from the Immunogenicity Subset during the Active Phase and SEP, respectively.  
Results 
Description of Study Populations: 
For  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  analyses  (FASI,  pooled  over  studies),  there  were  236  and  126 
seropositive  subjects  6-8  years  respectively  in  the  CYD  and  Control  Groups  (mainly  CYD14,  also 
CYD23/57). There were 1619 and 784 children 9-16 years (all studies, mainly CYD15), and 259 and 115 
children 2 to 5 years (CYD14 and CYD23/57), in respective groups. Respectively 71% and 67% subjects 
6-8 years of age in the CYD and Control Groups remained in the FASSEP. Age and gender were balanced 
between  groups,  within  each  study,  and  within  age  categories.  Most  of  the  6-8  years  old  population 
originates from CYD14, as there were no children of this age in CYD15. 
The sub-cohort of the case-cohort NS1 study included a random selection (stratifying for age and trial 
site) of 10% of the entire study cohorts. This represented 3578 subjects irrespective of serostatus and 
age (CYD14, n=1099; CYD15, n=2130; CYD23/57, n=349). Of these 3578 subjects, 374 were 6-8 years. 
The percentage of subjects included from each group (CYD and Control Groups) was similar. As explained 
in study methods, all relevant cases were also included in the case-cohort analyses. Subjects from the 
CYD23 were at the end not included in the NS1 Supplemental analyses (consent could not be obtained 
for retesting, see above). From the subjects of the sub-cohort 92.0% and 77.7% were enrolled in the 
SEP in CYD14 and CYD15, respectively. The proportion of subjects classified as seropositive varied across

the  method  used.  In  subjects  aged  6-16  years  these  proportions  were  respectively  in  the  CYD  and 
Placebo Groups: 78.3% and 76.2% with MI PRNT50 M0, 71.9% and 72.4% with MI PRNT90 M0, 79.6% 
and  77.7%  with  NS1  (Thr9)  M13,  and  67.9%  and  62.4%  with  the  NS1  (Thr50)  M13.  As  expected, 
percentages were lower with the more specific methods. 
Vaccine Efficacy against VCD due to any serotype during the Active Phase: 
VE against VCD during the Active Phase tends to be lower in children 6-8 years of age (71.6% [95%CI: 
28.9; 88.7]) and 2-5 year of age (71.6% [95%CI: 20.3; 89.9]) compared to older children 9-16 years 
(81.9%  [95%  CI:  67.2;  90.0])  (Immunogenicity  Subset,  pooled).  Confidence  intervals  are  largely 
overlapping.  Results  in  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  are  overall  supported  by  those  of  the  NS1 
Supplemental Analyses, and are consistent across methods and studies. Overall, in the population 6-16 
years, VE was 79.9 % (95% CI: 66.9; 87.7) (Immunogenicity Subset, pooled). 
Vaccine Efficacy against VCD due to any serotype during the SEP: 
Results  are  not  consistent  between  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  and  the  NS1  Supplemental  analyses. 
Data in the Immunogenicity Subset suggest a lack of efficacy over the SEP, whatever the age category. 
In  contrast,  the  NS1  analyses  suggest  that  VE  against  VCD  persists  during  the  SEP,  similarly  in  both 
children 6-8 and 9-16 year of age, although at lower level (40-65%, LB of 95%CI>0 for most estimates) 
compared to the Active Phase. There were no marked differences across studies. Point estimates were 
similar in both age categories. In contrast, VE seems not maintained in children 2-5 years of age in the 
NS1 analyses.  
Vaccine Efficacy against VCD due to each serotype during the Active Phase: 
Analyses by serotype and age categories are statistically not meaningful (estimates too imprecise). In 
the  overall  cohort  of  children  6-16  years,  VCD  VE  against  serotype  2,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  against 
serotype  1,  tends  to  be  lower  compared  to  other  serotypes  during  the  Active  Phase.  This  is  already 
described in the SmPC for the 9-16 years children. It is noted that the efficacy results do not match the 
immunogenicity results (lower immunogenicity for serotype 4).  
Vaccine Efficacy against VCD due to each serotype during the SEP: 
Results by serotype are not interpretable in the Immunogenicity Subset. 
In the pooled NS1 Supplemental Analyses, results tended to vary across studies. Some persisting efficacy 
was observed for all serotypes in CYD14 (serotype 1: 49.1-73.8%, serotype 2: 59.5-84.5%, serotype 
3:  29.1-44.2%,  serotype  4:  74.8-83.5%).  Levels  of  efficacy  persisting  during  the  SEP  varied  widely 
across serotypes in CYD15. In this study, no or very low efficacy persistence is observed for serotypes 
1, 2 and 3. In contrast, persistence of efficacy against VCD is observed for serotype 4 during the SEP. 
Results of VE due to each serotype during the SEP are difficult to interpret due to small numbers and to 
the possible impact of the Zika outbreak that occurred in Latin America during CYD15. 
Overall, in CYD14 and CYD15, dengue-neutralizing antibody levels decrease over time from post-dose 3 
through  Year  5,  for  all  4  serotypes.  GMTs  for  each  serotype  remain  at  higher  levels  than  baseline. 
Differences across groups attenuate with time. GMTs at Year 5 remain higher in the vaccinated group 
vs. the control group, for all 4 serotypes, particularly in CYD14 (see immunogenicity discussion). 
The MAH investigated the effects of Zika infection on dengue-neutralizing antibody responses in a post-
hoc  analysis  of  data  from  the  CYD15  study.2 All  virologically  confirmed  Zika  episodes  were  detected 
during the SEP. Dengue-neutralizing antibody responses were boosted for those who experienced Zika 
infection  (this  may  at  least  partly  explain  why  the  Zika  epidemic  was  associated  with  a  coincident

decrease in dengue across the Americas). As the Zika infection attack rate was substantial during the 
SEP, this affected greatly the overall level of neutralizing antibodies during the SEP and overall GMTs 
went  up  during  the  SEP  in  both  groups.  The  booster  effect  of  Zika  infection  was  pronounced  in  the 
placebo  Group,  but  much  less  marked  (serotype  1  and  3)  or  not  seen  (serotype  2  and  4)  for  those 
vaccinated. As a consequence, the remaining differences in terms of neutralizing antibodies between the 
groups are very modest this study, except for serotype 4 for which some difference remains at the end 
of  the  SEP.  This  phenomenon  may  have  influenced  efficacy  over  time  in  CYD15.  However,  the  actual 
clinical relevance of the immunogenicity findings by serotype remains unknow, as there is no direct link 
between serotype-specific immune responses and efficacy for this vaccine. For example, VCD efficacy 
(Active Phase) against serotype 2, and to a lesser extent against serotype 1, tends to be lower compared 
to  other  serotypes.  In  contrast  to  efficacy,  GMTs  tend  to  be  consistently  lower  for  serotype  4  when 
compared to serotypes 1-3 GMTs. The impact of immunological cross-reactivity between assay on the 
immunogenicity results is also unclear. 
Vaccine Efficacy against HVCD and SVCD due to any serotype during the Active Phase: 
In  the  Immunogenicity  Subset,  numbers  of  HVCD  and  SVCD  cases  are  low  and  did  not  allow  VE 
estimations, but in all age categories those numbers are consistent with efficacy (i.e. numbers in favour 
of CYD vs Placebo). 
Although imprecise, all HVCD/SVCD VE point estimates are in favour of CYD, in all age categories in the 
NS1 Supplemental analyses. VE points estimates were higher compared to those of VE against VCD, and 
were consistent across methods. HVCD/SVCD VE tended to decrease with decreasing age. In children 6-
16  years  (NS1  Supplemental  analyses,  pooled  analysis  CYD14+CYD15),  VE  estimates  against  HVCD 
ranged between 90.3% (95% CI: 80.1; 95.3) and 95.7% (95% CI: 87.9; 98.5), while VE against SVCD 
ranged between 91.8% (95% CI: 72.3; 97.6) and 96.8% (95% CI: 75.9; 99.6). 
Vaccine Efficacy against HVCD and SVCD due to any serotype during the SEP: 
Overall, SEP data are imprecise for HVCD in the Immunogenicity Subset, precluding the calculation of 
VE. Numbers are not consistent with a safety concern (the case split remains favourable to the vaccine). 
NS1 Supplemental Analyses suggest that some level of efficacy may be maintained Year 5 and 6 post-
vaccination against HVCD, both in children 6-8 and 9-16 years of age. The level of efficacy is consistent 
with or slightly higher than that seen for VCD efficacy over the SEP. In contrast, data in children 2-5 
years suggest a lack of or negative efficacy (HVCD) over the long term. 
The number of subjects with a SVCD was very low and precluded the calculation of VE. The data do not 
suggest an increased risk associated with vaccination, for the overall proposed indication population or 
for the subcategories 6-8 years and 9-16 years. 
Vaccine Efficacy against HVCD due to any serotype by study period: 
In the Immunogenicity Subset (pooled studies), there are only few cases, and estimates per period are 
very imprecise. Estimates are also imprecise in the NS1 analyses for the Hospital Phase, as estimates 
were computed over one year (instead of 2 for the other Phases).  
In the Immunogenicity Subset and in the NS1 analyses, RR point estimates are <1 (decreased risk of 
HVCD in vaccinated vs. controls for all the periods in children aged 6 to 8 years and aged 9 to 16 years 
(except for Year 4 in the younger children in the Immunogenicity subset, with a RR of 1.09). During Year 
3 and Year 4, RRs were closer to 1 compared to the Active Phase and the SEP, for both age categories. 
In children 6-16 years, RRs ranged 0.04-0.12 (Active Phase), 0.21-0.33 (Year 3), 0.20-0.38 (Year 4), 
and 0.23-0.43 (Years 5-6), respectively (NS1 analyses), with conclusive estimates. Overall, these data 
suggest a decrease in efficacy over time after the Active Phase, and do not point to a safety issue.

Age trend: 
Overall, vaccine efficacy tends to be lower with lowering age. It is considered likely that higher proportion 
of baseline dengue naïve subjects (therefore higher false positive rate) and lower immunity to dengue 
at baseline, both in terms of magnitude and quality (such as monotypic vs multitypic profile) in younger 
age categories contribute to this trend.  
Age ranges of the enrolled populations, dengue virus serotype as well as other flavivirus circulation vary 
across  studies.  Specificity  of  the  PRNT  and  NS1  assay  may  also  vary  across  studies  (due  to  local 
circulation of flaviviruses). The independent effect of age, study region, misclassification of serostatus , 
and baseline immunity on the efficacy results, is difficult to disentangle. 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy  was  assessed  post  hoc  in  seropositive  subjects  from  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  and  in  the 
supportive  NS1  Supplemental  analyses  from  the  CYD14  and  CYD15  trials.  despite  some  limitations, 
results of both the immunogenicity Subset and the NS1 Supplemental analyses suggest efficacy and no 
safety issue in term of risk of severe dengue, in the 6-8 years as in the 9-16 years. 
Up to one year post-dose 3, efficacy against virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) was demonstrated in 
the new target population (6-8 years), but with wide 95% CI. There is a trend towards lower efficacy in 
this  age  group  (approximately  70%)  compared  to  the  9-16  years  (approximately  80%).  Although 
estimates are imprecise, data suggest efficacy against hospitalised VCD and against severe VCD in all 
age categories. 
The long-term data show that efficacy decreases over time as of Year 3 (after the Active Phase), but do 
not suggest a risk associated with vaccination, for both the 6-8 years and 9-16 years populations.  
The CHMP noted that data are imprecise and inconsistent between the Immunogenicity Subset and the 
NS1 analyses for the Surveillance Expansion Phase (Year 5-6). The first suggest a lack of efficacy against 
VCD during that period, while the latter suggest that some level of efficacy may be maintained over Year 
5 and Year 6 post-vaccination, against VCD and hospitalised VCD, both in children 6-8 and 9-16 years 
of age. 
Clinical safety 
The  pooled/integrated  safety  analysis  includes  22  clinical  studies  used  for  the  evaluation  of  the  CYD 
dengue vaccine final formulation (i.e. ~5 log10 CCID50 per dose per serotype), in subjects aged ≥6 years 
irrespective  of the vaccination schedule. The 22 clinical studies contributing  to the reactogenicity and 
safety  results  presented  in  this  document  are:  3  Phase  I  (CYD04,  CYD05,  and  CYD06),  2  Phase  IIa 
(CYD10 and CYD11), 9 Phase II (CYD12, CYD13, CYD22, CYD24, CYD28, CYD30, CYD47, CYD51, and 
CYD65  [intermediate  results  –  until  approximately  one  year  after  the  primary  series]),  2  Phase  IIb 
(CYD23/57), 4 Phase III (CYD14, CYD15, CYD17, and CYD32) and 2 Phase IIIb (CYD71 and CYD67). 
The design and objectives of studies recently completed or having achieved a milestone assessing clinical 
safety (i.e. CYD14, CYD15, CYD65, CYD71, and CYD67) are summarized in the table below. The design 
and  objectives  of  the  other  studies  contributing  to  the  safety  assessment  have  been  provided  by  the

Figure 5: Main and Secondary Studies Considered for the pooled/integrated analysis of safety 
in subjects aged 6 to 8 years 
In  order  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  of  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine,  long-term  follow-up  was 
implemented in several studies (i.e. CYD05, CYD22, CYD28, CYD23/57, CYD14, and CYD15) to assess 
SAEs, deaths, and hospitalized dengue cases. 
Pre-defined solicited reactions (including injection site reactions collected for 7 days after each injection 
[pain, erythema, and swelling], and systemic reactions collected for 14 days after each injection [fever, 
headache, malaise, myalgia, and asthenia]) and all unsolicited reactions (up to 28 days) were collected 
for all participants following each injection in all studies except CYD23, CYD14, and CYD15, in which they 
were  collected  in  a  subset  of  subjects  (i.e.  the  immunogenicity  and  reactogenicity  subsets).  All  SAEs 
were collected up to at least 6 months after the last injection. In studies including a long-term follow-
up, all SAEs were collected during the long-term follow-up, except in CYD05, CYD22, CYD57 and CYD28 
in which a limited set of SAEs including related SAEs and hospitalized dengue cases was collected. 
AESIs  were  also  collected:  AESIs  including  allergic  reactions  and  anaphylaxis  were  collected  within  7 
days of each injection; viscerotropic and neurotropic events within 30 days; episodes of serious dengue 
disease throughout the entire studies. 
Although the safety data have been presented in other age groups (6 to 60 years, 46 to 60 years, and 
9 to 17 years), the CHMP assessment focussed on safety data in the new target population (6 to 8 years) 
and on data presented in the SmPC (from 6 to 17 years, and from 18-45 years). The data cut-off is the 
19/03/2020. 
Five  studies  included  a  long-term  follow-up  in  subjects  aged  6  to  8  years  (CYD05,  CYD22,  CYD28, 
CYD23/57, and CYD14). SAEs were collected up to 48 months post-injection 3 in Phase II studies CYD22 
and  CYD28,  and  up  to  60  months  post-injection  3  in  Phase  I  study  CYD05,  and  Phase  IIb/Phase  III 
efficacy studies CYD23/57 and CYD14 (main studies).  
In the pool of CYD14+CYD57, the mean duration of follow-up during the long-term safety follow-up of 
all the children aged 6 to 8 years was comparable in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (1608 days) and in 
the Placebo Group (1601 days), i.e. approximately 53 months, or 4.5 years. The median duration was 
also similar (1633 days in both groups). Individual study results were consistent with the pooled data. 
Similar results were observed in seropositive and seronegative subjects.

Patient exposure 
A  total  of  30  145  subjects  from  9  months  through  60  years  received  at  least  1  injection  of  the  CYD 
dengue vaccine (~5 log10 CCID50 per dose and per serotype, regardless of the schedule) in 25 studies. 
The number of subjects who received each comparator vaccine in the age categories 6 to 8 years, 9 to 
17 years, 18 to 45 years, and 46 to 60 years are presented in table below: 
Table 4: Overall extent of exposure, regardless of baseline dengue serostatus*, Subjects 
aged 6 to 60 years by Age Group - Safety Analysis Set (Table 1.8 of the Addendum to 2.7.4 
Summary of Clinical Safety). 
The CHMP noted that two thirds of the children aged 6 to 8 years received at least 1 injection in the 3-
dose schedule of CYD dengue vaccine (5555 formulation) and  on third were vaccinated with placebo. 
Only few children aged 6 to 8 years were vaccinated with other comparator vaccines (such as hepatitis 
A  vaccine,  meningococcal  vaccine,  pneumococcal  vaccine,  rabies  vaccine,  typhoid  vaccine  and  yellow 
fever vaccine). 
The safety analysis set (SafAS) for the 3-dose schedule included a total of 24 733 subjects aged 6 to 60 
years who were randomized to the CYD dengue vaccine Group and received at least 1 injection of the

final formulation at the 3-dose schedule D0/M6/M12. It included the following number of subjects per 
age groups: 3233 children aged 6 to 8 years, 19 715 children / adolescents aged 9 to 17 years, 1492 
adults aged 18 to 45 years, and 293 adults aged 46 to 60 years. 
The Reactogenicity Subset for the 3-dose schedule included a total of 6219 subjects aged 6 to 60 years 
including: 768 children aged 6 to 8 years, 3666 children / adolescents aged 9 to 17 years, 1492 adults 
aged 18 to 45 years, and 293 adults aged 46 to 60 years. 
For the evaluation of safety events after any injection of the 3-dose vaccination schedule D0/M6/M12, 3 
groups were defined: CYD dengue vaccine Group (i.e. subjects who received at least 1 of the 3 planned 
CYD dengue vaccine injections), Placebo Group (i.e. subjects who received at least 1 injection of the 3 
planned placebo injection and no CYD dengue vaccine or comparator vaccine), and Control Group (i.e. 
subjects who received at least 1 injection of either placebo or comparator vaccine and no CYD dengue 
vaccine). 
The demographic characteristics were generally similar between the CYD dengue vaccine Group, Placebo 
Group,  and  Control  Group  regardless  of  the  age  group;  however,  differences  in  ethnic  origin  were  a 
consequence of studies being conducted in different regions. 
In the included 3233 children aged 6 to 8 years, the distribution between males and females was similar 
(table below). The mean age of subjects at enrolment for the combined regions was 7.0 years. There 
were no subjects aged 6 to 8 years from the non-endemic region.  
In studies in the endemic AP region, among subjects with an available dengue serostatus (477 out of 
3179 subjects), most were baseline seropositive (59.3%). In the endemic LatAm region, among subjects 
with an available dengue serostatus (52 out of 54 subjects), most were baseline seronegative (78.9%). 
More details on the demographic characteristics for individual studies can be found in Integrated Safety 
Analysis Report, Tables Part 2,Table 3.11.0.9 and in the individual CSRs.

the CYD dengue vaccine - SafAS Main Studies CYD Dengue Group 
The  CHMP  noted  that  3233  children  aged  6  to  8  years  were  included  in  the  following  studies:  CYD05 
(Philippines), CYD06 (Mexico), CYD22 (Vietnam), CYD24 (Peru), CYD28 (Singapore), CYD23 (Thailand), 
CYD32 (Malaysia), and CYD14 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam). The majority (3179 
children)  were  from  endemic  Asia  Pacific  (AP),  and  all  the  subjects  who  provided  ethnicity  data  were 
Asian (i.e. no ethnic origin data collected for the 54 children in the LatAm region). 
Among  subjects  from  the  combined  regions  with  an  available  dengue  serostatus  (529  out  of  3233 
subjects), 294 were baseline seropositive (55.6%).

Clinical safety in children aged 6 to 8 years 
2.3.1.1.  Adverse events 
Safety Overview After Any Injection 
In subjects aged 6 to 8 years, no immediate AEs were reported after any injection of the CYD dengue 
vaccine (table below). 
Solicited injection site reactions were reported in slightly more than half of the subjects (56.1%) and 
few  (0.4%)  subjects  experienced  an  injection  site  reaction  of  Grade  3  intensity.  Solicited  systemic 
reactions were reported in 67.5% of subjects and 5.7% of subjects experienced systemic reactions of 
Grade 3 intensity. Unsolicited non-serious ARs were reported in 3.1% of subjects and a single (0.1%) 
subject had one Grade 3 reaction (vomiting). 
No anaphylactic reactions (SMQ algorithm), no serious allergic reactions, and a few non-serious allergic 
reactions (6 subjects, 0.8%) were reported. No subjects were identified with a potential post-vaccination 
dengue-like syndrome. 
SAEs within 28 days after any injection occurred in 41 (1.3%) subjects and a single (< 0.1%) subject 
had  1  SAE  assessed  as  related  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the  Investigator  (acute  disseminated 
encephalomyelitis). Among the 181 subjects that reported SAEs between 28 days and 6 months post-
injection, none experienced a related SAE. 
There were no deaths within 6 months after any injection.

The CHMP considered that, overall, in children from 6 to 8 years regardless of baseline dengue serostatus 
(after any 3 doses), the safety profiles of the CYD dengue vaccine were similar to the placebo and control 
groups. 
However, in the reactogenicity subset, slightly higher percentages were observed for: 
- solicited reactions (76.5% vs. 70.5% vs. 70.5%, respectively), solicited systemic reactions (67.5% vs. 
60.8% vs. 59.5%) 
- unsolicited non-serious AR (3.1% vs. 1.8% vs. 1.6%), unsolicited non-serious injection site AR (1.6% 
vs. 1.1% vs. 0.8%), unsolicited non-serious systemic AR (1.8% vs. 0.7% vs. 0.8%) 
- non-serious allergic reactions – targeted list (0.8% vs. 0.4% vs. 0.3%) 
Nevertheless, slightly lower or similar percentage were observed for:  
- grade 3 solicited reactions (5.9% vs. 9% vs. 8.4%, respectively),  
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021

- solicited injection site reaction, all (56.1% vs. 54.3% vs. 55.9%) and grade 3 
- grade 3 solicited systemic reactions (5.7% vs. 8.6% vs. 7%) 
- unsolicited non-serious AE (43.8% vs. 44.2% vs. 45.7%), grade 3 unsolicited non-serious AR (0.1% - 
1  case:  vomiting-  vs.  0%  vs.  0%),  no  grade  3  unsolicited  non-serious  injection  site  AR,  grade  3 
unsolicited non-serious systemic AR (0.1% vs. 0% vs. 0%) 
- no grade 3 non-serious allergic reactions – targeted list 
There  were  no  immediate  unsolicited  AE/AR,  no  anaphylactic  reaction  (SMQ)  and  no  post-vaccination 
dengue-like syndrome in the 3 groups. 
In the safety analysis set, slightly lower or similar percentages were observed for: discontinuation due 
to AE (0.2% vs. 0.8% vs. 0.8%), SAE ≤ 28 days (1.3% vs. 1.9% vs. 1.8%), SAE > 28 days to 6 months 
post  dose  (5.6%  vs.  7%  vs.  6.9%),  related  SAE  ≤  28  days  (<0.1%  -  1  case:  acute  disseminated

0.2%), neurological disorder SAE > 30 days to 6 months (0.1% vs. 0.3% vs. 0.3%), and death within 6 
months (0% vs. 0.3% vs. 0.3%). 
There were no serious allergic reactions (targeted list), no related SAE > 28 days to 6 months post dose, 
and no related death within 6 months in the 3 groups.

The  CHMP  considered  that,  overall,  the  safety  profile  in  seropostive  subjects  aged  6  to  8  years  was 
similar to the one in subjects aged 6 to 8 years regardless of the baseline dengue serostatus. 
The trend toward a slightly higher incidence of solicited systemic reactions in the CYD dengue vaccine 
Group was also observed in baseline seropositive subjects (57.0% vs. 51.8% in PBO vs. 53.3% in control

group). A slightly higher incidence was also observed for grade 3 solicited systemic reactions (6.8% vs. 
4.5%  vs.  4.6%,  respectively).  Moreover,  in  baseline  dengue  seropositive  subjects,  there  was  a  trend 
toward a higher incidence of solicited injection site reactions in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (50.2% 
vs. 40.9% in PBO vs. 46.1% in control group). 
Overall,  in  baseline  seropositive  subjects,  there  were  no  other  major  differences  in  the  incidence 
reactogenicity and safety events between the CYD dengue vaccine Group and the Placebo and Control 
Groups. 
Solicited injection site reactions and solicited systemic reactions were observed at a lower frequencies 
in dengue seropositive subjects (50.2% and 57%, respectively) compared to all subjects  regardless of 
baseline  dengue  serostatus  (56.1%  and  67.5%,  respectively).  Unsolicited  non-serious  AE  (mainly 
systemic) were also observed at a lower frequencies in dengue seropositive subjects (37.4%) compared 
to all subjects regardless of baseline dengue serostatus (43.8%).

The CHMP noted that, regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, the incidence of most parameters tended 
to decrease with each subsequent injection, most notably solicited injection reactions (35.9%, 34.1%, 
and  32.0%),  solicited  systemic  reactions  (48.4%,  40.2%,  and  33.2%),  unsolicited  non-serious  AEs 
(25.4%, 21.0%, and 16.1%) and unsolicited non-serious systemic AE (25.1%, 20.7%, and 15.7%). 
Immediate  AEs  and  ARs,  anaphylactic  reactions  (SMQ),  non-serious  and  serious  potential  allergic 
reactions, post-vaccination dengue-like syndrome, discontinuation due to AEs, SAEs within 28 days, and 
neurological disorder SAEs were reported at low frequencies after each injection (i.e. between 0.0% and 
0.7%). 
Similarly, in baseline seropositive subjects, the incidence of most parameters tended to decrease with 
each  subsequent  injection,  most  notably  solicited  injection  reactions  (31.2%,  27.7%,  and  27.4%), 
solicited systemic reactions (40.3%, 29.8%, and 26.7%), unsolicited non-serious AEs (21.8%, 15.6% 
and 13%) and unsolicited non-serious systemic AE (21.4%, 15.2%, and 13%). 
Immediate  AEs  and  ARs,  anaphylactic  reactions  (SMQ),  non-serious  and  serious  potential  allergic 
reactions, post-vaccination dengue-like syndrome, discontinuation due to AEs, SAEs within 28 days, and 
neurological disorder SAEs were reported at low frequencies after each injection (i.e. between 0.0% and 
1%).

studies using other vaccination schedules than the final 3-dose schedule) will not be discussed in this 
report as the number of subjects in the Secondary Studies was very low compared to that in the Main 
Studies (20 versus 768 subjects). 
Similarly,  the  comparison  will  not  be  done  with  the  safety  profile  after  a  first  injection  of  comparator 
vaccines  (hepatitis  A,  meningococcal,  pneumococcal,  rabies,  typhoid,  YF),  as  among  studies  in  which 
comparator  vaccines  were  administered,  the  ones  with  the  highest  number  of  subjects  receiving  a 
comparator vaccine were CYD23 (26 subjects; rabies), CYD24 (25 subjects; pneumococcal), and CYD28 
(28 subjects; hepatitis A).  
Immediate adverse events 
In subjects aged 6 to 8 years, no immediate unsolicited AEs were reported in any of the 3 treatment 
groups.  
Solicited local reaction 
After Any Injection 
Solicited  injection  site  reactions  within  7  days  after  any  CYD  dengue  vaccine,  placebo,  or  control 
injection, regardless of baseline serostatus, are presented by maximum intensity in table below.

Table  10:  Solicited  injection  site  reactions  after  any  of  3  doses  of  CYD  dengue  vaccine  or 
Placebo or Control, regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, by maximum intensity during 
the solicited period - Subjects 6 to 8 years - RS Main Studies Pooled 
The CHMP noted that, in children from 6 to 8 years regardless of baseline dengue serostatus (after any 
3  doses),  solicited  injection  site  reactions  were  reported  with  similar  frequencies  in  the  CYD  dengue 
vaccine  (56.1%),  Placebo  (54.3%),  and  Control  Groups  (55.9%).  Similarly,  the  3  types  of  solicited 
injection  site  reactions  were  reported  with  similar  frequencies  in  each  group.  In  each  of  them,  pain 
(51.4%, 48.9%, and 51.4% of subjects, respectively) was the most frequently reported injection site 
reactions,  followed  by  erythema  (21.7%,  24.1%,  and  22.7%,  respectively),  and  swelling  (16.2%, 
16.5%, 16.5%, respectively). 
Most  solicited  injection  site  reactions  were  Grade  1,  occurred  within  3  days  after  injection  and  had 
between 1 and 3 days of occurrence.  
In CYD dengue vaccine group, a total of 3 (0.4%) subjects experienced 4 Grade 3 injection site reactions: 
a subject reported Grade 3 injection site pain after the second injection, another subject reported Grade 
3 injection site pain after the third injection, and the last subject reported Grade 3 injection site pain 
and swelling after the third injection.  
As seen before, in baseline seropositive subjects, there was a trend toward a higher incidence of solicited 
injection site reactions in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (50.2% vs. 40.9% in PBO vs. 46.1% in control 
group). Pain in particular has a higher incidence in the CYD dengue vaccine group (46.1%) compared to 
PBO  (37.3%)  and  control  group  (42.8%).  The  2  other  types  of  solicited  injection  site  reactions  were 
reported with similar frequencies in each group: erythema (14.3%, 14.5%, and 15.8%, respectively), 
and swelling (12.7%, 9.1%, 11.2%, respectively).  
In dengue seropositive subjects, all solicited injection site reactions, pain, erythema and swelling were 
observed at a lower frequencies compared to all subjects regardless of baseline dengue serostatus.

After each Injection of the CYD dengue vaccine 
The incidence of solicited injection site reactions within 7 days after each CYD dengue vaccine dose is 
presented in table below. 
Table 11: Solicited injection site reactions after each CYD dengue vaccine dose, regardless of 
baseline dengue serostatus, by maximum intensity during the solicited period – Subjects 6 to 
8 years - RS Main Studies Pooled 
The CHMP noted that, overall, in children from 6 to 8 years regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, 
the  incidence  of  solicited  injection  site  reactions  tended  to  decrease  very  slightly  after  each  injection 
(35.9%, 34.1%, and 32% after the first, second, and third dose, respectively). However, the incidence 
of each solicited injection site reactions tended to be similar after each injection: pain (31%, 31%, and 
28.4% of subjects after the first, second and third dose, respectively), erythema (9.9%, 10.1%, 10.1%, 
respectively), and swelling (7.9%, 6.8%, and 7.9%, respectively). 
In baseline seropositive subjects, the incidence of solicited injection site reactions tended to decrease 
very  slightly  after  each  injection  (31.2%,  27.7%,  and  27.4%  after  the  first,  second,  and  third  dose, 
respectively), and also the incidence of each solicited injection site reactions: pain (27.4%, 25.3%, and 
25.3% of subjects after the first, second and third dose, respectively), erythema (7.2%, 6.9%, 4.9%, 
respectively), and swelling (7.2%, 4.8%, and 4.2%, respectively. 
Solicited systemic reaction 
After Any Injection 
Solicited systemic reactions within 14 days after any CYD dengue vaccine, placebo, or control injection 
are presented in children aged 6 to 8 years in the Main Studies (RS), regardless of baseline serostatus, 
by maximum intensity in the table below.

or  Control,  regardless  of  baseline  dengue  serostatus,  by  maximum  intensity  during  the 
solicited period - Subjects 6 to 8 years - RS Main Studies Pooled 
As previously observed, the CHMP noted that in children from 6 to 8 years regardless of baseline dengue 
serostatus (after any 3 doses), there was a trend toward a higher incidence of solicited systemic reactions 
in the CYD dengue vaccine (67.5%) compared to Placebo (60.8%), and Control Groups (59.5%). Myalgia 
in  particular  has  an  higher  incidence  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  group  (40.1%)  compared  to  PBO 
(34.5%)  and  control  group  (34.6%).  Malaise  has  also  a  slightly  higher  incidence  in  the  CYD  dengue 
vaccine  group  (44.2%  vs.  39.2%  vs.  38.6%,  respectively).  The  3  other  types  of  solicited  systemic 
reactions  were  reported  with  similar  frequencies  in  each  groups:  headache  (51.5%,  48.9%,  47.8%, 
respectively),  asthenia  (32.8%  vs.  32.4%  vs.  29.2%),  and  fever  (19.6%,  18.7%,  and  15.7%, 
respectively). 
Most solicited systemic reactions were Grade 1, occurred within 3 days after injection (except for fever, 
which appeared throughout the solicited period) and had between 1 and 3 days of occurrence.  
In CYD dengue vaccine group, grade 3 reactions were reported in 1.0% (myalgia) to 3.1% (fever) of 
subjects, depending on solicited reaction. Grade 3 fever occurred throughout the solicited period D0 to 
D14  and  resolved  after  1  to  3  days  of  occurrence,  spontaneously,  after  a  medication  or  health  care 
provider contact or a combination of both.  
As seen before, in baseline seropositive subjects, there was a trend toward a higher incidence of solicited 
systemic reactions in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (57% vs. 51.8% in PBO vs. 53.3% in control group), 
and of grade 3 solicited systemic reactions (6.8% vs. 4.5% vs. 4.6%, respectively).

All  grade  myalgia  in  particular  has  an  higher  incidence  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  group  (32.9%) 
compared to PBO (22.7%) and control group (26.3%). Fever has also a slightly higher incidence in the 
CYD dengue vaccine group (19.1% vs. 12.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively). The 3 other types of solicited 
systemic  reactions  were  reported  with  similar  frequencies  in  each  groups:  headache  (42.5%,  41.8%, 
43.4%, respectively), malaise (34.9%, 30.9%, and 32.9%) and asthenia (24.3%, 22.7%, and 25.0%). 
Grade 3 myalgia has a slightly higher incidence in the CYD dengue vaccine group (0.7%) compared to 
PBO (0%) and control group (0%). Grade 3 fever has also a slightly higher incidence in the CYD dengue 
vaccine group (3.8% vs. 1.8% vs. 2%, respectively). The 3 other types of grade 3 solicited systemic 
reactions  were  reported  with  similar  frequencies  in  each  groups:  headache  (2.7%,  2.7%,  2.6%, 
respectively), malaise (0.7%, 1.8%, and 1.3%) and asthenia (0.7%, 1.8%, and 1.3%).  
In dengue seropositive subjects, solicited systemic reactions, headache, malaise, myalgia, asthenia and 
fever  were  observed  at  a  lower  frequencies  compared  to  all  subjects  regardless  of  baseline  dengue 
serostatus. 
After each Injection of the CYD dengue vaccine 
The  incidence  of  solicited  systemic  reactions  within  14  days  after  each  CYD  dengue  vaccine  dose  is 
presented in table below.

Overall, the CHMP considered that in children from 6 to 8 years regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, 
the incidence of solicited systemic reactions tended to decrease after each injection (48.4%, 40.2%, and 
33.2%  after  the  first,  second,  and  third  dose,  respectively).  Similarly,  the  incidence  of  each  solicited 
systemic reactions tended to decrease after each injection: headache (35.6%, 26.3%, 21.8% of subjects 
after the first, second and third dose, respectively), malaise (27.1%, 22.7%, and 18.5%, respectively) 
and myalgia (23.6%, 22% and 18.4%), and fever (9%, 8.7%, and 5.2%). Grade 3 solicited systemic 
reaction after any single injection occurred at a frequency equal or below 1.8%. The incidence of Grade 
3 fever, the most frequently reported Grade 3 reaction, tended to decrease with subsequent injection. 
In baseline seropositive subjects, the incidence of solicited systemic reactions tended to decrease from 
one injection to the other in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (40.3%, 29.8%, and 26.7% after the first, 
second, and third dose, respectively). The incidence of fever (7.5%, 7.6%, and 5.3% of subjects after 
the first, second and third dose, respectively), headache (26.7%, 20.5%, 18.9%, respectively), malaise 
(22.3%,  15.3%,  and  14.4%,  respectively),  myalgia  (18.6%,  17.0%,  and  13.3%,  respectively),  and 
asthenia (14.0%, 11.1%, and 10.2%, respectively) tended to decrease from one injection to the other. 
Unsolicited non-serious adverse events and reactions 
Unsolicited non-serious AE 
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group, 336 (43.8%) subjects aged 6 to 8 years experienced unsolicited non-
serious AEs within 28 days after any injection. 
The nature of these AEs in terms of SOCs and PTs could be expected given the age group of the subjects. 
The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious AEs were in the SOCs “Infections and infestations” 
(28.9%), “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” (8.9%), “Gastrointestinal disorders” (7.4%), 
“General disorders and administration site conditions” (4.3%), and “Injury, poisoning, and procedural 
complications” (2.5%). The incidence was < 2.5% in the remaining SOCs.  
The incidence of unsolicited non-serious AEs tended to decrease with subsequent injections. 
Most unsolicited non-serious AEs were Grade 1 and 2, tended to occur either between D0-D3 (13.7%) 
or ≥ 15 days (13.4%), and had a duration ranging from 1 day to ≤ 8 days. Grade 3 AEs were reported 
in 2.6% of subjects. The most frequent Grade 3 were in the SOCs “Infections and infestations” (1.6%), 
“Gastrointestinal disorders” (0.7%), and “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” (0.3%). The 
incidence was equal or below 0.1% in the remaining SOCs.  
In  the  Placebo  Group,  the  incidence  of  unsolicited  non-serious  AEs  within  28  days  after  any  injection 
(44.2%) was similar to that reported in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (43.8%). Similar to what was 
observed in the CYD dengue vaccine Group, the most frequently reported AEs in the Placebo Group were 
in  the  SOCs  “Infections  and  infestations”  (29.1%),  “Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders” 
(9.4%), “Gastrointestinal disorders” (6.5%), and “General disorders and administration site conditions” 
(4.7%). The incidence was < 3.0% in the remaining SOCs. The incidence of Grade 3 unsolicited non-
serious AEs in the Placebo Group was 4.3%.  
In  the  Control  Group,  the  incidence  of  unsolicited  non-serious  AEs  within  28  days  after  any  injection 
(45.7%) was similar to that reported in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (43.1%). Similar to what was 
observed in both the CYD dengue vaccine and Placebo Groups, the most frequently reported AEs in the 
Control  Group  were  in  the  SOCs  “Infections  and  infestations”  (31.4%),  “Respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal  disorders”  (8.9%),  “Gastrointestinal  disorders”  (7.6%),  and  “General  disorders  and 
administration site conditions” (4.3%). The incidence was < 3.0% in the remaining SOCs. The incidence 
of Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious AEs in the Control Group was 3.5%.  
Assessment report

In baseline seropositive subjects, the incidence of unsolicited non-serious AEs after any of 3 doses in the 
CYD  dengue  vaccine  Placebo,  and  Control  Groups  was  37.4%,  40.9%,  and  45.4%,  respectively.  The 
incidence of unsolicited non-serious AEs in the CYD dengue vaccine Group tended to decrease after each 
subsequent injection with 21.8% of subjects after the first injection, 15.6% after the second injection, 
and 13.0% after the third injection.  
Unsolicited non-serious AR 
Unsolicited non-serious ARs within 28 days after any CYD dengue vaccine, placebo or control injection 
are presented for children aged 6 to 8 years in the Main Studies in table below. ARs occurring in at least 
2  (0.3%)  subjects  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group  are  displayed  in  the  table  for  the  CYD  dengue 
vaccine, Placebo and Control Groups. In addition, each SOC with an incidence of ≥ 0.3%, even if ARs in 
this SOC are reported in less than 0.3% of subjects, is presented in the table.

vaccine or Placebo Control, regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, by maximum intensity, 
maximum duration and earliest time to onset - Subjects 6 to 8 years - RS Main Studies Pooled 
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group, a total of 3.1% of subjects experienced unsolicited nonserious ARs 
within 28 days after any CYD dengue vaccine injection. 
The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs after any CYD dengue vaccine injection were 
vomiting (0.9%), injection site hemorrhage, injection site induration, decreased appetite (0.4% each), 
and injection site bruising (0.3%). The other PTs accounted for less than 0.3% each. 
The proportion of subjects with unsolicited non-serious ARs was similar after each subsequent injection 
with 2.0%, 1.1%, and 0.5% after the first, second, and third injection, respectively. 
Most unsolicited non-serious ARs were Grade 1 or 2, tended to occur either between D0-D3, and had a 
duration ranging from 1 to 3 days. One of these ARs led to study discontinuation (a Grade 2 urticaria; 
see section 2.3.1.1. ). 
A single (0.1%) subject experienced a Grade 3 vomiting: a 7-year-old subject (Subject 004-10038 in 
CYD32) experienced Grade 3 vomiting on D1 after the third injection. The event resolved spontaneously 
after 2 days.  
The CHMP considered that, of note, vomiting is an identified ADR of dengvaxia for children. 
In the Placebo Group, unsolicited non-serious ARs tended to be reported at a frequency (5 subjects, 1.8 
%) somewhat lower than in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (24 subjects, 3.1%). ARs were isolated in 
terms of nature as no PTs were reported in more than 1 subject. No Grade 3 ARs were reported in the 
Placebo Group. 
Assessment report

In the Control Group, unsolicited non-serious ARs were also reported at a lower frequency (6 subjects, 
1.6 %) than in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (24 subjects, 3.1%). ARs were isolated in terms of nature 
as no PTs were reported in more than 1 subject. No Grade 3 ARs were reported in the Control Group. 
There  were  2  occurrences  of  Nervous  system  disorder  AR  reported  in  subjects  aged  6  to  8  years; 
dizziness was experienced by 1 subject in the CYD dengue vaccine Group and headache was reported in 
1 subject from the Control Group. 
In  addition  to  the  intensity  grading,  all  ARs  were  reviewed  for  clinical  relevance  and  no  concern  was 
raised in the CYD dengue vaccine Group. 
In baseline seropositive subjects, the incidence of unsolicited non-serious ARs after any of 3 doses in the 
CYD  dengue  vaccine,  Placebo,  and  Control  Groups  was  1.7%,  2.7%,  and  2.0%,  respectively.  The 
incidence of unsolicited non-serious ARs tended to remain similar after each subsequent injection; with 
1.0% of subjects after the first and second injections and 0% after the third injection.  
2.3.1.2.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No death was reported in the CYD dengue vaccine Group within 6 months after any injection in the Main 
Studies. 
In the Placebo / Control Group, 5 (0.3%) deaths occurred in the Main Studies within 6 months after any 
injection  (acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia,  drowning,  head  injury,  T-cell  lymphoma,  and  road  traffic 
accident). None were assessed as related to the injection by the Investigator or the Sponsor.  
In All Studies, no additional deaths were reported  in the CYD dengue vaccine Group within 6 months 
after any injection.  
Deaths that occurred more than 6 months after the last injection were presented. None were assessed 
as related to the study vaccination. 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs,  including  related  SAEs,  during  the  LTFU,  i.e.  more  than  6  months  after  the  last  injection  were 
presented, and so were SAEs leading to study discontinuation. 
SAEs Within 28 Days After Any of 3 Doses 
SAEs that occurred within 28 days after any injection in children aged 6 to 8 years, regardless of baseline 
serostatus, are displayed in Table below. SAEs reported in at least 0.1% of subjects in the CYD dengue 
vaccine Group are displayed for the CYD dengue vaccine, Placebo, and Control Groups. In addition, each 
SOC with an incidence of ≥ 0.1%, even if SAEs in this SOC are reported in less than 0.1% of subjects, 
is presented in the following table.

Table  16:  All  and  related  SAEs  <=  28  days  after  any  of  3  doses  of  CYD  dengue  vaccine  or 
Placebo or Control, regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, by main SOC and PT - Subjects 
6 to 8 years - SafAS Main Studies Pooled 
A total of 41 out of 3233 (1.3%) subjects aged 6 to 8 years in the CYD dengue vaccine Group experienced 
44 SAEs within 28 days after any injection. The proportion of subjects who experienced at least 1 SAE 
was similar (or slightly less) to that observed in the Placebo and Control Groups with 1.9% and 1.8% of 
subjects experiencing SAEs, respectively. 
For the 41 subjects who experienced SAEs in the CYD dengue vaccine Group, all SAEs were considered 
as  serious  because  of  either  “required  or  prolonged  inpatient  hospitalization”  (39  subjects)  or  “other 
important medical event” (3 subjects). No deaths were reported and all subjects with an SAE occurring 
within 28 days after any injection recovered.  
In all 3 groups, most of the SAEs were in the SOC “Infections and infestations” with 0.6%, 1.3%, and 
1.2%  of  subjects  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine,  Placebo,  and  Control  Groups,  respectively.  In  the  CYD 
dengue vaccine Group, besides the SOCs “Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications” (0.2%) and 
“Gastrointestinal disorders” (0.1%), SAEs in other SOCs were all reported in less than 0.1% of subjects. 
In the CYD dengue vaccine group, in the SOC “Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications”, the 8 
SAEs were the following: epiphyseal injury, forearm fracture, foreign body, hand fracture, joint injury, 
road  traffic  accident,  snake  bite  and  traumatic  haemorrhage  (skin  laceration  in  placebo  group;  skin 
laceration and vulvovaginal injury in control group). In the SOC “Gastrointestinal disorders”, the 4 SAEs 
were  the  following:  4  gastritis  and  1  salivary  gland  mucocele  (2  gastritis  each  in  placebo  and  control 
groups). 
When considering each injection, there was a trend toward a decrease incidence of SAEs within 28 days 
with subsequent injections. The incidence of SAEs was 0.7%, 0.4%, and 0.3% after the first, second and 
third injection, respectively.  
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group, there was 1 (< 0.1%) neurological disorder SAE and it was the only 
SAE assessed as related to the study vaccine by the Investigator: an 8-year-old subject (Subject 220-
00332 in CYD14) experienced an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis on D7 after the first injection. 
The event lasted 14 days and led to discontinuation from the study. The subject fully recovered.  
In  the  Placebo  and  Control  Groups,  there  were  3  neurological  disorder  SAEs  reported  in  each  group 
(0.2% for each group): epilepsy, facial paralysis, and seizure were each reported once; facial paralysis 
in both groups was assessed as related to the injection by the Investigator or the Sponsor.

In  total,  in  each  of  the  Placebo  and  Control  Groups,  2  (0.1%)  subjects  experienced  SAEs  that  were 
assessed  as  related  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the  Investigator  or  by  the  Sponsor:  facial  paralysis  and 
angioedema.  
The  CHMP  noted  that  Subject  220-00332  presented  a  related  SAE  of  acute  disseminated 
encephalomyelitis  (ADEM)  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  group  7  days  after  the  first  study  vaccination. 
Vaccinal and wild-type dengue virus test was negative in serum, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. 
Therefore, a neurotropic disease with replication of the vaccinal virus in the CNS was excluded. 
Five subjects reported gastroenteritis SAE in the CYD dengue vaccine group within 9 to 27 days after 
the first or the second injection (compared to 1 gastroenteritis SAE each in placebo and control groups). 
The most common etiology of gastroenteritis in children is infectious (viral or bacterial origin). In these 
5  cases,  the  symptomatology,  the  course  of  the  disease,  investigations  (e.g.,  laboratory)  and  rapid 
resolution  after  initiation  of  treatment,  mainly  IV  fluids  and  antibiotics,  confirm  the  diagnosis  of 
gastroenteritis  of  infectious  origin  (bacteria,  except  two  with  possible  viral  etiology).  In  addition,  the 
absence of pattern in the latency period between onset of events and last CYD dengue vaccine does not 
raise suspicion on the role of the study vaccine. All gastroenteritis events were assessed to be not related 
to the study vaccine by the investigators, in agreement with the sponsor. 
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group in all studies, 41 out of 3253 (1.3%) subjects reported at least 1 SAE 
within  28  days  after  any  injection.  Compared  to  the  Main  Studies,  there  were  no  additional  SAEs  to 
report in the All Studies set.  
In baseline seropositive subjects (main studies), the incidence of SAE within 28 days after any 3 doses 
in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine,  Placebo,  and  Control  Groups  was  1.4%,  1.8%,  and  2.0%,  respectively 
(without any related SAE). In baseline seropositive subjects, the incidence of SAE within 28 days tended 
to  remain  similar  after  each  subsequent  injection;  with  1.0%  of  subjects  after  the  first, 0%  after  the 
second injection, and 0.4% after the third injection.  
SAEs more than 28 Days and up to 6 months After Any of 3 Doses 
SAEs that occurred after 28 days and up to 6 months after any injection in children aged 6 to 8 years, 
regardless of baseline serostatus, are displayed in Table below. SAEs reported in at least 0.1% of subjects 
in the CYD dengue vaccine Group are displayed for the CYD dengue vaccine, Placebo, and Control Groups.

A  total  of  181  out  of  3233  (5.6%)  subjects  aged  6  to  8  years  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group 
experienced 197 SAEs after 28 days and up to 6 months after any injection, which was less that in the 
Placebo Group (105 subjects reported a total of 125 SAEs - 7%) and in the control group (a total of 110 
subjects experienced 130 SAEs – 6.9%). 
For the 181 subjects who experienced SAEs in the CYD dengue vaccine Group, all SAEs were considered 
as  serious  because  of  either  “required  or  prolonged  inpatient  hospitalization”  (179  subjects)  and/or 
“other important medical event” (5 subjects). 
Within 6 months after any injection, there were no deaths reported in the CYD dengue vaccine Group. 
Most subjects with SAEs after 28 days and up to 6 months after any injection recovered. One subject 
recovered with sequelae from an SAE (road traffic accident) while another subject’s SAE (epilepsy) was 
ongoing.  
In the 3 groups, most of the SAEs were in the SOC Infections and infestations (3.6% of subjects in the 
CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group;  4.5%  and  4.4%  in  the  Placebo  and  Control  Groups,  respectively), 
“Gastrointestinal disorders” (1.0% in the CYD dengue vaccine Group; 0.8% in the Placebo and Control 
Groups), “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (0.7% in the CYD dengue vaccine Group; 0.8% 
in the Placebo and Control Groups), and “Nervous system disorders” (0.1% in the CYD dengue vaccine 
Group; 0.3% in the Placebo and Control Groups). In the CYD dengue vaccine Group, SAEs in the other 
SOCs were all reported in ≤ 0.1% of subjects.  
The incidence of SAEs after each injection tended to be similar with 1.9%, 2.3%, and 1.7% after the 
first, second and third injection, respectively.

In the CYD dengue vaccine Group, 4 (0.1%) neurological disorder SAEs were reported. Each PT were 
reported once (epilepsy, febrile convulsion, ischemic stroke, and seizure) and none were  assessed as 
related to the study vaccine. In the Placebo and Control Groups, there were also 4 neurological disorder 
SAEs reported in each group (0.3% for each group). Epilepsy, febrile convulsion, ischemic stroke, and 
seizure were each reported once. None was assessed as related to the injection by the Investigator or 
the Sponsor. 
No  SAEs  were  assessed  as  related  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the  Investigator  between  28  days  and  6 
months after any injection in any of the groups.  
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group in all studies, 181 out of 3253 (5.6%) subjects reported at least 1 SAE 
after  28  days  and  up  to  6  months  after  any  injection.  Compared  to  the  Main  Studies,  there  were  no 
additional SAEs to report in the All Studies set.  
In baseline seropositive subjects (main studies), the incidence of SAEs after 28 days and up to 6 months 
after any injection in the CYD dengue vaccine, Placebo, and Control Groups was 5.8%, 5.5%, and 5.3%, 
respectively. The incidence of SAE after 28 days and up to 6 months after injection tended to remain 
similar after each subsequent injection; with 3.1% of subjects after the first, and 1.4% after the second 
and third injections.  
The CHMP noted that four subjects presented a neurological disorder SAE (epilepsy, febrile convulsion, 
ischemic stroke, and seizure) in the CYD dengue vaccine group after 30 days and up to 6 months after 
any injection (0.1%). There were also 4 neurological disorder SAEs reported respectively in Placebo and 
Control Group (0.3% for each group). All neurological disorder SAEs were assessed as not related to the 
study vaccine per investigator and sponsor. 
These  4  cases  of  neurological  disorders  (epilepsy,  febrile  convulsion,  ischemic  stroke  and  seizure) 
occurred in children from 7 to 9 years old. The febrile convulsion was caused by a spike at 40.2°C in 
body temperature, from infectious origin. The epilepsy event was diagnosed and occurred with a long 
latency (91 days) after receiving the second dose of CYD dengue vaccine. For the seizure event, although 
the cause of this seizure episode was not identified, the child experienced this episode for the first time 
with a long latency (more than five and half months) after 3rd vaccine injection. No other episode was 
reported for this child during the study (safety follow-up for 36 months after the 3rd injection). 
The last neurological disorder was an ischemic stroke with unclear etiology. However, clinical symptoms, 
symptoms chronology, investigations results and long latency (> 5 months) after 2nd vaccine injection 
are not suggestive of a link with the vaccine. 
Six subjects reported cellulitis SAE in the CYD dengue vaccine group (0.2%) after 28 days and up to 6 
months after any injection (compared to no subject with cellulitis SAE in placebo and control groups). 
In all these cases, cellulitis can be explained by alternative etiology (infected impetigo, insect bite, dental 
root abscess, green pit viper bite, after accident/fall). The nature, the chronology of the disease and the 
long latency (> 2 months) after last CYD dengue vaccine injection is not suggestive of any relationship 
to the study vaccine. Also, the recovery of the events after corrective treatment (including antibiotics), 
is suggestive of infectious in nature. All events were assessed to be not related to the study vaccine by 
the investigators, in agreement with the sponsor. 
2.3.1.1.  AE leading to discontinuation (withdrawn from further injections) 
In the main Studies (SafAS: 3233 subjects and RS: 768 subjects), as per the information reported in 
the  termination  form,  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  discontinued  due  to  a  non-serious  AE  or  a  SAE 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 62/116 
 
 
 
tended to be lower in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (0.2%; 8 subjects) compared to that in the Placebo 
/ Control Group (0.8% ; 12 subjects each). 
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group, 4 subjects discontinued due to non-serious AEs. Among these, one 
subject discontinued due to a Grade 2 urticaria after the second injection. For the remaining 3 subjects 
that discontinued due to non-serious AEs, AEs were not detailed in an AE form but were mentioned in 
the Investigator's comment of the termination form of the CRF as the reason for study discontinuation. 
These AEs were identified as: illness after vaccination, generalized itching rash, and urticaria. 
In  the  Placebo  Group,  2  subjects  discontinued  due  to  unsolicited  non-serious  AEs.  One  subject 
discontinued due to a Grade 1 hypersensitivity after the second injection; the AE was assessed as related 
to placebo injection by Investigator. For the other subject, the non-serious AE of “frequent fever” was 
mentioned  in  the  Investigator’s  comment  of  the  CRF  termination  form  as  the  reason  for  study 
discontinuation.  
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group, SAEs leading to discontinuation after any injection were reported in 
4 subjects. No trend was observed regarding the distribution of SAEs within the different SOCs. At the 
PT level, most SAEs were isolated in terms of nature and were reported as isolated events: rheumatic 
heart disease, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, ischemic stroke, and nephrotic syndrome. Among 
these SAEs, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was assessed as related to the study vaccine by the 
Investigator or the Sponsor. 
In  the  Placebo  Group,  SAEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation  after  any  injection  were  reported  in  10 
subjects. No trend was observed regarding the distribution of SAEs within the different SOCs. At the PT 
level, most SAEs were isolated in terms of nature and were reported as isolated events: angioedema 
with  generalized  urticaria,  ischemic  stroke,  acute  lymphocytic  leukemia,  epilepsy,  encephalitis, 
drowning, T-cell lymphoma, road traffic accident, head injury, and facial paralysis. Among these SAEs, 
angioedema with generalized urticaria and facial paralysis were assessed as related to placebo injection 
by the Investigator.  
In all Studies (SafAS: 3253 subjects and RS: 788 subjects), in the CYD dengue vaccine Group, 
compared to the Main Studies, 1 additional subject was discontinued due to a non-serious AE 
(eosinophilia assessed as not related to study vaccine). There were no additional SAEs leading to study 
discontinuation.  
2.3.2.  Comparison to safety overview in subjects aged 9 to 17 years 
Safety Overview After Any Injection 
A safety overview for the Main Studies in which the CYD dengue vaccine was administered as a 3-dose 
schedule (injection at 6-month intervals) is presented for children/adolescents aged 9 to 17 years after 
any CYD dengue vaccine, placebo, or control injection in table below.

Table 18: Safety overview after any of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine or Placebo or Control, 
regardless of baseline dengue serostatus - Subjects 9 to 17 years - SafAS Main Studies Pooled 
When comparing the safety overview in children from 6 to 8 years old to the safety overview in children 
from  9  to  17  years  old  (after  any  of  3  doses  of  CYD  dengue  vaccine,  regardless  of  baseline  dengue 
serostatus), the CHMP considered the following: 
- Similar frequencies in the 2 populations: solicited reactions, solicited systemic reactions, unsolicited 
AE/AR (non-serious and grade 3), unsolicited injections site AR (non-serious and grade 3), unsolicited 
systemic AE/AR (non-serious and grade 3), anaphylactic reaction (SMQ), allergic reactions (targeted list: 
non-serious  and  grade  3),  post-vaccination  dengue-like  syndrome,  discontinuation  due  to  AE,  serious 
allergic reactions (target list); related SAE (≤ 28 days and >28 days to 6 months post dose), neurological 
disorders SAE (≤30 days and >30 days to 6 months post dose), and related death within 6 months. 
- Increase with age increase: immediate unsolicited AE and AR (all and grade 3: none in children from 
6 to 8 years to several in children from 9 to 17 years), grade 3 solicited reactions (from 5.9% to 11.1%), 
grade 3 solicited injection site reactions (from 0.4% to 1.5%), grade 3 solicited systemic reactions (from 
5.7% to 10.4%), and death within 6 months (from none to <0.1% - 5 deaths). 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 64/116 
 
 
 
 
 
- Decrease with age increase: solicited injection site reactions (from 56.1% to 51.6%), SAE ≤ 28 days 
(from 1.3% to 0.6%) and SAE >28 days to 6 months post dose (from 5.6% to 2.8%). 
The observed differences could be due to chance-finding due the differences in the number of subjects 
compared: children from 6 to 8 years (SafAS: 3233 subjects and RS: 768 subjects) and children from 9 
to 17 years (SafAS: 19715 subjects and RS: 3666 subjects). 
Overall, no major differences are observable between the reactogenicity and the safety profile in children 
from 6 to 8 years old and children from 9 to 17 years old (population in which the vaccine is currently 
licensed) after any of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine, regardless of baseline dengue serostatus. 
Conclusion 
In both age groups (6 to 8 years and 9 to 17 years), the incidence of most parameters tended to decrease 
with each subsequent injection in all subjects regardless of the baseline serostatus and in seropositive 
subjects. Overall, no major differences were observed between the 2 age groups in the reactogenicity 
and safety profile of the CYD dengue vaccine after each CYD dengue vaccine injection. 
2.3.3.  Comparison to safety overview in subjects aged 2 to 5 years 
Safety Overview in Subjects Aged 2 to 5 Years 
A safety overview for the Main Studies in which the CYD dengue vaccine was administered as a 3-dose 
schedule (injections at 6-months intervals) was presented for subjects aged 2 to 5 years, regardless of 
baseline dengue serostatus, after any CYD dengue vaccine, Placebo, or Control injection  
Safety Overview in Subjects Aged 2 to 5 Years 
Comparison  between  subjects  aged  6  to  8  years  and  2  to  5  years,  regardless  of  baseline  dengue 
serostatus 
The CHMP considered that, after any of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine, regardless of baseline dengue 
serostatus, there was a trend toward a slightly higher incidence after any injection in the 6 to 8 years 
age group compared to the 2 to 5 years age group for: 
- Solicited injection site reactions (56.1% vs. 52.9%, respectively). However, Grade 3 solicited injection 
site reactions were reported by a similar percentage of subjects in both age  groups (0.4% vs. 0.2%, 
respectively). 
-  Solicited  systemic  reactions  (67.5%  vs.  59.8%,  respectively).  However,  Grade  3  systemic  reactions 
were reported by a similar percentage of subjects in both age groups (5.7% vs. 6.9%, respectively). 
- Unsolicited non-serious ARs (3.1% vs. 1.8%). Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious ARs were reported by a 
low percentage of subjects after any injection in both age groups (≤ 0.2%). 
A slightly lower incidence was observed after any injection in the 6 to 8 years age group compared to 
the 2 to 5 years age group for the unsolicited non-serious AEs (43.8% vs. 50.9%, respectively). 
Overall, no major differences are observable between the reactogenicity and the safety profile in children 
from 6 to 8 years old and children from 2 to 5 years old after any of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine, 
regardless  of  baseline  dengue  serostatus.  The  incidence  of  SAEs  within  28  days  was  ≤  1.5%  and  the 
incidence of subjects discontinued due to an AE was 0.2% in both age groups. 
Comparison between subjects aged 6 to 8 years and 2 to 5 years, baseline dengue seropositive 
The trends observed in subjects regardless of baseline dengue serostatus tended to disappear in baseline 
dengue seropositive subjects. After any of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine, while comparing the 6 to 8 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 65/116 
 
 
 
years age group to the 2 to 5 years age group (baseline dengue seropositive subjects), similar incidence 
were observed for : 
- Solicited injection site reactions (50.2% vs. 48.4%, respectively). 
- Solicited systemic reactions (57% vs. 54.8%, respectively). 
- Unsolicited non-serious ARs (1.7% vs. 1.3%). 
However, a clear lower incidence was observed after any injection in the 6 to 8 years age group compared 
to the 2 to 5 years age group for the unsolicited non-serious AEs (37.1% vs. 51.9%, respectively) 
No major differences were observed in the frequencies of the other parameters, which were reported at 
low frequencies. For instance, the incidence of SAEs within 28 days was ≤ 1.4%, and the incidence of 
subjects discontinued due to an AE was 0.3% in both age groups. 
Conclusion 
The safety overview profile of the CYD dengue vaccine was similar in children aged 6 to 8 years and 2 
to 5 years. Of note, the vast majority of results assessing the risk for HVCD and SVCD in 2 to 5 years 
children were inconclusive and 1 of the methods showed an increased risk of SVCD with a HR estimate 
above 1; therefore, precluding the indication in this age group. 
2.3.4.  Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
2.3.4.1.  Allergic/Anaphylactic reactions in children aged 6 to 8 years 
No anaphylactic reactions occurred in children aged 6 to 8 years in the CYD dengue vaccine, placebo and 
control groups. 
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group, within 7 days after injection, regardless of baseline serostatus, a total 
of 6 subjects out of 768 (0.8%) experienced 6 potential non-serious allergic reactions: asthma, rah, rash 
macular and 3 urticaria. Among these events, 2 were considered as related  to the vaccine (0.3%): a 
Grade 1 rash after first injection and a Grade 2 urticaria after injection 2. All potential non-serious allergic 
reactions were either Grade 1 or Grade 2.  
In the placebo (0.4%) and the control group (0.3%), there was 1 non-serious allergic reaction each (1 
hypersensitivity each assessed as related).  
Overall, the proportion of subjects aged 6 to 8 years who experimented a potential non-serious allergic 
reaction tended to remain low and stable after each subsequent injection with 0.4%, 0.1%, and 0.3% 
after the first, second, and third injection, respectively.  
No subject experienced a serious allergic reaction in any of the 3 treatment groups.  
In all studies, compared to the Main Studies, no additional anaphylactic reactions and serious allergic 
reactions  occurred  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group.  One  additional  potential  non-serious  allergic 
reaction was reported in the CYD dengue vaccine Group in the CYD05 study: a Grade 2 asthma after the 
third injection. Overall, the proportion of subjects who reported at least 1 potential non-serious allergic 
reaction  was  similar  in  the  Main  Studies  and  All  Studies  sets  with  an  incidence  of  0.8%  and  0.9%, 
respectively.  
The CHMP considered that, In the safety overview in children from 9 to 17 years old (after any of 3 doses 
of CYD dengue vaccine, regardless of baseline dengue serostatus), there were no anaphylactic reactions, 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 66/116 
 
 
 
and 0.5% of non-serious allergic reaction (targeted list) in the CYD dengue vaccine group (including 1 
grade 3), 0.4% in placebo group and 0.7% in control group. 
2.3.4.2.  Viscerotropic and neurotropic events 
Among subjects aged 6 to 8 years at enrolment (regardless of serostatus), there were 3 subjects with 
suspected neurotropism: 
• A subject (Subject 220-00332 in CYD14) in the CYD dengue vaccine Group for whom the PT of the 
final  diagnosis  was  acute  disseminated  encephalomyelitis.  The  event  occurred  20  days  after  the  first 
injection and lasted 14 days. 
• A subject (Subject 115-00040 in CYD14) in the Placebo Group for whom the PT of the final diagnosis 
was seizure. The event occurred 28 days after the second placebo injection and lasted 3 days. The event 
was assessed as not related to study vaccination. 
• A subject (Subject 004-10009 in CYD32) in the Placebo Group for whom the PT of the final diagnosis 
was VIIth nerve paralysis. The event occurred 20 days after the first placebo injection and lasted 128 
days. The event was assessed as related to study vaccination. 
Among subjects aged 6 to 8 years, no suspected viscerotropism was reported. 
In conclusion, no events of viscerotropic or neurotropic disease were observed after administration of 
the CYD dengue vaccine in any studies. 
The  CHMP,  as  discussed  above  considered  that  subject  220-00332  presented  a  related  SAE  of  acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in the CYD dengue vaccine group 7 days after the first study 
vaccination.  Vaccinal  and  wild-type  dengue  virus  test  was  negative  in  serum,  blood,  urine  and 
cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, a neurotropic disease with replication of the vaccinal virus in the CNS was 
excluded. 
So far (neither from any study nor from post-marketing), no confirmed events of neurotropic disease 
(i.e. vaccinal virus detection in CNS) were observed after administration of the CYD dengue vaccine in 
any studies. Although this important potential risk remains theoretical, the MAH will continue to monitor 
neurotropic disease as part of its pharmacovigilance activities, as described in the RMP. Neurotropism 
occurring within 30 days after injection throughout trials had been defined as Adverse Events of Special 
Interest (AESI). 
2.3.4.3.  Severe dengue disease 
In  individual  studies,  SDD  was  defined  as  an  AESI,  i.e.  as  a  suspected  dengue  case  as  per  the 
Investigator  judgment,  regardless  of  severity  and  prior  to  virological  confirmation  with  the  following 
definition:  acute  febrile  illnesses  (temperature  ≥   38 ° C)  on  at  least  2  consecutive  days  requiring 
hospitalization (with bed attribution), and were to be collected during the entire study period. 
In the Phase III studies included the integrated safety analysis, serious/severe dengue diseases (SDDs) 
were  collected  in  CYD32, CYD14,  CYD15,  CYD67, and  CYD71  for  subjects  aged  9  to  17  years,  and  in 
CYD32 and CYD14 for subjects aged 6 to 8 years. SDDs were collected up to 6 months post-injection 3 
in CYD32, CYD67, and CYD71, and up to 60 months post-injection 3 in CYD14 and CYD15. Due to the 
difference  in  the  time  period  of  collection,  the  frequency  of  SDDs  by  baseline  dengue  serostatus  is 
presented by study for the 2 age groups in Table below. For CYD67 and CYD71, which evaluated the 
coadministration  of  human  papillomavirus  vaccine  with  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine,  only  the  sequential 
groups were considered in the integrated safety analysis and are presented in the Table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 67/116 
 
 
 
Of note, in most of these cases, the diagnosis of SDD was made at hospital admission by clinicians that 
were not part of the trial. Moreover, in instances where investigators were the clinicians assessing trial 
subjects, the assessment to determine whether they met the definition of SDD (see above) was made 
blinded to the group allocation of the subjects. 
In individual studies, AESI of SDD included all dengue disease assessed as serious per the Investigator, 
either virologically-confirmed or not. However, in the present integrated/pooled analyses, it was more 
relevant  for  the  Sponsor  to  focus  specifically  on  severe  VCD  cases  (as  systematically  assessed  for 
severity by the IDMC) instead of SDD.

The CHMP considered that: 
In  the  6  to  8  years  age  group,  all  SDDs  were  reported  in  CYD14  (none  in  CYD32).  In  all  subjects 
regardless of the baseline dengue serostatus, the frequency of SDDs tended to be slightly lower in the 
CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group  (3.8%  -  72  SDDs)  than  in  the  Placebo  Group  (5.6%  -  56  SDDs).  When 
considering  subjects  from  the  immunogenicity  subset,  the  frequency  of  SDDs  was  lower  in  the  CYD 
dengue  vaccine  Group  than  in  the  Placebo  group  in  seropositive  subjects  (3.6%  versus  10.2%),  and

higher  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group  than  in  the  Placebo  Group  in  seronegative  subjects  (6.0% 
versus 2.6%). 
In the 9 to 17 years age group, SDDs were reported in CYD14, CYD15, and CYD67 studies.  
In CYD67 study (sequential group), SDD frequency was low (0% in seropositive subjects, and 1.8% in 
seronegative subjects). 
In CYD14 and CYD15, the frequency of SDDs in all subjects regardless of the baseline dengue serostatus, 
tended to be slightly lower in the CYD dengue vaccine Group than in the Placebo Group (2.2% versus 
4.2%  in  CYD14,  and  0.7%  versus  1.4%  in  CYD15).  In  CYD14,  the  frequency  of  SDDs  tended  to  be 
slightly lower in the CYD dengue vaccine Group than in the Placebo Group in both seropositive subjects 
(1.0%  versus  3.6%)  and  seronegative  subjects  (3.9%  versus  10.2%),  among  subjects  from  the 
immunogenicity subset. In CYD15, the frequency of SDDs tended to be lower in the CYD dengue vaccine 
Group (0.8%) than in the Placebo Group (2.3%) in seropositive subjects, and higher in the CYD dengue 
vaccine Group (1.2%) than in the Placebo Group (0%) in seronegative subjects. 
Overall, in both treatment groups (CYD dengue vaccine or placebo), the frequency of SDDs tended to be 
lower in the 9 to 17 years than in the 6 to 8 years age group in seropositive subjects. The frequency of 
SDDs was consistently lower, in the CYD dengue vaccine Group than in the Placebo group in seropositive 
subjects, in the two age groups. 
2.3.5.  Safety during the long-term follow-up 
2.3.5.1.  SAEs and Deaths During Long-term Follow-ups 
SAEs and deaths that occurred during LTFU in CYD05, CYD22, CYD28, CYD57, CYD14, CYD15, and CYD65 
are  presented  for  subjects  aged  6  to  60  years  in  Integrated  Safety  Analysis  Report,  Listings  Part  2, 
[Listing 3.32.2]. The collection of SAEs after 6 months post any injection differed by study: 
- In CYD05, SAEs and deaths were collected from D0 to M60 post-injection 3. 
- In CYD22 and CYD28, only related SAEs and deaths were collected up to 48 months postinjection 3. 
- In CYD57, only related SAEs and deaths were collected from 13 to 60 months postinjection 3. 
- In CYD14 and CYD15, all SAEs were collected during the entire duration of the study, i.e. up to 60 
months post-injection 3. 
- In CYD65, for the primary series, all SAEs were collected from D0 until the administration of the CYD 
dengue vaccine booster injection.

CYD dengue vaccine 5 ± 1 log10 CCID50 of serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 
Contributing studies: CYD14 
The CHMP noted that: 
In subjects aged 6 to 8 years at enrollment, 174 subjects experienced a total of 202 SAEs during LTFU 
after any CYD dengue vaccine dose. Except for 2 subjects (1 from CYD28 and 1 from CYD23/57), all 
subjects were enrolled in CYD14. The SAE reported in CYD23/57 was the only fatal one in this age group 
(PT:  gun  shot  wound)  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group.  After  any  Placebo  dose,  103  subjects 
experienced a total of 131 SAEs during LTFU. Except for 1 subject of CYD23/57, all subjects were enrolled

in CYD14. In CYD14, the frequency of LTFU SAEs in all subjects aged 6 to 8 years was 9.2% in the CYD 
dengue vaccine Group and 10.8% in the Placebo Group (regardless of baseline dengue serostatus). No 
related SAEs were reported during the LTFU in any groups of these studies. 
In  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group  (in  CYD14,  regardless  of  baseline  dengue  serostatus),  SAEs  were 
mostly  reported  in  SOCs  Infections  and  infestations  (6.7%),  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications  (1.5%),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (0.7%).  Similar  frequencies  and  same  trends  were 
reported in dengue seropositive subjects (SAE frequency of 9.5% and respectively 7.1%, 1.8% and 0.6% 
for the SOC most frequently reported).  
In subjects aged 9 to 17 years at enrollment, LTFU SAEs were reported with a frequency of 10.3% in 
the CYD dengue vaccine Group (in CYD14+CYD15 , regardless of baseline dengue serostatus) (compared 
to  10.9%  in  placebo  group).  In  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group,  SAEs  were  mostly  reported  in  SOCs 
Infections and infestations (4.4%), Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (2.1%), Pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions (1.8%), and Gastrointestinal disorders (0.5%). Similar frequencies 
and  same  trends  were  reported  in  dengue  seropositive  subjects  (SAE  frequency  of  11.8%  and 
respectively 4.5%, 3.5%, 1.8% and 0.6% for the SOC most frequently reported). 
LTFU  SAEs  were  mostly  reported  in  the  same  SOCs  for  both  age  groups;  however,  some  differences 
were observed: 
- SAEs in the following SOCs were slightly more frequently reported in subjects aged 9 to 17 years than 
in  subjects  aged  6  to  8  years  (regardless  of  baseline  dengue  serostatus):  Nervous  system  disorders 
(0.4%),  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (0.3%)  in  subjects  aged  9  to  17  years,  and 
<0.1% for both SOCs in subjects aged 6 to 8 years . 
-  SAEs  in  the  following  SOCs  were  slightly  more  frequently  reported  in  subjects  aged  6  to  8  years 
compared  than  in  subjects  9  to  17  years  (regardless  of  baseline  dengue  serostatus):  Infections  and 
infestations (6.7% versus 4.4%), Renal and urinary disorders (0.3 % versus 0.1%). 
- The following SOCs (≥0.1%) were reported only in subjects aged 9 to 17 years (regardless of baseline 
dengue  serostatus)  but  with  SAEs  frequency  mostly  <  0.1%:  Pregnancy,  puerperium  and  perinatal 
conditions  (1.8%),  Reproductive  system  and  breast  disorders  (0.3%),  Psychiatric  disorders  (0.4%), 
Hepatobiliary  disorders  (0.2%),  Social  circumstances  (0.2%),  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders 
(0.1%). 
- No SOC were only reported in subjects aged 6 to 8 years (regardless of baseline dengue serostatus). 
In subjects aged 6 years and above, regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, the following number of 
deaths was reported during the LTFU: 0 death in CYD05, 1 death (Control Group) in CYD22, 3 deaths 
(CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group)  in  CYD28,  5  deaths  (3  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  Group,  and  2  in  the 
Placebo Group) in CYD57, 9 deaths (7 in the CYD dengue vaccine Group and 2 in the Placebo Group) in 
CYD14, 63 deaths (40 in the CYD dengue vaccine Group and 23 in the Placebo Group) in CYD15, and no 
reported deaths in CYD65. No related deaths were reported during the LTFU of any of these studies. 
A  large  proportion  of  the  fatal  cases  during  LTFU  originated  from  violence-related  deaths 
(firearm/gunshot deaths) and accidents in general, particularly traffic accidents. Apart from these, some 
isolated  medical  conditions  leading  to  death  in  LTFU  have  been  reported,  often  linked  to  an  obvious 
alternative  explanation,  with  long  latency  to  last  administration  and  lack  of  any  plausible  causal 
association with CYD dengue vaccine. Taken together, the deaths in LTFU reported (all assessed as not 
related cases) do not raise concern on the vaccine safety.

From these described deaths during the LTFU period, 3 deaths were reported in the 6 to 8 years age 
group: one in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (PT: gun shot wound in CYD23/57), and 2 in the Placebo 
Group (1 in CYD14 and 1 in CYD57). 
2.3.6.  Laboratory findings 
No new clinical laboratory parameters assessments were performed since the CYD dengue vaccine file 
was submitted or last updated. 
2.3.7.  Safety in special populations 
Although  the  safety  database  was  updated  with  data  from  recently  completed  studies,  no  additional 
assessments  of  the  potential  impact  of  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  factors  were  performed  since  the  CYD 
dengue vaccine file was submitted or last updated. 
The dengue status at baseline is discussed independently in the previous sections. 
2.3.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new evaluation of interactions between the CYD dengue vaccine and other vaccines was performed 
since the file was submitted or last updated. 
Post marketing experience 
The CYD dengue vaccine was first registered on 08 December 2015 in Mexico, and has been registered 
as  of  7  March  2020  in  21  countries,  including  the  US,  and  in  the  European  Economic  Area,  with 
commercial use in 10 countries (Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Paraguay, 
Peru, Singapore, and Thailand). 
The CYD dengue vaccine has been indicated for individuals of 9 years or age older. However, vaccination 
with  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  has  occurred  out  of  this  indicated  age.  In  DNG15,  an  ongoing  post-
authorization  and  non-interventional  safety  study  under  real-world  conditions  in  AP  and  LatAm, 
participants  were  vaccinated  before  their  enrolment  in  the  study,  reflecting  the  real-world  use  of  the 
vaccine,  in  routine  medical  care  in  each  study  country.  As  of  07  December  2019,  a  total  of  12  616 
participants have been enrolled in three countries and have received at least one vaccine injection. 2308 
participants  have  been  enrolled  in  Brazil;  88  participants  have  been  enrolled  in  Mexico  and  10  220 
participants have been enrolled in the Philippines. The average age overall was 14.5 years, ranging from 
7 to 73 years. Notably, 96 participants in these countries were younger than the age of indication at first 
dose: 4 were aged 7 years and 92 were aged 8 years. Of the 96 subjects, 5 were in Brazil, 4 were in 
Mexico, and 91 were in the Philippines. No safety signal has been identified based on safety data reported 
in individuals from 6 to 8 years of age who have received at least one dose of the CYD dengue vaccine. 
Cumulative  post-approval  exposure  to  CYD  dengue  vaccine  (from  01  December  2015  to  29  February 
2020) was estimated to be 2 909 464. Assuming that patients may have received between 1 and 3 doses 
in  accordance  with  the  recommended  schedule,  the  estimated  cumulative  number  of  patients  who 
received CYD dengue vaccine is between 969 821 and 2 909 464. 
It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  doses  of  CYD  dengue  vaccine  were  used  during  public 
vaccination campaigns in the Philippines and in Parana state of Brazil, where 2.3 M doses were distributed 
and at least 1.47 M doses administered across the 2 programs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 73/116 
 
 
 
No safety signal has been confirmed from post-marketing use of the vaccine as of 7 March 2020. 
The most frequently reported AEs are consistent with current label information. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
Current safety profile of the CYD dengue vaccine 
In subjects 9 to 45 years of age, the most frequently reported reactions whatever the dengue serostatus 
prior to vaccination, were headache (54%), injection site pain (49%), malaise (44%), myalgia (43%), 
asthenia (34%), and fever (16%). Adverse reactions occur within 3 days following vaccination except 
fever  which  appears  within  14  days  after  the  injection.  The  adverse  reactions  were  usually  mild  to 
moderate in severity and of short duration (0 to 3 days). Systemic adverse reactions tended to be less 
frequent after the second and third injections of Dengvaxia as compared to the first injection. Allergic 
including anaphylactic reactions have been reported very rarely. Overall, the same adverse reactions but 
at lower frequencies were observed in dengue seropositive subjects. 
Exposure to Drug 
In the 17 studies using the final formulation and a 3-dose vaccination schedule D0/M6/M12 that provided 
the main data to support the Application (SafAS), 24 733 subjects aged 6 to 60 years received at least 
1  injection  of  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine,  including  3233  children  aged  6  to  8  years,  19  715  children  / 
adolescents aged 9 to 17 years, 1492 adults aged 18 to 45 years, and 293 adults aged 46 to 60 years.  
The Reactogenicity Subset for the 3-dose schedule included a total of 6219 subjects aged 6 to 60 years, 
including 768 children aged 6 to 8 years, 3666 children / adolescents aged 9 to 17 years, 1492 adults 
aged 18 to 45 years, and 293 adults aged 46 to 60 years. 
Demographics 
In the included 3233 children aged 6 to 8 years, the distribution between males and females was similar. 
The mean age of subjects at enrolment for the combined regions was 7.0 years. There were no subjects 
aged 6 to 8 years from the non-endemic region. 
The majority of the treated children aged 6 to 8 years (3179 children of the 3233) were from endemic 
Asia Pacific (AP), and all the subjects who provided ethnicity data were Asian (i.e. no ethnic origin data 
collected  for  the  54  children  in  the  LatAm  region).  The  representability  of  the  included  population  is 
questioned, in particular concerning the extrapolation of one epidemiological context to another in the 
context of the theoretical risk of cross-enhancement of other flaviviruses. 
Among  subjects  from  the  combined  regions  with  an  available  dengue  serostatus  (529  out  of  3233 
subjects), 294 were baseline seropositive (55.6%). 
Safety Overview in Subjects 6 to 8 Years 
Overall, the reactogenicity and safety profile of the CYD dengue vaccine in terms of incidence, intensity, 
and nature of events in subjects regardless of dengue baseline serostatus was generally similar to that 
reported  after  placebo  or  control  injections.  A  trend  toward  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  solicited 
systemic reactions in the CYD dengue vaccine Group was observed. Overall, a similar reactogenicity and 
safety profile was observed vs placebo or control in seropositive subjects; however, a trend toward a 
slightly higher incidence of solicited injection site reactions in the CYD dengue vaccine Group was also 
observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 74/116 
 
 
 
 
Solicited  injection  site  reactions,  solicited  systemic  reactions  and  unsolicited  non-serious  AE  (mainly 
systemic) were observed at a lower frequencies in dengue seropositive subjects compared to all subjects 
regardless of baseline dengue serostatus. 
The incidence of solicited systemic reactions and unsolicited non-serious AEs (mainly systemic) tended 
to decrease with subsequent injections. 
Overall, no major differences are observable between the reactogenicity and the safety profile in children 
from 6 to 8 years old and children from 9 to 17 years old (population in which the vaccine is currently 
licensed) after any of 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine and after each CYD dengue vaccine dose, regardless 
of baseline dengue serostatus and in baseline dengue seropositive. 
Immediate AEs 
In subjects aged 6 to 8 years regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, no immediate unsolicited AEs 
were reported in any of the 3 treatment groups.  
Solicited Injection Site Reactions 
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, the most frequent solicited 
injection  site  reaction  was  injection  site  pain  (51.4%  of  subjects);  erythema  (21.7%)  and  swelling 
(16.2%) were less frequently reported. 
-  Most solicited injection site reactions were Grade 1, occurred within 3 days after injection and 
had short duration (1 and 3 days). 
- 
- 
For all solicited injection site reactions, the maximum intensity, time to onset, and number of 
days of occurrence were similar in the CYD dengue vaccine, Placebo, and Control Groups. 
The incidence of each solicited injection site reaction tended to be similar after each injection. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  injection  site  reactions  after  any  injection  tended  to 
decrease as subjects’ age increased with 56.1% in subjects aged 6 to 8 years, 51.6% in subjects aged 
9 to 17 years, 45.4% in subjects aged 18 to 45 years, and 38.7% in subjects aged 46 to 60 years (Cf. 
submitted clinical safety summary). 
In dengue seropositive subjects, all solicited injection site reactions (50.2%), pain (46.1%), erythema 
(14.3%) and swelling (12.7%) were observed at a lower frequencies compared to all subjects regardless 
of baseline dengue serostatus. 
Solicited Systemic Reactions 
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group regardless of baseline dengue serostatus, the most frequent solicited 
systemic reaction within 14 days after any CYD dengue vaccine injection was headache (51.5%). Malaise 
(44.2%) and myalgia (40.1%) were also frequently reported. The incidence of asthenia and fever were 
lower (32.8% and 19.6% respectively). 
-  Most solicited systemic reactions were Grade 1, occurred within 3 days after injection (except 
for fever, which appeared throughout the solicited period) and had short duration (1 and 3 days 
of occurrence). 
-  Myalgia in particular has a higher incidence in the CYD dengue vaccine group (40.1%) compared 
to PBO (34.5%) and control group (34.6%). Malaise has also a slightly higher incidence in the 
CYD  dengue  vaccine  group  (44.2%  vs.  39.2%  vs.  38.6%,  respectively).  The  3  other  types  of 
solicited  systemic  reactions  were  reported  with  similar  frequencies  in  each  group:  headache 
(51.5%,  48.9%,  47.8%,  respectively),  asthenia  (32.8%  vs.  32.4%  vs.  29.2%),  and  fever 
(19.6%, 18.7%, and 15.7%, respectively).

- 
- 
For all solicited systemic reactions, the maximum intensity, time to onset, and number of days 
of occurrence were similar in the CYD dengue vaccine, Placebo, and Control Groups. 
The  incidence  of  all  solicited  systemic  reactions  tended  to  decrease  after  each  injection  of 
vaccine. 
The proportion of subjects reporting solicited systemic reactions was similar across all age groups with 
67.5% in subjects aged 6 to 8 years, 65.5% in subjects aged 9 to 17 years, 63.7% in subjects aged 18 
to 45 years, and 65.4% in subjects aged 46 to 60 years (Cf. submitted clinical safety summary). 
In  dengue  seropositive  subjects,  solicited  systemic  reactions  (57%),  headache  (42.5%),  malaise 
(34.9%), myalgia (32.9%), asthenia (24.3%) and fever (19.1%) were observed at a lower frequencies 
compared to all subjects regardless of baseline dengue serostatus. 
Unsolicited Non-Serious AEs and ARs 
The  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  non-serious  ARs  after  any  CYD  dengue  vaccine  injection 
regardless  of  baseline  dengue  serostatus  were  vomiting  (0.9%),  injection  site  haemorrhage  (0.4%), 
injection site induration (0.4%), decreased appetite (0.4%), and injection site bruising (0.3%). 
No clusters of ARs were observed in any of the age groups. There was only 1 Grade 3 unsolicited non-
serious  ARs  (vomiting).  Most  unsolicited  non-serious  AEs  and  ARs  were  of  Grade  1  and  resolved 
spontaneously or with a medication within 7 days of onset or less. In addition to the intensity grading, 
all ARs were reviewed for clinical relevance and no concern was raised in subjects who received the CYD 
dengue vaccine. 
After  any  dose,  the  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  unsolicited  AE  tended  to  be  similar 
across the different age groups with 43.8% in subjects aged 6 to 8 years, 40.8% in subjects aged 9 to 
17  years,  39.1%  in  subjects  aged  18  to  45  years,  and  50.5%  in  subjects  aged  46  to  60  years  (Cf. 
submitted clinical safety summary). 
The proportion of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited non-serious ARs tended to be higher in older 
subjects with 3.1% in subjects aged 6 to 8 years, 2.2% in subjects aged 9 to 17 years, 8.9% in subjects 
aged 18 to 45 years, and 17.4% in subjects aged 46 to 60 years (Cf. submitted clinical safety summary). 
Deaths, SAEs, and Discontinuation due to AEs 
Deaths 
No death was reported in the CYD dengue vaccine Group within 6 months after any injection in the Main 
Studies. 
SAEs within 28 days after any injection 
The most frequently reported SAEs after any CYD dengue vaccine injection regardless of baseline dengue 
serostatus were in the following SOC: infections and infestations (0.6%: including 0.2% gastroenteritis), 
injury, poisoning and procedural complications (0.2%) and gastrointestinal disorders (0.1%). 
No cluster in terms of nature and frequency was observed. When considering each injection, there was 
a trend toward a decrease incidence of SAEs within 28 days with subsequent injections. 
After  any  dose,  the  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  SAE  tended  to  be  similar  across  the 
different age groups with 1.3% in subjects aged 6 to 8 years, 0.6% in subjects aged 9 to 17 years, 0.7% 
in subjects aged 18 to 45 years, and 2% in subjects aged 46 to 60 years (Cf. submitted clinical safety 
summary). 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 76/116 
 
 
 
 
After  any  dose,  related  SAEs  were  reported  in  1  out  of  3233  subjects  aged  6  to  8  years  (acute 
disseminated  encephalomyelitis  -  <0.1%),  4  out  of  19  715  subjects  aged  9  to  17  years  (urticaria, 
asthma, acute polyneuropathy, and tension headache - <0.1%), and 2 out of 293 subjects aged 46 to 
60 years (polymyalgia rheumatica and headache – 0.7%). No related SAEs within 28 days were reported 
in adults aged 18 to 45 years. 
In dengue seropositive subjects, a similar frequency of SAE was observed (1.4%). 
SAEs after 28 days and up to 6 months after any injection 
The most frequently reported SAEs after any CYD dengue vaccine injection regardless of baseline dengue 
serostatus were in the following SOC: infections and infestations (3.6%: including 0.5% dengue fever, 
0.5% pharyngitis, 0.4% bronchitis, 0.4% gastroenteritis, 0.2% cellulitis, 0.2% pharyngotonsillitis, 0.2% 
tonsillitis  and  0.2%  viral  infection),  injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  (0.7%), 
gastrointestinal disorders (1%: including 0.6% gastritis and 0.1% food poisoning), and nervous system 
disorders (0.1%). 
No cluster in terms of nature and frequency was observed. The incidence of SAEs tended to be similar 
after each injection. 
No  SAEs  were  assessed  as  related  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the  Investigator  between  28  days  and  6 
months after any injection in any of the groups. 
After  any  dose,  the  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  SAE  tended  to  be  similar  across  the 
different age groups with 5.6% in subjects aged 6 to 8 years, 2.8% in subjects aged 9 to 17 years, 2.8% 
in subjects aged 18 to 45 years, and 4.4% in subjects aged 46 to 60 years (Cf. submitted clinical safety 
summary). 
Related SAEs were reported in 2 out of 19 715 subjects aged 9 to 17 years (dengue fever and dengue 
hemorrhagic fever - <0.1%) and 1 out 1492 subjects aged 18 to 45 years (blighted ovum - <0.1%). No 
related SAEs after 28 days and up to 6 months after any injection were reported in subjects aged 6 to 8 
and 46 to 60 years. 
In dengue seropositive subjects, a similar frequency of SAE was observed (5.8%). 
Discontinuation due to an AE 
In the CYD dengue vaccine Group, 4 subjects discontinued due to non-serious AEs (2 urticaria, illness 
after  vaccination,  and  generalized  itching  rash)  and  4  due  to  SAEs  (rheumatic  heart  disease,  acute 
disseminated  encephalomyelitis,  ischemic  stroke,  and  nephrotic  syndrome;  only  acute  disseminated 
encephalomyelitis was assessed as related to the study vaccine). 
After any dose, the proportion of subjects in the CYD dengue vaccine Group that discontinued from their 
study due to an AE tended to be higher in older subjects with 0.2% in subjects aged 6 to 8 years, 0.4% 
in subjects aged 9 to 17 years, 1.2% in subjects aged 18 to 45 years, and 2.4% in subjects aged 46 to 
60 years (Cf. submitted clinical safety summary). 
Dengue-like syndrome 
Combination  of  events  that  were  identified  as  potential  post-vaccination  dengue-like  syndrome  by  an 
algorithm in  the pooled/integrated analysis was not reported in subjects aged 6 to 8 years, but were 
reported in 3 subjects in the CYD dengue vaccine Group (2 aged 9 to 17 years out of 19 715 subjects, 
and 1 aged 18 to 45 years out of 1492 subjects). No safety concerns were observed in any of them. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 77/116 
 
 
 
The analysis of AESIs showed no concerns in terms of allergic reactions, as no anaphylactic reactions 
were retrieved by the SMQ algorithm in subjects aged 6 to 8 years. 
The proportion of subjects aged 6 to 8 years who reported potential non-serious allergic reactions was 
low and similar between the CYD dengue vaccine, Placebo, and Control Groups with 0.8%, 0.4%, and 
0.3% of subjects, respectively. 
- 
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  reported  Grade  3  potential  non-serious  allergic  reactions  was 
also low and similar between the CYD dengue vaccine, Placebo, and Control Groups with 0.3%, 
0.4%, and 0.3% of subjects, respectively. 
-  No serious allergic reactions were reported in subjects aged 6 to 8 years 
After  any  dose,  the  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  SAE  tended  to  be  similar  across  the 
different age groups with 0.8% in subjects aged 6 to 8 years, 0.5% in subjects aged 9 to 17 years, 1.2% 
in subjects aged 18 to 45 years, and 1% in subjects aged 46 to 60 years (Cf. submitted clinical safety 
summary). 
No  events  of  viscerotropic  disease  were  observed  after  administration  of  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  in 
subjects aged 6 to 60 years. No events of neurotropic disease were observed after administration of the 
CYD  dengue  vaccine  in  subjects  aged  8  to  60  years.  One  related  SAE  of  acute  disseminated 
encephalomyelitis happened in the subjects aged from 6 to 8 years in the CYD dengue vaccine group 7 
days after the first study vaccination. Vaccinal and wild-type dengue virus test was negative in serum, 
blood,  urine  and  cerebrospinal  fluid.  Therefore,  a  neurotropic  disease  with  replication  of  the  vaccinal 
virus in the CNS was excluded. 
So  far  (neither  from  any  study  nor  from  post-marketing),  no  confirmed  events  of  viscerotropic  or 
neurotropic disease (i.e. vaccinal virus detection in CNS) were observed after administration of the CYD 
dengue vaccine in any studies. Although these important potential risks remain theoretical, the MAH will 
continue to monitor them as part of its pharmacovigilance activities, as described in the RMP (YF vaccine-
associated  viscerotropic  /  neurotropic  disease  are  important  potential  risks).  Neurotropism  occurring 
within 30 days after injection throughout trials had been defined as Adverse Events of Special Interest 
(AESI). 
Overall, in both treatment groups (CYD dengue vaccine or placebo), the frequency of Serious dengue 
disease events (SDDs) tended to be lower in the 9 to 17 years than in the 6 to 8 years age group in 
seropositive subjects. The frequency of SDDs was consistently lower, in the CYD dengue vaccine Group 
than in the Placebo group in seropositive subjects, in the two age groups. Risk of SDD due to waning 
protection against dengue disease over time is an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Safety During the LTFU 
SAEs 
Overall, in children from 6 to 8 year old, during the long-term safety follow-up (reported after 6 months 
post any injection in the CYD dengue vaccine Group to approximatively 4.5 years), there were a similar 
SAE incidence in CYD dengue vaccine and placebo groups, and no SAEs were assessed as related to the 
study vaccine. No deaths were linked to dengue cases (only 1 death after CYD dengue vaccination due 
to gunshot). 
HVCD – SDD in non-efficacy studies 
No cases were reported in subjects aged 6 to 8 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 78/116 
 
 
 
 
Relative risks of HVCD and SVCD over the entire study and by period 
Data are consistent with efficacy rather than with a safety issue. The data are discussed in the efficacy 
section. 
Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of the CYD dengue vaccine in subjects 6 to 8 years of age is very similar to the 
safety profile in subjects 9 to 45 years of age. The most frequently reported reactions, whatever the 
dengue serostatus prior to vaccination, were headache (52%), injection site pain (51%), malaise 
(44%), myalgia (40%), asthenia (33%), erythema (22%) and fever (20%). Adverse reactions 
occurred within 3 days following vaccination except fever which appears within 14 days after the 
injection. The adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity and of short duration (0 to 3 
days). Systemic adverse reactions tended to be less frequent after the second and third injections of 
Dengvaxia as compared to the first injection. Allergic including anaphylactic reactions have been 
reported very rarely. Overall, the same adverse reactions but at lower frequencies were observed in 
dengue seropositive subjects compared to the overall population irrespective of serostatus. 
PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.4.  Clinical immunogenicity 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Clinical immunogenicity in subjects aged 6 to 8 years is presented along with that in 2 to 5 and 9 to 17 
years to offer some perspective on the available data. 
Twelves clinical studies contributed to the immunogenicity results in subjects aged 2 to 5, 6 to 8, and 
9 to 17 years: 
• 2 large-scale pivotal efficacy studies: CYD14 and CYD15 
• 10 supportive studies: 6 Phase II (CYD13, CYD22, CYD24, CYD28, CYD30, CYD65 [intermediate 
results]), 1 Phase IIb (CYD23), 1 Phase III (CYD32) and 2 Phase IIIb (CYD71 and CYD67) 
The design and objectives of studies are summarized in the Tables below.

The CHMP acknowledged that, at the time of the initial MAA, the integrated immunogenicity analysis 
comprised data from 16 clinical studies that assessed immunogenicity of the final formulation of the 
CYD dengue vaccine administered as a three-dose schedule 6 months apart. The 16 clinical studies 
comprised 2 large-scale pivotal efficacy studies CYD14 and CYD15 and 14 supportive studies, i.e. 9 
Phase II (CYD08, CYD12, CYD13, CYD22, CYD24, CYD28, CYD30, CYD47 and CYD51), 1 Phase IIb 
(CYD23) and 4 Phase III (CYD17, CYD29, CYD32 and CYD33).  
Studies CYD12, CYD17, CYD47, CYD51 included 18-45 yoa adults only and are therefore not included 
in the present integrated immunogenicity analysis. All 3 CYD08, CYD29, CYD33 studies were also 
discarded from the present analysis since they included infants who were of 9-15 months of age at first 
injection. 
In addition to the above-mentioned studies, results of the following studies were included in the 
present analysis: CYD65, CYD67, CYD71. These studies were completed (CYD67, CYD71) or achieved a 
milestone (CYD65, which is still ongoing) after the approval of Dengvaxia. Studies CYD14 and CYD15 
include a 5-year FU and are now completed. 
Three additional studies were completed since the initial MA, namely CYD63, CYD64 and CYD66. 
CYD63 and CYD64 assessed the effect of a booster dose of the CYD dengue vaccine 4 to 5 years after 
the third dose (PD3) of the primary series administered in previous studies (CYD28 and CYD13/30, 
respectively). CYD66 investigated the effect of dTpa co-administration. All 3 studies included adults 
only and are therefore not included in this submission. 
Consequently, it is considered by the CHMP that data from all relevant studies were included in the 
integrated immunogenicity analysis. This leads to a total of 12 studies used for this extension of 
indication application. 
Integrated analysis compared immunogenicity results obtained in children and adolescents from 2-5 
years, 6-8 years and 9-17 years of age. These age ranges were based on the observed results 
submitted at initial MAA. The fact that children <9 yoa, and particularly children 6-8 yoa, may benefit 
from vaccination was discussed during the initial MAA.

2.4.2.  Immunogenicity methods 
This section summarizes the methodology used in the 12 individual studies relevant to the 
immunogenicity assessments. Please refer to the efficacy section for Methodology specifically related 
to efficacy assessments. 
2.4.2.1.  Overall design 
Studies were conducted in healthy subjects (age ranging from 2 to 50 years) in dengue endemic regions, 
where the disease has been continuously present in the native population with documented outbreaks 
or epidemics. Two dengue endemic regions are represented: Asia Pacific (AP) (studies CYD22, CYD28, 
CYD32,  CYD23,  CYD14,  CYD67,  and  CYD65)  and  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  (LatAm)  (studies 
CYD13,  CYD24,  CYD30,  CYD15,  CYD71  and  CYD65).  Subjects  had  to  fulfil  all  inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria prior to enrolment. 
The subjects involved in all studies were randomized for treatment assignment using an interactive voice 
response system (IVRS). Randomization using the permuted block method guarantees the independence 
of treatment assignment and outcome. The randomization of subjects was stratified by center for studies 
that  were  multi-center.  In  addition,  7  studies  (CYD22,  CYD24,  CYD28,  CYD32,  CYD14,  CYD15,  and 
CYD65) were also stratified by age. 
Table 23. Age ranges used for stratification across studies stratified by age  
All studies were blind-observer and controlled with at least one injection of placebo, i.e. a sodium chloride 
solution or an active control selected to provide a benefit to the study population. The laboratory was 
blinded to the treatment group when performing all testing. 
Duration of subject participation varied across studies. For CYD13, CYD24, CYD30, and CYD32, subjects 
were followed up for safety up to 6 months after the last study vaccine injection. For CYD23, subjects 
were followed-up for efficacy and safety (all subjects) as well as immunogenicity (randomized subset of 
subjects)  up  to  1  year  after  the  last  study  vaccine  injection.  CYD23  subjects  continued  the  safety 
surveillance through CYD57, a 4-year follow-up study. For CYD22 and CYD28, subjects were followed-
up for safety (all subjects) and immunogenicity (randomized subset of subjects) up to 4 years after the 
last study vaccine injection. For CYD14 and CYD15, subjects were followed-up for efficacy (all subjects),

safety (all subjects) and immunogenicity (randomized subset of subjects) up to 5 years after the last 
study  vaccine  injection.  Concomitant  administration  studies  CYD67  and  CYD71  included  the  follow-up 
for safety up to 6 months after the last study vaccine injection. For CYD65, subjects were to be followed-
up for immunogenicity (all subjects in Stage I, and seropositive subjects in Stage II) up to 28 days post-
booster  injection  and  for  safety  (all  subjects)  up  to  6  months  post-booster  injection.  Booster 
administration was to take place either 1 year or 2 years after the last vaccine injection from primary 
series. 
The CHMP considered that all 12 clinical trials were conducted in healthy subjects (2-50 yoa) in endemic 
regions (Asia Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean) and are consistent in terms of the general 
study  design,  vaccine  formulation  and  schedule.  The  age  range  of  the  randomised  population  varied 
widely  across  studies.  Only  one  study  enrolled  seropositive  subjects  only  (CYD65).  All  other  studies 
enrolled subjects irrespective of serostatus. All the studies assessed immunogenicity and safety, CYD23 
was  a  POC  efficacy  trial,  CYD24  assessed  CYD  dengue  vaccine  in  children  previously  vaccinated  YF, 
CYD22 and CYD28 assessed immune persistence at 4 years, CYD65 was a booster study, and CYD67 
and CYD71 were coadministration studies (tetravalent and bivalent HPV vaccines). 
The design of most of the individual studies was already assessed at initial MAA and deemed appropriate. 
The laboratory was blinded to the treatment group when performing all testing. The FU duration varied 
across studies. Pre-dose 1 (PreD1) and Post-dose 3 (PD3) data were used for performing the integrated 
immunogenicity  analysis.  Data  obtained  after  a  longer  duration  following  post-last  injection  were 
analysed to assess Ab persistence. 
2.4.2.2.  Immunogenicity assessment 
Dengue immunogenicity 
In all individual pivotal and supportive studies, the neutralizing Ab response was measured using PRNT, 
which  is  considered  as  the  “gold  standard”  assay  method.  The  PRNT  assay  allows  quantitation  of 
neutralizing Ab for each serotype and the neutralizing titer is expressed as the highest reciprocal dilution 
of  sera  that reduced  the  infectivity  of a  challenge  virus  by  50%  (PRNT50  most  commonly  used).  The 
PRNT  assay  as  developed  by  Sanofi  Pasteur  evolved  during  the  course  of  the  development  and  was 
optimized and validated. Seropositivity was defined as a neutralizing Ab level ≥ 10 1/dil against at least 
one dengue serotype. This level of Ab is accepted as predictive of protection for JE and is used here for 
the  purposes  of  seropositivity  analysis.  There  are  currently  no  serological  correlates  of  protection 
accepted for dengue. 
PRNT50 has been used during the clinical development to assess the humoral immune response after 
dengue vaccination. 
Definition of Baseline Dengue 
Baseline information about previous dengue infection was based on self-reporting and collected using 
various questionnaires across studies. However, as infection might have been asymptomatic or a subject 
might not recall accurately a previous infection, dengue serostatus was assessed based on the detection 
of neutralizing Abs in blood samples collected at enrolment using a PRNT50 assay. 
Dengue immune status at baseline is defined as: 
(i) 
Seropositive:  subjects  with  quantified  (≥  10  [1/dil],  the  lower  limit  of  quantitation  [LLOQ]) 
neutralizing Ab against at least 1 dengue serotype in the baseline sample. 
(ii) 
Seronegative: subjects without quantified (< LLOQ) neutralizing Abs against all of the 4 dengue 
serotypes in the baseline sample. 
(iii) 
Undetermined: subjects with no titer ≥ LLOQ and at least one missing titer. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 84/116 
 
 
 
Collection of Data 
In all studies, blood samples intended for dengue PRNT50 testing were collected at baseline and after 
the third injection of the CYD dengue vaccine. Blood samples were also collected at different timepoints 
depending on the study design and intent.  
In study CYD28 and in the 3 efficacy studies CYD14, CYD15, and CYD23/57, blood samples were collected 
prior to vaccination in a subset of subjects and used to determine the baseline serological status. The 
‘Immunogenicity Subset’ consisted of 2000 randomly selected subjects in each CYD14 and CYD15 and 
300 non-randomly selected subjects in CYD23 (i.e. first subjects enrolled in the study) to provide the 
baseline blood samples and additional samples to assess immunogenicity. 
Table 24. Post-injection blood sample collection for dengue PRNT50 testing in individual 
studies 
The CHMP noted that dengue immunogenicity was evaluated  based on  PRNT50 results. The validated 
PRNT50 assay was the core immunologic assay for measuring functional antibodies able  to neutralize 
dengue  virus  in  studies  submitted  at  the  initial  MAA.  No  immune  correlate  of  protection  is  currently 
established for dengue but based on current knowledge it was considered adequate that immunogenicity 
assessment for CYD vaccine was based on neutralising antibody titres. The assay methodology is in line 
with WHO recommendation and was considered acceptable.  
Serological cross-reactivity amongst members of the Flaviviridae family (DENV, Yellow Fever (YF), West-
Nile virus (WNV), Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) and Tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)) is a well-
known diagnostic problem. Hence misclassification of subjects (false positives) cannot be excluded. 
Analysis by using dengue PRNT with a higher stringency (PRNT90) were not performed or not presented 
in the context of this application. Such assay was used during the initial evaluation to reanalyse blood 
samples for  post-hoc efficacy analyses by dengue  immune status at baseline. Using a more stringent 
assay may likely lead to lower false positive rate resulting from flaviviruses cross-reactivity, but it would 
also  run  the  risk  of  a  higher  false  negative  rate,  resulting  in,  most  probably,  even  lower  number  of 
seropositive subjects to be included in the analysis. 
Altogether, it is considered that the use of PRNT50 to determine dengue immunogenicity in the present 
integrated analysis is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021

The dengue serostatus at baseline was defined as previously, i.e. seropositive if the PRNT50 titre was 
≥10 against at least one serotype and seronegative if PRNT50 titre was < LLOQ against any of the four 
dengue  serotypes  in  the  baseline  sample.  This  threshold  represents  the  lower  limit  of  quantification 
(LLOQ). 
In all studies, blood samples intended for dengue PRNT50 testing were collected at baseline, either in all 
subjects or in a subset, and after the third injection of the CYD dengue vaccine. 
2.4.2.3.  Methods of analysis for immunogenicity 
General biostatistical methods of analysis used in the individual studies and in the updated integrated 
immunogenicity analysis are summarized hereunder. 
Definition of the Study Populations 
The  statistical  populations  used  in  the  individual  studies  are  considered  clinically  similar  and  are  fully 
described  in  each  individual  CSR.  The  definitions  of  the  study  populations  used  in  the  integrated 
immunogenicity analysis were the same as those used in the individual studies. Subjects were analyzed 
by the treatment group to which they were randomized. 
All individual studies presented both a per-protocol analysis set (PPAS) that included all subjects who 
meet the per protocol criteria as defined in each individual study and a full analysis set (FAS) defined as 
all subjects who received at least one injection of the CYD dengue vaccine or control vaccine, and who 
had at least 1 blood sample drawn and 1 valid post-injection serology result. In studies in which only a 
subset of subjects was followed-up for immunogenicity (i.e. CYD14, CYD15, CYD23, CYD28), the FAS for 
the Immunogenicity Subset (FASI) was defined as described for the FAS. According to the MAH, Similar 
results between the FAS and the PPAS were observed in all individual studies. Therefore, only the FAS 
(and/or the FASI, as appropriate) were used in the integrated immunogenicity analysis.  
The integrated immunogenicity analysis presented is performed on an updated clinical database (prior 
database updated with most recent clinical data). Data presented correspond to seropositive subjects 
from the FAS and/or FASI from the following studies: CYD13, CYD14, CYD15, CYD22, CYD24, CYD28, 
CYD30, CYD23/57, CYD32, CYD65 (intermediate results), CYD67, and CYD71. 
It  is  to  note  that  data  included  in  the  updated  integrated  analysis  from  the  following  studies  were 
restricted  as  indicated:  (i)  CYD67  and  CYD71  data  were  restricted  to  the  sequential  interventional 
treatment (one study arm), (ii) CYD65 data were restricted to the Group 1 receiving 3 doses. 
Calculation of Confidence Intervals 
The methods for computing the confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: 
• CI for point estimate of percentages of seropositivity: the 95% CIs for percentages were calculated 
using the exact binomial Clopper-Pearson’s method, quoted by Newcombe. 
•  CI  for  point  estimate  of  GMTs  and  GMTRs:  assuming  that  log10  transformation  of  the  titers  /  data 
follows a normal distribution, at first, the mean and the 95% CI were calculated on log10 (titers / data) 
using  the  usual  calculation  for  normal  distribution  (using  Student’s  t  distribution  with  n-1  degree  of 
freedom). Antilog transformations were then applied to the results of calculations, in order to provide 
geometric means (GMT or GMTR) and their 95% CI. 
Statistical Criteria for Assessment 
Overall,  assessment  of  the  immune  response  for  each  serotype  was  consistent  across  studies.  Thus, 
GMTs for each serotype was assessed at baseline and either 28 days or 30 days after injection, and at 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 86/116 
 
 
 
additional timepoints in studies with a Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU). The GMTRs were also assessed to 
provide  additional  information  in  studies  conducted  in  endemic  regions  where  subjects  might  have 
detectable Ab levels before first injection due to natural infection, to reflect the increase in the immune 
response after vaccine injection for each serotype as compared to baseline, or depending on the study 
design, to the immune response after a given injection. 
The main objective of the Integrated Immunogenicity Analysis was to provide an overview of the humoral 
immune response against each and any dengue serotype induced by the CYD dengue vaccine, according 
to age and region, in baseline dengue seropositive subjects, with a focus on the response 28 days post-
Dose (PD) 3. 
Other objective was to provide an overview of the persistence of the humoral immune response to the 
CYD dengue vaccine using baseline, 28 days PD3, and yearly PD3 time points, according to age group 
and region, in baseline seropositive subjects, using data collected from the pivotal and supportive studies 
with LTFUs. 
The assessment criteria used in the integrated immunogenicity analysis were the same as those used in 
the individual studies (i.e. GMTs and GMTRs). GMTs were assessed after each injection (when available), 
and GMTRs against each serotype using PD1, PD2 or PD3 titers over baseline titers (when available). 
For  an  overview  of  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  immune  response  persistence  (long  term  studies),  GMTs 
against  each  serotype  per  age  group,  study,  and  region  were  assessed  yearly  after  the  last  vaccine 
injection (primary series), and GMTRs assessed yearly using yearly titers over either baseline titers or 
titers after the last vaccine injection (as available). 
Additionally, graphical presentations by reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDC) by serotype are 
presented  after  a  given  vaccine  dose  in  baseline  dengue  seropositive  subjects  from  the  CYD  dengue 
vaccine Group, according to age group and region, and up to 5 years after the third injection. 
Statistical Methodology 
In all individual studies, the immunogenicity analyses were descriptive and no hypothesis was tested. 
Statistical  methodologies  for  each  individual  study  are  detailed  in  each  individual  CSR.  The  statistical 
methods for the integrated immunogenicity analysis are summarized below and are further detailed in 
the Integrated Immunogenicity Analysis Report. 
The analyses were descriptive and included various endpoints and parameters that are consistent with 
those presented in the individual studies. 
Based  on  the  immunogenicity  trends  observed  in  the  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  studies,  the  Integrated 
Immunogenicity  Analysis  was  presented  according  to  region  and  age:  (i)  Region:  endemic  AP  and 
endemic LatAm, (ii) Age: subjects 6 to 8 years, along with subjects aged 2 to 5 and 9 to 17 years as 
benchmark. 
The baseline characteristics taken into consideration were gender, age, and ethnic origin. 
The data presented in the Integrated Immunogenicity Analysis were not pooled and are presented by 
study, because, in endemic regions (Asia Pacific and Latin America), the dengue antibody responses may 
be  correlated  with  the  baseline  antibody  levels.  Therefore,  the  results  are  expected  to  be  study-  and 
population-related, and thus by nature not adapted for study pooling. Additionally, previous exposure to 
either  YF  or  JE  vaccine  or  natural  infection  may  have  an  effect  on  the  vaccine  response  (ISI  body 
document, 1.8.1.2). 
Assessment report

Handling of Missing Data 
Missing  data  were  not  estimated.  No  search  for  outliers  was  performed  (immunogenicity  data  were 
considered validated). 
The following rules were followed to consider Ab titers < LLOQ: 
• For computation of GMTs, any titer reported as < LLOQ was converted to a value of ½LLOQ; 
• For calculation of GMTRs, < LLOQ was converted to ½LLOQ for a numerator and < LLOQ 
was converted to LLOQ for a denominator. 
There was no upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) with the dengue PRNT method. 
The CHMP acknowledged that analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS) or the FAS for the 
immunogenicity subset (FASI), as appropriate. The FAS was defined as all subjects who received at least 
one injection of the CYD dengue vaccine or control vaccine, and who had at least 1 blood sample drawn 
and 1 valid post-injection serology result. In studies in which only a subset of subjects was followed-up 
for immunogenicity (i.e. CYD14, CYD15, CYD23, CYD28), the FASI was defined as described for the FAS. 
Results of all relevant studies (n=12) were included in the integrated immunogenicity analysis. 
The main objective of the integrated immunogenicity analysis was to provide an overview of the humoral 
immune response against each and any dengue serotype induced by the CYD dengue vaccine, according 
to age and region, in baseline dengue seropositive subjects, with a focus on the response 28 days PD3. 
The presentation of analysis by the selected age groups is appropriate. The Ab titers against any serotype 
induced by CYD dengue vaccine were not found. This issue is not pursued since analysis by serotype is 
considered the most relevant. 
Analyses were not pooled between both endemic regions (AP and LatAm) which is deemed appropriate 
because of difference in epidemiology, in age range, and in YF/JE vaccination status. Results could be 
expected to be study- and population-related. Results were presented by study to give an overview of 
the GMTs range, but were also presented pooled for the Endemic AP region.    
Another objective was to provide an overview of the persistence of the humoral immune response to the 
CYD dengue vaccine using baseline, 28 days PD3, and yearly PD3 time points, according to age group 
and region, in baseline seropositive subjects, using data collected from the pivotal and supportive studies 
with LTFUs. 
GMTs were assessed after each injection (when available), and GMTRs against each serotype using PD3 
titers over baseline titers (when available).  
Finally, rules for converting Ab titers reported as < LLOQ are deemed appropriate for both GMTs and 
GMTRs calculation.

2.4.3.1.  Comparison and analyses of results across studies 
This  section  presents  the  results  obtained  through  the  updated  integrated  immunogenicity  analysis 
performed on seropositive subjects, presented by region and age group. 
Study Populations 
For  studies  CYD13,  CYD22,  CYD24,  CYD30,  CYD32,  CYD67,  CYD71,  and  CYD65,  the  disposition  of 
subjects is based on the FAS, and for CYD14, CYD15, CYD23 and CYD28, the disposition of subjects is 
based on the FASI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 88/116 
 
 
 
In  studies  conducted  in  endemic  regions,  the  proportion  of  baseline  dengue  seropositive  subjects 
increased with age and, among subjects with an available baseline serostatus, were for the CYD dengue 
vaccine group and control group, respectively: 
• 49.2% (373/758) and 47.5% (163/343) for 2 to 5 years; 
• 55.4% (292/527) and 62.0% (152/245) for 6 to 8 years; 
• 70.3% (2544/3620) and 74.4% (1005/1350) for 9 to 17 years. 
The demographic characteristics of subjects contributing to the immunogenicity results presented in the 
tables below. In each study, the male/female ratio within each study group was relatively well balanced, 
considering the limited number of subjects included per study group. Mean age of subjects among the 
different age groups was very similar between the CYD dengue vaccine and the control groups. Ethnicity 
was collected in all studies, except for CYD22, CYD23, CYD24, CYD28, CYD67, and CYD71. In AP endemic 
regions, almost 90% of subjects were of Asian origin (both study groups). In LatAm endemic regions, 
most subjects were of Hispanic origin, of mixed ethnic origin in CYD15 and reported as “other” (both 
study groups).

Table 26. Demographics at baseline - seropositive subjects aged 6-8 years - FAS and FASI  
Table 27. Demographics at baseline - seropositive subjects aged 2-5 years - FAS and FASI  
The CHMP noted that twelve studies were included in the integrated immunogenicity analysis but only 
results of 6 of them were used to compare Pre-D1 and PD3 data by age, since CYD65, CYD67, CYD13, 
CYD15, CYD30 and CYD71 did not include children from 2-8 yoa. 
Children  6-8  years  are  nearly  exclusively  from  AP  countries  (as  are  children  from  2-5  years),  while 
children 9-17 are from both regions, although mainly from LatAm. 
All studies were conducted in endemic regions. The proportion of baseline dengue seropositive subjects 
increased with age, which is consistent with the dengue epidemiology and the observation made during 
the initial MAA. Seropositivity rates at baseline were overall well balanced between vaccine and control 
groups  and  were,  respectively,  47.5%-49.2%  for  2  to  5  years,  55.4%-62.0%  for  6  to  8  years,  and 
70.3%-74.4% for 9 to 17 years. 
Several studies included only very few seropositive subjects, particularly in the 2-5 and 6-8 years age 
groups,  either  in  the  vaccine  or  control  groups  or  in  both  groups.  In  contrast  to  the  9-17  years  age 
group, less subjects from 2-8 yoa were included in studies conducted in LatAm when compared to AP 
regions. Only one LatAm study (CYD24) included both adolescents of 9-17 yoa and children of 2-8 yoa. 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 90/116 
 
 
 
 
 
In the 9-17 yoa age group, a total of 848 and 309 subjects were included in, respectively, the vaccine 
and control groups of studies conducted in AP region whereas, in studies conducted in the LatAm region, 
a total of 1696 and 696 subjects were included in, respectively, the vaccine and control groups. Of these 
1696 vaccinees, only 24 were included in the CYD24 study.  
In the 6-8 yoa age group, a total of 281 and 136 subjects were included in, respectively, the vaccine 
and control groups of studies conducted in AP region whereas, in studies conducted in the LatAm region, 
a total of 11 and 16 subjects were included in, respectively, the vaccine and control groups.  
In the 2-5 yoa age group, a total of 334 and 142 subjects were included in, respectively, the vaccine 
and control  groups of studies conducted in AP region whereas, in LatAm region, a total  of 39 and  21 
subjects were included in the vaccine and control groups respectively. 
Consequently, some imbalance in gender were observed between vaccine and placebo groups in certain 
studies. Mean age were generally well balanced between both  groups in each of the studies. Another 
consequence of this limited number of included subjects in some studies is difficult result interpretation 
(see below). 
Comparison of Results to Support the Indication in Baseline Dengue Seropositive Subjects aged 6 to 8 
Years (3-Dose Schedule) 
GMTs  at  baseline  and  28  days  after  the  third  injection  of  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  are  presented  in 
baseline seropositive subjects aged 9 to 17, 6 to 8, and 2 to 5 years by endemic region in the tables 
below. 
Pre-Dose 1 GMTs were higher in older subjects than in younger subjects (i.e. GMTs in 9 to 17 years > 6 
to 8 years > 2 to 5 years) and higher in high endemic settings compared to low endemic settings, as 
anticipated, due to higher natural dengue exposure. 
Overall, a trend towards higher PD3 GMT levels was observed in subjects with higher baseline titers in 
all age groups. As a consequence, a trend towards increasing PD3 GMTs with increasing age and higher 
endemicity was also observed. Therefore, lowest GMTs were generally observed in subjects aged 2 to 5 
years or in studies conducted in countries with lower dengue endemicity such as Singapore (CYD28), 
where baseline GMTs were lower. 
In seropositive subjects aged 6 to 8 years, an increase in GMTs was observed for each of the 4 serotypes 
after 3 doses of the CYD dengue vaccine across the reported trials, with higher values for serotypes 1, 
2, and 3 and lower levels for serotype 4, overall as a consequence of lower pre-Dose 1 levels for serotype 
4. 
Neutralizing Ab levels in the control group, overall, showed no increase in GMTs after any injection of 
the placebo, across the reported trials, in all age groups.

Table 30. Geometric means of Dengue PRNT50 antibody (1/dil) pre-Dose 1 and PD3 for each 
serotype, in seropositive subjects aged 2 to 5 years  
Overall, a trend towards higher GMTRs of PD3/baseline was observed with decreasing age, being highest 
in  the  youngest  age  group  (2  to  5  years).  A  similar  trend  was  observed  in  lower  endemic  settings 
compared to higher endemic settings. 
It  is  important  to  highlight  that,  despite  the  lower  titer  levels  observed  for  serotype  4,  the  GMTRs  of 
PD3/baseline were similar or higher compared to the other serotypes. 
In subjects aged 6 to 8 years, GMTRs of PD3/baseline tended to be similar or higher than in subjects 9 
to 17 years but lower that those aged 2 to 5 years. GMTRs of PD3/baseline for each serotype in subjects 
6 to 8 years ranged from 2.03 for serotype 1 in CYD22 to 9.05 for serotype 3 in CYD28. 
The  CHMP  considered  that,  overall,  pre-Dose  1  GMTs  were  higher  in  older  subjects  than  in  younger 
subjects (i.e. GMTs in 9 to 17 years > 6 to 8 years > 2 to 5 years).  
Baseline GMTs varied across studies due to, as explained by the MAH, different endemic settings and 
therefore  different  natural  dengue  exposure.  Although  highly  plausible,  this  interpretation  was  not 
supported by a description of the dengue epidemiology of countries at the time of study conduct.  
Because  of  the  low  number  of  seropositive  subjects  included  in  all  the  studies,  with  the  exception  of 
study  CYD14,  the  assessment  was  mainly  focused  on  the  PD3  results  obtained  in  the  CYD14  study. 
Higher PD3 nAb titers were observed in the 9-17 year age group when compared to 6-8 years age group. 
PD3 nAb titers were higher for serotypes 3 and 4 in the 6-8 year age group when compared to 2-5 years 
age group (although 95%CI were overlapping). In contrast, PD3 nAb titers were similar between both 
groups for Serotype 1 and Serotype 2, although baseline GMTs were higher in the 6-8 years group when 
compared to the 2-5 years group. Consequently, GMTRs were higher for the 2-5 years age group when 
compared to the 6-8 years group.  
In all age groups, GMTs tend to be consistently lower for Serotype 4 when compared to Serotypes 1-3 
GMTs. Serotype 4 GMTRs were nevertheless roughly similar than Serotypes 1-3 GMTRs. 
Data obtained in the 6-8 yoa children included in studies conducted in the Endemic AP regions (pooled 
analysis) support the findings of CYD14 study. 
In the absence of ICP, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Meanwhile, VE was evaluated 
in study CYD14 for the different age groups.

2.4.3.2.  Persistence of immunogenicity 
Results presented herein correspond to the assessment of persistence of immunogenicity from efficacy 
studies  (CYD14,  CYD15  and  CYD23)  and  supportive  long-term  follow-up  studies  (CYD22,  CYD28  and 
CYD65). Antibody persistence (in terms of GMTs) was evaluated each year, for up to 4 years after the 
last injection in CYD22 and CYD28 and for up to 5 years in pivotal studies CYD14 and CYD15. In CYD23 
persistence was assessed 1 year after the last injection. CYD65 includes assessment up to 2 years after 
the last injections; however, results up to 1 year were available at the time of this addendum. 
Results in Seropositive Subjects Aged 9 to 17 Years (3-Dose Schedule) 
The number of baseline dengue seropositive subjects aged 9 to 17 years contributing to the evaluation 
of Ab persistence is presented in the table below. 
Table 31. Seropositive subjects aged 9 to 17 years contributing to Ab persistence database 
by age group - FAS and FASI 
As shown in the table below, an overall decline in GMTs for each serotype compared to PD3 GMTs was 
observed particularly one year after the 3rd injection of the CYD dengue vaccine. 
GMTs then reached a plateau and stabilized about 2 years after the third injection. Subsequently, they 
remained at similar levels or experimented a lesser decrease for each serotype up to 4 years in CYD22 
and CYD28, and up to 5 years in CYD14. In CYD14, during Year 3 post-injection 3, there was a slight 
increase  of  GMTs  for  each  serotype,  particularly  for  serotype  2.  As  it  was  observed  in  both  the  CYD 
dengue vaccine and control group, possibly related to wild type virus circulation. 
A similar pattern was observed in both regions; however, in CYD15, an increase in GMTs was observed 
at 4 years post-injection 3, decreasing, during the last follow-up year (i.e. 5 years post injection 3) to 
levels comparable to those at 3 years post-injection 3. This increase, observed both in the CYD dengue 
vaccine and control groups, could be explained by the Zika outbreak that occurred in Latin America and 
the  Caribbean  during  the 3rd  year  of CYD15  study  follow up  given  the  structural  similarities  between 
both dengue and Zika viruses that may result in immunological cross-reactivity.

During  the  long-term  follow-up  GMTs  for  each  serotype  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  group  remained 
mostly higher at the yearly time points up to 5 years PD3 compared to baseline values and remained 
higher than GMTs observed in the control group.

Results in Seropositive Subjects Aged 9 to 17 Years 
Results of persistence of immunogenicity from efficacy studies CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23 as well as from 
supportive long-term follow-up studies CYD22, CYD28 and CYD65 were presented. Antibody persistence 
was evaluated in terms of GMTs for up to 4 years after the last injection in CYD22 and CYD28 and up to 
5 years in pivotal studies CYD14 and CYD15. In CYD23 and CYD65, persistence results are presented 1 
year after the last injection.  
The CHMP considered that all relevant studies were included in this analysis. However, results of CYD14 
study are the only ones that can be compared between age groups. CYD22, CYD23 and CYD28 studies 
included  different  age  range  groups  but  the  number  of  subjects  were  limited  and  therefore  results 
interpretation is not warranted. No results for studies conducted in LatAm are available for the 6-8 and 
2-5 years age groups. 
The  number  of  ‘loss  of  FU’  was  limited  in  most  of  the  studies  and  97%  of  the  CYD14  subjects  were 
followed up to Year 5 (n=481 pre-D1 and n=465 post-5Y).  
Ab  persistence  data  interpretation  is  complicated  by  the  variable  serotype-specific  vaccine-induced 
immune responses and also by, as mentioned by the MAH, the probable occurrence of wild type virus 
circulation  during  the  Year  3  in  countries  where  study  CYD14  was  conducted.  GMTs  observed  in  the 
control group at Year 3 were higher than at baseline but similar than at Year 1, which might also suggest 
a (more intense) virus circulation during the first year following vaccination, in one or more countries 
were the study was conducted. These findings suggest than the GMTs at Year 1 observed in the vaccinees 
group  might  be  overestimated  and  that  a  more  marked  decrease  would  have  been  observed.  This  is 
consistent with the absence of Serotype 3-GMTs decrease during the first year following vaccination and 
the overall higher GMTs decrease observed at Year 1 in study CYD15. 
Overall, there was a trend for decreased GMTs against all 4 serotypes from PD3 through Year 5. Of note, 
GMTs for each serotype remained at higher levels than those observed at baseline in all age groups.   
GMTs at Year 5 in the vaccinated group were higher, for each serotype, than in the control group.  
The  effect  of  the  possible  virus  circulation  during  the  study  conduct  on  the  serotype-specific  immune 
response at Year 5 and over a longer period is not known. Ab persistence in vaccinated subjects living 
outside endemic countries is therefore not known. 
In the absence of ICP, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
GMTs  for  each  serotype  observed  in  CYD15  study  also  tend  to  decrease  over  years.  However,  as 
mentioned  by  the  MAH,  a  ZIKA  outbreak  occurred  during  Year  4,  therefore  no  firm  conclusion  on  Ab 
persistence up to Year 5 can be drawn. Results observed at Year 4 might be due to immunological cross-
reactivity (See efficacy assessment). 
Results in Seropositive Subjects Aged 6 to 8 Years 
The number baseline dengue seropositive subjects aged 6 to 8 years contributing to the evaluation of 
Ab persistence is presented in the table below.

Table 33. Seropositive subjects aged 6 to 8 years contributing to Ab persistence database - 
FAS and FASI 
All data for the analysis of the individuals aged 6 to 8 years come from studies conducted in the Asia 
Pacific  endemic  region.  An  overall  decline  in  GMTs  for  each  serotype  compared  to  PD3  GMTs  was 
observed  over  the  2  years  after  the  third  dose.  GMTs  then  stabilized  or  slightly  decreased  for  each 
serotype up to 4 years in CYD22 and CYD28, and up to 5 years in CYD14 after the 3rd vaccine injection. 
The slight increase in GMTs observed in subjects aged 9 to 17 years from CYD14 during the 3rd year 
post-injection 3 was also observed in subjects aged 6 to 8 years. 
During  the  long-term  follow  up  GMTs  for  each  serotype  in  the  CYD  dengue  vaccine  group  remained 
overall, at higher levels than those observed at baseline and remained higher than or similar (serotype 
1) to GMTs observed in the control group. 
Overall, Ab persistence up to 5 years in seropositive subjects aged 6 to 8 years followed a similar pattern 
to that observed in subjects aged 9 to 17 years.

Results in Seropositive Subjects Aged 6 to 8 Years 
Results  of  persistence  of  immunogenicity  from  efficacy  studies  CYD14  and  CYD23  as  well  as  from 
supportive long-term follow-up studies CYD22 and CYD28, all conducted in AP region, were presented. 
Antibody persistence was evaluated in terms of GMTs for up to 4 years after the last injection in CYD22 
and CYD28 and up to 5 years in pivotal study CYD14. In CYD23, Ab persistence results are presented 1 
year after the last injection. No LatAm study results were presented.  
The CHMP considered that, in studies CYD22 and CYD28, very few vaccinated subjects were included, 
i.e.  n=17  and  n=8  respectively.  Sample  size  of  study  CYD23  was  also  limited  (n  vaccinees=66). 
Assessment was therefore mainly focused on CYD14 study data. The number of ‘loss of FU’ was limited 
in most of the studies and 98% of the CYD14 subjects were followed up to Year 5 (n=168 pre-D1 and 
n=164 post-5Y).  
Overall, Ab persistence up to 5 years in seropositive subjects aged 6 to 8 years followed a similar pattern 
to that observed in subjects aged 9 to 17 years. GMTs observed at Year 5 were lower in the 6-8 years 
when compared to the 9-17 years age groups. GMTs at Year 5 were higher in the vaccinated group, for 
each serotype, than in the control group. For the 6 to 8 years aged control group, as for the vaccinated 
group, similar pattern of GMTs than in subjects aged 9 to 17 years was observed.  
In the absence of ICP, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
Results in Seropositive Subjects Aged 2 to 5 Years 
The table below present the number of subjects of this age group contributing to long term 
persistence.

All data for the analysis of the individuals aged 2 to 5 years come from studies conducted in the Asia 
Pacific  endemic  region.  As  illustrated  in  the  table  below,  one  year  after  the  3rd  injection  of  the  CYD 
dengue  vaccine,  an  overall  decline  in  GMTs  for  each  serotype  compared  to  PD3  GMTs  was  observed. 
However, values remained overall higher compared to baseline. 
Individuals aged 2 to 5 years showed lower baseline, PD3 GMTs and showed a more pronounced decrease 
of GMTs compared to those aged 6 to 8 years.

Results in Seropositive Subjects Aged 2 to 5 Years 
Results  of  persistence  of  immunogenicity  from  efficacy  studies  CYD14  and  CYD23  as  well  as  from 
supportive  long-term  follow-up  studies  CYD22  and  CYD28,  all  conducted  in  the  AP  region,  were 
presented. Antibody persistence was evaluated in terms of GMTs for up to 4 years after the last injection 
in CYD22 and CYD28 and up to 5 years in pivotal study CYD14. In CYD23, Ab persistence results are 
presented 1 year after the last injection. No LatAm study results were presented.  
The  CHMP  considered  that,  in  studies  CYD22,  CYD23  and  CYD28,  very  few  vaccinated  subjects  were 
included, i.e. n=24, n=14 and n=9 respectively. As for the other age groups, assessment was mainly 
focused on CYD14 study data. 
The  number  of  ‘loss  of  FU’  was  limited  in  most  of  the  studies  and  99%  of  the  CYD14  subjects  were 
followed up to Year 5 (n=240 pre-D1 and n=238 post-5Y). 
Overall, Ab persistence up to 5 years in seropositive subjects aged 2 to 5 years followed a similar pattern 
to that observed in subjects aged 6 to 8 and 9 to 17 years. GMTs at Year 5 were higher in the vaccinated 
group, for each serotype, than in the control group. GMTs observed at Year 5 were lower in the 2-5 years 
when compared to the 6-8 years age groups. 
In the absence of ICP, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical immunogenicity 
Overall design and immunogenicity methods 
The integrated immunogenicity analysis included results of 12 studies, i.e. two large-scale pivotal efficacy 
studies  CYD14  and  CYD15,  and  10  supportive  studies  CYD13,  CYD22,  CYD24,  CYD28,  CYD30,  CYD65 
(Phase  2  studies),  CYD23  (Phase  2b),  CYD32  (Phase  3)  and  CYD71  and  CYD67  (Phase  3b,  co-
administration studies).  
All 12 clinical trials were conducted in healthy subjects (2-50 yoa) in endemic regions (Asia Pacific and 
Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean)  and  are  consistent  in  terms  of  the  general  study  design,  vaccine 
formulation  and  schedule.  Although  twelve  studies  were  included  in  the  integrated  immunogenicity 
analysis, only 6 of them included children from 2-8 yoa.   
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 103/116 
 
 
 
 
 
The design of most of the individual studies was already assessed at initial MAA and deemed appropriate. 
The laboratory was blinded to the treatment group when performing all testing. The FU duration varied 
across studies. It is considered that all relevant studies were included in this analysis. 
Dengue  immunogenicity  was  evaluated  based  on  PRNT50  results.  The  validated  assay  was  the  core 
immunologic  assay  for  measuring  functional  antibodies  able  to  neutralize  dengue  virus  in  studies 
submitted  at  the  initial  MAA.  The  assay  methodology  is  in  line  with  WHO  recommendation  and  was 
deemed  acceptable  although  specificity  might  not  be  optimal  due  to  cross-reactivity  with  other 
flaviviruses.  
The dengue serostatus at baseline was defined as previously, i.e. seropositive if the PRNT50 titre was ≥
10 against at least one serotype, and seronegative if PRNT50 titre was < lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) against any of the four dengue serotypes in the baseline sample. 
Analysis were performed on the full analysis set (FAS) or the FAS for the immunogenicity subset (FASI), 
as appropriate. The FAS was defined as all subjects who received at least one injection of the CYD dengue 
vaccine or control vaccine, and who had at least 1 blood sample drawn and 1 valid post-injection serology 
result. In studies in which only a subset of subjects was followed-up for immunogenicity (i.e. CYD14, 
CYD15, CYD23, CYD28), the FASI was defined as described for the FAS. 
The main objective of the integrated immunogenicity analysis was to provide an overview of the humoral 
immune response against each dengue serotype induced by the CYD dengue vaccine, according to age 
and region, in baseline dengue seropositive subjects, with a focus on the response 28 days PD3. Other 
objectives were to provide an overview of the persistence of the humoral immune response to the CYD 
dengue vaccine using baseline, 28 days PD3, and yearly PD3 time points, according to age group and 
region, in baseline seropositive subjects, using data collected from the pivotal and supportive studies 
with LTFUs. 
Results  were  compared  between  age  ranges  of  2-5,  6-8  and  9-17  which  is  appropriate;  VE  results 
presented at initial MAA suggested that children <9 yoa, and particularly children 6-8 yoa, may benefit 
from vaccination. 
Analyses were not pooled between both endemic regions (AP and LatAm) which is deemed appropriate 
because of difference in epidemiology, in age range, and in YF/JE vaccination status. Results could be 
expected to be study- and population-related. Results were presented by study to give an overview of 
the  GMTs  range,  but  were  also  presented  pooled  for  the  Endemic  AP  region  for  the  6-8  yoa  children. 
Data of this pooled analysis support the findings observed in the main CYD14 study that are presented 
in the SmPC. 
Results 
1. Comparison and Analyses of Results Across Studies 
Although twelve studies were included  in the integrated immunogenicity analysis, results of only 6 of 
them  allow  comparison  of  Pre-D1  and  PD3  data  by  age  strata,  since  CYD65,  CYD67,  CYD13,  CYD15, 
CYD30 and CYD71 did not include children from 2-8 yoa. 
Several studies included only very few seropositive subjects, particularly in the 2-5 and 6-8 years age 
groups, either in the vaccine or control groups or in both groups. Children 6-8 years are nearly exclusively 
from AP countries (as are children from 2-5 years), while children 9-17 are from both regions, although 
mainly from LatAm. Due to this limited number of included subjects result interpretation is difficult in 
some  studies.  An  imbalance  in  gender  was  observed  between  vaccine  and  placebo  groups  in  certain 
studies. Mean age was generally well balanced between both groups in each of the studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 104/116 
 
 
 
All studies were conducted in endemic regions. The proportion of baseline dengue seropositive subjects 
increased with age, which is consistent with the dengue epidemiology and the observation made during 
the initial MAA. Seropositivity rates at baseline were overall well balanced between vaccine and control 
groups and ranged between 47.5%-49.2% for 2 to 5 years, 55.4%-62.0% for 6 to 8 years, and 70.3%-
74.4% for 9 to 17 years. 
Overall, pre-D1 GMTs were higher in older subjects than in younger subjects (i.e. GMTs in 9 to 17 years 
> 6 to 8 years > 2 to 5 years). Baseline GMTs varied across studies due to, as explained by the MAH, 
different endemic settings and therefore different natural dengue exposure. Although highly plausible, 
this interpretation was not supported by a description of the dengue epidemiology of countries at the 
time of study conduct.  
Because  of  the  low  number  of  seropositive  subjects  included  in  all  the  studies,  with  the  exception  of 
study  CYD14,  the  assessment  was  mainly  focused  on  the  PD3  results  obtained  in  the  CYD14  study. 
Higher PD3 nAb titers were observed in the 9-17 year age group when compared to 6-8 years age group. 
PD3 nAb titers were higher for serotypes 3 and 4 in the 6-8 year age group when compared to 2-5 years 
age group (although 95%CI were overlapping). In contrast, PD3 nAb titers were similar between both 
groups for Serotype 1 and Serotype 2, although baseline GMTs were higher in the 6-8 years group when 
compared to the 2-5 years group. Consequently, GMTRs were higher for the 2-5 years age group when 
compared to the 6-8 years group. In all age groups, GMTs tend to be consistently lower for Serotype 4 
when  compared  to  Serotypes  1-3  GMTs.  Serotype  4  GMTRs  were  nevertheless  roughly  similar  than 
Serotypes 1-3 GMTRs. 
In the absence of ICP, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Meanwhile, VE was evaluated 
in study CYD14 for the different age groups. VE against VCD due to serotypes 1 and 2 tend to be lower 
than for serotypes 3 and 4 for which is not consistent with the immunogenicity findings.  
The  MAH  proposes  to  update  the  SmPC  with  baseline  and  PD3  immunogenicity  data  observed  in 
seropositive  subjects included in the  CYD14 study. Since, the data of the pooled analysis for 6-8 yoa 
children  included  in  studies  conducted  in  AP  regions  support  the  findings  of  study  CYD14,  this  is 
endorsed.  
2. Ab persistence 
Results of persistence of immunogenicity from efficacy studies CYD14, CYD15 and CYD23 as well as from 
supportive long-term follow-up studies CYD22, CYD28 and CYD65 were presented. Antibody persistence 
was evaluated in terms of GMTs for up to 4 years after the last injection in CYD22 and CYD28 and up to 
5 years in pivotal studies CYD14 and CYD15. In CYD23 and CYD65, persistence results are presented 1 
year after the last injection.  
As mentioned earlier, it is considered that all relevant studies were included in this analysis. However, 
results  of  CYD14  study  are  the  only  ones  that  can  be  compared  between  age  groups  because  (i)  No 
LatAm study results for children aged 2-8 years were presented, and (ii) although including different age 
range groups, because of the limited number of subjects included in CYD22, CYD23 and CYD28 studies, 
results interpretation was not warranted.  
The number of ‘loss of FU’ was limited in most of the studies and 97-99% of the CYD14 subjects were 
followed up to Year 5. 
Overall, Ab persistence up to 5 years in seropositive subjects aged 2 to 5, 6 to 8 and 9-17 years followed 
a similar pattern. A trend for a decrease in GMTs against all 4 serotypes from PD3 through Year 5 was 
observed. GMTs for each serotype remained at higher levels than those observed at baseline in all age 
groups and were higher compared to those observed in the control groups (any age). GMTs observed at 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 105/116 
 
 
 
 
Year 5 were lower in the 2-5 years when compared to the 6-8 years, and in the 6-8 years when compared 
to the 9-17 years age groups. 
Ab  persistence  data  interpretation  is  complicated  by  the  variable  serotype-specific  vaccine-induced 
immune  responses  and  also  by  the  wild  type  virus  circulation  during  the  CYD14  study  conduct.  GMT 
result observed in the control group suggest a possible (more intense) virus circulation not only during 
the Year 3 but also during the Year 1, in one or more countries were the study was conducted. Therefore, 
the  GMTs  at  Year  1  observed  in  the  vaccinees  group  might  be  overestimated  and  a  more  marked 
decrease would have been observed in absence of such virus circulation. Circulation of other pathogens 
might also influence the duration and magnitude of Ab titers; An increase in Ab titers was observed at 
Year 4 in study CYD15, which corresponded to the occurrence of ZIKA outbreak (9-17 yoa subjects).  
The MAH further investigated the effects of Zika infection on dengue-neutralizing antibody responses in 
a post-hoc analysis of data from the CYD15 study (Zambrano 2021).  Serologically suspected Zika was 
detected in nearly half of the participants who had a sample at Year 4. 
In the placebo group, dengue-neutralizing antibody levels increased between pre- and post-Zika period 
in  those  who  had  serological  evidence  of  Zika,  for  all  serotypes.  In  the  vaccine  group,  dengue-
neutralizing antibody levels increased to a lesser extend for serotype 1 and 3, and did not increase for 
serotype 2 and 4. 
Therefore, while dengue  ab levels were higher  in the vaccinated vs. placebo subjects  before the Zika 
outbreak for all serotypes, it was not the case after the Zika outbreak anymore in those with evidence 
of Zika infection. For these subjects, in contrast with the pre-Zika period, after the Zika outbreak, the 
level of dengue neutralizing antibody achieved in the placebo was similar compared to the vaccinated 
group (overlapping 95% CIs), except for serotype 4 were it was still higher in the vaccinated.. 
The impact of immunological cross-reactivity between assay on the results is not clear. 
In  those  without  evidence  of  Zika  infection,  dengue  neutralizing  antibodies  are  still  higher  in  the 
vaccinated vs. placebo subjects after the Zika outbreak.  
As  the  Zika  infection  attack  rate  was  substantial  during  Year  4,  this  affected  the  overall  level  of 
neutralizing antibodies during Year 4 (and Year 5). 
The effect of the possible virus circulation on the serotype-specific immune response at Year 5 and over 
a longer period is not known. Ab persistence in vaccinated subjects living outside endemic countries is 
therefore not known. 
In the absence of ICP, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Similarly to immunogenicity, 
the persistence of efficacy in vaccinated subjects living outside endemic countries is neither not known. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical immunogenicity 
There are limited data on immune response 1 month following vaccination in 6-8 yoa children. These 
data, from the main study CYD14, indicate that, higher PD3 nAb titers were observed in the 9-17 years 
age group when compared to 6-8 years age group. PD3 nAb titers were also higher for serotypes 3 and 
4 in the 6-8 year age group when compared to 2-5 years age group (although 95%CI were overlapping). 
In contrast, PD3 nAb titers were similar between both groups for Serotype 1 and Serotype 2, although 
baseline GMTs were higher in the 6-8 years group when compared to the 2-5 years group.   
In all age groups, GMTs tend to be consistently lower for serotype 4 when compared to serotypes 1-3 
GMTs. Meanwhile, VE was evaluated in study CYD14 for the different age groups. VE against VCD due 
to  serotypes  1  and  2  were  lower  than  for  serotypes  3  and  4  for  which  is  not  consistent  with  the 
Assessment report

immunogenicity findings. 
Overall, a trend for a decrease in GMTs against all 4 serotypes from PD3 through Year 5 was observed 
in seropositive subjects aged 2 to 5, 6 to 8 and 9-17 years. GMTs observed at Year 5 were lower in the 
2-5 years when compared to the 6-8 years, and in the 6-8 years when compared to the 9-17 years age 
groups.  GMTs  for  each  serotype  remained  at  higher  levels  than  those  observed  at  baseline  in  all  age 
groups.  
The effect of the possible virus (dengue and/or other flaviviruses) circulation during study conduct on 
the serotype-specific immune response at Year 5 and over a longer period is not known. Ab persistence 
in vaccinated subjects living outside endemic countries is therefore not known.  
In the absence of ICP, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
2.5.  Update of the Product information 
With this variation, the MAH applied for an extension of the approved indication (SmPC section 4.1) to 
include  children  6  to  8  years  of  age  dengue  seropositive  at  baseline  (new  text  is  shown  as  bold 
underlined and deleted text marked as strikethrough): 
Dengvaxia is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 
and 4 in individuals 9 6 to 45 years of age with prior dengue virus infection and living in endemic areas. 
As a consequence of this change in indications in Section 4.1, Sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
were also updated.  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, instructions for the installation of the needle were added in the SmPC (Section 6.6) and 
the Package Leaflet of the single-dose presentation, as follows: 
Attach  a  sterile  needle  to  the  pre-filled  syringe  for  the  transfer  of  the  solvent.  The needle must be 
fitted firmly to the syringe, rotating it by a one-quarter turn. 
2.5.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. Proposed new text is in line with the 
latest QRD template, written in a language understandable by the patient and does not impact the design 
and layout of the Package Leaflet. In addition, given the age range of the proposed added population in 
this application (6 to 8 years old children), the Package Leaflet is intended to be used by the parents 
and/or caregivers.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In the EU, at the time of this variation application, Dengvaxia was indicated for the prevention of dengue 
disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in individuals 9 to 45 years of age with prior 
dengue virus infection and living in endemic areas.  
The MAH seeks to extend the indication to include also children 6-8 years of age. 
The  proposed  indication  is:  ‘Dengvaxia  is  indicated  for  the  prevention  of  dengue  disease  caused  by 
dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in individuals 6 to 45 years of age with prior dengue virus infection 
and living in endemic areas.’ 
The current vaccination schedule consists of 3 injections 6-month apart. 
Dengue is an acute, systemic viral infection caused by a virus transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti 
mosquito  bites.  The  infection  may  be  asymptomatic,  cause  flu-like  illness,  and  can  develop  into  a 
potentially lethal complication called severe dengue (including dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]/dengue 
shock syndrome [DSS]). According to CDC, an estimated 1 in 4 dengue virus infections are symptomatic. 
Symptomatic dengue virus infection most commonly presents as a mild to moderate, nonspecific, acute 
febrile  illness.  Approximately  1  in  20  patients  with  dengue  virus  disease  progress  to  develop  severe 
dengue.  Severe  dengue  is  a  potentially  fatal  complication,  due  to  plasma  leaking,  fluid  accumulation, 
respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is the most 
severe form of dengue disease and results from hypovolaemia caused by vascular leakage.  
There are 4 types of closely related but antigenically distinct dengue virus serotypes (1, 2, 3, and 4). 
Primary  dengue  virus  infection  is  thought  to  provide  lifelong  protection  against  the  infecting  serotype 
and transient cross-protection against heterologous serotypes. Dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue 
shock  syndrome  occur  mostly  in  individuals  during  secondary  dengue  virus  infection  with  a  different 
serotype.  Increased  risk  in  secondary  infection  is  thought  to  be  linked  to  antibody-dependent 
enhancement of virus infection in Fc receptor–bearing cells and the generation of a large infected cell 
mass in vivo The antibody-mediated enhancement of dengue seems to be related with the presence of 
suboptimal neutralizing heterotypic antibodies (that accelerate the rate of internalization of the virus and 
infection of host cells), and may also be related to the presence of memory T cells with low affinity for 
the present infecting virus but high affinity for previous infecting serotype(s).  
Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease in humans, spreading globally during the past 
30  years  as  a  result  of  changes  in  human  ecology.  The  rapidly  expanding  global  footprint  of  dengue 
inflicts a significant public health, economic and social burden on the populations of endemic areas. Half 
of the world's population is now considered at risk of infection by the dengue viruses. Dengue disease is 
a public health concern in more than 128 countries, with the four dengue virus serotypes found in tropical 
and  sub-tropical  regions,  including  some  European  territories.  Dengue  is  endemic  in  Asia,  the  Pacific 
area, Africa, and Latin America (including the Caribbean). Sustained transmission of dengue fever does 
not  naturally  occur  in  continental  Europe,  though  sporadic  autochthonous  dengue  cases  had  been 
reported in Croatia in 2010 and in France in 2010, 2013, 2014, and 2015, even if more limited. Dengue, 
however,  is  endemic  in  the  overseas  territories  of  some  European  countries  such  as  France  (French 
Guiana, Martinique, and Guadeloupe).

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is no specific treatment for dengue disease. The management of dengue disease is supportive, 
with  control  of  fever  and  pain  with  antipyretics/analgesics,  and  adequate  fluid  intake.  Supportive 
intensive care and fluid management are the mainstays of therapy for severe disease. 
Up to the end of 2015, the only available prevention of dengue by vector control has proven to be of 
limited success, very difficult to sustain and costly. Vaccination provides an alternative in disease control 
measures. The only vaccine currently on the market is Dengvaxia. 
Dengue  disease  affects  all  age  groups.  The  age  distribution  of  infected  individuals  varies  between 
countries. For example, incidence rates were highest in adults in Mexico, Malaysia, and in the French 
Caribbean, highest in adolescents in Brazil and Thailand, and highest in children in the Philippines and 
Colombia. Additionally, the population at highest risk can shift over time, as was observed in Colombia 
and Thailand over the last decade. 
Similarly  to  adults,  children  experiencing  a  secondary  dengue  infection  have  a  much  higher  risk  of 
developing severe dengue. Children are however at a higher risk of severe dengue. Young children in 
particular  may  be  less  able  than  adults  to  compensate  for  capillary  leakage  and  are  consequently  at 
greater risk of dengue shock. National surveillance data from Asian countries show that infants under 1 
year of age and children aged 4–9 years have consistently been at the highest risk for severe dengue 
disease (Guzman 2002, Verhagen 2014), underlying the need to vaccinate children below 9 yoa. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  MAH  presented  integrated  analyses  of  efficacy,  immunogenicity,  and  safety  carried  out  with  the 
existing  overall  clinical  dataset,  updated  with  new  available  data  since  MAA.  Data  in  the  new  target 
population (6 to 8 years) were presented along with an outline of the data in subjects 9 to 17 years and 
2  to  5  years  (as  benchmark  and  to  update  results  from  the  prior  submission).  The  efficacy  and 
immunogenicity  data  focus  on  subjects  dengue-immune  at  baseline,  in  line  with  current  labelling 
recommendations. General safety data are presented irrespective of serostatus, and in dengue immune 
subjects. 
The integrated analyses of efficacy include data from two Phase 3 efficacy trials and one Phase 2b PoC 
trial. The Phase 3 pivotal efficacy trials were CYD14 (children 2 to 14 years in AP countries) and CYD15 
(children 9 to 16 years in LatAm). The Phase 2b PoC study CYD23/CYD57 was performed in Thailand in 
subjects aged 4 to 11 years. Since MAA, the data were updated with the final results of the 2 pivotal 
efficacy studies for which data of 5 years follow-up after the last dose are now available. Efficacy data 
in the new target population of the claimed indication (children 6 to 8 years) and in children 2-5 years 
are mainly from CYD14 (and limited data from CYD23), while data in children 9-16 years are both from 
CYD14 and CYD15 (and limited data from CYD23). Analyses are limited to subjects for whom baseline 
serostatus  data  are  available.  For  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  analyses  (FASI,  pooled  over  studies), 
there  were  236  and  126  seropositive  subjects  6-8  years  respectively  in  the  CYD  and  Control  Groups. 
There  were  1619  and  784  children  9-16  years,  and  259  and  115  children  2  to  5  years,  in  respective 
groups. Approximately 70% of the subjects in the Immunogenicity Subset are dengue seropositive at 
baseline. The NS1 Supplemental Analyses are presented in support, as this allowed an assessment on a 
larger  number  of  cases.  The  sub-cohort  of  the  NS1  case-cohort  study  included  a  random  selection  of 
10%  of  the  entire  study  cohorts.  This  represented  3578  subjects  irrespective  of  serostatus  and  age 
(CYD14, n=1099; CYD15, n=2130; CYD23/57, n=349). Of these 3578 subjects, 374 were 6-8 years. All 
relevant cases were also included in the case-cohort analyses. The proportion of subjects classified as 
seropositive varied across the methods (62.4%-78.3%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 109/116 
 
 
 
The integrated immunogenicity analysis included results of 12 studies, i.e. two large-scale pivotal efficacy 
studies  CYD14  and  CYD15,  and  10  supportive  studies  CYD13,  CYD22,  CYD24,  CYD28,  CYD30,  CYD65 
(Phase  2  studies),  CYD23  (Phase  2b),  CYD32  (Phase  3)  and  CYD71  and  CYD67  (Phase  3b,  co-
administration studies). All 12 clinical trials were conducted in healthy subjects (2-50 yoa) in endemic 
regions (Asia Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean) and are consistent in terms of the general 
study design, vaccine formulation and schedule. Although twelve studies were included in the integrated 
immunogenicity analysis, only 6 of them included children from 2-8 years. Children 6-8 years are nearly 
exclusively from AP countries (as are children from 2-5 years), while children 9-17 are from both regions, 
although  mainly  from  LatAm.  Because  of  the  low  number  of  seropositive  subjects  included  in  all  the 
studies, with the exception of study CYD14, the assessment was mainly focused on the results obtained 
in the CYD14 study, that included 168 6-8 years vaccinated children.  
The  pooled/integrated  safety  analysis  includes  22  clinical  studies  used  for  the  evaluation  of  the  CYD 
dengue vaccine final formulation, in subjects aged ≥ 6 years irrespective of the vaccination schedule (“all 
studies”): 3 Phase I (CYD04, CYD05, and CYD06), 2 Phase IIa (CYD10 and CYD11), 9 Phase II (CYD12, 
CYD13,  CYD22,  CYD24,  CYD28,  CYD30,  CYD47,  CYD51,  and  CYD65  [intermediate  results  –  until 
approximately one year after the primary series]), 2 Phase IIb (CYD23/57), 4 Phase III (CYD14, CYD15, 
CYD17, and CYD32) and 2 Phase IIIb (CYD71 and CYD67). Data from 17 of these studies using the final 
formulation and a 3-dose vaccination schedule at Day 0, Month 6 and Month 12 (D0/M6/M12) in subjects 
≥  6  years,  are  referred  to  in  the  text  as  the  "Main  Studies"  (CYD12,  CYD13,  CYD14,  CYD15,  CYD17, 
CYD22, CYD24, CYD28, CYD30, CYD32, CYD47, CYD51, CYD65, CYD67, CYD71, CYD23/57). The safety 
profile of the CYD dengue vaccine in subjects aged 6 to 8 years according to the 3-dose schedule was 
evaluated  based  on  pooled  data  of  6  studies  (CYD14,  CYD22,  CYD23/CYD57,  CYD24,  CYD28,  and 
CYD32).  A  total  of  3233  and  768  individuals  aged  6  to  8  years  regardless  of  the  baseline  dengue 
serostatus were considered for general safety and reactogenicity, respectively. Among subjects from the 
combined regions with an available dengue serostatus (529 out of 3233 subjects), 294 were baseline 
seropositive (55.6%). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy  was  assessed  post  hoc  in  seropositive  subjects  from  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  and  in  the 
supportive NS1 Supplemental analyses from the pivotal CYD14 and CYD15 trials. Vaccine efficacy was 
demonstrated  up  to  the  first  year  post-dose  3  in  the  population  6-16  years  living  in  high  endemic 
countries. 
Up to the first year post-dose 3, efficacy against virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) was demonstrated 
in  the  new  target  population  (6-8  years).  There  is  a  trend  towards  lower  efficacy  in  this  age  group 
(approximately 70%) compared to the 9-16 years (approximately 80%). Results in the Immunogenicity 
Subset  are  overall  supported  by  those  of  the  NS1  Supplemental  Analyses,  and  are  consistent  across 
methods  and  studies.  Overall,  in  the  population  6-16  years,  VE  was  79.9  %  (95%  CI:  66.9;  87.7) 
(Immunogenicity Subset, FASI, pooled analysis of CYD14 + CYD15+ CYD23). 
Data  up  to  the  first  year  post-dose  3  also  suggest  efficacy  against  hospitalised  VCD  in  both  age 
categories. For severe VCD, the number of cases is too limited to reliably estimate efficacy by age, but 
those numbers are in favour of Dengvaxia. Efficacy points estimates were higher compared to those of 
efficacy against VCD. Hospitalised VCD (HVCD) and severe VCD (SVCD) efficacies tended to decrease 
with  decreasing  age.  In  children  6-16  years  (NS1  Supplemental  analyses,  pooled  analysis 
CYD14+CYD15), efficacy against HVCD ranged between 90.3% (95% CI: 80.1; 95.3) and 95.7% (95% 
CI: 87.9; 98.5), while efficacy against SVCD ranged between 91.8% (95% CI: 72.3; 97.6) and 96.8% 
(95% CI: 75.9; 99.6). 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 110/116 
 
 
 
The long-term data (up to Year 6) indicate a decrease of efficacy over time after Year 2 (i.e. 1 year post-
dose 3).  
VCD efficacy (Active Phase) against serotype 2, and to a lesser extent against serotype 1, tends to be 
lower  compared  to  other  serotypes.  In  contrast  to  efficacy,  GMTs  tend  to  be  consistently  lower  for 
serotype 4 when compared to serotypes 1-3 GMTs.  
The limited immunogenicity data of the main study CYD14 indicate that higher post-dose 3 neutralizing 
antibody titers were observed in the 9-17 years age group when compared to 6-8 years age group. GMTs 
observed at Year 5 were also lower in the 6-8 years when compared to the 9-17 years age groups. 
A trend for a decrease in dengue-neutralizing antibody GMTs against all 4 serotypes from post-dose 3 
through Year 5 was observed. GMTs for each serotype remained at higher levels than those observed at 
baseline in all age categories. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Uncertainties remain with respect to the actual level of efficacy in seropositive individuals, in the various 
age categories. All efficacy analyses are post-hoc. The pivotal trials were not designed to assess efficacy 
according to dengue immune serostatus at baseline (the Immunogenicity Subset represents 10% of the 
population initially enrolled in the efficacy studies). To address this limitation, the MAH performed the 
post-hoc  NS1  Supplemental  Analyses.  Nevertheless,  the  power  of  the  analyses  remains  limited. 
Estimates in the 6-8 years are imprecise, for efficacy against VCD but even more for efficacy against 
less frequent endpoints such as HVCD and SVCD. In addition, there are limitations of the NS1 approaches 
to classify baseline serostatus (as the real false positive rate is unknown and biases related to differential 
misclassification are possible). It is nevertheless reassuring that efficacy results in the Immunogenicity 
Subset are in general supported by the NS1 Supplemental analyses (and consistent across methods).  
Efficacy data were generated in highly endemic populations (LatAm and Asia Pacific regions). The data 
for  the  6-8  years  children  were  generated  in  the  Asia  Pacific  regions.  There  is  no  efficacy  data  in  EU 
endemic territories. It is unclear to which extend the level of efficacy can be extrapolated to different 
epidemiological contexts such as areas of low endemicity and to EU travellers who have been previously 
infected with dengue. The level of efficacy is expected to be lower in areas of lower endemicity. The pre-
existing dengue immune status (magnitude and quality) and other aspects of the epidemiological context 
(such  as  pre-existing  immunity  related  to  the  various  serotype  circulation,  prior  infection  and/or 
vaccination  against  other  flaviviruses)  may  influence  efficacy.  It  was  observed  that  lower  baseline 
immunity is associated with lower immunogenicity.  
Efficacy  persistence  (VCD,  HVCD,  SVCD)  was  not  demonstrated  for  the  6-16  years  children  living  in 
endemic areas in the CYD14 and CYD15. Efficacy decreases over time starting from 1 year post-dose 3 
(i.e. after the Active Phase). Data are limited (only HVCD for Year 3 and Year 4) and estimates are very 
imprecise  from  Year  3  to  Year  6.  Overall,  considering  CYD14  and  CYD15  together,  persistence  of 
protection  appears  to  be  low  or  absent  after  the  Active  Phase.  At  Year  5-6,  efficacy  is  lacking/poorly 
sustained.  Results  are  inconsistent  between  the  Immunogenicity  Subset  (lack  of  efficacy  persistence) 
and the NS1 analyses (some level of efficacy still seen during the SEP (Years 5-6). 
Levels of specific nAb were shown to decrease over time. It is not known if the nAb titers will continue 
to decrease after more than 5 years post-third vaccination. 
Results  of  VE  against  VCD  due  to  each  serotype  during  the  SEP  tended  to  vary  across  studies  (NS1 
Supplemental Analyses). In CYD14, some persisting efficacy was observed for all serotypes. In CYD15, 
there is a lack of efficacy persistence for serotypes 1, 2 and 3, while efficacy against VCD is observed 
for serotype 4 during the SEP. Results are difficult to interpret due to small numbers, limitations of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 111/116 
 
 
 
post-hoc  NS1  analyses,  and  the  possible  impact  of  the  Zika  outbreak  that  occurred  in  Latin  America 
during the SEP. 
Protective immune responses and efficacy persistence could be affected by the wild type virus circulation 
(which can vary over year) and by the co-circulation of other flaviviruses. Influence on immune responses 
and efficacy could vary according to serotype.  
Uncertainties on persistence of immunity and efficacy is even greater for people living in low endemicity 
areas  and  for  EU  travellers  who  have  been  previously  infected  with  dengue  but  live  outside  endemic 
areas.  Persistence  of  efficacy  cannot  be  extrapolated  from  highly  endemic  areas  where  pre-existing 
immunity is higher and regular natural boosting of immunity occur, which may contribute to maintain 
efficacy over time.  
Based on efficacy persistence data, there is a need for booster  doses. Three studies (CYD63, CYD64, 
CYD65) investigated a booster dose at 1, 2, 4 or 5 years after the last injection of the 3-dose schedule 
in  subjects  9-50  years  living  in  Asian  and  LatAm  endemic  areas.  No  or  modest  transient  increase  of 
neutralizing Ab titers was observed after the boost. The booster effect was variable across serotypes and 
studies. Why there is a lack/limited booster effect with Dengvaxia remains not understood in terms of 
mechanisms  and  clinical  implications.  The  added  value  of  and  appropriate  timing  for  booster  doses 
remains to be elucidated according to the various epidemiological contexts and for travellers. 
Overall, vaccine efficacy against VCD, HVCD, and SVCD tends to be lower with lowering age. The reasons 
are  not  fully  understood.  The  independent  effect  of  age,  study  region  (local  epidemiology), 
misclassification  of  serostatus  (higher  false  positive  rate  in  the  youngest),  and  baseline  immunity 
(magnitude and quality) on the results, is difficult to disentangle. 
VE data are available for subjects 6-16 years of age. No efficacy data are available over 16 years.  
Analyses by serotype and age categories are statistically not meaningful (estimates were too imprecise). 
Only healthy subjects were included in the efficacy studies. No efficacy data are available in children with 
comorbidities,  or  in  immunocompromised  children  (individuals  presenting  with  congenital  or  acquired 
immunodeficiency, receiving immunosuppressive therapy). 
There  is  no  established  immunological  correlate  of  protection.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the 
immunogenicity results is unknown.  
There is no data yet on co-administration with other vaccines.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In subjects aged 6 to 8 years regardless of the baseline dengue serostatus, the safety profile of the CYD 
dengue vaccine and Placebo or Control were overall similar, as most of the various safety parameters 
were  reported  with  similar  frequencies  in  the  3  groups.  However,  a  trend  toward  a  slightly  higher 
incidence of solicited systemic reactions in the CYD dengue vaccine Group was observed. 
Most solicited reactions were Grade 1, occurred within 3 days after injection, and were of short duration. 
The  incidence  of  solicited  systemic  reactions  tended  to  decrease  with  subsequent  injections  while  the 
incidence of each solicited injection site reactions remained stable after each injection. Unsolicited AEs 
reported  during  the  28-day  monitoring  period  after  each  injection  were  common  medical  conditions 
normally observed in this age group and occurred with similar frequency compared to Placebo or Control 
Groups. Few of them were considered related to the CYD dengue vaccine. All SAEs reported, except one 
(a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), were considered as unrelated to vaccination, and were 
also similar in nature to that observed in the Placebo and Control Groups. There was no cluster of events 
Assessment report  
EMA/754269/2021  
Page 112/116 
 
 
 
in the 28-day period post-injection. No death was reported after CYD dengue vaccine administration in 
subjects aged 6 to 8 years. No viscerotropic events were reported in any study. No severe immediate 
anaphylactic reactions have been reported. No safety concerns were identified from the review of SAEs 
from the long-term follow-up of the CYD dengue vaccine clinical studies. In particular, no related SAEs 
have been reported during the long-term follow-up (up to 5 years after the last injection).  
Solicited  injection  site  reactions,  solicited  systemic  reactions  and  unsolicited  non-serious  AE  (mainly 
systemic) were observed at a lower frequencies in dengue seropositive subjects compared to all subjects 
regardless of baseline dengue serostatus. 
In the RMP, the important identified risks remain: allergic reactions (including anaphylactic reactions), 
and  increased  risk  of  severe  and/or  hospitalized  dengue  following  vaccination  in  individuals  not 
previously infected by dengue virus who are inadvertently vaccinated with Dengvaxia. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The majority of the vaccinated children aged 6 to 8 years (3179 children of the 3233) were from endemic 
Asia Pacific (AP), and all the subjects who provided ethnicity data were Asian (i.e. no ethnic origin data 
collected  for  the  54  children  in  the  LatAm  region).  Therefore,  the  representability  of  the  included 
population  is  questioned,  in  particular  concerning  the  extrapolation  of  one  epidemiological  context  to 
another in the context of the theoretical risk of cross-enhancement of other flaviviruses. 
Moreover, it is noteworthy that the safety database is limited for the dengue baseline positive children 
aged  6  to  8  years:  294  were  baseline  seropositive  among  those  with  an  available  dengue  serostatus 
(529 out of 3233 subjects). 
As identified in the RMP, the important potential risks are the vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease, 
the  vaccine-associated  neurotropic  disease,  and  the  risk  of  severe  dengue  disease  due  to  waning 
protection  against  dengue  disease  over  time.  And  the  missing  information  are  the  safety  in 
immunocompromised  subjects  (including  subjects  with  congenital  or  acquired  immune  deficiency,  or 
with  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  (HIV)  infection  with  impaired  immune  function)  and  co-
administration of CYD dengue. 
The  use  of  the  vaccine  in  subjects  who  did  not  yet  acquire  a  natural  immunity  against  dengue  virus 
(seronegatives) was associated with an identified risk for severe dengue, which can be potentially fatal. 
Therefore, the laboratory approaches and tests that will be used to confirm prior dengue exposure before 
vaccination are of importance. Those approaches are included in local PH recommendations and clinical 
guidelines.

Number of cases too limited 
The number of subjects with a SVCD was very 
low and precluded the calculation of VE. The 
data do not suggest an increased risk 
associated with vaccination, for both the

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy over the first two years was demonstrated against VCD in in the new target population of children 
aged 6 to 8 years. Data also suggest efficacy against hospitalised VCD and against severe VCD. Overall, 
vaccine efficacy against VCD, HVCD, and SVCD tends to be lower in the 6 to 8 years age group compared 
to  the  9-16  years.  VCD  VE  against  serotype  2,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  against  serotype  1,  is  lower 
compared to the other serotypes. Efficacy decreases over time after 1 year post-dose 3, whether some 
level of efficacy is maintained up to Year 6 post-vaccination is not clear (in the 6-8 years and in the 9-
16 years children). 
Overall, the safety profile of the CYD dengue vaccine in children aged 6 to 8 years was not different than 
the one in children aged 9 to 17 years, which are part of the population in which the vaccine was initially 
authorised. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Altogether, the benefit of Dengvaxia outweighs the unfavourable effects linked mainly to reactogenicity. 
The balance of benefits and risks in the new target population of 6-8 years is considered overall similar 
to that of older children. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Dengvaxia is positive. 
The extension of indication can be recommended for approval. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension  of  indications  to  include  paediatric  population  from  6  years  of  age  for  Dengvaxia;  as  a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and sections 1, 2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet 
are updated. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to add instructions for the installation of the 
needle in the SmPC and the Package Leaflet of the single-dose presentation.

Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan PIP EMEA-001545-PIP01-13-M02 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

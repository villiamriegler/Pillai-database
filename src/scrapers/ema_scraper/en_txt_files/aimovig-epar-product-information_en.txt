CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Aimovig is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per 
month. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of migraine. 
Posology 
Treatment is intended for patients with at least 4 migraine days per month when initiating treatment 
with erenumab. 
The recommended dose is 70 mg erenumab every 4 weeks. Some patients may benefit from a dose of 
140 mg every 4 weeks (see section 5.1).

Each 140 mg dose is given either as one subcutaneous injection of 140 mg or as two subcutaneous 
injections of 70 mg. 
Clinical studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients responding to therapy showed clinical 
benefit within 3 months. Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who 
have shown no response after 3 months of treatment. Evaluation of the need to continue treatment is 
recommended regularly thereafter. 
Special populations 
Elderly (aged 65 years and over) 
Aimovig has not been studied in elderly patients. No dose adjustment is required as the 
pharmacokinetics of erenumab are not affected by age. 
Renal impairment / hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Aimovig in children below the age of 18 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Aimovig is for subcutaneous use. 
Aimovig is intended for patient self-administration after proper training. The injections can also be 
given by another individual who has been appropriately instructed. The injection can be administered 
into the abdomen, thigh or into the outer area of the upper arm (the arm should be used only if the 
injection is being given by a person other than the patient; see section 5.2). Injection sites should be 
rotated and injections should not be given into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. 
Pre-filled syringe 
The entire contents of the Aimovig pre-filled syringe should be injected. Each pre-filled syringe is for 
single use only and designed to deliver the entire contents with no residual content remaining. 
Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the instructions for use in the package 
leaflet. 
Pre-filled pen 
The entire contents of the Aimovig pre-filled pen should be injected. Each pre-filled pen is for single 
use only and designed to deliver the entire contents with no residual content remaining. 
Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the instructions for use in the package 
leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Cardiovascular effect 
Patients with certain major cardiovascular diseases were excluded from clinical studies (see 
section 5.1). No safety data are available in these patients. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, angioedema, and anaphylactic reactions, have been 
reported with erenumab in post-marketing experience. These reactions may occur within minutes, 
although some may occur more than one week after treatment. In that context, patients should be 
warned about the symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions. If a serious or severe 
hypersensitivity reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated and treatment with erenumab 
should be discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Constipation 
Constipation is a common adverse reaction of erenumab and is usually mild or moderate in intensity. 
In a majority of the cases, the onset was reported after the first dose of erenumab; however patients 
have also experienced constipation later on in the treatment. In most cases constipation resolved 
within three months. In the post-marketing setting, constipation with serious complications has been 
reported with erenumab. In some of these cases hospitalisation was required, including cases where 
surgery was necessary. History of constipation or the concurrent use of medicinal products associated 
with decreased gastrointestinal motility may increase the risk for more severe constipation and the 
potential for constipation-related complications. Patients should be warned about the risk of 
constipation and advised to seek medical attention in case constipation does not resolve or worsens. 
Patients should seek medical attention immediately if they develop severe constipation. Constipation 
should be managed promptly as clinically appropriate. For severe constipation, discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered. 
Latex-sensitive individuals 
The removable cap of this medicinal product contains latex rubber. May cause severe allergic 
reactions. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No effect on exposure of co-administered medicinal products is expected based on the metabolic 
pathways of monoclonal antibodies. No interaction with oral contraceptives (ethinyl 
estradiol/norgestimate) or sumatriptan was observed in studies with healthy volunteers.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are a limited amount of data from the use of erenumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As 
a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Aimovig during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether erenumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in 
breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon 
afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. 
Afterwards, use of Aimovig could be considered during breast-feeding only if clinically needed. 
Fertility 
Animal studies showed no impact on female and male fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Aimovig is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
A total of over 2 500 patients (more than 2 600 patient years) have been treated with Aimovig in 
registration studies. Of these, more than 1 300 patients were exposed for at least 12 months and 
218 patients were exposed for 5 years. The overall safety profile of Aimovig remained consistent for 
5 years of long-term open-label treatment. 
The reported adverse drug reactions for 70 mg and 140 mg were injection site reactions (5.6%/4.5%), 
constipation (1.3%/3.2%), muscle spasms (0.1%/2.0%) and pruritus (0.7%/1.8%). Most of the 
reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Less than 2% of patients in these studies discontinued due 
to adverse reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 1 lists all adverse drug reactions that occurred in Aimovig-treated patients during the 12-week 
placebo-controlled periods of the studies, as well as in the post-marketing setting. Within each system 
organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In 
addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the 
following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to 
<1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Injection site reactions 
In the integrated 12-week placebo-controlled phase of the studies, injection site reactions were mild 
and mostly transient. There was one case of discontinuation in a patient receiving the 70 mg dose due 
to injection site rash. The most frequent injection site reactions were localised pain, erythema and 
pruritus. Injection site pain typically subsided within 1 hour after administration. 
Cutaneous and hypersensitivity reactions 
In the integrated 12-week placebo-controlled phase of the studies, non-serious cases of rash, pruritus 
and swelling/oedema were observed, which in the majority of cases were mild and did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation. 
In the post-marketing setting, cases of anaphylaxis and angiodoema were observed. 
Immunogenicity 
During the double-blind treatment phase of the clinical studies, the incidence of anti-erenumab 
antibody development was 6.3% (56/884) among subjects receiving a 70 mg dose of erenumab (3 of 
whom had in vitro neutralising activity) and 2.6% (13/504) among subjects receiving the 140 mg dose 
of erenumab (none of whom had in vitro neutralising activity). In an open-label study with up to 
256 weeks of treatment, the incidence of anti-erenumab antibody development was 11.0% (25/225) 
among patients who only received 70 mg or 140 mg of Aimovig throughout the entire study (2 of 
whom had in vitro neutralising activity). There was no impact of anti-erenumab antibody development 
on the efficacy or safety of erenumab. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
No cases of overdose have been reported in clinical studies. 
Doses up to 280 mg have been administered subcutaneously in clinical studies with no evidence of 
dose-limiting toxicity. 
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures 
instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, antimigraine preparations, ATC code: N02CD01 
Mechanism of action 
Erenumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) 
receptor. The CGRP receptor is located at sites that are relevant to migraine pathophysiology, such as 
the trigeminal ganglion. Erenumab potently and specifically competes with the binding of CGRP and 
inhibits its function at the CGRP receptor, and has no significant activity against other calcitonin 
family of receptors. 
CGRP is a neuropeptide that modulates nociceptive signalling and a vasodilator that has been 
associated with migraine pathophysiology. In contrast with other neuropeptides, CGRP levels have 
been shown to increase significantly during migraine and return to normal with headache relief. 
Intravenous infusion of CGRP induces migraine-like headache in patients. 
Inhibition of the effects of CGRP could theoretically attenuate compensatory vasodilation in 
ischaemic-related conditions. A study evaluated the effect of a single intravenous dose of 140 mg 
Aimovig in subjects with stable angina under controlled exercise conditions. Aimovig showed similar 
exercise duration compared to placebo and did not aggravate myocardial ischaemia in these patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Erenumab was evaluated for prophylaxis of migraine in two pivotal studies across the migraine 
spectrum in chronic and episodic migraine. In both studies, the patients enrolled had at least a 
12-month history of migraine (with or without aura) according to the International Classification of 
Headache Disorders (ICHD-III) diagnostic criteria. Elderly patients (>65 years), patients with opioid 
overuse in study in chronic migraine, patients with medication overuse in study in episodic migraine, 
and also patients with pre-existing myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, unstable 
angina, coronary artery bypass surgery or other re-vascularisation procedures within 12 months prior 
to screening were excluded. Patients with poorly controlled hypertension or BMI >40 were excluded 
from Study 1.

Chronic migraine 
Study 1 
Erenumab was evaluated as monotherapy for prophylaxis of chronic migraine in a randomised, 
multicentre, 12-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in patients suffering from migraine with 
or without aura (≥15 headache days per month with ≥8 migraine days per month). 
667 patients were randomised in a 3:2:2 ratio to receive placebo (n = 286) or 70 mg (n = 191) or 
140 mg (n = 190) erenumab, stratified by the presence of acute medication overuse (present in 41% of 
overall patients). Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments during the study. 
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between study arms. 
Patients had a median age of 43 years, 83% were female and 94% were white. The mean migraine 
frequency at baseline was approximately 18 migraine days per month. Overall, 68% had failed one or 
more previous prophylactic pharmacotherapies due to lack of efficacy or poor tolerability, and 49% 
had failed two or more previous prophylactic pharmacotherapies due to lack of efficacy or poor 
tolerability. A total of 366 (96%) patients in the erenumab arms and 265 (93%) patients in the placebo 
arm completed the study (i.e. completed Week 12 assessment). 
Reduction in mean monthly migraine days from placebo was observed in a monthly analysis from 
Month 1 and in a follow-up weekly analysis an onset of erenumab effect was seen from the first week 
of administration.

In patients failing one or more prophylactic pharmacotherapies the treatment difference for the 
reduction of monthly migraine days (MMD) observed between erenumab 140 mg and placebo 
was -3.3 days (95% CI: -4.6, -2.1) and between erenumab 70 mg and placebo -2.5 days (95% 
CI: -3.8, -1.2). In patients failing two or more prophylactic pharmacotherapies the treatment difference 
was -4.3 days (95% CI: -5.8; -2.8) between 140 mg and placebo and -2.7 days (95% CI: -4.2, -1.2) 
between 70 mg and placebo. There was also a higher proportion of subjects treated with erenumab 
who achieved at least 50% reduction of MMD compared to placebo in the patients failing one or more 
prophylactic pharmacotherapies (40.8% for 140 mg, 34.7% for 70 mg versus 17.3% for placebo), with 
an odds ratio of 3.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 5.5) for 140 mg and 2.6 (95% CI: 1.6, 4.5) for 70 mg. In patients 
failing two or more prophylactic pharmacotherapies the proportion was 41.3% for 140 mg and 35.6% 
for 70 mg versus 14.2% for placebo with an odds ratio of 4.2 (95% CI: 2.2, 7.9) and 3.5 (95% CI: 1.8, 
6.6), respectively.

Approximately 41% of patients in the study had medication overuse. The treatment difference 
observed between erenumab 140 mg and placebo and between erenumab 70 mg and placebo for the 
reduction of MMD in these patients was -3.1 days (95% CI: -4.8, -1.4) in both cases, and for the 
reduction of acute migraine-specific medication days was -2.8 (95% CI: -4.2, -1.4) for 140 mg 
and -3.3 (95% CI: -4.7, -1.9) for 70 mg. There was a higher proportion of patients in the erenumab 
group who achieved at least a 50% reduction of MMD compared to placebo (34.6% for 140 mg, 
36.4% for 70 mg versus 17.7% for placebo), with an odds ratio of 2.5 (95% CI: 1.3, 4.9) and 2.7 (95% 
CI: 1.4, 5.2), respectively. 
Efficacy was sustained for up to 1 year in the open-label extension of Study 1 in which patients 
received 70 mg and/or 140 mg erenumab. 74.1% of patients completed the 52-week extension. Pooled 
across the two doses, a reduction of -9.3 MMD was observed after 52 weeks relative to core study 
baseline. 59% of patients completing the study achieved a 50% response in the last month of the study. 
Episodic migraine 
Study 2 
Erenumab was evaluated for prophylaxis of episodic migraine in a randomised, multicentre, 24-week, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind study in patients suffering from migraine with or without aura 
(4-14 migraine days per month). 
955 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 140 mg (n = 319) or 70 mg (n = 317) 
erenumab or placebo (n = 319). Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments during the 
study. 
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between study arms. 
Patients had a median age of 42 years, 85% were female and 89% were white. The mean migraine 
frequency at baseline was approximately 8 migraine days per month. Overall, 39% had failed one or 
more previous prophylactic pharmacotherapies due to lack of efficacy or poor tolerability. A total of 
294 patients (92%) for 140 mg, 287 (91%) patients for 70 mg and 284 patients (89%) in the placebo 
arm completed the double-blind phase. 
Patients treated with erenumab had a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction from 
baseline in the frequency of migraine days from Months 4 to 6 (Figure 2) compared to patients 
receiving placebo. Differences from placebo were observed from Month 1 onwards.

In patients failing one or more prophylactic pharmacotherapies the treatment difference for the 
reduction of MMD observed between erenumab 140 mg and placebo was -2.5 (95% CI: -3.4, -1.7) and 
between erenumab 70 mg and placebo -2.0 (95% CI: -2.8, -1.2). There was also a higher proportion of 
subjects treated with erenumab who achieved at least 50% reduction of MMD compared to placebo 
(39.7% for 140 mg and 38.6% for 70 mg, with an odds ratio of 3.1 [95% CI: 1.7, 5.5] and 2.9 [95% 
CI: 1.6, 5.3], respectively). 
Efficacy was sustained up to 1 year in the active re-randomisation part of Study 2. Patients were 
re-randomised in the active treatment phase (ATP) to 70 mg or 140 mg erenumab. 79.8% completed 
the entire study out to 52 weeks. The reduction in monthly migraine days from baseline to Week 52 
was -4.22 in the 70 mg ATP group and -4.64 days in the 140 mg ATP group. At Week 52, the 
proportion of subjects who achieved a ≥50% reduction in MMD from baseline was 61.0% in the 
70 mg ATP and 64.9% in the 140 mg ATP group.

Long-term follow-up study 
Following a placebo-controlled study, 383 patients continued in an open-label treatment phase over 
5 years initially receiving erenumab 70 mg (median exposure: 2.0 years), of which 250 patients 
increased their dose to 140 mg (median exposure: 2.7 years). 214 completed the open-label treatment 
phase of 5 years. Of the 383 patients, 168 (43.9%) discontinued with the most common reasons being 
patient request (84 patients; 21.9%), adverse events (19 patients; 5.0%), lost to follow-up (14 patients; 
3.7%) and lack of efficacy (12 patients; 3.1%). The results indicate that efficacy was sustained for up 
to 5 years in the open-label treatment phase of the study. 
Study 3: Study in patients with previous failure or non-suitability of 2 to 4 migraine prophylactic 
pharmacotherapies 
246 adult patients with episodic migraine were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either erenumab 
140 mg (n = 121) or placebo (n = 125) for 12 weeks. Three patients (erenumab: 2, placebo: 1) were 
excluded from the primary analysis due to not having received study treatment. During the last 
4 weeks of the double-blind treatment, 30.3% (36/119) of patients in the erenumab group achieved at 
least a 50% reduction from baseline in MMD compared to 13.7% (17/124) in the placebo group 
(p = 0.002). 
Study 4: Study to assess tolerability (primary endpoint) and efficacy versus topiramate 
777 adult patients with episodic or chronic migraine were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
erenumab (70 mg or 140 mg, n = 389) or topiramate 50 to 100 mg (n=388) for 24 weeks (double-blind 
treatment phase). Safety and efficacy data were pooled for patients receiving the erenumab 70 mg and 
140 mg doses and compared with that for patients receiving topiramate. 
Erenumab demonstrated superior tolerability versus topiramate based on the rate of discontinuation of 
treatment due to adverse events (erenumab: 10.5%, topiramate: 38.9%; p <0.001; primary endpoint). 
Additionally, 55.4% of patients in the erenumab group achieved at least a 50% reduction from 
baseline in MMD during the last 3 months of the study, compared with 31.2% in the topiramate group 
(p <0.001). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Aimovig in prevention of migraine headaches in one or more subsets of the paediatric population (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Erenumab exhibits non-linear kinetics as a result of binding to the CGRP-R receptor. However, at 
therapeutically relevant doses, the pharmacokinetics of erenumab following subcutaneous dosing 
every 4 weeks are predominantly linear due to saturation of binding to CGRP-R. Subcutaneous 
administration of a 140 mg once monthly dose and a 70 mg once monthly dose in healthy volunteers 
resulted in a Cmax mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 15.8 (4.8) µg/ml and 6.1 (2.1) µg/ml, 
respectively, and AUClast mean (SD) of 505 (139) day*µg/ml and 159 (58) day*µg/ml, respectively. 
Less than 2-fold accumulation was observed in trough serum concentrations following 140 mg doses 
administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks and serum trough concentrations approached steady state 
by 12 weeks of dosing. 
Absorption 
Following a single subcutaneous dose of 140 mg or 70 mg erenumab administered to healthy adults, 
median peak serum concentrations were attained in 4 to 6 days, and estimated absolute bioavailability 
was 82%. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Following a single 140 mg intravenous dose, the mean (SD) volume of distribution during the terminal 
phase (Vz) was estimated to be 3.86 (0.77) l. 
Biotransformation / Elimination 
Two elimination phases were observed for erenumab. At low concentrations, the elimination is 
predominately through saturable binding to target (CGRP-R), while at higher concentrations the 
elimination of erenumab is largely through a non-specific proteolytic pathway. Throughout the dosing 
period erenumab is predominantly eliminated via a non-specific proteolytic pathway with the effective 
half-life of 28 days. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2) have not been studied. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of integrated data from the Aimovig clinical studies did not reveal a 
difference in the pharmacokinetics of erenumab in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
relative to those with normal renal function (see section 4.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No studies have been performed in patients with hepatic impairment. Erenumab, as a human 
monoclonal antibody, is not metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes and hepatic clearance is not a 
major clearance pathway for erenumab (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with erenumab. Erenumab is not pharmacologically 
active in rodents. It has biological activity in cynomolgus monkeys, but this species is not an 
appropriate model for evaluation of tumorigenic risk. The mutagenic potential of erenumab has not 
been evaluated; however, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. 
In repeated-dose toxicology studies there were no adverse effects in sexually mature monkeys dosed 
up to 150 mg/kg subcutaneously twice weekly for up to 6 months at systemic exposures up to 123-fold 
and 246-fold higher than the clinical dose of 140 mg and 70 mg, respectively, every 4 weeks, based on 
serum AUC. There were also no adverse effects on surrogate markers of fertility (anatomical 
pathology or histopathology changes in reproductive organs) in these studies. 
In a reproduction study in cynomolgus monkeys there were no effects on pregnancy, embryo-foetal or 
post-natal development (up to 6 months of age) when erenumab was dosed throughout pregnancy at 
exposure levels approximately 17-fold and 34-fold higher than those achieved in patients receiving 
erenumab 140 mg and 70 mg, respectively, every 4 weeks dosing regimen based on AUC. Measurable 
erenumab serum concentrations were observed in the infant monkeys at birth, confirming that 
erenumab, like other IgG antibodies, crosses the placental barrier.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Aimovig is and what it is used for 
Aimovig contains the active substance erenumab. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
monoclonal antibodies. 
Aimovig works by blocking the activity of the CGRP molecule, which has been linked to migraine 
(CGRP stands for calcitonin gene-related peptide). 
Aimovig is used to prevent migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month when 
starting treatment with Aimovig. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Aimovig 
Do not use Aimovig 
- 
if you are allergic to erenumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Aimovig: 
- 
if you have ever had an allergic reaction to rubber latex. The container of this medicinal product 
contains latex rubber within the cap. 
if you suffer from a cardiovascular disease. Aimovig has not been studied in patients with 
certain cardiovascular diseases. 
- 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Talk to your doctor or get emergency medical help immediately: 
- 
if you get any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, such as rash or swelling usually of the 
face, mouth, tongue, or throat; or difficulty breathing. Serious allergic reactions can happen 
within minutes, but some may happen more than one week after using Aimovig. 
Contact a doctor if you get constipation and seek medical help immediately if you develop 
constipation with severe or constant belly (abdominal) pain and vomiting, swelling of abdomen 
or bloating. Constipation can occur when treated with Aimovig. It is usually mild or moderate in 
intensity. However, some patients using Aimovig have had constipation with serious 
complications and have been hospitalised. Some cases have required surgery. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents (under 18 years old) because the use of Aimovig 
has not been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Aimovig 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
Your doctor will decide whether you should stop using Aimovig during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Monoclonal antibodies like Aimovig are known to pass into breast milk during the first few days after 
birth, but after this first period Aimovig can be used. Talk to your doctor about using Aimovig while 
breast-feeding in order to help you decide whether you should stop breast-feeding or stop using 
Aimovig. 
Driving and using machines 
Aimovig is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Aimovig contains sodium 
Aimovig contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use Aimovig 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
If your doctor prescribes the 70 mg dose you should have one injection once every 4 weeks. If your 
doctor prescribes the 140 mg dose you should have either one injection of Aimovig 140 mg or two 
injections of Aimovig 70 mg once every 4 weeks. If you are having two injections of Aimovig 70 mg, 
the second injection must be given immediately after the first one at a different injection site. Make 
sure that you inject the entire contents of both syringes. 
Aimovig is given as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). You or your 
caregiver can give the injection into your abdomen or your thigh. The outer area of your upper arm can 
also be used as an injection site, but only if someone else is giving you the injection. If you need 
2 injections, they should be given in different sites to avoid hardening of the skin and should not be 
given into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. 
Your doctor or nurse will give you or your caregiver training in the right way to prepare and inject 
Aimovig. Do not try to inject Aimovig until this training has been given. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have not noticed any treatment effect after 3 months, tell your doctor who will decide whether 
you should continue treatment. 
Aimovig syringes are for single use only. 
For detailed instructions on how to inject Aimovig, see “Instructions for use of Aimovig pre-filled 
syringe” at the end of this leaflet. 
If you use more Aimovig than you should 
If you have received more Aimovig than you should or if the dose has been given earlier than it should 
have been, tell your doctor. 
If you forget to use Aimovig 
- 
- 
If you forget an Aimovig dose, take it as soon as possible after you realise. 
Then contact your doctor, who will tell you when you should schedule your next dose. Follow 
the new schedule exactly as your doctor has told you. 
If you stop using Aimovig 
Do not stop using Aimovig without talking to your doctor first. Your symptoms may return if you stop 
the treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

General 
Before you use the Aimovig pre-filled syringe, read this important 
information: 
Step 1: Prepare 
Note: The prescribed dose of Aimovig is either 70 mg or 140 mg. This means that for the 70 mg dose 
you must inject the contents of one 70 mg single-use syringe. For the 140 mg dose you must inject the 
contents of either one 140 mg single-use syringe or two 70 mg single-use syringes, one after the other. 
(A) 
Remove Aimovig pre-filled syringe(s) from the carton by holding it/them at the barrel. You may need 
to use either one or two syringes based on your prescribed dose. Do not shake. 
To avoid discomfort at the site of injection, leave the syringe(s) at room temperature for at least 
30 minutes before injecting. 
Note: Do not try to warm the syringe(s) by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave. 
(B) 
Inspect the syringe(s). Make sure the solution you see in the syringe is clear and colourless to light 
yellow. 
Note: 
- 
- 
- 
Do not use the syringe if any part of it appears cracked or broken. 
Do not use the syringe if it has been dropped. 
Do not use the syringe if the needle cap is missing or is not securely attached. 
In all cases described above, use a new syringe, and if you are unsure contact your doctor or 
pharmacist. 
(C) 
Gather all materials needed for the 
injections: 
Wash your hands thoroughly with 
soap and water. 
On a clean, well-lit work surface, 
place the: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
New syringe(s) 
Alcohol wipes 
Cotton balls or gauze pads 
Adhesive plasters 
Sharps disposal container 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(D) 
Prepare and clean the injection site(s). 
Upper 
arm 
Stomach area 
(abdomen) 
Thigh 
Only use the following injection sites: 
- 
- 
- 
Thigh 
Stomach area (abdomen) (except for a 5 cm area around the navel) 
Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection) 
Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe and let the skin dry. 
Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection. If you need to use the same injection 
site, just make sure it is not the same spot on that site you used last time. 
Note: 
- 
- 
After you have cleaned the area, do not touch it again before injecting. 
Do not choose an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into areas 
with scars or stretch marks. 
Step 2: Get ready 
(E) 
Pull the grey needle cap straight off and away from your body, only when you are ready to inject. The 
injection must be administered within 5 minutes. It is normal to see a drop of liquid at the end of the 
needle. 
Note: 
- 
- 
- 
Do not leave the grey needle cap off for more than 5 minutes. This can dry out the medicine. 
Do not twist or bend the grey needle cap. 
Do not put the grey needle cap back onto the syringe once it has been removed. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(F) 
Firmly pinch the skin at the injection site. 
Note: Keep skin pinched while injecting. 
Step 3: Inject 
(G) 
While pinching, insert the syringe needle into the skin at an angle of 45 to 90 degrees. 
Do not place your finger on the plunger while inserting the needle. 
(H) 
Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger rod all the way down until it stops moving. 
(I) 
When done, release your thumb, and gently lift the syringe off of the skin and then release the pinched 
skin. 
Note: When you remove the syringe, if it looks like there is still medicine in the syringe barrel this 
means you have not received a full dose. Contact your doctor. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4: Finish 
(J) 
Discard the used syringe and the grey needle cap. 
Put the used syringe in a sharps disposal container immediately 
after use. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about proper disposal. 
There may be local regulations for disposal. 
Note: 
- 
Do not reuse the syringe. 
- 
Do not recycle the syringe or sharps disposal container. 
Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of 
children. 
(K) 
Examine the injection site. 
If there is any blood on the skin, press a cotton ball or gauze pad onto the injection site. Do not rub the 
injection site. Apply an adhesive plaster if needed.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Aimovig is and what it is used for 
Aimovig contains the active substance erenumab. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
monoclonal antibodies. 
Aimovig works by blocking the activity of the CGRP molecule, which has been linked to migraine 
(CGRP stands for calcitonin gene-related peptide). 
Aimovig is used to prevent migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month when 
starting treatment with Aimovig. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Aimovig 
Do not use Aimovig 
- 
if you are allergic to erenumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Aimovig: 
- 
if you have ever had an allergic reaction to rubber latex. The container of this medicinal product 
contains latex rubber within the cap. 
if you suffer from a cardiovascular disease. Aimovig has not been studied in patients with 
certain cardiovascular diseases. 
- 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Talk to your doctor or get emergency medical help immediately: 
- 
if you get any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, such as rash or swelling usually of the 
face, mouth, tongue, or throat; or difficulty breathing. Serious allergic reactions can happen 
within minutes, but some may happen more than one week after using Aimovig. 
Contact a doctor if you get constipation and seek medical help immediately if you develop 
constipation with severe or constant belly (abdominal) pain and vomiting, swelling of abdomen 
or bloating. Constipation can occur when treated with Aimovig. It is usually mild or moderate in 
intensity. However, some patients using Aimovig have had constipation with serious 
complications and have been hospitalised. Some cases have required surgery. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents (under 18 years old) because the use of Aimovig 
has not been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Aimovig 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
Your doctor will decide whether you should stop using Aimovig during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Monoclonal antibodies like Aimovig are known to pass into breast milk during the first few days after 
birth, but after this first period Aimovig can be used. Talk to your doctor about using Aimovig while 
breast-feeding in order to help you decide whether you should stop breast-feeding or stop using 
Aimovig. 
Driving and using machines 
Aimovig is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Aimovig contains sodium 
Aimovig contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-free”. 
3. 
How to use Aimovig 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
If your doctor prescribes the 70 mg dose you should have one injection once every 4 weeks. If your 
doctor prescribes the 140 mg dose you should have either one injection of Aimovig 140 mg or two 
injections of Aimovig 70 mg once every 4 weeks. If you are having two injections of Aimovig 70 mg, 
the second injection must be given immediately after the first one at a different injection site. Make 
sure that you inject the entire contents of both pens. 
Aimovig is given as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). You or your 
caregiver can give the injection into your abdomen or your thigh. The outer area of your upper arm can 
also be used as an injection site, but only if someone else is giving you the injection. If you need 
2 injections, they should be given in different sites to avoid hardening of the skin and should not be 
given into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. 
Your doctor or nurse will give you or your caregiver training in the right way to prepare and inject 
Aimovig. Do not try to inject Aimovig until this training has been given. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have not noticed any treatment effect after 3 months, tell your doctor who will decide whether 
you should continue treatment. 
Aimovig pens are for single use only. 
For detailed instructions on how to inject Aimovig, see “Instructions for use of Aimovig pre-filled 
pen” at the end of this leaflet. 
If you use more Aimovig than you should 
If you have received more Aimovig than you should or if the dose has been given earlier than it should 
have been, tell your doctor. 
If you forget to use Aimovig 
- 
- 
If you forget an Aimovig dose, take it as soon as possible after you realise. 
Then contact your doctor, who will tell you when you should schedule your next dose. Follow 
the new schedule exactly as your doctor has told you. 
If you stop using Aimovig 
Do not stop using Aimovig without talking to your doctor first. Your symptoms may return if you stop 
the treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

General 
Before you use the Aimovig pre-filled pen, read this 
information. 
Step 1: Prepare 
Note: The prescribed dose of Aimovig is either 70 mg or 140 mg. This means that for the 70 mg dose 
you must inject the contents of one 70 mg single-use pen. For the 140 mg dose you must inject the 
contents of either one 140 mg single-use pen or two 70 mg single-use pens, one after the other. 
(A) 
Carefully lift Aimovig pre-filled pen(s) out of the carton. You may need to use either one or two pens 
based on your prescribed dose. Do not shake. 
To avoid discomfort at the site of injection, leave the pen(s) at room temperature for at least 
30 minutes before injecting. 
Note: Do not try to warm the pen(s) by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave. 
(B) 
Inspect the pen(s). Make sure the solution you see in the window is clear and colourless to light 
yellow. 
Note: 
- 
- 
- 
Do not use the pen(s) if any part appears cracked or broken. 
Do not use any pen that has been dropped. 
Do not use the pen if the cap is missing or is not securely attached. 
In all cases described above, use a new pen, and if you are unsure contact your doctor or pharmacist. 
(C) 
Gather all materials needed for the 
injection(s). 
Wash your hands thoroughly with 
soap and water. 
On a clean, well-lit work surface, 
place the: 
- 
- 
- 
New pen(s) 
Alcohol wipe(s) 
Cotton ball(s) or gauze 
pad(s) 
Adhesive plaster(s) 
Sharps disposal container 
- 
- 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(D) 
Prepare and clean the injection site(s). 
Upper 
arm 
Stomach 
area 
(abdomen) 
Thigh 
Only use the following injection sites: 
- 
- 
- 
Thigh 
Stomach area (abdomen) (except for a 5 cm area around the navel) 
Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection) 
Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe and let the skin dry. 
Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection. If you need to use the same injection 
site, just make sure it is not the same spot on that site you used last time. 
Note: 
- 
- 
After you have cleaned the area, do not touch it again before injecting. 
Do not choose an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into areas 
with scars or stretch marks. 
Step 2: Get ready 
(E) 
Pull the cap straight off, only when you are ready to inject. The injection must be administered within 
5 minutes. It is normal to see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle or safety guard. 
Note: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Do not leave the cap off for more than 5 minutes. This can dry out the medicine. 
Do not twist or bend the cap. 
Do not put the cap back onto the pen once it has been removed. 
Do not put your fingers into the safety guard. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(F) 
Create a firm surface at the selected injection site (thigh, stomach, or outer areas of the upper arm), by 
using either the Stretch method or the Pinch method. 
Stretch method 
Stretch skin firmly by moving your thumb and fingers in opposite directions, creating an area about 
five cm wide. 
Pinch method 
Pinch skin firmly between your thumb and fingers, creating an area about five cm wide. 
Note: It is important to keep skin stretched or pinched while injecting. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3: Inject 
(G) 
Keep holding the stretched/pinched skin. With the cap off, put the safety guard of the pen on the skin 
at an angle of 90 degrees. The needle is inside the safety guard. 
Safety guard 
(needle inside) 
Note: Do not touch the start button yet. 
65 
 
 
 
 
(H) 
Firmly push the pen down onto the skin until it stops moving. 
Push down 
Note: You must push all the way down but do not touch the start button until you are ready to inject. 
(I) 
Press the start button. You will hear a click. 
click 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(J)  
Remove your thumb from the button, but keep pushing down on the skin. The injection could take 
about 15 seconds. 
click 
15 seconds 
Note: When the injection is completed, the window will turn from clear to yellow and you may hear a 
second click. 
Note: 
- 
- 
After you remove the pen from the skin, the needle will automatically be covered by the safety 
guard. 
When you remove the pen, if the window has not turned yellow, or if it looks like the medicine 
is still injecting, this means you have not received a full dose. Contact your doctor immediately. 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4: Finish 
(K) 
Discard the used pen and the cap. 
Put the used pen in a sharps disposal container immediately after use. Talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist about proper disposal. There may be local regulations for disposal. 
Note: 
- 
- 
- 
Do not reuse the pen. 
Do not recycle the pen or sharps disposal container. 
Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of children. 
(L) 
Examine the injection site. 
If there is any blood on the skin, press a cotton ball or gauze pad onto the injection site. Do not rub 
the injection site. Apply an adhesive plaster if needed. 
If your dose is 140 mg and you are using two Aimovig 70 mg pens, repeat 
steps 1(D) to 4 with the second pen to inject the full dose.

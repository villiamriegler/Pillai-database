Opinion 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare pleiotropic autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in 
more than 20 different genes, all of which participate in cilia functioning and is  therefore considered a 
primary ciliopathy. Extensive research suggests the obesity phenotype in BBS is caused by impaired 
transport of the leptin receptor (LEPR) to the ciliary membrane of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) 
neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Under normal conditions, leptin, a hormone 
predominantly made by adipose cells, stimulates firing and gene expression in POMC neurons, 
promoting the secretion of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Alpha-MSH stimulates the 
MC4R located in the second order neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus 
and results in decreased hunger and weight and increased energy expenditure. Impaired or absent 
LEPR signaling in POMC neurons would be expected to reduce MC4R stimulation in second order 
neurons, resulting in an increase in appetite, reduced metabolic rate, and increased weight.  
Alström syndrome (AS), like BBS, is a ciliopathy characterized by a syndromic phenotype that includes 
progressive cone-rod dystrophy leading to blindness, sensorineural hearing loss, congestive heart 
failure, and marked childhood obesity associated with hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It 
is caused by bi-allelic recessive mutations in a single gene, ALMS1. AS is considerably rarer than BBS. 
While the dominant phenotype in BBS is typically developmental defects, in AS it is metabolic function. 
Beginning in infancy, patients with AS have progressive multiorgan pathology that typically leads to 
truncal obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, and hyperlipidaemia by 5 years 
of age and progresses to T2DM; excessive weight gain typically begins within the first year of life. The 
incidence of T2DM is one of the distinguishing features between AS and BBS. In patients with AS the 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 9/99 
 
 
 
 
 
incidence of T2DM is ~50% to 75% compared with <25% in patients with BBS. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
Treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed  BBS and AS in 
adults and children 6 years of age and above. On 22 April 2022, on the basis that additional data were 
required, and these were considered still provisional, the MAH withdrew the variation application of the 
grouping related to AS in adults and children 6 years of age and above. 
Epidemiology 
BBS is a rare pleiotropic autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a syndromic phenotype with an 
overall prevalence of 1 in 125,000–160,000 in people of European descent, while AS is considerably 
rarer than BBS, with ~950 cases estimated worldwide. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
BBS is characterized by marked obesity and hyperphagia as well as several other disease features (rod 
cone dystrophy, postaxial polydactyly, cognitive impairment, hearing loss, speech deficit, hepatic 
fibrosis, genitourinary malformations, renal abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and 
congenital heart disease that do not likely arise from hypothalamic impairment. 
AS is characterized by a syndromic phenotype that includes progressive cone-rod dystrophy leading to 
blindness, sensorineural hearing loss, congestive heart failure, and marked childhood obesity 
associated with hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is caused by bi-allelic recessive 
mutations in a single gene, ALMS1. AS is considerably rarer than BBS. While the dominant phenotype 
in BBS is typically developmental defects, in AS it is metabolic function. Beginning in infancy, patients 
with AS have progressive multiorgan pathology that typically leads to truncal obesity, insulin 
resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, and hyperlipidaemia by 5 years of age and progresses 
to type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM); excessive weight gain typically begins within the first year of life. 
Management 
There are no approved therapies or products in development specifically for treatment of obesity and 
reduction of hyperphagia in patients with BBS or AS, and there is no evidence that alternative potential 
(unapproved) therapies might be useful. The only pharmacologic treatments available are products for 
general obesity/weight management; however, there is limited experience with these therapies in 
patients with MCR pathway associated obesity such as BBS and AS. In general, these therapies have 
not been successful in early-onset extreme genetic obesity as these therapies fail to address the MC4R 
pathway signalling defect that leads to obesity and hyperphagia in these patients.  
The absence of drug therapy and unsuitability of surgical intervention leaves only lifestyle modification 
(i.e., diet and exercise) as available therapeutic interventions for patients with severe obesity. These, 
however, are rarely successful over the short-term and almost never effective in the long-term due to 
the intense drive to eat caused by the absence of satiety signals.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Setmelanotide is a synthetic octapeptide melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) agonist with 2-3-fold less 
activity at the melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) and melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). MC4Rs in the 
brain are involved in regulation of hunger, satiety, and energy expenditure. In genetic forms of obesity 
associated with insufficient activation of the MC4R, setmelanotide is believed to re-establish MC4R 
pathway activity to reduce hunger and promote weight loss through decreased caloric intake and 
increased energy expenditure. Nonclinical evidence shows that MC4Rs are important for setmelanotide-
regulated appetite and weight loss. The MC1R is expressed on melanocytes, and activation of this 
receptor leads to accumulation of melanin and increased skin pigmentation independently of ultraviolet 
light. 
IMCIVREE is currently indicated for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with 
genetically confirmed loss-of-function biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including Proprotein 
Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 1 (PCSK1), deficiency or biallelic leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency in 
adults and children 6 years of age and above. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The Applicant requested and received a Protocol Assistance (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/585846/2020) in 
November 2020 touching upon aspects of trial design, endpoint choice, population choice and 
evaluation methods. The Applicant decided not to follow the advice on several (key) issues in the final 
submission. See section 2.4. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
All trials were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice, according to 
the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline and trails carried out outside the European Union meet the 
ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data on pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology have been submitted in 
this application, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The combined Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water (PECsw) for setmelanotide from 
the use of IMCIVREE 10 mg/ mL solution for injection for all indications, including the two new 
indications, has been calculated to be 0.0000615 µg/L. This is 162.6 times lower than the Phase I 
action limit of 0.01 µg/L. The non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for the environment. In 
conclusion, IMCIVREE 10 mg/ mL solution for injection represents a negligible risk to the environment 
from use in treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed 
Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) loss-of function biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including PCSK1, 
deficiency or biallelic leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and above.

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The absence of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology studies are considered acceptable, based 
on the available clinical data. However, the link between the MC4R receptor and the upstream genetic 
deficiency of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Alström syndrome (AS) was requested to be further 
justified during the procedure. Relevant information has been provided by the applicant and is 
summarised in sections 2.3.3 and 2.4. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of setmelanotide. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of setmelanotide have been 
studied in human volunteers and patients in a total of 15 clinical studies, of which the new Phase 3 
Study RM-493-023 supporting the present application. Two other studies (Study RM-493-029, RM-493-
026) were also submitted in this application and the CHMP assessment on these data had already 
concluded in the scope of the authorised indications (EMEA/H/C/005089/II/03) and thus not presented 
in this report.   
Study RM-493-023 
One of the exploratory objectives of study RM-493-023 was to determine the pharmacokinetics of 
setmelanotide in patients with BBS or AS. Trough concentration data were obtained after either 
multiple doses of 2.0 mg QD or 3.0 mg QD setmelanotide. Trough setmelanotide concentrations were 
available from patients in the pivotal and supplemental cohorts and included:10 children (<12 years; N 
= 1 to 10 per visit),16 adolescents (12 to 18 years; N = 4 to 14 per visit), and 23 adults (>18 years; 
N = 4 to 21 per visit). 
For adults, mean trough setmelanotide concentrations after 2.0 mg setmelanotide were 3.35 ± 1.44 
ng/mL (N = 8), 2.90 ng/mL (N = 2, individual values: 0.00 and 5.79 ng/mL), and 3.86 ± 2.31 ng/mL 
(N = 21) for Visits 3, 6, and 7 (Weeks 3, 15, and 17), respectively. Mean trough setmelanotide 
concentrations after 3.0 mg setmelanotide ranged from 2.95 ng/mL (N = 2, individual values 0.00 and 
5.89 ng/mL; Visit 3 [Week 3]) to 10.5 ± 12.3 ng/mL (N = 4, Visit 10 [Week 35]). 
For adolescents, mean trough setmelanotide concentrations after a dose of 2.0 mg setmelanotide were 
5.56 ± 4.51 ng/mL (N = 8) and 5.11 ± 3.92 ng/mL (N = 12) for Visits 3 and 7 (Weeks 3 and 17), 
respectively. Mean trough setmelanotide concentrations after a 3.0 mg setmelanotide ranged from 
2.22 ng/mL (N = 1, Visit 7 [Week 17]) to 17.5 ± 18.6 ng/mL (N = 12, Visit 13 [Week 53]). 
For children, mean trough setmelanotide concentrations after 2.0 mg setmelanotide were 3.12 ± 2.83 
ng/mL (N = 4), 4.06 (N = 1), 7.94 ± 7.22 ng/mL (N = 8), and 5.22 ng/mL (N = 1) for Visits 3, 6, 7, 
and 15 (Weeks 3, 15, 17, and 66), respectively. Mean trough setmelanotide concentrations after 3.0 
mg setmelanotide ranged from 4.35 ± 2.46 ng/mL (N = 3, Visit 13 [Week 53]) to 33.0 ng/mL (N = 1, 
Visit 7 [Week 17]). 
High (>30.0 ng/mL) trough setmelanotide concentrations, up to 68.4 ng/mL, were observed in this 
study in children (5 patients) and adolescents (3 patients). With the exception of one adolescent 
patient, all of the patients with trough concentrations >30 ng/mL had baseline body weights <100 kg. 
None of these patients had renal impairment, none had any temporally associated AE that could reflect 
systemic intolerance to setmelanotide, and none were prematurely discontinued. 
PK profiles 
Eight-hour PK profiles were available for 6 patients from the pivotal cohort on Visit 6 (Week 15) and 
Visit 7 (Week 17), and for 4 patients on Visit 9 (Week 29). See Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 noting  that 
the y-axis scale on the linear plots differs across these figures. The patients who participated in the 8-
hour PK sampling were: 1 child with BBS (<12 years), 3 adolescents with BBS (12 to 18 years), and 2 
adults with BBS (>18 years). 
Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero 
to time of last measurable concentration (AUClast) were highest for the child (N = 1) at all 3 visits

compared with the adolescents and adults. The high exposure for the child could be due to the high 
dose per kg (resulting from lower body weight, <100 kg, and the fixed dose levels of 2.0 to 3.0 mg). 
In general, maximum Cmax was observed at or near the end of the 8-hour PK sampling interval; the 
median time to Cmax (Tmax) ranged from 5.00 to 7.90 hours across age groups, dose levels, and 
visits. 
The exposure for one adult patient was much lower than expected; the reason is unknown. For this 
patient, consistently lower exposure, relative to other patients, was observed in the trough 
concentrations throughout the study, and in 0- to 8-hour PK samples from Visits 6 and 8 (Weeks 15 to 
23). Despite low concentrations and PK exposure, this patient had clinically significant weight loss that 
began after switching to active treatment (setmelanotide 3.0 mg QD) following the end of the placebo 
period. See

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Primary cilia are evolutionarily conserved organelles whose dysfunction led to human disorders now 
defined as ciliopathies.  
Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a rare and uncurable pleiotropic autosomal recessive ciliopathy 
characterized by a syndromic phenotype with an overall prevalence of 1 in 125,000–160,000 in people 
of European descent. The clinical presentation of BBS includes marked obesity and hyperphagia in 
addition to several other disease features that likely do not rise from hypothalamic impairment. The 
latter features include rod-cone dystrophy, postaxial polydactyly, cognitive impairment, hearing loss, 
speech deficit, hepatic fibrosis, genitourinary malformations, renal abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, and congenital heart disease.  
While birth weight in affected patients is usually normal, significant weight gain due to increased food 
intake and decreased energy expenditure begins in the first year and is a lifelong issue for most (72-
92%). Relative to healthy subjects with comparable body mass index (BMI), patients with BBS tend to 
have higher adiposity, significantly more abdominal visceral fat, and less lean mass.  
BBS is caused by mutations in more than 20 different genes, all of which participate in cilia 
functioning, and is therefore considered a primary ciliopathy. Eight of the most conserved BBS proteins 
(BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, BBS9 and BBS18) form a core complex, known as the 
BBSome, that associates with the ciliary membrane and functions as a unit to sort and direct 
trafficking of receptors and other proteins to the ciliary membrane. The BBS3 protein appears critical 
for recruitment of the BBSome complex onto the ciliary membrane, while BBS6, BBS10 and BBS12 
form a complex that facilitates assembly of the BBSome. While the function of the remaining BBS 
proteins is less well characterized, the existence of these functional connections among the BBS 
proteins helps explain the phenotypic similarities among patients carrying mutations in such varied 
BBS genes. 
Extensive research suggests the obesity phenotype in BBS is caused by impaired transport of the leptin 
receptor to the ciliary membrane of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of 
the hypothalamus. Under normal conditions, leptin, a hormone predominantly made by adipose cells, 
stimulates firing and gene expression in POMC neurons, promoting the secretion of alpha-melanocyte 
stimulating hormone (α-MSH). This stimulates the MC4R located in the second order neurons in the 
paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus to decrease hunger and weight and increase 
energy expenditure (Figure 4). Impaired or absent leptin receptor signalling in POMC neurons would be 
expected to reduce MC4R stimulation in second order neurons, resulting in an increase in appetite, 
reduced metabolic rate, and increased weight.

Figure 4 Leptin – Melanocortin Pathway 
Alström Syndrome (AS), like BBS, is a ciliopathy characterized by a syndromic phenotype that includes 
progressive cone-rod dystrophy leading to blindness, sensorineural hearing loss, congestive heart 
failure, and marked childhood obesity associated with hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
However, it is caused by bi-allelic recessive mutations in a single gene, ALMS1. While the exact 
function of ALMS1 has not yet been elucidated, it is known to play a pivotal role in the function, 
formation, and maintenance of primary cilia and to be involved in energy balance and satiety 
regulation. AS is a considerably rarer condition than BBS, with ~ 950 cases estimated worldwide.  
While AS shares many of the same clinical features as BBS, the disorders can usually be distinguished 
clinically and confirmed through genetics. While the dominant phenotype in BBS is typically 
developmental defects, in AS it is metabolic function. Beginning in infancy, patients with AS have 
progressive multiorgan pathology that typically leads to truncal obesity, insulin resistance, 
hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, and hyperlipidaemia by 5 years of age and progresses to type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The incidence of T2DM is one of distinguishing features between AS and 
BBS. In patients with AS the incidence of T2DM is ~50-75% compared with <25% in patients with BBS  
Obesity is observed almost universally in patients with AS; excessive weight gain typically begins 
within the first year of life. Hyperphagia and obsession with food are also common in patients with AS. 
As with BBS, there is no cure for AS.  
Setmelanotide is a MC4R agonist that retains the specificity and functionality of naturally occurring α-
MSH, which is the natural ligand for the MC4R. Setmelanotide has the potential to restore lost activity 
in the MC4R pathway by bypassing the defects upstream of the MC4R and directly activating MC4R 
neurons in the hypothalamus below such defects ( 
Figure 5). Thus, setmelanotide may serve as a “replacement” therapy to re-establish weight and 
appetite control in patients with disorders, such as BBS and AS, that are mediated by higher order 
defects.

Study RM-493-023 
Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) assays 
Immunogenicity samples were collected in the study RM-493-023 at the screening visit (V1), prior to 
the administration of study drug at V2 (week 1), V6 (week 15), V9 (week 29), V13 (week 53), V15 
(week 66) and at the early termination visit. Sample collection for a potential antibody response to 
alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) prior to and following setmelanotide treatment occurred 
at the same timepoints as the testing for antibodies to RM-493 
A tiered approach was utilized for sample analysis. All samples that fall above the corresponding Assay 
Cut Point during screening or if the signal is 2 times that of the corresponding pre-dose sample for that 
subject, was considered potentially positive for the presence of anti-RM-493 antibodies. The potentially 
positive samples were then analyzed in a confirmatory assay. All samples confirmed to be positive for 
the presence of anti-RM-493 antibodies were titrated and a titer value was obtained. 
A total of 169 samples from 48 patients were tested for ADAs. A negative result from the screening 
assay was reported for 70 samples. The remaining 94 samples were tested in the confirmatory assay. 
Of these, 1 sample from one patient (Visit 15) was confirmed positive for ADA with a very low titer. 
This patient achieved clinically meaningful reductions in body weight and BMI Z-scores during 
treatment with setmelanotide and did not experience any SAEs or any moderate or severe treatment 
related TEAEs. Samples from an additional 5 patients were flagged for re-analysis with the results to 
be reported in amendment to the Bioanalytical Report. 
Based on the results at this time, there was 1 patient with confirmed anti-RM-493 antibodies with a 
low titer; there was no impact of ADA on safety or efficacy in this patient as reported by the MAH. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
High (>30.0 ng/mL) trough setmelanotide concentrations were clearly observed in this study in children 
and adolescents. According to the applicant, patients with concentration values that  are outliers have 
been  observed  throughout  the  program  with  no  apparent  negative  clinical  consequences.  No  robust 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022

comparison of the PK parameters and profiles between BBS/AS population and POMC or LEPR deficient 
patients could be made based on the limited data available in children and the high variability observed 
in the studies. However, the CHMP agreed that in adults and adolescents the mean setmelanotide trough 
concentrations across studies based on dose were similar, with overlapping standard deviations.  
Although the Population Pharmacokinetic (POPK) model has not been updated (due to insufficient data 
to allow reassessment of the model), it was also acknowledged that from the trough concentration values 
presented for studies RM-493-012 and RM-493-015,  the concentration  values  for  setmelanotide  were 
overall consistent with repeat dosing across studies and disease population. 
Given that there is no relationship between PK trough, dose and weight, the CHMP recommended the 
following  update  in  section  5.2  of  the  SmPC  based  on  the  results  of  study  RM-493-023:  The  PK  of 
setmelanotide in patients with BBS was similar to that obtained in the population of patients with POMC, 
PCSK1, and LEPR deficiency, suggesting the disease state alone does not impact the PK of setmelanotide. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Two other studies (Study RM-493-029, RM-493-026) were submitted in this application and the CHMP 
assessment on these data had already concluded in the scope of the authorised indications 
(EMEA/H/C/005089/II/03). The posology recommendations resulting from these data are the same for 
the authorised indications and the BBS indication subject to the present assessment. 
Only  a  very  general  high-level  overview  of  the  pathophysiology  BBS  and  AS,  including  the  effect  on 
energy balance and satiety homeostasis have been presented in this application. On this basis, although 
the CHMP agreed that BBS and AS are both ciliopathies and that they are generally considered to excerpt 
a measure of influence on the energy homeostasis, more discussion on how the ALMS1 gene excerpts 
influence on this process should be provided. To better understand the purported method of action of 
the  α-MSH  analogue  setmelanotide  within  context  of  these  syndromes,  discussion  on  how  exactly 
disruption of the BBS- and AS-related genes leads to direct or indirect disruption of the MC4 pathway 
needed to be provided. 
As reported by the MAH, there is a paucity in the current knowledge on how exactly the ciliopathic 
nature of BBS leads to a disruption of the MCH4 pathway, however animal studies have shown that 
BBS gene defects lead to heightened leptin concentrations while at the same time exhibiting 
hyperphagia, and also fail to respond to leptin-injections. This evidence leads to the expectation that 
BBS gene defects likely disrupt the normal function of the leptin receptor, culminating in a lowered 
production of α-MSH.Whether or not there may be a pathophysiological difference between AS and 
BBS syndromes in regard to the effect on the MC4R pathway is no longer considered relevant given the 
fact that the Applicant withdrew the variation application of the grouping related to AS. 
One patient was confirmed positive to anti-setmelanotide antibodies. Sample analysis is still ongoing, 
as there was a change in the laboratory performing the assessment. An updated Integrated Summary 
of Immunogenicity (ISI) including this information is expected by the end of Q1 2022. To date, 2.3% 
of samples tested (32 of 1379 samples across multiple studies) confirmed positive for antibodies to 
alpha-MSH and have a reportable result in the titration assay. Confirmatory and titer results for the 
RM-493-023 study are pending analysis.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacological profile of setmelanotide in human studies has been adequately 
documented and meets the requirements to support this application. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress,

the CHMP reminded the applicant of the following points for investigation from the initial marketing 
authorisation evaluation: 
- To provide data from sample analysis in pending clinical and validation (e.g. long-term stability) 
studies as per EMA guidelines; 
- To improve the reliability of the setmelanotide confirmatory ADA assay for the detection of the ADA 
in the patient samples in presence of clinically relevant drug levels; 
- To provide updated integrated analysis of the clinical significance of immunogenicity of setmelanotide 
as data become available. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response studies were undertaken by the Applicant and all dosing decisions in the pivotal trial 
RM-493-023  were  based  upon  observations  made  in  the  investigator  led  study  RM-0493-011  and 
supportive study RM-493-014. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
The main study, RM-493-023 is a Phase 3, 3-period study designed to confirm the long-term efficacy 
and safety of setmelanotide in male and female patients ≥6 years of age with BBS or AS with moderate 
to severe obesity.  
Methods 
Study RM-493-023 consisted of three distinct treatment periods, including an initial 14-week double-
blind placebo-controlled period, followed by two open-label treatment periods taking 38 weeks and 14 
weeks respectively. 
BBS and AS patients that satisfied the in- and exclusion criteria first entered a 14-week, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period (Period 1) that was followed by a 38-week open-
label treatment period (Period 2) in which all patients received setmelanotide. Primary analysis was to 
be performed after Period 2. To maintain the blind through Period 2, dose escalation to the fixed 
maximal dose of 3.0 mg was performed during the first 2 weeks in both the double-blind (Period 1) 
and 38-week open-label (Period 2) treatment periods. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by age group (≥12 years or <12 years) and disease 
(BBS or AS), to receive either setmelanotide QD or placebo QD via SC injection for the first 14 weeks. 
Patients ≥16 years of age were started on setmelanotide 2.0 mg or matching placebo during the 2-
week dose escalation and increased to 3.0 mg or matching placebo at the beginning of Week 3. 
Patients <16 years of age started on setmelanotide 1.0 mg or matching placebo during Week 1, 
increased to 2.0 mg or matching placebo at the beginning of Week 2, and increased to 3.0 mg or 
matching placebo at the beginning of Week 3. During the 14-week double-blind treatment period, 
patients were evaluated at the beginning of Weeks 2 (telephone call only, patients <16 years old), 3, 
7, 11, and 15. 
After the initial 14-week double-blind treatment period (Period 1), all patients immediately transitioned 
to open-label setmelanotide QD via SC injection for 38 weeks (Period 2). To preserve the blind, all 
Assessment report

patients were re-escalated to the 3.0-mg clinical dose. Thus, beginning at Week 15, patients ≥16 
years of age received open-label setmelanotide 2.0 mg for 2 weeks, followed by a dose increase to 3.0 
mg beginning at Week 17, and patients <16 years of age received open-label setmelanotide 1.0 mg 
during Week 15, 2.0 mg during Week 16, and 3.0 mg beginning at Week 17. Patients were evaluated 
at the beginning of Week 16 (telephone call only, patients <16 years old) and Week 17 and then every 
6 weeks thereafter during this Period 2. In Period 3, patients were evaluated every 7 weeks. 
The overall design is presented in Figure 6.

Treatments 
A dose 2-week escalation period was employed at the start of the 14-week DB period and the start of 
the open-label phase, according to the schedule shown in Table 3. 
Table 3: Dose Escalation Schedule
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 26/99 
 
 
 
 
 
Doses ranging from 0.12 to 9.12 mg total daily dose have been used in previous setmelanotide clinical 
studies, with meaningful and progressive weight loss seen with QD doses of 1.0 mg and above. In 
addition, there was no evidence of increased sensitivity or any new safety issues arising in patients 
treated at these latter dose levels. These data as collected from other studies served as guidance for 
the above simplified dosing regimen. 
Although higher starting doses were justified for this study, dose escalation was maintained to improve 
tolerability; nausea and vomiting have been reported with administration of MC4R agents, including 
setmelanotide, occurring most commonly during the start of treatment and generally resolving with 
continued treatment. Based on historical data indicating that most patients at least 16 years of age 
had minimal, if any, additional growth in height, a starting dose of 2.0 mg was selected for both 
adolescents and adults (patients ≥16 years of age at enrolment) with a planned dose escalation to a 
clinical dose of 3.0 mg after 2 weeks. As a measure of added caution for the younger patient 
population, where the smallest patient weight would be at least 29 kg (based on the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] >97th percentile weight for age and sex on growth chart for a 
6-year-old), a starting dose of 1.0 mg was selected for patients <16 years of age at enrolment. 
Upward dose escalation in these patients was done in 2 steps: at the end of Week 1, the dose was 
increased to 2.0 mg and at the end of Week 2, the dose was increased to 3.0 mg. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
• 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of setmelanotide on the proportion of 
patients  ≥12  years  of  age  at  baseline  treated  with  setmelanotide  for  ~52  weeks  who  achieve  a 
clinically meaningful reduction from baseline (i.e., ≥10%) in body weight. 
Key Secondary Objectives 
•  Assess the effect of setmelanotide on mean percent change from baseline in body weight (in patients 
≥12 years of age at baseline) after ~52 weeks of treatment. 
•  Assess the effect of setmelanotide on the mean percent change from baseline in the weekly average

Sample size 
The sample size estimation was mainly driven by the primary hypothesis, although the rarity of the 
population was also taken into consideration.  
The primary statistical hypothesis was that the proportion of patients (≥12 years of age) treated for 
~52 weeks who achieve ≥10% reduction from baseline in body weight would be greater than a 
historical control rate of 10% in the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The null hypothesis (H0) tested was that 
the proportion of patients treated for ~52 weeks who achieve ≥10% reduction in body weight from 
baseline would be less than or equal to a historical control rate of 10%.  
Note that there are 2 different uses of “10%” in the primary hypothesis:  
•  The use of “10%” in the endpoint definition is the response criterion for an individual patient. If 
a patient achieves a ≥10% reduction from baseline in body weight, the patient will be categorized 
as a responder in this analysis. Otherwise, the patient will be categorized as a non-responder.  
•  The  use  of  “10%”  as  the  historical  control  rate  is  the  historical  reference/control  rate  to  be 
statistically compared to the observed response rate in patients treated with setmelanotide (i.e., 
the percentage of patients with BBS who lose at least 10% of body weight with no intervention). 
The observed response rate of setmelanotide will be calculated with the number of responders 
(using the above 10% endpoint definition) divided by the number of total patients.  
For the primary hypothesis a sample size of 7 patients would provide ~91% power at 1-sided alpha of 
0.025 to yield a statistically significant difference, assuming a 66% anticipated response rate in 
patients who are treated with setmelanotide (based on a preliminary review of data from the then 
ongoing Phase 2 study, RM-493-014) compared to a 10% historical control rate (based on data from 
the CRIBBS registry). 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 29/99 
 
 
 
 
Although these data suggest that powering the study for the primary endpoint would require a minimal 
number of patients (N <10), the size of the trial was also a function of the rarity of BBS and AS and a 
desire to better understand the effect of setmelanotide in these patient populations. Hence, 
approximately 30 patients (including 6 AS patients) were planned for enrolment in the study. This 
number was deemed suitable for a single pivotal trial to support the indications in BBS and AS and to 
provide robust information for both the between-group analysis of the placebo-controlled, double-
blinded period (Period 1) and the one-sample comparison to the historical control response rate after 
the last patient has completed the planned 38-week open- label treatment period.  
Randomisation 
Patients who qualified for the study were assigned a unique randomization number based on a 
randomization code generated prior to the start of the study. The randomization number codes the 
patient’s initial treatment assignment (for the double-blind period) to either setmelanotide or placebo. 
The randomization scheme randomized patients in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by age group (12 years or 
<12 years) and disease (BBS or AS), to receive either setmelanotide or placebo during the first 14 
weeks of the study. Randomization numbers were not to be re-used once assigned.  
Blinding (masking) 
This study was open label, with the exception of the 14-week double-blind placebo-controlled period. 
Placebo and setmelanotide were identical in appearance and were supplied in identical packaging. Each 
package and vial contained a code that identified the contents as either placebo or setmelanotide. At 
each site visit during the double-blind period, the study pharmacist selected the correct study drug 
based on the package code and provided the blinded study medication to the patient or the patient’s 
caregiver.  
The Investigator, study site staff, clinical research organization staff providing site management, and 
the Medical Monitor did not have access to the actual treatment assignment administered during the 
14-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period (Period 1). The blind was maintained 
through the end of the 38-week, open-label treatment period (Period 2) (i.e., until the database 
snapshot prior to completing the primary statistical analysis). To maintain the blind through Period 2, 
upward dose escalation to a fixed dose of 3.0 mg was performed during the first 2 weeks of both the 
double-blind (Period 1) and 38-week open-label (Period 2) treatment periods.  
Breaking of the blind for an individual patient was only done in the event of a medical emergency 
where the identity of study drug was necessary to appropriately treat the patient. The reason for 
breaking the blind, as well as when and how the blind was broken were documented.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The following populations were defined: 
-  Screening Analysis Set: All patients who signed the informed consent form. 
-  Safety Analysis (SA) Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of placebo or setmelanotide. 
The SA Set is the primary population for the analysis of safety endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 30/99 
 
 
 
 
-  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS):  All  patients  (irrespective  of  age)  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
setmelanotide and had baseline data. The FAS population is the primary population for the analysis 
of efficacy endpoints. 
-  Designated Use Set (DUS): All patients in the FAS who demonstrated weight loss of at least 5 kg 
(or at least 5% if baseline body weight was <100 kg) over the first 14 weeks of active setmelanotide 
treatment, regardless of later disposition. The DUS population was used for sensitivity analyses of 
efficacy endpoints, as appropriate. 
Based on the definition the DUS subgroup hence included: 
o  Those  patients  initially  randomized  into  the  setmelanotide  group  in  the  double-blinded, 
randomized, placebo-controlled period who achieved weight loss of at least 5 kg (or at least 
5% if baseline body weight was <100 kg) from baseline at the Week 15 visit. 
o  Those  patients  who  were initially  randomized  in  the  placebo  group  in  the  double-blinded, 
randomized, placebo-controlled period, and achieved weight loss of at least 5 kg (or at least 
5% if baseline body weight was <100 kg) from Week 15 (i.e., just prior to their first active 
dose of setmelanotide at Week 15) through Week 29 (i.e., after 14 weeks of active treatment 
with setmelanotide). 
-  Placebo-controlled analysis Set (PCS): All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of 
placebo or setmelanotide and had baseline data. This population was specifically defined for the 14-
week placebo-controlled, double-blind period (Period 1). Analysis performed on PCS were based on 
patients as randomized. 
-  Per-Protocol Set at End of Period 1 (PP at EOP1): All patients in PCS without any major protocol 
violations that would result in exclusion of the patients from the analysis. 
-  Per-Protocol Set at End of Period 2 (PP at EOP2): All patients in FAS without any major protocol 
violations that would result in exclusion of the patients from the analysis. 
-  Completers Set (CS): All patients in the PP at EOP1 population who continued on active treatment 
or placebo and completed a full 14-week placebo-controlled double-blinded period (Period 1). 
-  Stable Height Analysis Set (SH), exploratory analysis only: All patients in the FAS who grew ≤2 
cm  in  height  from  baseline  to  the  primary  endpoint  timepoint  (i.e.,  ~Week  53  visit  for  patients 
randomized to setmelanotide or ~Week 66 visit for patients randomized to placebo) or to the last 
available timepoint if it occurred prior to the primary endpoint. 
-  Active Growth Analysis Set (AG), exploratory analysis only: All patients in the FAS who grew >2 
cm  in  height  from  baseline  to  the  primary  endpoint  timepoint  (i.e.,  ~Week  53  visit  for  patients 
randomized to setmelanotide or ~Week 66 visit for patients randomized to placebo) or to the last 
available timepoint if it occurred prior to the primary endpoint. 
A cohort of supplemental patients was added into the protocol in the midcourse of the study. The 
pivotal cohort includes all the enrolled BBS/AS patients at the time of the planned sixth AS patient 
enrolment, and hence compromised a total of 38 patients (the first 32 BBS patients and 6 AS 
patients). All analyses for the RM-493-023 were performed and the conclusions based on the data from 
the pivotal cohort of patients only unless explicitly stated otherwise. The purpose of the supplemental 
cohort was to gain more treatment experience. 
Analyses Timing and Definition of baseline data 
The primary analysis will occur approximately at the time that the last enrolled patient in the Pivotal 
cohort has completed Period 2. If the last patient is randomized into the setmelanotide arm, this 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 31/99 
 
 
 
 
means the patient will have ~52 weeks (~12 months) of setmelanotide treatment by the time of the 
data cut for NDA submission at the end of Period 2. However, if the last patient is randomized into the 
placebo arm, this means the patient will have ~9 months of setmelanotide treatment by the time of 
the data cut for the NDA submission and that the patient’s ~12 month data will be missing (not yet 
occurred).  
Consequently, by nature of the study design, a small percentage of patients who are randomized into 
the placebo arm may have less than ~52 weeks of setmelanotide treatment by the timing of the 
primary analysis (end of Period 2); hence, a Multiple Imputation approach will be used to impute their 
measurements after ~52 weeks of setmelanotide treatment for the primary analysis. 
Two efficacy baseline definitions were used.  
•  Placebo-controlled period baseline (PCPB): is defined as the last available measurement prior to 
the first dose of setmelanotide or placebo. PCPB will be used for efficacy analysis based upon 14 
weeks of treatment with either setmelanotide or placebo.  
•  Active treatment baseline (ATB): is defined as the last available measurement prior to the first 
dose of active setmelanotide. ATB will be used for efficacy analyses based upon ~52 weeks of 
treatment.  
Analyses – Primary 
Weight was measured in triplicate and mean weight calculated at the study visit was utilized for 
analysis purposes.  
Binomial proportions were calculated for each of the 100 imputed datasets. The outcomes from the 
100 imputed datasets were combined using Rubin’s Rule to provide an overall estimate against the H0 
with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) and p-value. The 1-sided 0.025 significance level was 
chosen based on the small sample size due to the rarity of the disease. The success criterion for the 
primary hypothesis requires the rejection of the H0 at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level. The 
statistical criterion corresponds to the 2-sided 95% CI for setmelanotide of the response rate excluding 
10% (i.e., lower bound of the CI >0.10).  
This analysis was repeated on the DUS, PP at EOP2, SH and AG populations.  
Descriptive statistics for the change and percent change from baseline in body weight (kg) were 
presented for the FAS population by active treatment visit.  
Analyses – Key Secondary 
Statistical testing used the hierarchical order as shown under the Objectives and Endpoints sections. 
The secondary endpoint was compared against the H0 for each of the 100 imputed datasets. The 
outcomes from the 100 imputed datasets were combined using Rubin’s Rule to provide a p-value and 
corresponding CI as appropriate. Evaluations were done at a 1-sided, 0.025 significance level.  
•  Mean percent change from baseline in body weight after ~52 weeks of treatment for patients in the 
FAS  population  was  analyzed.  Analyses  were  based  on  a  one-sample  t-test  for  each  of  the  100 
imputed datasets and assuming a mean percent change from baseline in body weight of zero.  
Sensitivity analysis based on the DUS population was also performed.  
Descriptive statistics for the change and percent change from baseline in body weight (kg) were 
presented for the FAS population by active treatment visit.  
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 32/99 
 
 
 
 
•  Mean percent change from baseline in the weekly average of the daily hunger scores after ~52 weeks 
of treatment for patients in FAS population was analyzed. Note that Daily hunger scores were not 
collected in patients who were cognitively impaired.  
Prior to analysis, daily hunger scores for each of the 3 hunger assessments (worst/most, morning, 
and average) were averaged separately by week. Given that peak (most/worst) hunger does not 
require patients to do a mathematical computation (as does average hunger) and peak hunger is 
inherently meaningful and conceptually equivalent to standard assessment of other symptoms 
(e.g., pain, itching), it is considered the most appropriate among the 3 daily hunger scores.  
For a week of hunger scores to be considered evaluable, scores had to be recorded and available 
for analysis on at least 1 of 7 days to provide sufficient data to determine mean values. This was 
based on prior experience in other conditions. 
Sensitivity analysis based on the DUS population was also performed.  
Descriptive statistics for the change and percent change from baseline in weekly average of daily 
hunger scores were presented for the FAS population by active treatment visit. 
• 
The proportion of patients in the FAS population who achieve a ≥25% improvement from baseline 
in the weekly average of the daily hunger score after ~52 weeks of treatment was analyzed similarly 
to the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Descriptive statistics for the change and percent change from baseline in weekly average of daily 
hunger scores were presented based on the FAS population. Due to the suitability of using the 
hunger score tool in younger patients, this was conducted in patients 
≥12 years of age at baseline.  
Analyses - Secondary 
These analyses were performed on patients in the PCS population with the secondary endpoints being 
compared against the null hypothesis for each of the 100 imputed datasets. The outcomes from the 
100 imputed datasets were combined using Rubin’s Rule to provide a p-value. All analyses his were 
evaluated at a 1-sided, 0.025 significance level.  
•  Body  weight  percent  change  from  baseline  at  14  Weeks  was  a  between-group  comparison  to 
investigate if setmelanotide-treated patients (≥12 years old) exhibited a greater decrease in percent 
change in body weight from baseline following ~14 weeks of therapy, as compared with placebo-
treated patients. 
Sensitivity analyses based on PP at EOP1 and CS were performed.  
Descriptive statistics for the change and percent change from baseline in body weight (kg) were 
presented for the PCS population by visit by randomized treatment.  
•  Daily hunger score percent change from baseline at 14 Weeks was a between-group comparison to 
investigate  if  setmelanotide-treated  patients  exhibited  a  greater  improvement  from  baseline 
following ~14 weeks of therapy in weekly average of daily hunger scores, as compared with placebo-
treated patients.  
Prior to analysis, daily hunger scores for each of the 3 hunger assessments were averaged 
separately by week, as outlined above. Sensitivity analyses based on PP at EOP1 and CS were 
performed.  
Descriptive statistics for the change and percent change from baseline in weekly average of daily 
hunger scores were presented based on the PCS population by visit by randomized treatment. Due

to the suitability of using the hunger score tool in younger patients, this was conducted in patients 
≥12 years of age at baseline.  
Analyses - Missing Data 
For the primary analysis and key secondary analyses, the multiple imputation (MI) imputed 52-week 
values were utilized for patients who had missing 52-week weight data due to nature of study design, 
but patients who had missing 52-week data for any other reason were considered treatment failures 
(including change and percent change from baseline set to 0). 
The MI 52-weeks value data were mainly generated for patients initially assigned to placebo, as these 
subjects only reached 52 weeks of setmelanotide treatment at their Week 66 visit and some of the 
placebo patients had not reached their Week 66 visit by the time of the primary analysis.  
For analyses outside of the primary and key secondary analyses, handling differed based upon the 
analysis specified. Endpoints/analyses requiring imputations that were closely related to the primary or 
key secondary analyses utilized the same handling as the primary and key secondary endpoints 
(baseline replacement). Other analyses utilizing imputation that were not closely related to the primary 
or key secondary analyses utilized the values generated via MI and were not replaced with baseline 
values.  
Missing values in the 14-Week placebo-controlled period analyses were imputed with a similar MI 
approach as defined in the primary imputation approach. 
Analyses – Sensitivity 
Four  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  to  assess  the  impact  of  missing  data  on  weight  (non 
replacement,  active  treatment  completers),  hunger  score  and  data  on  comparisons  between 
setmelanotide-treated patients and placebo patients after ~14 weeks of treatment (treatment failure). 
All sensitivity analyses generated 100 imputed datasets as appropriate and the outcomes from the 100 
imputed datasets were combined using Rubin’s Rule to provide a p-value and corresponding CIs. 
•  Non replacement analysis 
Same data handling as the primary and key secondary analyses. 
•  Active Treatment-Completer’s Analysis 
Same data handling as the primary and key secondary analyses. However, placebo patients who did 
not complete 52 weeks of setmelanotide treatment due to the administrative data cut (i.e., those who 
had not completed the relevant visits yet) were excluded. 
•  Daily Hunger analysis 
Analysis for daily hunger scores was repeated for patients with at least 3 of 7 days of data present. No 
imputations were made for missing data.  
• 
Treatment Failure analysis 
For the non-key secondary endpoints, patients who had missing 14-week data were considered 
treatment failures. As for the secondary analyses, this sensitivity analysis was based on a two-sample 
t-test for each of the 100 imputed datasets.

Abbreviations: ATB = active treatment baseline; FAS = full analysis set. 
Note: Pivotal patients who completed Week 66 were considered to have completed the study. Under Version 3.0 of the protocol, supplemental 
patients were permitted to enrol in a separate long-term extension study (RM-493- 022) upon completion of the Week 24 (Visit 8) visit 
at the earliest, thus, supplemental patients who completed Week 24 (or later) were considered to have completed the study.  
Recruitment 
Date first patient enrolled: 23 November 2018 
Date last patient completed: 08 March 2021 
Conduct of the study 
Of the 52 enrolled patients 32 had a total of 61 major protocol violations. Most (75%) of these 
violations were related to missed assessments at scheduled visits due to COVID-19-related shortening 
or remote visit procedures. Other violations included failure to timely procure Informed Consent (8 
violations) or quality issues with investigational product (5 violations). A total of two violations were 
related to a failure to properly apply exclusion criteria 7-9. None of the violations led to exclusion from 
the PP. 
AS patients only represented 10% of the pivotal FAS ≥12yo cohort. 
Baseline data 
Baseline and demographic data by cohort are presented in  
Table 4 with the pivotal FAS ≥12yo data, which is the cohort intended for the key analyses, highlighted

Numbers analysed 
A total of 52 patients were enrolled, including 38 patients in the pivotal cohort and 14 in the 
supplemental cohort. Two patients in the pivotal cohort discontinued the study during the randomized 
placebo-controlled period and prior to completing their ATB assessments. Therefore these 2 patients 
were included in the PCS (N = 52) for the 14-week placebo-controlled analyses but not the FAS (N = 
50) for the 52-week analyses.  
With respect to clinical diagnoses, 44 of the 52 randomised patients had BBS and 8 had AS. 
The number of patients in each of the study populations used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
setmelanotide in patients with BBS and AS are listed for patients in the pivotal and supplemental 
cohorts by the treatment to which each patient was originally randomized (setmelanotide or placebo).  
Two patients in the pivotal cohort that were originally randomized to placebo discontinued the study 
prior to the open-label treatment period and are not included in the FAS.

Weight from the ATB After 52 Weeks of Setmelanotide - FAS 
Abbreviations: ATB = active treatment baseline; CI = confidence interval; FAS = full analysis set. 
Note:  If  missing  measurements  after  ~52  weeks  due  to  the  nature  of  the  study  design,  a  multiple 
imputation  
model  is  used  to  impute  the  measurements  for  patients  with  less  than  ~52  weeks  of  setmelanotide 
treatment  to  a  timepoint  that  approximates  52  weeks  of  setmelanotide  treatment.  If  missing 
measurement after ~52 weeks due to any other reason, the patient is considered a failure.

Patients ≥18 years of age 
When setmelanotide’s effect on body weight was examined in an ad hoc analysis of the data from 
pivotal BBS patients who were ≥18 years of age, its impact was even greater than that observed in the 
population of patients ≥12 years of age, with ~47% and 60% of patients ≥18 years of age achieving 
≥10% and ≥5% weight loss at ~Week 52, respectively. 
None of the 3 AS patients in this study who were ≥18 years of age achieved ≥5% weight loss at

Note: If missing measurements after ~52 weeks due to the nature of the study design, a multiple imputation  
model is used to impute the measurements for patients with less than ~52 weeks of setmelanotide treatment 
to a timepoint that approximates 52 weeks of setmelanotide treatment. If missing measurement after ~52 
weeks due to any other reason, the patient is considered a failure.

Post-hoc analysis 
At the CHMP request, the MAH submitted primary and secondary endpoint analyses using only non- 
imputed 52-week active treatment data for pivotal Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) patients.  
Data using the ATB are presented in Table 34,Table 35, Table 36, Table 37 and Table 38 . ATB is  
defined as the last available measurement prior to randomization for subjects initially randomized into 
the Setmelanotide group and is defined as the last available measurement prior to the first dose of 
open-label Setmelanotide treatment for subjects initially randomized into the placebo group.

10% reduction in body weight from baseline is less than or equal to a historical control rate of 10%. The alternative 
hypothesis (H1) is that the proportion is greater than a historical control rate of 10%: H0: pt >= 10% vs H1: pt >

Notes:  In  this  table,  baseline  is  defined  as  the  last  assessment  prior  to  initiation  of  setmelanotide;  BMI  Z-scores  were  not 
calculated/presented for patients ≥18 years of age; hunger was not assessed in patients <12 years of age or patients who are

1 For patients in RM-493-023 randomized to 14 weeks of placebo before setmelanotide, weeks on setmelanotide at last visit, 
calculated by subtracting 14 weeks from the total weeks on study, is provided in parentheses. 
2 The patient received their last dose of setmelanotide on Day 3. 
3 The patient received their last dose of setmelanotide on Day 8. 
4 This patient’s height was 52 cm at all visits except for the last visit. Based on this and the fact that the patient was 39 years 
old, the measurement of 159.0 cm at the last visit is likely an error; therefore, this patient’s BMI at the last visit is likely also 
in error given that BMI is calculated based on height and weight. 
Supportive study(ies) 
BBS population 
A total of 42 BBS patients from studies RM-493-023 and RM-493-014 enrolled in the ongoing extension 
study, RM-493-022. At the time of data cut-off (08 March 2021), they had received QD setmelanotide 
for a median of 86 weeks, 70 of which were during the index study and the remainder in the extension 
study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 66/99 
 
 
 
 
The clinically meaningful and statistically significant (assessed only in Study RM-493-023) effects of 
setmelanotide on body weight, BMI, and BMI Z-scores observed in BBS patients during the index 
studies were sustained during the extension study. 
AS population 
A total of 5 AS patients from Studies RM-493-023 (3) and RM-493-014 (2) enrolled in the ongoing 
extension study, RM-493-022; however only the 2 patients from supportive Study RM-493-014 had 
any data beyond the extension study’s baseline visit.  
At the time of data cutoff for this submission, the AS patients in this study had received QD 
setmelanotide for a mean of 112.8 weeks, 66.8 of which were during the index study and the 
remainder (46 weeks) in the extension study. 
Maintenance of the effect of setmelanotide on body weight, and BMI Z-scores was observed in these 2 
AS patients, although high fluctuations in these parameters could be seen in one patient.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To support this grouped application (BBS and AS indications), the clinical efficacy package consisted of 
the clinical trial report of a pivotal Phase 3 partially blinded study, RM-493-023, in addition to short 
summaries of two supportive studies, RM-493-014 (Phase 2, open-label, uncontrolled basket) and RM-
493-022 (observational long-term extension). At the time of this evaluation, RM-493-014 (part of the 
PIP) was still ongoing and no BBS or AS patients <12 years old were included. Study RM-493-014 
enrolled 28 patients who were aged <12 years at the time of enrollment; of these 28 patients, 22 
completed the study and 6 withdrew. 
On  22  April  2022,  on  the  basis  that  additional  data  were  required  and  these  were  considered  still 
provisional, the MAH withdrew the variation related to AS indication. 
To support the pharmacological effect of setmelanotide in the BBS population, the MAH claimed that in 
general the exact mechanism of how this ciliopathy is interacting with the MC4R pathway is currently 
unknown, but based on animal model observations and limited human data it is strongly believed that 
in BBS, it is the leptin receptor which loses some degree of functionality, ultimately believed to 
culminate in deficient α-MSH signalling further downstream. Predicated on this assumption it is 
therefore believed that setmelanotide can function as a replacement α-MSH analogue to take over or 
at least aid in this deficient signalling step. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  efficacy  trial,  RM-493-023,  was  a  blinded  phase  3  study  with  a  rather  peculiar  design 
supposedly informed by the design of RM-493-014. However, as no report or protocol for the study RM-
493-014 is available, it is difficult to draw any informative comparison at this point in time. RM-493-023 
consisted of three distinct study phases following a 1-to-3-week screening. The first phase consisted of 
a  14-week  double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled  period,  followed  by  a  38-week  open  label 
treatment, which was in turn followed by a further 14-Week open-label phase. The choice of a 14 Week 
placebo period versus a full 52 Week placebo design was discussed at the time of the CHMP Scientific 
Advice and also during this procedure. Overall, the CHMP still considered that the 52 week design would 
have  been  more  appropriate.  Nevertheless,  the  rationale  for  limiting  to  14-week  placebo  design 
(retention issues of placebo patients, even with techniques such as rescue-medication-and-counting-as-
non-responder)  is  acknowledged.  Furthermore,  whereas  the  most  valuable  efficacy  data  would  in 
principle  be  collected  during  the  14-week  double-blind  period,  as  this  would  be  the  most  unbiased

comparison between treatment and placebo, the CHMP noted that the MAH chose to deviate from the 
CHMP  Scientific  Advice  and  maintained  the  week  14  analysis  as  a  non-key  secondary  endpoint,  in 
particular  because  this  period  was  considered  too  short  to  show  the  true  potential  impact  on  weight 
outcomes. This further supported the CHMP earlier view on a longer placebo design.  
The choice of dosing levels in the various age groups  was not well understood. No dose finding trials 
were undertaken and the dosing in the pivotal trial was based on observations from studies RM-493-014 
and   RM-493-011. No clinical study reports are yet available for these studies, but a clarification on how 
these studies informed the dosing choices for the pivotal trial was submitted and considered acceptable 
by  the  CHMP.  Doses  ranging  from  0.12  to  9.12  mg  total  daily  dose  have  been  used  in  previous 
setmelanotide clinical studies, in both healthy volunteers and in various patient populations, including 
patients with BBS. Dose titration in clinical study RM-493-011 resulted in minimal initial weight loss at 
doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg QD, yet produced meaningful and progressive weight loss with QD doses of 1.0 
mg  and  above.  In  addition,  there  was  no  evidence  of  increased  sensitivity  or  any  new  safety  issues 
arising in patients treated with doses of 1.0 mg and above. In Study RM-493-014, the setmelanotide 
dose was individualized, starting at 0.5 or 1.0 mg QD and was escalated by 0.5 mg every 2 weeks up to 
a maximum dose of 3.0 mg. The tolerability profile of setmelanotide from this study and additional data 
from other studies supported a simplified dosing regimen and higher starting dose. Study RM-493-014 
did not include any BBS or AS patients aged <12yo, therefore dosing experiences in other indications 
and safety precautions were used to guide the dosing schedule in this young group. This was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
During the first phase  patients randomized to active setmelanotide treatment were up-titrated to the 
final 3 mg QD dose level, and when the double-blind period was finished both phase 1 placebo patients 
as well as setmelanotide patients would be (re)titrated from the base level to the final 3 mg QD level. 
This was supposedly done in order to not break the phase 1 blind while the trial was ongoing. However, 
whether  this  approach  would  have  really  succeeded  in  this  goal  was  questioned  as  presumably  prior 
placebo patients would likely quickly notice a difference in their appetite compared to the previous phase 
(assuming the treatment works and there was no appreciable placebo effect) while prior setmelanotide 
randomized patients could potentially notice  an increase  in their  appetite while  they  were re-titrated. 
However,  based  on  the  results  presented  there  is  no  immediate  indication  that  aberrant  unblinding 
happened or influenced results.  
The trial aimed to enrol 30 patients (with at least 20 BBS and 6 AS subjects), and the first 30 to enrol 
would  form  the  pivotal  cohort  on  which  all  confirmative  analyses  would  be  done.  Any  other  patients 
enrolling  after  these  30  would  form  a  supplemental  cohort  and  could  transition  to  the  RM-493-022 
extension  study  prior  to  the  Week  66  endpoint  of  the  pivotal  trial.  Hence  any  data  from  these 
supplemental  patients  can  only  be  considered  explorative  at  best.  The  CHMP  further  noted  that  the 
supplemental patients could end participation in the pivotal trial prior to finishing the 38 week open-label 
period (Period 2) and considered that it severely weakens the supportive data provided by these patients 
outside of the initial 14-week DB period. 
Analysis of the primary (PE) and key secondary endpoints (KSE) would occur when the last pivotal 
patient had finished his/her Week 52 visit. Analysis of the PE and KSE would make use of the active 
treatment baseline (ATB), and the timing of this ATB differed between phase 1 placebo and 
setmelanotide treated patients as it coincided with the first dose of active treatment. This could lead to 
the issue that some of the initially placebo-treated patients would not have 52 weeks of treatment data 
available at time of analysis, and hence their data would be imputed. Here a major concern over the 
study design becomes apparent, as BBS and AS are very to ultra-rare conditions, limiting the amount 
of patients available. Mixing two patient groups together already implies an inherent level of 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 68/99 
 
 
 
 
heterogeneity, and then having different analysis baselines and imputation methods additionally 
factored in this uncertainty and heterogeneity. 
Primary and key secondary endpoints as used in RM-493-023 study resemble to the endpoints used for 
the POMC/LEPR deficiency studies. However there are some differences, hunger was only analysed in 
not cognitively impaired patients and an historical comparator was used for the proportional endpoints 
and based on data from the CRIBBS registry. Additionally, data from the CRIBBS was also used in the 
sample size calculations. The CHMP noted that the CRIBBS registry was specifically aimed at BBS 
patients and hence questioned to which extent these data could be used for calculations of a mixed 
BBS/AS patient group. Nevertheless, with the withdrawal of the variation related to AS, this design 
issue was not further discussed. 
All PE, KSE and SE analyses were to be done in mixed condition pivotal patients ≥12yo, with results 
per age-group (<12yo, 12yo≤ & <17yo, and ≥18yo), condition (AS or BBS) and functional cognitive 
level (impaired versus non-impaired) to be analysed in subanalyses. In order to minimise Type I error 
risks the KSE were evaluated in a hierarchical fashion. However the CHMP noted the choice of the MAH 
to select weight to be the most pertinent endpoint as opposed to the CHMP Scientific Advice 
recommendation to include the hunger endpoint first in the hierarchical order. This was explained by 
the importance of the effect on weight, i.e. a failure on weight therein would have led to the validity of 
the trial being questioned even if positive effects on hunger outcomes were achieved. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall compliance with study drug, defined as the number of doses administered as recorded in an 
electronic diary divided by the duration of treatment × 100, was sufficiently similar between placebo 
and setmelanotide groups in the pivotal FAS ≥12yo cohort during the 14 week placebo controlled 
period (89.50%, [79.93, 99.08] 95% CI versus 94,53%, [91.57, 97.48] 95％CI). 
Primary endpoint, Key secondary endpoints- primary analysis 
Overall, in the pivotal ≥12yo FAS, being the key analysis population, all PE and KSE were met. The 
study reached the primary endpoint as 32.3% of pivotal patients ≥12 years of age who achieved a 
≥10% reduction in body weight from the ATB was statistically significant (p = 0.0006) compared to a 
historical control rate of 10%. This outcome was confirmed in sensitivity testing using a per protocol 
analysis, a completers analysis, a non-replacement analysis, and a post hoc reanalysis of the data 
using the placebo-controlled period baseline (PCPB) for all patients (as opposed to the ATB).The mean 
percent change from the ATB in body weight in pivotal patients ≥12 years of age after ~52 weeks of 
treatment resulted in a significantly greater reduction in both the mean percent change and the mean 
change from the ATB in body weight as compared to a reference value of 0% reduction from ATB. A 
sensitivity analysis was also conducted using the designated use set as well as a non-replacement 
analysis, a completers analysis, and a post hoc reanalysis of the data using the PCPB. All of these 
confirmed the significant result outcome of the first KSE. The hierarchically second key secondary 
efficacy endpoint is the mean percent change from the ATB in the weekly average of the daily hunger 
score in pivotal patients ≥12 years of age who were not cognitively impaired after ~52 weeks of 
treatment, which was represented by the change in “Most/Worst Hunger over 24 Hours”. This endpoint 
was met, and analyses using different hunger contexts confirmed the findings. Sensitivity analyses 
conducted using patients with at least 3 of 7 days of weekly data and the BBS subgroup in the 
designated use set, as well as the results of a non-replacement analysis, a completers analysis, and a 
post hoc reanalysis of the data using the PCPB instead of the ATB all confirmed the second KSE 
outcome results.

Additional analysis 
Following the CHMP major concern over the use of the active treatment baseline (ATB) and imputation 
techniques to adjust for the chosen design (using different ATB sampling points as described earlier), 
an ad-hoc sensitivity analysis was perform on the primary (PE) and key secondary endpoints (KSE), 
using the true Week 52 data, instead of imputed ones, of all pivotal BBS patients in order to minimize 
the inherent uncertainty of the data. Considering the high variability of the results seen in AS patients, 
the CHMP requested to exclude AS patients to further reduce heterogeneity. Without the AS patients 
and with true Week 52 (W52) BBS data, the results of the study RM-493-023 improved and confirmed 
the validity of the positive effects in the BBS-only patient cohort, that were considered of clinically 
relevant magnitude: Forty-three percent  (43%) of these patients met the conservative primary 
endpoint of >10% weight loss, and mean/median losses in bodyweight versus baseline were improved 
to -9/-8 kg (equivalent to mean/median 7.9/6.2% change versus baseline). The CHMP concluded that 
the AS patients were exerting a relatively strong dampening effect on the overall primary and KSE 
outcomes.  
Given the withdrawal of the variation related to AS patients, no further discussion in this specific 
patient population was necessary. 
Non Key secondary endpoints – secondary analysis 
Secondary analysis in the pivotal ≥12yo PCS population was also underwhelming, as the weight-based 
SE was missed yet the hunger-based SE was met. In contrast, the same analysis for all ≥12yo PCS 
subjects, including supplemental patients, both SE results were reversed (Table 14, Table 15, Table 
16, Table 17, Table 18, Table 19 and Figure 8). These mixed results may be due to the overall design 
of the trial using a 14 week placebo period instead of 52 weeks. Nevertheless all the pivotal BBS 
patients reached the primary and key secondary endpoints, indicating that the effects seen at W14 
were not predictive or representative of the efficacy potential of the treatment. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analysis by age group was most pertinent for the 6-<12yo patients, given their very limited 
numbers. Overall, changes in BMI-Z scores versus active treatment baseline were clinically relevant for 
all patients, including the supplemental and thus exploratory subjects, some of which were only 
treated for a limited time. The placebo-controlled period outcomes comparison did also indicate a 
significantly beneficial effect of setmelanotide on the BMI-Z scores. 
Subgroup analysis by condition showed that the clinical outcomes in the pivotal ≥12yo BBS patients 
appeared to mirror or even outperform the pivotal ≥12yo FAS. In contrast, the outcomes in the AS 
population ≥12yo (n=5, 4 pivotal and 1 supplemental patient) were negative, with all subjects gaining 
weight or increasing their BMI-Z score despite treatment and this for both pivotal and supplemental 
patients. All three <12yo AS patients (n=3, 2 pivotal and 1 supplemental) achieved clinically 
meaningful reductions in BMI-Z scores. Nonetheless, given the extremely limited numbers, the very 
disparate results and the fact that possible extrapolation of results from the BBS patients has not been 
established, it is deemed impossible to consider the treatment effective in AS patients, or a subgroup 
thereof, at this point in time. Hence, even though a medical need in these patients is certainly 
acknowledged, the inclusion of AS patients as a new indication cannot be supported at the present 
time. Subsequently, the variation related to AS was withdrawn and not further discussed. 
Exploratory analyses 
An exploratory cross-trial comparison of outcomes in the RM-493-023 and RM-493-014 trials was 
performed. Though only exploratory and cross-trial it seems that the outcomes for AS and BBS 
Assessment report

patients in study RM-493-023 were generally better than in study RM-493-014. However, given the 
limitations inherent to this comparison no conclusions can be drawn. 
RM-493-014 also provided some additional clinical data in a limited number of AS patients, however 
the results in these subjects were generally underwhelming and did not provide any additional reason 
to reconsider the disparate and inconclusive results seen in the RM-493-023 pivotal trial in the AS 
population. 
In the ongoing study RM-493-022, 42 BBS patients had transitioned from trials RM-493-023 and -014 
with a median of 86 weeks QD setmelanotide treatment at the time of the database lock. Overall, the 
trends seen indicate that the weight loss achieved in the index studies was maintained during the 
extension follow-up. No trend on hunger outcomes were submitted. Only a total of 5 AS patients from 
the aforementioned studies had transitioned at DB lock time, and only 2 of those (both from study RM-
493-014) had data beyond the RM-493-022 baseline visit. Both continued to show a clinically 
meaningful reduction of BMI-Z scores. This result however is not considered to address the major 
concern noted with the results of the AS patients in the pivotal trial. Subsequently, the variation 
related to AS was withdrawn and not further discussed.  
Assessment of the paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Regarding BBS/AS patients aged ≥6yo and <12yo, only 11 subjects of this age category were part of 
the FAS used for the primary, key secondary and secondary analyses as well as the sub-group analyses. 
Of these 11 subjects only 5 were pivotal cohort patients (3 BBS and 2 AS patients) and of these, one AS 
subject discontinued after 4 weeks on setmelanotide in the PCP. Hence clinical experience in this age 
group is extremely limited. Narratives of a total of 6 supplemental patients in this age category provided 
further  supportive  data,  with  the  majority  achieving  meaningful  BMI-Z  and  hunger  score  reductions. 
Based  on  the  totality  of  evidence  available  there  does  not  seem  to  be  any  indication  that  efficacy  or 
safety in this group (6-11 years) differs essentially from the other age groups and hence treatment in 
these young patients with setmelanotide in the BBS population can be considered supported. The overall 
weak  results  seen  in  AS  patients  was  not  further  discussed  following  the  withdrawal  of  the  related 
variation.  See further discussion on safety under 2.5.1. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In general, positive results are seen in BBS patients, with the clinical relevance further confirmed by way 
of an ad-hoc BBS-only analysis using the true W52 data, but the clinical outcomes in AS patients were 
extremely  disparate.  Subsequently,  the  MAH  decided  to  withdraw  the  variation  related  to  the  AS 
indication in the present grouping of variations. The clinical outcomes in 6 to <12yo BBS patients are 
generally positive and further supported by the clinical outcomes in the equivalent supplemental group. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Setmelanotide is already authorised for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated 
with  genetically  confirmed  loss-of-function  biallelic  pro-opiomelanocortin  (POMC),  including  PCSK1, 
deficiency or biallelic leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and above. 
In  the  currently  approved  indication,  the  most  frequent  adverse  reactions  were  hyperpigmentation 
(51%), injection site reaction (39%), nausea (33%), and headache (26%).  
Assessment report

The safety profile based on the limited data seemed to be reassuring, but caution was warranted due to 
experience from other centrally acting anti-obesity products and important potential risks of melanoma, 
prolonged penile erections and depression/suicidal thoughts were to be further monitored long-term in 
the proposed PASS. Since approval, there has only been very limited post-marketing exposure. 
The clinical safety dataset for BBS and AS patients (safety data lock point: 8 March 2021) is based on  
the following studies: 
- the pivotal Phase 3 study RM-493-023 with 44 BBS and 8 AS patients and  only 50 out of 52 exposed 
to setmelanotide 
-    the    ongoing  supportive  study,  an  open-label  Phase  2  study    RM-493-014  (which  also  included 
patients with other RGDOs) with 10 BBS and 4 AS patients 
- and the other ongoing supportive study, RM-493-022 (42 BBS and 5 AS), an open-label study including 
patients after completing their index studies RM-493-023 and -014.  
Overall, 64 patients in the BBS/AS population were included in the setmelanotide clinical program. During 
the procedure, the variation related to AS indication was withdrawn by the applicant. Assessing safety 
was an exploratory objective for the pivotal study RM-493-023, a secondary objective for study RM-493-
014 and a primary objective for study RM-493-022.  
No  interim  study  reports  have  been  provided  for  the  ongoing  studies,  only  a  specific  document  with 
tables,  listings  and  figures.  For  study  RM-493-022,  a  Summary  of  Clinical  Safety  (SCS)  has  been 
submitted.  For  study  RM-493-014,  data  have  just  been  included  in  the  tables  on  combined  BBS/AS 
population.  
During the procedure, the variation related to AS has been withdrawn, however since the safety analyses 
have been performed for the combined BBS/AS populations, the combined data (with only 11 AS patients 
who have been treated with setmelanotide in total) will be further discussed below in the context of the 
BBS indication, remaining variation applied for.

Of the 561 exposed subjects in all studies, 132 have been treated for at least 6 months, 94 have been 
treated for at least 1 year and 60 for at least 18 months. Of the BBS/AS population, 49 patients have 
been treated for at least 6 months, 39 have been treated for at least 1 year and 21 for at least 18 months 
which is a larger sample size than for POMC/LEPR deficiency patients used to support the initial approval. 
The BBS patients in the long-term extension study RM-493-022 had received setmelanotide for a median 
of 86 weeks (70 during the index study and 16 weeks in the extension study) while the AS patients had 
received setmelanotide for a mean of 112.8 weeks (66.8 during the index study and 46 weeks in the 
extension study). 
Adverse events  
All BBS and AS patients (100%) in the setmelanotide group reported at least 1 TEAE (n=64) while 
92.3% of placebo-patients reported at least 1 TEAE (n=26).

Overall, the most common TEAEs among BBS and AS setmelanotide-treated patients, with the 
corresponding incidence among placebo-treated patients, were: skin hyperpigmentation: 70% (45/64) 
versus 0%; Injection site erythema: 38% (24/64) versus 39% (10/26); Injection site pruritus: 36% 
(23/64) versus 31% (8/26); Nausea: 33% (21/64) versus 15% (4/26) and Vomiting: 28% (18/64) 
versus 0%.  
The most common type of TEAE was skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, most commonly skin 
hyperpigmentation. Other common types of TEAEs were general disorders and administration site 
conditions, primarily local reactions at the injection site (i.e., erythema, pruritus, induration, bruising, 
pain, and oedema) and gastrointestinal disorders, most commonly nausea and vomiting.  
In study RM-493-023 (full period), a total of 51 (98.1%) patients experienced at least 1 TEAE in the full 
study  that  was  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  study  drug-related.  As  was  the  case  for  TEAEs 
overall,  the  most  common  study  drug-related  TEAEs  were  reactions  at  the  injection  site,  including 
injection site erythema (25 patients; 48.1%), injection site pruritus (18 patients; 34.6%), injection site 
bruising (17 patients; 32.7%), injection site pain (14 patients; 26.9%), and injection site induration (13 
patients; 25.0%), as well as skin hyperpigmentation (33 patients; 63.5%), nausea (13 patients; 25.0%), 
and vomiting (8 patients; 15.4%). During the placebo controlled period, the most common type of TEAEs 
were  skin  hyperpigmentation,  injection  site  reactions,  and  nausea  and  vomiting.  Nasal  congestion  (3 
patients) and high-density lipoprotein increased (4 patients) also occurred in ≥2 patients who received 
setmelanotide during the double-blind treatment period. A total of 51 (98.1%) patients experienced at 
least 1 TEAE in the full study that was considered by the Investigator to be study drug-related. As was 
the case for TEAEs overall, the most common study drug-related TEAEs were reactions at the injection 
site, including injection site erythema (25 patients; 48.1%), injection site pruritus (18 patients; 34.6%), 
injection site bruising (17 patients; 32.7%), injection site pain (14 patients; 26.9%), and injection site 
induration (13 patients; 25.0%), as well as skin hyperpigmentation (33 patients; 63.5%), nausea (13

In study RM-493-023 (full period), 3 (5.8%) patients experienced a total of 5 SAEs. After the double-
blind treatment period, 1 patient (who experienced complete vision loss [blindness] during the double-
blind period) had 2 events of suicidal ideation (verbalized suicidal thought ). The patient had no 
previous history of depression, and the events were judged by the Investigator to be unlikely related 
to study medication and attributable to concomitant disease. During the double-blind study period, 3 
(5.8%) patients experienced SAEs, 2 of whom were receiving placebo. One SAE was considered by the 
Investigator to be related to study drug (anaphylactic reaction in a placebo patient). One SAE 
(anaemia) was reported in a patient receiving setmelanotide as being due to gynaecological bleeding 
and was judged by the Investigator to be most likely due to initiation of oral contraceptives. No SAEs 
were reported in >1 patient.  
In all BBS and AS patients, most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe TEAEs were 
reported in 7 (11%) setmelanotide-treated patients with BBS or AS. Severe TEAEs in this patient 
population included anaemia (2 subjects; 3%), abdominal pain, pancreatitis, urinary tract infection, 
COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, rotavirus infection, hypoxia, diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, 
hypertriglyceridemia, renal neoplasm, auditory hallucination, suicidal ideation, and blood phosphorus 
decreased (each 1 subject; 2%). Both severe cases of anaemia resolved and were considered by the 
investigator as not related to setmelanotide. 
Events of special interest (ESIs) 
ESIs were defined as those either related to TEAEs commonly occurring during treatment with 
setmelanotide (hyperpigmentation disorders, disturbances in sexual arousal, nausea, vomiting, and 
injection site reactions) or potential MC4 pathway mechanistic-related events such as hypertension, or 
other events associated with background disease such as depression and suicidal ideation. TEAE 
verbatim and preferred terms were reviewed by Sponsor medical personnel to identify those TEAEs 
that represented ESIs in each category.

In study RM-493-023, no females experienced sexual events of interest during the double-blind study 
period. Four male patients experienced sexual events of interest during the study. Changes included 
change in frequency of erections (N = 3) and change in sex drive, change in ability to achieve erection, 
and groin discomfort (N = 1 each). There were no occurrences of prolonged or painful erections that 
required intervention.

Hypertension 
In study RM-493-023, there were no TEAEs of hypertension or blood pressure increased that started 
while a patient was on setmelanotide, except for 2 patients.  
One patient had a history of hypertension. Exacerbation of hypertension was reported as a mild TEAE. 
The patient completed the study. For the other patient, although not in the medical history, 
hypertension was diagnosed on Day -7 of screening, no treatment was initiated, and the event was 
reported as resolved by Day 42. A TEAE of moderate hypertension was subsequently reported on Day 
99, no treatment was initiated, and the event was reported as resolved by Day 156.

experienced mild events and no event of nausea or vomiting was severe. Review of the time of onset 
of nausea and vomiting events among setmelanotide-treated patients with BBS or AS in Study RM-
493-023 showed that during the randomized controlled period, the onset was most common in the first 
month of setmelanotide treatment and was much less common over the subsequent months of

In the BBS/AS population, 64.1% (41/64) and 76.9% (20/26) of setmelanotide- and placebo-treated 
patients, respectively, experienced at least 1 TEAE representative of an ISR. 
In study RM-493-023 (double-blind period), placebo-controlled treatment period, events occurred at 
similar incidence in patients who received setmelanotide as in those who received placebo, indicating 
that injection site reactions are not due to setmelanotide, but are related to the injection and/or 
excipients.  
Laboratory findings 
In patients with BBS or AS, there were no clinically significant changes from baseline and no 
discernable pattern of shift from baseline to abnormal in hematology and clinical chemistry 
parameters.  In Study RM-493-023, for hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters, there were no 
clinically significant findings, beyond results reported as TEAEs, no clinically significant changes from 
baseline and no clinically significant shifts from baseline. Also in urinalysis and in coagulation 
parameters, no significant abnormalities or changes from baseline were seen.

Vital signs, physical findings and other safety observations 
In Study RM 493-023, there was no apparent effect of setmelanotide on BP, HR, or other vital signs in 
patients with BBS or AS. One patient, randomized to setmelanotide, had a clinically significantly 
abnormal ECG finding at Week 15 (Visit 6), which was reported as a moderate TEAE of bradycardia 
and the event was considered by the Investigator as related to study drug.  
Immunological events 
In study RM-493-023, a total of 169 samples from 48 patients were tested for ADAs. Of these, 1 
sample from 1 paediatric BBS patient was confirmed positive for ADA with a very low titer. 
Importantly, this patient achieved clinically meaningful reductions in body weight and BMI Z-scores 
during treatment with setmelanotide and did not experience any SAEs or any moderate or severe 
treatment related TEAEs. Samples from an additional 5 patients were flagged for re-analysis with the 
results to be reported in amendment to the Bioanalytical Report. Based on the results at this time, it is 
concluded that there was 1 patient with confirmed antiRM-493 antibodies with a low titer; there was 
no impact of ADA on safety or efficacy in this patient. 
Safety in special populations 
No elderly patients were included in the pivotal or supportive RM-493-023, RM-493-014 and RMP-493-
022 studies. 
Of the BBS patients 6-<12 years old, 2 were treated with setmelanotide for 3-6 months, 3 for 6-12 
months, 1 for 12-18 months and 2 for more than 18 months so only 3 of these patients were treated 
for more than 1 year. Of the AS patients 6-<12 years old, 1 was treated with setmelanotide for less 
than 1 month and 2 for 6-12 months so none of these patients were treated for more than 1 year. 
There were 5 pivotal paediatric patients (aged 6-<12 years) with BBS or AS, included in Study RM-
493-023, and 6 supplemental paediatric patients (aged 6-<12 years) with BBS or AS. No unexpected 
safety issues were identified for these paediatric BBS/AS patients. For the 20 pivotal paediatric 
patients (aged 6 -<18 years) in study RM-493-023 (16 BBS/4 AS), 4 discontinued early: 2 due to AEs 
(1 BBS/1 AS), 1 due to the dislike of the injections (AS) and 1 was lost to follow-up i.e.,  a 12-year old 
BBS patient who was withdrawn early by his parents due to previously recorded headache, leg pain 
and belligerent behaviour.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Table 56 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation by 
MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term – All BBS and AS Patients (Safety 
Population) 
In all BBS and AS patients, discontinuation of setmelanotide due to TEAEs occurred in 6 (9%) of 64 
BBS/AS patients. Most TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in 1 patient each 
(multiple events in 1 patient): abdominal pain, acne, hidradenitis, skin hyperpigmentation, ocular 
hyperaemia, face oedema, headache, auditory hallucination, hot flush. The only TEAEs leading to 
setmelanotide discontinuation in >1 patient were nausea and vomiting, which occurred in 3 (5%) 
patients.  
In study RM-493-023, the most common reasons for stopping study drug prematurely were nausea 
and vomiting (each occurring in 5.8% of patients overall). During the double-blind period), a few 
patients prematurely stopped study drug due to a TEAE, The incidence of patients who discontinued 
during the double-blind period due to nausea was similar in both treatment groups (3.7% vs 4.0%) 
and 1 patient (3.7%) in the setmelanotide treatment group discontinued due to vomiting. 
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing data are available in the United States (US). In a total of 15 patients, 29 cases were 
reported with 82 events of which one was serious but unrelated (staphylococcal infection). No new safety 
signals or potentially serious drug interactions have been identified in the post-marketing setting. The 
most  commonly  reported  events  are  non-serious  injection  site  reactions  and  non-serious  skin 
discolorations.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, safety data from 64 BBS/AS patients treated with setmelanotide have been presented which is 
limited but inherent to orphan diseases, and these data were completed by an updated safety “all 
population” analysis using data from other setmelanotide studies in healthy volunteers with obesity, in 
other RGDOs, in other indications and in subjects with renal impairment, including a total, 673 patients 
(561 treated with  setmelanotide and 112 received placebo).  
Still, long-term data are limited in the setmelanotide clinical studies. Of the BBS/AS population, 49 
patients have been treated for at least 6 months, 39 have been treated for at least 1 year and 21 for 
at least 18 months which is a larger sample size than for POMC/LEPR deficiency patients used to 
support the initial approval. The CHMP therefore recommended to  extend the observational Registry 
(PASS, RM-IMC-901) in the POMC/LEPR deficiency populations to include BSS patients noting the 
withdrawal of the variation related to AS. 
All BBS and AS patients (100%) in the setmelanotide group reported at least 1 TEAE (n=64) while 92.3% 
of placebo-patients reported at least 1 TEAE (n=26). The  most common type of TEAE in BBS and AS 
patients  was  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders,  most  commonly  skin  hyperpigmentation.  Other 
common  types  of  TEAEs  were  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions,  primarily  local 
reactions  at  the  injection  site  (i.e.,  erythema,  pruritus,  induration,  bruising,  pain,  and  oedema)  and 
gastrointestinal disorders, most commonly nausea and vomiting. The frequencies of some of the most 
common TEAEs were much higher in the BBS and AS population than in the “all population” original and 
updated analyses but were lower than or similar than the ones observed in the POMC/LEPR deficiency 
patients original safety analysis (SCS January 2021):  skin hyperpigmentation (70% vs 51%/49%/86%), 
injection site erythema (38% vs 24%/29%/69%), injection site pruritis (36% vs 17%/21%/49%), and 
vomiting  (28%  vs  12%/15%/29%).  Four  out  of  27  setmelanotide-treated  patients  (14.8%)  reported 
high density lipoprotein decreased in the 14-week placebo-controlled period in study RM-493-023 while 
none  of  the  25  placebo-treated  patients  reported  this.  However,  these  all  occurred  on  the  day  of 
randomisation and do not raise any particular concerns at the present time. 
No death was reported in patients with BBS or AS. 
SAEs were reported in 7 setmelanotide-treated BBS/AS patients were not considered treatment-
related, although one SAE was abdominal pain and is listed adverse drug reaction (ADR). 
In all BBS and AS patients, most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe TEAEs were 
reported in 7 (11%) setmelanotide-treated patients with BBS or AS. Severe TEAEs in this patient 
population included anaemia (2 subjects; 3%) and abdominal pain, pancreatitis, urinary tract infection, 
COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, rotavirus infection, hypoxia, diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, 
hypertriglyceridemia, renal neoplasm, auditory hallucination, suicidal ideation, and blood phosphorus 
decreased (each 1 subject; 2%). Both severe cases of anaemia resolved and were considered by the 
investigator as not related to setmelanotide. 
During the procedure, the CHMP raised concerns over the presentation and discussion of the safety 
data, which were subsequently addressed by the applicant within the responses to supplementary 
information. Overall, the CHMP considered that the updated “all population” safety analysis and the 
new data for the BBS/AS population did not change the overall safety profile of setmelanotide. 
However information on elderly and paediatric populations have been updated in the SmPC and is 
further discussed below. In addition, frequencies of some existing ADRs have been updated in the 
SmPC and new ADRs have also been added based on these new data. 
The frequencies of the hyperpigmentation disorders-related TEAEs in the BBS and AS population (75% 
[48/64] were higher than in the “all population” original (51% [244/476]) and updated (58% [322/561])

analyses but lower than in the POMC and LEPR deficiency population (86% [30/35]). All except one of 
the AS patients (91% [10/11]) reported hyperpigmentation disorders. The impact of hyperpigmentation 
disorders remains limited as most reports of hyperpigmentation disorders in BBS and AS patients were 
mild  to  moderate,  there  were  no  serious  related  hyperpigmentation  disorders,  and  these  only  led  to 
setmelanotide interruption in 2 subjects (N= 561, <1%, none in BBS/AS patients) and although it led to 
17 discontinuations in the all-patients population (N= 561, 3%), this only occurred in 1 BBS/AS patient 
(N=64, 1.6%). No melanoma (important potential risk of  setmelanotide) was reported in the BBS/AS 
population or in the updated “all population” analysis that was submitted in this procedure. 
In BBS and AS patients, 13% (8/64) experienced at least 1 TEAE representative of a sexual event, 
which appeared consistent with the “all-population” original (15% [72/476] and updated (15% 
[86/561]) analyses and to POMC/LEPR deficiency patient population (17% [6/35]). In BBS and AS 
patients the most commonly reported sexual event was spontaneous penile erection (13% [8/64]). No 
prolonged penile erections (important potential risk of setmelanotide) were reported. 
In the BBS/AS population, 3% (2/64) experienced at least 1 TEAE representative of a depression. 
There was 1 patient with suicidal ideation, however no apparent drug-related increase in suicidality or 
depression as measured by the C-SSRS and the PHQ-9 were reported. 
In the “all population” updated analysis, depression (important potential risk of setmelanotide)  was 
reported in a total of 22 setmelanotide-treated patients (4%). Suicidal ideation was reported in a total 
of 5 (1%) setmelanotide-treated patients. In 4 patients, the suicidal ideation during treatment 
occurred in conjunction with depression, and for 2 patients it was considered serious but non-
treatment-related by the investigator. The current SmPC includes a warning to monitor each medical 
visit for any depressive symptoms and consider discontinuing treatment if patients experience suicidal 
thoughts or behaviours. This is considered sufficient to manage this important potential risk of 
setmelanotide. 
ISRs were reported more frequently in BBS and AS patients (64% [41/64]) than in the “all population” 
original (l 39% [184/476] and updated (46% [260/561]) analyses but much less frequently than in 
POMC and LEPR deficiency populations (89% [31/35]). These ISR appeared to be related to the 
injection and/or excipients rather than to setmelanotide as more placebo-treated patients (77% 
[20/26]) reported ISRs than setmelanotide-treated patients in the BBS and AS population. The safety 
profile for ISRs remain consistent with the one observed during the initial marketing evaluation. 
Hypertension and blood pressure increased were reported more frequently in BBS and AS patients (8% 
[5/64]) than in the “all population” original (1% [6/476]), updated ( 2% [12/561]) analyses and than 
in POMC and LEPR deficiency populations (3% [1/35]). For the 5 patients, 3 with hypertension and 2 
with BP increased, the event was assessed by the Investigator as setmelanotide-related. Nevertheless, 
in the BBS/AS population as compared to placebo over 14 weeks there was no evidence of a difference 
between placebo or active therapy for both systolic and diastolic BP and thus the addition of 
hypertension as an ADR is not warranted at the present time. 
In BBS and AS patients, the incidence of nausea (33% [21/64]) was consistent with the “all- 
population” original (33% [157/476]), updated (35% [198/561]) analyses and was much lower than in 
POMC/LEPR deficiency patients (57% [20/35]). The incidence of vomiting (28% [18/64]) was however 
much higher than in “all- population” original (12% [59/476]), updated (15% [86/561]) analyses but 
similar to the one observed in the POMC/LEPR deficiency population (29% [10/35]). Given the initial 
doses in the pivotal study for BBS and AS patients were twice as high as those in the pivotal study for 
POMC/LEPR deficiency patients, these observations do not raise a particular concern, nausea and 
vomiting are listed ADRs in the current SmPC of setmelanotide.

Several clinical chemistry TEAEs occurred in BBS/AS patients in the pivotal study (active treatment), 
some were serious and/or severe and/or led to study drug interruption or discontinuation: blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased (7 total, 1 BBS/AS pivotal cohort RM-493-023, 2 related, 1 severe, 1 
leading to study drug interruption); alanine aminotransferase increased (5 total, 1 BBS/AS pivotal 
cohort RM-493-023, 2 related); hypoglycemia (4 total, 1 related, 2 serious, 2 severe, 1 leading to 
study drug discontinuation); blood uric acid increased (3 total, 1 BBS/AS pivotal cohort RM-493-023, 1 
related); blood bilirubin increased (2 total, 2 related); eosinophil count decreased (2 total, 1 related); 
blood creatine increased (1 total, 1 BBS/AS pivotal cohort RM-493-023, 1 related). However, all these 
AEs were considered unrelated to setmelanotide since no causal relationship could be established. 
One case of bradycardia was reported in a setmelanotide-treated patient in study RM-493-023 that 
was considered treatment-related by the Investigator. In the absence of any other concomitant 
symptoms and considering that these heart rates represent a mild bradycardia, which is a common 
and usually benign condition, this appears to be a benign event with a conservative classification of the 
AE based on observed findings rather than an actual clinical event. Previous comprehensive 
assessments of effects on heart rate (24-hour Holter) were included in the initial MAA without evidence 
of effects on heart rate. 
No elderly patients were included in the pivotal or supportive RM-493-023, RM-493-014 and RMP-493-
022 studies. However based on the “all population” updated analysis, additional new information was 
included in the SmPC. Available data in a small sample of elderly patients suggest no marked changes 
in setmelanotide exposure with increased age. However, these data are too limited to draw definite 
conclusions. Nineteen patients (in studies of unapproved indications) and healthy volunteers aged 65 
years or older have been treated with Imcivree in clinical trials. Although there were no apparent age-
related differences observed in these studies, the number of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient 
to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.” 
Discontinuation of setmelanotide due to AEs occurred in 6 of the 64 BBS and AS patients treated with 
setmelanotide (9%), and in 60 of setmelanotide-treated patients (11%) and 6 placebo-treated patients 
(5%) in the “all population” updated analysis with nausea and vomiting as the most common reason. 
Most of these AEs leading to discontinuation in BBS and AS patients are already listed in SmPC section 
4.8. and those that are not (acne, hidradenitis, ocular hyperaemia, face oedema) were not considered 
treatment-related by the investigator and there was only 1 case each. For the “all population” updated 
analysis, most of the AEs leading to discontinuation of setmelanotide in more than 1 patient, are 
already listed in SmPC section 4.8. except for ventricular tachycardia. This was reported in 2 patients, 
both healthy subjects with obesity, and was moderate and resolved in less than 1 minute after onset, 
In one of the cases, it was considered not treatment-emergent. Based on this information, ventricular 
tachycardia is not considered at the present time as a safety signal.  
Assessment of the paediatric data on clinical safety 
For  the  paediatric  patients  (aged  6-<12  years)  with  BBS  or  AS,  no  unexpected  safety  issues  were 
identified and this was further supported by an analysis of “all population” aged -<12 years old regarding 
common, treatment-related, severe and serious TEAEs which concluded to a similar safety profile across 
these 2 populations in this age group. For the 20 pivotal paediatric patients (aged 6 -<18 years) in study 
RM-493-023 (16 BBS/4 AS), 4 discontinued early: 2 due to AEs (1 BBS/1 AS), 1 due to the dislike of the 
injections (AS) and 1 was lost to follow-up i.e.,  a 12-year old BBS patient who was withdrawn early by 
his  parents  due  to  previously  recorded  headache,  leg  pain  and  belligerent  behaviour.  The  SmPC  was 
updated to include information on BBS patients including the patient aged ≥ 12 years confirmed positive 
to setmelanotide anti-drug antibodies with a very low titre. 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 84/99 
 
 
 
 
Safety in paediatric patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency and BBS is intended to be further followed-
up in the PASS (observational Registry) noting the MAH has withdrawn the variation related to AS, 
Whereas  many  of  the  most  common  TEAEs  (>10%)  in  the  updated  “all-patients  population”  analysis 
were reported much more frequently in the paediatric population (especially 6-< 12 years old) than in 
the adult population,  some  are  expected to  occur more frequently in general in  children (e.g.  cough, 
pharyngitis streptococcal, nasopharyngitis). Given data are collected from multiple studies with different 
study  designs  and  in  different  patient  populations  including  healthy  volunteers,  firm  conclusions  on 
observed differences between adult and paediatric population are difficult to draw due to the relatively 
small  number  of  events.  At  the  present  time,  the  safety  profile  in  the  paediatric  population  is  not 
considered to be different to that in adult patients. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety data from the Phase 3 clinical studies in BBS and AS patients, and the updated safety data 
from ongoing studies in other indications, demonstrate a safety profile of setmelanotide that is 
generally consistent with the overall safety profile in POMC and LEPR deficiency populations as 
established in the initial evaluation, and also in the paediatric population. Safety is intended to be  
further followed-up in the PASS (observational Registry) to be extended to BBS paediatric and adult 
patients. 
No new important safety concerns have emerged so no new identified or important potential risks were 
recommended to be added to the RMP, beyond those already reflected in the currently approved RMP. 
The SmPC, patient leaflet and RMP have been revised to extend the indication by including BBS 
patients and to include the updated information on the safety profile.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet (PL) has been updated accordingly. 
In addition section 4.6 of the SmPC was amended to include a cross reference to 4.4 in relation to a 
warning on potential risk from the excipient benzyl alcohol and section 3 of the PL was updated to 
include more information on the preparation of the syringe based on further data submitted during the

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
At the time of the initial submission, the Applicant requested a group of extension of indications to add  
the treatment of obesity and uncontrolled hunger associated with Bardet-Biedl and Alström Syndromes 
(BBS  and  AS)  in  adults  and  children  6  years  of  age  and  above.  On  22  April  2022,  on  the  basis  that 
additional data were required and these were considered still provisional, the MAH withdrew the variation 
related to the AS indication.

BBS is a primary ciliopathy which is believed to play a role in impaired transport of the leptin receptor 
(LEPR) to the ciliary membrane of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the 
hypothalamus. Under normal conditions, leptin, a hormone predominantly made by adipose cells, 
stimulates firing and gene expression in POMC neurons, promoting the secretion of alpha-melanocyte 
stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Alpha-MSH stimulates the MC4R located in the second order neurons in 
the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and results in decreased hunger and weight 
and increased energy expenditure. Impaired or absent LEPR signaling in POMC neurons would be 
expected to reduce MC4R stimulation in second order neurons, resulting in an increase in appetite, 
reduced metabolic rate, and increased weight.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently no approved therapies or products in development specifically for treatment of 
obesity and reduction of hyperphagia in patients with BBS and there is no evidence that alternative 
potential (unapproved) therapies might be useful.  
The only pharmacologic treatments available are products for general obesity/weight management of 
which four products are currently authorised with obesity-related indications in the EU: Xenical, 
Saxenda, Mysimba, and Celevac. These general obesity medicines have mechanisms of action which do 
not address the underlying MC4R pathway signalling defects that lead to insatiable hunger and 
extreme obesity. Therefore, there is no indication that these drugs are therapeutically useful in 
patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency obesity. 
The absence of drug therapy and unsuitability of surgical intervention leaves only lifestyle modification 
(i.e., diet and exercise) as available therapeutic interventions for patients with severe obesity. These, 
however, are rarely successful over the short-term and almost never effective in the long-term due to 
the intense drive to eat caused by the absence of satiety signals.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Results of a single phase 3 study, RM-493-023 were submitted to support this application. Study RM-
493-023 consisted of three distinct treatment periods, including an initial 14 week double-blind 
placebo-controlled period, followed by two open-label treatment periods taking 38 weeks and 14 weeks 
respectively. During the double placebo-controlled period patients would be randomised to receive 
either placebo or setmelanotide. The treatment group used a dose titration schedule informed by 
clinical observations from trials RM-493-014 and -011. Two different cohorts were defined: the Pivotal 
cohort ( the first 30 BBS and 6 AS subjects enrolled) and the Supplemental cohort (all patients 
enrolled after the pivotal cohort). All main confirmatory analyses would be performed using the Pivotal 
cohort and results from the Supplemental were only considered exploratory, given that the latter could 
exit the study to enrol in the RM-493-022 extension trial at any time after they completed the PCP. 
After 14 Weeks of PCP participations patients would enrol in the open-label Period 2 and at this point 
former placebo-randomised patients would be uptitrated with active treatment according to the 
informed schedule while former setmelanotide-randomised patients would once again undergo a 
similar up titration starting from the initial PCP starting dose in order to preserve the PCP blind. 
Analysis of PCP data, a secondary endpoint, would use the PCPB (as measured at time of PCP 
enrolment) as baseline values, while the primary and key secondary endpoints would use the ATB (as 
measured when a subject first received setmelanotide) as baseline values. Analysis would take place 
when the last pivotal patient enrolled would complete his/her Period 2, which could lead to a situation 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 91/99 
 
 
 
 
where some placebo patients have less than 52 Weeks of active treatment data available and hence 
their W52 values would be imputed. 
Analysis according to age and condition were to be performed as exploratory subgroup analyses. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary and key secondary endpoints were met in the pivotal ≥12yo FAS population, which was 
the main population to be used for H0 testing. 
•  A statistically significant proportion of 32.3% of these patients had a weight decrease of at least 
10% versus active treatment baseline compared to a 10% historic control of untreated patients. 
•  A statistically significant mean -5.2% difference in bodyweight was achieved in this population 
versus active treatment baseline. 
•  A  statistically  significant  mean  -30.91%  difference  in  weekly  average  worst daily  hunger  was 
achieved in this population versus active treatment baseline. 
•  A statistically significant proportion of 62.5% of these patients had a weight decrease of at least 
25% versus active treatment baseline compared to a 10% historic control of untreated patients. 
An ad-hoc analysis of the pivotal ≥12yo BBS-only cohort using true W52 data for all subjects 
confirmed the clinical relevance of the prespecified primary and key secondary outcomes in in the 
pivotal ≥12yo FAS population: 
•  A statistically significant proportion of 43.5% of these patients had a weight decrease of at least 
10% versus active treatment baseline compared to a 10% historic control of untreated patients. 
•  A statistically significant mean -7.78% difference in bodyweight was achieved in this population 
versus active treatment baseline. 
•  A  statistically  significant  mean  -38.75%  difference  in  weekly  average  worst  daily  hunger  was 
achieved in this population versus active treatment baseline. 
•  A statistically significant proportion of 72.7% of these patients had a weight decrease of at least 
25% versus active treatment baseline compared to a 10% historic control of untreated patients. 
In the 14 Week placebo-controlled period setmelanotide-treated patients showed a statistically 
significant difference of weekly average daily hunger score versus PCPB of -20,27% compared to the 
placebo-control cohort. 
In the subgroup analysis in patients <12yo, though only exploratory, there was a clear trend towards 
clinically meaningful positive changes in BMI-Z scores. 
Subgroup analysis in the pivotal ≥12yo FAS BBS patients revealed results that mirrored and even 
outperform the pivotal ≥12yo full FAS results in weight outcomes: 
•  A statistically significant proportion of 35,7% of BBS patients had a weight decrease of at least 
10% versus active treatment baseline compared to a 10% historic control of untreated patients. 
•  A  statistically  significant  mean  -6.47%  difference  in  bodyweight  was  achieved  in  the  BBS 
population versus active treatment baseline. 
•  A  statistically  significant  mean  -30.45%  difference  in  weekly  average  worst daily  hunger  was 
achieved in the BBS population versus active treatment baseline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 92/99 
 
 
 
 
•  A statistically significant proportion of 57.1% of BBS patients had a weight decrease of at least 
25% versus active treatment baseline compared to a 10% historic control of untreated patients. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Despite  meeting  the  prespecified  primary  and  key  secondary  objectives,  the  overall  outcomes  in  the 
pivotal RM-493-023, only 32.3% of patients attained the primary endpoint with a mean weight loss of 
5.9 kg versus baseline (median loss = 4.37 kg) at Week 52 and a mean weight loss of 3.06 kg, which 
was not statistically different from the placebo group. 
Outcomes in AS patients were unconvincing, but as the AS population is no longer a claimed indication 
following the withdrawal of the related variation, this uncertainty is not further discussed. 
Only very few pivotal patients (n=5) below the age of 12 were included in the trial, making statistically 
sound  decision  making  difficult.  The  subgroup  analyses  by  age  were  only  exploratory.  PE,  KSE  and 
secondary (SE) were not evaluated in patients younger than 12 years of age, though positive effects on 
BMI-Z  scores  were  seen.  In  combination  with  the  full  clinical  data  for  these  patients,  the  totality  of 
evidence supports use of setmelanotide in the 6 to 12 yo BBS patient population since there does not 
seem to be any indication that efficacy or safety in this group (6-11 years) differs essentially from the 
other age groups. 
PCP outcomes were at times contradictory,  indicating that a longer PCP may have been  preferable to 
allow a more robust analysis. These findings are consistent with the MAH’s observation that 14 weeks of 
follow-up is likely too short to detect appreciable weight changes but that the hunger outcomes, though 
not significantly different, are at least directionally similar. 
Historical data used for sample size estimation and historical control was determined from the CRIBBS 
registry. This registry is however a BBS-exclusive registry, and it  was not clear how the data thereof 
could therefore be used in statistically valid way for methodologic decisions on a population that mixes 
BBS and AS patients, being two distinct conditions. Nevertheless, with the withdrawal of the variation 
related to AS, this design issue was not further discussed. 
Long-term  efficacy  in  regard  to  maintenance  of  weight  loss  is  currently  lacking  in  AS  patients,  and 
likewise data on long term hunger control maintenance is currently lacking in BBS and AS patients. Note 
that  AS  is  no  longer  part  of  the  requested  indication,  and  thus  data  for  this  condition  are  no  longer 
considered pertinent for this variation.  
No robust comparison of the PK parameters and profiles between BBS/AS population and POMC or LEPR 
deficient patients could be made based on the limited data available in children and the high variability 
observed  in  the  studies.  However  the  CHMP  agreed  that  in  adults  and  adolescents  the  mean 
setmelanotide  trough  concentrations  across  studies  based  on  dose  were  similar,  with  overlapping 
standard deviations. In addition, the Population Pharmacokinetic (POPK) model has not been updated 
(due to insufficient data to allow reassessment of the model), although it was acknowledged that from 
the trough concentration values presented for studies RM-493-012 and RM-493-015, the concentration 
values  for  setmelanotide  were  overall  consistent  with  repeat  dosing  across  studies  and  disease 
population. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
During the procedure, the CHMP raised concerns over the presentation and discussion of the safety 
data, which were subsequently addressed by the applicant within the responses to supplementary 
information. Overall, the CHMP considered that the updated “all population” safety analysis and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 93/99 
 
 
 
 
new data for the BBS/AS population did not change the overall safety profile of setmelanotide. 
However information on elderly and paediatric populations have been updated in the SmPC. In 
addition, frequencies of some existing ADRs have been updated in the SmPC and new ADRs have also 
been added based on these new data. 
Some of the most common TEAEs (e.g. skin hyperpigmentation, injection site erythema, injection site 
pruritus, vomiting) are reported much more frequently in the BBS and AS population than in the ”all- 
population” original and update analyses but these TEAEs are reported at a lower or similar frequency 
as observed in POMC/LEPR deficiency populations. 
The frequencies of the hyperpigmentation disorders-related TEAEs in the BBS and AS population (75% 
[48/64] were higher than in the “all population” original (51% [244/476]) and updated  (58% 
[322/561]) analyses but lower than in the POMC and LEPR deficiency population (86% [30/35]). All 
except one of the AS patients (91% [10/11]) reported hyperpigmentation disorders. The impact of 
hyperpigmentation disorders remains limited as most reports of hyperpigmentation disorders in BBS 
and AS patients were mild to moderate. No melanoma (important potential risk of setmelanotide) was 
reported in the BBS/AS population or in the updated “all population” analysis that was submitted in 
this procedure. 
In BBS and AS patients, 13% (8/64) experienced at least 1 TEAE representative of a sexual event, 
which appeared consistent with the “all-population” original (15% [72/476] and updated (15% 
[86/561]) analyses and to POMC/LEPR deficiency patient population (17% [6/35]). In BBS and AS 
patients the most commonly reported sexual event was spontaneous penile erection (13% [8/64]). No 
prolonged penile erections (important potential risk of setmelanotide) were reported. 
In the BBS/AS population, 3% (2/64) experienced at least 1 TEAE representative of a depression. 
There was 1 patient with suicidal ideation, however no apparent drug-related increase in suicidality or 
depression as measured by the C-SSRS and the PHQ-9 were reported. In the “all population” updated 
analyses, depression (important potential risk of setmelanotide) was reported in a total of 22 
setmelanotide-treated patients (4%). Suicidal ideation was reported in a total of 5 (1%) 
setmelanotide-treated patients. In 4 patients, the suicidal ideation during treatment occurred in 
conjunction with depression, and for 2 patients it was considered serious but non-treatment-related by 
the investigator. The current SmPC includes a warning to monitor each medical visit for any depressive 
symptoms and consider discontinuing treatment if patients experience suicidal thoughts or behaviours. 
This is considered sufficient to manage this important potential risk of setmelanotide. 
ISRs were reported more frequently in BBS and AS patients (64% [41/64]) than in the “all population” 
original (l 39% [184/476] and updated (46% [260/561]) analyses but much less frequently than in 
POMC and LEPR deficiency populations (89% [31/35]) and appeared to be related to the injection 
and/or excipients rather than to setmelanotide as more placebo-treated patients (77% [20/26])  
reported ISRs than setmelanotide-treated patients in the BBS and AS population. The safety profile for 
ISRs remain consistent with the one observed during the initial marketing evaluation. 
Hypertension and blood pressure increased were reported more frequently in BBS and AS patients (8% 
[5/64]) than in the “all population” original ( 1% [6/476]), updated ( 2% [12/561]) analyses and than 
in POMC and LEPR deficiency populations (3% [1/35]). For the 5 patients, 3 with hypertension and 2 
with BP increased, the event was assessed by the Investigator as setmelanotide-related. Nevertheless, 
in the BBS/AS population as compared to placebo over 14 weeks there was no evidence of a difference 
between placebo or active therapy for both systolic and diastolic BP and thus the addition of 
hypertension as an ADR is not warranted at the present time. 
In BBS and AS patients, the incidence of nausea (33% [21/64]) was consistent with  the “all- 
population”original (33% [157/476]), updated (35% [198/561]) and was much lower than in 
Assessment report  
EMA/677091/2022 
Page 94/99 
 
 
 
 
POMC/LEPR deficiency patients (57% [20/35]). The incidence of vomiting (28% [18/64]) was however 
much higher than in “all- population” original (12% [59/476]), updated (15% [86/561]) but similar to 
the one observed in the POMC/LEPR deficiency population (29% [10/35]). Given the initial doses in the 
pivotal study for BBS and AS patients were twice as high as those in the pivotal study for POMC/LEPR 
deficiency patients, these observations do not raise a particular concern, nausea and vomiting are 
listed ADRs in the current SmPC of setmelanotide .  
Many of the most common TEAEs (>10%) in the updated “all-patients population” analysis were 
reported much more frequently in the paediatric population (especially 6-< 12 years old) than in the 
adult population, some however are expected to occur more frequently in general in children (e.g. 
cough, pharyngitis streptococcal, nasopharyngitis).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Given data are collected from multiple studies with different study designs and in different patient 
populations including healthy volunteers, firm conclusions on observed differences between adult and 
paediatric population are difficult to draw due to the relatively small number of events. At the present 
time, the safety profile in the paediatric population is not considered to be different to that in adult 
patients. 
The clinical safety data set is limited leading to a number of uncertainties: the number of patients 
treated in the intended indication is small so it is unlikely to detect rarer adverse reactions, and there 
is a need for longer-term data to detect adverse reactions associated with prolonged or cumulative 
exposure. In addition, the paediatric safety data was very limited especially in regard to children 6 11 
years old. 
The pivotal study had a short placebo controlled period, in a patient population with several 
comorbidities. This made it challenging to determine the causal relationship to the treatment. 
Existing uncertainties from the initial evaluation remain i.e. effect of long-term or cumulative use of 
setmelanotide on hyperpigmentation is not known; the risk of prolonged penile erections (>4 hours) as 
up until now is not fully characterised, depression is a potential risk and the clinical impact of ADAs is 
unknown as more data are expected and the suitability of the assays is yet to be confirmed.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Setmelanotide is a MC4R agonist with the potential to restore lost activity in the MC4R pathway aiming 
at re-establishing weight and appetite control in patients with POMC and LEPR obesity. BBS is a 
primary ciliopathy which is believed to play a role in impaired transport of the leptin receptor (LEPR) to

the ciliary membrane of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the 
hypothalamus. As reported by the MAH, the exact mechanism of how this ciliopathy is interacting with 
the MC4R pathway is currently unknown, the MAH however claimed that based on animal model 
observations and limited human data it is strongly believed that in BBS, it is the leptin receptor which 
loses some degree of functionality, ultimately believed to culminate in deficient α-MSH signalling 
further downstream and thus setmelanotide could function as a replacement α-MSH analogue to take 
over or at least aid in this deficient signalling step. There are no pharmacological treatment options for 
the patient populations and there is a substantial medical need. 
Despite  meeting  the  prespecified  primary  and  key  secondary  objectives,  the  overall  outcomes  in  the 
pivotal RM-493-023, only 32.3% of patients attained the primary endpoint with a mean weight loss of 
5.9 kg versus baseline (median loss = 4.37 kg) at Week 52 and a mean weight loss of 3.06 kg, which 
was not statistically different from  the placebo  group,  versus baseline at Week 14. Notably,  the MAH 
opted for a pivotal trial design that differs entirely from the design as used in the POMC/LEPR/PCKS1-
deficiency studies which formed the basis for the initial marketing authorisation. In addition, a number 
of deviations from the CHMP Scientific Advice were identified in the choice of design (population, duration 
of  placebo  controlled  period,  hierarchy  of  endpoints)  as  well  as  some  other  limitations  in  the  chosen 
design  (use  of  different  ATB  sampling  points  and  adjustment  through  imputation  techniques).  These 
resulted in heterogeneity in the results and efficacy uncertainties in the trial population including mixed 
BBS/AS  populations.  To  address  these  efficacy  uncertainties,  an  ad-hoc  sensitivity  analysis  was 
performed  on  the  primary  (PE)  and  key  secondary  endpoints  (KSE),  using  the  actual  Week  52  data, 
instead of imputed ones, of all pivotal BBS patients and confirmed the clinical relevance of the magnitude 
of  the  effect  in  BBS  patients.  More  patients  (43%)  met  the  conservative  primary  endpoint  of  >10% 
weight  loss,  and  mean/median  losses  in  bodyweight  versus  baseline  were  improved  to  -9/-8  kg 
(equivalent to mean/median  7.9/6.2% change versus baseline).  Only very few  pivotal patients below 
the age of 12 were included in the trial, nevertheless positive effects on BMI-Z scores were seen and 
there did not seem to be any indication that efficacy or safety in this group (6-11 years) differs essentially 
from the other age groups. 
Forty-two (42) BBS patients had transitioned from trials RM-493-023 and -014 with a median of 86 
weeks QD setmelanotide treatment at the time of the database lock. Overall, the trends seen indicate 
that the weight loss achieved in the index studies was maintained during the extension follow-up. 
However long term data are still limited. Of the BBS/AS population, 49 patients have been treated for 
at least 6 months, 39 have been treated for at least 1 year and 21 for at least 18 months which is a 
larger sample size than for POMC/LEPR deficiency patients used to support the initial approval.  
Given the expected life-long nature of the treatment, the proposed pharmacovigilance plan to extend 
the follow-up to BBS patients in the planned registry (PASS) is agreed upon. 
Based on the new safety data generated in BBS/AS populations and other populations, the overall 
safety profile of setmelanotide remain consistent, although frequencies of some existing ADRs have 
been updated in the SmPC and new ADRs have also been added. Existing uncertainties from the initial 
evaluation remain  and the agreed PASS will thus be extended to BBS patients to monitor the long 
term safety and other important potential risks and missing information. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the favourable outcomes, both in a statistical and clinically relevant sense, on body weight and 
hunger suppression in the ultra-rare condition of BBS are promising for a patient population that until 
now suffers from a high unmet medical need due to the absence of an effective durable treatment for 
their condition. Although the same potential risks are identified as those in POMC/PCSK1/LEPRS

deficiency obesity, these are not considered to outweigh the benefits of Setmelanotide in the proposed 
indication.

The overall B/R of Imcivree for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with

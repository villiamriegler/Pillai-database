Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for aflibercept (indicated for wet 
macular degeneration and CRVO), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During the post-marketing period, reports of hypersensitivity reactions included rash, pruritus, 
urticaria, and isolated cases of severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. Cases described included 
positive rechallenged, close temporal relationship to the administration of aflibercept and lack of 
alternative explanations. The PRAC considered that based on evidence during post-marketing period 
that there is a confirmed causal association between aflibercept and the above mentioned 
hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC 
considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing aflibercept were 
warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for aflibercept (indicated for wet macular degeneration and 
CRVO) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing 
aflibercept (indicated for wet macular degeneration and CRVO) is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

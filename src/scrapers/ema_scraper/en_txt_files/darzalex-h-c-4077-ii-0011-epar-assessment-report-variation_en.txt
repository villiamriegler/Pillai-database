2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple myeloma, a malignant disorder of plasma cells, is characterized by uncontrolled and progressive 
proliferation of a plasma cell clone. The proliferation of myeloma cells causes displacement of the normal 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018 
Page 6/89 
 
  
  
 
bone marrow leading to dysfunction in normal hematopoietic tissue and destruction of the normal bone 
marrow architecture, resulting in progressive morbidity and eventual mortality. 
At the time of diagnosis of multiple myeloma, patients are categorized into 2 subpopulations according to 
co-morbidity, whether suitable for intensive treatment or not. For patients who are considered fit, an 
induction regimen followed by high dose chemotherapy (HDT) and ASCT is considered the standard of care 
according to both US (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]; (Kumar 2017) and European 
(European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO]; (Moreau 2017) guidelines.  For patients considered 
ineligible for HDT and ASCT due to presence of comorbidities, older age, and/or physical status, the 
treatment approach often favors longer, less intensive/toxic treatments.  
The coexistence of different tumor subclones at baseline displaying different drug sensitivities ultimately 
contributes to the development of drug resistance and disease progression. Because combination regimens 
comprised of agents with non-overlapping and synergistic MoAs target multiple pathways in multiple 
myeloma cells, they are more likely to overcome intratumoral clonal heterogeneity than single-agent or 
doublet approaches. Thus, triple or quadruple drug regimens have become standard of care treatment for 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.   
The combination of bortezomib plus melphalan plus prednisone (VMP) is the only Velcade -containing triplet 
regimen approved in the US and Europe for frontline therapy in patients ineligible for transplant. The 
combination of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd) is also approved for use in this population in Europe 
and the US.  
Despite these approved regimens, there remains an unmet need for new therapeutic options for the frontline 
setting directed at alternative MoAs that can better control the disease and provide deeper, more sustained 
responses and better long-term outcomes, including maintenance of HRQoL. 
Daratumumab is a targeted immunotherapy that binds with high affinity to tumor cells that overexpress 
CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein, on multiple myeloma plasma cells. Multiple mechanisms of action 
(MoA) have been observed for daratumumab, including complement dependent cytotoxicity, antibody 
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis, and direct cytotoxicity by 
induction of apoptosis by Fc gamma receptor mediated crosslinking of tumor-bound monoclonal antibodies. 
Daratumumab leads to the elimination of highly immunosuppressive subsets of CD38+ regulatory T cells, 
CD38+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and CD38+ regulatory B cells (Krejcik 2016). The elimination of 
these immunosuppressive cells and modulation of CD38 enzymatic activity leads to the increased clonal 
expansion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Together, daratumumab’s cytotoxic and immunomodulatory MoAs are 
hypothesized to synergistically result in the deep anti-myeloma responses observed in patients.  
Support for combining daratumumab with VMP is based on results of an ex vivo flow cytometry-based assay 
in which daratumumab in combination with VMP significantly enhanced the anti-tumor treatment effect by 
almost doubling the cell lysis levels in bone marrow mononuclear cell isolates obtained from subjects with 
multiple myeloma. Daratumumab’s cell- and complement-mediated (and potentially direct) cytotoxic effects 
against multiple myeloma cells, combined with the observed synergy with bortezomib (also in samples from 
patients refractory to bortezomib), may potentially improve the clinical outcome for patients with multiple 
myeloma when combined with a bortezomib-based combination regimen. 
The current submission supporting the approval of daratumumab for the treatment of patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for ASCT is based on data from the Phase 3 study, MMY3007 
(clinical cut-off, 12 June 2017), comparing daratumumab 16 mg/kg administered in combination with VMP 
to VMP alone. In addition to data from MMY3007, supportive data from a single cohort of 12 subjects with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ineligible for transplant who were administered D-VMP as part of a 
Phase 1b study (MMY1001) are described briefly in this Clinical Overview 
The following indication is proposed:

Page 7/89 
 
  
  
DARZALEX is indicated in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the treatment of adult 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. 
The recommended dose is 16 mg/kg body weight administered as an intravenous infusion as per the 
following schedule:

Bortezomib is given twice weekly at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for the first 6-week cycle, followed by once weekly 
at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 5 for eight more 6-week cycles. For information on the VMP dose and dosing schedule 
when administered with DARZALEX, see section 5.1. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are unlikely to 
result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no Environmental Risk Assessment for 
daratumumab is required. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The MAH has provided a statement that all clinical trials conducted within or outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology of daratumumab has been well characterised and summarised in the initial 
monotherapy submission. Further, the clinical pharmacology properties of daratumumab in combination 
treatment with other agents than the Bortezomib-Melphalan-Prednisone (D-VMP) combination were studied 
in 680 subjects in two Phase 1/2 and two Phase 3 combination studies. An overview of the 2 studies which 
support the present submission are provided in Table 2. In both of these studies, daratumumab was 
administered at 16 mg/kg in combination with a background regimen of VMP.  
Data from the initial mono- and combination-treatment studies as well as studies 3007 and 1001 and a 
population PK (Pop-PK) analysis based on these two studies support the PK data of the present application.

Absorption, Distribution and Elimination 
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics of daratumumab are based on PK 
analysis  of  full  PK  profiles  available  in  monotherapy  dosing  and  detailed  in  the  initial  submission.  These 
characteristics are summarised below. 
Absorption 
Absorption  data  are  not  available  because  all  studies  in  this  and  prior  submissions  administered 
daratumumab as an IV infusion. Bioavailability is per definition 100%. 
Distribution 
Typical IgG1-based monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are primarily confined to the vascular system (Mascelli 
2007). The mean±SD volumen of distribution (Vd) in subjects who received daratumumab 16 mg/kg was 
90.19±43.40 mL/kg after the first dose and 59.51±54.68 mL/kg following repeat dosing (Study GEN501, 
monotherapy).  As  described  by  the  monotherapy  Pop-PK  model,  the  estimate  for  the  central  volume  of 
distribution  is  56.98±18.07  mL/kg.  Traditional  protein-binding  studies  using  human  serum  albumin  as 
conducted for small molecules are not applicable to therapeutic biologics (ICH S6 1997). 
Elimination (Metabolism and Excretion) 
As  an  IgG1κ  mAb,  daratumumab  is  presumably  biotransformed  in  the  same  manner  as  any  other 
endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways) and is subject to 
similar elimination (Mascelli 2007; Tabrizi 2006). Renal excretion and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism 
of intact daratumumab are therefore unlikely to represent major elimination routes. As such, variations in 
renal and hepatic function are not expected to affect the elimination of daratumumab. 
As shown previously in the monotherapy studies, daratumumab clearance decreased with increasing doses 
and with multiple doses. After the first full infusion, mean clearance decreased from 1.06 mL/h/kg in the 2 
mg/kg group to 0.29 mL/h/kg in the 24 mg/kg group; after repeat dosing, clearance decreased from 0.59 
mL/h/kg  (n=1)  in  the  2  mg/kg  group  to  0.16  mL/h/kg  in  the  24  mg/kg  group  (Study  GEN501, 
monotherapy).  Following  the  first  administration  at  the  approved  dose  of  16  mg/kg,  clearance  was 
0.42±0.42 mL/h/kg and T½ was 216.06±104.04 hours (9.0±4.3 days). Following repeated administration 
of  16  mg/kg,  daratumumab  clearance  decreased  to  0.30±0.12  mL/h/kg  and  T½  increased  to 
255.29±216.47 hours (10.6±9.0 days) (Study GEN501, monotherapy). 
Preinfusion  and  postinfusion  concentrations  were  measured  in  Study  MMY3007  (342  patients)  and  a 
summary of the daratumumab pre-infusion and post-infusion concentrations in serum is presented in Table 
3,  and  the  mean  daratumumab  peak    and  trough    concentrations  are  presented  in  Figure  2.  The  peak 
concentration at the end of the first dose was 266.7±86.9 μg/mL. On Cycle 3 Day 1, the day of the ninth 
overall dose of daratumumab and the start of the second cycle of every-3-week-dosing, the predose trough 
concentration  was  272.5±154.9  μg/mL  and  Cmax  postinfusion  was  595.9±204.5  μg/mL.  Daratumumab 
concentrations observed after 3 additional cycles of every 3 week-dosing (Cycle 6 Day 1) were similar to the 
Cycle  3  Day  1  values,  with  mean±SD  trough  and  peak  concentrations  of  297.2±145.8  μg/mL  and 
636.4±215.9 μg/mL, respectively.

Descriptive statistics for serum daratumumab concentrations by time-point in Study MMY1001 (11 patients) 
are presented in Table 4. The mean±SD daratumumab concentration at the end of the first dose was 
332.2±57.1 μg/mL. Accumulation of daratumumab continued during weekly dosing until Cycle 2 Day 1, 
when the mean (SD) predose and postdose concentrations reached 588.0±161.4 and 936.0±225.1 μg/mL, 
respectively. Mean Cmax following the Cycle 2 Day 1 dose was 2.8-fold higher than the Cmax following the 
first dose. Mean concentrations began to decrease slightly following less frequent daratumumab 
administration starting in Cycle 2.

Comparison and Analyses of Results Across Studies 
Following the first dose of 16 mg/kg of daratumumab in combination studies of D-VMP, the mean end of 
infusion concentrations were 266.72 and 332.16 μg/mL for Study MMY3007 and the D-VMP cohort of Study 
MMY1001, respectively. These results were similar to the mean end of infusion concentration following the 
first monotherapy dose, which was reported as 312.54 μg/mL. 
When  co-administered  with  VMP,  daratumumab  serum  concentrations  accumulated  after  weekly 
administration  in  a  similar  way  compared  with  daratumumab  monotherapy  and  decrease  slightly  during 
subsequent less frequent dosing periods. The mean concentration of daratumumab after 6 weekly 16-mg/kg 
doses (ie, Cycle 2 Day 1 predose) was 587.97 μg/mL in Study MMY1001, which was a 2.8-fold increase in 
daratumumab peak concentration at the end of 6 weekly doses when compared with the first dose (Study 
MMY1001).  These  results  were  similar  to  the  mean  trough  concentration  after  8  weekly  doses  in  the 
monotherapy study MMY2002 (573.49 μg/mL), with a 2.9-fold increase in daratumumab peak concentration 
at the end of 8 weekly doses when compared with the first dose. 
Dose proportionality, time dependencies and inter-subject variability 
Daratumumab  elimination  showed  nonlinear  characteristics:  elimination  T½  increased  with  dose  while 
clearance decreased with increasing dose. Clearance also decreased with multiple doses. 
Dose Proportionality 
Daratumumab elimination showed nonlinear characteristics in the monotherapy studies. Following the first 
administration of daratumumab ranging from 0.005 to 24 mg/kg, Cmax increased in approximate proportion 
to daratumumab dose for doses of at least 1 mg/kg. After repeat dosing, Cmax increased in a greater than 
dose-proportional manner. AUC also increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner after both the 
first and last dose. Consistent with the monotherapy data, in Study GEN503, Cmax following the first full 
infusion  increased  in  approximate  proportion  to  the  increasing  daratumumab  dose  of  2  to  16  mg/kg 
daratumumab and AUClast increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner after the first dose.

As reported for monotherapy, also in the initial combination treatment study (GEN503), mean clearance 
following the first dose decreased with increasing dose, from 1.5±1.1 mL/h/kg in the 1 mg/kg cohort to 
0.3±0.2 mL/h/kg in the 24 mg/kg cohort. This trend for decreasing clearance with increased dose was also 
evident following repeat dosing, from 6.7±6.2 mL/h/kg in the 0.5-mg/kg cohort to 0.2±0.1 mL/h/kg in the 
24  mg/kg  cohort.  Following  the  first  administration  at  the  approved  dose  of  16  mg/kg,  clearance  was 
0.3±0.1 mL/h/kg and 0.1 mL/h/kg in the 1 subject with the parameter estimated after repeat dosing. Due 
to the evident nonlinear PK, statistical assessment of dose proportionality was not performed. 
Time Dependency 
Clearance of daratumumab in study GEN503 also decreased with multiple doses in the monotherapy studies: 
after the first full infusion, mean clearance decreased from 1.1 mL/h/kg in the 2 mg/kg group to 0.3 mL/h/kg 
in the 24 mg/kg group; after the last full infusion, mean clearance decreased from 0.6 mL/h/kg in the 2 
mg/kg group to 0.2 mL/h/kg in the 24 mg/kg group. Following the first administration at the approved dose 
of  16  mg/kg,  clearance  was  0.3±0.1  mL/h/kg  (mean±SD)  and  0.1  mL/h/kg  in  the  1  subject  with  the 
parameter estimated after repeat dosing. The trend of decreasing clearance with repeated dosing was also 
evident in Part 2 of Study GEN501 and Study MMY1002. 
Inter-subject variability 
In Study MMY3007, inter-subject variability for daratumumab exposure appeared moderate, with a 33% to 
34% coefficient of variation for post-infusion concentrations.  
Special populations 
See under population-PK analysis section. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies   
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed, and no interactions of daratumumab and small 
molecule drugs such as bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone are expected as there is no overlapping 
pathway of elimination. As reported in a previous submission, analysis of daratumumab and bortezomib 
concentrations from Study MMY1001 indicated a lack of clinically relevant drug-drug interaction between 
these molecules. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Methods for Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A  Population  Pharmacokinetic  (PPK)  model  of  daratumumab  was  developed  to  describe  the  PK 
characteristics of daratumumab in combination with VMP and to evaluate the influence of covariates on the 
disposition  of  daratumumab  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  who  are  ineligible  for 
autologous stem cell transplant. In addition, PK of daratumumab combined with VMP was compared with 
that of daratumumab monotherapy studies and the previous combination therapy studies. 
The PPK analysis included combined data from a Phase 3 study (MMY3007) and the D-VMP combination arm 
of a Phase 1b (MMY1001). Serum concentration-time data of daratumumab were used for nonlinear mixed 
effects modelling using NONMEM® (ICON plc, Version 7.3).  
The  first-order  conditional  estimation  with  the  INTERACTION  method  was  used.  Due  to  the  lack  of 
overlapping  clearance  mechanism  for  daratumumab  and  co-administered  small-molecule  combination 
therapies, no direct impact of the combination therapies on the PK of daratumumab is expected. Therefore, 
the  previously  developed  base  and  final  PPK  models  were  used  to  fit  the  concentration-time  data  of 
daratumumab. To compare the effects of covariates on exposure to daratumumab, subgroup analyses were

conducted on predicted exposure metrics derived from simulation of daratumumab PK profiles based on 
empirical Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters. 
Intrinsic and extrinsic Factors 
Body weight, age, sex, race, renal impairment, baseline albumin, hepatic dysfunction categories using the 
National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  criteria  (based  on  aspartate  aminotransferase  [AST]  and  total  bilirubin 
[TB]), and type of myeloma at baseline (IgG  versus non-IgG)  were considered as intrinsic factors to be 
examined for their potential impact on PK of daratumumab. Region of subject enrollment was evaluated as 
an  extrinsic  factor  in  the  PPK  analysis  and  Exposure  to  daratumumab  compared  between  subgroups  for 
baseline disease status (ie, ECOG status at baseline) was evaluated as ‘Other factors’.  
Cox proportional hazard regression models, implemented in the “survival” package in R (Therneau 2000), 
were used to explore the relationship between exposure metrics and the relative hazard of progression or 
death using P-splines. The control group in Study MMY3007 was used as the reference level to calculate the 
relative hazard. 
In addition, a matched case-control analysis was conducted to assess the influence of potential imbalances 
of risk factors among subjects with different exposure quantiles (Yang 2013). The potential of unbalanced 
distribution of identified covariates (risk factors) among different exposure quantile was examined. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PPK analysis was based on 1,635 PK samples from 352 PPK-evaluable subjects with at least 1 evaluable 
(concentration above the lower limit of quantification) postdose sample. The observed concentration time 
data of daratumumab were adequately described by a 2-compartment PPK model with parallel linear and 
nonlinear  Michaelis-Menten  eliminations.  The  model  was  parameterised  in  terms  of  non-specific  linear 
clearance (CL), volume of distribution in the central compartment (V1), inter-compartmental clearance (Q), 
volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment (V2), maximum rate of the saturable target-mediated 
drug disposition clearance process (Vmax), and daratumumab concentration (Km) associated with half of 
Vmax. The estimated CL value was similar to the clearance of non-specific endogenous IgG reported in the 
literature,  and  the  estimated  V1  value  approached  plasma  volume.  The  ratio  of  the  steady-state  peak 
concentration  after every  4  week  dosing  and  the  peak  concentration  after  the  first  dose  was  2.06±0.61 
(mean±SD). 
Effects of Covariates 
A forest plot was constructed to compare the exposure (maximal trough concentration) of daratumumab in 
subgroups defined by specific covariates.

Body Weight: When daratumumab was administered on a mg/kg basis, no clinically important differences 
(ie, ≤15%) in the exposure to daratumumab were observed in subjects with a low (<65 kg, n=120) or high 
(>85 kg, n=59) body weight compared to those with a normal body weight (65 to 85 kg, n=172). The CL and 
V1  of  daratumumab  significantly  increased  with  increasing  body  weight.  The  difference  in  exposure  had 
minimal impact on target saturation. 
Age: No clinically important influence of age on the exposure to daratumumab was observed. The difference 
in exposure was within 15% between younger (age <65 years, n=36) and older subjects (65 years ≤ age 
<75 years, n=214; and age ≥75 years, n=102). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018 
Page 17/89 
 
  
  
 
 
Sex: No clinically important influence of sex on the exposure to daratumumab was observed. The difference 
in  exposure  was  approximately  9%  between  males  (n=163)  and  females  (n=189),  although  V1  of 
daratumumab in female subjects was approximately 13% lower than that of male subjects. 
Race:  Because  85%  of  subjects  were  White  and  there  were  only  limited  sample  sizes  in  other  race 
categories, the effect of race was evaluated as White (n=301) and Non-white (n=51). No clinically important 
influence  of  race  on  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  was  observed.  The  difference  in  exposure  was 
approximately 9% between White and Non-white subjects. 
Region:  The  majority  (83%)  of  subjects  were  from  the  European  Union  (EU).  The  effect  of  region  was 
evaluated in EU (n=293) and Other (n=59). The difference in exposure was approximately 9% between EU 
and Other. 
Renal  Impairment:  As  only  2  subjects  had  severe  renal  impairment  (creatinine  clearance  [CRCL]  <30 
mL/min), they were combined with subjects with moderate renal impairment (30≤ CRCL <60 mL/min) in 
this analysis. The effect of renal impairment was evaluated in categories of normal renal function (CRCL ≥90 
mL/min,  n=62),  mild  renal  impairment  (60≤  CRCL  <90  mL/min,  n=142),  and  moderate/severe  renal 
impairment  (n=147).  No  clinically  important  differences  (≤18%)  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  were 
observed between subjects with renal impairment and those with normal renal function. 
Hepatic Impairment: As only 2 subjects had moderate hepatic impairment (TB >1.5× to 3.0× upper limit of 
normal [ULN] as defined using the NCI criteria of hepatic dysfunction) and no subjects had severe hepatic 
impairment (TB >3× ULN and any AST), the 2 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment were combined 
with subjects with mild hepatic impairment (TB 1.0× to 1.5× ULN or AST >ULN) in this analysis. The effect 
of hepatic impairment was evaluated in categories of normal hepatic function (TB and AST ≤ULN, n=304) 
and  mild/moderate  hepatic  impairment  (n=45).  The  exposures  in  subjects  with  mild/moderate  hepatic 
impairment were similar with subjects who had normal hepatic function and consistent with the findings 
based  on  previous  studies.  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  were 
observed between subjects with hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function as found in the 
monotherapy or the previous combination therapy study populations. 
Baseline  Albumin:  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  were  observed 
between  subjects  with  abnormal  (low)  albumin  and  those  with  normal  albumin  level.  The  exposure  to 
daratumumab was 20% lower in subjects with abnormal (low) albumin level (<35 g/L; n=143) compared 
with subjects who had normal albumin level (≥35 g/L; n=209). The difference in exposure had minimal 
impact on target saturation. 
Type  of  Myeloma:  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  were  observed 
between  subjects  with  IgG  myeloma  and  non-IgG  myeloma.  The  exposure  to  daratumumab  was 
approximately 20% lower in the IgG multiple myeloma subjects (n=225) compared to the non-IgG subjects 
(n=127). The difference in exposure had minimal impact on target saturation.  
Immunogenicity: No immunogenicity-evaluable subjects (n=119) in the PPK analysis were positive for ADA 
to daratumumab. 
ECOG Score: No clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab (≤7%) were observed 
between subjects with ECOG scores of 1 (n=181) or 2 (n=88) and those with ECOG scores of 0 (n=83). 
Similar to what was observed in data from previous studies of monotherapy, apparent steady state seems to 
be reached at approximately 5 months. The ratio of the steady-state peak after every 4 week dosing and the 
peak  after  the  first  dose  was  2.06±0.61  (mean±SD).  Target  saturation  >90%  is  maintained  at  trough 
concentrations in the majority (>99%) of the subjects following the every 4 week dose regimen.

Figure 3 
Comparison of PK between D-VMP Combination and Previous Monotherapy and Combination Therapies: 
In  general,  the  maximal  trough  concentration  of  daratumumab  was  similar  following  the  D-VMP  dose 
regimen and the approved dose regimen (16 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks followed by every 2 weeks for 16 
weeks,  then  every  4  weeks  thereafter)  in  previous  monotherapy  and  combination  therapy  studies.  The 
model-derived T½ associated with the CL of daratumumab was approximately 22.1±9.7 (mean±SD) days, 
comparable  to  the  T½  of  18±9  (mean±SD)  days  derived  from  the  monotherapy  data  and  the  T½  of 
23.3±11.8 (mean±SD) days derived from previous combination therapies. Similar to what was observed in 
previous studies, apparent steady state seemed to be reached at approximately 5 months. The covariate 
effects estimated based on the Phase 3 study MMY3007 were similar to those estimated in the previous 
model based on the monotherapy studies or the previous combination therapy studies. Consistent with the 
findings in previous studies, none of the investigated intrinsic and extrinsic factors had clinically important 
effects on the exposure to daratumumab as all the covariate effects were within approximately 20% with 
minimal  impact  on  target  saturation  due  to  the  estimated  small  binding  affinity  (Km=0.93  μg/mL). 
Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended based on these factors. 
Exploratory  Exposure-Response  Relationships:  Exposure-Response  (E-R)  relationships  were  investigated 
based on the data from Study MMY3007. Since all subjects in MMY3007 (daratumumab group) received the 
recommended dose of 16 mg/kg, there is limited exposure variation to evaluate the E-R relationship and, 
therefore, only exploratory and graphic E-R analyses were performed for selected efficacy endpoints and 
AEs.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Daratumumab is a human IgG mAb immunotherapy that binds with high affinity to CD38, a transmembrane 
glycoprotein expressed on tumour cells, and induces tumour cell death through multiple mechanisms of 
action. These mechanisms of action include several immune-mediated activities, including 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular 
phagocytosis, and direct cytotoxicity by induction of apoptosis by Fc gamma receptor mediated crosslinking 
of tumour-bound mAbs (Overdijk 2016). Translational biomarker studies of samples from subjects treated 
with daratumumab in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (Studies GEN501 and MMY2002, respectively) have 
revealed immunomodulatory effects of daratumumab (Krejcik 2016). Daratumumab leads to the rapid and 
sustained elimination of highly immunosuppressive subsets of CD38+ regulatory T cells, CD38+ 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and CD38+ regulatory B cells (Krejcik 2016). The elimination of these 
immunosuppressive cells, modulation of CD38 enzymatic activity, and destruction of the malignant 
myeloma cells are thought to lead to the clonal expansion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Chiu 2016). 
Altogether, daratumumab’s converging mechanisms of actions are hypothesised to synergistically lead to 
the deep responses observed in patients. A summary of daratumumab’s novel, converging mechanism of 
action is presented in Figure 1.

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic assessments were not included in Studies MMY3007 and MMY1001 (D-VMP arm). 
The monotherapy submission and the RRMM submission reported decreases in NK cells in peripheral blood 
and bone marrow following treatment with daratumumab monotherapy and in combination with other 
treatment regimens. No new PD data are available.

Immunogenicity 
A  summary  of  anti-daratumumab  antibody  status  for  Study  MMY3007  and  the  D-VMP  cohort  of  Study 
MMY1001 are shown in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively. Of the 119 subjects (including 6 subjects from 
Study  MMY1001)  who  were  treated  with  D-VMP  and  had  samples  appropriate  for  immunogenicity 
evaluation, 0 (0%) were positive for anti-daratumumab antibodies. 
In  monotherapy  studies,  none  (0%)  of  the  199  subjects  evaluable  for  immunogenicity  were  positive  for 
antibodies to daratumumab. In the 4 combination studies in the RRMM submission, 2 (0.7%) of the 298 
evaluable subjects (including the 6 subjects in the MMY1001 D-VMP cohort) were positive for antibodies to 
daratumumab. These results consistently indicate a low risk of immunogenicity with daratumumab. 
QTc Evaluation 
The  evaluation  of  QTc  intervals  versus  serum  concentrations  of  daratumumab  has  been  provided  in  the 
monotherapy  submission  and  revealed  that  daratumumab  has  no  effect  on  electrocardiographic  (ECG) 
parameters.  No  additional  ECG  interval  data  for  analysis  of  QT  were  collected  in  Studies  MMY3007  or 
MMY1001 (D-VMP cohort). 
Neutralising Anti-daratumumab Antibodies 
No patients treated D-VMP in Study MMY3007 or in the D-VMP cohort of Study MMY1001 at the time of the 
cut-off were positive for anti-daratumumab antibodies; therefore, the presence of neutralising antibodies 
was not assessed. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
See Results from the population PK analyses presented above. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK profile for daratumumab when given in combination treatment seems to show similar pattern to what 
has been observed in in the monotherapy studies. Steady state is reached after approximately 21 weeks (≈5 
months) and mean trough concentrations were 375-615 μg/mL. After approximately 1 year, the mean 
trough concentrations dropped to approximately 250-525 μg/mL. The MAH informs that target saturation 
>90% is maintained at trough concentrations in the majority (>99%) of the patients following the every 4 
week dose regimen. However, in the Exploratory-Response (E-R) analysis, a potential confounding between 
post-treatment drug effects and maximal trough concentration was observed in the D-VMP treated newly 
diagnosed MM subjects. This potential confounding effect has not been observed in previous E-R analyses in 
monotherapy or in previous authorised combinations. The MAH pointed out the fact of being D-VMP 
population included in the current analysis a first line treatment population as the potential reason. The 
populations included in the previous submissions were exposed to at least 1 prior line of multiple myeloma 
treatment and there is a potential that the prior treatments made this relationship less apparent in those 
exposure-response analyses. Additionally, the MAH plans to continue to monitor this confounding in future 
studies for untreated patients with multiple myeloma. This is considered acceptable. The MAH clarified the 
range of exposure cover by every quartile in the Kaplan-Meier Curves (Progression-free survival) in the E-R 
analysis of the combination D-VMP 
A logistic regression analysis of overall response rate and predicted maximal pre-infusion (trough) 
daratumumab concentration showed by the initial (monotherapy) PK analysis, that maximal response rate 
was obtained with daratumumab concentrations around 300 µg/mL and no additional effect was obtained 
with higher concentrations. The MAH calculated that 90% of the maximal effect on ORR (
) was 
achieved when Cpre-infusion,max was 274 µg/mL. From the present data presented in Figure 3, it appears 
that mean trough concentrations are well above the thresholds of 274 µg/mL and 300 µg/mL during the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018 
Page 21/89 
 
  
  
initial 4 weeks’ dosing period the first 52 weeks, but thereafter pre-infusion values appear to be slightly 
lower than the thresholds. Mean concentrations are however well above both thresholds at all time points. 
Thus, when comparing results from the present combination studies (MMY3007 and MMY1001) with the 
results from the monotherapy studies, similar mean concentrations after first dose and similar pattern for 
the subsequent cycles are observed. Therefore, it is concluded that the PK data from the two studies 
including patients treated with the D-VMP combination seems to be comparable with the data reported from 
the monotherapy studies. This may support the assumption (based on molecular structures of the agents) 
that there are no interactions with the combination treatment, and it justifies the use of PK-data from the 
previous registration studies with daratumumab.  
The PPK analysis was based on 1,635 PK samples from 353 PK-evaluable patients (all receiving 
daratumumab at 16 mg/kg). Several covariates were investigated in the PPK analysis. Consistent with the 
results from the initial (mono- and combination-therapy) PPK analyses, results from the present PPK 
analysis show that albumin level, type of myeloma and body weight were the covariates with the highest 
impact on the PK values. Further, in the present analysis, (numeric) differences were also observed for 
gender and renal function. As there is no reason to believe that the gender and/or renal function should 
influence the PK of daratumumab when used in the D-VMP combination treatment, these findings are mostly 
expected to be a random finding.  Nonetheless, for a proper comparison of estimates CL between the 
previous submitted PPK models and the current one, the MAH was asked to discuss this further. The MAH  
discussed the relevance of deleting covariate FORM in the previous submitted PPK models. Covariate FORM 
was used to evaluate the potential differences in clearance (CL) between Phase 2 pre-change and Phase 3 
post-change drug products. However, only Phase 3 post-change drug product was used in Study MMY3007 
and in the D-VMP arm of Study MMY1001. Therefore, it is not possible to include covariate FORM and 
estimate its effects in this model. Additionally, it was justified that use of covariate FORM is the only reason 
for the differences observed on estimates CL between previous submitted models and table with the 
comparison included in the PPK report submitted with the current variation. Of note, the differences are not 
expected to be of clinical relevance and currently no dose-adjustments are considered necessary. 
With regards to the pharmacodynamics, no new data related to mechanism of action or QTc evaluation are 
presented. This is acceptable; an ongoing trial SMM2001 will investigate further this identified risk (see 
RMP). 
No patients developed anti-daratumumab antibodies, which is assuring. A study aiming to improve the 
immunogenicity method’s ability to detect anti-daratumumab antibodies in the presence of high trough 
levels of daratumumab is ongoing (see RMP). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The new analyses presented do not change the current knowledge on PK/PD and immunogenicity of 
daratumumab.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dedicated dose-response studies were conducted.  
In Study MMY3007, daratumumab was administered at 16 mg/kg as per the daratumumab prescribing 
information, but the dosing schedule was modified to match the 6-week cycle length for VMP: 16 mg/kg IV 
weekly for 6 weeks, then every 3 weeks for 48 weeks (Cycle 2 to 9), and then every 4 weeks thereafter 
(post-VMP Treatment Phase) until documented progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end.

until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons. 
Figure 6: Treatment administration

Daratumumab Administration 
For subjects assigned to Arm B (D-VMP), daratumumab (16 mg/kg) was administered by IV infusion initially 
once every week for 6 weeks (Cycle 1; 1 VELCADE cycle); then once every 3 weeks for an additional 16 
doses (Cycles 2-9); then once every 4 weeks thereafter (post-VMP Treatment Phase), until documented 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. The daratumumab dosing schedule was minimally adjusted 
to accommodate the standard VMP 6-week cycle. Each subject’s dose of daratumumab was calculated based 
on the subject’s weight rounded to the nearest kilogram. The dose did not need to be recalculated for weight 
changes that were <10% from baseline. 
For all daratumumab infusions, subjects received pre-infusion and post-infusion medications (as needed) to 
reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions. Details on the toxicity management and guidelines for the 
prevention and management of infusion reactions including pre-infusion medications and post-infusion 
medications are provided in the protocol. Subjects who needed to discontinue treatment with any one 
component of study treatment (bortezomib, melphalan, prednisone, or daratumumab) were permitted to 
continue to receive treatment with the other components of study treatment, as assigned. 
Bortezomib Administration 
For both treatment groups, bortezomib was administered at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 as a SC injection twice 
weekly (Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5) for one 6-week cycle (Cycle 1; 8 doses per cycle) followed by once weekly 
(Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5) administrations for eight 6-week cycles (Cycles 2 to 9; 4 doses per cycle). Dose 
adjustments were to be based on the highest grade of toxicity that was ascribed to bortezomib (Appendix 1). 
The rationale for weekly dosing of bortezomib after Cycle 1 is provided. 
Melphalan and Prednisone Administration 
Melphalan was administered at 9 mg/m2 and prednisone was administered at 60 mg/m2 on Day 1 to 4 of 
each bortezomib cycle. Both melphalan and prednisone were administered orally. For subjects randomized 
to Treatment Arm B, 20mg dexamethasone was substituted for the planned dose of prednisone on Day 1 of 
each cycle. In this setting, dexamethasone was utilized as the treatment dose of steroid for that particular 
day, as well as the required pre-medication prior to daratumumab infusion. Melphalan and prednisone could 
be reduced, or the treatment schedule could be modified for the management of the study treatment-related 
toxicities (Appendix 1). 
Assessment of tumour response and disease progression was conducted in accordance with the 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria. An assessment of MRD was conducted on 
bone marrow samples. Safety evaluations included adverse event monitoring, physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, clinical laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry), vital sign 
measurements, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Blood samples were 
drawn for assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters and immunogenicity. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective

Table 6: Key efficacy endpoints for study MMY3007 
If the primary efficacy endpoint (PFS) was statistically significant, several secondary endpoints would be 
sequentially tested, as indicated inTable 2: ORR, VGPR and CR were calculated using a computerized 
algorithm, according to IMWG response criteria. For the evaluation of MRD by bone marrow aspirate, the 
threshold value of 10-5 was used to evaluate MRD negativity status. Relapse from CR by positive 
immunofixation or trace amount of M-protein was not considered to be progressive disease and was not 
included in the PFS calculation. 
Sample size 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018 
Page 27/89 
 
  
  
  
 
The sample size calculation was based on the assumption that the median PFS for the VMP group in this 
study was estimated to be approximately 21 months, and that the addition of daratumumab would reduce 
the risk of the disease progression or death by 27.6%, i.e., assuming the hazard ratio (D-VMP vs VMP) of 
0.724, which translates to a median PFS of 29 months for the D-VMP arm. A total of 360 PFS events would 
be needed to achieve a power of 85% to detect this hazard ratio with a log-rank test (two-sided alpha is 
0.05). With a 20-month accrual period and an additional 21-month follow-up, the total sample size needed 
for the study was approximately 700 (350/treatment group) subjects. The sample size calculation has taken 
into consideration an annual dropout rate of 5%. 
Long-term survival follow-up was to continue until 330 deaths had been observed or 5 years after the last 
subject was randomized, whichever came first. This study was to achieve approximately 80% power to 
detect a 27% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.73) with a logrank test (two-sided alpha=0.05) if 330 
death events were observed at the study end. 
Randomisation 
Central randomization was implemented in this study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups based on a computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study was under the 
supervision of the sponsor. Eligible subjects were stratified by ISS (I, II, or III) at screening (based on 
central laboratory results), region (Europe vs Other), and age (<75 vs≥75), and then randomized to 
treatment in a 1:1 ratio to either Treatment Arm A (VMP alone) or Treatment Arm B (D-VMP). The interactive 
web response system (IWRS) was to assign a unique treatment code, which dictated the treatment 
assignment and matching study treatment for the subject.  
Blinding (masking) 
As this was an open-label study, blinding procedures were not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is PFS. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in PFS 
between the combination D-VMP and VMP alone in subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are 
ineligible for high dose chemotherapy. The secondary endpoints such as TTP, ORR, VGPR or better rate, CR 
or better rate, MRD negativity rate, PFS2, time to response, duration of response and OS will be evaluated 
as well. 
In general, continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median and range. Categorical variables were summarized using frequency and percentage. 
For time-to-event variables, which were defined as from the date of randomization to the date of the event, 
the Kaplan-Meier method was used for descriptive summaries. The primary treatment comparison of the 
distribution of overall PFS will be based on a stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratio and its 95% confidence 
interval were estimated based on a stratified Cox’s regression model with treatment as the sole explanatory 
variable. Stratification factors used in the analyses include ISS staging (I, II, III), region (Europe vs other), 
and age (<75 years vs ≥75 years). 
All statistical hypothesis tests and 95% confidence intervals presented were 2-sided. The primary 
hypothesis is to be tested at the 0.05 significance level (overall).  
If the primary endpoint of PFS is statistically significant, secondary endpoints will be sequentially tested, 
each with an overall two-sided alpha of 0.05, by utilizing a hierarchical testing approach to control Type I 
error rate. The statistical methods used and hierarchical order for the secondary endpoints are listed in Table 
below.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018 
Page 28/89 
 
  
  
Analyses of demographics, baseline characteristics, and efficacy endpoints were primarily analyzed using 
the intent-to-treat population (ITT), defined as subjects who have been randomly assigned to the D-VMP or 
VMP group.  
Table 7: Statistical Methods for Key Efficacy Endpoints. 
Censoring rules for PFS 
PFS is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to either progressive disease, according to the 
IMWG response criteria, or death, whichever occurs first. 
Subjects who start subsequent antimyeloma therapies for multiple myeloma without disease progression 
were censored at the last disease assessment before the start of subsequent therapies. Subjects who 
withdrew consent from the study before disease progression were censored at the last disease assessment. 
Subjects who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last disease assessment before subjects were lost 
to follow-up. Subjects who have not progressed and were still alive at the cutoff date for analysis were 
censored at the last disease assessment. Subjects without any postbaseline disease assessment were 
censored at the randomization. Reasons for censoring were summarized for the ITT population. 
Interim Analyses 
Two interim analyses were planned for this study. The first interim analysis, with a purpose to evaluate 
safety, was performed after a total of approximately 100 subjects have been treated for at least 2 cycles or 
discontinued the study treatment. The second interim analysis was planned to be performed when 216 PFS 
events (60% of the total events) have been accumulated. The purpose of the second interim analysis was to 
evaluate cumulative interim safety and efficacy data. The primary PFS analysis was planned to occur when 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018 
Page 29/89 
 
  
  
 
 
approximately 360 PFS events have been observed if the second interim analysis does not result in an early 
stop due to efficacy or futility. The end of the study will occur when 330 subjects have died, or 5 years after 
the last subject is randomized.  
The exact significance level at the second interim analysis is to be determined by the observed number of 
events per the O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function for PFS, ORR, VGPR or better rate, CR or better rate 
and MRD negativity rate. For OS, a modified linear alpha spending function will be used. The alpha level for 
the first look at OS was 0.0001. If the null hypothesis for an endpoint is rejected at the second IA, it will 
remain rejected and will not be re-tested. 
The results presented here correspond to the second interim analysis (231 PFS events, approx. 64 % of total 
planned PFS events). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was commissioned to review 
efficacy and safety results at the planned interim analyses. The primary PFS analysis was skipped since the 
second IA was positive.  
Sensitivity Analysis and subgroups analysis for PFS 
The following sensitivity analyses were planned for PFS: 
• 
Progressive disease based on investigator assessment 
•  Not Censored for Start of Subsequent Antimyeloma Therapies 
•  Censored for Death/PD after Missing More Than One Disease Evaluation 
•  Analysis of PFS using the per-protocol population 
•  Analysis using unstratified log rank rest and Cox Regression Model 
Subgroup analyses for PFS were also performed and included age, sex, race, geographic region, ISS staging, 
renal function, hepatic function, type of multiple myeloma, cytogenetic risk and baseline Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score.

Study Period: The first subject was randomized on 09 Feb 2015; the data cut-off date for the second interim 
analysis was 12 Jun 2017. As of this date, 706 subjects from 162 centers in 25 countries were randomized 
into Study MMY3007, with 350 subjects randomized to the D-VMP group and 356 subjects randomized to the 
VMP group. The Study is ongoing. Treatment groups were distributed similarly by region. The majority 
(83%) of subjects were enrolled at sites in Europe, with most subjects from Spain (15%), Poland (9%), Italy 
(8%), Czech Republic (7%), Ukraine (7%), and the Russian Federation (6%). Seventeen percent of subjects 
were enrolled in countries outside Europe, with most of those subjects from Japan (7%) and the Republic of 
Korea (6%); 6 subjects (<1%) were enrolled in the United States.  
To control for any variation in transplant ineligibility criteria among countries or regions, subjects were 
considered transplant-ineligible if they were age ≥65 years; if <65 years old, subjects had to have important 
comorbid conditions deemed likely to have a negative impact on tolerability to the high dose chemotherapy 
used in ASCT. Age was the main transplant ineligibility criterion for 649 subjects (92%), and comorbidity 
accounted for 56 (8%) subjects; 1 subject did not have an age or comorbidity factor, however, bortezomib 
and transplant were not available as treatment options for this subject. This was reported as a major 
protocol deviation. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was dated 26 June 2014, and there were 6 amendments (2 country– specific) to the 
protocol.  
Key changes are summarized below: 
Table 9: Summary of protocol amendments 
Protocol Deviations 
All protocol deviations of eligibility criteria and those deviations that could impact subject safety or study 
endpoints were considered major protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations were reported for 81 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

subjects (12%) across both treatment groups: 36 subjects (10%) in the D-VMP group and 45 subjects 
(13%) in the VMP group.  
Table 10: Summary of major protocol deviations – ITT  
In the D-VMP group, of the 6 subjects with efficacy assessment deviations, 5 received subsequent anticancer 
therapy before confirmation of disease progression, and 1 was missing an efficacy assessment prior to 
confirmation of disease progression. Eleven (11) subjects received a disallowed concomitant treatment 
(systemic corticosteroids >10mg prednisone per day or equivalent). Nine (9) subjects received the wrong 
treatment or incorrect dose. For 5 subjects, study treatment was not administered according to the protocol 
schedule (1 of these subjects also had a deviation for treatment modification during an adverse event); 2 
additional subjects had a deviation for treatment not modified during an adverse event; 1 subject received 
an incorrect duration and volume of daratumumab infusion; 1 subject received an incorrect dose of 
bortezomib; and 1 subject received chlorambucil instead of melphalan). Six (6) subjects entered but did not 
satisfy criteria; 3 of these subjects had known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or persistent asthma, 
2 subjects had prior or current systemic therapy for multiple myeloma, and 
1 subject had incomplete screening procedures. Safety assessment deviation was reported for 5 subjects, all 
with incomplete screening procedures. One subject developed withdrawal criteria, but did not discontinue 
from treatment. 
In the VMP group, of the 19 subjects with efficacy assessment deviations, 16 received subsequent anticancer 
therapy before confirmation of disease progression (2 of these subjects also had a deviation for receiving 
systemic corticosteroids >10mg prednisone per day or equivalent), and 3 were missing an efficacy 
assessment prior to confirmation of disease progression. Eleven (11) subjects received a disallowed 
concomitant treatment, 10 received systemic corticosteroids >10 mg prednisone per day or equivalent, and 
1 received a strong cyp3a4 inducer while using bortezomib. Eight (8) subjects received wrong treatment or 
incorrect dose. For 2 subjects, study treatment was not administered according to the protocol schedule, 4 
subjects had a deviation for treatment not modified during an adverse event, 1 subject received an incorrect 
dose of bortezomib, and 1 subject received chlorambucil instead of melphalan. Six (6) subjects entered but 
did not satisfy criteria; 4 of these subjects did not have pre-treatment laboratory values meeting the 
protocol-specified criteria, 1 subject was not newly-diagnosed or a candidate for high-dose chemotherapy, 
and 1 subject had prior or current systemic therapy for multiple myeloma. A safety assessment deviation 
was reported for 6 subjects, all with incomplete screening procedures. 
A per protocol analysis that removed subjects (6 subjects in the D-VMP group and 5 subjects in the VMP 
group) with deviations due to not meeting inclusion/exclusion from the ITT population was used as a

sensitivity analysis for PFS, and the results were consistent with the primary PFS analysis. Protocol 
deviations did not have a significant impact on the overall study results.

Compliance with EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L assessments was comparable between treatment groups. 
The compliance rates at baseline were 90% and 90% in the D-VMP group and 91% and 92% in the VMP 
group, for the EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-C30, respectively. Through month 12, compliance was greater 
than 70% for the EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-C30 in both the D-VMP and VMP groups. It should be noted that 
6 subjects were randomized and not treated (4 in D-VMP group and 2 in VMP group) and therefore did not 
contribute PRO data. 
The functional status and well-being results from patient reported outcome (PRO) endpoints, including the 
cancer-specific EORTC-QLQ-C30 and the general health EQ-5D-5L, indicated that improvements in 
health-related quality of life in subjects who remained in the study in both the D-VMP and VMP groups were 
maintained. 
EORTC-QLQ-C30 
Global Health Status Subscale 
Baseline scores on the Global Health Status (GHS) subscale were comparable between treatment groups. 
There was a statistically significant difference in the mean change from baseline at Month 3 for the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 GHS, in favor of D-VMP treatment (LS mean change; VMP: 4.1 [95% CI: 1.8, 6.5], D-VMP: 7.6 
[95% CI: 5.3, 9.8]; [p=0.0265]), though no adjustment was made for multiplicity. There were no 
statistically significant differences in least square mean changes from baseline between the VMP and D-VMP 
groups for month 6 through month 18; HRQOL improvements were comparable between treatment groups. 
The median time to improvement was 3.06 months for the D-VMP group and 3.75 months for the VMP 
group) for the GHS subscale. While there was no statistically significant difference in the GHS subscale 
median time to worsening between treatment groups, there was a 4.8-month difference with a longer time 
to worsening with D-VMP treatment (23.56 months for the D-VMP group and 18.76 months for the VMP 
group; HR=0.80 (95%CI: 0.60, 1.08) [p=0.1438]).

Functional and Symptom Subscales 
The other subscales of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 included: functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, 
and social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting) and single-item symptom scores for 
the following: dyspnea, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties. 
Baseline scores on all subscales were comparable between treatment groups. For the functional scales 
(physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), and symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and 
vomiting), least square mean changes from baseline were not statistically significant different between 
treatment groups. 
EQ-5D-5L 
Baseline scores on the EQ-5D-5L utility score and EQ-5D-5L VAS were comparable between treatment 
groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean change from baseline at Month 3 for the 
EQ-5D-5L VAS, in favor of D-VMP treatment (LS mean change; VMP: 3.7 [95% CI: 1.7, 5.7], D-VMP: 6.8 
[95% CI: 4.9, 8.7]; [p=0.0151]) though no adjustment was made for multiplicity. No statistically significant 
differences between treatment groups were observed in least square mean changes from baseline for the 
EQ-5D-5L utility value; utility improvement was comparable over the treatment period. For the median time 
to improvement, the utility value median was 2.89 months for the D-VMP group and 2.99 months for the 
VMP group, and the VAS median was 2.96 months for the D-VMP group and 4.19 months for the VMP group. 
Median time to worsening in utility and VAS scores was not evaluable at the clinical cutoff of 16.5 months. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analysis of PFS by INV 
A sensitivity analysis using disease progression assessed by the investigator showed consistency with the 
primary results. By investigator assessment, 88 subjects (25%) in the D-VMP group and 137 subjects (39%) 
in the VMP group progressed or died. As seen in the primary analysis, there was a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS for subjects in the D-VMP group compared with VMP group (HR=0.53; 95% CI: 0.40, 
0.69; p<0.0001). Reasons for censoring of data from the investigator assessment were also consistent with 
that in the primary analysis.

Supportive study(ies) 
The MAH has provided data from additional 12 patients from a phase 1 study (not shown here). These data 
are considered too limited to provide any added value and were not considered for this assessment. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has provided one pivotal phase 3 study, MMY3007, and one small phase 1b supportive study to 
support the proposed new indication. The pivotal study is a randomised, multicentre and international study, 
including approximately 700 patients. The incl/excl. criteria define a newly diagnosed MM population that 
are ineligible for ASCT. The proposed new indication reflects these criteria. The majority of the patients have 
IgG myeloma, ISS stage II, and no extramedullary plasmacytomas.  
Patients were randomised 1:1 to VMP or D+VMP, and patients randomised to D+VMP will continue Dara Q 
4wks post-VMP until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or study end.  
The objectives are clearly described. The primary objective is to compare efficacy in terms of PFS between 
VMP and D-VMP.

The MAH has applied few and clinically meaningful stratification factors. With regard to sample size; the 
power and alpha are as to be expected for a phase III study. With regard to statistics, two interim analyses 
(IA’s) were planned for the primary endpoint. The first IA was planned in order to assess safety. The second 
IA was planned when approximately 60% of PFS events had occurred. The MAH has applied an alpha 
spending function to control the alpha, which is agreed. The MAH has applied a hierarchical testing for the 
testing of secondary endpoints. This is also acknowledged. 
In Study MMY3007, daratumumab was administered at 16 mg/kg as per the daratumumab prescribing 
information, but the dosing schedule was modified to match the 6-week cycle length for VMP: 16 mg/kg IV 
weekly for 6 weeks, then every 3 weeks for 48 weeks (Cycle 2 to 9), and then every 4 weeks thereafter 
(post-VMP Treatment Phase) until documented progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study end. CD38, the 
target for daratumumab, is expressed on NK cells and clinical data has shown NK cell suppression to be a 
marker of target drug activity. Clinical pharmacokinetic data have shown the 16 mg/kg dose to be the lowest 
dose that results in nearly complete target suppression at all time points. This dose and schedule 
continuously suppressed NK cells throughout dosing.  
The baseline demographics are overall well-balanced between the two treatment arms. The majority of 
patient are white, with a median age of 71 years. However, there were 12 more patients below 65 years in 
the D-VMP arm, while there were slightly more patients above 65 in the VMP arm. The medical history of 
patients < 65 years was analysed, showing 53% in the D-VMP arm having an ECOG PS score of 2 vs. 33% 
in the VMP arm. Those with PS score of 1 had medical comorbidities such as cardiac, respiratory, central 
nervous disorders or others rendering them transplant-ineligible. 
Overall, the pivotal study is well conducted.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study met its primary endpoint at the planned second interim analysis showing both a statistically 
significant and clinically highly relevant difference in terms of PFS. The MAH updated data with clinical cut off 
of 12 October 2017, approximately 4 months after the primary cut-off. The median PFS for the updated data 
was 19.29 months in the VMP group vs. not reached in D-VMP group (HR=0.46; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.60; 
p<0.0001) compared to 18.14 in the VMP arm and not yet reached in the D-VMP arm (HR=0.50; 95% CI: 
0.38, 0.65; p< 0.0001) in the original analyses. Thus, updated data were consistent with the primary 
analyses.  OS data are still not yet mature. It is noted, that 16% had a high-risk cytogenetic abnormality, ie. 
the results may be biased by relatively few high-risk patients. The risk of disease progression is reduced by 
54%.  The updated data are reflected in the SmPC section 5.1.   
Re-randomization was not performed by start of the maintenance treatment phase with daratumumab 
monotherapy. However, the CHMP (SAWP) accepted the proposed study design. Nonetheless, it is not 
possible to disentangle the effect of the maintenance therapy with daratumumab monotherapy from the 
combination treatment. This also in view of the apparent dropping of the PFS curves after stopping of the 
VMP combination. Data regarding durability of MRD would be able to give some insights on this issue. 
However, there is limited data on durability of MRD negativity, only few patients had MRD assessments 
performed. MRD analysis using other thresholds (10-4 and 10-6) showed similar results, which from a 
clinical perspective is encouraging.  In order to further substantiate the contribution of daratumumab 
maintenance therapy, the MAH has analysed PFS for the first 12 months on treatment and after 12 months. 
Median PFS was only reached for the VMP arm after 12 months. Although data were not mature, PFS was 
consistent both before and after 12 months, (HR=0.51; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.74; and HR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.33, 
0.71 respectively), in favour of the D-VMP arm. Despite small numbers, more patients in the D-VMP arm 
compared with the VMP arm achieved CR or better (9% vs. 4%). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018 
Page 50/89 
 
  
  
With regard to the secondary endpoints ORR, VGPR and CR, they are all in line with the primary endpoint, 
showing statistically highly significant differences in favour of Dara. There is almost a doubling in CR or 
better (24.4% vs. 42.6%), which is relevant from a clinical perspective. The ORR is 90.9% in the D-VMP arm 
compared with 73.9% in the VMP arm. The effect of D-VMP was observed during the first 12 months with a 
CR rate of 34% and 21% respectively for the D-VMP and the VMP group.  Overall, these results show an 
added benefit of Dara in combination with VMP in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, who are 
ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. The MRD negativity rate is 22.3% vs. 6.2% in the D-VMP and 
VMP arms respectively, demonstrating a deep effect of D-VMP as compared with VMP in Multiple Myeloma.  
It is not possible to disentangle the effect of the maintenance therapy with daratumumab monotherapy from 
the combination treatment. This also in view of the apparent dropping of the PFS curves after stopping of the 
VMP combination. The data on durability of MRD negativity are limited, only few patients had MRD 
assessments performed, but initial data showed a positive effect in the D-VMP arm, which from a clinical 
perspective is encouraging. In order to further substantiate the contribution of daratumumab maintenance 
therapy, the MAH has analysed PFS for the first 12 months on treatment and after 12 months. Median PFS 
was only reached for the VMP arm after 12 months. Although data were not mature, PFS was consistent both 
before and after 12 months, (HR=0.51; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.74; and HR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.71 
respectively), in favour of the D-VMP arm. Despite small numbers, more patients in the D-VMP arm 
compared with the VMP arm achieved CR or better (9% vs. 4%). 
The other secondary endpoints, OS, PFS2, TTP, DOR, and TTNT are all in line with the primary endpoint, but 
data are immature. OS data are not expected to be mature for the time being. The MAH has committed to 
provide updated data post-approval. For the remaining secondary endpoint, the updated data were 
consistent with the primary analyses. Final Clinical Study Report will be provided post – approval. The MAH 
will also provide the updated analyses of biomarkers predictive of response and resistance to therapy 
post-approval. These analyses will be performed after the study is unblinded and correlated with clinical 
responses. 
There is an unmet need in patients that are ineligible for ASCT. These patients have different options for 
treatment, and one of the options is VMP. However, regardless of treatment regimen, the patients will 
relapse.  Thus, there is an unmet medical need and prolongation of PFS is clinically meaningful, both from a 
patient and physicians perspective. Several clinically meaningful secondary objectives are defined, including 
ORR, PFS2, and OS. 
It is acknowledged that the MAH has adhered to the CHMP scientific advice, however, the management of 
this patient population has changed over the last couple of years. Therefore there are concerns related to the 
generalizability of the efficacy results to the target population in clinical practice, given that nowadays in 
many centers across the EU, comorborbidity and physiological age are more important factors to consider if 
a patient is “ineligible" for high dose chemotherapy and ASCT. The MAH has presented the efficacy results for 
the subset of patients considered ineligible to high dose QT + SCT according to current practice guidelines, 
i.e. 270 out of 356 (76%) patients in the VMP study group and 273 out of 350 (79%) patients in D-VMP study 
group. Results for this subset of patients are fully consistent to those seen for the overall studied population, 
which is reassuring. The main results for this subgroup of patients are reflected in Section 5.1 of the SmPC.   
The subgroup analysis shows results that are consistent with the primary endpoint, however, some 
subgroups include few patient, which is reflected in the wide confidence interval. The MAH has analysed PFS 
when patients younger than 65 years were excluded. The results were consistent with the original analysis, 
which is reassuring. Subgroup analyses of PFS by age group were also consistent with the original PFS 
analysis, but due to small numbers, the results should be interpreted with caution. Thus the effect of D+VMP 
is considered similar across all stratification factors.  Furthermore, the subgroup analysis by ECOG PS at 
baseline is difficult to interpretate, given that results in the group with the worst status (ECOG PS 2) might 
be diluted by the results in the more represented group of patients with an ECOG PS=1. This is a relevant 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

aspect to determine whether a given patient is candidate to ASCT or not.  The MAH has analysed the 3 
categories of ECOG PS. They show rather consistent results with a trend for lower ORR and PFS results in 
both study groups in patients with poorer PS and a trend for a lower magnitude of benefit vs the SOC in same 
patient subgroups. Nevertheless, based on these results the benefit of D-VMP over VMP in terms of PFS and 
ORR can be concluded across the 3 groups of patients. 
The MAH has presented the efficacy results for the subset of patients considered ineligible to high dose 
chemotherapy + SCT according to current practice guidelines, either due to older age (at least 70 years), 
comorbidities or ECOG PS=2, i.e. 270 out of 356 (76%) patients in the VMP study group and 273 out of 350 
(79%) patients in D-VMP study group. Sensitivity analyses showed the PFS result (HR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.42, 
0.75) and the depth of response (overall response rate [ORR]: 90% in D-VMP group vs 74% in VMP group; 
very good partial response [VGPR] or better rate: 71% in D-VMP group vs 51% in VMP group); and complete 
response (CR) or better rate: 42% in D-VMP group vs 26% in VMP group). These results are fully consistent 
to those seen for the overall studied population, which is reassuring. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study MMY3007 comparing VMP to Dara+VMP is a well-conducted phase III study, demonstrating the added 
value of Dara in combination with VMP. PFS was significantly prolonged, and median PFS has not yet been 
reached in the D-VMP arm. The risk of disease progression is reduced by 54%, which is considered 
encouraging from a clinical point of view. The results from secondary endpoints and subgroup analysis are 
by majority consistent with the primary endpoint. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Summaries of adverse events and other safety data are based on 700 subjects who were randomized, 
received at least 1 dose of any study treatment, and contributed any safety data after the start of study 
treatment, ie, the Safety Population. Based on the study design, subjects in the VMP group were treated for 
a maximum of 9 cycles of VMP and subsequently entered into a Follow-up phase. In the D-VMP group, 
subjects were treated for 9 cycles of D-VMP combination treatment and subsequently continued 
daratumumab monotherapy until disease progression. The median exposure for the D-VMP group was 12 
cycles, whereas the median exposure for the VMP group was 9 cycles. 
Patient exposure 
A summary of treatment cycles received by subjects in both treatment groups is presented below. According 
to the protocol, after completing nine 6-week cycles, subjects in the D-VMP group were to receive 
daratumumab 16 mg/kg monotherapy every 4 weeks. Subjects randomized to the VMP group were to be 
treated for 9 cycles and then enter a follow-up observation phase until disease progression. Eighty-two 
percent (82%) of subjects in the D-VMP group and 68% of subjects in the VMP group received up to 9 cycles 
of treatment (including subjects who received any dose of study treatment in Cycle 9). As of the clinical 
cut-off, subjects in the D-VMP group received a median of 12 cycles and subjects in the VMP group received 
a median of 9 cycles. The median duration of treatment was 14.74 months for the D-VMP group and 11.99 
months for the VMP group.

Infections and infestations 
Overall, the rates of infections and infestations were higher in the D-VMP (67%) compared to the VMP (48%) 
group.  This  was  primarily  driven  by  upper  respiratory  tract  infections  (D-VMP  group:  26%;  VMP  group: 
14%), pneumonia (D-VMP group: 15%; VMP group: 5%) and bronchitis (D-VMP group: 15%; VMP group: 
8%).  However,  discontinuation  of  study  treatments  due  to  infection  and  infestation  TEAEs  was  low  and 
balanced between the two groups, reported in 3 subjects (0.9%) in the D-VMP group and 5 subjects (1.4%) 
in the VMP group), and 1 subject in each group discontinued treatment due to  pneumonia.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed, and no interactions of daratumumab and small 
molecule drugs such as bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone are expected as there is no overlapping 
pathway of elimination. In Study MMY3003, 286 patients were treated with daratumumab in combination 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd), and in Study MMY3004, 251 patients were treated with

daratumumab in combination bortezomib and dexamethasone (DVd). No signs of drug-drug interaction with 
daratumumab were identified, and combination therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or 
bortezomib and dexamethasone, are approved indications for daratumumab.

Dose modifications 
A higher proportion of subjects in the D-VMP group (70%) had a TEAE leading to treatment cycle delays or 
dose modifications for any study drug (ie, dose delays, dose skipping, schedule change or dose reduction) 
compared with the VMP group (63%). Of note, dose reductions to daratumumab were not allowed, thus 
subjects could only delay or skip daratumumab. In addition, a higher proportion of subjects in the D-VMP 
group (49%) had a Grade 3 or 4 TEAE leading to treatment cycle delays or dose modifications for any study 
drug compared with the VMP group (40%). The most common (>5% in either group) TEAEs leading to 
treatment cycle delays or dose modifications in the D-VMP and VMP groups, respectively, were 
thrombocytopenia (20% and 16%), neutropenia (17% and 16%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (15% and 
18%), pneumonia (11% and 3%), upper respiratory tract infection (10% and 4%), bronchitis (8% and 3%), 
neuralgia (6% and 4%), and diarrhea (reported in 5% of subjects in both groups). 
A similar proportion of subjects in the D-VMP group (57%) and VMP group (56%) had a TEAE leading to dose 
modifications of bortezomib. The most commonly reported (>5% in either group) TEAEs leading to dose 
modifications of bortezomib in the D-VMP and VMP groups, respectively, were peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (15% and 18%), thrombocytopenia (12% and 12%), neutropenia (10% and 11%), pneumonia 
(7% and 2%), neuralgia (6% and 3%), and upper respiratory tract infection (6% and 3%). A similar 
proportion of subjects in the D-VMP group (22%) had a TEAE leading to dose modifications of melphalan 
compared with the VMP group (23%). 
The most commonly reported (>5% in either group) TEAEs leading to dose modifications of melphalan 
treatment in the D-VMP and VMP groups, respectively, were thrombocytopenia (11% and 8%), and 
neutropenia (7% and 9%).  
A similar proportion of subjects in the D-VMP group (8%) had a TEAE leading to dose modifications of 
steroids compared with the VMP group (7%). No TEAEs were reported for more than 2% for either group.

Forty percent (40%) of subjects in the D-VMP group had a TEAE leading to dose modifications of 
daratumumab; 31% had a Grade 3 or 4 TEAE leading to dose modifications of daratumumab. The most 
common (>5%) TEAEs leading to dose modifications of daratumumab were thrombocytopenia (12%), 
neutropenia (11%), and pneumonia (7%). 
Post marketing experience 
The proposed indication is not marketed. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The majority of patients experienced an AE, however the question is whether the pattern of AEs change as 
a function of time. The MAH has analysed TEAEs in the D-VMP group during the first part of the study 
compared with the second (maintenance phase) part of the study. The major difference in TEAEs between 
the two treatment groups in the first 9 cycles was more infections and infestations, especially pneumonia in 
the D-VMP group compared with the VMP group. After cycle 9, ie during daratumumab monotherapy, 46% 
of the patients had a reported TEAE of new onset, the most frequent being upper respiratory tract infection 
(6%). Other TEAEs occurred at a low frequency (<5%) and no new TEAE with a high frequency was reported 
during daratumumab monotherapy. 
The most common AEs are related to blood and lymphatic disorders, infections, GI disorders, peripheral 
neuropathy, hypertension, musculoskeletal system, decreased appetite and respiratory system. Main 
differences in disfavour of D+VMP are seen with regard to upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, 
bronchitis, cough, dyspnoea and hypertension. This reflects the known safety profile of Dara and VMP. 
Infections and infestations (including pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infection), cough, hypertension 
and dyspnoea are very common in patients being treated with Dara. Hypertension, cough, bronchitis and 
dyspnoea are related to IRR that are observed in approximately 50% of patients treated with Dara.   
The most common Grade 3/4 AEs were as expected in this group of patients, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, anaemia and pneumonia. Except for pneumonia, the addition of Dara to VMP did not 
result in clinically relevant difference between the two treatment arms. This is reassuring. As mentioned 
before, pneumonia is a very common AE related to Dara, however, this AE is manageable in the clinical 
setting with antibiotics, etc. 
Not surprisingly, IRRs are very common and well known in patients treated with Dara and in the D+VMP arm. 
The majority of the events are Grade 1 or 2, no Grade 5 AEs were reported. The SmPC gives clear 
precautionary measures in order to minimise the risk of IRRs. 
Even though the thrombocytopenia is very common, the incidence of haemorrhage is low in both treatment 
arms, but slightly higher in the D+VMP arm. However, the majority of the events are Grade 1-2, and the 
incidence of Grade 4 AEs is similar between the two treatment arms. Contusions seems to be relatively more 
common in the D+VMP arm, but these events were found to be related to the chemotherapy, no action was 
taken and they all resolved spontaneously. 
Peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating AE related to bortezomib. However, the weekly administration of 
bortezomib leads to better tolerance. The incidence of Grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy is low in both 
treatment arms, but considerable lower in the D+VMP arm. This is reassuring. Nonetheless, bortezomib was 
discontinued in 8% vs. 11% of the subjects in D+VMP and VMP respectively. 
The majority of the patients that died, did so during the study. Overall, the number of subjects that died 
during the study, within 30 days of last dose and within 60 day of the first 60 days, is similar between the two 
treatment groups. However, there are some discrepancies between the number of Grade 5 AEs (reported on 
table 5 of the SCS) and deaths within 30 days from the last study dose (reported on tables 10 and 11 of the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018 
Page 76/89 
 
  
  
SCS), with a total of 8 more deaths reported as grade 5 AEs. The MAH has clarified, that most of the events 
were found to be related to the chemotherapy, no action was taken and they all resolved spontaneously. 
SAE are more frequent in the D+VMP arm, 41.6% vs. 32.5%. The main difference is driven by infections and 
infestations. As discussed previously, this reflects the known safety profile of Dara and VMP. Infections and 
infestations (including pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infection), cough, hypertension and dyspnoea 
are very common in patients being treated with Dara. However, most events were clinically manageable and 
thereby avoiding discontinuation from study treatment. 
Overall, abnormal chemistry values of Grade 3 or 4 were low in both treatment arms, except for 
hypernatremia and hyperglycaemia. These AEs are easily manageable in the clinical setting. With regard to 
liver parameters, 2 patients in the D-VMP arm and 4 patients in the VMP arm met the criteria for Hy’s law. 
None of the patients required dose modifications or interruption of the treatment. They all had medical 
comorbidities, which most likely contributed to the laboratory abnormalities. 
Apart from slightly more Grade 4 AEs in females, no relevant differences were observed with regard to age, 
sex, region or race. Patients with impaired renal and hepatic function had, not surprisingly, slightly more AEs 
and discontinuations in both treatment arms.  
Although numbers censored in each group are small, it is noted, that 12 (19%) had a new plasmacytoma in 
the D-VMP arm compared to 5 (4.5%) in the VMP group. The MAH found no scientific explanation to this 
difference.  
Overall, discontinuation rates are low in both treatment arms, however, a difference in favour of D+VMP is 
observed. This is reassuring and seems to reflect the fact that the combination of Dara and VMP is 
well-tolerated and that the observed AEs are manageable in the clinical setting with supportive therapy and 
dose modifications, which were more common in the D+VMP arm. There is no clear pattern in the AEs 
leading to discontinuation.  
Finallly, but yet most importantly, as previously discussed in relation to the assessment of efficacy, the study 
population may not be considered representative of a population “ineligible for ASCT” in most EU countries 
according to current standards.  
The MAH has provided an update with 4 additional months of follow-up (data cut-off date 12 October, 2017). 
At that time, 66.2% of subjects in the D-VMP were still receiving treatment, while all subjects in the VMP 
group had either completed or discontinue treatment. Only 1 additional subject died during the updated 
safety follow-up, due to the exacerbation of heart failure. This Grade 5 AE was considered as unrelated to 
study treatment (event narrative provided, not shown in this AR).  
Overall, the type and frequency of events occurred during the additional 4 months of follow-up did not 
change from those reported in the initial follow-up period and no new signals or alarming findings were 
identified.  
The MAH has not provided the information broken down as requested (subgroup 1. patients ≥70 years old; 
subgroup 2. patients between the ages of 65 and 70, with important co-morbidities and/or a poor 
performance status (i.e., ECOG 2)), but pooled according to their definition of subjects unfit for transplant 
(subjects <65 years old with significant co-morbidity or ECOG PS Score=2; or subjects 65-69 years old with 
ECOG PS=2; or subjects at least 70 years old. Overall, the safety findings do not substantially differ from 
those in the control group. However, slightly higher frequencies (e.g., serious AEs, certain SOCs) are 
observed when compared to the overall population. In light of the efficacy data available, separate safety 
data on population subsets considered of special interest due to their vulnerability to added toxicity (e.g., 
those with ECOG PS score =2) are deemed critical for the B/R discussion and for the individualized 
prescribing decision.

No subject had treatment-emergent interference for blood typing reported during the study. A survey of the 
effectiveness of the educational materials regarding the minimization of risk of interference of blood typing 
is ongoing (see RMP).  
Overall, the observed safety profile is as expected and in line with the safety profile of Dara and VMP. 
Discontinuation rate is low, reflecting the fact that AEs are manageable in the clinical setting with supportive 
therapy and dose modification. The provided safety update is consistent with the primary analyses.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The addition of daratumumab to VMP is well-tolerated. The observed safety profile is as expected and in line 
with the safety profile of daratumumab and VMP.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has 
been revised to amend contact details for the representatives of Lithuania and Slovenia. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Full user testing in compliance with the above mentioned legislative requirements was recently performed 
(n= 20 participants) on the package leaflet developed for DARZALEX for the initial Marketing Authorisation

Application, which received a positive opinion on 1st April 2016 by the Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use and a European Commission decision on 20th May 2016. 
The package leaflet has been updated since the initial authorisation as part of a Type II variation to extend 
the indication, however, minimal changes were introduced and the proposed changes reflected language 
and a format that was consistent with previously approved leaflet. 
With the currently proposed indication extension, minimal changes have been introduced to the package 
leaflet and the proposed changes reflect language and a format that is consistent with that in the currently 
approved leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma - who are considered ineligible for HDT 
and ASCT due to their age, presence of comorbidities, and/or physical status.    
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The combination of bortezomib plus melphalan plus prednisone (VMP) is a standard triplet regimen approved 
in the US and Europe for frontline therapy in patients ineligible for transplant. The combination of 
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd) is also approved for use in this population in Europe and the US.  
Despite these approved regimens, there remains an unmet need for new therapeutic options for the frontline 
setting directed at alternative MoAs that can better control the disease and provide deeper, more sustained 
responses and better long-term outcomes. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current submission supporting the approval of daratumumab for the treatment of patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for ASCT is based on data from the Phase 3 study, MMY3007 
(clinical cut-off, 12 June 2017), comparing daratumumab 16 mg/kg administered in combination with VMP 
to VMP alone. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study MMY3007 showed both a statistically significant and clinically highly relevant difference in terms of 
PFS. The updated median PFS is 19.29 months in the VMP arm and not yet reached in the D-VMP arm. The 
updated HR is HR=0.46; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.60; p<0.0001. The risk of disease progression is reduced by 54%.  
Secondary endpoints are all in line with the primary endpoint, showing statistically highly significant 
differences in favour of daratumumab. There is almost a doubling in CR or better (24.4% vs. 42.6%), which 
is very encouraging from a clinical perspective. The ORR is 90.9% in the D-VMP arm compared with 73.9% 
in the VMP arm. Overall, these results clearly show the added benefit of Dara in combination with VMP in this 
patient population. The MRD negativity rate is 22.3% vs. 6.2% in the D-VMP and VMP arms respectively. 
This demonstrates a deep and profound effect of Dara+VMP, indicating a more durable response. Data on 
durability of MRD negativity are sparce, the MAH will however continue to evaluate MRD according to the 
MMY3007 protocol.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018 
Page 84/89 
 
  
  
 
Results for the secondary endpoints, PFS2, TTP, DOR, and TTNT were updated with additional + 4 months 
since database cut-off were consistent with the primary analyses, although data are still not mature.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties about the favourable effects. 
The final OS analysis will be provided post-approval as a Post-Authorisation Measure (LEG) by December 
2021, together with updated PFS, PFS2, TTP, DOR and durability of MRD negativity data post-approval. 
Further, the MAH will provide the updated analyses of biomarkers predictive of response and resistance to 
therapy post-approval as a Post-Authorisation Measure (LEG) by June 2022.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The majority of patients experienced an AE.  The major difference in TEAEs between the two treatment 
groups in the first 9 cycles was more infections and infestations, especially pneumonia in the D-VMP group 
compared with the VMP group. After cycle 9, ie. during daratumumab monotherapy, 46% of the patients had 
a reported TEAE of new onset, the most frequent being upper respiratory tract infection (6%). Other TEAEs 
occurred at a low frequency (<5%) and no new TEAE with a high frequency was reported during 
daratumumab monotherapy. 
The MAH has provided an update with 4 additional months of follow-up (data cut-off date 12 October, 2017). 
At that time, 66.2% of subjects in the D-VMP were still receiving treatment, while all subjects in the VMP 
group had either completed or discontinue treatment. Overall, the type and frequency of events occurred 
during the additional 4 months of follow-up did not change from those reported in the initial follow-up period 
and no new signals were identified.  
The interference with blood typing test (indirect Coombs test) at an earlier disease stage has previously been 
discussed.  The MAH has analysed the available post-marketing data, and very few cases of interference of 
blood typing (an important identified risk) or haemolysis (an important potential risk) have been reported, 
which is reassuring. Data on these risks are included as part of the routine Pharmacovigilance activities, 
since both risks are currently included in the RMP. In addition, the MAH is assessing the effectiveness of the 
implemented mitigation measures via a survey (PASS). 
The safety profile in patients considered unfit for transplant, was in general consistent with that of the overall 
study population, no signal or alarming data were observed. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were no uncertainties in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Study  MMY3007  comparing  VMP  to  Dara+VMP  is  a  well-designed  and  well-conducted  phase  III  study, 
convincingly  demonstrating  the  added  value  of  Dara  in  combination  with  VMP.  PFS  was  significantly 
prolonged, and median PFS has not yet been reached in the D-VMP arm. The risk of disease progression is 
reduced  by  54%,  which  is  considered  clinically  encouraging.  The  results  from  secondary  endpoints  and 
subgroup analyses are all consistent with the primary endpoint. The MRD negativity rate of 22.3% vs. 6.2% 
in  the  D-VMP  and  VMP  arms  respectively  is  interesting,  demonstrating  a  deep  and  more  sustainable 
response of the Dara-VMP treatment.  
However,  this  comes  at  the  cost  of  an  increased  risk  of  SAE,  especially  pneumonia.  Infections  and 
infestations (including pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infection), cough, hypertension and dyspnea 
are  very  common  in  patients  being  treated  with  Dara.  Most  events  were  clinically  manageable  with 
supportive therapy and thereby avoiding discontinuation from study treatment. 
Overall, the addition of Dara to VMP is well tolerated. The observed safety profile is as expected and in line 
with the safety profile of Dara and VMP. The safety profile for patients considered unfit for transplant is 
consistent with that of the overall study population. Discontinuation rate is low, reflecting the fact that AEs 
are overall manageable in the clinical setting with supportive therapy and dose modification.  
The benefits of daratumamab in combination with VMP seem to outweigh the risks.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include the combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the 
treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem 
cell transplant for Darzalex; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP version 3.2 (in version 2 of the RMP template) has 
also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update 
the contact details of the Lithuanian and Slovenian local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to update Annex II with regards to PSUR requirements. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to the launch of Darzalex (daratumumab) in each Member State (MS) the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational materials, aiming at increasing 
awareness about the Important Identified Risk of “Interference for blood typing (minor antigen) (Positive 
Indirect Coombs’ test)” and providing guidance on how to manage it. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where Darzalex (daratumumab) is marketed, all HCPs and patients 
who are expected to prescribe, dispense and receive this product have access to/are provided with the 
below. 
The HCPs and Blood Banks educational materials, shall contain the following key elements: 
The guide for HCPs and Blood Banks, to advice about the risk of interference for blood typing and how to 
minimise it; 
The Patient Alert Card. 
The Guide for HCP and Blood Banks shall contain the following key elements: 
•  All patients should be typed and screened prior to start treatment with daratumumab; alternatively, 
phenotyping may also be considered; 
•  Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect Coombs test (interfering with cross-matching of blood) may 
persist for up to 6 months after the last product’s infusion, therefore, the HCP should advise the patient 
to carry the Patient Alert Card until 6 months after the treatment has ended; 
•  Daratumumab bound to Red Blood Cells (RBCs) may mask the detection of antibodies to minor antigens 
in the patient’s serum; 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted; 
The interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt 
daratumumab binding or other locally validated methods. Since the Kell Blood group system is also 
sensitive to DTT treatment, Kell-negative units should be supplied after ruling out or identifying 
alloantibodies using DTT-treated RBCs. Alternatively, genotyping may also be considered; 
In case of urgent need for transfusion, non-cross matched ABO/RhD compatible RBC units can be 
administered as per local bank practices; 
In the event of a planned transfusion, the HCPs should notify blood transfusion centres about the 
interference with indirect antiglobulin tests; 
•  Reference to the need to consult the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC); 
•  Reference to the need of giving the Patient Alert Card to the patients and to advise them to consult the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/599644/2018

Package Leaflet (PL). 
The Patient Alert Card, shall contain the following key elements: 
•  A warning message for HCPs treating the patient at any time, including in conditions of emergency, that 
the patient is using Darzalex (daratumumab), and that this treatment is associated with the Important 
Identified Risk of Interference for blood typing (minor antigen) (Positive Indirect Coombs’ test), which 
might persist for up to 6 months after the last product’s infusion, and a clear reference that the patient 
should continue to carry this card until 6 months after the treatment has ended; 
•  Contact details of the Darzalex (daratumumab) prescriber; 
•  Reference to the need to consult the Package Leaflet (PL). 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Darzalex is not similar to Thalidomide Celgene, Imnovid, 
Farydak, Kyprolis and Ninlaro within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. 
See appendix I. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include the combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone for the 
treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem 
cell transplant for Darzalex; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP is updated to version 3.2 (in version 2 of the RMP 
template). In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder took the opportunity to update Annex II with 
regards to PSUR requirements and to update the contact details of the Lithuanian and Slovenian local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet.

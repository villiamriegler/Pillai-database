CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Insulin aspart Sanofi is indicated for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 1 year and above. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The potency of insulin analogues, including insulin aspart, is expressed in units, whereas the potency 
of human insulin is expressed in international units. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi dosing is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient. 
It should normally be used in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin.

Moreover, Insulin aspart Sanofi vial can be used for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) 
in pump systems.  
Insulin aspart Sanofi vial can also be used if intravenous administration of insulin aspart, by 
physicians or other healthcare staff, is applicable. 
Blood glucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustments are recommended to achieve optimal 
glycaemic control. 
The individual insulin requirement in adults and children is usually between 0.5 and 1.0 unit/kg/day. 
In a basal-bolus treatment regimen 50%-70% of this requirement may be provided by Insulin aspart 
Sanofi and the remainder by intermediate-acting or long-acting insulin. 
Adjustment of dose may be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity, change their 
usual diet or during concomitant illness. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
When transferring from other insulin medicinal products, adjustment of the Insulin aspart Sanofi dose 
and the dose of the basal insulin may be necessary. Insulin aspart Sanofi has a faster onset and a 
shorter duration of action than soluble human insulin. When injected subcutaneously into the 
abdominal wall, the onset of action will occur within 10-20 minutes of injection. The maximum effect 
is exerted between 1 and 3 hours after the injection. The duration of action is 3 to 5 hours. 
Close glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the initial weeks thereafter (see 
section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years old) 
Insulin aspart Sanofi can be used in elderly patients. 
In elderly patients, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin aspart dose adjusted on an 
individual basis. 
Renal impairment  
Renal impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. 
In patients with renal impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin aspart dose 
adjusted on an individual basis. 
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic impairment may reduce the patient’s insulin requirements. 
In patients with hepatic impairment, glucose monitoring should be intensified and the insulin aspart 
dose adjusted on an individual basis. 
Paediatric population 
Insulin aspart Sanofi can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above in preference to 
soluble human insulin when a rapid onset of action might be beneficial, for example, in the timing of 
the injections in relation to meals (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
The safety and efficacy of Insulin aspart Sanofi in children below 1 year of age have not been 
established. No data are available.

Method of administration 
Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analogue. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is administered subcutaneously by injection in the upper arms, thighs, buttocks or 
abdomen. Injection sites should always be rotated within the same region in order to reduce the risk of 
lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and 4.8). Subcutaneous injection in the 
abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than other injection sites. Compared to soluble human 
insulin the faster onset of action of insulin aspart is maintained regardless of the injection site. The 
duration of action will vary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature and level of 
physical activity. 
Due to the faster onset of action, insulin aspart should generally be given immediately before a meal. 
When necessary insulin aspart can be given soon after a meal. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi 100 units/ml solution for injection in vial 
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) 
Insulin aspart Sanofi may be used for CSII in pump systems suitable for insulin infusion. CSII should 
be administered in the abdominal wall. Infusion sites should be rotated.  
When used with an insulin infusion pump, Insulin aspart Sanofi should not be mixed with any other 
insulin medicinal products. 
Patients using CSII should be comprehensively instructed in the use of the pump system and use the 
correct reservoir and tubing for the pump (see section 6.6). The infusion set (tubing and cannula) 
should be changed in accordance with the instructions in the product information supplied with the 
infusion set.  
Patients administering Insulin aspart Sanofi by CSII must have an alternative insulin delivery method 
available in case of pump system failure.  
Intravenous use  
If necessary, Insulin aspart Sanofi can be administered intravenously which should be carried out by 
physicians or other healthcare staff. For intravenous use, infusion systems with Insulin aspart Sanofi 
100 units/ml at concentrations from 0.05 unit/ml to 1.0 unit/ml insulin aspart in the infusion fluids: 
0.9% sodium chloride solution or 5% glucose, 40 mEq potassium chloride, 0.45% sodium chloride 
solution or 10% glucose solution using polypropylene infusion bags, are stable at room temperature 
for 24 hours.  
Although stable over time, a certain amount of insulin will be initially adsorbed to the material of the 
infusion bag. Monitoring of blood glucose is necessary during insulin infusion. 
Mixing two types of insulins  
Insulin aspart Sanofi should not be mixed with any other insulin medicinal products, including NPH 
(Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin since respective compatibility studies have not been performed.  
Administration with a syringe  
Insulin aspart Sanofi vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale (see 
section 6.6).  
Insulin aspart Sanofi 100 units/ml solution for injection in cartridge 
Insulin aspart Sanofi in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. If 
administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used. 
Other insulin aspart medicinal products offering such an option should be used. Insulin aspart Sanofi 
in cartridges is designated to be used in the following pens (see section 6.6):  
- 
- 
JuniorSTAR which delivers 1-30 units of insulin aspart in 0.5 unit dose increments  
Tactipen which delivers 1-60 units of insulin aspart in 1 unit dose increments 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver 1-80 units of insulin aspart in 1 unit dose increments. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi 100 units/ml solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
Insulin aspart Sanofi 100 units/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe, intravenous injection or infusion pump is necessary, a vial should be used. 
Other insulin aspart medicinal products offering such an option should be used. Insulin aspart Sanofi 
in pre-filled pen delivers 1-80 units in increments of 1 unit. 
Patients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the 
requirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who 
are blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who 
has good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. 
For detailed user instructions, please refer to the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment 
of antidiabetic medicinal products may be considered. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Inadequate dosing or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes, may lead to 
hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Usually the first symptoms of hyperglycaemia develop 
gradually over a period of hours or days. They include thirst, increased frequency of urination, nausea, 
vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath. 
In type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is 
potentially lethal. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. 
Especially in children, care should be taken to match insulin doses (especially in basal-bolus 
regimens) with food intake, physical activities and current blood glucose level in order to minimise the 
risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. In case 
of hypoglycaemia or if hypoglycaemia is suspected insulin aspart must not be injected. After 
stabilisation of patient’s blood glucose adjustment of the dose should be considered (see sections 4.8 
and 4.9). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may 
experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia, and should be advised 
accordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. 
A consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if hypoglycaemia 
occurs, it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human insulin. 
Since insulin aspart should be administered in immediate relation to a meal, the rapid onset of action 
should be considered in patients with concomitant diseases or treatment where a delayed absorption of 
food might be expected. 
Concomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient’s 
insulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or 
thyroid gland can require changes in the insulin dose. 
When patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with 
their previous insulin. 
Transfer from other insulin medicinal products 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type, origin (animal, human insulin or human 
insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may 
result in the need for a change in dose. Patients transferred to Insulin aspart Sanofi from another type 
of insulin may require an increased number of daily injections or a change in dose from that used with 
their usual insulin medicinal products. If an adjustment is needed, it may occur with the first dose or 
during the first few weeks or months. 
Injection site reactions 
As with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, 
inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given 
area reduces the risk of developing these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few 
weeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of insulin aspart. 
Combination of insulin aspart with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and insulin aspart is considered. If the 
combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain 
and oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. 
Avoidance of accidental mix-ups/medication errors 
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental 
mix-ups between Insulin aspart Sanofi and other insulin medicinal products. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Insulin antibodies 
Insulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin 
antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or 
hypoglycaemia. 
Travel 
Before travelling between different time zones, the patient should seek the doctor’s advice since this 
may mean that the patient has to take the insulin and meals at different times. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism. 
The following substances may reduce the patient's insulin requirements:  
Oral antidiabetic medicinal products, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), beta-blockers, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, anabolic steroids and sulphonamides. 
The following substances may increase the patient’s insulin requirements:  
Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, sympathomimetics, growth 
hormone and danazol. 
Beta-blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Octreotide/lanreotide may either increase or decrease the insulin requirement. 
Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Insulin aspart Sanofi (insulin aspart) can be used in pregnancy. Data from two randomised controlled 
clinical trials (322 and 27 exposed pregnancies) do not indicate any adverse reaction of insulin aspart 
on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/newborn when compared to human insulin (see 
section 5.1). 
Intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes (type 1 diabetes, 
type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes) are recommended throughout pregnancy and when 
contemplating pregnancy. Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and increase 
subsequently during the second and third trimester. After delivery, insulin requirements normally 
return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values. 
Breast-feeding  
There are no restrictions on treatment with Insulin aspart Sanofi during breast-feeding. Insulin 
treatment of the breast-feeding mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the Insulin aspart Sanofi 
dose may need to be adjusted.

Fertility 
Animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin aspart and human 
insulin regarding fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
The patient’s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may 
constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using 
machines).  
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving, this is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be 
considered in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions observed in patients using insulin aspart are mainly due to the pharmacologic effect 
of insulin.  
The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia. The frequencies of 
hypoglycaemia vary with patient population, dose regimens and level of glycaemic control (see 
section 4.8 Description of selected adverse reactions). 
At the beginning of the insulin treatment, refraction anomalies, oedema and injection site reactions 
(pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur. 
These reactions are usually of transitory nature. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be 
associated with acute painful neuropathy, which is usually reversible. Intensification of insulin therapy 
with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of 
diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of 
diabetic retinopathy. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Anaphylactic reactions 
The occurrence of generalised hypersensitivity reactions (including generalised skin rash, itching, 
sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and 
reduction in blood pressure) is very rare but can potentially be life threatening. 
Hypoglycaemia 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too 
high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or 
convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. 
The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale 
skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty 
in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. 
In clinical trials, the frequency of hypoglycaemia varied with patient population, dose regimens and 
level of glycaemic control. During clinical trials the overall rates of hypoglycaemia did not differ 
between patients treated with insulin aspart compared to human insulin. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the 
injection site and delay local insulin absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the 
given injection area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials with insulin aspart, the frequency, type and 
severity of adverse reactions observed in the paediatric population do not indicate any differences to 
the broader experience in the general population. 
Other special populations 
Based on post-marketing sources and clinical trials with insulin aspart, the frequency, type and 
severity of adverse reactions observed in the elderly patients and in patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment do not indicate any differences to the broader experience in the general population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose  
A specific overdose for insulin cannot be defined, however, hypoglycaemia may develop over 
sequential stages if too high doses relative to the patient’s requirement are administered: 
• 
Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary 
products. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient always carries sugar-containing 
products.  
Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with 
glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a trained person, or with 
glucose given intravenously by physicians or other healthcare staff. Glucose must be given 
intravenously, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes. Upon 
regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrates is recommended for the patient in 
order to prevent a relapse.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes. Insulins and analogues for injection, fast-acting.  
ATC code: A10AB05 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the 
website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects  
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin aspart is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following 
binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose 
output from the liver.  
Insulin aspart produces a more rapid onset of action compared to soluble human insulin, together with 
a lower glucose concentration, as assessed within the first four hours after a meal. Insulin aspart has a 
shorter duration of action compared to soluble human insulin after subcutaneous injection. 
Fig. I. Blood glucose concentrations following a single pre-meal dose of insulin aspart injected 
immediately before a meal (solid curve) or soluble human insulin administered 30 minutes before a 
meal (hatched curve) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When insulin aspart is injected subcutaneously, the onset of action will occur within 10 to 20 minutes 
of injection. The maximum effect is exerted between 1 and 3 hours after injection. The duration of 
action is 3 to 5 hours. 
Clinical efficacy  
Clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes have demonstrated a lower postprandial blood glucose 
with insulin aspart compared to soluble human insulin (Fig. I). In two long-term open label trials in 
patients with type 1 diabetes comprising 1070 and 884 patients, respectively, insulin aspart reduced 
glycated haemoglobin by 0.12 [95% C.I. 0.03; 0.22] percentage points and by 0.15 [95% C.I. 0.05; 
0.26] percentage points compared to human insulin; a difference of limited clinical significance.  
Clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes have demonstrated a reduced risk of nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia with insulin aspart compared with soluble human insulin. The risk of daytime 
hypoglycaemia was not significantly increased.  
Insulin aspart is equipotent to soluble human insulin on a molar basis. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years old)  
A randomised, double-blind cross-over PK/PD trial comparing insulin aspart with soluble human 
insulin was performed in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes (19 patients aged 65-83 years, mean age 
70 years). The relative differences in the pharmacodynamic properties (GIRmax,AUCGIR, 0-120 min) 
between insulin aspart and human insulin in the elderly were similar to those seen in healthy subjects 
and in younger patients with diabetes. 
Paediatric population 
A clinical trial comparing preprandial soluble human insulin with postprandial insulin aspart was 
performed in small children (20 patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, studied for 12 weeks, among those 
four were younger than 4 years old) and a single dose PK/PD trial was performed in children 
(6-12 years) and adolescents (13-17 years). The pharmacodynamic profile of insulin aspart in children 
was similar to that seen in adults. 
The efficacy and safety of insulin aspart given as bolus insulin in combination with either insulin 
detemir or insulin degludec as basal insulin has been studied for up to 12 months, in two randomised 
controlled clinical trials in adolescents and children aged 1 to less than 18 years (n=712). The trials 
included 167 children aged 1-5 years, 260 aged 6-11 and 285 aged 12-17. The observed improvements 
in HbA1c and the safety profiles were comparable between all age groups. 
Pregnancy 
A clinical trial comparing safety and efficacy of insulin aspart vs. human insulin in the treatment of 
pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (322 exposed pregnancies (insulin aspart: 157; human insulin: 
165) did not indicate any adverse reaction of insulin aspart on pregnancy or on the health of the 
foetus/newborn. 
In addition, the data from a clinical trial including 27 women with gestational diabetes randomised to 
treatment with insulin aspart vs. human insulin (insulin aspart: 14; human insulin: 13) showed similar 
safety profiles between treatments. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption, distribution and elimination 
In insulin aspart substitution of amino acid proline with aspartic acid at position B28 reduces the 
tendency to form hexamers as observed with soluble human insulin. Insulin aspart is therefore more 
rapidly absorbed from the subcutaneous layer compared to soluble human insulin. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The time to maximum concentration is, on average, half of that for soluble human insulin. A mean 
maximum plasma concentration of 492±256 pmol/L was reached 40 (interquartile range: 30–40) 
minutes after a subcutaneous dose of 0.15 unit/kg bodyweight in type 1 diabetic patients. The insulin 
concentrations returned to baseline about 4 to 6 hours after dose. The absorption rate was somewhat 
slower in type 2 diabetic patients, resulting in a lower Cmax (352±240 pmol/L) and later tmax (60 
(interquartile range: 50–90) minutes). The intra-individual variability in time to maximum 
concentration is significantly less for insulin aspart than for soluble human insulin, whereas the 
intra-individual variability in Cmax for insulin aspart is larger. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years old) 
The relative differences in pharmacokinetic properties between insulin aspart and soluble human 
insulin in elderly patients (65-83 years, mean age 70 years) with type 2 diabetes were similar to those 
observed in healthy subjects and in younger patients with diabetes. A decreased absorption rate was 
observed in elderly patients, resulting in a later tmax (82 (interquartile range: 60-120) minutes), whereas 
Cmax was similar to that observed in younger patients with type 2 diabetes and slightly lower than in 
patients with type 1 diabetes.  
Hepatic impairment 
A single dose pharmacokinetic study of insulin aspart was performed in 24 subjects with hepatic 
function ranging from normal to severely impaired. In patients with hepatic impairment, absorption 
rate was decreased and more variable, resulting in delayed tmax from about 50 min in subjects with 
normal hepatic function to about 85 min in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. 
AUC, Cmax and CL/F were similar in patients with reduced hepatic function compared with subjects 
with normal hepatic function. 
Renal impairment 
A single dose pharmacokinetic study of insulin aspart in 18 subjects with renal function ranging from 
normal to severely impaired was performed. No apparent effect of creatinine clearance values on 
AUC, Cmax, CL/F and tmax of insulin aspart was found. Data were limited in patients with moderate and 
severe renal impairment. Patients with renal failure necessitating dialysis treatment were not 
investigated. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of insulin aspart were investigated in children 
(6–12 years) and adolescents (13–17 years) with type 1 diabetes. Insulin aspart was rapidly absorbed 
in both age groups, with similar tmax as in adults. However, Cmax differed between the age groups, 
stressing the importance of the individual titration of insulin aspart. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
In in vitro tests, including binding to insulin and IGF-1 receptor sites and effects on cell growth, 
insulin aspart behaved in a manner that closely resembled human insulin. Studies also demonstrate 
that the dissociation of binding to the insulin receptor of insulin aspart is equivalent to human insulin.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insulin aspart Sanofi is and what it is used for 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a rapid-acting effect. Modern insulin 
products are improved versions of human insulin. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children 
aged 1 year and above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does 
not produce enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with nsulin aspart helps 
to prevent complications from your diabetes. 
Insulin aspart will start to lower your blood sugar 10–20 minutes after you inject it, a maximum effect 
occurs between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 3–5 hours. Due to this short 
action insulin aspart should normally be taken in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting 
insulin preparations. Moreover, Insulin aspart Sanofi can be used for continuous subcutaneous 
infusion in a pump system. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Insulin aspart Sanofi 
Do not use Insulin aspart Sanofi 
• 
If you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
“Contents of the pack and other information” section 6). 
If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting (see “Summary of serious and very 
common side effects” in section 4). 
If the protective cap is loose or missing. Each vial has a protective, aluminium cap with tear-off 
lid. If it is not in perfect condition when you get the vial, return the vial to your supplier.

section 5). 
If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. 
If any of these applies, do not use Insulin aspart Sanofi. Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for 
advice. 
Before using Insulin aspart Sanofi 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin.  
Remove the protective cap. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
Needles and syringes must not be shared. 
Warnings and precautions 
Record the brand name (“Insulin aspart Sanofi”) and Lot number (included on the outer carton and 
label of each vial) of the medicine you are using and provide this information when reporting any side 
effects. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see “How to use Insulin aspart Sanofi”). 
Contact your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a 
different area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your 
insulin or your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
• 
• 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level.  
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor.  
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical trials have been carried out 
in children below the age of 1 year. 
Other medicines and Insulin aspart Sanofi 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression)  
Beta–blockers (used to treat high blood pressure)  
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)  
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone)  
Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation)  
Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle-aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes)  
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Insulin aspart and alcohol 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or 
fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Insulin aspart can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin dose may 
need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly 
prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.   
There are no restrictions on treatment with insulin aspart during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine while pregnant or 
breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or use a machine:  
• 
• 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia.  
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and 
therefore also your ability to drive or use a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi has a rapid onset of effect therefore if hypoglycaemia occurs, you may 
experience it earlier after an injection when compared to soluble human insulin. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”.

How to use Insulin aspart Sanofi 
Dose and when to use your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Insulin aspart is generally used immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of 
the injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, insulin aspart can be given soon after a meal 
(see “How and where to inject” below for information). 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Insulin aspart can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above instead of soluble human 
insulin when a rapid onset of effect is preferred. For example, when it is difficult to dose the child in 
relation to meals. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How to use and where to inject 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously) or for continuous subcutaneous 
infusion in a pump system. Administration in a pump system will require a comprehensive instruction 
by your healthcare professional. You must never inject yourself directly into a vein (intravenously) or 
muscle (intramuscularly). If necessary, Insulin aspart Sanofi can be given directly into a vein but this 
must only be done by physicians or other healthcare staff. 
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen), the upper arm or the front 
of your thighs. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the front of your waist (abdomen). 
You should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to handle Insulin aspart Sanofi in vial  
1. 
Draw into the syringe the same amount of air as the dose of insulin you are going to inject. 
Inject the air into the vial.  
Turn the vial and syringe upside down and draw the correct insulin dose into the syringe. Pull 
the needle out of the vial. Then expel the air from the syringe and check that the dose is correct.  
2. 
How to inject Insulin aspart Sanofi  
• 
• 
Inject the insulin under the skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse.  
Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure you have injected all the 
insulin.  
Discard the needle after each injection.  
• 
For use in an infusion pump system 
Insulin aspart Sanofi should never be mixed with any other insulin when used in a pump.  
Follow the instructions and recommendations from your doctor regarding the use of Insulin aspart 
Sanofi in a pump. Before use of Insulin aspart Sanofi in the pump system, you must have received a 
comprehensive instruction in the use and information about any actions to be taken in case of illness, 
too high or too low blood sugar or failure of the pump system.  
• 
Before inserting the needle, use soap and water to clean your hands and the skin where the 
needle is inserted to avoid any infection at the infusion site.  
When you fill a new reservoir, be certain not to leave large air bubbles in either the syringe or 
the tubing.  
• 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Changing of the infusion set (tubing and needle) must be done according to the instructions in 
the product information supplied with the infusion set.  
To get the benefit of insulin infusion, and to detect possible malfunction of the insulin pump, it is 
recommended that you measure your blood sugar level regularly. 
What to do in case of pump system failure  
You should always have an alternative delivery method for your insulin available for injection under 
the skin in case of pump system failure. 
If you use more insulin than you should 
If you use too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia) (see “Summary of serious 
and very common side effects” in section 4). 
If you forget to use your insulin 
If you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia) (see “Effects 
from diabetes” in section 4). 
If you stop using your insulin  
Do not stop using your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (see “Effects 
from diabetes” in section 4).  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 
10 people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see "Insulin aspart and alcohol” in section 2). 
Signs of low blood sugar: Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling 
very hungry; temporary changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness 
or tremor; feeling anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how 
to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are 
conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
• 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case.  
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  When symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when blood sugar level is stabilised, 
• 
continue insulin treatment as usual.  
If you have such a low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had need for injection 
of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk with a doctor. 
The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted.  
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (become unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink due to risk of suffocation. 
Serious allergic reactions to Insulin aspart Sanofi or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic 
reaction) is a very rare side effect but can potentially be life-threatening. It may affect up to 1 in 
10,000 people. 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
Other side effects 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue 
under the skin at the injection site may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect 
up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called 
amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these 
skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, tell your doctor or 
nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption of your insulin, if 
you inject in such a site. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of using your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately (see also “Serious allergic reactions” above). 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Swollen joints: When you start using insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
Rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people). 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve-related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects

If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side  
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
Effects from diabetes  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin.  
Forget to inject your insulin or stop using insulin.  
Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need.  
Get an infection and/or a fever.  
Eat more than usual.  
Exercise less than usual.  
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar 
• 
• 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately.  
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insulin aspart Sanofi is and what it is used for 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a rapid-acting effect. Modern insulin 
products are improved versions of human insulin. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children 
aged 1 year and above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does 
not produce enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with insulin aspart 
helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. 
Insulin aspart will start to lower your blood sugar 10–20 minutes after you inject it, a maximum effect 
occurs between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 3–5 hours. Due to this short 
action insulin aspart should normally be taken in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting 
insulin preparations.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Insulin aspart Sanofi 
Do not use Insulin aspart Sanofi  
• 
If you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting (see “Summary of serious and very 
common side effects” in section 4). 
If the cartridge or the device containing the cartridge is dropped, damaged or crushed. 
If it has not been stored correctly or been frozen (see “How to store Insulin aspart Sanofi” in 
section 5). 
If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any of these applies, do not use Insulin aspart Sanofi. Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for 
advice. 
Before using Insulin aspart Sanofi  
• 
• 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin.  
Always check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger at the bottom of the cartridge. Do not 
use it if any damage is seen or if the rubber plunger has been drawn above the white label band 
at the bottom of the cartridge. This could be a result of leakage of insulin. If you suspect the 
cartridge is damaged, take it back to your supplier. See your pen manual for further instructions. 
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
Needles and pens must not be shared. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
• 
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Record the brand name (“Insulin aspart Sanofi”) and Lot number (included on the outer cartons and 
labels of each cartridge) of the medicine you are using and provide this information when reporting 
any side effects. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insulin aspart Sanofi). Contact 
your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different 
area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or 
your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
• 
• 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level.  
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor.  
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical trials have been carried out 
in children below the age of 1 year. 
Other medicines and Insulin aspart Sanofi 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression)  
Beta–blockers (used to treat high blood pressure)  
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)  
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone)  
Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation)  
Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle–aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta–blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes)  
Some patients with long–standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Insulin aspart and alcohol 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or 
fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Insulin aspart can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin dose may 
need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly 
prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.   
There are no restrictions on treatment with insulin aspart during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine while pregnant or 
breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or use a machine:  
• 
• 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia.  
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and 
therefore also your ability to drive or use a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi has a rapid onset of effect therefore if hypoglycaemia occurs, you may 
experience it earlier after an injection when compared to soluble human insulin. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that to say essentially “sodium-
free”.

3. 
How to use Insulin aspart Sanofi 
Dose and when to use your insulin 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Insulin aspart is generally used immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of 
the injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, insulin aspart can be given soon after a meal 
(see “How and where to inject below for information”). 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Insulin aspart can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above instead of soluble human 
insulin when a rapid onset of effect is preferred. For example, when it is difficult to dose the child in 
relation to meals. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How to use and where to inject 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself 
directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Insulin aspart Sanofi 100 units/ml in 
cartridges is only suitable for injecting under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to your doctor if you 
need to inject your insulin by another method.  
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen), the upper arm or the front 
of your thighs. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the front of your waist (abdomen). 
You should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
• 
• 
To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Insulin aspart Sanofi cartridges are to be used only with 
the following pens:  
- 
- 
JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units 
Tactipen, AllStar and AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
Always carry a spare cartridge in case it is lost or damaged. 
How to inject Insulin aspart Sanofi  
• 
Inject the insulin under the skin. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and 
as described in your pen manual. 
Keep the needle under your skin for at least 10 seconds. Keep the dose button held in until the 
needle has been released from the skin. This will ensure you get your full dose. 
Remove and discard the needle after each injection. Do not store Insulin aspart Sanofi with the 
needle attached. Otherwise the liquid may leak out which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
Always use a new needle for each injection. This helps stop blocked needles, contamination and 
infection. 
• 
• 
• 
If you use more insulin than you should 
If you use too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia) (see “Summary of serious 
and very common side effects” in section 4). 
If you forget to use your insulin 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia) (see “Effects 
from diabetes” in section 4). 
If you stop using your insulin  
Do not stop using your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (see “Effects 
from diabetes” in section 4). 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 
10 people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see "Insulin aspart and alcohol” in section 2). 
Signs of low blood sugar: 
Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; temporary 
changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness or tremor; feeling 
anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how 
to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are 
conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
• 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case.  
•  When symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when blood sugar level is stabilised, 
• 
continue insulin treatment as usual.  
If you have such a low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had need for injection 
of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk with a doctor. 
The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted.  
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (become unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink due to risk of suffocation. 
Serious allergic reactions to Insulin aspart Sanofi or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic 
reaction) is a very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect up to 1 in 
10,000 people. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
Other side effects 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue 
under the skin at the injection site may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect 
up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called 
amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these 
skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, tell your doctor or 
nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption of your insulin, if 
you inject in such a site. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of using your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately (see also “Serious allergic reactions“ above). 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Swollen joints: When you start using insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
Effects from diabetes  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin.  
Forget to inject your insulin or stop using insulin.  
Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need.  
Get an infection and/or a fever.  
Eat more than usual.  
Exercise less than usual.  
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar 
• 
• 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately.  
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Insulin aspart Sanofi is and what it is used for 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is a modern insulin (insulin analogue) with a rapid-acting effect. Modern insulin 
products are improved versions of human insulin. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is used to reduce the high blood sugar level in adults, adolescents and children 
aged 1 year and above with diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Diabetes is a disease where your body does 
not produce enough insulin to control the level of your blood sugar. Treatment with insulin aspart 
helps to prevent complications from your diabetes. 
Insulin aspart will start to lower your blood sugar 10–20 minutes after you inject it, a maximum effect 
occurs between 1 and 3 hours after the injection and the effect lasts for 3–5 hours. Due to this short 
action insulin aspart should normally be taken in combination with intermediate-acting or long-acting 
insulin preparations.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Insulin aspart Sanofi 
Do not use Insulin aspart Sanofi 
• 
If you are allergic to insulin aspart, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you suspect hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting (see “Summary of serious and very 
common side effects” in section 4) 
If the pre-filled pen is dropped, damaged or crushed. 
If it has not been stored correctly or been frozen (see “How to store Insulin aspart Sanofi” in 
section 5). 
If the insulin does not appear clear and colourless. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any of these applies, do not use Insulin aspart Sanofi. Talk with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for 
advice. 
Before using Insulin aspart Sanofi 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin.  
Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination. 
Needles and the pre-filled pen must not be shared. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is only suitable for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you 
need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Warnings and precautions 
Record the brand name (“Insulin aspart Sanofi”) and Lot number (included on the outer cartons and 
labels of each pre-filled pen) of the medicine you are using and provide this information when 
reporting any side effects. 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Insulin aspart Sanofi). Contact 
your doctor if you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different 
area. Your doctor may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or 
your other antidiabetic medications dose. 
Some conditions and activities can affect your need for insulin. Consult your doctor: 
• 
• 
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver, or with your adrenal, pituitary or thyroid glands. 
If you exercise more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet, as this may affect your 
blood sugar level.  
If you are ill, carry on taking your insulin and consult your doctor.  
If you are going abroad, travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing 
of your injections. 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children below 1 year of age since no clinical trials have been carried out 
in children below the age of 1 year. 
Other medicines and Insulin aspart Sanofi 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Some medicines affect your blood sugar level and this may mean that your insulin dose has to change. 
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment. 
Your blood sugar level may fall (hypoglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Other medicines for the treatment of diabetes 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (used to treat depression)  
Beta–blockers (used to treat high blood pressure)  
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure) 
Salicylates (used to relieve pain and lower fever)  
Anabolic steroids (such as testosterone)  
Sulphonamides (used to treat infections). 
• 
• 
• 
Your blood sugar level may rise (hyperglycaemia) if you take: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) 
Thiazides (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention) 
Glucocorticoids (such as ‘cortisone’ used to treat inflammation)  
Thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders) 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Sympathomimetics (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], or salbutamol, terbutaline used to treat 
asthma) 
Growth hormone (medicine for stimulation of skeletal and somatic growth and pronounced 
influence on the body’s metabolic processes) 
Danazol (medicine acting on ovulation). 
Octreotide and lanreotide (used for treatment of acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that usually 
occurs in middle–aged adults, caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone) may 
either increase or decrease your blood sugar level. 
Beta–blockers (used to treat high blood pressure) may weaken or suppress entirely the first warning 
symptoms which help you to recognise low blood sugar. 
Pioglitazone (tablets used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes)  
Some patients with long–standing type 2 diabetes and heart disease or previous stroke who were 
treated with pioglitazone and insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor 
as soon as possible if you experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid 
increase in weight or localised swelling (oedema). 
If you have taken any of the medicines listed here, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Insulin aspart and alcohol 
If you drink alcohol, your need for insulin may change as your blood sugar level may either rise or 
fall. Careful monitoring is recommended. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Insulin aspart can be used during pregnancy. Your insulin dose may 
need to be changed during pregnancy and after delivery. Careful control of your diabetes, particularly 
prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby.   
There are no restrictions on treatment with insulin aspart during breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice before using this medicine while pregnant or 
breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Please ask your doctor whether you can drive a car or use a machine:  
• 
• 
If you have frequent hypoglycaemia.  
If you find it hard to recognise hypoglycaemia. 
If your blood sugar is low or high, your concentration and ability to react might be affected and 
therefore also your ability to drive or use a machine. Bear in mind that you could endanger yourself or 
others. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi has a rapid onset of effect therefore if hypoglycaemia occurs, you may 
experience it earlier after an injection when compared to soluble human insulin. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
3. 
How to use Insulin aspart Sanofi 
Dose and when to use your insulin 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always use your insulin and adjust your dose exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Insulin aspart is generally used immediately before a meal. Eat a meal or snack within 10 minutes of 
the injection to avoid low blood sugar. When necessary, insulin aspart can be given soon after a meal 
(see “How and where to inject below for information”). 
Do not change your insulin unless your doctor tells you to. If your doctor has switched you from one 
type or brand of insulin to another, your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Insulin aspart can be used in adolescents and children aged 1 year and above instead of soluble human 
insulin when a rapid onset of effect is preferred. For example, when it is difficult to dose the child in 
relation to meals. 
Use in special patient groups 
If you have reduced kidney or liver function, or if you are above 65 years of age, you need to check 
your blood sugar more regularly and discuss changes in your insulin dose with your doctor. 
How to use and where to inject 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is for injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You must never inject yourself 
directly into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Insulin aspart Sanofi is only suitable 
for injecting under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method.  
With each injection, change the injection site within the particular area of skin that you use. This may 
reduce the risk of developing lumps or skin pitting (see section 4 “Possible side effects”). The best 
places to give yourself an injection are: the front of your waist (abdomen), the upper arm or the front 
of your thighs. The insulin will work more quickly if you inject into the front of your waist (abdomen). 
You should always measure your blood sugar regularly. 
How to handle Insulin aspart Sanofi SoloStar pre-filled pen 
Insulin aspart Sanofi SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin aspart. Each SoloStar 
pen delivers 1-80 units in increments of 1 unit. 
Read carefully the instructions for use included in this package leaflet. You must use the pen as 
described in the Instructions for Use.  
Always ensure you use the correct pen before you inject your insulin. 
If you use more insulin than you should 
If you use too much insulin your blood sugar gets too low (hypoglycaemia) (see “Summary of serious 
and very common side effects” in section 4). 
If you forget to use your insulin 
If you forget to use your insulin your blood sugar may get too high (hyperglycaemia) (see “Effects 
from diabetes” in section 4). 
If you stop using your insulin  
Do not stop using your insulin without speaking with a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be 
done. This could lead to very high blood sugar (severe hyperglycaemia) and ketoacidosis (see “Effects 
from diabetes” in section 4). 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Summary of serious and very common side effects 
Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is a very common side effect. It may affect more than 1 in 
10 people. 
Low blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
Inject too much insulin. 
• 
Eat too little or miss a meal. 
• 
Exercise more than usual. 
• 
Drink alcohol (see "Insulin aspart and alcohol” in section 2). 
Signs of low blood sugar: 
Cold sweat; cool pale skin; headache; rapid heartbeat; feeling sick; feeling very hungry; temporary 
changes in vision; drowsiness; unusual tiredness and weakness; nervousness or tremor; feeling 
anxious; feeling confused; difficulty in concentrating. 
Severe low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness. If prolonged severe low blood sugar is not 
treated, it can cause brain damage (temporary or permanent) and even death. You may recover more 
quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how 
to use it. If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugar snack as soon as you are 
conscious. If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital. 
What to do if you experience low blood sugar: 
• 
If you experience low blood sugar, eat glucose tablets or another high sugar snack (e.g. sweets, 
biscuits, fruit juice). Measure your blood sugar if possible and rest. Always carry glucose tablets 
or high sugar snacks with you, just in case.  
•  When symptoms of low blood sugar have disappeared or when blood sugar level is stabilised, 
• 
continue insulin treatment as usual.  
If you have such a low blood sugar that it makes you pass out, if you have had need for injection 
of glucagon, or if you have experienced many incidents of low blood sugar, talk with a doctor. 
The amount or timing of insulin, food or exercise may need to be adjusted.  
Tell relevant people that you have diabetes and what the consequences may be, including the risk of 
passing out (become unconscious) due to low blood sugar. Let them know that if you pass out, they 
must turn you on your side and get medical help straight away. They must not give you any food or 
drink due to risk of suffocation. 
Serious allergic reactions to Insulin aspart Sanofi or one of its ingredients (called a systemic allergic 
reaction) is a very rare side effect but can potentially be life threatening. It may affect up to 1 in 
10,000 people. 
Seek medical advice immediately: 
• 
• 
If signs of allergy spread to other parts of your body. 
If you suddenly feel unwell, and you: start sweating; start being sick (vomiting); have difficulty 
in breathing; have a rapid heartbeat; feel dizzy. 
If you notice any of these signs, seek medical advice immediately. 
Other side effects 
Skin changes at the injection site: If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the fatty tissue 
under the skin at the injection site may shrink (lipoatrophy) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect 
up to 1 in 100 people). Lumps under the skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called 
amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change the injection site with each injection to help prevent these 
skin changes. If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site, tell your doctor or 
nurse. These reactions can become more severe, or they may change the absorption of your insulin, if 
you inject in such a site 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
Signs of allergy: Local allergic reactions (pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and 
itching) at the injection site may occur. These usually disappear after a few weeks of using your 
insulin. If they do not disappear, or if they spread throughout your body, talk to your doctor 
immediately (see also “Serious allergic reactions above). 
Vision problems: When you first start your insulin treatment, it may disturb your vision, but the 
disturbance is usually temporary. 
Swollen joints: When you start using insulin, water retention may cause swelling around your ankles 
and other joints. Normally this soon disappears. If not, talk to your doctor. 
Diabetic retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes which can lead to loss of vision): If you have 
diabetic retinopathy and your blood sugar level improves very fast, the retinopathy may get worse. 
Ask your doctor about this. 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) 
Painful neuropathy (pain due to nerve damage): If your blood sugar level improves very fast, you may 
get nerve related pain. This is called acute painful neuropathy and is usually transient. 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
Effects from diabetes  
High blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) 
High blood sugar may occur if you: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Have not injected enough insulin.  
Forget to inject your insulin or stop using insulin.  
Repeatedly inject less insulin than you need.  
Get an infection and/or a fever.  
Eat more than usual.  
Exercise less than usual.  
Warning signs of high blood sugar: 
The warning signs appear gradually. They include: increased urination; feeling thirsty; losing your 
appetite; feeling sick (nausea or vomiting); feeling drowsy or tired; flushed; dry skin; dry mouth and a 
fruity (acetone) smell of the breath. 
What to do if you experience high blood sugar 
• 
• 
If you get any of the above signs: test your blood sugar level, test your urine for ketones if you 
can, then seek medical advice immediately.  
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). If you do not treat it, this 
could lead to diabetic coma and eventually death.

Insulin aspart Sanofi solution for injection in pre-filled pen (SoloStar)  
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE  
Read this first 
Important information 
•  Never share your pen – it is only for you. 
•  Never use your pen if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. 
•  Always perform a safety test 
•  Always carry a spare pen and spare needles in case they got lost or stop working. 
•  Never re-use needles. If you do you might not get your dose (underdosing) or get too much 
(overdosing) as the needle could block. 
Learn to inject 
•  Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about how to inject, before using your pen. 
•  Ask for help if you have problems handling the pen, for example if you have problems with your 
sight. 
•  Read all package leaflet information and instructions before using your pen. If you do not follow 
all of these instructions, you may get too much or too little insulin. 
Need help? 
If you have any questions about your pen or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or 
contact the local representative of the Marketing Authorization Holder mentioned on the front of this 
leaflet. 
Extra items you will need: 
• 
• 
a new sterile needle (see STEP 2).

STEP 1: Check your pen 
• 
Take a new pen out of the fridge at least 1 hour before you inject. Cold insulin is more 
painful to inject. 
1A  Check the name and expiry date on the label of your pen. 
•  Make sure you have the correct insulin. This is especially important if you have other 
injector pens. 
Never use your pen after the expiry date. 
• 
1B  Pull off the pen cap. 
1C  Check that the insulin is clear. 
•  Do not use the pen if the insulin looks cloudy, coloured or contains particles. 
STEP 2: Attach a new needle 
•  Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps stop blocked needles, 
contamination and infection. 
•  Only use needles that are compatible for use with Insulin aspart Sanofi. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2A  Take a new needle and peel off the protective seal. 
2B  Keep the needle straight and screw it onto the pen until fixed. Do not overtighten. 
2C  Pull off the outer needle cap. Keep this for later. 
2D   Pull off the inner needle cap and throw away. 
 Handling needles 
•  Take care when handling needles – this is to prevent needle injury and cross-infection. 
STEP 3: Do a safety test 
•  Always do a safety test before each injection – this is to: 
•  check your pen and the needle are working properly. 
•  make sure that you get the correct insulin dose. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3A  Select 2 units by turning the dose selector until the dose pointer is at the 2 mark. 
3B  Press the injection button all the way in. 
•  When insulin comes out of the needle tip, your pen is working correctly. 
If no insulin appears: 
•  You may need to repeat this step up to 3 times before seeing insulin. 
• 
If no insulin comes out after the third time, the needle may be blocked. If this happens: 
- 
- 
change the needle (see STEP 6 and STEP 2), 
then repeat the safety test (STEP 3). 
•  Do not use your pen if there is still no insulin coming out of the needle tip. Use a new pen. 
•  Never use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. 
If you see air bubbles 
•  You may see air bubbles in the insulin. This is normal, they will not harm you. 
STEP 4: Select the dose 
•  Never select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached. This may damage 
your pen. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4A   Make sure a needle is attached and the dose is set to ‘0’. 
4B  Turn the dose selector until the dose pointer lines up with your dose. 
• 
• 
• 
If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down. 
If there are not enough units left in your pen for your dose, the dose selector will stop at the 
number of units left. 
If you cannot select your full prescribed dose, use a new pen or inject the remaining units and 
use a new pen to complete your dose. 
How to read the dose window 
Even numbers are shown in line with the dose pointer: 
Odd numbers are shown as a line between even numbers: 
20 units selected 
21 units selected 
Units of insulin in your pen 
•  Your pen contains a total of 300 units of insulin. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in 
steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains more than one dose. 
•  You can see roughly how many units of insulin are left by looking at where the plunger is on 
the insulin scale. 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STEP 5: Inject your dose 
• 
If you find it hard to press the injection button in, do not force it as this may break your pen. 
See the  
section below for help. 
5A  Choose a place to inject as shown in the picture  
Upper arms 
Stomach 
Thighs 
Buttocks 
5B  Push the needle into your skin as shown by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
•  Do not touch the injection button yet. 
5C  Place your thumb on the injection button. Then press all the way in and hold. 
•  Do not press at an angle – your thumb could block the dose selector from turning. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5D  Keep the injection button held in and when you see "0" in the dose window, slowly count to 
10. 
•  This will make sure you get your full dose. 
5E  After holding and slowly counting to 10, release the injection button. Then remove the 
needle from your skin. 
If you find it hard to press the button in: 
•  Change the needle (see STEP 6 and STEP 2) then do a safety test (see STEP 3). 
• 
If you still find it hard to press in, get a new pen. 
•  Never use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. 
STEP 6: Remove the needle 
•  Take care when handling needles – this is to prevent needle injury and cross-infection. 
•  Never put the inner needle cap back on. 
6A  Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen.  
•  To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. 
• 
If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another 
person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the 
needle. 
Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (contact your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and 
transmission of infectious diseases. 
• 
6B  Throw away the used needle in a puncture resistant container, or as told by your pharmacist 
or local authority. 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6C  Put the pen cap back on. 
•  Do not put the pen back in the fridge. 
How to store and care for you pen 
•  You can clean the outside of your pen by wiping it with a damp cloth (water only). Do not 
soak, wash or lubricate your pen – this may damage it. 
•  Remove the needle and throw away your used pen as told by your pharmacist or local 
• 
authority. 
For further information on the storage and use of your pen please refer to sections 2 and 5 of 
the package leaflet.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application for a marketing authorisation for Aripiprazole Pharmathen concerns a generic medicinal product 
of the centrally authorised product Abilify, which, at the time of this report, was available as tablets (5 mg, 
10 mg,  15  mg  and  30 mg),  orodispersible  tablets  (10  mg,  15  mg  and  30  mg),  oral  solution  (1 mg/ml)  and 
solution for injection (7.5 mg/ml).  
Aripiprazole  is  a  quinolinone  derivative,  7-{4-[4-(2,  3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy}-3,4-dihydro- 
2(1H)-quinolinone,  which  exerts  both  agonistic  and  antagonistic  activity  at  dopaminergic  and  serotonergic 
receptors, along with activities at other receptors. Abilify is approved for treatment of schizophrenia and manic 
episodes in Bipolar I Disorder as well as the prevention of manic episodes as follows: 
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years and 
older.  
EMA/CHMP/747323/2015 
Page 8/26 
 
  
  
  
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for 
the  prevention  of  a  new  manic  episode  in  adults  who  experienced  predominantly  manic  episodes  and 
whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.  
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I 
Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older. 
The  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  in  schizophrenia  and  Bipolar  I  Disorder  is  thought  to  be  mediated  through  a 
combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 
5HT2a receptors. For the treatment of schizophrenia, aripiprazole is given in an initial oral dose of 10 or 15 mg 
once daily. The recommended maintenance dose is 15 mg once daily. For the treatment of acute manic episodes 
in  bipolar  disorder,  the  recommended initial  oral  dose  is  15  mg once  daily  as  monotherapy,  or  combination 
therapy. For preventing recurrence of manic episodes, it is recommended to continue therapy at the same dose 
administered for treatment of acute episodes. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.  
The Applicant of Aripiprazole Pharmathen sought approval for 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (pack 
sizes of 14, 28 and 98 tablets) in the full range of indications approved for the reference product Abilify. The 
application was supported by one single dose bioequivalence (BE) study conducted under fasting condition. The 
study was carried out with the tablet strength of 10 mg instead of the highest strengths of 15 and 30 mg for 
safety reasons. For the remaining strengths, a biowaiver was requested.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as tablets containing 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg of aripiprazole as active 
substance. 
Other  ingredients  are:  crystalline  maltose,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  pregelatinised  starch,  croscarmellose 
sodium, magnesium stearate in common for all tablets; indigo carmine (E132) for 5 mg tablets; iron oxide red 
(E172) for 10 mg and 30 tablets and iron oxide yellow (E172) for 15 mg tablets. 
The product is available in PA/Alu/PVC/Alu blisters in carton box. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of aripiprazole is 7-{4-[4-(2,3-Dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butoxy}-3,4-dihydroquinolin 
-2(1H)-one and has the following structure: 
EMA/CHMP/747323/2015 
Page 9/26 
 
  
  
  
 
The structure has been confirmed using IR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and HPLC. 
Aripiprazole  is  a  white  to  off-white  crystalline  powder,  freely  soluble  in  N,N-dimethylformamide,  soluble  in 
dichloromethane, very slightly soluble in ethanol (96%). and practically insoluble in water. Solubility in water is 
increasing with lowering of pH within the physiological range. 
Aripiprazole has a non-chiral molecular structure. Polymorphism has been observed for Aripiprazole. The active 
substance manufacturer consistently produces polymorphic form B, which has been demonstrated using XRPD 
method suitable for differentiating the polymorph form obtained from other forms reported. In addition, it has 
been demonstrated that polymorphic form does not change during manufacture and shelf-life of the finished 
medicinal product. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The  information  on  the  active  substance  is  provided  according  to  the  Active  Substance  Master  File  (ASMF) 
procedure. Aripiprazole is obtained from two manufacturing sites using a single ASMF.  
Aripiprazole is synthesized in eight main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials with 
acceptable  specifications.  During  the  evaluation  procedure,  the  active  substance  starting  materials  were 
redefined to ensure full control of the quality of the active substance in line with ICH Q11. Several genotoxic 
impurities  are  generated  during  the  synthesis  and  satisfactory  data  is  presented  to  demonstrate  that  the 
manufacturing proposed is capable of removing or purging these compounds to acceptable limits in line with 
current guidelines. 
Due to regulatory starting material redefinition and consequential reclassification of intermediate manufacturers 
in  relation  to  GMP  applicability,  CHMP  recommended  performing  audits  of  the  three  new  active  substance 
intermediate manufacturers within the dates set in the submitted QP declaration/risk assessment reports that 
extended the validities of the last audits performed for these manufacturers. 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance  (Ph.  Eur.),  solubility  (Ph.  Eur.),  identity 
(Ph. Eur. and XRD), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (USP), assay (Ph. Eur.), 
impurities (HPLC and Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods)  appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
EMA/CHMP/747323/2015 
Page 10/26 
 
  
  
  
 
Batch analysis data on three pilot scale batches and three commercial scale batches of the active substance are 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended  commercial  package  for  40  months  under  long  term  conditions  at  25  ºC  /  60%  RH  and  for  up  to 
6 months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided. 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for 6 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 
6 months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided. 
Results on stress conditions: water, acid, alkali, oxidation, UV, fluorescent, heat, and sunlight degradation were 
also provided for a single batch. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance  (Ph.  Eur.),  identity  (Ph.  Eur.),  loss  on  drying  (Ph. Eur.), 
assay (Ph. Eur.), and impurities (Ph. Eur.). The analytical methods used were the same as for release. Additional 
methods for description, solubility, identification (IR, XRD), water content, assay (HPLC), and impurities (HPLC) 
were used. It was demonstrated that the analytical methods were stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The  aim  of  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  a  stable  tablet  formulation  that  is  bioequivalent  to 
reference medicinal product Abilify tablets. 
Tablets  were  selected  as  a  pharmaceutical  form  as  it  is  the  same  as  in  the  reference  medicinal  product. 
Formulation development was based on studies investigating the physical and chemical properties of the active 
substance  alone  and  combined  with  excipients.  Due  to  low  solubility,  the  active  substance  is  micronised. 
Excipients that are soluble and enhance tablet dissolution were chosen. Further formulation studies were made 
to ensure the appropriate physico-chemical properties of the tablets and to optimise tablet manufacturability. 
Except for minor difference in pigment quantity (to match the colour of the reference medicinal product), the 
four strengths are dose proportional. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, 
USP  standards  (for  crystalline  maltose),  USP  standards  and  EC  requirements  (for  iron  oxide)  or  French 
pharmacopoeia and EC requirements (for indigo carmine (E132)). 
The  formulation  is  different  than  the  reference  medicinal  product  in  these  aspects:  crystalline  maltose  and 
pregelatinised starch are used in Aripiprazole Pharmathen as a diluent, whilst lactose monohydrate and maize 
starch  are  used  in  the  reference  medicinal  product,  and  croscarmellose  sodium  is  used  as  a  disintegrant  in 
Aripiprazole Pharmathen, whilst hydroxypropylcellulose is used as a binder in the reference medicinal product. 
The differences in formulation between Aripiprazole Pharmathen and the reference medicinal product are not 
considered  significant  based  on  data  presented  with  comparative  dissolution  profiles  and  demonstrated 
EMA/CHMP/747323/2015 
Page 11/26 
 
  
  
  
bioequivalence. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing. 
Bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between the clinical formulation and the proposed 
commercial  formulation.  This  conclusion  can  be  extrapolated  to  other  strengths  of  Aripiprazole  Pharmathen 
(5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets), as requirements for biowaiver specified in the Guideline on Investigation of 
Bioequivalence have been fulfilled. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The  primary  packaging  is  PA/Alu/PVC/Alu  blisters  in  carton  box.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and 
EC requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  seven  main  steps:  first  mixing,  wet  granulation,  drying,  dry 
granulation – sizing, second mixing, lubrication, and compression. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
average  mass  and  uniformity  of  mass  (Ph.  Eur.),  hardness  (Ph.  Eur.),  disintegration  (Ph. Eur.),  friability 
(Ph. Eur.),  loss  on  drying  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC), tightness of blister/ bottle, microbial contamination 
(Ph.  Eur.),  and  visual  inspection  of  the  packaging.  CHMP  recommended  to  review  and  to  tighten  the 
specifications for total impurities at release and shelf life of finished medicinal product, when data collected from 
higher number of commercial scale batches is available. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 batches per strength confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 production scale batches per strength of finished product stored under long term conditions 
for 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for the same specifications as at release, except for uniformity of dosage units and visual 
inspection of the packaging. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
EMA/CHMP/747323/2015 
Page 12/26 
 
  
  
  
In addition, forced degradation (hydrogen peroxide, heat and acid hydrolysis and photo degradation (visual light 
and UV)) studies have been performed. Aripiprazole is stable during acid hydrolysis, visual light exposure, visual 
light and UV light exposure and heat according to the presented data. Oxidation of aripiprazole mainly degrades 
into impurity C. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  Specifications  for  total  impurities  at  release  and  shelf  life  should  be  reviewed  and  tightened  when  data 
collected from higher number of commercial batches are available. 
2. Audits of the three new active substance intermediate manufacturers should be performed within the dates 
set  in  the  submitted  QP  declaration/risk  assessment  reports  that  extended  the  validities  of  the  last  audits 
performed for these manufacturers. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
EMA/CHMP/747323/2015 
Page 13/26 
 
  
  
  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction 
of Aripiprazole Pharmathen is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales 
volumes for all aripiprazole containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. 
Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
For a generic of a reference medicinal product no toxicological and pharmacological tests are required. The 
CHMP concluded that no additional non-clinical data were required. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The application concerned four strengths (5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg) of Aripiprazole Pharmathen tablets. 
To support the application, the results of one single dose BE study under fasting condition using 10 mg tablets, 
instead of the higher strengths of 15 and 30 mg for safety reasons, were provided. 
The Applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of a based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference 
product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Exemption  
The Applicant requested a biowaiver for the 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg strengths.  
For the reference product Abilify, linear pharmacokinetics (PK) of aripiprazole in the therapeutic dose range of 
5-30 mg has been established. Other criteria for biowaiver regarding the same manufacturing process and the 
qualitative composition/quantitative proportionality of the composition of all tablet strengths have also been 
fulfilled.  In  addition,  similarity  of  dissolution  profiles  was  demonstrated  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as described below. 
Comparative in-vitro dissolution studies were performed at 3 dissolution media (i.e. at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8). 
Twelve units of each Pharmathen product [Aripiprazole tablets 5mg, 10mg (reference), 15mg and 30mg] were 
EMA/CHMP/747323/2015 
Page 14/26 
 
  
  
  
included in the dissolution studies in all three media. The Applicant also tested Aripiprazole Pharmathen against 
Abilify (both at 10mg).

The  dissolution  samples  were  analysed  using  an  high  performance  liquid  chromatography  method.  Each 
dissolution sample was filtered through a 45 μm, 0.310” Filter Discs, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. 
The dissolution profiles for 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets obtained at pH 1.2 and pH 4.5 were similar to those 
for 10 mg tablets. Since more than 85% of the drug was dissolved within 15 minutes at pH 1.2, calculation of the 
similarity  factor  (f2)  was  not  necessary  and  dissolution  profiles  were  accepted  as  similar  in  line  with  the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. As the dissolution rate was slower at pH 4.5, f2 factors were 
calculated. All f2 values were above 50 (61.1, 57.9 and 50.2 for 5mg, 15mg and 30mg Aripiprazole Pharmathen 
tablets  as  well  as  50.9  for  Abilify  10mg  tablets),  supporting  similarity  with  Aripiprazole  Pharmathen  10  mg 
tablets at this pH. 
All  four  strengths  of  Aripipirazole  Pharmathen  as  well  as  Abilify  10  mg  tablets  had  very  limited  solubility  at 
pH 6.8. The dissolved drug amount ranged from 1.9% to 8.1% within 45 min and a high variability in dissolution 
rate  was  observed.  The  f2  factors  could  thus  not  be  calculated.  Aripiprazole  is  a  drug  with  basic  character 
(pKa: 7.6)  with  a  pH-dependent  solubility  that  decreases  with  increasing  pH.  As  expected,  both  test  and 
reference formulations showed very limited solubility at pH 6.8. 
The Applicant justified the choice of the 10 mg tablet strength for the BE studies with the risk of life-threatening 
adverse events (AE) attributed to acute laryngeal dystonia which have been reported following administration of 
a single dose of 30 mg aripiprazole to healthy volunteers in BE studies. In section 4.8 of the SmPC of Abilify, 
dystonia is included as a class effect, stating that symptoms of dystonia may occur in susceptible individuals 
during the first few days of treatment. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently 
and  with  greater  severity  with  high  potency  and  at  higher  doses  of  first  generation  antipsychotic  drugs.  An 
elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.  
Conclusions 
The CHMP considered that the requirements for a biowaiver for the 5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg strengths were met. 
Comparative  in-vitro  dissolution  studies  were  performed  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of 
EMA/CHMP/747323/2015 
Page 15/26 
 
  
  
  
 
Bioequivalence. Based on the result of these studies, similarity of the dissolution profiles of the 5 mg, 15 mg and 
30 mg tablet strengths with the 10 mg tablets could be concluded.  
The choice of the 10 mg tablets over the higher 15 and 30 mg strengths for the BE studies was also considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. In line with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, lower strengths may 
be selected for safety reasons. The CHMP considered that there was a risk of adverse reactions of dystonia, 
which increases with dose, thus justifying selection of the 10 mg tablet strength for the BE study in heathy 
subjects. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Study BA13541220-01: An open label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover, 
balanced, single dose oral bioequivalence study of Aripiprazole Tablets 10 mg of Pharmathen S.A., Greece and 
‘ABILIFY’ (Aripiprazole) Tablets 10 mg of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd, UK in healthy adult human 
subjects under fasting conditions.  
Methods 
Study design  
This was an open label, randomised, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover, balanced, single 
dose oral BE study in healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting conditions comparing 10 mg tablets of the 
test and reference products. The study was conducted at Cliantha Research Ltd., Ahmedabad, India. 
In each study period, subjects were administered a single 10 mg oral dose of investigational product in the 
morning with approximately 240 ml of water after an overnight fasting of at least 8 hours. The washout period 
was at least 45 days which is more than 5 times the half-life of Aripiprazole (elimination half-life of 75 hours in 
extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and 146 hours in slow metabolisers of CYP2D6). 
Blood samples were collected at pre-dose (0.0 hours) and at intervals over 72.0 hours  after dosing in  each 
period. A total of 26 venous blood samples were collected at pre-dose, and 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 
3.0, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, 36.0, 48.0 and 72.0 hours post 
dose.

Population studied   
A total of 44 healthy volunteers aged 45-63 years were randomised to the study to ensure dosing of a total of 
40 subjects. After administration of the dose in a sufficient number of subjects in Period I of the study, the 
remaining four subjects who were not dosed were checked out from the facility. The subjects included were all 
non-smoker Asian males. 
Of  the  40  subjects  who  were  included  in  the  study,  38  subjects  completed  both  periods  of  the  study,  and 
received a single oral dose of the assigned formulation on day 1 and day 45. Two subjects withdrew from the 
study;  one  subject  discontinued  during  Period  II  on  his  own  accord,  and  one  subject  was  withdrawn  during 
Period I due to a single episode of vomiting. 
Consequently, results from 38 subjects were included in the PK and statistical analysis. 
Analytical methods   
Concentrations  of  aripiprazole  were  determined  using  a  validated  high-performance 
liquid 
chromatography/electrospray  ionization  tandem  mass  spectrometry  method  with  turbo  ion  source.  A 
deuterated analogue of aripiprazole (aripiprazole-d8) was used as internal standard. The analyte aripiprazole 
and  internal  standard  was  extracted  using  a  liquid-liquid  extraction  technique.  Linearity  of  the  method  was 
shown in the range of 0.5-200 ng/ml. A linear regression model weighted 1/X2 was used to obtain the best fit 
of the data for the calibration curves. 
A total of 2038 plasma samples obtained from 38 subjects were analysed. A total of 121 samples (5.94% of all 
samples) were re-analysed; 104 samples due to analytical batch failure, 16 samples due to inconsistent internal 
standard  area,  and  1  sample  due  to  high  baseline  value.  The  re-analyses  were  performed  and  reported 
according to a predefined standard operation procedure. 
The validation of the method and bioanalysis was conducted at Veeda Clinical Research Pvt. Ltd., Ahmedabad 
India. 
PK variables  
The primary PK parameters calculated were AUC0-72h, cmax and t max. The PK parameters were evaluated using a 
standard non-compartmental approach.  
Statistical methods   
Statistical comparison of the ln-transformed c max and AUC0-72h was based on the ANOVA model, and was carried 
out using SAS® Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., USA) by PROC MIXED. The treatment, period and sequence 
effects were included in the model as fixed effects, and subject within sequence as a random effect. All main 
effects were tested at the 0.05 level of significance using mean square error as the error term.

The  90%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  of  the  relative  mean  of  cmax  and  AUC0-72h    of  the  test  and  reference 
formulation  for  ln-transformed  data  should  be  within  80.00%  to  125.00%  for  aripiprazole  to  establish 
bioequivalence. 
Results 
The  results  for  the  test  product  (Aripiprazole  Pharmathen  10  mg  tablets)  and  the  reference  product  (Abilify 
10 mg tablets) are summarised in table 2 and 3 below.

The ANOVA test did not detect any statistically significant difference between the test and reference formulation 
for the PK parameters investigated. The 90% CIs of the geometric least square mean ratio for AUC0-72h and cmax 
were within the acceptance range of 80-125%.  
Safety data 
A total of two adverse events (AEs) were reported in two subjects during the entire study. These were events of 
vomiting and headache. Both AEs were mild in nature. None of the AEs experienced by the subjects during this 
study were judged as serious. One subject discontinued due to AE of vomiting. 
Both test and reference products were well tolerated by study subjects. There were no serious AEs reported 
during this study.  
Conclusions 
Based on the presented BE study, Aripiprazole Pharmathen 10 mg tablets are considered bioequivalent with 
Abilify 10 mg tablets. Furthermore, the results of study BA13541220-01 with the 10 mg tablet formulation can 
be extrapolated to the other strengths applied for, as relevant conditions provided for in the Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence were met.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The design of study BA13541220-01 was considered by the CHMP to be appropriate to investigate 
bioequivalence between immediate release formulations. The washout period, sampling period and analyte 
(patent compound) were considered adequate. Furthermore, since intake of aripiprazole tablets is 
recommended on an empty stomach, it was considered appropriate and in line with the Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence that the study was conducted under fasting conditions. The population and 
sample size were considered acceptable. 
The batch size of the test product was also acceptable, as it corresponded to 1/10 of the maximum proposed 
commercial size. The analytical method was adequately validated, including pre-study and within-study 
validations. Incurred samples re-analysis was performed and confirmed reliability of the initial results. 
The PK parameters investigated were appropriate. Considering the long elimination half-life of aripiprazole and 
that the concentrations at 72 hours were quantifiable, it was considered by the CHMP to be sufficient to report 
AUC truncated at 72 hours. Individual plasma concentration curves obtained in the study revealed that the 
absorption and distribution phase was sufficiently covered within 72 hours post-dose. 
Based on the results of the study, bioequivalence between the test and reference products has been adequately 
demonstrated with respect to the rate and extent of absorption. The CHMP however noted that both CIs lay 
completely in the upper part of the acceptance range. Furthermore, as there were concerns regarding reliability 
of the plasma concentrations used for calculation of the PK data for one subject, the 90% CIs for AUC0-72h and 
cmax were re-calculated, using the original concentrations obtained. The re-calculated 90% CIs still lay within the 
acceptance range of 80-125%, confirming the bioequivalence of the test and reference products with respect to 
the rate and extent of absorption. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the available data, the CHMP concluded that bioequivalence of Aripiprazole Pharmathen 10 mg tablets 
to Abilify 10 mg tablets had been demonstrated. As all criteria for a biowaiver were met, the CHMP agreed that 
the results of the BE study could be extrapolated to the other tablet strengths applied for. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
The CHMP considers that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the requirements 
and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for 
pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction suspected of 
occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet for Aripiprazole Pharmathen 5 mg, 
10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to 
Aripiprazole Pharmathen orodispersible tablets. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found 
acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Aripiprazole tablets. The reference product Abilify is indicated for 
the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years and older, treatment of moderate to 
severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in adults who 
experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment as 
well as treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 
13 years and older. 
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well 
as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects 
based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis of the application. The study design was considered adequate 
to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. 
The test formulation of Aripiprazole Pharmathen 10 mg tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with Abilify 10 mg tablets. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was 
demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Aripiprazole Pharmathen in the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents 
aged 15 years and older, treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the 
prevention of a new manic episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic 
episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment as well as treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic 
episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older is favourable and therefore recommends 
the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

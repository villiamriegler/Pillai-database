Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Paliperidone Janssen 
paliperidone 
On 23 October 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a 
positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation based on an informed 
consent application for the medicinal product Paliperidone Janssen (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 
mg, 150mg/100mg, prolonged-release suspension for injection). Paliperidone Janssen is intended 
for treatment of schizophrenia. The applicant for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag 
International NV.  
The active substance of Paliperidone Janssen is paliperidone, a psycholeptic antipsychotic  
(N05 AX13). Paliperidone palmitate is a pro-drug of paliperidone, an active breakdown product 
(metabolite) of risperidone, another antipsychotic medicine that has been used in the treatment of 
schizophrenia since the 1990s. Based on its receptor pharmacology, the efficacy of paliperidone is 
mediated through a combined antagonist activity at D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. 
The benefits with Paliperidone Janssen are its ability to reduce symptoms of schizophrenia and 
prevent the occurrence of new symptoms of schizophrenia in long term use. 
The approved indication is: 
“Paliperidone Janssen is indicated for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients 
stabilised with paliperidone or risperidone. In selected adult patients with schizophrenia and 
previous responsiveness to oral paliperidone or risperidone, Paliperidone Janssen may be used 
without prior stabilisation with oral treatment if psychotic symptoms are mild to moderate and a 
long-acting injectable treatment is needed.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be 
issued 67 days from adoption of the opinion.

favourable benefit-to-risk balance for Paliperidone Janssen and therefore recommends the granting 
of the marketing authorisation.

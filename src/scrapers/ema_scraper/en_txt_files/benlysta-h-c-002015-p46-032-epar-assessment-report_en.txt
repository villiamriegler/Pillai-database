•
Study 213210, “An Observational Study to Evaluate the Safety of 
Belimumab in Chinese patients”
Description
Study 213210 was a multicentre, observational study assessing the safety of belimumab in Chinese
patients who have been prescribed belimumab for appropriate medical use based on investigator’s 
judgement. 
Eligible patients were observed when they first start belimumab treatment, while the patients who had 
been previously treated with belimumab also were included. The investigator enrolled all eligible 
patients during the predefined surveillance period, unless the patient refuses to be enrolled. All 
patients were followed up by the treating investigator according to the clinical need. Investigators 
collected all data at routine clinical visits. The total duration of safety monitoring was 24 weeks.

Randomisation and blinding (masking)
Not applicable for an observational study.
Statistical Methods
A descriptive approach was used and no formal hypothesis was planned for this study.
All enrolled patients who were receiving belimumab treatment during this study period were included in 
the analysis. All analyses were performed by SAS version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Participants who prematurely withdrew from study were not be replaced. 
Confidence intervals were use 95% confidence levels unless otherwise specified. Unless otherwise 
specified, continuous data were summarized using descriptive statistics: n, mean, standard deviation 
(std), median, minimum and maximum. Categorical data were summarized as the number and 
percentage of participants in each category. For partial dates, if only the date was missing with 
complete year and month, the date were imputed using “15th”; if the month or year was partial then 
the date were set to missing. Missing relatedness data were handled using the worst-case scenario. 
Other missing data were not imputed and set to missing, otherwise specified.

Adverse events in paediatric patients
Of the 417 patients in the enrolled population, a total of 14 (3.4%) were paediatric patients (< 18 
years). Of the 417 patients in the safety population, 6 paediatric patients experienced 14 AEs, 2 
paediatric patients experienced 3 SAEs (Cerebral thrombosis, oedema and rash, which outcome were 
recovering), 1 paediatric patient experienced 1 AESI.
CHMP comment:
Of the 417 patients in the enrolled population, a total of 14 (3.4%) were paediatric patients (< 18 
years). Overall, AEs were reported in 6/14 paediatric patients (42.9%) and SAEs were reported in 
2/14 patients (14.3%). This is slightly higher incidence rates than in the overall population, however 
given the low number of paediatric patients no firm conclusions can be drawn from the comparison. 
Narratives were provided only for serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug. 
Among these, none were paediatric patients. Therefore, no details could be found on the SAEs in 
paediatric patients briefly summarised and by the CHMP commented on below:

Cerebral thrombosis (possibly related to the SLE itself rather than the treatment)
 Oedema (unspecific, could have many causes)


Rash (could also be related to the SLE)
AESI without further specification (not possible to further assess). 
Overall, no new safety signals were identified among paediatric patients treated with Benlysta. 
Pregnancies
The study population included female patients of child-bearing potential and one female patient 
(belimumab treated) was reported to be pregnant in the study. The patient did not have a delivery 
prior to database lock, and did not experience any safety events.
Conclusion by the MAH
The MAH concludes that no new safety signals for belimumab have been observed and no additional 
risk management measures need to be enforced. However, the MAH will routinely conduct 
pharmacovigilance data collection and the drug safety monitoring work. The MAH states that overall, 
belimumab has shown favourable safety and tolerability in real-world use in Chinese patients,
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects
Belimumab is a human immunoglobulin-G1λ monoclonal antibody that inhibits
B lymphocyte stimulator protein, a member of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ligand
superfamily that promotes the survival of B lymphocytes. Benlysta is approved for treatment of adult 
and paediatric patients with SLE, and for adult patients with lupus nephritis.
Benlysta (IV formulation) is indicated as add-on therapy in patients aged 5 years and older with active, 
autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease activity (e.g., 
positive anti-dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.

Methods
Study 213210 was a multicentre, observational study assessing the safety of belimumab in Chinese
patients who have been prescribed belimumab for appropriate medical use based on investigator’s 
judgement. 
Eligible patients were observed when they first start belimumab treatment, while the patients who had 
been previously treated with belimumab also were included. The investigator enrolled all eligible 
patients during the predefined surveillance period, unless the  patient refuses to be enrolled. Since this 
was a non-interventional study and was observational in nature, all the enrolled patients were followed 
up by the treating investigator according to the clinical need. Data generated as a result of clinical 
practice, if any, were captured. Investigators collected all data at routine clinical visits. The total 
duration of safety monitoring was 24 weeks. 
Patients eligible for enrolment in the study must meet all the following criteria:
3. Patients who had been prescribed belimumab by investigators for their medical condition.
4. Capable of giving signed informed consent, which included compliance with the requirements 
and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in protocol.
The objective of this study was to monitor and evaluate the real-world safety profile of belimumab 
treatment. The safety information of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
occurring in the observation period were collected and analyzed. A descriptive approach was used and 
no formal hypothesis was planned for this study.
Results
Overall population
A total of 418 patients were enrolled. Of these, 417 patients were included in safety population. Of the 
417 patients in the enrolled population, a total of 14 (3.4%) were paediatric patients (< 18 years).
Of the 417 patients included in the safety population, a total of 158 (37.9%) patients experienced 336 
AEs and 22 (5.3%) patients experienced 35 SAEs. The most frequently reported AEs by SOC were 
infections and infestations (14.6%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (6.7%), skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (6.2%), and gastrointestinal disorders (5.8%). 
There were no deaths in the study.
The most frequently reported SAEs by SOC were infections and infestations (1.2%) and nervous 
system disorders (1.0%). 
Paediatric population
A total of 14 patients(3.4%) were paediatric (< 18 years). AEs were reported in 6/14 paediatric 
patients (42.9%) and SAEs were reported in 2/14 patients (14.3%). This is slightly higher incidence 
rates than in the overall population, however given the low number of paediatric patients no firm 
conclusions can be drawn from the comparison. 
Narratives were provided only for serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug.


Rash (could also be related to the SLE)
AESI without further specification (not possible to further assess). 
Overall, no new safety signals were identified among paediatric patients treated with Benlysta. 
“Limited data on long-term safety in paediatric patients” is included as missing information in the 
Benlysta RMP. A dedicated paediatric safety study is ongoing (category 3):
More safety data on the use of Benlysta in paediatric patients is expected in future PSURs and when 
the final report from the PLUTO study is provided.
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation
The MAH has within this P46 submitted the final results from study 213210 which was a multicentre, 
observational study assessing the safety of belimumab in Chinese patients. The study included 418 
patients, whereof a total of 14 (3.4%) were paediatric patients (< 18 years). 
AEs were reported in 6/14 paediatric patients (42.9%) and SAEs were reported in 2/14 patients 
(14.3%). This is slightly higher incidence rates than in the overall population, however given the low 
number of paediatric patients no firm conclusions can be drawn from the comparison. 
“Limited data on long-term safety in paediatric patients” is included as missing information in the 
Benlysta RMP. A dedicated paediatric safety study is ongoing (category 3). More safety data on the use 
of Benlysta in paediatric patients is expected in future PSURs and when the final report from the PLUTO 
study is provided.
Based on the information submitted, the CHMP concluded that no update of the product information for 
Benlysta is required.
  Fulfilled:
No regulatory action required.

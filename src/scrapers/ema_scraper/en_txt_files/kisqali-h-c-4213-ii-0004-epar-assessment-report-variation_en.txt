Extension of Indication to include treatment of patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in 
combination with fulvestrant for Kisqali; in pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy 
(aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) should be combined with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone 
(LHRH) agonist. The extension to the indication is based upon data from study CLEE011E2301 (A Phase III 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of LEE011 or placebo in combination with tamoxifen and 
goserelin or a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) and goserelin for the treatment of premenopausal 
women with hormone receptor positive, HER2- negative, advanced breast cancer) and study CLEE011F2301 
(A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the 
treatment of men and postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, advanced 
breast cancer who have received no or only one line of prior endocrine treatment). As a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been updated and the 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some 
editorial changes in the SmPC and to make an administrative update to the Estonian and Latvian local 
representatives addresses in the Package Leaflet. An updated RMP version 2.0 was submitted as part of the 
application. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related 
to the proposed indication.

2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and the most frequent among women. An 
estimated 1.67 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide in 2012 (representing around 
25% of all cancers in women) and approximately 522,000 deaths were recorded1. In EU there were 3.7 
million new cases of breast cancer, and 1.9 million cancer deaths and 9.7 million people living with cancer 
(within 5 years of diagnosis) in 20122. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Breast cancer is a molecularly diverse disease with several clearly defined molecular subgroups3. There are 
three well described subtypes: hormone receptor (HR) positive (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor 
positive), HER-2 positive and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The predominant subset is HR-positive, 
HER2-negative disease. The expression of these biological markers in breast cancer is correlated with 
prognosis and response to treatment, and therefore plays an important role in treatment decisions. 
2.1.4. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The diagnosis of breast cancer is based on clinical examination in combination with imaging, and confirmed 
by pathological assessment. Clinical examination includes bimanual palpation of the breasts and 
locoregional lymph nodes and assessment for distant metastases (bones, liver and lungs; a neurological 
examination is only required when symptoms are present)4. 
Of the new breast cancer cases diagnosed worldwide each year, roughly 60% to 65% are HR-positive, 20% 
to 25% are HER2-positive, and 15% to 18% are triple-negative (Estrogen receptor-negative, Progesterone 
receptor-negative, HER2-negative)5.  
Metastatic breast cancer is an incurable disease with a median overall survival of 2~3 years and a 5-year 
survival of only~25%. Median overall survival in patients with advanced breast cancer patients with tumours 
expressing the estrogen receptor (ER) but not the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 is 
approximately 2.5 to 4 years.  
2.1.5. Management 
Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients derive benefit mainly from systemic treatments. 
Endocrine therapy remains the therapeutic backbone for the treatment of HR+ cancers. For postmenopausal 
women with HR+ advanced breast cancer, the endocrine therapy options include, but are not limited to, 
selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM; e.g. tamoxifen), estrogen receptor antagonists (e.g. 
fulvestrant), selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI; e.g. anastrozole and letrozole) and 
steroidal aromatase inhibitors (e.g. exemestane). TTP/PFS in the range of 5- 15 (20) months is typical in 
endocrine therapy trials in the postmenopausal population (Kümler ESMO Open 2016). Endocrine therapy 
may be given in first, second or later lines of therapy for advanced breast cancer6,7.  
Recently, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors were approved in this setting. Palbociclib (Ibrance), 
ribociclib (Kisqali) and abemaciclib (Verzenios) are authorised as an add-on to endocrine therapy. Palbociclib 
and abemaciclib are both approved in combination with AI or fulvrestrant while Kisqali is approved in 
combination with AI.

Progressive disease ultimately develops in all patients, either as early failure to respond to endocrine 
therapy (primary or de novo resistance) or as relapse/progression following an initial response (acquired 
resistance). According to treatment guidelines, chemotherapy should be reserved for cases of rapidly 
progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance2,3. Single agent chemotherapy is preferred, as no overall 
survival benefit has been demonstrated for combinations. Anthracyclines or taxanes would usually be 
considered 1st line, if not administered in the (neo) adjuvant setting. Capecitabine and vinorelbine are 
options for patients that have received anthracyclines or taxanes, and can thus be used in the 1st or 2nd line 
metastatic setting. Eribulin is approved for breast cancer patients who have progressed after ≥1 
chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced disease, and have previously received an anthracycline and a 
taxane.  
About the product 
Ribociclib is a selective inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) 
values of 0.01 (4.3 ng/ml) and 0.039 μM (16.9 ng/ml) in biochemical assays, respectively. These kinases are 
activated upon binding to D cyclins and play a crucial role in signalling pathways which lead to cell cycle 
progression and cellular proliferation. The cyclin D CDK4/6 complex regulates cell cycle progression through 
phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). 
Ribociclib was approved on 22 August 2017 and is indicated in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for 
the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer as initial endocrine-based 
therapy. Authorisation was based on the results of a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, 
multicentre phase III clinical study (CLEE011A2301/MONALEESA-2) conducted in the treatment of 
postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, advanced breast cancer who 
received no prior therapy for advanced disease in combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone. This 
study showed statistically significant improvement in PFS in patients receiving Kisqali plus letrozole 
compared to patients receiving placebo plus letrozole in the full analysis set (hazard ratio of 0.556, 95% CI: 
0.429, 0.720, one sided stratified log rank test p value 0.00000329). 
With the present variation, the applicant applied for an extension of indication to include the combination 
with fulvestrant and extend the population to premenopausal women and men: 
“Kisqali in combination with an aromatase inhibitor is indicated for the treatment 
of patients postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase 
inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine based therapy. 
In pre  or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinising hormone 
releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.” 
The recommended indication is as follows: 
“Kisqali is indicated for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with 
an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women who have received 
prior endocrine therapy. 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinising 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.” 
The recommended dose is 600 mg (three 200 mg film coated tablets) of ribociclib once daily for 21 
consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment, resulting in a complete cycle of 28 days. The treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 9/136 
 
  
  
 
should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy or until unacceptable 
toxicity occurs. 
Kisqali should be used together with 2.5 mg letrozole or another aromatase inhibitor or with 500 mg 
fulvestrant. 
When Kisqali is used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, the aromatase inhibitor should be taken 
orally once daily continuously throughout the 28 day cycle. Please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) of the aromatase inhibitor for additional details. 
When Kisqali is used in combination with fulvestrant, fulvestrant is administered intramuscularly on days 1, 
15 and 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the SmPC of fulvestrant for additional details. 
Treatment of pre- and perimenopausal women with the approved Kisqali combinations should also include 
an LHRH agonist in accordance with local clinical practice. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Scientific Advice was received regarding study CLEE011E2301/MONALEESA-7, adopted by CHMP in 
November 2014 (EMEA/H/SA/2912/1/2014/II) and pertaining to the following points: 
• 
• 
• 
The overall study design, to study premenopausal women with HR+, HER2-negative, advanced 
breast cancer who received no prior endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer, treated with 
ribociclib or placebo + NSAI/tamoxifen + goserelin was accepted. 
PFS was accepted, if BIRC indicates that there is no relevant bias in the investigator assessment of 
progression, it was considered appropriate to use investigator data in the primary analysis. 
It was assumed that patients will be followed not only for survival, but also for PFS2 in line with the 
Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4) 
The planned final analysis was to be conducted after 329 events. The second interim analysis for 
efficacy was discussed with regard to risk of not having a stable result (too few events in the control 
arm; at an event rate of about 60% in the control group, data were considered sufficiently likely to 
be stable.) 
•  Comments were made on the proposed OS-analyses. In the advice given it was pointed out that it 
appeared less wise to define the “final” OS analysis at an event rate slightly higher than 50% of the 
events in the long run. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted non-clinical data from new pharmacology studies as well as from previously submitted 
ones. Furthermore, the results of a new female fertility and early embryonic development study and from an 
additional 1 week repeat dose toxicity study in rats were presented.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Combination of ribociclib with letrozole in a primary ER+ breast cancer patient derived xenograft model in 
mice (RD-2015-00085) (see EPAR Kisqali) 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 10/136 
 
  
  
 
In a primary ER+ breast cancer xenograft model (HBCx-34) derived from a patient tumor, ribociclib (75 
mg/kg/day) in combination with letrozole (at 2.5 mg/kg/day), a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI), 
both dosed orally every day for 55 days, induced greater tumour growth inhibition than each agent alone. 
The combination of ribociclib and letrozole demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.001 compared with 
vehicle controls) antitumor activity with complete tumour growth inhibition, and 2 out of 10 partial and 2 out 
of 10 complete tumour regressions. Tumour regrowth was delayed for 33 days after stopping dosing (see 
EPAR Kisqali). 
Combination of ribociclib with tamoxifen or ribociclib with fulvestrant in a primary ER+ breast cancer tumour 
xenograft model (studies reports RD-2015-00701 and RD-2016-00052) 
Combination of ribociclib with other endocrine therapies used in breast cancer treatment, namely tamoxifen, 
a selective ER modulator (SERM); or fulvestrant, an ER antagonist, was also evaluated.  
Combination of ribociclib (75 mg/kg/day) and tamoxifen (1 mg/kg/day) was assessed in an ER+ breast 
cancer patient derived xenograft model (HBCx-34). When dosed orally once daily for 55 days, the 
combination treatment induced a very strong and statistically significant (p<0.001 compared with vehicle 
controls) tumour growth inhibition with 7 out of 10 partial tumour regressions and 3 out of 10 complete 
tumour regressions (study report RD-2015-00701). 
Compared to each agent alone, the combination of ribociclib plus tamoxifen resulted in an enhanced 
antitumor activity with sustained tumour regression and was well tolerated. In the ZR751 ER+ human breast 
cancer xenograft model, combination of ribociclib (75 mg/kg/day) with fulvestrant (5 mg/kg, once weekly) 
induced complete tumour growth inhibition (study report RD-2016-00052). 
Pharmacodynamic effect of combination treatments of ribociclib plus tamoxifen or ribociclib plus fulvestrant 
(study report RD-2017-00236) 
Pharmacodynamic markers of ribociclib namely of phospho-pRb and total pRb were assessed in ER+ human 
breast cancer cell lines, T47D, ZR-75-1 and EMF19, and in ZR-75-1 xenograft tumor samples.  
After 24 hours of treatment, ribociclib reduced phospho-pRb, tamoxifen and fulvestrant as single agents had 
no or very minor effects dependent on the cell lines; however, the inhibition effect of the combinations was 
stronger. After 6 days, only combination treatment maintained a strong suppression of phospho-pRb, while 
single agents including ribociclib only had partial suppression. A reduction of total pRb protein was also 
detectable under the same conditions, although it appeared less pronounced. 
After 6 days, only the combinations maintained a strong suppression of phospho-pRb across all cell lines, 
while pRb phosphorylation partially recovered in samples treated with ribociclib alone. 
The effects of the same treatments as above in ZR-75-1 xenograft tumour samples showed no consistent 
effect of single agent treatments observed in ZR-75-1 tumours after 6 days of treatment, while 
combinations strongly reduced phospho-pRb with a concomitant decrease in total pRb. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Ribociclib and LEQ803, a prominent metabolite of ribociclib, were assessed for their off-target activity on G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes. For 
ribociclib, activities were found on phosphodiesterase PDE4d (IC50 = 0.59 µM, n=2), rat vesicular 
monoamine transporter VMAT2 (IC50  = 6.3 µM, n=2), orexin-2 receptor (70% inhibition at 10 µM) and 
apelin receptor (54% inhibition at 10 µM). For LEQ803, activities were found on phosphodiesterase PDE4d 
(IC50 = 0.6 µM), serotonin 5HT3 channel (IC50 = 2.63 µM), neuronal nicotinic alpha 2 channel (IC50 = 5.7 
µM), cannabinoid CB1 receptor (IC50 = 28 µM), peripheral rat imidazoline I2 receptor (71% inhibition at 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018

10 µM), rabbit monoamine transporter VMAT2 (84% inhibition at 10 µM) and rat brain sodium channel site 
II (70% inhibition at 10 µM).  
Newly presented data8 reported central nervous system penetration of ribociclib in non-tumor bearing mice 
and mice bearing orthotopic pediatric brain tumors. Taking into consideration these newly published data 
and in order to assess the effects of ribociclib or LEQ803 from interactions with targets expressed in the 
central nervous system, the free brain concentrations had to be estimated. Using a one compartment 
plasma model with two-compartment tumor model fitted to all data using NONMEM (Patel 2016) ribociclib 
free concentration in the brain were estimated to be 12% of the free concentration in plasma. At therapeutic 
doses (600 mg), mean free plasma concentration of ribociclib was 1.2 µM (as reported in the summary of 
clinical pharmacology of the original dossier), corresponding to a free brain concentration of 0.144 µM. With 
the exception of PDE4 (ratio IC50/brain free Cmax = 4.1), exposure margins were >20 for all the previously 
identified secondary targets. 
2.2.3.  Toxicology  
Table 1: Overview of toxicology studies 
Repeat dose toxicity  
In order to better estimate an appropriate high dose in female rats for the two year carcinogenicity study an 
additional female rat toleration study was conducted (study 1770546).  
In this non-GLP study, ribociclib was administered daily orally to groups of 5 female rats at dosages of 600 
and 1200 mg/kg/day during a 7-day period. 
Hematology changes were consistent with minimal to mild suppression of hematopoiesis related to CDK4/6 
inhibition and to an acute phase protein response (lower albumin concentration and lower albumin:globulin 
ratio), slightly higher creatinine and/or lower cholesterol concentration. 
Histopathological findings were observed at > 600 mg/kg/day in the gastrointestinal tract (ulceration of the 
epithelium and submucosal infiltration of neutrophils in stomach, duodenum, and ileum) which 
macroscopically correlated with raised or ulcerated areas in the stomach; the liver (bile duct epithelium 
vacuolation and reduced inflammatory cell infiltrations), lung (increased alveolar macrophages and reduced 
inflammatory cell infiltrations), spleen (reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis), and mesenteric lymph 
node (histiocytosis and reduced germinal center development).

The macroscopic and microscopic changes in the gastrointestinal tract were clearly dose dependent and 
indicative of poor local tolerance of ribociclib at ≥ 600 mg/kg/day. While slight effects on the gastrointestinal 
tract have been seen in a 2-week dog toxicity study, they were absent in the 15- and 27-week toxicity 
studies where females rats were treated up to 300 mg/kg/day. Similar macroscopic changes have also been 
observed in the rat embryo-fetal development study at 1000 mg/kg/day. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development study in the rat (study 1570198) 
The purpose of this GLP study (Study 1570198) was to test for potential toxic effects/disturbances resulting 
from ribociclib treatment of female Wistar Hannover (Crl:WI [Han]) rats before cohabitation, through mating 
and implantation. This study evaluated ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline stages A and B of the 
reproductive process and was intended to detect effects on the estrous cycle, tubal transport, implantation, 
and development of preimplantation stages of the embryos of females and permit detection of functional 
effects (e.g., effects on libido) that may not be detected by histological examinations of female reproductive 
organs. 
Ribociclib formulated in 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose 400 cPs, aqueous solution, was administered by oral 
gavage (5 mL/kg) to 3 groups of 24 rats at dose levels of 50, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day for 14 days prior to 
cohabitation, during cohabitation and through day 6 postcoitum. Another group of 24 female rats received 
the vehicle and served as controls. The rats were obtained from Charles River, Kingston, New York, USA. The 
females were 11 to 12 weeks of age and weighed 186 to 222 g at the start of dosing. The following 
parameters were evaluated: cage side observations, detailed clinical examinations on days of body weight 
assessments (twice weekly during the premating period and on days 0, 3, 6, 9, and 13 postcoitum for mated 
females); twice weekly food consumption, estrous cycling (for 14 consecutive days beginning with the first 
day of dosing), macroscopic observations and ovarian and uterine examinations on day 13 postcoitum. 
There was no ribociclib-related mortality, nor any adverse clinical signs. 
Body weight parameters and food consumption were unaffected by the administration of ribociclib. There 
were no ribociclib-related gross pathological findings. 
Administration of ribociclib had no effect upon estrous cycles or parental performance (mean day to mating, 
the mating, fertility, gestation indices or conception rate). The ovarian and uterine parameters assessed 
were not affected by the administration of ribociclib. 
2.2.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The planned extension of the Kisqali indication was considered in the marketing forecast provided at the time 
of initial marketing authorization in the ERA. As part of the present application, the MAH provided an update 
ERA with updated forecast figures. However these did not change significantly from the estimates used in 
the initial Kisqali ERA. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH presented data on primary pharmacodynamics supporting the combination of ribociclib with 
tamoxifen or fulvestrant. 
In vivo antitumour activity of ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant was assessed in immune deficient 
mice bearing the ZR751 ER+ human breast cancer xenografts and the combination with fulvestrant resulted 
in complete tumour growth inhibition. The SmPC has been updated to reflect this new data and to clarify that 
in the preclinical models tested so far, intact pRb was required for ribociclib activity (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 13/136 
 
  
  
The MAH also analysed the possibility for off target activity in the CNS with a number of targets previously 
identified in a conventional secondary pharmacology screen. Based on mouse data on CNS distribution in 
mice, this analysis showed that centrally-mediated untoward effects resulting from interactions with targets 
expressed in the central nervous system are unlikely to develop in humans. 
The MAH explored the possibility to use higher doses than those tested in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity 
studies. At the highest dose in these studies, there was limited toxicity and the exposure at the high dose in 
female rats was similar to clinical exposure. It is agreed that the findings in the 1 week rat study suggest that 
a higher dose (>300 mg/kg) is unlikely to be tolerated in a longer study. 
The effects in the spleen, mesenteric lymph node, liver and lung observed in this study were in accordance 
to previous repeat dose toxicity studies and correlated well with the findings in clinical pathology.  
A new study on fertility and embryonic development in female rats was presented. In this study in female 
rats, ribociclib did not affect reproductive function, fertility or early embryonic development at any dose up 
to 300 mg/kg/day (which is likely at an exposure lower than or equal to patients’ clinical exposure at the 
highest recommended dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC) (see SmPC section 5.3). 
No toxicokinetic study was performed. However exposure at the high dose 300 mg/kg was similar to clinical 
exposure in the rat repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Data on developmental and reproductive toxicity were assessed within the initial MAA procedure (see 
below). Considering the proposed indication is now covering pre-menopausal women, the SmPC sections 4.6 
and 5.3 have been updated to reflect adequate information with regards to pregnancy, breast-feeding and 
fertility. 
Ribociclib showed foetotoxicity and teratogenicity at doses which did not show maternal toxicity in the rats 
or rabbits. Following prenatal exposure, increased incidences of post-implantation loss and reduced foetal 
weights were observed in rats. Reduced foetal weights were accompanied by skeletal changes considered to 
be transitory and/or related to the lower foetal weights. In rabbits, ribociclib was teratogenic at exposures 
lower than or 1.5 times the exposure in humans, respectively, at the highest recommended dose of 
600 mg/day based on AUC (see EPAR Kisqali and SmPC section 5.3). There were adverse effects on 
embryo-foetal development in rabbits as evidenced by increased incidences of foetal abnormalities 
(malformations and external, visceral and skeletal variants) and foetal growth (lower foetal weights). These 
findings included reduced/small lung lobes and additional vessel on the aortic arch and diaphragmatic 
hernia, absent accessory lobe or (partly) fused lung lobes and reduced/small accessory lung lobe (30 and 60 
mg/kg), extra/rudimentary thirteenth ribs and misshapen hyoid bone and reduced number of phalanges in 
the pollex. There was no evidence of embryo-foetal mortality (see EPAR Kisqali). 
Women of childbearing potential who are receiving Kisqali should use effective contraception (e.g. 
double-barrier contraception) during therapy and for at least 21 days after stopping treatment with Kisqali 
(see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.6).  
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Based on findings in animals, 
ribociclib can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Kisqali is not recommended 
during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception (see SmPC section 4.3).  
Ribociclib has not been evaluated in male fertility studies. However, atrophic changes in testes were 
reported in rat and dog toxicity studies at exposures that were less than or equal to human exposure at the 
highest recommended daily dose of 600 mg/day based on AUC (see SmPC section 5.3). These effects can be 
linked to a direct anti proliferative effects on the testicular germ cells resulting in atrophy of the seminiferous 
tubules (see SmPC section 5.3). A complete reversibility was not demonstrated. There are no clinical data 
available regarding effects of ribociclib on fertility. However, based on the testis toxicity ribociclib may impair 
fertility in males of reproductive potential (see EPAR Kisqali and SmPC section 4.6).

Ribociclib and its metabolites readily passed into the milk of lactating rats. The exposure to ribociclib was 
higher in milk than in plasma (see EPAR Kisqali). It is not known if ribociclib is present in human milk. There 
are no data on the effects of ribociclib on the breast-fed infant or the effects of ribociclib on milk production. 
Patient receiving Kisqali should not breast-feed for at least 21 days after the last dose (see SmPC section 
4.6).  
The period of 21 days after treatment with Kisqali is discontinued is considered acceptable as it corresponds 
to approximately 5 ribociclib half-lives.  
The planned extension of the Kisqali indication was considered in the marketing forecast provided at the time 
of initial marketing authorization in the ERA. The MAH provided an update ERA which included an updated 
market forecast. No new ERA study was provided. All PEC/PNEC ratios remained ≤1. In conclusion, while the 
new prediction resulted in a higher market forecast, the new calculations did not result in any suggestion of 
an environmental risk. 
2.2.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data presented are considered sufficient to support of this extension of indication. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of ribociclib. Considering the above data, ribociclib is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
No new information on absorption, distribution, metabolism or elimination was provided in support of this 
application. 
The absolute bioavailability of ribociclib in humans is not known. The time to reach Cmax (Tmax) following 
ribociclib oral administration was between 1 and 4 hours. Ribociclib exhibited slightly over-proportional 
increases in Cmax and AUC across the dose range tested (50 to 1200 mg). Based on a population 
pharmacokinetic model, ribociclib clearance would be 24% higher at 300 mg than at the reference dose (600 
mg). The apparent volume of distribution for ribociclib at steady state (Vss/F) was 1090 L. The metabolism 
of ribociclib appears to be mediated primarily by CYP3A4 (including formation of the major metabolite 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 18/136 
 
  
  
 
 
 
LEQ803) and to a minor extent by FMO3 and (extra-hepatic) FMO1 (including formation of the major 
metabolite CCI284). The geometric mean plasma effective half-life (based on accumulation ratio) was 32.0 
hours (63% CV) and the geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 25.5 l/hr (66% CV) at 
steady-state at 600 mg in patients with advanced cancer.  In vitro and in vivo studies indicated ribociclib is 
eliminated primarily via hepatic metabolism. Ribociclib and its metabolites are eliminated mainly via faeces, 
with a small contribution of the renal route (see EPAR Kisqali).  
In support of this application the MAH provided the following information: 
- Assessment of PK of ribociclib and/or its combination partners from Study E2301 and Study F2301. 
- Assessment of PK of ribociclib from study X2108 (limited data not shown) 
- Assessment of drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential between ribociclib and its combination partners in 
Study E2301 (anastrozole, letrozole or tamoxifen) and F2301 (fulvestrant). 
- Updated evaluation of covariate effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on ribociclib PK based on data in 
Study E2301, Study F2301, and data included in the original MAA. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Non-compartmental analysis 
Method 
The methods of studies E2301, F2301 and X2108 are described in details under the section on clinical 
efficacy. 
In study E2301, ribociclib, tamoxifen, letrozole and anastrozole exposure parameters at C3D15 (Cmax, 
Ctrough and AUC (0-24h for tamoxifen and 0-6h for NSAI)) were assessed (co-administered with ribociclib 
or placebo) to evaluate the impact of ribociclib on each substance pharmacokinetics (PK). Additionally, cycle 
1 and 3, day 15 and plasma concentration of LEQ803 (major metabolite of ribociclib) were assessed at times 
0 and 2 hours (i.e. Ctrough and 2 hours post dose).  
In study F2301, pharmacokinetic blood samples were obtained from patients for the analysis of ribociclib and 
LEQ803. Patients were assigned to the sparse PK collection group (approximately the first 150 patients 
enrolled) or the trough PK collection group (all remaining patients). For sparse PK sampling of 
ribociclib/placebo, blood samples were collected pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 
15, and post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 15 at 2, 4 and 6 h. For trough PK sampling, blood 
samples were collected pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 15. 
The PK analysis set included 498 patients (74.1%) and 406 patients (55.9%) of the total number included 
patients (ribociclib and placebo arms) from study E2301 and F2301, respectively. From the active treatment 
arms, the PK analysis set included 77.6% and 83.9% of the patients from study E2301 and F2301, 
respectively. In study X2108, the PK analysis set included 13 patients. 
Results 
The Cmax, Cthrough and AUC of ribociclib, tamoxifen, letrozole and anastrozole exposure parameters 
reported in study E2301 at Cycle 3 Day 15, when co-administered with ribociclib or placebo, are presented 
in Table 3.  
Ribociclib Ctrough and 2-hours post dose concentration at C1D15 and C3D15 in combination with endocrine 
treatment partner tamoxifen, letrozole and anastrozole from patients with evaluable samples are presented 
in Table 4.  
In general, ribociclib concentrations in combination with tamoxifen were slightly lower than its 
concentrations in combination with a NSAI (letrozole and anastrozole).

administration of 600 mg (3 week on/1 week off) ribociclib with tamoxifen, letrozole, or anastrozole as 
combination partner from Study E2301 (Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set) 
The C1D15 and C3D15 Ctrough and 2-hours post dose LEQ803 concentration (metabolite of ribociclib) were 
largely comparable among the combination partners suggesting no marked differences in LEQ803 exposure 
in presence of tamoxifen, letrozole or anastrozole (Table 5).

600 mg ribociclib with tamoxifen, letrozole, or anastrozole as combination partner from Study E2301 
(Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set) 
In study F2301, the geometric mean ribociclib Ctrough (pre-dose) plasma concentration was 627 ng/mL 
(geometric CV%: 67.6%) on Cycle 1 Day 15 (n=253) and was similar to the geometric mean Ctrough of 553 
ng/mL (geometric CV%: 80.7%) observed on Cycle 2 Day 15 (n=177) at the recommended dose of 600 mg 
ribociclib. The plasma concentrations observed at 2, 4 and 6 hours post dose were also similar between the 
two cycles. On Cycle 2 Day 15, the geometric mean pre-dose concentrations (n=155) was 555 ng/mL 
(geometric CV%: 85.5%). The geometric mean post dose concentrations at 2 hours (n=69) was 
1450 ng/mL (geometric CV%: 84.3%), at 4 hours (n=73) was 1610 ng/mL (geometric CV%: 55.5%), and 
at 6 hours (n=63) was 1270 ng/mL (geometric CV%:94.2%). 
In the phase Ib dose-finding study (X2108), following oral administration of the study treatment, the mean 
peak plasma concentrations for ribociclib were achieved approximately at 4-hour post dose, followed by a 
decline in concentrations over 24 hour dosing interval. Consistent with ribociclib monotherapy PK data, the 
geometric mean Cmax was 967 ng/mL and 1840 ng/mL for Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 1 Day 21, respectively 
(Table 6). Exposure accumulation was observed after repeated ribociclib doses, with geometric mean 
accumulation ratio (Racc) for AUC0-24 of 2.18.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Method 
Modeling was performed using NONMEM 7.3 and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian estimation 
method on log-transformed PK data. The previously developed population pharmacokinetic model was used 
in the population modeling process. It was planned that PopPK parameters previously estimated will serve as 
informative priors for the PopPK analysis. Instead, for those parameters that were in the previous PopPK 
model, the previous estimates were used as weakly informative priors (with 50% CV) because they were 
based on data from studies X1101, X2101, and X2107, which were included in this analysis. The use of 
estimates as weakly informative priors minimized “double-counting” of the data from those 3 studies. For 
the parameters that were newly incorporated and represented covariate effects, non-informative priors 
were assumed. 
The objectives of the population pharmacokinetic modeling were to: update evaluation of covariate effects 
on ribociclib pharmacokinetics, update evaluation of covariate effects on the ANC exposure-response 
relationship associated with ribociclib treatment, generate individual post-hoc longitudinal Ctrough of 
ribociclib to enable exposure-efficacy analyses. 
The data included in the population PK analysis were from studies included in the original application (X1101, 
X2101, X2107, A2301) and from the studies E2301 and F2301. The design and PK sampling schedules for 
the first 4 studies are presented in Table 7. The design and PK sampling from studies E2301 and F2301 are 
presented in ( 
Table 8). The PopPK analysis dataset for covariate evaluation included 7960 PK observations from 1059 
subjects; a breakdown of the statistics by study is listed in Table 9. 
The distribution of intrinsic factors and combination partners in popPK analysis dataset are presented in

The structural PK model and covariate investigation: 
Ribociclib population PK was described using a two compartmental PopPK model with delayed zero-order 
oral absorption and linear clearance from the central compartment. Dose of ribociclib was recognized as a 
structural covariate to account for nonlinearity of ribociclib PK (on CL, Q and V2) in the original analysis and 
was retained in the model.

The effect of pre-specified covariates (Table 13) were investigated using the full covariate model approach, 
where all pre-specified covariates are added simultaneously and subsequently removed based on 
pre-defined criteria. The final model was employed for simulations.  
The use of weak inhibitors was previously found to be statistically insignificant and clinically not important 
(with N=22) (PopPK Report for original MAA); in the preliminary analysis with inclusion of E2301 (before 
F2301 data becoming available), the effect of the yes/weak category was confirmed to be statistically 
insignificant and clinically not important. Hence, the use of CYP3A4 inhibitors was excluded from evaluation. 
Table 13. Pre-specified popPK covariates for evaluation 
Results 
The trace plots indicate MCMC convergence of the full model. The point estimates of the Gelman-Rubin 
statistic (PSRF) were close to 1 and the upper 95% confidence boundaries did not exceed 1.05 which 
indicates that satisfactory MCMC Bayesian convergence was reached.  
The popPK full covariate model included all the covariates except CYP3A4 inhibitors and race by 
categorization 2. The 95% CIs of the covariate effects of eGFR, Race Asian, Race Others, letrozole, and 
fulvestrant were entirely within the ±20% reference ranges, suggesting that these effects were not clinically 
important. For age, the 95% CI extended slightly out of the reference ranges, suggesting it was not clinically

important. For anastrozole on CL/F, there was 25% probability for its effect to be greater than the reference 
range (mean 1.127 (0.936 - 1.353 (95%CI))). The wide CI indicates that there is insufficient information to 
estimate the effect. The distributions of simulated effects of BW on CL, Q, and V2 shrank relative to those in 
the previous analysis. As such, the effect of BW on CL became clinically not important. Among all the 
covariates, BW on Q and V2 (BW_Q, BW_V2) and tamoxifen on CL appeared to be important. Tamoxifen was 
estimated to increase ribociclib apparent clearance by 36.4% (95% CI: 19.9% - 54.3%) (based on 
parameter posterior associated with tamoxifen effect in Figure 4. VPC for final popPK model (at 600 mg 
steady state) 
Table 14). This effect translates to a decrease in the overall exposure of ribociclib by 26.7% (95% CI: 16.6% 
- 35.2%) with concurrent use of tamoxifen.

Special populations 
The PopPK dataset included subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2, N=438), mild 
impairment (60 ≤ eGFR<90 mL/min/1.73m2, N=488), and moderate impairment (30 ≤ eGFR<60 
mL/min/1.73m2, N=113).  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the modification 
of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation. eGFR was investigated as a continuous covariate on ribociclib CL/F. 
The eGFR effect on ribociclib CL/F was estimated to have a 95% CI of 0.894, 1.080 (mean=0.991), 
indicating no clinical importance of renal function on ribociclib PK for patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Results of drug-drug interaction studies were assessed in the original MAA submission and are described in 
the approved SmPC. 
Co-administration with NSAI, goserelin and fulvestrant 
In the present application, each combination partner was investigated as a covariate in the population PK 
model on ribociclib apparent clearance (see further above). All subjects receiving NSAI were also receiving 
goserelin (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The MAH provided the following data in support of this application: 
- Characterization of the relationship between ribociclib exposure and clinical efficacy endpoints as 
measured by progression free survival (PFS) and time to response (TTR) based on data from Studies E2301, 
F2301, and A2301. 
- Further characterization of the relationship between ribociclib exposure and clinical safety endpoints based 
on data in Study E2301, Study F2301, and data included in the original MAA: QTc prolongation as measured 
by the QTcF change from Baseline, focusing on the impact of combination partners on the ribociclib PK-QTc 
relationship; Neutropenia as measured by newly occurring post Baseline grade 3 or worse neutropenia; 
Longitudinal absolute neutrophil count (ANC), based on previously developed population ANC 
exposure-response (E-R) model included in the original MAA, with a focus on covariate effects. 
Table 15: Pooling strategy for exposure-response analyses 
The Safety set included all patients who received at least one dose of ribociclib.  
The PK-Safety set included all A2301, and E2301 patients who were not assigned to tamoxifen (in the 
treatment assignment case report form), and F2301 patients with no prior endocrine therapy for advanced 
disease in safety set, and who had at least one population PK model predicted ribociclib Ctrough. 
The PK-Neutropenia set included all patients in the safety set who were not assigned to tamoxifen (in the 
treatment assignment case report form), and had at least one evaluable steady state trough ribociclib 
concentration (denoted as SS Ctrough) and non-missing Baseline neutrophil count of grade 0, 1, or 2. For 
patients with a newly occurring grade 3 or worse neutropenia post Baseline (defined as Baseline grade is 
lower than grade 3, i.e., the Baseline grade is either grade 0, 1 or 2, and post Baseline value is grade 3 or 
higher), at least one evaluable steady-state concentration is required on or before the day of the newly 
occurring grade 3 or worse neutropenia to be included in the PK-Neutropenia set. 
The PK-ECG set included all patients in the Safety set with non-missing Baseline ECG (electrocardiogram) 
and at least one time-matched PK-ECG assessment. 
Demographic and Baseline characteristics of patients in each analysis set are presented in Table 16.

Exposure-efficacy  
Progression-free survival and time-to-response 
Exposure-efficacy analyses using pooled data from Study A2301, Study E2301, and Study F2301 were 
conducted to explore the relationship between ribociclib exposure and efficacy endpoints. Geometric mean 
population PK model predicted ribociclib Ctrough on non-zero dosing days serves as an overall measure of 
exposure; in the presence of dose reductions and interruptions, time-varying ribociclib DI up to the event 
(efficacy event or censoring) and time-varying mean population PK model predicted Ctrough up to the event 
(efficacy event or censoring) were planned in order to account for the change in exposure over time (Table 
17).

Ctrough and time-varying dose intensity (DI) up to the event is presented in Table 18 and Table 19.

Effect of ribociclib with combination partner on cardiac electrophysiology 
The relationship between ribociclib exposure and QT interval prolongation in cancer patients was 
characterized using a linear mixed model of the log transformed concentration (as in the original MAA). The 
model was fitted using SAS.  
QTc prolongation was observed with increase in ribociclib concentration in patients with cancer in Study 
E2301 and Study F2301. PK-QTc analysis showed that combination partner was a significant covariate.

Exposure – Neutropenia relationship 
While the exposure (geometric mean steady state Ctrough up to the event) was overlapping in patients with 
or without grade 3 or worse neutropenia, generally higher exposure was observed for those with a grade 3 
or worse event, indicating an association between ribociclib exposure and occurrence of grade 3 or worse 
neutropenia (Table 22, Figure 8).

Effect of ribociclib with combination partner on neutropenia (absolute neutropenia count (ANC)) 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses of absolute neutropenia count (ANC) were conducted. The longitudinal 
E-R relationship for neutropenia was characterized using a log-linear drug effect model coupled with a 
semi-mechanistic model for describing clinical ANC kinetic data after anticancer drug treatment. Cancer type 
and use of letrozole were in the original MAA application retained as covariates on the slope (a parameter 
representing potency) of ribociclib effect. No further model development was deemed necessary and with 
the addition of E2301 and F2301 data, the ANC E-R model was utilized to update the evaluation of effects of 
covariates (Table 23). 
The analysis dataset for covariate evaluation included 7786 ANC data points from 1052 subjects. Study 
E2301 contributed 27.0% of the subjects and 29.1% of the observations, respectively; study F2301 
contributed 44.7% of the subjects and 38.5% of the observations, respectively. 
In the current analysis, simultaneous incorporation of all prespecified covariates into the previously 
established final model (PopPK Report for original NCE/MAA) caused failure in achieving MCMC convergence. 
A stepwise procedure was employed to enable MCMC convergence and two versions of stable full model 
(anc.coveval.full6 and anc.coveval.full7) were reached (differing by one covariate, fulvestrant vs. letrozole 
(on Base and Slope).  
Statistical significance was detected for the associations between ECOG status and tumor type 
(p=1.82×10-9), between ECOG status and use of combination partner (p=5.94×10-13), and between tumor 
type and use of combination partner (p<2.2×10-16). These findings were used to inform covariate removal, 
if necessary, from a full covariate model to ensure model stability.

Table 23. Pre-specified ANC E-R covariates for evaluation 
Two versions of stable full model were reached, and from these two versions of the final model were derived. 
The two final models differed by the covariates on Base; anc.final1 retained the RaceAsian-Base relation, 
and anc.final2 retained letrozole-Base and tamoxifen-Base relations. No covariates were retained on the 
Slope in either model.  
Only results from one model were presented (anc.final1). The final model achieved MCMC convergence as 
suggested by the trace plots and the Gelman-Rubin test results (point estimates were close to 1 and the 
upper confidence boundaries did not exceed 1.05).

The combination partners were either found to have any statistically significant or clinically relevant effect on 
the ANC E-R relationship. Race of Asian, and concomitant use of letrozole or tamoxifen were significant 
covariates on baseline ANC. The base in Asian subjects was 10.1% (95% CI, 3.7% - 16.1%) lower than in 
non-Asian subjects. The base in subjects using letrozole was 15.3% (95% CI, 10.1% - 20.2%) lower, and in 
subjects using tamoxifen 10.9% (95% CI, 1.0% - 19.7%) lower. The effects of all other covariates on Base 
and Slope were considered negligible.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The two studies (E2301 and F2301) were designed to investigate the interaction, efficacy and safety of 
ribociclib treatment in combination with the following active substances: letrozole, anastrozole and 
tamoxifen (all three co-administered with goserelin) and fulvestrant. Dense and sparse PK samples were 
collected for assessment of the interaction between the combinations ribociclib, letrozole, anastrozole and 
tamoxifen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018

The impact of ribociclib on letrozole, anastrozole and tamoxifen was assessed with non-compartmental 
analysis. Cmax, Cthrough and AUC of ribociclib, tamoxifen, letrozole and anastrozole exposure parameters 
at Cycle 3 Day 15 were compared.  
Ribociclib exposures were slightly lower in combination with tamoxifen and tamoxifen exposure increased 
approximately 2-fold. Due to safety reasons in relation to QTcF prolongation, this combination is not 
proposed by the applicant (see below). For the combination of 600 mg ribociclib and letrozole, letrozole PK 
data suggested no apparent interaction. Due to small number of patients with evaluable PK parameters of 
ribociclib in combination with anastrozole (n=3), a conclusion cannot be drawn. However, data from study 
E2301 indicated no clinically relevant drug interaction between ribociclib and anastrozole following co 
administration. 
The LEQ803 concentration (metabolite of ribociclib) was largely comparable among the combination 
partners suggesting no marked impact on LEQ803 exposure. No comparison with historical LEQ803 data was 
done (ribociclib administered without combination partner). The PK of fulvestrant was not evaluated in study 
F2301. Therefore a possible impact of ribociclib on fulvestrant PK has not been fully evaluated. However, 
mechanistically and based on the knowledge on fulvestrant, it is deemed unlikely that ribociclib (a moderate 
to strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) has a clinically relevant impact on fulvestrant PK. There are no known DDI with 
fulvestrant. In vitro studies showed no relevant inhibition by fulvestrant for major CYP enzymes. Interaction 
studies with rifampicin (strong CYP3A4 inducer) and ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) demonstrated 
no effect on fulvestrant PK. 
Concomitant consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice, both of which are known to inhibit CYP3A 
enzymes, may increase the exposure of ribociclib. Concomitant consumption of pomegranate was not 
prohibited in studies A2301, E2301 and F2301. Although, in vitro experiments showed that pomegranate 
juice inhibited CYP3A, the MAH provided three papers on the in vivo interaction of pomegranate and 
midazolam and simvastatin (Farkas et al 2007, Misaka et al 2011, Park et al 2016). These clinical studies 
revealed that consumption of pomegranate juice did not modify the activity of CYP3A in humans. Therefore, 
it is unlikely that co administration of pomegranate or pomegranate juice would have any clinically 
meaningful increase in ribociclib exposure and the proposal to delete the recommendation to avoid 
pomegranates or pomegranate juice in the SmPC section 4.5 is acceptable. 
A population PK approach was conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics of ribociclib. The popPK 
model was conducted to evaluate potential interactions between ribociclib and combination partner, as well 
as for investigation of the impact of intrinsic factors. Additionally, the model was used for predictions of 
Cthrough in the exposure-response analysis. 
The dataset included the new studies as well as data from 4 previously conducted studies (ribociclib alone or 
in combination with letrozole). A previously developed two-compartment model with delayed zero-order oral 
absorption and linear clearance from the central compartment described the ribociclib PK, with dose and 
body weight recognized as covariates on CL, Q and V2. 
The objectives of the popPK modeling were to re-evaluate and update the covariate effects on ribociclib 
pharmacokinetics. The covariates investigated were bodyweight, age, eGFR, race (Asian or others) and 
combination partner (letrozole, anastrozole, tamoxifen and fulvestrant). The covariates retained in the final 
model were dose on CL, Q and V2, body weight on Q and V2 and tamoxifen on CL.  
For ribociclib and tamoxifen combination, ribociclib exposure (AUC) was estimated to be reduced by 26.7% 
(95% CI: 16.6, 35.2) in combination with 20 mg tamoxifen based on population PK analysis, and tamoxifen 
exposure was approximately 2-fold higher when administered with 600 mg ribociclib as compared to placebo 
in Study E2301. However, the changes in ribociclib and tamoxifen exposure were not considered to be 
clinically relevant as patients who were dose reduced from the starting dose of 600 mg to lower doses had 
a PFS benefit and dose reduction had no impact on the response. This combination is not proposed in this

application due to a safety issue in relation to QTcF prolongation (see further below and SmPC sections 4.4 
and 4.5).  
All subjects receiving NSAI were also receiving goserelin. However drug-drug interaction between ribociclib 
and goserelin is not expected as goserelin is metabolized by hydrolysis of C-terminal amino acids.  
The analysis did not indicate a relevant impact of letrozole or fulvestrant on ribociclib PK. There is insufficient 
information on the combination of ribociclib and anastrozole (n=31). Anastrozole as a covariate on ribociclib 
CL/F was found to have a 25% probability of being >20% from the reference value. However, this effect was 
deemed to be minor and the evaluation was limited by sample size (N=31 with the use of anastrozole, 
accounting for only 2.9% of the population in the analysis dataset).  
The handling of covariates in the covariate analysis had flaws. With the full covariate approach, whenever 
there is a correlation coefficient of >0.3 between two covariates, these should be handled with caution. This 
was not adhered to for e.g. eGFR and age on CL, therefore the possible impact of renal function on ribociclib 
PK has not been properly investigated in this analysis. However, with regard to the impact of eGFR, the 
applicant has conducted a dedicated study in patients with renal impairment which is under assessment 
(EMEA/H/C/4213/II/03/G). 
The goodness-of-fit plots of the final population PK model showed some deviation from the normal scatter 
around the identity lines in the observed versus predicted concentration plots. The prediction corrected VPCs 
that were provided showed an acceptable prediction of the observed median concentration over time, 
however, an over prediction of the 95th percentile and under prediction of the 5th percentile were observed. 
There appeared to be an under prediction of the concentration over time in study X1101 (Japanese patients) 
however, the individual values fell within the range of all observed concentrations. The available 
pharmacokinetic data do not warrant an adjustment due to race. 
No additional drug-drug interactions studies were provided. Section 4.5 of the SmPC has been updated to 
reflect available data on interactions between ribociclib and anastrozole, fulvestrant or tamoxifen 
respectively. It has also been updated to reflect that drug-drug interaction studies between ribociclib and 
oral contraceptives have not been conducted. 
Exposure-efficacy analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between ribociclib Ctrough,avg,ss 
and efficacy endpoints PFS and TTR. In the presence of dose reductions and interruptions, time-varying 
ribociclib dose intensity and mean population PK model predicted Ctrough up to the event (efficacy event or 
censoring) were planned. A significant relation between PFS and TTR and dose intensity (DI) was estimated 
using an extended cox proportional hazards regression model. This relationship is not considered to be 
clinically relevant. The cox regression analysis using Ctrough suggest a lack of relationship. Although dose 
modifications are reflected in DI variable, it is still not independent since modifications are based on 
pharmacodynamic response. In conclusion, no clear relationship was found between ribociclib exposure 
metrics and the efficacy endpoints. 
QT prolongation is an important identified safety risk for ribociclib. The ECG data showed a slightly higher 
frequency of notable QTcF values in Study E2301 and F2301 compared to Study A2301, which could be 
explained by the differences in ECG collection methodology and time points between these studies. The 
majority of post baseline ECG assessments collected in Study E2301 and F2301 were single measurements 
(approximately 80% and 75% respectively) thereby potentially subject to greater variations than average of 
triplicate measurements, and an additional mid-cycle measurement was performed on C3D15 in Study 
E2301 and C2D15 in Study F2301.  
Updated PK-QTcF analysis showed that the combination partner was a significant covariate. Using the 
PK-QTcF model, at the geometric mean steady-state Cmax of the ribociclib 600 mg dose with NSAI (letrozole 
or anastrozole) as combination partner from Study E2301, the estimated mean ΔQTcF was 22.0 ms (90% 
CI: 20.56, 23.44). Using the geometric mean steady-state Cmax of the ribociclib 600 mg as a single agent 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 43/136 
 
  
  
from Study X2101, the estimated mean ΔQTcF with fulvestrant as combination partner was 23.7 ms (90% 
CI: 22.31, 25.08). The model-estimated mean ΔQTcF values with the combination partners were consistent 
with the observed data. In combination with an aromatase inhibitor, QTcF events of > 480 ms are reversible 
and managed with dose modifications. Ribociclib in combination with tamoxifen showed that a higher 
frequency of notable QTcF and ΔQTcF values were observed in patients receiving tamoxifen compared to 
letrozole and anastrozole (estimated mean ΔQTcF at the geometric mean steady-state Cmax of ribociclib 
600 mg 34.7 ms (90% CI: 31.64, 37.78)). The mean ΔQTcF was consistently higher (> 10 ms) in the 
placebo plus tamoxifen subgroup than in the placebo plus NSAI subgroup, suggesting tamoxifen alone has 
a QT prolongation effect. Based on an imbalance in increased QTcF values and higher ΔQTcF observed in the 
ribociclib plus tamoxifen subgroup, the MAH has decided not to include the ribociclib and tamoxifen 
combination in the proposed indication. Section 4.4 of the SmPC reflects the results of study E2301 
(MONALEESA-7) in which a QTcF interval increase >60 msec from baseline was observed in 14/87 (16.1%) 
patients receiving Kisqali plus tamoxifen and in 18/245 (7.3%) patients receiving Kisqali plus a non steroidal 
aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). Kisqali is not recommended to be used in combination with tamoxifen (see 
section on clinical safety and SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Due to the risk of QT prolongation when used in combination,  the SmPC was modified to recommend 
restarting Kisqali at the next lower dose level after resolution of the first occurrence of QTcF >480 ms versus 
resuming at the same dose level (as currently stated in the Kisqali label) (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Furthermore, it is considered that one ECG showing QTcF greater than 500 msec is sufficient to interrupt 
Kisqali hence the mention of at least 2 separate was deleted from the SmPC section 4.2. Section 4.5 of the 
SmPC has also been updated to add ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, azithromycin to the list of medicinal products 
that are known to prolong the QT interval and should be avoided in combination with Kisqali. 
The results of the exposure – neutropenia analyse indicated a slight association between ribociclib exposure 
and occurrence of grade 3 or worse neutropenia, which is in line with the results presented in the original 
MAA. 
The longitudinal E-R relationship for neutropenia was characterized using a log-linear drug effect model 
coupled with a semi-mechanistic model for describing clinical ANC kinetic data. The factors, including age, 
race, and combination partners (letrozole, anastrozole, tamoxifen, fulvestrant), were evaluated for their 
effects on the ANC E-R relationship of ribociclib, on the parameters of Base (baseline ANC) and Slope 
(ribociclib potency for inhibition of progenitor cell proliferation). None of the covariates were found to have 
clinically important effect on Slope based on the simulated covariate effect sizes and the relevant predefined 
criteria, indicating that the ANC E-R relationship of ribociclib was not affected by age, race, or the use of 
letrozole, anastrozole, tamoxifen, or fulvestrant. Race of Asian, and concomitant use of letrozole or 
tamoxifen were significant covariates on baseline ANC. Only race of Asian was retained in the model, 
letrozole was not considered to be clinically relevant. A VPC of the ANC versus time was provided and 
indicated the model captured the general trend in the observed data although a slight over prediction of the 
median was observed. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of ribociclib has been previously described and the PK and PD data presented in this submission is 
generally in line with previous results.  
Overall, data from study E2301, a clinical study in patients with breast cancer, indicated no clinically relevant 
drug interaction between ribociclib and anastrozole following co administration of these medicinal products. 
Furthermore no clinically relevant effects of fulvestrant on ribociclib exposure following co administration of 
these medicinal products were reported in study F2301.

Treatments 
Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio to either the ribociclib 
or placebo arm: 
•  Ribociclib 600 mg days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle plus tamoxifen 20 mg QD or a NSAI (letrozole 2.5 
mg QD or anastrozole 1 mg QD) plus goserelin 3.6 mg subcutaneously of each 28-day cycle. 
• 
Placebo plus tamoxifen or a NSAI (letrozole or anastrozole) plus goserelin. 
Study treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from 
the study treatment for any other reason. 
Patients were not allowed to cross over from placebo to Kisqali during the study or after disease progression. 
Switching the endocrine combination partners was also not permitted. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To determine whether treatment with ribociclib plus goserelin plus either tamoxifen or a 
nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) compared to treatment 
with placebo plus goserelin plus either tamoxifen or a NSAI in premenopausal women with HR-positive, 
HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. 
Key secondary objective: To determine whether treatment with ribociclib plus goserelin plus either 
tamoxifen or a NSAI prolongs overall survival (OS) compared to treatment with placebo plus goserelin plus 
either tamoxifen or a NSAI in premenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast 
cancer. 
Other secondary objectives: 
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ribociclib plus goserelin plus either tamoxifen or a NSAI. 
- To evaluate the two treatment arms with respect to ORR and clinical benefit rate (CBR). 
- To describe time to response (TTR) and duration of response (DOR) in each treatment arm. 
- To evaluate the two treatment arms with respect to time to deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status.  
- To evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for health-related quality of life (QoL) in the two treatment 
arms. 
Exploratory objectives: To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tamoxifen/NSAI with or without 
co-administration with ribociclib; To characterize the PK of ribociclib when administered with goserelin plus 
either tamoxifen or a NSAI; To assess differences in molecular alterations (main pathways of interest in 
breast cancer) in patients deriving benefit from treatment; To explore molecular alterations in circulating 
tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA); To explore potential mechanisms of resistance to treatment with 
ribociclib with goserelin plus either tamoxifen or a NSAI;  To assess any effect on estradiol (E2) suppression 
relative to baseline with or without co-administration with ribociclib in patients treated with NSAIs; To 
evaluate the effect of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype on tamoxifen biotransformation and/or 
response to tamoxifen treatment; To explore potential mechanisms of hepatotoxicity; To describe work 
productivity and activity impairment in the two treatment arms; To explore potential differences in hospital 
resource utilization; To explore the long-term benefit intermediate to PFS and OS; by measurement of PFS2.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: Progression free survival. The primary efficacy variable was PFS from Investigator’s 
review of radiology data using RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
Key secondary endpoint: Overall survival defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death 
due to any cause. 
Other secondary endpoints were: ORR, clinical benefit rate (CBR), TTR, DOR, time to deterioration of ECOG 
status, health-related quality of life (QoL), safety and tolerability. 
Overall response rate was defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of confirmed CR 
or PR according to RECIST v1.1, and CBR was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall 
response of confirmed CR or PR, or stable disease lasting 24 weeks or longer, according to RECIST v1.1 
criteria.  
Time to response (CR or PR) was defined as the time interval between date of randomization and the first 
documented response (CR or PR, which had to be confirmed subsequently). 
Duration of response (DoR) was defined as the time from documentation of tumor response to disease 
progression. 
ECOG performance status was used to assess physical health of patients ranging from 0 (most active) to 5 
(least active). An analysis of time to definitive deterioration of the ECOG PS was performed and summarized 
using K-M method. The two treatment groups were compared using a stratified log-rank test at a one-sided 
2.5% level of significance. Deterioration was defined as an increase in ECOG PS by at least one category 
from the baseline score or death due to any cause. Deterioration was considered definitive if ECOG PS had 
no return to baseline or better at a time subsequent to the deterioration during the treatment period. 
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were evaluated using the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer’s core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30, version 3.0) and breast cancer 
specific questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23, version 1.0). EuroQoL 5-level instrument (EQ-5D-5L, Version 4.0) 
was used to evaluate PRO measures of health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL), functioning, disease 
symptoms and treatment-related side effects. In addition, the Work Productivity and Activity 
Impairment-General Health (WPAI-GH, version 2.0) was used to explore the impact of study treatments on 
work productivity/productivity loss (Reilly et al 1993). 
Exploratory endpoints included: PK, molecular alterations (including ctDNA), mechanisms of resistance, 
estradiol (E2) suppression, effect of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype on tamoxifen, work productivity 
and activity impairment, hospital resource utilization, mechanisms of hepatotoxicity (not analyzed at this 
cut-off), PFS2. 
Sample size 
The assumption of median PFS of 9 months in the control arm (tamoxifen/NSAI plus goserelin) for the 
sample size calculation was based on a meta-analysis of four studies including pre-menopausal patients 
advanced breast cancer. These patients were treated with a combination of tamoxifen and luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone agonist9 and the results of a letrozole study in breast cancer patients10. It was 
expected that the addition of ribociclib would result in a 33% reduction in the hazard rate (corresponding to 
an increase in median PFS to 13.4 months assuming PFS had an exponential model assumption). 
If the true HR was 0.67 (under the alternative hypothesis), a total of 329 PFS events would provide 95% 
power at a one-sided overall 2.5% level of significance to reject the null hypothesis (HR = 1) using a log-rank

test. Considering a recruitment period of approximately 18 months at a uniform rate of 33 patients/month, 
600 patients were needed to be randomized to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. Assuming about 10% 
patients would be lost to follow-up for PFS, a total of 660 patients were needed be randomized. Given the 
above assumptions, it was estimated that the 329th PFS event would be observed approximately 22 months 
from the date of first patient randomized in the study.  
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomized, stratified by the presence of liver and/or lung metastases (yes versus 
no), prior chemotherapy for advanced disease (yes versus no), and endocrine combination partner 
(tamoxifen and goserelin versus NSAI and goserelin). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis set 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all randomized patients. Following the intent-to-treat principle, 
patients were analyzed according to the treatment and stratum they were assigned to at randomization. The 
FAS was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses. 
The Safety Set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of any component of study treatment. 
Patients were analyzed according to the treatment actually received, which refers to the randomized 
treatment unless the alternative treatment was received throughout the study. 
The Per-protocol Set (PPS) included the subset of patients from the FAS without a major protocol deviation 
and who took at least one dose of study treatment.  
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set included all patients who provided at least one evaluable PK 
concentration. 
Efficacy analyses 
PFS 
According to the final SAP, no interim analysis was planned for PFS. The primary endpoint PFS was to be 
assessed after approximately 329 (event rate 50%) events had been documented.  
Assuming a median PFS of 9 months for the control arm vs. 13.4 months for the ribociclib arm (HR 0.67), the 
329 events would provide 95% power to reject the null hypothesis (log-rank, one-sided, 2.5% level 
significance, strata based on CRF data). 
OS 
A hierarchical testing strategy, where OS was to be statistically evaluated only if the primary efficacy 
endpoint PFS was statistically significant favoring the treatment arm, was used to control the overall type-I 
error rate. 
Up to three analyses were planned for OS. A median OS of 33 months was assumed for the control arm and 
47 months for the ribociclib arm (HR 0.7).  
For the OS-analyses, an α-spending function according to Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming), was used to 
maintain the overall type I error probability.

The cumulative conditional power to reject the null hypothesis (log-rank, one-sided, 2.5% level significance) 
is presented in the table below. 
Table 25: Timelines for interim and final analyses - Study E2301 
Blinded independent review (BIRC) in audit sample 
PFS assessed by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) was used as a supportive analysis of the 
primary endpoint. 
Based on the audit size calculation approach proposed by Dodd et al (2011), assuming investigator and BIRC 
assessments are similar and the estimated log of investigator-based HR was -0.40 (i.e. HR=0.67), the audit 
size of 40% ensured that the upper bound of a one-sided 95% CI for BIRC-based log-hazard ratio had 86% 
probability of being below zero (i.e. HR < 1) if the correlation between investigator assessment and BIRC 
assessment was 0.7 (the estimated correlation based on data from the BELLE-2 [CBKM120F2302] study in 
metastatic breast cancer). 
The following thresholds based on the NCI11 and PhRMA12 methods were used to define the trigger for a full 
BIRC review: 
• 
If the upper-bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for BIRC-based log-hazard ratio 
exceeded zero (i.e. HR>1) based on the NCI method 
and/or 
• 
If ≥15% differential discordance was observed in early discordance rate (EDR) or late discordance 
rate (LDR) according to Amit et al 2011.

Selected changes 
1 (28-Apr-2015) 
24 
PFS assessment as per BIRC was changed from supportive 
analysis of the primary endpoint to a secondary endpoint. 
2 (17-Feb-2016) 
372 
Central radiology assessment by medical oncologist review 
was replaced by a standard BIRC assessment. 
3 (24-Jun-2016) 
611 
Eliminate the planned futility analysis since additional clinical 
data had been generated with ribociclib and other CDK 4/6 
inhibitors compared to the start of the study providing 
additional assurance of the activity in patients with breast 
cancer. 
Include the change of approach for BIRC assessment of PFS 
from a full read to an audit (sample) based approach. 
Add an exploratory endpoint (PFS2) defined as the time from 
randomization to progression on next-line therapy or death, 
whichever occurred first, in order to make an exploratory 
assessment of longer-term benefit intermediate to PFS and 
OS. 
4 (24-Feb-2017) 
672 
To remove the planned efficacy interim analysis: Interim 
analysis that allowed the study to stop for superior efficacy was 
planned after all patients had been randomized and 
approximately 80% PFS events (263 events) had been 
documented, as per local assessments. 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, 43.2% of patients reported at least one protocol deviation. The numbers of protocol deviations 
leading to exclusion from the per-protocol set (PPS) were low, with no imbalance between the two treatment 
arms. Overall, nine patients (1.3%) had protocol deviations which led to exclusion from the PPS; all 
deviations were due to the selection criteria not being met.

Overall survival data were not mature at the time of the data cutoff date in the full population or in either of 
endocrine combination subgroups. Collection of survival data is continuing. In patients with NSAI as the 
endocrine combination partner, 30/248 (12.1) patients and 36/247 (14.6) patients in the ribociclib arm and 
placebo arm died, respectively, with an HR of 0.798 (95% CI: 0.491, 1.295). In patients with tamoxifen as 
combination partner, there were 13/87 (14.9%) and 10/90 (11.1%) deaths in the ribociclib and placebo 
arms, respectively, with an HR of 1.384 (95% CI: 0.607, 3.158).

Cycle 1). 
• 
Placebo plus fulvestrant at the above dose. 
Study treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from

Objectives 
Primary objective: To compare PFS between ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant to placebo in 
combination with fulvestrant among men and postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative 
advanced breast cancer who received no or only one prior endocrine treatment (with either antiestrogen or 
an AI) for advanced disease. 
Secondary objectives: To compare the two treatment arms with respect to OS; To evaluate the two 
treatment arms with respect to overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), time to response 
(TTR), and duration of response (DoR); To evaluate the two treatment arms with respect to time to 
deterioration of Eastern; Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS); To evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant; To evaluate patient-reported outcomes 
(PROs) for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the two treatment arms; To characterize the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of ribociclib (and relevant metabolites such as LEQ803) when given in combination 
with fulvestrant. 
Exploratory objectives: To explore exposure/response relationship; To explore potential differences in 
hospital resource utilization; To assess differences in molecular alterations (main pathways of interest in 
breast cancer) in patients deriving benefit from treatment; To explore molecular alterations in circulating 
tumor DNA (ctDNA); To explore potential mechanisms of resistance to treatment with ribociclib plus 
fulvestrant; To explore potential mechanisms of hepatotoxicity; To explore the long-term benefit 
intermediate to PFS and OS; by measurement of PFS2.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints: PFS  
The primary efficacy variable was PFS from Investigator’s review of radiology data using RECIST v1.1 
criteria. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the 
first documented disease progression or death due to any cause. Discontinuation due to disease progression 
without supporting objective evidence satisfying progression criteria per RECIST was not considered disease 
progression for PFS derivation. 
The PFS was censored at the last adequate tumor assessment if one of the following occurred: Absence of 
event, i.e. patients had not progressed or died at the analysis cut-off date; The event occurred after two or 
more consecutive missing tumor assessments. Discontinuation of study treatment (for any reason) was not 
considered as a reason for censoring. 
Secondary endpoints: Overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), time to 
response (TTR), and duration of response (DoR), time to deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), safety and tolerability, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), pharmacokinetics (PK).  
Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)–C30 (version 3.0) along with the EuroQoL 5-level 
instrument (EQ-5D-5L, Version 4.0) and BPI-SF to explore impacts on HRQoL, functioning, disease 
symptoms, and treatment-related side effects. These questionnaires were administered before any study 
treatment administrations. All questionnaires were administered in the patient’s local language to avoid 
biasing the patient’s perspective. A patient’s refusal to complete study questionnaires was not a protocol 
deviation.  
Exploratory endpoints included: exposure/response, hospital resource utilization, molecular alterations in 
patients deriving benefit (including ctDNA), mechanisms of resistance, mechanism of hepatotoxicity, PFS2. 
Sample size 
The median time to progression (TTP) for fulvestrant in first-line postmenopausal advanced breast cancer 
patients is estimated to be between 8 months13 and 23 months14. For the sample size calculation, the 
median PFS for firstline patients was therefore assumed to be 18 months. For sample size calculation, it was 
assumed that the median PFS was 6.5 months for fulvestrant as second-line therapy based on CONFIRM 
trial15. 
Of the patients recruited to the current study, it was anticipated that 40% would be first-line and 60% 
second-line. The overall median PFS was estimated to be approximately 9 months based on simulation. It 
was hypothesized that the addition of ribociclib would result in a clinically meaningful 33% reduction in the 
hazard rate of PFS, corresponding to an increase in median PFS to 13.4 months. A maximum of 364 PFS 
events was required to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 with 95% power using the log-rank test at a one-sided 
cumulative 2.5% level of significance. Assuming that enrollment would continue for approximately 19 
months at a uniform rate and there would be a 10% dropout rate by the time of the PFS final analysis, 660 
patients needed to be randomized to the two treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio to observe 364 events at 
approximately 7 months following the randomization of the last patient, i.e. 26 months from the 
randomization date of the first patient in this study.

Based on the estimated median PFS and proportion of patients receiving first-line and second line therapy, 
respectively, it was expected that the accumulation of events in first-line patients would be slower than in 
second-line patients. To ensure sufficient information was forthcoming from first-line patients, the final 
analysis was planned to be conducted once approximately 125 events occurred in first-line patients or 
approximately 364 events occurred in both arms whichever came later. 
Overall survival was to be compared between the two treatment arms provided that the primary endpoint, 
PFS, was statistically significant. Estimates of median OS for fulvestrant alone in the first-line setting were 
not available. Based on the available date from letrozole monotherapy16 and anastrozole monotherapy17, 
and from data for fulvestrant in relapsed patients with postmenopausal advanced breast cancer18,19, the 
median OS for the control arm was estimated via simulation to be approximately 30 months.  
It was hypothesized that adding ribociclib to fulvestrant would result in a 29% reduction in the hazard rate 
for OS (corresponding to an increase in median survival to 42 months). To detect a hazard ratio of 0.71 with 
85% cumulative power, a maximum of 351 deaths needed to be observed (using a log-rank test and a 3-look 
[superiority only] group sequential design at a one sided cumulative 2.5% level of significance). 
Randomisation 
The randomization ratio was 2:1 (ribociclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant) and the 
randomization was stratified by the presence of liver and/or lung metastases (yes versus no) and previous 
endocrine therapy. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double blind study. 
Statistical methods  
Analysis set 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS population) consisted of all randomized patients. Following the intent-to-treat 
principle, patient data were analysed according to the treatment and stratum they were assigned to at 
randomization. 
The Safety Set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment and who had 
at least one post-baseline safety assessment. Patient data were analyzed according to the treatment 
actually received. If a patient took at least one dose of the treatment to which he/she was randomized to, 
then the treatment actually received was the randomized treatment. The statement that a patient had no AE 
constituted a safety assessment. Occurrence of a death constituted a safety assessment as well. 
The Per-protocol Set (PPS) included a subset of the patients from the FAS without major protocol deviations 
and who took at least one dose of study treatment. 
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS) included all patients who provided at least one evaluable PK 
concentration.

No interim analysis was planned for PFS.  
To achieve 95% power for a log-rank test at one-sided 2.5% level of significance, the primary endpoint PFS 
was to be assessed after approximately 364 PFS events (55% event rate). Analysis also required 125 events 
in the first line patients. Six hundred and sixty (660) patients were planned to allow 364 events at 
approximately 7 months following the randomization of the last patient.  
The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of the distribution of PFS between the two treatment arms 
using a stratified log-rank test (stratum using IRT data) at a one-sided 2.5% level of significance. The PFS 
survival distribution was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The PFS hazard ratio with two-sided 
95% confidence interval (CI) was derived from the stratified Cox proportional hazards model (stratum using 
IRT data). 
Secondary endpoint OS 
A hierarchical testing procedure was adopted in this study and the OS analyses were to be performed only 
if the primary efficacy endpoint PFS was statistically significant. 
A maximum of 3 analyses were planned for OS: at the time of the analysis for PFS (provided PFS was 
significant), at which point a total 161 deaths (25% event rate) were expected, after 263 events (40% event 
rate) could be documented, and a final analysis for OS when 351 deaths (53% event rate) were expected 
(expected 56 months from date of first patient to be randomized). OS tests were carried out using a 
Lan-Demets (O’Brien-Fleming) alpha spending function. 
Table 48: Timelines for interim and final analyses - Study F2301 
Blinded independent review (BIRC) in audit sample 
PFS assessed by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) was used as a supportive analysis of the 
primary endpoint. 
Based on the audit size calculation approach proposed by Dodd et al (2011), assuming investigator and BIRC 
assessments are similar and the estimated log of investigator-based HR was -0.40 (i.e. HR=0.67), the audit 
size of 40% ensured that the upper bound of a one-sided 95% CI for BIRC-based log-hazard ratio had 86% 
probability of being below zero (i.e. HR < 1) if the correlation between investigator assessment and BIRC 
assessment was 0.7 (the estimated correlation based on data from the BELLE-2 [CBKM120F2302] study in 
metastatic breast cancer). 
The following thresholds based on the NCI (Dodd et al 2011) and PhRMA (Amit et al 2011) methods were 
used to define the trigger for a full BIRC review: 
• 
If the upper-bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for BIRC-based log-hazard ratio 
exceeded zero (i.e. HR>1) based on the NCI method

Originally planned futility interim analysis (IA) was eliminated. 
Originally planned efficacy IA was eliminated and a 
requirement for a minimum amount of events coming from 1st 
line patients in the final analysis was added. 
PFS based on BIRC assessments was not a secondary endpoint 
but was added as a supportive analysis for the primary 
analysis. 
Progression on next-line therapy was added as an exploratory 
objective. 
Protocol deviations 
The numbers of major protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the Per-protocol Set were low with no 
imbalance between the treatment arms. A total of 16 patients (2.2%) were excluded from the Per-protocol 
Set due to protocol deviations; all deviations were due to the selection criteria not being met and the most 
frequent one was the criterion for measurable disease or lytic bone lesion not met.

Study identifier 
CLEE011E2301 (MONALEESA-7) 
Design 
A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase III, global 
study compared the combination of ribociclib (once daily, on Days 1-21 of a 
28-day cycle) plus goserelin (3.6 mg subcutaneously implant on Day 1 of every 
28-day cycle) plus either tamoxifen (20 mg orally once daily) or a NSAI (letrozole 
2.5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg) to placebo plus goserelin plus either tamoxifen or a 
NSAI (letrozole or anastrozole). 
Patients were pre- or perimenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative 
advanced breast cancer who received no prior hormonal therapy and were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the ribociclib or the placebo arm. 
Treatment crossover from placebo to ribociclib was not permitted in this study.

Summary of Efficacy for trial CLEE011F2301 (MONALEESA-3) 
Title: A randomized double-blind, placebo controlled study of ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant 
for the treatment of men and postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative, 
advanced breast cancer who have received no or only one line of prior endocrine treatment. 
Study identifier 
CLEE011F2301 (MONALEESA-3) 
Design 
This was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled two-arm study with the objective to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of adding ribociclib (600 mg as three 200 mg capsules once daily on 
Days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle.) to fulvestrant in men and postmenopausal 
women with advanced breast cancer. 
Patients who were treatment naive or patients who received up to one line of 
prior endocrine therapy were included in the study. The randomization ratio 
was 2:1, stratified by the presence of liver and/or lung metastases (yes versus 
no) and previous endocrine therapy.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
With regards to dose selection, all drugs used in Studies E2301 and F2301 were administered at doses 
according to their approved SmPCs. Based on current available data, there was a low probability of clinically 
meaningful DDIs between ribociclib and other study treatments.  
Regarding the dose tamoxifen in study E2301, it was expected that the combination of ribociclib (600 mg) 
with tamoxifen (20 mg daily and goserelin) would be well tolerated, even with the knowledge that there was 
the potential for an increase in tamoxifen exposure as well as the possibility that tamoxifen increases QT 
prolongation. NSAI or tamoxifen was investigators choice unless less than 12 months had passed since (neo) 
adjuvant treatment, in this situation the endocrine backbone was switched (tamoxifen to AI or vice versa). 
Selection of the ribociclib dose and regimen (600 mg daily on Days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle) was based on 
results from the first in-human study of single-agent ribociclib Study CLEE011X2101 and was also consistent 
with the previously approved dosing schedule used in combination with letrozole in the registration Study 
A2301 in patients with advanced breast cancer. Studies X2101 and A2301 were a part of the initial MAA 
Assessment report

submission and are not discussed further here. Additionally, data from an additional 13 patients exposed to 
the same regimen in Phase Ib X2108 study (Arm 3) were also submitted (data not shown).   
The overall design of the randomized, active-controlled studies MONALEESA 7 and MONALEESA 3 is 
considered acceptable. 
Patient populations in the trials, as identified by eligibility criteria, were relevant to the respective 1st line 
indication of ribociclib as add on to a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor for pre- and perimenopausal women, 
and the 1st and 2nd line indication as add-on to fulvestrant in the setting of advanced disease. The chosen 
comparators are considered appropriate, in line with international guidelines and scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/2912/1/2014/II).  
No patients with critical visceral disease were included in the two pivotal studies. It is adequately reflected 
in the current SmPC that the efficacy and safety of ribociclib have not been studied in patients with critical 
visceral disease (see SmPC section 4.4). 
In advanced breast cancer, prolonging survival and alleviating disease symptoms are relevant aims of 
therapy. Although OS is the most persuasive endpoint, PFS is an acceptable primary endpoint. Possible 
benefits of a PFS gain include delayed symptomatic deterioration, postponed chemotherapy, and extension 
of life span provided no disease-modifying effects of ribociclib beyond discontinuation. Such an effect has 
been discussed for CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Therefore, in the absence of mature OS data, PFS2 is considered 
important supporting evidence, as highlighted in the scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/2912/1/2014/II). 
For both studies, the statistical analysis plan is overall acceptable. Generally, commonly expected methods 
were used. Pre-specified PFS censoring rules did not include an analysis where initiation of new 
antineoplastic therapy was considered an event (see discussion under efficacy data and additional 
analyses). 
In both studies, some changes to planned analyses were implemented. The more important changes 
involved removing interim analyses of PFS, keeping only the final analysis. The changes are deemed not to 
affect the integrity of key results. Overall, the studies are considered to be well conducted. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study MONALEESA 7 (E2301) 
With regards to baseline data, NSAI or tamoxifen was chosen at investigators discretion for about 70% of 
patients with no prior [neo]adjuvant endocrine therapy or progression > 12 months after end of such 
therapy. In accordance with eligibility criteria that allowed prior chemo- but not endocrine therapy in the 
advanced setting (unless ≤ 14 days of tamoxifen or NSAI or ≤ 28 days goserelin), 14% of patients had 
received prior (advanced setting) chemotherapy, whereas 0.6% had received prior (advanced setting) 
endocrine therapy. 
Demographic characteristics were balanced between arms. The average age was 43 years, 58% of patients 
were Caucasian, Europe and Australia contributed 41% of patients, Asia 27%, North America 14%. 
Baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the two arms. About 40% of patients had stage IV 
disease at baseline (de novo metastatic), 24% had bone-only metastatic disease and 57% visceral 
metastatic disease. Very few (2) patients had locally advanced (not distant metastatic) disease. 
The planned final analysis was conducted when 318 events had occurred (39% and 56% event rate for the 
ribociclib and placebo arms respectively). The primary study objective was met. The HR of 0.55 is likely a 
robust estimate of the relative PFS benefit. PFS medians were 23.8 months and 13.0 months for the Kisqali 
plus NSAI/tamoxifen plus goserelin arm and placebo plus NSAI/tamoxifen plus goserelin arm respectively, 
and the resulting PFS increase of approximately 11 months is of clinical benefit.

EMA/888562/2018 
Page 98/136 
 
  
  
In investigators analysis, PFS events or administrative censorings (ongoing without event) accounted for 
>90% of patients in both arms, i.e. the loss of informative data points was limited.    
Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses with small differences in numbers for ‘actual event’, 
’backdating’, and ’censoring for antineoplastic therapy’ approaches (131 [placebo] and 187 [ribociclib] in 
primary analysis, 133 and 191 in ‘actual event’, 133 and 191 in ‘backdating’, and 127 and 183 in ‘censoring 
for new anticancer therapy’). An analysis where new anticancer therapy is considered an event was also 
provided (data not shown) and was consistent with the primary analysis results. 
The thresholds for conducting a full BIRC review were not met and BIRC assessment was conducted on a 
random subset of 40% of patients. The results for PFS based on the blinded independent central radiological 
assessment of a randomly selected subset of approximately 40% of randomised patients were supportive of 
the primary efficacy results based on the investigator’s assessment (hazard ratio of 0.427; 95% CI: 0.288, 
0.633). The BIRC analysis indicated a degree of bias in investigators assessment; investigators PDs were not 
confirmed in 29% and 19% of cases (ribociclib and placebo, respectively), whereas for agreed upon cases, 
investigators were late compared to BICR in 27% vs 35% of cases. The overall effect of investigators’ bias 
appears to disfavor the ribociclib arm. 
With regards to PFS subgroup analysis, the results were consistent between the different subgroups. 
The PFS 2 had a low event rate of about 20% and hence, the findings offered limited support (HR 0.84, 95% 
CI 0.6-1.2). Among censored patients in this analysis, more patients had not yet commenced second-line 
therapy in the ribociclib arm (61% vs. 47% for placebo). 
At the time of the primary PFS analysis overall survival data were not mature with 89 (13%) of deaths (HR 
0. 916 [95% CI: 0.601, 1.396]). It is currently unclear what long-term effect on OS is to be expected. 
Nevertheless, a detrimental OS effect is unlikely given the large treatment-effect on PFS and based on the 
evaluation of deaths on study and in follow up. The OS findings at final PFS analysis are still immature with 
an event rate of < 15%. It is currently projected that the 189 deaths for the next OS interim analysis will be 
reached in approximately 2Q2019 and the 252 deaths for the final analysis will be reached in approximately 
4Q2020. The CHMP recommends submitting remaining OS analyses when available.  
The ORR data supported the PFS result where ORR per investigator assessment based on RECIST v1.1 was 
higher in the Kisqali arm (40.9%; 95% CI: 35.6, 46.2) compared to the placebo arm (29.7%; 95% CI: 24.8, 
34.6). In the audit sample, the ORR was 45.9% (61/133) for ribociclib vs. 28.4% (38/134) for placebo. 
It was noted that NSAI-treated patients had better progression-free survival compared with the tamoxifen 
group: median PFS was 28 and 14 months for ribociclib+NSAI vs control arms, compared to 22 and 11 for 
ribociclib+tamoxifen vs control. The MAH noted there were more patients with de novo metastatic disease in 
the tamoxifen subpopulation relative to the NSAI subpopulation (72% vs. 29%), and higher numbers of 
patients not having received prior neo-adjuvant/adjuvant endocrine therapy (92% vs. 49%). 
Contrary to the longer PFS estimates in the NSAI compared to the tamoxifen subgroups, responses were 
lower in patients with NSAI as endocrine combination partner, with ORR 39 % and 29% (NSAI, placebo) 
compared to 46% and 31% for tamoxifen and placebo. As these endocrine treatments (NSAI vs. tamoxifen) 
are systematically different, the response-to-PFS relationship may be different or it could be a chance 
finding. Nonetheless, these results do not affect the conclusion on the efficacy outcomes where a clinical 
benefit was observed with either NSAI or tamoxifen.  
Although somewhat hampered by lower numbers, PFS results in subgroups analyses in NSAI patients were 
consistent between the different groups.

Baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. Although a majority of patients had 
received prior endocrine therapy, about 21% had received prior endocrine therapy in the advanced setting, 
i.e. were 2nd line patients. 
The applicant stated that due to the rapid enrollment prior to implementation of Amendment 1, no male 
patients were included. 
The planned final analysis was conducted when 361 events had occurred (43% and 62% event rate for the 
ribociclib and placebo arms respectively). The median follow up time at the time of primary PFS analysis was 
20.4 months. The primary study objective was met. The HR of 0.59 is likely a robust estimate of the relative 
PFS benefit, PFS medians were 20.5 and 12.8 months for the ribociclib and placebo arms respectively, and 
the resulting PFS increase of approximately 8 months is of clinical benefit. 
Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses. An additional analysis where new anticancer therapy was 
considered an event was provided (data not shown) and showed consistency.  
In the subgroup of patients who were treatment naive in the metastatic/advanced disease setting, the 
hazard ratio was of 0.577 (95% CI: 0.415, 0.802), with a median PFS not reached in the Kisqali arm and 
18.3 months (95% CI: 14.8, 23.1) in the placebo arm. In the subgroup of patients who had received up to 
one line of treatment for metastatic/advanced disease, the hazard ratio was of 0.565 (95% CI: 0.428, 
0.744), with a median PFS of 14.6 months (95% CI: 12.5, 18.5) and 9.1 months (95% CI: 6.1, 11.1) in the 
Kisqali and placebo arms, respectively. Within this subgroup, the hazard ratio for the second line patients 
who had received prior endocrine therapy in the advanced breast cancer setting was 0.539 (95% CI: 0.333, 
0.873), with a median PFS of 18.8 months (95% CI: 12.5, NE) and 11.4 months (95% CI: 3.7, 16.3) in the 
Kisqali and placebo arms, respectively. 
As for MONALEESA 7, the BIRC analysis indicated a degree of bias in investigators assessment; investigators 
PDs were not confirmed in 35% and 23% of cases (ribociclib and placebo, respectively), whereas for agreed 
upon cases, investigators were late compared to BICR in 34% vs 39% of cases. The pattern was similar in 
the two studies, and the overall effect of investigators’ bias appeared to disfavor the ribociclib arm.  
In investigators analysis, PFS events or administrative censorings (ongoing without event) accounted for 
87% and 93% of patients in the experimental and control arms respectively, i.e. the loss of informative data 
points was limited. 
With regards to PFS in subgroup, the interpretation of findings in the Asian subpopulation is very uncertain 
due to low numbers. Otherwise, no concerning inconsistencies were found. In the ~21% of patients that had 
received previous endocrine therapy in the advanced setting (“2nd line ET”; relevant to the sought 
indication), the HR was 0.52 (0.32 – 0.84). In this study, 46.7% of patients were of age 65 years and older, 
including 13.8% patients of age 75 years and older. No overall differences in efficacy of Kisqali were 
observed between these patients and younger patients (see SmPC section 4.2 and 5.1). 
PFS 2 was more mature compared to MONALEESA 7, with an event rate of 24% and 34% for the ribociclib 
and placebo arms, and an HR of 0.67 (0.5 – 0.89), indicating that the delay of disease progression is 
maintained beyond progression. 
Similar to MONALEESA 7, OS findings were immature with an event rate of 15 and 21%, but estimates 
leaned towards supportive for the ribociclib arm, HR 0.670 (0.465 – 0.964). Considering the analysis plan, 
the MAH informed that 263 deaths for the next OS interim analysis are expected to be reached in 
approximately 1Q2020, and 351 deaths for the final analysis are expected to be reached in approximately 
3Q2022. The CHMP recommends submitting remaining OS analyses when available.  
The ORR supported the PFS result where ORR per investigator assessment was higher in the Kisqali arm 
(32.4%; 95% CI: 28.3, 36.6) compared to the placebo arm (21.5%; 95% CI:16.3, 26.7). In the audit 
sample, the ORR was 27.5% (21.2 – 33.8) for ribociclib vs. 15.5% (8.3 – 22.7) for placebo.

To evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for health-related quality of life (QoL) in the two treatment 
arms was described as a secondary objective in the two clinical studies, with no further specification. The 
protocols describe the analyses as well as others to be performed, but state that no formal statistical tests 
will be performed on PRO data and hence that no multiplicity adjustment will be applied. Based on this, the 
PRO data has not been considered important in determining the benefit/risk for the product in the claimed 
indication. 
With regards to biomarkers analysis, CDK pathway relevant genes and their correlations with PFS were 
included in the initial submission. Additional exploratory biomarker analyses are ongoing in the two pivotal 
studies MONALEESA-7 and MONALEESA-3. Results are expected for both in Q2 2019. Preclinical findings 
(notably regarding non-functional retinoblastoma) indicate that there may be a molecularly well-defined 
group of patients with compromised benefit. The results of the exploratory biomarker analyses in 
MONALEESA 7 and 3 may provide relevant information in this regard and are expected to be submitted post 
authorisation as soon as available. 
Of all patients who received Kisqali in studies MONALEESA-2 and MONALEESA-3, representative proportions 
of patients were ≥65 years and ≥75 years of age (see SmPC section 5.1). No overall differences in safety or 
effectiveness of Kisqali were observed between these patients and younger patients (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The proposed indication included the following extrapolations from the two pivotal studies: 
• 
• 
From pre/perimenopausal women (Study E2301), and postmenopausal women (Study A2301, 
Study F2301) with HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer to men 
with HR-positive HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
Extrapolation to men patients has not been sufficiently justified and has been withdrawn by the 
MAH. 
From NSAI + LHRH as initial endocrine therapy in pre/perimenopausal patients (Study E2301), and 
from fulvestrant in postmenopausal patients who have received no or only one line of prior endocrine 
treatment (Study F2301), to combination with fulvestrant + LHRH in pre/perimenopausal women. 
The extrapolation to ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant + LHRH in pre/perimenopausal 
women can be accepted. The efficacy of ribociclib has been shown in combination with fulvestrant in 
post-menopausal women and in combination with AI in pre/perimenopausal women, which support 
extrapolation. Effective inhibition of ER signalling is achieved with AI or fulvestrant (+LHRH) alike, 
as this is the basis for anti-tumour activity of these compounds. This further supports that ribociclib 
can be used as add-on to AI +LHRH and also to fulvestrant +LHRH in pre/perimenopausal women.  
•  NSAI + LHRH as initial endocrine therapy in pre/perimenopausal patients (Study E2301), and from 
fulvestrant in postmenopausal patients who have received no or only one line of prior endocrine 
treatment (Study F2301) to combination with AI in patients who have received prior endocrine 
therapy 
The indication for second-line use of ribociclib in combination with AI can be supported by 
extrapolation from the demonstrated add-on effect to fulvestrant in the second line, in combination 
with evidence of efficacy in the first line in combination with AI. 
• 
From NSAI (letrozole or anastrozole) (Study E2301) to any aromatase inhibitor (AI) 
Extrapolation from NSAI to any aromatase inhibitor is considered acceptable based on the similarity 
of the mechanism of action of aromatase inhibitors in general, where inhibition of the aromatase 
enzyme will block the conversion of androgens to oestrogens. There are no DDI/PK issues between 
exemestane or anastrozole and ribociclib that preclude the extrapolation (see EPAR Kisqali). 
• 
From goserelin to any LHRH agonist (Study E2301) 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 101/136 
 
  
  
Based on similarity of the mechanism of action of LHRH agonist in general, this extrapolation is 
considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The PFS benefit of ribociclib observed in advanced disease in 1st line use as add on to a non-steroidal AI, and 
2nd line use as add-on to fulvestrant is of clear clinical benefit. The MAH is recommended to submit remaining 
and final OS analyses as post-authorisation measures.  
The available efficacy data is considered sufficient to support an indication in women with hormone receptor 
(HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, 
or in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The approval of ribociclib was primarily based on the pivotal Phase III A2301 study (MONALEESA 2) in which 
ribociclib in combination with an AI was investigated in a population of HR positive, HER 2 negative 
postmenopausal women. The most common ADRs (frequency of reports ≥20 %) for which the frequency for 
the experimental arm exceeded that of the control arm included neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea and 
vomiting. The most common grade 3/4 ADRs (frequency of reports ≥2 %) included neutropenia, leukopenia, 
abnormal liver function test, lymphopenia, hypophosphataemia, vomiting, nausea and fatigue. 
The MAH submitted safety data from the two pivotal studies supporting this application, study F2301 
(MONALEESA 3) and study E2301 (MONALEESA 7). 
Study F2301 (LEE011F2301, MONALEESA 3)  
The F2301 study is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled Phase III study conducted in 
postmenopausal women with HR positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer as 1st or 2nd line (after only 
one line of prior endocrine treatment) in combination with fulvestrant vs. fulvestrant alone. Also men were 
eligible but none was enrolled.  
The safety data base comprises data from the 483 patients exposed to ribociclib + fulvestrant in this study. 
There are also data submitted from an additional 13 patients exposed to the same regimen in the Phase Ib/II 
(dose-finding) X2108 study. The main focus for this assessment is on the Phase III study.

AEs of Special Interest (AESIs) 
QT interval prolongation and QTc 
QT interval prolongation was observed at a higher proportion with the ribociclib and fulvestrant combination 
(7.7%) as compared to the control arm (2.1%). The most frequent event within this AESI was prolonged 
electrocardiogram QT. No case of Torsades de Pointes or sudden death occurred.  
Based on central assessment of electrocardiogram (ECGs), 27 patients (5.6 %) in the test arm experienced 
a new QTc using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) intervals > 480 ms post-baseline including 8 patients (1.7 %) 
with a QTcF > 500 ms. A > 60 ms increase from baseline in QTcF interval was observed in 31 patients (6.5 
%).

Hepatobiliary toxicity events 
An increased hepatobiliary toxicity was observed in ribociclib + fulvestrant exposed patients (21.7%) in the 
F2301 study as compared to the control arm (14.9%). The two most frequent events within this AESI were 
increased ALT and increased AST at approximately similar rates. 
Based on clinical and laboratory data review, seven patients met the biochemical criteria for Hy’s Law and of 
these, two patients were confirmed Hy’s Law. Both patients permanently discontinued ribociclib and their 
liver function tests returned to baseline values. Both patients received ribociclib in combination with 
fulvestrant. 
Laboratory findings 
In the F2301 study the most frequently reported post-baseline haematological abnormalities (all grades) in 
the experimental arm  (with a ≥10% difference relative to the control arm) were decreased neutrophils 
(+71.0 %), decreased leukocytes (+68.7 %), decreased lymphocytes (+34.0 %), and decreased 
hemoglobin (+25.3 %). The majority of grade 3 abnormalities reported were decreased neutrophil and 
leukocyte counts whilst grade 4 was predominantly decreased neutrophil counts. 
In terms of post-baseline clinical chemistry abnormalities the most frequently reported (all grades) in the 
experimental arm (with a ≥ 5% difference relative to the control arm) were increased creatinine (+32.4 %), 
decreased phosphate (+9.3 %), increased ALT (+6.6 %), and increased AST (+6.3 %). Elevations in ALT 
and GGT were frequent grade 3 abnormalities whilst grade 4 was primarily due to elevated ALT. 
Safety in special populations 
All patients in the F2301 study were female. In terms of race, the vast majority was Caucasian (84 % and 88 
% in the test and control arm respectively). Asian patients enrolled were few (9 % and 8 % in the respective 
arms) thus hampering any conclusion on safety by race. In regard to safety by age categories (< 65 y vs. ≥ 
65 y) haematological AESIs was comparable between the two categories with the exception of neutropenia 
(72.4% vs. 66.4% respectively). The following were reported in a higher proportion in the younger age 
cohort as compared to the ≥ 65 years: infections (57.6 % vs. 48.7 %), hepatobiliary toxicities (24.1 % vs. 
19.0 %), infection-related AEs (11.3 % vs. 8.8 % including SAEs [7.0 % vs. 4.9 %]), hepatobiliary toxicity 
related AEs (grade 3/4 AEs [15.2 % vs. 10.2 %], suspected AEs [20.2 % vs. 16.4 %] and AEs needing dose 
adjustments or interruptions [16.7 % vs. 9.3 %]). 
The following AESIs were higher in proportion in patients ≥65 years: pulmonary toxicities, respiratory 
disorders (38.5 % vs. 28.8 % including grade 3/4 AEs [3.5 % vs. 0.4 %], SAEs [2.7 % vs. 0.8 %]) and renal 
toxicities (14.2 % vs. 7.0 %).

Study E2301 (CLEE011E2301, MONALEESA 7) 
The E2301 study is a randomised (1:1), double blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study conducted in pre 
and perimenopausal women with HR positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer in combination with a 
NSAI or tamoxifen plus goserelin vs. placebo in combination with a NSAI or tamoxifen plus goserelin. The 
safety data base comprises data from the 248 patients exposed to ribociclib + NSAI in this study. There are 
also data submitted from an additional 47 patients exposed to the same regimen in the Phase Ib, 
dose-escalation/expansion X2107 study.  
The main focus for this assessment is on the Phase III study and on the combination of ribociclib with NSAI. 
Data cut- off date: 20 Aug 2017.  
In some tables, reference is made to study A2301 (MONALEESA 2) which is the Phase III clinical study 
conducted in HR positive, HER 2 negative postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer with 
ribociclib in combination with an AI as 1st line therapy (see EPAR Kisqali and SmPC Section 5.1).

Deaths 
Table 83: Deaths while on treatment, by preferred terms in Study E2301 (Safety set) 
AEs of Special Interest (AESIs) 
QT interval prolongation and QTc 
The proportion of patients with ‘QT interval prolongation’ events was higher in the test arm (9.3 %) as 
compared to the control arm (3.2 %). Most events were Grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 events were reported in 1.2 
% of patients in test arm whilst none in the control arm. There were no Grade 4 events reported. Dose 
adjustments or interruptions were required 3.2 % of patients, and all were due to the AE of 
electrocardiogram QT prolonged. Syncope was reported in one patient (0.4%) with no action taken and the 
event resolved. One patient (0.4 %) in each arm discontinued study treatment due to event of ECG QT 
prolonged. QTcF prolongation was not associated with cardiac SAEs or arrhythmias and there were no events 
of cardiac arrest, sudden death, or Torsade de Pointes reported. 
Hepatobiliary toxicity events 
The proportion of patients with hepatobiliary toxicity events were similar between the test and control arm 
(21.0 % vs. 20.2%) and likewise the proportion of patients with grade 3 (7.3 % vs. 6.5 %) and grade 4 
events (0.8 % in both the treatment arms) were also similar. The most frequently reported events included: 
ALT increased (13.3 % vs. 8.9 %) and AST increased (12.9 % vs. 10.1 %). Dose interruptions or 
adjustments were required for 6.5% of patients in the test arm vs. 5.3% in the control arm, primarily due to 
ALT increased and AST increased. 
Eleven patients (4.4 %) in the test arm and three patients (1.2%) in the control arm discontinued study 
treatment due to hepatobiliary events. Notably, three patients and one patient in the respective arms 
discontinued treatment due to event of potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Based on the laboratory 
data, considering the biochemical Hy’s law criteria (AST/ALT >3.0x ULN and total bilirunin (TBL) >2.0xULN 
and ALP <2xULN) at any time during the treatment period, 3 cases (1 in the test arm and 2 in the control 
arm) were identified. Upon medical review, it was concluded that confounding factors were present, thus not 
meeting the three criteria needed to qualify for Hy's law.  
Laboratory findings 
In the E2301 study, post-baseline haematological laboratory abnormalities of any grade occurred in a higher 
proportion of patients in the test arm as compared to the control arm. Most were of grade 1 or2 in both 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018

treatment arms. The most frequent grade 3 in the test arm as compared to the control arm (≥10% 
difference) were decreased absolute neutrophil count (+51.2 %) and decreased leukocyte count (+33.9 %). 
Decreased neutrophils (9.3 %) were the most frequent grade 4 abnormality in the test arm. 
In terms of post-baseline biochemical laboratory abnormalities (any grade) occurred in similar proportions 
of patients in the both arms. Elevations in ALT (5.6 %) and GGT (5.2 %) were frequent grade 3 abnormalities 
whilst grade 4 was primarily due to elevated GGT (1.6%). Hypercholesterolemia (predominantly grade 1 or 
2) was noted in >50% of patients in both the treatment groups. Of note, there were 36.2 % and 27.9 % of 
patients who had grade 1 or 2 cholesterol at baseline in the in the respective arms. Post baseline findings 
were comparable between the two arms (60.5% and 55.1% respectively).  
Safety in special populations 
The E2301 study only enrolled female patients with a median age of 43 years (range 25 to 58 years) and all 
the patients were aged <65 years. Safety in the elderly population has already been assessed in the 
registrational study A2301. In the ribociclib group, the incidence of AEs was generally similar for patients in 
different age subgroups (<40 years and ≥ 40 years). Differences (≥10% across the age groups) were 
observed for few events including: back pain (+10.9 %) and diarrhoea (+10.4 %) which were more 
frequently reported amongst patients <40 years compared to≥40 years.  
In terms of race, about 56 % were Caucasian whilst Asian about 34 %. The incidence of AESIs in the test arm 
was generally comparable across the two subpopulations. ‘Infections’ events and ‘leukopenia’ events were 
more prominent in Caucasians (12.8 % and 29.4 % respectively) compared to Asian subpopulation (9.2 %

Post marketing experience 
The MAH performed a literature search to assess any new information in the public domain regarding data on 
safety with ribociclib during the reporting period of 22-Aug-2017 to the 21-Feb-2018. Ovid Medline, Embase, 
and Biosis Previews were searched with criteria inclusive of pregnancy outcomes (including termination) 
with no adverse outcomes, use in pediatric populations, compassionate supply, named patient use, lack of 
efficacy, asymptomatic overdose, abuse or misuse, medication error where no AEs occurred, “near misses”, 
and important nonclinical safety results. No new or significant safety findings were identified that impacted 
the current benefit-risk assessment of ribociclib. 
With regards to overdose, there is only limited experience with reported cases of overdosage with Kisqali. In 
the event of an overdose, symptoms such as nausea and vomiting may occur. In addition, haematological 
(e.g. neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) toxicity and possible QTc prolongation may occur. General supportive 
care should be initiated in all cases of overdosage as necessary. 
Adverse drug reactions 
The overall safety evaluation of Kisqali was based on the pooled dataset from 1,065 patients who received 
Kisqali in combination with endocrine therapy (N=582 in combination with an aromatase inhibitor and 
N=483 in combination with fulvestrant) and who were included in the randomised, double blind, placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018

controlled phase III clinical studies (MONALEESA 2, MONALEESA 7 NSAI subgroup and MONALEESA 3) in HR 
positive, HER2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The median duration of exposure to Kisqali 
treatment across the pooled phase III studies dataset was 16.5 months, with 61.7% patients exposed ≥12 
months. 
Dose reduction due to adverse events, regardless of causality, occurred in 37.3% of patients receiving 
Kisqali in the phase III clinical studies regardless of the combination and permanent discontinuation was 
reported in 7.0% of patients receiving Kisqali and any combination in the phase III clinical studies.

New ADRs which met the ADR screening and medical judgement criteria were included: infections 
(+10.8%), including: urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections (including upper and lower), 
gastroenteritis and sepsis (<1%); cough (+4.3%); dry skin (+6.1%); vertigo (+3.1%); oropharyngeal pain 
(+2.3%); rash pruritic (+1.1%; under umbrella term rash: +12.8%); abdominal pain upper (+2.1%; under 
umbrella term abdominal pain: +4.0%); vitiligo (+1.5%); dizziness (+1.6%); dry mouth (+1.6%). 
Three ADRs currently listed in the ribociclib approved label (Epistaxis, Weight decreased and Insomnia) have 
been removed based on the results of the assessment following the methodology described above: 
- Epistaxis did not meet any ADR screening criteria, showing a below threshold imbalance between ribociclib 
and placebo (+1.20%), no grade 3 and 4 events, and no events leading to discontinuation. In addition, a 
comprehensive evaluation of haemorrhage and possible association to thrombocytopenia was performed in 
the Argus safety database and did not reveal any noteworthy cases. 
- Weight decreased did not meet any ADR screening criteria, showing a below threshold imbalance between 
ribociclib and placebo (+1.30%); few grade 3 and 4 events were reported in both arms; with only one event 
leading to discontinuation in the ribociclib arm. The evaluation of the cases reported to the safety database 
showed few cases of Weight decreased (6 non-serious, and 2 serious); assessed by the MAH as unlikely 
related to ribociclib due to presence of confounders. 
- Insomnia showed a discrete imbalance between ribociclib and placebo (+1.0%), with a negative risk 
difference in study E2301 (more frequent in placebo); no events leading to discontinuation were reported; 
in Argus, 9 cases of Insomnia were reported, all nonserious, 7 of which were considered not assessable by 
both the reporters and the MAH. 
Considering four cases were reported as drug induced liver injury (DILI) in the ribociclib + AI arm (whereof 
two considered Grade 3) in the E2301 study, the frequency of this ADR has also been included in the SmPC. 
Based on the available data from the 3 pivotal Kisqali registration studies (MONALEESA-2, -3, and -7) the 
frequency category of “uncommon” (n=5 [0.5%]; N= 1065) has been included. 
Description of selected adverse drug reactions 
Neutropenia 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 122/136 
 
  
  
 
Among the patients who had grade 2, 3 or 4 neutropenia, the median time to onset was 16 days, for those 
patients who had an event. The median time to resolution of grade ≥3 (to normalisation or grade <3) was 
12 days in the Kisqali plus any combination arms following treatment interruption and/or reduction and/or 
discontinuation. Febrile neutropenia was reported in about 1.4% of patients exposed to Kisqali in the 
phase III studies.  
Hepatobiliary toxicity 
In the phase III clinical studies, hepatobiliary toxicity events occurred in a higher proportion of patients in 
the Kisqali plus any combination arms compared with the placebo plus any combination arms (23.2% versus 
16.5%, respectively), with more grade 3/4 adverse events reported in the patients treated with Kisqali plus 
any combination (11.4% versus 5.4%, respectively). Increases in transaminases were observed. Grade 3 or 
4 increases in ALT (9.7% versus 1.5%) and AST (6.7% versus 2.1%) were reported in the Kisqali and 
placebo arms, respectively. Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of 
normal and total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of normal, with normal alkaline 
phosphatase, in the absence of cholestasis occurred in 6 patients (4 patients in Study A2301 
[MONALEESA-2], whose levels recovered to normal within 154 days and 2 patients in Study F2301 
[MONALEESA-3], whose levels recovered to normal in 121 and 532 days, respectively, after discontinuation 
of Kisqali. There were no such cases reported in Study E2301 (MONALEESA-7). 
Dose interruptions and/or adjustments due to hepatobiliary toxicity events were reported in 10.4% of Kisqali 
plus any combination treated patients, primarily due to ALT increased (6.9%) and/or AST increased (6.1%). 
Discontinuation of treatment with Kisqali plus any combination due to abnormal liver function tests or 
hepatotoxicity occurred in 2.3% and 0.4% of patients respectively. 
In the phase III clinical studies, 83.2% (89/107) of grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevation events occurred within 
the first 6 months of treatment. Among the patients who had grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation, the median 
time to onset was 85 days for the Kisqali plus any combination arms. The median time to resolution (to 
normalisation or grade ≤2) was 22 days in the Kisqali plus any combination arms. 
QT prolongation 
In the phase III clinical studies 8.4% of patients in the Kisqali plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms 
and 3.2% in the placebo plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms had at least one event of QT interval 
prolongation (including ECG QT prolonged and syncope). Review of ECG data showed 14 patients (1.3%) 
had >500 msec post-baseline QTcF value, and 59 patients (5.6%) had a >60 msec increase from baseline 
in QTcF intervals. There were no reported cases of torsade de pointes. Dose interruptions/adjustments were 
reported in 2.3% of Kisqali plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant treated patients due to electrocardiogram 
QT prolonged and syncope. 
The analysis of ECG data showed 52 patients (4.9%) and 11 patients (1.4%) with at least one >480 msec 
post-baseline QTcF for the Kisqali plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms and the placebo plus 
aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant arms, respectively. Amongst the patients who had QTcF prolongation 
>480 msec, the median time to onset was 15 days regardless of the combination and these changes were 
reversible with dose interruption and/or dose reduction. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant 
The study F2301 (MONALEESA 3) enrolled postmenopausal women treated with ribociclib + fulvestrant 
(N=483) vs. placebo + fulvestrant (N=241) as 1st or 2nd line (after only one line of prior endocrine 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 123/136 
 
  
  
 
treatment). Male breast cancer patients were also eligible but none were enrolled. The safety profiles 
between ribociclib + AI and ribociclib + fulvestrant are considered similar (Table 85). 
Median duration of exposure to ribociclib + fulvestrant was 16 months as compared to 12 months for the 
control arm. About 58 % of the patients were exposed to the ribociclib + fulvestrant combination for 12 
months or more with 39 % for ≥ 18 months meaning that there is an acceptable level of available long term 
safety data for the combination. The corresponding data for the control arm is 49 % and 31 %. It is 
considered that a sufficient number of patients have been exposed to ribociclib in combination with 
fulvestrant. 
Median relative dose intensity (RDI) was 92 % (22.7 to 133.3) in patients receiving ribociclib + fulvestrant 
compared with 100 % (56.6 to 118.6) in patients receiving placebo + fulvestrant. 
Dose reductions (overall 37.9 %), dose interruptions (75.4 %), and dosing delays (51.3 %) were in general 
due to AEs (33.1 %, 68.5 % and 44.9 % respectively). It is noted that whilst dose reductions were not 
required in the majority of patients in the test arm (62.1 %), dose interruptions and delays were commonly 
reported. Median time to first dose reduction was 13.0 weeks in patients who received ribociclib + 
fulvestrant vs. 21 weeks in the control arm and median time to first dose interruption was 4  weeks vs. 12 
weeks in the respective arms. In the control arm, the majority did not require any dose reduction, dose 
interruption or dose delay.  
In terms of primary reason for end of treatment, progressive disease was the primary reason in 40 % and 59 
% in the test and control arm respectively while a low proportion was due to AEs (8.5 % and 4.1 
respectively). 
The majority of AEs were considered drug related. The SOCs where a higher proportion of patients receiving 
ribociclib + fulvestrant reported events with ≥ 10% difference relative to placebo included: Blood and 
lymphatic disorders (+54.0 %); Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (+30.8 %); Investigations (+26.9 
%); Gastrointestinal disorders (+18.9 %), Infections and infestations (+13.8 %) and Eye disorders (+11.4 
%). 
Overall, grade 3 and grade 4 events were observed at a higher proportion with ribociclib + fulvestrant (64.0 
% and 14.3 %, respectively) vs. the control arm (25.3 % vs. 4.1 %, respectively). A higher proportion of 
patients in the experimental arm reported grade 3/4 events by SOC (with ≥ 5% difference relative to 
matching placebo) that included:  Blood and lymphatic disorders (+43.7 %) and Investigations (+24.6 %). 
The most common AEs (≥30%) irrespective of causal relationship reported with the ribociclib + fulvestrant 
combination were neutropenia, nausea and fatigue. It is recognised that overall, most events were of Grade 
1 or 2. AEs where a higher proportion of patients receiving ribociclib +  fulvestrant reported events (with ≥ 
10% difference relative the control arm) included e.g. neutropenia (+55.1%), , nausea (+17.1%), vomiting 
(+13.8%), constipation (+13.2%), rash (+12.6%), and anaemia (+11.2%). 
Grade 3/4 AEs irrespective of causal relationship were reported at a higher proportion in the test arm 
(78.3%) vs. the control arm (29.5 %). By grade, grade 3 and grade 4 events were observed at a higher 
proportion in the test arm (64.0 % and 14.3 % respectively) as compared to the control (25.3 % and 4.1 % 
respectively). Of these, grade 3 AEs with ribociclib + fulvestrant treatment reported in ≥5 % of patients 
included e.g. neutropenia (36.6 %) and increased ALT (6.6 %) vs. grade 4 AE neutropenia (5.8 %). 
A higher proportion of SAEs was observed in the ribociclib + fulvestrant combination arm (28.6%) as 
compared to the control arm (16.6%). Pneumonia was the most frequent SAE in 9 patients (1.9 %) in the 
experimental arm.  
The proportion of on-treatment deaths (defined as deaths up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment) 
was comparable between the treatment arms (2.7 % in the experimental arm vs. 3.3% in the control arm). 
The majority was due to the disease under study, in six cases in the ribociclib + fulvestrant arm death was

EMA/888562/2018

associated with AEs. None raised any immediate concern. According to the narratives, there was no evidence 
of any negative effect on QT in association the either the case of cardiac failure or the case with ventricular 
arrhythmia.   
QT interval prolongation was observed at a higher proportion with the ribociclib and fulvestrant combination 
(7.7%) as compared to the control arm (2.1%). QT interval prolongation is reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
4.8 in the Kisqali SmPC in addition to being adjudicated as an important identified risk in the safety 
specification and thus considered adequately covered in the SmPC.  
Hepatobiliary toxicity is reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 in the Kisqali SmPC in addition to being 
adjudicated as an important identified risk in the safety specification thus considered adequately covered. 
Four cases were reported as drug induced liver injury (DILI) in the ribociclib + AI arm in the E2301 study 
whilst one in the ribociclib + fulvestrant arm in the F2301 study. The current presentation of hepatic safety 
information in section 4.8 includes hepatotoxicity as an umbrella term with an explanatory footnote 
including other relevant PTs including DILI (with frequency uncommon). This is considered adequate.  
No additional safety concerns were raised in the elderly subgroup. No overall differences in safety of Kisqali 
were observed between these patients and younger patients (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Ribociclib in combination with an AI 
Whereas the registrational study A2301 (MONALEESA 2) studied ribociclib in combination with an AI in a 
population of postmenopausal women, the E2301 study (MONALEESA 7) is investigating the combination in 
pre-/ peri-menopausal women (with the addition of goserelin).  
The dossier included also data from a treatment arm with ribociclib in combination with tamoxifen. Due to 
the propensity for QT prolongation associated with both these drugs, an indication for this combination has 
not been pursued and consequently an assessment of the safety profile for this combination has not been 
carried out. The risk of QT prolongation with concomitant treatment with ribociclib and tamoxifen is 
considered adequately reflected in the SmPC (see SmPC 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).  
In study E2301, median duration of exposure to ribociclib + AI was 15.1 months as compared to 12.8 
months for the control arm. About 67 % of the patients were exposed to the ribociclib + AI combination for 
12 months or more with 32 % for ≥ 18 months meaning that there is (as with the F2301 study) an 
acceptable level of available long term safety data for the experimental combination. The corresponding 
data for the control arm is 51 % and 24 %. Overall, in regard to long term safety, it is considered that a 
sufficient number of patients have been exposed to ribociclib in combination with an AI and in combination 
with fulvestrant (see above, study F2301) providing sufficient data for a reasonable characterization of the 
safety profile in the long term perspective. 
Dose reductions (overall 37.0 %), dose interruptions (78.0 %), and dosing delays (58.9 %) were in general 
due to AEs (33. 3 %, 69.9 % and 53.7 % respectively). As observed in the F2301 study dose reductions were 
not required in the majority of patients in the test arm (63.0 %), however dose interruptions and delays 
were commonly reported. The median time to first dose reduction of ribociclib was ~ 10 weeks. These 
observations are in line with the findings in the F2301 study. 
There were no major differences in the safety profile as identified in the E2301 study and the one 
characterized in the original A2301 study with the exception that there were overall higher proportions of 
AEs, by severity and SAEs reported in the latter which is likely attributed to the age differences in the 
population studied in the respective studies (median 43 and 62 years of age in E2301 and A2301 
respectively). The majority of all AEs including those leading to dose adjustments in the experimental arm in 
study E2301 were considered drug related. 
AEs were experienced by almost all in the respective arms (97.6% and 92.7% in the test and control arm 
respectively). The most frequently reported AEs regardless of study treatment relationship by SOC in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018

test arm (in ≥50% of patients) were gastrointestinal disorders (66.5%), blood and lymphatic system 
disorders (62.9%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (60.5%), investigations (58.9%) and 
general disorders and administration site conditions (52.4%). Compared to the registrational A2301 study 
(postmenopausal women), there was a decrease in proportions of reports all through the SOCs.   
The proportion of most of the AEs was comparable between the E2301 and A2301 studies. Differences were 
noted for the following AEs (reported less frequently in the E2301): nausea (31.5 % vs. 53.3 %), fatigue 
(23.4 % vs. 41.3 %), diarrhoea (19.8 % vs. 38.3 %), alopecia (20.6 % vs. 34.4 %), vomiting (17.3 % vs. 
33.5 %), constipation (16.1 % vs. 27.8 %), and decreased appetite (6.5 % vs. 20.7 %).  
The majority of patients (77.0 %) in the test arm had grade 3/4 AE (63.7 % and 13.3 %, grade 3 and grade 
4 respectively). Grade 3/4 events were reported in 31.2 % in the placebo group (27.1 % and 4.0 %, grade 
3 and grade 4 respectively). The most frequent grade 3 AEs (with incidence ≥ 20 %) in the test arm were 
neutropenia (39.1 %) and decreased neutrophil count (23.4 %). The incidence of grade 3/4 AEs in ribociclib 
exposed patients is essentially similar between the E2301 and A2301 studies.  
The proportion of patients with SAEs was essentially similar between the experimental (16.9 %) and the 
control arm (13.4 %) in the E2301 study. None of the SAEs were reported in ≥ 2% of patients. In the test 
arm, drug-induced liver injury (4 patients, 1.6 %) and abdominal pain, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, and 
back pain (each reported in 3 patients, 1.2 %) were the most commonly occurring SAEs. SAEs suspected to 
be drug related were reported in 4.8 % of patients in the ribociclib containing arm which included 
drug-induced liver injury (1.6 %) and febrile neutropenia (1.2 %).   
As of the data cut-off date, a total of 66 deaths had occurred: 30 (12.1 %) in the test arm and 36 (14.6 %) 
in the control arm. Most of these deaths in both treatment groups (10.9 % and (12.6 % in the test arm and 
control respectively) were attributed to the study indication or underlying malignancy. 
On-treatment deaths (defined as deaths occurring during study and within 30 days of the last dose of study 
treatment) were reported for six patients: one patient (0.4 %) in the experimental arm and five patients (2.0 
%) in the control arm. All six cases were attributed to disease progression. 
The proportion of patients with ‘QT interval prolongation’ events was higher in the test arm (9.3 %) as 
compared to the control arm (3.2 %). QT interval prolongation is reflected in the SmPC and included in the 
RMP as discussed above. As part of this application, the MAH also presented safety data in combination with 
tamoxifen. The observed mean QTcF increase from baseline was approximately 10 msec higher in the 
tamoxifen plus placebo subgroup compared with the NSAI plus placebo subgroup, suggesting that tamoxifen 
alone had a QTcF prolongation effect which can contribute to the QTcF values observed in the Kisqali plus 
tamoxifen group. In the placebo arm, a QTcF interval increase of >60 msec from baseline occurred in 6/90 
(6.7%) patients receiving tamoxifen and in no patients receiving a NSAI. A QTcF interval increase of >60 
msec from baseline was observed in 14/87 (16.1%) patients receiving Kisqali plus tamoxifen and in 18/245 
(7.3%) patients receiving Kisqali plus a NSAI. Kisqali is not recommended to be used in combination with 
tamoxifen (see SmPC section 4.8). 
There were four cases of drug induced liver injury (DILI) reported in the ribociclib + AI arm. Hepatobiliary 
toxicity is reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 in the Kisqali SmPC including DILI in section 4.8 with the 
frequency uncommon.  
The proportion of study drug discontinuations due to AEs in ribociclib exposed patients in the E2301 study 
was low (6.5 %). The treatment discontinuation rate due to AEs was higher in the A2301study (16.8 %) as 
compared to the E2301 study with a higher proportion of individual events. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been revised to reflect updated frequencies from the pooled dataset from the 
three pivotal phase III clinical studies (study A2301, study E2301 and study F2301). New ADRs which met 
the ADR screening and medical judgement criteria were included: infections, cough, dry skin, vertigo, 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 126/136 
 
  
  
oropharyngeal pain, rash pruritic, abdominal pain upper, vitiligo, dizziness and dry mouth. Three ADRs 
currently listed in the ribociclib approved label (Epistaxis, Weight decreased and Insomnia) have been 
removed based on the results of the assessment. This is considered acceptable. 
There are no new safety concerns or signals identified in either the E2301 or the F2301 study warranting a 
change of the RMP. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There were no new safety signals or concerns observed in the safety datebase from studies E2301 and 
F2301. The safety profile in study E2301 of ribociclib in combination with an AI in a population of 
pre/perimenopausal women is similar to study A2301 performed in postmenopausal women. In addition, the 
safety profile is in line with the safety observed with ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant, suggesting a 
similar safety profile of ribociclib regardless of the choice of accompanying endocrine therapy. The important 
safety concerns have been previously characterised with the main concerns with ribociclib being 
myelosuppression (primarily neutropenia), hepatobiliary toxicity and QT interval prolongation. These are 
considered to be adequately reflected in the SmPC as well as covered in the RMP. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

Study CLEE011A2301 (MONALEESA-2) : A randomized 
double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study of 
ribociclib in combination with letrozole for the 
treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+, 
HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received 
no prior therapy for advanced disease. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some editorial changes in the SmPC and the list of local 
representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representative(s) of Lithuania 
and Estonia.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
This application does not include significant changes to the currently approved Kisqali PL and therefore the 
results of the initial consultation with the target patient population are still considered valid and it is not 
considered necessary to perform any new user testing for this variation application. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kisqali (ribociclib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed change of indication is: 
“Kisqali is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in 
combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women 
who have received prior endocrine therapy. 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing 
hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Breast cancer is estimated to cause about 500 000 deaths worldwide annually. A proportion of patients will 
eventually relapse with progression of the disease. For ER+, HER2-negative patients, the following 
treatment options are relevant as initial endocrine-based therapy or in women who have received prior 
endocrine therapy: 
• 
First line endocrine therapy; aromatase inhibitors (AI), tamoxifen, fulvestrant, AI + CDK4/6 
inhibitor, AI + everolimus (conditional on adjuvant AI). 
•  Second line endocrine therapy; AI, tamoxifen, fulvestrant, fulvestrant + palbociclib, AI + 
everolimus, and megestrol acetate. 
According to treatment guidelines, chemotherapy should be reserved for cases of rapidly progressive 
disease or proven endocrine resistance. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two trials support the change of indication: 
Assessment report  
EMA/888562/2018 
Page 130/136 
 
  
  
•  Study CLEE011E2301 (MONALEESA 7) 
A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre phase III clinical study in the treatment 
of pre- and perimenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative advanced breast 
cancer in combination with a NSAI or tamoxifen plus goserelin versus placebo in combination with a 
NSAI or tamoxifen plus goserelin. 
Due to safety concerns regarding QT prolongation for the combination with tamoxifen, the applicant 
proposes not to include the use of ribociclib in combination with tamoxifen. 
•  Study CLEE011F2301 (MONALEESA 3) 
A randomised double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre phase III clinical study in the treatment 
of men and postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative advanced 
breast cancer who had received no or only one line of prior endocrine treatment, in combination with 
fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
MONALEESA 7 (E2301): 
• 
PFS by investigator (primary endpoint), median 23.8 vs. 13.0 months in ribociclib + NSAI/tamoxifen 
vs. placebo + NSAI/tamoxifen, HR 0.55 (p = 9.8 x 10-8). Event rate 39% vs. 56%. 
•  OS, median NR vs. 29.4 months, HR 0.92 (p= 0.34). Event rate 13% vs. 14%. 
MONALEESA 3 (F2301): 
• 
PFS by investigator (primary endpoint), median 20.5 vs. 12.8 months in ribociclib + fulvestrant vs. 
placebo + fulvestrant, HR 0.59 (p = 4.1 x 10-7). Event rate 43% vs. 62%. 
•  OS, median NR vs. NR, HR 0.67 (p= 0.015). Event rate 15% vs. 21%. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Overall survival data is immature with <15% event rate in MONALEESA 7 and 3. Thus, the post progression 
disease-course is uncertain. Nevertheless, a detrimental OS effect is unlikely given the large 
treatment-effect on PFS and based on the evaluation of deaths on study and in follow up. The results of the 
next OS interim analysis and the final analysis are expected to be provided for the two clinical studies 
post-authorisation as soon as available.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Whereas study A2301 (MONALEESA 2) studied ribociclib in combination with an AI in a population of 
postmenopausal women, the E2301 study (MONALEESA 7) investigated the combination in pre-/ 
peri-menopausal women (with the addition of goserelin). No differences were observed in the overall safety 
profile and individual AEs reported in study E2301 as compared to study A2301 other than an overall higher 
proportion of AEs by severity and SAEs reported in study A2301. This may in part reflect the age differences 
in the respective patient populations studied (median 43 and 62 years of age in E2301 and A2301 
respectively).  
The application for approval for the indication in combination with fulvestrant is mainly based on the F2301 
study (MONALEESA 3) enrolling postmenopausal women to receive ribociclib + fulvestrant (N=483) vs. 
placebo + fulvestrant (N=241) as 1st or 2nd line (after only one line of prior endocrine treatment). Also male 
Assessment report

Page 131/136 
 
  
  
breast cancer patients were eligible but none were enrolled. The safety profiles between ribociclib + AI and 
ribociclib + fulvestrant are considered similar. 
Overall, the most common ADRs and the most common grade 3/4 ADRs (reported at a frequency ≥20% and 
≥2%, respectively) in the pooled dataset for which the frequency for Kisqali plus letrozole any combination 
exceeds the frequency for placebo plus letrozole any combination were infections, neutropenia, leukopenia, 
headache, cough, back pain, nausea, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, alopecia and rash, and 
infections, neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, abnormal liver function tests, lymphopenia, 
hypophosphataemia, and vomiting, nausea, fatigue and back pain, respectively. 
The available data are sufficient for a reasonable characterization of the safety profile in the long term 
perspective. 
Ribociclib showed foetotoxicity and teratogenicity at doses which did not show maternal toxicity in the rats 
or rabbits. Furthermore, ribociclib and its metabolites passed readily into rat milk. Considering available non 
clinical data, the SmPC has been adequately updated to include warnings and precautions in relation to 
pregnancy and breastfeeding. 
The SmPC has also been adequately updated to revise the frequencies of adverse drug reactions based on 
the pooled dataset (A2301, E2301 and F2301) and add the following new ADRs: infections, cough, dry skin, 
vertigo, oropharyngeal pain, rash pruritic, abdominal pain upper, vitiligo, dizziness and dry mouth. Apart 
from these changes, there are no new safety concerns or signals identified in either the E2301 or the F2301 
study.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In advanced breast cancer, a PFS gain of 11 months in first line use of ribociclib as add on to a non-steroidal 
AI compared to NSAI alone in premenopausal patients, and a PFS gain of 8 months for the 1st and 2nd line 
population assessed in the fulvestrant add-on study, is considered clinically relevant and important. The 
effect sizes observed are consistent with other approved CDK4/6 inhibitors. 
The safety from study E2301 investigating ribociclib in combination with an AI in a population of 
pre/perimenopausal women is similar to the safety data from study A2301 performed in postmenopausal 
women. Therefore, no new concerns have been raised during the study which reflects the known safety 
profile of ribociclib. The safety profile is also in line with the safety of ribociclib in combination with 
fulvestrant suggesting that no differences in the safety profile are expected depending on the choice of 
accompanying endocrine therapy. No new signals or concerns were raised from the safety database from the 
two studies. The important safety concerns with ribociclib are myelosuppression (primarily neutropenia), 
hepatobiliary toxicity and QT interval prolongation which are considered to be adequately reflected in the 
SmPC as well as covered in the RMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Study MONALEESA 7 (study E2301) showed a clinical relevant effect in PFS for the combination therapy of 
ribociclib with an aromatase inhibitor and an LHRH agonist as initial endocrine therapy in 
pre/peri-menopausal women with HR positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer. Study MONALEESA 3 
(study F2301) also showed a clinical relevant effect in PFS for the combination with fulvestrant as initial 
endocrine-based therapy, or after progression on one line of endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women 
with HR positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer. Although the OS data from the two studies are still 
immature, a detrimental effect is unlikely given the large treatment-effect on PFS and based on the 
evaluation of deaths. 
The toxicity of ribociclib regardless of accompanying endocrine therapy is considered manageable with 
appropriate risk minimization measures as described in the product information and in the RMP. 
The extrapolation to ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant + LHRH in pre/perimenopausal women is 
accepted. Efficacy has been shown for ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women 
(MONALEESA 3 (study F2301)), and in combination with aromatase inhibitors in premenopausal women 
(MONALEESA 7 (study E2301)), supporting the extrapolation. Fulvestrant is an accepted option for 
premenopausal patients as effective inhibition of ER signalling is achieved with fulvestrant or AI alike 
(+LHRH).  
The extrapolation of the indication for second-line use of ribociclib in combination with AI can be supported 
by the demonstrated add-on effect to fulvestrant in the second line (Study F2301) as well as the evidence of 
the efficacy demonstrated in first line in combination with AI (Study E2301). 
Based on the above, the benefit/risk balance of ribociclib for the treatment of women with HR positive, HER2 
negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or 
fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women who have received prior endocrine therapy is 
positive.

Not applicable.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of ribociclib for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in 
combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in women who 
have received prior endocrine therapy is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition

Extension of Indication to include treatment of patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in 
combination with fulvestrant for Kisqali; in pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy 
(aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) should be combined with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone 
(LHRH) agonist. The extension to the indication is based upon data from study CLEE011E2301 (A Phase III 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of LEE011 or placebo in combination with tamoxifen and 
goserelin or a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) and goserelin for the treatment of premenopausal 
women with hormone receptor positive, HER2- negative, advanced breast cancer) and study CLEE011F2301 
(A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the 
treatment of men and postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, advanced 
breast cancer who have received no or only one line of prior endocrine treatment). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been updated 
and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
some editorial changes in the SmPC and to make an administrative update to the Estonian and Latvian local 
representatives addresses in the Package Leaflet. An updated RMP version 3.0 was agreed. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

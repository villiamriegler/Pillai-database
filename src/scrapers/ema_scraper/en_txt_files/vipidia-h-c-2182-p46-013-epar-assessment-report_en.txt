safety of alogliptin compared with placebo in paediatric subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. 
Study No.  SYR-309_322 (EudraCT number 2015-000208-25). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Alogliptin has been evaluated in a comprehensive clinical development program comprising more than 
50 clinical studies and involving more than 20,000 adult patients. In adults, treatment with alogliptin 
12.5 or 25 mg QD for 26 weeks resulted in statistically significant LS mean reductions in HbA1c and 
FPG levels compared with placebo. 
The MAH now submitted a paediatric study. 
Primary Objective: 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 25 mg alogliptin once daily (QD) 
compared with placebo when administered as monotherapy, or when added onto a background of 
metformin alone, insulin alone, or a combination of metformin and insulin, as measured by the

• 
• 
The incidence of hypoglycemic events, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical 
laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, physical examinations, and vital 
signs. 
The effects on biomarkers of bone turnover (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal 
telopeptide [CTX]) markers at Weeks 26 and 52. 
The effects on CD26 surface antigen levels at Weeks 26 and 52. 
Additional Objectives: 
Exploratory objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate clinically meaningful levels of response in HbA1c after treatment with alogliptin 
compared with placebo at Weeks 26 and 52. 
To evaluate other measures of glycemic control after treatment with alogliptin compared with 
placebo including 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) excursion test at Weeks 26 and 52. 
To evaluate incidence and time to hyperglycemic rescue. 
To evaluate the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) change from baseline after treatment with 
alogliptin compared with placebo at Weeks 12, 26, and 52. 
To evaluate changes from baseline in lipids, including total cholesterol, high- and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]/low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol [LDL-C]), and triglycerides after treatment with alogliptin compared with placebo at 
Weeks 12, 26, and 52. 
To evaluate changes in body weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) after treatment with 
alogliptin compared with placebo at Weeks 26 and 52. 
To evaluate plasma concentrations of alogliptin using a sparse sampling approach. 
Methodology: 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of 25 mg alogliptin QD compared with placebo in pediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 
years, inclusive, at the time of randomization, with a confirmed diagnosis of T2DM who were 
experiencing inadequate glycemic control. 
Subjects entered into a screening period of up to 2 weeks. If certain entry criteria were not met, 
subjects participated in a pre-randomization stabilization period. If subjects met the objectives of the 
pre-randomization stabilization period, they returned to the clinic (Week -1) to confirm qualification for 
all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects were assigned to 1 of 2 schedules (Schedule A or B) based 
on the antidiabetic therapy they had been receiving for the 12 weeks before the screening period.

On Study Day 1, eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups, 25 
mg alogliptin QD or matching placebo. In addition to receiving double-blind study treatment, subjects 
were required to maintain their background antidiabetic therapy (if applicable) at the same dose 
throughout the first 26 weeks of the double-blind treatment period. Subjects who completed the 52-
week double-blind treatment period completed an end-of-treatment visit and a follow-up visit 2 weeks 
after the end-of-treatment visit, which is summarized in the following figure: 
Subjects who terminated double-blind study treatment prematurely also completed an end-of-
treatment visit and a follow-up visit 2 weeks after the end-of-treatment visit. They were followed for 
the 52-week duration of the study and completed a projected Week 52 visit. 
Number of Subjects: 152 
Planned: 150 subjects 
Screened: 285 subjects 
Enrolled in the double-blind treatment period: 152 subjects 
Analyzed: 
Safety analysis set: 151 subjects (randomized but not treated: 1 subject) 
Full analysis set (FAS): 151 subjects 
Per protocol analysis set (PPS): 45 subjects 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) set: 150 subjects. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: 
Subjects were children or adolescents aged 10 to 17 years with a confirmed diagnosis of T2DM using 
the American Diabetes Association and World Health Organization criteria: laboratory determinations of 
FPG >126 mg/dL; random glucose >200 mg/dL (≥11.10 mmol/L); HbA1c ≥6.5%; or 2-hour oral 
glucose tolerance test glucose >200 mg/dL, which was documented in the subjects’ medical record.

Additional criteria required for randomization included the following: an HbA1c level of ≥6.5% to 
<11.0% if the subject was on metformin alone or ≥7.0% to <11.0% if the subject was on insulin alone 
or in combination with metformin. Subjects who were anticipated as being able to meet these 
randomization criteria following medical oversight (i.e., washout of prior medications, adjustment to 
their metformin or insulin doses, adjustment to antihypertensive regimen) by the investigator were 
allowed entry into a pre-randomization stabilization period. Once subjects met the objectives of the 
pre-randomization stabilization period, they returned to the clinic to confirm qualification for all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in the protocol.

Statistical Methods 
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.4. 
Efficacy 
Efficacy analyses were conducted using the FAS. Supportive analyses were conducted with the PPS for 
the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Efficacy values collected >1 day after the last dose of 
double-blind study treatment (>7 days for HbA1c) were considered posttreatment values and were 
listed but not analyzed. If subjects were observed to down-titrate background antidiabetic therapy 
while continuing study treatment, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for primary and secondary 
endpoints by excluding data collected after the down-titration based on the PPS. 
A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used for several efficacy endpoints and, unless 
otherwise specified, general practices were employed when using MMRM analysis. In this MMRM model, 
change from baseline in HbA1c was the response variable; randomized treatment, scheduled visit 
(Weeks 12, 18, 26, 39, and 52), antidiabetic therapy (Yes/No, which was also known as Schedule 
B/A), and visit-by-treatment interaction were fixed categorical effects, and baseline HbA1c and visit-
by-baseline HbA1c interaction were continuous covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix was 
used to model the correlation among repeated measurements; parameter estimates were calculated 
using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. In a scenario where the unstructured covariance 
matrix sometimes caused a nonconvergence issue in computational practice, it was replaced with a 
compound symmetry covariance matrix. Degrees of freedom were estimated using the Kenward-Roger 
approximation, and the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normality of the residuals from each 
continuous endpoint that was examined using an MMRM model. If the hypothesis of normality was

rejected, the natural logarithm was applied to the measurements at each timepoint, the model was re-
fit, and model-based quantities were back-transformed and expressed on the ratio scale. 
Before data unblinding, the sponsor’ study team identified those subjects who were classified as 
“impacted by COVID-19”. Subjects were identified as impacted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19) if they had a COVID-19–related protocol deviation leading to site closure, missingness, self-
withdrawal, adverse event (AE), or concomitant medication. A supplemental analysis that excluded 
subjects affected by COVID-19 was performed on the primary endpoint. Information concerning a 
subject being impacted due to COVID-19 before or at the Week 26 visit was collected for sensitivity 
analysis for primary endpoint as a protocol deviation, including but not limited to, site closure, 
missingness, self-withdrawal, AE, concomitant medications. 
Safety 
AEs were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 24.0. 
AE summary tables included numbers and percentages of subjects who experienced at least 1 AE by 
System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Unless otherwise specified, AEs were sorted by 
relative frequency (highest to lowest) in the alogliptin arm; in instances where the AE summary was 2-
tiered, the AEs were sorted alphabetically at the first tier (e.g., SOC) and relative frequency at the 
second tier (e.g., PT). 
A subject with 2 or more different AEs within the same level of MedDRA term were counted only once 
in that level using the most extreme incident (most intense for the intensity tables and related for the 
relationship to study treatment tables). Any AE with missing relationship to drug/procedure was 
imputed as an event related to study treatment. For summary table purposes, it was assumed that AEs 
with missing/incomplete start dates had occurred during the treatment period if there was not enough 
information to determine that the AEs occurred before the first dose date. Pretreatment events (PTEs), 
AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to study treatment withdrawn, AEs leading to study 
discontinuation, and AEs resulting in death were listed separately. 
Clinical safety laboratory evaluations included clinical hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis. 
Vital sign measurements included body temperature (oral or tympanic measurement), respiratory rate, 
blood pressure (resting more than 5 minutes), and pulse. All clinical laboratory data were presented in 
both SI and conventional units in data listings. Laboratory evaluations and vital sign assessments were 
summarized for baseline, postdose, and change from baseline at each visit. Only the scheduled 
measurements were included in the summaries. Individual results for hematology and serum chemistry 
laboratory evaluations, as well as vital sign assessments, were evaluated against the Takeda 
predefined laboratory markedly abnormal value (MAV) criteria using the result and criteria in SI units 
(as applicable). The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 postdose MAV were also 
summarized for laboratory assessments and listed for vital signs. All postdose clinical laboratory and 
vital sign results, including scheduled and unscheduled measurements, were included in MAV 
summaries. 
Other observations related to safety were summarized and assessed as applicable. These included 
results of physical examinations,12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and hypoglycemic 
events. In addition, study sites collected information on the following adverse events of special interest 
(AESIs): serious hepatic abnormalities; pancreatitis; infections (including urinary tract infections); and 
severe hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. 
CD26 surface antigen levels were summarized for baseline, postdose, and change from baseline for 
each parameter at each visit. 
Biomarkers

Biomarkers of bone turnover were summarized for baseline, postdose, and change from baseline value 
for each parameter at each visit. If data permitted, an MMRM model of the same form as that for the 
primary endpoint was fitted to each parameter and similar quantities were extracted. 
PK 
Descriptive statistics (n, geometric mean, SD, percent coefficient of variation (CV%), median, 
minimum and maximum) were used to summarize the plasma PK concentrations for alogliptin. The PK 
sample set was used for analysis. 
Disposition of Subjects 
A total of 285 subjects signed consent forms and 152 subjects were ultimately randomized to 
treatment. One subject who did not meet the inclusion criterion for HbA1c was randomized in error but 
was not treated. As shown in the figure below, of the 285 consented subjects, 82 failed screening, 108 
entered the double-blind treatment phase, and 95 entered the pre-randomization phase. Among the 95 
subjects who entered the pre-randomization phase, 43 were deemed eligible and 52 were ineligible for 
double-blind treatment. Ineligibility was determined on the basis of not meeting entrance criteria (41 
subjects), voluntary withdrawal (5 subjects), lost to follow-up (3 subjects),“other”(2 subjects), and 
PTE (1 subject). 
Schematic Representation of Subject Disposition 
The majority of subjects (126 [82.9]%) completed all study visits; 25 (16.4%) discontinued study 
treatment, and 22 (14.5%) discontinued the study. Additional details of subject disposition are 
provided in the table below.

Efficacy Results 
No statistically significant difference was observed between treatment with 25 mg alogliptin compared 
with placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint of HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 26 among 
subjects for the FAS or PPS, the sensitivity analysis of the FAS, or any subgroups including the 
Schedule A patients without background antidiabetic therapy and Schedule B patients on background 
therapy of metformin and/or insulin. Similar results were observed for the secondary endpoints of 
HbA1c change from Baseline at Weeks 12, 18, 39, and 52 among subjects in the FAS and the PPS. 
Data for the HbA1c change from baseline at Week 26 for the FAS are summarized in the table below:

Subjects who received hyperglycemic rescue before the endpoint at the timepoint of interest were 
excluded from the analysis for the endpoint at that timepoint. 
LS means, SEs, CIs, and p-values were obtained using an MMRM model with randomized treatment, 
scheduled visit, antidiabetic therapy (yes/no), and visit-by-treatment interaction as categorical effects, 
and baseline HbA1c and visit-by-baseline HbA1c interaction as continuous covariates. An unstructured 
covariance matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements. 
Biomarker Results 
No statistically significant differences were observed between the alogliptin and placebo treatment 
groups for biomarkers of bone turnover (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and CTX). 
Safety Results 
No deaths occurred during the study, and SAEs were minimal, with 12 events occurring in 5 of 151 
(3.3%) subjects in the safety analysis set while on treatment. No treatment-emergent SAEs were 
considered related to study treatment or study procedure. 
Compared with subjects receiving placebo, a slightly greater percentage of subjects in the alogliptin 
group events of headache (10.5% vs 18.7%) and influenza (2.6% vs 9.3%). Treatment-related TEAS 
were reported in 13.9% of subjects overall and with less frequency among those in the alogliptin 
treatment group (10.7%) compared with those in the placebo treatment group (17.1%). Events of 
diarrhea were the only treatment related TEAEs that occurred in ≥3.0% of subjects. One procedure 
related TEAE occurred in a subject who stopped taking metformin.

TEAEs were generally mild or moderate in intensity, with 11 severe events reported for 8 of 151 
(5.3%) subjects (4 subjects in each treatment group). No severe events were considered related to 
study treatment. 
The incidence of adverse events of special interest (AESIs; hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, hepatic, and 
hypoglycemic events) was low overall and comparable between the alogliptin and placebo treatment 
groups. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Alogliptin (Vipidia) is currently authorised for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults aged 
18 years and older to improve glycaemic control in combination with other glucose lowering medicinal 
products including insulin, when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate 
glycaemic control. This study corresponds to the last measure of the agreed Paediatric Investigation 
Plan (EMEA-000496-PIP01-08-M08) for alogliptin (Vipidia), film-coated tablet, oral use. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 25 mg of alogliptin administered 
once daily compared to placebo either as monotherapy, or added onto a background of metformin 
alone, insulin alone, or in a combination of metformin and insulin, as measured by the glycosylated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline at week 26 in paediatric subjects aged 10 to 17 years with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 52-
week study. 
The study failed to show efficacy for treatment with 25 mg alogliptin QD in 151 pediatric subjects aged 
10 to 17 years with T2DM who were experiencing inadequate glycemic control (either without 
background antidiabetic therapy or with background therapy of metformin and/or insulin). With respect 
to the primary endpoint, the difference between alogliptin and placebo was only 0.1% (P=0.8) HbA1c 
at Week 26 (Full Analysis Set). 
In general, alogliptin safety was similar to that in adults, and no new safety concerns were observed in 
this population. Most Adverse Events were either mild or moderate and not related to study treatment 
or study procedure. No deaths occurred during the study and none of the 12 reported severe AEs were 
considered related to study treatment. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
The benefit risk assessment in paediatric patients is negative. These data are relevant for the SmPC. 
The MAH should submit a variation to update the SmPC within 2 months. 
  Fulfilled: 
Regulatory action is required. In view of the available data, the MAH should either submit a variation in 
accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a justification for not 
doing so. This should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days after the receipt of 
these conclusions.

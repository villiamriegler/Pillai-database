2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, estimated to be responsible for nearly 
one in five cancer deaths globally (1.59 million deaths, 19.4% of the total; Globocan 2012).  There were 
estimated  to  be  1.8  million  new  cases  in  2012  (12.9%  of  the  total),  58%  of  which  occurred  in  less 
developed regions.  This disease is the most common cancer in men worldwide (1.4 million, 15% of the 
total cancers in men) and accounts for the highest absolute number of cancer deaths globally (1.2 million 
deaths, 24% of cancer deaths in men).  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant subtype, 
accounting for approximately 85% of all cases.  NSCLC can be divided into two major histologic types:  
non-squamous and squamous cell carcinoma.  Non-squamous histology accounts for more than half of all 
NSCLC,  whereas  squamous  histology  accounts  for  approximately  30%  (Brambilla  et  al,  2014  and 
Schrump DS et al. NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th Edition. 2011).   
For patients who have metastatic NSCLC without an oncogenic driver mutation (such as EGFR mutations 
or ALK translocation), the standard of care is platinum-based chemotherapy, partnered with agents such 
as  taxanes  (paclitaxel,  docetaxel),  vinorelbine,  gemcitabine,  and  pemetrexed,  with  or  without 
bevacizumab. 
The most common oncogenic driver mutations in NSCLC are EGFR mutations, seen in 10-15% of Western 
patients  and  30-50%  of  East  Asian  patients.    To  date,  the  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKIs)  erlotinib, 
gefitinib, afatinib, and, more recently, osimertinib, represent the standard treatments for EGFR-mutated 
NSCLC and have dramatically improved the prognosis of NSCLC patients who harbour these mutations.  A 
smaller subset of NSCLC patients (2-6%) harbours the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation, 
which  is  also  an  oncogenic  driver  in  NSCLC.    The  first  generation  ALK  inhibitor  crizotinib  and,  more 
recently, alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor are now approved for the 1L treatment of ALK+ 
NSCLC. For both EGFR mutant tumours and tumours with ALK translocation, the standard of care after 
failure of TKIs is platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Over  the  past  4  years,  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors,  such  as  PD-1/PD-L1  blocking  antibodies,  have 
emerged as effective alternatives to chemotherapy for many tumor types. In 2L+ NSCLC, PD-1 inhibitors 
(nivolumab,  pembrolizumab)  and  PD-L1  inhibitors  (atezolizumab)  demonstrated  superiority  over 
docetaxel  as  monotherapy.    Subsequently,  it  was  also  shown  that  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  is 
effective in the first line setting for patients who express high levels of PD-L1.  Pembrolizumab is currently 
approved for 1L treatment of NSCLC patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 (≥ 50% tumor 
proportion score).   
Tecentriq (atezolizumab) is an Fc-engineered humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to 
programmed death−ligand 1 (PD-L1) and blocks interaction of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 
(B7-H1) ligands.    
In the European Union (EU), atezolizumab has been granted Marketing Authorization for the treatment of 
adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior platinum 
containing chemotherapy (provided that patients with EGFR activating mutations or ALK positive tumour 
mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving Tecentriq), and for the treatment 
of  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  UC  after  treatment  with  platinum  containing 
chemotherapy or who are considered cisplatin ineligible, and whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 
5%. 
The current submission supports the extension of the licensed indication to the use of atezolizumab in 
combination  with  bevacizumab,  carboplatin,  and  paclitaxel  for  the  treatment  of  chemotherapy-naïve 
patients with metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC.  The evidence comes from IMpower150 (GO29436), a 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 6/108 
 
 
 
Phase  III  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  atezolizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin  + 
paclitaxel with (Atezo + Bev + CP) or without (Atezo + CP) bevacizumab, versus carboplatin + paclitaxel 
+ bevacizumab (Bev + CP), in metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in the first-line (1L) setting.   
The following indication was adopted by the CHMP:  
“Tecentriq,  in  combination  with  bevacizumab,  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin,  is  indicated  for  the  first-line 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  metastatic  non-squamous  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).  In 
patients  with  EGFR  mutant  or  ALK-positive  NSCLC,  Tecentriq,  in  combination  with  bevacizumab, 
paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies” 
During the induction phase, the recommended dose of Tecentriq is 1,200 mg administered by intravenous 
infusion,  followed  by  bevacizumab,  paclitaxel,  and  then  carboplatin  every  three  weeks  for  four  or  six 
cycles. 
The  induction  phase  is  followed  by  a  maintenance  phase  without  chemotherapy  in  which  1,200  mg 
Tecentriq  followed  by  bevacizumab,  is  administered  by  intravenous  infusion  every  three  weeks  (see 
section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Atezolizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and does not pose a 
significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), atezolizumab is exempt 
from the submission of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), this is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK objectives for the IMpower150 study were the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To characterize the PK of atezolizumab when given in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
with and without bevacizumab (Arms A and B) 
To characterize the PK of carboplatin when given in combination with paclitaxel with and without 
atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab (Arms A, B, and C) 
To characterize the PK of paclitaxel when given in combination with carboplatin with and without 
atezolizumab and/ or bevacizumab (Arms A, B, and C) 
To characterize the PK of bevacizumab when given in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
with and without atezolizumab (Arms B and C) 
Analytical methods 
Plasma concentrations of paclitaxel were determined by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MSMS) method with Paclitaxel-d5 as an internal standard and ranged from 2-2500 
ng/mL. Covance, Madison US.  
Carboplatin plasma concentrations were determined by quantitation of platinum using a validated 
inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method with Iridium as an internal 
standard. The method ranged from 100-10,000 ng/mL Archinova, UK. 
A validated indirect sandwich ELISA was used to quantify atezolizumab in human serum.  
The method for the quantification of bevacizumab concentrations was an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay.  
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) testing 
All ADA samples were screened in validated bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). 
Atezolizumab ADA testing was conducted at ICON Laboratory Services, Inc. (ICON). Bevacizumab ADA 
testing was conducted at QPS, Netherlands B.V.  
Any sample that was deemed positive by the screening ADA assay was assessed for ADA specificity to the 
specific molecule (atezolizumab or bevacizumab) using a confirmatory competitive bridging ELISA. 
Samples that were confirmed positive were then serially diluted to obtain a titer value. 
Using a surrogate positive control antibody, the relative sensitivity of the atezolizumab ADA screening 
assay was determined to be 20.4 ng/mL in the absence of atezolizumab. The ADA screening assays were 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 8/108 
 
 
 
 
able to detect 500 ng/mL of the surrogate positive control in the presence of 200 µg/mL atezolizumab to 
enable the detection of ADAs in the presence of high trough levels of atezolizumab. 
Using a surrogate positive control antibody, the relative sensitivity of the bevacizumab ADA screening 
assay was determined to be 7.72 ng/mL in the absence of bevacizumab. The ADA screening assays were 
able to detect 500 ng/mL of the surrogate positive control in the presence of 100 µg/mL bevacizumab to 
enable the detection of ADAs in the presence of high trough levels of bevacizumab.Pharmacokinetic data  
The descriptive statistics of the available Cmax (30 minutes following the end of the infusion in Cycle 1 or 
Cycle 3) and Cmin (pre-dose) concentrations of atezolizumab in serum for the Atezo+CP arm and Atezo 
+Bev +CP arm following 1200 mg q3w IV administration are summarized in Table 1. Steady state based 
on trough concentration (Cmin) was reached by approximately Cycle 3. 
Table 1: Summary statistics for atezolizumab Cmax and Cmin following multiple IV doses of 
atezolizumab 1200 mg given every 3 weeks in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
with or without bevacizumab 
The mean serum atezolizumab concentrations over time by arm, are shown in Figure 1. The mean 
concentration time profiles of atezolizumab in the Atezo+ CP arm and Atezo +Bev +CP arm were similar.

doses of atezolizumab 1200 mg given every 3 weeks in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab 
ADA results from IMpower150  
The baseline prevalence of atezolizumab ADAs was 2.9% in the Atezo +Bev +CP arm and 4.6% in the 
Atezo +CP arm for atezolizumab-treated patients with a baseline ADA sample. The post-baseline 
treatment-emergent ADA incidences were comparable in both arms where patients received 
atezolizumab, with ADA-positive incidences of 36.4% in the Atezo +Bev +CP arm and 38.5% in the Atezo 
+CP arm. Average atezolizumab Cmin for both ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients appeared to 
approach a plateau (or steady-state) between 4–8 cycles of dosing. There was a consistent trend for 
lower exposure in ADA-positive patients, but Cmin for both groups was in excess of the target serum 
concentration of 6 µg/mL.  
Of 787 ADA evaluable patients in the safety evaluable population, one patient had a positive, treatment 
induced bevacizumab ADA and the baseline prevalence was <2%.

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Overview of population Pharmacokinetics 
The popPK of atezolizumab was first assessed based on Phase I data from two clinical studies PCD4989g 
and JO28944 (n = 472 patients, 4563 PK samples).  This “Phase I popPK Model” was subsequently 
subjected to an external evaluation with the use of atezolizumab PK data collected in Study IMpower150.  
The objectives of this analysis were to:  
•  Assess the PK of atezolizumab in chemotherapy naive patients with non-squamous NSCLC in 
Study IMpower150 through external evaluation of the Phase 1 popPK Model  
•  Derive exposure metrics of atezolizumab in chemotherapy naive non-squamous NSCLC patients 
in the IMpower150 study 
• 
Explore the potential impact of chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab coadministration on 
atezolizumab PK 
The IMpower150 population PK dataset included 4386 evaluable atezolizumab serum concentrations from 
778 patients with NSCLC receiving 1200 mg of atezolizumab q3w by IV infusion. In the Atezo+CP Arm, 
there were 395 patients receiving both atezolizumab and chemotherapy (carboplatin+paclitaxel) and 383 
patients in the Atezo+Bev+CP Arm who received Atezolizumab+chemotherapy+bevacizumab. 
Population  PK  analysis  was  performed  using  a  non-linear  mixed-effects  modelling  approach  with 
NONMEM, Version 7.3 (ICON Development Solutions, USA). Perl-Speaks-NONMEM (PsN) (Version 3.7.6 
Uppsala  University,  Uppsala,  Sweden)  was  used  to  evaluate/validate  the  population  PK  model  using 
predictive  checks.  Data  exploration  and  visualization  as  well  as  descriptive  statistics  were  performed 
using R+ V3.3.1 in addition to Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) packages. 
A  population  PK  model  of  atezolizumab  developed  previously  using  Phase  1  data  was  used  to  predict 
IMpower150 data and to derive the individual Bayesian post-hoc PK parameter estimates based on the 
observed time-concentration profiles in IMpower150 data. The atezolizumab Phase 1 popPK model was a 
two-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination including covariate effects. The model 
used was the final model including covariate effects.

The  number  of  evaluable  PK  concentrations  (with  concentrations  above  the  assay  LOQ),  excluded 
samples, samples below the limit of quantification (BLQ) as well as the total number of patients included 
in the analysis are presented in Table 4. Serum atezolizumab concentrations versus time were explored 
graphically for identification of outliers. Of the 778 patients included in the population PK dataset, the 
ratio of males to females was 468:310 (60.2% male). Median age was 63 years (range: 31-89 years) and 
body weight ranged from 37 to 196 kg. Approximately 81.5% of the patients were white.

Covariates 
Missing covariates values, when missing in less than 15% of the total number of patients, were imputed 
to median values by gender for continuous covariates or to the most frequent category for categorical 
covariates. No unexpected covariate effect was identified in the IMpower150 study. Exploratory analyses 
of  the  relationships  between  individual  CL,  V1  and  V2  patient-level  random  effects  and  covariates 
(continuous,  categorical,  and  including  body  weight,  albumin,  tumor  burden,  gender,  and  ATAG) 
indicated that covariate effects in IMpower150 data were generally consistent with those identified in the 
Phase 1 popPK Model. For any observed trends, no effect reached p < 0.001. 
Model diagnostics 
The ability of the Phase 1 popPK Model to describe atezolizumab PK in NSCLC patients was evaluated by 
external  prediction-corrected  visual  predictive  checks  (pcVPC)  based  on  atezolizumab  concentrations 
from  778  patients  out  of  802  ITT  patients  (97%).  The  pcVPC  was  performed  using  Cmax  and  Cmin 
atezolizumab  data  by  grouping  peak  or  trough  samples  for  the  entire  period  of  treatment.  Only  the 
IMpower150 PK visits with at least 40 samples were displayed on the plots. Using time-after-dose, peaks 
were defined for samples occurring between 0.01 and 1-day post-dose while troughs were defined for 
samples occurring between 10 and 30 days post-dose. PK samples from the visit 120 days after the last 
dose were not used for the evaluation. For each peak/trough grouping, 95% prediction intervals (PIs) of 
the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of simulated concentrations were computed across 1000 replicates and 
compared to the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of observed concentrations.

The pcVPC as external evaluation revealed an adequate performance of the model for the peak and the 
troughs  of  Cycle  1  to  3.  A  trend  to  under-prediction  of  the  exposure  was  observed  after  long-term 
treatment.  
The 90% PIs of the concentration-time profiles over 50 weeks and concentration versus time-after-dose 
(cycle  5  and  later)  profiles,  were  simulated  across  100  replicates  and  compared  to  observed 
concentrations.  The  atezolizumab  concentrations  from  the  visit,  “120  days  after  the  last  dose”  were 
included.

The  goodness-of  fit  plots  suggested  that  the  model  was  able  to  describe  the  PK  profiles  well  without 
re-estimating the Phase 1 popPK Model population parameters. No trends were observed in goodness-of 
fit  plots  at  the  individual  level  after  post-hoc  Bayesian  estimation,  indicating  that  the  Phase  1  popPK 
Model allowed reliable estimates of individual parameters in Phase 3 patients.

Estimation of atezolizumab exposure 
Individual CL, V1 and V2 patient-level random effects estimated with the Phase 1 popPK Model were used 
to predict atezolizumab concentration profiles and calculate exposure metrics both at Cycle 1 and Cycle 
10 (steady state). The predicted cycle 1 and steady-state PK profiles for each individual were based on 
the starting dose (dose on Day 1 given q3w, and the actual duration of infusion for cycle 1, then 30 min 
of infusion for all the subsequent doses and time points: 0, every 0.01 day for the first 3 days, every 0.5 
days until 20.99 days post-dose at cycle 1 and at steady-state.

2.3.4.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
The  covariate  effects  in  IMpower150  data  were  consistent  with  those  identified  in  the  Phase  I  popPK 
Model.  Atezolizumab  ADA-positive  patients  (about  one  third  of  all  patients)  experienced  lower 
atezolizumab exposure expressed as Cmin (about 20%) than ADA-negative but all in excess of the target 
serum concentration (6 µg/mL).  
Due to the low sample size in the ADA-positive population (n=101 in the Atezo+Bev+CP arm and n=96 
in the Atezo+CP arm), the Applicant provided the exposure-response (ER) OS analyses in two exposure 
groups divided by median first cycle Cmin (High: Cmin ≥ median; Low: Cmin <median). (data not shown) 
The Applicant presented, upon request, an overview of post baseline incidence of ADA across 8 clinical 
studies  (data  not  shown).  The  frequency  of  %  ADA  positive  seems  independent  of  indication  and 
treatment ranging from 30.4% to 54.5%. 
There is a trend towards lower efficacy in the Cmin <median subgroup (without Adjustment of Baseline 
Imbalanced Prognostic Factors). This is more pronounced in the ADA+ population of the Atezo+CP Arm; 
the HR (95% PI) for low  and high exposure (Cmin) groups were 1.0 (0.74, 1.3) and 0.8 (0.58, 1.1), 
respectively, in ADA-positive patients who received Atezo + CP after adjustment of prognostic factors 
(TGI-OS model simulations). 
In the data submitted during the procedure, the exposure of ADA+ patients in the low-exposure group 
(Atezo+CP arm; arm A) was slightly lower compared to that of the Atezo+Bev+CP arm (arm B). It is 
however agreed that there was a large overlap in exposure range between the two arms; the HR (95% PI) 
for low and high exposure (Cmin) groups were 0.66 (0.43, 0.93) and 0.71 (0.50, 1.0), respectively, in 
ADA-positive patients who received Atezo+Bev+CP after adjustment of prognostic factors (TGI-OS model 
simulations). 
Summary of best overall Response in ADA+Patients, Low Exposure Group (Cmin <Median) for Arm A 
(Atezo+CP) and Arm B (Atezo+Bev+CP) indicated a higher percentage of patients in IMpower150 Study 
in  Arm  B  showing  complete  response,  partial  response  and  lower  percentage  regarding  progressive 
disease. Individual plots of overall survival in ADA+ patients indicated comparable results regarding both 
arms. 
Samples collected for ADA evaluation in the IMpower150 study were not evaluated for neutralising ADA’s. 
Although it is considered acceptable that nADA data are not submitted within the present procedure, the 
Applicant should provide this data post-approval. Furthermore, the MAH is recommended to conduct an 
assessment of the effect of atezolizumab ADAs on PK and efficacy endpoints including OS, PFS, and ORR 
in NSCLC Studies POPLAR, OAK, IMpower150, IMpower130, IMpower131, and IMpower132. The MAH has 
presented an acceptable proposal/plan.

The  goodness-of-fit  plots  for  population  and  individual  predictions  appeared  adequate.  Individual 
weighted residuals (IWRES) were evenly distributed around 0, suggesting no bias in the predictions of 
high and low concentrations of atezolizumab. The pcVPC revealed the mean atezolizumab concentrations 
were under-predicted after long term use (after Cycle 3). This effect, not captured by the model, was 
suggested to be caused by a decrease in clearance and considered as being of no clinical relevance. The 
Phase 1 popPK Model is suitable to describe the individual PK data from the IMpower150 Study and seems 
suitable for determination of atezolizumab exposure metrics (Cycle 1 and steady-state) for comparison of 
the  exposure  between  two  treatment  arms,  with  and  without  bevacizumab,  in  patients  from  Study 
IMpower150.   
The  mean  atezolizumab  exposure,  expressed  as  AUC  (after  a  single  dose  and  at  steady-state)  and 
achieved after simulation using individual predicted Cl and V1/V2 parameters, were slightly higher in the 
arm with bevacizumab. The exposure difference between the arms was highest at steady-state but not 
considered clinically relevant.  
The exposure during Cycle 1 and after long-term therapy seems to be similar in both arms: in presence 
or absence of bevacizumab, indicating no impact of co-administration of bevacizumab on atezolizumab 
PK.  Both  cycle  1  and  steady-state  exposure  metrics  were  similar  to  those  estimated  in  other  NSCLC 
studies  using  atezolizumab  in  monotherapy,  which  suggested  that  the  atezolizumab  exposure  is  not 
impacted by the co-administration of the chemotherapy (carboplatin+paclitaxel). 
It is agreed that atezolizumab PK is not affected by the presence or absence of bevacizumab. 
In order to address the uncertainties in relation to ADA, the MAH is recommended: 
-To  submit  and  discuss  the  neutralising  ADA  data  for  both  atezolizumab  monotherapy  and  when 
co-administered with Carboplatin-paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab in IMpower150. 
- To submit an assessment of the effect of atezolizumab ADAs on PK and efficacy endpoints including OS, 
PFS,  and  ORR  in  NSCLC  Studies  POPLAR,  OAK,  IMpower150,  IMpower130,  IMpower131,  and 
IMpower132. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No additional dose-response study was performed, and data are limited to those submitted at the time of 
the initial Marketing Authorisation Application. The 1200 mg Q3W dose was used in the OAK study and 
therefore approved in 2L-NSCLC.  
2.4.2.  Main study 
IMpower150 (GO29436): A Phase III, open-label, randomized study of 
atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel 
with or without bevacizumab compared with carboplatin + paclitaxel + 
bevacizumab in chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage IV non-squamous 
non-small cell lung cancer 
Methods 
The study enrolled an “all-comer” patient population, meaning that patients were eligible for the study 
regardless of their PD-L1 expression level in tumour tissue, and included those with epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK)-positive tumours (EGFR 
mutant/ALK +). No prior treatment for metastatic non-squamous NSCLC was allowed except for EGFR

mutant/ALK+ patients who had experienced progressive disease (PD) (during or after treatment) or 
intolerance to treatment with one or more EGFR or ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), respectively. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment regimens: 
•  Arm A treatment: atezolizumab +carboplatin + paclitaxel (Atezo + CP) (induction: four or six 
21-day cycles); atezolizumab (maintenance: 21-day cycles) 
•  Arm B treatment: atezolizumab + bevacizumab + carboplatin+ paclitaxel (Atezo + Bev + CP) 
(induction: four or six 21-day cycles); atezolizumab + bevacizumab (maintenance: 21-day 
cycles) 
•  Arm C treatment: bevacizumab + carboplatin+ paclitaxel (Bev + CP) (induction: four or six 
21-day cycles); bevacizumab (maintenance: 21-day cycles) 
The ITT population is defined as all randomized patients, regardless of receipt of the assigned treatment. 
The  ITT−WT  population  is  defined  as  the  ITT  population  excluding  patients  with  an  activating  EGFR 
mutation or ALK translocation. As stated in the SAP, sensitizing EGFR mutations include all activating 
EGFR in exons 18 through 21. 
The Teff gene signature population is defined using expression of a T-effector gene signature in tumor 
tissue,  as  analyzed  using  a  centrally  performed  (Targos),  quantitative,  real-time,  polymerase  chain

reaction based clinical trial assay developed by Roche Molecular Systems. This signature is defined by the 
average  mRNA  expression  of  3  genesPD-L1  (CD274),  CXCL9,  and  IFN-γ,  normalized  to  a  reference 
gene.  It  is  a  surrogate  for  both  PD-L1  expression  and  a  pre-existing  immunity  within  the  tumour 
microenvironment  (Kowanetz  et  al,  2017).  The  Teff-high  population  is  defined  as  patients  in  the  ITT 
population with Teff signature expression ≥ − 1.91. On the converse, the Teff-low population is defined as 
ITT patients with Teff signature expression <−1.91. 
The Teff-high WT population is defined as the Teff-high population excluding patients with an activating 
EGFR mutation or ALK translocation. 
The  PD-L1  population  is  defined  as  one  of  the  following:  TC2/3  or  IC2/3  population,  defined  as  ITT 
patients  with  PD-L1  TC2/3  or  IC2/3  expression  in  baseline  tumor  tissue;  PD-L1  TC1/2/3  or  IC1/2/3 
population is defined as ITT patients with PD-L1 TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 expression in baseline tumor tissue. 
The PD-L1 WT populations are defined as the PD-L1 populations (TC2/3 or IC2/3 population or TC1/2/3 or 
IC1/2/3  population)  excluding  patients  with  an  activating  EGFR  mutation  (see  above)  or  ALK 
translocation. 
*PD-L1 populations: To asses PD-L1 status, sections from tumour specimens from eligible patients were 
prospectively stained and evaluated by an external central laboratory using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) 
IHC assay, according to scoring algorithm measuring PD-L1 on tumor cells (TC) and tumor-infiltrating 
immune cells (IC) (see the following Table). Patients were subsequently stratified at TC3 or IC2 cut-off at 
enrollment.  TC1/2/3  or  IC1/2/3,  as  well  as  TC2/3  or  IC2/3  scores  used  for  the  secondary  endpoint 
analyses were determined from re-reads to corresponding cut-offs prior to database lock for the primary 
PFS analysis, using the same previously PD-L1 stained tumor sections from the enrollment. TC3 or IC3 
scores were derived from raw percentage scores also prior to the database lock.

order: 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 24/108 
 
 
 
•  Arm A: Atezolizumab → paclitaxel → carboplatin 
•  Arm B: Atezolizumab → bevacizumab → paclitaxel → carboplatin 
•  Arm C: Bevacizumab → paclitaxel → carboplatin 
After  the  fourth  or  sixth-cycle  induction  phase,  patients  began  maintenance  therapy  (atezolizumab 
and/or bevacizumab). 
No dose reductions were permitted in the study for atezolizumab or bevacizumab. If AEs occurred that 
necessitated withholding atezolizumab or bevacizumab, the dose remained unchanged once treatment 
resumed. Dose reductions, interruptions, and discontinuation of carboplatin and paclitaxel were allowed. 
No crossover was permitted from the control arm (Arm C) to either of the experimental arms (Arm A and 
B).  Following  the  induction  phase,  patients  continued  treatment  with  maintenance  therapy.  Patients 
received study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (bevacizumab, carboplatin, 
and paclitaxel), or loss of clinical benefit (atezolizumab), or study termination by the Sponsor.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were PFS as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 in 
the Teff-high WT and the ITT-WT populations, and OS in the ITT-WT populations. Secondary endpoints 
are PFS and OS in other populations, PFS as assessed by IRF, ORR and DOR.  
If  the  difference  in  OS  between  Atezo+CP  (Arm  A)  and  Bev+CP  (Arm  C)  in  the  ITT-WT  population  is 
statistically  significant,  a  comparison  of  Atezo+Bev+CP  (Arm  B)  versus  Bev+CP  (Arm  C)  and  a 
comparison of Atezo+CP (Arm A) versus Bev+CP (Arm C) will be conducted in the Teff-high population 
and the ITT population, with a comparison of Atezo+Bev+CP (Arm B) versus Bev+CP (Arm C) prioritized. 
Tumor assessments occurred every 6 weeks (± 7 days) for 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and then 
every 9 weeks (± 7 days) after the completion of the Week 48 tumor assessment, regardless of treatment 
delays, until radiographic PD per RECIST v1.1 (or loss of clinical benefit for atezolizumab-treated patients 
who had continued treatment after radiographic PD according to RECIST v1.1), withdrawal of consent, 
death, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurred first.

Sample size 
The sample size of this study was based on the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with 
regard to both PFS and OS (co-primary endpoints) for the comparison of the Atezo+Bev+CP arm versus 
Bev+CP arm. 
The  estimate  of  the  number  of  events  required  to  demonstrate  efficacy  with  regard  to  PFS  in  the 
comparison of Atezo+Bev+CP arm versus Bev+CP arm was based on the following assumptions: 
• One-sided significance level of 0.003 for the comparison of the Atezo + Bev + CP arm versus Bev + CP 
arm in the Teff-high WT population 
• One-sided significance level of 0.003 for the comparison of the Atezo + Bev + CP arm versus Bev + CP 
arm in the ITT−WT population 
• 98% power to detect an HR of 0.55, corresponding to an improvement in median PFS from 6 months to 
10.9 months in the Teff-high WT population 
• 98% power to detect an HR of 0.65, corresponding to an improvement in median PFS from 6 months to 
9.2 months in the ITT−WT population 
• No interim analysis for PFS 
• Dropout rate of 5% per 12 months 
The  estimate  of  the  number  of  events  required  to  demonstrate  efficacy  with  regard  to  OS  in  the 
comparison of the Atezo+Bev+CP arm versus Bev +CP arm was based on the following assumptions: 
• One-sided significance level of 0.019 for the comparison of the Atezo + Bev + CP arm versus Bev + CP 
arm in the ITT−WT population 
• 87% power to detect an HR of 0.75, corresponding to an improvement in median OS from 12 months to 
16 months in the ITT-WT population 
• One interim OS analysis performed at the time of the final PFS analysis, at which time approximately 
73% of the total number of OS events required for the final analysis are expected to have occurred as 
determined through use of the Lan-DeMets approximation to the O’Brien-Fleming boundary 
• Dropout rate of 5% per 24 months 
The estimate of the number of events required to demonstrate efficacy with regard to PFS and OS in the 
comparison of the Atezo+CP arm versus Bev+CP arm was based on assumptions similar to those outlined 
above. 
With  these  assumptions,  approximately  1200  patients  in  total  were  enrolled  into  this  study,  with 
approximately  720  patients  in  each  comparison  in  the  ITT-WT  population.  The  ITT-WT  population 
included  approximately  1080  patients,  assuming  10%  prevalence  for  sensitizing  EGFR  mutations  or 
ALK-positive disease. The Teff-high WT population included approximately 540 patients, assuming 50% 
prevalence with the chosen Teff cutoff. 
Randomisation 
Randomization  to  one  of  the  three  treatment  arms  occurred  in  a  1:1:1  ratio.  Permuted  block 
randomization was applied to ensure a balanced assignment to each treatment arm. Randomization was 
stratified by the following criteria: 
•  Sex (male vs. female) 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 29/108 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Presence of liver metastases at baseline (yes vs. no) 
PD-L1 expression by IHC (TC3 and any IC vs. TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 vs. TC0/1/2 and IC0/1) 
Patients received their first dose of study drug on the day of randomization if possible. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. The Sponsor was blinded to treatment arm allocation and patient-level data 
on PD-L1 expression and Teff gene signature until the database had been locked for analysis. 
Statistical methods 
Treatment comparisons were conducted by first comparing Arm B versus Arm C and then comparing Arm 
A versus Arm C based on a stratified log-rank test in the biomarker-selected Teff-high-WT and ITT-WT 
populations for the PFS endpoint and in the ITT-WT population for the OS endpoint. ITT population is 
tested after ITT-WT population. For each comparison, analyses were conducted according to α-spending 
algorithm to control for the one-sided type I error rate (0.025) and to account for an interim OS analysis.  
Figure 9: α-spending algorithm for PFS and OS analysis hierarchy, alpha allocation and alpha 
recycling 
Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the median PFS and the median OS for each treatment 
arm, and a Kaplan-Meier curve was constructed to provide a visual description of the difference between 
treatment arms. The Brookmeyer-Crowley methodology was used to construct the 95% CI for the median 
PFS and the median OS for each treatment arm. 
Definition, censoring and methodology for primary and secondary endpoints has been previously detailed 
in the Summary of analysis methods for efficacy parameters (Outcomes/endpoints section).

Hypotheses 
The null and alternative hypotheses regarding PFS and OS in each population (Teff-high WT, ITT-WT) can 
be phrased in terms of the survival functions SA(t) or SB(t) for the atezolizumab-containing arms and 
SC(t) for the control arm: 
H0: SA(t) = SC(t) versus H1: SA(t) > SC(t) 
or H0: SB(t) = SC(t) versus H1: SB(t) > SC(t) 
The HRs, λA/λC and λB/λC (where λA, λB, and C represent the hazard of having a PFS or death in the 
Atezo+CP, Atezo+Bev+CP and Bev+CP arms, respectively), comparing the treatment effect between the 
two treatment arms, was estimated using a stratified Cox regression model with the same stratification 
variables used for the stratified log-rank test, and the 95% CI was provided. 
Discussion on modification of endpoints along study design: 
Initially, the co-primary endpoints for this study were investigator-assessed PFS in the ITT population and 
PD-L1 population (protocol version 1). However, efficacy data with atezolizumab and other check-point 
inhibitors in 2L+ NSCLC show that OS is in fact the most sensitive endpoint for cancer immunotherapy in 
the monotherapy setting. For example, in the randomized Phase III Study GO28915 (OAK) in previously 
treated patients with advanced NSCLC, an OS benefit with atezolizumab monotherapy compared with 
docetaxel was observed in the ITT population, with a stratified HR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.87). PFS in 
the ITT population was similar between both treatment arms: HR of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.10). These 
data, together with the fact that OS is the most objective measure of clinical benefit for patients with 
advanced/unresectable or metastatic lung cancer, led to the inclusion of OS as a co-primary endpoint, 
along with the PFS primary endpoints (protocol version 5). Since an OS analysis might be confounded by 
the  fact  that  many  of  patients  in  IMpower150  would  likely  receive  subsequent  immunotherapy  after 
progression,  crossover  from  the  control  arm  to  either  of  the  experimental  arms  after  PD  was  not 
permitted.  In  addition  to  changes  to  the  primary  efficacy  objectives  during  the  IMpower150  study 
conduct, the primary analysis populations were also modified to exclude patients with known activating 
EGFR mutations or ALK-positive tumors. These populations are defined as “wild-type” patients (ITT-WT 
and  Teff-high  WT  populations;  protocol  version  6).  This  change  was  based  on  the  observations  from 
monotherapy  studies  in  2L+  NSCLC  where  the  survival  benefit  of  immunotherapy  was  similar  to 
chemotherapy in the EGFRmutant/ALK+ patients, whereas OS was clinically and numerically improved in 
patients that did not have driver mutations such as EGFR mutation or ALK translocation. 
Furthermore, the primary biomarker analysis population was also changed from PD-L1 expression by IHC 
to expression of a Teff gene signature, defined as the Teff-high WT population. The Teff gene signature 
had  been  identified  based  on  analyses  in  the  POPLAR  (Phase  II  Study  GO28753)  and  OAK  studies  in 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. These analyses had shown that the Teff signature 
may have a stronger association with efficacy of atezolizumab monotherapy than PD-L1 expression on 
TCs and/or ICs as determined by IHC. More detail on the Teff gene signature is provided in Section 3.8.2. 
Efficacy in Teff-high and ITT populations (including EGFR mutant/ALK+ patients) were pre-specified as 
secondary objectives. 
Interim analyses 
No interim analyses were planned for the co-primary endpoint of PFS in this study.  
The final PFS analysis was conducted when both of the following criteria had been met: approximately 
516 PFS events had occurred in the Atezo+Bev+CP and Bev+CP arms combined in the ITT-WT population 
and the last patient had enrolled in the study. The final PFS analysis was expected to occur approximately 
29 months after the first patient was enrolled. At the time of the final PFS analysis, it was expected that 
approximately 249 events would have occurred in the Teff-high WT population. These numbers of events 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 31/108 
 
 
 
would allow for a minimum detectable difference corresponding to an HR of approximately 0.70 in the 
Teff-high WT population and 0.78 in the ITT-WT population. 
The OS interim analysis for the primary comparison of Arm B versus Arm C will be conducted by the 
Sponsor at the time of the final PFS analysis for the primary comparisons. It is expected that there will be 
approximately  370  OS  events  in  the  ITT-WT  population  in  the  combined  Arm  B  and  Arm  C  at  this 
timepoint, in which case an interim OS analysis will be conducted with the stopping boundaries for the OS 
interim  and  final  analyses  computed  using  the  Lan-DeMets  approximation  to  the  O’Brien-Fleming 
boundary. If there are significantly fewer than 370 OS events at the PFS final analysis, a nominal α of 
0.01% (negligible impact on overall type I error rate) could be spent on the OS analysis at the time of the 
PFS final analysis. The next interim will be conducted after approximately 370 OS events are observed, 
with the stopping boundaries for the OS interim and final analyses calculated the same way as above. 
The  final  OS  analysis  for  the  primary  comparison  of  Atezo+Bev+CP  arm  versus  Bev+CP  arm  will  be 
conducted when there are approximately 507 OS events in the ITT-WT population in the combined Atezo 
+Bev+CP and Bev+CP arms. This number of events corresponds to a minimum detectable difference in 
HR  of  approximately  0.83  in  the  ITT-WT  population.  The  OS  final  analysis  is  expected  to  occur 
approximately 40 months after the first patient was randomized. 
Subgroup analyses 
The consistency of PFS and OS results in subgroups will be examined in the populations where PFS and/or 
OS benefit had been demonstrated. The subgroups were defined by the following: 
•  Demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity) 
•  Baseline disease characteristics (e.g., ECOG performance status; presence of liver metastases at 
baseline;  smoking  status;  metastatic  sites  such  as  brain,  bone,  etc.;  EGFR  mutation  status; 
Kirsten rat sarcoma [KRAS] mutation status; EML4-ALK rearrangement status, intended number 
of cycles of induction treatment, etc.) 
• 
PD-L1 IHC status (e.g., TC3 or IC3, TC2/3 or IC2/3, TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3, and their corresponding 
complementary groups) 
•  Complementary  biomarker  population  defined  by  Teff  cutoff  value  -  1.91  and  additional 
biomarker populations defined by the Teff cutoff values of - 2.38 and - 2.93 
Summaries of PFS and OS, including the unstratified HR estimated from a Cox proportional hazards model 
and KM estimates of median PFS and OS, were produced separately for each level of the subgroup for the 
comparisons between two treatment arms and displayed in a forest plot. KM plots of PFS and/or OS were 
also produced for selected subgroups. Summaries of ORR by subgroup are also provided. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity  analyses  will  be  performed  to  evaluate  the  potential  impact  of  missing  scheduled  tumor 
assessments  on  the  primary  analysis  of  PFS,  as  determined  by  the  investigator  using  a  PFS  event 
imputation rule. The following two imputation rules will be considered: 
• If a patient missed two or more scheduled tumor assessments immediately prior to the date of the PFS 
event according to RECIST v1.1, the patient will be censored at the last tumor assessment prior to the 
first of these missed visits. 
• If a patient missed two or more tumor assessments scheduled immediately prior to the date of the PFS 
event according to RECIST v1.1, the patient will be counted as having progressed on the date of the first 
of these missing assessments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 32/108 
 
 
 
The imputation rule will be applied to patients in all treatment arms. Statistical methodologies analogous 
to those used in the primary analysis of PFS will be used for this sensitivity analysis. 
If > 5% of patients received non-protocol therapy before a PFS event in any treatment arm, a sensitivity 
analysis will be performed for the comparisons between two treatment arms (i.e., Arm A vs. Arm C, Arm 
B vs. Arm C and, if applicable, Arm A vs. Arm B) in which patients who receive non-protocol therapy 
before a PFS event will be censored at the last tumor assessment date before receipt of non-protocol 
therapy. 
If > 5% of patients are lost to follow-up for OS in either treatment arm, a sensitivity analysis will be 
performed for the comparisons between two treatment arms (i.e., Arm A vs. Arm C, Arm B vs. Arm C, 
and, if applicable, Arm A vs. Arm B) in which patients who are lost to follow-up will be considered as 
having died at the last date they were known to be alive.

Table 7: Patient disposition from Study GO29436 (ITT population) – Data cut: 15 September 2017 
Recruitment 
In the ITT population, a total of 2166 patients were screened; of these, 1202 patients from 240 centers 
in 26 countries were randomized.  
The first patient was randomized on 31 March 2015. The last patient was randomized on 30 December 
2016. Data Cut-off was on 15 September 2017. 
The number of patients randomized per country, followed by the number of centers (in parentheses), is 
summarized below: 
United States 266 (61), Spain 138 (20), Germany 94 (17), Japan 93 (15), Australia 88 (16), Ukraine 74 
(13), France 72 (12), Italy 50 (11), Chile 44 (3), Netherlands 39 (12), Russia 37 (5), Taiwan 34 (10), 
Brazil 27 (9), Portugal 23 (6), Latvia 17 (2), Belgium 16 (2), Switzerland 14 (3), Austria 12 (2), Argentina 
10 (7), Bulgaria 10 (2), Mexico 9 (3), Peru 9 (3), Singapore 9 (1), Slovakia 8 (3), Canada 6 (1), Lithuania 
3 (1).  
Failed screening: A total of 964 patients failed screening based on information collected on the IxRS. The 
most common reasons for screen failure were lack of known PD-L1 tumor status by IHC (137 patients), 
prior treatment for Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC (127 patients), and a history of treated asymptomatic 
CNS metastases that failed specific protocol eligibility criteria (94 patients).  
Allocation: A total of 1202 patients were randomized: 400 patients to the Bev+CP arm, 400 patients to 
the Atezo+Bev+CP arm and 402 patients to the Atezo+CP arm. Overall, 15 patients did not receive any 
study treatment (6 patients each in the Bev+CP and Atezo+Bev+CP arms and 3 patients in the Atezo+CP 
arm). 
Discontinuation from Study: In the ITT population, a higher proportion of patients discontinued from the 
study in the Bev+CP arm (53.0%) compared with the Atezo+Bev+CP (41.8%) and Atezo+CP (46.0%) 
arms. The most common reason for study discontinuation was death (42.5% of all patients). 
Follow up: The median duration of survival follow-up among ITT patients was consistent across the arms: 
15.4  months  in  the  Bev+CP  arm  (range  0.0-28.6),  15.1  months  in  the  Atezo+Bev+CP  arm  (range 
0.0-26.3), and 15.4 months in the Atezo+CP arm (range 0.0-25.1). As of the clinical cutoff date of 15 
September 2017, two untreated patients remained on study; 13 untreated patients had discontinued the

study due to withdrawal by subject (3 patients), death (3), other (3), protocol violation (2), and physician 
decision (2). 
Conduct of the study 
The first version of the protocol was issued on 21 November 2014 and was amended five times. The key 
changes to the protocol are summarized below. 
o  Protocol Amendment 1 (Version 2) – 29 March 2015 
Protocol  GO29436  was  amended  to  clarify  the  inclusion  criterion  on  contraception  and  extend  the 
requirement  for  its  use  to  6  months  after  last  dose  of  study  drug  for  all  patients  randomized  to  a 
bevacizumab-containing treatment arm. In addition, reporting for SAEs and AESIs was extended to 90 
days after last dose of study treatment or until initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurred 
first. 
o  Protocol Amendment 2 (Version 3) – 14 August 2015 
Major changes to Protocol GO29436, Version 3 are as follows: 
The evaluations of PFS at 6 months and at 1 year and OS at 3 years were added as exploratory objectives.  
The  contraception  requirements  in  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  and  the  pregnancy-reporting 
information were revised to comply with prescribing information for bevacizumab. 
The  study  inclusion  criteria  were  modified to  allow  for  patients  with  treated,  asymptomatic  cerebellar 
metastases to be enrolled provided that specific criteria were met. 
The exclusion criteria for history of autoimmune disease was broadened to allow for patients with eczema, 
psoriasis, or lichen simplex chronicus of vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with 
psoriatic arthritis were excluded) to be permitted, provided that they met the specific conditions. 
The  study  exclusion  criterion  regarding  treatment  with  systemic  immunostimulatory  agents  within  6 
weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever was shorter) prior to randomization was modified to 4 weeks 
prior to randomization. 
The exclusion criterion specifying that patients with a history of allergic reaction to intravenous contrast 
that required steroid pretreatment should have baseline and subsequent tumor assessments performed 
via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was removed. Patients with contraindications to contrast could 
have assessments done with non-contrast computed tomography or MRI. 
Bevacizumab was changed to an investigational medicinal product (IMP). Text was added to clarify that 
bevacizumab would be supplied to all sites by the Sponsor.  
The guideline to administer paclitaxel 60 minutes after the completion of bevacizumab was removed. 
Paclitaxel could be administered immediately following the completion of bevacizumab. 
Additional requirements were added for hepatitis B and hepatitis C testing to ensure that patients did not 
have active disease at screening. 
Additional detail was added to ensure that PRO assessments were collected as intended for patients who 
discontinued treatment for any reason other than PD or loss of clinical benefit (for atezolizumab-treated 
patients who continued treatment beyond RECIST v1.1 PD and who continued atezolizumab). 
Collection of mandatory tumour specimens, if clinically feasible, was now required for all patients. 
o  Protocol Amendment 3 (Version 4) – 11 November 2015 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 35/108 
 
 
 
Protocol GO29436, Version 4 was amended to clarify that a wash-out period of at least 4 weeks 
or five half-lives, whichever was longer, of any systemic immunomodulatory agent was required 
prior to enrollment. 
o  Protocol Amendment 4 (Version 5) – 31 May 2016 
Protocol GO29436, Version 5 was amended to add a co-primary endpoint of OS to the PFS primary 
endpoint  due  to  recent  data  suggesting  that  OS  may  be  a  more  sensitive  endpoint  for  cancer 
immunotherapy. Changes were made to the statistical testing procedure, accordingly. In addition, 
this amendment includes the following key changes: 
A secondary efficacy objective and outcome measure was added to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab 
as measured by investigator-assessed TTR according to RECIST v1.1 for the ITT population, the TC1/2/3 
or IC1/2/3 population, and the TC2/3 or IC2/3 population. 
The exploratory objectives and outcome measures to evaluate IRF assessment of PFS, overall response 
rate,  disease  control  rate,  duration  of  response,  and  TIR  according  to  modified  RECIST  for  the 
atezolizumab-containing treatment arms were removed. 
 The inclusion criteria were modified to specify that patients who had received prior radiotherapy with 
curative intent had to be treatment-free for at least a 6-month interval prior to randomization. 
Based on the half-life of atezolizumab of 27 days, the length of female patient contraception and follow-up 
of pregnancy reporting was revised from 90 days to 5 months. The contraception requirements for male 
patients  and  pregnancy-reporting  requirements  for  female  partners  of  male  patients  who  received 
atezolizumab were updated on the basis of the safety information for atezolizumab. 
General  medical  exclusion  criteria  were  revised  to  include  cerebrovascular  accident  as  a  significant 
cardiovascular  disease  and  to  exclude  patients  with  illnesses  or  conditions  that  interfered  with  their 
capacity to understand, follow, and/or comply with the study procedures. 
Two  exclusion  criteria  were  added  related  to  bevacizumab  in  response  to  fatal  adverse  events  of 
pulmonary hemorrhage that occurred in the study and to be consistent with other clinical studies that use 
bevacizumab:  clear  tumour  infiltration  into  the  thoracic  great  vessels  is  seen  on  imaging  and  clear 
cavitation of pulmonary lesions is seen on imaging. These additional exclusion criteria were endorsed by 
the iDMC. 
Permitted therapy was modified by removing hormonal therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
agonists or antagonists for prostate cancer because they are considered anti-cancer therapies. 
Traditional herbal medicines were removed from prohibited therapies, and language was added to state 
that concomitant use of herbal therapies was not recommended. Use of herbal therapies for patients in 
the  study  was  allowed  only  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator,  provided  that  there  were  no  known 
interactions with any study treatment. 
The  screening  assessments  were  revised,  specifying  that  either  a  computed  tomography  or  magnetic 
resonance imaging scan of the pelvis was required at screening. 
The timepoint for the whole blood sample collection at Cycle 1, Day 1 was moved to screening to enable 
the sample to be taken prior to any Cycle 1, Day 1 pretreatment with steroids. 
For patients who discontinued study treatment for any reason other than PD or loss of clinical benefit, the 
schedule  of  subsequent  electronic  PRO  (ePRO)  assessments  had  changed  to  align  with  the  tumor 
assessment schedule. 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 36/108 
 
 
 
For patients whose native language was not available on the ePRO device, an exemption from all ePRO 
assessments was provided. 
The length of time that atezolizumab could be withheld was clarified to be a maximum of 105 days beyond 
the last dose of atezolizumab; exceptions required Medical Monitor approval. 
The requirement for a tumor response assessment at the treatment discontinuation visit was removed. 
o  Protocol Amendment 5 (Version 6) – 01 March 2017 
Protocol  GO29436  was  amended  to  reflect  changes  in  the  analysis  populations  and  in  statistical 
methodology described in the SAP. Key changes to the protocol are summarized below: 
The  primary  analysis  populations  for  the  co-primary  endpoints  of  PFS  and  OS  had  changed.  PFS  was 
analyzed in the ITT−WT population and Teff-high WT population (Teff gene signature as determined by an 
RNA-based assay); OS was analyzed in the ITT−WT population. Both populations excluded patients with 
sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK−positive tumors. The analyses of PFS and OS in patients defined by 
their PD-L1 expression status on TCs and ICs as determined by IHC would be performed as secondary 
analyses.  The  analyses  of  PFS  and  OS  in  all  randomized  patients  would  be  conducted  as  secondary 
analyses. 
The testing hierarchy and α-spending algorithm were adjusted and the comparison between the Atezo 
+ Bev + CP and Bev + CP arms would be conducted prior to the comparison between the Atezo + CP and 
Bev + CP arms. 
On the basis of updated U.S. FDA guidance, the additional censoring rule for the primary endpoint of PFS 
for  U.S.  registration  purposes  was  removed  (FDA  2015).  The  impact  of  the  missing  visits  would  be 
assessed as a sensitivity analysis.  
The statistical testing procedures were amended to reflect the change in analysis populations. 
To  focus  the  efficacy  analyses  on  more  meaningful  endpoints,  the  secondary  objectives  and  outcome 
measures  regarding 
investigator-assessed  time-to  response  (TTR)  and 
investigator-assessed 
time-in-response  (TIR)  per  RECIST  v1.1,  had  been  changed  to  exploratory  objectives  and  outcome 
measures. The exploratory objectives and outcome measures of disease control rate, TTR, and TIR by IRF 
assessment per RECIST v1.1 and by investigator assessment per modified RECIST were removed. 
In  patients  of  Asian  race/ethnicity,  the  paclitaxel  starting  dose  was  lowered  from  200  mg/m2  to  175 
mg/m2. This change was recommended by the iDMC after a review of the safety data that noted a higher 
overall  level  of  hematologic  toxicities  in  patients  from  Asian  countries  compared  with  those  from 
non-Asian countries. 
Based on the half-life of atezolizumab of 27 days, the use of live, attenuated vaccines was extended to 5 
months after the last dose of atezolizumab. 
Language  was  added  to  clarify  that  tumour  tissue  collected  at  screening  would  be  evaluated  for  the 
expression of PD-L1 and the T-effector gene signature. Exploratory biomarkers would be identified by 
IHC, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, next-generation sequencing, and/or 
other methods. 
Statistical methods for exploratory PRO measures were added. 
Protocol deviations: 
Major  protocol  deviations  were  reported  in  relation  to  the  following  four  categories:  procedural, 
medication, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria. All patients with protocol deviations were included in 
the efficacy analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 37/108 
 
 
 
33.9% of ITT patients had at least one major protocol deviation; the majority of patients had procedural 
deviations (24.0%), 7.6% had medication deviations, 5.2% had inclusion criteria deviations, and 3.6% 
had exclusion criteria deviations. Overall, the frequency and types of deviations were similar between 
treatment arms.

The completion rates were high (>80%) for both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 across treatment arms throughout the 
course of treatment. At baseline, 91.4% (n = 360) in the Bev + CP arm, 90.6% (n = 357) in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm, 
and 92.7% (n = 370) of patients in the Atezo + CP arm completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 in the ITT population. Similar 
rates of baseline completion were also observed using the EORTC QLQ-LC13: 89.8% (n = 354) in the Bev + CP arm, 
88.8% (n = 350) in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm, and 92.5% (n = 369) in the Atezo + CP arm. 
Completion rates with both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires remained above 70% in all arms until Cycle 
20 in the Bev + CP arm, Cycle 25 in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm, and Cycle 24 in the Atezo + CP arm; most cycles in all 
arms had completion rates >= 80%. The latest cycle with approximately 25% of the original population remaining to 
complete the PRO assessments was Cycle 13 in the Bev + CP arm, Cycle 15 in the Atezo + CP arm, and Cycle 18 in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 52/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atezo + Bev + CP arm. Rates of completion in both the Teff-high-WT and ITT-WT populations were similar to those 
observed in the ITT population. 
Health related quality of life (HRQoL) and function 
Patients in all treatment arms reported moderately impaired HRQoL at baseline as assessed through the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 Global Heal Status (GHS) score with mean scores of 62.7, 62.3, and 61.5 for Atezo + CP arm, Atezo + Bev 
+ CP arm, and Bev + CP arm, respectively. Patients in all arms reported moderate to high scores for all aspects of 
function (i.e., physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social) at baseline; mean scores for physical function were 76.3, 
75.9, and 75.1 for the Atezo + CP arm, Atezo + Bev + CP arm, and Bev + CP arm, respectively. Baseline scores for all 
functional scales were comparable between treatment arms. 
Observation of change in scores over time suggests that GHS/HRQoL and Physical Function mean scores in each arm 
return to baseline scores following the completion of chemotherapy and numerically improve thereafter. Overall, the 
mean change from baseline never crossed the 10 point threshold indicating that overall, changes in GHS/HRQoL and 
PF are not clinically significant at any time point through Cycle 13, at which point there are fewer than 25% of patients 
in the baseline sample of the Bev + CP arm and comparisons between arms should be done with caution. 
Mean change from baseline scores for other function domains (i.e., cognitive, emotional, social, role), follow a similar 
pattern at most of the post-baseline timepoints evaluated; patients in all three treatment arms report comparable 
scores. Mean change from baseline in GHS and function scores in both the ITT-WT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) and 
Teff-high WT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) populations were similar to those observed in the ITT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and 
LC13) population. 
Treatment burden/tolerability 
Patients’ perspective regarding the severity of commonly experienced treatment-related symptoms (i.e., fatigue, 
nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, sore mouth, dysphagia, hemoptysis) was 
captured via the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires. Initially, average change from baseline scores in fatigue, 
constipation, diarrhea, and nausea/vomiting scores numerically worsened in all treatment arms then returned to their 
baseline level following the completion of chemotherapy. 
Patients in all arms, on average, did not report clinically meaningful worsening (>= 10 point increase from baseline) at 
any point on treatment for multiple treatment-related symptoms including fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, 
nausea/vomiting, hemoptysis, dysphagia, and sore mouth through Cycles 13, 15, and 18 for the Bev + CP, Atezo + CP, 
and Atezo + Bev + CP arms, respectively. A clinically meaningful worsening was observed across treatment arms for 
both patient-reported peripheral neuropathy and alopecia; large mean increases from baseline (>= 60 point increase 
for alopecia; >=30 point increase for peripheral neuropathy) were seen initially in all treatment arms and attenuated 
over time at similar time points across arms. Mean change from baseline scores were numerically lower (lower 
symptom severity) for patients in the Atezo + CP arm compared with patients in the Bev + CP arm for fatigue, sore 
mouth, constipation, and diarrhea at most time points post-baseline. Mean change from baseline results in both the 
ITT-WT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) and Teff-high-WT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) populations were similar to those 
observed in the ITT (EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13) population. 
Disease burden 
No differences were observed between treatment arms in the time to deterioration of each individual lung cancer 
symptom, i.e., cough (ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT), dyspnea single-item (ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT), dyspnea 
multi-item (ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT), chest pain (ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT), and pain in arm/shoulder 
(ITT, ITT-WT, and Teff-high WT). Median time to deterioration were not reached in any arm across symptom scores 
(with the exception of pain in arm/shoulder 18.7 months in the Bev + CP arm; dyspnea 21.9 months in the Atezo + CP 
arm) for analyses conducted in the ITT population. Mean change from baseline in all treatment arms, on average, 
reported numerical improvement in multiple lung cancer symptom scores (i.e., chest pain, pain in arm/shoulder, cough, 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 53/108 
 
 
 
and dyspnea single-item) for most timepoints on treatment. Results were comparable among arms at most timepoints 
on treatment (EORTC QLQC30 and LC13).

Impact from ADA status on efficacy (ADA Evaluable Atezolizumab Patients in Safety Evaluable Population) 
The results presented in tables 36-39 suggest that persistent ADA subsets may be confounded by 
survivorship bias therefore, use of the persistent and transient ADA definitions in the oncology population 
requires careful interpretation.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication is: Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung 
cancer  (NSCLC).  Patients  with  EGFR  mutant  or  ALK-positive  NSCLC  should  have  received  targeted 
therapy if clinically indicated prior to receiving Tecentriq. 
The  proposed  posed  posology  is  1200  mg  administered  by  IV  infusion  q3w.  Treatment  should  be 
continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until it is no longer tolerated by the patient. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has provided data from the first interim analysis (data cut-off 15 September 2017) and second 
interim analysis (data cut-off 22 January 2018) from G029426 (IMpower150) to support this application. 
1202 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Atezo + CP (arm A), Atezo + Bev + CP (arm B) 
or Bev + CP (arm C). Dosing and schedule for drugs in all three arms was based on previously approved 
indications and hence endorsed. Randomization was stratified by sex, presence of liver metastases at 
baseline, and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  
The control group (Arm C) is currently a standard of care for the first-line treatment of NSCLC based on 
the results of the ECOG 4599 study, which showed a significant improvement in OS (12.3 months vs. 10.3 
months  [Hazard  Ratio  (HR)  =  0.80;  p  <  0.003]),  PFS  (6.4  months  vs.  4.8  months  [HR  =  0.65;  p  < 
0.0001]), and ORR (35% [133 of 381 patients] vs. 15% [59 of 392 patients]; p < 0.001) in patients 
treated with bevacizumab q3w in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel compared with carboplatin - 
paclitaxel alone.No crossover was permitted from the control arm (Arm C) to either of the experimental 
arms. This is acceptable, since OS is one of the primary efficacy endpoints. Patients randomized to arms 
containing atezolizumab (A and B) were allowed to keep maintenance treatment beyond progression, but 
those randomized to the arm containing bevacizumab without atezolizumab (Arm C) were not.  
The study was originally designed to demonstrate an overall survival benefit of Atezo + Bev + CP in an 
all-comer  population  (ITT).  However,  emerging  data  from  2L+  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC) 
studies with monotherapy PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors demonstrated that patients with EGFR mutations did not 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 67/108 
 
 
 
 
derive significant clinical benefit from these drugs. In consequence,  the hierarchical testing scheme was 
adjusted in version 6 of the protocol, such that ITT population could not be formally tested if arm A did not 
show statistically significant OS benefit as compared to arm C. After such amendments, the co-primary 
efficacy  endpoints  were  investigator-assessed  PFS  per  RESIST  1.1  in  the  Teff-high  WT  population 
(Teff-high patients without an activating EGFR mutation or ALK translocation) and the ITT-WT population 
(defined as the ITT population excluding patients with an activating EGFR mutation or ALK translocation) 
and  overall  survival  in  the  ITT-WT  population.  The  method  to  control  the  type  1  error  for  the  two 
co-primary endpoints and for the comparisons of Arms A vs. C and B vs. C was considered adequate in 
general.  
Numerous  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  conditioned  the  randomisation  of  about  55%  (1202  out  of 
2166)  of  screened  patients.  From  the  non-participating  patients,  44%  were  excluded  due  to  issues 
regarding lack of PD-L1 status, prior treatment for stage IV NSCLC or CNS metastases that did not fulfill 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. The enrolled population seems in line with expectations for the 1L setting in 
metastatic NSCLC patients.  
ITT population was subdivided into multiple subpopulations according to diverse parameters (presence or 
absence of EGFR mutations/ALK translocations, Teff gene signature score, PD-L1 staining) as a way to 
optimally select the group of patients with most benefit. 
Being this a study of three arms, most of the comparisons (OS, PFS, ORR, DOR, etc.) were performed 
between  the  experimental  arms  (B  and  A)  against  the  control  arm  (C),  that  is,  B  vs.  C  and  A  vs.  C. 
However, to define the added benefit of bevacizumab to Atezo + CP, the MAH was also requested to 
perform  OS  and  PFS  comparisons  of  arm  B  vs.  A  for  the  ITT  population  (the  sought  indication  is  in 
all-comers). 
Baseline characteristics are well balanced among the three arms of treatment. As expected, since PD-L1 
status  was  a  stratification  factor,  distribution  of  its  subcategories  across  the  three  arms  in  the  ITT 
population is fair. It is remarkable that almost half (48.6%) of all randomized patients are PD-L1 negative 
(TC0 and IC0).  
In  the  second  interim  analysis  there  was  a  minor  variation  of  the  numbers  analysed,  as  2  patients 
originally categorised as EGFR positive and 3 patients originally ALK positive were recategorised as having 
no mutations.  
Overall, the main criticism to the design and conduct of this study is the modification of primary efficacy 
objectives and populations in subsequent protocol amendments, however the validity of the study is not 
questioned.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary efficacy endpoints:  
ITT-WT PFS: Final PFS analysis in ITT-WT population (co-primary endpoint) was done in the first interim 
analysis (data cut off 15-SEP-2017) when about 781 PFS events  had  happened in 1040 WT patients, 
about 75.1%. With data cut off of 22-JAN-2018, about 80.8% PFS events (855 in 1045 WT patients) have 
occurred and the median PFS remains identical for all three arms, including their 95% CIs: median PFS in 
ITT-WT population was 6.3 months in arm A, 8.3 months in arm B and 6.8 months in arm C. The updated 
data  cutoff  maintained  the  statistically  significant  PFS  advantage  for  the  comparison  of  arm  B  vs.  C: 
stratified HR (0.62 → 0.59) and p-value (<.0001 → <.0001).  
Considering the comparison of arms B and C, the study met its first co-primary efficacy endpoint, since 
the median duration of PFS was greater in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm (8.3 months, 95% CI: 7.7, 9.8) 
compared with the Bev + CP arm (6.8 months, 95% CI: 6.0, 7.1). This renders a stratified HR of 0.62 
(95% CI: 0.52, 0.74; p < 0.0001) and confers a statistically significant and clinically relevant advantage 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 68/108 
 
 
 
to the combination of Atezo + Bev + CP in WT patients. The comparison of arms A and C, delivers a HR 
of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.04; p: 0.14).  
Teff-high WT PFS: 447 out of 1202 patients (37.2%) were classified as Teff-high WT. When these patients 
are selected, PFS benefit from Atezo + Bev + CP (arm B) is increased: median PFS in arms A and C was 
similar  to  ITT-WT  population  (6.7  and  6.8  months,  respectively),  but  notably  higher  for  arm  B  (11.4 
months). In Teff-high WT population there are scarcely any differences in PFS between first and second 
interim  analyses.  Arm  B  maintains  a  statistically  significant  PFS  advantage  as  compared  to  arm  C, 
whereas arm A and C are not statistically different. However, to all appearances, the newly introduced 
Teff-biomarker did not distinguish satisfactorily between responders and non-responders. Comparison 
between Teff-high and low subgroups in the control arm (Bev+CP) suggests that Teff expression does not 
appear to be a predictive factor in this study. These data are supported by comparing Teff-high and low 
subgroups  in  2L  NSCLC  (OAK).  Overall,  PD-L1  appeared  to  identify  a  broader  patient population  with 
similar  treatment  effect  compared  with  Teff  gene  signature  (i.e.  PD-L1  IHC  appeared  to  be  a  more 
adequate predictive biomarker, since there is obviously a subgroup of patients with Teff gene signature 
low but positive PD-L1 expression who derived a benefit by PD-L1 directed treatment). 
ITT-WT OS: With an event rate of 53% in ITT-WT population, median OS was 19.4 months in arm A, 19.2 
months in arm B and 14.7 months in arm C. When considering the complete study period (the whole 
curve, not just the median), even if there is a borderline statistical difference in OS between arm B (Atezo 
+ Bev + CP) and C (Bev + CP), this difference is not clinically relevant. From a clinical point of view and 
based on the KM for OS plots and the estimates for median survival time, the difference between arms B 
(Atezo + Bev + CP) and A (Atezo + CP) is negligible. This is even more pronounced in the PD-L1 positive 
(TC3/IC3)  population,  where  actually  no  meaningful  differences  in  the  KM  plots  could  be  detected. 
Evolution of the OS comparison –per stratified HR- of arm B vs. arm C in ITT-WT population is static [0.78 
(0.62, 0.97) → 0.78 (0.64, 0.96)], whereas the comparison of A vs. C varies minimally [0.92 (0.74, 1.15) 
→  0.88  (0.72,  1.08)].  However,  comparisons  of  hazard  ratios  might  be  questionable  given  the 
non-proportional hazards and using survival rates at specific landmarks might prove more sensible: at 12 
months, 61% of patients were alive in arm C, as compared to 67% in arm B and 65% in arm A; at 24 
months, 34% of patients were alive in arm C, compared to 43% in arm B and 39% in arm A. However, as 
OS data are not mature at 24 months, no conclusion can be drawn at this stage. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
Results  of  PFS  in  ITT  population  were  similar  to  ITT-WT:  median  PFS  was  6.7  months  in  arm  A,  8.4 
months in arm B and 6.8 months in arm C. Median PFS in arm C (Bev + CP) is comparable to the result 
established by the pivotal trial NCT00021060 (6.2 months). The stratified HR for the comparison of arms 
B and C was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.69), indicating a clinically meaningful benefit with Atezo + Bev + CP 
as  compared  with  Bev  +  CP.  PFS  between  arms  A  and  C  is  similar,  although  not  yet  formally  tested 
(stratified HR of 0.91, 95% CI 0.78, 1.06). 
PFS benefit from treatment in arms B or A, as compared to arm C, was much higher for patients with 
increasing PD-L1 IHC positivity (TC2/3 or IC2/3). However, subgroup analysis suggests a small clinical 
advantage (PFS and OS) from Atezo + Bev + CP as compared to Bev + CP also in the PD-L1 negative 
subgroup (TC0/IC0), albeit with a late crossing of the OS curves after months 12. 
EGFR/ALK+  patients:  The  number  of  subjects  with  EGFR  mutations  and  ALK  translocations  in 
IMpower150 is limited; OS data are not fully mature yet and a statistical significance in the ITT population 
could not be provided due to the hierarchical multiple testing sequence. Nonetheless, the provided data 
support the assumption of a clinically meaningful benefit for the addition of atezolizumab + bevacizumab 
to carboplatin + paclitaxel in the EGFR/ALK+ subpopulation of the trial. Given the unmet medical need for 
this subpopulation of patients after failure of TKI therapies, its inclusion in the indication is supported by 
the preliminary OS and PFS data. There are no data on the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 69/108 
 
 
 
bevacizumab,  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  in  EGFR+  patients  who  have  progressed  previously  on 
erlotinib+bevacizumab and this has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Patients with liver metastases: in Arm B as compared to Arm C, pre-specified subgroup analyses from the 
interim OS analysis showed an OS improvement for patients with liver metastases: HR of 0.52.  
ORR:  In  ITT  population,  confirmation  of  response  by  the  Investigator  has  brought  upon  a  significant 
decrease  of the  previously  reported  response  rates  (7-8%  in  each  arm),  but  arm  B  (56.4%)  keeps a 
considerable advantage over arms C (40.2%) and A (40.6%). 
DoR: Regarding ITT population, arm B exhibited a significantly longer median response (11.5 months, 
95% CI 8.9, 15.7) than arm C (6.0 months, 95% CI 5.5, 6.9). Responders from arm A had a median DoR 
of 7.0 months, but the 95% CI (5.7, 8.3) overlaps with that from arm B, so the difference in DoR between 
arms B and A is not significant. 
Concordance between PD-L1 and Teff gene signature: PD-L1 IHC appeared to identify a broader patient 
population with similar treatment effect compared with Teff gene signature in the IMpower150 study.  
8.7% of patients (66 of 762) who were Teff-high were found to have PD-L1 status of TC0 and IC0 by 
SP142 PD-L1 IHC- 19% of patients (145 of 762) who were found to be Teff-low were considered TC1/2/3 
or IC1/2/3 by SP142 IHC. Analysis of these non-overlapping biomarker subgroups clearly revealed that 
the PD-L1 marker is better to distinguish between responders and non(worse)-responders. 
Benefit  from  adding  bevacizumab  to  Atezo  +  CP  (Arm  B  vs.  Arm  A):  Although  the  study  was  not 
statistically  powered  for  these  comparisons,  their  values  provide  insight  into  the  benefit  from  adding 
bevacizumab to Atezo + CP. PFS benefit from arm B (mPFS 8.4 months) is clear and regarding arm A 
(mPFS 6.7 months) significant: descriptive HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.57-0.79, p-value < 0.0001). Nonetheless, 
HR for OS in ITT population when comparing arms B (mOS 19.8 months) and A (mOS 19.5 months) is 
0.90 (95% CI 0.74-1.10, p-value 0.30). A similar result comes out when comparing such arms in ITT-WT 
population: 0.90 (CI and p-value not provided), slightly favoring arm B, even when mOS was higher in 
arm A (19.4 months) than arm B (19.2 months). On the same line, OS benefit from Atezo+Bev+CP vs. 
Atezo + CP in EGFR/ALK+ patients is doubtful as well: HR 0.66 (95% CI 0.34-1.28, p-value not provided). 
Atezolizumab ADA status: There was a high rate (30-40%) of ADA conversion (negative to positive) in 
both arms (A and B). In treatment-induced ADA-persistent patients (all subsets), lower median OS and 
median  PFS  were  observed  compared  with  ADA-negative  and  ADA-transient  patients.  Although  these 
differences  might  in  part  be  confounded  by  the  imbalances  in  baseline  characteristics,  the  reduced 
efficacy of ADA-positive patients in the Atezo + CP arm could be clinically meaningful.  This issue will be 
addressed post-approval. 
Efficacy by age subgroups: Dividing the ITT population in <65 and ≥65 years of age did now show PFS or 
OS  differences  between  these  subgroups  when  comparing  arms  B  and  C,  but  it  did  suggest  slightly 
diminished efficacy in older individuals when arms A and C where compared. The limitations regarding 
data in elderly patients have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
PROs: The results show that the 4-drug combination did not have any major effect on QoL. However, 
having in mind the worse safety profile of Atezo+beva+CP compared to atezo+CP and the open-label 
design, these data should be interpreted with caution. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy results of the second interim analysis from IMpower150 show that both co-primary endpoints 
have been met, thus confirming superiority from Atezo + Bev + CP over Bev + CP in terms of PFS in 
ITT-WT/Teff-high WT population and OS in ITT-WT population. ITT population cannot be formally tested 
because of the statistical amendments introduced in the last version of the protocol. Arm A (Atezo + CP) 
Assessment report

versus Arm C (Bev + CP) efficacy boundary was not crossed and Arm A (Atezo + CP) will be re-tested at 
the time of the final OS analysis,, but its overall OS benefit is similar to arm B (Atezo + Bev + CP). 
Subgroup analysis demonstrates PFS benefit from Atezo + Bev + CP vs. Bev + CP in EGFR/ALK+ patients 
and in patients with liver metastases, supported by a clinically meaningful OS benefit (formal statistical 
testing was not planned). 
Teff  gene  signature  did  not  prove  to  be  a  useful  biomarker  to  distinguish  from  responders  and 
non-responders in this trial: PD-L1 IHC appeared to identify a broader population with beneficial effect 
from Atezo + Bev + CP. 
In order to address the uncertainties in relation to ADA, the MAH is recommended: 
-To  submit  and  discuss  the  neutralising  ADA  data  for  both  atezolizumab  monotherapy  and  when 
co-administered with Carboplatin-paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab in IMpower150. 
- To submit an assessment of the effect of atezolizumab ADAs on PK and efficacy endpoints including OS, 
PFS,  and  ORR  in  NSCLC  Studies  POPLAR,  OAK,  IMpower150,  IMpower130,  IMpower131,  and 
IMpower132. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Study IMpower150: The safety population included all treated patients, defined as randomized patients 
who received any amount of any component of study treatment. For the safety analyses, patients were 
grouped according to whether any amount of atezolizumab was received, including when atezolizumab 
was  received  in  error.  Specifically  for  patients  randomized  to the  Bev  +  CP  arm,  if  atezolizumab  was 
received in error in addition to Bev + CP treatment, the patients were grouped with the Atezo + Bev + CP 
arm for the safety analyses. 
Accordingly, safety evaluable population consisted of 400 patients from arm A, 393 patients from arm B 
and 394 patients from arm C. 
Atezolizumab Monotherapy: In addition, safety data on single-agent atezolizumab from seven studies 
(OAK,  IMvigor211,  IMvigor 210,  POPLAR,  FIR,  BIRCH  and  PCD4989g)  are  presented  for  3075 
atezolizumab-treated safety-evaluable patients (all patients who received any amount of atezolizumab) 
of whom 1636 (53.2%) are patients with NSCLC.

The update of the monotherapy dataset has had minor impact in the known safety profile of atezolizumab. 
Noticeable changes seen at the SmPC include hyperthyroidism with all-grades incidence of 0.9% (from 
“common” to “uncommon”) and urinary tract infections (10.8%) now classified as “very common”.

withdrawal for each treatment phase does not add up to the overall number. 
Comparison between IMpower150 Atezo + Bev + CP Arm and Monotherapy 
Almost all patients in the Atezo + Bev+ CP arm and atezolizumab monotherapy population experienced 
at least one AE of any grade (98.0% Atezo + Bev + CP vs. 95.9% monotherapy population).  The most 
common SOCs (≥ 30% of patients in either Atezo + Bev + CP arm or monotherapy population) in which 
AEs were reported were:  
•  General disorders and administration site conditions (72.5% vs. 68.7%) 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders (72.0% vs. 60.4%) 
•  Nervous system disorders (70.7% vs. 32.9%)

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 73: Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events by treatment phase (safety evaluable 
population) (data cut: 22 January 2018) 
Comparison of key safety results between first and second interim analysis 
A comparison of the key safety results from the first and second interim analyses is provided in the table 
below. No new safety signals are identified and the safety profile is consistent between the two cutoffs. 
The key findings were as follows: 
•  Median exposure to study drug remained consistent with the previous clinical cutoff date (CCOD). 
•  The proportion of patients with at least one adverse event (AE; any grade) remained consistent with 
the primary clinical study report (CSR) and was similar between treatment arms (Bev + CP: 99.0% 
Atezo + Bev + CP: 98.2%; Atezo + CP: 97.8%). Overall, the AEs with an incidence rate of at least 10% 
observed  with  atezolizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  with  or  without  bevacizumab  were 
those events known to occur with an incidence of at least 10% for each individual study treatment. 
•  Since the previous CCOD, a larger increase in the number of AEs was observed in Atezo + Bev + CP 
(additional 334 events) and Atezo + CP (additional 229 events) compared with Bev + CP (additional 90 
events). 
•  Grade  3-4  AEs  were  comparable  between  treatment  arms  (Bev  +  CP:  58.4%  Atezo  +  Bev  +  CP: 
63.6%; Atezo + CP: 57.5%). Grade 3-4 AEs related to any study treatment remained higher in the 
Atezo  +  Bev  +  CP  arm  (56.7%)  compared  with  the  Bev  +  CP  arm  (48.5%)  and  Atezo  +  CP  arm 
(43.0%). 
•  The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  serious  AEs  (SAEs)  remained  higher  in  Atezo  +  Bev  +  CP 
(44.3%) compared with Bev + CP (34.3%) and Atezo + CP (39.3%). 
•  Since  the  previous  CCOD,  two  new  Grade  5  events  were  reported  in  the  Atezo  +  Bev  +  CP  arm, 
including 1 event of intestinal ischemia and 1 event of  unexplained death. One additional Grade 5 
event (“death” considered unrelated to atezolizumab), reported in a patient in the Atezo + CP arm at 
the  previous  CCOD,  was  reclassified  subsequent  follow-up  review  to  interstitial  lung  disease  (ILD; 
considered related to atezolizumab treatment). 
•  The proportion of patients experiencing AEs considered by the investigator as related to any study 
treatment  remained  comparable  between  treatment  arms  (Bev  +  CP:  95.7%,  Atezo  +  Bev  +  CP: 
94.1%; Atezo + CP: 94.3%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 91/108 
 
 
 
 
•  The  incidence  of  AEs  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  for  atezolizumab  was  consistent  with  the  primary 
analysis as well as the known safety profile of atezolizumab, with the exception of immune-mediated 
pancreatitis and meningoencephalitis. Pancreatitis has since been added to the table of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) since this medical concept reached the threshold of what is deemed to be clinically 
different  from  monotherapy,  and  meningoencephalitis  (including  non-infective  encephalitis)  was 
removed from the table of ADRs as this medical concept no longer meets the threshold of what is 
deemed to be clinically different from monotherapy. 
•  The majority of atezolizumab AESIs were mild or moderate in severity. 
•  The incidence of AESIs for bevacizumab remained consistent with that reported at the earlier CCOD as 
well as the known safety profile of bevacizumab. 
Table 74: Comparison of safety data from study IMpower150 (safety evaluable population) 
Post marketing experience 
No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  in  the  post-marketing  setting  for  atezolizumab  used  as  a 
monotherapy  (see  Periodic  Benefit  Risk  Evaluation  Report  [PBRER]  data 
lock  point  of 
17 November 2017).  As of 17 November 2017, 15,888 patients had been exposed to atezolizumab in the 
post-marketing setting.  The combination regimens administrated in Study IMpower150 are not approved 
yet. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety evaluable population in study IMpower150 consisted of 400 patients from arm A, 393 patients 
from arm B and 394 patients from arm C. 
Exposure pattern of atezolizumab (number of doses received, treatment duration, dose intensity, total 
cumulative dose) is slightly higher in arm B than A. The same can be said about bevacizumab, with higher 
exposure in arm B than C. Arms B and A were allowed to keep treatment beyond progression whereas 
arm C was not. 122 patients from the Atezo + CP arm and 97 patients from the Atezo + Bev + CP arm 
received a mean of 3 doses of atezolizumab after progression. From these patients, a higher proportion 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 92/108 
 
 
 
 
 
of patients from arm B had bulky progression than those from arm A. On the same line, patients who 
continued atezolizumab after progression in arm A lived longer (mOS 13.5 months) than those from arm 
B (mOS 11.1 months).  
As expected, the majority of patients (95%) experienced one or more AEs through the study. Overall, the 
frequency of any AEs, G3-4, G5, serious AEs and AEs leading to dose modification/interruption was higher 
in the induction phase than in the maintenance phase for all 3 arms of treatment. The trend of higher 
toxicity from the 4-drug regimen (as compared to both 3-drug regimens) is evident in both phases. The 
frequency of G3-4 AEs in the induction phase in all 3 arms is around 50%. However, in the maintenance 
phase, about 23% of patients from one-drug arms (arm A = atezolizumab, arm C = bevacizumab) had 
G3-4  AEs,  as  compared  to  37%  from  the  2-drug  arm  (arm  B  =  atezolizumab  +  bevacizumab). 
Immune-related  endocrinopathies  in  atezolizumab-containing  arms  were  more  frequent  in  the 
maintenance than in the induction phase.  
In general, arm B had higher incidence of AEs than the other two arms. AEs with higher incidence in arm 
B  than  arms  A  and  C  were  nausea,  diarrhea,  stomatitis,  gastroesophageal  reflux,  dysphagia,  fatigue, 
pyrexia,  mucosal  inflammation,  headache,  musculoskeletal  pain,  epistaxis,  haemoptysis,  dysphonia, 
febrile  neutropenia,  pneumonia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  bronchitis,  diverticulitis,  decreased 
appetite,  hypomagnesaemia,  hypokalaemia,  dehydration,  hyponatraemia,  hyperglycaemia,  platelet 
count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, weight decreased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, 
alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  WBC  count  decreased,  hypertension,  hypertensive  crisis, 
proteinuria, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. 
Epistaxis,  hypertension  and  proteinuria  were  equally  common  in  bevacizumab-containing  arms  and 
almost  absent  in  arm  A.  When  AEs  were  selected if  considered  treatment-related,  they  also occurred 
more frequently in arm B than in the other arms. 
Grade 3-4 AEs were overall frequent in all three arms of treatment, being registered in 59% (698 out of 
1187) of patients from the safety population. G3/4 AEs occurred with 5% higher frequency in the Atezo 
+ Bev + CP arm (61.6%), as compared to the Atezo + CP arm (56.5%).  
AESIs: AESIs (any grade and G3/4) were more common in arm B than in arms A and C. Discontinuation 
due to an AESI followed the same pattern. Immune-related hepatitis and colitis were more common in 
arm B than the other arms. Hypothyroidism and rash –more easily manageable than the previous– were 
more  frequent  in  arms  A  and  B.  All  other  immune-mediated  AE  had  an  incidence  comparable  to 
atezolizumab  monotherapy  and  were  clinically  manageable.  Less  frequent  immune-related  AESIs 
(meningoencephalitis, pancreatitis, hypophyisitis) were rare. As compared to atezolizumab monotherapy 
(34%), AESIs of any grade were also much more frequent in atezolizumab-containing arms (51% in arm 
B and 46% in arm A). This difference is mostly driven by AESIs that are clinically manageable such as 
hepatitis  (lab  abnormal),  hypothyroidism  and  rash.  AESIs  that  required  corticosteroid  treatment  in 
IMpower150 occurred in about 20% of each of the atezolizumab-containing arms, and they had similar 
efficacy outcomes to the overall ITT population.  
Atezolizumab AESIs: Any-grade immune-related pneumonitis occurred in 29 patients: 3 (0.8%) patients 
in arm C, 10 (2.5%) in arm B and 16 (4.0%) in arm A –in this last group with median duration of 4.2 
months.  Overall,  nearly  2%  of  patients  that  received  atezolizumab  required  hospitalisation  for 
autoimmune pneumonitis, but there were no G5 AEs from pneumonitis. Frequency of immune-related 
hepatitis  was  much  higher  in  arm  B  (5.1%)  than  arm  A  (3.0%),  as  were  hypothyroidism  and 
hyperthyroidism. 
Bevacizumab AESIs: Incidence of haemorrhagic events is significantly higher in bevacizumab containing 
arms: 32.3% and 31.2% in arms B and C, respectively, as compared to 14.5% in arm A. Incidence of 
haemoptysis in arm B (27 out of 393 patients, 6.9%) doubles that of arm A (14 out of 400 patients, 
Assessment report  
EMA/180402/2019  
Page 93/108 
 
 
 
3.5%). Out of 61 patients who presented haemoptysis, 13 required hospitalisation for such AE and 5 of 
them died as a direct consequence. Of the 13 hospitalised patients, 12 (92%) had received bevacizumab 
either in arm B or C. All 5 patients who died from haemoptysis had received the 4-drug regimen (Atezo + 
Bev + CP) in arm B. 4 patients exposed to bevacizumab (2 in arm B and 2 in arm C) died from fatal 
pulmonary haemorrhage, which prompted modification of criteria to exclude patients with clear tumour 
infiltration into the thoracic great vessels or cavitation of pulmonary lesions. 
Incidence of  hypertension was significantly  higher in arms  B and C (24.6%) than arm A (3.5%), and 
comparable to its incidence in all previous bevacizumab studies. No relevant differences on incidence of 
hypertension are seen between arms B and C.  
Cerebrovascular  accident  occurred  in  6  patients  from  arm  B  (1.5%),  two  of  which  died.  Incidence  of 
pulmonary thromboembolism in bevacizumab-containing arms was higher than arm A (3.8% vs. 2.5%), 
and more likely associated to fatality: all 4 patients that died from pulmonary thromboembolism were in 
bevacizumab-containing arms (2 patients in arm B and 2 in arm C). The increased risk of cerebrovascular 
accidents is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmCP. 
Overall,  complications  associated  to  bevacizumab,  in  particular  in  the  4-drug  regimen,  cannot  be 
underestimated:  G5  events  from  pulmonary  thromboembolism,  myocardial  infarctions,  haemoptysis, 
cerebrovascular accidents and pulmonary haemorrhage accounted for 9 patients in arm B and 7 patients 
in arm C. In comparison, only 1 patient died from any of these AEs in the Atezo + CP arm. 
Serious AEs were more common in arm B (44.3%) as compared to either arm C (34.3%) or A (39.3%). 
Excluding pneumonia (6.1% in arm B vs. 3.1% in atezolizumab monotherapy), incidence of serious AEs 
was in general comparable to atezolizumab monotherapy population. Febrile neutropenia attributable to 
treatment was also more frequent in arm B (6.9%) regarding arms A (3.3%) or C (4.3%). 
Deaths: The most common cause of death in all treatment arms was progressive disease: 531 out of 620 
deaths (86%). Incidence of G5 AEs was relevantly lower in arm A (10 patients, 2.5%) as compared to 
arms B (24 patients, 6.1%) and C (21 patients, 5.3%), and even compared to atezolizumab monotherapy 
population (3.9%). 
A large proportion of G5  AEs appeared to be possibly related to bevacizumab treatment and this has 
already been highlighted in bevacizumab-related AEs. Overall, most common G5 AEs were haemoptysis, 
pneumonia,  pulmonary  embolism  and  febrile  neutropenia.  While  deaths  from  thoracic  disorders  were 
more common in arm B (9 events), deaths from infections were more common in arm C (6 events). 
Special populations: A worse safety profile was generally observed in patients aged ≥65 years, compared 
with patients <65 years in the bevacizumab-containing arms. The worse safety profile in elderly patients 
has  been  reflected  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  The  most  pronounced  differences  in  safety  between 
patients with ECOG PS 0 or 1 were noticed in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm. A tendency towards a worse 
safety profile for female vs. male patients can be observed across all treatment arms.  
Due to increased hematologic toxicities observed in Asian patients in IMpower150, it is recommended 
that the starting dose of paclitaxel should be 175 mg/m2 every three weeks (see section 4.2 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC). 
Discontinuation:  Most  of  the  withdrawals  of  any  study  treatment  were  attributable  to  withdrawals  of 
bevacizumab  in  both  the  induction  and  the  maintenance  phase.  In  the  bevacizumab-containing  arms 
numerically higher rates of discontinuation of only chemotherapy and all study treatments were observed 
in the induction phase compared to the Atezo+CP arm (5.3%, 5.6% and 3.3% withdrawals of all study 
treatments for Bev+CP, Atezo+Bev+CP and Atezo+CP, respectively). These data underline the relevant 
contribution  of  bevacizumab  to  the  toxicity  profile  and  the  (worse)  tolerability  of  the  combination 
therapies.

EMA/180402/2019  
Page 94/108 
 
 
 
Updated safety results: The Atezo + Bev + CP arm has manifested a worse toxicity profile with longer 
follow-up. Since the previous data cutoff, a larger increase in the number of AEs was observed in the 
Atezo + Bev + CP (additional 334 events) and Atezo + CP arms (additional 229 events) compared with 
the Bev + CP arm (additional 90 events). The same trend (with largest numerical increases in AEs in the 
Atezo + Bev + CP since the first analyses) was observed for grade 3-4 AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to 
withdrawal from any treatment and AE leading to any dose modification/interruption. 
Since  atezolizumab  is  cleared  from  the  circulation  through  catabolism,  no  metabolic  drug-drug 
interactions are expected.  Based on PK data from IMpower150, there is no evidence of a PK drug-drug 
interaction  with  the  coadministration  of  atezolizumab  and/or  bevacizumab  with  carboplatin  and 
paclitaxel. 
The  use  of  systemic  corticosteroids  or  immunosuppressants  before  starting  atezolizumab  should  be 
avoided  because  of  their  potential  interference  with  the  pharmacodynamic  activity  and  efficacy  of 
atezolizumab.    However,  systemic  corticosteroids  or  other  immunosuppressants  can  be  used  to  treat 
immune-related adverse reactions after starting atezolizumab. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The combination of Atezo + Bev + CP was found to be tolerable but showed a clearly worse safety profile 
than the other two arms in IMpower150. This 4-drug regimen exhibited higher toxicity compared to the 
other treatment arms as observed with the higher incidence of any, G3/4, serious and G5 AEs. However, 
arms  A  and  B  had  comparable  incidence  and  outcome  for  immune-related  AEs  as  for  atezolizumab 
monotherapy,  whereas  bevacizumab-related  AEs  had  significantly  high  incidence  and  fatality,  in 
particular in the Atezo + Bev + CP arm. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 6.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, changes related to section 
4.8 of the SmPC have been implemented in order to update the monotherapy safety data and reflect the 
largest pooled monotherapy population available (now including also data from study IMvigor211 and 
from all cohorts for study PCD4989g). In addition, small corrections and formatting changes have been 
implemented throughout the SmPC. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  No  significant  changes  impacting  the  readability  of  the  package  leaflet  are  made.  The  new 
additions follow the same structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the 
approved package leaflet. 
•  The target group of users will be similar between the approved indication (locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy) and the applied indication (first-line 
treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC), with no significant age difference. 
•  Moreover,  the  posology  proposed  in  this  application  is  the  same  as  the  currently  approved 
indication. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication as considered by the CHMP is for Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel 
and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous 
non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC, Tecentriq, in 
combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate 
targeted therapies (see section 5.1). 
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.  This disease is the most common 
cancer  in  men  worldwide  and  accounts  for  the  highest  absolute  number  of  cancer  deaths  globally.  
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant subtype, accounting for approximately 85% of all.  
NSCLC can be divided into two major histologic types:  non-squamous and squamous cell carcinoma.  
Non-squamous histology accounts for more than half of all NSCLC, whereas squamous histology accounts 
for approximately 30%.   
Genetic  changes  that  have  prognostic  and  predictive  significance  in  NSCLC  include  EGFR  mutations 
(10-40%) and ALK traslocations (2-6%). 
The aim of therapy in the metastatic setting of NSCLC is to prolong progression free survival and overall 
survival, with no addition of major treatment-related toxicity.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For patients who have metastatic NSCLC without an oncogenic driver mutation (such as EGFR mutations 
or ALK translocations), first-line standard of care is platinum-based chemotherapy, partnered with agents 
such as taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and pemetrexed, or platinum-based 
chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab. For both EGFR mutant patients and patients with ALK translocation, the 
standard of care after failure of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is platinum based chemotherapy. 
Over the last few years, immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, have 
emerged  as  effective  2L+  treatment  in  NSCLC:  nivolumab,  pembrolizumab  and  atezolizumab  have 
demonstrated superiority over docetaxel as monotherapy. 
Since  these  patients  usually  undergo  rapid  clinical  deterioration  during  disease  progression,  many  of 
them do not receive second line treatment.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
IMpower150  (GO29436)  is  a  phase  III  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  atezolizumab  in 
combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab, versus carboplatin + paclitaxel + 
bevacizumab,  in  metastatic  non-squamous  NSCLC  in  the  first-line  setting.    The  current  submission 
supports the use of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel for the 
treatment  of  chemotherapy-naïve  patients  with  metastatic,  non-squamous  NSCLC,  including  patients 
with  EGFR  mutations  or  ALK  translocations  who  have  failed targeted  therapy.    This  variation  is  being 
submitted at this time because the protocol-specified first interim analysis has been conducted, with a 
clinical cut-off date of 15 September 2017. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The updated data was submitted from the second interim analysis of IMpower150 with data cut-off of 22 
January 2018. Both co-primary efficacy endpoints of the study have been met.  
In ITT-WT population, median PFS was 6.7 months in arm A, 8.4 months in arm B and 6.8 months in arm 
C.  Stratified HR of 0.59 (p < 0.0001) confers a statistically significant advantage to Atezo + Bev + CP as 
compared  to  Bev  +  CP.  There  was  no  significant  difference  between  the  numbers,  percentages  and 
comparisons  on  PFS  in  Teff-high  WT  population  compared  to  the  first  interim  analysis,  but  PD-L1 
expression appears to identify a broader population with similar treatment effects as compared to the Teff 
gene signature. 
Median OS in ITT-WT population was 19.4 months in arm A, 19.2 months in arm B and 14.7 months in 
arm C. A statistically significant benefit from arm B over arm C is demonstrated from a stratified HR of 
0.78 (p = 0.0164).  
Subgroup  analysis  showed  that  patients  with  liver  metastases  at  enrolment  obtained  the  highest  OS 
benefit in ITT population (arm B vs. C): HR of 0.52.  
EGFR/ALK+ patients also had clinical benefit from treatment following progression from TKIs: median PFS 
was 10 months in arm B, 6.9 months in arm A and 6.1 months in arm C, whereas median OS was 21.2 
months in arm A, not reached in arm B and 17.5 months in arm C.  
Most  secondary  endpoints  were  consistent  with  the  clinical  benefit  from  arm  B  shown  across 
subpopulations. ORR in ITT population, although certainly decreased after confirmation of response, was 
56% in arm B, 41% in arm A and 40% in arm C. In the same population, median duration of response was 
11.5 months in arm B, 7.0 months in arm A and 6.0 months in arm C.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Taking  into  account  a  significant  atezolizumab  ADA  conversion  rate,  it  remains  unknown  whether  the 
emergence of these antibodies has a clear impact on efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with CP +/- 
bevacizumab.  The  MAH  is  recommended  to  conduct  an  assessment  (post-approval)  of  the  effect  of 
atezolizumab ADAs on PK and efficacy endpoints including OS, PFS, and ORR in NSCLC Studies POPLAR, 
OAK, IMpower150, IMpower130, IMpower131, and IMpower132.  
Due  to  the  limited  sample  size,  the  magnitude  of  the  benefit  of  atezolizumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab in patients aged ≥ 75 years is difficult to characterise (see section 5.1 of 
the SmPC) 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In IMpower150, an overall higher frequency of adverse events was observed in the four-drug regimen of 
atezolizumab,  bevacizumab,  paclitaxel,  and  carboplatin  compared  to  atezolizumab,  paclitaxel  and 
carboplatin,  including  Grade  3  and  4  events  (63.6%  compared  to  57.5%),  Grade  5  events  (6.1% 
compared to 2.5%), adverse events of special interest to atezolizumab (52.4% compared to 48.0%), as 
well  as  adverse  events  leading  to  withdrawal  of  any  study  treatment  (33.8%  compared  to  13.3%). 
Nausea,  diarrhoea,  stomatitis,  fatigue,  pyrexia,  mucosal  inflammation,  decreased  appetite,  weight 
decreased,  hypertension  and  proteinuria  were  reported  higher  (≥5%  difference)  in  patients  receiving 
atezolizumab  in  combination  with  bevacizumab,  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin.  Other  clinically  significant 
adverse events which were observed more frequently in the atezolizumab, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and 
carboplatin arm were epistaxis, haemoptysis, cerebrovascular accident, including fatal events. 
In IMpower150, age ≥ 65 was associated with an increased risk of developing adverse events in patients 
receiving atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Data for patients ≥75 years of age are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 4.8 
of the SmPC).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
•  Safety of Atezo+Bev+CP 
compares less favourably with 
Bev+CP regarding numerical 
incidences of AEs 
•  Atezo + CP has best tolerance 
and less treatment-related 
deaths 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
IMpower150 has met both its co-primary endpoints, demonstrating superiority of Atezo + Bev + CP (arm 
B) over Bev + CP (arm C) in terms of PFS in the ITT-WT (HR=0.59; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.70; p < 0.0001) and 
Teff-high WT populations (HR=0.50; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.66; p < 0.0001) and OS in the ITT-WT population 
(HR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.96; p<0.0164). 
PFS benefit from treatment in arms B or A, as compared to arm C, was much higher for patients with 
increasing PD-L1 IHC positivity (TC2/3 or IC2/3) and clinical benefit (PFS and OS) has also been observed 
in the PD-L1 negative subgroup (TC0/IC0) in arm B as compared to arm C, albeit with a late crossing of 
the OS curves after months 12. In patients with EGFR mutations and ALK translocations, despite limited 
numbers and the lack of mature OS data, a clinically meaningful benefit for the Atezo + Bev + CP can be 
concluded after failure of TKI therapies. 
There was a high rate (30-40%) of ADA conversion (negative to positive) in both arms (A and B). The 
impact of ADA on the efficacy observed in both arms could be clinically meaningful and will be addressed 
post-approval. 
Atezo + Bev + CP exhibited higher toxicity compared to the other treatment arms as observed with the 
higher incidence of any, G3/4, serious and G5 AEs. The risks of bevacizumab must be taken into account 
when considering treatment with Atezo + Bev + CP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in PFS of 1.6 month and 4.9 months 
increase in median survival for Atezo + Bev + CP compared to Bev + CP outweighs the worst safety profile 
observed with the addition of atezolizumab to Bev + CP. 
The benefit-risk balance of Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, for 
the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) is considered positive. In patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC, Tecentriq, in 
combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate 
targeted therapies. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tecentriq in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin for the first-line 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP  considers  the  following  group  of  variations 
acceptable  and  therefore  recommends  the  variations  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Variations accepted

Extension  of  indication  to  include  in  combination  with  bevacizumab,  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  the 
first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
based on the interim results of study GO29436 (IMpower 150). As a consequence sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 
4.8, 5.1, 6.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. In addition update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to 
update the monotherapy safety data and reflect the largest pooled monotherapy population available 
(now including also data from IMvigor211 and PCD4989g studies). The Package Leaflet and the RMP 
(version 4.2) are updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to make small corrections and formatting changes throughout the SmPC.  
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

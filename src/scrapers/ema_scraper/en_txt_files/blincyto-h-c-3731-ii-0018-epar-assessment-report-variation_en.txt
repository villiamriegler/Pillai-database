2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Blincyto (Blinatumomab) was granted a conditional marketing authorization in EU on 23 November 
2015 in the indication of: “Treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative 
relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).”   
In  the  current  submission  an  extension  is  sought  to  include  paediatric  patients  1  month  of  age  and 
older. 
Background of paediatric relapse or refractory ALL  
ALL  is  a  rare  aggressive  cancer  of  the  bone  marrow  (BM),  with  approximately  6300  new  cases 
diagnosed in the EU each year. Of these, approximately half are children, ALL represents one third of 
paediatric  cancer.  B-cell  precursor  ALL  account  for  80-85%  of  total  cases  of  ALL  in  children  and  the 
majority of paediatric ALL are Philadelphia-chromosome-negative (95-97%). 
The prognosis is generally better for children than for adult. Among children with ALL, more than 95% 
achieve a CR with treatment and 75 to 85% remain progression-free 5 years from the initial diagnosis. 
However,  eventually  relapses  occur  in  up  to  25%  of  children  and  15-20%  of  children  die  from 
refractory/relapse ALL or from AEs of therapy. The prognosis for a patient with relapsed ALL depends 
on  the  time  from  diagnosis  to  relapse,  extent  of  relapse  (BM  relapse  has  a  worse  prognosis  than 
isolated  extramedullary  relapse),  cytogenetics  and  immunophenotype  (T-cell  relapse  has  a  worse 
prognosis  than  recurrence  of  B-lymphoblastic  disease)  and  especially  MRD  status.  In  paediatric  ALL, 
MRD  is  widely  recognized  as  the  most  sensitive  prognostic  factor  for  relapse  regardless  of  risk 
classification  and  MRD  status  after  salvage  therapy  is  incorporated  into  treatment  algorithms  that 
determine whether patients proceed to alloHSCT or not.  
Current treatment options and unmet need 
R/R ALL in paediatric patients is a life-threatening condition with a high unmet need. Based on results 
for  single-agent  and  multi-agent  regimens,  there  are  no  satisfactory  therapies  to  induce  durable 
remission  in  children  with  R/R  ALL.  The  current  treatment  options  consist  of  sequential  phases  of 
different  high-dose  chemotherapy  combination  regimen, 
including  doxorubicin,  daunorubicin, 
cytarabine,  vincristine,  cyclophosphamide,  methotrexate,  etoposide,  glucocorticoids  and  L-
asparaginase.  Intrathecal  chemotherapy,  with  or  without  radiation  to  the  brain,  is  also  part  of  the 
treatment regimen to prevent CNS relapse.  
In addition to limited efficacy, current treatment options have several limitations. First, the treatment 
options  rely  heavily  on  aggressive  chemotherapy  regimens  that  are  generally  cytotoxic  and  may  be 
poorly  tolerated  as  manifested  by  severe  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  and  fatigue  and  may  cause  a 
range  of  toxicities  including  cardiotoxicity,  irreversible  neuropathies,  and  renal  toxicity.  Second,  the 
toxicities  associated  with  these  treatments  may  adversely  contribute  to  reduced  effectiveness  of 
subsequent  allogeneic  HSCT,  which  relies  on  the  recovery  of  transplanted  stem  cells.  Finally,  the

reliance on a limited spectrum of drugs with similar mechanisms of action encourages the proliferation 
of drug-resistant clones, there is therefore a higher risk of cross-resistance to next line chemotherapy 
treatments for paediatric subjects. 
Up  to  25%  of  those  who  achieve  CR1  experience  1  or  more  relapse.  Following  additional  course  of 
salvage chemotherapy and local radiotherapy for extramedullary disease, as high as 85% of paediatric 
ALL  with  a  1st  relapse  achieve  a  second  CR  (CR2),  and  the  probability  of  5-year  DFS  and  OS  is 
relatively  good.  In  contrast,  the  outcome  (CR  and  DFS)  in  2nd,  3rd  and  ≥4th  relapses  decline 
dramatically  (44%,  27%  and  12%  respectively),  and  children  with  refractory  disease  suffer  a  worse 
prognosis compared to relapsed ALL (reported CR rate of 17%, OS of 121 days).

Patients  with  refractory  disease,  second  or  later  bone  marrow  relapse  or  any  marrow  relapse  after 
HSCT  are  unlikely  to  be  cured  with  continued  chemotherapy  and  have  poor  outcome.  The  goal  of 
therapy in these subgroups currently is to induce remission and to reach eligibility for HSCT, which is 
currently  the  only  curative  option  in  paediatric  patients  with  R/R  B-cell  precursor  ALL.  If,  alloHSCT  is 
not possible, the goal is to obtain long-term remission (RFS) and OS. 
Clofarabine  (Evoltra),  approved  under  exceptional  circumstances  in  the  EU,  is  the  only  single  agent 
indicated  for  “treatment  of  ALL  in  paediatric  patients  who  have  relapsed  or  are  refractory  after 
receiving at least two prior regimens and where there is no other treatment option anticipated to result 
in a durable response” (EMA, 2006). The indication is based on a phase 2 study of 61 patients from 1 
to  21  years  of  age  who  received  at  least  2  prior  regimens.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the  rate  of  CR 
plus  CR  in  the  absence  of  total  platelet  recovery  (CRp)  (CR/CRp).  In  this  patient  population,  the 
CR/CRp rate was 20% (12% subjects achieving CR and 8% CRp). The duration of CR/CRp (excluding 4 
patients with subsequent HSCT) ranged from 4.3 weeks to 58.6 weeks.

Shaded  boxes  are  the  target  population  for  blinatumomab.  Only  a  small  minority  of  patients  in  first 
relapse have received prior HSCT and are candidates for blinatumomab therapy. 
Children with refractory disease, secondary or later BM release, or any marrow relapse after HSCT, as 
indicated  with  shaded  box  in  the  above  figure,  consist  of  the  population  being  studied  in  the  pivotal 
study  of  the  claimed  paediatric  indication.  Indeed,  these  patients  have  few  treatment  options,  long-
term  survival  rate  is  very  low  and  most  chemotherapies  are  associated  with  considerable  toxicity,  so 
the unmet need is high for these paediatric population (roughly 15% to 20% of the overall paediatric 
B-precursor ALL population).  
The  therapy  goal  in  paediatric  R/R  ALL  is  to  achieve  haematological  CR,  which  offers  disease  control 
and reaches eligibility for undergoing an additional alloHSCT, which is currently the only possibility for 
cure in this difficult-to-treat patient population. 
Novel  agents  are  needed  that  provide  a  higher  rate  of  durable  remission  and  DFS  than  currently 
available drugs in order to contribute substantially to cure.  
Development rationale of Blinatumomab in paediatric ALL 
Blincyto  is  a  bispecific  T-cell  engager  antibody  construct  that  binds  specifically  to  CD19  expressed  on 
the  surface  of  cells  of  B-lineage  origin  and  CD3  expressed  on  the  surface  of  T-cells.  It  activates 
endogenous T-cells by connecting CD3 in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex with CD19 on benign and 
malignant  B-cells.  Treatment  with  Blincyto  is  associated  with  a  rapid  depletion  of  peripheral  B-cells, 
accompanied  by  T-cell  activation,  and  a  transient  increase  in  cytokine.  Blinatumomab’s  2  target 
antigens, CD3 and CD19, are both expressed in all paediatric age groups during normal development 
at levels comparable to those in adults, and paediatric B cell malignancies, like those of adults, express 
CD19.  In  vitro,  blinatumomab  triggered  the  lysis  of  CD19-positive  cells  in  6  paediatric  B  cell  ALL  cell 
lines (KOPN-8, SEMc, MHH-CALL-3, 380, REH, and NALM-6). 
Age  is one  of the  strongest  prognostic  factors in  ALL  and  the  prognosis  in  first  relapse is  much  more 
favourable in paediatric patients than in adult. Indeed, it is noted that available therapies for paediatric 
ALL with a first relapse induced a relatively high response rate (CR2: 85% to 90%), a median survival 
of 1.5 years and 5-year DFS of 27% to 40% (Ko et al, 2010; Tallen et al, 2010, Henze et al, 1991). 
Assessment report  
EMA/561153/2018  
Page 11/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However there is a particularly high unmet need in more advanced ALL such as 2nd or later BM relapse, 
relapse  after  alloHSCT  as  well  as  in  refractory  disease  having,  in  general,  a  much  worse  prognosis 
compare to  1st  relapse.  Therefore, it  was in  these  children that  blinatumomab development  has  been 
conducted (i.e. pivotal study MT103-205). This monoclonal antibody with a new mechanism of action 
targeting precursor B-cell ALL represents a relevant therapeutic interest for the present application for 
paediatric use.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No further data on absorption, distribution, elimination are submitted.   
The PK data supporting a paediatric indication are based on the Study MT103-205, and population PK 
analysis in report 122196. 
MT103-205 
Study MT103-205 is a first paediatric phase 1/2 study to investigate the PK, safety, and clinical activity 
of  blinatumomab  in  paediatric  and  adolescent  subjects  with  B-precursor  ALL  in  second  or  later  bone 
marrow relapse, in any marrow relapse after allogeneic HSCT, or refractory to other treatments. 
A  treatment  cycle  consisted  of  a  continuous  intravenous  (cIV)  infusion  over  4  weeks  followed  by  a 
treatment-free interval of 2 weeks. Subjects who achieved complete remission (CR) within 2 cycles of 
treatment could receive up to 3 additional consolidation cycles of blinatumomab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/561153/2018

Additional subjects were to be enrolled at the recommended phase 2 dose to ensure that 6 subjects in 
each of the 2 older age groups (2-6 and 7-17 years) were analysed for PK before recruitment of infants 
<  2  years  of  age  could  begin.  Then,  6  subjects  <  2  years  of  age  were  to  be  enrolled  at  the 
recommended phase 2 dose level with comprehensive PK/PD assessments. 
Blood samples were collected prior to infusion on day 1 and at any time on days 3, 8, 15, 22, and 29. 
Samples were also collected at 2, 4, and 8 hours after the end of infusion on day 29 in subjects in the 
2 to 6 and 7 to 17 years age groups. 
PK parameters will be Css, Vz (CL/Lamdaz), CL (Ro/Css, Ro being infusion rate), T1/2 (ln2/Lambdaz), 
and ratio of Css between serum and CSF. 
In  the  phase  1  part  of  the  study,  49  subjects  were  enrolled  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
blinatumomab. Of these subjects, 23 were enrolled in the dose finding part; 18 subjects were enrolled 
in the PK expansion part (9 each in age groups 2-6 and 7-17). Eight infants were enrolled in phase 1 
at the phase 2 dose (5-15 μg/m²/day).

Population PK analysis 122-196 
Data  from  8  clinical  studies,  including  1  phase  1  study  in  adult  subjects  with  relapsed  NHL  (MT103-
104),  and  5  phase  2  studies  in  adult  subjects  with  ALL  in  complete  haematological  remission  and 
minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  (MT103-202  and  MT103-203),  or  with  R/R  ALL  (MT103-206,  and 
MT103-211), or R/R Ph+ ALL (20120216), and 1 phase 1/2 study in paediatric subjects with R/R ALL 
(MT103-  205),  and  1  phase  3  study  in  adult  subjects  with  R/R  ALL  (00103311),  were  used  in  the 
blinatumomab population pharmacokinetic analysis. Subjects received blinatumomab as a cIV infusion 
over  4  weeks  (multiple  cycles),  at  doses  up  to  90  μg/m2/day  or  28  μg/day.  In  total,  3629  serum 
samples from 674 subjects were included in the blinatumomab dataset of which 664 observations were 
BQL  (5.5%).  A  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  conducted  using  a  nonlinear  mixed-effects 
modeling approach and software (NONMEM v 7.2). 
The  previously  developed population  pharmacokinetic  model based on  adult  and  paediatric  data  from 
studies  MT103-104,  MT103-202,  MT103-205,  MT103-206,  and  MT103-211  (n=382),  was  a  one-
compartment  linear  pharmacokinetic  model,  parameterized  in  terms  of  systemic  clearance  (CL)  and 
volume of distribution for the central compartment (V). This model utilized a mixture model to identify 
two  subpopulations  with  different  CL  and  separate  estimates  of  residual  variability  for  single  vs 
multicenter  studies.  The  current  analysis  is  an  update  of  the  previous  model  using  data  from  studies 
MT103-203, 20120216, and 00103311 (n=292). 
The selected covariates included demographic factors (age, BSA, sex), renal function test (CrCL), liver 
function tests (AST, ALT, albumin, total bilirubin), and disease status (LDH and hemoglobin). 
There were 505 new samples of which 111 were BQL (22%). After removing these data, a total of 394 
serum  samples  from  292  subjects  were  available  for  addition  to  the  population  pharmacokinetic 
analysis.  For  subjects  in  the  combined  dataset,  the  median  age  was  41.0  years  (range:  0.6  to  80 
years).  The  median  body  weight  was  70.7  kg  (range:  7.5  to  149  kg),  and  the  median  BSA  was  1.8 
(range: 0.4 to 2.70). 
An open one-compartment PK model with linear elimination was suitable to describe the time course of 
serum  blinatumomab  concentration  following  cIV  administration  of  doses  ranging  from  0.5  to  90 
μg/m2/day  or  2  fixed  dose  levels  of  9  and  28  μg/day  in  patients  with  hematologic  malignancies, 
including patients with relapsing NHL, MRD-positive B-lineage ALL, relapsed/refractory ALL (paediatric 
and adult), and relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL.  
The blinatumomab V was estimated to be 5.98 L; very close to the volume of plasma. Blinatumomab 
CL was 2.22 L/h. 
Blinatumomab systemic CL for the lowest adult BSA of 1.31 m2 compared to a median BSA of 1.88 m2 
is associated with a 20% reduction. However, the magnitude of this effect is relatively low compared to 
the  48%  unexplained  between-subject  variability  in  CL  and  the  56%  residual  variability  that  had  a 
64%  between-subject  variability  in  blinatumomab  pharmacokinetics.  No  other  covariate  was  kept  in 
the final model.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action is known through the initial MAA of Blincyto. 
BLINCYTO  is  a  single  chain  antibody  construct  of  the  bispecific  CD19-directed  CD3  T-cell  engager 
(BiTE)  class.  Blincyto  utilizes  a  patient’s  own  CD3-positive  T  cells  to  attack  CD19-positive  B  cells, 
including normal and malignant B-cells. Blincyto is designed to transiently connect CD19-positive cells 
with T cells; as part of this action, Blincyto causes the formation of a cytolytic synapse between the T 
cell  and  the  tumor  cell,  releasing  the  pore-forming  protein  perforin  and  the  apoptosis-inducing 
proteolytic  enzymes  granzyme  A  and  B.  The  subsequent  serial  lysis  of  multiple  malignant  cells  by  a 
single  T  cell  closely  resembles  a  natural  cytotoxic  T-cell  reaction.  Blincyto-mediated  T-cell  activation 
involves the transient release of inflammatory cytokines and the proliferation of T cells.

Synapse Induced by Blincyto 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Peripheral lymphocyte subsets were not routinely measured in paediatric subjects. 
For  patients  enrolled  in  the  phase  1  part  of  the  study  MT103-205,  IL  2,  IL-4,  IL-6,  IL  10,  IFN-γ  and 
TNF-α  were  measured  in  the  first  2  treatment  cycles.  Transient  elevation  of  IL-6,  IL-10,  and  IFN-γ 
from  baseline  to  greater  than  assay  lower  limit  of  quantification  (125  pg/mL)  was  observed.  The 
elevation was lower for IL-2 and TNF-α; while serum IL-4 levels were below LOD at all time points in 
all subjects studied.  
The magnitude of cytokine elevation was associated with the initial dose and treatment cycles. In week 
1  of  cycle  1,  cytokine  elevation  was  not  observed  in  every  subject  at  the  initial  doses  of  5  and  15 
µg/m2/day  but  observed  in  all  subjects  at  the  initial  dose  of  30  µg/m2/day.  At  the  initial  dose  of  30 
µg/m2/day: the mean peak values  (Cmax) of week  1 of cycle 1 were 23400, 3170, and 2260 pg/mL 
for IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ, respectively; while in week 1 of cycle 2, they were much lower (40.4, 277, 
and  22.8  pg/mL  for  IL-6,  IL-10,  and  IFN-γ,  respectively).  The  inter-subject  variability  in  cytokine 
elevation was large and it could be more than 100%. 
The time profiles of cytokine elevation after the start of blinatumomab infusion in cycle 1 and cycle 2 
are presented in Figure 3.

Immunogenicity 
To date, development of ADA has been detected in 9 adult subjects in the blinatumomab program. Of 
these, 7 subjects were identified with ADA that had in-vitro neutralizing activity. No ADA-positive 
results occurred among the 75 paediatric subjects who had samples for ADA testing in Study MT103-
205. 
Primary pharmacology (i.e. peripheral lymphocyte subsets) were not routinely measured in paediatric 
subjects, they have been assessed in adult subjects with NHL and ALL. As detailed in the AR of initial 
MAA, a rapid decline in blood count of T-lymphocytes was observed within 24 hours following 
blinatumomab continuous IV infusion. T-cell count returned to baseline levels within 1 to 2 weeks after 
drug administration and increased above baseline levels only in some patients. Peripheral B-cell levels 
were depleted to an undetectable level in the vast majority of patients treated with blinatumomab at 
doses ≥ 5 µg/m2/day. According to the Applicant, pharmacodynamics of blinatumomab is expected to 
be similar in paediatric and adult subjects, as both CD3 and CD19 are present on their respective cells 
at birth. The level of CD3 on the surface of foetal and neonatal αβ T cells is similar to that in adults. 
Even the degrees of CD19 on the surfaces of unfractionated neonatal B cells and adult naïve B cells are 
comparable. 
For paediatric patients enrolled in the phase 1 part of the study MT103-205, transient cytokine 
increase was observed immediately after start of blinatumomab infusion with a peak level attained 
within the first 2 days, and much less in later time. This cytokine dynamics observed in paediatric 
patients (≥ 7months of age) is consistent with cytokine profiles observed in adult subjects. The lowest 
age explored was 7 months, so the pharmacodynamics in infants younger than 7 months is unknown. 
(MO) 
The magnitude of cytokine elevation suggested that a higher initial dose may be associated with a 
higher magnitude of cytokine elevation.

With the limited paediatric data, it appears that extent of IL-10 and IL-2 elevation are similar in 
pediatric and adult subjects, and extent of IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α elevation higher in pediatric subjects. 
Nevertheless, multiple factors could affect the level of cytokine release, including but not limited to 
activity of effector T cell, tumor burden at baseline, individual subject disease factors, treatment-
related factors, time of treatment (e.g., week 1 had highest cytokine elevation) and/or blinatumomab 
dose. 
No ADA-positive results occurred among the 75 paediatric subjects who had samples for ADA testing in 
Study MT103-205. 
2.3.4.     Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study MT103-205 and the Population PK analysis 122-196 are submitted in support of the paediatric 
indication. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of 
demographic characteristics on blinatumomab pharmacokinetics. The new model is acceptable and 
consistent with what was already known of blinatumomab. 
Results suggest that age (7 months to 80 years) and gender do not influence the pharmacokinetics of 
blinatumomab. Body surface area (0.37 to 2.70 m2) influences the pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab. 
However the influence is negligible in adults and body surface area based dosing is recommended in 
the paediatric population (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
The pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab appear linear over a dose range from 5 to 30 mcg/m2/day in 
paediatric patients. At the recommended doses, the mean (SD) steady state concentration (Css) 
values were 162 (179) and 533 (392) pg/mL at 5 and 15 mcg/m2/day doses, respectively. The 
estimated mean (SD) volume of distribution (Vz), clearance (CL) and terminal half-life (t1/2,z) were 3.91 
(3.36) L/m2, 1.88 (1.90) L/hr/m2 and 2.19 (1.53) hours, respectively. 
As seen with the initial MAA, a rapid decline in blood count of T-lymphocytes was observed within 24 
hours following blinatumomab continuous IV infusion. T-cell count returned to baseline levels within 1 
to  2  weeks  after  drug  administration  and  increased  above  baseline  levels  only  in  some  patients. 
Peripheral B-cell levels were depleted to an undetectable level in the vast majority of patients treated 
with blinatumomab at doses ≥ 5 µg/m2/day.  
Pharmacodynamics  of  blinatumomab  is  expected  to be  similar  in  paediatric  (≥  7  months  of  age)  and 
adult subjects, as both CD3 and CD19 are present on their respective cells at birth. The level of CD3 
on the surface of foetal and neonatal αβ T cells is similar to that in adults. Even the degrees of CD19 
on the surfaces of unfractionated neonatal B cells and adult naïve B cells are comparable. 
There  were  no  PK/PD  data  for  children  <7  months  with  R/R  ALL  in  blinatumomab  studies  and  no 
simulations were provided below 7 months of age. The physiological changes between 1 month and 7 
months  of  age  are  important  enough  that  the  actual  results  cannot  yet  be  extrapolated  to  the  1  /  7 
months  old  age  range.  Therefore,  from  a  PK/PD  perspective,  the  extension  of  treatment  to  the 
paediatric  population  should  not  be  extended  below  7  months.  Furthermore,  taking  into  account  also 
the  extremely  limited  clinical  and  safety  data  reported  in  infants  <  1  year  (see  discussion  on  clinical 
efficacy and clinical safety), the indication is revised to exclude infants < 1 year. A statement has been 
added  in  the  SmPC  sections  4.2  and  5.2  that  there  are  little  to  no  data  for  children  below  1  year  of 
age. 
The  magnitude  of  cytokine  elevation  suggested  that  a  higher  initial  dose  may  be  associated  with  a 
higher magnitude of cytokine elevation. Iit appears that extent of IL-10 and IL-2 elevation are similar 
in  pediatric  and  adult  subjects,  and  extent  of  IL-6,  IFN-γ  and  TNF-α  elevation  higher  in  pediatric

subjects.  Nevertheless,  multiple  factors  could  affect  the  level  of  cytokine  release,  including  but  not 
limited  to  activity  of  effector  T  cell,  tumor  burden  at  baseline,  individual  subject  disease  factors, 
treatment-related  factors,  time  of  treatment  (e.g.,  week  1  had  highest  cytokine  elevation)  and/or 
blinatumomab dose.  
No ADA-positive results occurred among the 75 pediatric subjects who had samples for 
anti-blinatumomab antibodies testing in Study MT103-205. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical,  PK  and  pharmacodynamics  information  is  considered  sufficient  to  support  the  use  of 
blinatumomab in paediatric patients with R/R B-cell precursor ALL. The proposed paediatric regimen of 
5-15µg/m2/day in children <45 kg is acceptable.  
Relevant information has been included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
Relationships  between  blinatumomab  concentrations  from  the  target  dosing  regimen  at  steady  state 
(Css)  and  CR,  neurological  events,  and  CRS  events  in  45  paediatric  subjects  with  R/R  ALL  were 
explored in study MT103-205 using univariate analyses. 
Occurrence  of  CR,  CRS,  and  neurologic  events  were  analysed  using  logistic  regression  analysis.  The 
time  to  CR  and  the  time  to  neurologic  events  were  analysed  using  Cox  proportional  hazard  models. 
Analysis of the time to CRS was not conducted since >80% of the CRS events occurred during the first 
week  of  treatment.  The  average  blinatumomab  concentration  at  steady  state  (Css)  of  the  individual 
subject  was  generated  from  non-compartment  analysis.  The  exposure-  response  analyses  dataset 
included  only  those  subjects  in  study  MT103-205  where  the  exposure  metrics  were  available.  For  CR 
and  neurologic  event  analyses,  a  Css  corresponding  to  the  dose  in  the  cycle  the  event  was  observed 
was  used  as  an  independent  variable.  This  was  done  in  order  to  account  for  blinatumomab  exposure 
when subjects received an initial low dose during the first 7 days and a higher target dose afterwards. 
For CRS event analysis, blinatumomab Css following the initial dose in week 1 was used since most of 
the CRS events occurred during the first week of treatment. For each endpoint, the effect of selected 
covariates  on  the  exposure  efficacy/ADR  relationship  was  investigated  using  univariate  and  if  needed 
multivariate  stepwise  analysis  models.  Estimates  of  the  parameters  of  interest  and  95%  confidence 
intervals  (CIs)  were  provided.  P-values  were  not  adjusted  for  multiplicity  of  comparisons  and, 
therefore, should be interpreted with caution. 
For  the  all  analyses,  the  baseline  covariates  were  age,  weight,  BSA,  sex,  mixed  lineage  leukaemia 
(MLL)  abnormality,  the  percentage  of  blasts  in  bone  marrow,  counts  of  blood  components  (e.g., 
haemoglobin, platelets, peripheral blasts in blood, CD19 B cells), primary refractory (refractory to front 
line  therapy),  number  of previous  salvage therapies  (overall  and  for  subjects  without  prior  allogeneic 
HSCT), ALL subtype related to last relapse, number of prior relapses (overall and for subjects without 
prior allogeneic HSCT), early relapse (defined as relapsed with first remission duration ≤ 12 months in 
first salvage or relapsed after first salvage therapy, or relapsed within 12 months of allogeneic HSCT) 
and pre-treatment with dexamethasone.

2.4.2.  Main study 
 “A  Single-Arm  Multicenter  Phase  II  Study  preceded  by  Dose  Evaluation  to  Investigate  the 
Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of the BiTE® Antibody Blinatumomab (MT103) in Paediatric 
and  Adolescent  Patients  with  Relapsed/Refractory  B-Precursor  Acute  Lymphoblastic 
Leukaemia (ALL)” 
Methods 
This was a phase 1/2, open-label, single arm study to investigate the PK, safety and clinical activity of 
blinatumomab in paediatric patients within different age groups (<2 years, 2-6 years, 7-17 years) with 
B-precursor ALL in second or later bone marrow relapse, in any marrow relapse after alloHSCT, or 
refractory to other treatments. Once a dose has been selected in the Phase I part of the study, a Phase 
II part will begin to assess the safety and efficacy of the recommended dose level of blinatumomab in 
the same study population.  
The phase 1 of the study included 2 parts:

- 
1st part of phase 1 (dose-finding): this was a dose evaluation/escalation part using the rolling 
6 design in children aged 2 to 17 years to define a recommended dose of blinatumomab for the phase 
2 part (RP2D) of the study, based on PK, safety and efficacy data. 4 dose levels were tested: 5-15-30-
60 µg/m2/day. 
- 
2nd part of phase 1 (PK expansion): additional subjects were enrolled at RP2D to ensure that 6 
subjects in each of 2-6 and 7-17 years cohorts, followed by a group (n=6) of infants <2 years of age. 
Phase 2 (Efficacy phase): subjects aged <18 years were enrolled according to a two-stage design. In 
the 1st stage, 21 subjects were enrolled, if > 2 of 21 subjects had a response, an additional 19 
subjects were enrolled in the 2nd stage. All patients received blinatumomab at the recommended dose 
level. 
The core study consisted of a screening period, a treatment period (up to 7.5 months) and an end of 
core study visit 30 days after last dose of study medication. All subjects were followed for efficacy and 
survival for up to 24 months after treatment start.

Treatments 
Regimen for Paediatric Patients with R/R ALL 
Blinatumomab was administrated as monotherapy by a cIV infusion at a constant daily flow rate over 4 
weeks followed by a treatment-free interval of 2 weeks (6W/cycle).  
The doses of phase 1 part (dose evaluation) ranged between 3.75 and 60 µg/m2/day. During this dose 
evaluation  step,  the  MTD  was  established  at  15µg/m2/day.  But  based  on  the  overall  safety  profile, 
including  that  in  adult  patients,  the  DSMB  recommended  the  step-dose  regimen  5-15  µg/m2/day 
(RP2D) to mitigate the risks for cytokine release syndrome (CRS).  
This  recommended  regimen,  as  detailed  below,  was  used  for  subjects  in  the  phase  1  part  (PK 
expansion)  and  phase  2  part  of  the  study:  5  µg/m2/day  for  the  first  week  of  treatment  cycle  1  and 
then escalated to 15µg/m2/day for all subsequent cycles from the first week of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/561153/2018  
Page 29/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients  who  have  achieved  a  CR  within  2  cycles  of  treatment  may  receive  up  to  3  additional 
consolidation cycles of blinatumomab. Instead of consolidation cycles with blinatumomab patients may 
be  withdrawn  from  study  treatment  to  receive  chemotherapy  or  allogeneic  HSCT  at  the  discretion  of 
the investigator. Subjects with haematological relapse during their follow-up period could receive up to 
3 additional cycles of blinatumomab (retreatment).  
Hospitalisation was mandated for at least the first 7 days of the first treatment cycle, as well as in case 
of dose step and during the first 2 days of the second cycle. Treatment beyond these periods could be 
continued in an out-patient setting, including the treatment initiation for 3rd, 4th and 5th cycles.  
Treatment should be interrupted for the RP2D in case of CNS-related AE or CRS ≥ grade 2 and related 
to blinatumomab, or any clinically relevant ≥ grade 3 related to blinatumomab. If an AE had resolved 
to  CTCAE  Grade  ≤  1  within  1  week  after  infusion  interruption,  the  infusion  was  to  be  resumed  at  a 
reduced  dose  of  3.75  μg/m2/day.  After  at  least  7  days,  the  dose  could  be  again  increased.  The 
maximum dose administered must not be higher than 15 μg/m2/day.

Prior and concomitant treatment 
Recommended pre-phase medication: 
Subjects with a WBC of >30 x 109/L prior to start of treatment were strongly recommended to receive 
rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg IV daily or twice daily for up to 5 days.  
Dexamethasone (up to 24mg) or hydroxyurea (dose not specified) was recommended for up to 4 days 
during  the  screening  period  in  order  to  prevent  CRS.  However,  this  was  mandatory  for  subjects  with 
>50% BM blast proportion. 
Obligatory pre- and concomitant medication: 
CNS prophylaxis (i.e. intrathecal regimen) within 1 week prior to treatment start was mandatory. 
10  mg/m2  dexamethasone  orally  or  IV  was  to  be  given  treatment  6-12  hours  prior  to  the  start  of 
blinatumomab therapy, then 5 mg/m2 between 30 minutes and start of infusion on day 1/cycle 1. 
During  treatment:  tumor  lysis  prophylaxis,  adequate  hydration  and  further  measures  including  IV 
bicarbonate to adjust urine pH, and allopurinol or rasburicase as needed.

Complete remission (CR): CR was defined by the protocol as achievement of M1 BM (<5% blasts in the 
bone  marrow)  and  no  evidence  of  circulating  blasts  or  extra-medullary  disease.  There  are  3  CR 
subcategories based on peripheral blood counts:  
•  CRc  with  complete  hematologic  recovery:  <5%  BM  blasts,  no  evidence  of  disease  and  M1  BM  with 
complete recovery of peripheral blood counts (i.e. Platelets > 100 x 109/L and ANC > 1.0 x 109/L) 
• CR* with incomplete hematologic recovery: <5% BM blasts, no evidence of disease and M1 BM with 
incomplete  recovery  of  peripheral  blood  counts  (i.e.  Platelets  >50  x  109/L  but  ≤100  x  109/L  and/or 
ANC >0.5 x 109/L but ≤1 x 109/L) 
•  CR3  with  blast  free  hypoplastic  or  aplastic  BM:  <  5%  BM  blasts,  no  evidence  of  disease  and 
without full or incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts (i.e. Platelets ≤ 50 x 109/L and / 
or ANC ≤ 0.5 x 109/L). 
MRD response: MRD <10-4 measured by PCR or flow cytometry, as assessed by central laboratories. 
Complete  MRD  response:  no  detectable  leukaemia  cells  by  PCR  or  flow  cytometry  ,  with  a  sensitivity 
and range of at least 10-4. 
Partial  remission  (PR):  complete  disappearance  of  circulating  blasts  and  achievement  of  M2  marrow 
status (≥5% and <25% blasts cells) and appearance of normal progenitor cells. Sites with CRF entry 
based on study protocol version 2.0 (dated on 11JUL 2012 or earlier) may also consider BM becomes 
M1 but not qualify for CRc or CR* (CR3) as PR. (cf Statistical Analysis plan page 17)  
Stable disease (SD): Patients who fail to qualify for CRc, CR*, blast free hypoplastic (CR3), PR or PD. 
Progressive  disease  (PD):  an  increase  of  ≥  25%  in  BM  blasts,  or  an  absolute  increase  of  ≥  5,000 
cells/μl  in  the  number  of  circulating  leukaemia  cells,  or  development  of  extra-medullary  disease,  or 
other laboratory/clinical evidence of PD. 
Haematological relapse: proportion of BM blasts >25% following documented CR, or documentation 
of haematological or extramedullary relapse. 
MRD relapse: patients lose response (≥10-4) and increase in the MRD level by ≥ 1 log as compared to 
the first MRD response level. 
Duration of CR response: from the date of BM aspiration when response was detected for the first time 
to the date of BM aspiration at which  haematological relapse or PD was first  detected, or the date of 
diagnosis  on  which  the  haematological  or  extra  medullary  relapse  was  documented,  or  the  date  of 
death  if  patient  died  due  to  PD,  or  the  date  of  end  of  core  study  if  primary  reason  for  treatment 
termination was haematological or extramedullary relapse, whichever is earlier.  
Relapse free survival was calculated for FAS subjects who achieved CR during the core study from the 
date of BM aspiration when response was detected for the first time until the date of BM aspiration at 
which haematological relapse was first detected or the date of diagnosis on which the haematological 
or  extra  medullary  relapse  was  documented  or  the  date  of  death  due  to  any  cause  was  used  as  the 
event date for relapse-free survival, whichever is earlier.  
The  bone  marrow  was  assessed  on  day  15  and  at  the  end  of  the  infusion  period  of  C1.  During  the 
following  cycles,  the  BM  was  aspirated  only  once  at  the  end  of  each  cycle.  The  evaluation  of  BM 
infiltration  degree  (i.e.  percentage  of  leukemic  blasts  in  BM)  and  the  treatment  decision  were  based 
upon  local  assessment  unless  the  central  results  were  available  before  the  treatment  start.  Study 
results were based upon central BM assessment.

Sample size 
Given the rarity of this disease, no formal sample size calculation was conducted in the phase 1 part of 
the  study.  It  was  determined  by  the  incidence  and  severity  of  AEs  in  the  rolling  6  phase  1  design 
(Skolnik  2008).  The  probability  of  detecting  at  least  one  patient  with  a  DLT  in  six  patients  receiving 
blinatumomab is 0.469, 0.738, and 0.882, when the unknown true incidence rates of such events are 
10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively. A maximum of 48 patients was anticipated. 
In the phase 2 part, sample size of 40 patients (21 at stage 1 and 19 at stage 2) for the Phase II part 
of the study is based on a Simon like two-stage design with the following parameters: 5% two-sided 
type  I  error,  80%  power,  a  null  hypothesis  in  CR  rate  of  10%  and  an  alternative  hypothesis  rate  of 
27.5%.

Statistical methods 
No statistical hypothesis was defined for the phase 1 part. For the phase 2 of the study, the null 
hypothesis (H0) proportion p0=10% for CR rate, and an alternative hypothesis (H1) proportion 
p1=27.5%. If “pi” is the true response rate of blinatumomab in paediatric and adolescent 
relapsed/refractory ALL, the following hypotheses will be tested: H0: pi ≤ p0 vs. H1: pi ≥ p1 
With 40 treated patients (21 at stage 1 and 19 at stage 2), the study would be stopped if not more 
than 2 out of 21 patients were observed with a response during stage 1. The null hypothesis would be 
rejected and the study would be declared a success at the end of the study if 9 or more out of 40 
patients were observed with a response.  
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were calculated for response rates. Time-to-event data were 
analysed by Kaplan-Meier methods.

different observed response rates

In  addition,  with  this  sample  size,  the  probability  of  early  stopping  at  stage  1  is  only  4.6%  if  the 
alternative hypotheses rate of 27.5% is true. 
The  Primary  analysis  set  was  the  efficacy  analyses  based  on  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS),  which 
comprised all patients who received any infusion of blinatumomab.  
Per-protocol analysis set (PPS): all patients from the FAS who did not have any major relevant protocol 
violation which could have an impact on the efficacy evaluation of the patient.  
Pooled analysis set (PAS): all patients who were intended to receive 5-15 μg/m²/day from the Phase I 
and  Phase  II  parts  of  the  study.  This  additional  pooled  analysis  was  performed  for  disposition  data, 
demographic and baseline characteristics, study drug exposure and the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints. 
Two  interim  analyses  were  planned;  the  1st  interim  analysis  set  included  all  phase  1  subjects;  the 
second  interim  analysis  set  included  subjects  who  enrolled  in  the  stage  1  of  phase  2.    The  Primary 
analysis  was  performed  with  all  data  available  at  the  time  when  all  subjects  had  completed  the  core 
study  and  could  be  evaluated  for  the  primary  analysis,  but  none  completed  the  24-month  efficacy 
follow-up. (cut-off date for data: 12 January 2015). The final analysis was completed when all subjects 
have completed 24-month FU of the study. (Last subject completed FU assessment: 24 May 2016)

Response rate with exact two-sided 
95% CI 
N/A 
For the phase 2 portion, the hypothesis 
(H0: π ≤ 10% vs. H1: π > 27.5%) was 
tested based on Simon two-stage 
design. 
π is the true rate of subjects with CR 
and H0 is the null hypothesis.  The 
efficacy of blinatumomab was 
established if the null hypothesis could 
be rejected. 
CR rate within 
the first 2 
cycles of 
blinatumomab 
treatment 
Calculated as the number of 
subjects with CR within the first 
2 treatment cycles divided by the 
total number of subjects in the 
analysis set. CR rate was also 
calculated for the core study 
period (defined as the entire 
treatment period, including the 
30-day follow-up visit after the 
last treatment visit).  
A CR was defined as M1 bone 
marrow (< 5% blasts in 
evaluable bone marrow) with no 
evidence of circulating blasts or 
extra-medullary disease (Lauten 
et al, 2012). 
CR subjects were further 
subclassified based on their 
peripheral blood counts:  
• M1 bone marrow with full 
recovery of peripheral blood 
counts:  met the criteria for CR 
with platelets > 100 × 109/L 
and  
ANC > 1.0 × 109/L 
• M1 bone marrow with 
incomplete recovery of 
peripheral blood counts:  met 
the criteria for CR but platelets 
> 50 × 109/L and ≤ 100 × 109/L 
and ANC > 0.5 × 109/L and ≤ 
1.0 × 109/La 
• M1 marrow that did not 
qualify for full or incomplete 
recovery of peripheral blood 
counts:  met the criteria for CR 
without complete or incomplete 
recovery of peripheral blood 
counts

Key Supportive Endpoints 
RFS  
Assessed for subjects who achieved a CR during the 
core study or during the first 2 cycles of treatment, 
and was measured from the time the subject first 
achieved remission until first documented relapse or 
death due to any cause.   
OS 
Measured for all subjects from the time the subject 
received the first treatment of blinatumomab until 
death due to any cause.   
Median, 1st, and 3rd 
quartile time of RFS 
with two-sided 95% 
CI (if estimable) 
was calculated by 
Kaplan-Meier 
methods.   
Median observation

a  M1 bone marrow with incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts is similar to the definition of CRh* used in 
the adult relapsed/refractory studies in the original marketing application (CRh* = bone marrow blasts ≤ 5%, no

Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
A total of 93 subjects were enrolled and received ≥1 dose of blinatumomab in the study: 49 in phase 1 
and 44 in phase 2. 
Of 49 subjects of the phase 1 part: 23 in the dose-finding part, 18 in the PK expansion part (n=9 each 
in  age  groups  2-6  and  7-17),  and  8  infants  (<2  years)  at  RP2D  (5-15  µg/m2/day).  Of  44  subjects 
enrolled  in  the  phase  2  part,  2  of  them  were  infants,  making  a  total  of  10  subjects  <2  years  of  age 
enrolled in phase 1 and 2 and received blinatumomab at 5-15 µg/m2/day. 
The  population  of  interest  is  those  subjects  who  received  the  recommended  dose  (5-15  µg/m2/day) 
during  either  phase  1  or  phase  2.  Overall,  70  subjects  received this  dose  (5-15  µg/m2/day  FAS),  26 
from phase1 and 44 from phase 2.

Overall, 4.3% (3/70) of subjects in the 5-15 µg/m2/day FAS completed 5 cycles of treatment. The 
most common reasons for not completing 5 cycles of treatment included lack of efficacy (32.9%, 
23/70), physician’s decision (15.7%, 11/70), other (15.7%, 11/70), and HSCT (11.4%, 8/70). 
Conduct of the study 
Study MT103-205 was conducted at 26 centers in Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and 
the USA.  
Study initiation date: 31 January 2012 (first screening visit performed).  
Study Completion date: 24 May 2016 (last subject completed follow-up assessment) 
A primary analysis CSR of this study was generated on 15 December 2015 with the data cut-off date 
12  January  2015.  The  final  analysis  CSR  was  released  on  19  September  2016  with  the  data  cut-off 
date 24 May 2016 after all subjects being followed for up to 24 months from the start of blinatumomab 
treatment. 
The original study protocol was dated on 17 June 2011 and was subsequently amended 6 times. The 
SAP  was  originally  issued  on  06  February  2013  and  amended  once  (version  2.0  dated  25  November 
2014),  following  the  amendment  3  of  protocol.  Briefly,  complete  remission  was  changed  as  the 
treatment  response  of  M1  with  complete  recovery  of  peripheral  blood  counts  (CRc),  M1  with 
incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts (CRh*), or M1 that did not qualify for full or incomplete 
recovery  of  peripheral  blood  counts  (CR3,  M1  without  full  or  incomplete  recovery  of  peripheral  blood 
counts) within first 2 cycles of blinatumomab. The analysis of event-free survival specified in the SAP 
was not conducted.

Numbers analysed 
The primary efficacy population (5-15 µg/m2/day FAS) consisted of a total of 70 subjects treated at 5-
15  µg/m2/day  including  26  patients  from  the  phase  1  and  44  patients  from  the  phase  2.  The  FAS 
included 10 infants (7 months to 2 years), 20 children (2-12 years) and 40 adolescents (7-17 years). 
Most subjects in the 5 15 µg/m²/day FAS were male (67.1%) and white (87.3%). The median age was 
8.0 years (range: 0 to 17 years). Fifty-two subjects (74.3%) subjects had bone marrow blasts ≥ 50% 
at baseline based on central laboratory assessments. 
More than half of subjects (52.8%) had 2 or more prior relapses. The majority of subjects (71%) had 
relapsed  <6  months  prior  to  the  start  of  blinatumomab  treatment.  The  median  time  between  last 
relapse and the start of blinatumomab treatment was only 1.92 months (range: 0.1 to 13.7 months). 
The  median  time  between  the  initial  disease  diagnosis  and  first  blinatumomab  treatment  was  29.6 
months (range: 3.6 to 164.1 months). 
Forty  subjects  (57.1%)  had  prior  allogeneic  HSCT.  Of  the  30  subjects  without  prior  HSCT,  2  subjects 
were primary refractory, 20 subjects had a 1 prior relapse and were refractory, and 4 subjects had a 
second  or  greater  relapse  and  were  refractory,  resulting  in  a  total  of  26  refractory  subjects  (86.7%) 
without prior HSCT.  Of the 40 subjects with prior HSCT, 13 (32.5%) had a refractory relapse. Thus, of 
the total of 70 subjects, 2 subjects were primary refractory and 37 had a refractory relapse, resulting 
in 39 (55.7%) refractory subjects at baseline. 
Cytogenetic and molecular aberrations were also collected at baseline. In the 5 15 µg/m²/day FAS, 8 
subjects had t(4;11)/MLL-AF4 translocations, and 2 subjects had “other” MLL translocations, resulting 
in 10 subjects (14.3%) overall with MLL translocations, of which 8 were in infants.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Rate of CR within the First 2 cycles.  
Phase 2 (n=44) 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the phase 2 part of this study was rate of CR within the first 2 cycles 
of blinatumomab treatment. The CR rate (14/44), regardless of peripheral counts recovery, was 31.8% 
(18.6%, 47.6%) in phase 2 FAS. With the lower bound of this 95% CI exceeding 10%, it can be 
concluded that the true response rate is >10% based on the study hypothesis in phase 2 setting. The 
null hypothesis (H0<10%) can be rejected and study therefore can be declared a success. 6.8% 
(3/44) of subjects had a partial remission. 
Table 11 Best Response during the First two Cycles in Phase 2 
5-15µg/m2/day FAS (n=70) 
The best response for the first 2 cycles of treatment during phase 1 or phase 2 for the 5 15 µg/m²/day 
FAS and PPS is presented in the following Table. The CR rate (5 15 µg/m²/day FAS) within the first 2 
cycles of treatment with blinatumomab was 38.6% (27/70) (M1 with full recovery of peripheral blood 
counts = 17.1% [12/70]; M1 with incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts = 15.7% [11/70]); 
M1  without  full  or  incomplete  recovery  of  peripheral  blood  counts  =  5.7%  [4/70]).  In  addition  to  CR 
response  rate,  5.7%  (4/70)  of  subjects  had  a  partial  remission.  When  these  are  added  to  CR 
responses, the response rate within the first 2 cycles for the 5-15 µg/m²/day FAS was 44.3%.

Secondary efficacy endpoints  
Relapse-free survival (RFS) 
RFS  was  assessed  for  subjects  in  the  5-15  µg/m²/day  FAS  who  achieved  a  CR  during  the  core  study 
and was measured from the time the subject first achieved remission until first documented relapse or 
death due to any cause. Subjects without a documented relapse (haematological or extramedullary) or 
who did not die were censored at the time of their last bone marrow assessment or their last survival 
follow-up visit confirming remission. 
In the final analysis, there were 27 responders, the median RFS was 4.4 months (95% CI: 2.3 to 7.6 
months)  and  the  median  observation  time  was  23.1  months.  Five  subjects  (18.5%;  5/27)  were  in 
remission  at  last  assessment;  of  these,  4  subjects  completed  24  months  of  follow-up,  and  1  subject 
withdrew  consent  while in  remission  on  day  56.  Seven  subjects  (25.9%,  7/27)  died,  and 15  subjects 
(55.6%, 15/27) had a relapse.

RFS of subjects in CRc (M1 with full recovery) and CRh* (M1 with incomplete recovery) 
In the primary analysis with a median observation time of 11.5 months, the median RFS for subjects in 
CRc (N = 12) was 8.1 months (95% CI: 1.9 to 13.9 months) compared with 3.5 months (95% CI: 0.6 
to 16.4 months) for subjects in CRh* (N = 11).

Duration of remission (TTR: Time to haematological relapse) 
Duration  of  remission  (i.e.,  time  to  haematological  relapse,  TTR)  was  measured  for  subjects  who 
achieved  a  CR,  and  was  measured  from  the  time  the  subject  first  achieved  remission  until  first 
documented relapse or death due to disease progression. 
In  the  primary  analysis,  there  were  27  responders  who  all  responded  during  the  first  2  cycles  of 
treatment  for  the  5-15µg/m2/day  FAS.  7  of  them  (25.9%,  7/27)  completed  the  study  in  submission 
(censored). The median TTR (duration of remission) was 5.2 months, with a median observation time 
of 11.5 months.  
The median TTR for subjects who achieved CRc (M1 with full recovery of peripheral blood counts) was 
10.3 months (95% CI: 1.2 months to n.e.; N = 12) compared with 3.5 months (95% CI: 0.6 to 16.4 
months; N = 11) for subjects who achieved a CRh* (M1 with incomplete recovery of peripheral blood 
counts).

Overall survival (OS) 
Overall survival was measured for all subjects from the time the subject received the first treatment of 
blinatumomab until death due to any cause.

Table 15 OS, estimated by KM methods  
In  the  final  analysis,  the  median  OS  was  7.5  months  (95%  CI:  4.0  to  11.8  months),  with  a  median 
observation  time  of  23.8  months.  At  the  time  of  the  last  follow-up  date,  31.4%  (22/70)  of  subjects 
were censored (alive at the last follow-up visit for survival) and 68.6% (48/70) of subjects had died. 
Of  these  22  subjects,  14  were  alive  at  the  end  of  the  24-month  follow-up  period  (rounded  study 
duration); the rest discontinued the study early.  
Table 16 OS, estimated by KM methods, censoring patients with HSCT 
When  censoring  for  subjects  with  HSCT  after  remission  induced  by  blinatumomab  treatment  (n=25), 
median  OS  was  6.5  months  (95%  CI:  4.0  to  10.4  months),  with  a  median  observation  time  of  5.6 
months. For the FAS 5-15µg/m2/day (n=70), 14.3% (10/70) of subjects were alive at the last follow-
up visit for survival (censored), 35.7% (25/70) proceeded to HSCT (censored) and 50.0% (35/70) of 
subjects had died (event).

Proportion of subjects who received an alloHSCT during blinatumomab induced remission 
Subjects were eligible for alloHSCT as early as the end of the 1st treatment cycle at the discretion of 
the investigator, whether or not response was observed during this time.  
In  the  final  analysis  (CSR  19  Sept  2016),  35.7%  (25/70)  of  eligible  subjects  in  the  5-15  µg/m²/day 
FAS  received  an  alloHSCT.  Of  these  25  transplanted  subjects,  11  subjects  (15.7%;  11/70), 
representing 40.7% (11/27) of responders, received an alloHSCT after achieving a CR within the first 2 
cycles  including  8  subjects  without  chemotherapy  and  3  subjects  with  anti-leukaemia  chemotherapy 
prior to HSCT. In addition, 2 subjects (2.9%; 2/70) who achieved CR within the first 2 cycles received 
an HSCT but were not in remission at the time of the HSCT. 
Twelve subjects (17.1%; 12/70) received an alloHSCT without achieving a CR within the first 2 cycles. 
Table Proportion of patients with alloHSCT after treatment, by best response, remission 
status and anti-leukaemia agents 
As shown in the following table, among the 4 time-intervals considered (1 to 3 months, 4 to 6 months, 
7 to 9 months, and ≥ 10 months after achieving CR), the highest rate of transplantation among those 
eligible  to  receive  one  was  during  the  1  to  3  month  time  interval;  the  probability  of  undergoing  a 
transplant among those still eligible to receive one during this time interval was 34.2%.  
Exploratory efficacy Endpoints 
Rate of MRD response during the first 2 cycles of treatment 
MRD response was measured by both PCR and Flow Cytometry (EU) or only by Flow Cytometry (US). 
Thus,  because  only  Flow  Cytometry  data  were  available  from  both  European  and  US  subjects,  the 
results were published on the basis of the Flow data.  
The  overall  MRD  response  rates  during  the  first  2  cycles  were  21.4%,  all  MRD  responders  were 
complete MRD responders (defined as no detection of individual rearrangements of immunoglobulin or 
TCR  genes  either  by  PCR  or  flow  cytometry).  For  subjects  who  achieved  CR  within  the  first  2  cycles, 
MRD response rates improved to 51.9%. Among those subjects with MRD assessments available, MRD 
response  rates  for  subjects  who  achieved  CRc  (M1+full  recovery),  CRh*  (M1+nincomplete  recovery) 
and CR3 (M1+no recovery) were 58.3%, 45.5% and 50.0% respectively.

Ad  hoc  exploratory  RFS  analyses  were  performed  for  subjects  who  achieved  CR  and  had  MRD 
assessments (n=26).  
For the 26 subjects who achieved CR during the core study, the median RFS was 7.3 months (95% CI: 
2.7  to  16.4  months;  N  =  14)  for  subjects  who  achieved  an  MRD  complete  response  with  a  median 
observation time of 23.1 months compared with 1.9 months (95% CI: 0.8 to 6.0 months; N = 12) for 
subjects  who  remained  MRD  positive,  with  a  median  observation  time  of  23.9  months.  Subgroups

CR Within the First 2 Cycles of Treatment (Primary analysis CSR 15 Dec 2015) 
Among the prespecified analyses, the factors most strongly associated with response were percentage 
of blasts in the bone marrow, age group, prior HSCT, prior salvage therapies, number of prior relapses 
without HSCT, and disease stage at baseline.

Statistical hypothesis for CR rate tested the phase 2 part of this study  
H0: pi ≤ p0 (10%) vs. H1: pi ≥ p1 (27.5%) was tested based on Simon two-
stage design with a two-sided type I error of 5% and a power of 80%. This 
hypothesis testing was used to establish the efficacy of blinatumomab if the 
null hypothesis could be rejected and the study could be declared a success if 
≥ 9 of 40 patients were observed with a response.

Supportive studies 
Expanded Access Study 20130320 
Study 20130320 is an ongoing, single-arm, multi-centre, expanded access protocol for blinatumomab 
for  the  treatment  of  paediatric  and  adolescent  subjects  with  relapsed  or  refractory  B-cell  precursor 
ALL. 
Study population 
This study includes paediatric subjects aged > 28 days and < 18 years with relapsed/refractory B-cell 
precursor ALL with: 
• 
• 
• 
Second or later bone marrow relapse 
Any marrow relapse after allogeneic HSCT, or  
Refractory to other treatments 
-  For  patients  in  first  relapse:  failure  to  achieve  a  CR  following  full  standard  reinduction 
chemotherapy regimen 
- For patients who have not achieved a first remission: failure to achieve remission following a 
full standard induction regimen 
• 
Subjects previously treated with blinatumomab may be eligible, if blinatumomab was tolerated 
and response was achieved 
• 
≥ 5% blasts in bone marrow (M2 or M3 marrow) at study enrolment 
It is estimated that up to approximately 80 subjects will be treated under this protocol, however actual 
sample size at study completion may vary.  
Treatment: blinatumomab was given by continuous infusion for 4 weeks of a 6-week cycle, according 
to 5-15 µg/m2/day escalate-dose regimen, 6w/cycle, up to 5 cycles 
Study endpoints 
There were no primary efficacy endpoints for this study; endpoints included: 
•  Incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related AEs (primary safety endpoint) 
•  Incidence of CR within 2 cycles of blinatumomab 
•  MRD remission within 2 cycles of blinatumomab 
•  RFS 
•  OS 
•  Incidence of alloHSCT 
•  100-day mortality after alloHSCT 
Study conduct 
Enrolment for this study is still ongoing. As of the data cut-off (20 August 2015), a total of 21 subjects 
were  screened  and  20  subjects  were  enrolled.  All  20  subjects  (100%)  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
Assessment report

blinatumomab and were included in the FAS.  
Supportive efficacy results were provided from an interim analysis of 20 of an estimated 80 subjects. 
All statistical analyses are entirely descriptive in nature with no formal statistical testing performed. 
Disposition of Subjects 
At the time of the data cut-off, 14 of 20 subjects (70.0%) discontinued blinatumomab infusion, mostly 
due to disease progression (7/14) and other protocol specified criteria (3/14, including > 25% blasts in 
the BM (M3) at the end of cycle 1 (n=1), and haematological or extramedullary relapse subsequent to 
CR  (n=2).  One  subject  completed  investigational  product  (determined  per  investigator  assessment). 
Three  subjects  (15.0%)  ended  the  study  due  to  death.  Seventeen  subjects  remained  ongoing  in  the 
study as of 20 August 2015. 
Baseline Demographics and Disease Characteristics 
The overall population included 6 boys (30.0%) and 14 girls (70.0%) with a median age of 8.5 years 
(range: 1, 16). Most of the subjects belonged to the age group of 7 to 17 years old (12 [60.0%]), with 
4 subjects (20.0%) in each of the other 2 age groups (0 to < 2 years and 2 to 6 years).

2  subjects  (10%)  were  primary  refractory  and  3  subjects  (15.0%)  were  refractory  to  reinduction 
therapy.  The  majority  of  subjects  were  in  ≥2  relapse  (11  [55.0%]).  10  subjects  had  prior  HSCT,  8 
subjects (40.0%) relapsed after alloHSCT. 1 subject was previously treated with blinatumomab during 
the Study MT103-205.  
Half of the subjects (10 [50%]) had a current genetic abnormality; the most common type of genetic 
abnormality was a t(v;11q23)/MLL rearrangement (5 [25.0%]). One subject (5.0%) was Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive  (t(9;22)(q34;q11)ABLI/BCR.  The  median  time  from  initial  ALL  diagnosis  until 
initiation of blinatumomab treatment was 32.8 months (range: 2 to 115 months). 
Four subjects (20.0%) had a history of extramedullary disease; all instances of extramedullary disease 
occurred  in  the  CNS.  Per  protocol,  subjects  with  CNS  leukaemia  that  was  well-controlled  with 
intrathecal therapy were allowed to be enrolled in the study.   
Bone marrow blasts at baseline were assessed by local laboratory: 4 (20.0%) subjects had ≥ 5% to < 
10% BM blasts, 3 (15.0%) subjects had 10 to < 25% blasts, 4 (20.0%) subjects had 25% to < 50% 
blasts, and 9 subjects (45.0%) had ≥ 50% blasts. Overall, a total of 13 (65.0%) subjects had ≥ 25% 
bone marrow blasts at baseline (the threshold for inclusion in Study MT103-205).

receive induction chemotherapy plus 2 cycles of intensive chemotherapy or 2 cycles of blinatumomab 
treatment  followed  by  HSCT.    Low  risk  subjects  are  randomized  to  receive  induction  chemotherapy 
followed by additional chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab. 
Population: Enrolled subjects were ≥ 1 year through < 31 years of age with first relapse of B-ALL with 
or without extramedullary disease.

safety,  and  tolerability  of  blinatumomab 
in  adult  and  paediatric  Japanese  subjects  with 
relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL.  Paediatric subjects are enrolled only in the phase 1b portion 
of  the  study.  The  phase  1b  part  investigated  the  safety,  efficacy,  PK,  and  PD  of  blinatumomab  to 
determine the MTD in both adult and paediatric subjects. 
Analysis  performed  across  trials  (pooled  analyses  and  meta-analysis):  Historical 
Comparator Studies in Paediatric R/R ALL 
To  provide  context  for  the  treatment  effect  of  blinatumomab  compared  with  standard  of  care  option, 
results from a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA, Study 120521), analysis of EU historical comparator 
data (Study 20120299) and US historical comparator data (Study 20140228), as well as a Propensity 
Score Analysis are submitted to further evaluate the relevance of the efficacy data from the single-arm 
pivotal study MT103-205. 
The goal of these studies was to obtain subject level data for standard of care treatment in paediatric 
patients in second or later bone marrow relapse, in any marrow relapse after allogeneic HSCT, or who 
were refractory to other treatments, a similar population to that in blinatumomab Study MT103-205 in 
order  to  produce  estimates  of  outcomes  in  patients  treated  with  standard  of  care  chemotherapy  that

could  serve  to  assist  with  the  interpretation  of  results  from  the  blinatumomab  clinical  study  MT103-
205. 
In addition, to further investigate the outcomes of the historical comparator studies as comparators to 
Study MT103-205, a Propensity Score Analysis was conducted, to compare OS (primary endpoint) and 
CR  in  subjects  treated  with  blinatumomab  in  Study  MT103-205  to  subjects  treated  with  standard  of 
care chemotherapy using data from paediatric historical comparator studies. 
Model-based Meta-analysis Study 120521 
Title  Model-based  Meta-analysis  (MBMA)  of  haematological  remission  and  overall  survival  among 
paediatric  Patients  with  Relapsed  or  Refractory  Philadelphia  negative  (Ph-)  B-precursor  Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL). 
Objective  
The  objectives  of  the  meta-analysis  were  to  quantify  the  proportion  of  CR,  EFS,  and  OS  for  existing 
salvage  therapies  in  a  paediatric  relapsed/refractory  ALL  population  like  the  one  enrolled  in  study 
MT103-205,  and  to  estimate  the  efficacy  of  blinatumomab  in  the  paediatric  relapsed/refractory  ALL 
population relative to existing salvage therapies with respect to these 3 outcomes using virtual clinical 
trial simulations 
Study methods  
The dataset was constructed from all published (between January 1995 and December 2013) English-
language  studies  reporting  on  clinical  outcomes  in  patients  with  R/R  ALL  and  comprised  a  total  of 
12211  adult  and  paediatric  R/R  ALL  patients  across  62  studies,  including  8153  paediatric  patients 
across 38 published studies. A subset of more recent study (post-2006) were considered. 
The  MBMA  was  based  on  a  published  analysis  of  609  adults  in  relapsed  ALL  who  participated  in  the 
Medical  Research  Council  UKALL12/ECOG2993  study  (Fielding  2007)  and  utilised  models  with  the 
identification  of  influential  study-level  prognostic  covariates.  By  including  both  adult  and  paediatric 
studies, the MBMA could estimate any deviations in the Fielding model parameters due to differences 
between adult and paediatric patients. 
The resulting MBMA construct was used to project CR, EFS, and OS with existing salvage therapies for 
a  paediatric  population  similar  to  that  in  blinatumomab  Study  MT103-205.  The  magnitude  of  the 
blinatumomab treatment effect relative to existing salvage therapies on proportion of CR, EFS, and OS 
for  a  population  similar  to  the  population  enrolled  in  Study  MT103-205  was  estimated  using  virtual 
clinical  trial  simulation.  Clinical  trial  simulations  were  performed  by  sampling  subject  level  prognostic 
factors  and  covariates  from  the  Study  MT103-205  study  population  to  generate  1000  virtual  clinical 
trials with 70 paediatric subjects per arm sampled with replacement from Study MT103-205. 
Results 
Complete Remission 
The  proportion  of  CR  estimates  from  53  studies  including  6428  adult  (n  = 2658)  and  paediatric  (n  = 
3770) subjects were included in this analysis. 
For  subjects  with  prognostic  factors  similar  to  the  subjects  in  Study  MT103-205  receiving  second  or 
greater salvage, the projected proportion of CR (95% CI) under existing salvage therapies was 0.344 
(95% CI:  0.132, 0.622).   Furthermore, treatment with blinatumomab was projected, on average, to 
Assessment report  
EMA/561153/2018

increase the proportion of CR by 0.042.  Across 1000 virtual studies, the median of the calculated odds 
ratios for proportion of CR is 1.20 (95% CI:  0.48, 2.91) compared to existing salvage therapies when 
evaluated in a head to head study.  
A  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed,  restricting  studies  to  post-2006  publication  dates.  Using  a 
database of studies published post 2006, the projected proportion of CR was 0.323 (95% CI: 0.112 to 
0.620) and the calculated odds ratio across 1000 virtual studies was 1.27 (95% CI: 0.55, 3.06). 
Event-free Survival 
The MBMA for EFS was conducted based on survival curves from 13 studies including 1005 adult (n = 
361) and paediatric (n = 644) subjects. 
For subjects with prognostic factors similar to the subjects in Study MT103-205, the projected median 
EFS  under  existing  salvage  therapies  was  11.6  months  (95%  CI:  4.8  to  60).  Virtual  clinical  trial 
simulations  comparing  effect  of  blinatumomab  treatment  to  existing  standard  therapies  were  not 
conducted  given  the  small  number  of  paediatric  studies  (N  =  6),  and  the  large  difference  in  the 
projected median EFS versus the observed value in study MT103-205. 
Overall Survival 
The  MBMA  for  OS  was  conducted  based  on  survival  curves  from  43  studies  including  9729  adult 
(n = 3264) and paediatric (n = 6465) subjects.  
In  subjects  with  prognostic  factors  similar  to the  subjects  in  study  MT103-205,  the  projected  median 
OS under existing salvage therapies was 10.1 months (95% CI:  4.4 to 60). In the subset restricting 
studies to post-2006 publication dates, the projected median OS was 8.2 months (95% CI: 3.6, 60+). 
Considering post-2006 publication dates and bone marrow infiltration, which were important covariates 
identified in the historical comparator and propensity score analyses, the projected median OS was 4.2 
months (95% PI: 1.9 to 10.5) for existing salvage therapies. 
Clinical  trial  simulations  were  conducted  based  on  the  model  considering  post-2006  publication  dates 
and  degree  of  bone  marrow  infiltration;  treatment  with  blinatumomab  was  projected  to  increase 
median OS by 108% and have a median hazard ratio for OS of 0.55 (95%CI:  0.35, 0.88) compared to 
existing salvage therapies.

Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia 
Objective and endpoints 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  summarize  haematological  CR  in  paediatric  patients  with 
Philadelphia  chromosome-negative  R/R  B-precursor  ALL,  and  to  produce  a  weighted  estimate  of  CR 
that  can  serve  to  assist  with  the  interpretation  of  CR  results  from  the  blinatumomab  clinical  study 
MT103-205.  Key  secondary  objectives  included  estimating  OS,  MRD  response,  RFS,  the  proportion  of 
patients subsequently receiving allogeneic HSCT, and time to complete remission. Additional analyses 
were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  range  of  CR  and  OS  across  key  subgroups  of  the  paediatric 
relapsed/refractory ALL patient population. 
Study Population 
Patients  were  included  in  the  study  if  they  met  each  of  the  following  criteria:  1)  Philadelphia 
chromosome-negative relapsed / recovery B-precursor ALL; 2) with disease refractory to full standard 
induction or reinduction chemotherapy, or in relapse after HSCT, or in 2nd or later relapse; 3) received 
treatment for relapsed or refractory disease in 2005 or later; 4) age ≤18 at the time of treatment for 
the  qualified  relapse or  refractory  disease; 5)  no  CNS  involvement  at the  time  of  qualified  relapse or 
refractory disease; 6) no treatment with blinatumomab prior to or at the time of the qualified relapsed 
or refractory disease; and 7) data on treatment and outcomes available.  In addition to the initial study 
criteria above, inclusion was further restricted to those patients with greater than 25% leukemic blasts 
in the bone marrow at the time of qualifying relapse or refractory disease. 
Study methods 
Study 20120299 retrospective pooled analysis combines previously collected information from 3 study 
groups in the EU (Germany, Austria and Italy). These historical data were used to establish a database 
of  anonymized  information  on  198  paediatric  relapsed/refractory  B-precursor  ALL  patients  who 
received  standard  of  care  (SOC)  after  experiencing  refractory  disease  to  full  standard  induction  or 
reinduction chemotherapy, relapse following HSCT, or a second or later haematological relapse.  
Complete remission for the weighted analysis was defined as in the blinatumomab study MT103-205: 
CRc (M1, no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, full recovery of peripheral blood 
counts); CRh* (M1, no evidence of disease, incomplete recovery); or CR3 (M1, no evidence of disease, 
without full or incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts). 
For  the primary  analyses, endpoints  were  weighted  to  the distribution  of prognostic  characteristics  of 
patients in the MT103-205 study. Three strata were formed according to the disease stage at the time 
of the qualifying salvage:  
•  without prior HSCT and with ≥ 2 relapses  
•  without prior HSCT and with refractory disease 
• 
relapsed after HSCT

For each patient, there were potentially multiple qualifying salvage treatments to assess endpoints for 
comparison to the subjects in Study MT103-205. Because the subjects in Study MT103-205 could have 
started blinatumomab at any of these qualifying treatments, the sponsor planned to examine both the 
first  qualifying  salvage  treatment  and  the  last  qualifying  salvage  treatment  to  create  bounds  for  the 
endpoints. After more careful assessment of the MT103-205 study population, which has such a poor 
prognosis  with  the  majority  of  subjects  having  received  multiple  prior  treatments,  relapsing  after 
HSCT, having high blast counts prior to blinatumomab treatment, and having short duration (within 6 
months) from the last treatment to blinatumomab, the sponsor considers that using the last qualifying 
salvage treatment for comparison is more appropriate given the severity of the disease in the MT103-
205 subjects. 
Results 
A total of 198 patients were included in the primary analysis set. 64% were male, and the median age 
(range)  was  9  years  (0  to  17  years).  The  mean  age  was  8.8  years  (SD  4.4  years).  Selected  disease 
characteristics by qualifying salvage treatment are presented in Table 27.

The  overall  CR  rate,  weighted  to the  MT103-205  study  population,  was  48% (95%  CI:  40% to  56%) 
for  the  last  qualifying  salvage  (where  CR  was  defined  as  M1  bone  marrow  and  no  evidence  of 
circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, regardless of peripheral blood count recovery. The CR rate 
for patients with full recovery of peripheral blood counts was 14% (95% CI: 1% to 24%) when using 
the last qualifying salvage treatment.  
In the study MT103-205 population, 70.0% of subjects qualifying for blinatumomab treatment relapsed 
and were retreated within 6 months of their last chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT compared with 43% 
in  the  historical  comparator  data,  a  key  prognostic  factor  for  outcomes.  Patients  who  were  treated 
again within 6 months of their previous salvage chemotherapy or HSCT (which comprised the majority 
of subjects from Study MT103 205) had the worst prognosis, with a CR rate of 31% (95% CI: 21% to 
43%)  and  a  CR  rate  for  patients  with  full  peripheral  blood  count  recovery  of  10%  (95%  CI:  1%  to 
32%).  
The weighted median OS was 5.9 months (95% CI: 3.5 to 7.0 months) when using the last qualifying 
salvage  treatment,  where  survival  time  was  calculated  from  the  start  of  the  last  qualifying  salvage 
treatment or the last relapse if the qualifying salvage date was unavailable. Patients who were treated 
again  within  6  months  of  their  previous  salvage  chemotherapy  or  HSCT  had  a  median  OS  of  4.0 
months (95% CI:  3.2 to 4.7 months).   
Among patients who achieved a CR, strata-specific (unweighted) estimates of median RFS ranged from 
8.2  months  to  16.9  months  for  the  last  qualifying  salvage  depending  on  the  disease  stage.  The 
weighted median relapse-free survival was 13.3 months (95% CI, 0.0-20.5 months). Of note, relapse 
events  may  be  under-reported  and,  thus,  the  reported  RFS  may  actually  be  substantially  lower  than 
reported herein.  For these reasons, RFS results should be interpreted cautiously.

Historical comparator Study 20140228  
Title A Retrospective Cohort Study of Re-induction Treatment Outcome Among Paediatric Patients with 
Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) 
Objective and endpoints 
Study  20140228  is  a  retrospective  cohort  study  of  paediatric  patients  treated  for  relapsed/refractory 
ALL at 23 clinical sites in the TACL Consortium in the US, Canada and Australia during calendar years 
2005 to 2013. 
The primary objective of this study was to estimate CR in paediatric patients with R/R B-cell precursor 
ALL, receiving standard of care treatment and to develop a weighted estimate of CR that can serve as 
an  external  comparator  to  the  CR  proportion  in  subjects  enrolled  in  the  blinatumomab  clinical  study 
MT103-205.  Additional  analyses  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  range  of  CR  and  OS  across  key 
subgroups of the paediatric R/R ALL patient population. Key secondary objectives included estimating 
OS,  molecular  CR,  (CR  with  MRD  response),  RFS,  EFS  (EFS  probabilities),  and  the  proportion  of 
patients subsequently receiving allogeneic HSCT.

Study Population 
Patient  inclusion  criteria  for  the  primary  analysis  set  included  1)  paediatric  patients  with  R/R  B-cell 
precursor ALL who experienced a qualifying treatment failure between 2005 to 2013 (see definition for 
treatment  failure  below);  2)  age  <  18  years  at  time  of  earliest  qualifying  treatment  failure;  3)  bone 
marrow  blasts  >  25%  before  salvage  therapy;  4)  no  CNS  involvement  at  relapse;  5)  no  previous 
treatment  with  blinatumomab;  and  6)  with  a  qualifying  treatment  failure  defined  as  second  or  later 
relapse, relapsed after HSCT, or refractory disease. Based on the data provided, patients that did not 
receive  any  type  of  post-relapse  treatment  or  received  only  palliative  care  were  not  included  in  this 
study population. 
Methods 
Methods for analysis of CR, OS, RFS and allogeneic HSCT were the same as for Study 20120299. For 
the  primary  analyses,  endpoints  were  weighted  to  the  distribution  of  prognostic  characteristics  of 
patients  in  the  MT103-205  study.  Ad  hoc  weighted  analyses  with  other  covariates  were  conducted 
similarly to Study 20120299. 
Results 
A total of 173 patients were included in the primary analysis set. Among the 173 patients, 51% were 
male, and the median age (range) was 11 years (0  to 17 years).  The mean (SD) age was 9.7 (4.8) 
years. Twenty-nine percent of patients had normal cytogenetics, 12% had unknown abnormalities, and 
59%  had  known  abnormalities,  the  majority  specifically  being  hyperdiploid  (14%)  or  having  11q23 
(MLL  gene)  rearrangement  (12%).  Compared  to  the  distribution  of  disease  characteristics  in  Study 
MT103-205, this study population had a lower proportion of patients who had relapsed after HSCT or 
had  relapsed  within  6  months  of  the  most  recent  chemotherapy  or  HSCT  (52.6%  in  Study  20140228 
versus 70.0% in Study MT103-205), which are key prognostic factors for outcomes.

The overall CR rate (regardless of count recovery), weighted to the MT103-205 study population (i.e., 
weighted  by  second  or  later  relapse,  relapse  after  HSCT,  or  refractory  to  prior  treatment)  was  43% 
(95% CI: 34% to 51%) when using the last qualifying salvage treatment. The CR rate for patients with 
full recovery of peripheral blood counts was 9% (95% CI: 3% to 13%) when using the last qualifying 
salvage treatment. The weighted median OS was 6.7 months (95% CI: 2.9 to 8.7 months) when using 
the  last  qualifying  salvage  treatment,  where  survival  time  was  calculated  from  the  start  of  the  last 
qualifying salvage treatment or the last relapse if the qualifying salvage date was unavailable.   
A greater proportion of subjects in Study MT103-205 had higher rates of HSCT or a shorter time from 
previous chemotherapy or HSCT (within 6 months from previous chemotherapy or HSCT) than patients 
in  Study  20140228.  Ad-hoc  weighted  analyses  conducted  to  account  for  these  factors  showed  a  CR 
rate of 29% (95% CI: 20% to 40%), a CR rate for patients with full peripheral blood count recovery of 
5% (95% CI:  1% to 13%), and a median OS of 3.4 months (95% CI: 2.4 to 4.6 months).  
Among  patients  who  achieved  a  CR,  strata-specific  (unweighted)  estimates  of  median  relapse-free 
survival  ranged  from  5.7  months  to  25.0  months  for  the  last  qualifying  salvage  depending  on  the 
disease  stage.  The  weighted  median  RFS  was  18.3  months  (95%  CI,  1.4  to  33.9  months).  Of  note,

Propensity Score analysis 
To  further  investigate  the  historical  data  as  a  comparator  to  Study  MT103-205,  a  propensity  score 
analysis was also conducted, including several sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness.  
Design and objectives 
The primary objective of this analysis is to evaluate the effect of blinatumomab on primary endpoint, 
OS, and secondary endpoint, rates of CR, as compared to standard of care chemotherapy in subjects 
with R/R ALL.  
In  order  to  meet  this  objective,  the  aim  was  to  achieve  adequate  balance  between  historical 
comparator populations (from studies 20140228 and 20120299) and the Study MT103-205 population 
using  a  propensity  score  approach  and  to  conduct  the  analyses  by  making  adjustments  for  each 
subject’s propensity score. 
Methods 
Data from all 3 sources (Studies MT103-205, 20140228, and 20120299) were combined for analysis. 
The  primary  analysis  set  from  Study  MT103-205  was  used  to  represent  the  treated  population.  For 
studies 20140228 and 20140299, 359 subjects (unweighted) were included.   
The  following  covariates  were  available  across  all  3  studies  and  were  considered  for  the  propensity 
score model:

Results 
For the primary endpoint of OS, a numeric improvement associated with blinatumomab treatment was 
demonstrated  (HR  =  0.68,  95%  CI  =  0.43  to  1.10),  and  this  result  was  supported  by  numerous 
sensitivity  analyses  including  those  that  included  only  the  EU  based  historical  data  from  Study 
20120299.  
For the secondary endpoint of CR rate, improvements were not demonstrated for the analysis involving 
combined US and EU historical controls or for the analyses involving individual regions for the control 
group. The predicted CR rate (95% CI) for standard of care subjects and blinatumomab subjects was 
44% (39% to 50%) and 31% (16% to 52%), respectively, with an estimated odds ratio and 95% CI of 
0.58 (0.23, 1.43). The estimated rate of CR with full recovery of peripheral blood counts was 7% (5% 
to  12%)  among  the  control  group  compared  to  13%  (6%  to  25%)  among  the  blinatumomab  group 
with an odds ratio of 1.92 (95% CI: 0.75, 4.91).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  evaluation  of  blinatumomab  in  paediatric  R/R  ALL  is  based  primary  on  data  from  Study 
MT103-205,  a  phase  1/2  study  in  70  children  who  were  exposed  to  blinatumomab  at  the  proposed 
registrational  dose  of  5-15µg/m2/day.  Supportive  efficacy  results  are  provided  from  an  interim 
analysis  of  20  of  an  estimated  80  subjects  in  the  ongoing,  single-arm,  open-label,  expanded  access 
Study 20130320 in paediatric subjects with R/R B-cell precursor ALL. 
In order to provide context for the treatment effect of blinatumomab compared with standard of care 
option,  results  from  a  model-based  meta-analysis  (MBMA,  Study  120521),  analysis  of  EU  historical 
comparator data (Study 20120299) and US historical comparator data (Study 20140228), as well as a 
Propensity Score Analysis are submitted to further evaluate the relevance of the efficacy data from the 
single-arm pivotal study MT103-205. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  supporting  this  variation  was  a  first  paediatric  phase  1/2,  open-label,  single  arm 
study  to  investigate  the  PK,  safety  and  clinical  activity  of  blinatumomab  in  paediatric  patients  within 
different  age  groups  (<2  years,  2-6  years,  7-17  years)  with  B-precursor  ALL  in  second  or  later  bone 
marrow relapse, in any marrow relapse after alloHSCT, or refractory to other treatments.  
In  view  of  high  unmet  and  urgent  patient  needs  in  targeted  heterogeneous  late-line  paediatric 
population,  lack  of  recommended  treatments  for  such  subsets  with  poor  prognosis,  and  high  rate  of 
haematological and MRD responses of blinatumomab observed in adult patients, this combined phase 
1/2 study design is considered appropriate to efficiently establish a recommended dose by the phase 1 
part and to detect the evidence of anti-leukemic activity of a single agent in the phase 2 part of this 
single-arm study. It is agreed that a randomisation trial in this late-line paediatric population would be 
difficult. 
Children with refractory disease, secondary or later BM release, or any marrow relapse after HSCT, as 
indicated with shaded box in the above figure 3, consist of the population being studied in the pivotal 
study MT103-205. The majority of children in 1st relapse (i.e. 1st relapse without prior alloHSCT) were 
excluded from pivotal study.  
As  for  adult  patients,  blinatumomab  is  given  as  monotherapy,  administrated  as  a  cIV  infusion  at  a 
constant  daily  flow  rate  over  4  weeks  followed  by  a  treatment-free  interval  of  2  weeks  (6W/cycle). 
Based on PK/PD and overall safety profile, the proposed dose is 5µg/m2/day for cycle 1 on days 1 to 7 
and  15µg/m2/day  thereafter  for  paediatric  patients≤45kg.  Specific  reconstitution  and  dilution 
instructions for each dose, infusion duration and rate are provided in the SmPC for children weighing 
less  than  45  kg.  The  proposed  dose  for  paediatric  patients  is  considered  acceptable  based  on  PK/PD 
and  overall  safety  profile.  Indeed,  it  is  clearly  justify  by  the  necessity,  particularly  in  the  case  of 
important  tumor  burden,  to  limit  the  adverse  reaction  of  CRS  in  children  who  are  frequently  with 
previous alloHSCT (e.g. 57.1% in Study MT103-205) and immune impairment due to persistent aplasia 
either by blasts infiltration or previous intensive chemotherapy. This risk of CRS is important especially 
as  the  burden  of  precursor  B-cell  is  important  (e.g.  median  of  BM  blast  infiltration:  75.5%  in  Study 
MT103-205) and thus during the first week of treatment initiation by Blincyto. 
The primary endpoint was CR within the first 2 treatment cycles, regardless of peripheral blood counts 
recovery. It consists of a composite endpoint (CRc+CRh*+CR3) based on patient’s peripheral counts.

Eligibility  for  alloHSCT  based  on  CR  and  MRD  response  is  an  important  endpoint  in  evaluating 
blinatumomab  in  the  second  (or  greater)  relapse  setting,  the  “proportion  of  patients  who  undergo 
alloHSCT after treatment with blinatumomab” was included in secondary endpoints.  
The  definition  of  haematological  relapse  (proportion  of  BM  blasts  >25%  following  documented  CR,  or 
documentation  of  haematological  or  extramedullary  relapse)  is  neither  used  in  previous  studies  of 
blinatumomab in adult R/R ALL nor in line with NCCN guidelines (i.e. proportion of blasts in BM > 5% 
or blasts in peripheral blood after documented CR). 
MRD  status  after  induction/early  conduction  therapy  is  the  most  powerful  independent  prognostic 
factor. The guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man recommends that CR is 
defined according to established clinical criteria, but supportive evidence in terms of MRD as defined, 
e.g.  by  molecular  criteria  should  be  sought  when  applicable.  MRD  was  only  considered  as  an 
exploratory endpoint. 
In  view  of  high  unmet  and  urgent  patient  needs  in  targeted  heterogeneous  late-line  paediatric 
population,  lack  of  recommended  treatments  for  such  subsets  with  poor  prognosis,  and  high  rate  of 
haematological  and  MRD  responses  of  blinatumomab  observed in  adult  patients,  the  combined  phase 
1/2 study design is considered appropriate to efficiently establish a recommended dose by the phase 1 
part and to detect the evidence of anti-leukemic activity of a single agent in the phase 2 part of this 
single-arm study.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy population (5-15 µg/m2/day FAS) consisted of a total of 70 subjects treated at 5-
15  µg/m2/day  including  26  patients  from  the  phase  1  and  44  patients  from  the  phase  2.  The  FAS 
included 10 infants (7 months to 2 years), 20 children (2-12 years) and 40 adolescents (7-17 years). 
The median age was 8.0 years (range: 0 to 17 years).  
The subject population in Study MT103-205 reflects one in advance stage with a very poor prognosis 
based  on  the  number  of  prior  relapse,  time  since  last  relapse,  refractory  disease,  previous  alloHSCT 
and  disease  immunophenotype:  52.8%  had  2  or  more  prior  relapses,  71%  had  relapsed  <6  months 
prior to the start of blinatumomab and the median time since last relapse was only 1.9 months. 57.1% 
had prior alloHSCT and 55.7% were refractory to their most recent regimen before entering the study. 
The  median  time  between  last  alloHSCT  and  subsequent  relapse  was  short  (8.93  months).  Of  30 
subjects without prior allo-HSCT, 26 of them had refractory disease including 2 primary refractory, 20 
refractory  1st  relapse  and  4  refractory  2nd  relapse.  The  median  BM  blast  infiltration  at  baseline  was 
75.5%, and 74.3% of subjects had bone marrow blasts ≥ 50% at baseline based on central laboratory 
assessments.  
Few  subjects  completed  5  cycles  of  treatment  (n=3).  The  most  common  reason  for  early 
discontinuation  was  related  to  uncontrolled  primary  disease,  such  as  lack  of  efficacy  (32.9%  n=23), 
change  to  chemotherapy  (7.1%,  n=5),  disease  relapse  (4.3%,  n=3)  and  perhaps  also  some  of 
physician  decisions  (15.7%,  n=11).  11  subjects  did  not  complete  5  cycles  due  to  “Other”  reason 
(11/70), “all but 1 reason for other was progressive disease or haematological relapse” as mentioned 
in the CSR (page 99). It is not clear why “disease relapse” (n=3) and “Other  (progressive disease or 
haematological relapse)” (n=10) were separated from and not considered as “lack of efficacy”.  At the 
time  of  final  analysis  (CSR  dated  on  19  September  2016),  68.6%  (48/70)  of  5-15  µg/m2/day  FAS 
died.   
The  Primary  efficacy  endpoint  CR  rate  (CRc+CRh*+CR3),  regardless  of  peripheral  counts  recovery, 
was  31.8%  (18.6%,  47.6%)  in  phase  2  5-15µg/m2/day  FAS  (n=44).  Based  on  hypothesis  for  this

phase 2 part, with lower bound of this 95% CI exceeding 10%, the H0 can be rejected. By using only 
CRc+CRh* as initially defined, it is also reassuring to see that the observed CRc+CRh* rate was 25% 
(95%CI:  13.2%,  40.3%),  with  the  lower  bound  of  95%  CI  exceeding  10%  (H0)  and  upper  bound 
exceeding  27.5%  (H1).  Therefore,  the  null  hypothesis  could  be  rejected  and  the  efficacy  of 
blinatumomab was considered established according to CSP. 
For 5-15 µg/mg/day FAS (n=70), CRc + CRh* rate was 32.9%, including 12 subjects achieved CR with 
full recovery (17.1%). In addition with PR (5.7%), the response rate within the first 2 cycles for the 5-
15 µg/m²/day FAS was 39.6%. This result is impressive especially in this advanced paediatric ALL with 
a particular poor prognosis and few effective standard treatment options. 
The  overall  rates  of  CRc+CRh*+CR3  for  refractory  subjects  (n=39)  were  30.8%  and  CRc  of  15.4%, 
suggesting 
that  blinatumomab 
induced  a  meaningful  anti-leukaemia  activity 
in  refractory 
subpopulations which are typically difficult to treat with available therapies. 
All  CR  were  achieved  during  the  first  2  cycles.  3  subjects  who  had  achieved  CRh*  converted  to  CRc 
during cycle 3 (21.4%, 15/70). Similar to results observed in adult ALL, the activity of blinatumomab 
was also fast in paediatric patients.  
The  median  RFS  of  27/70  responders  was  4.4  months.  A  numerically  longer  median  of  RFS  was 
reported for subjects in CRc compared to subjects in CRh* (8.1 vs 3.5 months). For each categories, 
RFS was earlier when censoring at the time of HSCT (CRc 6.0 months, CRh* 1.4 months). It is noted 
that  for  subjects  in  CR3  (M1  without  full  or  incomplete  recovery  n=4  during  the  first  2  cycles),  their 
observed RFS durations were extremely short: 0.9 months (page 116 CSR, no source analysis is found 
in the CSR). This result supports that the outcome of subjects in CR3 would be very different (worse) 
compared  to  subjects  in  CRc+CRh*  and  supports  this  CR3  subcategory  should  not  be  taken  into 
account in the primary efficacy endpoint of this study. 
The  median  TTR  (duration  of  remission)  was  5.2  months,  with  a  median  observation  time  of  11.5 
months. It was longer for subjects who achieved CRc compared to subjects in CRh* (10.3 months vs 
3.5 months). This analysis should be updated in final CSR when all subjects completed 24 months of 
follow-up.  
In  the  final  analysis,  the  median  OS  was  7.5  months  (95%  CI:  4.0  to  11.8  months),  with  a  median 
observation time of 23.8 months. 
This  study  targeted  a  paediatric  population  with  an  aggressive  R/R  ALL,  more  than  half  of  subjects 
(57.1%  40/70)  had  already  received  prior  HSCT.  In  this  later-line  setting,  there  were  still  one-third 
(35.7%,  25/70)  of  subjects  became  eligible  and  received  an  alloHSCT.  In  particular,  almost  a  half  of 
subjects  who  achieved  a  CRc,  CRh*  or  CR3  (48.1%,  13/27),  have  proceeded  to  alloHSCT  while  in 
remission and 8 of them (29.6%, 8/27) received alloHSCT without any other subsequent anti-leukemic 
medications.  Such  rate  of  HSCT  is  considered  encouraging  in  the  targeted  population,  in  whom  the 
treatment  goal  is  cure  by  alloHSCT  as  a  consolidation  therapy  after  achieving  CR.  The  rate  of 
transplantation was highest during the 1 to 3 month interval following treatment by blinatumomab, an 
interval necessary to find a donor and prepare the transplantation.  
The treatment goal in this setting is cure, and children who achieve CR will have opportunity to receive 
alloHSCT  as  a  consolidation  therapy.  Blinatumomab  permitted  a  third  of  subjects  to  become  eligible 
and received an alloHSCT after remission induced by blinatumomab. Such rate of HSCT is considered 
encouraging.  However,  the  100-day  mortality  post-alloHSCT  was  as  high  as  25%  and  the  survival 
status  after  alloHSCT  would  not  be  improved  as  compared  to  that  of  overall  study  population.

Uncertainties of the real benefit of blinatumomab still persist for paediatric population. As a result, the 
rate of 100-day mortality post-alloHSCT has been added in the SmPC section 5.1. 
The place of alloHSCT, the only curative approach for R/R ALL, is particularly important for children 
with second or greater relapse. As largely discussed in the assessment of Blincyto in adult R/R ALL 
(EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0009), although impressive rate of CR quickly achieved (< 2 cycles of Blincyto) 
and high rate of alloHSCT in heavily treated children, the real gains in OS with alloHSCT after induction 
by Blincyto are unknown.  
The claimed extension of indication included the children 1 month and older with R/R ALL. However, 
children in 1st relapse (except those with prior alloHSCT) were excluded from pivotal study, the B/R of 
Blincyto in this subsetting is unknown. In addition, the lowest explored was 7 months in pivotal Study 
MT103-205, so the efficacy, safety and PK/PD in infants younger than 7 months is missing, and the 
physiological changes between infant (1-6 months) and older children are important enough that the 
clinical data of blinatumomab cannot yet be extrapolated to the 1 - 7 months old age range. 
Consequently, the indication was revised in order to clearly reflect the studied population with later line 
ALL who might benefit from Blincyto.  
Although  the  small  number  of  subjects  in  some  subgroups  limit  comparisons,  the  CR  rates  were  still 
high even in subpopulation with very poor prognostic such as subjects with post-alloHSCT relapse (CR 
47.5%), with refractory ALL (30.8%) and also in infants <2 years of age (60%).   
No subject tested positive for anti-blinatumomab antibodies in this study.  
15  of  70  (21.4%)  paediatric  subjects  achieved  a  MRD  response,  all  were  MRD  complete  responders. 
This MRD remission rate is slightly lower than that in adults R/R ALL (29.9% in phase 3 Study Tower). 
It is noted that 4 subjects had different MRD status according to Flow Cytometry or the PCR results: 3 
subjects  had  an  MRD  NON-response  by  PCR  but  MRD  Complete  response  by  Flow  Cytometry,  while 
these  3  subjects  were  classified  as  having  MRD  Complete  response  in  CSR.  1  subject  had  an  MRD 
Complete  response  by  PCR  but  MRD  Non-response  by  Flow  Cytometry,  this  subject  was  classified  as 
having an MRD non-response in CSR. The lower MRD rates in this paediatric population than in adult 
R/R  ALL  patients  may  at  least  in  part  due  to  the  fact  that  targeted  paediatric  R/R  ALL  setting 
represents a more advanced disease than that studied in adults studies (MT103-211, Tower) and these 
paediatric patients are often treated more aggressively with more heavy front-line therapy than adults. 
In the Expanded Access Study 20130320 The CR rate within 2 cycles was 50.0% (10/20: 7 in CRc and 
3  in  CRh*).  7  of  10  responder  had  available  MRD  data,  the  MRD  rate  was  85.7%  (6/7)  for  these 
subjects. These results are encouraging and in accordance with previous data observed in the pivotal 
study.  However,  these  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Indeed,  the  sample  size  is  not 
enough to draw any firm conclusion on the benefit of blinatumomab in this population. In this regard, 
confidence intervals are wide.  
The  treatment  effect  of  blinatumomab  was  compared  with  standard  of  care  option,  results  from  a 
model-based  meta-analysis  (MBMA,  Study  120521),  analysis  of  EU  historical comparator  data  (Study 
20120299)  and  US  historical  comparator  data  (Study  20140228),  as  well  as  a  Propensity  Score 
Analysis  are  submitted  to  further  evaluate  the  relevance  of  the  efficacy  data  from  the  single-arm 
pivotal study MT103-205. In MBMA of Study 120521, the proportion of CR estimates were performed 
from  53  studies  including  6428  adult  (n  =  2658)  and  paediatric  (n  =  3770)  subjects.  The  MBMA  for 
EFS  was  conducted  based  on  survival  curves  from  13  studies  including  1005  adult  (n  =  361)  and 
paediatric (n = 644) subjects and the MBMA for OS was conducted based on survival curves from 43 
studies  including  9729  adult  (n = 3264)  and  paediatric  (n = 6465)  subjects.  For  subjects  with 
prognostic factors similar to the subjects in Study MT103-205 receiving second or greater salvage, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/561153/2018

projected  proportion  of  CR  (95%  CI)  under  existing  salvage  therapies  was  0.344  (95%  CI:    0.132, 
0.622), the projected median EFS under existing salvage therapies was 11.6 months (95% CI: 4.8 to 
60) and the projected median OS was 10.1 months (95% CI: 4.4 to 60).  
These  results  indicated  poor  prognosis  for  the  R/R  ALL  subjects  on  treatment  outcomes  receiving 
existing  salvage  therapies.  Trial  simulation  predicted  blinatumomab  would  modestly  increase  the 
proportion  of  CR  (median  odds  ratio  of  1.27)  and  significantly  increases  OS  compared  with  existing 
salvage therapies (median HR [95%CI] of 0.55 [0.35 to 0.88]. These results should be considered with 
caution  due  to  uncertainty  in  parameter  estimation  and  heterogeneity  across  studies.  These 
projections  provide  additional  supportive  evidence  that  the  prognosis  for  R/R  ALL  paediatric  subjects 
are  poor  with  existing  salvage  treatment,  and  blinatumomab  at  the  proposed  dosing  has  not  worse 
outcome than those available therapies for paediatric patients. 
Historical  comparator  Study  20120299  is  a  retrospective  pooled  analysis  which  combined  previously 
collected information from 3 study groups in the EU (Germany, Austria and Italy). It included a total of 
198 paediatric relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL patients who received standard of care (SOC) after 
experiencing  refractory  disease  to  full  standard  induction  or  reinduction  chemotherapy,  relapse 
following  HSCT,  or  a  second  or  later  haematological  relapse.  The  mean  age  was  8.8  years  (SD  4.4 
years).  
Historical comparator Study 20140228 is a retrospective cohort study of paediatric patients treated for 
relapsed/refractory  ALL  at  23  clinical  sites  in  the  TACL  Consortium  in  the  US,  Canada  and  Australia 
during calendar years 2005 to 2013. A total of 173 patients were included in the primary analysis set. 
The  mean  (SD)  age  was  9.7  (4.8)  years.  Given  the  rarity  of  paediatric  relapsed/refractory  ALL,  the 
historical data from Study 20120299 and Study 20140228 represent 2 of the larger paediatric studies. 
Compared to Study MT103-205, there were some notable differences in key prognostic factors such as 
a lower proportion of patients who had relapsed after HSCT and who were retreated within 6 months of 
their most recent chemotherapy or HSCT in both historical studies. CR (CRc+CRh*+CR3) and weighted 
by  disease  status  were  48%  (95%  CI,  40%  to  56%)  in  Study  20120299  and  43%  (95%  CI,  34%  to 
51%) in Study 20140228. CRc with full recovery weighted by disease status were 14% (95% CI, 1% 
to  24%)  in  Study  20120299  and  9%  (95%  CI,  3%  to  13%)  in  Study  20140228  and  9.6%  (95%  CI, 
4.9% to 13.7%) for the 2 studies combined. Median OS weighted by disease status were 5.9 months 
(95% CI, 3.5 to 7.0 months) in Study 20120299 and 6.7 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 8.7 months) in Study 
20140228.  
To  further  investigate  the  historical  data  as  a  comparator  to  Study  MT103-205,  a  propensity  score 
analysis was also conducted. For the primary endpoint of OS, a numeric improvement associated with 
blinatumomab  treatment was  demonstrated  (HR  =  0.68,  95%  CI  =  0.43  to  1.10).  For  the  secondary 
endpoint  of  CR  rate,  improvements  were  not  demonstrated.  The  small  sample  sizes  and  substantial 
heterogeneity  observed  limited  the  ability  to  fully  adjust  for  these  differences  in  prognostic  factors 
between the historical comparator studies and Study MT103-205. Although no clear conclusion can be 
drawn from these external comparisons, it is agreed that these studies support that the prognosis for 
paediatric  patients  with  R/R  ALL  treated  with  standard  or  care  chemotherapy  is  extremely  poor 
(median  CRc  around  10%  and  median  OS  around  6  months).  Patients  who  were  treated  within  6 
months of their prior salvage treatment or HSCT (approximately 70% of the patients treated in Study 
MT103-205) had the worst prognoses with the lowest CRs and median overall survival of 4 months or 
less. 
Additional expert consultation 
The SAG-Oncology was consulted on the following questions:  
Assessment report  
EMA/561153/2018  
Page 71/115 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Please discuss the clinical relevance of the efficacy results in adults and children, in 
particular considering the improvement in CR observed within 2 cycles and the high 
rates of allo-HSCT, when seen in the light of the OS results.  
It  is  difficult  to  be  precise  on  the  relevance  of  the  results  in  terms  of  MRD  negativity  in  adults 
compared  to  children,  although  possible  differences  were  discussed.  There  was  a  concern  about  the 
finding that blinatumomab followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation may be associated 
with slightly higher mortality although this was based on small numbers (MT103-203).  
Data from the ongoing ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group will also be of interest to address some of 
the uncertainty about long term outcome. 
-  Please  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  to  cover  infants  aged  from  1  month  since  the 
lowest age explored in paediatric pivotal study MT102-205 was 7 months, and most 
of  all  front  line  and  primary  salvage  and/or  HSCT  take  time,  even  in  case  of  rare 
neonatal  ALL,  patients  will  most  likely  be  older  than  6-12  months  when  becoming 
eligible for Blincyto.    
This  indication  is  extremely  rare  in  view  of  the  high  response  rate  to  chemotherapy  in  very  young 
children and there were concerns in view of the lack of data in this group. However, in those rare cases 
there  is  a  clear  unmet  medical  need.  There  is  no  strong  biological  or  pharmacological  rationale  to 
expect  differences  in  activity  for  antibodies  in  very  young  patients,  below  the  age  studied,  although 
this  is  based  on  assumptions.  Differences  in  metabolism  observed  for  chemotherapy  are  likely  not 
relevant  for  blinatumomab.  There  may  be  concerns  in  terms  of  safety,  in  particular  neurotoxicity  in 
view of the development but this is again based on speculation. In view of the unmet medical need and 
reasonable  assumption,  use  in  the  very  young  should  not  be  prohibited  provided  the  risks  are 
adequately managed. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Blincyto is adequately demonstrated in the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year 
or older with Philadelphia chromosome negative B-cell precursor ALL which is refractory or in relapse 
after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation, and when other treatment options are not considered suitable. 
Recommended daily dose is by patient weight. Patients greater than or equal to 45 kg receive a 
fixed-dose and for patients less than 45 kg, the dose is calculated using the patient’s body surface area 
(BSA). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- 
- 
The MAH will provide efficacy data from Study 20180130, a long-term follow-up for in pediatric 
high-risk patients enrolled in Study 20120215 described in the PhV plan (see RMP).    
The MAH will also provide data from Study 20130320, an open-label, multi-center, expanded 
access protocol of blinatumomab for the treatment of pediatric and adolescent subjects with 
relapsed and/or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (see RMP).

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Blincyto  is  currently  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-
negative R/R B-cell precursor ALL. The safety profile in SmPC was mainly based on one pivotal Phase 
II  Study  MT103-211  where  189  adult  patients  with  R/R  ALL  received  Blincyto,  administered  as  a 
continuous  intravenous  infusion  (CIVI).  The  initial  dose  of  blinatumomab  is  9  μg/day  for  the  first  7 
days of treatment (to mitigate for potential CRS and neurologic events associated with introduction to 
blinatumomab)  which  then  will  be  escalated  (dose  step)  to  28  μg/day  starting  on  day  8  (week  2) 
through day 29 (week 4) of the cycle 1 and for up to 5 cycles.  
In  the  approved  indication  (R/R  ALL),  the  most  serious  adverse  reactions  that  may  occur  during 
blinatumomab  treatment  include:  infections  (31.7%),  neurologic  events  (16.4%),  neutropenia/febrile 
neutropenia  (15.3%),  cytokine  release  syndrome  (0.5%),  and  tumour  lysis  syndrome  (0.5%).  The 
most  common  adverse  reactions  include:  infusion-related  reactions  (67.2%),  infections  (63.0%), 
pyrexia (59.8%), headache (34.4%), febrile neutropenia (28%), peripheral oedema (25.9%), nausea 
(24.3%),  hypokalaemia  (23.8%),  constipation  (20.6%),  anaemia  (20.1%),  cough  (18.5%),  diarrhoea 
(18.0%), tremor (17.5%), neutropenia (17.5%), abdominal pain (16.9%), insomnia (15.3%), fatigue 
(15.3%)  and  chills  (15.3%).  Events  of  special  interest  (EOI)  for  blinatumomab  included  central 
neuropsychiatric  events  due  to  direct  neurotoxicities  (neurologic  events),  infections,  CRS,  TLS, 
elevated  liver  enzymes,  infusion  reactions,  acute  pancreatitis,  embolic  and  thrombotic  events, 
medication errors and product use issues, cytopenias (including febrile neutropenia and neutropenia), 
lymphopenias,  capillary  leak  syndrome  (CLS),  decreased  immunoglobulins,  and  leukoencephalopathy 
(including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]). 
As the Specific Obligation (SO) of the conditional approval, additional efficacy and safety data for adult 
patients from phase 3 Study 00103311 (Tower) are submitted (variation EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0009). 
The  assessment  is  still  ongoing.  The  completed  TOWER  study  that  was  submitted  as  a  SO  for  the 
Conditional MA in the adult population has a retrospective follow-up for long-term safety and efficacy 
(category  3  in  the  RMP).  It  will  not  bring  information  on  the  paediatric  population  per  se,  but  it 
supports the characterisation of the safety profile of Blincyto in general, which is also relevant for the 
safe use of the product in paediatric patients. 
This variation application is intended to support the use of blinatumomab for the treatment of 
paediatric patients (from 1 month) with R/R ALL. The applicant submitted safety data which are 
provided from 5 studies: pivotal Study MT103-205 and 4 supportive trials: 20130320 (Pediatric and 
adolescent subjects with relapsed/ refractory ALL) AALL1331 (Pediatric (≥ 1 year), adolescent and 
adult (< 31 years) subjects with first relapsed  ALL) 20120215 (Pediatric (age > 28 days to < 18 years) 
with Ph- high risk first relapse B-cell precursor ALL) 20130265 (Pediatric (age < 18 years) with 
relapsed/ refractory B-cell precursor ALL / Adult (age ≥ 18 years) with relapsed/ refractory B-cell 
precursor ALL). 
Patient exposure 
The  safety  analysis  was  primarily  based  on  the  FAS  of  all  subjects  who  received  5-15µg/m2/day  in 
Study  MT103-205  (n=70).  In  addition,  safety  data  from  ongoing  expanded  access  study  20130320 
were analysed (n=19). No formal safety analyses, only preliminary fatal and SAE data were provided

In study MT103-205, blinatumomab was administrated as monotherapy by a cIV infusion at a constant 
daily flow rate over 4 weeks followed by a treatment-free interval of 2 weeks (6W/cycle): 5 µg/m2/day 
for  the  first  week  of  treatment  cycle  1  and  then  escalated  to  15µg/m2/day  for  all  subsequent  cycles 
from the first week of treatment.  
Patients  who  have  achieved  a  CR  within  2  cycles  of  treatment  may  receive  up  to  3  additional 
consolidation cycles of blinatumomab. Instead of consolidation cycles with blinatumomab patients may 
be  withdrawn  from  study  treatment  to  receive  chemotherapy  or  allogeneic  HSCT  at  the  discretion  of

the investigator. Subjects with haematological relapse during their follow-up period could receive up to 
3 additional cycles of blinatumomab (retreatment).  
The core study consisted of a screening period, a treatment period (up to 7.5 months) and an end of 
core study visit 30 days after last dose of study medication. 
The data cut-off date for the primary analysis was 12 January 2015. Safety data during the long-term 
follow-up period and SAE after the long-term fellow-up period (from 25 May 2016 through 28 February 
2017) were also assessed.

70 subjects received at least 1 infusion of blinatumomab at 5-15µg/m2/day (FAS 5-15µg/m2/day). 23 
subjects  (32.9%)  initiated  a  2nd  cycle,  8  subjects  (11.4%)  initiated  C3  and  3  subjects  each  (4.3%) 
initiated  C4  and  C5.  One  subject  who  initially  responded  to  blinatumomab  relapsed  after  at  least  3-
month  response  duration  and  was  retreated.  The  median  duration  of  the  whole  infusion  period  was 
28.00 days (range: 3.4 to 146.4 days). The median number of cycles started was 1.0 (range: 1 to 5 
cycles) and the median number of cycles completed was 1.0 (range: 0 to 5 cycles). 
Treatment was interrupted for 24.3% of subjects (17/70). The most common reasons (n=12, 17.1%) 
for treatment interruption were due to technical reasons, such as pump issues (e.g., air in the line, low 
battery);  and  almost  all  these  interruption  occurred  during  Cycle  1,  except  1  in  C2.  AEs  and  other 
reasons of interruption (e.g., bag empty, paused for blood sampling) were 5.7% for each (n=4).  
Adverse events 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) were defined as adverse events that started between the 
start of the first infusion of blinatumomab (initial treatment or retreatment) and 30 days after the end 
of the last infusion during the study.  Adverse events were graded by the CTCAE, version 4.03.

a Adverse Events are graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 
TEAEs: started between the start of the first infusion of blinatumomab and 30 days after the end of the last infusion during the core 
study, or started between the start of the first infusion of the first retreatment cycle with blinatumomab and 30 days after the end of 
the last infusion of blinatumomab of the last retreatment cycle. Adverse events starting before start of infusion and worsening later 
(after start of infusion) are defined as treatment-emergent adverse events as well. 
The sum of AEs starting before first infusion, TEAEs and AEs starting later than 30 days after infusion is therefore greater than the 
number of all AEs. 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) regardless of causality 
At  5-15µg/m2/day  (n=70),  most  frequently  affected  SOC  (with  subjects  incidence  >10%)  in  MT103-

aPTT = Activated partial thromboplastin time; AST = aspartate aminotransferase;  INR = international normalized ratio; 
TEAE: started between the start of the first infusion of blinatumomab and 30 days after the end of the last infusion during the core 
study, or started between the start of the first infusion of the first retreatment cycle with blinatumomab and 30 days after the end of 
the last infusion of blinatumomab of the last retreatment cycle. AEs starting before start of infusion and worsening later (after start of 
infusion) are defined as treatment emergent adverse event as well. 
The sum of AEs starting before first infusion, TEAE and AE starting later than 30 days after infusion is therefore greater than the 
number of all AE. 
Treatment emergent adverse events of Grade 3 or 4 in severity 
In  FAS  5-15µg/m2/day  (N  =70),  grade  3  and  grade  4  TEAEs  were  31.4%  and  44.3%,  respectively). 
Most frequent (≥5%) Grade 3 TEAE included: anaemia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, hypokalaemia, 
somnolence,  hypertension,  pyrexia,  ALT  increased,  and  AST  increased,  platelet  count  decreased,  and 
WBC  count  decreased.  Most  frequently  reported  Grade  4  TEAE  (≥5%)  included  thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia,  hypokalaemia,  platelet  count  decreased,  neutrophil  count  decreased,  and  WBC  count 
decreased.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  Study  MT103-205,  55.7%  (39/70)  of  subjects  who  received  blinatumomab  at  5-15µg/m2/day 
experienced treatment-emergent SAE regardless of causality with blinatumomab. The common (≥ 5 % 
of subjects) SAE by SOC and PT were: 
- 
Infections  and  Infestations  (21.4%;  15/70);  mainly  due  to  sepsis  (4.3%,  3/70),  device  related 
infection (4.3%, 3/70) and pneumonia (2.9% 2/70) 
-  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions  (17.1%,  12/70);  mainly  due  to  pyrexia 
(11.4%, 8/70) and multi-organ failure (2.9%, 2/70). 
-  Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (11.4%; 8/70), mostly due to Febrile neutropenia (11.4%; 
8/70). 
-  Nervous system disorders (8.6%, 6/70), mostly due to convulsion (2.9%, 2/70) 
-  Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (8.6%, 6/70), mostly due to respiratory failure and 
hypoxia (2.9%, 2/70 of each) 
- 
- 
Immune system disorders (7.1%, 5/70), mostly due to CRS (5.7%, 4/70), 
Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  (7.1%,  5/70),  mainly  due  to  overdose  (4.3%, 
3/70); 
-  Gastrointestinal disorders (5.7%, 4/70) 
The  subject  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  SAE  reported  for  ≥2%  of  subjects  by  preferred  term  is 
presented in table 25.

Treatment emergent adverse event: started between the start of the first infusion of blinatumomab and 30 days after the end of 
the  last  infusion  during  the  core  study,  or  started  between  the  start  of  the  first  infusion  of  the  first  retreatment  cycle  with 
blinatumomab  and  30  days  after  the  end  of  the  last  infusion  of  blinatumomab  of  the  last  retreatment  cycle.    Adverse  events 
starting before start of infusion and worsening later (after start of infusion) are defined as treatment emergent adverse event as 
well. 
Per the investigator’s assessment in this open label uncontrolled study, a total of 15 subjects (21.4%) 
with  SAE  were  considered  related  to  blinatumomab  with  the  highest  incidence  of  CRS  and  pyrexia 
(4/70, 5.7% for each event). 
In expended access study 20130320, through 28 February 2017, a total of 67 SAEs were reported for 
54 subjects. The most frequently reported SAE (more than 1 subject) included pyrexia (n=9; 13.4%), 
acute  lymphocytic  leukemia  (n=7;  10.5%),  CRS,  depressed  level  of  consciousness,  device  related 
sepsis  (n=3  for  each;  4.5%  for  each),  and  C-reactive  protein  increased,  device  related  infection, 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, and sepsis (n=2 for each; 3.0% for 
each). 
Deaths 
In  the  pivotal  Study  MT103-205  Up  to  24  May  2016  (Final  analysis  CSR),  a  total  of  16  subjects 
(22.9%; 16/70) who received 5-15µg/m2/day experienced adverse events that led to death, which is 
similar to death incidence in the overall population regardless of dose regimen (22.6%; 21/93). 
Up to the 12 January 2015 (PA CSR), 11 of 70 subjects (15.7%) experienced AEs that led to death. Of 
these 11 subjects, 8 subjects (11.4%) died on treatment or within 30 days from last infusion (TEAE), 
and 3 subjects died > 30 days from last infusion. During the follow-up (up to 24 May 2016, FA CSR), 5 
subjects  had  fatal  AEs.  One  subject  (1001-010P)  died  as  result  of  a  post-transplant  complication  of 
graft versus  host disease 11 months after the last dose of blinatumomab that was not considered by 
the investigator to be related to blinatumomab.

In  the  overall  population  (n=93),  TEAE  led  death  in  13  subjects;    12  during  the  1st  cycle:  6  deaths 
within 4 to 14 days of treatment initiation and other 6 deaths occurred between days 16 to 49.  
Up to the interim analysis data cut-off date of 20 August 2015, 3 fatal adverse events (15.0%; 3/20) 
were reported in Study 20130320. All 3 deaths were considered due to disease progression. Through 
28 February 2017, an additional 13 fatal AEs were reported. The most frequently reported fatal AE was 
ALL (n= 7).  Two subjects died due to AEs (bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and ALL) that occurred 
within 30 days of the receipt of the last dose of blinatumomab. Of the 13 fatal AEs, 1 event 
(respiratory failure) was considered by the investigator as related to blinatumomab. 
No  fatal  adverse  events  were  reported  for  paediatric  subjects  enrolled  in  Study  AALL1331  up  to 
28.02.17.  Fatal  adverse  events  regardless  of  causality  were  reported  for  4  subjects  in  Study 
20120215.  Of  these  4  subjects,  only  1  subject  received  blinatumomab  and  3  subjects  received  other 
chemotherapy  regimens.  The  subject  who  received  blinatumomab  had  a  fatal  adverse  event  of 
hematophagic histiocytosis approximately 2 months after receiving HSCT and approximately 5 months 
after the last and only dose of blinatumomab treatment. In Study 20130265, 1 death - not considered 
related to blinatumomab.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
CIOMS definition of an AESI was “a noteworthy event for a particular product or class of products that 
may  warrant  careful  monitoring”.  Pre-defined  AESI  for  paediatric  population  included  neurologic 
events, CRS, TLS, infections, infusion reaction, capillary leak syndrome, medication errors, decreased 
immunoglobulins,  elevated  liver  enzymes,  cytopenia,  neutropenia,  and  lymphopenia.  Overall  63 
subjects  (90%)  experienced  at  least  1  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  of  interest,  including  71% 
subjects  with  AESI  ≥  grade  3  and  40%  of  subjects  with  serious  AESI.  Fatal  events  occurred  in  3 
subjects.

Per  protocol,  children  with  the  evidence  for  current CNS  involvement  by  ALL, history  of  relevant  CNS 
pathology  or  current  relevant  CNS  pathology  or  history  of  autoimmune  disease  with  potential  CNS 
involvement or current autoimmune disease, were excluded in Study MT103-205: 
At the dose of 5-15µg/m2/day (N=70), 17 subjects (24.3%) were identified with treatment emergent 
neurologic  events.  The  most  frequently  reported  (≥  5%  of  subjects)  treatment  emergent  neurologic 
event was tremor in 4 subjects (5.7%). Nine (12.9%) subjects were identified with neurologic events 
that  were  considered  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  treatment,  with  the  most  frequently  reported 
events  of  dizziness  and  tremor  (for  n=3,  4.3%  subjects  each).  Serious  neurologic  events  were 
identified for 5 subjects (7.1%), with convulsion as the most frequently reported event for 2 subjects; 
confusional state, atonic seizure, and neuralgia were reported for 1 subject each, and 3 of them were 
considered by the investigator as related to treatment (convulsion for 2 subjects; atonic seizure for 1 
subject).  Two  subjects  had  neurologic  events  (convulsion  and  atonic  seizure  for  1  subject  each)  that 
led  to  treatment  interruption,  and  no  subjects  had  neurologic  events  that  led  to  treatment 
discontinuation. The median time to onset of first neurologic event of any grade was 8 days (Q1, Q3: 
3, 23 days) across cycles. Using Kaplan Meier analysis, the median duration of neurologic events was 
5.0  days  (95%  CI:  1  to  24  days).    Of  the  17  subjects  who  were  identified  with  neurologic  events, 
events resolved for 14 subjects (14/17; 82.4%). The median duration of events that resolved was 3.5 
days (quartile 1 [Q1], quartile 3 [Q3]: 1 to 20 days).  
The  subject  incidence  of  grade  ≥  3  neurologic  events  was  5.7%,  with  somnolence  reported  for  2 
subjects  (2.9%);  all  other  events  were  reported  for  1  subject  each.  No  subjects  were  identified  as 
having fatal neurologic events.  
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
In  70  subjects  who  received  5-15µg/mg/day,  8  subjects  (11.4%)  experienced  a  CRS,  all  related  to 
treatment  and  events  resolved  for  7  subjects  (7/8;  87.5%)  with  a  median  duration  of  events  that 
resolved of 5 days (Q1, Q3:  4 to 9 days). The median time to onset of first CRS events of any grade 
was 2.5 days (Q1, Q3: 2, 6.5 days) across cycles; all CRS events occurred within the first 10 days of 
cycle 1. 
No CRS events were fatal. Four subjects (5.7%) were identified with treatment emergent serious CRS 
events,  2  CRS  events  each  led  to  treatment  interruption  and  discontinuation.  Four  subjects  (5.7%) 
were identified with grade ≥ 3 CRS events.  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
No subject in the FAS 5-15µg/m2/day had reported TLS. 
Infections 
In  5-15µg/m2/day  FAS,  (N=  70),  35  subjects  (50.0%)  had  at  least  1  Infection,  some  of  which  were 
life-threatening.  The  most  frequently  reported  (≥5%  of  subjects)  treatment  emergent  infection  was 
rhinitis  (10.0%).  Three  subjects  (4.3%)  experienced  signs  and  symptoms  of  infections  that  were 
considered by investigator as related to treatment: metapneumovirus infection, micrococcus infection, 
and  sweating  fever  in  1  subject  each.  Serious  treatment-emergent  infections  were  reported  for  15 
subjects  (21.4%),  with  sepsis  and  device-related  infection  as  the  most  frequently  reported  infections 
(4.3%,  n=3  for  each).  Sepsis  led  to  study  drug  interruption  for  1  subject  and  fungal  infection  led  to 
treatment discontinuation for 1 subject.  
Assessment report  
EMA/561153/2018  
Page 90/115 
 
 
 
 
 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  first  infection  of  any  grade  was  16  days  (Q1,  Q3:  7,  30  days)  across 
cycles.  Of  the  35  subjects  who  experienced  infections  of  any  grade,  events  resolved  for  27  subjects 
(27/35; 77.1%). The median duration of events that resolved was 9.0 days (Q1, Q3:  3 to 22 days).  
Eighteen  subjects  (25.7%)  experienced  grade  ≥  3  treatment-emergent  infections  with  device  related 
infections and sepsis (4.3% for each) and pneumonia (2.9%) as most common events (≥2%).  
Two  subjects  experienced  fatal  infections  (sepsis  and  fungal  infection  for  1subject  each),  neither  of 
which was considered by the investigator as related to treatment.  
Infusion reactions 
The  incidence  of  acute  infusion  reaction  events  (onset  within  48h  of  blinatumomab  infusion  without 
consideration of duration) was 65.7% (46/70) of subjects in the 5-15 µg/m2/day FAS, principally (≥ 3 
subjects) due to pyrexia (61.4%; 43/70), hypertension (11.4%; 8/70), and CRS (5.7%; 4/70). A total 
of 54.3% (38/70) of subjects had infusion reactions that were considered by the investigator as related 
to treatment. 
Ten subjects (14.3%; 10/70) had an infusion reaction ≥ grade 3, and events resolved for 9 subjects. 
Only pyrexia occurred in more than 1 subject (11.4%; 8/70). Serious infusion reactions were reported 
for 3 subjects (4.3%; 3/70): pyrexia in 2 subjects (2.9%; 2/70) and CRS in 1 subject (1.4%; 1/70); 
all related to treatment. No fatal infusion reaction was reported. 
Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) 
2 subjects in the 5-15µg/m2/day (2.9%, 2/70) experienced capillary leak syndrome which were both 
related  to  blinatumomab.  Both  were  not  severe  (<3  grade)  and  did  not  lead  treatment  interruption. 
There were no serious or fatal CLS. The median time to onset of CLS was 26.5 days (Q1, Q3: 2, 51d). 
Medication errors 
Overall 4 subjects (4.3%, 4/93) experienced overdose (3 subjects at 5-15µg/m2/day and 1 subject at 
5  µg/m2/day)  due  to  administration  error  and  pump  malfunction  (2  for  each).  Per  protocol,  all  were 
considered serious. They were not severe (≥ grade 3) or fatal and all events were resolved. 
Decreased immunoglobulins 
At  5-15µg/m2/day,  decreased 
immunoglobulins  occurred 
in  5 
subjects 
(7.1%,  5/70: 
hypoglobulinaemia,  hypogammaglobulinemia,  blood  IgG,  IgM  and  immunoglobulins  decreased,  1  for 
each). The median time to onset was 29.0 days (Q0, Q3: 29, 50 days). There were no serious or fatal 
events,  or  treatment  interruption  due  to  decreased  Ig.  Only  1  subject  with  hypogammaglobulinemia 
was ≥grade 3.  
Elevated liver enzymes 
At  5-15µg/m2/day,  elevated  liver  enzyme  TEAEs  were  identified  for  22  subjects  (31.4%),  mostly  (≥ 
5%)  due  to  ALT  increased  (18.6%,  13/70),  AST  increased  (14.3%,  10/70),  and  blood  bilirubin 
increased  (5.7%,  4/70),  with  the  median  time  to  onset  of  2.0  days  (Q1,  Q3:  2,  10  days).  14  of  22 
subjects were considered as related to treatment. 
There  were  no  serious  or  fatal  elevated  liver  enzyme  TEAE.  There  were  treatment  interruption  or 
discontinuation due to elevated liver enzyme events. Elevated liver enzyme events resolved for 15 of 
22 subjects (68.2%). The median duration of resolved events was 22.0 days (Q1, Q3:  8 to 43 days).  
Assessment report  
EMA/561153/2018  
Page 91/115 
 
 
 
 
 
The  subject  incidence  of  grade  ≥  3  elevated  liver  enzyme  events  was  17.1%  (12/70),  including  ALT 
increased  (15.7%,  11/70),  AST  increased  (11.4%,  8/70),  blood  bilirubin  increased  (4.3%,  3/70)  and 
Gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (2.9%, 2/70).  
For  the  overall  population,  an  analysis  of  the  potential  Hy’s  Law  cases  were  performed  and  none  of 
them were confirmed.  
Cytopenia, Neutropenia and Lymphopenia 
Cytopenia events were reported in 54.3% (38/70) of subject, mostly due to (≥5%) thrombocytopenia 
(21.4%,  15/70),  febrile  neutropenia  (20.0%,  14/70),  neutropenia  (17.1%,  12/70),  platelet  count 
decreased  (14.3%,  10/70),  leukopenia  and  neutrophil  count  decreased  (12.9%,  9/70  for  each),  and 
WBC count decreased (11.4%, 8/70). The median time to onset of cytopenias was 2.5 days (Q1, Q3: 
2,  8  days).  Of  the  38  subjects  who  were  identified  with  cytopenias,  events  resolved  for  33  subjects 
(33/38; 86.8%). The median duration of events that resolved was 14 days (Q1, Q3: 8 to 32 days). The 
incidence of cytopenia ≥grade 3 was also 54.3%. 
Serious  cytopenia  events  were  reported  for  8  subjects  (11.4%):  serious  febrile  neutropenia  in  all  8 
subjects and serious thrombocytopenia in 1 subject. Of those 8 subjects, 7 subjects recovered and one 
subject had a fatal thrombocytopenia which the investigator considered not related to study treatment.  
Neutropenia  was  reported  in  a  total  of  32  subjects  (45.7%)  including  febrile  neutropenia  (20.0%, 
14/70), neutropenia (17.1%, 12/70) and neutrophil count decreased (12.9%, 9/70); all were ≥grade 3 
except 2 subjects with febrile neutropenia. Study drug treatment was interrupted for 1 subject with a 
grade  4,  non  serious  event  of  febrile  neutropenia.  Serious  neutropenia  was  reported  in  8  subjects 
(11.4%), all were febrile neutropenia, 7 subjects recovered and there was no fatal neutropenia event.  
Lymphopenia occurred in 5.7% of subjects (4/70) including lymphocyte count decreased (4.3%, 3/70) 
and  1  case  of  lymphopenia  (1.4%).  All  were  ≥grade  3  except  1  subject  with  lymphocyte  count 
decreased.  No  serious  or 
fatal 
lymphopenia  was  reported.  No  event 
led 
to 
treatment 
interruption/discontinuation. 
Leukoencephalopathy 
No events of leukoencephalopathy were reported in Study MT103-205. 
Pancreatitis 
No events of pancreatitis were reported in Study MT103-205. 
Laboratory findings 
Alanine aminotransferase: In the FAS 5-15µg/m2/day, 18.6% (13/70) of subjects had ALT increased 
TEAE. There was an increased incidence of grade 3 (≥5xULN) from 2.9% [2/70] to 32.9% [23/70] and 
grade 4 (≥20xULN) from 0% to 2.9% [2/70]).  
Aspartate aminotransferase: 14.3% (10/70) of subjects had ALT increased TEAE. Median increases in 
ALT levels were most notable within the first 3 days of C1. There was an increased incidence of grade 
3 (≥5xULN) from 0% to 14.3% [10/70] and grade 4 (≥20xULN) from 0% to 1.4% [1/70]).  
Alkaline phosphatase: No subjects who received 5-15µg/m2/day had alkaline phosphatase increased 
that met the criteria for an AE.

Bilirubin: 4 of 70 subjects (5.7%) who received 5-15µg/m2/day had bilirubin increased that met the 
criteria for AE. There was an increased incidence of grade 3 (> 3xULN to 10xULN) from 0% to 8.6% 
[6/70]; no grade 4 total bilirubin values (>10xULN) or grade 5 were reported. 
Potassium, Albumin and Calcium: The median changes in potassium, albumin and calcium 
concentrations from baseline to the end of cycle 1 and cycles 2 were small, and their median 
concentrations remained relatively stable from baseline to the end of core study.  
Haemoglobin:  In  5-15µg/m2/day  FAS,  the  median  changes  in  haemoglobin  concentrations  from 
baseline to the end of cycle 1, cycles 2 and core study were -2.0g/L, 7.5g/L and 1.5g/L respectively. 
There was an increased incidence of grade 3 (65- <80g/L) from 2.9% [2/70] to 52.9% [37/70]), and 
grade 4 (<65g/g/L) from 2.9% [2/70] to 11.4% [8/70] haemoglobin values. 
Platelets Count: the overall pattern suggests there were decreases in platelet concentrations within the 
first  8  days  of  cycle  1;  increases  in  platelet  concentrations  were  noted  from  the  start  of  the  second 
cycle and returning toward baseline by the end of the core study.  
White  blood  cells:  median  minimum  WBC  counts  decreased  from  baseline  by  approximately  50% 
within the first 3 days of blinatumomab treatment, and returned toward baseline values by the end of 
cycle 1.  
Lymphocytes:  In  the  overall  population  and  at  the  proposed  registrational  dose  regimen,  median 
minimum  absolute  lymphocyte  counts  decreased  markedly  from  baseline  during  day  2  and  day  3  of 
each cycle, then returning toward based by the end of each cycle and the core study. 
Neutrophils: At the proposed registrational dose regimen for subjects who had neutrophil values (N= 
68), the baseline median minimum absolute neutrophil counts was 1.285 x 109/L (range:  0.0 to 
12.045 x 109/L) with the median changes from baseline to the end of cycle 1, cycle 2, and the core 
study of  -0.355 x 109/L, 0.310 x 109/L, and -0.580 x 109/L, respectively. The overall pattern 
suggests there were decreased in absolute neutrophil concentrations starting at day 2 through the end 
of cycle 1, then marked increases starting on day 1 of cycle 2 through the end of cycle 5. 
Immunoglobulins: No new safety signal was observed in the paediatric population with respect to 
immunoglobulin laboratory evaluations. 
Vital Signs: Changes in systolic blood pressure (decrease) and heart rate (increase) were seen during 
the initial infusion as expected. No new safety signal was observed in the paediatric population with 
respect to vital sign evaluations.    
ECGs: In the overall population for Study MT103-205 (N= 93), 11 subjects (11.8%) were identified 
applying the Cardiac Arrhythmias SMQ (narrow search): 7 subjects (7.5%) experienced sinus 
tachycardia; 6 subjects (6.5%) experienced sinus bradycardia, and 1 subject (1.1%) experienced a 
grade 2 QT prolongation which was non-serious and not considered by the investigator as related to 
the treatment.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Treatment Interruption and due to Adverse Events 
In subjects who received 5-15µg/m2/day, TEAE led treatment interruption regardless if relationship to 
blinatumomab occurred in 14.3% (10/70) of subjects. The maximum severity (≥ grade 3) of TEAEs 
leading to treatment interruption regardless of relationship to blinatumomab were: grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia, grade 4 sepsis, grade 4 pyrexia and grade 3 drug hypersensitivity in 1 subject each; and 
grade 3 CRS in 2 subjects.   
Treatment Discontinuation due to Adverse Events 
In subjects who received 5-15 µg/m2/day, the percentage of TEAEs leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation regardless of relationship to blinatumomab was 5.7% (4/70). The maximum severity 
(≥ grade 3) of TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation regardless of relationship to blinatumomab 
were as follows (Listing 16-02-007-04-02): grade 5 fungal infection in 1 subject, grade 5 multi-organ 
failure, grade 4 cytokine release syndrome in 1 subject and grade 3 cytokine release syndrome in 1 
subject. 
Post marketing experience 
Blinatumomab  was  first  approved  on  03  December  2014  in  the  United  States.    As  of  02  December 
2016,  an  estimated  2236  patients  have  been  exposed  to  blinatumomab  in  the  marketed  setting 
through early access programs and commercial distribution. Of these, an estimated 196 patients were 
paediatric (< 18 years of age).A total of 452 events were reported in 174 paediatric cases in the post-
marketing setting.

The most frequently reported events (≥ 1% event incidence) were off label use (55 events, 12.2%); 
pyrexia (38 events, 8.4%); CRS (11 events, 2.4%); seizure (9 events, 2.0%); ALL and drug ineffective 
(8 events, 1.8% each); ALL recurrent and disease progression (7 events, 1.6% each); death, malignant 
neoplasm progression, and respiratory failure (6 events, 1.3% each); drug resistance, febrile 
neutropenia, headache, hypotension, therapy nonresponder, and vomiting (5 events, 1.1% each). 
These events are consistent with the known safety profile of blinatumomab or representative of the 
underlying malignancy. No new safety signals were identified based on a review of the paediatric cases 
received in the post-marketing setting. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  posology  for  patients  <45kg,  which  is  independent  of  age,  was  proposed  based  on  efficacy  and 
safety data from the paediatric pivotal study MT103-205. This weight cut-off is acceptable, considering 
that  in  general  most  of  subjects  <45kg  are  younger  than  18  years  of  age.  A  comparison  of  safety 
profile between paediatric and adult patients was performed.  
70  subjects  who  received  the  proposed  registrational  regimen  (5-15µg/m2/day,  6w/cycle)  in  the 
pivotal  study  of  MT103-205  was  the  focus  of  the  safety  assessment  as  both  studied  population  and 
treatment regimen in 2 phase 3 supportive studies were different from those of pivotal study MT103-
205. In  supportive study AALL1331: a phase 3, risk stratified, randomized study for subjects who are 
≥ 1 year to < 31 years of age with first relapse ALL to test whether incorporation of blinatumomab into 
the treatment of patients with childhood B cell ALL at first relapse will improve DFS (primary endpoint). 
Blinatumomab  was  administrated  at  15µg/m2/day  5W/cycle  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  as 
consolidation  therapy.  Further,  in  supportive  study  20120215:  a  phase  3  randomized,  open-label, 
controlled  multicenter  adaptive  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of  1  cycle  of 
blinatumomab (15µg/m2/day 5W/cycle) versus an intensive standard late consolidation chemotherapy 
course  in  paediatric  subjects  with  high  risk  first  relapse  ALL.  Regarding  the  expanded  access  study 
20130320 (n=19), although the dose regimen and population of this supportive study were similar to 
those of pivotal study, the schedule of visits/ safety assessments was much less frequent compared to 
pivotal  study.  The  study  20130265  is  a  phase  1b/2  Japanese  study  to  evaluate  safety,  PK/PD  of 
blinatumomab  in  adult  and  paediatric  Japanese  subjects  with  R/R  B-cell  precursor  ALL.  The  dosing 
regimen  for  paediatric  part  was  very  different  from  the  proposed  registrational  regimen  (3.75  or 
5µg/m2/day – 7, 10 or 15µg/m2/day).  
Taken together, the differences in treatment regimen, assessment schedule and population could have 
important  impact  on  the  incidence  and  severity  of  safety  profile,  especially  based  on  a  phase  1/2b 
uncontrolled,  single  arm,  open-label  pivotal  study  with  small  sample  size.  The  weakness  in  study 
design of the unique pivotal study makes further delicate to conclusively assess whether blinatumomab 
has  altered  or  increased  the  intensity,  frequency  or  distribution  of  any  safety  events  in  paediatric 
subjects  and  emphasizes  the  importance  to  focus  on  a  relevant,  representative  and  homogenous 
population  for  safety  analysis.  Therefore,  any  pooling  of  data  from  pivotal  study  with  those  from 
informal  analyses  of  ongoing  supportive  studies  may  hugely  increase  the  risk  of  assessment  bias, 
“dilute”  the  safety  events  for  the  particularly  target  population  and  leave  open  the  possibility  of  a 
biasing  results  which  would  appear  more  favourable.  The  FAS  5-15µg/m2/d  of  MT103-205  (n=70 
subjects who received the proposed registrational regimen at 5-15µg/m2/day, 6w/cycle) was the focus 
of the safety assessment, and consists of the safety population for the SmPC update. 
70 subjects received at least 1 infusion of blinatumomab at 5-15µg/m2/day (FAS 5-15µg/m2/day). 23 
subjects  (32.9%)  initiated  a  2nd  cycle,  8  subjects  (11.4%)  initiated  C3  and  3  subjects  each  (4.3%) 
initiated C4 and C5. The median duration of the whole infusion period was 28.00 days (range: 3.4 to 
Assessment report  
EMA/561153/2018  
Page 96/115 
 
 
 
 
 
146.4  days).  Treatment  was  interrupted  for  17  of  them  (24.3%).  This  overall  rate  of  treatment 
interruption observed in paediatric patients was much lower compared to adult patients in initial pivotal 
study  MT103-211  (treatment  interruption  and  premature  termination  due  to  any  cause  were  68.3% 
and 51.3% of subjects respectively). Interruptions due to AE were also less frequent in children than in 
adults (5.7% vs 24.8% in Study MT103-211), suggesting that tolerability of blinatumomab in children 
was not worse than in adult patients.  
All paediatric subjects (100%) experienced at least 1 TEAE. The subject incidence of grade ≥ 3 TEAE 
was 87.1%, similar to that observed in adult subjects with R/R ALL (82.0%). SAEs  were reported for 
55.7% of paediatric subjects, lower than in adult patients (64.0%). AEs leading to death were reported 
for  11  of  70  (15.7%) paediatric patients.  Fatal  TEAE  were  reported  in  8 paediatric  subjects  (11.4%), 
which were comparable with those in adult patients (14.8%).  
TEAE led drug interruption and discontinuation in 14.3% and 5.7% of paediatric subjects respectively, 
which  were  much  lower  than  in  adult  patients  with  R/R  ALL  (33.3%  and  18.0%,  respectively).  The 
subject incidence of treatment related AE was similar between paediatric and adult patients (84.3% vs 
87.8%). 
Overall, the global safety profile of blinatumomab in paediatric patients seems consistent with that of 
adult patients, and it appears in some case less severe and better tolerable than in adult patients.  
The overall TEAE profile in children was consistent with a population of subjects with R/R ALL who were 
heavily  pre-treated  (e.g.  toxicities  related  to  disease  burden  such  as  the  importance  of  peripheral 
blasts  at  the  initiation  of  the  treatment  by  blinatumomab,  toxicities  of  heavy  previous  anti-tumour 
treatment  in  particular  HSCT,  duration  of  aplasia  and  chemotherapy-causing  infection,  bleeding) 
Similar to adult patients, two highest affected SOC for paediatric patients were General disorders and 
administration  site  conditions  (91.4%)  and  Gastrointestinal  disorders  45  (64.3%).  Nervous  System 
Disorders  and  Infection/infestations  were  both  SOC  less  frequently  affected  in  paediatric  MT103-205 
than in adult MT103-211 (48.6% vs 63.5%, 50.0% vs 63.0% respectively); while Investigations were 
more frequently affected in children than in adult patients with R/R ALL (61.4% vs 48.1%). 
TEAEs  ≥  grade  3  were  reported  in  87.1%  (61/70)  of  subjects  and  the  most  affected  SOC  was  Blood 
and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  (54.3%,  38/70).  The  overall  the  type  and  frequencies  of  grade  ≥3 
TEAE seem consistent with a population of subjects with ALL with a poor prognosis who were heavily 
pre-treated.  Most  frequent  (≥5%)  Grade  3  TEAE  included:  anaemia,  febrile  neutropenia,  leukopenia, 
hypokalaemia,  somnolence,  hypertension,  pyrexia,  ALT  increased,  and  AST  increased,  platelet  count 
decreased, and WBC count decreased.  
The  majority  of  subjects  in  the  FAS  5-15µg/m2/day  experienced  treatment  related  AE  (84.3%)  with 
the  highest  incidence  of  SOC  of  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions  (61.4%).  The 
most  frequently  reported treatment  related  AE  (≥10%)  included  pyrexia  (61.4%),  anaemia  (17.1%), 
ALT 
increased 
(14.3%), 
febrile  neutropenia 
(12.9%),  nausea 
(12.9%),  CRS 
(11.4%), 
hypophosphatemia  (11.4%),  AST  increased  (10.0%),  neutrophil  count  decreased  (10.0%),  platelet 
count decreased (10.0%) and WBC count decreased (10.0%).  
In this phase1/2 study, the specific safety profile of blinatumomab (causality) in paediatric subjects is 
difficult  to  assess  in  a  clinical  relevant  way  because,  on  the  one  hand  there  is  a  high  risk  of 
investigator’s  bias  in  the  judgment  of  treatment-related  TEAE  due  to  open-label  design,  and  on  the 
other  hand  the  majority  of  toxicities  (e.g.  general  disorders,  haematological  and  gastrointestinal 
toxicities,  infections  and  infestations…)  are  commonly  related  to  underlying  malignancy,  disease 
burden or prior anti-tumor therapy.

55.7%  (39/70)  of  subjects  who  received  blinatumomab  at  5-15µg/m2/day  experienced  treatment-
emergent  SAE  regardless  of  causality  with  blinatumomab,  slightly  lower  than  those  reported  in  adult 
pivotal  Study  MT103-211  (55.7%  versus  64.0%).  The  common  (≥  5  %  of  subjects)  SAEs  include: 
Infections  and  Infestations  (21.4%;  15/70);  mainly  due  to  sepsis  (4.3%,  3/70),  device  related 
infection  (4.3%,  3/70)  and  pneumonia  (2.9%  2/70);  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site 
Conditions  (17.1%,  12/70);  mainly  due  to  pyrexia  (11.4%,  8/70)  and  multi-organ  failure  (2.9%, 
2/70);  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  (11.4%;  8/70),  mostly  due  to  Febrile  neutropenia 
(11.4%;  8/70);  Nervous  system  disorders  (8.6%,  6/70),  mostly  due  to  convulsion  (2.9%,  2/70); 
Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (8.6%,  6/70),  mostly  due  to  respiratory  failure  and 
hypoxia  (2.9%,  2/70  of  each);  Immune  system  disorders  (7.1%,  5/70),  mostly  due  to  CRS  (5.7%, 
4/70),  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  (7.1%,  5/70),  mainly  due  to  overdose  (4.3%, 
3/70); Gastrointestinal disorders (5.7%, 4/70) 
The common SAE (occurred in at least 3 subjects were pyrexia (n=8, 11.4%), fibril neutropenia (n=8, 
11.4%),  CRS  (n=4,  5.7%),  sepsis,  device-related  infection  and  overdose  (n=3,  4.3%  for  each).  The 
type  of  SAE  were  globally  consistent  with  a  population  of  subjects  with  ALL  who  were  heavily  pre-
treated  with  a  poor  prognosis.  As  compared  to  adult  patients  (Study  MT103-211),  overall  serious 
infections  and  infestations  events  (21.4%  vs  31.7%)  and  serious  neurologic  or  psychiatric  events 
(10.0% vs 19.5%) were lower for children than in adult patients.  
It  is  noted  that  serious  CRS  (5.7%  vs  0.5%)  and  serious  respiratory  disorders  events  (8.6%  versus 
2.1%)  were  more  frequently  reported  in  MT103-205  than  in  adult  MT103-211.  These  events  are 
serious and could be life-threatening, and are included in the SmPC.  
On  the  data  cut-off  date  of  24  May  2016,  a  total  of  48  subjects  (68.6%,  48/70)  in  the  FAS  5-
15µg/m2/day ended the study due to death. The mortality observed in this population with late stage 
high  risk  R/R  and  heavily  pre-treated  ALL  is  not  unexpected.  In  the  overall  population  of  this  pivotal 
study  (n=93),  the  highest  cause  of  death  was  respiratory  failure  (3.2%,  3/93),  two  among  three 
deaths were judged related to blinatumomab by investigator: A 2-year-old boy received 15µg/m2/day 
and  died  on  day  7  after  the  start  of  blinatumomab  infusion.  The  cause  of  his  death  was  fatal 
respiratory  failure due  to ascending  paralysis/hypotonia,  which  was  considered  by  the investigator  as 
related to neurological toxicity of blinatumomab. Another fatal case of respiratory failure was reported 
in  expended  access  Study  20130320  and  considered  also  as  related  to  blinatumomab  by  the 
investigator.   
Reported  serious  respiratory  disorders  included  respiratory  failure  (6.5%,  6/93),  hypoxia  (3.2%, 
3/93), atelectasis, cough, dyspnoea, pneumonitis, pleural effusion and epistaxis (1.1% 1/93 for each) 
in overall population of MT103-205 (n=93).  
The  historical  studies  submitted  as  supportive  for  the  efficacy  historical  control  analysed  overall 
survival, but not early fatal AE. Thus they do not contribute to safety analysis. 
Pre-defined  AESI  for  pediatric  population  included  neurologic  events,  CRS,  TLS,  infections,  infusion 
reaction,  capillary  leak  syndrome,  medication  errors,  decreased  immunoglobulins,  elevated  liver 
enzymes, cytopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia. Overall 63 subjects (90%) experienced at least 1 
treatment-emergent adverse event of interest, including 71% subjects with AESI ≥ grade 3 and 40% 
of subjects with serious AESI. Fatal events occurred in 3 subjects.  
In FAS 5-15µg/mg/day, the neurologic events appear less common (24.3% vs 52.9%) and less serious 
(7.1%  vs  16.9%)  in  pediatric  population  than  in  adult  MT103-211.  Types  of  these  events  were  quite 
variable  and  represented  24  different  preferred  terms  (PT),  with  only  tremor  occurred  in  ≥5%  of 
subjects  (n=4,  5.7%).  Encephalopathy  was  reported  in  1  subject,  and  none  of  neurological  AESI  led

treatment discontinuation or death. Overall, neurologic toxicity does not present a new safety signal in 
the pediatric population, and risk mitigating measures regarding neurological reactions are considered 
adequate. 
8  subjects  (11.4%)  experienced  a  CRS,  events  resolved  for  7  subjects  (7/8;  87.5%)  with  a  median 
duration  of  events  that  resolved  of  5  days  (Q1,  Q3:  4  to  9  days).  CRS  appears  manageable  at  the 
proposed dosing regimen for paediatric population. However, serious CRS (5.7% vs 0.5%) were more 
frequently reported in paediatric children than in adult (MT103-211), probably due to more important 
tumor burden at the initiation of treatment in children than in adults. Majority of children experienced 
at least 1 event of infusion reaction within 48h of infusion (65.7%, 46/70) and over half (54.3%) were 
considered  related  to  blinatumomab.  Infusion  reaction  for  paediatric  patients  appear  more  frequent 
(65.7%  vs  28.6%)  and  more  severe  as  compared  to  adults  patients  in  Study  MT103-211  (14.3%  vs 
3.7% ≥ grade 3). Increased risk of CRS and infusion reaction for paediatric subjects is reflected in the 
SmPC section 4.4. as well as pre-medication recommendations included in SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4. 
Patients  with  ALL  are  immunocompromised  and  consequently  at  increased  risk  for  serious  infections. 
The  incidence  of  infections  in  paediatric  patients  appears  to  be  slightly  less  frequent  than  in  adult 
MT103-211  (50.0%  vs  64.6%).  Considering  the  mechanism  of  action  of  blinatumomab  (e.g. 
hypogammaglobulinemia)  and  the  studied  population,  the  risk  of  infections  is  not  worse  than  that 
expected. 
2  subjects  (2.9%,  2/70)  experienced  CLS  which  were  both  related  to  blinatumomab.  Both  were  not 
severe (<3 grade) and did not lead treatment interruption. 
Treatment  with  blinatumomab  was  associated  with  transient  elevations  in  liver  enzymes  in  a  third  of 
subjects. The majority of these events were observed within the first week of blinatumomab initiation 
and  did  not  require  blinatumomab  interruption  or  discontinuation.  Although  the  rate  of  ≥  3  grade 
elevated  liver  enzyme  events  was  high  (17.1%),  there  were  no  potential  Hy’s  Law  cases  or 
serious/fatal elevated liver enzyme events. This hepatic safety profile of blinatumomab is comparable 
to that for adult patients. 
Cytopenia events were reported in 54.3% (38/70) of subject, mostly due to (≥5%) thrombocytopenia 
(21.4%,  15/70),  febrile  neutropenia  (20.0%,  14/70),  neutropenia  (17.1%,  12/70),  platelet  count 
decreased  (14.3%,  10/70),  leukopenia  and  neutrophil  count  decreased  (12.9%,  9/70  for  each),  and 
WBC  count  decreased  (11.4%,  8/70).  Grade  3  or  4  decreases  in  neutrophils  and  platelets  were 
common,  which  are  expected  in  this  target  population  and  the  incidences  are  not  more  than  those 
observed in adult patients. 
No events of Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS), Leukoencephalopathy, Pancreatitis were reported in Study 
MT103-205. 
The  subject  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  SAEs  was  higher  for  infants  (70.0%)  compared  with 
children  (52.5%)  and  adolescents  (55.0%).  However,  due  to  the  small  size  of  infant  subgroup  and 
imbalance  in  the  number  of  subjects  enrolled  in  each  age  group,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  individual 
adverse  events  differences  by  age.  No  children  under  7  months  of  age  were  enrolled,  safety  data  of 
blinatumomab in infant (1-6 months of age) were thus missing.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There were no new safety signal reported in paediatric pivotal study as compared to adverse reactions 
of Blincyto identified in adult patients.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Philadelphia chromosome negative B-cell precursor ALL in paediatric patients aged 1 year or older 
which is refractory or in relapse after receiving at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving 
prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and when other treatment options are not 
considered suitable. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The subject population in Study MT103-205 reflects one in advance stage with a very poor prognosis: 
57.1% had prior alloHSCT and 55.7% were refractory to their most recent regimen before entering the 
study. 74.3% of subjects had bone marrow blasts ≥ 50% at baseline based on central laboratory 
assessments. 52.8% had 2 or more prior relapses, 71% had relapsed <6 months prior to the start of 
blinatumomab. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  efficacy  evaluation  of  blinatumomab  in  paediatric  R/R  ALL  is  based  primary  on  data  from  Study 
MT103-205,  a  phase  1/2  study  in  70  children  who  were  exposed  to  blinatumomab  at  the  proposed 
registrational  dose  of  5-15µg/m2/day.  Supportive  efficacy  results  are  provided  from  an  interim 
analysis  of  20  of  an  estimated  80  subjects  in  the  ongoing,  single-arm,  open-label,  expanded  access

The primary efficacy population (5-15 µg/m2/day FAS) consisted of a total of 70 subjects treated at 5-
15  µg/m2/day  including  26  patients  from  the  phase  1  and  44  patients  from  the  phase  2.  The  FAS 
included 10 infants (7 months to 2 years), 20 children (2-12 years) and 40 adolescents (7-17 years). 
The median age was 8.0 years (range: 0 to 17 years). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
CRc + CRh* rate within the first 2 cycles was 32.9%, including 12 subjects (17.1%) achieved CR with 
full  recovery.  In  addition  with  PR  (5.7%),  the  response  rate  within  the  first  2  cycles  for  the  5-15 
µg/m²/day FAS was 39.6%.  
Although the small number of subjects in some subgroups limit comparisons, it is impressive that the 
CR  rates  were  still  high  even  in  subpopulation  with  very  poor  prognostic  such  as  subjects  with  post-
alloHSCT relapse (CR 47.5%), with refractory ALL (30.8%) and also in infants <2 years of age (60%). 
These results are impressive especially in this advanced paediatric ALL with a particular poor prognosis 
and few effective standard treatment options. 
More  than  half  of  subjects  (57.1%  40/70)  had  already  received  prior  HSCT.  In  this  later-line  setting, 
there  were  still  one-third  (35.7%,  25/70)  of  subjects  became  eligible  and  received  an  alloHSCT.  In 
particular,  almost  a  half  of  subjects  who  achieved  a  CRc,  CRh*  or  CR3  (48.1%,  13/27),  have 
proceeded to alloHSCT while in remission and 8 of them (29.6%, 8/27) received alloHSCT without any 
other  subsequent  anti-leukemic  medications.  Such  rate  of  HSCT  is  considered  encouraging  in  the 
targeted population, in whom the treatment goal is cure by alloHSCT as a consolidation therapy after 
achieving  CR.  The  rate  of  transplantation  was  highest  during  the  1  to  3  month  interval  following 
treatment by blinatumomab, an interval necessary to find a donor and prepare the transplantation. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The place of alloHSCT, the only curative approach for R/R ALL, is particularly important for children 
with second or greater relapse. As largely discussed in the assessment of Blincyto in adult R/R ALL 
(EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0009), although impressive rate of CR quickly achieved (< 2 cycles of Blincyto) 
and high rate of alloHSCT in heavily treated children, the real gains in OS with alloHSCT after induction 
by Blincyto are unknown.  
Results from the post-authorisation registry study 20130320 will be helpful to characterize long term 
efficacy and HSCT outcomes after induction (see RMP). Results from Study 20180130 (see Annex II) 
will provide follow-up information for pediatric high-risk patients undergoing HSCT enrolled in 
Study 20120215. Currently, only interim results from Study 20130320 are included in II-18 and 
further follow-up is expected to be submitted in the future (category 3 in the RMP). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The majority of subjects in the FAS 5-15µg/m2/day experienced treatment related AE (84.3%) with 
the highest incidence of SOC of General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (61.4%). The 
most frequently reported treatment related AE (≥10%) included pyrexia (61.4%), anaemia (17.1%), 
ALT increased (14.3%), febrile neutropenia (12.9%), nausea (12.9%), CRS (11.4%), 
hypophosphatemia (11.4%), AST increased (10.0%), neutrophil count decreased (10.0%), platelet 
count decreased (10.0%) and WBC count decreased (10.0%).  
In this phase1/2 study, 55.7% (39/70) of subjects who received blinatumomab at 5-15µg/m2/day 
experienced treatment-emergent SAE regardless of causality with blinatumomab, slightly lower than

those reported in adult pivotal Study MT103-211 (55.7% versus 64.0%). The common (≥ 5 % of 
subjects) SAEs include: Infections and Infestations (21.4%; 15/70); mainly due to sepsis (4.3%, 
3/70), device related infection (4.3%, 3/70) and pneumonia (2.9% 2/70); General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions (17.1%, 12/70); mainly due to pyrexia (11.4%, 8/70) and multi-organ 
failure (2.9%, 2/70); Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (11.4%; 8/70), mostly due to Febrile 
neutropenia (11.4%; 8/70);   Nervous system disorders (8.6%, 6/70), mostly due to convulsion 
(2.9%, 2/70); Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (8.6%, 6/70), mostly due to respiratory 
failure and hypoxia (2.9%, 2/70 of each); Immune system disorders (7.1%, 5/70), mostly due to CRS 
(5.7%, 4/70), Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (7.1%, 5/70), mainly due to overdose 
(4.3%, 3/70); Gastrointestinal disorders (5.7%, 4/70) 
The common SAE (occurred in at least 3 subjects were pyrexia (n=8, 11.4%), fibril neutropenia (n=8, 
11.4%), CRS (n=4, 5.7%), sepsis, device-related infection and overdose (n=3, 4.3% for each). The 
type of SAE were globally consistent with a population of subjects with ALL who were heavily pre-
treated with a poor prognosis. As compared to adult patients (Study MT103-211), overall serious 
infections and infestations events (21.4% vs 31.7%) and serious neurologic or psychiatric events 
(10.0% vs 19.5%) were lower for children than in adult patients.  
Pre-defined AESI for pediatric population included neurologic events, CRS, TLS, infections, infusion 
reaction, capillary leak syndrome, medication errors, decreased immunoglobulins, elevated liver 
enzymes, cytopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia. Overall 63 subjects (90%) experienced at least 1 
treatment-emergent adverse event of interest, including 71% subjects with AESI ≥ grade 3 and 40% of 
subjects with serious AESI. Fatal events occurred in 3 subjects. In FAS 5-15µg/mg/day, the neurologic 
events appear less common (24.3% vs 52.9%) and less serious (7.1% vs 16.9%) in pediatric 
population than in adult MT103-211. Types of these events were quite variable and represented 24 
different preferred terms (PT), with only tremor occurred in ≥5% of subjects (n=4, 5.7%). 8 subjects 
(11.4%) experienced a CRS, events resolved for 7 subjects (7/8; 87.5%) with a median duration of 
events that resolved of 5 days (Q1, Q3: 4 to 9 days). CRS appears manageable at the proposed dosing 
regimen for paediatric population. However, serious CRS (5.7% vs 0.5%) were more frequently 
reported in paediatric children than in adult (MT103-211), probably due to more important tumor 
burden at the initiation of treatment in children than in adults.  
Cytopenia events were reported in 54.3% (38/70) of subject, mostly due to (≥5%) thrombocytopenia 
(21.4%, 15/70), febrile neutropenia (20.0%, 14/70), neutropenia (17.1%, 12/70), platelet count 
decreased (14.3%, 10/70), leukopenia and neutrophil count decreased (12.9%, 9/70 for each), and 
WBC count decreased (11.4%, 8/70). Grade 3 or 4 decreases in neutrophils and platelets were 
common, which are expected in this target population and the incidences are not more than those 
observed in adult patients. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long term safety data are needed in the paediatric population as risks of secondary malignancy, 
developmental toxicities and possible outcome of subsequent HSCT cannot be evaluated in the context 
of the submitted trials. A further follow up (study 20180130) of patients enrolled in study 20120215 is 
agreed (see Annex II).  
The MAH will also report from an expanded access protocol of blinatumomab in pediatric and 
adolescent subjects with relapsed and/or refractory B-precursor ALL (study 20130320 – see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A  rapid  and  strong  anti-leukemic  activity  of  Blincyto  in  paediatric  patients  with  second  or  later  BM 
relapse, relapse after HSCT or refractory ALL, has been demonstrated in pivotal study MT103-205 after 
only  2  cycles  of  Blincyto  as  monotherapy.  At  the  dose  of  5-15  µg/mg/day  (n=70),  CRc  +  CRh*  rate 
was 32.9%, including 12 subjects achieved CR with full recovery (17.1%). In addition with PR (5.7%), 
the  response  rate  within  the  first  2  cycles  for  the  5-15  µg/m²/day  FAS  was  39.6%.  This  rate  of 
achieved haematological response is impressive in this advanced aggressive ALL particularly in children 
with post-alloHSCT relapse (CR 47.5%), refractory ALL (CR 30.8%) and in infants under 2 years of age 
(CR 60.0%). 
The median RFS was 4.4 months (95% CI: 2.3, 7.6), the sustained duration of CR make it possible to 
proceed a first or second alloHSCT within 1 to 3 month following treatment by blinatumomab. Indeed, 
despite  more  than  half  of  subjects  (57.1%,  40/70)  had  already  received  prior  HSCT,  there  were  still 
one-third (35.7%, 25/70) of subjects became eligible and received an alloHSCT. In particular, almost a 
half of subjects who achieved a CRc, CRh* or CR3 (48.1%, 13/27), have proceeded to alloHSCT while 
in  remission  and  8  of  them  (29.6%,  8/27)  received  alloHSCT  without  any  other  subsequent  anti-
leukemic medications. Such rate of HSCT is highly relevant in the targeted advanced ALL, in whom the 
treatment goal is cure by alloHSCT as a consolidation therapy after achieving CR.  
In  view  of  high  rate  of  haematological  and  MRD  response  of  Blincyto  observed  in  adult  ALL,  this 
bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager antibody represents a relevant therapeutic interest in late-
line paediatric ALL with very poor prognosis and few therapeutic options. The therapy goal in paediatric 
R/R  ALL  is  to  achieve  haematological  CR,  which  offers  disease  control  and  reaches  eligibility  for 
undergoing  an  additional  alloHSCT,  which  is  currently  the  only  possibility  for  cure  in  this  difficult-to-
treat patient population.

Safety  of  Blincyto  in  paediatric  patients  was  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  for  Blincyto.  
Additional  studies  described  in  the  RMP  and  Annex  II  will  provide  further  information  on  long  term 
safety in paediatric patients. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In view of high unmet and urgent patient needs in children with late-line aggressive ALL, a strong and 
rapid  anti-leukemic  activity  of  Blincyto  together  with  a  high  rate  of  alloHSCT  observed  in  heavily 
treated children, Blincyto with its new mechanism of action represents a relevant therapeutic interest 
for paediatric R/R ALL.  
The benefit risk balance is considered acceptable.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The MAH will submit the final results of a follow-up observational study to further characterise the 
long-term safety of BLINCYTO including developmental aspects, HSCT and secondary malignancy in 
high-risk paediatric patients enrolled in Study 20120215.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of  BLINCYTO in the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year or older with 
Philadelphia chromosome negative B-cell precursor ALL which is refractory or in relapse after receiving 
at least two prior therapies or in relapse after receiving prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation, and when other treatment options are not considered suitable - is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to long term 
efficacy and safety:

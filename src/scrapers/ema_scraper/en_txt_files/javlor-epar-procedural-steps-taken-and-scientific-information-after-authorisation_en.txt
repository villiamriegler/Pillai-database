1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Periodic Safety Update

SmPC and PL 
The MAH proposed to add a warning to section 4.4 of the 
SmPC regarding the risk of hyponatraemia, including cases 
that are due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic 
Page 2/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hormone secretion, which was identified as a risk in the 
previous PSUR and included in the SmPC as a listed 
adverse reaction. Given the high frequency of grade 3 or 4 
events of hyponatraemia (11.7 %), which includes a fatal 
outcome, the adverse impact of hyponatraemia on survival 
in cancer patients and the potential for it to cause serious 
CNS sequelae (e.g. confusion, seizures), this proposal was 
endorsed. 
The MAH also proposed minor amendments to the list of 
adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to 
ensure consistency in how these reactions are coded. The 
changes do not impact on the frequency categories for the 
listed ADRs apart from “peripheral sensory neuropathy” 
which is upgraded from common to very common and 
“tumour pain”, which is now categorised as uncommon 
(previously its frequency was not known). No new ADRs 
have been added and no ADRs have been removed, other 
than “anorexia” which has been re-classified as “decreased 
appetite”.  
Refer to Scientific conclusions and grounds recommending 
the variation to terms of the Marketing Authorisation.

Update of sections 4.4 “Special warnings and

the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to

2011. These included one clinical trial and three post-
marketing reports. Therefore, as a risk minimisation 
measure, the MAH included a recommendation for blood 
pressure control and reference to brain imaging to confirm 
a diagnosis of PRES in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The 
frequency for PRES (‘rare’) was calculated based on a non-
TCCU clinical trial report and was included in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC.

A total of three cases of tumour pain following Javlor use 
were also reported post marketing. An association of the 
adverse reaction with the drug was plausible in these 
cases. The frequency of this adverse reaction could not be 
estimated from post-marketing data, hence “frequency not 
known” was included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
editorial changes were made to sections 4.2 and 4.6 
of the SmPC, and the Package Leaflet. 
In addition, the MAH also took the opportunity to 
include minor editorial changes to adapt the Product 
Information to the new QRD template (v8.1).

sensory peripheral neuropathy, common cough, dyspnoea, 
abdominal pain, constipation, ileus, buccal disorders, 
cutaneous reactions, pruritus, arthralgia, ashtenia/fatigue, 
injection site reactions, chest pain, transaminase increase, 
neutropenia, severe anaemia, thrombocytopenia,  and 
febrile neutropenia. At the same time, the MAH has made

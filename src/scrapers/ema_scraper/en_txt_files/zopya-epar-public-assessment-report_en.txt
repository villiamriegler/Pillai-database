 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
Zopya 75 mg film coated tablets is a generic medicinal product containing clopidogrel as clopidogrel 
hydrochloride as active substance. 
The  reference  medicinal  product  is  Plavix  75  mg  film-coated  tablets,  which  contain  clopidogrel 
hydrogensulphate.  
Clopidogrel is a non-competitive inhibitor of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at the platelet receptors. 
The  effect  of  ADP  on  platelets  is  mediated  by  two  G-protein  coupled  P2Y  receptors  (P2Y1  and 
P2Y12) and the cation channel-coupled P2X1 receptor. The adenylate cyclase-coupled ADP receptor 
P2Y12 is the main target of clopidogrel and lead to inhibition of platelet activation, aggregation, and 
Gp  IIb/IIIa  receptor  activation.  Clopidogrel  is  a  thienopyridine  and  only  the  S-enantiomer  is 
pharmacologically active. 
The safety and efficacy profile of clopidogrel has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of 
which  can  be  found  in  the  EPAR  for  Plavix.  In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing 
experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Zopya 75mg film-coated 
tablet  contains  clopidogrel  hydrochloride.  Since  this  application  is  a  generic  application  referring  to 
the reference medicinal product Plavix, summary of the clinical data of clopidogrel hydrogensulphate 
is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and 
safety have been conducted with clopidogrel hydrochloride.  
The  indication  for  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  is  different  from  the  reference  medicinal  product.  It  is 
part of the indication approved for the reference medicinal product. 
The therapeutic indication of Zopya is: 
Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: 
•   Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic 
stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease. 
The therapeutic indication of Plavix is:  
Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in:  
• Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic 
stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease.  
• Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome:  
- Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave 
myocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following 
percutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).  
- ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically 
treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. 
2.2  Quality aspects

Active Substance 
Clopidogrel hydrochloride is a white to off-white or yellowish crystalline powder practically insoluble 
in water at neutral pH but freely soluble at pH = 1. It is also freely dissolves in methanol. Clopidogrel 
hydrochloride  has  the  chemical  name  (+)-(S)-Methyl  α-(o-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c] 
pyridine-5(4H)-acetate hydrochloride. It does not show polymorphism. The active substance has one 
chiral  centre  therefore  it  exhibits  chirality  –  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  is  synthesized  as  the  S-
enantiomer. 
• 
Manufacture 
Clopidogrel hydrochloride is synthesised by three alternative routes from four key starting materials. 
The manufacturing process consists of three stages: the synthesis of clopidogrel free base (stage 1), 
purification of clopidogrel (stage 2) and crystallisation of clopidogrel hydrochloride (stage 3). The 
active substance is manufactured in two manufacturing sites.  
Adequate  In-Process  Controls  are  applied  during  the  manufacture  of  the  active  substance.  The 
specifications  and  control  methods  for  intermediate  products,  starting  materials  and  reagents,  have 
been presented and are satisfactory. 
• 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  solubility  (Ph.  Eur),  identification 
(IR, chlorides), loss of drying (Ph. Eur), heavy metals (Ph. Eur), heavy metals (Ph. Eur), sulphated ash 
(Ph. Eur), related substances (UPLC, HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), particle size 
(laser diffraction).   
The specifications reflect all relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods 
used in the routine controls are suitability described. The validation studies are in accordance with the 
ICH Guidelines. Impurity limits in the specification are justified by toxicology studies. 
Batch analysis results (n=16) for active substance manufactured according to all alternative methods 
by all manufacturers confirm consistency and uniformity. 
• 
Stability 
.The  stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  three  batches  of  active  substance  manufactured 
according to all alternative methods by all manufacturers at long-term conditions (25°C/60 % RH) and 
at accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) packed into drums containing the primary translucent LDPE 
bag and the secondary laminated bag made of PET/Al/PE foil. Photostability studies have also been 
carried out.  
The stability samples have been stored in a mini-size simulation of the original packing.  
Parameters  tested  during  stabilities  studies  are  appearance,  loss  on  drying,  related  substance, 
enantiomeric purity, assay and identification.  
Clopidogrel hydrochloride is sensitive to basic hydrolysis, oxidation and to acid hydrolysis at elevated 
temperature. Practically no degradation occurs when clopidogrel hydrochloride is placed at solid state 
under elevated temperature. 
The proposed re-test period is justified based on the stability results when the active substance is 
stored in the original packing material.

Medicinal Product 
• 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The product has been developed with the objective of developing a conventional release film coated 
tablet  bioequivalent  with  the  reference  medicinal  product  Plavix.  It  represents  an  alternative  to  the 
reference medicinal product since it contains the same active substance (clopidogrel base) different in 
the salt (hydrochloride instead of bisulphate) with the same dosage strength and dosage form. 
Solubility,  particle  size  and  stability  of  the  active  substance  were  taken  into  consideration  during 
development.  A  number  of  studies  were  also  carried  out  to  define  the  compatibility  of  the  active 
substance  with  the  pharmaceutical  excipients  used.  A  thermoplastic  based  granulation  has  been 
selected  as  manufacturing  process  especially  in  view  of  safety  and  environmental  issues  and  it 
provides  good  reproducibility  and  scale-up.  The  chosen  pharmaceutical  form,  film  coating,  is 
necessary especially for taste masking. 
The  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  are  tablet  core:  microcrystalline  cellulose  (diluent),  colloidal 
anhydrous silica (glidant), crospovidone (disintegrant) , macrogol 6000 (binder), hydrogenated castor 
oil  (lubricant).  Film  coating:  hypromellose  (film  coating  agent),  titanium  dioxide  (E171)  (opacifer), 
red iron oxide (E172), talc (antiadhesion agent) and propylene glycol (platicizer). All excipients used 
are in compliance with the Ph Eur. with the exception of the colouring agent. The methods used for 
the control of red iron oxide are described. None of the excipients are of human or animal origin. 
The  film  coated  tablets  are  packed  in  blisters  consisting  in  OPA/Al/PVC  film  and  heat  sealing 
aluminium foil. Supplier statement is provided confirming that the PVC film complies with the PhEur 
and the aluminium film conforms to the EU Directives. 
• 
Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process includes a non-standard thermoplastic granulation. Main steps are mixing, 
granulation with polymer, sieving, mixing with additives into compression mixture, tabletting and film 
coating. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the 
manufacturing  process  on  commercial  batch  size  and  on  both  manufacturing  sites  claimed.  The 
applicant commits to validate the bigger batch size claimed. As the batch size increase do not affect 
the  validation  of  the  non-standard  granulation  step  (increase  of  sub-batches  number)  this  was 
accepted..  
The batch analysis data show that the film coated tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according 
to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation. 
• 
Product Specification 
The  product  specifications  include  tests  by  validated  methods  for  appearance,  uniformity  of  dosage 
(Ph Eur), identification of clopidogrel (HPLC, TLC), identification of titanium dioxide, identification 
of  iron  oxides,  related  substances,  enantiomeric  purity,  dissolution,  assay  (,  HPLC),  microbiological 
purity (Ph Eur) and water content (Ph Eur).    
Degradation products are controlled and their limits are justified by reference to stability studies and 
toxicology studies. 
Degradation products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. 
The  tests  and  limits  for  the  finished  product  are  appropriate  to  control  the  quality  of  the  finished 
product for their intended purpose. 
Batch analysis data submitted confirm satisfactory uniformity of the finished product at release.

• 
Stability of the Product 
Three pilot batches of the finished product packed in the intended container and closure system were 
included on stability studies under ICH conditions. The batches were tested for appearance, water, 
disintegration, hardness, related substances, enantiomeric purity, and dissolution of clopidogrel, assay 
and microbiological tests. They were exposed to 25º C/60% RH for 12 months for and for 6 months at 
40°C/75%RH.  
Photo  stability  tests  have  been  performed  in  accordance  with  ICH  guideline  Q  1  B. Results showed 
that  the  tablets  became  slightly  pale  and  the  colour  was  not  homogeneous,  which  confirms  the 
requirements for the storage of the product in the original package. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC 
are acceptable. 
Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the 
time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to 
resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe 
2.3  Non-Clinical aspects   
Clopidogrel  is  widely  used  well-known  substance.  Its  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and 
toxicological  properties  are  well  characterised.  This  generic  application  contains  a  different  salt 
(clopidogrel  hydrochloride)  of  the  active  substance  used  in  the  reference  product  (clopidogrel 
hydrogensulphate).  A  summary  of  the  literature  information  on  non-clinical  data  of  clopidogrel  and 
the  results  of  two  new  non-clinical  studies  (acute  and  chronic  toxicity)  conducted  with  clopidogrel 
hydrochloride  were  provided.  Furthermore,  on  the  basis  of  the  CHMP  Guidance  for  users  of  the 
centralised  procedure  for  generic  application  (EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006),  when  different  salts  of 
the  active  substance  of  the  reference  medicinal  product  are  used,  additional  information  providing 
proof  that  their  non-clinical  safety  and/or  efficacy  profile  is  not  different  from  that  of  the  reference 
medicinal  product  is  needed.  Thus,  information  that  the  different  clopidogrel  salt  (clopidogrel 
hydrochloride)  does  not  differ  significantly  in  non-clinical  properties  with  regards  to  safety  and 
efficacy  of  the  reference  product  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  in  accordance  with  the  relevant 
guideline.  
The  response  referred  to  the  results  of  the  toxicity  and  genotoxicity  studies  to  examine  the  safety 
profile  of  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  vs  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate.  The  repeated  dose  toxicity 
study  reports  were  in  accordance  with  GLP  standards  and  regulatory  guidelines  (please  see  section 
Toxicology).  The  13-week  toxicity  study  report  did  not  detect  major  differences  in  the  same  safety 
profile for the hydrochloride and hydrogen sulphate salt; liver was determined as the target organ in 
both  salts.  Regarding  the  genotoxicity  testing,  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  tested  at  a  higher 
concentration  level  than  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate,  turned  to  be  not  clastogenic  in  the 
chromosome  aberration  test.  In  the  micronucleus  test,  at  the  same  dose  levels,  neither  the  hydrogen 
sulphate  salt  nor  the  hydrochloride  salt  was  found  clastogenic/aneugenic.  Thus,  based  on  the  data 
provided,  similar  safety  profile  was  demonstrated  for  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  and  clopidogrel 
hydrogen sulphate.  
Toxicology 
Two new non-clinical studies were conducted with clopidogrel hydrochloride. 
8/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Single-dose toxicity 
The acute toxicity study on rats was performed with clopidogrel hydrochloride. Results of single dose 
toxicity  studies  in  rats  revealed  low  toxicity  of  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  at  doses  10,  100,  1000 
mg/kg.  No  clinical  signs  of  toxicity  and  mortality  were  reported  in  rats  after  the  administration  of 
drug. No significant differences in body weight gain were seen between the control and treated groups. 
At  terminal  necropsy,  no  apparent  macroscopic  changes  attributed  to  clopidogrel  hydrochloride 
administration  were  observed  in  any  animal.  The  majority  of  tissue  was  macroscopically 
unremarkable. LD50 values were over 1500mg /kg for both sexes. 
After a single oral administration of clopidogrel in mice, rats and baboons, toxicity occurred only at 
very high doses and the target organs were mainly the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney and the lung. 
The oral LD50 values of clopidogrel were over 2 g/kg in all species.  
Repeated-dose toxicity 
The  toxicity  of  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was  investigated  in  rats  upon  daily  oral  administration  by 
gastric gavage for 13 consecutive weeks. The study was conducted with four groups of 10 males and 
10 females each versus one vehicle control group and 3 test groups receiving 12.5, 125 or 250 mg/kg 
body weight/day. Treatment with clopidogrel hydrochloride was generally well tolerated, based on the 
lack of treatment related clinical signs and the normal growth of the animals. Some treatment related 
changes  in  haematology,  e.g.  thrombocytes,  and  clinical  chemistry,  e.g.  cholesterol,  triglycerides, 
bilirubin,  total  protein,  etc.,  were  revealed.  Decreased  thymus  weights,  increased  adrenal,  kidney, 
seminal vesicles and liver weights and hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes were also observed. 
The  no-observed-adverse-effect  level  (NOAEL)  for  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was  considered  12.5 
mg/kg body weight/day. There appears to be no additional toxic effects of clopidogrel hydrochloride 
although  no  direct  comparative  data  between  the  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  and  clopidogrel 
hydrogensulphate  were  provided.  Furthermore,  any  potential  differences  in  the  non-clinical 
toxicokinetic  profile  would  be  apparent  in  the  clinical  pharmacokinetic  profile  addressed  by  the 
bioequivalence studies. 
Genotoxicity 
The  in  vitro  Salmonella  typhimurium  reverse  mutation  assays  of  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was 
performed  and  revealed  evidence  that  clopidogrel  did  not  induce  effects  at  either  the  gene  or 
chromosome  levels.  In  Ames  test  of  clopidogrel’s  main  metabolite  S-carboxylic  acid  derivative  was 
also  negative.  The  eventual  mutagenic  activity  of  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was  investigated  in  the 
bacterial reverse mutation assay with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA 1535 
and  TA102,  without  and  with  metabolic  activation.  The  tested  substance  was  considered  non 
mutagenic. Clopidogrel was not genotoxic in micronucleus test in mice. Incidence of micronucleated 
polychromatic red blood cells (RBs) was not elevated in mice received clopidogrel at oral doses up to 
2000 mg/kg daily, for three consecutive days. Ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic RBCs was 
also  normal  which  indicates  that  there  was  no  bone  marrow  cytotoxicity.  There  was  no  evidence  of 
any clastogenic activity for clopidogrel. 
Although  the  in  vitro  studies  did  not  reveal  any  mutagenic,  genotoxic  or  clastogenic  potential  of 
clopidogrel, the CHMP raised a major objection with respect to the studies on impurities, which did do 
not  follow  recommendations  of  the  OECD  guideline,  protocol  471  (OECD,  1997,  Test  Guideline 
47:Bacterial  Reverse  Mutation  Test.  In:  OECD  Guideline  for  Testing  of  Chemicals.  Paris, 
Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  &  Development)  and  of  the  Question  &  Answers  on  the 
CHMP  guideline  on  the  limits  of  genotoxic  impurities  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/431994/2007).    In 
response, adequately conducted reverse mutation assays in accordance with GLP standards and OECD 
guideline protocol number 471 was provided. The results of the Ames test performed with potassium 
ethyl  sulphate  and  clopidogrel  isopropyl  sulphate  indicated  that  these  two  substances  do  not  hold  a 
mutagenic  potential.  Thus,  the  content  limit  for  monoalkylsulphates  as  proposed  by  the  applicant  is 
acceptable to the CHMP. 
Introduction  of  the  product  onto  the  market  is  unlikely  to  result  in  any  significant  increase  in  the 
combined sales volumes for all clopidorel hydrogensulphate products, and would thus not be expected 
to have an adverse effect upon the environment. With this regard and on the basis of CHMP Guideline 
9/15 
 
 
 
 
 
on Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (CPMP/SWP/4447/00), a 
formal environmental risk assessment is not considered necessary. 
2.4  Clinical Aspects  
Introduction 
The CHMP assessment addressed pharmacokinetic data in respect of one bioequivalence study. 
GCP 
The bioequivalence study provided in support of the application was performed by CROs in Canda.. A 
statement was provided that the clinical part of these studies was conducted according to the ICH Note 
for Guidance on Good Clinical Practices.  
During  the  evaluation  of  the  dossier,  the  CHMP  considered  that  in  the  view  of  the  reported 
discrepancies that occurred during clopidogrel plasma analysis, it was necessary to inspect the conduct 
of  the  bioequivalence  study  07-197.  The  results  of  this  triggered  inspection  and  the  satisfactory 
responses to its findings are an integral part of the procedure.  
Clinical studies 
One bioequivalence study comparing Zopya 75 mg film coated tablets with the originator Plavix 75 
mg film-coated tablets was provided. The study was performed in fasting subjects and measured the 
parent drug and the major (inactive) metabolite, clopidogrel carboxylic acid. In addition, this generic 
product  contains  a  different  salt  of  clopidogrel  (clopidogrel  hydrochloride)  in  comparison  with  the 
reference medicinal product. Thus, the CHMP raised a major concern, since on the basis of the CHMP 
Guidance for users of the centralised procedure for generic application (EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006), 
when  different  salts  of  the  active  substance  of  the  reference  medicinal  product  are  used,  additional 
information  providing  proof  that  their  safety  and/or  efficacy  profile  is  not  different  from  that  of  the 
reference medicinal product is needed.

volunteers under fasting conditions 
The objective of this study was to assess the single-dose relative bioavailability of clopidogrel 75 mg 
film-coated tablets (KRKA, d.d.) and Plavix 75 mg clopidogrel film-coated tablets (Sanofi-Synthelabo 
Limited), under fasting conditions. This was an open-label, randomised, single-dose, 2-way crossover, 
2-sequence;  comparative  bioavailability  study  performed  on  volunteers  A  total  of  92  subjects 
completed  the  clinical  phase  of  the  study.  Single  oral  75  mg  clopidogrel  doses  were  separated  by  a 
washout  period  of  14  days.  The  protocol  and  informed  consent  forms  (ICFs)  were  reviewed  and 
approved  by  an  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  convening  the  CRO  in  October  and  November 
2007. The study was conducted between 1 December and 22 December 2007.

POPULATION(S) STUDIED   
A  total  of  96  healthy,  non-smoking,  adult  male  volunteers  aged  18-55  years  and  with  BMI  18.00  –
28.00 kg/m2 were included in the study. These were medically healthy subjects with clinically normal 
laboratory  profiles,  vital  signs  and  ECGs.  Of  the  96  subjects,  4  subjects  were  withdrawn  or 
discontinued. 92 subjects finished the study and were included in the analysis. Adequate inclusion and 
exclusion  criteria  were  followed.  The  choice  of  the  selected  population  in  this  clinical  trial  was 
considered appropriate.  
ANALYTICAL METHODS   
The  plasma  samples  were  assayed  for  clopidogrel  and  its  carboxylic  acid  metabolite  using 
LC/MS/MS).  The  analytical  technique  was  initially  validated  at  CRO  in  Canada,  and  transferred 
afterward to another CRO in Canada. A partial validation was conducted successfully in order to allow 
this transfer. However, there were insufficient data submitted with respect to the pre-study validation 
and  validation  of  the  bio-analytical  technique  used  for  determination  of  clopidogrel,  and  the  CHMP 
questioned the validity of the bioequivalence study. Thus, a GCP inspection was requested. 
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES  
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters defined in the protocol were AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and maximal 
plasma clopidogrel concentration Cmax. 
STATISTICAL METHODS   
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out on ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax for both 
analytes:  clopidogrel  and  the  main  inactive  metabolite.  A  non-parametric  test  was  carried  out  to 
compare  the  Tmax  values  between  treatments.  The  statistical  model  included  sequence,  period  and 
treatment factors as fixed effects and subject within sequence as random effect. The statistical methods 
used were acceptable.

The proposed 90% confidence intervals for AUCt and AUCinf are in line with the recommendation of

fulfil  this  requirement.  However,  the  widening  of  the  limits  for  bioequivalence  conclusions  for  Cmax 
values, although not in line with the current CHMP recommendations, was not considered necessary 
since  the  Cmax  results  of  the  study  are  within  the  standard  80-125%  limits  required  by  the  NƒG  on

Discussion on Clinical aspects 
One  clinical  bioequivalence  trial  07-197  was  provided  for  Zopya  application,  analysing  the  parent 
prodrug  clopidogrel.  The  demonstration  of  the  unchanged  safety/efficacy  profile  of  clopidogrel 
hydrochloride when compared with Plavix (clopidogrel hydrogensulphate) was raised by the CHMP 
as a major issue for this generic product. In response, further discussion on the comparability of the 
efficacy  and  safety  profiles  of  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate  and  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was 
.  Pharmacokinetics,  dissolution,  adverse  events  profile  and  other  clinical  data  were 
provided
onsidered  and  it  was  concluded  that  the  two  salts  of  clopidogrel  have  a comparable safety/efficacy 
c
profile. 
At  the  time  of  approval  of  the  reference  product  Plavix,  there  was  no  reliable  and  validated 
methodology  for  the  determination  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  parent  prodrug  clopidogrel,  or  of 
the active metabolite clopidogrel thiol. Thus, the pharmacokinetic profile was established based on the 
pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel carboxylic acid, which is the non-active metabolite.  In the meantime, 
a reliable bioanalytical method for determination of clopidogrel in plasma and urine was developed. 
Since  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  the  active  metabolite  is  still  not  well  established,  the  CHMP

ferent from that of the reference medicinal product, Plavix (please see 
The indication of Zopya is dif
ection  2.1).  Thus,  the  Product  Information  has  been  adequately  amended  to  reflect  this  change  and 
s
this is considered acceptable.  
Furthermore, the recently published literature data indicate that the bioavailability of a single oral dose 
of clopidogrel and the pharmacokinetic parameters of clopidogrel, especially Cmax and AUCinf, might 
be  increased  by  several  folds  in  the  fed  condition  compared  to  the  fasted  condition.  The  currently 
presented clinical studies were conducted in fasted state and thus, the CHMP requested a clarification 
of  this  approach  and  adequate  justification  why  bioequivalence  for  the  generic  product  should  be 
demonstrated only under fasting condition was provided. Bioequivalence studies in fasting conditions 
are  normally  recommended  as  mentioned  in  the  Questions  &  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and 
Bioequivalence  Guideline  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006)  document  as  the  drug  product  is  to  be 
administered  under  fasting  as  well  as  fed  conditions.  In  addition  to  the  dissolution  studies  using 
clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate,  conducted  at  three  different  pH  values  (1.2,  4.5,  6.8),  the  applicant 
provided an additional in vivo bioequivalence study conducted under fed conditions. The comparative 
dissolution  studies  under  conditions  mimicking  the  fed  state  as  well  the  fed  state 
in  vitro 
ioequivalence  study  did  not  reveal  any  major  differences  when  compared  to  the  reference  drug 
b
product. 
The  bio-analytical  technique  and  methodology  applied  in  the  analysis  of  the  samples  during  the 
bioequivalence  studies  included  validation  with  the  analysis  of  calibration  curves  and  controls  at

various concentrations. The CHMP questioned whether there is a potential for back-conversion of the 
quantitatively  major  metabolite  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  to  the  parent  drug.  Considering  that  the 
plasma levels of clopidogrel carboxylic acid are considerably higher than those of the parent drug, a 
minimum back-conversion of the metabolite would lead to a significant over-estimation of clopidogrel 
plasma  levels  and  would  bias  the  outcome  of  the  bioequivalence  study.  The  back-conversion  could 
occur in the presence of alcohol used in sample preparation and analysis. It was, indeed, reported that 
a possible back-conversion of clopidogrel metabolite to clopidogrel parent drug was evidenced in the 
presence  of  methanol.  In  order  to  avoid  this  process,  the  extraction  procedure  was  changed  and 
methanol-free conditions employed. Although it has been indicated that stability tests were performed 
in  order  to  prove  the  reproducibility  and  accuracy  of  clopidogrel  concentration  measurements,  the 
CHMP  questioned  these  results  since  no  clear  description  of  the  analytical  technique  including 
extraction  procedure  actually  used  in  the  initial  pre-study  validation  process  was  provided. 
Information on the validation procedures in study 07-197 was requested by the CHMP. In response, 
details of the bio-analytical methodology and full validation details were provided demonstrating that 
no methanol, which is needed for the conversion the acid metabolite to clopidogrel, was used and thus, 
no  source  of  methylation  exists  within  the  entire  methodology,  including  all  solution  preparation, 
p
lasma  sample  processing,  handling  storage  and  LC-MS/MS  determination.  The  CHMP  considered 
this issue resolved. 
Considering  the  above  difficulties  in  the  determination  of  clopidogrel  in  plasma  especially  the  issue 
related  to  the  possible  back-conversion  of  the  metabolite  to  the  parent  drug,  a  triggered  GCP 
inspection  of  the  bioequivalence  study  was  requested  by  the  CHMP,  which  was  of  the  opinion  that 
results  of  this  inspection  a
nd  the  satisfactory  responses  to  its  findings  were  an  integral  part  of  the 
e
valuation procedure. The inspection identified major and minor findings that seem not to affect the 
overall results of the trial.  
The  bioequivalence  study  07-197  and  its  statistical  evaluation  were  in  accordance  with  accepted 
standards  for  bioequivalence  testing,  as  stated  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of 
Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).  The  parameters  used  to  establish 
bioavailability included the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximal plasma 
concentration  of  the  parent  compound  of  clopidogrel.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  these 
parameters  were  within  the  recommended  80-125%  range  for  clopidogrel,  required  by  the  above 
mentioned guideline. The proposed widening of the 90% confidence interval for clopidogrel Cmax to 
75%-133% was found to be unacceptable by the CHMP; nevertheless, sin
ce the confidence intervals 
r Cmax values of clopidogrel were within the required 80-125% range, the need for widening of the 
fo
intervals was not applic
able. The bioequivalence with Plavix was proven.

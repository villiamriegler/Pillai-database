2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Proposed Indication:  
“VANFLYTA is indicated in combination with standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction and 
standard cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy, and as continuation monotherapy following 
Assessment report

consolidation, for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 
that is FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) positive”. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is the most common acute leukaemia in adults (Siegel, 2022; De 
Kouchkovsky, 2016).Kouchkovsky, 2016). The incidence of AML in Europe is estimated at 2.5 to 6 per 
100,000 people (Lubeck, 2016). The incidence of AML increases with age, ranging from 1.8 cases per 
100,000 people aged <65 years to 17.6 cases per 100,000 people aged >65 years. More than half of 
the patients with newly diagnosed AML in developed countries are >65 years of age, with a median 
age at diagnosis of 67 years (Heuser, 2020). 
Overall, the outcome of patients with AML is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 40%, which rapidly 
declines with increasing age at diagnosis (Thein, 2013). Outcome is influenced by multiple factors, 
both disease specific (eg, cytogenetic and/or molecular genetic alterations, including FLT3, 
nucleophosmin 1 [NPM1], and others) and patient specific such as age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status, organ function, and other comorbidities (Döhner, 2017). Age is the 
most prominent patient-specific risk factor, while chromosomal aberrations/genetic mutations have 
been considered the strongest disease-specific risk factors (Kottaridis, 2001). The assessment of 
genetic mutations, including FLT3, as prognostic factors has become increasingly important for risk 
assessment and in the treatment of AML, as recommended by both the European LeukemiaNet and the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (Döhner, 2017; Pollyea, 2021). There is 
evidence that the incidence of FLT3-ITD mutations decreases with age, with an incidence of up to 35% 
in patients between 20 and 59 years compared with 16% to 20% in patients >60 years (Konig, 2015). 
In contrast, FLT3-TKD mutations have not been associated with a consistent prognostic impact (Mead, 
2007). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Acute myeloid leukaemia is a heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterised by the clonal 
expansion of myeloid blasts in the peripheral blood, bone marrow and/or other tissues. 
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase in the Class III split kinase domain 
family of RTKs. It is normally expressed on immature hematopoietic progenitors, as well as on some 
mature myeloid and lymphoid cells. Furthermore, FLT3 plays a role in the regulation of survival, 
proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells (Kazi, 2019). Overexpression of the 
FLT3 receptor occurs in nearly all cases of AML and mutations in FLT3 represent one of the most 
common genetic alterations, occurring in approximately 30% of adult patients with newly diagnosed 
AML (Papaemmanuil, 2016; Kennedy, 2020). 
There are 2 types of FLT3 mutations: FLT3-ITD and point mutations or deletion in the tyrosine kinase 
domain (TKD; FLT3-TKD). The FLT3-ITD (In-frame internal tandem duplications) mutation is more 
common than the TKD mutation, and these are found in 20% to 25% and 7% to 10% of all AML cases, 
respectively. In-frame internal tandem duplications within the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) occur most 
commonly in exon 14, encoding the juxta membrane (JM) domain. The JM domain inhibits activation of 
the receptor by steric hindrance, preventing the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) from assuming an 
active conformation. Presence of an ITD causes loss of this inhibitory effect, resulting in activation of 
the TKD causing ligand-independent, or constitutive, FLT3 receptor signalling, and thereby promote 
cytokine-independent AML cell survival and proliferation. The FLT3-ITD mutations are associated with a 
higher leukaemic burden with marked leukocytosis and higher blast percentage.

EMA/443555/2023  
Page 12/130 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
It is well established that the presence of an FLT3-ITD mutation confers an unfavorable prognosis, with 
relapse being the principal cause of treatment failure for the majority of these patients. On average, 
the median time to relapse for patients with FLT3-ITD (+) AML in first remission is estimated at 
approximately 9 months (Ciolli, 2004; Fröhling, 2002; Kottaridis, 2001). Moreover, approximately 75% 
of patients with FLT3-ITD (+) AML at diagnosis continue to have the ITD mutation at relapse, 
suggesting that FLT3-ITD may function as a driver mutation responsible for disease progression 
(Daver, 2019; Krönke, 2013). 
At initial presentation, patients with newly diagnosed AML harboring FLT3-ITD mutations present 
commonly with a high leukaemic burden, such as increased white blood cell (WBC) counts and a high 
percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. When treated with combination 
chemotherapy alone, FLT3-ITD (+) AML is associated with a higher rate of relapse (Levis, 2004) and 
inferior overall survival (OS) than compared with FLT3 WT disease (Kottaridis, 2001; Yanada, 2005; 
Thiede, 2002; Fröhling, 2002; Whitman, 2001). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Chemotherapy has long been the mainstay of treatment for patients with newly diagnosed AML. In 
patients eligible for induction chemotherapy, cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline remains 
the standard therapy in newly diagnosed AML, regardless of cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities, 
with CR achieved in 60% to 85% of adults who are ≤60 years of age and 40% to 60% in adults >60 
years of age (Döhner, 2017). For subjects who achieve a CR, the current guidelines recommend that 
subjects must be offered postinduction therapy to eradicate residual disease and prevent relapse. 
Available options for consolidation include chemotherapy and/or allogeneic-hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (allo-HSCT), depending on the risk group. Allogeneic-hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation has improved the prognosis of patients with AML, but relapse remains high and non-
relapse mortality associated with allo-HSCT is as high as 20% (Styczyński, 2020). 
The clinical management of AML with FLT3 mutations has been transformed by the development of 
multikinase inhibitors targeting FLT3 mutations. The current approach is to combine them with 
conventional chemotherapy to increase the cytotoxic effect against leukaemia cells and reverse the 
poor prognosis for AML patients with FLT3 mutations (Döhner, 2017; Pollyea, 2021). The standard of 
care for patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD (+) AML includes 2 distinct approaches based on 
patient age (ranges <60 years and ≥60 years). For AML patients with FLT3 mutations who are <60 
years of age and who are eligible for standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, the NCCN 
and European LeukemiaNet guidelines recommend that midostaurin be added to standard 
chemotherapy as part of frontline treatment. This recommendation is based on the results of the 
RATIFY study in newly diagnosed AML subjects with FLT3 mutations (internal tandem duplication [ITD] 
and/or TKD) (Stone, 2017). For AML patients with FLT3 mutations who are ≥60 years old and who are 
benefiting from intensive cytarabine-based induction therapy, the NCCN also recommends that 
midostaurin be added to standard chemotherapy (Pollyea, 2021). For AML subjects with FLT3-ITD who 
are unable to tolerate intensive chemotherapy, azacytidine or decitabine alone or in combination with 
sorafenib or venetoclax with hypomethylating agents are recommended (Pollyea, 2021). 
In the European Union (EU), maintenance treatment is approved only for midostaurin in patients who 
are in CR after induction and consolidation chemotherapy, but not after allo-HSCT (Heuser, 2020). 
Significant improvements in survival outcomes of patients with FLT3-ITD (+) AML have been reported 
with allo-HSCT compared with chemotherapy or autologous HSCT; however, relapse following allo-
HSCT remains high in these patients compared with those without FLT3-ITD mutations, with a higher

2-year relapse incidence (30% versus 16%; p = 0.006) and lower leukaemia-free survival (58% 
versus 71%; p = 0.04), respectively (Schlenk, 2014); Döhner, 2017). 
Given the poor prognosis of patients with FLT3-ITD (+) AML and the high risk of relapse, the unmet 
medical need remains high and new treatment options are urgently needed. 
2.2.  About the product 
Quizartinib is a Type II inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3. Type II inhibitors, including 
quizartinib, binds the inactive conformation (Zorn, 2015, Smith 2015). Generally, type II inhibitors are 
more selective than type I inhibitors, as the inactive conformation preferred by type II inhibitors is 
thought to be more kinase specific than the active conformation (Davis 2011). Quizartinib and its 
major metabolite AC886 competitively bind to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of FLT3 
with high affinity (Kd=1.3 nM and 0.54 nM, respectively). Quizartinib and AC886 inhibit FLT3 kinase 
activity by crossing the cell membrane and interacting with the ATP-binding site of the intracellular 
TKD and competitively inhibit ATP binding, preventing autophosphorylation of the receptor, thereby 
inhibiting further downstream FLT3 receptor signalling and blocking FLT3-ITD-dependent cell 
proliferation. Type II inhibitors interact with a hydrophobic region immediately adjacent to the ATP-
binding site that is only accessible when the receptor is in the inactive conformation, and thereby 
prevent receptor activation and block FLT3-ITD-dependent cell proliferation. 
At clinically relevant concentrations, quizartinib and AC886 also bind with less affinity to KIT and have 
little or no affinity for other receptor tyrosine kinases. 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX11 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
As of August 2021, the overall quizartinib clinical programme consisted of 26 sponsored clinical 
studies, including 13 studies in either newly diagnosed or R/R AML, 1 study in solid tumours, and 12 
single-dose studies in healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic impairment. The dose of quizartinib 
administered in these studies ranged from 12 to 450 mg QD. Of the 13 studies conducted in subjects 
with AML, 10 are completed studies.  
The quizartinib clinical development programme for newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD (+) AML comprises a 
pivotal Phase 3 study, AC220-A-U302 (N = 539) and 2 completed Phase 1 studies in subjects with 
newly diagnosed AML, Studies 2689-CL-0005 (N = 18) and AC220-A-J102 (N = 7). In addition, 1 
Phase 1 study, 2689-CL-0011 (N = 13), in subjects who received quizartinib as maintenance following 
allo-HSCT, has been completed.  
In the EU, orphan drug designation was granted on 23 Mar 2009, and Protocol Assistance was received 
from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on 24 Sep 2015 for the development of 
quizartinib for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML (see below). The original Pediatric Investigational 
Plan was first approved on 22 Jul 2016.

which is present as quizartinib dihydrochloride. 
Other ingredients are: (tablet core): hydroxypropylbetadex, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium 
stearate, (film-coating): hypromellose, talc, triacetin, titanium dioxide, yellow iron oxide (26.5 mg 
tablet only). 
The product is available in aluminium/aluminium perforated unit dose blisters. 
2.4.2.  Active  substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The chemical name of quizartinib dihydrochloride is 1-(5-tert-butyl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl)-3-(4-{7-[2-
(morpholin-4-yl)ethoxy]imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]benzothiazol-2-yl}phenyl)urea corresponding to the 
molecular formula C29H32N6O4S*2HCl. It has a relative molecular mass of 633.59 and the following 
structure: 
Figure 1. Quizartinib dihydrochloride active substance structure 
The chemical structure of quizartinib was elucidated by a combination of halide titration, ultraviolet 
(UV) spectrum, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, proton-
proton correlation spectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy (HMBC), 
heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC), mass spectrometry and single crystal 
X-Ray structure determination. 
The active substance is a white to off-white solid, slightly hygroscopic, very slightly soluble in acidic 
aqueous medium and its solubility decreases with pH. Quizartinib has a non-chiral molecular structure.  
Polymorphism has been observed for quizartinib dihydrochloride. The solid state properties of the 
active substance were measured by a polymorph screen of quizartinib dihydrochloride produced a total 
of nine unique XRPD patterns (designated A through I) as well as amorphous material. The active 
substance is manufactured in the Form B which is the most thermodynamically stable. All of these 
other forms were either solvates or hydrates and all were found to convert to Form B upon drying. It 
should be noted that the active substance is rendered amorphous in the finished product by spray-
drying manufacturing process.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process consists of three chemical transformations (with 
isolation of intermediates) followed by a final salt formation step. It is a convergent synthesis with both 
arms of equal length (two steps).  
The process uses well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The proposed starting 
materials were the subject of pre-submission Scientific Advice from EMA and were assessed in a previous 
centralised MAA. The justification of the choice of starting material was considered acceptable and it was 
concluded  that  the  proposed  starting  materials  ensure  sufficient  portion  of  the  process  is  performed 
under GMP. 
The manufacturing process is sufficiently well described and the overall control strategy was considered 
adequate  to  control  the  process  leading  to  an  active  substance  of  intended  and  consistent  quality. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies 
and  elements  of  Quality  by  Design  (QbD).  The  critical  process  parameters  were  identified  by  a 
combination of prior knowledge and multivariate Design of Experiments (DoEs). Based on these studies, 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were proposed for a number of unit operations of the manufacturing 
process of the active substance. In response to questions raised during the procedure, and in line with 
EMA  Q&A  on  “Improving  the  understanding  of  NORs,  PARs,  DSp  and  normal  variability  of  process 
parameters”  (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/354895/2017),  the  applicant  revised  the  proposed  PARs  so  that 
the flexibility in the commercial manufacturing process of the active substance is limited to a single PAR 
for each unit operation (i.e. a Design Space is not claimed). A traditional approach is maintained in the 
control strategy (with in-process controls for reaction monitoring and intermediates’ specifications). The 
available  development  data,  the  proposed  control  strategy  and  batch  analysis  data  from  commercial 
scale batches fully support the finally approved PARs.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development  programme.  The  currently  proposed  version  (B3)  of  the  manufacturing  process  was 
developed  at  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  site  and  it  has  undergone  only  minor  adjustments 
from previous version (B2) which produced stability and toxicology batches. Late stage clinical batches 
were  obtained  from  these  processes  at  the  proposed  commercial  scale.  The  quality  of  the  active 
substance  used  in  the  various  phases  of  the  development  is  considered  to  be  comparable  with  that 
produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance packaging complies with Ph. Eur. chapter 3.1.3 and Regulation EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), counter-ion assay (Ph. Eur.), and 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 16/130 
 
 
 
The tests included in the specifications are in line with the requirements of ICH Q6A. Impurities present 
at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and 
clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
An extensive discussion on the impurities control strategy has been presented, both in 3.2.S.2.3 as 
well as in 3.2.S.3.2. About 28 impurities are discussed in detail. Actual and potential impurities 
occurring at all stages have been discussed in detail. 
The applicant argues that quizartinib active substance is exempted from ICH M7 requirements for 
impurity limits setting as: 1) quizartinib is indicated for advanced cancer disease as defined in the 
scope of ICH S9 and exposure to mutagenic impurities in these cases would not significantly add to the 
cancer risk of the active substance, and herewith  impurities could be controlled at acceptable levels 
for non-mutagenic impurities, and 2) quizartinib itself appears to be genotoxic according to the 
performed Ames test. 1) and 2) combined means that the ICH M7 guideline would not apply for 
quizartinib and instead the impurities could be set in line with ICH Q3A/B guidelines. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The results from forced degradation, 
confirming the stability-indicating power of the HPLC impurity test procedure, were provided. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis data (including 8 batches manufactured at commercial scale) of the active substance 
are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial packagefor up to 48 months under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The primary batches are manufactured according to 
process B2 while the proposed commercial process is the more recent process B3 however, considering 
the minor differences between the two versions of the process this was not considered to have a 
significant effect on the stability profile of the active substance. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, organic impurities assay, moisture (every time 
point), microbial limits and X-ray powder diffraction (annually). The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. Despite a somewhat variable impurity profile at 
time zero, the study results show that the active substance quizartinib dihydrochloride is highly stable 
and no clear trends are observed, notably towards degradation. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results on stress 
conditions (Acidic, Basic, Oxidative, Thermal) were also provided on one batch. The results show no 
significant changes after storage. The physical and chemical properties, appearance, IR, XRPD pattern, 
assay, related substance and water remain the same compared to unstressed control. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable.

2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate release film-coated tablets containing 17.7 mg or 26.5 
mg of quizartinib, which is present as quizartinib dihydrochloride. The 17.7 mg tablets are white, round 
shaped film-coated tablets, 8.9 mm in diameter and debossed with "DSC 511" on one side and the 
26.5 mg tablets are yellow, round shaped film-coated tablets, 10.2 mm in diameter and debossed with 
"DSC 512" on one side. 
All excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The formulation development was supported by clinical development, each modified formulation from 
the form used in Phase 1 (powder in bottle dissolved at the clinical site in a 5% hydroxypropyl-β-
cyclodextrin (HPβCD) solution) to the form used in Phase 3 (film-coated tablets), was justified by the 
need to simplify preparation of the oral solution at the clinical site and reduce time required to dissolve 
the active substance. 
The solubility of quizartinib dihydrochloride is highly pH dependent; it increases as the pH deceases. At 
pH 2.0 or above it becomes practically insoluble. At pH below 2, quizartinib is very slightly soluble. The 
solution of quizartinib dihydrochloride at concentrations greater than 1 mg/mL tend to form a gel. 
Active substance particle size distribution is not subject to specification given that during the 
manufacturing process quizartinib is dissolved in water. 
At the highest dosage strength of 26.5 mg the active substance is not completely soluble in 250 mL of 
aqueous media over the range from pH 2.2 to 8.0. Quizartinib demonstrates low permeability and has 
thus been classified as a BCS class 4 compound (low solubility/low permeability). 
The major excipient is the hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) which increases the quizartinib 
solubility and prevents gel formation. The ratio of the active substance to HPβCD was set at 1:10. The 
other inactive ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and colour coating 
mixture. 
The active substance to HPβCD ratio (1:10) has been shown to be an important parameter to the 
bioavailability of the finished product. Since this ratio has not changed from the Phase 1 clinical study 
to commercial formulation, it is considered that there is no significant difference between commercial 
formulation and clinical trial formulations. 
Vanflyta 17.7 mg and 26.5 mg tablets are manufactured from the same blend by adjusting the 
compression weight. The manufacturing process is considered as a non-standard process. The tablet 
formulation is based on an amorphous solid dispersion of quizartinib dihydrochloride and 
hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) in a 1:10 ratio, mixed with microcrystalline cellulose and 
magnesium stearate to form the common final blend. The final blend is compressed to manufacture the 
core tablets which are then coated.  
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The starting point for the 
process development work was based on an initial risk assessment identifying the potential interactions 
between unit operations and critical quality attributes (CQAs). It was estimated what factors could be 
judged less important and what factors required further studies. All parameters relevant to QTPP were 
identified from an Ishikawa diagram, and analysed using a detailed risk assessment failure mode and

effects analysis (FMEA) approach to establish those process parameters (CPPs) associated with critical 
material attributes (CMAs) affecting the critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
The acceptance criteria for the critical material attributes, were determined by examination of the 
manufacturing capability of the Phase 3 clinical and registration stability batches and performance of 
structured experimental studies. The process understanding have been generated through prior 
knowledge and use of multivariate experimental plans (DoEs). To establish critical process parameters 
(CPPs), many potential–CPPs have been selected and studied with well described design of 
experiments (DoEs) (full factorial designs at two levels with centre points) and with well-defined 
ranges.  
The development of the dissolution method was conducted in two steps, the first step was the selection 
of the testing conditions and the second step was the evaluation of the discriminating power. To 
evaluate the discriminating power of the proposed dissolution method, studies assessing purposeful 
changes in the ratio of active substance to HPβCD in the SDD, crystallinity in the finished product and 
differences in tablet hardness and film coat level were conducted using quizartinib tablets 26.5 mg. 
The method is considered discriminatory.  
The choice of materials for the container and closure for spray dried dispersion intermediate, bulk 
tablets and finished product have been adequately justified with stability study. The primary packaging 
of the finished product is aluminium/aluminium perforated unit dose blisters. The material complies 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: manufacture of the amorphous solid dispersion 
intermediate, blending, tabletting and film-coating.  
Design spaces are proposed in the preparation of the amorphous solid dispersion and the tableting 
operations. Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for the relevant CPPs. The available 
development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully support the proposed PARs and Design Spaces. 
Formal process validation of the manufacturing process will be conducted post-approval. A process 
validation protocol summarising the full studies intended to be conducted at commercial scale, has 
been provided. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form; appearance, identification (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF) and microbiological 
quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market through traditional final product release testing. The 
specifications are in line with ICH Q6A and Ph. Eur. general monograph for film-coated tablets. The 
limits proposed for the specified impurity in the finished product at release and end of shelf-life are 
considered justified based on the available batch release and stability data and furthermore, the 
impurity is considered qualified and hence there is no safety concern. The limit for unspecified 
impurities is in line with ICH Q3B identification threshold (MDD 60 mg) and therefore acceptable. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 19/130 
 
 
 
proposed limits for total impurities in the tablets at release correspond to the maximum allowed 
content in spray-dried dispersion intermediate. 
A risk assessment for potential elemental impurities in quizartinib tablets has been performed 
according to ICH Q3D. No routine or monitoring tests for elemental impurities of the finished product 
are needed.  
The risk of carryover of any N-nitrosamine species from the quizartinib active substance is negligible as 
nitrous acid and nitrite salts are not used in the process. Additionally, the Raney Nickel reduction in 
Step 2 of the manufacturing process would eliminate any nitrosamines introduced prior to that step. In 
addition, for the finished product for all its components, manufacturing stages, and used packaging, no 
risks were identified for formation or contamination with nitrosamine impurities. And finally, quizartinib 
dihydrochloride tablets are intended for the treatment of patients with advance cancer under the scope 
of ICH S9. Therefore, in line with the principles of ICH M7 (R1), additional controls for nitrosamine 
impurities in the finished product, beyond those required under the ICH Q3 guidelines are not 
warranted. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for n=8 for 17.7 mg tablets, n=13 for 26.5 mg tablets batches 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product for each strength stored for up 
to 36 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of finished 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing and in addition in PCTFE/PVC//Al.  
Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, assay, impurities and water content. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. The stability results show relatively little degradation and only 
one impurity (AC012917) increases over time; this increase is more pronounced under accelerated 
conditions but its content remains within the specification limit. A similar trend is noticed for content in 
total impurities. As discussed above, a downward trend in dissolution results was observed on storage 
for product packaged in PCTFE/PVC//Al blisters. Nevertheless the product remained within specification 
at long term conditions. This slowing down of dissolution was not seen in product packed in the 
proposed Al/Al blisters. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products, and one batch was subjected to thermal cycling (freeze and thaw) 
study. 
The applicant proposed to calculate the shelf-life starting with compression of SDD with the other 
excipients. To support this proposal, the applicant has put on stability one batch of each strength of 
tablets manufactured from “aged” SDD (24 months, the shelf-life proposed for this intermediate). The 
data provided show a stability profile similar to the other stability batches; 24 months long term 
results are available. Based on this extended stability data, this approach to calculating the start of 
shelf-life can be accepted. The applicant further committed to continue for at least 3 years the stability 
programme on the tablets made with aged SDD.   
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 20/130 
 
 
 
Based on available stability data, the proposed finished product shelf-life of 3 years without special 
storage condition as stated in sections 6.3 and 6.4 of the SmPC, are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for two steps in the 
manufacture of the finished product. The design spaces have been adequately verified.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue, having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to stability data for the quizartinib tablets 17.7 mg and 
26.5 mg manufactured with aged SDD. This point is put forward and agreed as recommendation for 
future quality development. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used as proposed. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1. The applicant has committed to provide 3 years stability data for the quizartinib tablets 17.7 mg and 
26.5 mg manufactured with aged SDD. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacology 
2.5.1.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The applicant demonstrated the selectivity and potency of quizartinib to inhibit FTL3 in vitro: with a 
biochemical competition binding assay the biochemical potency and selectivity of quizartinib was 
determined against a panel of 441 kinases. Quizartinib binds with the highest affinity to FLT3 (Kd(WT) 
= 1.3 nM, Kd(ITD) = 9.4 nM) and with less affinity to KIT (Kd = 4.9 nM). It also binds to a few other 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 21/130 
 
 
 
class III RTKs including CSF1R/FMS (Kd = 9.6 nM), PDGFRα (Kd = 14 nM), and PDGFRβ (Kd = 8.4 
nM), and non-class III RTK, RET (Kd = 7.1 nM), and with lesser affinity to FLT1 (Kd = 44 nM), FLT4 
(Kd = 49 nM), and DDR1 (Kd = 81 nM). Thus, quizartinib is highly potent against the selected class III 
RTKs. Also AC886, a major metabolite of quizartinib, binds with the highest affinity to FLT3 (Kd(WT) = 
0.54 nM, Kd(ITD) = 5.8 nM) and with less affinity to KIT (Kd = 0.97 nM). It also binds to a few other 
class III RTKs including CSF1R/FMS (Kd = 8.6 nM), PDGFRα (Kd = 3.6 nM), and PDGFRβ (Kd = 1.8 
nM), and non-class III RTK, RET (Kd = 14 nM). 
Quizartinib at concentrations of 0.8 to 20 nM inhibited significantly the FLT3-ITD kinase activity (i.e., 
autophosphorylation) in MV4-11 cells, a human leukaemia cell line that expresses the FLT3-ITD 
mutation. Besides, quizartinib was found to be a highly potent inhibitor of FLT3-dependent cell 
proliferation in this MV4-11 cell line (IC50 = 0.3 nM) and to have more than a 1,000-fold weaker 
activity against the FLT3 independent cell proliferation of the RS4;11 control cell line. Near complete 
inhibition was observed at around 10 nM quizartinib or AC866. Similar inhibitory effects on FLT3 
phosphorylation and cell proliferation were reported for the major metabolite AC886. 
Resistance to quizartinib is related to mutations (F691L and D835) and reduction in SPRY3 or GSK3 
expression leading to re-activation of downstream FGF/Ras/ERK or Wnt signalling. 
In vivo, the pharmacology of quizartinib was tested in different mouse models. The temporal effect of 
quizartinib treatment on the expression of p-FLT3 and total FLT3 protein was examined in 
subcutaneous human leukaemia MV4-11 tumours in female mice. Mice were treated at 96 to 0.25 h 
prior to tumour collection with a single dose of 10 mg/kg quizartinib. Phosphorylated FLT3 and total 
FLT3 protein in tumour lysates were measured, and the ratio of p-FLT3 to total FLT3 (p/tFLT3 ratio) 
was calculated and normalised against the 0.25 h vehicle time point to report the normalised p/tFLT3 
ratio (i.e., the % p-FLT3). A time-dependent reduction of p-FLT3 was observed, and the maximal effect 
was at 1, 2, and 6 h post-dose with 6%, 4%, and 7% p-FLT3, respectively. Levels of % p-FLT3 
rebounded at 48 and 96 h post-dose, but levelled off at approximately 60%. 
The efficacy of quizartinib was also tested in a tumour xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, which were 
grown as subcutaneous tumours in female athymic nude mice. The mice were treated PO with 1, 3 and 
10 mg/kg/day quizartinib for 28 days. Quizartinib demonstrated a strong dose-dependent antitumour 
activity, already seen at 1 mg/kg/day. The activity was nearly maximal at 3 mg/kg/day and at 10 
mg/kg QD no tumour regrowth after dosing discontinuation and during the entire 32-day follow-up 
observation period was shown. No group mean body-weight loss or other toxicity was observed for any 
of the treatment groups. At a lower dose of 0.5 mg/kg for 10 days, tumour growth was inhibited by 
quizartinib, while a reduction in tumour volume was seen when quizartinib was combined with 
cytarabine and daunorubicin. 
In a disseminated engraftment model, the activity of quizartinib was determined using the non-obese 
diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice that were pre-treated with 
cyclophosphamide followed by intravenous administration of MV4-11 cells that disseminated to bone 
marrow. Then, the mice were treated PO with 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg/day quizartinib for 31 days or at 1 
or 10 mg/kg/day for 150 days (labelled “continuously”). Quizartinib dosed for 31 days at 0.1, 1, and 
10 mg/kg QD provided an increased life span (ILS) of 12%, 55%, and >250%, respectively, compared 
to vehicle. At 1 mg/kg/day, quizartinib dosed continuously for 150 days gave an ILS of 153% and 
provided a markedly higher survival advantage compared to 31-day dosing. The study was terminated 
prior to reaching 50% mortality in the 10 mg/kg/day continuous dosing group, yielding an ILS of 
>250%.

2.5.1.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Quizartinib did not show activity with an IC50 value below 2 μM against a diverse panel of 118 non-
kinase enzymes, receptors, channels, and transporters in a screen test, demonstrating its selectivity. 
A secondary pharmacodynamics screen has been performed for the metabolite AC886. A significant 
response of ≥50% inhibition at 10 μM was observed for acetyl cholinesterase, ACES (64%); sodium 
channel, site 2 (72%); and adenosine transporter (53%). The determination of IC50 or Ki is considered 
unnecessary given the unbound plasma levels of AC886 in patients around 3 nM.  
2.5.1.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies have been performed concerning the central nervous system and the 
respiratory functions. In the general toxicity studies, no effects on these organs were observed. 
In different in vitro models quizartinib showed clearly several effects on the cardiovascular system. 
However, due to the high protein binding profile of both quizartinib and its metabolite AC886 (≥99%), 
the unbound Cmax values for quizartinib and AC886 were estimated to be approximately 1%, and 
therefore, the concentration range of 1 to 30 μM were 100- to 10,000-fold higher than unbound Cmax 
values in human. In addition, dispersed canine cardiomyocytes were used for INa, and ICa-L assays. 
To overcome this difficulty, additional ion channel assays for hERG current, IKs, INa, INa,L, and ICa-L 
were conducted using cells stably expressing human genes. 
In hERG transfected HEK293 cells quizartinib and metabolite AC886 inhibited the potassium channels 
(IKr) significantly by 16% and 12% respectively at 3 µM. hKvLQT1/minK potassium channels 
expressed in HEK293 cells (IKs) were significantly inhibited to a maximum of 68% and 27% resp., with 
IC50s of ca. 0.3 µM and ca. 2.9 µM resp. Neither quizartinib nor AC886 showed significant inhibitory 
effects on sodium current INa and late sodium current INa,L at up to 3 μM in HEK293 cells and also not 
on cloned L-type calcium channels ICa-L expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. 
The effects of quizartinib on the cardiovascular system were determined in male cynomolgus monkeys 
using a telemetry system. The monkeys were dosed orally with 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg quizartinib and 
quizartinib resulted in QT prolongation at doses approximately 2 times the RHD of 53 mg/day based on 
Cmax. The NOAEL was approximately 0.4 times the RHD based on Cmax. Quizartinib primarily 
inhibited IKs with a maximum inhibition of 67.5% at 2.9 µM. The maximum inhibition of IKs by AC886 
was 26.9% at 2.9 µM. Quizartinib and AC886 at 3 μM statistically significantly inhibited hERG currents 
by 16.4% and 12.0%, respectively. Neither quizartinib nor AC886 inhibited INa, INa-L and ICa-L at 
any concentration tested. 
2.5.1.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with quizartinib have been conducted. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of quizartinib (AC220), its major and pharmacologically active metabolite 
AC886 have been investigated upon single dose intravenous (IV) or oral (PO) administration in mouse 
(nu/nu mice), rat (Sprague Dawley (SD), and Long Evans (pigmented)), dog (Beagle dogs) and 
monkey (Cynomolgus monkeys). Multiple dose toxicokinetics (TK) was examined upon daily oral 
administration, which is the intended clinical route. The majority of the doses were prepared using the 
same formulation as the one that was used in the pivotal toxicity studies, although radiolabelled drug 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 23/130 
 
 
 
was incorporated when appropriate. In addition, analytical methods for determination of quizartinib in 
formulations used to conduct single- and repeated-dose oral toxicology studies were validated. 
Methods of analysis 
Concentrations of quizartinib in rat, dog, and monkey plasma (EDTA), and its major metabolite AC886 
in rat and monkey plasma were determined by adequately validated methods (5 to 1000 ng/mL) of 
mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) or by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultraviolet 
(UV) detection (formulations) following solid phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction. Methods were 
validated for sensitivity, selectivity, carry over, linearity, accuracy, repeatability, precision, sample 
dilution analysis, and sample long-term stability. Metabolites were characterised and quantified by 
HPLC with radioactivity detection and their chemical structures were elucidated by LC-MS/MS and, 
when possible, co-elution with non-radiolabelled standards. Distribution and excretion were analysed 
by measuring radioactivity in samples of plasma, tissues, and excreta from animals dosed with 
[14C]quizartinib using liquid scintillation counting (LSC) and by quantitative whole-body 
autoradiography. Analytical methods using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with 
ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) method for the determination of quizartinib, spiked with impurities, 
formulated in 5% to 22% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) were validated for determination of 
quizartinib concentrations in solutions used to conduct single- and repeated-dose oral toxicology 
studies. 
Absorption 
In vitro membrane permeability of quizartinib through Caco-2 cell monolayers was moderate. P-gp (P-
Glycoprotein)(MDR1)-mediated transport of quizartinib was evaluated using MDR1-expressing cells 
(MDCKII-MDR1 cells). Based on transcellular transport in the Bl-to-Ap direction and inhibition by the P-
gp model inhibitors, quizartinib was considered to be a P-gp substrate. An in vitro study investigating 
BCRP-mediated transcellular transport in BCRP-expressing LLC-PK1 cells showed that the major human 
metabolite AC886 was a substrate for human BCRP, while quizartinib was not. 
Plasma exposure following single dose oral administration of quizartinib to mice was dose proportional 
in the dose range tested (0.1 – 300 mg/kg) as measured by AUCinf. Absorption was fast (Tmax 1-2h) 
and (apparent) elimination moderate (T1/2 ~4h). At the higher dose range (100 & 300 mg/kg) 
absorption was delayed leading to higher Tmax (4h) and 40-80% lower Cmax than expected based on 
the dose. In addition, the PK profiles suggest an increase of (apparent) elimination half-life with 
increasing dose cq quizartinib exposure to >20 h at the highest dose but elimination was only 
measured up to 24h after dosing. The PK of the major, active metabolite, AC886 was found to be 
comparable to the PK of quizartinib with a Cmax value of 0.77-fold and an exposure (AUCinf) of 0.95-
fold the values found with quizartinib. The exposure (Cmax and AUCinf) using 5% HPβCD was found to 
be about 2-fold higher than when using 22% HPβCD.  
Plasma exposure (Cmax, AUC) following single dose oral administration of quizartinib to rats was dose 
proportional in the dose range tested in both genders (3 – 30 mg/kg). Exposure in female rats was 
slightly higher (po 1.7-fold; IV 1.5-fold) than the values found in males. Absorption was fast (Tmax 1-
2h) with the lower doses and elimination moderate (T1/2 5-6h). At the higher dose range (100 & 300 
mg/kg) absorption was delayed leading to higher Tmax (4h) and, with the 300 mg/kg dose, a 50% 
lower Cmax than expected. In addition, the PK profiles suggest an increase of elimination half-life with 
increasing dose cq quizartinib exposure to >20 h at the highest dose but elimination was only 
measured up to 24h after dosing. Bioavailability (Fpo) was ~46% using 22% HPβCD as vehicle and 
food seemed to double the oral bioavailability. Clearance was found to be low (0.4 L/h.kg) and volume 
of distribution high (2.5-3.4 L/kg). The PK of the major, active metabolite, AC886 was found to be 
comparable to the PK of quizartinib with a Cmax value of 0.64-fold and an exposure (AUCinf) of 0.67-
fold the values found with quizartinib, indicating an incomplete metabolisation to AC886 in rats. When

the major metabolite AC886 was dosed to male rats, a low oral bioavailability (Fpo) of 6.9% was 
found. Terminal elimination half-life (T1/2 = 3.4-3.7h) was also lower than found when dosing with 
quizartinib indicating a faster clearance (metabolism) of AC886 than quizartinib. This may indicate that 
the formation of AC886 from quizartinib is the rate limiting step in the metabolic clearance of 
quizartinib. 
The PK profile of quizartinib upon multiple oral dose administration (1 and 10 mg/kg) to male and 
female rats was found to be comparable to single dose administration, with a slight increase in Tmax, 
and an about 2-fold increase in Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day28 as compared to Day1. Exposure (AUC) and 
Cmax was comparable in females and males. Elimination half-life could not be assessed properly as the 
last time point was at 24h post administration, but seemed to increase with repeated dosing and with 
dose level. The exposure of the major metabolite AC886 seemed to follow the quizartinib exposure and 
was slightly lower (0.7 – 1.0) with the low dose but the AC886/quizartinib ratio decreased with 
increasing dose and time (0.3). 
Plasma exposure (AUC) following single dose oral administration of quizartinib to dogs was dose 
proportional in the tested dose range (1 – 25 mg/kg). Exposure in females was about 1.5- to 2.7-fold 
higher than the values found in males. Absorption was fast (Tmax 1-2h) and elimination moderate (T1/2 
6-9h). At the highest dose tested (25 (M) & 10 (F) mg/kg) an increase of elimination half-life was 
found (T1/2 11h). Bioavailability (Fpo) was ~40% using HPβCD as vehicle. Clearance was found to be 
low (0.3 L/h.kg) and volume of distribution high (3.4 L/kg). 
Several (~17) different liquid and solid formulation vehicles were tested in the dog. The effect of food 
was variable and dependent on the formulation used. The AC886 exposure was dependent of the 
formulation used and varied from 0.08 to 0.56 the quizartinib exposure (AUCinf).  
Plasma exposure (Cmax, AUC) following single dose oral (3 mg/kg in 22% HPβCD) and intravenous (1 
mg/kg) administration of quizartinib was studied in male and female cynomolgus monkeys. Absorption 
was fast (Tmax 1.5h) but exposure modest with a low oral bioavailability of 14%, a short elimination 
half-life (T1/2 ~2h) and with a high clearance (1.7 L/h.kg) and volume of distribution (~5 L/kg). No 
gender difference was found. The PK of the major, active metabolite, AC886 was found to be 
comparable to the PK of quizartinib, but with higher plasma levels, i.e. Cmax value 3.5- to 6.5-fold and 
exposure (AUCinf) 7.9- to 9.2-fold quizartinib, indicating fast and extensive conversion to AC886 in the 
monkey.  
As compared to human, rat and dog, a fast conversion of quizartinib to AC886 was found in the 
monkey leading to a low exposure, a low T1/2 and a low oral bioavailability. The elimination half-life 
(T1/2) found in humans (73h) is longer than expected based on the mouse, rat and dog (4 – 7h). 
Accumulation of exposure (TK studies, AUC0-24) upon multiple dosing was low in dog (0.6-0.9x) and rat 
(1.2-2.7x), but 2.8-4.6x in monkey, which is not in line with the short (2 h) elimination half-life. In 
humans an accumulation ratio of 4.9 was found, which is in line with the higher elimination half-life (73 
h).  
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding (PPB) was determined by an ultracentrifugation method at 50, 500 and 2500 
ng/mL. Quizartinib and the main metabolite AC886 showed a very high PPB in the mouse, rat, dog, 
monkey and human (≥99%). Unbound quizartinib plasma concentration (Fu) seems to be about 3- and 
5-fold higher in human (1.0%) as compared to dog, monkey (0.3%) and rat or mouse plasma (0.2%) 
at the clinically relevant concentrations but it should be noted that the variance (CV%) of the 
measurement is high (9-36%). PPB of AC886 in dog plasma seemed to be concentration dependent 
showing with increasing concentrations a 3-fold increase in PPB. Unbound AC886 plasma concentration 
was 0.3% in human plasma as compared 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.6% in mouse, rat, monkey and 
Assessment report

dog, respectively, at the clinically relevant concentrations. Using equilibrium dialysis, quizartinib 
seemed to display a similar, very high, binding to an has (human serum albumin) containing buffer as 
to total plasma, but the poor solubility/low recovery may have confounded the results. The poor 
solubility of quizartinib in the presence of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAGP) suggests binding to AAGP 
is insufficient to keep the compound in solution. 
In human blood, the blood to plasma (B/P) ratio of quizartinib was >0.9, which is indicative of 
distribution or adsorption to the blood cells, and decreased from 1.48 to 0.97 with increasing blood 
concentrations (10 – 4000 ng/ml). A similar blood concentration dependent decline in B/P ratio was 
found for the major, active, metabolite AC886 (3.4 to 1.3). The higher B/P ratios for both compounds 
are indicative of higher red blood cell (RBC) compartmentalisation. At the clinically relevant plasma 
concentrations, the human B/P ratio is ~1.3 for quizartinib and ~3 for AC886. Therefore, it is 
concluded that quizartinib at clinically relevant concentrations is predominantly present in the red 
blood cell compartment (50%-70%), while for AC886 this is more than ~80%. The impact of 
quizartinib and AC886 concentration and haematocrit (20% – 50%) on blood/plasma partition was also 
investigated in human blood. The ratio of blood to plasma concentration values for quizartinib were 
relatively consistent at approximately 1.0 with a range of 0.79 to 1.30 with considerable overlap taken 
variability into consideration. The B/P values for AC886 ranged from 1.36 to 3.19 and demonstrated a 
trend for increase at lower blood concentrations and higher haematocrit levels. 
In blood partitioning tests, quizartinib and AC886 were spiked to rat, dog, and monkey blood and each 
blood sample was processed on ice or at 37°C for 2 h. In contrast to human blood, no time- or 
temperature-dependent partitioning of quizartinib and AC886 between the plasma and blood cell 
fractions were noted in rat and dog blood. On the other hand, in monkey blood AC886 concentrations 
were approximately 4-fold higher on ice than those at 37°C, whereas quizartinib concentrations was 
not affected by either on ice or at 37°C. The blood to plasma (B/P) ratios of quizartinib were not given 
but were calculated to be ~0.7 for rat and dog, i.e. 20% in RBC, and 1.0 for monkey and independent 
of concentration added (20 – 2000 ng/ml). The B/P ratio for AC886 was ~0.8 and 1.2 for rat and dog, 
respectively.  
Tissue distribution was investigated using QWBA in pigmented male Long-Evans (LE) and albino male 
and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats following administration of a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled 
quizartinib. A rapid and wide distribution of 14C-label was demonstrated in the rat, with maximum 
tissue concentrations at 2 h or 4 h post-dose (mostly Tissue/Plasma (T/P) ratio <10), with the 
exception of the testes (24 h). The highest concentrations of radioactivity were found in the contents 
of the alimentary canal (T/P ratio up to 31), while a moderate exposure (T/P ratio 4 – 9) was found in 
lung, adrenal, pancreas and in organs associated with metabolism and excretion (liver and kidney). At 
24h post dose, radioactivity was below 2-fold plasma Cmax in all tissues. In rats, quizartinib-related 
radioactivity following either IV or oral dosing crossed the blood brain barrier but, T/P levels were low 
(0.1 – 0.3) and radioactivity was not detected in CSF. Reproductive organs were included among the 
tissues examined, but no studies have been carried out regarding pregnant or nursing animals, 
studying placental transfer, foetal exposure or excretion in milk. 
In pigmented LE rats a similar distribution and decline of radioactivity over the course of the study was 
found, but elimination was incomplete at 336 h post-dose and measurable tissue concentrations were 
seen in eye uveal tract, meninges, small intestine, pigmented skin, adrenal gland, spleen, and liver at 
this time point. Binding to melanin was evident as pigmented skin accumulated about 9-fold more 
radioactivity than non-pigmented skin. The time course of distribution of radioactivity in the pigmented 
uvea of the eye and pigmented skin of Long-Evans rats suggested a reversible association of 
[14C]quizartinib-derived radioactivity with melanin with a tissue half-life of 348 h and 138 h, 
respectively.

Metabolism 
In vitro intrinsic clearance of quizartinib was low in rat, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes with a 
T1/2 >700 min and in mouse, rat and human liver microsomal incubations with T1/2 >60 min, while 
clearance was modest in dog liver microsomes (T1/2 33 min) and high in cynomolgus monkey liver 
microsomes (T1/2 19 min). In human liver S9 fraction 84% of quizartinib was unchanged after 60 min 
indicating also a low in vitro clearance.  
Using recombinant human CYP enzyme incubations, CYP3A4/5 was identified as the major CYP isoform 
responsible for the metabolism of quizartinib and of AC886. CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 isoforms appeared to have little contribution. AC886 formation from quizartinib 
was detected only with CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.  
A mass balance study in rats and dogs using 14C-labelled quizartinib (single dose, oral) showed that, as 
in humans, two main labelled peaks were detected in plasma, of which unchanged quizartinib 
accounted for 74% or 59% and the major human metabolite AC886 for 22% or 16% in rats or dogs, 
respectively. In addition, in dog plasma a morpholino N-oxide metabolite (22%), eluting at 42 min, 
was detected. 
In urine, 9 and 7-20 14C-labelled peaks, which included quizartinib and AC886, were detected in rat 
and dog, respectively, with in total 1.4% and only 0.5% of administered 14C-labelled quizartinib. In 
both rat and dog faeces almost 90% of 14C-label was found, consisting of at least 15 - 22 14C-labelled 
peaks, including unchanged quizartinib (rat 22% & dog 34%), AC886 (8.5% & 13%), M40.1 (12% & 
5%, morpholino N-oxidation), M25.7 (6% & 10%, isoxazole-ring opening) and M23.4 (11%, rat only). 
The other peaks were below 5%. No gender differences were found.  
Results from an unlabelled study performed in bile cannulated rat indicated that in bile 6.0% of 
unchanged compound was found. In addition to M19 and M1 (AC886), several other metabolites were 
detected. Metabolite profiling indicated that the major metabolic pathways for quizartinib include 
oxidation (M19’, M1/AC886) and conjugation (M1-sulphate) of the isoxazole moiety, and oxidation 
(M14, M49, M38) and cleavage (M2’, M49, M48) of the morpholino group, which is consistent with 
metabolic pathways in humans. 
Excretion 
Excretion was determined in [14C]quizartinib mass balance studies in rats, dogs at 168 h and humans 
at 336 h post-dose. Total recovery was high in rat (95%) and dog (91%) at 168 h post-dose, and 78% 
in humans at 336 h. Quizartinib was found to be primarily excreted as metabolites via faeces in both 
animals and humans. In rats and dogs, these ADME studies showed that less than 2% of total 
quizartinib-related radioactivity was recovered from the urine, while more than 89% of radioactivity 
was recovered, via biliary excretion, in faeces. In humans, urinary excretion was also low (<2%), while 
76% was recovered in faeces. 
2.5.3.  Toxicology 
2.5.3.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity was assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs and cynomolgus monkeys up 
to 300 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg quizartinib dihydrochloride respectively. Mortality only 
occurred in female rats treated with ≥150 mg/kg. In dogs, no severe treatment-related findings were 
observed, with the exception of slight bodyweight loss in the female dog treated with ≥40 mg/kg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 27/130 
 
 
 
 
Bodyweight loss was also observed in monkeys treated with ≥100 mg/kg, accompanied with reduced 
food intake and soft/loose/liquid faeces. 
2.5.3.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs and cynomolgus 
monkeys given quizartinib dihydrochloride for up to 13 weeks, including a 4-week recovery period for 
all pivotal studies. Exposure levels to quizartinib were low for dogs (13 weeks, up to 10 mg/kg/day, 
margin-of-exposure (MOE): 1.14-1.59) and monkeys (13 weeks, up to 12 mg/kg/day, MOE: 0.52-
0.98) and relatively higher in rats (13 weeks, up to 10mg/kg/day, MOE: 7.90-10.37).  
Quizartinib-related observations were observed in principal target organs such as the bone marrow and 
lymphoid organs in all three species, accompanied by related haematological and clinical chemistry 
parameters. Dose-dependent bone marrow hypocellularity correlated with decreased white and red 
blood cell indices in rats treated with ≥3 mg/kg/day, dogs treated with 15 mg/kg/day and monkeys 
treated with ≥10/6 mg/kg/day. In both dogs and monkeys these observations mainly recovered, 
where as in rats these observations only partially resolved after a 30-day recovery period. NOAELs for 
severe haematopoietic inhibition are 3 mg/kg/day for rats (MOE: 1.42-1.51) and monkeys (MOE: 0.07-
0.10) and 5 mg/kg/day for dogs (MOE: 0.41-0.54). These effects on haematopoietic tissues can be 
interpreted as exaggerated pharmacology and are likely relevant for humans. 
Lymphoid atrophy in the thymus was observed in a dose-dependent manner in all three species in the 
pivotal studies (13 weeks, rats and dogs treated with ≥1 mg/kg/day, monkeys treated with ≥10 
mg/kg/day). In addition, lymphoid atrophy in the spleen was also observed in monkeys treated with 
≥10 mg/kg/day (28 days) and ≥3 mg/kg/day (13 weeks). Rats treated with 60/30 mg/kg/day and 
dogs treated with ≥ 50/25 mg/kg/day also showed splenic lymphoid atrophy, but not in the 13 weeks 
study. These observations were reversible in all species after a 4-week recovery period. 
Liver toxicity appeared in all species. Rats treated with ≥15 mg/kg/day for 28 days or ≥3 mg/kg/day 
for 13 weeks only demonstrated elevated liver enzyme (AST/ALP/ALT) levels, but no histological 
changes in the liver. In monkeys, 28 days treatment at the high dose also led to elevated liver 
enzymes, but additional increases in bilirubin levels and histological changes (single cell/centrilobular 
necrosis, hepatocellular vacuolation) were only observed in monkeys after 13 weeks. Dogs showed 
elevated AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin levels when treated with ≥50/25 mg/kg/day for 28 days or 15 
mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. This was accompanied with single cell necrosis, sinusoidal cell activation and 
hepatocellular vacuolation. NOAELs for hepatotoxicity are 5 mg/kg/day for rats (MOE: 0.96-1.01), 3 
mg/kg/day for monkeys (MOE: 0.07-0.10) and 5 mg/kg/day for dogs (MOE: 0.41-0.54). Liver is a 
target organ of toxicity, likely relevant for humans. Birefringent crystal depositions in the dog liver and 
rat kidney were observed in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies. The crystals found in the dog liver 
and rat kidney were considered composed of quizartinib and several metabolites (53 in dog; 17 in rat), 
without significant protein components. 
Reversible tubular basophilia without any clinical chemistry correlates was also observed in the kidney 
of dogs treated with ≥ 50/25 mg/kg/day for 28 days and ≥1 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. In addition, all 
male dogs treated with 15 mg/kg/day showed non-birefringent renal tubular pigment deposits. Similar 
situation has been observed in Rats. Elevated urea and creatinine levels were observed in monkeys 
treated with ≥ 3 mg/kg/day, but no correlating histological changes in the kidneys were observed at 
any dose level. NOAELs for renal toxicity are 3 mg/kg/day for rats (MOE: 1.42-1.51) and 30/12 
mg/kg/day monkeys (MOE: 0.52-0.98) and 15 mg/kg/day for dogs (MOE: 0.52-0.92). Kidney is a 
target organ of toxicity, likely relevant for humans.

Toxicity in reproductive organs was also observed in rats and monkeys. Male rats treated with 60/30 
mg/kg/day for 28 days or 10 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks showed germ cell necrosis and atrophy of the 
seminiferous epithelium in the testes accompanied by aspermia in the epidydimides observed at 
approximately 8 times the recommended human dose (RHD) based on AUC. This was also observed for 
male monkeys treated with ≥10/6 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks observed at approximately 0.5 times the 
RHD based on AUC and for both species this finding was not observed after a 4-week recovery period. 
Female rats treated with ≥ 1 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks showed non-reversible abnormal epithelial 
mucification of the vagina and when treated with ≥ 3 mg/kg/day ovarian cysts. In female rats, ovarian 
cysts and vaginal mucosal modifications were observed at doses approximately 10 times the RHD 
based on AUC. Female monkeys showed reversible atrophy of the uterus, ovary and vagina at ≥10/6 
mg/kg/day for 13 weeks observed at doses approximately 0.3 times the RHD based on AUC. NOAELs 
for reproductive organ toxicity are 3 mg/kg/day for rats (MOE: 1.42-1.51) and monkeys (MOE: 0.07-
0.10) and 15 mg/kg/day for dogs (MOE: 0.52-0.92).  
2.5.3.3.  Genotoxicity 
The genotoxic potential of quizartinib was evaluated in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, mammalian 
cell (mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase) mutagenicity assay, chromosome aberration assay in human 
lymphocytes, rat bone marrow micronucleus assays following a single or 28-day repeat oral dosing of 
quizartinib, and a transgenic rodent (TGR) mutation assay (Big Blue Assay in Fisher 344 rats). 
Quizartinib tested positive in the bacterial reverse mutation assay in strains TA98 and TA100, but was 
negative in the chromosome aberration assay, mammalian cell mutation and in the single dose rat 
bone marrow micronucleus assay. A rat micronucleus assay conducted in conjunction with the 28-day 
general toxicology study had an equivocal result, as there were significant increases in micronucleated 
immature erythrocytes. However, these were within the range of historical controls. The second in vivo 
assay, TGR assay was negative, which overrules the positive in vitro findings in the Ames test.  
2.5.3.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Quizartinib is intended to be administered in patients with advanced cancers; therefore, carcinogenicity 
studies are not deemed necessary consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite 
Guideline S9, “Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals” (ICH S9, 2009).  
2.5.3.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Embryo-foetal toxicity studies were conducted in a dose range-finding study and a definitive GLP study 
in time mated SD rats from Gestation Day (GD) 6 to GD 17, the period of organogenesis. Foetal 
toxicity was evident at 6 mg/kg/day, primarily consisting of lower foetal weights and effects on skeletal 
ossification. Teratogenicity was also observed at the same dose as evidenced by high incidence of 
foetal malformations (anasarca). Foetotoxicity and teratogenicity were observed at doses 
approximately 3 times the RHD based on AUC. The NOAEL is 2 mg/kg/day (MOE: 0.53) for general 
toxicity and reproduction in dams and for embryo-foetal development.  
The juvenile toxicity studies were conducted in a dose range-finding and definitive studies in juvenile 
male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. This study identified no other findings as observed in adult rats. 
Primary target organs were the bone marrow and male reproductive organs. The NOAEL was set at 0.3 
mg/kg/day for juvenile rats (MOE: 0.07). The juvenile toxicity studies are not relevant for the current 
application for adult patients only.

2.5.3.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
2.5.3.7.  Local tolerance  
No specific animal studies have been conducted to evaluate local tolerance since quizartinib is intended 
to be used by oral treatment. Quizartinib was tested for antigenicity in guinea pigs and based on the 
results not considered to be a contact sensitiser in guinea pigs. Due to a low potential for physical and 
physiological addition, no dependence studies were conducted with quizartinib. 
2.5.3.8.  Other toxicity studies 
The potential toxicities of 5 impurities (AB200631, AC016778, AC016679, AC016928 and AC012917) 
were evaluated in a 28-day repeat dose oral toxicity study in rats (Study No. 1258-023). In the study, 
quizartinib spiked with impurities induced some changes including decreased thymus, spleen, and 
testes weights and increased ALT/AST values. Although it was considered to be related to the addition 
of impurities, they were concluded to be non-adverse.  
Considering phototoxicity, while it is possible that quizartinib accumulates in melanin-containing 
tissues after repeated administration of quizartinib at the dosage and administration for which the 
application is being filed, quizartinib was concluded not to have phototoxic potential; no treatment-
related changes were seen either in ophthalmology or histopathology of the eye or skin in rats, dogs, 
or cynomolgus monkeys; and the frequency of Grades ≥3 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
SOC, eye disorders SOC, and potentially relevant clinical findings was low. Therefore, the risk of 
quizartinib-induced phototoxicity in patients is considered low. 
Ocular and dermal irritation studies were conducted in rabbits to support workplace safety. Based on 
the results, quizartinib is considered to be a mild irritant to ocular tissue of the rabbit and a slight 
irritant to the skin of the rabbit.

Conclusions on studies for quizartinib 
Quizartinib is not PBT, nor vPvB. 
The ERA cannot be finalised since a chronic, fish reproduction study is missing. 
The applicant has provided a commitment to submit the ongoing OECD 240 study and an updated ERA 
as soon as the study is finalised. The sediment risk assessment should be based on test results that 
are not normalised to organic carbon content and the PECsediment should be calculated using the highest 
Kf soil (not normalised).

2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The inhibition of tumour cell growth, through inhibition of FLT3-ITD kinase activity (i.e. 
phosphorylation) was demonstrated on MV4-11 AML cell line, after treatment with quizartinib or AC866 
compared the RS4;11 cell line (full FLT3). The effects were more marked in the MV4-11 cell line 
compared to RS4;11 and the IC50 of quizartinib was 0.3 nM. Quizartinib binds with high affinity not 
only to FLT3 but also, albeit with less affinity, to KIT and RET. The active metabolite AC886 binds with 
high affinity not only to FLT3 but also, although with less affinity, to KIT and PDGFRβ. Inhibition of 
these other kinases are likely to play a minor role in the efficacy of quizartinib. 
Four in vivo studies have been provided on MV4-11 model in mice, 3 with a localised model and 1 on a 
disseminated one. In the localised tumour models, a time–dependent reduction of phosphorylated FLT3 
was retrieved after administration of quizartinib as a single dose, and the maximal effect was reached 
at 6h post dose (7% of p-FLT3). However, the method to determine expression could not be assessed 
as the provided SOP for p/tFLT3 determination only lists materials. A rebound in p-FLT3 was observed 
starting at 48h post dose. Dose-dependent inhibition of quizartinib of tumour growth was 
demonstrated from 1 to 10 mg/kg, on a 28-day treatment and no regrowth until 32 days after 
discontinuation of quizartinib dihydrochloride was observed. At a lower dose of 0.5 mg/kg for 10 days, 
tumour growth was inhibited by quizartinib, while a reduction in tumour volume was seen when 
quizartinib was combined with cytarabine and daunorubicin. In the disseminated MV4-11 model, 
quizartinib demonstrated efficacy by prolonged survival rate correlated with delayed disease onset, as 
measured by clinical signs and detection of circulating MV4-11 cells in peripheral blood and bone 
marrow. The efficacy of quizartinib was superior after 150 days treatment as compared to 31 days of 
treatment in NOD/SCID mice subcutaneously inoculated with MV4-11.  
Any secondary pharmacodynamic interaction of quizartinib or AC886 as tested against a diverse panel 
of 118 non-kinase enzymes, receptors, channels, and transporters has shown the high selectivity of 
quizartinib and its major metabolite (AC886) and any other interaction has been considered not 
clinically relevant. 
Besides mutations in FLT3 leading to resistance, there is a theoretical possibility of strong CYP3A4 
inducers and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors resulting in altered concentrations quizartinib in the bone 
marrow, which might lead to dose adjustments. 
It appears that both quizartinib and AC886 induced blockade of hERG current and IKs, and thereby 
caused QT prolongation by a decrease in the net repolarisation currents also at lower concentrations 
than measured before. The effect on IKs was more dominant than that on hERG current. The IKs IC50 
of quizartinib of 0.3 µM (ca. 168 ng/ml) is between the human Cmax at 60 mg of 112 ng/ml (Day 1) 
and 487 ng/ml (Day15) and could therefore be relevant. Although no account is given here for the high 
protein binding of the compound and its metabolite, clear effects on QT prolongation have been seen in 
humans and is marked as a possible side effect which could increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias 
or torsade de pointes. 
The pharmacokinetic behaviour of quizartinib was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats, Beagle dogs and 
Cynomolgus monkeys upon IV and oral administration and, only after oral administration, in nu/nu 
mice. Repeat dose toxicokinetics (TK) was studied upon 4 and 13 week oral dosing in rat, dog and 
monkey. 
The IV pharmacokinetics in rat and dog was characterised by low plasma clearance values (0.4 L/h.kg) 
but was high in monkey (1.7 L/h.kg). The volume of distribution was high in all preclinical species, with 
values ranging from 2.9 to 4.8 L/kg. The terminal elimination half-life ranged from 4 h in mouse, 5 h in 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 32/130 
 
 
 
 
rat, 7 h in dog and 2 h in monkey, which is much lower than the terminal elimination half-life of 73 h 
found in human.  
Oral absorption was moderately fast in all preclinical species with peak concentrations occurring about 
1-4, 2-4, 1-2 and ~2 hours after dosing in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, respectively, and increased 
with increasing dose or administration. In general, no gender differences were found. An in vitro study 
investigating BCRP-mediated transcellular transport in BCRP-expressing LLC-PK1 cells showed that the 
major human metabolite AC886 was a substrate for human BCRP, while quizartinib was not. The 
applicant will investigate in vitro if quizartinib is an inhibitor of BCRP at the highest concentration 
possible to elucidate if quizartinib is an inhibitor of BCRP at maximal intestinal concentrations. 
Oral bioavailability from a HPβCD solution formulation, which was used in the toxicity studies, was 
45% in rat and 41% in dog but only 14% in monkey. No large food effect was found in rats and dogs 
using the HPβCD formulation but this was variable and depended on the formulation used. In humans 
no food effect was found. Accumulation of exposure upon multiple dosing was low in dog (0.6-0.9x) 
and rat (1.2-2.7x) but 2.8-4.6x in monkey, which is not in line with the short (2 h) elimination half-life. 
In humans an accumulation ratio of 4.9 was found.  
Plasma protein binding (PPB) of quizartinib was extremely high across all species examined, including 
human (>99%). Unbound quizartinib plasma concentration (Fu) at the clinically relevant 
concentrations seems to be about 3- and 5-fold higher in human (1.0%) as compared to dog, monkey 
(0.3%) and rat or mouse plasma (0.2%). The major human metabolite AC886 was also highly protein 
bound (>99%). Unbound AC886 plasma concentration was 0.3% in human plasma at the clinically 
relevant concentrations as compared 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.6% in mouse, rat, monkey and dog, 
respectively. In addition, quizartinib has preferential partitioning into red blood cells in monkey (blood 
to plasma (B/P) ratio 1.0) and human (1.3) but less in rat or dog (B/P 0.7). More prominent results 
were found with AC886 with B/P ratios of 3.0, 0.8 and 1.2 for human, rat and dog, respectively. 
Biotransformation of quizartinib in rat, dog and human primarily involves enzymatic oxidation but was 
low in plasma, and unchanged quizartinib was the primary drug-related component in rat (74%), dog 
(59%) and in human (77%). In addition, in humans, AC886 was identified as the major, active, human 
metabolite, representing 16% of total exposure. AC886 is also present in plasma of preclinical 
toxicology species (22 & 16% in rat & dog) in vivo. In dog, also a morpholino N-oxide metabolite 
(22%) was found. The exposure (AUC) ratio of AC886/quizartinib upon single dosing was 0.9 in 
mouse, 0.7 in rat and 0.2 in dog and human but 8.6 in monkey. Upon multiple dosing, 
AC886/quizartinib ratio decreased with increasing dose and time in the rat (0.3) but increased in 
human (0.6). In vitro metabolism experiments showed that quizartinib, and AC886, showed a slow, 
limited metabolism, predominantly by CYP3A4/3A5. 
Excretion of [14C]-labelled quizartinib and associated radioactivity via faeces (biliary excretion) was the 
major route of elimination in the tested preclinical species (rat and dog) and also in human.  
Renal clearance plays a minimal role (<2%) in all species. 
The toxicological profile of quizartinib has been evaluated during single and repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. The main target organs are bone marrow, liver and 
kidney with less severe effects on the thymus, and reproductive organs (ovary, vagina and testes). 
The main safety concerns identified during non-clinical studies include QTc prolongation, 
myelosuppression, lymphoid depletion, gastrointestinal toxicity, and liver and kidney function 
abnormalities. Those effects are usually retrieved for oncolytic agents; more specifically, bone marrow 
and lymphoid tissues are the main targets in AML therapy. Birefringent crystal depositions in the dog 
liver and rat kidney were observed in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies.

Quizartinib underwent a complete genotoxicity tests battery in vitro and in vivo, with respect to gene 
mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells. The Ames test was positive, when quizartinib was tested at 
dose level up to the maximum recommended dose (5000 µg/plate) with or without metabolic 
activation, in contrast to its negative result mammalian cell mutation (mouse lymphoma thymidine 
kinase) assay. Quizartinib was negative in a chromosome aberration assay or in a single dose rat bone 
marrow micronucleus assay. In human lymphocytes, no increases in chromosomal aberration were 
observed in absence or presence of metabolic activation at all concentrations tested. No increases in 
micronucleus frequency were found in micronucleus assays in rat as a single dose, PO at dosage levels 
up to 100 mg/kg (next to the MTD). Micronucleus assay conducted in conjunction with the 28-day 
toxicity study in rats showed a slight but statistically significant increase in the incidence of 
micronucleated immature erythrocytes. However, none of the individual values or the group means fell 
outside the historical control range. It appears that no exposure data are available for micronucleus 
study (single dose), but exposure was assessed during 28-day micronucleus study and some margin of 
exposure exist in rats. A further in vivo transgenic rodent mutation assay was conducted in Fisher 344 
Big Blue rats. The assay was negative, indicating no mutagenic potential of quizartinib in this model, 
which overrules the positive in vitro findings in the Ames test. Exposure was not assessed in this 
assay, and no TK is available for this strain of rats. Sufficient exposure at the high dose can be 
assumed however, based on TK from SD rats. Overall, it can be concluded that quizartinib has low 
genotoxic potential. 
Quizartinib is intended to be administered in patients with advanced cancers; therefore, carcinogenicity 
studies are not deemed necessary consistently with International Conference on Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite 
Guideline S9, “Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals” (ICH S9, 2009). The lack of 
dedicated carcinogenicity studies is acceptable. 
Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with quizartinib. However, adverse findings in 
male and female reproductive systems were observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and 
monkeys. In female rats, ovarian cysts and vaginal mucosal modifications were observed at doses 
approximately 10 times the RHD based on AUC. Findings in female monkeys included atrophy of the 
uterus, ovary, and vagina; observed at doses approximately 0.3 times the RHD based on AUC. In male 
rats, testicular seminiferous tubular degeneration and failure of sperm release were observed at 
approximately 8 times the RHD based on AUC. Findings in male monkeys included germ cell depletion 
in the testes; observed at approximately 0.5 times the RHD based on AUC. After a four-week recovery 
period, all these findings except the vaginal mucosal modifications in the female rats were reversible. 
In embryo foetal reproductive toxicity studies, embryo foetal lethality and increased post-implantation 
loss were observed at maternally toxic doses. Foetotoxicity (lower foetal weights, effects on skeletal 
ossification) and teratogenicity (foetal abnormalities including oedema) were observed at doses 
approximately 3 times the RHD based on AUC. Quizartinib is considered to be potentially teratogenic. 
No pre- and postnatal studies were performed. Considering the patient population, this is agreed. 
Based on these data and as a general warning women of childbearing potential should undergo 
pregnancy testing within 7 days before starting treatment with quizartinib, should use effective 
contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months after the last dose. Male patients with female 
partners of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with quizartinib 
and for at least 4 months after the last dose. 
The potential toxicities of 5 impurities were evaluated in a 28-day repeat dose oral toxicity study in 
rats (Study No. 1258-023). In the study, quizartinib spiked with impurities induced some changes 
including decreased thymus, spleen, and testes weights and increased ALT/AST values. Although it was 
considered to be related to the addition of impurities, they were concluded to be non-adverse. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023

Considering phototoxicity, while it is possible that quizartinib accumulates in melanin-containing 
tissues after repeated administration of quizartinib at the dosage and administration for which the 
application is being filed, quizartinib was concluded not to have phototoxic potential; no treatment-
related changes were seen either in ophthalmology or histopathology of the eye or skin in rats, dogs, 
or cynomolgus monkeys; and the frequency of Grades ≥3 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
SOC, eye disorders SOC, and potentially relevant clinical findings was low. Therefore, the risk of 
quizartinib-induced phototoxicity in patients is considered low. 
With respect to the environmental risk assessment (ERA), it is concluded that Quizartinib is not PBT, 
nor vPvB. The ERA, however, cannot be finalised since a chronic, fish reproduction study is missing. 
The applicant has provided a commitment to submit the ongoing OECD 240 study and an updated ERA 
as soon as the study is finalised. The sediment risk assessment should be based on test results that 
are not normalised to organic carbon content and the PECsediment should be calculated using the highest 
Kf soil (not normalised). 
2.5.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of quizartinib are sufficiently 
evaluated and described. There are no remaining issues from a non-clinical point of view. There is a 
commitment regarding the Environmental Risk Assessment as reported in the discussion above. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Quizartinib is administered (as quizartinib dihydrochloride) in combination with standard chemotherapy 
at a dose of 35.4 mg (2 × 17.7 mg) once daily for two weeks in each cycle of induction. For patients 
who achieve complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete haematologic recovery 
(CRi), quizartinib is administered at 35.4 mg once daily for two weeks in each cycle of consolidation 
chemotherapy followed by quizartinib single-agent maintenance therapy initiated at 26.5 mg once 
daily. After two weeks the maintenance dose is increased to 53 mg (2 × 26.5 mg) once daily if the QT 
interval corrected by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) is ≤ 450 ms. Single-agent maintenance therapy may 
be continued for up to 36 cycles. 
The starting dose should be reduced to 17.7 mg once daily when quizartinib is given in combination 
with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. The drug product is an immediate release, solid oral dosage form film-
coated tablet. The tablets are available in two strengths, 17.7 mg and 26.5 mg free base.

Data 
The following studies in healthy volunteers were included: AC220-014, AC220-015, AC220-016, 
AC220-018, AC220-A-U105. The following studies in patients were included: 2689-CL-0005, 2689-CL-
0011, 2689-CL-2004, AC220-A-J101, AC220-A-J102, AC220-A-J201, AC220-007 and AC220-A-U302. 
During the analysis, observations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were excluded. The 
observed and predicted quizartinib and AC886 concentrations associated with absolute conditional 
weighted residuals (CWRES) >5 were excluded from the data set to avoid undue influence of outliers. 
A total of 1710 observations were excluded for quizartinib and 2499 for AC886. A PopPK model was 
developed with a total of 14160 quizartinib and 13399 AC886 observations following oral 
administration of quizartinib from 932 subjects (273 healthy subjects and 659 patients). 
Population pharmacokinetic model 
A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using non-linear mixed effects modelling software 
(NONMEM, version 7.4.4). Model evaluation was conducted using standard goodness-of-fit plots and 
numerical diagnostics. The PK of quizartinib was best described by a three-compartment model with 
sequential zero- and first-order absorption and a first-order elimination from the central compartment 
(see figure 2).

PBPK modelling was performed to predict the drug-drug interaction (DDI) between quizartinib and the 
substrates of UGT1A1. The base PBPK model was developed based on a combination of in vitro and 
clinical PK data of a single IV 50 μg dose of 14C-quizartinib and an oral 53 mg dose of quizartinib in 
healthy subjects (study AC220-A-U107). The model was further validated using clinical data after 
multiple dosing of quizartinib to AML patients (study 2689-CL-2004). Simulated PK profiles, AUCinf or 
AUCtau, and Cmax of quizartinib following a single dose of 26.5 to 53 mg to healthy subjects and repeat 
oral doses of 26.5 mg once daily and 53 mg once daily to AML subjects were within 2-fold of observed 
data. The developed quizartinib PBPK model was used to predict the DDI potential between quizartinib 
and raltegravir (built-in PBPK model in Simcyp Simulator version 20). 
Exposure-response modelling 
The overall aim of the exposure-response analysis was to further support the quizartinib dosing 
regimen. The exposure-response relationships were evaluated for: 
• 
Efficacy: overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS) based on the definition of induction 
treatment failure as failure to achieve complete remission (CR) within 42 days from the start of 
the last cycle of induction chemotherapy, and remission rate defined as CR, CR with minimal 
residual disease (MRD) negativity, composite CR (CRc), CRc with MRD negativity. 
•  Safety: Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) and the first occurrence of treatment emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade, TEAEs of grade greater or equal to 3, serious TEAEs, 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction/interruption, TEAEs leading to dose discontinuation, events in 
the torsade de pointes (TdP)/QT prolongation Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ), infection, 
haemorrhages, hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression. Additionally, a graphical exploration of 
the relationship between QT and the interval between two R waves on electrocardiogram (ECG) 
(RR) was performed to investigate if the QT interval appropriately shortens at high heart rates 
after quizartinib treatment. 
The exposure-response modelling was mainly performed for study AC220-A-U302. A total of 268 
patients treated with placebo and 244-263 patients treated with quizartinib were included for the 
efficacy and safety evaluation. The exposure metrics for quizartinib in plasma were derived using the 
empirical Bayes estimates of the individual PK parameters based on the final population PK model. The 
exposure metric was defined as predicted quizartinib AUC0-24,ss following 40 mg once daily in the 
induction phase. Overall survival was found to be related to quizartinib exposure. No exposure-
response relationship was identified for remission rate and EFS based on the definition of induction 
treatment failure as failure to achieve CR within 42 days from the start of the last cycle of induction 
chemotherapy. NPM1 mutation was found to be associated with significantly higher rates of CR and 
CRc, irrespectively of quizartinib treatment. An Emax model best described the relationship between 
quizartinib concentration and QTcF. No exposure-response relationship was identified for the 
probability of the first occurrence of TEAEs of any grade, TEAEs of grade greater or equal to 3, serious 
TEAEs, TEAEs leading to dose reduction/interruption, TEAEs leading to dose discontinuation, events in 
the TdP/QT prolongation SMQ, infection, haemorrhages, hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression. 
Analytical 
Quizartinib  and  AC886  were  measured  in  plasma  using  a  sufficiently  validated  LC-MS/MS  method. 
Furthermore, validated analytical methods were developed for the determination of quizartinib and its 
metabolites in urine and faeces.

Absorption 
The in vitro permeability of quizartinib in Caco-2 cells was 0.981 × 10-6 cm/s at a concentration of 
10 µM suggesting that quizartinib is a low permeable compound. This was confirmed in an in vitro 
study using MDCK cells. 
Following oral single dose administration under fasted conditions, the absolute oral bioavailability of a 
53 mg dose was ~71% and ranged from 58% to 79% for the different individuals. 
The time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) of quizartinib is approximately 4 hours in 
healthy volunteers independent of the dose. At a dose of 26.5 mg quizartinib, the mean maximum 
concentration (Cmax) ranged from 89 to 105 ng/mL and the mean exposure (AUCinf) ranged from 5909 
to 9626 ng ×h/mL. At a dose of 53 mg quizartinib, the mean maximum concentration (Cmax) ranged 
from 178 to 238 ng/mL and the mean exposure (AUCinf) ranged from 10899 to 25900 ng ×h/mL. 
Plasma concentration – time curve is shown in Figure 3.

following single oral dose administration of 26.5 mg, 53 mg and 79.5 mg quizartinib (30 mg, 
60 mg, and 90 mg quizartinib dihydrochloride) 
For the major metabolite AC886, the mean tmax ranged from 5 to 6 hours. At a dose of 26.5 mg 
quizartinib, the mean Cmax ranged from 13 to 32 ng/mL and the mean AUCinf ranged from 1970 to 
3560 ng ×h/mL. At a dose of 53 mg quizartinib, the mean Cmax ranged from 34.4 to 51.3 ng/mL and 
the mean AUCinf ranged from 4550 to 6278 ng ×h/mL. At clinically relevant doses of 26.5 and 53 mg, 
the parent-metabolite ratio is approximately 0.39 for the AUC and 0.21 for the Cmax in healthy 
subjects. Plasma concentration – time curve is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Arithmetic mean (±SD) plasma concentration-time profiles for AC886 following 
single oral dose administration of 26.5 mg, 53 mg and 79.5 mg quizartinib (30 mg, 60 mg, 
and 90 mg quizartinib dihydrochloride) 
No data was provided on the intra-individual variability in healthy volunteers. The inter-individual 
variability is 25 to 82% for quizartinib and 26 to 83% for AC886. Quizartinib and AC886 Cmax and AUC 
are dose proportional over a dose range of 26.5 to 79.5 mg quizartinib in healthy volunteers. Based on 
the half-lives of quizartinib and AC886 (63 to 136 h for quizartinib and 54 to 135 h for AC886) and the 
once daily dosing, accumulation is expected with once daily dosing to healthy volunteers. 
The 17.7 mg dose was only investigated in the patient population. No PK data are available in healthy 
volunteers following the clinical starting dose of 35.4 mg or following repeated dosing. However, since 
the PK is dose proportional for quizartinib and AC886 over the dose range of 26.5 mg to 79.5 mg 
quizartinib, the PK for the clinical dose can be calculated.  
Based on population pharmacokinetic modelling in newly diagnosed AML patients, at 35.4 mg/day, 
steady state during induction therapy, the geometric mean (%CV) Cmax of quizartinib and AC886 was 
estimated to be 140 ng/mL (71%) and 163 ng/mL (52%), respectively, and the geometric mean 
(%CV) AUC0-24h was 2,680 ng•h/mL (85%) and 3,590 ng•h/mL (51%), respectively.  
During consolidation therapy at 35.4 mg/day, steady state, the geometric mean (%CV) Cmax of 
quizartinib and AC886 was estimated to be 204 ng/mL (64%) and 172 ng/mL (47%), respectively, and 
the geometric mean (%CV) AUC0-24h was 3,930 ng•h/mL (78%) and 3,800 ng•h/mL (46%), 
respectively. 
During maintenance therapy at 53 mg/day, steady state, the geometric mean (%CV) Cmax of 
quizartinib and AC886 was estimated to be 529 ng/mL (60%) and 262 ng/mL (48%), respectively, and 
the geometric mean (%CV) AUC0-24h was 10 200 ng•h/mL (75%) and 5 790 ng•h/mL (46%), 
respectively. 
Distribution 
Quizartinib and AC886 are highly plasma-protein bound with measured values of ≥99%. The blood-to-
plasma ratio of quizartinib and AC886 are concentration dependent, indicating saturation of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 40/130 
 
 
 
 
distribution to erythrocytes. At clinically relevant plasma concentrations, the blood-to-plasma ratio is 
~1.3 for quizartinib and ~2.8 for AC886. 
The volume of distribution was 275 following an IV dose of 50 µg radiolabelled quizartinib. The 
apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 453 L in healthy volunteers, which is in the same range 
considering the absolute oral bioavailability. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies show that AC886 is a metabolite of quizartinib and is formed by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. 
AC886 is further metabolised to several metabolites by CYP3A4 (main contributor) and CYP3A5. The 
steady-state AC886-to-quizartinib AUC0-24h ratio during maintenance therapy was 0.57. 
In humans, the metabolism profile was investigated in plasma, urine and faeces. However, the 
applicant investigated the metabolism profile in plasma in the plasma samples taken at 2 hours to 6 
hours. Quizartinib has a half-life of ~75 hours. The sampling period is too close to the dose 
administration to accurately determine the metabolism profile; less than 1/10th of the elimination half-
life. In plasma, the parent compound is the major component and AC886 is the major metabolite 
(~16% of the administered dose), with large intra-individual variability. In urine, radioactivity is only 
excreted as metabolites. In faeces, radioactivity is mainly excreted as metabolites (4% is excreted as 
parent and ~43% as metabolites; with the rest not identified). In total 41 metabolites were observed 
in faeces. Based on the provided data quizartinib is most likely mainly metabolised to AC886. The 
biotransformation route of AC886 is not clear. The proposed biotransformation pathway is shown in the 
Figure 5.

Transporters 
Quizartinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, but not of BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT2, MATE1, 
and MRP2. AC886 is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and BCRP, but not of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, and 
MRP2.  
Excretion 
After  absorption,  the  majority  of  the  radioactivity  is  eliminated  in  faeces  (also  when  taking  the  low 
recovery into account). 
The  half-life  of  quizartinib  in  healthy  volunteers  ranged  from  63  to  136  h  and  is  independent  of  the 
administered dose. The elimination half-life of AC886 is 54 to 135 h (independent of the dose). 
Special populations 
Mild and moderate renal impairment, mild and moderate hepatic impairment based on Child-Pugh 
criteria, age, and gender do not seem to have a clinically relevant impact the PK of quizartinib and 
AC886 (data not shown). The plasma protein binding appears higher in subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment compared to normal hepatic function (data not shown). However, the plasma protein 
binding was still >99% for both subject groups. There are no data on the effect of severe hepatic 
impairment on the PK of quizartinib and AC886. At a body weight of 37 kg, the Cmax and AUC of 
quizartinib and AC886 increased by 1.7-fold compared to a body weight of 75 kg. At a body weight of 
153 kg, the Cmax and AUC of quizartinib and AC886 decreased by 1.7-fold compared to a body weight 
of 75 kg. The applicant provided information (data not shown) that the lower exposure in patients with 
a body weight of 153 kg did not affect the efficacy to a significant extent. Furthermore, no exposure-
safety relationship was observed, thus a low body weight does not appear to lead to an increase in 
safety issues. 
Quizartinib and AC886 are metabolised by CYP3A4 and 3A5. CYP3A5 function resulted in a lower Cmax 
and AUC of quizartinib and a higher Cmax and AUC for AC886. The net effect is a lower Cmax and AUC 
for quizartinib + AC886. These results indicates that CYP3A5 contributes to the overall metabolism of 
quizartinib. However, the sum of quizartinib+AC886 exposures lies entirely within the 80% to 125% 
bound and is therefore not considered clinically relevant.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
DDIs with quizartinib as perpetrator 
At maximal intestinal concentrations, quizartinib may be an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, but is not an 
inhibitor of CYP3A4. A clinical DDI study with dabigatran etexilate indicated that quizartinib is not a 
clinically relevant inhibitor of P-glycoprotein at the maximal oral dose. Co-administration of quizartinib 
and dabigatran etexilate (a P-gp substrate) increased total and free dabigatran Cmax by 1.12-fold and 
1.13-fold, respectively, and increased total and free dabigatran AUCinf by 1.13-fold and 1.11-fold, 
respectively. Quizartinib is a weak P-gp inhibitor, and no dose modification is recommended when P-gp 
substrates are co-administered with quizartinib. It is currently unknown if quizartinib is an inhibitor of 
BCRP at maximal intestinal concentrations. The applicant will investigate in vitro if quizartinib is an 
inhibitor of BCRP at the highest concentration possible to elucidate if quizartinib is an inhibitor of BCRP 
at maximal intestinal concentrations. 
At maximal portal vein concentration, quizartinib is not an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1. 
At maximal systemic concentrations, quizartinib and AC886 are not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A, and the transporters P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2,

OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2-K and BSEP. In addition, quizartinib and AC886 are not time-dependent 
inhibitors of CYP. Quizartinib inhibits UGT1A1 with an estimated in vitro Ki of 0.78 μM. Based on a 
physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) analysis, quizartinib was predicted to increase the Cmax 
and AUCinf of raltegravir (a UGT1A1 substrate) by 1.03-fold% which was not considered clinically 
relevant. Quizartinib is not an inducer via AhR, CAR and PXR at the concentrations investigated at 
clinically relevant systemic concentrations. Higher concentrations could not be investigated due to 
cytotoxicity of quizartinib. However, there are some uncertainties regarding study XT1330187. 
DDIs with quizartinib as victim 
In vitro, it was elucidated that quizartinib and AC886 are mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and 3A5. 
Furthermore, quizartinib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and AC886 a substrate of BCRP.  
Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 28 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor, 
with a single dose of quizartinib increased quizartinib maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area 
under the curve (AUCinf) by 1.17-fold and 1.94-fold, respectively, and decreased AC886 Cmax and 
AUCinf by 2.5-fold and 1.18-fold, respectively, compared to quizartinib alone. At steady state, 
quizartinib exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) was estimated to be increased by 1.86-fold and 1.96-fold, 
respectively, and AC886 exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) decreased by 1.22-fold and 1.17-fold, 
respectively.   
In contrast, Co-administration of fluconazole (200 mg twice daily for 28 days), a moderate CYP3A 
inhibitor, with a single dose of quizartinib increased quizartinib and AC886 Cmax by 1.11-fold and 
1.02-fold, respectively, and AUCinf by 1.20-fold and 1.14-fold%, respectively. This change was not 
considered clinically relevant. Therefore, no dose reduction of quizartinib is necessary if co-
administered with a moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor. 
A clinical DDI study with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer (efavirenz) resulted in a 9.7-fold decrease in 
quizartinib AUC and a 26-fold decrease in AC886 AUC. Therefore, co-administration of strong and 
moderate CYP3A inducers with quizartinib should be avoided due to possible lack of efficacy. 
The proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole decreased quizartinib Cmax by 1.16-fold and AUCinf by 1.05-
fold. This decrease in quizartinib absorption was not considered clinically relevant. Quizartinib can 
therefore be co-administered with gastric acid reducing agents (ARAs), such as proton pump inhibitors, 
H2 blockers, and antacids. 
Co-administration of quizartinib with other medicinal products that prolong the QT interval may further 
increase the incidence of QT prolongation. Caution should be used when co-administering medicinal 
products that prolong the QT interval with quizartinib. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Quizartinib is an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3. Quizartinib and its major metabolite 
AC886 competitively bind to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of FLT3 with high 
affinity. Quizartinib and AC886 inhibit FLT3 kinase activity, preventing autophosphorylation of the 
receptor, thereby inhibiting further downstream FLT3 receptor signalling and blocking FLT3-ITD-
dependent cell proliferation.

Primary pharmacology 
The applicant demonstrated the selectivity and potency of quizartinib to inhibit FTL3 in vitro: with a 
biochemical competition binding assay the biochemical potency and selectivity of quizartinib was 
determined against a panel of 441 kinases. Quizartinib binds with the highest affinity to FLT3 (Kd = 1.3 
nM) and with less affinity to KIT (Kd = 4.9 nM) and a few other class III RTKs.   
Analytical methods for FLT3-ITD biomarker detection 
The sponsor utilises the Navigate BP FLT3-ITD Mutation Assay for the determination of FLT3-ITD 
mutation status from bone marrow and/or blood samples to prospectively select subjects for entry into 
Study AC220-A-U302. This is a molecular assay that employs polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
capillary electrophoresis technology. Since the ITD mutation always occurs in exons 14 and 15 of the 
FLT3 gene, which includes the juxtamembrane domain and the N-terminal part of the kinase domain, 
this region, when amplified by PCR using a single set of DNA primers that flank the region, yields ITD 
mutant reaction products that are greater in size than 330 base pairs (bp) as well as nonmutant (FLT3 
wild type) product. The lengths of ITDs have been reported to range in size from 3 bp to 400 bp, but 
they are most often between 15 bp and 150 bp. The FLT3-ITD Mutation Assay uses a fragment size 
analysis method to resolve and detect the different-sized PCR products. In this method, the PCR 
primers that target exons 14 and 15 of the FLT3 gene are conjugated with differential fluorescent dyes, 
and the PCR products are separated and detected by capillary electrophoresis.  
The assay utilises genomic DNA isolated from ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)- or heparin 
anticoagulated peripheral blood or bone marrow. Three control samples are included in each assay run: 
the No-Template control (water); the Negative Control (nonmutant cell line DNA); and the Low Positive 
Control (mixing mutant cell line DNA with nonmutant cell line DNA such that the percent mutant is in 
the range of 6% to 10%). 
Clinical Trial Assay Analytical Validation  
Navigate BP performed a series of studies to validate the analytical performance of the FLT3-ITD 
Mutation.  
A bridging study (IVS-062-005-01-001, report submitted with the response to LOQ) assessed 
concordance between the CTA and the in vitro assay developed to be the companion diagnostic at 
Invivoscribe (IVS; San Diego, CA, US, LeukoStrat® CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay). Samples from 1029 
subjects from the clinical study, including screen failures, were retrospectively analysed and showed 
agreement with PPA 94.2% (91.8%, 96.0%) and NPA 99.4% (98.3%, 99.9%). 
In this study mean ITD insert size was detected with 56.33 and 55.96 bp by CTA and CDx, 
respectively, with ranges from 6-243 and 4-259 bp, respectively. Only 33 and 26 samples, 
respectively, had ≥100 bp in the pivotal study population. 
The detailed results of the clinical validation assessed in the bridging study will be submitted as part of 
the CDx submission, where appropriate. 
Study AC220-002 
Thia was a Phase 2 Open-Label, AC220 Monotherapy Study in Patients with AML With and Without 
FLT3-ITD Activating Mutations. The initial starting dose of quizartinib was 200 mg/day, reduced in 
Protocol Amendment 4 to 135 mg/day for males and 90 mg/day for females. 
Within the FLT3-ITD (-) cohorts, patients could be subdivided into non-detectable for FLT3-ITD and 
detectable ≤10% FLT3-ITD allelic ratio for some analyses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 44/130 
 
 
 
Within the FLT3-ITD (+) cohorts, patients with >10% to <25% FLT3-ITD allelic ratio were considered 
to have a low allelic ratio, patients with 25% to 50% allelic ratio were considered to have an 
intermediate allelic ratio, and patients with >50% allelic ratio FLT3-ITD were considered to have a high 
allelic ratio.  
Quizartinib reduced phosphorylation of its intended target, FLT3, as well as the downstream signalling 
protein STAT5 in the peripheral blood of the AML patients. Additionally, it reduced kinase insert domain 
for tyrosine (KIT) phosphorylation, although to a less degree relative to FLT3 and STAT5.  
Of the 292 patients tested, 26% were negative for the FLT3-ITD mutation. It was therefore analysed if 
the FLT3-ITD status had an effect on responses. Phospho- and total FLT3 signals for ITD+ patients 
were significantly higher before treatment compared to FLT3-ITD patients. After quizartinib treatment, 
there were significantly greater reductions in p/tFLT3 signal ratios at day 2, as well as greater 
reductions in tFLT3 levels at day 8. Similarly, there were significantly greater reductions in p/tSTAT5 
signal ratios at both days 2 and 8 after treatment for ITD+ subjects vs. ITD- subjects. 
Study 2686-CL-2004  
This was a Phase 2, Randomised, Open Label Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Two Doses of 
Quizartinib in Subjects with FLT3-ITD Positive Relapsed or Refractory AML. 
Quizartinib inhibited FLT3 phosphorylation in the PIA assay with ITD(+) cells to medians of 98.6% and 
99.2% for 30 and 60 mg, respectively, with undiluted plasma sampled on days 8 or 15. 
After dilution, in FLT3-ITD(+) cells and in THP-1 cells (FLT3-WT) pFLT3 inhibition was significantly 
higher in the subjects receiving 60 mg than 30mg. 
The IC90 (plasma concentration of quizartinib + AC886 that resulted in a 90% inhibition of kinase 
activity) were 182 nM in FLT3-ITD cells, 1160 nM in FLT3-WT cells, and 3977 nM in KIT cells. 
Figure 6. Plasma quizartinib + AC886 levels vs PIA IC90 values 
In conclusion, the 30mg and 60mg doses of quizartinib should result in very strong inhibitory effects 
on FLT3-ITD phosphorylation activity in vivo, with reduced, but still robust activity on FLT3-WT, and 
with largely reduced inhibition of KIT activity.

Secondary pharmacology 
Concentration-QTcF (C-QTcF) Analysis in Study AC220-A-U302 
The quizartinib plasma concentration-QTcF (C-QTcF) relationship in Study AC220-A-U302 was best 
described by a maximum effect (Emax) model. The median model-predicted change from baseline of 
QTcF at Cmax,ss during the Continuation Phase at 30 mg and 60 mg were 18.4 ms (90% confidence 
interval [CI] 16.3, 20.85) and 24.1 ms (90% CI 21.4, 26.6), respectively. The covariates that were 
tested in the C-QTcF model included hypokalaemia, serum calcium and magnesium concentrations, 
age, body weight, sex, race, and use of QT-prolonging medications, beta-blocker drugs, and 
anthracycline. Age and hypokalaemia had an effect on the baseline QTcF. Sex, body weight, race, 
serum magnesium concentration, and concomitant administration of QT-prolonging medications or 
beta-blockers were not found to be statistically significant covariates on baseline QTcF or Emax. 
Additionally, the C-QTcF relationship from the current analysis in the newly diagnosed AML subjects in 
Study AC220-A-U302 appeared to be similar to that from the previous analysis in the R/R AML subjects 
in Study AC220-007. Further evaluation of the C-QTcF relationships using data from subjects who had 
matched concentrations and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements during the time of concomitant 
administration of QT-prolonging medications, and during the time when those same subjects were not 
taking QT-prolonging medications, showed that the concomitant administration of QT-prolonging 
medications had no impact on the observed QTcF increases associated with quizartinib concentrations. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure-response (ER) for efficacy (OS) 
Different exposure metrics were evaluated in the ER analysis. The average daily exposures up to the 
event were inherently associated with a confounding factor related to the design in Study AC220-A-
U302 where the target quizartinib dose was 40 mg in the Induction and Consolidation Phases, followed 
by an initial dose at 30 mg for 15 days and escalation to 60 mg in the Continuation Phase. Since the 
majority of subjects in the highest exposure quartile were those that survived into the Continuation 
Phase and escalated to 60 mg, it implied the loss of the causality in the relationship between exposure 
and response, and a model-based analysis of these metrics would have led to a biased ER relationship. 
This confounding was further exacerbated by the treatment phase effect that was found for quizartinib 
PK where it was observed that subjects had a higher quizartinib exposure during the Continuation 
Phase compared to the Induction Phase. On the other hand, the AUCss at the nominal starting dose of 
40 mg during the Induction Phase was independent of dose escalation and phase-varying PK and was 
therefore selected as the exposure metric to be tested in the model-based analysis. 
The OS was described using a parametric time-to-event (TTE) model where the base hazard followed a 
Gompertz distribution. In the model, age was a significant covariate for baseline hazard. After 
accounting for the effect of age, a statistically significant effect of quizartinib exposure was found, 
where higher exposure was associated with longer OS. The final model predicted a median (95% CI) 
hazard ratio for quizartinib compared to a placebo of 0.790 (0.690,0.933) at the median quizartinib 
exposure (Figure 7). The estimated slope was relatively uncertain (RSE 37%) and led to a modest ER 
relationship. This is likely a result of the small range of AUCss at 40 mg, which is uniquely driven by 
the variability in individual apparent CL of quizartinib (CLquiz) and relative bioavailability (Frel) values. 
There was an overlap in the Cis between subgroups (age, race, WBC, ECOG, FLT3-ITD).  
Thus, age was a statistically significant covariate on the baseline hazard for OS, with older subjects 
being at higher risk. OS was found to be related to quizartinib exposure, defined by predicted 
quizartinib AUCss following 40 mg QD in the Induction Phase. The steepness of the ER relationship was 
modest and relatively uncertain. No ER relationship was identified for remission rate and EFS based on

the definition of Induction treatment failure as failure to achieve CR within 42 days from the start of 
the last cycle of Induction chemotherapy.

Exposure-response Relationships: Safety 
Exposure-first occurrence TEAEs in Study AC220-A-U302 
Logistic regression modelling was carried out to assess the relationship between exposure and the first 
occurrence of the following AEs: TEAEs of any grade, TEAEs of Grade ≥3, serious TEAEs (TESAEs), 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction/interruption, TEAEs leading to dose discontinuation, events in the 
Torsades de Pointes (TdP)/QT prolongation SMQ, infection, haemorrhages, hepatotoxicity, and 
myelosuppression. 
No covariate was found to have an impact on the probability of the different AEs analysed. No ER 
relationship was identified for the probability of first occurrence of TEAEs of any Grade, Grade ≥3 
TEAEs, TESAEs, TEAEs associated with study drug dose reduction/interruption, TEAEs associated with 
study drug discontinuation, events in the TdP/QT prolongation SMQ, infection, haemorrhages, 
hepatotoxicity, or myelosuppression. A quizartinib treatment effect was found for TEAEs associated 
with study drug dose reduction/interruption, TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation, events 
in the TdP/QT prolongation SMQ search, and myelosuppression (Figure 8).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In vitro and clinical studies were conducted with quizartinib. Furthermore, in vitro studies were 
conducted with AC886 and the PK was investigated in clinical studies. PopPK modelling was used to 
investigate the effect of different intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the clearance of quizartinib and 
AC886. In addition, PBPK modelling was used to predict the DDI of quizartinib as perpetrator in 
combination with a UGT1A1 substrate and the effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in CYP3A5 normal 
and poor metabolisers.  
Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of quizartinib and its main metabolite AC886 have 
been sufficiently investigated and showed an acceptable PK profile. The PK is dose proportional for 
quizartinib and AC886 over the dose range of 26.5 mg to 79.5 mg quizartinib, the PK for the clinical 
dose can be calculated. Food did not significantly impact the exposure to quizartinib and AC886 and 
changes seen are considered not clinically relevant. In the pivotal phase 3 study no food restrictions 
were given, neither are there recommendations in the SmPC. This is supported based on the food-
effect study results. Based on the provided data quizartinib is most likely mainly metabolised to 
AC886. Elimination occurs mainly via faeces. Mild and moderate renal and hepatic impairment seems 
not to have a clinically relevant impact the PK of quizartinib and AC886.  Patients with severe renal 
impairment (CLcr < 30 mL/min) were not included in the clinical studies; therefore, Vanflyta is not 
recommended for use in these patients. Body weight was also not found to have a clinically relevant 
impact on the PK and the safety profile of quizartinib and AC886.  
Results of metabolism through CYP3A5, indicate that CYP3A5 contributes to the overall metabolism of 
quizartinib and seems to lead to a lower Cmax and AUC for quizartinib + AC886 due to metabolism. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 48/130 
 
 
 
 
However, the sum of quizartinib+AC886 exposures lies entirely within the 80% to 125% bound and the 
impact of metabolism is therefore not considered clinically relevant.  
Studies with strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor increased quizartinib and decreased AC886 exposure which 
may increase the risk of toxicity. Dose adjustments by phase for adverse reactions and/or concomitant 
use with strong CYP3A inhibitors are therefore recommended during treatment with Vanflyta.  
The clinical DDI study with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor was most likely conducted mainly in CYP3A5 poor 
metabolisers which results in the highest increase in exposure (worst-case scenario) and the proposed 
dose reduction in section 4.5 of the SmPC is based on these data. Therefore, concomitant 
administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors is only recommended when reducing the administered 
starting dose to 17.7 mg and the continuation dose to 26.5 mg. This interaction is also identified as 
important identified risk in the RMP (see also safety discussion). 
It remains currently unknown if the proposed dose reduction based on the worst-case scenario in 
CYP3A5 poor metabolisers is also suitable for CYP3A5 normal metabolisers in which the increase in 
exposure due to CYP3A4 inhibition may be less pronounced. The dose reduction may be too high in 
CYP3A5 normal metabolisers, however since this does not lead to an increase in safety issues this issue 
is not further pursued.   
The applicant submitted a population pharmacokinetic model that was developed using observations of 
healthy volunteers and patients. Based on the prediction-corrected Visual Predictive Checks (pcVPCs), 
the PopPK model seems to be able to predict the PK of quizartinib and AC886 in healthy volunteers and 
patients. Furthermore, blood concentrations varied across AC886 plasma concentrations and 
haematocrit values. Therefore, an additional model describing Kb/p values of AC886 versus AC886 
plasma concentrations was developed. The model includes a breakpoint at a plasma concentration of 
88.2 ng/mL, which is quite an empirical model as it does not have a physiological basis. Nevertheless, 
it could be shown that this model showed superior predictive performance compared to potential other 
models (e.g. Emax or exponential). Simulations with the selected model showed that the predictions of 
individual concentration-time courses were quite well described even if the model overpredicted the 
observed concentrations between Cmax and around 10 hours.  
Furthermore, PBPK modelling was used to predict the DDI of quizartinib as perpetrator in combination 
with a UGT1A1 substrate. It is unclear how much UGT1A1 activity is present in the intestine in the 
SimCYP model. The PBPK model appears to be able to predict the exposure after a single dose in 
healthy volunteers and following multiple dosing in patients. The worst-case results from the prediction 
can be used to waive a clinical DDI study for quizartinib with a medicinal product that is metabolised 
by UGT1A1 in the intestine. Based on the provided data it is unlikely that quizartinib is a clinically 
significant inhibitor of UGT1A1 (see also SmPC section 5.2). Furthermore, PBPK modelling was used to 
predict the effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor on the PK of quizartinib and AC886 in CYP3A5 normal 
and poor metabolisers. However, the PBPK model was not qualified for its ability to identify differences 
in effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the PK in CYP3A5 normal and poor metabolisers, e.g. effect of 
itraconazole on the PK of venetoclax. It is therefore unknown if the model is able to capture the effect 
of CYP3A5 status. 
The applicant used the plasma concentrations of quizartinib and AC886 taking the different binding 
affinity for FLT3 into account for the exposure-response modelling. No exposure (Cmax) -safety 
relationship was observed. Only placebo versus treatment was shown with an increase in TEAEs 
leading to dose reduction or discontinuation, events in the TdP/QT or myelosuppression.

Pharmacodynamics 
The FLT3-ITD threshold for positivity was studied in Study AC220-002, analysis of ITD negative 
subjects from this Study showed that those subjects with a low level (≤10%) of the ITD mutation had 
similar response rates as the positive (>10%) subjects, while those with no detectable ITD mutation 
(<0.3%) had lower response rates. Therefore, the cutoff was reduced to ≥3% in Studies AC220-007 
and AC220-A-U302 to detect ITD mutations at that low percentage and to allow for subjects with lower 
levels of FLT3 ITD to be enrolled and potentially benefit from quizartinib therapy. In study 007 
quizartinib reduced phosphorylation of its intended target, FLT3, as well as the downstream signalling 
protein STAT5 in the peripheral blood of the AML patients. The applicant concluded that due to higher 
phospho- and total FLT3 signals for ITD+ subjects before treatment there were significantly greater 
reductions in p/tFLT3 signal ratios at day 2, as well as greater reductions in tFLT3 levels at day 8. 
Similarly, there were significantly greater reductions in p/tSTAT5 signal ratios at both days 2 and 8 
after treatment for ITD+ subjects vs. ITD- subjects. 
In Study 2686-CL-2004, a Phase 2 study in FLT3-ITD-positive Relapsed or Refractory AML patients, 
quizartinib inhibited FLT3 phosphorylation in the PIA assay with ITD(+) cells to medians of 98.6% and 
99.2% for 30 and 60 mg, respectively, with undiluted plasma sampled on days 8 or 15. The IC90 
(plasma concentration of quizartinib + AC886 that resulted in a 90% inhibition of kinase activity) were 
evaluated with 182 nM in FLT3-ITD cells, 1160 nM in FLT3-WT cells, and 3977 nM in KIT cells. On basis 
of these IC90s, the current plasma levels of Cmaxss of quizartinib+AC886 in all treatment phases (as 
derived from popPK model), i.e. >30mg, are obviously sufficient to inhibit >90% of FLT3-ITD activity, 
and the 60mg dose with 1.41µM would be able to also inhibit wt-FLT3 to >90%. 
With regard to the study U308 it was explained that the higher cut-offs for FLT 3 used in subgroup 
analyses for OS were related to those of ELN guidelines, which seems overall acceptable. Though, it 
remains unclear whether the ELN-subgroup cut-offs are comparably justified with regard to FLT3-ITD 
basepair length. However, no discussion about the VAF% cut-off-groups and their potential predictivity 
for differing response to quizartinib treatment was provided. The study population was a preselected 
FLT3-positive population and only for the VAF >50% subgroup a clinically significant benefit on the 
primary endpoint OS could be observed whereas the OS results for both the lower VAF groups are not 
significant. Also the newly submitted analysis for response rates and EFS demonstrated a relation to 
NPM1wt/mut status while not significantly different for quizartinib treatment or placebo. 
As already assessed previously it is more the NPM1 mutation status than the quizartinib treatment that 
results in clinically relevant differences in EFS and response rates between subgroups, and especially 
for Overall Survival the HR for NPM1-wt is above 1. Therefore, the applicant is requested to provide 
further subgroup analysis for FLT3-ITD %VAF subgroups plus NPM1-status to confirm that there is a 
benefit and no clinically relevant negative (detrimental) effect on the primary endpoint OS in all 
subgroups and especially those such as FLT3-ITD low plus NPM1wt, including also sub-grouping for 
length of FLT3-ITD basepairs. 
Several AML mutation data analyses listed in pivotal study endpoints as well as further PD/biomarker 
questions will be included in a biomarker report for which submission is to be expected post approval . 
Herein also analyses and discussion on the relevance of presence and %VAFs at baseline of observed 
other mutations (e.g. NPM1, IDH1/2, …) both for response and relapse as well as potential PD 
response differences from quizartinib treatment between longer and shorter ITD-bp length of FLT3 is 
expected. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
NPM1 mutation was found to be associated with significantly higher rates of CR and CRc, irrespective 
of quizartinib treatment. From the Forrest Plot for OS of the phase 3 study it seems that the higher 
Assessment report

%VAF of FLT3-ITD the lower the Hazard ratio. Therefore it is requested to provide further subgroup 
analysis for FLT3-ITD subgroups plus NPM1-status to confirm that there is a benefit and no clinically 
relevant negative effect in subgoups such as FLT2-ITD low plus NPM1wt.  
Plasma inhibitory activity data from the Phase 2b study in subjects with R/R AML, Study 2689-CL-
2004, demonstrated that 30 mg is the minimum dose for complete and rapid inhibition of FLT3-ITD 
signalling (Nepomuceno, 2014). To account for potential compensatory mechanisms at the initiation of 
quizartinib therapy, such as increases in FLT3 ligand and direct cell to cell contact between blast cells 
and stromal cells that can protect leukaemic blasts from apoptosis (Sato, 2011; Yang, 2014), and to 
reduce the effect of quizartinib, the dose of 40 mg was chosen in combination with chemotherapy 
together with the safety data from the previous Phase 1 studies.  
With respect to the exposure response relation it was observed that age was a statistically significant 
covariate on the baseline hazard for OS, with older subjects being at higher risk. OS was found to be 
related to quizartinib exposure, defined by predicted quizartinib AUCss following 40 mg QD in the 
Induction Phase. The steepness of the ER relationship was modest and relatively uncertain. No ER 
relationship was identified for remission rate and EFS based on the definition of Induction treatment 
failure as failure to achieve CR within 42 days from the start of the last cycle of Induction 
chemotherapy.  
Dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation has been observed in clinical trials with quizartinib. The 
median model-predicted change from baseline of QTcF at Cmax,ss during the Continuation Phase at 30 
mg and 60 mg were 18.4 ms and 24.1 ms, respectively and this is reflected in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. With ER-safety analysis, a quizartinib treatment effect was indeed found for events in the 
TdP/QT prolongation SMQ search, but also for TEAEs associated with study drug dose 
reduction/interruption, TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation, and myelosuppression. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of quizartinib and its pharmacologically active metabolite AC886 were sufficiently investigated 
in vitro and in vivo.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The quizartinib clinical development programme for newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD (+) AML comprises a 
pivotal Phase 3 study, AC220-A-U302 (N = 539) and 2 completed Phase 1 studies in subjects with 
newly diagnosed AML, Studies 2689-CL-0005 (N = 18) and AC220-A-J102 (N = 7). In addition, 1 
Phase 1 study, 2689-CL-0011 (N = 13), in subjects who received quizartinib as maintenance following 
allo-HSCT, has been completed. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study 2689-CL-2004 
This was an open-label, randomised, multiple-dose, Phase 2b study in 76 FLT3-ITD(+) AML subjects 
who were refractory to or had relapsed after second-line AML therapy with or without consolidating 
HSCT. Subjects were randomly assigned to 28-day cycles of 30 or 60 mg/day quizartinib. 74 patients 
were treated. Quizartinib was to be taken as a once daily oral solution for continuous 28-day cycles.  
To be eligible to participate in this study, subjects must have had morphologically documented primary 
AML or AML secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and had relapsed or was refractory after 1

second-line (salvage) regimen or after HSCT. Subject had to be positive for FLT3-ITD activating 
mutation in bone marrow or peripheral blood (>10% allelic ratio).  
Efficacy Results: 
• Twenty-four (63.2%) subjects in the 30 mg dose group and 7 (19.4%) subjects in the 60 mg dose 
group had their dose escalated during the study. 
• In subjects with relapsed or refractory AML, and response as assessed by local morphology for the 
ITT Analysis Set, the primary endpoint of composite complete remission (CRc) rate was achieved by 
47.4% (90% CI: 33.3, 61.8) of subjects overall and in both the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups 
following treatment with quizartinib, showing that there was no difference in response between the 2 
doses. 
• Overall, the median time to CRc was 4.5 weeks, 4.4 weeks in the 30 mg dose group and 4.6 weeks 
in the 60 mg dose group. 
• More than 50% of all subjects achieved some level of response at the end of Cycle 2: complete 
remission with incomplete neutrophil or platelet recovery(Cri) in 28 (36.8%) subjects, partial remission 
(PR) in 16 (21.1%) subjects, CR in 2 (2.6%) subjects, and CRp in 1 (1.3%) subject. Similarly, more 
than 50% of all subjects achieved some level of response at the end of study timepoint: CRi in 31 
(40.8%) subjects, PR in 14 (18.4%) subjects, CR in 3 (3.9%) subjects, and CRp in 2 (2.6%) subjects. 
The overall response (CRc + PR) at the end of Cycle 2 and the end of study was 55% and 60%, 
respectively, in the 30 mg dose group and 68% and 71%, respectively, in the 60 mg dose group. 
- 
- 
In the 30 mg dose group, the best response achieved at the end of Cycle 2 was: CRi in 14 
(36.8%) subjects, PR in 5 (13.2%) subjects, and CR in 2 (5.3%) subjects. At the end of 
the study the best response achieved was: CRi in 16 (42.1%) subjects, PR in 5 (13.2%) 
subjects, and CR in 2 (5.3%) subjects. 
In the 60 mg dose group, the best response achieved at the end of Cycle 2 was: CRi in 14 
(36.8%) subjects, PR in 11 (28.9%) subjects, and CRp in 1 (2.6%) subject. At the end of 
the study the best response achieved was: CRi in 15 (39.5%) subjects, PR in 9 (23.7%) 
subjects, CRp in 2 (5.3%) subjects, and CR in 1 (2.6%) subject.  
• Analysis of a subject’s ability to respond to quizartinib treatment based on whether the subject 
responded to their last AML therapy showed that 14 of 26 (54%) non-responders to the last line of 
treatment, achieved a CRc and at the end of the study. 
• The median duration of CRc was 5.4 weeks. Median duration of CRc was 4.2 weeks in the 30 mg 
dose group and 9.1 weeks in the 60 mg dose group. Median duration of overall response (CRc + PR) 
for all subjects was 8.1 weeks. Median duration of overall response was 7.3 weeks in the 30 mg dose 
group and 9.1 weeks in the 60 mg dose group. 
• Median OS for subjects in this study was 22.6 weeks (95% CI: 19.9, 28.3), with a long-term survival 
(OS ≥52 weeks, ie, ≥ 365 days) rate of 7.9% (6 subjects). Median OS was 20.9 weeks in the 30 mg 
dose group and 27.3 weeks in the 60 mg dose group. The long-term survival rate was 2.6% (1 
subject) in the 30 mg dose group and 13.2% (5 subjects) in the 60 mg dose group. 
-  Median EFS was 12.3 weeks (95% CI: 9.7, 16.1) overall. In the 30 mg and 60 mg dose 
groups, median EFS was 12.0 weeks (95% CI: 8.3, 16.1) and 13.7 weeks (95% CI: 9.7, 
26.1), respectively. 
-  Thirty-six subjects in the ITT population were included in the analysis for LFS. Of these, 20 
(55.6%) subjects had an LFS event observed. Median LFS was 5.3 weeks (95% CI: 4.1, 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 52/130 
 
 
 
11.9) overall. Median LFS was 4.1 weeks (95% CI: 2.1, 9.7) in the 30 mg dose group and 
9.1 weeks (95% CI: 4.0, 22.3) in the 60 mg dose group. 
-  Twelve of 38 (31.6%) subjects in the 30 mg dose group and 16 of 38 (42.1%) in the 60 
mg dose group underwent HSCT after treatment with quizartinib. 
In summary, the two quizartinib dosing regimens, starting dose of 30 mg/day or 60 mg/day with 
escalations to 60 mg/day or 90 mg/day, respectively, were similar with regard to the primary efficacy 
endpoint of CRc rate. Dose escalation was more frequent in the 30 mg dose group than in the 60 mg 
dose group. Duration of CRc, overall survival, and transplantation rate were higher in the 60 mg/day 
dose group. 
Study 2689-CL-0005: A 2-part, Phase 1, multicentre, open-label, sequential group, dose-escalation 
trial using a modified 3+3 design. In Part 1, subjects were to be enrolled into successive cohorts of 5 
or 6 subjects to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Dose escalation decisions were made 
based on does limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occurred during remission induction. The following dose 
levels of quizartinib were evaluated: 60 mg once daily (QD) × 7 days; 60 mg QD × 14 days; 40 mg 
QD × 14 days. The MTD was defined as the dose level at which ≤ 1 out of 6 or 0 out of 5 subjects 
experienced a DLT and 1 dose level below the lowest dose level at which ≥ 2 out of 2 to 6 subjects 
experienced a DLT. Male or female subjects aged ≥ 18 years and ≤ 60 years with a diagnosis of 
previously-untreated de novo AML according to WHO classification (2008). Subjects with both positive 
and negative FLT3 – internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation status were eligible. 
A total of 3 subjects had reports of DLTs: 0 in the 60 mg/7-Day cohort; 2 in the 60 mg/14-Day cohort; 
and 1 in the 40 mg/14-Day cohort. In the 60 mg/14-Day cohort, 1 subject had a DLT of pericardial 
effusion; and 1 subject had DLTs of febrile neutropenia, platelet count decreased, and ECG QT 
prolonged. In the 40 mg/14-Day cohort, 1 subject had a DLT of pericarditis. The 40 mg/14-Day dose 
regimen was determined to be the MTD as this was the lowest dose level at which ≤ 1 out of 6 
subjects experienced a DLT. 
Study 2689-CL-0011: A 2-part, Phase 1, multi-centre, open-label, sequential group dose escalation 
study. Subjects were treated with quizartinib between 30 to 60 days after receiving allogeneic HSCT. 
Quizartinib 40 mg or 60 mg was taken QD, with 28 consecutive days defining a treatment cycle. 
Subjects could receive up to 24 continuous 28-day treatment cycles. In Part 1, subjects were enrolled 
into successive cohorts to determine the MTD. In Part 2 subjects were to be enrolled into an expanded 
cohort at the MTD to further evaluate safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of quizartinib; however the study 
was terminated before Part 2 could begin. Of 13 subjects enrolled, 10 subjects received treatment for 
more than 1 year, and 6 of these received treatment for almost 2 years. DLTs were observed in 2 
subjects, 1 at each dose; however an MTD was not identified.  
Based on data from the Phase 2b of 76 subjects with relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD AML (2689-CL-
2004), which evaluated a starting dose of either 30 mg/day or 60 mg/day with escalation permitted to 
60 mg/day or 90 mg/day, it was decided that 60 mg daily was the maximum dose to be taken forward 
into Phase 3 studies and therefore dose escalation above 60 mg daily was not explored. The 
recommended dose regimen for the pivotal phase 3 study for the combination with standard 
chemotherapy was at a dose of 40 mg QD and quizartinib continuation monotherapy at 30 mg QD.

AC220-A-U302 (Quantum-First) 
Title of study 
A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Study of Quizartinib Administered in Combination with 
Induction and Consolidation Chemotherapy, and Administered as Continuation Therapy in Subjects 18 
to 75 Years Old with Newly Diagnosed FLT3-ITD (+) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (QuANTUM First) 
Methods 
A Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study to compare the effect of 
quizartinib versus placebo (administered with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, then 
administered as continuation therapy for up to 36 cycles) on the primary endpoint of OS in subjects 
with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD (+) AML. Worldwide (at data cut off (DCO)) 193 sites had enrolled a 
subject. The target sample size was approximately 536 subjects. Randomisation was done in a 1:1 
ratio into the two treatment arms (quizartinib or placebo) and occurred at cycle 1 day 7, this allowed 
subjects to start induction treatment while awaiting results of the FLT3 testing, after which 
randomisation and start quizartinib/placebo commenced. 
The study design consisted of 4 consecutive phases (Induction, Consolidation, Continuation, and Long-
term Follow-up). The study design from Screening through the treatment period is outlined below. The 
Long-term Follow-up Phase begins upon completion of 36 cycles of study drug (quizartinib/placebo) in 
the Continuation Phase or permanent discontinuation of study drug in any phase. 
Induction/consolidation and maintenance/continuation are tested together and the study design does 
not allow to isolate the effect in the two phases and question the duration.

•  Treatments 
Induction Phase (Up to 2 Cycles) 
Subjects were permitted to receive up to 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 56/130 
 
 
 
Cycle 1: Cycle 1 Day 1 was defined as the start date of the chemotherapy infusions. Subjects have 
been  randomised on Day 7. If necessary, Randomisation may be performed later (eg, Days 8 to 10) to 
allow time for addressing electrolyte abnormalities, QTcF prolongation, etc. 
Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) 100 mg/m2/day (200 mg/m2/day allowed if this is the institutional 
or local standard) was to be administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for a total of 7 days 
(Day 1 through Day 8). 
One of the following anthracycline regimens (investigator’s choice) was to be administered: 
Daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/day IV infusion on Days 1, 2, and 3; or Idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day IV infusion 
on Days 1, 2, and 3. 
Quizartinib (40mg)/placebo was to be administered orally once daily for 14 days. For subjects 
concomitantly receiving a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, the dose was to be reduced to 
20 mg/day. Dosing should have started following the end of the cytarabine infusion, normally on Day 
8. If quizartinib/placebo administration could not begin as scheduled, the start of dosing should have 
been  delayed, but best efforts should have been made to start within 3 days of Randomisation if 
possible. If quizartinib/placebo was interrupted, missed doses have not been made up.  
On Day 21 (window Day 21 to Day 28), a bone marrow aspirate specimen (or a core biopsy specimen 
if aspirate could not be obtained) has been collected for local and central pathology for response 
assessment. At the investigator’s discretion, to allow for blood counts to recover or other reasons, the 
second Induction cycle might have started up to 60 days after Day 1 of the first Induction cycle. 
Cycle 2: Subjects began the cytarabine and anthracycline regimen on Day 1. It was recommended to 
wait at least 7 days after the last dose of quizartinib/placebo in Cycle 1 of Induction before starting 
Cycle 2 of induction, since quizartinib has a long elimination half-life and there are no data on the 
safety of administering anthracycline within 7 days following quizartinib administration. For Cycle 2 of 
induction, investigators could have chosen to administer one of the following: 
“7 + 3” chemotherapy regimen, defined as 7 days of continuous IV infusion of standard dose 
cytarabine plus 3 days of anthracycline (the same anthracycline must have been used throughout the 
Induction Phase) 
“5 + 2” chemotherapy regimen, defined as 5 days of continuous IV infusion of standard dose 
cytarabine plus 2 days of anthracycline (the same anthracycline must have been used throughout the 
Induction Phase) 
Quizartinib 40 mg or placebo dosing was to start following the end of the cytarabine infusion, normally 
on Cycle 2 Day 8 or Cycle 2 Day 6, depending on the chemotherapy regimen selected by the 
investigator (ie, “7 + 3” or “5 + 2”, respectively). Study drug was to be administered orally once daily 
for 14 days. For subjects concomitantly receiving a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose was to be 
reduced to 20 mg/day. 
Consolidation Phase 
Subjects who achieve a CR or CRi at the end of the Induction Phase were to enter the consolidation 
Phase. 
During consolidation, there were three options for treatment:  
1) consolidation chemotherapy followed by quizartinib for 14 days,  
2) allo-HSCT, or  
3) consolidation chemotherapy followed by quizartinib for 14 days followed by allo-HSCT.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 57/130 
 
 
 
 
For regimens including consolidation chemotherapy, cytarabine was to be given on Days 1, 3, and 5. 
The cytarabine regimen was as follows: 
-  For subjects <60 years: cytarabine 3.0 g/m2 by IV infusion, every 12 hours for a total of 6 
doses. For subjects ≥60 years: cytarabine 1.5 g/m2 by IV infusion, every 12 hours for a 
total of 6 doses. 
-  Subjects could have received up to 4 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy. Subjects were 
not required to complete a full cycle if they were unable to tolerate any cycle during the 
Consolidation Phase. 
-  Quizartinib (40 mg) or placebo was to be administered orally once daily for 14 days 
starting on Day 6. For subjects concomitantly receiving a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose 
was to be reduced to 20 mg/day. 
Continuation Phase (Up to 36 Cycles) 
Quizartinib/placebo continuation therapy was to begin after induction and consolidation therapy 
(including allo-HSCT) upon blood count recovery (ANC >500/mm3 and platelet count >50,000/mm3 
without a platelet transfusion within 24 hours of drawing blood samples). For subjects who underwent 
allo-HSCT, continuation therapy was to begin any time between 30 and 180 days after the transplant. 
Study drug was to be administered orally once daily starting on Day 1, with no breaks in dosing 
between cycles. If study drug was interrupted, missed doses were not to be made up. Study drug 
continuation therapy was to continue for up to 36 cycles after induction or consolidation until relapse, 
start of non-protocol specified AML treatment, death, unacceptable toxicity, study closure, or 
completion of study drug, whichever occurred first. 
The dose of study drug on Cycle 1 Days 1 to 15 was to be 30 mg orally once daily. On Cycle 1 Day 16, 
the dose was to be increased to 60 mg/day if the average QTcF of the triplicate electrocardiogram 
(ECG) was ≤450 ms on Cycle 1 Day 15. Once the dose was increased to 60 mg/day, the subject was 
allowed to continue on this dose as long as dose reduction was not needed. 
For subjects concomitantly receiving a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose of study drug on Cycle 1 Days 
1 to 15 was to be 20 mg/day. On Cycle 1 Day 16, the dose was to be increased to 30 mg/day if the 
average QTcF of the triplicate ECG was ≤450 ms on Cycle 1 Day 15. If the dose of study drug was not 
able to be increased on Cycle 1 Day 16, the dose could have been increased on Cycle 2 Day 2 if the 
average QTcF of the triplicate ECG was ≤450 ms on Cycle 2 Day 1. 
Subjects had their blood counts monitored at least every 4 weeks and had a bone marrow exam every 
12 weeks for 48 weeks and then every 24 weeks until week 96. 
Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation 
Subjects were permitted to undergo allo-HSCT after CR or CRi was achieved. Allogeneic HSCT for 
consolidation was able to be performed after the Induction Phase, anytime during the Consolidation 
Phase, or, if certain criteria were met, within the first 3 months of the Continuation Phase. Study drug 
was to be discontinued at least 7 days before the start of a conditioning regimen. Any hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) performed for other reasons (eg, molecular relapse) was to be 
considered non-protocol-specified AML therapy, and the subject was to be discontinued from study 
drug but continued to be followed for outcome data. Subjects were not permitted to undergo 
autologous HSCT at any time during the study. Subjects who had autologous HSCT were to be 
discontinued from study drug but continued to be followed for outcome data. 
For subjects who undergo allogeneic HSCT, treatment with quizartinib/placebo should be discontinued 
7 days before the start of a conditioning regimen. Subjects may begin continuation therapy anytime 
between 30 to 180 days after the allogeneic HSCT.

•  Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the effect of quizartinib versus placebo 
(administered with standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, then administered as 
continuation therapy for up to 36 cycles) on the primary endpoint of OS in subjects with newly 
diagnosed AML with FLT3-ITD mutations. 
The secondary objectives of this study were the following: 
• To compare the following in subjects treated with quizartinib versus placebo (administered with 
standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy, then administered as continuation therapy for up 
to 36 cycles): 
-  Event-free survival (EFS) 
-  CRc rate (CRc = CR + CR with incomplete neutrophil or platelet recovery [CRi]) after induction 
-  Percentage of subjects achieving CRc with FLT3-ITD minimal or measurable residual disease (MRD) 
negativity after induction 
-  CR rate after induction 
-  Percentage of subjects achieving CR with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity after induction 
• To further characterise the safety profile of quizartinib administered with standard induction and 
consolidation chemotherapy, then administered as continuation therapy for up to 36 cycles 
• To assess the PK of quizartinib and its metabolite (AC886) 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The total duration of treatment with study drug was to have been up to 42 cycles (inclusive of 
Induction, Consolidation, and Continuation Phases). The total duration of subject participation was to 
be until death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or study closure, whichever occurred first. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: OS, defined as the time from Randomisation until death from any cause. 
Subjects alive or lost to follow-up at the time of analysis were to be censored at the date when they 
were last known to be alive. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
• EFS (based on IRC assessment), defined as the time from Randomisation until the date of the 
earliest of any of the following:  
-  Refractory disease (or treatment failure) as determined at the end of the Induction Phase and 
defined as CR or CRi never achieved in the Induction Phase; or  Blasts <5% if Auer-rod 
positive; or appearance of new or worsening extramedullary disease. 
-  Relapse after CR or CRi, defined as ≥5% blasts in the bone marrow aspirate1 and/or biopsy not 
attributable to any other cause; or reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood; 
and/or new appearance of extramedullary leukaemia; or presence of Auer rods 
-  Death from any cause at any time during the study 
-  CRc rate, defined as the percentage of subjects achieving CR or CRi after induction. 
1 As per the study protocol, a bone marrow aspirate was to be collected at the planned time points until 24 months after 
the start of continuation therapy, and at any time during the study treatment or the long-term follow-up in case of 
suspicion of relapse based on abnormal peripheral smears or when subjects developed cytopenia.

-  Percentage of subjects achieving CRc with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity. 
-  CR rate, defined as the percentage of subjects achieving CR after induction. 
-  Percentage of subjects achieving CR with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity following induction therapy. 
•  Sample size 
Simulations indicated that about 84% power and 287 events would need to be obtained to achieve a 
statistically significant difference in OS distribution with approximately 536 subjects by a 2-sided log-
rank test at the 0.05 significance level when OS was analysed at 24 months after the last subject was 
randomised. No interim analysis was performed. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomisation was done in a 1:1 ratio into 2 treatment groups (quizartinib or placebo). Randomisation 
was to be stratified based on: Region (North America, Europe, Asia/Other Regions); Age (<60, ≥ 60 
years old); White blood cell (WBC) count at the time of diagnosis of AML (<40×109/L, ≥40×109/L). In 
total, there are 12 strata (=3 × 2 × 2). Within each stratum, a permuted-block randomisation is used 
to randomise subjects.  
This study had a double-blind design. Neither the subjects nor any of the Investigators, Sponsor, or 
contract research organisations (CROs) have been aware of the treatments received prior to database 
lock. 
In the case of an emergency where, in the opinion of the investigator, the study treatment assignment 
must be unblinded in order to evaluate further a course of medical treatment, it was required that the 
investigator discuss the case with the Medical Monitor, but the discussion may occur after unblinding if 
the subject requires emergency treatment. 
•  Statistical methods 
The current version of the SAP is version 2.0, dated 11 October 2021. This version of the SAP is 
intended to follow Protocol version 7.0. 
Analysis sets 
Intent-to-treat analysis set: The ITT Analysis Set includes all subjects who are randomised. 
Per-Protocol Analysis Set: The Per-protocol Analysis Set (PPS) includes all subjects in the ITT Analysis 
Set who have no major protocol deviations that would affect assessment of efficacy endpoints. In 
addition, subjects who are randomised but not treated have been excluded from PPS. Efficacy analysis 
based on PPS Major protocol deviations have been defined and documented prior to data base lock. 
Interim analyses 
No formal interim analysis of efficacy has been performed. 
Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
To control for the family-wise type I error rate for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, serial 
hierarchically ordered gatekeeping strategy has been employed. The primary assessment of OS in the 
ITT Analysis Set has been evaluated first, and if significant at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, a statistical 
evaluation of EFS by IRC based on the AML guidances (FDA, 2020; European Medicines Agency [EMA], 
2019) in the ITT Analysis Set has been performed. After EFS evaluation, order of other secondary 
endpoints to be tested has been CR rate, rate of subjects achieving CR with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity, 
CRc rate, and rate of subjects achieving CRc with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity. Testing has stopped once 
one test in the sequence failed to be statistically significant.

Primary endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is Overall survival (OS). OS is defined as the time from the 
date of randomisation to the date of death due to any cause. Subjects without an OS event are 
censored at the last known alive date. No other censoring rules were specified for the primary OS 
analysis.  
The primary analytic method for OS is a stratified log-rank test performed at the overall 2.5 level, with 
3 stratification factors used for randomisation (Region [North America, Europe, Asia/Other Regions], 
Age [<60 60 years old], White blood cell count at the time of diagnosis of AML [<40×109 9/L]) per 
IXRS. 
The distribution of OS has been summarised using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median OS has been 
estimated for each treatment group from the 50th percentile of the corresponding Kaplan-Meier 
estimates, and the 2-sided 95% CI for the median of each treatment group has been calculated using 
the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley. The corresponding Kaplan-Meier curves has also been 
presented. 
The hazard ratio with 95% CI for treatment group has been estimated using stratified Cox proportional 
hazards models, with the 3 stratification factors used for randomisation per IXRS. 
Sensitivity and supplementary analyses to examine the robustness of the OS results has been 
conducted. The same analysis methods and testing used for the primary OS analysis has been applied 
to the following analyses: 
1. OS analysis unstratified. 
2. OS censored at the start of the conditioning regimen for HSCT. The censoring rule is the same as 
that of the primary analysis, except that subjects who undergo HSCT on or before cut-off date have 
been censored at the start of the conditioning regimen for HSCT. 
3. OS analysis (performed using PPS).  
In addition, sensitivity analysis of OS based on the pre-specified number of OS events (N=287) may 
have bene performed. 
RMST Analysis 
To account for a possible plateau effect in OS, the restricted mean survival time (RMST) method has 
been applied as a sensitivity analysis to explore the robustness of the primary OS analysis result. The 
RMST up to a time point (tau) is interpreted as the expected survival time restricted to the common 
follow- in each treatment arm. clinical relevance (that is, it represents a clinically meaningful follow-up 
duration) for the hypothesis being tested. The default of tau is set as the minimum of the largest 
observed survival time in each treatment arm. Other time points may have been considered if it is 
deemed to be clinical relevant. The treatment effect between the two treatment arms has been 
assessed based on the difference in RMST. The associated s for the differences in means and 2-sided 
p-value has been generated.

Results 
•  Participant flow 
Figure 10.  Overview of subject disposition 
The participant flow is presented in Figure 10. On top of negativity to FLT3 testing shown in the figure 
above, additional reasons for screen failure included: withdrawal by subject (68 [2.3%] subjects), 
death (41 [1.4%] subjects), other (21 [0.7%] subjects), and adverse event (12 [0.4%] subjects). 
During the induction phase of the study 34.7% discontinued the study drug, equal in both arms but 
differentially distributed. The main reason was refractory disease (43% in quizartinib versus 75% in

placebo) or adverse events (30% vs 12%). Subsequently, 65.3% of subjects entered the consolidation 
phase in both arms of which 21.5% (quizartinib) and 31.0% (placebo) discontinued.

Even though the number of discontinuations during the induction phase was very similar between the 
study arms (34.7%), there was an imbalance between in reason for discontinuation of treatment with 
more patients in the quizartinib arm discontinuing due to an AE, or following a decision by the subject 
or investigator.

•  Conduct of the study 
Amendments and protocol violations to the study are listed in Table 4 and Table 5. Of importance, in 
Protocol Amendment 5, the primary endpoint was changed from EFS to dual primary endpoints of EFS 
and OS. Subsequently, based on FDA feedback EFS was then changed to a secondary endpoint in 
Protocol Amendment 6, and the definition of EFS was changed in Protocol Amendment 7.

Table 2. Protocol violations in ITT 
The number of subjects with a major protocol violation was high (52.6% quiz vs 50.2%) and could 
mainly be attributed to starting of the incorrect dose as per protocol in any phase (17.5% vs 13.3%) 
and late reporting of SAEs (13.1% vs 15.1%). As well as visits, assessment or procedures not

performed per protocol (22.8% vs 19.2%). The applicant states that there was no impact on the study 
conduct that would affect assessment of efficacy endpoints and the interpretation of results. 
•  Baseline data 
Key demographic and baseline characteristics for all enrolled subjects are displayed below. In general, 
demographic and baseline characteristics for subjects in the ITT Analysis Set were consistent with an 
FLT3-ITD (+) newly diagnosed AML population. Baseline AML disease characteristics for the ITT 
Analysis Set are presented in Table 7.6. Baseline AML characteristics were generally comparable 
between the 2 treatment arms. The majority of subjects in both the quizartinib and placebo arms had 
an intermediate or unfavourable cytogenetic risk (216 [80.6%] and 220 [81.2%] subjects, 
respectively).

The study met its primary endpoint of OS with a HR of 0.776 (0.615- 0.979) and a 2-sided p value: 
0.03. At the time of data cut off (DCO), there were 133 (49.6%) and 158 (58.3%) deaths in the

quizartinib and placebo arms, respectively. The median follow-up time was 39.2 months (95% CI of 
37.2 to 41.5 months) in the quizartinib arm. The quizartinib arm had a higher plateau, with 49.9% 
(95%CI: 43.7-55.9) of the patients surviving at the 3-year time point, versus 41.1% (95%CI: 35.0-
47.0) of the patients in the placebo arm. In the beginning of the OS curve (up to app. 5 months) there 
is a crossing of the curves in favour of placebo treatment which resolves after 6 months. More early 
deaths (ie, deaths within 30/60 days of initiation of study drug) occurred with quizartinib compared 
with placebo. In total, of the treated subjects, 20 (7.5%) and 13 (4.9%) subjects, respectively, died 
within 60 days of study drug initiation, of which 15 (5.7%) and 9 (3.4%) subjects, respectively, died 
within 30 days of study drug initiation. The applicant has provided the causes of the early death which 
are discussed in the safety section of this assessment report.  
In line with the treatment policy estimand strategy, survival data was sufficiently complete with a 
follow up >96% of subjects in both arms including the discontinued patients. In total, 22 subjects 
withdrew their consent (13 [4.9%] and 9 [3.3%] subjects in the quizartinib and placebo groups, 
respectively), and 3 (0.6%) subjects were lost to follow up (2 [0.7%] and 1 [0.4%] subjects in the 
quizartinib and placebo groups. 
•  Sensitivity analysis for OS 
The applicant performed several sensitivity analysis (Table 10; Table 11) for OS. The restricted mean 
survival time (RMST) method was conducted using survival cutoff time points at 36, 42, 48, and 55.8 
months.

Predefined subgroup analyses for OS were performed based on demographics (age, sex, race, and 
geographical region) and baseline disease characteristics (baseline ECOG performance status, white 
blood cell (WBC) count at the time of diagnosis, choice of anthracycline used during the Induction 
Phase, AML cytogenetic risk score, FLT3-ITD VAF at Randomisation, and NPM1 mutational status).

In Study AC220-A-U302, WBC count at the time of diagnosis of AML was one of the stratification 
factors at randomisation, enabling similar distribution of subjects with low and high WBC counts in the 
overall population and between the quizartinib and placebo groups (ie, 50.5 vs. 49.5%, in the overall 
population, 50.4% vs. 49.6% in the quizartinib group, and 50.6% vs. 49.4% in the placebo group). For 
subjects with low WBC count, the HR was 0.961 (95% CI: 0.687, 1.343) with no clear separation of 
the curves (Figure 13).  
For subjects with high WBC count, the Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure 14) showed a clear separation 
between the 2 treatment groups in favour of quizartinib, with an HR of 0.621 (95% CI: 0.451, 0.855).

between quizartinib and placebo-treated subjects in the low WBC count subgroup, except for 
antecedent haematological disorders, which was reported with higher incidence in the quizartinib group 
compared with the placebo group (15.9% vs. 9.6%), including myelodysplastic syndrome (12.1% vs. 
6.7%). The proportion of subjects with NPM1 co-mutation was lower in the quizartinib group than in 
the placebo group (40.9% vs. 48.1%). 
•  Secondary endpoints 
The primary analysis for EFS was based on a response of CR as assessed by the IRC (Table 112). For 
this analysis, induction treatment failure (ITF) was defined as not achieving CR within 42 days from the 
start of the last cycle of induction chemotherapy, per the FDA AML guidance (FDA, 2020). Based on 
this definition, there was no statistically significant difference between the quizartinib and placebo 
arms in EFS (HR [95% CI] = 0.916 [0.754, 1.114], p = 0.2371 by stratified log-rank test). The 
sensitivity and supplementary analyses ( Table 12 and 13) for EFS are based on CR or CRc evaluation 
in the Induction Phase (without the 42-day window but up to Day 56 from the start of the last cycle of 
induction chemotherapy, as per protocol).

Table 13.  Event-free survival primary and sensitivity and supplementary analyses –IRC 
assessment (ITT analysis set) 
Because the analysis of EFS per FDA criteria was not statistically significant, formal hierarchical testing 
was not continued. Thus the results of the other secondary efficacy endpoints should only be 
considered descriptive. (Table 14) It is unclear whether patients with missing assessments may have 
had their EFS time overestimated given these patients were in follow up until date of death or 
censoring at last follow up for survival and any other EFS-related events were unknown.

Rates of CR, CR with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity, and CRc with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity at the end of 
induction were similar between treatment arms. A difference was observed for CRi (also reflected in 
the CRc rate) between the quizartinib and placebo arm (45 [16.8%] subjects vs. 26 [9.6%] subjects), 
however CRi is a less stringent definition of CR as incomplete hematologic recovery.

•  Exploratory endpoints 
The exploratory endpoints (relapse-free survival [RFS] and duration of complete remission [CR]) 
appear to show a difference between quizartinib and placebo in favour of quizartinib (Table 15).   
An increased RFS and duration of CR was reported by the applicant with quizartinib (median RFS; 39.3 
and 13.6 months, and median duration of CR of 38.6 months versus 12.4 months quizartinib vs 
placebo).

Subjects were permitted to undergo allo-HSCT after CR or CRi was achieved per protocol. Allogeneic 
HSCT was to be performed after the Induction Phase, anytime during the Consolidation Phase or, if 
certain criteria were met, within 3 months of the Continuation Phase. The number of subjects receiving 
allo-HSCT was numerically slightly higher in subjects in the quizartinib arm (38.1%) versus 33.6% 
subjects in the placebo. Any HSCTs after treatment discontinuation were specified as non-protocol 
HSCTs. A total of 83 subjects underwent non-protocol-specified HSCT (44 and 39 subjects in the 
Assessment report

quizartinib and placebo groups, respectively). Overall, no major differences were observed between 
the quizartinib and placebo groups. Most subjects had non-protocol-specified HSCT after the Induction 
Phase (N = 48, including 24 subjects in each group) or the Consolidation Phase (N = 20, including 9 
and 11 subjects in the quizartinib and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 14 subjects had non-
protocol specified allo-HSCT during the Continuation Phase (ie, 10 subjects in the quizartinib group and 
4 subjects in the placebo group). The non-protocol HSCTs are reported based on data recorded in the 
CSR, these data are likely to be incomplete as not all patients had data available on subsequent 
therapies after discontinuing treatment. 
The impact of NPM1 mutation status on the secondary endpoints of EFS and CR/CRc is summarised in 
table 16 and table 17. Consistent with the well-established role of NPM1wt as an adverse prognostic 
factor, better outcomes were observed in NPM1mut subjects compared to NPM1wt subjects, including 
the longer median EFS based on the primary and 2 sensitivity EFS analyses, as well as the higher rates 
of CR and CRc in NPM1mut subjects versus NPM1wt subjects.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application presents one pivotal trial Quantum-First (study AC2200-A-U302), a randomised, 
double-blind, parallel-group, and placebo-controlled study. The add-on study design with standard 
induction and consolidation treatment as background therapy was intended to establish efficacy over 
an active comparator in the first part of the study (induction + consolidation). The target patient 
population (patients with ≥3% FLT3-mutated alleles), the comparator (standard induction and 
consolidation chemotherapy plus placebo), was accepted and considered standard of care in current 
treatment guidelines (NCCN and ELN guideline) for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML FLT3-ITD+ 
patients. An issue raised during SA (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/209069/2007) was the fact that 
induction/consolidation and maintenance/continuation were tested together without the possibility to 
conclude on the contribution of each component, this uncertainty remains and implies a B/R 
assessment of the complete quizartinib treatment strategy as studied.  
The proposed dosing strategy during the induction and consolidation phase of the pivotal trial was 
standard cytarabine and anthracycline with quizartinib 40 mg or matching placebo (QD for 14 days). 
This dose of 40 mg/day for induction and consolidation seems reasonable as a safe and effective 
recommended dose. During the Continuation Phase of Study AC220-A-U302, subjects received 
quizartinib at a starting dose of 30 mg QD increasing to 60 mg QD for subjects if QTcF was ≤450 ms 
for which the applicant concludes that this is a safe and effective dose, this is accepted although long-
term data is limited. 
The patient inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered adequate and the enrolled patient 
population was considered to be a representative of a relatively healthy adult population with FLT3- 
ITD positive newly–diagnosed AML with adequate performance status, and organ function to be eligible 
for the induction and consolidation therapy. A positive FLT3-ITD result is defined as an allelic ratio of 
FLT3-ITD to total FLT3 ≥ 3% in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Given the risk of QTc prolongation, 
patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease were excluded. Also, adequate renal

Page 84/130 
 
 
 
 
 
and hepatic function is needed for inclusion. The indication wording is according to the proposed 
inclusion criteria of the pivotal trial.  
The chosen primary endpoint, OS is considered adequate to demonstrate clinical benefit in the context 
of first-line treatment of AML. The secondary endpoints, EFS, CRc , CR, CR with FLT3-ITD MRD 
negativity are considered adequate endpoints and relevant in the context of the studied population. 
Several changes occurred during the trial with respect to the endpoint selection. Initially the primary 
endpoint was EFS. However, in Protocol Amendment 5 the primary endpoint was changed from EFS to 
dual primary endpoints of EFS and OS. Subsequently, based on FDA feedback EFS was then changed 
to a secondary endpoint in Protocol Amendment 6, and the definition of EFS was changed in Protocol 
Amendment 7. Under the final protocol amendment with OS as the sole primary endpoint, the study 
met its primary objective. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A relatively high number of major protocol violations occurred in the pivotal study. The nature of the 
protocol deviations and the distribution across treatment arms did not appear to impact the 
conclusions regarding efficacy and safety drawn from the submitted data to a relevant extent. The 
main amendment pertained to the definition of the secondary endpoint EFS (per FDA criteria, including 
a 42 day time window).  
Demographic and baseline characteristics for subjects in the ITT Analysis Set were generally well 
balanced between the two arms. Approximately 25% of patients was older than 65 years. Subjects 
were evenly distributed among treatment arms by age, sex, race. Patients could be considered as 
relatively fit with ECOG 0-2 (only 15% had ECOG: 2). Baseline AML characteristics were generally 
comparable between the 2 treatment arms, the median time from initial diagnosis to randomisation 
was short, 1.86 (0.9, 5.3) weeks in the quizartinib arm and 1.71 (1.0, 9.1) weeks in the placebo arm, 
this small delay between diagnosis and randomisation was due to the time needed for FLT3-ITD 
analysis confirming FLT3-ITD positivity. The majority of subjects in both the quizartinib and placebo 
arms had an intermediate or unfavourable cytogenetic risk (80.6% vs 81.2%). NPM1 mutations were 
reported in 282 (52.3%) subjects with a similar distribution in the quizartinib and placebo arms.  
Around a third of patients in both arms discontinued study treatment by the end of the induction 
phase. Even though the number of discontinuations during the induction phase was very similar 
between the study arms, there was an imbalance between in reason for discontinuation of treatment 
with more patients in the quizartinib arm discontinuing due to an AE, or following a decision by the 
subject or investigator.  
The study met its primary endpoint of OS with a HR of 0.776 (0.615- 0.979) and a 2-sided p value: 
0.03. Comparison of the median OS values (quiz;31.9, placebo: 15.1 months) is not informative since 
the Kaplan-Meier curves plateau around the median and estimates of the median do not describe the 
true treatment effect. The median follow-up time was 39.2 months (95% CI of 37.2 to 41.5 months) in 
the quizartinib arm. The quizartinib arm had a higher plateau, with 49.9% (95%CI: 43.7-55.9) of the 
patients surviving at the 3-year time point, versus 41.1% (95%CI: 35.0-47.0) of the patients in the 
placebo arm. There is a suggestion of early OS detriment (up to approximately 5 months), more early 
deaths (i.e., deaths within 30/60 days of initiation of study drug) occurred with quizartinib compared 
to placebo, this will be further discussed in conjunction with safety (B/R section).  
The early OS detriment with crossing of the survival curves after ~5 months and the survival curves 
reaching a plateau means that the proportional hazards assumption is not fulfilled. The log-rank test 
remains a valid test of the null hypothesis of equal survival when hazards are non-proportional (i.e. 
type 1 error is not inflated), although the power is optimal under proportional hazards. However, non-
proportional hazards imply that the HR may not be an ideal summary measure of the treatment effect. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 85/130 
 
 
 
Therefore, the treatment effect should be supported by additional effect measures. One possibility is 
the difference in survival probability at milestones. Another effect measure is the restricted mean 
survival time (RMST) difference, which provides the difference in life expectancy until a given time 
point τ. The applicant provided an exploratory analysis of RMST (difference) using cutoff time points of 
36, 42, and 48 months. RMST (95% CI) survival time for subjects who received quizartinib was 
prolonged by 2.75 months (0.35, 5.15) at 36 months, 3.26 months (0.39, 6.13) at 42 months, 3.81 
months (0.46, 7.16) at 48 months, and 4.53 months (0.55, 8.51) at 55.8 months. The observed 
differences between the quizartinib and placebo groups were in line with the primary OS analysis 
results.  
The study design did not disentangle the contribution of different stages of quizartinib treatment on the 
overall survival and the potential influence of subsequent therapies and treatment decisions, but it is 
agreed that the OS analysis is compliant with the usual regulatory standard for OS analysis, i.e. the 
estimand is targeted where all intercurrent events are accounted for by the treatment policy strategy 
(patients are followed for survival irrespective of the occurrence of intercurrent events such as 
treatment discontinuations). During follow up for OS, in addition to receiving already approved AML 
therapies and HSCT as subsequent treatment options, patients in the study also moved over to a new 
clinical trial for another investigational drug or received treatments that may not be available to all 
patients in Europe.  
Subjects were permitted to undergo allo-HSCT after CR or CRi was achieved per protocol. Allogeneic 
HSCT was to be performed after the Induction Phase, anytime during the Consolidation Phase or, if 
certain criteria were met, within 3 months of the Continuation Phase. A slightly higher number of 
subjects in the quizartinib than in the placebo arms underwent protocol-specified allo-HSCT after 
Induction Phase (102 [38.1%] subjects in the quizartinib arm and 91 [33.6%] in the placebo arm). 
With respect to non-protocol HSCTs, the applicant has clarified that any HSCTs after treatment 
discontinuation were non-protocol-specified. Most subjects had non-protocol-specified HSCT after the 
Induction Phase or the Consolidation Phase and no relevant difference between arms was observed (44 
quiz and 39 placebo subjects). Data with regard to non-protocol AML and non-protocol HSCT are 
considered unreliable as there is an indication that not all subsequent (non-protocol) therapies were 
recorded for all patients. Given there is information missing on subsequent therapies for some patients 
who discontinued treatment, it is likely that more patients received non-protocol-specified HSCTs.  
The subgroup analysis for OS for sex, race, ECOG status, choice of anthracycline show consistent 
results, although older patients (age>=60 years) appear to show less benefit of quizartinib treatment 
compared to placebo. It is acknowledged that this subgroup analysis was not powered to determine 
the B/R in elderly and age alone does not determine eligibility for intensive therapy, but this should be 
assessed in conjunction with the observed toxicity in this population (discussed further in B/R section). 
NPM1 mutation alone is indicative for favourable prognosis, however the superior prognosis is limited 
to those with NPM1 mutation who do not have a FLT3-ITD mutation and a normal karyotype. In this 
study quizartinib treatment indicated a lower HR for the patients with a NPM1 mutation than for 
patients without a NPM1 mutation. Additional subgroup analysis for FLT3-ITD %VAF subgroups plus 
NPM1-status to confirm that there is a benefit and no clinically relevant negative (detrimental) effect 
on the primary endpoint OS in all subgroups and especially those such as FLT3-ITD low plus NPM1wt 
will be presented in a separate biomarker report expected Q1/2024. The HR for the subgroup for low 
white blood cell counts at diagnosis (WBC <40x10^9/L) was higher than for the subgroup with WBC 
≥40x10^9/L (i.e. HR 0.961 compared to HR 0.621, respectively). There were no continuous WBC data 
available at initial diagnosis to investigate clinical outcomes by several WBC cut-off points, hampering 
determination of a WBC level at which treatment is less effective. Moreover, lower efficacy is likely not 
dependent on low WBC alone but influenced by multiple factors. As such, no restriction of the 
indication is proposed. In order to exclude confounding factors for the observed difference in OS, the

applicant has presented the baseline demographics of both subgroups in which several imbalances 
were observed possibly impacting prognosis (genetic abnormalities, e.g. mutated NPM1, ECOG 2 score, 
race, and % of subjects ≥65 years). In order to understand the potential influence of these factors, 
adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted estimates of the treatment effects for the factors expected 
to impact prognosis have been presented during assessment, supporting the primary OS results. 
The key secondary endpoint of EFS was based on a response of CR as assessed by the IRC. For this 
analysis, ITF was defined as not achieving CR within 42 days from the start of the last cycle of 
induction chemotherapy, per the FDA AML guidance (FDA, 2020). Based on this definition, there was 
no statistically significant difference between the quizartinib and placebo arm. This is likely due to the 
low median EFS values (0.03 months quizartinib arm versus 0.71 months in the placebo arm, this is in 
part caused by the stringent definition of induction treatment failure ITF (i.e. a large number of 
subjects with refractory disease were considered to have EFS events on Day 1 due to the 42-day 
window requirement). Additionally, the applicant has defined EFS in 2 different ways (the initial 
protocol definition and FDA’s definition without considering the 42 days timepoint. These did show a 
numerical difference between the 2 treatment arms, in favour of quizartinib and in support of the 
primary endpoint, e.g. FDA’s definition without the 42 day restriction (median EFS 5.0 vs 3.4 months, 
HR: 0.828, 95%CI 0.669-0.999), per protocol definition (median EFS 11.9 months vs 5.7 months, HR: 
0.729, 95%CI 0.592-0.897). However, since the analysis of EFS was not statistically significant, formal 
hierarchical testing was not continued for the secondary endpoints.  
Numerically there was no difference in rates of CR, CR with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity, and CRc with 
FLT3-ITD MRD negativity at the end of induction were similar between treatment arms. Higher rates of 
CRi in the quizartinib arm (45 [16.8%] subjects) compared with the placebo arm (26 [9.6%] subjects) 
were observed, however CRi is a less stringent definition of CR as hematologic recovery is incomplete. 
The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain because of non-relapse mortality due to infections. An 
increased RFS and duration of CR was observed with quizartinib (median RFS;39.3 and 13.6 months, 
and median duration of CR of 38.6 months versus 12.4 months quizartinib vs placebo). The study was 
not designed to detect a difference for these parameters, therefore these results provide limited 
support in terms of the durability of effect of quizartinib. With respect to the duration of response, 
although the percentage of patients with CR is similar between the arms, the DOR is not based on a 
randomised comparison because it only includes patients based on a post treatment event, ie: those 
who had complete remission. It is reassuring that the demographic/baseline characteristics of the 
patients who achieved CR indicated no relevant differences between the two treatment groups, in 
particular with regard to cytogenetic risk groups, FLT3-ITD VAF subgroups and NPM1 mutations status. 
Several sensitivity analyses have been presented during the assessment and the results from these are 
consistent with the original DOR results.  
While the single pivotal trial is positive on its primary endpoint, the measured effect on OS is not 
supported by a convincing impact on relevant pharmacodynamic endpoints, such a CR or MRD. This is 
of particular concern considering the limited statistical strength of the evidence for efficacy (p=0.03). 
Based on these concerns, the SAG-O was consulted. Following the rationale of the SAG-O, the OS 
benefit is considered to be established with reasonable certainty since other exploratory data support 
this effect. Lack of an effect on FLT3-ITD MRD negativity is not considered to weaken the conclusions 
as the surrogacy of MRD in this population is far from being established and the FLT3-ITD assay may 
not detect all mutations. Furthermore, although EFS rate based on failure to achieve CR at 42 days 
after last chemotherapy did not show convincing activity for quizartinib, the more relevant timepoint 
would be 56 days, which showed a more consistent effect in exploratory analyses. Furthermore, a 
longer duration of response was observed for quizartinib v. placebo in exploratory analyses, indicating 
higher activity in the experimental arm. Overall, the effect on OS is considered convincing and 
sufficiently supported by exploratory data.

Additional expert consultation 
Scientific advice group (SAG) 
The opinion of a SAG-O on the clinical relevance of the treatment effect was requested. The following 
question was addressed during the meeting;  
While the single pivotal trial of this study is positive on its primary endpoint, the measured effect on 
OS is not supported by a convincing impact on pharmacodynamic endpoints, such a CR or MRD, that 
would isolate the activity of quizartinib. This is of particular concern considering the limited statistical 
strength of the evidence for efficacy (p=0.03). Given these concerns, the SAG was asked whether it 
considered that the efficacy of quizartinib has been established with reasonable certainty. 
The SAG agreed that study AC220-A-U302 met its primary endpoint (overall survival; OS).  
The majority of SAG considered this study to be sufficiently convincing due to the statistically and 
clinically significant effects observed in terms of the relevant primary endpoint OS, although the 
statistical evidence was considered low (P=0.03) and prespecified secondary endpoints (CR-rate at day 
42 after last chemotherapy, MRD negativity and event-free-survival; EFS) failed to demonstrate a 
statistical significance in support of OS for the experimental arm.  
Nevertheless, the OS benefit was considered to be established with reasonable certainty since other 
exploratory data support this effect.  
Lack of an effect on FLT3-ITD MRD negativity was not considered to weaken the conclusions as the 
surrogacy of MRD in this population is far from being established and the FLT3-ITD assay may not 
detect all mutations.  
Furthermore, although EFS rate based on failure to achieve CR at 42 days after last chemotherapy did 
not show convincing activity for quizartinib, it was considered that the more relevant timepoint would 
be 56 days, which showed a more consistent effect in exploratory analyses. Furthermore, a longer 
duration of response was observed for quizartinib v. placebo in exploratory analyses, indicating higher 
activity in the experimental arm.  
Overall, the majority of the SAG concluded that the effect on OS was convincing and sufficiently 
supported by exploratory data.  
A small minority disagreed, considering that the statistical significance was not compelling if seen in 
the context of a single pivotal study with failed planned secondary endpoints in multiplicity-adjusted 
analyses, variable endpoint definitions and adjudication for event-free survival, lack of an effect on 
MRD negativity, the considerable additional toxicity, early higher death rate, imbalances in induction 
regimens, and protocol amendments. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The single pivotal trial in a newly diagnosed AML add-on treatment setting met its primary endpoint 
demonstrating an OS difference of quizartinib add-on compared to placebo. The single pivotal trial 
showed an approximate 10% difference in potential cure rate, as evidenced by the plateaus of the KM-
curves, but this is not supported by clinically relevant differences in secondary endpoints. The OS 
benefit is considered to be established with reasonable certainty since other exploratory data (EFS 
following 56 day definition, and DOR) support this effect. While exploratory, reliability of these 
endpoints was supported by several additional sensitivity analyses presented during assessment. 
Altogether, efficacy of quizartinib in the applied indication is considered to be sufficiently established.

2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of quizartinib has been characterised based on safety data from pivotal clinical Phase 
3 Study AC220-A-U302 (QuANTUM-First).  
Main additional support is provided by a pooled analysis of safety data from pivotal Study AC220-A-
U302 and 9 completed clinical studies in AML (n=1081): 2 studies in newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD (+) 
AML and 7 studies in relapsed/refractory (R/R) FLT3-ITD (+) AML. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Study AC220-A-U302 
The median overall treatment duration was 75.0 days for quizartinib and 66.5 days for placebo. 
Approximately 44% of subjects received quizartinib as monotherapy in the Continuation Phase with a 
median treatment duration of 67 weeks, and approximately 30% of patients (n=79) in the quizartinib 
arm were treated for >365 days (Table 19). 
The median average daily dose was the same in both treatment groups (40 mg); the median 
cumulative dose was higher in the quizartinib arm than in the placebo arm (1640.0 mg vs 1140.0 mg, 
respectively). The median relative dose intensity (RDI =dose intensity/planned dose intensity x 100) 
was 100% for both treatment arms (range: 20.97% to 207.14% with quizartinib and 40.46% to 
200.00% with placebo). 
In the Continuation Phase, patients in the quizartinib group were treated for a median (min, max) of 
16.0 (1, 36) cycles. The median dose intensity was 37.00 mg/day. A total of 28.4% of subjects 
received ≥12 to <24 cycles, 36.2% received ≥24 to ≤36 cycles, and 15.5% received 36 cycles. The 
median RDI for the overall study period was 85%, The majority of the patients in the quizartinib arm 
had a quizartinib dose escalation to 60 mg in the Continuation Phase. A total of 43 out of the 116 
subjects in the quizartinib group who entered the Continuation Phase had no dose escalation, mostly 
due to use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or TEAEs. 
All AML Pool 
Median overall treatment duration was 84 days in the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, the 
median average daily dose was 40 mg, with a median cumulative dose of 2880 mg. In the >60 mg 
group of the All AML Pool, the median cumulative dose was 7605.0 mg.

Common TEAEs 
Study AC220-A-U302 
The most frequently reported types of TEAEs by system organ class (SOC) in the pivotal study were 
gastrointestinal disorders, infections, general disorders, and blood disorders in both treatment arms 
(Table 21). Infections, blood disorders, metabolism disorders, and investigations occurred more 
frequently (higher incidence of ≥5 pp) with quizartinib than with placebo. 
The most frequently reported preferred terms (PTs; >30% of subjects) in the quizartinib arm were 
febrile neutropenia, pyrexia, diarrhoea, hypokalaemia, and nausea, all of which occurred at similar 
frequencies to the placebo arm. Among the TEAEs reported in >10% of subjects, the events of 
neutropenia, ALT increased, ECG QT prolonged, neutrophil count decreased, and headache occurred 
more frequently (≥5 pp higher incidence) in the quizartinib arm than in the placebo.  
All AML Pool 
Generally, the pattern and incidence of TEAEs in the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool were 
consistent with those in the quizartinib arm of Study AC220-A-U302.

TEAE with toxicity Grade 3 or 4 
Study AC220-A-U302 
In the pivotal trial, the proportions of subjects with Grade 3/4 events were similar between the 
treatment arms (~80%; Table 22). The most frequently reported Grade 3/4 TEAEs (≥10% incidence) 
in the quizartinib arm included cytopenias (febrile neutropenia and neutropenia), hypokalaemia, and 
infections (pneumoniae), of which the event of neutropenia occurred at a ≥5 pp higher incidence in the 
quizartinib arm than in the placebo arm (18.1% vs. 8.6%). Among less frequently reported Grade 3/4 
TEAEs, neutrophil count decreased also occurred at a ≥5 pp higher incidence in the quizartinib arm 
than in the placebo arm (8.7% vs. 3.4%). 
All AML Pool 
Generally, the pattern and incidence of Grade 3/4 TEAEs in the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool 
were consistent with those in the quizartinib arm of Study AC220-A-U302. Blood cytopenias were the 
most frequently reported Grade 3/4 events in the All AML Pool with no consistent trend according to 
dose. Infections (pneumoniae and sepsis) were the second most frequently reported types of severe 
TEAE; no dose-dependent trend was noted for these TEAEs. 
The incidence of Grade 3/4 TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged was highest in the >60 mg group of the All 
AML Pool.

Treatment-related TEAEs 
Study AC220-A-U302 
A higher proportion of patients in the quizartinib arm experienced TEAEs that were assessed as related 
to study drug by the investigator compared with the placebo arm (60.4% vs. 36.2%; Table 2323). The 
most frequent (≥5%) reported related TEAEs in the quizartinib arm included cytopenias (neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, neutrophil count decreased, febrile neutropenia, and anaemia), ECG QT prolonged, 
gastrointestinal disorders (nausea and diarrhea), ALT increased, and pyrexia. Neutropenia, neutrophil 
count decreased, and ECG QT prolonged occurred at a frequency ≥5 pp higher with quizartinib than 
with placebo. 
Related Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported in 43% vs. 22.8%, of which cytopenias were most frequently 
reported and neutropenia the only event with a frequency ≥5 pp higher with quizartinib than with 
placebo (15.5% vs. 3.7%). 
All AML Pool 
The proportion of patients with related TEAEs increased with higher dose levels (63.3% at <30 mg to 
86.9% with >60 mg dose). The types of study drug-related TEAEs reported in the 30 to 60 mg group 
of the All AML Pool were consistent with the quizartinib arm of Study AC220-A-U302. PTs showing 
highest increases (>10%) with dose were ECG QT prolonged, anaemia, vomiting, febrile neutropenia, 
diarrhoea, fatigue and decreased appetite.

Overall, 54.0% of patients in the quizartinib arm and 45.9% of patients in the placebo arm had at least 
1 TESAE. In both treatment arms, the most frequently reported types of TESAEs were infections 
(pneumoniae, septic shock and sepsis) and blood disorders (febrile neutropenia). 
Related SAEs were reported for 15.5% of patients in the quizartinib arm and 10.8% in the placebo 
arm. The most frequently reported (≥1% incidence) study drug-related TESAEs in the quizartinib arm 
were febrile neutropenia (2.6% with quizartinib vs. 1.5% with placebo), pneumoniae (1.5% vs. 0.7%), 
neutropenia (1.1% vs. 0%), and myelosuppression (1.1% vs. 0%). 
All AML Pool 
The proportion of patients who experienced a SAE increased with increasing dose levels (30% at <30 
mg dose to 79.6% with >60 mg dose). Largest increases (>10%) were observed for febrile 
neutropenia and AML/disease progression. 
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, 61.6% of patients had at least 1 TESAE. Generally, the 
types of TESAEs reported in the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool were consistent with those 
reported in Study AC220-A-U302. 
Related SAEs were reported for 22.4% of patients in the 30-60 mg group. As with the overall TESAEs, 
the incidence of study drug-related TESAEs was highest in the >60 mg group of the All AML Pool 
(47.9%), which was primarily driven by higher rates of febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and ECG QT 
prolonged.

On-treatment deaths were defined as death that occurred between the first dose date and ≤30 days 
after the last dose of study drug. In Study AC220-A-U302, all on-treatment deaths were required to be 
reported as AEs on the death form of the electronic case report form. However, in Studies AC220-002 
and 2689-CL-2004 included in the all AML pool, AML progression could have been selected as the 
cause of death for on-treatment deaths. An overview of on-treatment death and Treatment-emergent 
Adverse Events Associated with Death are shown in Table 25 and table 26 respectively. 
Study AC220-A-U302 
For most patients, the primary cause of death was an AE, the majority of which were not considered 
related to study drug by the investigator. In both treatment arms, the most frequently reported types 
of TEAEs with an outcome of death were infections (septic shock and sepsis). These events were more 
common in the quizartinib arm than the placebo arm.

More early deaths (ie, deaths within 60 days of initiation of study drug) occurred with quizartinib 
compared with placebo. In total, 17 (6.4%) vs. 11 (4.1%) patients, respectively died due to an TEAE 
within 60 days of study drug initiation, of which 14 (5.3%) vs. 8 (3.0%) patients, respectively, died 
within 30 days of study drug initiation (Table 27). Two additional patients in the quizartinib arm died 
after Randomisation but before receiving study drug. Infections (i.e. sepsis or septic shock) were the 
most common cause of early death in both treatment groups. Patients in the quizartinib group who 
died within 60 days of the first dose of study drug were older than those who did not (ie, 55.0% vs. 
23.7% of subjects were ≥65 years old). In addition, patients who died early in the quizartinib group 
had worse ECOG PS than those who did not (ie, 35.0% vs. 15.5% of subjects had ECOG PS of 2). 
Similar trends for older age and worse ECOG PS were observed for patients who died early vs. those 
who did not in the placebo group. 
Table 27. Summary of early deaths (safety analysis set, study AC220-A-U302) 
All AML Pool 
In the 30-60 mg group, 23.4% of patients died while on treatment and TEAEs associated with death 
occurred in 11.2% of patients. The incidence of on-treatment death was highest in the >60 mg group 
of the All AML Pool, predominantly due to a higher proportion of AML disease progression (due to 
differences in reporting between the early studies and Study AC220-A-U302). 
TEAEs by treatment duration 
Study AC220-A-U302 
The incidences of study drug-related TEAEs, Grade 3/4 TEAEs, TESAEs, and TEAEs associated with 
study drug interruption increased with longer treatment durations. 
The incidences of TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation and death as outcome decreased 
with longer treatment duration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023

Of the TEAEs reported in ≥20% of subjects in the quizartinib arm, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, 
neutrophil count decreased, insomnia, oedema peripheral, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, upper 
respiratory tract infection, muscle spasms, cough, and rash occurred more frequently with longer 
treatment duration. Similar results were observed in the placebo arm. Apart from blood cytopenias, the 
rest of the events were generally acute, intermittent events. 
TEAEs by phase (induction, consolidation, continuation) 
Induction and Consolidation Phase 
During the Induction and Consolidation Phases, frequencies of (related) grade ≥3 TEAEs and (related) 
SAEs and (related) TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation were in general lower compared 
to the overall study period and the continuation phase in the quizartinib and placebo arm (Table 28). 
For most categories, differences between quizartinib and placebo treatment arms became smaller than 
those of the overall study period. The type of the most frequently reported TEAEs in both treatment 
arms were similar to the overall study period.  
However, the proportion of patients with a TEAEs associated with death were numerically higher in the 
quizartinib arm than in the placebo arm during the Induction and Consolidation Phases (19 [7.2%] 
subjects versus 13 [4.9%] and 8 [4.6%] subjects versus 5 [2.9%], respectively), whereas the 
opposite was observed for the continuation phase (2.6% vs. 7.6% in the quizartinib and placebo 
arms). During both the induction and consolidation phases, similar to the overall study period, 
infections were the most frequent TEAEs associated with death as outcome. 
Table 28. Overview of All TEAEs, Overall Study Period and by Phase (Safety Analysis Set) 
Continuation Phase 
In total, 116 (43.8%) subjects in the quizartinib arm and 92 (34.3%) subjects in the placebo arm 
entered the Continuation Phase. Frequencies of almost all TEAE categories increased compared to the

induction and consolidation phase. Highest increases were observed for drug-related TEAE and 
(related) TEAEs associated with study drug interruption or reduction: 
-  Related Grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported more frequently in the continuation phase (53.4% 
in continuation phase vs. 21.1% and 19.7%, in respectively induction and consolidation 
phase). This substantial increase was not observed in the placebo arm. Among the most 
commonly reported study drug-related TEAEs during the Continuation Phase, the events of 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, ECG QT prolonged, neutrophil count decreased, anemia, 
nausea, and leukopenia occurred more frequently (≥5 pp higher incidence) in the 
quizartinib arm than in the placebo arm. The most commonly reported study drug-related 
Grade 3/4 TEAEs during the Continuation Phase (≥3% of subjects in either arm) were 
cytopenias which occurred at a higher incidence in the quizartinib arm than in the placebo 
arm (neutropenia [28.4% vs. 3% with placebo], neutrophil count decreased [8.6% vs. 
0%], and thrombocytopenia [6.9% vs. 2.2%]). 
-  TEAEs and related TEAEs associated with study drug dose discontinuation, and in particular 
interruption and reduction were more frequently reported in the continuation phase 
compared to the induction and consolidation phase. Cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, anemia, and cytopenia) and gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhea, and 
vomiting) were the most frequent events associated with study drug discontinuation during 
this phase and were reported by subjects only in the quizartinib arm. Cytopenias 
(neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, thrombocytopenia, and platelet count 
decreased), infections (COVID-19 and pneumonia), and ECG QT prolonged were the most 
frequent events associated with study drug interruption during this phase and were 
primarily reported in subjects in the quizartinib arm. Dose reductions were most frequently 
associated with cytopenias and ECG QT prolonged. 
Contrary to the induction and consolidation phase, the proportion of patients with TEAEs with death as 
outcome were lower in the quizartinib arm than in the placebo arm during the Continuation Phase 
(2.6% with quizartinib vs. 7.6% with placebo). 
There did not appear to be any evidence of increasing toxicity with long-term treatment with 
quizartinib for up to 36 cycles in the Continuation Phase. For certain events, the incidence appeared 
higher (≥5 pp higher incidence) in the quizartinib arm with continued treatment (neutropenia and 
diarrhoea), although due to the low number of subjects with treatment for >12 cycles and the fact this 
category includes all cycles from Cycles 12 to 36, no consistent trend could be identified.  
AlloSCT 
During the study, a total of 102 (38.1%) patients in the quizartinib arm and 91 (33.6%) patients in the 
placebo arm underwent protocol-specified allo-HSCT, mostly during the consolidation phase. Of these, 
57 (55.9%) and 41 (45.1%) subjects, respectively, had posttransplant-related complications, with a 
higher proportion of acute and chronic GvHD reported for quizartinib-treated patients. 
AEs of Special Interest 
QT prolongation 
Quizartinib prolongs QT interval on ECG in a dose-dependent and exposure-dependent manner. This 
was observed in Phase 1-2 studies, including the higher incidence of QTcF prolongation in females 
compared with males. Therefore, risk minimisation measures for the monitoring and management of 
subjects with QTcF prolongation were incorporated into the subsequent study protocols, including 
Phase 3 Study AC220-A-U302.

Study AC220-A-U302 
In total, 49 (18.5%) subjects in the quizartinib arm and 30 (11.2%) subjects in the placebo arm 
experienced events in the TdP/QT Prolongation SMQ. The majority of these events were nonserious 
and mild or moderate in severity, resolved without any action taken with study drug, or were managed 
by study drug interruption or dose reduction. 
In both treatment arms, ECG QT prolonged was the most common event, reported in a higher 
percentage of subjects in the quizartinib arm than in the placebo arm (13.6% vs. 4.1%). The other 
most common TEAEs included syncope, fall, and presyncope, all of which were nonserious, and none of 
which was associated with any evidence of ventricular arrhythmia as a cause of the event. 
Two subjects in the quizartinib arm (no subject on placebo) experienced TESAEs of cardiac arrest  that 
were associated with recorded ventricular fibrillation on ECG, which both occurred in the context of 
Grade 3 or 4 hypokalaemia. An additional subject in the quizartinib arm died after the last dose of 
quizartinib (TESAE of death) which was associated to altered maximum average QTcF. The exact cause 
of death was unknown. 
ECG - The incidence of Grade 3 QTcF prolongation (QTcF of >500 ms) based on central ECG reading 
was 2.3% with quizartinib vs. 0.7%s in the placebo arm. Higher percentages of subjects in the 
quizartinib arm had increases in QTcF of >30 ms or >60 ms from Baseline compared with the placebo 
arm. The median time (range) to Grade 2 QTcF prolongation was 64.0 (4 to755) days in the quizartinib 
arm, and to Grade 3 QTcF prolongation 82 days (1 to 130).  
All AML pool 
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, 173 (25.9%) subjects experienced events in the TdP/QT 
Prolongation SMQ. The types of events in the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool were similar to 
those in Study AC220-A-U302, with most TEAEs being events of ECG QT prolonged. A dose-dependent 
trend in events of ECG QT prolonged was observed with the highest incidence in the >60 mg group of 
the All AML Pool. 
There was a single case of TdP in the All AML Pool (>60 mg group [quizartinib 90 mg]), which resolved 
spontaneously after study drug discontinuation. 
TESAEs of ‘death’ occurred in 2 patients in the All AML Pool and 6 (0.6%) patients experienced cardiac 
arrest. Five (0.5%) subjects experienced events of ventricular tachycardia, of which 3 had nonserious 
events with no action taken with quizartinib and 2 had serious events. 
In the >60 mg group of the All AML Pool, 2 patients experienced events of arrhythmia (type not 
specified), both of which were nonserious with no action taken with quizartinib. 
ECG - In line with the pivotal trial, 2.5% of patients in the 30-60 mg group of the All AML Pool had a 
QTcF of >500 ms. In general, there was a dose-response between quizartinib dose and QTcF 
prolongation in the All AML Pool.

Other cardiac TEAEs 
Cardiac failure 
In the pivotal trial, 2.6% of patients in the quizartinib arm and 2.2% of patients in the placebo arm 
had a TEAE related to cardiac failure. Grade ≥3 events were reported by 5 (1.9%) and 2 (0.7%) 
patients in the quizartinib and placebo arms, respectively; none resulted in a fatal outcome. One 
patient (quizartinib arm) discontinued the study drug due to the event and there were 3 patients 
(1 quizartinib; 2 placebo) for whom the dose was interrupted. 
Results in the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool were similar to those in the pivotal trial.

Ischaemic heart disease 
In total, 1 (0.4%) and 6 (2.2%) subjects in the quizartinib and placebo arms, respectively, 
experienced TEAEs related to ischemic heart disease. Grade 3/4 events were reported by 1 (0.4%) and 
4 (1.5%) patients, respectively, and 0 and 3 (1.1%) patients had TESAEs. No event resulted in a fatal 
outcome. One patient (placebo arm) discontinued study drug due to the event and there were 2 
patients (both placebo) for whom the dose was interrupted. Results in the 30 to 60 mg group of the All 
AML Pool were similar to the pivotal trial. 
Hepatic function abnormalities 
In total, 34.3% and 27.2% of patients in the quizartinib and placebo arms, respectively, experienced 
hepatic TEAEs in Study AC220-A-U302 (Table 30). Medical review of the cases with combined 
elevations in aminotransferases and total bilirubin (TBL) in the quizartinib arm did not reveal any cases 
meeting Hy’s Law criteria or serious events of drug-induced liver injury. Most of the events identified 
by the MedDRA search were non-serious and none resulted in a fatal outcome. In both treatment 
arms, the most common TEAEs (≥5%) included ALT increased, AST increased, gamma-
glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased, and blood bilirubin increased. 
Table 70. Hepatic TEAEs (≥2% of subjects in the quizartinib arm of study AC220-A-U302 or 
in the all AML pool) - MedDRA search (safety analysis set) 
Infections 
During the overall study period, the proportions of patients experiencing TEAEs, Grade 3/4 TEAEs, and 
TESAEs of infection were similar in the quizartinib group (77.0%, 45.3%, and 28.7%, respectively) and 
placebo group (70.1%, 45.9%, and 26.5%, respectively).  Infections TEAEs associated with study drug 
discontinuation and TEAEs associated with death were reported in a slightly higher proportion of 
subjects in the quizartinib group than in the placebo group (7.2% vs. 4.1% and 7.5% vs. 4.5%, 
respectively). 
The most commonly reported infections events in the study overall (ie, in >10% of subjects in either 
treatment group) were pneumonia (14.7% vs. 15.3%) and sepsis (5.7% vs. 10.4%). Septic shock, 
which was reported with a similar frequency in the quizartinib and placebo groups (in 12 [4.5%] and 8

[3.0%] patients, respectively), was the only event that led to death in >2% of patients (ie, 8 [3.0%] 
and 3 [1.1%] subjects, respectively). 
During the Continuation Phase, TEAEs, Grade 3/4 TEAEs, and TESAEs of infection were reported with 
higher frequency in the quizartinib group than in the placebo group (61.2% vs. 46.7%, 19.8% vs. 
15.2%, and 19.0% vs. 16.3%). TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation and TEAEs 
associated with death were reported in ≤1.7% of patients in both treatment groups. The most common 
event was upper respiratory tract infection (17.2% vs. 9.8%). 
The majority of the infectious events, including the serious and fatal infections, occurred in patients 
presenting with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and/or lymphopenia at the time of the event. 
Haemorrhage 
During the overall study period, the proportions of patients experiencing TEAEs and TESAEs of 
haemorrhage were similar in the quizartinib group (36.6% and 3.0%, respectively) and placebo group 
(40.3% and 3.4%, respectively), while TEAEs of Grade 3/4 were reported slightly more frequently in 
the quizartinib group than in the placebo group (7.2% vs. 4.5%).  Haemorrhage TEAEs associated with 
study drug discontinuation and TEAEs associated with death were reported with very low frequencies 
(≤1.5%) in both treatment groups. 
The most frequently reported events (ie, in >5% of patients in either treatment group) were epistaxis 
(15.1% vs. 10.8%, mostly mild/moderate in severity) and gingival bleeding (5.3% vs. 4.9%). 
Similar to what was observed for the overall study period, TEAEs of haemorrhage during the 
Continuation Phase were reported with comparable frequency in the quizartinib group (12.9%) and 
placebo group (10.9%). 
The majority of the bleeding events, including the serious and fatal infections, occurred in subjects 
presenting with Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia at the time of the event. 
Differentiation syndrome 
No events of differentiation syndrome were reported in subjects with newly diagnosed AML from Study 
AC220-A-U302. Of the 1081 subjects treated with quizartinib in the All AML Pool, 2 (0.2%) subjects 
(both in the >60 mg group) had investigator-reported TEAEs of differentiation syndrome in the setting 
of R/R AML. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
No events of TLS were reported in the quizartinib arm of Study AC220-A-U302 (1 event was reported 
in the placebo arm).  In total, 7 (0.6%) patients in the All AML Pool were reported to have TLS, 4 
(0.6%) in the 30 to 60 mg group and 3 (0.8%) in the >60 mg group. None of the cases of TLS were 
associated with death as outcome. No conclusive evidence of causal association between quizartinib 
and TLS was identified. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
No additional safety signals have been detected based on laboratory findings, vital signs or ECG 
measurement, except for myelosuppression related AEs, hepatic function abnormalities and QT 
prolongation that were discussed in the respective safety sections above.

2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
Age 
Higher incidences of TESAEs, TEAEs associated with death as outcome, and TEAEs associated with 
study drug discontinuation were observed in older subjects (≥65 years) compared with younger 
subjects (<60 and 60 to <65 years) in both treatment arms. 
While the type and incidence of TEAEs were generally similar across age subgroups, gastrointestinal 
disorders (diarrhoea, nausea, stomatitis, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite), and pruritus 
occurred more frequently in older subjects in the quizartinib arm, this pattern was not observed in the 
placebo arm. Fatal infections have occurred more frequently with quizartinib in elderly patients (i.e., 
older than 65 years), compared to younger patients (13% vs. 5.7%), especially in the early treatment 
period. 
Gender 
In the pivotal trial, Grade 4 TEAEs and TESAEs were reported more frequently in females compared to 
males. The difference in Grade 4 TEAEs was mainly driven by a higher incidence of infections and 
cytopenic events in female subjects.  In the quizartinib group, the PTs reported with higher frequency 
(ie, >2 pp) in females than males were: neutropenia, (9.2% in females vs. 6.5% in males), febrile 
neutropenia (6.4% vs. 3.2%) and septic shock (2.8% vs. 0%). The difference in TESAEs was mainly 
driven by the higher incidence of infections in female patients. In the quizartinib arm, differences >2pp 
were reported for the PTs of colitis and urinary tract infection (both 2.1% of females vs. 0% of males).  
Race/Geographic region 
TEAEs associated with death as an outcome were reported more frequently in White subjects compared 
to Asian subjects or subjects of other races and in the North American and European subgroups than in 
the Asian subgroup of the 30-60 All AML pool. 
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors 
In Study AC220-A-U302, 166 (62.6%) and 162 (60.4%) subjects in the quizartinib and placebo arms, 
respectively, used at least one concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitor during the study. 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs, TESAEs, and TEAEs associated with study drug interruption were reported more 
frequently (>5 pp higher incidence) in subjects who used strong CYP3A4 inhibitors than those who did 
not, whereas the opposite was true for TEAEs associated with death as an outcome and TEAEs 
associated with study drug discontinuation. 
Hepatic/renal impairment 
Based on the PK in patients with mild and moderate hepatic or renal impairment, no dose adjustment 
is required for these patients (please refer to PK section of this report). Safety in patients with severe 
hepatic or renal impairment is unknown. This is reflected in SmPC section 4.2. 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events

2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Several drug-drug-interaction studies have been performed of which results are presented in the PK 
section of this report.

No clinical studies have been conducted that assess the use of quizartinib during pregnancy or 
breastfeeding. No pregnancies have been reported in quizartinib-treated subjects in the clinical 
development programme. 
Given the target patient population and nature of quizartinib, withdrawal, rebound effects or drug 
abuse were not anticipated, and consequently no studies were conducted to assess these effects. 
Available safety data do not indicate any issues related to the effects on the ability to drive or operate 
machinery or the impairment of mental ability. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, the percentage of patients with TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation was higher 
with quizartinib than with placebo (20.4% vs. 8.6%). This difference was observed in all treatment 
phases with the highest incidence in the Continuation Phase (15.5% vs. 7.6%). The most common 
TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation were infections (7.2% vs. 4.1%) and cytopenias 
(3.0% vs. 0). ECG QT prolonged associated with study drug discontinuation was reported by 0.8% vs. 
0 patients in the placebo arms. 
The number of patients who discontinued quizartinib due to TEAEs in the 3 treatment phases were 
26/265 (9.8%), 10/173 (5.8%), and 18/116 (15.5%) in the Induction, Consolidation, and Continuation 
Phases, respectively. 
In the Continuation Phase, cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia) and 
gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting) were the most frequent events associated 
with study drug discontinuation and were reported by patients only in the quizartinib arm. 
Generally, the incidence and types of TEAEs associated with discontinuation in the 30 to 60 mg group 
were consistent with those reported in the pivotal trial. 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction 
The percentage of patients with TEAEs associated with study drug dose reduction was higher with 
quizartinib than with placebo (18.9% vs. 6.3%). This difference was primarily observed during the 
Continuation Phase. The most frequently reported TEAEs associated with study drug dose reduction in 
the quizartinib arm were cytopenias (neutropenia [6% vs. 1.1%], neutrophil count decreased [3.4% 
vs. 0%], thrombocytopenia [3% vs. 0.7%] and platelet count decreased [1.5% vs. 0%]) and ECG QT 
prolonged (3.8% vs. 0.4%). Apart from neutropenia, no events occurred at a >5 pp higher incidence in 
the quizartinib arm compared with the placebo arm.  
Integration of data for the All AML Pool was not performed, as data on dose reductions due to a TEAE 
were not captured across all clinical studies included in the All AML Pool in a manner consistent enough 
to allow for pooled analysis.   
TEAEs leading to dose interruption 
During the overall study period, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs associated with study drug 
interruption was higher with quizartinib than with placebo (34.0% vs. 20.1%), this difference was 
primarily observed during the Continuation Phase. The most frequently reported TEAEs associated with 
study drug interruption in the quizartinib arm were cytopenias (neutropenia, neutrophil count 
decreased, thrombocytopenia, platelet count decreased, myelosuppression, and febrile neutropenia), 
ECG QT prolonged, pneumonia, AST increased, diarrhoea, and stomatitis. Apart from neutropenia 
(7.2% vs. 0.7%), no other events occurred at a >5 pp higher incidence in the quizartinib arm 
compared with the placebo arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 110/130 
 
 
 
In the 30 to 60 mg group, 31.8% of patients had TEAEs associated with study drug interruption.  
Generally, the incidence and types of TEAEs associated with study drug interruption were consistent 
with those reported in the pivotal trial. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively, from 18 Jun 2019 to 28 Oct 2021, 228 patients are estimated to have received 
quizartinib in the post-marketing setting, all of whom were in Japan. During this period, AEs were 
reported in 134 cases with 269 events in the post-marketing setting. Out of the 134 cases, SAEs were 
reported in 66 cases with 96 events, and common SAEs (more than 5 events) were disease 
progression (14 events), neutrophil count decreased (8 events), and febrile neutropenia (5 events). 
AEs leading to fatal outcome were reported in 34 cases, and common AEs leading to fatal outcome 
were disease progression (14 events), death (4 events; also mostly due to AML progression), AML (2 
events), and sepsis (2 events). There were no cardiac events with fatal outcome. In total, 29 AEs of 
ECG QT prolonged were reported (25 nonserious and 4 SAEs). 
2.6.8.11.  Summary of Adverse Drug Reaction  
The most common adverse reactions were increased alanine aminotransferase (58.9%), decreased 
platelet count (40.0%), decreased haemoglobin (37.4%), diarrhoea (37.0%), nausea (34.0%), 
abdominal pain (29.4%), headache (27.5%), vomiting (24.5%) and decreased neutrophil count 
(21.9%). 
The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were decreased platelet count (40%), decreased 
haemoglobin (35.5%), decreased neutrophil count (21.5%), increased alanine aminotransferase 
(12.1%), bacteraemia (7.2%) and fungal infections (5.7%). The most common serious adverse 
reactions in the Vanflyta arm were neutropenia (3.0%), fungal infections (2.3%) and herpes infections 
(2.3%). Adverse reactions with fatal outcome were fungal infections (0.8%) and cardiac arrest (0.4%). 
The most common adverse reactions associated with dose interruption of quizartinib were neutropenia 
(10.6%), thrombocytopenia (4.5%) and prolonged electrocardiogram QT interval (2.6%). The most 
common adverse reactions associated with dose reduction were neutropenia (9.1%), 
thrombocytopenia (4.5%) and prolonged electrocardiogram QT interval (3.8%). 
The most common adverse reaction associated with permanent discontinuation of quizartinib was 
thrombocytopenia (1.1%).  
Adverse reactions are listed in table 38 below according to MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC). Within 
each SOC, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency with the most frequent reactions first, using 
the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon 
(≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot 
be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency category, adverse reactions are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The total pooled safety database for quizartinib consists of 1081 patients, of whom 669 were treated at 
the targeted dose range of 30 to 60 mg. In total 115 patients (of whom 79 were included in the pivotal 
trial) received quizartinib 30-60 mg for 1 year or longer. The safety database is considered acceptable 
to establish the safety profile in newly diagnosed AML patients, although the possibility to identify rare 
adverse events is still limited. Long-term safety will continue to be monitored as part of the routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.

Almost all patients in Study AC220-A-U302 experienced one AE of any grade and approximately 92% 
of patients experienced at least one Grade 3 or higher AE with quizartinib treatment. This is also 
observed in the placebo arm and expected considering the intensive chemotherapy backbone therapy. 
Most other TEAE categories were reported with at least a numerical higher frequency in the quizartinib 
arm compared to the placebo arm, in particular TEAEs associated with discontinuation/interruption and 
treatment related TEAEs.  
AEs were most frequently reported across the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders, infections, general 
disorders, and blood disorders. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the quizartinib arm were febrile 
neutropenia, pyrexia, diarrhoea, hypokalaemia and nausea, all of which occurred at similar frequencies 
in both treatment arms. Largest differences compared to placebo were observed for the TEAEs of 
neutropenia (20.4% in quizartinib arm vs. 10.1% in placebo arm), ECG QT prolonged (13.6% vs. 
4.1%), headache (27.5% vs. 19.8%), neutrophil count decreased (10.2% vs. 4.5%) and ALT increased 
(15.8% vs. 10.1%).  
Most of these toxicities were also observed preclinically. The bone marrow and lymphoid organs were 
the principal target tissues affected. The cardiac effect on QT prolongation mainly via blockade of IKs 
current and hepatic enzyme abnormalities (as discussed below) were noted preclinically as well.  
The most frequently reported Grade 3/4 TEAEs (≥10% incidence) in the quizartinib arm included 
cytopenias and infections, of which only neutropenia occurred with >5% higher incidence compared to 
the placebo arm (18.1% vs. 8.6%).  
Treatment related TEAEs were reported more frequently in the quizartinib arm compared to the 
placebo arm: 60.4% vs. 36.2%. The most common related TEAEs reported with >5% difference 
compared to the placebo arm were: neutropenia (17.4% vs. 3.7%), ECG QT prolongation (11.7% vs. 
3%) and neutrophil count decreased (7.9% vs. 1.9). Related Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported in 43% 
vs. 22.8%, of which cytopenias were most frequently reported and again neutropenia the only event 
with a frequency ≥5 pp higher with quizartinib than with placebo (15.5% vs. 3.7%). 
TESAEs were reported in 54% of quizartinib treated patients vs. 45.9% in the placebo group. In both 
treatment arms, the most frequently reported types were infections (pneumonia [6.4% vs. 5.6%], 
septic shock [4.2% vs. 3%] and sepsis [3.8% vs. 5.2%]) and blood disorders (febrile neutropenia 
[10.9% vs. 8.2%]). Related TESAEs were reported in 15.5% vs. 10.8%. The most frequently reported 
(≥1% incidence) related TESAEs were febrile neutropenia (2.6% with quizartinib vs. 1.5% with 
placebo), pneumonia (1.5% vs. 0.7%), neutropenia (1.1% vs. 0%), and myelosuppression (1.1% vs. 
0%). 
A higher incidence of TEAEs associated with death within 30 days after last dose of study drug was 
reported in the quizartinib arm (n=30, 11.3%) compared to the placebo arm (n=23, 8.6%). In 
particular, more early deaths (i.e., deaths within 60 days of initiation of study drug) occurred with 
quizartinib compared with placebo (7.5% vs. 4.9%). In the continuation phase, the proportion of 
deaths was lower compared to the early treatment phases, and also lower compared to the placebo 
arm.  
Main causes of death in the early induction and consolidation treatment phases were infections (mostly 
sepsis/septic shock). Older age and worse ECOG PS were the only factors identified as potentially 
associated with the observed early deaths in Study AC220-A-U302. A similar trend for older age and 
worse ECOG PS was observed for patients who died early vs. those who did not in the placebo group 
and these factors are routinely considered when selecting patients for intensive chemotherapy. 
Although only 3 deaths were considered related to quizartinib treatment by the investigator, for most 
patients AEs of (febrile) neutropenia and infection were reported. Neutropenia and infection might 
indeed be secondary to AML or the intensive chemotherapy backbone, but it cannot be completely 
Assessment report

Page 113/130 
 
 
 
ruled out that the myelosuppressive effect of quizartinib itself has contributed as well. The proposed 
risk minimazations in the SmPC are considered appropriate.  
When analysing AEs by treatment phase, frequencies of almost all TEAE categories increased in the 
continuation phase compared to the earlier treatment phases, except for TEAEs with death as 
outcome. Most pronounced increases with quizartinib were observed for related TEAEs and (related) 
TEAEs associated with treatment interruption or reduction, mainly caused by cytopenias and ECG QT 
prolonged. This is reflected in the fact that only a small proportion of patients (7.9%) was able to fully 
complete the continuation phase up to 36 cycles. The optimal continuation duration (beyond 12 
months) remains uncertain, as no further studies are planned to investigate this.  
TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation were more frequently reported for quizartinib (20.4% 
vs. 8.6%). The most common TEAEs resulting in discontinuation were infections/septic shock (7.2% 
vs. 4.1%) and cytopenias (3.0% vs. 0). The largest differences with placebo were observed in the 
continuation phase, mainly due to gastro-intestinal disorders and cytopenias. Dose reductions were 
reported in 18.9% vs. 6.3% of patients, mainly due to cytopenias and ECG QT prolonged. Apart from 
neutropenia (6% vs. 1.1%), no events occurred at a >5 pp higher incidence in the quizartinib arm 
compared with the placebo arm.  
The safety profile of quizartinib in the 30-60 mg All AML Pool was generally comparable to the 
quizartinib arm of the pivotal trial. 
For a total of 102 patients who underwent HSCT, the incidence of acute and chronic GvHD was higher 
in the quizartinib arm than for placebo (45.1% vs. 38.5% and 29.4% vs. 19.8%, respectively) and the 
grading of acute GvHD seemed slightly worse. Frequencies of the most common AEs seem to increase 
with restart of quizartinib after HSCT, but these adverse reactions are already included in the SmPC 
section 4.8 with frequency ‘very common’. There are 3 patients in the 30-60 mg All AML Pool (of whom 
1 was included in the pivotal trial vs. 0 in the placebo arm) who died due to GvHD. A higher proportion 
of patients with successful engraftment in the quizartinib group (83.3% vs. 78% in the placebo group) 
might partially explain some of the observed differences between the two treatment groups. Although 
contribution of quizartinib to GvHD cannot be fully ruled out, it is noted that the incidence of GvHD 
with quizartinib is consistent when indirectly compared with reported rates of GvHD after alloSCT for 
haematological malignancies in literature. As such, no further risk minimisation is warranted.  
The quizartinib safety profile was worse in elderly. A similar pattern was observed in the placebo 
group, except for the increased risk for early non-relapse mortality. Moreover, the proportion of 
patients aged 65 or older that discontinued treatment due to TEAEs is almost a third (29% vs. 12% 
with placebo). As discussed above, a warning regarding fatal infections in elderly is included in SmPC 
section 4.4. 
The safety profile seems slightly worse in females compared to males. Grade 4 TEAEs (mainly driven 
by infections and cytopenic evens) and TESAEs (mainly driven by infections), and QT prolongation 
were more frequently reported in females. The differences in PTs between males and females were 
small and infection and myelosuppression are known safety concerns for patients receiving intensive 
chemotherapy-based regimens. No additional risk minimisation is considered warranted.  
In the 30 to 60 mg group of the All AML Pool, TEAEs associated with death as an outcome were 
reported more frequently in White patients (18.3%) compared to Asian subjects (7.1%). Similar 
findings were observed according to region, with 17.5% of the North American and 17.9% of patients 
in the European subgroups vs. 8.3% of patients in the Asian/Other  subgroup experiencing TEAEs 
associated with death as outcome. Further data provided during the assessment clarified that there 
was no trend in patient risk factors across the races/regions that could explain the difference in 
frequency of fatal TEAEs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 114/130 
 
 
 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs, TESAEs, and TEAEs associated with study drug interruption were reported more 
frequently (>5 pp higher incidence) in subjects who used strong CYP3A4 inhibitors than those who did 
not. Clarifications have been provided indicating that this may be explained by the clinical need for those 
patients to receive azole antifungals for the treatment of an active infection. Overall, it is agreed that 
there is no consistent trend in the incidence of the different categories of TEAEs when comparing 
patients who concomitantly used a strong CYP3A inhibitor with those who did not. Relevant risk 
minimisation measure are though described in the SmPC in section 4.2 (dose adjustment) and section 4.5 
(description of drug-drug interaction). 
Toxicology studies revealed that quizartinib has a significant intrinsic haematotoxicity in terms of 
neutropenia and lymphocytopenia, hepato- and renal toxicity. Due to the overlap of disease symptoms 
and safety risks from concomitant therapies, identification of these toxicity in the human target 
population remained difficult.  
Main AEs of special interest 
QT prolongation 
Quizartinib prolongs QT interval on ECG in a dose-dependent and exposure-dependent manner. 
Although most observed cases of QT prolongation were non-serious and resolved without any action 
taken with study drug, cardiac deaths were observed for which a causal relation with quizartinib 
treatment could not be completely ruled out. In order to identify patients at risk for developing 
significant sequelae early and manage them properly, measures regarding ECG monitoring and 
management of QT prolongation have been proposed with dose adjustments, comedication, treatment 
of electrolyte abnormalities, a contraindication for patients with congenital QT prolongation and a 
recommendation not to start treatment with a QTcF interval >450 ms. The apparent increase in 
incidence of QTcF prolongation with longer treatment duration might be due to accrual of events and 
lower absolute number of patients with longer follow-up as well. This is also supported by the analysis 
of time to onset of QTcF prolongation, as events tended to occur early. The QT prolongations observed 
with quizartinib were mostly asymptomatic ECG findings, with low incidence of ventricular arrythmia 
events. There were no Grade 3 or higher TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged the Continuation Phase and no 
patients discontinued quizartinib due to TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged. A weekly ECG is recommended in 
the SmPC for the period of dose initiation/escalation. This safety aspects are also part of the additional 
risk minimisation measure in the form of Physician educational material and Patient card with the aim 
to reinforce the prescriber’s and patient/caregiver’s awareness about the risk of serious ADRs related 
to QTc interval prolongation 
Other cardiac TEAEs 
Similar proportions of patients in the quizartinib and placebo arm had TEAEs related to cardiac failure 
and ischaemic heart disease. 
Hepatic function abnormalities 
A higher proportion of quizartinib treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients experienced 
hepatic TEAEs in the pivotal trial (34.3% vs. 27.2%), mostly being elevated aminotransferases. This is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. No serious cases of hepatic failure or toxic hepatitis considered 
related to study drug were reported for the pivotal trial. 
Infections 
Infections TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation and TEAEs associated with death were 
generally reported in a slightly higher proportion of subjects in the quizartinib group than in the 
placebo group (7.2% vs. 4.1% and 7.5% vs. 4.5%, respectively). The majority of the infectious 
events, including the serious and fatal infections, occurred in subjects presenting with Grade 3 or 4 
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 115/130 
 
 
 
 
neutropenia and/or lymphopenia at the time of the event. Myelosuppression and infections are 
appropriately described in the SmPC and RMP. 
Haemorrhages, including serious intracranial/cerebral haemorrhages have been reported in patients 
treated with quizartinib. Epistaxis and thrombocytopenia have been included as adverse drug 
reactions.  
There is no indication for other risks or new safety concerns based on the presented post-marketing 
data from approximately 228 patients treated with quizartinib in Japan. 
Differentiation syndrome 
Differentiation syndrome was not observed in the pivotal trial and with very low frequency in the all 
AML pool. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of quizartinib is not negligible. Treatment with quizartinib leads to higher incidences 
of treatment-related AEs, SAEs and discontinuations/dose adjustments of study drug due to AEs 
compared to placebo, in the complex treatment schedule as studied, i.e. consisting of an induction, 
consolidation and maintenance phase. Almost all patients treated with quizartinib experienced at least 
one Grade ≥3 TEAE. In particular neutropenia, and QT prolongation were reported as related events 
occurring more frequently with quizartinib. However, most TEAEs were manageable by dose 
adjustment or standard supportive therapies. Still, there is an observed imbalance in fatal TEAEs 
(primarily infections), in early treatment phases. Older age and worse ECOG PS were identified as 
factors potentially associated with the observed early deaths. The proposed risk minimisations in SmPC 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 regarding fatal infections in elderly are acceptable. All in all considering the risk 
minimisations put in place and manageability of most of the TEAEs, the safety profile of quizartinib, 
even though not negligible, can be considered acceptable in the clinical setting specified in the 
indication.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP and the PRAC consider that the risk management plan version 1.0 dated 08 September 
2023 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18 June 2019. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vanflyta (quizartinib) is included in the

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Vanflyta (quizartinib) is indicated in combination with standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction 
and standard cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy, followed by Vanflyta (quizartinib) single-agent 
maintenance therapy for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) that is 
FLT3-ITD positive. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Based on eligibility criteria and patient preference, newly diagnosed AML patients receive either 
standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy or non-intensive treatment.  However, patients 
with FLT3-ITD (+) AML have a higher risk of relapse compared with patients without FLT3-ITD 
mutations (Ciolli, 2004; Fröhling, 2002; Kottaridis, 2001). Current guidelines recommend molecular 
testing for FLT3 mutations at diagnosis and, when applicable, early incorporation of FLT3 inhibitors into 
the therapeutic regimen. The current approach is to combine them with standard chemotherapy in an 
attempt to increase the cytotoxic effect against leukaemia cells and reverse the poor prognosis for 
these patients. To date, only midostaurin, a multikinase inhibitor, has received approval for the 
treatment of FLT3 mutant newly diagnosed AML in combination with standard chemotherapy based on 
data from the RATIFY study, which included only subjects younger than 60 years of age with newly 
diagnosed FLT3-mutation positive AML with either ITD or TKD mutations. However, given the poor 
prognosis of patients with FLT3-ITD (+) AML, the higher risk of relapse, and the unmet medical need, 
new treatment options are needed. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical evidence is derived from the pivotal Phase 3 study, AC220-A-U302, which was 
conducted in the target population of subjects with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD (+) AML. No other study 
contributed to the efficacy data in the proposed indication. 
Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive quizartinib 40 mg or matching placebo (QD for 14 days) in 
each cycle in combination with standard chemotherapy (induction followed by consolidation for 
responding patients). During the Continuation Phase subjects received quizartinib/placebo at a starting 
dose of 30 mg QD increasing to 60 mg QD for subjects if QTcF was ≤450 ms for up to 36 cycles 
(28 days/cycle). Patients who proceeded to HSCT stopped receiving study treatment 7 days before the 
start of a conditioning regimen. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The pivotal study AC220-A-U302 met its primary endpoint of OS with a HR of 0.776 (95% CI: 0.615- 
0.979) and a 2-sided p value: 0.03. The median OS values (quizartinib 31.9 months and placebo 15.1 
months) show a plateau around the median. The 3-year landmark analysis shows 49.9% (95%CI: 
43.7-55.9) of the patients in the quizartinib arm versus 41.1% (95%CI: 35.0-47.0) of the patients in 
the placebo arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/443555/2023  
Page 121/130 
 
 
 
The RMST survival cut-off time to address the plateau phase in the OS curve using cutoff time points of 
36, 42, and 48 months showed a difference between the quizartinib and placebo groups in line with the 
primary OS analysis results. RMST (95% CI) survival time for subjects who received quizartinib was 
prolonged by 2.75 months (0.35, 5.15) at 36 months, 3.26 months (0.39, 6.13) at 42 months, 3.81 
months (0.46, 7.16) at 48 months, and 4.53 months (0.55, 8.51) at 55.8 months. 
For the secondary endpoints, the applicant has defined EFS in 3 different ways, i.e. according to FDA’ 
definition (induction treatment failure (ITF) defined as not achieving CR by the end of induction using a 
42 day window), FDA’s definition without the 42 day restriction and the initial protocol definition (ITF 
defined as not achieving CRc by end of induction). The key secondary endpoint (per FDA definition 
within 42 days) was not statistically significant (preventing statistical analysis for the other secondary 
endpoints), the other definitions of EFS did show a numerical difference between the 2 treatment 
arms, in favour of quizartinib, i.e. FDA’s definition without the 42 day restriction (median EFS 5.0 vs 
3.4 months, HR: 0.828, 95%CI 0.669-0.999) and EFS per protocol definition which is consistent with 
the recommendations from current AML guidelines (Cheson, 2003; Heuser, 2020) (median EFS 11.9 
months vs 5.7 months, HR: 0.729, 95%CI 0.592-0.897). 
Even though it was specified as an exploratory objective a difference in duration of response was 
observed between quizartinib and placebo treated patients.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
- The application concerns a single pivotal trial with no additional support from exploratory studies.  
- The key secondary endpoint EFS per FDA definition was not statistically significant different between 
the quizartinib and placebo arms (HR [95% CI] = 0.916 [0.754, 1.114], p = 0.2371 by stratified log-
rank test). Interpretation is hampered by low median EFS values.  
- The difference in overall survival of quizartinib compared to placebo is not supported by other 
secondary endpoints; rates of CR, CR with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity, and CRc with FLT3-ITD MRD 
negativity were similar between treatment arms.  
- The HR for the subgroup for low white blood cell counts at diagnosis (WBC <40x10^9/L) was higher 
than for the subgroup with WBC ≥40x10^9/L (i.e. HR 0.961 compared to HR 0.621, respectively). 
There were no continuous WBC data available at initial diagnosis to investigate clinical outcomes by 
several WBC cut-off points, hampering determination of a WBC level at which treatment is less 
effective. Moreover, lower efficacy is likely not dependent on low WBC alone but influenced by multiple 
factors. As such, no restriction of the indication is proposed. 
- OS efficacy results in subgroups of VAF demonstrated an obvious difference in the Hazard Ratios 
which is lower the higher the FLT3-ITD %VAF is and the results for both the lower VAF groups are not 
significant. The HR for NPM1-wt is above 1 for Overall Survival. Also the newly submitted analysis for 
response rates and EFS demonstrate a relation to NPM1wt/mut status, while not significant, differ for 
quizartinib treatment or placebo. Further subgroup analysis for FLT3-ITD %VAF subgroups plus NPM1-
status need to confirm the benefit for all subgroups. These analyses will be submitted in a biomarker 
report, in the post-authorisation phase.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all patients in Study AC220-A-U302 in both treatment groups experienced a TEAE ( about 99%) 
or Grade ≥3 TEAE (>89%). Most TEAE categories were reported with at least a numerical higher 
frequency in the quizartinib arm compared to the placebo arm.  
The most frequently (>30%) reported TEAEs in the quizartinib arm were febrile neutropenia (44.2%), 
pyrexia (42.3%), diarrhoea (37%), hypokalaemia (35.1%), and nausea (34%), all of which occurred at 
similar frequencies to the placebo arm. Largest differences with quizartinib treatment compared to 
placebo were observed for the TEAEs of neutropenia (20.4% vs. 10.1%), ECG QT prolonged (13.6% 
vs. 4.1%), headache (27.5% vs. 19.8%), neutrophil count decreased (10.2% vs. 4.5%) and ALT 
increased (15.8% vs. 10.1%).  
Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported in ~80% in both treatment arms. The most frequently reported Grade 
3/4 TEAEs (≥10% incidence) in the quizartinib arm included cytopenias (febrile neutropenia [43.4% 
vs. 41%] and neutropenia [18.1% vs. 8.6%]), hypokalaemia [18.4% vs. 16.4%], and infections 
(pneumoniae [11.3% vs. 11.2%]), of which the event of neutropenia occurred at a ≥5 pp higher 
incidence in the quizartinib arm than in the placebo arm.  
Treatment related TEAEs were reported in 60.4% vs. 36.2%. The most common related TEAEs 
reported with >5% difference compared to the placebo arm were: neutropenia (17.4% vs. 3.7%), ECG 
QT prolongation (11.7% vs. 3%) and neutrophil count decreased (7.9% vs. 1.9%). Related Grade 3/4 
TEAEs were reported in 43% vs. 22.8%, of which cytopenias were most frequently reported and 
neutropenia the only event with a frequency ≥5 pp higher with quizartinib than with placebo (15.5% 
vs. 3.7%). 
TESAEs were reported in 54% of quizartinib treated patients vs. 45.9% in the placebo group. In both 
treatment arms, the most frequently reported types were infections (pneumoniae [6.4% vs. 5.6%], 
septic shock [4.2% vs. 3%] and sepsis [3.8% vs. 5.2%]) and blood disorders (febrile neutropenia 
[10.9% vs. 8.2%]).  
Related TESAEs were reported in 15.5% vs. 10.8%. The most frequently reported (≥1% incidence) 
related TESAEs were febrile neutropenia (2.6% with quizartinib vs. 1.5% with placebo), pneumoniae 
(1.5% vs. 0.7%), neutropenia (1.1% vs. 0%), and myelosuppression (1.1% vs. 0%). 
TEAEs associated with death within 30 days after last dose of study drug were reported with larger 
incidence in the quizartinib arm (n=30, 11.3%) compared to the placebo arm (n=23, 8.6%). In 
particular, more early deaths (ie, deaths within 60 days of initiation of study drug) occurred with 
quizartinib compared with placebo (7.5% vs. 4.9%). Main causes of death were infections (mostly 
sepsis/septic shock) in the early induction and consolidation treatment phases.  
When analysing AEs by treatment phase, frequencies of almost all TEAE categories increased in the 
continuation phase compared to the earlier treatment phases, except for TEAEs with death as 
outcome. Most pronounced increases with quizartinib were observed for related TEAEs and (related) 
TEAEs associated with treatment interruption or reduction (mainly caused by cytopenias and ECG QT 
prolonged).  
TEAEs associated with study drug discontinuation were more frequently reported for quizartinib (20.4% 
vs. 8.6%). The most common TEAEs resulting in discontinuation were infections (7.2% vs. 4.1%) and 
cytopenias (3.0% vs. 0). Dose reductions were reported in 18.9% vs. 6.3% of patients, mainly due to 
cytopenias and ECG QT prolonged. Apart from neutropenia (6% vs. 1.1%), no events occurred at a >5 
pp higher incidence in the quizartinib arm compared with the placebo arm.

For a total of 102 patients who underwent HSCT, the percentage of patients with acute and chronic 
GvHD appeared higher in the quizartinib arm than in the placebo arm (45.1% vs. 38.5% and 29.4% 
vs. 19.8%, respectively). The quizartinib safety profile was worse in elderly. This was also observed in 
the placebo arm, except for the increase in early non-relapse mortality. The proportion of patients 
aged 65 or older that discontinued treatment due to TEAEs is almost a third and higher than with 
placebo (29% vs. 12%). The safety profile seems slightly worse in females compared to males, as 
Grade 4 TEAEs and TESAEs, and QT prolongation were more frequently reported. TEAEs associated 
with death as an outcome were reported more frequently in White subjects compared to Asian subjects 
or subjects of other races, and in the North American and European subgroups than in the Asian 
subgroup. 
Main AEs of special interest 
QT prolongation- 18.5% of patients in the quizartinib arm and 11.2% in the placebo arm experienced 
Torsade de points (TdP)/ECG QT Prolongation related events. The incidence increased dose dependent 
in the All AML pool. Two (0.8%) patients treated with quizartinib experienced cardiac arrest with 
recorded ventricular fibrillation, one with a fatal outcome, both in the Induction phase in the setting of 
severe hypokalaemia.  
Hepatic function abnormalities- A higher proportion of quizartinib treated patients compared to placebo 
treated patients experienced hepatic TEAEs in the pivotal trial (34.3% vs. 27.2%), mostly being 
elevated aminotransferases. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
-  A higher incidence of TEAEs associated with death was reported with quizartinib compared to 
placebo (n=30 [11.3%] vs. n=23 [8.6%]), mainly caused by infections (mostly sepsis/septic 
shock). Most deaths occurred in the early induction and consolidation treatment phases (7.5% 
vs. 4.9% with placebo within first 60 days of initiation of study drug). Older age and worse 
ECOG PS were identified as factors potentially associated with the observed early deaths in 
both the quizartinib and placebo arm. The proposed risk minimisations against fatal infections 
in elderly included in SmPC section 4.4 with additional clarification in SmPC section 4.8 are 
acceptable. 
- 
It is uncertain whether the reported safety profile from the clinical development can be 
extrapolated to clinical practice. The study population was relatively healthy with a median age 
of 56.0 years, mostly ECOG PS=0 or 1 (>80%), adequate renal and hepatic function and lack 
of significant comorbidities like uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The pivotal study in newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD positive AML patients met its primary endpoint. The 
addition of quizartinib to standard of care induction, consolidation chemotherapy followed by a 
continuation phase resulted in a statistically significant difference for median OS between quizartinib 
and placebo. Comparison of the median OS values is not informative since the Kaplan-Meier curves 
plateau around the median and estimates of the median do not describe the true treatment effect. The 
quizartinib arm had a higher plateau, with 49.9% (95%CI: 43.7-55.9) of the patients surviving at the 
3-year time point, versus 41.1% (95%CI: 35.0-47.0) of the patients in the placebo arm.  
The secondary endpoint (EFS per the FDA AML guidance) did not demonstrate a statistically significant 
difference between the quizartinib and placebo arm thus formal hierarchical testing was not continued 
for the secondary endpoints.  
Numerically there was no difference in rates of CR, CR with FLT3-ITD MRD negativity, and CRc with 
FLT3-ITD MRD negativity at the end of induction were similar between treatment arms. Higher rates of 
CRi in the quizartinib arm compared with the placebo arm were observed, however CRi is a less 
stringent definition of CR as incomplete hematologic recovery is not achieved, thus the clinical

relevance of this finding is uncertain because of non-relapse mortality due to infections. An increased 
RFS and duration of CR (exploratory endpoints) was observed with quizartinib. 
While the single pivotal trial of this study was positive based on its primary endpoint, the statistical 
strength of evidence was initially considered weak (p = 0.03) and not supported by a convincing 
impact pharmacodynamic endpoints such as CR or MRD that would demonstrate the antitumoral 
activity of quizartinib. Based on these concerns, the SAG-O was consulted. Following the rationale of 
the SAG-O, the OS benefit is considered to be established with reasonable certainty since other 
exploratory data support the OS effect. Lack of an effect on FLT3-ITD MRD negativity is not considered 
to weaken the conclusions as the surrogacy of MRD in this population is far from being established and 
the FLT3-ITD assay may not detect all mutations. Furthermore, although EFS rate based on failure to 
achieve CR at 42 days after last chemotherapy did not show convincing activity for quizartinib, the 
more relevant timepoint would be 56 days, which showed a more consistent effect in exploratory 
analyses. Furthermore, a longer duration of response was observed for quizartinib vs. placebo in 
exploratory analyses, indicating higher activity in the experimental arm. Overall, the effect on OS is 
therefore considered convincing and sufficiently supported by exploratory data. 
There is a suggestion of early OS detriment, as more early deaths (i.e, deaths within 30-60 days of 
initiation of study drug) occurred with quizartinib compared to placebo. Main causes of death in the 
early induction and consolidation treatment phases were infections (mostly sepsis/septic shock). Older 
age and worse ECOG PS were identified as factors potentially associated with the observed early 
deaths. The OS subgroup analysis for age also suggests a lower benefit of quizartinib treatment in 
patient older than 60. It is acknowledged that this subgroup analysis was not powered to determine 
the B/R in elderly and age alone does not determine eligibility for intensive therapy. Nevertheless, the 
proposed risk minimisation measures regarding fatal infections in elderly in SmPC section 4.4 with 
additional clarification in SmPC section 4.8 are acceptable, also in light of the relatively young and fit 
studied population lacking significant comorbidities. 
The safety profile of quizartinib is not negligible. Treatment with quizartinib in combination with 
standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy and then continued as monotherapy for up to 36 
cycles leads to higher incidences of treatment-related AEs, SAEs and discontinuations/dose 
adjustments of study drug due to AEs compared to placebo. In particular neutropenia, and QT 
prolongation were reported as related events occurring more frequently with quizartinib. Dose-
dependent QTc interval prolongation has been observed with quizartinib. Although most observed 
cases of QT prolongation were non-serious and resolved without any action taken with study drug, 
cardiac deaths were observed for which a causal relation with quizartinib treatment could not be 
completely ruled out. It seems not excluded that the impact of cardiac risks may be underestimated 
from the currently available trial data. Nevertheless, it is agreed that the risk is appropriately 
communicated in SmPC 4.4 and 4.5. Most TEAEs were manageable by monitoring, study drug 
interruption or dose reduction, and/or standard supportive therapies.  
In the continuation phase, almost all TEAE categories increased compared to the earlier treatment 
phases and only few patients were able to complete the 36 cycle continuation phase. In the 
continuation phase no increased risk for death due to AEs has been observed, and patients seem to be 
able to discontinue treatment when needed.  
Toxicology studies revealed that quizartinib has a significant intrinsic haematotoxicity in terms of 
neutropenia and lymphocytopenia, hepato- and renal toxicity. Due to the similar nature of disease 
symptoms and safety risks from concomitant therapies, characterisation of the safety profile in the 
human target population remains difficult. Current proposed risk minimisations and information in the 
SmPC are considered adequate.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the newly diagnosed AML add-on treatment setting, reliable and robust results are needed in order 
to demonstrate a clinically relevant contribution of quizartinib on top of an active backbone. The 
difference in primary endpoint OS between the quizartinib arm and control arm of the pivotal trial is 
statistically significant in favour of quizartinib. While not supported by pharmacodynamic endpoints 
such as CR or MRD, the effect on OS is considered to be established with reasonable certainty based 
on exploratory data (i.e. DOR and and EFS using the 56 -day definition). 
Although treatment with quizartinib is associated with substantial toxicity, the overall benefit /risk 
balance of quizartinib is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Scientific advice group (SAG) outcome summary 
Overall, the majority of the SAG concluded that the effect on OS was convincing and sufficiently 
supported by exploratory data.  
Lack of an effect on FLT3-ITD MRD negativity was not considered to weaken the conclusions of study 
AC220-A-U302 as the surrogacy of MRD in this population is far from being established and the FLT3-
ITD assay may not detect all mutations.  
Furthermore, EFS rate based on failure to achieve CR at 56 days after last chemotherapy showed a 
more consistent effect in exploratory analyses. Furthermore, a longer duration of response was 
observed for quizartinib v. placebo in exploratory analyses, indicating higher activity in the 
experimental arm.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of Vanflyta (quizartinib) is considered to be positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by Consensus is of the opinion that Vanflyta (quizartinib) is not similar to Dacogen, Rydapt, 
Mylotarg, Vyxeos Liposomal, Xospata, Daurismo, and Tibsovo within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Vanflyta is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Vanflyta is indicated in combination with standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction and standard 
cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy, followed by Vanflyta single-agent maintenance therapy for 
adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) that is FLT3-ITD positive. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

Individuals 60 years of age and older 
A single dose of 0.5 mL should be administered.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Abrysvo in children (from birth to less than 18 years of age) have not yet 
been established. Limited data are available in pregnant adolescents and their infants (see section 5.1). 
Method of administration 
Abrysvo is for intramuscular injection into the deltoid region of the upper arm. 
The vaccine should not be mixed with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 
For instructions on reconstitution and handling of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an 
anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.  
Anxiety-related reactions 
Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related 
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. 
It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from fainting. 
Concurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute febrile illness. However, the 
presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in the deferral of vaccination. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
Abrysvo should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation 
disorder since bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration to these 
individuals. 
Immunocompromised individuals 
The efficacy and safety of the vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Abrysvo may be lower in 
immunosuppressed individuals.

Individuals less than 24 weeks of gestation 
Abrysvo has not been studied in pregnant individuals less than 24 weeks of gestation. Since protection 
of the infant against RSV depends on transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta, Abrysvo 
should be administered between weeks 24 and 36 of gestation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Limitations of vaccine effectiveness 
As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited after vaccination. 
Excipient 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Abrysvo can be administered concomitantly with seasonal influenza vaccine (QIV, surface antigen, 
inactivated, adjuvanted). In a randomised study in adults 65 years of age and older, the criteria for 
non-inferiority of the immune responses in the co-administration versus the separate administration 
group were met. However, numerically lower RSV A and B neutralising titres and numerically lower 
influenza A and B haemagglutination inhibition titres were observed when Abrysvo and inactivated 
adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine were co-administered than when they were administered 
separately. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. 
A minimum interval of two weeks is recommended between administration of Abrysvo and 
administration of a tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). There were no safety 
concerns when Abrysvo was co-administered with Tdap in healthy non-pregnant women. Immune 
responses to RSV A, RSV B, diphtheria and tetanus on co-administration were non-inferior to those 
after separate administration. However, the immune responses to the pertussis components were lower 
on co-administration compared to separate administration and did not meet the criteria for non-
inferiority. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Data on pregnant women (more than 4 000 exposed outcomes) indicate no malformative nor 
feto/neonatal toxicity. 
Results from animal studies with Abrysvo do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
In a phase 3 study (Study 1), maternal adverse events reported within 1 month after vaccination were 
similar in the Abrysvo group (14%) and the placebo group (13%). 
No safety signals were detected in infants up to 24 months of age. The incidences of adverse events 
reported within 1 month after birth in infants were similar in the Abrysvo group (37%) and the placebo 
group (35%). Major birth outcomes assessed in the Abrysvo group compared to placebo included 
premature birth (201 (6%) and 169 (5%), respectively), low birth weight (181 (5%) and 155 (4%), 
respectively) and congenital anomalies (174 (5%) and 203 (6%), respectively). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether Abrysvo is excreted in human milk. No adverse effects of Abrysvo have been 
shown in breastfed newborns of vaccinated mothers.

Fertility 
No human data on the effect of Abrysvo on fertility are available. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Abrysvo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Pregnant individuals 
In pregnant women at 24-36 weeks of gestation the most frequently reported adverse reactions were 
vaccination site pain (41%), headache (31%) and myalgia (27%). The majority of local and systemic 
reactions in maternal participants were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within 2-3 days of 
onset. 
Individuals 60 years of age and older 
In individuals 60 years of age and older the most frequently reported adverse reaction was vaccination 
site pain (11%). The majority of reactions were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within 1-2 
days of onset. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of administering a single dose of Abrysvo to pregnant women at 24-36 weeks of gestation 
(n=3 682) and to individuals 60 years of age and older (n=18 575) was evaluated in phase 3 clinical 
trials. 
Adverse reactions are listed according to the following frequency categories: 
Very common (≥1/10); 
Common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
Uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100);

Fisher syndrome were reported with onset of 7 and 8 days, respectively, after receiving Abrysvo and assessed 
by the investigator as possibly related to the administered vaccine. Both cases had either confounding factors or 
an alternative aetiology. One additional case, with onset 8 months after receiving Abrysvo, was assessed as not 
related to the administered vaccine by the investigator. One case of Guillain-Barré syndrome was reported in the 
placebo group 14 months after administration.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose with Abrysvo is unlikely due to its single dose presentation. 
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with Abrysvo. In the event of an overdose, the 
individual should be monitored and provided with symptomatic treatment as appropriate. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, other viral vaccines; ATC code: J07BX05 
Mechanism of action 
Abrysvo contains two recombinant stabilised RSV prefusion F antigens representing subgroups 
RSV-A and RSV-B. Prefusion F is the primary target of neutralising antibodies that block RSV 
infection. Following intramuscular administration, the prefusion F antigens elicit an immune response, 
which protects against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease. 
In infants born to mothers who were vaccinated with Abrysvo between weeks 24 and 36 of gestation, 
protection against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease is due to transplacental transfer of 
RSV neutralising antibodies. Adults 60 years of age and older are protected by active immunisation.

Clinical efficacy 
Infants from birth through 6 months of age by active immunisation of pregnant individuals 
Study 1 is a phase 3, multicentre, randomised (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess 
the efficacy of a single dose of Abrysvo in the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract 
disease in infants born to pregnant individuals vaccinated between weeks 24 and 36 of gestation. The 
need for revaccination with subsequent pregnancies has not been established. 
RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness was defined as a medically attended visit with a reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed RSV illness with one or more of the 
following respiratory symptoms: fast breathing, low oxygen saturation (SpO2 <95%) and chest wall 
indrawing. RSV-associated severe lower respiratory tract illness was defined as an illness that met the 
lower respiratory tract illness-RSV criteria plus at least one of the following: very fast breathing, low 
oxygen saturation (SpO2 <93%), high-flow oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula or mechanical 
ventilation, ICU admission for >4 hours and/or failure to respond/unconscious. 
In this study, 3 695 pregnant individuals with uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies were randomised 
to the Abrysvo group and 3 697 to placebo.  
Vaccine efficacy (VE) was defined as the relative risk reduction of the endpoint in the Abrysvo group 
compared to the placebo group for infants born to pregnant individuals who received the assigned 
intervention. There were two primary efficacy endpoints, assessed in parallel, severe RSV-positive 
medically attended lower respiratory tract illness and RSV-positive medically attended lower 
respiratory tract illness, occurring within 90, 120, 150 or 180 days after birth.  
Of the pregnant women who received Abrysvo, 65% were White, 20% were Black or African 
American and 29% were Hispanic/Latino. The median age was 29 years (range 16-45 years); 0.2% of 
participants were under 18 years of age and 4.3% were under 20 years of age. The median gestational 
age at vaccination was 31 weeks and 2 days (range 24 weeks and 0 days to 36 weeks and 4 days). The 
median infant gestational age at birth was 39 weeks and 1 day (range 27 weeks and 3 days to 43 weeks 
and 6 days).  
Vaccine efficacy is presented in Tables 2 and 3.

A post-hoc analysis of VE by maternal gestational age was conducted. For severe medically attended 
lower respiratory tract illness occurring within 180 days, VE was 57.2% (95% CI 10.4, 80.9) for 
women vaccinated early in pregnancy (24 to <30 weeks) and 78.1% (95% CI 52.1, 91.2) for women 
vaccinated later in the pregnancy eligible window (30 to 36 weeks). For medically attended lower 
respiratory tract illness occurring within 180 days, VE was 30.9% (95% CI -14.4, 58.9) for women 
vaccinated early in pregnancy (24 to <30 weeks) and 62.4% (95% CI 41.6, 76.4) for women 
vaccinated later in the pregnancy eligible window (30 to 36 weeks). 
Active immunisation of individuals 60 years of age and older 
Study 2 is a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the 
efficacy of Abrysvo in the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in individuals 
60 years of age and older. 
RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness was defined as RT-PCR confirmed RSV illness with 
two or more or three or more of the following respiratory symptoms within 7 days of symptom onset 
and lasting more than 1 day during the same illness: new or increased cough, wheezing, sputum 
production, shortness of breath or tachypnoea (≥25 breaths/min or 15% increase from resting 
baseline).  
Participants were randomised (1:1) to receive Abrysvo (n=18 488) or placebo (n=18 479). Enrollment 
was stratified by age 60-69 years (63%), 70-79 years (32%) and ≥80 years (5%). Subjects with stable 
chronic underlying conditions were eligible for this study and 52% of participants had at least 1 
prespecified condition; 16% of participants were enrolled with stable chronic cardiopulmonary 
conditions such as asthma (9%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7%) or congestive heart 
failure (2%). Immunocompromised individuals were ineligible. 
The primary objective was assessment of vaccine efficacy (VE), defined as the relative risk reduction 
of first episode of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in the Abrysvo group compared to the 
placebo group in the first RSV season.  
Of the participants who received Abrysvo, 51% were male and 80% were White, 12% were Black or 
African American and 41% were Hispanic/Latino. The median age of participants was 67 years (range 
59-95 years).  
At the end of the first RSV season the analysis demonstrated statistically significant efficacy for 
Abrysvo for reduction of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with ≥2 symptoms and with 
≥3 symptoms.  
Vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 4.

pre-filled syringe of solvent to the vial containing the powder using the vial adaptor. 
The vaccine must be reconstituted only with the solvent provided. 
Preparation for administration 
Pre-filled syringe containing solvent for Abrysvo 
Vial containing antigens 
for Abrysvo (powder) 
Vial adaptor 
Syringe cap  Luer lock adaptor 
Vial stopper (with flip off cap removed) 
Step 1. Prepare vial adaptor 
•  Remove plastic flip off cap from vial and wipe the rubber stopper. 
•  Open the packaging containing the vial adaptor by peeling the top cover off. 
•  Do not remove the vial adaptor from its package. 
Step 2. Attach the vial adaptor to the vial containing antigens for Abrysvo 
•  Hold the base of the vial on a flat surface. 
•  Keep the vial adaptor in the packaging and orient it vertically over the centre of the 
vial so that the adaptor spike aligns with the centre of the vial’s rubber stopper.  
•  Connect the vial adaptor to the vial with a straight downward push. The vial 
adaptor will lock into place. 
•  Do not push vial adaptor in at an angle as this may result in leaking during use. 
•  Remove the vial adaptor packaging. 
Step 3. Remove syringe cap 
•  For all syringe assembly steps, hold the syringe only by the Luer lock adaptor 
located at the tip of the syringe. This will prevent the Luer lock adaptor from 
detaching during use. 
•  Remove the syringe cap by slowly turning the cap anti-clockwise while holding the 
Luer lock adaptor. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4. Connect syringe to the vial adaptor 
•  Hold the syringe’s Luer lock adaptor and connect it to the vial adaptor by turning 
clockwise. 
•  Stop turning when you feel resistance, overtightening the syringe may result in 
leaking during use. 
•  Once the syringe is securely attached to the vial adaptor, there will be a small space 
between the top of the vial adaptor and the Luer lock adaptor of the syringe. 
Step 5. Inject solvent and gently swirl 
•  Inject the entire contents of the syringe containing the solvent into the vial. 
•  Do not remove the empty syringe. 
•  While holding the plunger rod down, gently swirl the vial in a circular motion until 
the powder is completely dissolved (approximately 1-2 minutes). 
•  Do not shake. 
Step 6. Withdraw the contents 
•  Invert the vial completely with the vial adaptor and syringe still attached. 
•  Slowly withdraw the entire contents into the syringe. 
•  Drawing up all obtainable content ensures a complete 0.5 mL dose for 
administration. 
•  Do not pull the plunger rod out. 
Step 7. Disconnect syringe 
•  Hold the Luer lock adaptor of the syringe and disconnect the syringe from the vial 
adaptor by turning anti-clockwise. 
Step 8. Attach needle 
•  Attach a sterile needle suitable for intramuscular injection to the pre-filled syringe 
by turning clockwise. 
•  Do not overtighten the needle as this may result in leaking during use. 
Step 9. Visual inspection 
•  The prepared vaccine is a clear and colourless solution. 
•  Visually inspect the vaccine for large particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration. Do not use if large particulate matter or discolouration is found. 
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local

Abrysvo powder and solvent for solution for injection 
Respiratory syncytial virus vaccine (bivalent, recombinant) 
This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 
for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important 
information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
- 
- 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible 
side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

2.  What you need to know before you receive Abrysvo 
3.  How Abrysvo is given 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store Abrysvo 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Abrysvo is and what it is used for 
Abrysvo is a vaccine to prevent lung (respiratory tract) disease caused by a virus called respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV). Abrysvo is given to: 
• 
or 
• 
pregnant individuals to protect their infants from birth through 6 months of age 
individuals 60 years of age and older. 
RSV is a common virus which, in most cases, causes mild, cold-like symptoms such as a sore throat, 
cough or a blocked nose. However, in young infants RSV can cause serious lung problems. In older 
adults and people with chronic medical conditions, RSV can worsen illnesses such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). RSV can lead to 
hospitalisation in severe cases and in some cases it can be fatal. 
How Abrysvo works 
This vaccine helps the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to make antibodies (substances in 
the blood that help the body fight infections) which protect against lung disease caused by RSV. In 
pregnant individuals who are vaccinated between weeks 24 and 36 of pregnancy, these antibodies are 
passed to the infant through the placenta before birth which protects infants when they are at most risk 
from RSV.  
2.  What you need to know before you receive Abrysvo  
Abrysvo should not be given 
• 
if you are allergic to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed 
in section 6). 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this vaccine 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after you received any 
other vaccine injection or after you were given Abrysvo in the past. 
if you are feeling nervous about getting the vaccine or have ever fainted after any injection. 
Fainting can happen before or after any injection 
if you have an infection with a high fever. If this is the case, then vaccination will be 
postponed. There is no need to delay vaccination for a minor infection, such as a cold, but talk 
to your doctor first. 
if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
if you have a weakened immune system which may prevent you from getting the full benefit 
from Abrysvo. 
if you are less than 24 weeks pregnant. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
you are given Abrysvo. 
As with any vaccine, Abrysvo may not fully protect all those who receive it. 
Children and adolescents 
Abrysvo is not recommended in children and young people below 18 years of age except during 
pregnancy (see ‘Pregnancy’ section below). 
Other medicines and Abrysvo 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines 
or have recently received any other vaccine.  
Abrysvo may be given at the same time as a flu vaccine. A gap of at least two weeks is recommended 
between administration of Abrysvo and administration of a vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria and 
acellular pertussis (whooping cough).  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnant individuals can be given this vaccine in the late second or third trimester (weeks 24 to 36). 
Talk to your doctor or nurse for advice before getting this vaccine if you are breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
Abrysvo is unlikely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Abrysvo contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How Abrysvo is given 
You will be given one injection of 0.5 mL into a muscle of your upper arm. 
If you have any questions on the use of Abrysvo, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Abrysvo is for intramuscular use only.  
The powder must be reconstituted only with the solvent provided in the pre-filled syringe using the 
vial adaptor. 
The unopened vial is stable for 5 days when stored at temperatures from 8°C to 30°C. At the end of 
this period Abrysvo should be used or discarded. This information is used to guide healthcare 
professionals in case of temporary temperature excursions only. 
Storage of reconstituted vaccine 
Abrysvo should be used immediately after reconstitution or within 4 hours. Store the reconstituted 
vaccine between 15ºC and 30ºC. Do not freeze reconstituted vaccine. 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours between 15°C and 30°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used

Preparation for administration 
Pre-filled syringe containing solvent for Abrysvo 
Vial containing antigens 
for Abrysvo (powder) 
Vial adaptor 
Syringe cap  Luer lock adaptor 
Vial stopper (with flip-off cap removed) 
Step 1. Prepare vial adaptor 
•  Remove plastic flip off cap from vial and wipe the rubber stopper. 
•  Open the packaging containing the vial adaptor by peeling the top cover off. 
•  Do not remove the vial adaptor from its package. 
Step 2. Attach the vial adaptor to the vial containing antigens for Abrysvo 
•  Hold the base of the vial on a flat surface. 
•  Keep the vial adaptor in the packaging and orient it vertically over the centre of the 
vial so that the adaptor spike aligns with the centre of the vial’s rubber stopper.  
•  Connect the vial adaptor to the vial with a straight downward push. The vial 
adaptor will lock into place. 
•  Do not push vial adaptor in at an angle as this may result in leaking during use. 
•  Remove the vial adaptor packaging. 
Step 3. Remove syringe cap 
•  For all syringe assembly steps, hold the syringe only by the Luer lock adaptor 
located at the tip of the syringe. This will prevent the Luer lock adaptor from 
detaching during use. 
•  Remove the syringe cap by slowly turning the cap anti-clockwise while holding the 
Luer lock adaptor. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4. Connect syringe to the vial adaptor 
•  Hold the syringe’s Luer lock adaptor and connect it to the vial adaptor by turning 
clockwise. 
•  Stop turning when you feel resistance, overtightening the syringe may result in 
leaking during use. 
•  Once the syringe is securely attached to the vial adaptor, there will be a small space 
between the top of the vial adaptor and the Luer lock adaptor of the syringe. 
Step 5. Inject solvent and gently swirl 
•  Inject the entire contents of the syringe containing the solvent into the vial. 
•  Do not remove the empty syringe. 
•  While holding the plunger rod down, gently swirl the vial in a circular motion until 
the powder is completely dissolved (approximately 1-2 minutes). 
•  Do not shake. 
Step 6. Withdraw the contents 
•  Invert the vial completely with the vial adaptor and syringe still attached. 
•  Slowly withdraw the entire contents into the syringe. 
•  Drawing up all obtainable content ensures a complete 0.5 mL dose for 
administration. 
•  Do not pull the plunger rod out. 
Step 7. Disconnect syringe 
•  Hold the Luer lock adaptor of the syringe and disconnect the syringe from the vial 
adaptor by turning anti-clockwise. 
Step 8. Attach needle 
•  Attach a sterile needle suitable for intramuscular injection to the pre-filled syringe 
by turning clockwise. 
•  Do not overtighten the needle as this may result in leaking during use. 
Step 9. Visual inspection 
•  The prepared vaccine is a clear and colourless solution. 
•  Visually inspect the vaccine for large particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration. Do not use if large particulate matter or discolouration is found. 
Disposal 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

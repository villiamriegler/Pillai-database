Post-Authorization Safety Study to Assess Healthcare 
Provider Awareness of Risks Associated with Zydelig in 
the European Union; this is a category 3 PASS study to 
assess the effectiveness of additional risk 
minimization measures by determining the level of 
knowledge of haematologists and oncologists (who 
manage patients with CLL or FL) about the infection 
risks associated with Zydelig treatment and the 
corresponding recommendation to minimize these 
previously reported for both Follicular Lymphoma (FL) 
patients and the whole study population, with a point 
estimate approximately 1% higher. The Complete Responses 
(CRs) in the FL subset doubled, from 8.3 to 16.7%, and the 
median Duration of Response (DOR) was 12.5 months in all 
patients and 11.8 in FL patients. The Kaplan-Meier estimate 
of median Overall Survival (OS), including long-term 
follow-up, was 48.6 months in the overall population, while 
in FL patients it was 61.2 months. Moreover, the safety 
findings were consistent with the known safety profile of 
idelalisib.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Zydelig 
PL 
in the approved indication remains favourable, but 
recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance grounds: 
There are still three ongoing studies which are key to the 
benefit-risk balance as conditions of the marketing 
authorisation to evaluate the long term safety in patients 
with relapsed CLL, indolent NHL refractory to rituximab and 
alkylating agents and haematological malignancies, 
respectively.

who progressed while on idelalisib treatment were evaluated 
and a subset was selected for sequencing to identify potential 
molecular mechanisms of disease progression. Cell sorting 
identified six (6) subject samples with both high tumour 
purity and available normal matched tissue.  
This final analysis showed that there are no coding mutations 
within this subject set which would reveal a common 
mutational mechanism of idelalisib resistance, either a 
mutation in the drug binding site (“gateway mutation”) or 
consistent mutations in any other pathway reflective of a 
common escape pathway/mechanism. In summary, no 
mechanistic explanations to the development of resistance to 
treatment with idelalisib have been identified clinical studies. 
There are no further ongoing or planned studies in B-cell 
malignancies aiming to further investigate this topic.

March 2016 the opinion of the European Medicines 
Agency further to the increased risk of death and 
serious adverse events observed in three clinical trials 
among subjects receiving idelalisib. The CHMP was 
requested to assess the impact thereof on the 
benefit-risk balance of Zydelig and to give its 
recommendation whether the marketing authorisation 
of this product should be maintained, varied, 
suspended or revoked.

study AD-312-2030, a study on the human 
enzymology of idelalisib oxidation, in fulfilment of the

Study PC-312-2016; a radioligand binding assay with 
GS-563117.  No changes to the product information

MAH has submitted data from a receptor screen with the 
main human metabolite GS-563117. No activity of 
importance was seen among 87 targets. In combination with 
the mouse toxicity study submitted in the parallel variation 
procedure II-01, these data support the view that 
GS-563117 is unlikely to contribute significantly to the 
toxicity of idelalisib. This post-approval measure (MEA 011) 
is considered fulfilled. No changes to the product information 
are necessary as a result of this study. 
These data do not have any impact on the benefit/risk 
balance of the product, which remains positive.

MAH has submitted data from a 4-week range-finding study 
in rasH2 (wildtype) mice. In contrast to what was seen in rats 
and dogs, exposure to the main human metabolite 
GS-563117 was substantial. No toxicity which could be

attributed to the metabolite was seen, and the company 
considers the metabolite toxicologically qualified by this 
study. Formally, this is not fully correct since the AUC did not 
reach human exposure. However, idelalisib is in itself toxic 
and exposure margins at the MTD for idelalisib were small. 
Toxicity appears to be solely related to the pharmacological 
activity, and the metabolite shows no activity (this is further 
addressed in the parallel variation procedure II-02). In 
totality, it is concluded that GS-563117 is unlikely to 
contribute significantly to the toxicity of idelalisib. This 
post-approval measure (MEA 010) is considered fulfilled. No 
changes to the product information are necessary as a result 
of this study. 
These data have no impact on the benefit/risk balance of the 
product which remains positive.

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR GIVLAARI 
(GIVOSIRAN) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Givlaari (givosiran).  The RMP 
details important risks of givosiran, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about givosiran’s risks and uncertainties (ie, missing 
information). 
Givosiran's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its Package Leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how givosiran should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for givosiran should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
givosiran's RMP. 
I.  The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Givosiran is authorized for treatment of Acute Hepatic Porphyria (AHP) in adults and 
adolescent patients.  It contains givosiran as the active substance and it is given by injection 
under the skin (subcutaneous injection). 
Further information about the evaluation of givosiran’s benefits can be found in givosiran’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency website under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/givlaari. 
II.  Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks  
Important risks of givosiran, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about givosiran’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The medicine’s legal status; the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including in the Periodic Safety Update Report assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of givosiran is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing information” below. 
 
 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of givosiran are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of givosiran.  Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
Important Potential Risk:  Hepatic (Liver) Effects 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
In toxicity studies in animals, minor and reversible changes in the 
liver and minimal-to-mild elevations in liver enzymes 
(transaminases) were seen at high doses. In clinical studies, 
transaminase elevations were observed more frequently in the 
givosiran group compared to placebo. These mostly occurred in the 
first 3 to 5 months of treatment with the majority resolving during 
continued dosing.  Due to pre-defined stopping rules in the 
protocol, one patient with ALT>8xULN discontinued treatment, 
and one patient with ALT>5xULN interrupted treatment and 
restarted givosiran at a lower dose of 1.25 mg/kg once monthly.  
There have been no reports of transaminase (ALT and AST) 
>3×ULN concurrent with total bilirubin>2×ULN on givosiran, and 
no cases of hepatitis or Hy’s law.   
AHP is associated with liver disease, including transaminase 
elevations, fibrosis, cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. Iron 
overload from chronic hemin administration is also a risk factor for 
hepatic effectsa,b,c  
Routine risk communication: 
•  The effect of givosiran on serum transaminases are described in 
the Special warnings and precautions for use Section 4.4 and 
 
 
 
 
 
Important Identified Risk:  None  
Important Potential Risk:  Hepatic (Liver) Effects 
Undesirable effects (Section 4.8) of the SmPC and in Section 2 
and Section 4 of the Package Leaflet. 
• 
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk: 
•  Liver function tests should be monitored prior to initiating 
treatment, monthly for the first 6 months, and as clinically 
indicated thereafter as described in Special warnings and 
precautions for use Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
Interruption or discontinuation should be considered for 
clinically relevant transaminase elevations as per Special 
warnings and precautions for use Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
In patients with clinically relevant transaminase elevations who 
have dose interruption and subsequent improvement in 
transaminase levels, dose resumption at 1.25 mg/kg once 
monthly could be considered as described in Posology and 
method of administration (Section 4.2) of the SmPC.  
• 
•  There are limited data on efficacy and safety of the lower dose, 
particularly in patients who previously experienced 
transaminase elevations. There are no data on sequentially 
increasing the 1.25 mg/kg dose to the 2.5 mg/kg dose after dose 
interruption for transaminase elevations (see section 4.8), as per 
Special warnings and precautions for use (Section 4.4) of the 
SmPC.

Important Potential Risk:  Renal (Kidney) Effects 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
In givosiran clinical studies, renal (kidney) adverse events, 
including worsening chronic kidney disease were observed more 
frequently in the givosiran group compared to placebo. Mild 
increases in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR have also been 
observed with givosiran treatment, which resolved or stabilized 
with ongoing dosing.  
It is possible that these changes may correlate with changes in blood 
pressure observed with givosiran treatment.  Therefore, the overall 
impact of givosiran treatment on renal function has not been fully 
characterized. 
 
 
 
 
 
Important Potential Risk:  Renal (Kidney) Effects 
Risk factors and risk groups  Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major risk factor associated 
Risk minimization measures 
with impaired renal function. Chronic kidney disease and 
hypertension are reported to occur in >50% of symptomatic AIP 
patientsa  
Routine risk communication: 
•  The effect of givosiran on renal function is described in the 
Special warnings and precautions for use Section 4.4 and 
Undesirable effects (Section 4.8) of the SmPC and in Section 2 
and Section 4 of the Package Leaflet. 
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk: 
•  Progression of renal impairment has been observed in some 
patients with pre-existing renal disease.  Careful monitoring of 
renal function during treatment is required in such cases, as 
described in the Special warnings and precautions for use 
(Section 4.4) of the SmPC

Important Potential Risk:  Pancreatitis 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Across the givosiran clinical program, two cases of pancreatitis 
have been reported in givosiran-treated patients, both considered 
unlikely related to givosiran due to the presence of gallbladder 
sludge or gallstones. Elevations in lipase and amylase were 
observed in both givosiran and placebo treatment groups, with a 
higher-grade severity observed more frequently in the placebo 
group than in the givosiran group. 
Pancreatic dysfunction has been reported in patients with AHP 
including elevations in amylase or lipase, acute and chronic 
pancreatitis, and a higher frequency of gallstonesa,b,c  
The potential role of givosiran treatment in pancreatitis has not been 
established.   
Risk factors and risk groups  Gallstones and gallbladder disease are major risk factors for the 
development of pancreatitis. 
Gallstones and pancreatitis may be increased in the AHP population

Important Potential Risk:  Clinical Consequences of Increased Blood Homocysteine Levels, in 
Particular Thromboembolic Events 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
Across the givosiran program, 16 patients had AEs coded to the 
terms representing the medical concept of blood homocysteine 
increase.  The majority of events were assessed as mild or moderate 
in severity.  Two events were considered severe and serious due to 
medical significance.   
An analysis of homocysteine levels in Study 003 using exploratory 
blood samples showed that homocysteine levels during givosiran 
treatment were increased compared to available baseline levels.  
Increases in homocysteine were not associated with adverse events, 
including thromboembolic events.   
Patients with AHP may have elevated homocysteine levels at 
baseline.  Homocysteine levels may be higher in patients with more 
active diseasea,b  
Routine risk communication: 
•  The effect of givosiran on blood homocysteine levels are 
described in the Special warnings and precautions for use 
(Section 4.4) and Undesirable effects (Section 4.8) of the 
SmPC.  
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk: 
•  Recommendation that blood homocysteine levels be measured 
prior to initiating treatment and monitored for changes during 
treatment is included in the Special warnings and precautions 
for use, Section 4.4 of the SmPC.   
•  Recommendation for physicians to consider homocysteine-
lowering therapy in patients with elevated homocysteine levels 
is also included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.

•  Study 002: 
Study 002 is an ongoing, multicenter, open-label extension study designed to evaluate 
the long-term safety and clinical activity of givosiran in AIP patients who have 
completed a previous early study of givosiran.  Sixteen patients transitioned to this 
study with different initial doses of givosiran and eventually switched to 2.5 mg/kg 
monthly.  In this study patients will receive givosiran up to 48 months.  
•  Study 003: 
 
 
 
 
 
Study 003 is an ongoing, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
longer-term givosiran dosing in adult patients with AHP who previously completed 
the double-blind portion of the study and will provide an opportunity to further 
evaluate the safety profile of givosiran.  In this study, patients will receive up to 3 
years of exposure to givosiran administered doses of 2.5 mg/kg or 1.25 mg/kg 
monthly.  
•  Company Sponsored AHP Registry:  
The Sponsor plans to conduct a prospective observational longitudinal Company-
sponsored AHP registry, to characterize the longer-term safety and effectiveness of 
givosiran in a real-world cohort of AHP patients.  The registry will also collect and 
evaluate information on pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, breast feeding and 
infant outcomes in women exposed to givosiran during pregnancy.

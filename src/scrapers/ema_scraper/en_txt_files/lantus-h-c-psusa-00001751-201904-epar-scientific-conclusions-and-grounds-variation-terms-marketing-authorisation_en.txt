Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for insulin glargine, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
The cumulative review of cutaneous amyloidosis included 29 cases of which 15 were well documented 
cases in which the event was confirmed with histopathology. These cases did not contain confounders 
and have a compatible time to onset. Together with the available evidence from literature and text 
books, this signal contains sufficient evidence to establish an association between insulin glargine and 
cutaneous amyloidosis.  As cutaneous amyloidosis may lead to insulin resistance due to poor absorption 
from the infiltrated site, health care professionals and patients should be informed of this event in the 
PI. Absorption of insulin could be improved by rotating the injection site. The MAH is therefore 
requested to include the event cutaneous amyloidosis in the SmPC and PIL. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for insulin glargine the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing insulin glargine is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

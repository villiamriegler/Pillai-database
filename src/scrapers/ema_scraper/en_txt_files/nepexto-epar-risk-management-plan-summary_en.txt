Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Nepexto (Etanercept) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Nepexto. The RMP details important 
risks of Nepexto, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Nepexto 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Nepexto's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Nepexto should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Nepexto  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Nepexto's 
RMP.

Further information about the evaluation of Nepexto’s benefits can be found in Nepexto’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/nepexto. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks 
Important risks of Nepexto, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products include: 
•  Specific  information, such as warnings,  precautions,  and advice on  correct  use,  in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Nepexto,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Nepexto  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks 
can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Nepexto. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk 1: Malignancy (including lymphoma and leukemia) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Reports  of  various  malignancies  (including  breast  and  lung 
carcinoma  and  lymphoma)  have  been  received  in  the  post-
marketing period. Based on current knowledge, a possible risk 
for  the  development  of  lymphomas,  leukaemia  or  other 
haematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a 
TNF-antagonist  cannot  be  excluded.  Melanoma  and  non-
melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Important identified risk 1: Malignancy (including lymphoma and leukemia) 
treated  with  TNF-antagonists,  including  etanercept.  Post-
marketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported 
very infrequently in patients treated with etanercept.  Analysis 
of the risk attributable to etanercept of relatively rare events like 
malignancy can be assessed by comparing the rates observed 
in the two phase 3 studies to those of an appropriate historical 
population. The observed number of extracutaneous cancers 
in  the  etanercept  psoriasis  database  (10  extracutaneous 
malignancies/1038.7 patient-years = 1.0 per 100 patient-years) 
is  not  significantly  different  from  the  expected  rate  based  on 
calculations  using  the  general  population  database  from  the 
National  Cancer  Institute’s  Surveillance,  Epidemiology,  and 
End Results (SEER) database (0.5 per 100 patient-years; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 0.2-1.1). The SEER database does 
not include non-melanoma skin cancers.  
Patients with RA have a 10 % increase in overall malignancy 
risk  compared  with  the  general  population.  Furthermore,  the 
standardized incidence ratio (SIR) estimates for patients with 
RA continued to show an increased risk of lymphoma and lung 
cancer  as  previously  observed.  Overall,  SIR  estimates  for 
colorectal and breast cancers continued to show a decrease in 
risk, whereas cervical cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma 
appeared to show no consistent trend in risk among patients 
with RA compared with the general population. Several studies 
have confirmed that the risk of malignancy in psoriasis patients 
exceeds  that  in  the  normal  population,  and  standardised 
incidence ratios of 1.78 (95% CI 1.32-2.40), 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-
1.4),  1.37  (95%  CI  1.28-1.47),  and  1.35  (95%  CI  1.22-1.49) 
have been reported.

Important identified risk 2: Serious and opportunistic infections (including tuberculosis, 
Legionella, Listeria and parasitic infections) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Rates  of  infections  (the  most  frequently  reported  adverse 
event)  were  related  to  the  duration  of  treatment.  The  most 
serious  infections  that  have  been  reported  with  medicinal 
products containing etanercept are invasive fungal infections, 
 
 
 
 
 
Important identified risk 2: Serious and opportunistic infections (including tuberculosis, 
Legionella, Listeria and parasitic infections) 
listeriosis  and  legionellosis,  active  tuberculosis,  including 
miliary  tuberculosis  and  tuberculosis  with  extra-pulmonary 
location.  Upper  respiratory  tract  infections  were  the  most 
commonly  reported  type  of  infection.  Increased  cough  and 
respiratory  disorders  (“colds”)  were  found  to  be  significantly 
more  frequent  (p<0.05)  in  the  high  dose  group  compared  to 
placebo and to the mid dose group. A trend (p< 0.10) toward 
association of fever with etanercept treatment overall and with 
high dose treatment as compared to placebo was noted. The 
majority  of  fevers  were  associated  with  infections  or  other 
inflammatory conditions. In the sepsis clinical trial, 108 patients 
with documented sepsis were treated with etanercept and 33 
patients received placebo. In this study, the patient group was 
severely 
immuno-compromised.  A  higher  mortality  was 
observed in the etanercept -treated than in the placebo-treated 
group  when  the  infection  was  caused  by  gram-positive  or 
unknown  microbes,  and  the  mortality  rate  was  raised  in  the 
groups treated  with  high  doses  of  etanercept.  The  increased 
mortality observed with increasing dose could not be explained 
by  imbalances  at  enrolment.  Mortality  was  not  related  to  an 
identifiable direct toxicity of etanercept. 
Standard-dose and high-dose biological drugs (with or without 
traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [DMARDs]) 
have  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  a  statistically 
significant increase in serious infections in methotrexate-naïve 
traditional 
rheumatoid  arthritis  patients  compared  with 
DMARDs; the absolute risk increase of serious infections with 
biologic therapy was identified as 6 per 1000 for standard-dose 
biologic and 17 per 1000 for high-dose biologic therapy. Patient 
on  concomitant treatment  with  other  immunosuppressant  are 
at additional risk.

Important identified risk 3: Demyelinating disorders 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
There have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in 
patients treated with etanercept. Additionally, there have been 
 
 
 
 
Important identified risk 3: Demyelinating disorders 
very rare reports of  peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies 
(including  Guillain-Barré  syndrome,  chronic 
inflammatory 
demyelinating  polyneuropathy,  demyelinating  polyneuropathy, 
and  multifocal  motor  neuropathy).    Although  no  clinical  trials 
have been performed evaluating etanercept therapy in patients 
with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other TNF antagonists in 
patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease 
activity. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Patients  with  pre-existing  or  recent  onset  of  demyelinating 
disease, or to those who are considered to have an increased 
risk of developing demyelinating disease.  
Risk  factors  for  GBS  include  male  sex,  prior  infection  (e.g. 
Campylobacter  jejuni,  Epstein  Barr  virus,  cytomegalovirus, 
mycoplasma,  HIV,  and  more  recently  Zika  virus,  vaccines, 
malignancies (e.g. lymphomas, especially Hodgkin's disease).

Risk factors and risk groups  PML  primarily  affects  individuals  with  chronically  and 
severely  suppressed  immune  systems  and  is  associated 
primarily with HIV patients, haematological malignancies, or 
relapsing–remitting  multiple  sclerosis  patients  treated  with 
natalizumab.  PML  is  also  associated  with  other  conditions 
such  as  organ 
transplantation,  solid  malignancies,

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, 
Based on results from a randomised clinical trial comparing 
breast-feeding information based on a publication 
Labelling and 
the safety and antibody responses to trivalent live 
(Brady et al., 2018). The variation also includes 
recommendations from the renewal procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/002617/0079/R) to update sections 4.4 
and 4.9 in relation to traceability and overdose, 
respectively, and to remove of the black triangle. In 
addition, the product information is updated based 
on the recommendations included in the Guideline on 
quality aspects included in the product information 
for vaccines for human use 
(EMA/CHMP/BWP/133540/2017). The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to introduce minor 
PL 
attenuated intranasal vaccine versus inactivated influenza 
vaccine when administered to breastfeeding women (Brady 
et al., 2018), no firm conclusion can be made of 
transmission of vaccine virus from the vaccinated mother to 
the infant. Limited available evidence suggests that the 
trivalent Fluenz is not excreted in breastmilk.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
VPRIV  (velaglucerase  alfa)  is  intended  for  enzyme  replacement  therapy  (ERT)  in  type  1  Gaucher 
disease. 
Gaucher  disease  (GD)  is  a  rare  lysosomal  storage  disorder  caused  by  mutations  in  the  GBA  gene, 
which encodes a lysosomal enzyme called β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) that catalyzes the breakdown 
of  glucosylcerebroside  (GlcCer).  The  ensuing  deficiency  in  GCase  activity  leads  to  intracellular 
accumulation  of  the  substrate,  GlcCer,  primarily  in  macrophages.  Because  of  the  burden  of  GlcCer 
storage  and  the  resulting  macrophage  activation,  a  number  of  pathological  consequences  arise, 
primarily in the spleen, liver, bone, lung, and brain.  
There is a considerable degree of variability in the clinical signs and symptoms of GD. From a clinical 
perspective, GD has been classified into three subtypes:  
−  Type 1 (nonneuropathic) 
−  Type 2 (acute neuropathic) 
−  Type 3 (sub-acute neuropathic)  
range  of 
symptoms, 
Type 1 GD is the most common subtype affecting an estimated 30,000 people worldwide, and patients 
display  a  wide 
splenomegaly,  hepatomegaly,  anaemia, 
including 
thrombocytopenia, bone complications. Type 2 GD presents in infancy and is characterised by a rapid 
neurodegenerative  course  with  widespread  visceral  involvement.  Failure  to  thrive  and  stridor  due  to 
laryngospasm  are  commonly  observed,  and  death  due  to  progressive  psychomotor  degeneration 
occurs  within  the  first  2  to  3  years  of  life.  Type  3  GD  presents  around  preschool  age  and  is 
characterised  by  visceral  and  bony  involvement,  in  addition  to  neurological  symptoms  such  as 
abnormal eye movements, ataxia, seizures, and dementia. The neurological symptoms usually appear 
later in life, and patients may survive until their third or fourth decade. 
Beside the palliative therapy, such as splenectomy, blood transfusions, and orthopaedic procedures, as 
well  as  occasionally  bone  marrow  transplantation,  there  are  currently  two  commercially  available 
therapies for the treatment of GD.  
− 
Imiglucerase is an Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) which is approved as first-line therapy 
for Type 1 and Type 3 GD in the EU;  
−  Miglustat is a substrate reduction therapy (SRT), a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, which 
is approved as second-line therapy when ERT is not a therapeutic option.  
The  goal  of  these  therapies  is  to  reduce  storage  of  GlcCer  in  affected  tissues  of  GD  patients.  ERT 
achieves  this  by  increasing  GCase  levels  through  administration  of  a  macrophage-targeted 
recombinant  GCase,  while  SRT 
the  ceramide  specific 
glucosyltransferase responsible for GlcCer biosynthesis. 
lowers  GlcCer 
levels  by 
inhibiting 
Velaglucerase  alfa  ,  is  a  human  GCase  that  is  produced  by  gene  activation  in  a  human  cell  line.  It  is 
being  developed  as  a  long-term  ERT  for  patients  with  type  1  Gaucher  disease.  It  is  secreted  as  a 
monomeric  glycoprotein  of  approximately  63  kD  containing  5  potential  N-linked  glycosylation  sites,  4 
of  which  are  occupied.  Regulatory  and  structural  DNA  sequences  are  inserted  at  specific  upstream 
positions  of  the  human  GCase  gene,  thereby  activating  the  endogenous  human  gene  to  produce 
velaglucerase alfa  in a human cell line. Natural GCase is expressed as a highly sialyated glycoprotein 
that contains complex carbohydrate chains and is poorly internalised by phagocytic cells. Velaglucerase 
alfa  is manufactured to contain predominantly high mannose-type-linked glycans. This high mannose 
form allows it to be effectively taken up by the phagocytic cells via mannose receptors. Velaglucerase 
alfa  drug product is a lyophilised powder for solution. 
The clinical development program comprised of several clinical studies enrolling a total of 113 patients 
with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  type  1  Gaucher  disease.  Selection  of  dose  and  dose  regimen  has 
primarily been based on preclinical assessments. Patients with type 2 or type 3 Gaucher disease were 
excluded.  The  clinical  programme  studied  treatment-naïve  patients  as  well  as  patients  transitioned 
from  imiglucerase.  Efficacy  assessment  for  studies  in  treatment-naïve  patients  focused  on

improvements  in  the  Hgb,  platelet  count,  and  liver  and  spleen  volumes.  Efficacy  assessment  for 
patients transitioning from imiglucerase focused on maintenance of improvement obtained. 
The claimed indication is:  
VPRIV  is  indicated  for  long-term  enzyme  replacement  therapy  (ERT) for  paediatric  and  adult  patients 
with type 1 Gaucher disease.  
The approved indication is: 
VPRIV is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with type 1 Gaucher 
disease.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Velaglucerase alfa is a purified recombinant form of the naturally occurring human lysosomal enzyme 
glucocerebrosidase  that  cleaves  glucocerebroside  to  glucose  and  ceramide.  It  is  produced  by  gene 
activation  technology  in  a  human  cell  line.  The  deduced  amino  acid  sequence  of  recombinant 
velaglucerase  alfa  is  identical  to  the  one  based  on  the  reported  genomic  sequence  of  human 
glucocerebrosidase.  
VPRIV  is  the  invented  name  of  velaglucerase  alfa  drug  product.  VPRIV  is  a  sterile  preservative-free 
lyophilised  powder  presented  in  a  glass  vial  and  closed  with  a  rubber  stopper.  The  drug  product  is  a 
lyophilised powder for solution presented in two strengths: 200U filled in a 5 mL vial and 400U filled in 
a 20 mL vial. 
The  final  formulation  of  the  drug  product  is  2.5  mg/mL  velaglucerase  alfa  in  50  mM  Na  citrate, 
containing 5% sucrose and 0.01% vol/vol polysorbate 20, at pH 6.0 after reconstitution.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Velaglucerase alfa is a glycoprotein, which belongs to the family of glycosyl hydrolases and hydrolyses 
the glycolipid glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide.  
It is produced by gene activation technology in an HT-1080 human fibroblast cell line and contains the 
same  amino  acid  sequence  as  the  naturally  occurring  human  lysosomal  enzyme  glucocerebrosidase. 
The  enzyme  is  expressed  as  fusion  protein  with  the  human  growth  hormone  signal  peptide  which 
triggers secretion of the 523 amino acid polypeptide chain into the medium. Upon secretion, the signal 
peptide  is  cleaved  resulting  in  a  497  amino  acid  chain  identical  to  the  protein  backbone  of  naturally 
occurring glucocerebrosidase. The relative molecular mass of velaglucerase alfa is 63 kDa, of which the 
glycostructures constitute 7 kDa. 
Velaglucerase  alfa  contains  5  potential  N-glycosylation  sites,  one  of  which  (N462)  is  unoccupied. 
Velaglucerase alfa contains predominantly high-mannose-type  N-linked glycans facilitating the uptake 
of velaglucerase alfa into the macrophages via the mannose receptor. Two disulfide linkages are built 
near the N-terminus involving 4 cysteines whereas 3 further cysteines remain as free thiols. 
2.2.2.1.  Manufacture of the Active Substance 
Cell Culture and Harvest 
The cell culture process starts with a vial(s) of working cell bank (WCB) which is thawed and expanded 
in shaker flasks and single-use bioreactors before inoculation of the 500 L production bioreactor. After 
Assessment report  
Page 6/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inoculation of the production bioreactor, the culture is continuously perfused with growth media until 
the required cell density for production is reached.  
After a defined cell density has been reached, the bioreactor is perfused with production medium.  
Harvests are collected then concentrated.  
Purification  
The  velaglucerase  alfa  purification  process  consists  of  three  subsequent  orthogonal  chromatographic 
steps followed by diafiltration and concentration steps. All columns are run in a bind/ elute mode.  
The drug substance is frozen and stored at -65 to -85 °C. 
The purification process is adequately described and proper in-process controls (IPCs) are set. 
Control of critical steps 
The  manufacturing  process  controls  are  divided  into  operational  and  performance  parameters  and 
classified as critical, key or non-key.  
• 
Critical  Operational  Parameter:  An  input  process  parameter  that  should  be  controlled  within  a 
meaningful, narrow operating range to ensure that drug substance quality attributes meet their 
specifications.  
Non-critical  Operational  Parameter:  All  input  process  parameters  that  fall  outside  the  definition 
for  critical  operational  parameter  are  non-critical.  These  parameters  are  divided  into  key  and 
non-key parameters. 
−  Key  Operational  Parameter:  An  input  process  parameter  that  should  be  carefully  controlled 
within a narrow range and is essential for process performance. A key operational parameter 
does not affect critical product quality attributes. 
• 
−  Non-key Operational Parameter: An input process parameter that has been demonstrated to 
be easily controlled or has a wide acceptable limit. 
Critical  parameters  are  specified  by  acceptance  ranges/  limits,  whereas  action  limits  are  foreseen  for 
key performance parameters. Acceptance ranges and action limits for the operational parameters have 
been  identified  in  down-scaled  runs,  partly  by  design  of  experiment  (DOE).  However,  several 
acceptance limits established for the commercial process were requested to be tightened as they were 
not  considered  sufficiently  justified  by  the  three  validation  runs.  These  will  be  addressed  by  the 
applicant as a post-authorisation commitment.  
Down-scaled  chromatography  models  were  used  for  process  characterisation,  establishment  of 
acceptance  criteria  for  IPCs,  spiking  (to  remove  host  cell  DNA  impurities)  and  recovery  studies.  
Bioburden is controlled throughout the process by action limits at several process steps. The applicant 
commits to implement new acceptance criteria for the critical process intermediates bulk harvest and 
unpurified bulk within six months after approval. 
The  operational  ranges  for  the  key  parameters  identified  for  the  cell  expansion  process,  bioreactor 
growth and harvest collection phases are considered legally binding. Linear velocity and collection set 
points  are  also  considered  key  operational  parameters.  Any  changes  of  the  respective  operational 
ranges will be submitted as type II variation.  
Three consistency runs were performed for cell culture and purification demonstrating that the process 
delivers  drug  substance  of  consistent  quality  when  operational  parameters  are  kept  at  the  center 
values of the predefined ranges.  
Control of materials 
Compendial  raw  materials  are  employed  where  available.  Non-compendial  raw  materials  are  tested 
according to respective in-house specifications. The recombinant human insulin used for cell culture is 
produced by yeast fermentation. 
Filter  and  chromatographic  resin  materials  used  during  the  manufacture  of  velaglucerase  alfa  are 
purchased by qualified manufacturers. They do not contain any materials of animal origin. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacturing Process Development  
During  velaglucerase  alfa  development,  several  manufacturing  process  changes  were  introduced.  The 
material  used  in  clinical  phase  I/  II  was  derived  from  a  perfused  bioreactor  with  serum-containing 
Assessment report  
Page 7/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adhesion  cultures.  From  phase  I/II  to  further  clinical  development,  the  commercial  process  was 
introduced being a serum-free suspension culture (i.e. all animal-derived components were removed).  
In  order  to  control  consistency  of  product  characteristics  throughout  process  development  up  to  the 
final  stage  of  the  manufacturing  process  comparability  exercises  were  performed  with  representative 
lots of each stage:   
Comparability of preclinical material and phase I/II material 
No physicochemical comparability data have been provided of batches manufactured at this early stage 
of process development. Significant change with regard to  product characteristics would normally not 
be expected as the main characteristics of the process potentially impacting the product characteristics, 
such as serum-based media and adherent culture were maintained. 
Comparability of phase I/II and commercial material 
Comprehensive  information  has  been  provided  to  summarise  the  changes  observed  in  product 
characteristics  upon  change  from  phase  I/II  material  to  initial  commercial  material.  A  subsequent 
change  to  the  manufacture  of  commercial  material  was  introduced  and  a  comparability  programme 
performed to support the change.  No deviations were observed from any of the acceptance criteria set 
so comparability of the material is considered supported.   
2.2.2.3.  Characterisation  
An  extensive  characterisation  programme  has  been  conducted  mainly  on  reference  standard  lots. 
State-of-the-art  analytical  methods  and  additional high level  methodological  approaches  were  applied 
to gain insight into structural features of velaglucerase alfa. 
The  primary  sequence  was  verified  by  combination  of  liquid  separation  with  mass  spectrometric 
detection. Absence of N- and C-terminal variability has been confirmed.  
Secondary  structure  measurements  confirmed  that  alfa  helix  and  beta  sheet  represent  the 
predominant structural elements in velaglucerase alfa. This finding has been supported by elucidation 
of the three-dimensional crystal structure. The studies revealed that velaglucerase alfa crystallises as a 
twin-molecule  with  each  part  consisting  of  three  domains  I,  II  and  III.  Domain  III,  the  largest  one 
contains the catalytic site. The crystal structure also confirmed two disulfide bonds in domain I derived 
from the close vicinity of the respective two pairs of cysteines in the crystal. Three remaining cysteines 
located  at  singular  positions  in  domain  III  remain  unpaired.  In  accordance  with  the  results  on 
secondary  structural  elements,  velaglucerase  alfa  appears  as  an  overall  rigid  molecule  with  particular 
short  sections  within  the  structure  acting  as  flexible  loops  to  allow  necessary  conformational 
arrangements  for  the  catalytic  site.  These  investigations  are  considered  very  valuable  to  understand 
the basic architecture of this molecule and verify a high level of purity of velaglucerase alfa. 
The X-ray crystal structure of velaglucerase alfa has also been elucidated.

molecule. 
Of 5 potential N-glycosylation sites within the primary structure of velaglucerase alfa, 4 are occupied. 
The  structural  variability  of  N-glycans  of  velaglucerase  alfa  is  limited,  because  of  the  company’s 
strategy to retain as much N-glycans as possible in the premature oligomannose structure. 
Overall  glycosylation  analysis  is  considered  comprehensive  taking  into  account  the  satisfactory 
responses  to  requests  for  clarification  and  verification  of  particular  structural  aspects  The  molecular 
weight  of  velaglucerase  alfa  has  been  characterised  using  a  different  analytical  methods.  Whereas 
standard methods such as Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOF  MS) determined the non-glycosylated MW as 55.7  kDA and the glycosylated MW as ~63 
kDa,  methods  that  address  the  native  molecule  in  solution  (e.g.  size  exclusion  HPLC  (SEC)  also 
including  Multi-Angle  Laser  Light  Scattering 
sedimentation  velocity  analytical 
ultracentrifugation  detection  (SV-AUC),  sedimentation  equilibrium  analysis  (SE))  revealed  that  the 
situation  is  more  complex.  The  latter  analytical  methods  indicated  that  molecular  subfractions  of 
velaglucerase  alfa  readily  self-associate  and  re-dissociate.  The  extent  of  association  depends  on  the 
protein concentration in solution. As a result the mean molecular weight is slightly elevated (up to 80 
kDa) as compared to the monomeric MW of 63 kDa.  
(MALLS), 
The biological activity of velaglucerase alfa has been addressed by enzymatic activity assays, a binding 
kinetics assay and in-vitro cellular (i.e. macrophages) uptake assays. Cellular uptake of velaglucerase 
alfa  into  macrophages  ensuring  delivery  of  the  replacement  enzyme  to  the  lysosomes  was  verified.  
The data on biological activity are considered satisfactory. 
Forced  degradation  studies  have  been  conducted  on  velaglucerase  alfa.  At  the  same  time  the  study 
served  to  demonstrate  the  stability  indicating  potential  of  the  methods  applied.  Overall  aggregation

and  oxidation  appear  as  the  major  susceptibility  categories  that  may  subsequently  also  impact 
biological activity. In this respect the Company is asked to provide further data supporting a potential 
correlation.  
A  comprehensive  summary  has  been  provided  on  potential  impurities  present  in  velaglucerase  alfa 
arising  from  the  process  or  product.  Adequate  control  of  these  impurities  is  ensured  by  orthogonal 
analytical methods capable to detect the molecular variants where considered necessary.  
2.2.2.4. 
 Control of the Active Substance  
Specifications 
Velaglucerase alfa active substance is released according to defined release specifications. 
The  drug  substance  specification  has  been  amended  according  to  the  various  requests  during  the 
marketing  authorisation  procedure.  References  to  the  analytical  methods  were  included  for  each  test 
parameter. All analytical methods have been appropriately validated. 
Release  specifications  for  the  drug  substance  include  controls  for  appearance,  peptide  mapping,  free 
thiol content, host cell protein, reversed phase HPLC, SDS-PAGE (Silver staining), size exclusion HPLC, 
cellular uptake bioassay, specific activity, protein concentration, bacterial endotoxin, bioburden, glycan 
mapping, osmolality, pH and polysorbate. 
Drug substance specification will be re-evaluated in total on a data basis of additional commercial scale 
lots.  
A  number  of  acceptance  limits  have  been  tightened  based  on  the  currently  available  data  base  and 
these acceptance limits will be reconsidered again in the future when more data is available.  Overall 
the presentation of method validation data is considered comprehensive and satisfactory.  
Reference Standards 
The  reference  standard  has  been  qualified  following  batch  release  testing  criteria  and  additional 
characterisation tests acceptance criteria including a comparison to the previous reference standard. A 
suitable procedure for future qualification of reference standards has been provided. 
2.2.2.5. 
 Stability of the Active Substance 
The shelf life was established based on data from commercial process batches. 36 months of stability 
studies  have  been  completed  for  3  clinical  lots  of  velaglucerase  alfa  drug  substance.  Further  9  –  12 
months  data  are  available  of  ongoing  stability  studies  on  several  additional  lots.  Similarly  6  months 
data are available for the 3 process validation lots.  
The  submitted  stability  data  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  of  36  months  at  long  term  storage 
conditions between -65 and -85°C. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines  (6.32  of  Vol.  4  Part  I  of  the  Rules  of  Governing  Medicinal 
Products in the European Union), any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, 
should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.2.6. 
 Adventitious Agents 
Multiple  levels  of  control  have  been  established  throughout  the  velaglucerase  alfa  manufacturing 
process to minimize the risk of microbial or adventitious virus contamination. Testing of the cell banks 
and routine testing of the unprocessed bulk as proposed by the applicant is deemed sufficient.  
For cell culture no animal derived material is used. The virus reduction data presented by the applicant 
show that the purification process contains several steps, which are considered effective for eliminating 
potential  viral  contamination.  For  some  model  viruses  (Bovine  Diarrhoea  Virus  (BVDV),  Porcine 
Parvovirus  (PPV))  the  column  steps  only  contribute  moderately  to  virus  clearance,  however 
nanofiltration has been shown to be an effective step. The company has committed to add to the virus 
validation studies for one of the column steps.

The  container  closure  system  consists  of  Ph.Eur.  type  I  glass  vials  and  butyl  rubber  stoppers  with  a 
fluoro-resin coating. 
Prior to use, the lyophilised powder is reconstituted by addition of 2.2 ml (200U) or 4.3 ml (400U) of 
WFI to enable withdrawal of a nominal volume of 2 or 4 ml, respectively, containing 2.5 mg protein per 
mL.  The  reconstituted  drug  product  is  further  diluted  in  0.9%  sodium  chloride  prior  to  application. 
Considering the recommended dose of 60 U/kg, several vials are needed for one administration which 
is applied every other week as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. The components of the drug product 
solution are demonstrated to be suitable to ensure sufficient velaglucerase alfa stability in the liquid as 
well as the lyophilised product. All clinical studies were performed with VPRIV drug product formulation 
as intended for commercial production.  
2.2.3.1.  Manufacture of the Finished Product 
The  production  process  consists  of  formulation,  sterile  filtration,  filling  and  lyophilisation  procedures. 
Suitable IPCs are introduced and their action limits or acceptance criteria are considered justified and 
adequate.    The  set-points  of  the  operational  parameters  for  the  compounding  step  were  adequately 
evaluated  by  appropriate  process  development  studies.  The  acceptable  ranges  of  the  critical 
parameters of the lyophilisation process were confirmed by using design of experiment (DOE) in a lab-
scale  lyophiliser.  Furthermore,  the  loading  of  the  manufacturing  lyophiliser,  the  holding  times  during 
drug  product  processing,  the  duration  of  the  lyophilisation  steps  and  the  overall  maximum  process 
time  from  start  via  sterile  filtration  to  the  completion  of  fill  were  evaluated  at  commercial  scale  with 
regard to velaglucerase alfa stability and are considered justified.  
The process validation approach including the number and the size of the validation batches chosen is 
in  accordance  with  the  EU  requirements.  All  validation  batches  complied  with  the  established  in-
process and release specifications as well as additional process monitoring data. Based on the results 
the commercial manufacturing process of VPRIV 200U/vial and 400U/vial can be considered validated.

2.2.3.2. 
 Pharmaceutical Development 
Comparability  studies  were  performed  to  support  slight  process  modifications  implemented  during 
VPRIV finished product development. The studies confirm comparability for 400U/vial before and after 
process  modification  and  demonstrate  no  significant  difference  between  drug  product  quality  of 
400U/vial  and  200U/vial  at  release  and  under  stress  conditions  after  process  adaptation.  All  batches 
used in the pivotal clinical studies were produced according to the commercial production process.    
2.2.3.3. 
 Control of the Finished Product 
Specifications 
The drug product release specification have been defined. 
Release  specifications  for  the  drug  product  include  controls  for  appearance,  SDS-PAGE  (Western), 
Reversed  Phase  HPLC,  Size  Exclusion  HPLC  (SE-HPLC),  specific  activity,  content  uniformity,  bacterial 
endotoxin, sterility, moisture content, osmolarity, particulates, pH, polysorbate. 
In  general,  the  drug  product  release  specification  is  considered  adequate  to  control  drug  product 
quality. As required, a test for quantity of velaglucerase alfa and a specification limit for the SE-HPLC 
impurity  peak  was  added  to  the  testing  programme.  The  Company  commits  to  re-evaluate  the 
specification limits  when more  batch  data  are  available.    The  test  methods  are  either  identical  to  the 
procedures  used  for  drug  substance  analysis  or  comply  with  the  Ph.  Eur.  For  the  colorimetric  activity 
assay,  historical  data  will  be  evaluated  and/or  additional  studies  will  be  performed  as  a  post-
authorisation  commitment  to  provide  required  precision  for  drug  product  analysis  in  the  presence  of 
sucrose.  Identity testing in drug product analysis was adequately validated. Totally, release results of 
19 drug product batches have been presented which all met the drug product specification.  
13 drug product batches were used in the pivotal clinical studies. The impurity profiles of these batches 
have  been  evaluated  retrospectively,  in  particular  the  product-related  proteins.    The  MAH  confirmed 
that the batches used in the clinical studies had been stored for about 24 months prior to use. Taking 
into account the trend in the impurity profile that had been observed during stability studies together 
with  the  method  impreciseness  calculated  it  is  considered  proven  that  drug  product  batches  with  an 
amount of up to the maximum impurity limits were used in clinical trials. In consequence, the amounts 
of product-related proteins are deemed qualified up to their specification limits.  
2.2.3.4. 
 Stability of the Finished Product 
Stability  studies  have  been  conducted  with  clinical  and  validation  batches.  Drug  substance  from  the 
previous and current processes were used for production of the drug product stability batches.  
The  design  and  testing  program  of  the  stability  studies  are  acceptable.  A  re-evaluation  of  the 
acceptance criteria of the shelf life specification is requested as post-authorisation commitment. 
The  long-terms  stability  data  are  considered  adequate  to  support  a  shelf  life  of  36  months  for  VPRIV 
400U/vial.    For  VPRIV  200  U/vial,  a  shelf  life  of  18  months  at  5±3°C  is  acceptable  based  on  the 
updated stability data.  
Stability  data  of  studies  under  accelerated  and  stress  conditions  demonstrate  a  decrease  of  the  main 
peaks  after  HPLC  analysis  over  the  time.  ConcomitantSE-HPLC  impurity  peaks  increase,  whereas  no 
significant  change  of  the  amount  of  aggregates  was  observed.  Photodegradation  of  VPRIV  can  be 
prevented  by  storage  of  the  vials  in  the  outer  package  as  confirmed  by  appropriate  photostability 
studies. 
A  post  approval  stability  protocol  is  provided.  The  parameters  and  their  acceptance  criteria  are 
identical  to  the  proposed  drug  product  shelf  life  specification.  Stability  studies  after  approval  will  be 
only conducted at storage temperature of 5 ±3°C.

In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines  (6.32  of  Vol.  4  Part  I  of  the  Rules  of  Governing  Medicinal 
Products  in  the  European  Union),  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant  negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
Conclusions: 
The proposed drug product shelf lives are 36 months for the 400 U/vial and 18 months for the 200 
U/vial at the long term storage condition of at 5±3°C, as supported by the available stability data. 
In-use stability 
Drug  product  stability  after  reconstitution  and  dilution  with  sterile  WFI  was  evaluated,  also  about  the 
end of shelf life. The following storage instructions are included in the SmPC:  
‘Chemical  and  physical  in  use  stability  has  been  demonstrated  for  24  hours  at  2°C  to  8°C  under 
protection from light. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If 
not  used  immediately,  in  use  storage  times  and  conditions  prior  to  use  are  the  responsibility  of  the 
user and must not exceed 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C.’ 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Adequate information regarding the manufacturing process of the drug substance was provided by the 
applicant.  The  used  human  cell  line  was  sufficiently  characterised  and  is  considered  suitable  for  the 
production of velaglucerase alfa. The three validation/conformance batches at commercial scale for cell 
culture  and  purification  support  the  consistent  performance  of  the  drug  substance  manufacturing 
process when the critical and key operational parameters are met at the center values of the proposed 
acceptable  ranges.  Thus,  the  validation  of  the  whole  ranges  of  acceptance  criteria  is  considered 
supported by the results of the down-scale process characterisation studies. The classification of some 
operational  parameters  as  “key”  was  confirmed  by  the  Company  as  well  as  the  introduction  of 
bioburden rejection limits at distinct steps. 
Characterisation of velaglucerase alfa was performed at a high level yielding valuable insights into the 
structural  features  of  the  molecule  and  thus  a  satisfactory  detailed  picture  on  the  nature  of 
velaglucerase alfa. Further clarification on the various association states in solution including potential 
distinction  between  these  stages  was  hampered  by  the  limited  stability  of  these  fractions  towards 
sample  handling  procedures.  Drug  substance  batches  produced  by  the  commercial  process  displayed 
consistent  velaglucerase  alfa  quality  well  in  accordance  with  the  proposed  specifications.  Analytical 
procedures used for lot release and the corresponding validation reports are considered adequate and 
the necessary clarification required in this respect was provided with sufficient detail. A shelf life of 36 
months at long term storage conditions can be supported based on satisfactory stability data. 
Multiple  levels  of  control  have  been  established  throughout  the  velaglucerase  alfa  manufacturing 
process to minimize the risk of microbial or adventitious virus contamination. For cell culture no animal 
derived  material  is  used.  Testing  of  the  cell  banks  and  routine  testing  of  the  unprocessed  bulk  as 
suggested by the applicant is deemed sufficient. Virus reduction data show that the purification process 
contains  several  steps,  which  are  considered  effective  for  eliminating  potential  viral  contamination. 
Although  for  some  model  viruses  (BVDV,  PPV)  the  column  steps  only  contribute  moderately  to  virus 
removal, the overall strategy for virus clearance is deemed adequate, as nanofiltration has been shown 
to be an effective step. 
Information on the development of the drug product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The 
manufacturing process was demonstrated to be sufficiently under control to consistently produce drug 
product of the defined quality. Based on the analytical procedures applied, the tests carried out at drug 
product release confirmed consistent product quality. For bioburden prior to sterile filtration a rejection 
limit  has  been  defined.  The  impurity  profiles  of  all  batches  used  in  the  pivotal  clinical  studies  were 
evaluated. Based on these data evidence is provided that drug product batches with an amount of up 
to  the  maximum  limit  for  impurities  had  been  used  in  clinical  trials.  Thus,  the  product-related 
impurities determined by use of SE-HPLC are considered as being qualified at their specification limits. 
Based on stability data provided so far, no significant drug product instability can be observed. A shelf 
life  of  36  months  (400  U  vial)  and  18  months  (200  U  vial)  is  justified.  Furthermore,  it  was 
demonstrated  by  appropriate  tests,  that  photodegradation  of  velaglucerase  alfa  drug  product  can  be 
avoided by storage in the outer package.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In  general,  the  development,  manufacture,  characterisation  and  control  of  drug  substance  and  drug 
product  as  described  in  the  quality  dossier,  Modules  2.3  and  3,  are  considered  adequate  to  produce 
velaglucerase  alfa  of  sufficient  quality  in  a  consistent  manner.  With  regard  to  virus  safety  the  overall 
strategy as described by the applicant is considered adequate.  
All quality concerns identified during the assessment of the dossier have been solved by the Company 
satisfactorily. Quality follow-up measures have been identified and are listed in section 2.11. 
2.2.6.  GMP compliance 
Pre-approval GMP inspections of three sites responsible for the manufacture of VPRIV drug substance 
and drug product have been conducted: 
- Shire Human Genetic Therapies, Inc. 205 Alewife Brook Parkway, Cambridge, USA (site responsible 
for active substance manufacture and storage).  
A pre-approval inspection of this site with focus on locations used for velaglucerase alfa production was 
requested  as  parts  of  this  manufacturing  plant  were  not  covered  by  the  last  routine  inspection.    This 
inspection  took  place  on  took  place  on  15-17  June  2010  and  the  site  was  found  to  be  in  compliance 
with EU GMP. 
-  Eminent  Services  Corporation  -  7495  New  Technology  Corporation,  Frederick,  MD,  USA  (site 
responsible for the storage of finished product unlabelled vials). This inspection took place on 18th June 
2010 and the site was found to be in compliance with EU GMP. 
-  Cheasapeake  Biological  Laboratories  (CBL)  -  Baltimore,  MD,  USA  (site  responsible  for  the 
manufacture of the finished product).  
A pre-approval inspection was considered necessary for this site, as the lyophilisation process intended 
for the VPRIV drug product production was not covered by the recent inspection. This inspection took 
place  on  21  –  22  June  2010  and  the  site  was  found  to  be  in  compliance  with  EU  GMP  pending 
submission  and  assessment  of  an  appropriate  corrective  action  plan  by  the  manufacturer.    The 
manufacturer has committed to submit the appropriate corrective action plan and the MAH committed 
to ensure that the corrective action plan will be implemented by 30 September 2010.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-neuronopathic  Gaucher  disease  (GD)  is  characterized  by  an  enzymatic  deficiency  to  biodegrade 
glucocerebrosides.  The  cell  population  mostly  affected  by  this  deficiency  are  macrophages  which 
accumulate  glucocerebrosides  derived  from  cell  membranes  of  phagocytosed  cells  and  turn  thereby 
into  so  called  Gaucher  cells  or  storage  cells.  Velaglucerase  alfa  is  a  biotechnologically  generated  β-
glucocerebrosidase,  engineered  to  be  taken  up  via  the  mannose-receptor  of  macrophages  after  IV 
administration. Velaglucerase alfa is the third in a line of enzymes designed as therapy for this disease 
after alglucerase and imiglucerase. Velaglucerase alfa is structurally similar to imiglucerase.  
Preclinical development programme for velaglucerase alfa is aimed to support the use of this product 
for the treatment of GD and consists of pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The  pharmacology  programme  is  limited  but  considered  to  be  adequate  for  this  type  of  product,  i.e. 
recombinant endogenous enzyme. 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
 A  mouse  model  of  Gaucher  disease  (D409V/null  Mouse)  was  used  to  compare  the  effect  of 
velaglucerase alfa with imiglucerase. This animal model was chosen because it has features similar to 
human  type  1  Gaucher  disease  (GD),  namely  accumulation  of  “storage  cells”  (glucocerebroside-laden 
macrophages) in the lung, liver and spleen early in the pathogenic process, and a lack of pathology in 
the brain.  
Three  separate  studies  (751-1U0-09  1222,  -1223,  -1224)  were  conducted,  using  essentially  similar 
protocols  but  different  enzyme  doses  (5,  15  and  60  units/kg,  respectively).  Animals  were  dosed 
intravenously  with  velaglucerase  alfa,  imiglucerase  or  saline  once  a  week  for  4  or  8  weeks.  The 
measured  endpoints included tissue accumulation of glucosylceramide (GC) in several visceral organs 
and  presence  of  lipid-laden  macrophages  (storage  cells),  since  these  are  among  the  earliest  defects 
observed in human GD, and are thought to be causative of later disease sequelae. Wild type mice were 
used as controls.  
The D409V/null mouse appears to be a relevant animal model of GD type I (non-neuronopathic GD). In 
this animal model, two characteristics of GD, elevated glucocerebroside levels in the liver and spleen, 
and  appeareance  of  storage  cells  (Gaucher  cells)  in  the  liver,  were  effectively  counteracted  at  doses 
even much lower than the clinically intended one. Furthermore, velaglucerase alfa and imiglucerase act 
similarly and comparably in this animal model. This series of experiments provides a reasonable proof 
that velaglucerase alfa has similar effects in vivo as imiglucerase. However, no conclusions about the 
long  term  efficacy  can  be  drawn.  The  CHMP  requested  information  on  the  exact  procedure  for  the 
determination  of  the  number  of  storage  cells  in  various  tissues  and  on  the  processing  of  histological 
slides  and  the  additionally  provided  information  was  considered  satisfactory.  Data  on  binding  of 
imiglucerase  to  the  isolated  recombinant  human  mannose  receptor  in  the  same  experimental  setting 
were also requested with the view to examine whether there is a difference between velaglucerase alfa 
and imiglucerase in binding behaviour to the mannose receptor. It was acknowledged that due to the 
artificial  in  vitro  test  system,  non-physiological  binding  between  the  soluble  receptor  molecules  and 
mannose  residues  of  enzyme  immobilized  in  high  density  onto  a  surface  might  occur.  Effective  cell 
uptake of velaglucerase alfa has been shown before in a cell based assay. Animal data with a mouse 
model  of  Gaucher  disease  (D409V/null  mouse)  have  shown  that  velaglucerase  alfa  activity  in  vivo  is 
overall indistinguishable from activity of imiglucerase. Clinical data as well have demonstrated efficacy 
of  velaglucerase  alfa.  Therefore,  the  apparently  lower  affinity  between  the  human  mannose  receptor 
and velaglucerase alfa  compared to imiglucerase suggested by the in vitro binding data is considered 
to be of little relevance and superseded by in vivo animal and clinical data.

2.3.2.2. 
 Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  performed.  This  approach  was  based  on  ICH  S7A 
Guidance,  Safety  Pharmacology  Studies  for  Human  Pharmaceuticals.  Considering  the  high  similarity 
between  velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase  and  due  to  the  clinical  and  preclinical  experience  with 
imiglucerase, the conduct of secondary pharacodynamics studies is considered dispensable. 
2.3.2.3. 
 Safety pharmacology programme 
No separate safety pharmacology studies were conducted but cardiovascular safety was evaluated in a 
6-month  rhesus  monkey  toxicity  study  (TKT-1U0-00-003).  The  animals  received  doses  of  up  to  15 
mg/kg i.v. every other week. ECG examinations were performed prior to the study and during weeks 
12 and 24 (on a non-dosing day), and from recovery animals during week 28. The ECGs were recorded 
and qualitatively evaluated. 
Examination of the ECGs from all monkeys at the pre-study, week 12, 24 and 28 time-points did not 
reveal any velaglucerase alfa  related effects on ECG parameters (PR, QRS and QT intervals) including 
any  evidence  of  QTc  prolongation  or  abnormalities  in  waveform  morphology  or  heart  rhythm.  In 
addition, there were no adverse effects on clinical chemistry, heart weight, or macroscopic/microscopic 
findings in the heart related to velaglucerase alfa. In this study, IV bolus doses up to 17 mg/kg, i.e., 
11-fold  the  highest  anticipated  clinical dose  (1.5  mg/kg;  IV  infusion)  did  not  have  any  effects  on  the 
cardiovascular system of rhesus monkeys. 
Core  batteries  of  CNS  and  respiratory  safety  measurements  were  not  addressed  as  endpoints  in 
general  toxicity  studies  or  as  dedicated  studies.  However,  in  all  of  the  general  toxicity  or 
developmental  and  reproductive  toxicity  studies  conducted,  no  clinical  observations  of  velaglucerase 
alfa  -related  effects  on  cardiovascular,  CNS  or  respiratory  parameters  were  noted.  It  is  therefore 
acceptable that no separate safety pharmacology studies are considered necessary. 
2.3.2.4. 
 Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  specific  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  performed.  Due  to  the  clinical  and 
preclinical experience with imiglucerase no pharmacodynamic interaction studies for velaglucerase alfa 
are considered necessary. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
All pharmacokinetic studies used the intravenous route. Single dose pharmacokinetic parameters, e.g. 
absorption patterns, were determined in rats and dogs and multiple dose measurements were made as 
a  part  of  the  6-months  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  rhesus  monkeys.  Combined  distribution  and 
excretion  were  studied  in  the  rat.  In  addition,  pharmacokinetic  studies  in  rats  and  rhesus  monkeys 
were  conducted  to  assess  the  comparability  of  velaglucerase  alfa  produced  in  roller  bottle  and 
bioreactor cell cultures. Overall, the extent of the nonclinical pharmacokinetic programme is adequate; 
no metabolism studies were conducted, which is acceptable for this kind of product. 
Three  methods  were  used  for  determination  of  the  kinetics  of  velaglucerase  alfa:  determination  of 
enzyme activity, radiochemical labelling and detection of velaglucerase alfa, and the detection of anti-
velaglucerase alfa antibodies in serum. 
After  single  dose  IV  administration,  serum  elimination  followed  1st  order  kinetics  in  rats  at  all  doses 
tested (based on determination of enzymatic activity). In dogs at the low dose 1st order kinetics were 
observed as well, but at the high dose 1st order elimination kinetics were observed starting 20 minutes 
post  administration.  After  repeated  dose  IV  administration  every  other  week  in  Rhesus  monkeys, 
serum elimination followed 1st order kinetics at all doses tested. Whereas Cmax was dose proportional, 
AUC increased more than in a dose-proportional manner in all three species. 
Two  distribution  studies  (TKT-1U0-01-001  and  -008)  with  125I-labelled  velaglucerase  alfa  were 
conducted in S-D rats. The animals were given bolus IV injections at nominal doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg 
Assessment report

(3-5  µCi/  animal),  collecting  tissue  samples  at  various  time  points  and  determining  radioactivity  by 
liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Only 6% of the radioactivity is found in the blood. Other tissues with 
high  initial  125I  (velaglucerase  alfa)-concentrations  at  this  dose  are  lungs,  spleen  bone  marrow  and 
kidneys. If a ten times higher dose (10 mg/kg) is administered, the portion distributed to the liver is 
reduced from 70% to 24 %, whereas at this high dose the portion found in the blood is increased from 
6% to 38%. Such pharmacokinetic behaviour indicates a saturation of an uptake mechanism, which is 
in agreement with saturation of the assumed mannose-receptor mediated uptake mechanism.  
Serum  half-life  of  velaglucerase  alfa  was  determined  to  be  in  the  range  of  minutes  (based  on 
determination of enzymatic activity). At the low dose a serum half-life from 2.3 to 3.6 minutes (rats) 
to  4.0  to  4.7  minutes  (monkeys)  was  calculated.  At  higher  doses,  longer  serum  half-lives  were 
observed,  with  a  maximum  value  of  11  minutes  determined  in  monkeys  at  a  20  fold  higher  dose.  In 
Cynomolgus  monkeys  a  serum  half-life  of  7-8  minutes  has  been  reported  in  the  Cerezyme  EPAR. 
Therefore,  pharmacokinetics  in  plasma  appears  to  be  comparable  between  velaglucerase  alfa  and 
imiglucerase. 
Regarding tissue elimination in the rat (determined using radiolabelled velaglucerase alfa), a terminal 
half-life  of  about  17  hours  for  the  liver  and  13  hours  for  the  spleen  was  calculated.  Due  to  these 
terminal  tissue-half-lives  and  due  to  the  protein  nature  of  velaglucerase  alfa,  accumulation  of 
velaglucerase  alfa  in  humans  with  IV  administration  every  other  week  is  therefore  not  expected  to 
occur.  
Radioactivity of 125I-radiolabelled velaglucerase alfa in the rat was nearly completely excreted via urine 
within 48 hours post IV administration. 
No pharmacokinetics interaction studies were submitted and this is considered acceptable for this type 
of product. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Velaglucerase alfa was tested in a series of toxicology studies using bolus IV dose administration. 
These studies included an acute study, 3- and 6-month studies in Sprague Dawley (S-D) rats, and a 6-
month study in rhesus monkeys. All studies in the toxicology program were conducted according to 
current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) unless indicated.

2.3.4.1. 
 Single dose toxicity 
In  the  single  dose  toxicity  study  TKT-1U0-00-004,  the  animals  received  a  single  bolus  IV  dose  of 
velaglucerase  alfa  via  the  tail  vein  and  were  sacrificed on  either  Day  2  or  Day  15.  Toxicological 
evaluations  included  mortality,  clinical  observations/physical  examinations,  body  weight,  clinical 
pathology, organ weights, gross necropsy, and histopathological examinations. The study revealed no 
specific toxicity up to the highest dose tested 20 mg/kg bodyweight (corrected to 23 mg/kg). However, 
some experimental shortcomings were identified. Due to an incidental clotting of blood samples on day 
2, three animals/group/sex were additionally included in the study to replace the lost animals. Based 
on the information provided, the CHMP concluded that the inclusion of the additional animals seems to 
be acceptable in order to avoid unnecessary replication of the study, which is also favourable from the 
animal welfare perspective. The results upon physical examination, body weight, body-weight gain and 
organ  weight  gain  were  not  affected.  Although  the  statistical  impact  of  the  haematology  and 
coagulation parameters after 24 hours may be affected, it is acknowledged that these parameters were 
also obtained in the repeated dose toxicity studies with no specific findings and, thus the matter does 
not raise further concern.  
2.3.4.2. 
 Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
The  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed in  rats  and  monkeys  for  up  to  6  months  duration 
and an additional recovery period. Velaglucerase alfa was administered every second week via a bolus 
IV route. Details of the repeat toxicity studies and summary of the results are presented in the table 
below.

In the rat studies of 3 months (TKT-1U0-00-005) and 6 months (TKT-1U0-00-006), the main findings 
were  transient  swelling  of  paws,  limbs  and  muzzle  that  occurred  shortly  after  the  injections 
administration and disappeared within 24 hours. In the 3-month rat study TKT-1U0-00-005, formation 
of  antibodies  against  the  administered  substance  was  observed  in  some  animals,  whereas  in  the 
second rat study TKT-1U0-00-006, antibodies against the test substance were detectable in all dosing 
groups.  
In  study  TKT-1U0-00-005,  a  decrease  in  the  serum  urea  nitrogen  concentration  was  observed  in  all 
male  treatment  groups.  This  was  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  serum  albumin  concentration  in  the 
low  and  mid  dose  group  males  and  an  increase  in  pH  values  in  males  in  the  high  dose  group.  These 
effects may indicate a possible effect on the glomerular filtration rate and since no structural changes 
of the kidney histology were reported, no significant damage of the kidney is expected.  
The observed signs of swelling and reddening appeared to be histamine-mediated antigen reactions. In 
blood samples on day 169 no increase of histamine values could be detected in the 6 month rat study. 
Contrary  to  this,  in  the  additional  non-GLP  rat  study  SHGT-1U0-06-017  on  histamine  release  and 
complement activation, a marked histamine release was observed 15 minutes post dose administration, 
Assessment report  
Page 19/59 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
whereas  complement  activation  did  not  occur.  Therefore,  the  mechanism  remains  unclear;  histamine 
release seems a likely cause but was not found in the repeat-dose toxicity study.  Hypersensitivity and 
infusion  related  reactions  are  clearly  stated  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  and  the  overall  clinical 
relevance is minor.  
In study TKT-1U-00-06, less frequent laboured breathing, reduced activity and/or lateral decumbency 
were  observed  in  all  groups  including  vehicle  control.  Convulsions  were  observed  in  3  animals  of  the 
mid dose group only. In general, these effects were less frequent and less severe in the vehicle control 
and  in  the  low  dose  groups.  It  remains  unclear  why  these  reactions  are  only  apparent  in  this  study, 
since  the  identical  formulation  was  tested  in  the  other  rat  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  but  no  such 
effects were reported. Nevertheless, the prediction of animal models for immunogenicity in humans is 
low  and  no  such  effects  were  reported  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  monkeys.  Body  weight, 
food  consumption  and  ophthalmoscopic  parameters  appear  to  be  unaffected.  Statistical  significant 
differences  in  haematology  and  clinical  biochemistry  parameters  between  treated  and  control  groups 
were considered to be incidental and with no toxicological implication. A dose related reduction of total 
triglycerides was observed in the high dose group males. A statistically non significant increase in the 
other dosing groups seems to be apparent, but without a toxicological significance.  
In  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  TKT-1U0-00-003  in  monkeys,  animals  received  slow  (1  to  2 
minutes) bolus IV injections of velaglucerase alfa every 2 weeks via a cephalic or saphenous vein (total 
of  13  doses).  An  antibody  formation  in  the  high  dose  group  has  been  detected.  Since  velaglucerase 
alfa is a protein of human origin, this is an anticipated effect and considered to be not adverse. During 
the  course  of  the  study  a  reduction  of  AUC  and  Cmax  was  observed,  but  no  correlation  to  antibody 
formation could be established. Additional findings were elevations in LDH, AST, and, to a lesser extent, 
ALT, that occurred sporadically throughout the study. These findings are not judged severe enough to 
demand  additional  primate  studies.  Overall,  the  analytical  methods  and  statistical  analyses  used  in 
these  trials  are  considered  adequate.  Nevertheless,  a  cell-based  assay  addressing  the  potential 
hindrance of cellular uptake by neutralising anti-drug antibodies will be developed and validated via a 
Follow-up measure as agreed with the CHMP. 
In terms of the assessment of toxicokinetics, estimations of safety factors on a mg/kg b.w. basis and 
based  on  the  surface  area  (mg/m2)  were  provided.  The  high  dose  (17  mg/kg)  in  the  repeated  dose 
toxicity  studies  represents  an  11-fold  safety  margin  to  the  intended  maximal  human  dose  (60 
U/kg).The  safety  margins  with  1.8  to  3.7  calculated  for  the  Human  Equivalent  Dose  (HED)  are 
considered  rather  low,  however,  since  no  relevant  toxic  effects  could  be  detected  within  the  toxicity 
studies, the low safety margin is considered acceptable. In addition, the AUCs were compared with the 
human  value  obtained  in  study  TKT025  after  multiple  administration  of  the  maximum  clinical  dose  of 
60 U/kg b.w. The animal to human factor was calculated to be between 0.45 to 0.18 times.  
2.3.4.3. 
 Genotoxicity 
Studies  on  the  genotoxicity  of  velagucerase  alfa  have  not  been  performed  in  accordance  with  the 
Guideline  ICH  S6  stating  that  classical  genotoxicity  testing  does  not  provide  an  appropriate  testing 
model and these substances are not expected to interact directly with DNA or chromosomal material.  
2.3.4.4. 
 Carcinogenicity 
Studies on the carcinogenic potential have not been performed. This is in line with the ICH S6 guideline 
stating that standard carcinogenicity studies are generally considered inappropriate for biotechnology-
derived  pharmaceuticals.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  rational  for  omitting  carcinogenicity  studies 
with velaglucerase alfa is acceptable.  
2.3.4.5. 
 Reproduction Toxicity 
Reproductive  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  in  rats  (fertility,  embryo-foetal  development  and 
pre-  and  postnatal  development)  and  rabbits  (embryo-foetal  development)  in  accordance  to  GLP  and 
ICH  recommendations.  Embryo-foetal  developmental  studies  were  preceded  by  dose  range  studies  in 
both  species.  The  following  table  provides  an  overview  on  the  studies  conducted  including  major 
findings in the parent and F1-generation as well as the corresponding NOAELs:

A  full  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  program  in  rats  and  rabbits  has  been  conducted.  
Treatment  with  velaglucerase  alfa  induced  swelling  in  the  face  and/or  paws  in  rats.    As  the  swelling 
was transient and without any effect on body weights, not observed on treatment free days or in any 
other  species  tested,  it  was  concluded  that  this  histamine  release  was  specific  to  the  rat  strain  used 
and without any relevance to humans. Treatment with velaglucerase alfa twice weekly slightly reduced 
male fertility and fecundity at the highest dose tested (17 mg/kg, twice weekly) but had no effect on 
female  reproductive  capacity.  Prenatal  development  was  unaffected  in  rats  and  rabbits.  In  rats, 
postnatal  development  including  morphological,  behavioural  and  reproductive  endpoints  was 
unaffected.  In  addition  to  these  studies,  a literature  search  on  available  reports  on  the  use  of  ERT  in 
pregnant  women  with  type  1  Gaucher  disease.  It  appears  that  ERT  in  pregnant  women  is  associated 
with marginal risks and an overall benefit regarding the outcome of pregnancy. There is no reason to 
believe that velaglucerase alfa should be different in this aspect.   
2.3.4.6. 
 Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic  analyses  were  conducted  during  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  with  monkey  and  the 
results are discussed in the relevant section on repeat-dose toxicity. 
2.3.4.7. 
 Local Tolerance  
Local  tolerance  was  studies  in  conjunction  with  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  and  the  absence  of 
specific studies is acceptable. Mild to moderate reactions were seen at the injection sites, particularly 
in the monkeys (see section 3.3.4.2). 
2.3.4.8. 
 Other toxicity studies 
Antibodies  against  velaglucerase  alfa  were  detected  in  all  groups  dosed  with  the  tested  substance  in 
the  3-  and  6-month  rat  studies  and  in  the  monkey  study,  which  was  anticipated  since  velaglucerase 
alfa is a protein of human origin. The antibody response was not correlated with clinical observations.

No  additional  studies  on  immunotoxicity,  dependence  or  metabolites  were  conducted  and  this  is 
considered  acceptable.  However,  the  claim  that  impurity  qualification  studies  were  not  relevant  was 
not supported by the CHMP. Impurity might be relevant and in the need of qualification regardless of 
the type of product. Although no direct effects of a specific impurity derived from cell-culture medium 
are  anticipated,  the  CHMP  requested  further  information  on  this  issue.  It  is  agreed  that  the  levels  of 
this cell-culture medium derived impurity in velaglucerase alfa are low and not connected to any risks. 
However,  the  concern  of  immunogenicity  was  not  covered  sufficiently,  since  in  some  cases  the 
amounts  of  velaglucerase  alfa  could  trigger  an  immune  reaction.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  requested  a 
specific follow-up measure to examine the antibodies of this impurity in serum of patients treated with 
velaglucerase alfa for some time.  
A  specific  non-GLP  study  SHGT-1U0-06-017  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  potential  differences  in 
the  response  following  IV  bolus  administration  of  velaglucerase  alfa  with  and  without  antihistamine 
diphenhydramine  (DPH)  pre-treatment.  Swollen  limbs,  paws  and  swollen  faces  were  observed  in  all 
treatment groups. Mode of administration and substance concentration seems to have a small impact 
on  this  reaction.  DPH  treatment  reduces  the  incidence  of  swelling  partially.  Velaglucerase  alfa 
administration resulted in a marked histamine release after 15 min, which could be diminished by DPH 
treatment.  Complement  activation  was  unaffected  in  all  groups.  This  study  was  performed  with  a 
slightly different formulation compared to the repeated dose toxicity studies (sorbitol was replaced by 
sucrose).  However,  apart  from  the  fact  that  histamine  concentration  in  the  blood  was  increased  and 
could  not  been  reproduced  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  TKT-1U-00-06,  no  further  unexpected 
findings were reported.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Environmental Risk Assessment has not been performed. The CHMP agreed that an ERA is unnecessary 
for this type of product. Velaglucerase alfa is a glycoprotein expressed as a single polypeptide chain of 
amino  acids  and  the  excipients  used  to  formulate  the  drug  product  are  common  pharmaceutical 
ingredients that pose no threat to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Velaglucerase alfa was shown in a relevant animal model to effectively counteract two pathognomonic 
characteristics of non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease, elevated glucocerebroside levels in the liver and 
spleen, and appearance of Gaucher cells in the liver. The effects of velaglucerase alfa observed in this 
model  were  overall  indistinguishable  from  the  effects  of  the  medicinal  product  imiglucerase. 
Velagucerase  differs  from  imiglucerase  in  the  identity  of  the  antepenultimate  amino  acid  and  in  the 
identity of the glycosyl side chains only. No further pharmacodynamic or safety pharmacology studies 
were  performed.  In  a  6-month  toxicity  study  in  monkeys  no  concerns  in  regard  to  cardiovascular, 
respiratory  or  CNS  safety  issues  were  identified.  Due  to  the  clinical  and  preclinical  experience  with 
imiglucerase no further pharmacodynamic or safety pharmacology studies are considered necessary. 
After i.v. administration of a single dose of velaglucerase alfa to rats the serum elimination followed 1st 
order kinetics at all doses tested. In dogs, 1st order kinetics was observed at the low dose however, at 
the high dose, such kinetics was observed at 20 minutes post administration. After i.v. administration 
of repeated doses every other week to Rhesus monkeys, serum elimination followed 1st order kinetics 
at all doses tested. Whereas Cmax was dose proportional, AUC increased more than dose-proportional in 
all three species. 
Distribution  studies  in  rats  using  radiolabelled  velaglucerase  alfa  at  a  lower  dose  indicate  that 
velaglucerase alfa is initially distributed to the liver with 70% of the total administered dose, but only 
6%  of  the  radioactivity  is  found  in  the  blood.  Other  tissues  with  high  initial  125I-velaglucerase  alfa 
concentrations at this dose are lungs, spleen bone marrow and kidneys. If a 10-times higher dose (10 
mg/kg) is administered, the distribution to liver is reduced from 70% to 24 %, whereas that in blood is 
increased  from  6%  to  38%.  This  pharmacokinetic  behaviour  indicates  a  saturation  of  an  uptake 
mechanism, which is in agreement with saturation of the assumed mannose-receptor mediated uptake 
mechanism. Serum half-life of velaglucerase alfa was determined to be in the range of minutes (based 
on determination of enzymatic activity); at higher doses reaching a maximum of 11 minutes. Plasma 
Assessment report

pharmacokinetics appears to be comparable between velaglucerase alfa and imiglucerase. Due to the 
protein  nature  of  velaglucerase  alfa  accumulation  of  the  active  substance  in  humans  after  an  i.v. 
administration every other week is not expected to occur.  
Toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  rats,  rabbits  and  monkeys.  The  choice  of  species  was  considered 
acceptable for this biotechnology derived product. All studies were GLP compliant with the exception of 
one additional study on histamine release and complement activation in rats (SHG-1U0-006-017). The 
single dose toxicity study in rats revealed no specific toxicity up to the highest dose tested 20 mg/kg 
bodyweight.  In  general,  administration  of  up  to  20  mg  /kg  b.w.  velaglucerase  alfa  resulted  in  no 
treatment  related  effects  with  the  exception  of  application  traumata  which  are  of  no  toxicological 
concern.  The  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in rats  and  monkeys  for  up  to  6  months 
duration  and  an  additional  recovery  period.  Transient  swelling  of  paws/limbs  and  muzzle  in  the  rat 
studies were considered to be rat specific and of no clinical relevance. Some animals formed antibody 
against the tested substance. The observed decrease in the serum urea nitrogen concentration and an 
increase  in  serum  albumin  concentration  in  male  treatment  groups  may  indicate  a  possible  effect  on 
the glomerular filtration rate, but no structural changes of the kidney histology were reported and thus, 
no  significant  kidney  damage  is  expected.    The  differences  in  haematology  and  clinical  biochemistry 
parameters  between  treated  and  control  groups  were  considered  to  be  incidental  and  with  no 
toxicological implication.  
In  the  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  monkeys,  no  test  substance  related  changes  except  antibody 
formation in the high dose group have been detected. Since velaglucerase alfa is a protein of human 
origin this is an anticipated effect and considered to be not adverse. Development of a cell-based assay 
to evaluate the potential hindrance of cellular uptake by neutralising anti-drug antibodies was agreed 
as a follow-up measure. 
Estimations  of  safety  factors  on  a  mg/kg  b.w.  is  provided  basis  as  well  as  based  on  the  surface  area 
(mg/m2).  The  safety  margins  calculated  for  the  HED  are  with  rather  low,  however,  no  relevant  toxic 
effects  could  be  detected  within  the  toxicity  studies  and  the  low  safety  margin  is  considered 
acceptable.  In  the  reproductive  toxicity  studies  treatment  with  velaglucerase  alfa  induced  swelling  in 
the  face  and/or  paws  in  rats,  which  was  transient  and  without  any  clinical  relevance  for  humans. 
Treatment  with  velaglucerase  alfa  twice  weekly  slightly  reduced  male  fertility  and  fecundity  at  the 
highest  dose  tested  but  had  no  effect  on  female  reproductive  capacity.  Prenatal  development  was 
unaffected  in  rats  and  rabbits.  Although  no  additional  studies  on  immunotoxicity  studies  were 
conducted, further evaluation of immunological response relating to the supplement to the cell culture 
medium was considered necessary by the CHMP and a specific Follow-up measure was agreed. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  toxicological  program  is  considered  adequate  to  support  the  marketing  authorisation  application 
for  velaglucerase  alfa  and  the  concerns  identified  by  the  CHMP  during  its  evaluation  are  considered 
resolved. Although no post-authorisation follow up measures related to non-clinical development were 
considered  necessary,  the  CHMP  requested  several  clinical  follow-up  measures  for  which  the  reason 
partially lies with the non-clinical findings. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This  is  an  application  for  velaglucerase  alfa  in  the  frame  of  the  centralised  procedure  according  to 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The application is submitted in accordance with Article 8(3) of the above 
mentioned  regulation  and  with  Article  3(1)  of  the  Directive  2001/83/EC.  A  full  dossier  has  been 
submitted.  
Data from four finalised clinical trials (TKT025, TKT032, TKT034, HGT-GCB-039) and from an ongoing 
extension study TKT025EXT in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease have been provided. Patients with 
type 2 or type 3 Gaucher disease were excluded from the current clinical programme.  For the ongoing 
extension study TKT025EXT a safety summary was submitted and for TKT034 only a preliminary CSR 
Assessment report

was  available  at  the  time  of  submission.  The  Phase  I/II  study  TKT025  and  the  Phase  III  studies 
TKT032 and HGT-GCB-039 were conducted in treatment-naïve patients. The Phase II/III study TKT034 
enrolled patients who transitioned from treatment with imiglucerase. 
There are two ongoing clinical trials for which no data have been provided (HGT-GCB-044, HGT-GCB-
058).  
Velaglucerase alfa was granted an orphan designation by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products 
in March 2010. The European Commission decision was received on 9 June 2010. 
An application for the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) was submitted to the EMA and the PDCO. The 
EMA issued a decision on the PIP agreement dated 27 November 2009 granting a deferral and a waiver 
for velaglucerase alfa (please see section 1.1.2 for further details). 
An accelerated review according to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 has been accepted 
by CHMP on 22 October 2009 on the grounds of public health interest. 
Scientific  advice  on  aspects  concerning  the  clinical  development  was  received  from  the  CHMP  in  July 
2006.  An  active  comparator  clinical  trial  with  imiglucerase  was  conducted.  Analyses  of  response 
categories as requested in the CHMP scientific advice were included. However, these analyses are not 
included  in  the  study  protocol,  or in  the  protocol  amendments.  The  CHMP  requested  a  clarification  of 
this  issue  and  although  the  opinion  that  these  analyses  by  response  categories  did  not  require  an 
amendment of the study protocol is not agreed, it is acknowledged that this omission did not have an 
influence on the validity of the data provided. 
2.4.2.  GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Studies  have  been  conducted  in  Argentina,  India,  Israel,  Paraguay,  Russia,  Serbia,  South  Korea, 
Tunisia, Poland, UK, and USA. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials 
conducted  outside  the  community  were  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ethical  standards  of 
Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics data are derived from studies TKT025, TKT032, and TKT025EXT.  
In study TKT025 twelve patients with type 1 Gaucher disease aged 19-70 years were enrolled into two 
cohorts. In the initial dose-escalating cohort 3 patients received 1-hour infusions of velaglucerase alfa 
15 U/kg  at  week  1,  30 U/kg  at  week  3,  and  60 U/kg  EOW  for  weeks  5-39  (end  of  study).  Nine 
additional  patients  in  the  second  cohort  received  60 U/kg  EOW  for  weeks  1-39.  In  study  TKT032, 
paediatric (≥ 2 years old) and adult patients (age range 4-62 years) were randomised to receive either 
45 or 60 U/kg velaglucerase alfa EOW for 51 weeks.

Overall,  the  analytical  methods  and  statistical  analyses  used  in  these  trials  are  considered  adequate. 
The information provided on the request of CHMP in order to clarify calculation of LOQ determined by 
velaglucerase alfa enzymatic activity assay, data on immunogenicity testing methods or immunoassays 
supplemental  information  was  considered  satisfactory.  In  addition,  a  follow  up  measure  to  develop  a 
new  assay  for  the  potential  neutralising  activity  of  antibodies  in  terms  of  velaglucerase  alfa  or 
imiglucerase cellular uptake was agreed. 
2.4.3.1. 
 Absorption  
Velaglucerase alfa is intended for intravenous administration. 
2.4.3.2. 
 Distribution 
Velaglucerase  alfa  serum  concentrations  rose  rapidly  for  the  first  20 min  of  the  1 h  infusion  before 
levelling  off  at  all  dose  levels.  Cmax  was  typically  attained  between  40  to  60  min.  At  end  of  infusion 
serum concentrations fell rapidly in a mono- or biphasic fashion, with mean t1/2 from 5 to 12 min for 
the 15, 30, 45 and 60 U/kg doses. 
2.4.3.3. 
 Elimination 
For subjects in the 60 U/kg cohort in study TKT025 mean serum CL changed from 12.6 mL/min/kg at 
week  1  to  5.6 mL/min/kg  at  Week  37/39,  and  6.5 mL/min/kg  at  week  65  in  TKT025EXT.  Mean  Vss 
changed from 17.5% at Week 1 to 5.4% at Week 37/39 and 8.3% at week 65. In study TKT032 mean 
CL  and  Vss  were  similar  for  45  and  60 U/kg  between  week  1  and  week  37  (mean  CL  6.7  to 
7.6 mL/min/kg,  mean  Vss  8.2%  to  10.8%).  Mean  disposition  t1/2  ranged  from  6.8  to  9.8  min  in 
TKT025 and TKT025EXT compared to 11.4 to 12.4 min in TKT032.

The  rapid  clearance  from  serum  is  consistent  with  uptake  of  velaglucerase  alfa  into  macrophages  via 
mannose receptors. Velaglucerase alfa is similar to naturally occurring β-glucocerebrosidase and thus it 
is  unlikely  that  plasma  protein  binding  and  blood  cell  distribution  patterns  would  differ  from  subjects 
with normal β-glucocerebrosidase levels. Studies in animals have demonstrated that the vast majority 
of velaglucerase alfa is eliminated from the systemic circulation independent of species within 2 to 3 h 
of  dosing.  Studies  examining  plasma  protein  binding  and  blood  cell  distribution  have  thus  not  been 
performed.  
2.4.3.4. 
 Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In  the  dose  escalating  cohort  in  study  TKT025,  velaglucerase  alfa  Cmax  and  AUC  increased 
approximately  in  a  linear  manner  for  2  patients  with  pharmacokinetic  evaluation  at  15,  30,  and 
60 U/kg compared to study TKT032 where Cmax and AUC increased slightly more than proportional to 
dose between 45 U/kg and 60 U/kg groups. Overall, velaglucerase alfa exhibited approximately linear 
dose  proportionality  over  the  dose  range  of  15  to  60 U/kg.  Since  mean  velaglucerase  alfa 
pharmacokinetics  parameters  were  similar  between  Week  1  and  Week  37  and  t1/2  is  considerably 
shorter than the dosing interval, velaglucerase alfa is not expected to accumulate. 
2.4.3.5. 
 Special populations 
Pharmacokinetics  in  special  populations  impaired  renal  or  hepatic  function,  race,  weight  and  elderly 
have not been investigated. Pharmacokinetic data are available in the age range 6 to 62 years old in 
subjects  receiving  45  U/kg  and  4  to  42  years  old  in  subjects  receiving  60  U/kg  in  study  TKT032.  No 
apparent  pharmacokinetic  differences  between  male  and  female  patients  have  been  identified.  While 
there  was  no  trend  for  AUC  or  clearance  changes  with  increasing  age  with  45 U/kg,  in  the  60 U/kg 
group a trend for lower AUC and higher clearance in patients below 10 years compared to adults was 
seen.  However,  the  range  of  clearance  values  in  children  is  contained  within  the  range  of  values  in 
adults and it is considered unlikely that a difference in systemic clearance between children and adults 
would significantly alter overall tissue bio-distribution. Thus data do not indicate a need for differences 
in  the  weight-normalised  dose  based  on  age.  The  influence  of  weight  on  velaglucerase  alfa 
pharmacokinetics has not been  evaluated. However, as velaglucerase alfa is an enzyme administered 
intravenously and with a low volume of distribution, dosing by weight is appropriate.  
2.4.3.6. 
 Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No specific drug-interaction studies have been performed. As with other enzyme replacement therapies, 
drug-drug interactions are not expected. 
2.4.3.7. 
 Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
No pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials have been conducted. 
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics  of  velaglucerase  alfa  has  been  evaluated  in  animals  and  no  separate  studies  of 
pharmacodynamics  in  man  have  been  provided.  However,  assessment  of  efficacy  is  based  on 
pharmacodynamic parameters: all clinical studies evaluated effects of velaglucerase alfa on surrogate 
endpoints  platelet  count  and  haemoglobin,  as  well  as  spleen  and  liver  organ  volumes.  No  clinical 
pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers.

2.4.4.1. 
 Mechanism of action 
The  mechanism  of  action  is  well  established.  Velaglucerase  alfa  is  a  human  glucocerebrosidase 
intended as long-term ERT for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease to supplement or replace deficient 
beta-glucocerebrosidase 
the  amount  of  accumulated 
thus, 
glucocerebroside.  To  facilitate  uptake  by  phagocytic  cells  via  mannose  receptors,  velaglucerase  alfa 
contains  mannose-type-linked  glycans.  Binding  of  velaglucerase  alfa  to  isolated  recombinant  human 
mannose receptor has been investigated in preclinical studies and the available preclinical data as well 
as  experience  with  alglucerase  and  imiglucerase  provide  an  adequate  rational  for  the  clinical 
development.

 Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology has been investigated in a series of nonclinical studies comparing biological and 
biochemical  effects  of  velaglucerase  alfa    and  imiglucerase  in  a  mouse  model  of  Gaucher  disease. 
Results show that both velaglucerase alfa  and imiglucerase comparably reduce the number of Gaucher 
cells.  No  clinical  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  performed,  which  is  considered  acceptable  for 
this type of product. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic data have been derived from evaluations of clinical trials with type 1 Gaucher disease 
patients and this is considered acceptable. Velaglucerase alfa demonstrated a rapid increase in serum 
concentration  during  infusion  with  Cmax  of  about  45 min  and  fast  clearance  with  t1/2  of  about  12 min. 
Pharmacokinetic  characteristics  are  in  agreement  with  a  mannose  receptor  mediated  uptake 
mechanism.  In  study  TKT032  the  mean  clearance  and  Vss  were  similar  for  45  and  60 U/kg  dose 
between  Week  1  and  Week  37.  These  results  indicate  that  pharmacokinetics  is  not  time  dependent. 
Clinical  trials  examining  plasma  protein  binding  and  blood  cell  distribution  patterns  have  not  been 
performed which is considered acceptable. No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. 
Data  in  special  populations  are  limited  to  age,  excluding  elderly,  and  gender.  Data  do  not  indicate  a 
need for differences in the weight-normalised dose based on either gender or age. 
Velaglucerase  alfa  appears  to  induce  antibodies  including  neutralising  antibodies.  This  is  adequately 
reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Since  the  influence  of  anti-velaglucerase  alfa  antibodies  on  pharmacokinetics 
has  not  been  assessed,  adequate  surveillance  of  antibody 
formation  via  monitoring  the 
pharmacokinetic profile of antibody positive patients has been agreed. 
Velaglucerase  alfa  was  shown  to  effectively  counteract  elevated  glucocerebroside  levels  in  liver  and 
spleen,  and  appearance  of  Gaucher  cells  in  the  liver  assessment  of  efficacy  is  based  on 
pharmacodynamic  parameters  of  platelet  count  and  haemoglobin,  as  well  as  spleen  and  liver  organ 
volumes.  No  clinical  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers.  Available 
preclinical  data  as  well  as  experience  with  alglucerase  and  imiglucerase  are  considered  to  provide  an 
adequate rational for the clinical development. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  submitted  together  with  the  experience  with  alglucerase  and 
imiglucerase are considered adequate to support the marketing authorisation and use of velaglucerase 
alfa. 
2.4.7.  Clinical efficacy  
2.4.7.1. 
 Dose response study 
Dose  selection  was  based  on  results  from  preclinical  studies  in  animals.  Clinical  and  laboratory 
assessments  of  safety  and  tolerability,  as  well  as  of  the  clinical  activity  of  velaglucerase  alfa  were 
performed.  The  obtained  results  support  doses  15,  30,  and  60 U/kg  used  in  the  Phase  I/II  study 
TKT025.  
The  NOAEL  from  the  animal  toxicology  studies  were  ≥23 mg/kg  (single  acute  dose  study)  and 
≥17 mg/kg  (repeat  dose  study)  with  the  highest  doses  evaluated.  Repeat  dose  NOAEL  provided  a 
Assessment report

safety  margin  of  approximately  45-fold  and  11-fold  for  the  15 U/kg  and  60 U/kg  doses,  respectively. 
The 60 U/kg dose for study TKT032 was selected based on the safety and clinical activity experience in 
TKT025 and during the first 3 months of the ongoing open-label extension study TKT025EXT.  
No further specific dose-response studies have been conducted. Although TKT032 included two doses 
of  velaglucerase  alfa,  these  have  not  been  formally  compared  within  this  trial;  no  direct  statistical 
comparison of the 45 and 60 U/kg dose groups was conducted. Furthermore, no dose comparisons of 
the  4  nominal  dosage  groups  of  15,  30,  45,  and  60 U/kg  in  study  TKT034  were  presented  in  the 
dossier.  However,  data  from  study  TKT025  clearly  indicate  that  60 U/kg  dose  is  effective,  and  the 
results are consistent across both primary and secondary endpoints. In study TKT032  both doses, 45 
and  60 U/kg  appear  to  be  effective  with  an  improved  efficacy  for  the  60  U/kg  dose.  Results  were 
consistent  for  all  endpoints  and  in  line  with  the  findings  in  study  TKT025.  Further  information  on  the 
appropriate maintenance dose is expected to be derived from the ongoing open-label extension study 
TKT025EXT. Overall, although information from clinical trials is limited, the rational and data provided 
for dose selection are considered acceptable. 
2.4.7.2. 
 Main study(ies)  
In the clinical development programme for velaglucerase alfa, four studies have been completed: 
TKT025, TKT032, HGT-GCB-039, and TKT034.  
Phase  I/II  study  TKT025  and  Phase  III  studies  TKT032  and  HGT-GCB-039  were  conducted  in 
treatment-naïve  patients.  The  Phase  II/III  study  TKT034  enrolled  patients  who  transitioned  from 
treatment with imiglucerase. Two extension studies are ongoing: TKT025EXT (patients rolled over from 
TKT025), and HGT-GCB-044 (patients rolled over from TKT032, TKT034, and HGT-GCB-039). 
Trial  HGT-GCB-039  is  considered  the  pivotal  since  it  is  the  only  study  comparing  velaglucerase  alfa 
with a comparator, imiglucerase. No placebo controlled data have been provided, which is acceptable 
for the patient population investigated. Study TKT032, although testing two doses of velaglucerase alfa, 
45  U/kg  and  60  U/kg  and  labelled  as  a  controlled  trial,  was  not  designed  to  formally  compare  these 
two doses and thus, is assessed as an uncontrolled trial. 
Pivotal  study  HGT-GCB-039  title:  A  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-Blind,  Parallel-Group  Study  of 
Gene-Activated® Human Glucocerebrosidase (GA-GCB) Enzyme Replacement Therapy Compared With 
Imiglucerase  in  Patients  With  Type  I  Gaucher  Disease.  This  was  a  multi-centre,  Phase  III,  non-
inferiority,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group  study  comparing  efficacy  and  safety  of 
velaglucerase alfa to imiglucerase (Cerezyme), for duration of 9 months. 
The majority of the clinical efficacy chapter refers to the conduct and results of the pivotal study HGT-
GCB-039  and  data  from  other  studies  are  quoted  as  appropriate.  Further  details  of  the  supportive 
studies are given in section 3.4.7.5. 
2.4.7.2.1. 
 Methods 
2.4.7.2.1.1.  Study Participants  
In  study  HGT-GCB-039,  patients  were  to  be  treatment-naïve  (no  therapy  ≥12  months  prior  to  study 
entry) with a documented diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease and ≥2 years of age. They had to have 
Hgb  below  LLN  for  age  and  gender  and  at  least  one  of  the  following  criteria:  at  least  moderate 
splenomegaly  by  palpation  (2  to  3  cm  below  left  costal  margin),  thrombocytopenia  (platelet  count 
≤120 x 103/mm3), or a palpable enlarged liver. 
Main  exclusion  criteria  were  presence  of  imiglucerase  or  velaglucerase  alfa  antibodies  at  screening, 
history of anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction to imiglucerase or velaglucerase alfa, requirement for 
routine  pre-medication  to  manage  infusion  related  reactions  to  imiglucerase  or  velaglucerase  alfa, 
receiving  red  blood  cell  growth  factor  (e.g.  erythropoietin),  receiving  chronic  systemic  corticosteroids 
within last 6 months, or HIV or active hepatitis B or C infection. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
acceptable to the CHMP.  
Forty-two patients were screened, 7 (17%) were not eligible, 35 were randomised, and 34 received at 
least one dose; 17 velaglucerase alfa and 17 imiglucerase. One patient in the velaglucerase alfa group 
discontinued after 17 weeks of treatment as she was lost to follow-up following an SAE, unrelated to 
treatment.  One  patient  in  the  imiglucerase  treatment  group  withdrew  consent  after  23  weeks  of 
treatment due to multiple infusion-related reactions. A second patient randomized to imiglucerase was

also considered discontinued. This patient was in fact randomized in error before the confirmation of all 
eligibility criteria.  
2.4.7.2.1.2.  Treatments 
In study HGT-GCB-039, treatment of 60 U/kg was administered in double-blind fashion as continuous 
i.v. infusion over 60 min every other week (EOW) (±3 d) for 39 weeks (20 infusions). Dose was based 
on  patient  body  weight  at  baseline;  a  change  of  ≥5%  from  baseline  or  the  most  recent  recorded 
measurement (weeks 13 or 25) required re-calculation.

All doses were administered by a 60-minute IV infusion. 
The first patient dosed with velaglucerase alfa in the dose-escalation phase received two 15- U/kg doses and then one 30- U/kg escalation dose.  The next 2 
patients enrolled received one 15 U/kg dose and then one 30- U/kg escalation dose.  Based on acceptable safety evaluations, all 3 patients in the 
dose-escalation cohort had their doses increased to 60 U/kg.  The remaining 9 patients were infused at 60 U/kg of velaglucerase alfa EOW 
throughout the 9-month study.   
No 
No 
Patients were treated with 60 U/kg until they had completed at least 12 months of dosing at 60 U/kg inclusive of TKT025.  All patients were subsequently 
titrated down to a maintenance dose of 30 U/kg. 
Patient’s velaglucerase alfa dose was matched to their dose of imiglucerase for the 6 months prior to study entry. 
Seven patients have received one or more infusions in the home. 
2.4.7.2.1.3.  Objectives 
The  primary  objective  in  study  HGT-GCB-039  was  to  compare  the  effects  of  velaglucerase  alfa  and 
imiglucerase on haemoglobin. Secondary objectives included effect comparison of platelet count, liver 
and spleen volume, and plasma chitotriosidase and CCL18 levels. Safety evaluations included rates of 
antibody  formation  and  neutralising  antibody  activity,  rates  of  infusion-related  adverse  events  (AEs), 
and proportion of patients requiring premedication to manage infusion-related AEs. 
2.4.7.2.1.4.  Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  study  HGT-GCB-039  was  the  difference  in  Hgb  mean  change  from 
baseline to week 41 between groups. Secondary endpoints in this study included differences in mean 
and  percent  changes  from  baseline  in  platelet  count,  liver  and  spleen  volumes  measured  by  MRI, 
plasma  chitotriosidase  activity,  plasma  CCL18  levels,  and  in  time  to  response  for  Hgb  ≥1 g/dL  from 
baseline. 
There  were  several  efficacy  measures  common  to  all  studies  in  the  velaglucerase  alfa  clinical 
programme:  changes  in  haemoglobin  concentration,  changes  in  platelet  count,  and  changes  in 
normalized  liver  volume  measured  by  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  changes  in  normalized 
spleen  volume  measured  by  MRI,  changes  in  plasma  chitotriosidase  level,  and  changes  in  plasma 
chemokine  (C-C  motif)  ligand  18  (CCL18)  level.  Only  changes  in  haemoglobin  concentration  and 
platelet count are reported for the TKT034 study. Other secondary or tertiary efficacy measures used 
at  least  in  one  study  were:  pulmonary  function,  bone  abnormalities,  bone  density,  bone  marrow, 
growth  velocity,  skeletal  growth,  Tanner  staging,  bone  disease,  and  overall  quality  of  life  (QoL),  as 
measured  by  the  Short  Form-36  (SF-36)  for  patients  ≥18  years-old  and  the  Childhood  Health 
Questionnaire  (CHQ,  PF50)  for  patients  5  to  17  years-old.  The  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  are 
adequate and in line with the scientific advice given by the CHMP.

Summary of endpoints for all reported studies 
2.4.7.2.1.5.  Sample size 
With a sample size in each treatment group of 14 (for a total of 28 patients overall) in study HGT-GCB-
039, a two-group, 0.025 one-sided t test would have an 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that 
the  difference  in  means  for  haemoglobin  is  less  than  −1  g/dL  in  favour  of  the  alternative  hypothesis 
that the difference in means is greater than −1 g/dL, assuming that the expected difference in means 
is 0, and the common standard deviation is 0.90. A 15% dropout was assumed, therefore a total of 32 
patients (16 patients per treatment arm) were to be enrolled into the study. The CHMP concluded that 
the sample size calculation is adequate considering the rarity of the disease investigated. 
2.4.7.2.1.6.  Randomisation 
Eligible  patients  were  enrolled  and  randomly  allocated  according  to  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  either 
velaglucerase  alfa  60  U/kg  every  other  week  or  imiglucerase  60  U/kg  every  other  week.  A  covariate 
adaptive  randomization  algorithm  was  used  to  balance  age  at  randomization  (2  to  17  years  vs  ≥18 
years),  haemoglobin  concentration  (<8  g/dL  vs  ≥8  g/dL),  and  splenectomy  status  between  the  two 
treatment groups. Randomization was performed centrally by a contract research organization and this 
strategy was considered adequate. 
2.4.7.2.1.7.  Blinding (masking) 
Patients,  investigators,  site  personnel  (except  the  clinical  site’s  pharmacist  and  one  clinical  research 
associate  at  each  site)  and  the  sponsor’s  personnel  who  had  direct  responsibility  for  monitoring  the 
sites  were  blinded  throughout  the  study.  All images  were  read by  a  single independent  reviewer  who 
remained blinded to the study medication and the order in which the images were taken. Unblinding of 
a patient’s treatment was restricted to emergency situations and was only done to facilitate care of a 
patient. Further details on the procedures for breaking the blind were described in the study protocol.

2.4.7.2.1.8.  Statistical methods 
For the primary endpoint a one-sided 97.5% CI was used to test the null hypothesis that the treatment 
difference  is  less  than  or  equal  to  the  lower  equivalence  margin  in  haemoglobin  (-1 g/dL).  The  ITT 
population  was  used  for  primary  analysis,  followed  by  the  PP  population.  For  secondary  efficacy 
parameters, a linear mixed model was used to evaluate mean changes from baseline to week 41 and a 
95%  CI  was  computed  for  the  difference  in  mean  changes.  Estimates  of  mean  treatment  difference 
and corresponding 95% CI were adjusted for baseline age, splenectomy status except for normalised 
spleen  volume,  and  the  corresponding  parameter’s  baseline  value.  For  time  to  first  Hgb  response, 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were presented and a log-rank test was used to compare treatments. To 
minimise potential for inter-site bias Hgb, platelet count, chitotriosidase levels, and CCL18 levels were 
analysed  at  a  central  laboratory,  and  liver  and  spleen  volumes  were  analysed  at  a  central  imaging 
centre.  The  number  of  patients  per  country  was  not  considered  sufficient  for  assessing  efficacy 
parameters  and  no  formal  statistical  tests  were  performed  on  safety  parameters.  Statistical  methods 
are considered acceptable. The non-inferiority margin of 1 g/dL is considered adequate. 
2.4.7.2.2.  Results 
In study HGT-GCB-039, 42 patients were screened, 35 were randomised, and 34 received at least one 
dose. The majority of patients completed the study. Discontinuations were evenly distributed between 
the groups. Details on participant flow are given in the following table. 
Summary of Patient Disposition (HGT-GCB-039)  
2.4.7.2.2.1.  Recruitment 
The  study  was  conducted  at  a  total  of  11  sites  in  9  countries:  Paraguay,  Argentina,  Israel,  Tunisia, 
Russia, US, Spain, and UK with 1 site each, and India with 3 sites. First patient was recruited on Jan 
29th 2008 and the last patient completed this study on May 5th 2009. 
2.4.7.2.2.2.  Conduct of the study 
The  original  protocol  HGT-GCB-039  was  issued  on  25  January  2007.  There  were  2  protocol 
amendments.  The  first  amendment  was  done  before  recruitment  started.  The  second  amendment, 
Assessment report  
Page 32/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dated  June  10th  2008,  included  a  change  in  the  inclusion  criteria  defining  Gaucher-disease-related 
anaemia,  which  was  altered  by  removing  the  definition  of  “being  at  least  0.5  g/dL”  below  the  lower 
limit  of  normal  for  age  and  gender.  These  protocol  amendments  would  not  affect  the  outcome  of  the 
study  in  a  negative  way.  The  change  in  the  haemoglobin inclusion  criterion  would  equally  affect  both 
treatment arms and this would only attenuate the effect of treatment. 
Protocol violations/deviations 
No  patient in  the  study  had  a  protocol  deviation  that  met  the  definition  of  a  protocol  violation,  which 
was  defined  as  a  violation  of  admission  (inclusion/exclusion)  criteria  (ie,  eligibility  violation), 
occurrence  of  a  treatment  dispensing  error  or  a  prohibited  medication  during  study.  Seven  patients 
were allowed to enrol into the study with waivers to deviations from the inclusion/exclusion criteria. All 
seven exemptions were for haemoglobin concentrations at baseline that were above the threshold (0.5 
g/dL below the lower limit of normal for age and gender) for study entry. These patients were allowed 
into  the  study  with  the  knowledge  that  protocol  amendment  2  would  change  the  relevant  inclusion 
criterion. The seven waivered patients are balanced between the 2 treatment groups; 4 patients were 
randomized to the velaglucerase alfa group and 3 to the imiglucerase group. These patients were not 
appreciably  different  from  the  other  patients,  participating  in  the  study,  6  of  7  (85.7%)  patients 
completed the study. It is reasonable to conclude that the inclusion of these patients in the study did 
not bias the study results or conclusions. 
2.4.7.2.2.3.  Baseline data 
In  study  HGT-GCB-039,  73.5%  of  patients  were  adults.  Number  of  paediatric  patients  was  similar  in 
both groups (4 children - velaglucerase alfa, 5 children - imiglucerase) as was the splenectomy status 
(58.8%  each).  No  patient  had  a  screening  Hgb  <8  g/dL.  Median  modified  platelet  count  at  baseline 
was  within  normal  range  (172.0  x  103  velaglucerase  alfa,  188  x  103  imiglucerase).  Groups  were 
balanced  with  respect  to  gender,  medical  history  and  concomitant  medications  and  therapy.  16/17 
(94.1%) of patients on velaglucerase alfa and 15/17 (88.2%) on imiglucerase had not been previously 
treated. Time from diagnosis to first treatment ranged from 0.1 years to 18.7 years on velaglucerase 
alfa  and  0.1  to  51.2  years  on  imiglucerase.  Baseline  demographic  data,  medical  history  and 
concomitant medication did not differ significantly between groups.

Although  groups  were  balanced  for  age  groups  of  paediatric  and  adult  patients,  there  was  a 
considerable  imbalance  within  the  paediatric  group  with  none  of  the  4  children  in  the  2-4  years 
subgroup for velaglucerase alfa, compared to 4 of 5 on imiglucerase. 
2.4.7.2.2.4.  Numbers analysed 
Forty-two patients were screened, 7 (17%) were not eligible, 35 were randomised, and 34 received at 
least  one  dose.  One  patient  on  velaglucerase  alfa  discontinued  after  17  weeks  of  treatment  due  to  a 
SAE  of  convulsion,  unrelated  to  treatment.  One  patient  in  the  imiglucerase  group  withdrew  consent 
after  23  weeks  of  treatment  due  to  multiple  infusion-related  reactions;  the  patient  had  developed 
antibodies  to  both  imiglucerase  and  velaglucerase  alfa  after  13  weeks.  A  second  patient  on 
imiglucerase  was  considered  discontinued  since  he  was  found  to  have  antibodies  to  imiglucerase  and 
was  terminated  from  the  study  by  the  investigator  prior  to  first  infusion  and  thus  not  included  in  the 
safety  population.  The  ITT  population  included  17  patients  per  group.  2  patients  in  each  group  were 
excluded for the PP analysis; 2 patients, 1 per group, had discontinued without Week 41 assessment, 2 
patients,  1  per  group,  had  not  received  ≥80%  of  scheduled  infusions,  and  1  patient  on  imiglucerase 
did not receive at least one dose.

2.4.7.2.2.5.  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Haemoglobin 
For the ITT population mean absolute changes were 1.624 g/dL for velaglucerase alfa and 1.488 g/dL 
for imiglucerase. The estimated mean treatment difference was 0.135 g/dL with the lower bound of the 
one-sided 97.5% CI of -0.596 g/dL. Results were consistent with the PP population. Thus, results met 
the predefined non-inferiority criteria. Response was similar between treatment groups for subgroups 
paediatric  (age  2  to  17  years),  adult  (age  ≥18  years),  gender,  and  splenectomy  status.  The  median 
baseline  Hgb  was  11.4 g/dL  in  the  velaglucerase  alfa  and  10.6 g/dL  in  the  imiglucerase  group.  This 
difference between groups remained during the entire study.

Mean  changes  from  baseline  in  Hgb  were  comparable  between  velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase 
treatment  groups  and  the  predefined  primary  endpoint  was  met.  However,  there  was  a  0.8 g/dL 
difference in median Hgb between groups at baseline, which was maintained throughout the study. The 
CHMP  requested  a  discussion  on  whether  the  difference  in  baseline  Hgb  indicates  clinically  relevant 
differences  in  disease  severity  between  groups  and  whether  this  difference  might  have  masked  a 
difference  in  Hgb  response  to  therapy.  An  adequate  discussion  on  these  findings  has  been  provided. 
Analysis  adjusting  for  the  baseline  haemoglobin  concentration  values  confirmed  the  primary  efficacy 
analysis.  The  baseline  difference  is  also  considered  to  be  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  efficacy  of 
velaglucerase  alfa  rather  than  imiglucerase  and  thus,  adding  re-assurance  to  the  assessment  of  the 
efficacy of velaglucerase alfa. 
Secondary endpoints 
Platelet Count 
Mean platelet counts increased with both treatments. Baseline values were higher in the imiglucerase 
compared to the velaglucerase alfa group (181.2 vs. 161.1 x 109/L); the difference was not considered 
clinically  meaningful.  The  difference  persisted  at  each  assessment  and  appeared  to  increase  in  the 
latter  half  of  the  study.  At  Week  41  the  unadjusted  mean  change  was  110.4 x 109/L  in  the 
velaglucerase alfa and 144.4 x 109/L in the imiglucerase group. The model-based estimated treatment 
difference in mean change at Week 41 was 38.71 x 109 cells/L, with a 95% CI of -88.42 to 10.99, and 
thus  not  statistically  significant.  The  difference  might  partially  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  all  four 
children  under  the  age  of  5  years,  3  with  spleen  and  1  splenectomised,  were  randomised  to 
imiglucerase  indicating  a  more  severe  course  of  disease;  children  with  more  severe  disease  are 
expected to have a better response to treatment. Post hoc analyses suggest that patients in the 2 - 4 
years  age  group  have  skewed  the  data;  those  three  not  splenectomised  had  large  spleens  and  low

platelet counts at baseline and appeared to have worse disease at the start of the study. Results of the 
post-hoc  analysis  suggest  that  there  is  no  relevant  difference  in  changes  in  platelet  count  between 
velaglucerase alfa and imiglucerase.

Liver Volume 
Mean  normalised  liver  volumes  were  4.44%  and  4.16%  of  body  weight  at  baseline  and  3.13%  and 
3.06%  at  Week  41  on  velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase,  respectively.  Corresponding  median 
normalised  liver  volumes  were  3.90%  and  4.00%  at  baseline  and  2.6%  and  3.0%  at  week  41, 
respectively.  Model-based  estimated  mean  treatment  difference  was  -0.07%  of  body  weight  with  a 
95% CI of -0.43 to 0.29. Thus, the mean change was comparable between groups and not statistically 
significant different. Change in liver volume is considered comparable between groups. 
Spleen Volume 
Twenty splenectomised patients, 10 per group, were excluded and thus results are based on 7 patients 
per  group.  Mean  normalised  spleen  volumes  were  2.53%  and  4.24%  of  body  weight  at  baseline  and 
1.19%  and  1.79%  of  body  weight  at  week  41  on  velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase,  respectively. 
Corresponding  median  normalised  values  were  1.90%  and  1.40%  of  body  weight  at  Baseline  and 
1.00%  and  0.90%  of  body  weight  at  Week  41.  Results  indicate  a  substantial  reduction  in  spleen 
volume during treatment. The model-based estimated mean treatment difference for the mean change 
was 0.08% of body weight with a 95% CI of -0.52 to 0.68. Although there is a considerable imbalance 
in mean spleen volume at baseline results indicate a comparable response on change in spleen volume 
between groups (see also section on platelet count). 
Plasma Chitotriosidase 
Chitotriosidase levels were measured in 21 patients, 11 on velaglucerase alfa and 10 on imiglucerase. 
Twelve  of  13  patients  in  whom  chitotriosidase  was  not  detected  had  a  24bp  duplication.  Baseline 
the  velaglucerase  alfa  and 
median  chitotriosidase 
50,076.9 nmol/mL/h  in  the  imiglucerase  group;  levels  decreased  during  treatment.  At  Week  41, 
unadjusted mean decrease was 34,711.9 nmol/mL/h on velaglucerase alfa and 35,109.5 nmol/mL/h on 
imiglucerase.  Using  a  linear  mixed  model  adjusting  for  Baseline  chitotriosidase  values,  splenectomy 
status and age at informed consent (2 to 17 vs. ≥18), the estimated mean treatment difference was -
703.6 nmol/mL/h  with  a  95%  CI  of  -11,762.3  to  10,355.1.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  effects  on 
plasma chitotriosidase values are comparable between groups. 
levels  were  45,534.2 nmol/mL/h 
in 
Plasma CCL18 
Median  Baseline  CCL18  levels  were  1,637.0 ng/mL  and  1,849.0 ng/mL  for  the  velaglucerase  alfa  and 
imiglucerase  groups,  respectively.  Levels  decreased  over  treatment;  Week  41  unadjusted  mean 
changes  were  -926.2 ng/mL  (-55.12%)  and  -1153.4 ng/mL  (-48.82%)  for  the  velaglucerase  alfa  and 
imiglucerase  groups,  respectively.  Using  a  linear  mixed  model  adjusting  for  Baseline  chitotriosidase 
values,  splenectomy  status  and  age  at  informed  consent  (2  to  17  vs.  ≥ 18),  the  estimated  mean 
treatment  difference  was  145.7 ng/mL  with  a  95%  CI  of  -186.6  to  480.0.  Effects  on  plasma  CCL18 
values are comparable between groups. 
Time to first Hgb response 
Time  to  first  Hgb  response,  defined  as  an  increase  of  ≥1 g/dL  from  Baseline,  was  similar  between 
groups  (log-rank  p-value = 0.8965).  2  patients,  1  per  group,  were  censored  due  to  study 
discontinuation  prior  to  reaching  a  first  Hgb  response  and  1  patient  on  velaglucerase  alfa    completed

the  study  without  achieving  a  ≥1 g/dL  change  from  Baseline  in  Hgb.  Time  to  first  Hgb  response  was 
comparable between groups. 
Tertiary endpoints 
Annualised growth velocity, difference in skeletal from chronological age, and Tanner stage in patients 
2 to 17 years 
Medians  for  annualised  growth  velocity  at  study  endpoint  were  7.7 cm/year  and  8.3 cm/year  for 
velaglucerase  alfa  (n=3)  and  imiglucerase  (n=5),  respectively.  Median  differences  between 
chronological  age  and  calculated  skeletal  age  at  Baseline  were  -2.00  (n=4)  and  -1.15  (n=4)  for 
velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase,  respectively.  Medians  at  study  endpoint  were  -0.90  (n=3)  and  -
2.10  (n=5),  respectively.  Of  the  four  paediatric  patients  in  the  velaglucerase  alfa    group,  2  patients 
were  Tanner  stage  1  at  Baseline,  1  of  these  remained  Stage  1  at  study  endpoint  and  the  other  had 
missing data; 1 patient was stage 3 at Baseline and stage 4 at study endpoint; 1 patient was at stage 
4 at both time points. All five paediatric patients in the imiglucerase group were Tanner stage 1 at both 
Baseline and Week 41. Mean and median annualised growth velocity was slightly higher in patients on 
imiglucerase.  However,  maximum  results  observed  with  imiglucerase  are  considerably  higher 
compared  to  velaglucerase  alfa  and  the  low  number  of  patients  per  group  does  not  allow  for  any 
definite  conclusion.  The  limited  data  on  difference  in  skeletal  from  chronological  age  and  the 
development  of  Tanner  stage  do  not  allow  for  a  meaningful  conclusion  on  the  comparison  between 
groups.  Analyses  of  annualised  growth  velocity  and  Tanner  stage  are  hampered  not  only  by  the  low 
absolute numbers, but also by the significant imbalance in age.  
Quality of life 
In  the  adult  group  results  of  the  analyses  of  the  SF36  questionnaire  showed  improvements  for  both 
groups  in  most  categories  investigated.  6  of  10  (60%)  patients  in  the  velaglucerase  alfa  and  7  of  9 
(78%)  patients  in  the  imiglucerase  group  reported  an  either  “much  better  now  than  1  year  ago”  or 
“somewhat  better  now  than  1  year  ago”  health.  In  the  group  of  children  5  to  17  years  old  only  1 
patient  per  group  completed  the  CHQ-PF50  questionnaire  at  Week  41;  both  reported  a  “somewhat 
better now than 1 year ago” health. For adults changes in QoL measurements appear to be comparable 
between groups. For younger patients data do not allow for any conclusion (1 patient per group only). 
Cytokines 
TNF-α,  IL-6,  IL1-β,  IL-8,  IL-13,  CD14,  and  GM-CSF  were  measured  at  Baseline,  Week  13,  Week  25, 
and at study endpoint. No consistent patterns were observed for these data. 
Other  exploratory  endpoints  included  measurements  of  bone  biomarkers  by  DXA  and  MRI  of  lumbar 
spine and femoral neck for adult and paediatric patients, respectively, as well as alkaline phosphatase, 
NTx and CTx in adult patients. As it was not expected to see changes after 40 weeks of treatment, only 
baseline measures were collected and these were not summarised but intended to serve as a reference 
for patients continuing in the long-term open-label study.  
Responder analysis 
As requested in the CHMP scientific advice analyses of response categories for Hgb, platelet count, and 
liver  and  spleen  volumes  were  performed.  For  Hgb  response  categories  on  velaglucerase  alfa,  52.9% 
(9/17)  had  a  good  response  (increase  from  baseline  ≥1.5 g/dL),  35.3%  (6/17)  had  a  moderate 
response  (>0.5 g/dL,  <1.5 g/dL),  and  11.8%  (2/17)  had  no  response  (≤0.5 g/dL).  Corresponding 
figures  on  imiglucerase  were  41.2%  (7/17),  41.2%  (7/17),  and  17.6%  (3/17),  respectively.  For 
platelet  count  response  categories,  15  patients  with  platelet  counts  below  normal  (150 × 109/L)  at 
baseline  were  evaluated,  8  on  velaglucerase  alfa  and  7  on  imiglucerase.  Categories  were  good 
response  (>30 × 109/L),  moderate  response  (>15 × 109/L  and  ≤30 × 109/L),  and  no  response 
(≤15 × 109/L). In the velaglucerase alfa group, 7 patients had a good and 1 a moderate response; all 
7 patients on imiglucerase had a good response. For liver volume response categories 16 patients on 
velaglucerase  alfa    and  15  on  imiglucerase  were  included,  categorised  as  good  response  (≥30% 
reduction from baseline), moderate response (≥10% and <30%), or no response (<10%). Distribution 
of  patients  across  response  categories  for  each  treatment  group  was  similar.  For  spleen  volume 
response categories 7 patients on velaglucerase alfa and 6 on imiglucerase were included. They were 
categorised  as  good  response  (≥30%  reduction  from  baseline),  moderate  response  (≥10%  and 
<30%),  or  no  response  (<10%).  All  patients  achieved  a  good  response.  In  conclusion,  exploratory 
endpoints Hgb, platelet count, liver and spleen volume response categories showed comparable results

between  velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase  groups.  Response  categories  as  proposed  in  the  CHMP 
scientific advice (July 2006) were used. 
2.4.7.2.2.6.  Ancillary analyses 
Prospectively  defined  subgroup  analyses  were  planned  for  exploratory  purposes  only.  The  effect  of 
velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase  on  haemoglobin  concentration  were  compared  at  Week  41  within 
the  following  subgroups:  age  (2  to  17  years  old;  ≥18  years  old);  gender  (male;  female);and 
splenectomy status. The 95% confidence intervals for each estimated treatment difference included 0, 
demonstrating that there were no statistically significant treatment differences between the two groups 
in change in haemoglobin concentration for the subgroups examined. The differences are summarized 
in the below table.

2.4.7.3. 
 Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Analysis of results across trials has not been provided. However, assessment of data from single trials 
indicates comparable effects of velaglucerase alfa on Hgb, platelet count and organ volumes across the 
trials. 
2.4.7.4. 
 Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical studies in special populations have been performed. However, in study TKT032 exploratory 
subgroup analyses were pre-specified for age groups 2 to 17 years versus ≥18 years, gender and anti-
velaglucerase  alfa    antibody  status  (positive;  negative).  Since  only  one  patient  developed  anti-
velaglucerase alfa antibodies, no subgroup analysis of anti-velaglucerase alfa antibody status has been 
performed. No subgroup analyses have been provided for studies HGT-GCB-039 and TKT034. Analyses 
of  Hgb  for  subgroups  age  and  gender  in  trial  TKT032  do  not  indicate  differences  in  the  response  to 
treatment for either age or gender.  
2.4.7.5. 
 Supportive study(ies) 
Study HGT-GCB-039 is the only trial providing controlled data. The statistical analyses provided in the 
study  reports  of  the  supportive  trials  TKT025,  TKT025EXT,  TKT032  and  TKT034  are  not  considered 
relevant,  since  none  of  these  had  a  comparator.  Details  of  baseline  characteristics  for  the  supportive 
trials are listed in the following table.

Study TKT025 
Study  TKT025  was  a  Phase  I/II  open-label  study  conducted  April  2004  to  April  2005  and  the  initial 
clinical trial. It was conducted at a single study centre in Israel. Twelve treatment-naïve (≥12 months) 
patients  were  included.  Phase  I  consisted  of  a  dose-escalation  design;  the  first  patient  received  two 
15 U/kg doses and then one 30 U/kg dose. The next two patients received one 15 U/kg and then one 
30 U/kg dose. Based on acceptable safety evaluations, all three patients had their doses increased to 
60 U/kg.  Further  nine  patients  in  the  second  phase  were  dosed  at  60 U/kg  throughout  the  study. 
Patients were treated every other week (EOW) for total of 20 doses. In the pooled analyses all twelve 
patients  were  included  in  an  “As  Received”  60 U/kg  treatment  group  since  60 U/kg  was  the  dosage 
predominantly received.  
Clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant  mean  increases  from  baseline  in  Hgb  and  statistically 
significant  mean  increases  in  platelet  counts  were  observed  after  3  months  of  therapy,  as  well  as 
statistically significant reductions from baseline in mean liver and spleen volumes after 6 month (first 
scheduled  liver  and  spleen  evaluation).  Reductions  in  biomarker  values  of  serum  chitotriosidase  and 
CCL18 were observed after 3 months. Changes in these parameters were continuous during the course 
of  the  study.  Each  patient  experienced  improvements  in  at  least  2  of  the  4  therapeutic  parameters 
Hgb, platelet counts, spleen volume, or liver volume. Key results are given in the following table.

No  clinically  significant  changes  or  trends  were  observed  in  pulmonary  function,  bone  density,  bone 
marrow  as  evaluated  by  MRI,  or  cardiac  function  as  evaluated  by  ECG.  The  efficacy  data  from  study 
TKT025 are consistent with a clinically significant positive effect of velaglucerase alfa dosed as 60 U/kg 
EOW on relevant markers of type 1 Gaucher disease. Effects were maintained throughout nine month 
duration of the trial. The pharmacokinetics is described in section 3.4.3. 
Study TKT025EXT 
Study  TKT025EXT  is  an  ongoing,  open-label  extension  study  of velaglucerase  alfa  therapy  in  patients 
who  completed  study  TKT025.  Patients  continued  with  60 U/kg  EOW  for  at  least  3  months.  At  12 
months of cumulative therapy, patients were evaluated for a reduction in dose, a transitional dose of 
45 U/kg  administered  EOW  for  3  months  and  30 U/kg  thereafter.  To  be  eligible,  patients  must  have 
met  at  least  2  of  the  4  pre-defined  therapeutic  goals  for  year-one  (i.e.  Hgb  ≥11.0 g/dL  females, 
children, ≥12.0 g/dL males within 12 to 24 months of treatment in the absence of iron deficiency; 1.5-
fold  increase  in  platelet  count  in  patients  with  intact  spleen,  avoiding  splenectomy  and  preventing 
surgical,  obstetrical  or  spontaneous  bleeding;  reduction  of  liver  volume  by  20%  to  30%  within  one 
year of treatment, maintenance of liver volume to 1 to 1.5-times normal volume; reduction of spleen 
volume by 30% to 50% within one year of treatment, maintenance of spleen volume to ≤2 to 8-times 
normal  volume  while  alleviating  symptoms  due  to  splenomegaly.  The  primary  objective  was  the 
evaluation  of  the  long-term  safety  of  velaglucerase  alfa  when  administered  IV  at  a  dose  of  30  or 
60 U/kg.  The  secondary  objective  was  the  assessment  of  the  effects  of  velaglucerase  alfa  on  clinical 
activity in these patients as measured by haematological parameters and reduction in liver and spleen 
volumes. 
Of the eleven patients who completed Study TKT025, ten elected to enrol in TKT025EXT. As of 1 June 
2009,  the  data  cut-off,  8  of  10  patients  were  still  participating  and  had  been  receiving  velaglucerase 
alfa  EOW  for  60  months.  The  predominant  dose  of  velaglucerase  alfa  received  in  this  extension  was 
30 U/kg.  The  preliminary  data  indicate  that  mean  Hgb  remained  within  the  normal  range.  At  60 
months, there was a mean increase in Hgb concentration from baseline of +2.38 g/dL (95% CI: 1.60, 
3.16; 21.26% change). The improvement in the Hgb concentration continues to be maintained in the 8 
remaining  patients.  Mean  increase  in  platelet  count  from  baseline  at  60  months  was  +85.1  x  109/L 
(95%  CI:  59.8,  110.4;  157.18%  change).  The  improvement  in  platelet  count  is  robust  at  60  months 
and  not  only  is  velaglucerase  alfa  treatment  maintaining  the  effect  achieved  so  far,  but  continues  to 
improve  the  platelet  count  even  after  5  years  of  therapy.  Mean  decrease  in  normalised  liver  volume 
following 57 months of treatment revealed a mean percent reduction from baseline of -38.80% (95% 
CI: -49.10, -28.50). The reduction in mean normalised liver volume continues to be maintained in the 
remaining 8 patients who are still on the study. Spleen volume following 57 months treatment revealed 
a mean percent reduction in normalised spleen volume from baseline of -73.97% (95% CI: -89.33, -
58.60) and the improvement in spleen volume continues to be maintained in the remaining 8 patients.  
Study TKT025EXT shows that the treatment effect is maintained over an extended period of five years 
in  spite  of  lowering  of  the  dose  by  50%.  Since  this  study  might  contribute  relevant  information  for 
dosing  in  maintenance  therapy,  the  a  commitment  to  provide  the  final  study  report  6  months  after 
finalisation of this trial in form of a follow-up measure has been agreed.

Study TKT032 
Study TKT032 is a completed, randomised, Phase III, double-blind, parallel group, 2-dose, multi-centre, 
multinational,  12-month  clinical  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  velaglucerase 
alfa  in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. It was conducted between February 2007 and April 2009, 
the study report is dated July 2009. To be eligible patients were to be treatment-naïve, defined as no 
Gaucher  disease  therapy  ≤30  months  prior  to  study  entry.  Eligible  patients  were  randomly  allocated 
1:1  to  either  a fixed  dose  of  60  or  45 U/kg  of velaglucerase  alfa  EOW.  Splenectomised  patients  were 
excluded.  Twenty-five  patients  were  randomised,  13  to  45 U/kg  and  12  to  60 U/kg;  all  25  patients 
completed  the  study.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the  change  in  Hgb  from  baseline  to  month  12  in 
patients treated with 60 U/kg velaglucerase alfa EOW (ITT population). Velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg led 
to a clinically meaningful and statistically significant (p<0.0001) increase in mean Hgb from baseline of 
2.43 g/dL  (23.25%).  Median  Hgb  was  10.825  g/dL  and  12.550  g/dL  at  baseline  and  study  endpoint, 
respectively.  
Regarding  the  secondary  endpoints,  velaglucerase  alfa  at  45 U/kg  EOW  led  to  a  clinically  and 
statistically significant increases in mean Hgb of 2.438 g/dL (p=0.0001, adjusted for multiple testing), 
a  23.81%  increase.  In  both  dose  groups  statistically  significant  mean  increases  from  Baseline  in 
platelet  counts  were  observed,  50.88 x 109/L  (65.93%,  p=0.0016)  and  40.92 x 109/L  (66.38%, 
p=0.0111)  in  the  60 U/kg  and  45 U/kg  dose  groups,  respectively.  Mean  normalised  spleen  volume 
decreased statistically significant by 1.92% (p=0.0032) and 1.87% (p=0.0085) of body weight in the 
60 U/kg and 45 U/kg dose groups, respectively, corresponding to -50.35% and -39.88% changes from 
baseline.  Decreases  from  baseline  in  mean  normalised  liver  volume  were  less  pronounced.  Results 
were  not  statistically  significant  after  adjusting  for  multiple  testing.  Mean  values  of  CCL18  and 
chitotriosidase  levels  decreased  throughout  the  study  in  both  dose  groups.  Regarding  the  secondary 
endpoint QoL (SF-36 or CHQ-PF50) no conclusions could be drawn due to small sample sizes for each 
item  evaluated.  Regarding  tertiary  endpoints,  time  to  first  response  of  at  least  +1 g/dL  was  reached 
for all patients at Week 27 and at Week 37 in the 60 U/kg and 45 U/kg groups, respectively. Analyses 
of the modified ITT population confirmed results of the ITT population.

The assumption of a difference in efficacy between the velaglucerase alfa dose groups in this study was 
based  on  the  observation  of  differences  in  Hgb  first  response,  platelet  response  categories,  and  the 
reduction  of  liver  volumes.  No  other  comparisons  of  dose  related  effects  have  been  provided.  In  the 
group  receiving  60 U/kg,  100%  of  patients  had  a  Hgb  first  response  (increase  >1.0 g/dL)  10  weeks 
earlier, i.e. by Week 27, than patients on 45 U/kg, i.e. on Week 37. A comparison of platelet response 
categories  between  dose  groups  showed  fewer  non-responders  on  velaglucerase  alfa  60 U/kg 
compared to 45 U/kg. A moderate to good response was defined as an increase in platelet count of at 
least  15  x  109/L  in  patients  with  below  normal  values  at  baseline  (<150  x  109/L).  Regarding  liver 
volumes, although both doses resulted in a marked reduction by month 12, results achieved a nominal 
significance  level  of  0.05  within  the  velaglucerase  alfa  60 U/kg  group  but  not  the  45 U/kg  group, 
suggesting  a  dose-related  effect  in  favour  of  velaglucerase  alfa  60 U/kg.  However,  according  to  the 
clinical  study  report  and  the  statistical  analysis  plan  no  direct  statistical  comparisons  of  the  45  and 
60 U/kg dose groups were planned or conducted. Comparison of Hgb results by age groups for adults 
and paediatric (<17 years) and by gender did not indicate a difference between groups independent of 
dose.  Regarding  skeletal  age,  annualised  growth  velocity,  changes  in  Tanner  stage,  and  pulmonary 
function, no conclusions could be drawn due to insufficient data.

In conclusion no formal comparisons of the different dose groups in this trial have been pre-specified 
or  provided.  It  appears  that  effects  on  Hgb  and  platelet  count  were  equal  or  greater  in  the  45 U/kg 
group  while  the  opposite  was  seen  for  effects  on  liver  and  spleen  volume  and  time  to  first  response, 
indicating an earlier response in the 60 U/kg group.  
Study TKT034 
Study  TKT034  is  a  completed,  multi-centre,  Phase  II/III,  open-label,  12-month  study  designed  to 
evaluate safety of velaglucerase alfa therapy for patients who had received imiglucerase therapy for at 
least  30  consecutive  months.  The  study  was  conducted  between  July  2007  and  June  2009.  Patients 
splenectomised  or  positive  for  imiglucerase  antibodies  were  not  excluded.  Patients  were  required  to 
have  received  imiglucerase  at  a  constant  dose  during  6  months  prior  to  study  enrolment.  Patients 
received  the  same  dose  in  U/kg  of  velaglucerase  alfa  as  prior  imiglucerase.  Prior  imiglucerase  dose 
ranged from 15 to 60 U/kg. Administration of velaglucerase alfa at home was available to patients who 
met  the  necessary  requirements.  Patients  were  monitored  for  changes  in  clinical  parameters  such  as 
Hgb, platelet count, and liver and spleen volume. Forty-one patients were enrolled and 40 received at 
least one full or partial dose. One patient withdrew consent prior to receiving study drug. For analysis 
data were summarised based on mean dose in 1 of 4 nominal dose groups presented in the following 
table.

The  main  focus  of  this  trial  was  on  the  safety  assessment  of  switching  patients  from  imiglucerase  to 
velaglucerase  alfa.  In  terms  of  efficacy,  the  mean  baseline  Hgb  was  sustained  throughout  the  study. 
Median  Hgb  at  baseline  was  13.775 g/dL.  Mean  change  from  baseline  was  -0.101 g/dL  and  the 
corresponding  90%  CI  was  -0.272  to  0.070,  within  the  efficacy  criterion  of  ±1 g/dL.  Mean  baseline 
platelet  count  was  also  sustained  during  the  study;  median  platelet  count  was  162,000 × 109/L  and 
the % change from baseline was 7.04% with a 90% CI of 0.54 to 13.53, within the efficacy criterion of 
±20%. The mean baseline normalised liver volume was sustained from baseline over the course of the 
study.  At  baseline  the  mean  normalised  liver  volume  was  2.1%;  after  51  weeks  the  mean  percent 
change  from  baseline  in  normalised  liver  volume  was  -0.03%  with  a  90%  CI  of  -2.62%  to  2.56%, 
within  the  predefined  efficacy  criterion  of  15%.  The  mean  baseline  normalised  spleen  volume  was 
sustained  throughout  the  trial.  Baseline  mean  normalised  spleen  volume  was  0.84%;  mean  percent 
change from Baseline was -5.56% with a 90% CI of -10.77% to -0.35%, within the predefined efficacy 
criterion of 15%. 
2.4.8.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication for velaglucerase alfa was the long-term ERT for patients with type 1 Gaucher 
disease.  Currently,  only  imiglucerase  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  this  condition.  Data  from  4 
finalised clinical trials, one which was designed as a non-inferiority trial to imiglucerase, were provided. 
Other  trials  were  uncontrolled.  Trial  HGT-GCB-039  is  considered  to  be  the  pivotal  study.  No  placebo 
controlled data have been provided, which is acceptable for the patient population investigated. 
In  trial  HGT-GCB-039,  treatment  with  60 U/kg  velaglucerase  alfa  over  9  months  was  comparable  to 
treatment with 60 U/kg imiglucerase in treatment-naïve patients. Mean changes from baseline in Hgb 
were  comparable  between  velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase  treatment  groups  and  the  pre-defined 
primary endpoint was met. However, there was a 0.8 g/dL difference in median Hgb between groups at 
baseline,  which  was  maintained  throughout  the  study.  An  analysis  adjusting  for  the  baseline  Hgb 
concentration  values  confirmed  the  primary  efficacy  analysis.  Furthermore,  the  baseline  difference  is 
considered to be to the disadvantage of the efficacy of velaglucerase alfa rather than imiglucerase and 
thus,  adding  more  reassurance  for  the  assessment  of  velaglucerase  alfa  efficacy.  Regarding  the 
secondary  endpoint  platelet  count,  study  results  in  the  post-hoc  analysis  suggest  that  there  is  no 
relevant  difference  in  changes  between  velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase.  Although  there  was  a 
considerable imbalance in mean spleen volume at baseline, the obtained results indicate a comparable 
response in change of spleen volume between the groups. Change in liver volume, effects on plasma 
chitotriosidase and CCL18 values, and time to first Hgb response were comparable between the groups.

Mean and median annualised growth velocity were slightly higher in patients on imiglucerase, but the 
low  number  of  patients  per  group  does  not  allow  for  any  definite  conclusion.  The  limited  data  on 
difference  in skeletal  from  chronological  age  and  the  development  of  Tanner  stage  do  not  allow  for  a 
meaningful conclusion on the comparison between groups. Analyses of annualised growth velocity and 
Tanner  stage  are  hampered  not  only  by  the  low  absolute  numbers,  but  also  by  the  significant 
imbalance in age subgroups in the paediatric population.  
For adults changes in QoL measurements appear to be comparable between groups. Data do not allow 
any conclusion for paediatric patients (only one patient per group). The exploratory endpoints of Hgb 
levels, platelet count, liver and spleen volume response categories showed comparable results between 
velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase  groups;  response  categories  as  proposed  in  the  CHMP  scientific 
advice from July 2006 were used. 
Data from 4 supportive studies were provided:

Efficacy  data  from  study  TKT025  are  consistent  with  a  clinically  significant  positive  effect  of 
velaglucerase alfa dosed as 60 U/kg EOW on relevant markers of type 1 Gaucher disease. Effects 
were maintained throughout the 9 month duration of the trial.  
Study  TKT032  provided  results  from  two  dose  groups  of  velaglucerase  alfa  patients,  45  and 
60 U/kg.  No  formal  comparisons  of  these  dose  groups  have  been  pre-specified  or  provided  and 
thus, this trial is considered uncontrolled. It appears that effects on Hgb and platelet count were 
equal  or  greater  in  the  45 U/kg  dose  group,  while  the  opposite  was  seen  for  effects  on  liver, 
spleen volume and time to first Hgb response, indicating an earlier response in the 60 U/kg group.  
The  main  focus  of  study  TKT034  was  on  the  safety  assessment  of  transitioning  patients  from 
imiglucerase  to  velaglucerase  alfa.  Regarding  efficacy  mean  baseline  Hgb,  platelet  count,  and 
normalised liver and spleen volumes were sustained throughout this study.  
There are currently no final data from study TKT025EXT contributing to the efficacy evaluation of 
velaglucerase  alfa.  The  preliminary  data  indicate  that  the  treatment  effect  is  maintained  over  an 
extended period of five years in spite of lowering of the dose by 50%. Further information on the 
appropriate  maintenance  dose  is  expected  to  be  derived  from  the  final  study  results.  Final  study 
report will be provided within 6 months after finalisation of this trial. 
Overall,  data  from  these  trials  support  the  assumption  that  velaglucerase  alfa  is  effective  in  type  1 
Gaucher disease patients. 
No clinical studies in special populations have been performed. Exploratory subgroup analyses of data 
from study TKT032 do not indicate differences in the response to treatment for either age or gender. 
Data  from  children  are  scarce  and  relevant  information  has  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  Although  no 
analyses of efficacy data across the clinical trials have been conducted, assessment of data from single 
trials  indicates  comparable  effects  of  velaglucerase  alfa  on  Hgb,  platelet  count  and  liver  and  spleen 
organ volumes across all trials. 
2.4.9.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data from trial HGT-GCB-039 indicate that velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg EOW in treatment naïve 
patients is not inferior to imiglucerase as assessed by increases in Hgb and platelet count. Results from 
supportive studies are in line with the findings in the pivotal trial. Long term data do not indicate any 
inconsistent  effects  in  increases  in  Hgb  and  platelet  count,  or  decreases  in  liver  and  spleen  volumes. 
Efficacy  results  were  consistent  between  the  limited  paediatric  and  adult  patient  population  and  no 
gender related differences were observed. 
2.4.10.  Clinical safety 
Safety  data  are  derived  from  the  Phase  I/II  study  TKT025,  the  Phase  II/III  or  III  studies  TKT032, 
TKT034,  and  HGT-GCB-039,  and  the  extension  study  TKT025EXT.  Study  TKT025EXT  is  ongoing,  but 
safety  data  report  with  data  cut-off  01  June  2009  has  been  provided.  Velaglucerase  alfa  clinical 
programme does not compare velaglucerase alfa to placebo. The only available controlled safety data 
are from trial HGT-GCB-039 comparing velaglucerase alfa to ERT imiglucerase, the current standard of 
treatment  in  type  1  Gaucher  disease.  Discussion  of  the  safety  of  velaglucerase  alfa  in  comparison  to 
imiglucerase has not been provided but reference is made to the HGT-GCB-039 clinical study report.

2.4.10.1.  Patient exposure 
Exposure  to  velaglucerase  alfa  in  the  clinical  programme  is  limited.  However,  in  light  of  the  low 
prevalence  of  type  1  Gaucher  disease,  exposure  is  considered  adequate  to  assess  safety,  especially 
since  a  large  proportion  of  patients  have  been  treated  for  at  least  one  year.  There  are  safety  data 
available for as long as 60 months of treatment. 
Different pools for the integrated safety analysis have been compiled and evaluated: 
−  Treatment  naïve  patients  from  TKT025,  TKT032,  and  HGT-GCB-039  pooled  for  0  to  9  months 
exposure;  
−  Treatment  naïve  patients  from  TKT025,  TKT025EXT,  and  TKT032  pooled  for  0  to  12  months 
exposure;  
−  Treatment naïve patients from TKT025EXT for >9 months exposure;  
−  Patients transitioning from imiglucerase (TKT034).

Overall  94  patients  have  been  treated  with  velaglucerase  alfa  15  to  60 U/kg.  Of  these,  54  patients 
were treatment-naïve as pre-defined, 41 on 60 U/kg. Ten out of eleven patients who completed study 
TKT025 continued in extension study TKT025EXT, eight of these have received 51 months of treatment 
(cumulative  exposure  60  months).  Forty  patients  transitioning  from  imiglucerase  were  included  in 
TKT034,  with  doses  of  15  to  60 U/kg;  equivalent  to  their  previous  dose  of  imiglucerase.  Twenty-five 
(22.5%)  patients  were  in  the  paediatric  age  group  (2-17  years);  the  majority  of  all  patients  were 
white. Gender was balanced between treatment groups in all populations.

Patient Exposure – Safety Population HGT-GCB-039 
2.4.10.2.  Adverse events  
Treatment-Naïve Patients 0 to 9 Months Exposure 
Fifty-one  of  54  patients  (94.4%)  treated  with  velaglucerase  alfa  and  16  of  17  (94.1%)  patients  on 
imiglucerase  experienced  a  treatment  emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE).  The  most  common  events  on 
velaglucerase  alfa  were  headache,  nasopharyngitis,  bone  pain,  arthralgia,  pyrexia,  and  dizziness;  on 
imiglucerase  these  were  influenza,  headache,  nasopharyngitis,  bone  pain,  arthralgia,  and  abdominal 
pain, upper.  
Thirty-three  patients  (61.1%)  on  velaglucerase  alfa  experienced  AEs  considered  possibly  or  probably 
related to study drug, 9 (69.2%) on 45 U/kg and 24 (58.5%) on 60 U/kg. On imiglucerase 6 patients 
(35.3%) experienced AEs considered study drug related. The majority of events were infusion-related; 
1  patient  on  imiglucerase  withdrew  consent  due  to  such  an  event.  Five  patients  (9.3%)  on 
velaglucerase alfa experienced severe AEs. Two patients treated with 45 U/kg had a single AE of Grade 
3  severity.  One  patient  had  severe  thrombocytopenia,  reported  1  day  prior  to  Week  9  infusion, 
considered  not  related,  and  resolved  without  sequelae  and  without  intervention.  The  other  patient 
experienced  severe  syncope  (fainting)  1  day  prior  to  Week  31  infusion,  considered  not  related,  and 
resolved  without  sequelae.  Two  patients  on  60 U/kg  velaglucerase  alfa  had  severe  AEs  and  1  patient 
had  a  life-threatening  AE.  One  patient  had  a  severe  prolongation  of  activated  partial  thromboplastin 
time (probably related). A second patient had severe worsening back pain (not related) not resolved by 
end  of  study,  and  severe  allergic  dermatitis  (probably  related).  The  third  patient  experienced  life-
threatening  convulsion  (not  related)  that  was  resolved  by  end  of  study.  Two  patients  (11.8%)  on 
60 U/kg  imiglucerase  experienced  1  severe  AE  each;  1  patient  experienced  severe  arthralgia  (not 
related) and 1 patient experienced severe chills (probably related).

Treatment-Naïve Patients 0 to 12 Months Exposure 
This  group  only  includes  patients  treated  with  velaglucerase  alfa.  Data  are  comparable  to  safety 
findings in the 0 to 9 months group. 
Treatment-Naïve Patients Long-term Exposure (>9 Months)  
This  group  only  includes  patients  treated  with  velaglucerase  alfa.  Safety  results  are  comparable  to 
findings in the 0 to 9 months group and the pattern of adverse event does not appear to change over 
time. However the small numbers make it impossible to draw any conclusions.  
Patients transitioned from Imiglucerase 
The  following  table  summarises  AEs  in  patients  transitioned  from  imiglucerase.  Thirty-four  of  40 
patients  (85.0%)  experienced  at  least  1  TEAE.  The  most  frequent  AEs  were  headache,  arthralgia, 
nasopharyngitis,  back  pain  cough,  pharyngolaryngeal  pain,  and  myalgia.  Eleven  patients  (27.5%) 
experienced  AEs  considered  possibly  or  probably  related  to  study  drug.  The  majority  of  those  events 
were infusion related.

Overall Summary of AEs HGT-GCB-039 
Regarding the AEs occurring in ≥10% of patients in both groups, 94.1% reported at least one AE. AEs 
were  most  commonly  reported  within  the  SOCs  infections  and  infestations,  musculoskeletal  and 
connective tissue disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions.  
Sixteen patients (94.1%) experienced at least 1 TEAE. The majority of events were mild or moderate. 
Three patients on velaglucerase alfa had a severe or life-threatening AE; 1 patient experienced severe 
back  pain  and  severe  allergic  dermatitis,  1  patient  experienced  severe  prolonged  activated  partial 
thromboplastin  time  (aPTT)  and  1  patient  experienced  life-threatening  convulsion.  Two  patients  on 
imiglucerase  experienced  severe  AEs;  1  patient  experienced  severe  arthralgia  and  1  patient 
experienced  severe  chills.  8  patients  (47.1%)  on  velaglucerase  alfa  had  AEs  considered  possibly  or 
probably  related  to  study  drug,  including  severe  AEs  of  allergic  skin  reaction  and  severe  prolonged 
aPTT. Six patients on imiglucerase experienced possibly or probably related AEs, including one event of 
severe rigors. Infusion-related AEs were experienced by 5 of 8 patients with study drug related AEs on 
velaglucerase alfa and 4 of 6 patients on imiglucerase.

Summary of Possibly/Probably Related TEAEs by SOC – Safety Population 
In  conclusion,  the  overall  AE  profile  appears  to  be  comparable  between  treatment  groups  of 
velaglucerase alfa and imiglucerase. However, no SAE occurred in the imiglucerase group compared to 
3  SAEs  on  velaglucerase  alfa  and  there  was  1  case  of  severe  prolonged  aPTT  on  velaglucerase  alfa 
compared  to  none  on  imiglucerase.  Prolongation  of  aPTT  is  a  potential  risk  that  has  to  be  further 
evaluated. For this purpose the CHMP requested a commitment for an analysis of aPTT values in both 
treatment groups as a follow-up measure. Additionally, bleeding disorders will be collected via register 
and included in the PSURs as closely monitored issues. 
2.4.10.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No  patient  experienced  a  life  threatening  AE  and  no  deaths  were  reported  during  studies  with 
velaglucerase  alfa.  Of  the  54  treatment-naïve  patients  who  received  velaglucerase  alfa,  8  patients 
experienced a total of 12 SAEs.

Treatment-Naïve Patients, 0 to 9 Months Exposure 
Four  patients  on  velaglucerase  alfa  experienced  a  total  of  5  SAEs.  One  SAE  (allergic  dermatitis)  was 
considered  related  to  study  drug.  A  mild  allergic  skin  reaction  214  days  after  initial  dose  and  7  days 
after the most recent administration was experienced by one patient. The skin reaction became more 
serious  10  days  later;  the  patient  was  presented  to  the  hospital  and  the  event  was  resolved  without 
sequelae.  The  skin  reaction  was  considered  severe  and  probably  related  to  treatment.  The  patient 
continued  on  velaglucerase  alfa  at  the  same  dose  with  added  premedication  of  unspecified 
antihistamines and corticoids. Rechallenge was negative. 
Treatment-Naïve Patients 0 to 12 Months Exposure 
There were no SAEs in addition to those discussed in the 0 to 9 months exposure group. 
Treatment-Naïve Patients Long-term Exposure (>9 Months)  
Four patients experienced a total of 7 SAEs; none of these were considered treatment related. 
Patients transitioned from imiglucerase 
Four out of 40 patients experienced at least one SAE. In the 15 U/kg group, one patient experienced a 
moderate anaphylactoid, treatment related SAE upon receiving the first dose of velaglucerase alfa. The 
patient responded rapidly to discontinuation and supportive care, recovered without sequelae, and did 
not develop anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies. Another patient in the 30 U/kg group experienced SAEs 
of  severe  face  swelling  and  severe  urticaria  approximately  7  months  after  start  of  treatment.  The 
patient  required  hospitalisation  and  the  events,  considered  not  related  to  the  treatment,  resolved 
without sequelae. Other SAEs were not considered to be treatment related. 
HGT-GCB-039 
The overview of SAEs identified in the study HGT-GCB-039 are summarised below. 
Listing of SAEs – Safety Population 
In conclusion, in study HGT-GCB-039 SAE occurred only in patients treated with velaglucerase alfa, but 
only 1 of the 4 SAE, an allergic skin reaction, is considered probably treatment related. Since allergic 
skin reactions have also been described for imiglucerase, the difference is most likely a chance finding 
due to the low number of patients treated per group.  
2.4.10.4.  Laboratory findings 
Investigations 
In the overall safety pool, 6 treatment-naïve patients (11.1%) on velaglucerase alfa, 2 on 45 U/kg and 
4 on 60 U/kg dose, experienced a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. No laboratory AEs 
have been reported for patients on imiglucerase. 
In  study  HGT-GCB-039  analyses  of  serum  chemistry  and  urinalysis  parameters  revealed  no  clinically 
important  mean  changes  in  either  group  with  the  exception  of  changes  in  aPTT.  One  patient  on 
velaglucerase alfa reported a severe AE of prolonged aPTT (129.6 sec), which was considered probably 
treatment related. Prothrombin time was also prolonged (17.2 sec). Liver function tests (ALT, AST, and 
GGT) were normal throughout the study and the patient continued velaglucerase alfa treatment in the 
Assessment report

extension protocol. One patient per each treatment group reported a moderate, not treatment related 
AE of thrombocytopenia. Data on all aPTT-measurements for the six patients who were found to have 
increased level during the study have been provided. The fact that all patients had an elevated aPTT at 
screening  or  baseline  supports  the  assumption  that  the  increase  was  associated  with  the  underlying 
disease rather than the treatment as such. The literature data provided further support that elevated 
aPTT level is a known feature in Gaucher’s disease. However, no summary of the characteristics of the 
six  patients  in  the  study  has  been  given,  thus  the  severity  of  disease,  degree  of  liver  affection  or 
splenectomy status has not been accounted for.   
Anti-velaglucerase alfa and anti-imiglucerase antibodies 
In  the  overall  safety  pool  of  the  94  patients  on  velaglucerase  alfa,  one  treatment-naïve  patient  was 
tested  positive  for  anti-velaglucerase  alfa  antibodies.  Of  the  17  treatment-naïve  patients  treated  with 
imiglucerase,  4  patients  were  tested  positive  for  anti-imiglucerase  antibodies.  The  adult  male  patient 
on velaglucerase alfa completed 12 months of treatment with 45 U/kg. Antibodies were characterised 
as IgG and neutralising and were detected only after 1 year of treatment. Patient's modified Hgb and 
platelet count baseline values were 12.25 g/dL and 33.5 x 109/L, respectively. Corresponding Week 53 
values were 13.6 g/dL and 54.0 x 109/L, respectively. No AEs were reported during the study. 
In  the  4  patients  on  imiglucerase  antibodies  were  characterised  as  IgG.  IgG  antibody  in  one  patient 
was  neutralising,  and  the  patient  also  had  neutralising  anti-velaglucerase  alfa  antibodies.  Cross-
reaction between antibodies is not considered surprising since both proteins share extensive sequence 
homology. The patient experienced multiple infusion-related AEs throughout the study and eventually 
withdrew  consent  due  to  these  events.  Patients  in  the  extension  study  TKT025EXT  were  tested 
negative  for  anti-velaglucerase  alfa  antibodies  until  data  cut-off.  Of  the  40  patients  who  transitioned 
from imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa, no patient tested positive for anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies, 
including  3  patients  tested  positive  for  anti-imiglucerase  antibodies  at  screening.  In  study  HGT-GCB-
039,  all  patients  in  the  safety  population  were  negative  for  both  anti-imiglucerase  and  anti-
velaglucerase  alfa  antibodies  at  baseline.  No  patient  in  the  velaglucerase  alfa  group  developed  anti-
velaglucerase  alfa  or  anti-imiglucerase  antibodies.  Four  (25.0%)  patients  in  the  imiglucerase  group 
developed  anti-imiglucerase  antibodies.  One  of  the  patients  had  anti-velaglucerase  alfa  antibodies; 
neutralising  antibodies  for  imiglucerase  and  velaglucerase  alfa  were  present.  Development  of  anti-
velaglucerase alfa antibodies can be attributed to cross-reaction in the assay, as this patient had never 
been exposed to velaglucerase alfa. This patient experienced AEs of thrombocytopenia, flushing, upper 
abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort and others. Nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, convulsion, lichen planus, 
or  influenza-like  illness  was  reported  among  the  3  remaining  patients  positive  for  anti-imiglucerase 
antibody.  
Overall laboratory findings do not indicate significant differences between treatment groups. Antibody 
formation  appears  to  be  numerically  higher  in  patients  on  imiglucerase  than  on  velaglucerase  alfa. 
However absolute numbers are low and thus no definite conclusion is possible.

 Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses of AE for age, gender, and splenectomy status have been provided. The findings do 
not  indicate  differences  in  the  AE  profiles  for  age  groups,  gender,  or  splenectomy  status.  However, 
absolute numbers per group are too small for any definite conclusion. 
2.4.10.6. 
 Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No data on drug-drug or drug-disease interactions with regard to safety have been provided and this is 
considered acceptable. 
2.4.10.7. 
 Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The  analyses  of  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  did  not  reveal  any  unexpected  findings.  In  study  HGT-
GCB-039, there were no relevant differences in discontinuation due to AEs between treatment groups. 
Compliance was high in both groups. In the treatment-naïve group of the overall patient safety pool no 
patient  on  velaglucerase  alfa  discontinued  due  to  an  AE,  while  4  of  54  (7.4%)  patients  discontinued 
early  for  reasons  considered  unrelated  to  study  drug.  One  of  17  (5.9%)  patients  (039-071-0004)  on 
60 U/kg  imiglucerase  withdrew  consent  due  to  infusion-related  AEs.  The  patient  experienced  warm 
feeling  at  Week  15,  feeling  cold  at  Week  19,  flushing  and  cold  feeling  at  Week  21  and  severe  rigors 
and decrease in oxygen saturation at Week 23. The patient tested positive for neutralising antibodies 
to  imiglucerase  and  discontinued  at  Week  23.  2  of  40  (5%)  patients  transitioned  from  imiglucerase 
discontinued  early.  One  patient  (034-048-0001)  transitioned  from  50 U/kg  imiglucerase  and 
categorised  in  the  15 U/kg  velaglucerase  alfa  group  (see  above)  discontinued  first  infusion  after  30 
minutes  due  to  an  SAE  of  anaphylactoid  reaction.  The  second  patient  withdrew  consent  at  Week  31 
because  she  did  not  feel  the  improvement  in  Gaucher-related  symptoms  justified  continued 
participation.

2.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure to velaglucerase alfa is limited, but in light of the low prevalence of type 1 Gaucher disease, 
it  is  considered  adequate.  The  most  relevant  safety  data  are  derived  from  study  HGT-GCB-039,  the 
only  trial  comparing  velaglucerase  alfa  to  imiglucerase  the  current  standard  of  treatment  for  type  1 
Gaucher disease patients eligible for ERT; safety evaluation in this trial is limited to the 17 patients per 
group  enrolled.  Separate  analyses  of  AEs  between  patients  treated  for  9  or  12  months  as  provided 
were not supported and analyses of controlled, imiglucerase comparison, and uncontrolled data would 
have  been  preferred.  For  patients  transitioned  from  imiglucerase  the  AE  profile  does  not  reveal  any 
unexpected findings.  
In study HGT-GCB-039 the duration of exposure and mean actual dose administered at each infusion 
were comparable between groups. The overall AE profile appears to be comparable between treatment 
groups. However, no SAE occurred in the imiglucerase group compared to 3 SAEs on velaglucerase alfa 
and  there  was  1  case  of  severe  prolonged  aPTT  on  velaglucerase  alfa  compared  to  none  on 
imiglucerase.  The  event  is  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  Re-analysis  of  the  prolongation  of  aPTT 
has  been  requested  by  the  CHMP.  No  patient  on  velaglucerase  alfa  developed  anti-velaglucerase  alfa 
antibodies throughout the study compared to 4 patients on imiglucerase developing anti-imiglucerase 
antibodies, but the number of patients available for comparison is too small for any definite conclusion. 
Infusion  related  AEs  were  balanced  between  groups.  Overall,  laboratory  findings  do  not  indicate 
significant differences between treatment groups. No deaths were reported for either group during the 
study.  SAE  occurred  only  in  patients  treated  with  velaglucerase  alfa,  but  only  1  of  the  4  SAE,  an 
allergic skin reaction, is considered probably treatment related. Since allergic skin reactions have also 
been described for imiglucerase, the difference is most likely a chance finding due to the low number 
of patients treated per group. 
Regarding  safety  in  special  populations  subgroup  analyses  have  been  provided  for  age,  gender,  and 
splenectomy  status.  Overall  AE  profiles  are  considered  comparable  between  age  groups,  female  and 
male  patients,  and  patients  with  and  without  spleen.  There  are  no  safety  signals  specific  to  the 
paediatric population. Infusion-related AEs are considered comparable between the groups. No data on 
drug-drug  or  drug-disease  interactions  with  regard  to  safety  have  been  provided.  There  were  no 
relevant differences in discontinuation due to AEs between treatment groups and compliance was high 
in both groups.  
For the overall data set there have been no unexpected findings in the analyses of SAEs and deaths; 
no  death  occurred  during  the  trials.  Six  patients  on  velaglucerase  alfa  compared  to  none  on 
imiglucerase  developed  a  prolonged  aPTT.  Although  these  events  appear  to  be  related  to  the 
underlying  disease  rather  than  being  a  treatment  effect,  the  limited  data  do  not  allow  a  definite 
conclusion and thus, prolonged aPTT is considered a potential risk to be included in the RMP. The event 
is also appropriately reflected in the SPC. 
Antibody formation appears to be numerically higher in patients on imiglucerase than on velaglucerase 
alfa,  but  absolute  numbers  are  low  and  thus  no  definite  conclusion  is  possible.  In  the  subgroup 
analyses of AE for age and gender, findings do not indicate differences in the AE profiles. As expected, 
infusion  related  AEs  occurred  with  velaglucerase  alfa  treatment.  No  unexpected  findings  have  been 
reported.  
Safety  related  to  drug-drug  interactions  and  other  interactions  has  not  been  provided  which  is 
considered acceptable. 
Analyses of discontinuations due to AEs do not reveal any unexpected findings. 
Sufficient  information  has  been  provided  to  allow  the  conclusion  that  velaglucerase  alfa  may  be 
administered as home therapy. In order to identify patients at high risk of infusion related reactions, it 
is  strongly  recommended  that  at  least  the  first  three  infusions  are  given  in  a  clinical  setting.  This 
strategy is reflected in the SmPC. 
2.6.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In  conclusion  the  safety  data  provided  do  not  indicate  significant  differences  in  safety  between 
velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase.  Sufficient  information  has  been  provided  to  allow  the  conclusion 
that  velaglucerase  alfa  may  be  administered  as  home  therapy.  Besides  the  prolonged  aPTT,  no 
Assessment report

unexpected  safety  findings  have  been  identified  during  the  trials  conducted  with  velaglucerase  alfa. 
Nevertheless the evaluation is limited by the low number of patients exposed to velaglucerase alfa in 
these trials. This has been adequately considered in the Risk Management Plan and follow up measures 
have  been  agreed.  There  will  be  an  Gaucher  disease  Observational  Survey  (GOS)  set  up  in  order  to 
monitor the post-marketing status of velaglucerase alfa as requested by the CHMP.

SPC Section 4.4 Warnings and 
precautions for use provide the following 
information about the risk, its 
management and suggested preventive 
measures: 
Infusion-related reactions were the most 
commonly observed adverse reactions in 
patients treated in clinical studies. Most 
of the infusion-related reactions were 
mild. The most commonly observed 
symptoms of infusion-related reactions 
were: headache, dizziness, hypotension, 
hypertension, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, 
and pyrexia/body temperature 
increased. In treatment-naïve patients, 
the majority of infusion-related reactions 
occurred during the first 6 months of 
treatment.  
The management of infusion-related 
reactions should be based on the 
severity of the reaction, and include 
slowing the infusion rate, treatment with 
medicinal products such as 
antihistamines, antipyretics and/or 
corticosteroids, and/or stopping and 
resuming treatment with increased 
infusion time. 
Pre-treatment with antihistamines 
and/or corticosteroids may prevent 
subsequent reactions in those cases 
where symptomatic treatment was 
required.  Patients were not routinely 
pre-medicated prior to infusion of 
velaglucerase alfa during clinical studies. 
Antibodies may play a role in treatment-
related reactions found with the use of 
velaglucerase alfa.  To further evaluate

 Benefits 
2.7.3.1.1. 
 Beneficial effects 
There  is  a  considerable  degree  of  variability  in  the  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  Gaucher  disease, 
ranging  from  severely  affected  infants  to  asymptomatic  adults.  Type  1  Gaucher  disease  is  the  most 
common subtype; patients display a wide range of symptoms. The clinical features of type 1 Gaucher 
disease  are  dominated  by  accumulation  of  Gaucher  cells  in  target  organs  liver,  spleen,  and  bone 
marrow  and  thus  include  anaemia  and  thrombocytopenia  due  to  splenic  sequestration  and  bone 
marrow replacement, as well as splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Besides symptomatic treatment, the 
goal  of  therapies  is  to  reduce  storage  of  GlcCer  in  affected  tissues  of  GD  patients  leading  to 
improvements  in  haemoglobin  concentration  (Hgb)  and  platelet  count  and  reductions  in  spleen  and 
liver volumes. The main endpoints of interest to assess the efficacy of treatments for type 1 Gaucher 
disease patients in clinical trials are changes in Hgb concentration, platelet count, and liver and spleen 
volume,  since  based  on  the  literature,  haematological  and  visceral  disease  therapeutic  goals  can 
generally be met more rapidly than designated goals for skeletal or pulmonary compartments. 
In  the  pivotal  trial  HGT-GCB-039  effects  of  treatment  with  60 U/kg  velaglucerase  alfa  over  9  months 
were  not  inferior  to  those  seen  with  60 U/kg  imiglucerase.  Mean  changes  from  baseline  in  Hgb  were 
comparable  between  velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase  treatment  groups  and  the  primary  endpoint 
of predefined non-inferiority criteria was met. For the ITT population, the mean absolute changes were 
1.624 g/dL for velaglucerase alfa and 1.488 g/dL for imiglucerase. Results were consistent with the PP 
population.  Responses  were  similar  between  treatment  groups  for  subgroups  paediatric  (age  2  to  17 
years), adult (age ≥18 years), gender, and splenectomy status. The secondary endpoint time to first 
Hgb response, defined as an increase of ≥1 g/dL from baseline, was similar between groups (log-rank 
p-value = 0.8965).  
Regarding the secondary endpoints, the mean platelet counts increased with both treatments. At Week 
41, the unadjusted mean change was 110.4 x 109/L in the velaglucerase alfa and 144.4 x 109/L in the 
imiglucerase group. The model-based estimated treatment difference in mean change at Week 41 was 
not  statistically  significant.  The  mean  change  in  liver  volume  was  comparable  between  groups  and 
statistically  not  significantly  different.  Regarding  the  change  in  spleen  volume  results  indicate  a 
substantial reduction during treatment. Results are based on 7 patients per group with spleen. Effects 
on  plasma  chitotriosidase  and  CCL18  values  were  comparable  between  treatment  groups.  For  adults 
changes  in  QoL  measurements  appear  to  be  comparable  between  groups.  The  exploratory  endpoints 
Hgb, platelet count, liver and spleen volume response categories showed comparable results between 
velaglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase  groups;  response  categories  as  proposed  in  the  CHMP  scientific 
advice were used. 
Efficacy  data  from  the  supportive  study  TKT025  are  consistent  with  a  clinically  significant  positive 
effect  of  velaglucerase  alfa  dosed  as  60 U/kg  EOW  on  relevant  markers  of  type  1  Gaucher  disease. 
Effects were maintained throughout the 9 month duration of the trial.  
In study TKT032, investigating two dose groups of velaglucerase alfa, 45 and 60 U/kg, effects on Hgb 
and  platelet  count  were  equal  or  greater  in  the  45 U/kg  dose  group,  while  the  opposite  was  seen  for 
effects on liver and spleen volume and time to first Hgb response, indicating an earlier response in the 
60 U/kg; no formal comparison of dose groups was prespecified. However, velaglucerase alfa induced 
clinically  relevant  effects  on  Hgb,  platelet  count,  and  spleen  and  liver  volumes  comparable  to  those 
seen in the other clinical trials.  
Assessment report  
Page 55/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, data from these trials support the assumption that velaglucerase alfa  is effective in increasing 
haemoglobin  concentration  and  platelet  count  as  well  as  reducing  spleen  and  liver  volumes  in  type  1 
Gaucher disease patients. 
No clinical studies in special populations have been performed. Exploratory subgroup analyses of data 
from study TKT032 do not indicate differences in the response to treatment for either age or gender. 
The applicant did not provide analyses of efficacy data across the clinical trials. However, assessment 
of data from single trials indicates comparable effects of velaglucerase alfa on Hgb, platelet count and 
organ volumes across trials.No placebo controlled data have been provided, which is acceptable for the 
patient population investigated. 
2.7.3.1.2. 
 Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Interpretation of the results is generally limited by the low number of patients investigated and by the 
fact  that  the  majority  of  trials  have  been  uncontrolled,  the  exception  being  the  active-controlled  trial 
HGT-GCB-039  with  only  17  patients  per  arm.  In  this  trial,  there  were  also  imbalances  between 
treatment  groups  that  might  have  affected  the  outcome.  The  median  baseline  Hgb  was  11.4 g/dL  in 
the  velaglucerase  alfa  and  10.6 g/dL  in  the  imiglucerase  group.  This  difference  between  groups 
remained  during  the  entire  study.  However,  an  analysis  adjusting  for  the  baseline  haemoglobin 
concentration values confirmed the primary efficacy analysis and the baseline difference is considered 
to  be  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  efficacy  of  velaglucerase  alfa    rather  than  imiglucerase  and  thus 
adding reassurance to the assessment of the efficacy of velaglucerase alfa. For platelet count baseline 
values  were  higher  in  the  imiglucerase  compared  to  the  velaglucerase  alfa  group  (181.2  vs.  161.1  x 
109/L); the difference persisted at each assessment and appeared to increase in the latter half of the 
study. Part of the difference might be explained by the fact that all 4 children under the age of 5 years, 
3 with spleen and 1 splenectomised, were randomised to imiglucerase indicating a more severe course 
of  disease;  children  with  more  severe  disease  are  expected  to  have  a  better  response  to  treatment. 
Post  hoc  analyses  suggest  that  patients  in  the  2  to  4  years  age  group  have  skewed  the  data;  those 
three not splenectomised had large spleens and low platelet counts at baseline and appeared to have 
worse  disease  at  the  start  of  the  study.  There  was  also  a  considerable  imbalance  in  mean  spleen 
volume  at  baseline,  but  results  indicate  a  comparable  response  on  change  in  spleen  volume  between 
groups.  Regarding  the  assessment  of  QoL  measurements  the  interpretation  is  hampered  by  the 
insufficient data especially in children.  
There  are  currently  no  final  data  from  study  TKT025EXT  contributing  to  the  efficacy  evaluation  of 
velaglucerase  alfa.  The  preliminary  data  indicate  that  the  treatment  effect  is  maintained  over  an 
extended period of five years in spite of lowering of the dose by 50%. The applicant has committed to 
provide  the  final  CSR  in  an  acceptable  timeframe  after  finalisation  of  the  trial.  For  the  two  doses  of 
imiglucerase used in study TKT032, no formal comparison has been pre-specified or provided.  
2.7.3.2. 
 Risks 
2.7.3.2.1. 
 Unfavourable effects 
Exposure to velaglucerase alfa is limited, but in light of the low prevalence of type 1 Gaucher disease, 
considered  adequate.  The  most  relevant  safety  data  are  derived  from  study  HGT-GCB-039;  safety 
evaluation in this trial is limited to the 17 patients per group enrolled.  
In study HGT-GCB-039 the overall AE profile appears to be comparable between treatment groups. No 
deaths  were  reported  for  either  group  during  the  study.  SAE  occurred  only  in  patients  treated  with 
velaglucerase alfa, but only 1 of the 4 SAE, an allergic skin reaction, is considered probably treatment 
related. Since allergic skin reactions have also been described for imiglucerase, the difference is most 
likely a chance finding due to the low number of patients treated per group.  
One  case  of  prolonged  aPTT  occurred  in  the  velaglucerase  alfa  group  compared  to  none  in  the 
imiglucerase group. The event is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
No  patient  on  velaglucerase  alfa  developed  anti-velaglucerase  alfa  antibodies  throughout  the  study 
compared to 4 on imiglucerase. However, infusion related AEs were balanced between groups. Overall 
laboratory findings do not indicate significant differences between treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
Page 56/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding  safety  in  special  populations  subgroup  analyses  have  been  provided  for  age,  gender,  and 
splenectomy  status.  Overall  AE  profiles  are  considered  comparable  between  age  groups,  female  and 
male  patients,  and  patients  with  and  without  spleen.  There  are  no  safety  signals  specific  to  the 
paediatric population. 
No  data  on  drug-drug  or  drug-disease  interactions  with  regard  to  safety  have  been  provided.  There 
were no relevant differences in discontinuation due to AEs between treatment groups and compliance 
was high in both groups. 
For the overall data set there have been no unexpected findings in the analyses of SAEs and deaths; 
no death occurred during the trials.  
Six  patients  on  velaglucerase  alfa  compared  to  none  on  imiglucerase  developed  a  prolonged  aPTT. 
Although  these  events  appear  to  be  related  to  the  underlying  disease  rather  than  being  a  treatment 
effect  the  limited  data  do  not  allow  a  definite  conclusion  and  thus  prolonged  aPTT  is  considered  a 
potential risk to be included in the RMP. The event is however appropriately reflected in the SPC. 
Antibody formation appears to be numerically higher in patients on imiglucerase than on velaglucerase 
alfa , but absolute numbers are low and thus no definite conclusion is possible.  
In  the  subgroup  analyses  of  AE  for  age  and  gender,  findings  do  not  indicate  differences  in  the  AE 
profiles. 
Infusion  related  AEs  occurred  with  velaglucerase  alfa  treatment.  No  unexpected  findings  have  been 
reported.  
Safety  related  to  drug-drug  interactions  and  other  interactions  has  not  been  provided  which  is 
considered acceptable. 
Analyses of discontinuations due to AEs do not reveal any unexpected findings. 
2.7.3.2.2. 
 Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Evaluation  of  unfavourable  effects  is  restricted  by  the  limited  data  available.  However,  a  planned 
register, called Gaucher disease Observational Survey (GOS), will collect additional data on treatment 
with velaglucerase alfa. 
2.7.3.3. 
 Benefit-risk balance 
2.7.3.3.1. 
 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Changes  in  haemoglobin,  platelet  count,  and  organ  volumes  are  considered  relevant  and  sufficiently 
sensitive endpoints for the assessment of treatment efficacy. These endpoints contribute considerably 
to  the  disease  burden  and  thus  improvement  in  these  parameters  is  expected  to  alleviate  disease 
burden in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. According to the literature these therapeutic goals can 
generally be met more rapidly than designated goals for skeletal or pulmonary compartments. 
Except for the unexpected findings, antibody formation and infusion related events are considered the 
most  relevant  unfavourable  effects  for  assessment  of  safety  comparability  between  ERT  groups. 
Antibody formation might reduce efficacy, as well as it might lead to infusion-related events. Infusion-
related events might either jeopardise compliance or even render treatment impossible due to severe 
anaphylactic reactions.   
2.7.3.3.2. 
 Benefit-risk balance 
Treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease patients with velaglucerase alfa leads to significant and clinically 
relevant  improvements  in  haemoglobin  concentration,  platelet  count,  and  spleen  and  liver  organ 
volumes.  These  changes  are  sustained  throughout  the  studies.  The  observed  changes  are  considered 
comparable to those seen with the established ERT  imiglucerase.  
Assessment report  
Page 57/59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  unexpected  safety  findings  except  a  prolongation  of  aPTT  have  been  identified.  Thus  the  data 
provided indicate that the benefits seen with velaglucerase alfa treatment outweigh the risks involved 
with this treatment and that the benefit-risk balance is comparable to that for the established ERT with 
imiglucerase. Thus, the benefit/risk balance is positive. 
2.7.3.4. 
 Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Efficacy data from trial HGT-GCB-039 indicate that velaglucerase alfa 60 U/kg EOW in treatment naïve 
patients  is  not  inferior  to  the  currently  licensed  imiglucerase  as  assessed  by  increases  in  Hgb  and 
platelet count and decreases in liver and spleen volumes. Data from supportive studies are in line with 
the  findings  in  this  pivotal  trial.  Patients  transitioned  from  imiglucerase  to  velaglucerase  alfa  showed 
sustained  clinical  effects  in  Hgb  and  platelet  count.  Long  term  data  do  not  indicate  any  inconsistent 
effects in increases in Hgb and platelet count, or decreases in liver and spleen volumes. Efficacy results 
were  consistent  between  paediatric  and  adult  patients  and  no  gender  related  differences  were  seen. 
The adverse event profile is considered comparable to that of imiglucerase. Thus in consequence it is 
considered that the benefit outweighs potential risks with velaglucerase alfa treatment.  
The  absence  of  data  from  placebo-controlled  trials  is  acceptable,  placebo-controlled  trials  are  not 
considered feasible in the patient population investigated due to ethical concerns. 
In  conclusion,  the  safety  data  provided  do  not  indicate  significant  differences  in  safety  between 
velaglucerase alfa and imiglucerase. Besides the  prolonged aPTT, no unexpected safety  findings have 
been  identified  during  the  trials  conducted  with  velaglucerase  alfa.  Nevertheless  the  evaluation  is 
limited  by  the  low  number  of  patients  exposed  to  velaglucerase  alfa  in  these  trials.  This  should  be 
adequately considered in the Risk Management Plan.  
2.7.3.5. 
 Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
•  Additional pharmacovigilance planning was needed to adequately monitor the safety of the product. 
•  No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information. 
2.7.4.  Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that VPRIV is not similar to Zavesca within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
2.7.5.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  VPRIV  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  type  1  Gaucher 
disease was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation. 
and 
In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers VPRIV not 
to  be  similar  (as  defined  in  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation  EC  No.  847/2000)  to  Zavesca  for  the 
same therapeutic indication.

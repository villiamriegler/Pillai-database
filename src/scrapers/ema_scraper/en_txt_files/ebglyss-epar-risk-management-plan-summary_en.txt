Centralised 
Chemical class: 
Lebrikizumab is a recombinant antibody produced in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells. It consists of 2 heavy chains (445 amino acid residues each) and 
2 light chains (218 amino acid residues each) with inter- and intra-chain 
disulfide bonds that are typical of IgG4 antibodies. 
Summary of mode of action 
Lebrikizumab is an IgG4 mAb that binds with high affinity and slow off-
rate to IL-13 and selectively inhibits IL-13 signalling through the IL-4 
receptor alpha/IL-13 receptor alpha 1 pathway, thereby, blocking the 
downstream effects of IL-13 with high potency. Lebrikizumab-bound IL-13 
can still bind IL-13 receptor alpha 2 allowing subsequent internalisation and 
natural clearance of IL-13. Blockade of IL-13 signalling is expected to be of 
benefit in diseases where IL-13 is a central cytokine to the disease 
pathogenesis, such as AD. 
Important information about its composition:  
Lebrikizumab is a mAb based on the human IgG4 stabilised by a mutated 
Fc region. 
13-pi 
Current:  
Ebglyss is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older with a body weight 
of at least 40 kg who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Current dosage for adult and adolescent patients: 
The recommended dose of Ebglyss is 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) at 
both week 0 and week 2, followed by 250 mg administered subcutaneously 
every other week up to week 16. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who 
have shown no clinical response after 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients 
with initial partial response may further improve with continued treatment 
every other week up to week 24. 
Once clinical response is achieved, the recommended maintenance dose of 
Ebglyss is 250 mg every fourth week.

Module SI - Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s) 
SI.1 Atopic Dermatitis 
SI.1.1 Incidence 
Worldwide, the incidence of AD is not well documented. The only identified study reported an 
incidence of 6.1 per 1000 PY during 2002 to 2006 in the Netherlands (6.5 versus 5.7 for males 
versus females, respectively) (Verhoeven et al. 2008). The incidence rates for AD in Danish (born 
from 1997 to 2011) and Swedish (born from 2006 to 2010) children were 21.5 and 30.6 per 1000 
PY, respectively (Henriksen et al. 2015). 
SI.1.2 Prevalence 
The 1-year prevalence of AD among adults is estimated between 2% to 8%in the US, Europe, and 
Japan (Saeki et al. 2006; Harrop et al. 2007; Diepgen et al. 2016; Barbarot et al. 2018; Sacotte and 
Silverberg 2018). Approximately, 30% of adult patients with AD have moderate-to-severe disease 
(Bieber  and  Straeter  2015).  Table  SI.  presents  the  prevalence  of  AD  among  adults  in  various 
countries (Barbarot et al. 2018).

The 1-year prevalence among individuals aged 12 to 18 years was estimated to be 14.8% based on 
a multinational, cross-sectional survey study (Silverberg et al. 2021). Within this survey, less than 
15% patients with AD reported severe AD. In a survey of 663 256 participants aged 13 to 14 years 
from  96  countries  (Odhiambo  et  al.  2009),  the  prevalence  ranged  from  0.2%  (Tibet,  China)  to 
24.6%  (Barranquilla,  Colombia)  for  current  eczema  symptoms,  and  0%  to  5.8%  (Marrakech, 
Morocco) for symptoms of severe eczema.

SI.1.3 Demographics of the Population in the Indication and Risk Factors for the Disease 
Gender 
Multiple studies have shown a higher prevalence of AD among females compared with males. For 
example, in a multinational survey within 8 countries, females had a higher prevalence than males 
in Canada (4.0% versus 3.0%), France (4.5% versus 2.6%), Germany (2.6% versus 1.8%), Italy 
(10.0% versus 6.0%), and Spain (9.3% versus 6.1%); whereas the UK, the US, and Japan reported 
similar prevalence of AD between men and women (Barbarot et al. 2018). Despite this finding of 
similar prevalence among a Japanese population in the survey study by Barbarot et al., a different 
clinic-based study in Japan did find a higher prevalence of AD among women (9.3%) compared 
with men (5.1%) (Saeki  et  al. 2006). Additionally, 2 large population-based studies of  patients 
with  AD  in  Denmark  reported  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  AD  were  female  (61.8%) 
compared to male (38.2%) (Vinding et al. 2014; Egeberg et al. 2017a). 
Age 
The prevalence of AD among adults is well-recognised to be lower than that of children, with AD 
reported in 15% to 20% of children (Nutten 2015). Even within an adult population, the prevalence 
of  AD  decreases  with  increasing  age  (Saeki  et  al.  2006;  Wolkewitz  et  al.  2007;  Vinding  et  al. 
2014). For example, in a German study, the prevalence of AD was 5.3%, 3.9%, and 3.4% in adults 
aged 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 74 years, respectively (Wolkewitz et al. 2007).  
Race/Ethnicity 
There  is  a  paucity  of  data  describing  the  prevalence  of  AD  in  skin  of  colour  populations.  As 
reported by Silverberg and Hanifin 2013, in 1 survey study within the US that asked “During the 
past  12  months,  have  you  had  dermatitis,  eczema,  or  any  other  red,  inflamed  skin  rash?”,  the 
prevalence was  
•  7.7% among African American participants 
•  10.5% in White participants 
•  9.1% in Asian participants, and  
•  14.6% in participants reporting “other/multiracial”. 
One US-based study reported no increased odds of AD among participants who were Black or 
Hispanic,  compared  with  non-Hispanic  White;  however,  those  who  were  Multiracial,  non-
Hispanic had increased odds of AD (OR 3.36, 95% CI: 1.31 to 8.58) when compared with non-
Hispanic Whites (Chiesa et al. 2019).  
Risk factors 
Risk  factors  for  the  development  of  AD  include  a  family  history  of  AD  as  well  as  family  and 
personal history for other atopic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergies, and 
hay fever. Genetic risk factors have been suggested, particularly mutations in the filaggrin gene 
(Weidinger and Novak 2016). Environmental risk factors for development of AD include western

diets that are high in sugar and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, small family size, high education, and 
living in urban settings with low exposure to ultraviolet radiation and low humidity (Weidinger 
and Novak 2016). The presence of multiple comorbid autoimmune diseases shows an increased 
association  with  AD.  The  ORs  for  those  with  AD  who  have  1,  2,  and  at  least  3  autoimmune 
diseases, are 2.48 (95% CI: 2.26 to 2.71), 3.46 (95% CI: 2.58 to 4.64), and 5.32 (95% CI: 1.87 to 
15.18), respectively (Andersen et al. 2017). 
SI.1.4 Main Existing Treatment Options 
Pharmacologic therapies 
Topical corticosteroids 
TCS are typically the first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe AD and are effective as a short-
term treatment or intermittent long-term treatment. However, continuous long-term use of TCS is 
not  recommended  because  of  the  risk  of  local  and  systemic  side  effects  (skin  atrophy, 
dyspigmentation, and hypertension). 
Topical calcineurin inhibitors 
TCIs are considered as an alternative or adjunct treatment, especially where treatment with TCS 
is either inadvisable or not possible and for steroid-sparing in sensitive areas, such as face and skin 
folds.  
As  with  TCS,  TCI  are  effective  as  continuous  short-term  treatments  or  intermittent  long-term 
treatment.  However,  patients  with  moderate-to-severe  AD  often  need  additional  therapies  to 
alleviate their most bothersome symptoms. 
Topical JAK inhibitor 
Ruxolitinib is the first JAK inhibitor approved in the US as topical cream for treatment of mild to 
moderate AD in the patients aged 12 years and older. Ruxolitinib cream is indicated for short-term 
and  non-continuous  chronic  treatment  (Opzelura  package  insert,  2022).  Therefore,  alternative 
therapeutic  options  are  needed  for  longer-term,  continuous  treatment  to  control  chronic  skin 
inflammation in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.  
Systemic JAK inhibitors 
Baricitinib is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1, approved in Europe since 2020 for the 
treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.  
Abrocitinib and upadacitinib were approved in 2021 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD 
in adults and adolescents (12 years and older) who are candidates for systemic therapy (Deeks and 
Duggan 2021, Traidl et al. 2021). Abrocitinib is approved only for adults in the US. Additionally, 
in the US, use of abrocitinib and upadacitinib is restricted to patients with refractory, moderate-to-
severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products, including 
biologics. Their use is also limited based on increased risk of serious bacterial, fungal, viral, and 
opportunistic infections leading to hospitalisation or death mortality, malignancies, MACE, and

thrombosis associated with the JAK inhibitor class (Rinvoq package insert, 2022; Cibinqo package 
insert, 2022). 
Other systemic immunosuppressive agents 
Other systemic immunosuppressive agents are often used when topical treatment does not achieve 
sufficient control of AD symptoms. Currently available systemic therapies include non-selective 
immunosuppressants,  such  as  cyclosporine  A,  azathioprine,  methotrexate,  and  systemic 
corticosteroids.  Among  these,  only  cyclosporine  is  approved  in  some  regions  for  treatment  of 
moderate-to-severe  AD  and  its  use  is  limited  to  adult  patients.  Most  guidelines  recommend 
systemic corticosteroids for only short-term AD treatment due to severe toxicity and side effects. 
Biologic agents 
Anti-IL4/IL13 antibody 
Dupilumab is an injectable anti-IL-4/IL-13 antibody that was  approved as the first biologic for 
moderate-to-severe AD in 2017. Dupilumab is currently indicated in the US for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe AD in adult and paediatric patients aged 6 months and older and in the EU for 
the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
or severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 11 years old.  
Anti-IL13 antibody 
Tralokinumab is an injectable anti-IL-13 antibody that was approved in 2021 for adult patients 
with moderate-to-severe AD. 
Dupilumab and tralokinumab are effective treatments for some patients while others may show a 
limited or partial response or even no response at all to treatment. Some patients may show an 
initial response to treatment and loose response over time. 
SI.1.5 Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Population, Including Mortality and 
Morbidity 
AD is a disease more commonly associated with infancy and childhood; however, it is prevalent 
among adults as well. Among adult patients with AD, approximately 80% are relapsing-remitting 
disease from childhood, whereas an estimated 20% are new onset in adulthood (Akdis et al. 2006; 
Garmhausen et al. 2013). Approximately 30% of the patients with AD have moderate-to-severe 
disease (Bieber and Straeter 2015). The proportion of AD cases that are severe increases with age 
(Silverberg and Simpson 2014), resulting in moderate-to-severe AD being more prevalent among 
adult patients than children. For example, a Danish study on adult patients with AD found that 
58.2% of the patients had severe disease (Egeberg et al. 2017a). 
Depending on age of onset and disease course, atopy signs and concomitant atopic diseases may 
differ  significantly  (Garmhausen  et  al.  2013).  Patients  experience  significant  morbidity  from 
moderate-to-severe  AD  including  skin  lesions,  intractable  pruritus,  sleep  disturbance,  and  skin 
pain (Weidinger and Novak 2016; Vakharia et al. 2017). The persistent itch-scratch cycle can have 
substantial impacts on physical, emotional, and quality of life measures (Augustin et al. 2022). A

study of adults with moderate-to-severe AD found 21.8% of the patients had clinically relevant 
anxiety or depression. In severe AD, 100% of the patients had borderline and/or abnormal Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale scores. Furthermore, patients with AD have an increased risk of 
bacterial and viral infections, both cutaneous and non-cutaneous, due to defective skin barrier and 
immunologic dysregulation (Langan et al. 2017). Approximately, 70% of the patients with active 
AD  have  colonisation  with  Staphylococcus  aureus  (Clausen  et  al.  2017).  The  prevalence  of 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus is significantly higher among patients with moderate-to-severe AD 
compared to those with mild AD (90% versus 10%) (Ong and Leung 2016). There is a significant 
association between moderate-to-severe AD and occurrence of depression, anxiety, and suicidal 
ideation (Ronnstad et al. 2018; Thyssen 2018a).  
AD is not a life-threatening condition and until recently, there had been no published research on 
the impact, if any, on mortality. However, some studies have shown that while the absolute risk of 
death is very low, there may be a modestly increased risk of death among adult patients with AD 
compared with a general population (HR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.44 [Egeberg et al. 2017b] and 
HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.45 [Thyssen et al. 2018b]). The mortality rate among patients with 
AD was 0.579 per 100 PY (95% CI: 0.511 to 0.656) (Thyssen et al. 2018b).

The odds of having food allergy among adults with AD compared with the 
general population increases with increasing AD severity. Among those 
with moderate AD, the RR was reported as 2.40 (95% CI: 1.54 to 3.27) 
and among those with severe AD, the RR was reported as 8.49 (95% CI: 
5.44  to  11.54)  (Davis  et  al.  2022).  The  prevalence  of  food  allergy  in 
patients with AD is reported as follows:

Patients  with  AD  have  dramatically  increased  odds  of  being  colonised 
with S. aureus than controls on lesion skin (OR = 19.74, 95% CI: 10.88 to 
35.81) (Totte et al. 2016). The prevalence of skin infections in patients 
with AD is reported as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
S.  aureus  colonisation  73%  to  77.5%  (Germany;  Thum  et  al. 
2013; Ong and Leung 2016; Clausen et al. 2017) 
70% for lesional skin, 39% non-lesional skin, 62% for the nose 
(multinational, meta-analysis; Totte et al. 2016) 
19%  bacterial  infections  (impetiginised  eczema,  folliculitis, 
cellulitis)  and  3%  viral  infections  (eczema  herpeticum,  viral 
warts, molluscum contagiosum) (Singapore; Tay et al. 1999) 
Herpes simplex virus infections are more than twice as common among 
patients with AD compared with general population controls (Davis et al. 
2022). The prevalence of herpes infections in patients with AD is reported 
as follows: 
•  Eczema herpeticum 2% to 3% (Leung 2013; Blauvelt et al. 2017) 
According  to  a  recent  guideline  from  the  American  Academy  of 
Dermatology (Davis et al. 2022), there is mounting evidence for a small 
association  between  AD  and  various  CV  conditions.  For  stroke, 
myocardial infarction, and CV death, there may be a severity gradient with 
uncertain risk for adults with mild AD and potentially increased risk in 
adults with severe AD (Davis et al 2022). The incidence rate of various 
cardiac outcomes in patients with AD is reported as follows: 
Stroke 
• 
0.27  per  100  PY  (Denmark;  Andersen  et  al.  2016)  (UK; 
Silverwood et al. 2018) 
Myocardial infarction

CV Death 
• 
0.29 to 0.44 per 100 PY (Denmark; Andersen et al. 2016) (UK; 
Silverwood et al. 2018) 
Data  for  skin  cancers,  including  melanoma  and  non-melanoma  skin 
cancers,  are  mixed,  with  some  literature  suggesting  increased  risks  for 
adults with AD, and others suggesting no risk (Andersen et al. 2017; Paller 
et  al.  2018).  The  incidence  rate  of  skin  cancer  in  patients  with  AD  is 
reported as follows:

Prevalence  of  CTCL  and  mycosis  fungoides  is  not  directly  available 
within an AD population. There is a slightly increased risk of lymphoma 
in  adults  with  AD,  with  severity  of  AD  as  a  significant  risk  factor 
(Legendre  et  al.  2015;  Paller  et  al.  2018;  Mansfield  et  al.  2020).  For 
example, the risk of NHL in patients with AD increased with increasing 
severity versus those without AD (HR = 1.06 for mild AD, HR = 1.24 for 
moderate AD, HR = 2.08 for severe AD) (Mansfield et al. 2020). 
•  CTCL is a relatively rare subtype of NHL, comprising 2% to 3% 
of all NHL cases (Phan et al. 2016)

Module SII – Non-clinical Part of the Safety Specification 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage: 
SII.1 Toxicity 
Repeat-Dose toxicity 
Non-clinical toxicity findings attributed to lebrikizumab and of potential clinical significance were 
limited to subcutaneous ISRs. Swelling in the area of injection was identified in 1 monkey and did 
not worsen with repeated dosing.  
ISRs were reported with a low frequency (3.1%) in lebrikizumab-treated patients across all AD 
studies.  All  events  were  non-serious  and  most  patients  (94.3%)  reported  events  with  mild  or 
moderate severity. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies of lebrikizumab have not been conducted. No tumours or precancerous 
lesions  were  observed  in  monkeys  that  received  lebrikizumab  for  up  to  9  months.  Among 
lebrikizumab-treated patients across all AD studies, a total of 13 (0.8%) patients reported 20 events 
of malignancy, of which 10 events from 5 patients were NMSC. All the NMSC events were non-
serious. Malignancies other than non-NMSC reported among lebrikizumab-treated patients across 
all AD studies were mostly single events with no trend in the type of tumours. 
Reproductive or developmental toxicity 
No significant effects were observed related to reproductive or developmental toxicity in sexually 
mature or pregnant monkeys who received lebrikizumab. 
SII.2 Safety Pharmacology 
No significant cardiovascular,  respiratory, or central nervous system findings were observed in 
monkeys who received lebrikizumab. 
SII.3 Other Toxicity-Related Information or Data 
Not applicable, as there were no other clinically relevant findings in non-clinical studies.

Module SIII - Clinical Trial Exposure 
Clinical trial exposure of lebrikizumab is presented from 8 clinical studies that were designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in patients with AD: 
•  one Phase 2, randomised open-label Study ARBAN (J2T-DM-KGAH [KGAH]) 
•  5 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, which include 
o 
two  Phase  2  Studies  TREBLE  (J2T-DM-KGAG  [KGAG])  and  J2T-DM-KGAF 
(KGAF), and 
three  Phase  3  Studies  ADvocate  1  (J2T-DM-KGAB  [KGAB]),  ADvocate  2 
(J2T-DM-KGAC [KGAC]), and ADhere (J2T-DM-KGAD [KGAD]) 
•  one Phase 3 long-term safety Study ADjoin (J2T-DM-KGAA [KGAA]), and  
•  one Phase 3, open-label, adolescent single arm Study ADore (J2T-DM-KGAE [KGAE]). 
o 
Additional clinical studies evaluating lebrikizumab in patients with asthma, COPD, IPF, and RHL 
have  also  been  conducted.  A  total  of  3317  patients  with  asthma  were  exposed  to  any  dose  of 
lebrikizumab in Phase 1 to 3 studies. During early phase studies of lebrikizumab in COPD, RHL, 
and IPF studies, a total of 429 patients were exposed to any dose of lebrikizumab.

Module SIV - Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials 
SIV.1 Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development Programme 
Criterion:  Patients  younger  than  12  years  and  adolescent  patients  (12  years  and  older) 
weighing less than 40 kg 
Reason for exclusion: The safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab have not been established for 
•  patients younger than 12 years, and  
•  adolescent patients (12 years and older) weighing less than 40 kg.  
To establish the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab, Phase 3 clinical trials were conducted first in 
adults and adolescents (12 years and older who weigh at least 40 kg). Additional Phase 3 studies 
in the paediatric and adolescent populations are currently planned. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?: No 
Rationale:  The  prescribing  information  will  clearly  state  that  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
lebrikizumab in children below the age of 12 years and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years weighing 
less  than  40 kg  have  not  yet  been  established.  Additionally,  approved,  alternative  therapeutic 
options  are  available  for  the  treatment  of  AD  in  these  paediatric  or  adolescent  patients.  It  was 
agreed  with  regulatory  agencies  of  the  US  and  the  EU  to  start  studies  in  other  paediatric 
populations once a positive risk-benefit in adults and adolescents aged at least 12 years has been 
established. Additional Phase 3 studies in the paediatric and adolescent populations are currently 
planned. 
Criterion: Pregnant or breastfeeding women 
Reason for exclusion: This is a standard exclusion criterion in clinical development. Although no 
significant  effects  were  observed  related  to  reproductive  or  developmental  toxicity  in  sexually 
mature  or  pregnant  monkeys  who  received  lebrikizumab,  there  are  insufficient  human  data  to 
establish the safety of lebrikizumab during pregnancy and lactation. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information?: Yes 
Rationale: Not applicable. 
SIV.2 Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development Programmes 
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions, such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged or 
cumulative exposure.

The potential for misuse of lebrikizumab for illegal purposes is not considered to be a significant 
risk,  particularly  in  the  absence  of  associated  euphoric  or  other  central  nervous  system  effects 
associated with addictive behaviour. This class is not known to produce dependence syndromes. 
In clinical studies of lebrikizumab to date, there have been no findings indicating that lebrikizumab 
causes physical or mental dependency.

SVII.1 Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
SVII.1.1 Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the 
RMP 
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the indication treated): 
•  None 
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low frequency 
and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication treated: 
•  None 
Known  risks  that  require  no  further  characterisation  and  are  followed  up  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for which 
the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered by prescribers: 
•  Conjunctivitis:  For  the  AD  Induction  Period  Placebo-Controlled  Integrated 
Analysis  Set  (AD  ALL  PC  Weeks  0  to  16),  conjunctivitis  was  reported  for  67 
(8.6%)  patients  receiving  lebrikizumab  250 mg  Q2W  compared  with  10  (2.5%) 
patients receiving placebo. All events of conjunctivitis were non-serious and mild 
or moderate in severity. A total of 3 (0.4%) patients receiving lebrikizumab 250 mg 
Q2W discontinued the study treatment due to conjunctivitis. 
For AD All Lebrikizumab Exposure Analysis Set (AD ALL LEB), conjunctivitis 
events were reported in 10.6% patients treated with lebrikizumab. Events were non-
serious  and  mostly  mild-to-moderate  in  intensity  (97.4%).  A  total  of  17  (1.0%) 
patients discontinued the study treatment due to conjunctivitis. 
•  Keratitis: For AD ALL PC Weeks 0-16, keratitis was reported for 5 (0.6%) patients 
receiving  lebrikizumab  250 mg  Q2W  compared  to  1  (0.2%)  patient  receiving 
placebo during the Induction Period. All events of keratitis were non-serious and 
moderate in severity. A total of 2 (0.3%) patients receiving lebrikizumab 250 mg 
Q2W discontinued the study treatment due to keratitis. 
For AD ALL LEB, keratitis events were reported in 9 (0.5%) patients treated with 
lebrikizumab. A total of 3 (0.2%) patients discontinued the study treatment due to 
keratitis. Events were non-serious and mainly mild or moderate in severity (92.8%). 
• 
ISRs:  For  AD  ALL  PC  Weeks  0-16,  ISRs  were  reported  for  20  (2.6%)  patients 
receiving lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W compared with 6 (1.5%) patients receiving 
placebo.  All  ISR  events  were  non-serious.  Except  for  1  patient  receiving 
lebrikizumab, all the  ISR events were mild or moderate  in  severity. A total of 2 
(0.3%) patients discontinued the study treatment due to ISR. 
For  AD  ALL  LEB,  ISR  events  were  reported  in  3.1%  patients  treated  with 
lebrikizumab.  All  events  were  non-serious,  and  most  patients  (94.3%)  reported

events with mild or moderate severity. A total of 5 (0.3%) patients discontinued the 
study treatment due to ISR. 
•  Eosinophilia: For AD ALL PC Weeks 0 to 16, blood eosinophil increased to severe 
category  (more  than  5000  cells  per  microlitre)  for  3  (0.4%)  patients  receiving 
lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W compared to 0 patients receiving placebo. 
For AD ALL LEB, blood eosinophil increased to severe category (more than 5000 
per microlitre) for 8 (0.5%) patients. 
In general, the eosinophilia was transient, did not result in discontinuation and was 
not associated with adverse events. 
•  Herpes zoster: For AD ALL PC Weeks 0 to 16, herpes zoster was reported for 5 
(0.6%)  patients  receiving  lebrikizumab  250 mg  Q2W  compared  with  0  patients 
receiving placebo. All events of herpes zoster were non-serious, mild or moderate 
in severity and none led to discontinuation. 
For AD ALL LEB, herpes zoster events were reported in 14 (0.8%) patients treated 
with  lebrikizumab.  No  patients  discontinued  the  study  treatment  due  to  herpes 
zoster. All events were non-serious and mild or moderate in severity. 
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile:

SVII.1.2 Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP 
Important Identified Risk: None 
Important Potential Risk: None 
Missing Information 1: Use in pregnant and breastfeeding women 
Risk-benefit impact: 
The current data are too limited to draw conclusions about the effect of lebrikizumab exposure 
during pregnancy and lactation in humans. 
No significant effects were observed related to reproductive or developmental toxicity in sexually 
mature or pregnant monkeys who received lebrikizumab. There were no effects on reproductive 
organs or fertility parameters assessed in sexually mature females (menstrual cycling, reproductive 
hormones)  or  males  (semen  or  sperm  analysis).  Administration  of  lebrikizumab  to  pregnant 
monkeys  throughout  organogenesis  in  an  embryo-foetal  development  study  and  throughout 
organogenesis through parturition in a pre- and postnatal development study identified no embryo-

foetal  toxicity  or  adverse  effects  on  the  growth,  development,  or  immune  system  function  of 
offspring. 
Pregnant  women  were  excluded  from  entering  lebrikizumab  clinical  studies.  Women  of 
child-bearing potential were included after agreeing to comply with protocol-specified pregnancy 
testing  and  contraceptive  requirements,  and  male  participants  were  not  required  to  use 
contraception. Pregnancies that  occurred  in  female clinical  trial participants was a criterion for 
permanent discontinuation of lebrikizumab in all studies, and pregnant  participants  and  partner 
pregnancies who consented are followed up until pregnancy completion. 
Cumulatively, there have been 1421 females of reproductive potential enrolled in lebrikizumab 
clinical trials for AD and asthma. These patients are defined by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention as females aged between 15 to 44 years. 
Across all indications, there are limited safety data on the use of lebrikizumab in pregnant women. 
As of 06 June 2022, there have been 20 pregnancies from maternal exposure and 5 from paternal 
exposure reported during the lebrikizumab clinical development programme. There has been no 
case of exposure to lebrikizumab during lactation. 
Although the risk of lebrikizumab to pregnant women with AD is not expected to be different, 
lebrikizumab will be used among women of childbearing age and there is currently insufficient 
information  to  draw  conclusions  about  the  safety  of  exposure  during  pregnancy.  As  such,  use 
during  pregnancy  is  considered  missing  information.  An  observational  database  study  will  be 
conducted post-approval as a part of the pharmacovigilance plan because of the limited data on 
pregnancy outcomes. The objectives of the study are 2-fold: 
• 
• 
to estimate occurrence of pregnancy and infant outcomes among women exposed to 
lebrikizumab in pregnancy.  
if the sample size permits, to evaluate the relative risk of the adverse pregnancy and 
infant  outcomes  among  women  with  AD  exposed  to  lebrikizumab  in  pregnancy 
compared to women with AD unexposed to lebrikizumab in pregnancy. 
Should  emerging  experience  of  such  use  in  pregnancy  reveal  clinically  significant  adverse 
outcomes  to  the  mother,  foetus,  baby,  or  all,  this  could  have  an  impact  on  the  risk-benefit  of 
lebrikizumab use in female patients with AD. 
Missing Information 2: Long-term safety of lebrikizumab. 
Risk-benefit impact: 
Moderate--to--severe AD is a complex and chronic disease requiring treatment for long periods of 
time.  The  maximum  treatment  exposure  duration  is  939  days  in  the  AD  clinical  development 
programme. Additional clinical studies to evaluate lebrikizumab in patients with asthma, COPD, 
IPF, and RHL have also been conducted. There has been no patient exposure outside of the clinical 
development  programme.  As  such,  long-term  safety  of  lebrikizumab  is  considered  missing 
information.  The  ongoing  Study  KGAA  evaluates  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of 
lebrikizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD and is a part of the pharmacovigilance plan

for further characterising long-term safety. Additionally, patients enrolled at centres in Germany 
and Poland who complete Study KGAA are eligible to participate in the ongoing, long-term safety 
and  efficacy  study  M-17923-32,  which  will  provide  up  to  2  additional  years  of  treatment. 
Cumulative data from the parent study plus studies KGAA and M-17293-32 will enable collection 
of lebrikizumab safety data for up to a total of 5 years of continuous treatment. 
If the data demonstrate that long-term lebrikizumab use is associated with adverse outcomes or 
morbidity, this could have an impact on the risk-benefit of lebrikizumab use in the context of a 
chronic and relapsing disease, which when left untreated or uncontrolled can have a significant 
impact on sleep, mood, anxiety, and social function.

Evidence source: 
Cumulatively as of 06 June 2022, there were 25 pregnancies across all lebrikizumab indications. 
Of these, 10 were reported in the AD clinical development programme and 15 occurred during the 
asthma interventional studies.  
A total of 20 women became pregnant during their lebrikizumab study participation, and partners 
of  5  male  participants  became  pregnant  during  the  male  participant’s  lebrikizumab  study 
participation. 
As shown in Table SVII., within the 25 pregnancies, 19 cases reported pregnancy outcomes, and 
6 cases were still in utero or lost to follow-up.

development and expulsion of all or any part of the product of conception before 20 weeks gestation or expulsion 
of a foetus weighing less than 500 grams. 
Seven (28.0%)  pregnancies were reported  with neonatal outcomes, all of  which were  full-term 
(Table  SVII.).  For  the  7  pregnancies  followed  up  to  delivery  across  the  lebrikizumab  clinical 
development  programme,  no  neonatal  congenital  anomalies  were  reported.  Perinatal 
complications were reported in 2 neonates, 1 developed neonatal jaundice, and 1 had foetal growth 
restriction and hypoglycaemia. 
Trimester  of  exposure  was  reported  for  19  (76.0%)  pregnancies.  In  17  of  these  pregnancies, 
exposure occurred in the first trimester of gestation. The 2 cases who reported exposure during all 
trimesters had full-term birth with normal neonate outcome.  
Although the mechanism of action, non-clinical data, and clinical trial data do not indicate that the 
safety profile of lebrikizumab is expected to be different in pregnant and lactating women, there 
are  insufficient  data  to  establish  the  safety  of  lebrikizumab  during  pregnancy  and  lactation  in 
humans. 
Population in need of further characterisation: 
Pregnant women with moderate--to--severe AD. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
The  safety  profile  of  lebrikizumab  use  in  pregnant  women  with  moderate--to--severe  AD  is 
unknown.  
Missing Information: Long-term safety of lebrikizumab 
Evidence source: 
The  long-term  safety  of  lebrikizumab  beyond  52  weeks  of  treatment  duration  has  not  been 
established through the AD clinical programme. As AD is a chronic and relapsing condition, the

long-term use of lebrikizumab may occur in clinical practice. There remains a need to obtain long-
term safety data. 
Population in need of further characterisation: 
Patients with moderate--to--severe AD receiving long-term treatment with lebrikizumab beyond 
the 52 weeks of treatment. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
It could be anticipated that with long-term use, adverse events that are infrequent or have a longer 
latency period could occur.

III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities 
Study Short Name and Title:  Observational Database Study of Pregnancy and Infant Outcomes 
among Women Exposed to Lebrikizumab During Pregnancy 
Rationale and Study Objectives: 
Pregnant women were excluded from lebrikizumab clinical trials, and if a pregnancy did occur 
during the trial, the patient permanently discontinued study drug. Developmental toxicity studies 
in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys revealed no evidence of harm to the foetus or infant.  
However, the indicated population for lebrikizumab includes women of childbearing age. Given 
the limited information available on pregnancy outcomes, an observational study is warranted in 
the post-marketing setting.  
This study aims to evaluate the safety of lebrikizumab in pregnant women and their infants. The 
safety  outcomes  of  interest  include  pregnancy  outcomes  (recognized  spontaneous  abortion, 
stillbirth,  preterm  birth)  and  infant  outcomes  (small  for  gestational  age,  major  congenital 
malformations). There are 2 study objectives:  
1.  To estimate occurrence of pregnancy and infant outcomes among women exposed to 
lebrikizumab in pregnancy.  
2. If the sample size permits, to evaluate the relative risk of the adverse pregnancy and 
infant outcomes among women with AD exposed to lebrikizumab in pregnancy 
compared to women with AD unexposed to lebrikizumab in pregnancy.  
Study Design: 
Observational cohort study using secondary data from a US-based administrative claims database 
where de-identified records of mothers and their offspring can be linked with high accuracy.

Study Population: 
The  descriptive  objective  (objective  #1)  will  include  all  women  exposed  to  lebrikizumab  in 
pregnancy (“lebrikizumab cohort”). To minimize confounding by indication and inform relative 
safety of lebrikizumab in pregnancy, the comparative objective (objective #2) will be addressed 
among  women  with  AD.  The  study  cohorts  for  the  comparative  objective  will  include  women 
exposed  to  lebrikizumab  with  a  diagnosis  of  AD  (“lebrikizumab  AD  cohort”);  and  a  reference 
cohort of women with a diagnosis of AD who are not exposed to an IL-13 inhibitor in pregnancy 
(“non-IL-13 inhibitor AD cohort”).

Study Short Name and Title: A long-term study to assess the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab 
in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (J2T-DM-KGAA). 
Rationale and Study Objectives: 
The objective of Study KGAA is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in 
patients with moderate-to-severe AD. 
The primary endpoint of the study is to describe proportion of patients discontinued from study 
treatment due to adverse events through the last treatment visit. 
Additionally,  long-term  safety  will  be  assessed  over  the  100-week  study  by  monitoring  the 
collection  of  adverse  events,  serum  chemistry  and  haematology  laboratory  testing,  physical 
examination, and vital signs. 
Study Design: 
Study KGAA is a 100-week, non-randomised, Phase 3 interventional study to assess the long-term 
safety  and  efficacy  of  lebrikizumab  for  moderate-to-severe  AD.  Patients  who  have  completed 
participation in 1 of the qualifying parent Studies KGAB, KGAC, KGAD, KGAE, or J2T-MC-
KGAK (KGAK), are offered the opportunity to enrol in this study.  
Two treatment regimens are assessed:  
•  250-mg lebrikizumab, administered Q2W and  
•  250-mg lebrikizumab, administered every 4 weeks.

The regimen assigned to each patient is based on the treatment received in the patient’s respective 
parent trial.  
There is an addendum Study KGAA (1) for approximately 100 patients to enrol directly into an 
open-label treatment arm for Study KGAA. These patients receive open-label lebrikizumab 250 
mg Q2W after 2 loading doses of 500 mg at Baseline and at Week 2. 
Study Population: 
Adolescent (12 to less than 18 years weighing at least 40 kg) and adult patients with moderate-to-
severe AD who completed a prior lebrikizumab Study KGAB, KGAC, KGAD, KGAE, or KGAK, 
are expected to enroll in this study. 
Study  Short  Name  and  Title:  Long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  lebrikizumab  in  adult  and 
adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (M-17923-32). 
Rationale and Study Objectives: 
The objective of Study 17923-32 is to examine the long-term safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab 
in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD. Patients enrolled in Study KGAA at centres 
in  Germany  and  Poland  who  complete  the  study  are  eligible  to  participate  in  M-17923-32. 
Cumulative data from the parent study plus studies KGAA and M-17293-32 will enable collection 
of lebrikizumab safety data for a total of up to 5 years of continuous treatment. 
The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients discontinued from study treatment 
due to treatment-emergent AEs through the last study visit. 
Safety will also be assessed based on the incidence of AEs, including serious AEs and AEs of 
special interest. 
Study Design: 
Study M-17923-32 is an open-label study to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of in adult 
and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD. 
All patients receive open-label treatment with lebrikizumab 250 mg administered every 4 weeks 
(Q4W), regardless of their treatment regimen in Study KGAA. If patient’s response is less than a 
50%  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  Eczema  Area  and  Severity  Index  (EASI50),  lebrikizumab 
dosing frequency may be increased to Q2W at any time during the course of the study; thereafter, 
lebrikizumab Q4W dosing may be resumed at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Study Population: 
Adult and adolescent (12 to <18 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg) patients with moderate-to-severe 
AD. The study is open to patients enrolled in Study KGAA at centres in Germany and Poland who 
completed the study.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan for Ebglyss (Lebrikizumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Ebglyss. The RMP details important 
risks of Ebglyss, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Ebglyss ‘s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Ebglyss‘s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Ebglyss should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Ebglyss  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Ebglyss’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Ebglyss  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  moderate-to-severe  atopic  dermatitis  in  adults  and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg who are candidates for 
systemic  therapy  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It  contains  lebrikizumab  as  the  active 
substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Ebglyss’s benefits can be found in Ebglyss’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage <link to the EPAR summary landing page>. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks 
Important risks of Ebglyss, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Ebglyss ‘s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly. 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.

Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Ebglyss is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Ebglyss  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Ebglyss. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

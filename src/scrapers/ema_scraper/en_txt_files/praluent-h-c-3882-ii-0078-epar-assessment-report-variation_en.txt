heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with 
other LDL-C lowering therapies, based on final results from study EFC14643 listed as a category 3 study 
in the RMP; this is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an open-label 
treatment period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in children and adolescents with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 8.0 of the RMP is also 
submitted. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0550/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0550/2021 was completed. The PDCO issued an 
opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0550/2021. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which includes heterozygous and homozygous forms, is an inherited 
disorder of lipid metabolism, characterized by severely elevated levels of LDL-C leading to premature 
atherosclerosis and CVD.  
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
In the current variation, a modified indication is proposed by the Applicant to include one new paediatric 
indication in paediatric patients 8 years of age and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
(HeFH) as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies, based on final 
results from study EFC14643 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. 
The claimed indication that is now under assessment reads as follows (in bold the proposed extensions of 
the indication): 
Primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia  
Praluent is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-
familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, and in paediatric patients 8 years of age and older with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  
Praluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce 
cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors:  
• 
• 
in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
For study results with respect to effects on LDL-C, cardiovascular events and populations studied see 
section 5.1. 
Epidemiology  
The disorder has a high prevalence in Caucasian populations, where an estimated 1 in 250 individuals are 
affected.  
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 8/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Defects in at least 3 different genes that code for proteins involved in hepatic clearance of LDL-C can 
cause FH. These include mutations in the gene coding for the LDL-R that removes LDL-C from the 
circulation, and less commonly, in the gene for Apo B, which is the major protein of the LDL-C particle. In 
rare cases, the gene coding for PCSK9, an enzyme involved in degrading the LDL-R (gain of function 
mutation), is mutated. Additionally, rare mutations in LDLRAP1, a protein which interacts with the LDL-R 
or STAP1 gene have been noted. In all cases, these mutations result in an accumulation of LDL-C in the 
plasma from birth, and subsequent development of tendon xanthomas, xanthelasmas, atheromata, and 
CVD. Although genetic testing is useful in the diagnosis of HeFH, it is not without limitations. There are 
patients who have clinical FH but no known genetic basis for HeFH. Five to 30% of cases of phenotypic FH 
may arise from mutations in unidentified genes or have a polygenic cause. Accordingly, this program 
allowed for patients to be included with either a clinical diagnosis or a genetic diagnosis of HeFH. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Familial hypercholesterolemia is well recognized for developing cardiovascular consequences beginning in 
childhood. Even though cardiovascular events are rare in childhood, children with HeFH already have 
functional and morphological changes of the vessel wall as illustrated by an impaired FMD of the brachial 
artery and an increased cIMT, with a progression rate for cIMT of approximately double to that observed 
in unaffected siblings. Both are surrogate markers for atherosclerotic vascular disease  and, thus, indicate 
that the atherosclerotic process has already been initiated early in childhood. Indeed, there is now strong 
evidence that lesions of atherosclerosis found in adults begin in childhood and are progressive throughout 
the life span. These findings suggest that to be effective at preventing CHD, prevention, by lowering 
LDLC, must begin decades prior to the onset of symptoms. 
Because of the high risk of progression to premature clinical CVD associated with these findings, 
paediatric guidelines recommend LDL-C lowering intervention and specific lipid targets for children and 
adolescents with HeFH. An LDL-C level of <130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) is considered acceptable and <110 
mg/dL (2.84 mmol/L) ideal for children with HeFH, or the achievement of ≥50% reduction in LDL-C. 
Management 
Available lipid lowering therapies for children with HeFH include: 
•  Statins (oral tablets): Statins has been approved for the treatment of paediatric patients 6 to 17 
years of age with HeFH. According to the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline for the management of 
dyslipidaemias, statin treatment (in combination with a heart-healthy diet) should be considered at 
>8 years of age. Statin treatment should be started with low doses and the dose should be increased 
to reach therapeutic goals. The therapeutic goal in children >10 years of age is an LDL-C <3.5 
mmol/L (<135 mg/dL) and at younger ages a >50% reduction of LDL-C. 
•  PCSK9 inhibitors (injectable monoclonal antibody or siRNA): Evolocumab, another PCSK9 inhibitor 
monoclonal antibody (mAb), has been approved for the treatment of paediatric patients 10 to 17 
years of age with HeFH. 
•  Ezetimibe (oral tablets): Ezetimibe is not indicated for the paediatric HeFH population. According to 
the labeling of Ezetrol (ezetimibe), the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe in children aged 6 to 17 years 
has not been established; available data are described in the SmPC, however, no recommendation on 
a posology can be made.  
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 9/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Apheresis is a non-pharmacological treatment option; a single treatment reduces LDL-C by 55%-
70% relative to pre-treatment levels. However, apheresis may be burdensome and limited available. 
Also, only temporal reduction in LDL-C is achieved. 
Some patients, especially those with high LDL-C, are unable to achieve recommended LDL-C levels. Not 
surprisingly, many patients with FH cannot achieve recommended goals despite using maximum doses of 
statin (in combination with ezetimibe), further emphasizing the need for additional treatment options. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Alirocumab (also referred to as Praluent, SAR236553 and REGN727) is a fully human monoclonal 
antibody that binds with high affinity to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 
binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and promotes the internalization and removal of LDL-R 
on hepatocytes. The increased degradation of LDL-Rs leads to a reduced LDL-C removal and, therefore, 
higher LDL-C circulating levels. By blocking PCSK9 from binding to LDLR, alirocumab increases the 
number of LDL-R available for removing LDL-C from circulation. Hence, alirocumab is an effective 
treatment for lowering LDL-C and reducing the risk for CVD.  
Alirocumab was approved in the EU on 23 September 2015. In the initial submission, alirocumab had 
demonstrated a substantial and consistent reduction in LDL-C (a surrogate biomarker for cardiovascular 
risk reduction) and other lipid parameters as add-on to statins, with or without other lipid modifying 
therapies (LMTs), in patients with primary HeFH and non-FH, including patients with mixed dyslipidaemia 
and diabetic patients, either as monotherapy or as add-on to their existing non-statin LMT, including 
patients with statin intolerance. 
Based on these observations, alirocumab was indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia 
(heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet in combination with 
the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other LLTs or, alone or in combination with other 
LLTs in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. At the time of the initial 
MA, a statement was included in Section 4.1 of the EU SmPC that the effect of alirocumab on 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not yet been determined, as the outcome study, ODYSSEY 
OUTCOMES (EFC11570), was ongoing. In 2018, the MAH submitted the results of ODYSSEY OUTCOMES 
study to extend the indication with the reduction in risk of cardiovascular events in adults with 
established cardiovascular disease (CVD) (EMEA/H/C/003882/II/0042). 
The current approved indication reads as follow: 
Primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia  
Praluent is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-
familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet: 
• 
• 
in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to 
reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  
Praluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce 
cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors:

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Paediatric investigation plan 
The current Paediatric Investigational Plan was approved on 31 December 2021 (Decision 
P/0550/2021).The Sponsor committed to complete the PIP by September 2023. The paediatric 
development plan in HeFH includes 2 clinical studies in children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with 
HeFH (Table 1): a Phase 2 dose-escalating study (DFI14223) and a Phase 3 efficacy and safety study 
(EFC14643) that is the subject of the present submission. 
A Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety study in children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with hoFH 
(EFC14660) has also been conducted and is referred to in this submission to complement safety analysis. 
The completed paediatric development program is in line with the approved EU PIP (PIP decision number 
P/0550/2021) as also indicated by the completed full compliance check. 
Of note, both DFI14223 and EFC14660 studies are part of the EU-PIP and have already been submitted in 
EU. EFC14643 study is also part of the EU-PIP.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The studies used as a basis for clinical data presented in this dossier were conducted in compliance with 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as required by the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. The studies 
also meet with the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki, standard operating procedures for clinical 
investigations and documentation of the Sponsor, applicable national laws and regulations and the ethical 
principles of the Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
Praluent for paediatric use 
The drug product is a solution for injection consisting of L-histidine and L-histidine monohydrochloride 
and monohydrate, sucrose, polysorbate 20 and water for injection. 
The presentation used for administration in paediatric patients 8 years of age and older is the Praluent 75 
mg, 150 mg or 300 mg pre-filled pen. The Praluent pre-filled pens that will be used for the paediatric 
population are identical to the ones that are used for the adult population.  With regards to the 
excipients, no safety issues are foreseen for the paediatric population. The administered volume will be 
1mL or 2mL per injection site , once every 2 or 4 weeks.  
With regards to needle length, the same Pre-filled pen as used for the adult population will be used for 
the paediatric population. It is stated by the applicant that due to the differences in the skin and 
subcutaneous tissue thickness between paediatric patients (8- <12 years of age) and adolescents/adults, 
the risk of intramuscular injection is higher for paediatric patients. To mitigate this risk, the applicant 
added an instruction to the Instructions for Use (IFU) for a skin pinch at the injection site to increase the 
subcutaneous tissue area prior to and during the injection of paediatric patients. This information is 
particularly emphasized for children under 12 years of age.  
A NBOp is only required if there is a change to the design or intended purpose of the device (part), or if a 
new device is introduced. That is not the case with this extension of the indication to include paediatric 
patients. The same pre-filled pen will be used and the inclusion of the paediatric population does not 
constitute a change to the intended purpose of the device, as it will still be used for subcutaneous 
injection. It is agreed with the applicant that there is no need for a NBOp for this application. 
Supplemental Human Factors Evaluation Summary for Extension of Intended User Population 
for Alirocumab Pre-filled Pen for Adolescent (12-17 years of age) and Paediatric Patients (8 to 
<12 years of age) 
The applicant has conducted a human factors (HF) engineering program for the extension of the Praluent 
(alirocumab) pre-filled pen (PFP) for treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) in 
adolescent patients (12 to17 years of age) and paediatric patients (8 to <12 years of age). This section 
contains a summary of the supplemental human factors validation study (sHFVS) conducted to support 
the indication extension and a summary of the HF engineering program with all activities including details 
of the sHFVS. 
The Praluent (alirocumab) PFP was originally developed using the design control process for the 
treatment of HeFH in adult patients administered either by the patient, healthcare professional (HCP) or 
lay caregiver. The user interface for the 75mg and 150mg Praluent (alirocumab) PFP was validated in a 
summative human factors study.  
The intent is to extend the intended users for the alirocumab PFP to include adolescent patients (12-17 
years of age) and paediatric patients (8 -< 12 years of age). 
Adolescent patients (12-17 years of age), if deemed capable by the HCP, are expected to self-administer 
the product under adult supervision and for paediatric patients (8-<12 years of age) the injection should 
be administered by an HCP or lay caregiver. Due to the differences in the skin and subcutaneous tissue 
thickness between paediatric patients (8- <12 years of age) and adolescents/adults, the risk of 
intramuscular injection is higher for paediatric patients. To mitigate this risk, the applicant added an 
instruction for a skin pinch (pinch a fold of skin at the injection site to increase the subcutaneous tissue 
area) prior to and during the injection of paediatric patients 8 to <12 years of age to the Instructions for 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report

Use (IFU). The purpose of the supplemental HF Validation study was to validate that the Praluent 
(alirocumab) PFP user interface including the IFU (including skin pinch instructions) supports safe and 
effective use in the extended user populations, self-injection adolescent patients and lay caregivers of 
paediatric patients. The 150 mg Praluent (alirocumab) PFP was used for the supplemental HF Validation 
Study (sHFVS). As both the 75 mg and 150 mg Praluent (alirocumab) doses are in a 1mL PFP and the 
tasks of use are the same for both, the 150 mg dose was used in the sHFVS. 
Study Design 
The sHFVS was conducted involving certain number of participants who were representative of the 
intended users (adolescent HeFH patients (12-17 years of age) accompanied by a caregiver, injection 
experienced lay care givers of HeFH paediatric patients ((8-11 years of age) and injection naïve lay 
caregivers of HeFH paediatric patients. Prior to the study, the critical tasks were identified based on 
comprehensive task and risk analyses. Definitions of success or failure in the user performance of each 
critical task were established prior to the study based on the task analysis and the risk analysis. 
During study execution, participants completed the following scenarios in test environment representative 
of a home environment: 
• Scenario 1a: Injection Task - IFU Use Optional. Participants were given a Praluent (alirocumab) product 
carton containing 2 PFPs and IFU and asked to perform injection into an injection pad as they would at 
home while moderator observed. Participants/participant pairs were allowed to use the IFU if they chose 
to do so, but the moderator did not mention the IFU or direct the participant(s) to use it during the 
injection tasks. If moderator observed incorrect use, the participant/participant pair moved to Scenario 
1b and asked to complete another injection using another Praluent (alirocrumab) PFP. If moderator 
observe correct use, participants moved to Scenario 2. 
• Scenario 1b: Injection Task- IFU Use Optional. Participants were asked to perform injection into an 
injection pad as they would at home while moderator observed using the remaining Praluent (alirocumab) 
PFP in the carton from Scenario 1a. Participants/participant pairs were allowed to use the IFU if they 
chose to do so, but the moderator did not mention the IFU or direct the participant(s) to use it during the 
injection tasks. 
• Scenario 2: Injection Task IFU Mandatory. Participants were given a Praluent (alirocumab) product 
carton containing 2 PFPs and IFU and asked to perform injection into an injection pad following the IFU 
step-by-step.  
• Scenario 3: Knowledge task questions (KTQs). Moderator asked participant questions related to safety 
and critical information contained in the IFU. Participants were instructed to use the IFU to answer 
questions. 
Observation and interview data were collected, focusing on incorrect use (including task failures) and use 
difficulties. After performing all the use tasks in the study, each participant was interviewed to obtain his 
or her subjective perspective on any incorrect use or other problems that occurred. The occurrences of all 
incorrect use and other use problems on critical tasks were analyzed to identify the root causes and 
determine the need to implement additional risk controls. 
Study Results 
The data generated from the sHFVS demonstrate that the Praluent (alirocumab) PFP user interface 
including the IFU can be used safely and effectively by adolescents (12-17 years of age) under adult 
supervision and by lay caregivers to administer Praluent (alirocumab) to paediatric patients 8 to <12 
years in the home environment.

Conclusion 
The study results were consistent with those of the previous alirocumab PFP human factors validation 
study for adult patient populations. Thus, the Sponsor concludes that the sHFVS data did not identify any 
patterns of use errors or task failures that would result in harm or incorrect dose administration, and the 
results of the sHFVS demonstrate that the Praluent (alirocumab) PFP 75 mg and 150 mg user interface, 
including the revised IFU, supports safe and effective use of the Praluent (alirocumab) PFP by the 
intended users, for the intended use, in the intended use environment. 
The applicant concluded from the results of the Human Factors Evaluation study that Praluent, with the 
revised Instructions for use can be used safely and effective by the paediatric population. This conclusion 
was initially not entirely supported. For paediatric patients 8-11 years of age, the injection should be 
administered by an HCP or lay caregiver. The skin should be pinched in order to increase the 
subcutaneous tissue area and to mitigate the risk of intramuscular injection. For this purpose, in the 
Instructions for use a sentence is added stating that “Pinching of the skin before and during the injection 
is required in children less than 12 years of age.” During the HF study, the most common use error 
observed was lay caregivers not pinching the skin at the injection site prior to and during the injection. In 
7 out of 15 cases the lay caregiver participants did not pinch the skin at the injection site despite being 
asked to follow the IFU. Considering the number of times that pinching was not correctly performed the 
Applicant was requested to amend the Instructions for use to emphasize further the importance of 
“pinching the skin”. In response to this request, the MAH has adapted the Instructions for Use by 
highlighting the requirement of pinching the skin in children less than 12 years. This adaptation 
emphasizes the requirement of pinching the skin and was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
The Paediatric Investigational Plan was approved on 31 December 2021 (Decision P/0550/2021). The 
Sponsor committed to complete the PIP by September 2023. 
The paediatric development plan includes 3 clinical studies in children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of 
age (Table 1): 
• 
a Phase 2 dose-escalating study (DFI14223 – “An 8-Week Open-Label, Sequential, Repeated 
Dose- Finding Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Children and 
Adolescents with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) followed by an Extension 
Phase”). The corresponding final study report was submitted to EMA through a Type II variation 
(EMEA/H/C/003882/II/0053) on 21 October 2019 and approved through CHMP opinion dated 
March 2020, without any Product Information update. 
• 
a Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety study (EFC14660 - “An Open-Label Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Children and Adolescents with Homozygous Familial 
Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)” ). The corresponding final study report was submitted to EMA 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 15/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through a Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/003882/II/0059) in August 2020 and approved through 
CHMP opinion dated 12 November 2020, with Product Information update. 
• 
a Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety study (EFC14643 - “A randomized, double-blind, placebo 
controlled study followed by an open label treatment period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
alirocumab in children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) ”) 
that is the subject of the present Type II variation. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 
9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 is involved in regulating the levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) 
protein. Once PCSK9 is secreted into plasma it directly binds to the LDL-R and promotes its degradation. 
The increased degradation of LDLRs leads to a reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
removal and, therefore higher LDL-C circulating levels. Therefore, blocking PCSK9 binding to the LDL-R 
can potentially benefit patients with hypercholesterolemia by decreasing their plasma LDL-C levels. 
The currently approved adults posology is: 
The usual starting dose for alirocumab is 75 mg administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks. 
Patients requiring larger LDL-C reduction (>60%) may be started on 150 mg once every 2 weeks, or 300 
mg once every 4 weeks (monthly), administered subcutaneously. 
The dose of alirocumab can be individualised based on patient characteristics such as baseline LDL-C 
level, goal of therapy, and response. Lipid levels can be assessed 4 to 8 weeks after treatment initiation 
or titration, and dose adjusted accordingly (up-titration or down-titration). If additional LDL-C reduction is 
needed in patients treated with 75 mg once every 2 weeks or 300 mg once every 4 weeks (monthly), the 
dosage may be adjusted to the maximum dosage of 150 mg once every 2 weeks.  
The proposed posology in paediatric patients is:

2.4.2.1.  Methods – Study EFC14643 
Study EFC14643 included 153 paediatric participants (8 to 17 years of age) with heFH who were 
randomized to receive alirocumab or placebo intervention. Among participants in the alirocumab groups, 
49 participants from the Q2W cohort (25 with body weight (BW) <50 kg and 24 with BW ≥50 kg receiving 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 16/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
40 and 75 mg, respectively) and 48 participants from the Q4W cohort (19 with BW <50 kg and 29 with 
BW ≥50 kg receiving 150 and 300 mg, respectively) had at least one PK sample collected and assessed 
during the double blinded treatment period.  
Furthermore, participants could have their dose regimen up-titrated or adjusted to 75 mg/150 mg Q2W 
at Week 12 in the Q2W or the Q4W cohort, respectively. In the Q2W cohort 11 participants were up 
titrated from 40 mg to 75 mg and 11 participants from 75 to 150 mg. In the Q4W cohort the dose of 5 
participants was adjusted from 150 mg Q4W to 75 mg Q2W and 10 participants from 300 mg Q4W to 150 
mg Q2W.  
•  Alirocumab concentration and PCSK9 concentrations 
Total serum alirocumab concentrations, as well as total and free PCSK9 concentrations were measured 
from the same PK sample. Blood samples for were collected at baseline (week 0), week 8, week 12 and 
week 24. PK samples were analysed for the determination of total alirocumab concentrations (ie, free 
alirocumab and alirocumab present in PCSK9: alirocumab complexes) using an already validated ELISA 
(REGN727-AV-11051-SA-01V3). An ISR assessment for the total alirocumab assay was performed with 
samples from the Phase 2 study (DFI14223) in the paediatric patient population. The assay met the ISR 
acceptance criteria with a passing rate of 100%, indicating that the assay generated robust data in this 
population. The PK samples were also analysed for total and free PCSK9 levels using 2 already validated 
ELISAs, REGN727-AV-11081-VA-01V1 and REGN727-AV-11084-VA-01V2, respectively.  
•  Sampling for antidrug-antibodies (ADA) 
Serum samples for ADA determination were collected at baseline (week 0), week 12, week 24, week 68 
and week 104. The ADA samples were analysed using an already validated, titer-based, bridging 
immunoassay (REGN727-AV-10014-VA-01V3). It involves an initial screen, a confirmation assay based on 
drug specificity, and a measurement of the titer of anti-alirocumab antibodies in the sample. Samples 
that were positive in the ADA assay were assessed for neutralizing antibodies using an already validated, 
competitive ligand binding assay (REGN727-AV-11083-VA-01V2). 
•  Analytical and statistical methods 
The PK of alirocumab in paediatric participants with heFH was assessed using descriptive statistics on 
Ctrough collected in the Phase 2 (DFI14223) and Phase 3 (EFC14643) studies.  
Each of the bioanalytical methods used to analyse samples from clinical studies DFI14223 and EFC14643 
were described in the original marketing application for the adult hypercholesterolemia patient 
population.  
PK and ADA samples from clinical studies DFI14223 and EFC14643 were analysed by the Regeneron 
Clinical Bioanalysis Group. PK samples were analysed for the determination of total alirocumab 
concentrations (ie, free alirocumab and alirocumab bound to PCSK9: alirocumab complexes) using an 
already validated ELISA. The LLOQ for the alirocumab assay is 0.078 μg/mL [REGN727-AV-11051-SA-
01V3]. 
The PK samples were also analysed for total (free PCSK9 + bound PCKS9 to alirocumab) and free PCSK9 
levels using two validated ELISAs. The LLOQ is 0.156 μg/mL for the total PCSK9 assay [REGN727-AV-
11081-VA-01V1] and 0.0312 μg/mL for the free PCSK9 assay [REGN727-AV-11084-VA-01V2]. 
An ISR assessment for the total alirocumab assay was performed with samples from the Phase 2 study 
(DFI14223) in the paediatric patient population. The assay met the ISR acceptance criteria with a passing 
rate of 100%, indicating that the assay generated robust data in this population. 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 17/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The ADA samples were analysed using a validated, titer-based, bridging immunoassay. It involves an 
initial screen, a confirmation assay based on drug specificity, and a measurement of the titer of anti-
alirocumab antibodies in the sample. The sensitivity of the assay is approximately 5.6 ng/mL of the 
monoclonal antibody positive control. The drug tolerance limit is 191 μg/mL of alirocumab at 500 ng/mL 
of monoclonal antibody positive control (Bioanalytical validation report [REGN727-AV-10014-VA-01V3]). 
Samples that were positive in the ADA assay were assessed for neutralizing antibodies using a validated, 
competitive ligand binding assay (Bioanalytical Validation Report [REGN727-AV-11083-VA-01V2]). The 
sensitivity of the assay based on a monoclonal antibody positive control was 470 ng/mL. The drug 
tolerance limit at 500 ng/mL of monoclonal antibody positive control was 547 ng/mL of alirocumab in 
neat serum. 
2.4.2.2.  Methods - Population PK analysis in paediatric patients with heFH (POH0925) 
• 
Studies and data included in the model 
The PK of alirocumab was also evaluated in a Pop PK analysis in paediatric patients with heFH (POH0925) 
using pooled data from 2 clinical studies (DFI14223 and EFC14643). For both studies, sparse sampling 
was used and most of PK points were trough samples. The dataset was composed of 377 PK observations 
from 140 paediatric patients with heFH.  
• 
Objectives of modelling 
The main objective of the Pop PK model was to evaluate the pop PK parameters in children and to use it 
to predict alirocumab exposures in children with heFH given different dose regimens. For each patient, 
Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-336 (for Q2W regimen) or AUC0-672 (for Q4W regimen) were estimated after one 
administration, and at steady state before and after up-titration. 
• 
Model development 
Most of sparse PK samples collected in the study being trough concentrations, it was not possible to 
achieve successful modelling based on the paediatric data alone. Consequently, although a standalone 
model was planned to be tested, a modelling strategy was implemented that used a previously developed 
adult population pharmacokinetic model of alirocumab to describe the paediatric data.  
The adult reference model was a population PK Michaelis-Menten TMDD model.  
This analysis was performed with 2799 subjects and 13717 alirocumab concentrations in adult 
participants using data from Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies covering different adult populations 
with primary hypercholesterolemia, including patients with heFH, or with dyslipidemia (described in the 
original submission). In this pooled dataset, alirocumab was administered as a single dose by IV or SC 
routes, and after repeated SC administration Q2W or Q4W, alone or in combination with various lipid 
modifying therapies. The final model used was a 2-compartment model with linear absorption and an 
additional nonlinear, saturable elimination pathway using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Age, BW, statin, and 
free PCSK9 were found to significantly influence alirocumab pharmacokinetics. 
The adult Pop PK model (POH0377, described in the original submission) was updated by including 
allometric scaling (POH0472, see Figure 1). The dataset included the original population PK alirocumab 
dataset (POH0377) and was expanded with the Phase 3 CHOICE 1 and CHOICE 2 studies, where Q4W 
dosing regimen were tested, encompassing about 3502 adults and 17 979 PK observations in total.

Figure 1 POH0472 PK model 
The paediatric data was described using a population pharmacokinetic analysis (POH0925) with Bayesian 
priors that were based on the adult model (POH0472) priors (using $PRIOR routine in NONMEM). Before 
doing so, the original POH0472 model was fitted again after removing STATIN covariate influence on CL, 
because more than 95 % of paediatric patients were co-medicated with statins. 
•  Covariates 
No further covariate search was conducted and the paediatric model was considered to be the final 
model. The final model parameters are provided in Table 3.

In the DB treatment period, one (2.1%) participant in the alirocumab group in Q2W cohort and 4 (8.0%) 
participants in the alirocumab group in the Q4W cohort had positive ADA status at baseline, before the 
first investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration. 
Treatment-emergent positive ADA responses were observed in 3 (6.3%) participants in the alirocumab 
group of the Q2W cohort. No participants had treatment-emergent ADA response with a titer above 240. 
No participants had ADA response with neutralizing status. No participants had a treatment emergent 
positive ADA response classified as persistent. 
No treatment-emergent positive ADA responses were observed in participants in the alirocumab group of 
the Q4W cohort. Among the 4 participants with positive ADA status at baseline in this cohort (ie, Q4W), 1 
participant had a positive ADA response at baseline but the ADA titer decreased over time from 120 at 
the baseline to 60 at Week 24. All other ADA positive samples exhibited a low ADA response with no titer 
exceeding 240. No participants had ADA response with neutralizing status.

None of the placebo patients had positive ADA status at any time. 
In the OL treatment period, none of the participants in the Q2W cohort reported treatment-emergent ADA 
positive response. 
In the Q4W cohort, 1 participant from the “Placebo in DB treatment period” group developed treatment-
emergent ADA response classified as transient (detected only at Week 68). None of the participants in the 
Q4W cohort reported treatment-emergent ADA response that were classified as persistent. 
No participants had ADA response with neutralizing status. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to PCSK9. PCSK9 binds to the low-
density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) on the surface of hepatocytes. The LDLR is the major pathway 
through which cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are cleared from the circulation and 
hepatic LDL uptake is a major determinant of circulating LDL-C levels. When an internalized LDLR is 
bound to PCSK9, this promotes the degradation of the LDLR, preventing its recycling to the cell surface. 
By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs available to clear 
LDL particles, thereby lowering LDL-C levels. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Total PCSK9 
In the Phase 3 study (EFC14643), for all dose cohorts, the total PCSK9 concentration was increased after 
the administration of alirocumab and reached a plateau at or before Week 8 suggesting that at these 
dose regimens in these paediatric patients, target saturation was achieved. Up-titration/dose adjustment 
appeared to have a limited effect on total PCSK9 levels in the study participants who underwent a change 
in dosing at Week 12 (Figure 8).

Free PCSK9 
In the Phase 3 study (EFC14643), consistent with the total PCSK9 observations, administration of 
alirocumab resulted in a decrease in free PCSK9 concentrations at or before Week 8 (Figure 9). For all 
cohorts, this decrease was maintained up to the last sample collection on Week 24. 
Up-titration/dose adjustment appeared to have a limited effect on free PCSK9 levels in study participants 
who underwent a change in dosing at Week 12.

2.4.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Although no specific PK/PD analysis was done in the present paediatric population, a PK/PD model was 
developed at the time of the initial submission in the adult population.  
In the adult population, alirocumab lowers LDL-C through an indirect mechanism requiring first a complex 
formation with PCSK9, with a subsequent increase in hepatocyte cell-surface LDLRs and increased 
clearance of LDL-C from the circulation. These latter physiological effects are expected to result in some 
temporal delay related to this underlying biology. This temporal delay also occurs in the reverse direction 
with the restoration of LDL-C upon declining concentrations of alirocumab. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) 
Evaluation of Pop PK model (POH0925) for simulation of paediatric exposure parameters 
The PK of alirocumab was evaluated in a Pop PK analysis in paediatric patients with HeFH (POH0925) 
using pooled data from 2 clinical studies (DFI14223 and EFC14643). Because most of the sparse PK 
samples were trough samples, a modelling strategy was implemented in order to inform paediatric data 
with PK structural model parameters from a qualified and updated model for alirocumab established in 
adults (POH0472).  
Instead of merging the paediatric observations with the adults Pop PK model, which would marginalize 
the paediatric dataset, Bayesian priors were used in the model development to develop a stand-alone 
model for the paediatric population. As a requirement for this approach, it was necessary to modify the 
reference model and remove the covariate statin co-medication with V2, which is not ideal as this biases

the parameter estimates of the adult model and will increase interindividual variability estimates of the 
adult model. However, the impact of removing this covariate is estimated to be low as interindividual 
estimates of the paediatric population will have enough flexibility in the model to describe the paediatric 
data. Any trends with age and bodyweight will be visible in the ETA versus covariate plots. It should be 
noted that a direct comparison between adult and paediatric simulations has not been performed with a 
single model.  
The VPC plots of the final model showed that most of the observations are captured by the model as the 
data falls within the 90% prediction interval, indicating reasonable model performance. Furthermore, the 
GOF plots of IPRED versus observations showed that the model is suitable for estimating individual 
pharmacokinetic parameters, but population predictions are biased.  
In summary, Pop PK model POH0925 is suitable for the purpose of simulating individual exposure 
parameters of the paediatric population. However, comparing paediatric vs. adults should be interpreted 
carefully as different models are used for simulating data for both populations.  
Steady state after multiple dosing 
The descriptive statistics show that steady state for total alirocumab concentrations have been 
approximately reached at week 8. The further increase in pre-dose concentrations after week 12 results 
from up-titration. 
Starting doses 40 mg (<50 kg) and 75 mg (≥50 kg) Q2W  
From study EFC14643, it can be observed that the initial Q2W doses for paediatric patients of 40 mg 
(<50 kg) and 75 mg (≥50 kg) resulted in higher alirocumab total Ctrough concentrations as the Ctrough 
observed in adults receiving the initial dose of 75 mg Q2W from MONO, FHI and COMBO studies (6426 – 
7267 ng/mL (40 mg) and 7782 – 9543 ng/mL (75 mg) vs. 3950-6990 ng/mL in adults).  
Furthermore, Pop PK simulations for the starting doses of 40 mg Q2W (<50 kg ) and 75 mg Q2W (≥50 
kg) demonstrate that the Cmax and AUC are 1.4- to 1.6-fold higher compared to the starting dose of 75 
mg Q2W in adults. Considering the simulated Cmax/AUC vs. bodyweight scatter-plots, it seems that the 
higher exposure is probably due to the weight-effect and the differences in weight between the paediatric 
and adult populations. It can however not be excluded that there are differences in the pharmacokinetics, 
other than the difference introduced by a difference in bodyweight, as a direct comparison (i.e. one model 
describing both paediatric and adult data) has not been conducted. Graphical exploration shows that any 
differences, other than by bodyweight, are very pronounced.  
Starting doses 150 mg (<50 kg) and 300 mg (≥50 kg) Q4W  
From the Phase 3 paediatric HeFH study (EFC14643) it can be observed that the initial Q4W doses for 
paediatric patients of 150 mg (<50 kg) and 300 mg (≥50 kg) resulted in Ctrough concentrations of 8630 – 
10896 ng/mL and 11823 – 16070 ng/mL, respectively. These were higher compared to the trough 
concentrations for adults receiving the 75 mg Q2W starting dose (3950-6990 ng/mL in adults, MONO, FHI 
and COMBO studies) and also slightly higher compared to adults receiving the 300 mg Q4W higher dose 
(8620 ng/mL, Choice I study). 
Simulated data show 1.3- to 1.5-fold higher Cmax and 1.3- to 1.7-fold higher AUC of these starting doses 
compared to the higher regimen of 300 mg Q4W in adults. Again, these slightly higher exposure 
parameters in the paediatric population might be due to the weight effect, as the simulated exposure 
parameters in the scatter plots follow the same trend as in adults. However, as mentioned above, it is still 
unclear if maturation factors may contribute to this effect, as a direct comparison has not been 
conducted. These effects are, however, not expected to be very pronounced.

Doses 75 mg (<50 kg) and 150 mg (≥50 kg) Q2W  
The Q2W doses for paediatric patients of 75 mg (<50 kg) and 150 mg (≥50 kg) intended for the up-
titration of the therapy resulted in higher Ctrough concentrations as the Ctrough observed in adults receiving 
the higher dose of 150 mg Q2W from the Choice I study (6730 – 20300 ng/mL and 8520 – 29130 ng/mL 
vs. 5650 - 6010 ng/mL in adults).  
Simulated data show 1.6- to 2.0-fold higher AUC and 1.5- to 1.9-fold higher Cmax of these Q2W doses 
compared to the higher regimen of 150 mg Q2W in adults. The higher exposure parameters in the 
paediatric population is probably due to the weight effect, as the simulated exposure parameters in the 
scatter plots follow the same trend as in adults. The comparison of the simulated data should be 
interpreted carefully (see above). 
In summary, comparing the observed Ctrough in adults receiving a starting dose of 75 mg Q2W with the 
paediatric population receiving 40/75 mg Q2W, the paediatric population showed a higher exposure. The 
difference in exposure was even higher when compared to the starting dose of 150/300 mg Q4W in 
paediatric patients. Moreover, the Q4W starting dose in the paediatric population showed higher exposure 
compared to adults receiving the 300 mg Q4W dose, which is the higher/up-titrated dose in the adult 
regimen. This was even noticeable when comparing 75/150 mg Q2W dose in the paediatric population 
versus the 150 mg Q2W dose in adults. Observed alirocumab steady state Ctrough versus bodyweight plots 
showed overlap of the Ctrough values between the paediatric and adults population at equivalent doses for 
the Q2W as well as the Q4W regimens. Ctrough versus age plots were only provided for the paediatric 
population, because this data was collected only for the paediatric and adolescents population with HeFH. 
Visually no effect of age on the Ctrough can be observed in the paediatric and adolescent population in the 
range of 8-18 years. Also, in the PopPK-model for adults, age was considered as a significant covariate on 
peripheral volume of distribution. However, age did not result in differences in alirocumab exposure of a 
clinically relevant magnitude as the exposures were within the exposure ranges observed across the 
clinical development program. Furthermore, no significant effect of bodyweight and age on the PopPK-
model parameters (CL, V2, V3, Km and F1) can be observed from the ETA distribution versus bodyweight 
and age plots. In conclusion, the higher mean exposure of alirocumab in the paediatrics population can be 
explained by the relatively lower bodyweight compared to the adults population. No additional effect of 
age can be observed on the exposure of alirocumab applying the proposed weight-based dosing.  
Furthermore, the paediatric Q2W starting doses resulted in a plateau in total PCSK9-levels and nearly 
undetectable free PSCK9-levels, which did not change with higher alirocumab doses (see 
pharmacodynamics (PD) section). This may indicate an excess in alirocumab and that full inhibition of 
PCSK9 was already reached with the Q2W starting dose in paediatric patients. Establishing a minimum 
alirocumab Ctrough value which yields sufficient LDL-C reduction is not possible for the paediatric patient 
population, because only an indirect link exists between alirocumab concentrations and LDL-C results. 
Alirocumab lowers LDL-C through an indirect mechanism requiring first a complex formation with PCSK9, 
with a subsequent increase in hepatocyte cell-surface LDLRs and increased clearance of LDL-C from the 
circulation. This is confirmed by alirocumab Ctrough versus LDL-C change from baseline plots in the 
paediatric population, wherein no obvious trends are observed due to the interindividual variation for the 
relationship. Lastly, also for the adults population, no minimal Ctrough and PCSK9 inhibition was defined for 
sufficient LDL-C reduction was defined. In conclusion, it is not possible to define a minimal Ctrough to 
establish sufficient LDL-C reduction for alirocumab with the current data. In order to get more insight for 
the minimal doses needed for the paediatric population, simulations were submitted of Ctrough versus 
bodyweight for the Q2W (5-100 mg in steps of 5 mg) and Q4W (10-300 mg in steps of 10 mg) regimens 
with the PopPK-model. As it is not possible to define a minimum Ctrough to establish sufficient LDL-C 
reduction due to the indirect mechanism of alirocumab, the Km-value of 8610 ng/mL from the PopPK-
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 29/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model was used as a reference line in the requested plots, which is acceptable. The simulations showed 
that paediatric patients weighing 25-50 kg need a dose of 40-70 mg Q2W or 110-210 mg Q4W for Ctrough 
above the Km-value. Patients weighing 50-80 kg need a dose of 70-100 mg Q2W or 210-300 mg Q4W. 
The simulations may support the need for up-titrated doses (see also Clinical part of AR), as fixed doses 
of 150 mg Q4W for patients <50 kg and 300 mg Q4W ≥50 kg, may be not sufficient to establish Ctrough 
levels above the Km-value for patients in the higher end of the bodyweight categories. Nevertheless, as 
discussed earlier, there is no direct link between Ctrough levels of alirocumab and LDL-C reduction. Using 
the threshold value of 8610 ng/mL (Km-value in the PopPK-model), because it is not possible to define a 
minimum Ctrough to establish sufficient LDL-C reduction, has also limited implications.Therefore, the 
simulations should be interpreted with caution. 
Immunogenicity 
A low level of immunogenicity was observed in the paediatric population in the Phase 3 study 
(EFC14643). No participants in the Q2W or Q4W cohorts reported persistent positive ADA response or 
neutralising ADA in either cohort in the DB and OL treatment periods (ie, a positive ADA response 
detected in at least 2 consecutive post-baseline samples separated by at least a 12-week period). It was 
noted that ADA responses were observed more frequently in the Q4W dose regimen, however these were 
not neutralising. 
Pharmacodynamics 
In the Phase 3 study EFC14643, total PCSK9 concentration was increased after both Q2W or Q4W dose 
regimens and reached a plateau at or before Week 8, indicating target saturation. Consistent with the 
total PCSK9 finding, administration of alirocumab resulted in a decrease in free PCSK9 concentration at or 
before Week 8, and the subsequent decrease in LDL-C (see clinical efficacy section),  which was 
maintained up to the last sample collection on Week 24.  
According to Figure 8 and Figure 9, dose up-titration at Week 12 seems to have a limited effect on both 
total and free PCSK9 levels and LDL-C levels (see efficacy section). Nevertheless, the absolute data at the 
different time points showed that subjects who received up-titration had stronger PCSK9 inhibition than 
prior up-titration. For the Q4W regimen (currently proposed starting regimen in the SmPC) in the dose-
adjusted  paediatric subjects, the mean (SD) free PCSK9 level was 123.0 (61.5) ng/mL at baseline and 
32.5 (63.3) ng/mL at Week 12, which was further reduced to 4.9 (18.3) ng/mL at Week 24 upon up-
titration. In the subgroup of subjects who were not dose adjusted, free PCSK9 levels remained stable 
between Week 12 and Week 24 (mean (SD) free PCSK9 of 39.5 (77.2) ng/mL at Week 12 versus 24.3 
(48.8) ng/mL at Week 24)(see clinical efficacy section). 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From a pharmacokinetic point of view, the proposed alirocumab doses for the paediatric population are 
sufficiently bridged to the alirocumab doses used in the adult population. 
Similar to the adult population, the proof of concept of alirocumab in inhibition of PCSK9, as measured by 
an increase in total PCSK9, a decrease in free PCSK9, and the subsequent decrease in LDL-C has 
sufficiently been demonstrated in the paediatric population.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Phase 2 dose finding study (DFI14223) 
Study DFI14223 - An 8-Week Open-Label, Sequential, Repeated Dose-Finding Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Children and Adolescents with heFH Followed 
by an Extension Phase 
Methods 
The open-label dose escalating Phase 2 study (DFI14223) was designed to evaluate the effect of 
alirocumab administered Q2W or Q4W on LDL-C levels after 8 weeks of treatment in participants with 
HeFH aged 8 to 17 years, with LDL-C ≥ 3.37 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) on optimal stable daily dose of statin 
therapy ± other LMTs or a stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins, for at least 4 
weeks prior to the screening period. Diagnosis of HeFH was performed through genotyping or clinical 
criteria based on Simon Broome criteria for possible or definite FH.  
There was a sequential enrollment into 4 separate and independent cohorts, Cohorts 1 to 4. The choice of 
the doses in this study was based on simulations performed on the final adult population PK model 
including Phase 3 data. The model included BW as a covariate (on clearance/volume) and allowed to 
perform simulations with different BWs (POH0472). Based on these simulations, fixed dose regimen were 
defined according to BW categories < 50 kg and ≥ 50 kg. The duration of the open-label dose finding 
(OLDFI) treatment period was 8 weeks for the first 3 cohorts, and 12 weeks for Cohort 4. Each 
independent cohort below included approximately 10 patients with no less than 4 patients in each BW 
category: 
•  Cohort 1 received 30 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg (n=4) and 50 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg (n=6). 
•  Cohort 2 received 40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg (n=4) and 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg (n=6). 
•  Cohort 3 received 75 mg Q4W for BW <50 kg (n=6) and 150 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg (n=5). 
•  Cohort 4 received 150 mg Q4W for BW <50 kg (n=6) and 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg (n=5). 
To note: Given inconclusive efficacy results for the Q4W dosing regimen, an additional cohort (Cohort 4) 
had been including evaluating the Q4W dosing regimen at higher doses of 150 mg for BW <50kg and 300 
mg for BW ≥50 kg to see if an effect on LDL-C closer to the therapeutic target of approximately 50% 
could be achieved. 
At the end of the post-treatment follow-up period for Cohorts 1 to 3 and at the end of the 12-week open-
label dose-finding treatment period for Cohort 4, patients who successfully completed the OLDFI period 
(providing they had not experienced adverse events [AEs] leading to permanent discontinuation during 
the OLDFI treatment period and had no significant protocol deviations, in the Investigator’s judgment) 
were offered entry into an optional open-label extension (OLE) period. 
Pre-dose PK samples for evaluation of alirocumab, total and free PCSK9 concentration were collected at 
baseline, Weeks 4 and 8 during the on-treatment period in all cohorts, and at Week 14/16 in Cohorts 1, 
2, and 3 during the follow up period. In Cohort 4, additional pre-dose PK samples were collected at Weeks 
10 and 12 on-treatment. This cohort did not include a follow-up period.

Results 
All patients were treated with alirocumab and completed the OLDFI treatment period. All patients but one 
from Cohort 1 were included in the OLE period (patient did not want to enter the OLE period)(Table 7). 
Two patients enrolled in Cohort 4 were not treated in the OLE period: one patient discontinued treatment 
due to TEAE (neutropenia) reported at the end of the OLDFI period and one patient was erroneously 
registered and not treated in the OLE phase (patient did not want to enter the OLE period). 
In the OLE period, 3 patients (all in Cohort 1) did not complete the OLE study treatment period: one 
patient discontinued the treatment due to AE (fatigue) and 2 patients discontinued due to other reason 
(patient’s decisions).

In Cohort 1 evaluating the lower Q2W doses  showed an overall LS mean [SE] percent change from 
baseline to Week 8 of -21.2% [7.9](Table 8). The response was not consistent across the doses by the 
BW category with a reduction in calculated LDLC of -41.1% (12.6) with the 30 mg Q2W dose for BW <50 
kg and of -7.9% (10.3) with the 50 mg Q2W dose for BW ≥50 kg.  
In Cohort 2 evaluating the Q2W dosing regimen, LS mean [SE] percent change from baseline to week 8 
showed a reduction of -46.1% [8.3]; with a reduction observed in both BW categories (LS mean [SE] of -
40.6% [13.2] with 40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg, and -49.8% [10.6] with 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg). 
In Cohort 3 evaluating the Q4W dosing regimen, overall, the LS mean [SE] percent change from baseline 
to Week 8 in calculated LDL-C was moderate (-7.8% [7.6]). The response was also not consistent across 
the 2 doses by the BW category with a reduction of -17.5% (10.3) with the 75 mg Q4W dose for BW <50 
kg and an increase in calculated LDL-C of 4.0% (11.2) with the 150 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg. 
In Cohort 4, which was implemented subsequent to the other cohorts to further evaluate the Q4W dosing 
regimen, a clinically meaningful reduction in calculated LDL-C was observed (LS mean [SE] percent 
change from baseline to Week 8 of -44.5% [7.6]). Reductions were observed in both BW categories with 
a higher effect observed with 300 mg Q4W: 31.9% [10.3] with the 150 mg Q4W dose for BW <50 kg, 
and 59.8% [11.2] with the 300 mg Q4W dose for BW ≥50 kg. Alirocumab was well tolerated at all doses 
assessed in the 4 cohorts. Consistent results to those observed at Week 8 for the calculated LDL-C were

noted at Week 12. The LS mean (SE) percent change from baseline to Week 12 in calculated LDL-C 
showed a clinically meaningful reduction of -38.6% [5.1]. Similar to what was observed for the primary 
endpoint analysis, a greater effect was observed in the higher BW group with the 300 mg Q4W dose: LS 
mean (SE) percent change from baseline to Week 12 of -29.7% (6.9) with the 150 mg Q4W dose for BW 
<50 kg and of -49.2% (7.5) with the 300 mg Q4W dose for BW ≥50 kg.  
The high doses used in Cohort 2 (40/75 mg Q2W) and Cohort 4 (150/300 mg Q4W) were selected for 
further investigation in the efficacy and safety Phase 3 study in paediatric patients with HeFH (Study 
EFC14643).

Comparison and analyses of results across studies 
The Phase 2 study DFI14223 evaluated fixed dosages of alirocumab according to BW categories at Week 
8 (Week 12 in Cohort 4) in an open-label fashion, whereas the Phase 3 study EFC14643 evaluated dosing 
regimens including automatic (via IVRS) up-titration/dose-adjustment at Week 12 in a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled fashion. Analysis of results across studies has been made on results obtained at Week 
8 and Week 12, before any dose-adjustment (Table 9).

Analysis of clinical information relevant to dosing recommendations 
In the Phase 3 study, there was no evidence of any differential effect on LDL-C of alirocumab versus

adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH, in adjunct to optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy ± 
other LMTs or a stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins. 
The recommended starting dose will be: 
•  150 mg Q4W for children and adolescents with BW <50 kg. 
•  300 mg Q4W for children and adolescents with BW ≥50 kg. 
Dose up-titration/adjustment at Week 12 provided no or moderate additional LDL-C reduction in the Q2W 
cohort and Q4W cohort. 
The efficacy and safety of alirocumab in the paediatric patient population with HeFH were first evaluated 
in the Phase 2 dose-finding DFI14223 study. The choice of doses in this study was based on simulations 
performed on the final adult population PK model, including Phase 3 data. DF114223 was an open-label 
dose-escalating Phase 2 study to evaluate appropriate doses to be selected for the Phase 3 studies; A 
study in HoFH patients and a study in HeFH patients have been conducted and submitted following PIP 
requirements as outlined in post-approval commitments. Repeated doses of subcutaneous alirocumab 
were administered in 2 cohorts every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 2 cohorts every 4 weeks (Q4W) in children and 
adolescents (aged 8-17 years) with HeFH having LDL-C ≥ 3.37 mmol/L despite an optimal stable daily 
dose of statin therapy ± other LMTs, or a stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins, 
for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening period. HeFH was diagnosed based on genetic testing or 
following the clinical Broome criteria, which is acceptable. Patients were dosed according to body weight 
which is acceptable considering that body weight is a significant covariate on the exposure of alirocumab 
in adults (see also pharmacology section). Doses of 30 and 40 mg Q2W were tested for < 50 kg, 50 and 
75 mg Q2W for ≥ 50 kg, 75 and 150 mg Q4W for < 50 kg and 150 and 300 mg Q4W for ≥ 50 kg body 
weight.  
Overall 42 patients were enrolled approximately evenly distributed according to the different doses 
investigated and according to the body weight subcategories and thus appears acceptable. Furthermore, 
all patients completed the open-label dose-finding (OLDF) period of 8 weeks and only 3 patients did not 
enter the open-label phase, which is reassuring.  
After 8 weeks of treatment, the higher Q2W dose (cohort 2: 40 mg Q2W for < 50 kg and 75 mg for ≥ 50 
kg) showed greater reductions in LDL-C (-46.1%) as compared to the lower Q2W dose (30 and 50 mg,

respectively, -21.1%). Slight differences appear in effect according to body weight (LS mean (SE): -40.6  
(13.2) with 40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg, and -49.8% (10.6]) with 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg). For the 
monthly dosing, only a moderate effect was observed for the lower dosing (cohort 3) with -17.5% (10.3) 
for 75 mg Q4W for BW <50 kg and 4.0% (11.2) for 150 mg Q4W BW ≥50 kg after 8 weeks. Based on 
these results, subsequent dosing with higher doses (cohort 4) showed greater efficacy (-31.9% [10.3] 
with 150 mg Q4W for BW <50 kg, and -59.8% [11.2] with 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg). Overall, a more 
pronounced effect can be observed in the higher Q2W dose in cohort 2 and the higher QW4 dose in 
cohort 4 compared to the respective lower dose groups. However, some variation exists between the 
body weight categories, with greater efficacy in the ≥50 kg groups.  
From an efficacy point of view, it is considered appropriate that the doses used in cohort 2 and cohort 4 
have been selected for the Phase 3 study EFC 14643. 
In the pivotal study EFC14643, alirocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in the primary endpoint 
of percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C, with a  LS mean difference versus placebo of - 
43.3% ([97.5% CI: -56.0 to -30.7]; p<0.0001) in the Q2W cohort, and -33.8% ([97.5% CI: -46.4 to -
21.2]; p<0.0001) in the Q4W cohort. The higher effect in the Q2W cohort was mainly due to a larger 
(unexpected) increase in LDL-C in the placebo group. Dose up-titration/adjustment at Week 12 provided 
no additional LDL-C reduction in both the Q2W cohort and Q4W cohort (see efficacy main study). Overall, 
the effect size in LDL-C lowering of ~35-40% observed at week 24 in this study in paediatric subjects 
with HeFH is consistent with the LDL-lowering effect of 39% in adult HeFH patients (HIGH FH study). 
Furthermore, no differential effect on LDL-C of alirocumab versus placebo was observed between the 
Q2W and Q4W regimens and the BW categories.  
Based on these study results and given the lower patient burden associated with monthly injections as 
compared to bi-weekly injections, the 150 mg or 300 mg Q4W for BW < 50 and ≥ 50 kg, respectively, 
dose regimen is currently proposed for children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH in section 
4.2 of the SmPC, which can be acceptable. The Q4W starting regimen (150 mg or 300 mg Q4W for < 50 
and ≥ 50 kg, respectively) is a 2-fold higher cumulative monthly dose compared to Q2W starting regimen 
(40 mg or 75 mg Q2W for < 50 and ≥ 50 kg, respectively). Consequently, in the Q4W cohort, higher 
Ctrough values were observed compared to the Q2W starting regimen. However, considering that no 
differences in safety profiles between the Q2W and Q4W regimens were observed, the selection of the 
Q4W regimen is accepted. In this respect, the focus to justify the dose adjustments was primarily on the 
up-titration regimen combined with the Q4W starting dose regimen. Overall, it can be concluded that 
paediatric patients with HeFH who do not reach the recommended LDL-C treatment target with the 
starting Q4W dose of alirocumab may benefit from the proposed up-titration regimen of 75 mg Q2W for 
BW < 50 kg or 150 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg (see below “outcomes and estimation” for results and detailed 
discussion on the up-titration regimen).   
The Ctrough values with both Q2W and Q4W cohorts in the paediatric HeFH population tended to be 
higher compared with the Q2W and Q4W dose regimens in HeFH adults. However, the higher mean 
exposure of alirocumab in the paediatrics population can be explained by the relatively lower bodyweight 
compared to the adult population. No additional effect of age can be observed on the exposure of 
alirocumab applying the proposed weight-based dosing (see PK section).  
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study EFC14643 is the Phase 3 study to support the proposed indication.

Study EFC14643 -A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an open 
label treatment period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in children and 
adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  
Methods 
Study EFC14643 was a randomized, 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab administered at 40 mg or 75 mg Q2W (for BW <50 kg or ≥
50 kg) and 150 mg or 300 mg Q4W (for BW <50 kg or ≥50 kg) as a starting dose, on top of background 
lipid-lowering background therapy in paediatric population 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH. The 24-week 
double-blind treatment period was followed by an 80-week open label (OL) treatment period. A flow 
mediated dilatation (FMD) exploratory sub-study to assess endothelial function in the brachial artery was 
conducted in a sub-set of the study population during the DB treatment period. 
Study participants 
The main inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in Table 11 below. 
Table 11. Key inclusion/exclusion criteria of study EFC14643 
Study EFC14643 
Inclusion Criteria 
- Male and female children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years diagnosed with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia * inadequately controlled (see threshold mentioned in the exclusion criterion 2)** despite 
treatment with optimal dose of statin *** with or without other LMTs, or non-statin LMTs if statin intolerant 
****, at stable dose(s) for at least 4 weeks *****. 
* Diagnosis of HeFH must be made either by previous genotyping, current centralized genotyping, or by clinical 
criteria according to Simon Broome criteria. Previous genotyping referred to documented results that were 
available from prior genotyping testing supporting a diagnosis of HeFH. Current centralized genotyping referred 
to patients electing to undergo genotyping during the run-in period with results supporting a diagnosis of HeFH. 
The clinical diagnosis was to be based on the Simon Broome criteria for possible or definite HeFH. Once eligibility 
was confirmed based on prior genetic testing or Simon Broome criteria, results of elective genetic testing would 
not impact patient’s eligibility. 
** Patients who had previously participated in the DFI14223 study had already met this LDL-C requirement when 
they screened for the DFI14223 study and thus were not excluded based on LDL-C <130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L). 
*** The optimal dose of statin was defined as the stable daily dose prescribed based on regional practice or local 
guidelines or was the stable daily dose that was maximally tolerated due to adverse effects on higher doses. For 
patients not receiving the maximally tolerated dose of statin, statin intensification was to be carefully considered 
prior to randomization in this study in order to ensure that the addition of a non-statin LDL-C lowering therapy 
(ie, alirocumab) would be the next appropriate step in the management of the patient’s hypercholesterolemia. 
The highest dose of statin should not exceed the maximum labelled dose of statin for paediatric patients as per 
the local prescribing information. 
**** Statin intolerant patient was defined as the inability to tolerate at least 2 statins: one statin at the lowest 
daily starting dose, AND another statin at any dose, due to skeletal muscle-related symptoms, other than those 
due to strain or trauma, such as pain, aches, weakness, or cramping, that began or increased during statin 
therapy and stopped when statin therapy was discontinued. Patients not receiving a daily regimen of a statin (eg, 
1 to 3 times weekly) were also considered as not able to tolerate a daily dose. 
***** Before enrolling more than 2 siblings, the Investigator would discuss with the Sponsor study team. 
Exclusion Criteria 
- Children and adolescents aged less than 8 years or more than 17 years at the time of informed consent 
signature unless different local regulation applies (eg, for Russia only: patients aged less than 12 years or more 
than 17 years at the time of informed consent signature). 
Note: Patients aged of 8 to less than 10 years who had not had previous attempts to lower LDL-C by other 
means were to be excluded 
- Patients with LDL-C <130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) (ie, adequately controlled) obtained during the screening 
period after the patient had been on stable LMTs (ie, stable optimal dose of statin ± other stable LMTs, or stable 
non-statin LMTs in statin intolerant patients) treatment for at least 4 weeks 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report

Note: Patients who had previously participated in the DFI14223 study had already met this LDL-C requirement 
when they screened for the DFI14223 study and thus were not excluded based on LDL-C <130 mg/dL (3.37 
mmol/L) 
- Patients with BW less than 25 kg. 
- Patients aged of 8 to 9 years not at Tanner Stage 1 and patients aged of 10 to 17 years not at least at Tanner 
Stage 2 in their development 
- Patients with secondary hyperlipidemia (such as decompensated hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, 
obstructive liver disease, anorexia nervosa, obesity, and drug treatment [eg, isotretinoids]). 
- Patients diagnosed with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
- Patients who had received lipid apheresis treatment within 2 months prior to the screening period or had plans 
to receive it during the study. 
- Patients with uncontrolled (ie, HbA1c levels above local guidelines or equivalent) Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus. 
- Patients with known uncontrolled thyroid disease (ie, thyroid stimulating hormone levels above or below the 
laboratory’s reference range within the past 6 months that were obtained due to clinical indication). 
- Patients with uncontrolled (ie, SBP or DBP above local guidelines or equivalent) hypertension. 
- Fasting triglycerides >350 mg/dL (3.95 mmol/L) at the screening visit. 
- Severe renal impairment (ie, eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) at the screening visit. 
- Alanine aminotransferase or AST >2 x ULN (1 repeat lab was allowed). 
- Creatine phosphokinase >3 x ULN (1 repeat lab was allowed). 
General inclusion criteria seem appropriate to reflect the patients for which an indication is being sought, 
i.e. paediatric patients with HeFH. HeFH was diagnosed based on genetic testing or in accordance with 
the clinical Broome criteria, which is acceptable. The use of optimized background lipid-lowering therapy 
for ≥ 4 weeks prior to screening was another eligibility criteria. Furthermore, the LDL-C level of ≥  3.4 
mmol/L at screening is in line with the treatment goal for paediatric patients with HeFH recommended in 
the ESC guidelines for the treatment of dyslipidaemias (2019) and therefore acceptable. Patients who 
previously participated in the DFI14223 study and already met the LDL-C ≥ 3.37 mmol/L when they were 
screened for the DFI14223 study were also eligible to enroll in the Phase 3 study. This approach is 
considered acceptable since all patients completed the open-label dose finding period of the DFI14223 
study and none patients discontinued due to adverse events. Consequently no preselection based on 
tolerability exists has occurred. Moreover, the patients from study DFI14223 went through a wash-out 
period of at least 10 weeks between the last injection of alirocumab in the DFI14223 study and the 
screening lipid assessment at entry in the screening period of this Phase 3 study. This approach is 
considered appropriate. 
Exclusion criteria can also generally be accepted. Key is that HoFH patients were not to be included. 
Treatments 
The study included 4 periods: 
•  A run-in period (as needed) of up to 4 weeks (+2 days): Participants who consented to 
participate in the study but had not been on stable LMTs for at least 4 weeks or required statin 
intensification when initially seen were required to participate in a run-in period until LMT dose(s) 
had been stable for at least 4 weeks. Participants with suspected HeFH but without confirmation 
by previous genetic testing and not meeting Simon Broome criteria were also required to 
participate in the run-in period and to undergo centralized genetic testing during this period. 
•  A screening period (for all participants) of up to 2 weeks (+5 days): Participants who consented 
to participate in the study and had met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria 
after screening period assessments were eligible to be enrolled in the study. An intermediate visit 
for injection training might occur during which the participants if aged 12 years and above (or 
another designated person such as parent, etc) were to be trained to self-inject/inject with 
placebo for alirocumab after the eligibility criteria were checked and it was confirmed that the 
participant was likely to be randomized. 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 38/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A DB treatment period of 24 weeks: Participants were to be blinded to the study intervention and 
randomized to receive subcutaneously either alirocumab or placebo (in 2:1 ratio) in addition to 
their stable background therapy for one of the following 2 dosing regimen cohorts (Table 12 and 
Table 13): 
−  Q2W dosing regimen cohort: 40 mg Q2W (if BW <50 kg) OR 75 mg Q2W (if BW ≥50 kg) 
−  Q4W dosing regimen cohort: 150 mg Q4W (if BW <50 kg) OR 300 mg Q4W (if BW ≥50 
kg) 
During DB treatment period of this study, participants from each cohort (Q2W or Q4W) 
randomized to alirocumab were to receive an alirocumab starting dose based on their BW. 
Participants were to maintain their starting doses until Week 12. Dose up-titration or adjustment 
occurred in a blinded manner at Week 12, based on their LDL-C level at Week 8 (Table 12). 
−  Q2W dosing regimen cohort: continued alirocumab 40 mg or 75 mg Q2W if the Week 8 
LDL-C <110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L) OR up-titrated to alirocumab 75 mg Q2W (for 
participants on 40 mg) or 150 mg Q2W (for participants on 75 mg) if the Week 8 LDL-C ≥
110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L). 
−  Q4W dosing regimen cohort*: continued alirocumab 150 mg or 300 mg Q4W if the Week 
8 LDL-C <110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L) OR dose-adjusted to alirocumab 75 mg Q2W (for 
participants on 150 mg Q4W) or 150 mg Q2W (for participants on 300mgQ4W) if the 
Week 8 LDL-C is ≥110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L). 
*For Q4W dosing regimen cohort, participants receiving alirocumab were under a “ sham Q2W” 
regimen from Week 12 to Week 24, with alirocumab Q4W alternating with placebo Q4W, when 
applicable. Participants receiving placebo received a placebo injection every other week (Q2W) 
from Week 12 to week 24.  
•  An OL treatment period of 80 weeks: During 80 weeks of OL treatment period, participants were 
to receive open-label doses of alirocumab. From Week 24 onwards, the Investigator had to 
manage, adjustment of alirocumab dose on his/her own judgment, taking in to account, e.g., 
LDL-C level and changes in BW. However, if the Investigator considered that the up-
titration/adjustment would potentially negatively impact participants’ safety, he/she was allowed 
to exercise his/her judgement in a manner that safeguarded the safety and well-being of the 
participant. The following was applied based on changes in BW (Table 13): 
− 
− 
− 
If participant was on 40 mg Q2W, the dose was adjusted to 75 mg Q2W if BW changed 
from <50 kg to ≥50 kg. 
If participant was on 150 mg Q4W, the dose was adjusted to 300 mg Q4W if BW changed 
from <50 kg to ≥50 kg. 
For participants whose weight oscillated around 50 kg the dose was to be adjusted only 
once during the open-label treatment period. 
From Week 32, according to the LDL-C measurements and the judgment of the Investigator, 
participants might have their alirocumab dose regimen adjusted further. 
The total duration of the study was up to 110 weeks (+7 days) for each participant. The end of the study 
was defined as the last patient last visit planned per protocol.

The multicentre international double-blinded placebo-controlled design of the study is appropriate to 
achieve the primary objective of the study. The run-in/screening period of 4-6 weeks can be considered 
sufficient to establish a stable background condition. The 24-week double-blind treatment period is 
considered appropriate to provide reasonable results on the LDL-C (and other cholesterol parameters) 
lowering effect of alirocumab. After completing of the double-blind treatment period, subjects were 
offered to participate in the 80-week open-label treatment period where they will receive open-label 
alirocumab. 
A 2:1 randomization was used in this study, which is considered appropriate.  
The study evaluated 40 mg or 75 mg Q2W (for BW <50 kg or ≥50 kg) and 150 mg or 300 mg Q4W (for 
BW <50 kg or ≥50 kg), as a starting dose, with a subsequent option of up-titration at Week 12 based on 
Week 8 LDL-C values. Patients were up-titrated to alirocumab 75 mg Q2W (for patients on 40 mg Q2W), 
150 mg Q2W (for patients on 75 mg Q2W), 75 mg Q2W (for patients on 150 mg Q4W), or 150 mg Q2W 
(for patients on 300mgQ4W) if the Week 8 LDL-C is ≥ 2.85 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). The cut-off value of 
LDL-C ≥ 2.85 mmol/L for up-titration is endorsed as the specific goal in paediatric patients with FH has 
not yet been determined; LDL-C goals in paediatric patients of <110 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L), <100 mg/dL 
(2.6 mmol/L), or <130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) have been proposed.

a Primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed in the mITT population using the on-treatment

A FMD sub-study explored the absolute change from baseline to Week 24 in flow mediated dilatation of 
the brachial artery. The analysis compared alirocumab to placebo, regardless of the dosing regimen 
cohort. 
The primary endpoint of percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C is considered appropriate to 
establish the LDL-C lowering effect of alirocumab. Secondary endpoints are considered acceptable to 
provide further insight into and confirmation of the primary objective. 
A flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) sub-study explored the absolute change from baseline to Week 24 in 
flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, which can be endorsed. 
Sample size 
With a randomization ratio of 2:1 (alirocumab: placebo) for each dosing regimen cohort, a total sample 
size of 90 patients (30 in each alirocumab dosing regimen group and 15 in each placebo dosing regimen 
group) will have 92% power to detect a difference in mean percent change in LDL-C of 30% between 
each alirocumab dosing regimen group and its contemporaneously randomized placebo dosing regimen 
group, with a 0.025 two-sided significance level per comparison and assuming a common standard 
deviation (SD) of 25%. Nevertheless, in order to have a sufficient number of paediatric patients for 
properly assessing the safety and tolerability of alirocumab, sample size was increased to 150 patients in 
total (50 in each alirocumab dosing regimen group and 25 in each placebo dosing regimen group). The 
enrollment of 150 patients will allow having a safety assessment over 2 years in approximately 128 
patients, assuming a discontinuation rate of 15%. 
Randomisation 
The randomization followed a 2:1 ratio (2 alirocumab: 1 placebo) and was stratified according to previous 
participation in the Phase 2 study (DFI14223) and baseline BW value (<50 or ≥50 kg). 
The randomisation procedure is considered acceptable. Stratification factors are limited to participation in 
the Phase 2 study and baseline BW value (<50 or ≥50 kg), which is also acceptable.  
Blinding (masking) 
This study consisted of a double-blind treatment period. During the double-blind treatment period, 
alirocumab and placebo for alirocumab will be provided in identically matched PFS (with or without safety 
system, depending on the time in the study) and packaged identically which includes labeling to protect 
the blind. Each double-blind treatment kit will be labeled with a number. The treatment kit numbers will 
be obtained by the Investigator at the time of patient randomization and subsequent patient visits 
scheduled via a centralized treatment allocation system that will be available 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-
week. In accordance with the double-blind design, study patients, Investigators and study site personnel 
will remain blinded to study treatment and will not have access to the randomization (treatment codes) 
except under circumstances.

Statistical methods 
The primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints was the ITT population, defined as all 
randomized participants analyzed according to the intervention group allocated by randomization (ie, as-
randomized intervention group). Statistical analyses for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
were conducted in the DB treatment period and compared each alirocumab dosing regimen group with its 
contemporaneously randomized placebo group (i.e., of the same dosing regimen cohort, referred to as 
“its placebo group” in the result sections): 
• alirocumab Q2W versus placebo Q2W 
• alirocumab Q4W versus placebo Q4W 
Of note, Q2W and Q4W cohorts refer to the dosing regimens initiated at randomization. Efficacy 
endpoints analyzed with the ITT estimand were analyzed in the ITT population. Efficacy endpoints 
analyzed with the on-treatment estimand were analyzed in the mITT population. The primary efficacy 
endpoint defined as percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 was analyzed in the ITT 
population using a MMRM approach. All post-baseline data available within Week 8 to Week 24 analysis 
windows were used and missing data were accounted for by the MMRM model. Sensitivity analyses 
including the pattern mixture model approach were also performed for the primary efficacy endpoint to 
explore the impact of non-ignorable missingness. 
A separate model was run for each dosing regimen cohort, including the fixed categorical effects of 
intervention group (alirocumab, placebo), randomization strata, time point (Week 8, Week 12, Week 24), 
treatment-by-time point interaction and strata-by-time point interaction, as well as the continuous fixed 
covariates of baseline LDL-C value and baseline value-by-time point interaction. Throughout the MMRM 
models, each alirocumab dosing regimen group was compared to its contemporaneously randomized 
placebo dosing regimen group using appropriate contrasts, and the 97.5% CI of the difference was 
provided. 
Continuous secondary endpoints with normal distribution were analyzed within each dosing regimen 
cohort using the same MMRM models as for the primary endpoint with the corresponding baseline and 
post-baseline values. In addition, key continuous secondary efficacy endpoints with a normal distribution 
were also analyzed using the pattern mixture model for missing data as done for the primary efficacy 
endpoint. 
Continuous secondary efficacy endpoints anticipated to have a non-normal distribution (TG and Lp [a]) 
were analyzed using a multiple imputation approach followed by a robust regression model using M-
estimation (using SAS ROBUSTREG procedure) with treatment group, randomization strata as main 
effects and corresponding baseline value as covariate. For the respect to analyses of the efficacy 
parameters during the OL period, only descriptive summaries (description of change [% or absolute] over 
time) were provided in the OL population, which was defined as all randomized participants who received 
at least one dose or part of dose of the IMP during the OL treatment period. 
The summary of other endpoints was presented by intervention group (placebo, alirocumab) within each 
dosing regimen cohort. A summary by intervention group regardless of the dosing regimen cohorts 
(pooled across the cohorts) was also displayed, except for pharmacokinetics and anti-alirocumab antibody 
assessments. 
The exploratory endpoint of the FMD sub-study was the absolute change from baseline to Week 24 in flow 
mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (as determined by the central reading laboratory) regardless of 
adherence to treatment. The analysis used an ANCOVA model, with unequal variances by treatment 
group (except if convergence issue).

The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance were assessed and summarized by actual 
treatment received within the safety population. 
The safety analysis was performed on the safety population (defined as the randomized population who 
did receive at least one dose or partial dose of the investigational product) analyzed according to the 
treatment actually received. Safety analyses presented each alirocumab dosing regimen group with its 
contemporaneously randomized placebo dosing regimen group and again each intervention group 
(placebo, alirocumab) regardless of the dosing regimen cohorts (pooled across the cohorts). Analyses 
were performed separately for the DB and the OL treatment period. 
The database lock of the 24-week DB treatment period and unblinding occurred on 18 May 2021. All CSR 
results are based on the final analysis done on the final DBL of 31 August 2022. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Double-blind period 
A total of 153 participants were randomized to receive alirocumab or placebo intervention at 2:1 ratio. Of 
these, 74 participants were enrolled in the Q2W dosing regimen cohort (49 participants received 
alirocumab and 25 participants received placebo) and 79 participants were enrolled in the Q4W dosing 
regimen cohort (52 received alirocumab and 27 received placebo). Overall, in the randomized population, 
the rate of premature discontinuation of study intervention was low in both intervention groups (6.9% in 
the combined alirocumab group and 1.9% in the combined placebo group). 
Among the 74 participants in the Q2W cohort, 45 (91.8%) participants in the alirocumab group and 25 
(100%) participants in the placebo group completed the DB treatment period. Four (8.2%) participants in 
the alirocumab group prematurely discontinued before Week 24 due to “Subject moved” (1 [2.0%]), “Life 
events made continuing too difficult” (1 [2.0%]), and “Other” (2 [4.1%]). None of the treatment 
discontinuations in the Q2W cohort were due to COVID-19 related issues. 
Among the 79 participants in the Q4W cohort, 49 (94.2%) participants in the alirocumab group and 26 
(96.3%) participants in the placebo group completed the DB treatment period. Three (5.8%) participants 
in the alirocumab group and one (3.7%) participant in the placebo did not complete the DB treatment 
period. The participants who did not complete the 24-week DB treatment in the alirocumab group were 
due to “AE not related to COVID-19” (2 [3.8%]) and “Other reasons related to COVID-19” (1 [1.9%]), 
and 1 (3.7%) participant in the placebo group did not complete the 24-week DB treatment due to “Other” 
reasons not related to COVID-19 and related to IMP administration. 
A total of 32 out of 42 (76.2%) participants randomized in the Phase 2 dose ranging study (DFI14223) 
were randomized in Study EFC14643. A wash-out period of at least 10 weeks was required between the 
last injection of alirocumab during the open-label extension of the DFI14223 study and the screening lipid 
assessment at the entry of the screening period for the EFC14643 study.  
The figures below illustrate the disposition of participants in the DB treatment period of the study.

Overall, 145 participants entered in open-label treatment period, 71 (95.9%) participants in the Q2W 
cohort (46 [93.9%] in alirocumab group and 25 [100%] in the placebo group) and 74 (93.7%) 
participants in the Q4W cohort (49 [94.2%] and 25 [92.6%]) entered the OL treatment Period (Figure

Two participants entered the OL period whereas they had not completed all the dosing in the DB 
 period. Specifically, one participant missed the IMP doses at Week 20 and Week 22, and the other 
 participant missed Week 18, Week 20, and Week 22 IMP dose administration. 
Among the 71 participants in the Q2W cohort, 65 (91.5%) completed OL treatment period. Six 
(8.5%) participants did not complete the OL treatment period due to “Adverse event” (1 [1.4%]), 
“Lack of efficacy” (1 [1.4%]), “Subject moved” (1 [1.4%]),“Life events made continuing too 
difficult” (1 [1.4%]), “Subject received OL treatment until Week 102 included but the subject 
didn’t complete the visit 14/Week 104 because of family issues” (1 [1.4%]), and “Withdrawn 
from the study” (1 [1.4%]). Among the 74 participants in the Q4W cohort, 73 (98.6%) completed the OL 
treatment period. One (1.4%) participant did not complete OL period due to “Subject moved” (1 [1.4%]). 
Figure 14. Disposition of participants - Open-label period 
A total of 153 patients were randomized of which 74 patients in the Q2W dosing regimen cohort (49 and 
25  in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively) and 79 patients in the Q4W dosing regimen cohort 
(52 and 27 in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively). A high proportion of subjects completed 
the DB treatment period (91.8% vs 100% for the alirocumab and placebo group in the Q2W cohort and 
94.2% vs 96.3% in the Q4W cohort). Four patients in the alirocumab group in the Q2W cohort and 3 
patients in the alirocumab group in the Q4W cohort discontinued the DB treatment period of which  
“other” (n=2) and “due to AE” (n=2) were the most common. 
Overall, 145 participants entered the open-label treatment period (71 in the Q2W cohort and 74 in the 
Q4W cohort). A high proportion of subjects completed the OL treatment period (91.5% (65/71) patients 
in the Q2W cohort and 98.6% (73/74) patients in the Q4W cohort). The most common reason for 
discontinuing the OL period was “other” (n=5).

Compliance 
Double-blind treatment period 
The overall compliance for DB injections was defined for each participant as 100 – (%days with under-
planned dosing + %days with above-planned dosing). 
Overall, the treatment compliance rate was high among intervention groups in both cohorts. In the 
Q2W cohort, all participants in both alirocumab and placebo group had ≥80% compliance for IMP 
injections (i.e., participants took ≥80% of their injections and at the scheduled times). In the Q4W 
cohort, 44 (84.6%) participants in the alirocumab group and 23 (85.2%) participants in the 
placebo group had ≥80% compliance for IMP injections. 
The overall compliance for double-blind injections was relatively high since all participants in both the 
alirocumab and placebo group in the Q2W cohort had ≥80% compliance for IMP injections (i.e., 
participants took ≥80% of their injections and at the scheduled times). In contrast, in the Q4W cohort, 44 
(84.6%) participants in the alirocumab group and 23 (85.2%) participants in the placebo group had 
≥80% compliance for IMP injections. As such, a small difference in compliance could be observed 
between the Q2W and Q4W cohorts, however, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions since the number of 
subjects in each group was relatively small.  
Protocol deviations 
Criteria were predefined for minor, major, and critical protocol deviations by Sponsor standard 
procedures before the study start. 
Double-blind treatment period 
During the DB treatment period, no critical protocol deviations were reported, and major protocol 
deviations were reported in 51 participants overall. These deviations were sporadic with respect to 
the timing of their occurrence and were observed across intervention groups, with no apparent 
distribution pattern. 
In the Q2W cohort, 18 participants reported major protocol deviations (15 [30.6%] in the 
alirocumab group and 3 [12.0%] participants in the placebo group) (Table 15). The most frequently 
reported major protocol deviations were in the categories “Informed consent procedures” (4 [8.2%] and 
no participants), “Assessments/Procedures” (4 [8.2%] and 2 [8.0%] respectively), and “source data 
records” (2 [4.1%] and 2 [8.0%] respectively). No participants in the Q2W cohort were excluded from 
population without trial impact (disruption) due to COVID-19 during the DB treatment period. 
In the Q4W cohort, 33 participants reported major protocol deviations (20 [38.5%] participants in 
the alirocumab group and 13 [48.1%] participants in the placebo group)(Table 16). The most frequently 
reported major protocol deviations were in the categories “IMP management” (12 [23.1%] and 
5 [18.5%] respectively) and “Assessments/Procedures” (8 [15.4%] and 6 [22.2%] respectively). Among 
them, 12 participants (6 [11.5%] and 6 [22.2%]) had major protocol deviations without trial impact 
(disruption) due to COVID-19, with the most frequently reported deviation in the category of 
“Assessment/Procedures” (5 [9.6%] and 5 [18.5%]) ([16.2.2.10.1]). These 12 participants with major 
protocol deviations were excluded from the “population without trial impact/disruption due to COVID-19”. 
Regarding the major protocol deviations in IMP management, in the Q2W dose regimen, 1/25 (4.0%) in 
placebo group versus 3/49 (6.1%) in the alirocumab group had at least 1 deviation in the “IMP 
management” category. In 3 patients, 2 in the alirocumab group and one in the placebo group, the IMP 
management deviation was “IMP not stored /handled as per protocol”, however the dose was injected. In 
the third patient in the alirocumab group, IMP was administered but not as per protocol. In the Q4W dose

regimen, 5/27 (18.5%) in placebo group versus 12/52 (23.1%) in the alirocumab group had at least one 
major deviation in the “IMP management” category. Most of the protocol deviations in this category were 
linked to “Compliance below 80%”: 
• 
In the placebo group, 3 patients did not switch to a Q2W regimen following the Week 12 
visit and continued injecting every 4 weeks, leading to report major protocol deviation 
linked to IMP management due to low compliance. The 2 remaining patients, both with a 
bodyweight ≥50 kg, received one injection instead of two in a row up to Week 12. 
• 
In the alirocumab group, 8 patients did not switch to a Q2W regimen following the Week 
12 visit and continued injecting every 4 weeks, leading to report major protocol deviation 
linked to IMP management due to low compliance. Among the 4 other patients, 1 patient 
forgot to inject at Week 14; 1 patient with a bodyweight ≥50 kg received one injection 
instead of two in a row up to Week 12; 1 patient missed the second injections on Day 1 
and Week 4, and 1 patient missed the Day 1 injection. 
Through a post-hoc descriptive analysis excluding patients with a least one major protocol deviations 
linked to IMP management, it has been verified that excluding these patients had no or little impact on 
the LDL-C changes from baseline, compared to the ITT analysis: 
• 
• 
In the Q2W cohort, the mean (SD) in the percent change (%) in LDL-C from baseline were 
9.4 (21.6) and -34.1 (23.1) in the placebo and alirocumab groups, respectively in the ITT 
analysis (raw data), compared to 8.8 (21.8) and -35.9 (22.3) in the analysis excluding 
patients with major protocol deviations linked to IMP management. 
In the Q4W cohort the mean (SD) percent change (%) in LDL-C from baseline was of -5.2 
(23.4) and -38.2 (25.7) in the placebo and alirocumab groups, respectively, in the ITT 
analysis (raw data), compared to -4.6 (25.4) and -39.3 (24.7) in the analysis excluding 
patients with major protocol deviations linked to IMP management. 
Open-label treatment period 
During the OL treatment period, no critical protocol deviations were reported, and major protocol 
deviation were reported in 25 (35.2%) participants in the Q2W cohort and 15 (20.3%) participants 
in the Q4W cohort. These deviations were sporadic with respect to the timing of their occurrence.

The percentages of major protocol deviations were relatively high (30.6% vs 12.0% in the Q2W cohort 
and 38.5% vs 48.1% in the Q4W cohort for alirocumab and placebo, respectively). The most frequently 
reported major protocol deviations were in the category “IMP management” (n=3 vs 1 in the Q2W cohort 
and n=12 vs 5 in the Q4W cohort for alirocumab and placebo, respectively). The Applicant has sufficiently 
substantiated that the major deviations in IMP management had no impact on efficacy or safety. 
Additionally, the Applicant had conducted a post-hoc descriptive analysis excluding patients with at least 
one major protocol deviation linked to IMP management, indicating that these deviations had no or little 
impact on the LDL-C changes from baseline.  
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 43 centers in 24 countries/regions worldwide. Overall, 14 European countries 
participated in the study: Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. In these countries, a total of 83 patients 
were randomized and exposed in the study: 45 patients (14 in the placebo group and 32 in the 
alirocumab group) in the Q2W cohort, and 38 patients (16 in the placebo group and 22 in the alirocumab 
group) in the Q4W cohortThe first patient was enrolled on  31 May 2018 and the last patient completed 
their last visit on 5 August 2022.  
This study was a multicentre study (n=43). Considering that almost half of the subjects were from Europe 
(83 out of 153 (54%), the population is sufficiently representative for Europe.  
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol (dated 21 December 2017) was modified per 1 global nonsubstantial amendment 
(amended protocol 01 dated 13 September 2018) and 2 global substantial amendments (amended 
protocol 02 dated 02 January 2019 and amended protocol 03 dated 06 January 2021).  
To limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the study conduct, alternative methods for safety 
assessments were implemented.  
The main reasons for this protocol amendment are the following: 
• 
To enable changes in statistical analyses to reflect the sequential enrolment in the 2 cohorts of 
patients defined by the dosing regimen, since enrolment in the every 4 weeks (Q4W) cohort 
started when enrolment in the every 2 weeks (Q2W) cohort was completed, 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 54/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
To include the possibility to perform remote monitoring in the context of regional or national 
emergency such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, and 
To clarify the flexibility that the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system allows during the 
open-label extension period with regard to the dose adjustment of alirocumab. 
No amendments were made that would compromise the endpoints or outcomes of the study. The 
amendments are considered valuable and are, therefore, acceptable. The enrolment of subjects in the 
Q4W cohort started when enrolment in the Q2W was completed.  During the Phase 2 study it was decided 
to add an extra 4th cohort with a higher dose since the effect size of the other Q4W dose cohort was 
considered too low. However, due to the expected time required to conduct the Cohort 4 in the Phase 2 
study, and not to delay the Phase 3 study start, the Phase 3 study was initiated with the Q2W cohort 
only. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics at baseline were generally similar across the Q2W and Q4W cohorts except 
for gender and previous participation to the DFI14223 study. More female participants were included in 
the Q4W cohort (49 [62.0%]) than in the Q2W cohort (38 [51.4%]). More participants had participated in 
the DFI14223 study in the Q2W cohort than in the Q4W cohort due to the sequential enrollment order 
(i.e., earlier enrollment for Q2W). Among the 32 participants from the DFI14223 study, 29 (39.2%) were 
enrolled in the Q2W cohort and 3 (3.8%) in the Q4W cohort. These participants were exposed to 
alirocumab in the DFI14223 study and went through a wash-out period of at least 10 weeks between the 
last injection of alirocumab in the DFI14223 study and the screening lipid assessment at entry in the 
screening period of this Phase 3 study. 
The mean (SD) age of the randomized population was 12.9 (2.8) years (range: 8 to 17 years) with most 
of the participants (98 out of 153 [64.1%]) ≥12 years old at baseline. A total of 66 (43.1%) male and 87 
(56.9%) female participants were included in the study, most of them were White (125 [81.7%]). The 
mean (SD) body weight and BMI of the randomized population were 53.1 (19.1) kg and 21.3 (5.0) 
kg/m2, respectively.  
In the Q2W cohort, demographics and participant characteristics at baseline were balanced between 
intervention groups except for gender (Table 17): more female participants were in the alirocumab group 
than in the placebo group (30 [61.2%] versus 8 [32.0%] respectively). The mean (SD) age was 12.8 
(2.6) years. Majority of the participants were ≥12 years of age; 30 (61.2%) and 19 (76.0%) participants 
in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively. Mean (SD) body weight at baseline was 52.7 (20.1) kg 
(53.9 [22.2] kg and 50.4 [15.1] kg for alirocumab and placebo group, respectively); and roughly half the 
participants in each group (25 [51.0%] and 13 [52.0%] respectively) had a BW <50 kg. The mean (SD) 
BMI was 21.0 (5.3) kg/m2; 12 (16.2%) participants were overweight (BMI percentile ≥85 to <95) and 15 
(20.3%) were obese (BMI percentile ≥95). 
In the Q4W cohort, demographics and participant characteristics at baseline were balanced between 
intervention groups (Table 18). The mean (SD) age was 13.0 (3.0) years. Majority of the participants 
were ≥12 years of age: 32 (61.5%) and 17 (63.0%) participants in the alirocumab and placebo group, 
respectively. More than half of the participants were female: 34 (65.4%) and 15 (55.6%) female 
participants were included in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively. Mean (SD) body weight at 
baseline was 53.4 (18.3) kg (54.7 [20.2] kg and 50.9 [14.0] kg for the alirocumab and placebo group, 
respectively). More participants in the Q4W cohort were Hispanic or Latino compared to the Q2W cohort 
(24 [30.4%] compared to 4 [5.4%] participants, respectively). More participants had a BW ≥ 50 kg, but 
the distribution is similar in both groups (32 [61.5%] participants in the alirocumab group and 17 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report

[63.0%] participants in the placebo group). The mean (SD) BMI was 21.6 (4.7) kg/m2; 22 (27.8%) 
participants were overweight (BMI percentile ≥85 to <95) and 15 (19.0%) were obese (BMI percentile ≥
95). 
Baseline values for the primary efficacy parameter (LDL-C) were similar across cohorts and intervention 
groups in the randomized population. In the Q2W cohort, the mean (SD) LDL-C at baseline was 169.69 
(46.74) mg/dL and 175.29 (50.23) mg/dL (for the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively. In the 
Q4W cohort, the mean (SD) LDL-C at baseline was 176.79 (53.93) mg/dL and 176.57 (49.01) mg/dL , 
respectively. 
All enrolled participants had the diagnosis of HeFH confirmed either by clinical Simon Broome criteria or 
by genotyping. Sixty-two (83.8%) participants in the Q2W cohort and 76 (96.2%) participants in the 
Q4W cohort had the diagnosis of HeFH confirmed by genotyping. Other participants had the diagnosis of 
HeFH made on clinical Simon Broome criteria. The median time from diagnosis of HeFH to study entry 
was 4.13 years (range: 0 to 13.7 years) for participants in the Q2W cohort and 2.11 years (range: 0 to 
13.1 years) for participants in the Q4W cohort. 
At baseline, 98.6% and 91.1% of participants in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts, respectively, received any 
statin (Table 19 and Table 20). A majority of the participants were treated with maximal doses of statin 
(ie, the maximum tolerated dose of statin due to adverse event at higher dose) at baseline (71 [95.9%] 
in the Q2W cohort and 71 [89.9%] in the Q4W cohort). Other participants (3 [4.1%] in the Q2W cohort 
and 8 [10.1%] in the Q4W cohort) were reported statin intolerant as defined by protocol. Among them, 2 
participants in the Q2W cohort and 2 in the Q4W cohort were treated with statin but did not tolerate daily 
doses. 
The medical history profiles were balanced between cohorts and intervention groups. Most of the 
participants had cardiovascular history and cardiovascular risk factors (73 [98.6%] participants in the 
Q2W cohort and 77 [97.5%] participants in the Q4W cohort). Overall, 42 (27.5%) participants in DB 
period had a medical history of allergies, and the most frequent allergies were allergic rhinitis (21 
[13.7%]), pollen allergies (18 [11.8%]), and asthma (9 [5.9%]).

In general, baseline data, including age group, BW and LDL-C are well distributed across the two cohorts 
and treatment groups, which is reassuring for interpreting the data. However, in the Q2W cohort, there 
were more female patients in the alirocumab group compared with the placebo group (61.2% vs 32.0%, 
respectively). Furthermore, more patients participated in the Phase 2 dose-finding study in the Q2W 
cohort than in the Q4W cohort since enrolment in the Q4W cohort started when enrolment in the Q2W 
cohort was completed. These disbalances would likely not have a clinically relevant impact on the 
outcome.  
Overall, the study population can be considered representative of a paediatric HeFH population. HeFH 
diagnosis was sufficiently established as the diagnosis was for a large part of the population by genetic 
testing (83.8% and 96.2% in the Q2W and Q4W cohort, respectively). The mean (SD) age of the 
randomized population was 12.9 (2.8) years, with most of the patients (64.1% (n= 98/153)) ≥12-17 
years of age at baseline, whereas 19.0% (n=29/153) of the patients were ≥10 to < 12 years of age and 
16.3% (n=25/153) of the patients were < 10 years of age, which is considered appropriate for the sought 
indication, i.e. patients aged 8-17 years of age. Moreover, the elevated mean LDL-C baseline value of 4.5 
mmol/L reasonably corresponds to an LDL-C level generally observed within a HeFH population.  
The majority of the patients have received any statin therapy (98.6% and 91.1% of participants in the 
Q2W and Q4W cohorts), which is conform the inclusion criterion “Patients must receive the optimal dose 
of statin defined as the stable daily dose prescribed based on regional practice or local guidelines or was 
the stable daily dose that was maximally tolerated due to adverse effects on higher doses”. Further, 
12.2% and 24.1% of patients in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts received any LMTs other than statins, 
respectively. Other patients (4.1% (n=3) in the Q2W cohort and 10.1% (n=8) in the Q4W cohort) were 
reported statin intolerant as defined by the protocol. As such, paediatric patients who are statin intolerant 
were underrepresented. However, given the experience of alirocumab therapy in statin-intolerant adults, 
this issue is not pursued.  
Numbers analysed 
The randomized population consisted of 153 participants (Table 21 and Table 22). 
During the DB treatment period, all randomized participants were included in the ITT, mITT, and safety 
population. Accordingly, the ITT, mITT, and safety populations are identical. 
The FMD sub-study population included 28 participants (11 in the Q2W cohort and 17 in the Q4W cohort). 
The OL population included 145 participants (71 in the Q2W cohort and 74 in the Q4W cohort).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Double-blind treatment period 
The study met its primary objective: a statistically significant difference in favor of alirocumab compared 
to placebo was observed for the primary efficacy endpoint (percent change in LDL-C from baseline to 
Week 24 in the ITT population) in both dosing regimen cohorts.  
• 
In the Q2W cohort, the LS mean (SE) percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 was -
33.6% (3.4) in the alirocumab group compared to +9.7% (4.3) in the placebo group, with an LS 
mean difference versus placebo of -43.3% ([97.5% CI: -56.0 to -30.7]; p<0.0001) (ITT 
estimand), resulting in an LS mean (SE) LDL-C at Week 24 of 2.929 (0.147) mmol/L in the 
alirocumab group versus 4.820 (0.213) mmol/L in the placebo group (Table 23). Reductions 
were observed in both BW categories with a higher effect observed with 40 mg Q2W: -48.5% 
[7.6] with the 40 mg Q2W dose for BW <50 kg, and -38.0% [7.8] with the 75 mg Q2W dose for 
BW ≥50 kg (Table 10). 
• 
In the Q4W cohort, the LS mean (SE) percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 was -
38.2% (4.0) in the alirocumab group compared to -4.4% (3.7) in the placebo group, with an LS 
mean difference versus placebo of -33.8% ([97.5% CI: -46.4 to -21.2]; p<0.0001) (ITT 
estimand), resulting in an LS mean (SE) LDL-C at Week 24 of 2.847 (0.200) mmol/L  in the 
alirocumab group versus 4.177 (0.180) mmol/L  in the placebo group (Table 24). The response 
was consistent across the 2 doses by the BW category with a reduction of -34.5% (9.5) with the 
150 mg Q4W dose for BW <50 kg and -32.9% (7.0) with the 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg (Table 
10). 
Sensitivity analyses assessing the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis with regard to handling of 
missing data (i.e., Pattern Mixture Model and Multiple Imputations [under MAR assumption]), 
randomization stratum mistakes, impact of COVID-19, and excluding participants who previously 
participated in the Phase 2 DFI14223 study showed results consistent with the primary analysis.

In the alirocumab groups in both Q2W and Q4W dosing regimen cohorts, a rapid decrease in LDL-C from 
baseline was observed from Week 8 onwards (ie., the first LDL-C post-baseline assessment time point) 
(Figure 15 and Figure 16). In the alirocumab Q2W and Q4W groups, the percent changes in LDL-C (LS 
mean [SE] versus baseline) were - 35.4% (3.6) and - 42.0% (2.8) at Week 8, - 34.8% (3.0) and - 
39.2% (3.3) at Week 12, and - 33.6% (3.4) and - 38.2% (4.0) at Week 24, respectively. 
A sustained reduction in LDL-C was observed at each of the subsequent timepoints, demonstrating 
maintenance of efficacy over time to Week 24.

The between-group (alirocumab versus placebo) LS mean difference estimates in LDL-C percent change 
from baseline to Week 24 were consistent across all subgroup categories in both Q2W and Q4W cohorts 
(Figure 17 and Figure 18).

LS mean Difference and 97.5% CI
Open-label period 
In the Q2W cohort, the LS mean (SE) percent reduction of LDL-C from baseline to Week 104 was - 25.8% 
(4.9) in the “Alirocumab in the DB period” group and - 22.8% (5.1) in the “Placebo in the DB period” 
group. In the Q2W cohort, the LS means (SD) percent change of LDL-C from baseline to Week 104 was - 
26.3% (28.0) (Figure 19). 
In the Q4W cohort, the LS mean (SE) percent reduction of LDL-C from baseline to Week 104 was - 23.4 
(4.7) in the “Alirocumab in the DB period” group and - 27.6% (7.6) in the “Placebo in the DB period” 
group. Particularly, the LS means (SD) percent change of LDL-C from baseline to Week 104 was - 23.9% 
(33.5) in the Q4W cohort (Figure 20).  
While relatively large reductions of LDL-C were observed in the OL treatment period in both the Q2W and 
Q4W cohorts, the percent reductions of LDL-C from baseline during the OL treatment period were 
somewhat lower as compared to the DB treatment period. This observation appeared to be related to a 
less strict application of the rules regarding dose up titration/adjustment during the OL treatment period, 
as revealed by the post-hoc analyses. 
However, the percent reductions of LDL-C from baseline at Week 104 were associated with meaningful 
proportion of participants achieving the target of LDL-C below 130 mg/dL or reduction from baseline 
above 50%, these results are consistent with the therapeutic goals defined for the paediatric population 
with HeFH in current international guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia.

Dose modifications 
Double-blind treatment period 
Among the 74 participants who were in Q2W cohort and received at least 1 injection after Week 12, 22 
out of 49 (44.9%) participants in the alirocumab group (11 with BW <50 kg and 11 with BW ≥50 kg) had 
received automatic dose up-titration in a blinded manner. 
Among the 79 participants who were in Q4W cohort and received at least 1 injection after Week 12, 15 
out of 52 (28.8%) participants in the alirocumab group (5 with BW <50 kg and 10 with BW ≥50 kg) had 
received automatic dose adjustment in a blinded manner. 
Dose up-titration/adjustment at Week 12 provided an additional moderate LDL-C reduction in the Q4W 
cohort, and minimal effect in the Q2W cohort in participants who underwent a change in dosing at 
Week 12 (Table 25, Table 26, Figure 21, and Figure 22). 
Since the Q4W starting regimen is currently proposed for children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age 
with HeFH in section 4.2 of the SmPC, the focus to justify the dose adjustments was primarily on the up-
titration regimen combined with the Q4W starting dose regimen. At Week 24, following dose adjustment, 
an additional decrease in the percent change from  baseline in LDL-C was measured in the Q4W cohort 
(mean percent change from baseline in  LDL-C of -34.2% at Week 24 versus -26.8% at Week 12). Dose 
adjustment allowed also more participants to achieve the recommended target of LDL-C <3.37 mmol/L (9 
[64.3%] participants), LDL-C <2.84 mmol/L (5 [35.7%)] participants) and >50 % reduction in  LDL-C 
from baseline (5 [35.7%)] participants) at Week 24 (Table 1). Importantly, the safety  profile of 
alirocumab remained unchanged after dose adjustment. In participants who were not dose adjusted at 
Week 12, the change from baseline in LDL-C and  the proportions of participants reaching the 
recommended LDL-C targets were either stable or  decreased between Week 12 and Week 24. The mean 
(SD) change from baseline was -1.688  (1.081) mmol/L at Week 24 versus -1.794 (0.907) mmol/L at 
Week 12 (Table 2). The number (%)  of participants achieving LDL-C <3.37 mmol/L was 27 (84.4%) 
participants) versus 29 (93.5%) participants at Week 12, achieving LDL-C <2.84 mmol/L, 10 (31.3%) 
participants at Week 24  versus 25 (80.6%) at Week 12, and achieving >50 % reduction in LDL-C from 
baseline, 10  (31.3%) participants at Week 24 versus 13 (41.9%) at Week 12 (Table 27).

cohort 
Open-label treatment period 
Among the 71 participants in Q2W cohort, 28 (39.4%) participants had at least 1 up-titration, and 
2 (2.8%) participants had down-titration. Majority of the reasons for up-titration were “LDL-C 
value too high as per Investigator judgment” (21 [61.8%]). Mean (SD) of LDL-C values prior to 
up-titration was 156.8 (54.9) mg/dL in these 21 participants. The LDL-C value before down-titration was 
reported in one participant only and was 44.0 mg/dL. 
Among the 74 participants in the Q4W cohort, 4 (5.4%) participants had an up-titration, 2 (2.7%) 
participants had a down-titration, and 9 (12.2%) participants had dose-adjustment. Major reasons 
included “LDL-C value too low as per Investigator judgment” (5 [29.4%]), “LDL-C value too 
high as per Investigator judgment” (3 [17.6%]), “Change in body weight” (4 [23.5%]) and 
“Other” (3 [17.6%]). Mean (SD) LDL-C values prior to the up-titration/dose-adjustment was 212.9 
(123.3) mg/dL (value available in 3 participants). Mean (SD) LDL-C values prior to down titration 
was 36.7 (12.5) mg/dL (value available in 5 participants). 
Alirocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in the primary endpoint of percent change from baseline 
to week 24 in LDL-C. In the Q2W cohort, alirocumab treatment reduced LDL-C with -33.6% (3.4) 
compared with +9.7% (4.3)  in the placebo group (difference: -43.3% ([97.5% CI: -56.0 to -30.7]; 
p<0.0001), resulting in a mean LDL-C at Week 24 of 2.929 (0.147) mmol/L in the alirocumab group 
versus 4.820 (0.213) mmol/L in the placebo group. Reductions were observed in both BW categories with 
a higher treatment effect compared with placebo observed with 40 mg Q2W: -48.5% (7.6) with the 40 
mg Q2W dose for BW <50 kg, and -38.0% (7.8) with the 75 mg Q2W dose for BW ≥50 kg. This higher 
effect was mainly due to a larger (unexpected) increase in LDL-C in the placebo group in the 40 mg Q2W 
cohort compared with the 75 mg Q2W (12.5% (5.9) vs 5.6 (6.4), respectively. In the Q4W cohort,  
alirocumab treatment reduced LDL-C with -38.2% (4.0) compared with -4.4% (3.7)  in the placebo group 
(difference: -33.8% ([97.5% CI: -46.4 to -21.2]; p<0.0001), resulting in a mean LDL-C at Week 24 of 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report

2.847 (0.200) mmol/L  vs. 4.177 (0.180) mmol/L  in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively. The 
response was consistent across the 2 doses by the BW category with a reduction of -34.5% (9.5) with the 
150 mg Q4W dose for BW <50 kg and -32.9% (7.0) with the 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg. The LDL-C 
lowering effect appears generally consistent among several subgroups, including gender, age (< 12, ≥ 
12) and baseline LDL-C in both Q2W and Q4W cohorts. Regarding long-term effect, the percent change of 
LDL-C from baseline to Week 104 was - 26.3% in the Q2W cohort and  -23.9% (33.5) in the Q4W cohort. 
The effect at week 104 observed during the OL is lower than as compared with the DB treatment period. 
According to the Applicant, this observation appeared to be related to a less strict application of the rules 
regarding dose up-titration/adjustment during the OL treatment period, as revealed by the post-hoc 
analyses, which can be acknowledged. Moreover,  it is acknowledged by CHMP that the LDL-C lowering 
effect in the paediatric HeFH population is still considered clinically relevant. Overall, the effect size in 
LDL-C lowering of ~35-40% observed at week 24 in this study in paediatric subjects with HeFH is 
consistent with the LDL-lowering effect of -39% in adult HeFH patients (HIGH FH study). Furthermore, no 
differential effect on LDL-C of alirocumab was observed between the Q2W and Q4W regimens and the BW 
categories. 
Regarding dose titration, in the Q2W cohort, almost half of the patients in the alirocumab group (22 out 
of 49 (44.9%); 11 with BW <50 kg and 11 with BW ≥50 kg) received dose up-titration at Week 12. In 
the Q4W cohort, 15 out of 52 (28.8%) patients were in the alirocumab group (with BW <50 kg and 10 
with BW ≥50 kg) at Week 12. The study showed that patients who needed a dose up-titration had a 
higher mean baseline LDL-C value than patients who did not require a dose up-titration (4.99 vs. 3.91 
mmol/L and 5.75 vs 3.99 mmol/L in the Q2W and Q4W cohort respectively). The dose was up-titrated at 
Week 12 based on LDL-C levels measured at Week 8. Dose up-titration at Week 12 provided an additional 
moderate LDL-C reduction in the Q4W cohort, and minimal/ no effect in the Q2W cohort in participants 
who underwent a change in dosing at Week 12. Since the Q4W starting regimen is currently proposed for 
children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH in section 4.2 of the SmPC, the focus to justify 
the dose adjustments was primarily on the up-titration regimen combined with the Q4W starting dose 
regimen. At Week 24, following dose adjustment, an additional decrease in the percent change from 
baseline LDL-C compared with Week 12 was measured in the Q4W cohort (-34.2% versus -26.8%, 
respectively), however compared with Week 8 there was no additional decrease  (-34.2% at Week 24 
versus -33.8% at Week 8). Although this observation can possibly be explained by the differences in 
sample size at the different time points ( n=13 at Week 8 vs n=14 at Week 12 and Week 24), no 
discussion on this observation has been provided. Instead, the Applicant has highlighted the paediatric 
patients which had additional benefit with the up-titration step by referring to the secondary endpoints of 
proportion of patients achieving a LDL-C level lower than 3.37 mmol/L or  2.84 mmol/L, and > 50% 
reduction in LDL-C at Week 12 (prior to up-titration) vs. Week 24 (after up-titration). The results showed 
that up-titration allowed more patients to achieve the recommended target of LDL-C <3.37 mmol/L (n=9 
(64.3%) vs. n=5 (35.7%) prior up-titration at Week 12), LDL-C <2.84 mmol/L (n=5 (35.7%) vs. n=2 
(14.3%) prior up-titration) and >50 % reduction in LDL-C from baseline (n=5 (35.7%) vs. n=2 (14.3%) 
prior up-titration), whereas in paediatric patients who were not dose adjusted at Week 12, the 
proportions of subjects reaching the recommended LDL-C targets were decreased between Week 12 and 
Week 24. Additionally, the results showed that patients who received up-titration had stronger PCSK9 
inhibition than prior up-titration. In the dose-adjusted  paediatric subjects, mean (SD) free PCSK9 level 
was 32.5 (63.3) ng/mL at Week 12, compared to 123.0 (61.5) ng/mL at baseline. Following dose up-
titration, the mean free PCSK9 level was further reduced to 4.9 (18.3) ng/mL at Week 24. Of note, PCSK9 
levels were not entirely consistent with LDL-C effect likely due to statin interference. 
Furthermore, the proposed dose titration is in line with the dose up-titration already approved in adult 
patients,  ie. to adjust the dose to the maximum dose of 150 mg Q2W if  additional LDL-C reduction is 
needed. Moreover, contrary to statin therapy, there appear no differences in safety profile of alirocumab 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 75/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
after dose adjustment. Based on above, it can be concluded that paediatric patients with HeFH who do 
not reach the recommended LDL-C treatment target with the starting dose of alirocumab may benefit 
from the proposed dose adjustment. Therefore, the proposed up-titration regimen of 75 mg Q2W for BW 
< 50 kg or 150 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg can be acceptable. 
Secondary endpoint 
Statistically significant difference in favour of alirocumab compared to the placebo were also observed 
across the multiplicity-adjusted key secondary endpoints, down through the percent change from baseline 
in Lp (a) endpoint at Week 24 (ITT estimand) included, according to the hierarchical testing strategy, in 
both Q2W and Q4W cohorts (Table 28and Table 29). For the lower secondary efficacy endpoints, p-
values were calculated for descriptive purposes only.

Exploratory endpoint (FMD sub-study) 
The exploratory efficacy endpoint of the flow mediated dilatation (FMD) sub-study was the absolute 
change from baseline to Week 24 in FMD of the brachial artery (as determined by the central reading 
laboratory) regardless of adherence to treatment (ITT estimand).  
As functional and morphological changes of the vessel wall can be illustrated by an impaired FMD of the 
brachial artery, a positive result is an increase in FMD. Overall, FMD sub-study included 28 participants in 
the DB period (20 participants from the combined alirocumab group and 8 participants from the combined 
placebo group), all of them completed the DB treatment period and entered the OL treatment period. 
No difference between the alirocumab and the placebo group was observed for the absolute change in 
percent change in FMD from baseline to Week 24. In ITT analysis, the LS mean (SE) absolute change in 
%FMD from baseline to Week 24 was - 0.6% (1.6) in the alirocumab combined group compared to - 
2.1% (1.7) in the combined placebo group, with an LS mean difference for alirocumab versus placebo of 
1.5% ([95% CI: - 3.4 to 6.4]; nominal p=0.5368).  
The primary endpoint results were further supported by the beneficial effects in secondary cholesterol 
measurements (e.g. Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, Lp(a), HDL-C). At Week 24, 77.6% of patients achieved 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 77/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an LDL-C level lower than 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL), and 52.7% of patients an LDL-C level lower than 
2.84 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) in the alirocumab group.  
In the exploratory flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) sub-study, no difference in absolute change from 
baseline to Week 24 in %FMD was observed (-0.6% vs -2.1% in the alirocumab and placebo group, 
respectively; p=0.5368).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Based on the initial MA granted in 2015, alirocumab (Praluent) was indicated in adults with primary 
hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to 
diet in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other LLTs or, alone or in 
combination with other LLTs in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
At the time of the initial MA, a statement was included in Section 4.1 of the EU SmPC that the effect of 
alirocumab on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality had not yet been determined, as the outcome 
study, ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (EFC11570), was ongoing. In 2018, the MAH submitted the results of the 
ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study to extend the indication with the reduction in risk of cardiovascular events in 
adults with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) (EMEA/H/C/003882/II/0042), which received 
approval in 2019. This new extension of indication application is based on efficacy and safety data from 
the Phase 3  study EFC14643 supplemented with efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 dose-finding 
study (Study DFI14223) and safety data from the Phase 3 study in paediatric participants with HoFH 
(Study EFC14660) to include treatment of paediatric HeFH patients 8-≤12 years of age in line with the 
approved EU PIP) as also indicated by the completed full compliance check  (PIP-decision number 
P/0550/2021) which was concluded positively.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose selection 
The approved starting dosing regimen for adult patients is 75 Q2W. Patients requiring larger LDL-C 
reduction (>60%) may be started on 150 mg Q2W, or 300 mg once Q4W. If additional LDL-C reduction is 
needed in adult patients treated with 75 mg Q2W or 300 mg Q4W, the dosage may be adjusted to the 
maximum dosage of 150 mg Q2W. 
The efficacy and safety of alirocumab in the paediatric patient population with HeFH were first evaluated 
in the Phase 2 dose-finding DFI14223 study. The choice of the doses in this study was based on 
simulations performed on the final adult population PK model including Phase 3 data.  
DF114223 was an open-label dose-escalating Phase 2 study to evaluate appropriate doses to be selected 
for the Phase 3 study in paediatric patients with HeFH. Repeated doses of subcutaneous alirocumab were 
administered in 2 cohorts every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 2 cohorts every 4 weeks (Q4W) in children and 
adolescents (aged 8-17 years) with HeFH having LDL-C ≥ 3.37 mmol/L despite an optimal stable daily 
dose of statin therapy ± other LMTs, or a stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins. 
Doses of 30 and 40 mg Q2W were tested for < 50 kg and 50 and 75 mg Q2W  for ≥ 50 kg, 75 and 150 
mg Q4W for < 50 kg and 150 and 300 mg Q4W for ≥ 50 kg body weight. After 8 weeks of treatment, the 
higher Q2W dose (cohort 2: 40 mg Q2W for < 50 kg and 75 mg for ≥ 50 kg) showed greater reductions 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 86/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in LDL-C (-46.1%) as compared to the lower Q2W dose (30 and 50 mg, respectively, -21.1%). Slight 
differences appear in effect according to body weight (LS mean (SE): -40.6  (13.2) with 40 mg Q2W for 
BW <50 kg, and -49.8% (10.6]) with 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg). For the monthly dosing, only a 
moderate effect was observed for the lower dosing (cohort 3) with -17.5% (10.3) for 75 mg Q4W <50 kg 
and 4.0% (11.2) for 150 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg after 8 weeks. Based on these results, subsequent 
dosing with higher doses (cohort 4) showed greater efficacy (-31.9% [10.3] with 150 mg Q4W for BW 
<50 kg, and -59.8% [11.2] with 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg). Overall, a more pronounced effect was 
observed in the higher Q2W dose in cohort 2 and the higher QW4 dose in cohort 4 compared to the 
respective lower dose cohorts groups. However, some variation exists between the body weight 
categories, with greater efficacy in the ≥50 kg groups. From an efficacy point of view, it is considered 
appropriate that the doses used in cohort 2 and cohort 4 have been selected for the pivotal Phase 3 study 
EFC 14643 in paediatric patients with HeFH.  
In the pivotal study EFC14643, alirocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in the primary endpoint 
of percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C, with an LS mean difference versus placebo of - 
43.3% ([97.5% CI: -56.0 to -30.7]; p<0.0001) in the Q2W cohort, and -33.8% ([97.5% CI: -46.4 to -
21.2]; p<0.0001) in the Q4W cohort. Dose up-titration/adjustment at Week 12 provided no additional 
LDL-C reduction in both the Q2W cohort and Q4W cohort (see efficacy main study). The higher effect in 
the Q2W cohort was mainly due to a larger (unexpected) increase in LDL-C in the placebo group. Overall, 
the effect size in LDL-C lowering of ~35-40% observed at week 24 in this study in paediatric subjects                               
with HeFH is consistent with the LDL-lowering effect of -39.1% in adult HeFH patients (HIGH FH study). 
Furthermore, no differential effect on LDL-C of alirocumab versus placebo was observed between the 
Q2W and Q4W regimens and the BW categories. Based on these study results and given the lower patient 
burden associated with monthly injections as compared to bi-weekly injections, the 150 mg or 300 mg 
Q4W for BW < 50 and ≥ 50 kg, respectively, dose regimen is currently proposed for children and 
adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH in section 4.2 of the SmPC, which can be acceptable. The 
Q4W starting regimen (150 mg or 300 mg Q4W for < 50 and ≥ 50 kg, respectively) is a 2-fold higher 
cumulative monthly dose compared to Q2W starting regimen (40 mg or 75 mg Q2W for < 50 and ≥ 50 kg, 
respectively). Consequently, in the Q4W cohort, higher Ctrough values were observed compared to the 
Q2W starting regimen.  However, considering that no differences in safety profiles between the Q2W and 
Q4W regimens were observed, the selection of the Q4W regimen is accepted. In this respect, the focus to 
justify the dose adjustments was primarily on the up-titration regimen combined with the Q4W starting 
dose regimen. Overall, it can be concluded that paediatric patients with HeFH who do not reach the 
recommended LDL-C treatment target with the starting Q4W dose of alirocumab may benefit from the 
proposed up-titration regimen of 75 mg Q2W for BW < 50 kg or 150 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg (see below 
“outcomes and estimation” for results and detailed discussion on the up-titration regimen).   
Considering the potent starting LDL-C lowering strategy and the concerns that lowering cholesterol to 
very low levels may be disadvantageous, particularly in children, since in addition to its biophysical role in 
membrane organization, cholesterol is crucial for brain development and serve as a precursor in the 
biosynthesis of several vitamins, steroids, and sex hormones, the Applicant was requested to elaborate 
on the lowest acceptable LDL-C level used for the paediatric population in clinical practice. Based on a 
literature review, the Applicant argued that a lowest acceptable LDL-C levels has not been scientifically 
validated nor defined by clinical practice guidelines; The 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of 
dyslipidaemias recommend a goal in children >10 years of age of an LDL-C <3.5 mmol/L and at younger 
ages a >50% reduction of LDL-C but do not indicate a lowest acceptable value for LDL-C levels in the 
paediatric population. Nevertheless, the Applicant emphasized that the experience in (paediatric) patients 
treated with PCSK9 inhibitors, including alirocumab, has currently not identified any safety concerns 
associated with very low LDL-C levels. Additionally, experience of patients with loss of function mutation 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report

for PCSK9 indicates that these patients are healthy despite lifelong very low LDL-C levels. Further, it is 
acknowledged that in most mammalian cells, cholesterol can be synthesized endogenously and that in 
some steroidogenic organs, cholesterol is taken up from circulating HDL and not LDL. In this respect, the 
Applicant was requested to substantiate whether there were patients with very low LDL-C values (< 1.29 
mmol/L (<50 mg/dL) or <0.65 mmol/L (< 25 mg/dL)) with the starting regimens 40mg or 75mg Q2W 
and 150mg or 300mg Q4W for BW < 50 or ≥ 50 kg, respectively, during the study, i.e. without dose up-
titration. The Applicant clarified that all events of very low LDL-C values in the double-blind treatment 
(n=4 (8.2%) in Q2W cohort and n=7 (13.5%) in the Q4W cohort) and in the open-label period (n=5 
(7.0%) in the Q2W cohort and n=12 (16.2%) in the Q4W cohort) were reported with the alirocumab 
starting dose. The percentage of patients with very low LDL-C levels were higher with the Q4W starting 
regimen compared with the Q2W starting regimen, suggesting that patients treated with the Q4W 
regimen are more susceptible for achieving very low LDL-C levels. However, a review of baseline 
characteristics suggests that the occurrence of very low LDL-C levels is associated with LDL-C levels at 
baseline, since the majority of patients with a very low LDL-C level (9 out of 13) had a LDL-C level at 
baseline of < 3.5 mmol/L. A justification for this cut-off of baseline LDL-C level < or ≥ 3.5 mmol/L has 
not been provided, but is highly likely related to the target treatment goal of 3.5 mmol/L for children 
aged > 10 years as stated in the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias (2019). 
In this context, the Applicant argued that paediatric patients with HeFH with LDL-C levels < 3.5mmol/L 
will not initiate treatment with alirocumab, minimizing the risk for very low LDL-C levels in these patients, 
which is acknowledged.  Additionally, it is agreed that the LDL-C levels of patients initiating any lipid 
modifying therapy will be closely monitored. Further, the Applicant argued that the very low LDL-C values 
may have been overestimated as only calculated LDL-C levels were evaluated in the study, except when 
TG levels exceeded 4.52 mmol/L), which is acknowledged. Moreover, it is agreed that it is the prescriber’s 
decision to define what the most appropriate target should be for their patient. If a prescriber thinks an 
LDL-C level is too low, they should exercise their medical judgment to adapt treatment according to the 
treatment target. Overall, the Applicant has sufficiently addressed the concerns regarding the occurrence 
of very low LDL-C levels. 
Further, the Ctrough values with both Q2W and Q4W cohorts in the paediatric HeFH population tended to be 
higher compared with the Q2W and Q4W dose regimens in HeFH adults. However, the higher mean 
exposure of alirocumab in the paediatrics population can be explained by the relatively lower bodyweight 
compared to the adult population. No additional effect of age can be observed on the exposure of 
alirocumab applying the proposed weight-based dosing (see PK section). 
Pivotal study EFC14643 
Study EFC14643 was a randomized, 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab administered at 40 mg or 75 mg Q2W (for BW <50 kg or ≥
50 kg) and 150 mg or 300 mg Q4W (for BW <50 kg or ≥50 kg) as a starting dose, on top of background 
LLT in the paediatric population 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH. The 24-week double-blind (DB) 
treatment period was followed by an 80-week open-label (OL) treatment period. General 
inclusion/exclusion criteria seem appropriate to reflect the patients for which an indication is being 
sought, i.e. paediatric patients with HeFH. Eligible patients to be enrolled were male or female patients,  
8- ≤ 17 years of age, diagnosed with HeFH based on genetic testing or in accordance with the clinical 
Broome criteria, on optimized background lipid-lowering therapy for ≥ 4 weeks prior to screening. 
Furthermore, the inclusion criterion of the LDL-C level of ≥  3.4 mmol/L at screening is in line with the 
treatment goal for paediatric patients with HeFH recommended in the ESC guidelines for the treatment of 
dyslipidaemias (2019) and, therefore, acceptable. Patients who previously participated in the DFI14223 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report

study and already met the LDL-C ≥ 3.37 mmol/L when they were screened for the DFI14223 study were 
also eligible to enrol in the Phase 3 study. This approach is considered acceptable since all patients 
completed the open-label dose-finding period of the DFI14223 study, and no patients discontinued due to 
adverse events. Consequently, no preselection based on tolerability has occurred. Moreover, the patients 
from study DFI14223 went through a wash-out period of at least 10 weeks between the last injection of 
alirocumab in the DFI14223 study and the screening lipid assessment at entry in the screening period of 
this Phase 3 study, which is considered appropriate. The key exclusion criterion is that HoFH patients 
were not to be included. The design of the study is appropriate to achieve the primary objective of the 
study. The run-in/screening period of 4-6 weeks can be considered sufficient to establish a stable 
background condition. The 24-week double-blind treatment period is considered appropriate to provide 
reasonable results on the LDL-C (and other cholesterol parameters) lowering effect of alirocumab. After 
completing of the double-blind treatment period, subjects were offered to participate in the 80-week 
open-label treatment period where they will receive open-label alirocumab. A 2:1 randomization was used 
in this study, which is considered appropriate.  The study evaluated 40 mg or 75 mg Q2W (for BW <50 kg 
or ≥50 kg) and 150 mg or 300 mg Q4W (for BW <50 kg or ≥50 kg), as a starting dose, with a subsequent 
option of up-titration at Week 12 based on Week 8 LDL-C values. Patients were up-titrated to alirocumab 
75 mg Q2W for patients with BW < 50 kg or 150 mg Q2W for patients with BW ≥ 50 kg regardless of the 
dosing cohort if the Week 8 LDL-C is ≥ 2.85 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) is endorsed as the specific goal in 
paediatric patients with FH has not yet been determined; LDL-C goals in paediatric patients of <110 
mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L), <100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), or <130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) have been proposed. The 
primary endpoint of percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C is considered appropriate to 
establish the LDL-C lowering effect of alirocumab. Key secondary endpoints evaluation of other lipid 
parameters (i.e. e.g. Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, Lp(a), HDL-C, TG, Apo-A1) are considered appropriate 
to provide further insight on and confirmation of the primary objective. A flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) 
sub-study explored the absolute change from baseline to Week 24 in flow-mediated dilatation of the 
brachial artery, which can be endorsed. The sample size calculation, randomization and blinding 
procedures are acceptable. With respect to statistical analysis, the definition of the analysis population is 
considered standard and acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the pivotal study EFC14643, a total of 153 patients were randomized, of which 74 patients in the Q2W 
dosing regimen cohort (49 and 25  in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively) and 79 patients in 
the Q4W dosing regimen cohort (52 and 27 in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively). The 
percentage of subjects who completed the DB treatment period was high and similar between the 
alirocumab and placebo group (91.8% vs 100% for the alirocumab and placebo group in the Q2W cohort 
and 94.2% vs 96.3% in the Q4W cohort). Four patients in the alirocumab group in the Q2W cohort and 3 
patients in the alirocumab group in the Q4W cohort discontinued the DB treatment period of which  
“other” (n=2) and “due to AE” (n=2) were the most common. Further, 145 participants entered the OL 
treatment period (71 in the Q2W cohort and 74 in the Q4W cohort), of which a high proportion of 
subjects completed this period (91.5% (65/71) patients in the Q2W cohort and 98.6% (73/74) patients in 
the Q4W cohort). The most common reason for discontinuing the OL period was “other”(n=5). 
The overall compliance for double-blind injections was relatively high since all participants in both 
alirocumab and placebo group in the Q2W cohort had ≥80% compliance for IMP injections (ie, participants 
took ≥80% of their injections and at the scheduled times). In contrast, in the Q4W cohort, 44 (84.6%) 
participants in the alirocumab group and 23 (85.2%) participants in the placebo group had ≥80% 
compliance for IMP injections. As such, a small difference in compliance could be observed between the 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report

Q2W cohort and the Q4W cohort however, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions since the number of 
subjects in each group was relatively small. The percentages of major protocol deviations were relatively 
high (30.6% vs 12.0% in the Q2W cohort and 38.5% vs 48.1% in the Q4W cohort for alirocumab and 
placebo, respectively). The most frequently reported major protocol deviations were in the category “IMP 
management” (n=3 vs 1 in the Q2W cohort and n=12 vs 5 in the Q4W cohort for alirocumab and placebo, 
respectively). The Applicant has sufficiently substantiated that the major deviations in IMP management 
had no impact on efficacy or safety. Additionally, the Applicant had conducted a post-hoc descriptive 
analysis excluding patients with at least one major protocol deviation linked to IMP management, 
indicating that these deviations had no or little impact on the LDL-C changes from baseline. . This study 
was a multicentre study (n=43). Considering that almost half of the subjects were from Europe (83 out of 
153 (54%), the population is sufficiently representative for Europe.  No amendments were made that 
would compromise the endpoints or outcomes of the study. The amendments are considered valuable and 
are, therefore, acceptable.  
In general, baseline data, including age group, BW and LDL-C are well distributed across the two cohorts 
and treatment groups, which is reassuring for the interpretation of the data. However, in the Q2W cohort, 
there were more female patients in the alirocumab group compared with the placebo group (61.2% vs 
32.0%,  respectively). Furthermore, more patients participated in the Phase 2 dose-finding study in the 
Q2W cohort than in the Q4W cohort, since enrolment in the Q4W cohort started when enrolment in Q2W 
cohort was completed. These disbalances would likely not have a clinically relevant impact on the 
outcome. Overall, the study population can be considered representative of a paediatric HeFH population. 
HeFH diagnosis was sufficiently established as the diagnosis was for a large part of the population by 
genetic testing (83.8% and 96.2% in the Q2W and Q4W cohort, respectively). The mean (SD) age of the 
randomized population was 12.9 (2.8) years, with most of the patients (64.1% (n= 98/153)) ≥12-17 
years of age at baseline, whereas 19.0% (n=29/153) of the patients were ≥10 to < 12 years of age and 
16.3% (n=25/153) of the patients were < 10 years of age, which is considered appropriate for the sought 
indication, i.e. patients aged 8-17 years of age. Moreover, the elevated mean LDL-C baseline value of 4.5 
mmol/L reasonably corresponds to an LDL-C level generally observed within a HeFH population. The 
majority of the patients have received any statin therapy (98.6% and 91.1% of participants in the Q2W 
and Q4W cohorts), which is conform to the inclusion criterion “Patients must receive the optimal dose of 
statin defined as the stable daily dose prescribed based on regional practice or local guidelines or was the 
stable daily dose that was maximally tolerated due to adverse effects on higher doses”. Further, 12.2% 
and 24.1% of patients in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts, respectively, received any LMTs other than statins. 
Other patients (4.1% (n=3) in the Q2W cohort and 10.1% (n=8) in the Q4W cohort) were reported statin 
intolerant as defined by the protocol. As such, paediatric patients who are statin intolerant were 
underrepresented. However, given the experience of alirocumab therapy in statin-intolerant adults, this 
issue is not pursued. 
In the primary efficacy analysis, treatment with alirocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in the 
primary endpoint of percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C. In the Q2W cohort, alirocumab 
treatment reduced LDL-C with -33.6% (3.4) compared with +9.7% (4.3)  in the placebo group 
(difference: -43.3% ([97.5% CI: -56.0 to -30.7]; p<0.0001), resulting in a mean LDL-C at Week 24 of 
2.929 (0.147) mmol/L in the alirocumab group versus 4.820 (0.213) mmol/L in the placebo group. 
Reductions were observed in both BW categories with a higher treatment effect compared with placebo 
observed with 40 mg Q2W: -48.5% (7.6) with the 40 mg Q2W dose for BW <50 kg, and -38.0% (7.8) 
with the 75 mg Q2W dose for BW ≥50 kg. This higher effect was mainly due to a larger (unexpected) 
increase in LDL-C in the placebo group in the 40 mg Q2W cohort compared with the 75 mg Q2W (12.5% 
(5.9) vs 5.6 (6.4), respectively. In the Q4W cohort,  alirocumab treatment reduced LDL-C with -38.2% 
(4.0) compared with -4.4% (3.7)  in the placebo group (difference: -33.8% ([97.5% CI: -46.4 to -21.2]; 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023

p<0.0001), resulting in a mean LDL-C at Week 24 of 2.847 (0.200) mmol/L  vs. 4.177 (0.180) mmol/L  
in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively. The response was consistent across the 2 doses by the 
BW category with a reduction of -34.5% (9.5) with the 150 mg Q4W dose for BW <50 kg and -32.9% 
(7.0) with the 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg. The LDL-C lowering effect appears generally consistent among 
several subgroups, including gender age (<12, ≥ 12 years) and baseline LDL-C in both Q2W and Q4W 
cohorts. Regarding long-term effect, the percent change of LDL-C from baseline to Week 104 was - 
26.3% in the Q2W cohort and  -23.9% (33.5) in the Q4W cohort. The effect at week 104 observed during 
the OL is lower than as compared with the DB treatment period. According to the Applicant, this 
observation appeared to be related to a less strict application of the rules regarding dose-up 
titration/adjustment during the OL treatment period, as revealed by the post-hoc analyses, which can be 
acknowledged. Moreover,  it is acknowledged by CHMP that the LDL-C lowering effect in the paediatric 
HeFH population is still considered clinically relevant. Overall, the effect size in LDL-C lowering of ~35-
40% observed at week 24 in paediatric subjects with HeFH is consistent with the LDL-lowering effect of -
39% in adult HeFH patients (HIGH FH study). Furthermore, no differential effect on LDL-C of alirocumab 
versus placebo was observed between the Q2W and Q4W regimens and the BW categories.  
Regarding dose titration, in the Q2W cohort, almost half of the patients in the alirocumab group (22 out 
of 49 (44.9%); 11 with BW <50 kg and 11 with BW ≥50 kg) received dose up-titration at Week 12. In the 
Q4W cohort, 15 out of 52 (28.8%) patients were in the alirocumab group (with BW <50 kg and 10 with 
BW ≥50 kg) at Week 12. The study showed that patients who needed a dose up-titration had a higher 
mean baseline LDL-C value than patients who did not require a dose up-titration (4.99 vs. 3.91 mmol/L 
and 5.75 vs 3.99 mmol/L in the Q2W and Q4W cohort respectively). The dose was up-titrated at Week 12 
based on LDL-C levels measured at Week 8. Dose up-titration at Week 12 provided an additional 
moderate LDL-C reduction in the Q4W cohort, and minimal/no effect in the Q2W cohort in participants 
who underwent a change in dosing at Week 12. Since the Q4W starting regimen is currently proposed for 
children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH in section 4.2 of the SmPC, the focus to justify 
the dose adjustments was primarily on the up-titration regimen combined with the Q4W starting dose 
regimen. At Week 24, following dose adjustment, an additional decrease in the percent change from 
baseline LDL-C compared with Week 12 was measured in the Q4W cohort (-34.2% versus -26.8%, 
respectively), however compared with Week 8 there was no additional decrease  (-34.2% at Week 24 
versus -33.8% at Week 8). Although this observation can possiblly be explained by the differences in 
sample size at the different time points ( n=13 at Week 8 vs n=14 at Week 12 and Week 24), no 
discussion on this observation has been provided. Instead, the Applicant has highlighted the paediatric 
patients which had additional benefit with the up-titration step by referring to the secondary endpoints of 
proportion of patients achieving a LDL-C level lower than 3.37 mmol/L or  2.84 mmol/L, and > 50% 
reduction in LDL-C at Week 12 (prior to up-titration) vs. Week 24 (after up-titration). The results showed 
that up-titration allowed more patients to achieve the recommended target of LDL-C <3.37 mmol/L (n=9 
(64.3%) vs. n=5 (35.7%) prior up-titration at Week 12), LDL-C <2.84 mmol/L (n=5 (35.7%) vs. n=2 
(14.3%) prior up-titration) and >50 % reduction in LDL-C from baseline (n=5 (35.7%) vs. n=2 (14.3%) 
prior up-titration), whereas in paediatric patients who were not dose adjusted at Week 12, the 
proportions of subjects reaching the recommended LDL-C targets were decreased between Week 12 and 
Week 24. Additionally, the results showed that patients who received up-titration had stronger PCSK9 
inhibition than prior up-titration. In the dose-adjusted  paediatric subjects, mean (SD) free PCSK9 level 
was 32.5 (63.3) ng/mL at Week 12, compared to 123.0 (61.5) ng/mL at baseline. Following dose up-
titration, the mean free PCSK9 level was further reduced to 4.9 (18.3) ng/mL at Week 24. Of note, PCSK9 
levels were not entirely consistent with LDL-C effect likely due to statin interference. Furthemore, the 
proposed dose titration is in line with the dose up-titration already approved in adult patients,  ie. to 
adjust the dose to the maximum dose of 150 mg Q2W if  additional LDL-C reduction is needed. Moreover, 
contrary to statin therapy, there are no differences in safety profile of alirocumab after dose adjustment. 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 91/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on above, it can be concluded that paediatric patients with HeFH who do not reach the 
recommended LDL-C treatment target with the starting dose of alirocumab may benefit from the 
proposed dose adjustment. Therefore, the proposed up-titration regimen of 75 mg Q2W for BW < 50 kg 
or 150 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg can be acceptable. 
The primary endpoint results were further supported by beneficial effects in secondary cholesterol 
measurements (e.g. Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, Lp(a), HDL-C). At Week 24, 77.6% of patients achieved 
the treatment goal of LDL-C < 3.4 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) for paediatric patients with HeFH recommended 
in the ESC guideline for the management of dyslipidemias (2019) and 52.7% of patients an LDL-C level 
lower than 2.84 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) in the alirocumab group. In the exploratory flow-mediated 
dilatation (FMD) sub-study, no difference in absolute change from baseline to Week 24 in %FMD was 
observed (-0.6% vs -2.1% in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively; p=0.5368). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, alirocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in LDL-C and other lipid parameters on 
top of standard of care in HeFH patients aged 8-≤17 years. The open-label treatment period provides 
data of the maintenance of the effect in the long term; although the effect size appeared lower than 
observed in the DB treatment period, it is still considered clinically relevant.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Main safety information on the use of alirocumab in the paediatric population is based on the completed 
Study EFC14643, supplemented with data from other paediatric studies (Phase 2 dose-finding study 
DFI14223 and the Phase 3 study EFC14660 in HoFH patients) and data from post-marketing surveillance 
for approved indications.  
In the initial MA dossier, a total of 2856 adult subjects were exposed to alirocumab for ≥ 24 weeks, of 
which 2408 subjects for ≥ 52 weeks. With the submission of the cardiovascular outcome trial ODYSSEY 
OUTCOMES, with a total of 18894 patients, the overall exposure data from clinical studies has 
substantially increased, although exposure in the ODYSSEY was limited to a median of 31 months. So, 
there was a large safety experience with alirocumab in adult patients, while there was none in the 
paediatric population. Nevertheless, experience is obtained based on the data of pivotal Phase 3 Study 
EFC14643 in HeFH patients, the Phase 2 dose-finding study DFI14223, and the Phase 3 study EFC14660 
in HoFH patients.  
Patient exposure 
Double-blind treatment period 
The duration of treatment exposure was similar across intervention groups in both cohorts: in the Q2W 
cohort, the mean (SD) duration of exposure was 23.7 (2.0) weeks for alirocumab group and 24.1 (0.4) 
weeks for placebo group (Table 31and Table 32). In the Q4W cohort, the mean (SD) duration of exposure 
was 22.9 (4.5) weeks for alirocumab group and 23.9 (3.3) weeks for placebo group. The exposure to 
alirocumab was 22.2 patient-years in Q2W cohort and 22.8 patient-years in Q4W cohort.

Open-label treatment period 
The duration of treatment exposure was similar in both cohorts: in the Q2W cohort, the mean (SD) 
duration of exposure was 76.5 (14.8) weeks; in the Q4W cohort, the mean (SD) duration of exposure was 
79.7 (6.0) weeks. Cumulative exposure to treatment (patient-years) in the Q2W cohort was 67.8 for

“Alirocumab in DB period” group and 36.4 for “Placebo in DB period” group, which in the Q4W cohort was 
75.5 for “Alirocumab in DB period” group and 37.6 for “Placebo in DB period” group.  
Most of the participants were exposed to the IMP injections for at least 78 weeks: 64 (90.1%) in the Q2W 
cohort and 67 (90.5%) in the Q4W cohort. The exposure to alirocumab was 104.1 patient-years in Q2W 
cohort and 113.1 patient-years in Q4W cohort. 
In other paediatric studies, the exposure to alirocumab was of 55.5 patient-years in the DFI14223 study 
and 16.0 patient-years in the EFC14660. 
In the pivotal study EFC14643, a total of 101 paediatric HeFH patients (49 in the Q2W cohort and 52 in 
the Q4W cohort) received at least 1 dose of alirocumab in the DB period. The mean duration of treatment 
exposure in the DB treatment period was similar across both treatment groups in both cohorts (23.7 vs. 
24.1 weeks in the Q2W cohort and 22.9 vs. 23.9 weeks in the Q4W cohort for alirocumab and placebo, 
respectively), with a total patient-years exposure of 22.2 in the Q2W cohort and 22.8 in the Q4W cohort. 
In the OL treatment period, the mean duration of treatment was also similar in both cohorts (76.5 weeks 
in the Q2W cohort vs 79.7 weeks in the Q4W cohort), with a patient-years exposure to alirocumab of 
104.1 in the Q2W cohort and 113.1 in the Q4W cohort, which is considered sufficient.  
To note, since approximately similar steady-state exposure was achieved after administration of 
alirocumab between 40 mg and 75 mg Q2W and 150 mg and 300 mg Q4W (for corresponding BW <50 kg 
and ≥50 kg), it is acceptable to show safety data according to dosing cohort (Q2W vs Q4W) and not 
differentiate it further into BW <50 kg and ≥50 kg. 
Adverse events 
General frequency of adverse events 
Double-blind treatment period 
During the DB treatment period, in the Q2W cohort, 26 (53.1%) participants in the alirocumab group and 
13 (52.0%) participants in the placebo group experienced at least 1 TEAE (Table 33). In the Q4W cohort, 
26 (50.0%) participants in the alirocumab group and 16 (59.3%) participants in the placebo group 
experienced at least 1 TEAE cohort (Table 34). Treatment-emergent SAEs were experienced by 5 
participants in the Q2W cohort (4 [8.2%] participants in the alirocumab group and 1 [4.0%] participant in 
the placebo group) and 3 participants in the Q4W cohort (2 [3.8%] in the alirocumab group and 1 [3.7%] 
in the placebo group). No participants died during the DB treatment period of the study. No participants 
in the Q2W cohort and 2 (3.8%) participants in the Q4W cohort (both in the alirocumab group) had 
TEAEs leading to permanent IMP discontinuation. 
The majority of TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity with no relevant distribution between 
intervention groups.

During the OL treatment period, TEAEs were reported by 40 (56.3%) participants in the Q2W cohort 
(Table 35) and by 41 (55.4%) in the Q4W cohort (Table 36). Four (5.6%) and 5 (6.8%) participants 
reported treatment-emergent SAEs in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts, respectively. No participants died 
during the OL period of the study. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation were reported by 1 (1.4%) participant in the Q2W cohort (PT: low density lipoprotein 
decreased) and by no participant in the Q4W cohort.

Other studies 
In DFI14223, 31 (74.0%) patients experienced at least one TEAE in the OLDFI/OLE combined period. No 
treatment-emergent SAEs and no deaths were reported during the study. All TEAEs were mild or 
moderate. TEAEs considered related to IMP were mainly injection site reactions. Two TEAEs led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation: one patient with decreased neutrophils already noted at screening, 
experienced neutropenia which resolved after IMP discontinuation; another patient experienced fatigue, 
which resolved after IMP discontinuation. 
None of these TEAEs were considered related to IMP. No AESIs were reported. No clinically significant 
changes over time were observed in the safety hematology, serum chemistry, vital signs and other 
parameters assessed in the study. 
In EFC14660, 17 participants out of 18 (94.4%) experienced at least one TEAE. The 3 most frequently 
reported TEAEs by PT were nasopharyngitis (3 [16.7%]), headache (3 [16.7%]), and aortic valve 
incompetence (3 [16.7%]). One patient experienced a treatment-emergent SAE (PT: cardiac failure) 
which led to treatment discontinuation and ultimately to death. The patient died due to decompensated 
heart failure and severe aortic stenosis. This case was assessed as not related to alirocumab by the 
Investigator. Treatment related TEAE (injection site reaction) was reported in a single patient. 
Common adverse events 
Double-blind treatment period 
In the Q2W cohort, the 2 most frequently reported TEAEs in either intervention group by PT were: 
nasopharyngitis (7 [14.3%] participants in the alirocumab group vs. 2 [8.0%] participants in the placebo 
group) and upper respiratory tract infection (3 [6.1%] vs. 3 [12.0%]). PTs with notably higher frequency 
in the alirocumab group compared with placebo group (with a difference of ≥5%) were nasopharyngitis (7 
[14.3%] in the alirocumab group versus 2 [8.0%] in the placebo group) and Injection site reaction (3 
[6.1%] versus none)(table 37).  
In the Q4W cohort, the 2 most frequently reported TEAE in either intervention group by PT were: upper 
respiratory tract infection (3 [5.8%] participants in the alirocumab group versus 3 [11.1%] participants in 
the placebo group) and headache (4 [7.7%] vs. 1 [3.7%]). No PTs with notably higher frequency in the 
alirocumab group compared with placebo group (with a difference of ≥5%) were reported in the Q4W 
cohort (Table 38).

Open-label treatment period 
The 2 most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were: headache (6 [8.5%]) and nasopharyngitis (5 [7.0%]) 
in the Q2W cohort and headache (11 [14.9%]) and COVID-19 (5 [6.8%]) in the Q4W cohort. 
Treatment related adverse events (by investigator) 
Double-blind treatment period 
Overall, TEAEs were considered to be related to the IMP by the Investigator in 4 (8.2%) participants in 
the alirocumab Q2W group and 7 (13.5%) in the alirocumab Q4W group and 1 (4.0%) participant in the 
Q2W placebo group. The most frequently related TEAEs were injection site reactions, all reported with 
alirocumab (in 3 [6.1%] and 2 [3.8%] participants in the Q2W and Q4W cohort, respectively). Other 
TEAEs considered to be related to IMP by the Investigator were all single occurrence with the exception of 
syncope, reported in 2 participants in the alirocumab group (Q4W cohort) and headache, reported in 1 
participant in the alirocumab group (Q4W cohort) and 1 participant in the placebo group (Q2W cohort). 
Open-label treatment period 
A total of 15 (10.3%) participants reported TEAEs that were considered to be related to the IMP by the 
Investigator. Among them 6 participants experienced injections site reactions and 4 had LDL-C decreased 
reported as AE. Other related events were reported in 1 participant each. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were frequently reported; however, the percentage of 
patients with any TEAE in the DB treatment period was approximately similar across both treatment 
groups in the Q2W cohort ( 53.1% vs. 52.0% in the alirocumab and placebo group, respectively) or lower 
in the alirocumab compared with the placebo group in the Q4W cohort (50.0% vs. 59.3%), which is 
reassuring. In the OL treatment period, the percentage of TEAEs was comparable between subjects who 
received alirocumab and placebo in the DB period in the Q4W cohort  (55.1% vs. 56.0% in the Q4W 
cohort) or lower in the alirocumab DB group compared with the placebo DB group in the Q2W cohort 
(52.2% vs. 64.0%). The most frequent AEs with a higher incidence with alirocumab compared with 
placebo (a difference of ≥ 5%) in the Q2W cohort were nasopharyngitis (14.3% vs. 8.0%) and injection 
site reaction (6.1% vs. 0%), while there were not AEs with a notably higher frequency in the alirocumab 
group compared with the placebo group in the Q4W cohort. In the OL treatment period, the 2 most 
frequently reported AEs were headache (8.5%) and nasopharyngitis (7.0%). The AEs considered 
treatment-related by the investigator were reported in 4 (8.2%) subjects in the alirocumab Q2W group 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report

and 7 (13.5%) in the alirocumab Q4W group. The most frequently related TEAEs were injection site 
reactions. The other AEs considered treatment-related concerned single occurrences in the alirocumab 
group with the exception of syncope (n=2). As indicated below, both events of syncope that occurred 
were classified as SAE, however, were transient and unique episodes. The Applicant argued that the age 
and gender of the participants may be predisposing factors as the incidence of syncope was reported to 
peak between 15 and 19 years of age and to be greater in girls than boys. Further, the study days of the 
last IMP injection before syncope for these 2 patients were inconsistent (Day 1 and Day 161). Based on 
above, it is agreed with the Applicant that the causality of alirocumab is unlikely. Moreover, in the initial 
MA or the ODYSSAY OUTCOME dossier no increased risk for syncope has been observed.  
Consistent with the pivotal study EFC14643, the TEAEs in the dose-finding study DFI14223 and the Phase 
3 study EFC14660 in HoFH were mild or moderate, with injection site reactions, nasopharyngitis, and 
headache as the most frequently reported.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Double-blind treatment period 
SAE was experienced by: 
•  5 participants in the Q2W cohort (4 [8.2%] participants in the alirocumab group [1 major 
depression, 1 abdominal hernia, 1 abdominal pain, and 1 sympathetic posterior cervical 
syndrome] and 1 [4.0%] participant in the placebo group [appendicitis]) and, 
•  3 participants in the Q4W cohort (2 [3.8%] in the alirocumab group [2 syncope] and 1 
[3.7%] in the placebo group [non-cardiac chest pain]) 
All treatment-emergent SAEs were reported as resolved or recovered at the end of the DB treatment 
period. Two of these events were experienced by 2 participants in the alirocumab group in the Q4W 
cohort (syncope), both events were transient, unique episode and were considered related to the IMP by 
the Investigator. In one case, the syncope led to study treatment discontinuation due to participant’s 
decision and in the second participant, the treatment with IMP was continued as planned without 
reoccurrence of the event. The age and gender of the participants may also be predisposing factors as the 
incidence of syncope was reported to peak between 15 and 19 years of age and to be greater in girls than 
boys (22). The study days of last IMP injection before syncope for these 2 participants were Day 1 and 
Day 161, respectively. No diagnostic tests (eg, blood tests) were done. The Sponsor assessed the 
causality of alirocumab as unlikely. 
Open-label treatment period 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in: 
•  4 (5.6%) participants in the Q2W cohort (PT: pharyngitis streptococcal, pneumonia, 
hypertension, and calculus urinary) and, 
•  5 (6.8%) participants in the Q4W cohort (PT: appendicitis, syncope, angina pectoris, 
myocarditis, ligament rupture). 
All treatment-emergent SAEs were resolved or resolving at the end of the OL treatment period. They 
were not related to alirocumab injections. Two serious cases of syncope were reported in the Q4W cohort. 
They were transient, unique episode of moderate or mild intensity. The study days of last IMP injection 
for these 2 participants were Day 20 and 2 months and 20 days after the last administration of IMP in

blinded phase and unspecified duration after first administration of IMP in OL period. Therapy with IMP 
was continued as planned without reoccurrence of syncope. Angina pectoris and myocarditis were 
reported in the same participant, where both events were evaluated as not related to the IMP and no 
action was taken with the IMP. Both events were assessed by the Investigator as being related to COVID-
19 vaccine. 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported during Study EFC14643. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Double-blind treatment period 
General allergic events 
General allergic events were reported in 2 (3.8%) participants in the alirocumab group in Q4W cohort 
(PT: rash) and in no participants in the alirocumab group Q2W cohort and in the placebo groups. 
Local injection site reactions 
Local injection site reactions were reported in 3 (6.1%) participants in the alirocumab group in the Q2W 
cohort and 2 (3.8%) participants in the alirocumab group in the Q4W cohort. No participants reported 
local injection site reactions in the placebo groups. 
Neurologic events 
Neurologic event of hypoesthesia was reported in 1 (1.9%) participant from the alirocumab group in Q4W 
cohort. This participant reported a non-serious hypoaesthesia and did not discontinue study intervention 
due to this event. No participants reported neurologic event in the alirocumab group in the Q2W cohort 
and in the placebo groups. 
Neurocognitive events 
Neurocognitive events of disturbance in attention and memory impairment were reported in 1 (1.9%) 
participant from the alirocumab group in the Q4W cohort. These events led to treatment discontinuation. 
No participants reported neurocognitive event in the alirocumab group in the Q2W cohort and in the 
placebo groups. 
LDL-C< 50 mg/dL 
In the Q2W cohort, 4 (8.2%) participants in the alirocumab group had 1 LDL-C value <50 mg/dL. The 
mean time to the first observed low LDL-C value <50 mg/dL was 13.14 (7.57) weeks (range: 8.1 to 24.1 
weeks). No participants had more than 1 low LDL-C value and no participants had any LDL-C value <25 
mg/dL. 
In the Q4W cohort, 7 (13.5%) participants in the alirocumab group had at least 1 LDL-C value <50 
mg/dL. The mean time to the first observed LDL-C value <50 mg/dL was 15.84 (7.88) weeks. Among 
them, 3 (5.8%) participants had 2 consecutive LDL-C values <50 mg/dL including 1 (1.9%) participant 
who had 2 consecutive LDL-C values <25 mg/dL. One out of 3 (33.3%) participants with 2 consecutive 
LDL-C <50 mg/dL (1.30 mmol/L) reported TEAEs. This participant experienced pain in extremity and 
gastroenteritis bacterial after the first of the 2 low LDL-C values and then recovered with corrective 
treatment. The events were considered not related to the IMP by the Investigator.

Open-label treatment period 
General allergic events 
General allergic events were reported in 4 (5.6%) participants in the Q2W cohort (PT: seasonal allergy 
(n=2), dermitis allergic (n=1), rash (n=1))  and in 3 (4.1%) participants in the Q4W cohort (PT: asthma, 
rash, seasonal allergy). 
Local injection site reactions 
Local injection site reactions were reported in 4 (5.6%) participants in the Q2W cohort and in 3 (4.1%) 
participants in the Q4W cohort. 
Neurocognitive events 
Neurocognitive event (PT: memory impairment) was reported in 1 (1.4%) participant in Q2W cohort and 
in 1 (1.4%) participant in the Q4W cohort (PT: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Both events were 
not serious and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. 
Hepatic disorder 
One (1.4%) participant in the Q2W cohort and 1 (1.4%) participant in the Q4W cohort reported hepatic 
disorder (PT: alanine aminotransferase increased). 
LDL-C< 50 mg/dL 
In the Q2W cohort, 5 (7.0%) participants had 1 LDL-C value <50 mg/dL and 2 participants had 2 
consecutive LDL-C values <50 mg/dL. The mean time to the observed low LDL-C value was 12.17 (6.91) 
weeks. One participant had at least 1 LDL-C value <25 mg/dL and no participant had 2 consecutive LDL-C 
value <25 mg/dL. One participant with 2 consecutive LDL-C <50 mg/dL reported a TEAE (otitis media). 
The event was considered not related to the IMP by the Investigator. 
In the Q4W cohort, 12 (16.2%) participants had one LDL-C value <50 mg/dL (10 [20.4%] in the 
alirocumab in DB period group and 2 [8.0%] in the placebo in DB period group) and 7 (9.5%) participants 
had 2 consecutive LDL-C value <50 mg/dL. One participant in alirocumab in DB period group had 2 
consecutive LDL-C value <50 mg/dL in both the DB and OL treatment periods as LDL-C value <50 mg/dL 
was reported at Week 12, Week 24 and Week 32. Two participants had at least 1 LDL-C value <25 mg/dL 
and no participant had 2 consecutive LDL-C value <25 mg/dL. Three participants with 2 consecutive LDL-
C <50 mg/dL experienced TEAEs (COVID-19, low density lipoprotein decreased and nasopharyngitis in 
the first participant, respiratory tract infection and low density lipoprotein decreased in the second 
participant, and headache and tremor in the third participant). The events “low density lipoprotein 
decreased” were considered related to the IMP. The other events were assessed as not related to the IMP 
by the Investigator. 
Other 
There were in the Q2W and Q4W no cases of neurologic events, diabetes mellitus or diabetic complication 
or cataracts.

The percentage of subjects experiencing SAEs was relatively low, however, slightly higher in the 
alirocumab group compared with the placebo group in the Q2W cohort group (8.2% vs. 4.0%), whereas 
the percentage of SAEs was comparable in the Q4W cohort group (3.8% vs 3.7%). Overall, no patterns 
indicative of a safety signal were observed; all SAEs concerned single events except for syncope (n=2) of 
which the causality to alirocumab was considered unlikely (see above). 
No deaths were observed in the pivotal study EFC 14643. 
Special attention has been given to certain AEs, including allergic events, local injection site reactions, 
neurologic events, neurocognitive events, hepatic disorders, diabetes mellitus, and cataract. The 
incidence in general allergic events was low; Only 2 patients (3.8%) in the Q4W cohort group experienced 
a rash event. Local injection site reactions occurred with a higher frequency for alirocumab compared with 
placebo (6.1% vs. 0% in the Q2W cohort and 3.8% vs. 0% in the Q4W cohort, respectively). The 
frequency in local injection site reactions remained stable throughout the study, with 4 (5.6%) patients  
in the Q2W cohort and in 3 (4.1%) participants in the Q4W cohort in the OL treatment period. Injection 
site reaction is already a known ADR from the original dossier. Incidences of neurologic and 
neurocognitive events were very limited (both n=1 from the alirocumab group of the Q4W cohort in the 
DB period), making any conclusions difficult. Furthermore, in the DB treatment period, there were no 
incidences of hepatic disorder, diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications, and cataract.  
Regarding very low LDL-C levels, in the DB treatment period, 4 (8.2%) and 7 (13.5%) patients in the 
alirocumab group of the QW2 and Q4W cohort, respectively, had at least one low LDL-C value of < 1.29 
mmol/L (< 50 mg/dL) of which 3 (5.8%) patients had 2 consecutive LDL-C values < 1.29 mmol/L (all 
Q4W) including 1 (1.9%) participant who had 2 consecutive LDL-C values < 0.65 mmol/L (<25 mg/dL). 
In the OLE period, 7 (10.0%) and 12 (16.2) in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts had at least one low LDL-C 
value of < 1.29 mmol/L  of which 1 (1.4%) in the Q2W cohort and 7 (9.5%) in the Q4W cohort had 2 
consecutive LDL-C values < 1.29 mmol/L. Three patients ( 1 in Q2W and 2 in Q4W) had one LDL-C value 
< 0.65 mmol/L. However, there is no evidence of an unexpected safety concern regarding subjects who 
achieved low LDL-C levels, consistent with the full dataset available for alirocumab.  
Laboratory findings 
Double-blind treatment period 
Immunogenicity 
One (2.1%) participant in the alirocumab group in Q2W cohort and 4 (8.0%) participants in the 
alirocumab group in the Q4W cohort had positive ADA status at baseline, before the first IMP 
administration. Three participants (6.1%) developed a treatment-emergent positive ADA response, all of 
them in the alirocumab group of the Q2W cohort. No participants had a treatment-emergent positive ADA 
response classified as persistent and no titer was above 240. 
No participants had ADA response with neutralizing status. 
In the OL period, one participant developed a treatment-emergent positive ADA response in the Q4W 
cohort. The response was classified as transient (detected only at Week 68). 
No participants had treatment-emergent ADA response with a titer above 240. No participants had ADA 
response with neutralizing status.

Hematology 
During the DB period, there was no clinically meaningful difference between the alirocumab and the 
placebo groups for the changes over time in RBCs, platelets, and WBCs in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts: 
• 
In the Q2W cohort, the percentage of postbaseline PCSAs (or abnormalities) was low (ie, 
<10%) in both intervention groups for RBCs, platelets, and WBCs parameters. For 
leukocytes, PCSA was reported in 11 (22.4%) participants in the alirocumab group and 7 
(28.0%) participants in the placebo group. 
• 
In the Q4W cohort, the most frequently reported PCSAs (>10% of participants in either 
intervention group) for RBCs, platelets, and WBCs parameters were hematocrit low, 
leukocytes low, basophils high, and eosinophils high. 
No participants had abnormal hematology parameters while on-treatment that were considered as TEAEs. 
During the OL period, no clinically meaningful changes over time were reported in RBCs, platelets and 
WBCs in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts. 
• 
In the Q2W cohort, the percentage of post-baseline PCSAs (or abnormalities) was low (ie, 
<10%) for all RBCs, platelets and WBCs parameters except for leukocytes low in 23 
(32.9%) participants, eosinophils high in 7 (10.0 %) participants, and basophils high in 
13 (18.6%) participants. 
• 
In the Q4W cohort, the percentage of post-baseline PCSAs (or abnormalities) was low (ie, 
<10%) for all RBCs, platelets and WBCs parameters except for leukocytes low in 26 
(35.1%) participants, eosinophils high in 10 (13.5%) participants, and basophils high in 
12 (16.2%) participants. 
Clinical chemistry 
In the DB and OL periods, no clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed for metabolic 
parameters (glucose, total protein, and creatine phosphokinase), for electrolytes, for renal function 
parameters, and for liver function in the alirocumab and placebo groups throughout the course of the 
study.  
No participants experienced a PCSA that met the criteria of a potential Hy’s law case (ALT >3 x ULN and 
total bilirubin >2 x ULN). 
No participants had abnormal liver function parameters while on-treatment that were considered as 
TEAEs in DB period. In OL period, one participant in the Q2W cohort and one participant in the Q4W 
cohort reported hepatic disorder (PT: alanine aminotransferase increased). 
Gonadal and pituitary hormones 
In the DB and OL periods, no abnormal change over time in the gonadal and pituitary hormones was 
observed in boys and girls in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts. No boy had testosterone <LLN and LH>ULN 
and/or FSH >ULN and no girl had estradiol <LLN and LH >ULN and/or FSH >ULN. 
Adrenal gland hormones 
In the DB and OL periods, no abnormal change over time in DHEAS, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone 
was observed in any treatment groups. There were 2 girls with DHEAS values >ULN in the alirocumab 
group in both periods in the Q4W cohort, and 1 boy with DHEAS values >ULN in the OL treatment period

in the Q4W cohort. These abnormal values were not clinically relevant. No participants had both cortisol 
<LLN and adrenocorticotropic hormone >ULN in either intervention group in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts. 
Fat soluble vitamins 
In the DB period, there was no clinically meaningful differences between the alirocumab and the placebo 
groups for changes over time in fat soluble vitamins in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts. 
In the OL period, there was no clinically meaningful difference in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts. 
A low level of immunogenicity (n=3; all in Q2W cohort) was observed in the paediatric population in the 
pivotal Phase 3 study EFC14643. The treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses were 
classified as very low titer and transient. Further, no participants with neutralizing ADA were reported.  
Furthermore, no trends indicative of clinically important treatment-related laboratory abnormalities, 
including hematology parameters, renal and hepatic function parameters, blood glucose, hsCRP, hormone 
levels, and vitamins were observed with alirocumab. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
Vital signs and physical findings 
For both genders, the mean BW and height in these young participants increased steadily over time which 
was consistent with the growth velocity expected in this age group and comparable in Q2W and Q4W 
cohort over the 104 weeks: 
• 
• 
In the Q2W cohort, the mean (SD) height increase from baseline to Week 24 was 1.75 (1.86) cm 
in the alirocumab group and 1.00 (1.93) cm in the placebo group, for female participants, and 
was 4.35 (6.08) cm in the alirocumab group and 2.66 (2.29) cm in the placebo group, for male 
participants. The mean (SD) BW increase from baseline to Week 24 was 1.29 (2.65) kg in the 
alirocumab group and 2.28 (2.65) kg in the placebo group for female participants and 2.41 (2.03) 
kg and 1.71 (3.09) kg, respectively for male participants. 
In the Q4W cohort, the mean (SD) height increase from baseline to Week 24 was 1.47 (1.78) cm 
in the alirocumab group and 1.64 (1.34) cm in the placebo group for female participants and 2.06 
(2.61) cm and 1.88 (1.23) cm, respectively for male participants. The mean (SD) BW increase 
from baseline to Week 24 was 1.48 (3.56) kg in the alirocumab group and 1.78 (3.21) kg in the 
placebo group for female participants and 1.96 (2.64) kg and 2.62 (2.40) kg, respectively for 
male participants. 
There were no clinically meaningful changes over time in other vital signs (heart rate, SBP, and DBP in 
sitting position) in both Q2W and Q4W cohorts.

Tanner stages 
Double-blind treatment period 
Majority of participants were pubescent at baseline. Specifically, 27 (73.0%) participants from the 
alirocumab group and 17 (58.6%) participants were at pubescent stage at baseline in safety population of 
boys, and 29 (45.3%) participants from the alirocumab group and 14 (60.9%) participants from the 
placebo group were at pubescent stage at baseline in safety population of girls. 
As expected, a progression to a more advanced Tanner stage was noted as follows: 
•  5 (14.7%) boys in the alirocumab groups (3 in Q2W cohort and 2 in Q4W cohort) and 11 (39.3%) 
boys in the placebo groups (7 in Q2W cohort and 4 in Q4W cohort) had a change in Tanner stage 
≥1 for the development of external genitalia. 
•  6 (17.6%) boys in the alirocumab groups (2 in Q2W cohort and 4 in Q4W cohort) and 11 (39.3%) 
boys in the placebo groups (6 in Q2W cohort and 5 in Q4W cohort) had a change in Tanner stage 
≥1 for pubic hair. 
•  10 (18.2%) girls in the alirocumab groups (4 in Q2W cohort and 6 in Q4W cohort) and 2 (10.0%) 
girls in the placebo groups (1 in Q2W cohort and 1 in Q4W cohort) had a change in Tanner stage 
≥1 for the breast development. 
•  10 (18.2%) girls in the alirocumab groups (5 in Q2W cohort and 5 in Q4W cohort) and 5 (25.0%) 
girls in the placebo groups (3 in Q2W cohort and 2 in Q4W cohort) had a change in Tanner stage 
≥1 for pubic hair. 
Open-label treatment period 
•  20 (71.4%) boys in the Q2W cohort and 12 (52.2%) boys in the Q4W had a change in Tanner 
stage ≥1 for the development of external genitalia at Week 104. 
•  19 (67.9%) boys in the Q2W cohort and 13 (56.5%) boys in the Q4W cohort had a change in 
Tanner stage ≥1 for pubic hair at Week 104. 
•  16 (59.3%) girls in the Q2W cohort and 19 (47.5%) girls in the Q4W cohort had a change in 
Tanner stage ≥1 for the breast development at Week 104. 
•  19 (70.4%) girls in the Q2W cohort and 19 (47.5%) girls in the Q4W cohort had a change in 
Tanner stage ≥1 for pubic hair at Week 104. 
Cogstate battery test 
Double-blind treatment period 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful changes over time in Cogstate battery test results in both 
Q2W and Q4W cohorts. The mean values of each test results (Detection test, Identification test; One Card 
Learning test; Groton Maze Learning test) at baseline and at Week 24 were similar between intervention 
groups in both cohorts. 
Open-label treatment period 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful changes over time in Cogstate battery test results in the Q2W 
and Q4W cohorts.There were no trends indicative of important vital signs, including systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate abnormalities observed. 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 107/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further, assessments of growth and pubertal development (Tanner stage) showed less progression (≥ 1 
Tanner stage) in boys in the alirocumab group compared with the placebo group  (14.7% vs 39.3% for 
external genitalia and 17.6% vs 39.3% for pubic hair, respectively) and an approximately comparable 
progression in girls (18.2% vs 10.0% for the breast development and 18.2% vs 25% for pubic hair. This 
disbalance in boys is probably due to the higher percentage of pubescent boys at baseline in the 
alirocumab group vs. the placebo group (73.0% vs 58.6%), whereas this was the other way around for 
girls (45.3% vs. 60.9%). Nevertheless, the placebo-controlled safety data of 24 weeks exposure to 
alirocumab is considered too limited to draw firm conclusions on the effect of alirocumab on Tanner 
staging.  
Additionally, assessments of cognitive function (Cogstate battery test) did not reveal a detrimental effect 
of alirocumab. However, the placebo-controlled safety data of 24 weeks of exposure to alirocumab is also 
considered too limited to draw firm conclusions on the effect of alirocumab on cognitive function. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Double-blind treatment period 
No participants in the Q2W cohort and 2 (3.8%) participants in the Q4W cohort (both in the alirocumab 
group) had TEAEs leading to permanent IMP discontinuation. One participant permanently discontinued 
alirocumab due to 2 neurocognitive AESI (PT: disturbance in attention and memory impairment), and the 
other one due to syncope, which was also reported as an SAE. 
Open-label treatment period 
In the Q2W cohort, 1 (1.4%) participant had a TEAE (PT: low density lipoprotein decreased) which led to 
permanent IMP injection discontinuation. Of note, LDL-C decrease is anticipated with alirocumab. None of 
the participants in the Q4W cohort discontinued IMP due to a TEAE.  
The percentage of patients discontinued due to AEs was relatively low (n=2 (3.8%)), indicating that the 
drug is well tolerated. 
Post marketing experience 
In the post-marketing experience, cumulatively from 24 July 2015 to 01 September 2022, a total of 32 
Individual Case Safety Reports for paediatric patients were recorded in the Sanofi Global PV database. It 
represents 0.06% (n=32) of all cases (n= 58 837). Of note, as per the current approved indication, use 
in paediatric population is off-label use.  
Out of the 32 cases, 17 cases reported in the clinical studies EFC14660, DFI14223, and EFC14643 are not 
included in this analysis. 
For the remaining 15 cases: 
• 
In 2 cases, the exposure to alirocumab was improbable due to the patient’s age: 
- 
- 
In 1 case, a 14 day-old-neonate female patient was reported to have experienced 
increasing anxiety, confusion and cognitive fuzziness, all 14 days after starting treatment 
with alirocumab. No further information was provided. 
In 1 case, a 1-month female patient was reported to have experienced leg pain. 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 108/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
For the rest of cases (n=13), the majority (99%) of reported adverse events were nonserious. 
When provided, the age of the patient was between 3 months to 17 years (age not specified in 2 
cases): 
- 
In 1 case, a 1-month old female patient was reported to have experienced leg pain. She 
had expected drug exposure via breast milk, no AE was reported. The patient was 
assessed for well infant exams up to 6 months of age and then on an as-needed basis. No 
abnormalities/concerns were noted regarding cognitive/physical development. 
Off-label use cases with AEs: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In 1 case, a 5-year-old female patient experienced skin reaction 
In 1 case, a 6-year-old male patient experienced injection site reaction. 
In 1 case, a 12-year-old male patient experienced gastroenteritis while being treated 
with alirocumab. 
In 1 case, a 15-year-old female patient was diagnosed with moderate Zika virus 
             infection while being treated with alirocumab. 
Off-label use cases without AEs: 
- 
In 8 other cases, no AEs were reported with the (off-label) use of alirocumab. Among 
these cases, 3 were paediatric patients treated for HoFH. 
No new safety signal was identified in paediatric patients in the post-marketing experience. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety evaluation is primarily based on the double-blind randomized Study EFC14643 in paediatric 
patients with HeFH, supplemented with data from other paediatric studies (Phase 2 dose-finding study 
DFI14223 and the Phase 3 study EFC14660 in HoFH patients) and data from post-marketing surveillance 
for approved indications.  
Patient exposure. In the initial MA dossier, a total of 2856 adult subjects were exposed to alirocumab 
for ≥ 24 weeks of which 2408 subjects for ≥ 52 weeks. With the submission of the cardiovascular outcome 
trial ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, with a total of 18894 patients, the overall exposure data from clinical studies 
has substantially increased, although exposure in the ODYSSEY was limited to a median of 31 months. 
So, there was a large safety experience with alirocumab in adult patients; however, there was none in the 
paediatric population. Nevertheless, experience is obtained based on the data of pivotal Phase 3 Study 
EFC14643 in HeFH patients, supplemented with the Phase 2 dose-finding study DFI14223 and the Phase 
3 study EFC14660 in HoFH patients currently under review.  
In the pivotal study EFC14643, a total of 101 paediatric HeFH patients (49 in the Q2W cohort and 52 in 
the Q4W cohort) received at least 1 dose of alirocumab in the DB treatment period. The mean duration of 
treatment exposure in this period was similar across both treatment groups in both cohorts (23.7 vs. 24.1 
weeks in the Q2W cohort and 22.9 vs. 23.9 weeks in the Q4W cohort for alirocumab and placebo, 
respectively), with a total patient-years exposure of 22.2 in the Q2W cohort and 22.8 in the Q4W cohort. 
In the OL treatment period, the mean duration of treatment was also similar in both cohorts (76.5 weeks 
in the Q2W cohort vs 79.7 weeks in the Q4W cohort), with a patient-years exposure to alirocumab of 
104.1 in the Q2W cohort and 113.1 in the Q4W cohort, which is considered sufficient. To note, since 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 109/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately similar steady-state exposure was achieved after administration of alirocumab between 40 
mg and 75 mg Q2W and 150 mg and 300 mg Q4W (for corresponding BW <50 kg and ≥50 kg), it is 
acceptable to show safety data according to dosing cohort (Q2W vs Q4W) and not differentiate it further 
into BW <50 kg and ≥50 kg. 
Adverse events. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were frequently reported; however, the 
percentage of patients with any TEAE in the DB treatment period was approximately similar across both 
treatment groups in the Q2W cohort (53.1% vs. 52.0% in the alirocumab and placebo group, 
respectively) or lower in the alirocumab compared with the placebo group in the Q4W cohort (50.0% vs. 
59.3%), which is reassuring. In the OL treatment period, the percentage of TEAEs was comparable 
between subjects who received alirocumab and placebo in the DB period in the Q4W cohort  (55.1% vs. 
56.0% in the Q4W cohort) or lower in the alirocumab DB group compared with the placebo DB group in 
the Q2W cohort (52.2% vs. 64.0%). The most frequent AEs with a higher incidence with alirocumab 
compared with placebo (a difference of ≥ 5%) in the Q2W cohort were nasopharyngitis (14.3% vs. 8.0%) 
and injection site reaction (6.1% vs. 0%), while there were not AEs with a notably higher frequency in 
the alirocumab group compared with the placebo group in the Q4W cohort. In the OL treatment period, 
the 2 most frequently reported AEs were headache (8.5%) and nasopharyngitis (7.0%). The AEs 
considered treatment-related by the investigator were reported in 4 (8.2%) subjects in the alirocumab 
Q2W group and 7 (13.5%) in the alirocumab Q4W group. The most frequently related TEAEs were 
injection site reactions. The other AEs considered treatment-related concerned single occurrences in the 
alirocumab group with the exception of syncope (n=2) of which it is agreed with the Applicant that 
causality of alirocumab is unlikely. Moreover, no increased risk for syncope has been observed in the 
initial MA or the ODYSSAY OUTCOME dossier. Consistent with the pivotal study EFC14643, the TEAEs in 
the dose-finding study DFI14223 and the Phase 3 study EFC14660 in HoFH were mild or moderate, with 
injection site reactions, nasopharyngitis, and headache as the most frequently reported. 
AEs of special interest. Special attention has been given to certain AEs, including allergic events, local 
injection site reactions, neurologic events, neurocognitive events, hepatic disorders, diabetes mellitus, 
and cataract. The incidence in general allergic events was low; Only 2 patients (3.8%) in the Q4W cohort 
group experienced a rash event. Local injection site reactions occurred with a higher frequency for 
alirocumab compared with placebo (6.1% vs. 0% in the Q2W cohort and 3.8% vs. 0% in the Q4W cohort, 
respectively). The frequency in local injection site reactions remained stable throughout the study, with 4 
(5.6%) patients  in the Q2W cohort and in 3 (4.1%) participants in the Q4W cohort in the OL treatment 
period. Injection site reaction is already a known ADR from the original dossier. Incidences of neurologic 
and neurocognitive events were very limited (both n=1 from the alirocumab group of the Q4W cohort in 
the DB period), making any conclusions difficult. Furthermore, in the DB treatment period, there were no 
incidences of hepatic disorder, diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications, and cataract.  
Regarding very low LDL-C levels, in the DB treatment period, 4 (8.2%) and 7 (13.5%) patients in the 
alirocumab group of the QW2 and Q4W cohort, respectively, had at least one low LDL-C value of < 1.29 
mmol/L (< 50 mg/dL) of which 3 (5.8%) patients had 2 consecutive LDL-C values < 1.29 mmol/L (all 
Q4W) including 1 (1.9%) participant who had 2 consecutive LDL-C values < 0.65 mmol/L (<25 mg/dL). 
In the OLE period, 7 (10.0%) and 12 (16.2) in the Q2W and Q4W cohort had at least one low LDL-C value 
of < 1.29 mmol/L  of which 1 (1.4%) in the Q2W cohort and 7 (9.5%) in the Q4W cohort had 2 
consecutive LDL-C values < 1.29 mmol/L. Three patients ( 1 in Q2W and 2 in Q4W) had one LDL-C value 
< 0.65 mmol/L. However, there is no evidence of an unexpected safety concern regarding subjects who 
achieved low LDL-C levels, which is consistent with the full dataset available for alirocumab. 
Serious AEs. The percentage of subjects experiencing SAEs was relatively low, however, slightly higher 
in the alirocumab group compared with the placebo group in the Q2W cohort group (8.2% vs. 4.0%), 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 110/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whereas the percentage of SAEs were comparable in the Q4W cohort group (3.8% vs 3.7%). Overall, no 
patterns indicative for a safety signal were observed; all SAEs concerned single events with the exception 
of syncope (n=2) of which the causality to alirocumab was considered unlikely. 
Deaths. No deaths were reported during Study EFC14643. 
Laboratory findings. A low level of immunogenicity (n=3; all in Q2W cohort) was observed in the 
paediatric population in the pivotal Phase 3 study EFC14643. The treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody 
(ADA) responses were classified as very low titer and transient. Further, no participants with neutralizing 
ADA were reported.  
Furthermore, no trends indicative of clinically important treatment-related laboratory abnormalities, 
including hematology parameters, renal and hepatic function parameters, blood glucose, hsCRP, hormone 
levels, and vitamins were observed with alirocumab. 
Vital signs. There were no trends indicative of important vital signs, including systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate abnormalities observed. 
Further, assessments of growth and pubertal development (Tanner stage) showed less progression (≥ 1 
Tanner stage) in boys in the alirocumab group compared with the placebo group  (14.7% vs 39.3% for 
external genitalia and 17.6% vs 39.3% for pubic hair, respectively) and an approximately comparable 
progression in girls (18.2% vs 10.0% for the breast development and 18.2% vs 25% for pubic hair. This 
disbalance in boys is probably due to the higher percentage of pubescent boys at baseline in the 
alirocumab group vs. the placebo group (73.0% vs 58.6%), whereas this was the other way around for 
girls (45.3% vs. 60.9%). Nevertheless, the placebo-controlled safety data of 24 weeks of exposure to 
alirocumab is considered too limited to draw firm conclusions on the effect of alirocumab on Tanner 
staging.  
Additionally, assessments of cognitive function (Cogstate battery test) did not reveal a detrimental effect 
of alirocumab. However, the placebo-controlled safety data of 24 weeks of exposure to alirocumab is also 
considered too limited to draw firm conclusions on the effect of alirocumab on cognitive function. 
Discontinuation due to AEs. The percentage of patients who discontinued due to AEs was relatively low 
(n=2 (3.8%)), indicating that the drug is well tolerated. 
Post marketing experience. It represents 0.06% of all cases (n= 58 837). Out of the 32 cases, 17 
cases reported in the clinical studies EFC14660, DFI14223, and EFC14643. From the remaining cases, no 
new safety signal was identified in paediatric patients in the post-marketing experience. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Alirocumab displays an acceptable safety profile in paediatric HeFH patients aged 8-≤ 17 years compared 
to those observed in adults HeFH in the initial MA dossier and the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES dossier with very 
limited patients discontinuing treatment.  No new safety signal has been identified. Most of the TEAEs 
considered treatment-related were injection site reactions, which is a known ADR of alirocumab. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle

3.  Risk management plan 
The Applicant provided an updated RMP, version 8.0 with the Data Lock Point (DLP) 31 August 2022. The 
rationale for the updated RMP was the extension of the indication in paediatric patients of eight years and 
older with HeFH and to include the results of the clinical trial EFC14643.  
The significant changes were the update of the safety specifications including the removal of the missing 
information ‘Use in children and adolescents’ and an update of the clinical trial exposure. Further, the 
pharmacovigilance plan has been updated with actual information regarding the completed study 
EFC14643 and the pharmacovigilance plan and the rism minimisation measures have been aligned with 
the new list of safety concerns.  
Part I: 
Part I was updated with the extension of the indication in paediatric patients of eight years and older, 
including the dosing scheme for paediatric patients. 
Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
Table39: List of studies described in the clinical trial exposure section SIII.2 
Other supportive studies: 
Considering the development stage and longstanding postmarketing experience of alirocumab (more than 
7 years), the historical exposure data of supportive studies (R727 CL 1308 [CHOICE I]; EFC13786 
[CHOICE II]; LTS13463; Pooled Phase 3 OLE studies - OLE including LTS13463 and OLE of CL 1119 
[ALTERNATIVE]; MSC14864; LPS14245 (APRISE study); R727 CL 1532; R727 CL 1628) were included till 
the RMP version 7.0 and have been removed from RMP version 8.0. 
Exposure data for EFC14643: 
The duration of treatment exposure was similar across intervention groups in both cohorts: in the Q2W 
cohort, the mean (SD) duration of exposure was 23.7 (2.0) weeks for alirocumab group and 24.1 (0.4) 
weeks for placebo group; in the Q4W cohort, the mean (SD) duration of exposure was 22.9 (4.5) weeks 
for alirocumab group and 23.9 (3.3) weeks for placebo group. Of note, the cumulative exposure to 
treatment (patient-years) in the Q2W cohort was 22.2 for alirocumab group and 11.5 for placebo group, 
which in the Q4W cohort was 22.8 for alirocumab group and 12.4 for placebo group. 
Open-label treatment period for EFC14643: 
The duration of treatment exposure was similar in both cohorts: in the Q2W cohort, the mean (SD) 
duration of exposure was 76.5 (14.8) weeks; in the Q4W cohort, the mean (SD) duration of exposure was 
79.7 (6.0) weeks. Cumulative exposure to treatment (patient-years) in the Q2W cohort was 67.8 for 
“Alirocumab in DB period” group and 36.4 for “Placebo in DB period” group, which in the Q4W cohort was 
75.5 for “Alirocumab in DB period” group and 37.6 for “Placebo in DB period” group.

Most of the participants were exposed to the IMP injections for at least 78 weeks: 64 (90.1%) in the Q2W 
cohort and 67 (90.5%) in the Q4W cohort. 
The most frequent sites of alirocumab injection during this study were the outer area of the upper arms 
and the abdomen. 
The module was updated regarding the completed paediatric study EFC14643, including an update of the 
clinical trial exposure, and the section concerning the historical exposure data of supportive studies was 
removed. 
Clinical Trial exposure of the study EFC14643 in the Q2W cohort was 22.2 patient-years for alirocumab 
group and 11.5 for placebo group and in the Q4W cohort 22.8 for alirocumab group and 12.4 for placebo 
group. For OL treatment, the cumulative exposure was in the Q2W cohort 67.8 patient-years for 
“Alirocumab in DB period” group and 36.4 for “Placebo in DB period” group, while in the Q4W cohort it 
was 75.5 patient-years for “Alirocumab in DB period” group and 37.6 for “Placebo in DB period” group.

One case of exposure pregnant women (≥ 12 years old) was added in the section regarding use in 
special populations. The outcome was an elective abortion, no further information were presented. No 
safety concern was identified.  
Part II – Module SV: Post-Marketing Exposure 
Sales figures for the cumulative period were received from MARCO for the period from 01 July 2015 
through 31 July 2022. The cumulative exposure to parenteral alirocumab was estimated to be 313 million 
patient-days corresponding to 857 438 patient-years.  
Partner sales (Regeneron):  
Based on the sales figures provided by the partner Regeneron from 28 July 2015 through 24 July 2022, 
the total cumulative exposure to parenteral alirocumab could be estimated to be 154.2 million patient-
days corresponding to 422 528 patient-years.  
Global cumulative exposure (ie, Sanofi and partner):  
The global cumulative exposure to alirocumab could be estimated to be 467.2 million patient days 
corresponding to 1.3 million patient-years. 
Module SV was updated with actual data regarding post-Marketing Exposure.  
Cumulatively, post-marketing exposure was 313 million patient-days corresponding to 857 438 patient-
years and 154.2 million patient-days corresponding to 422 528 patient-years from partner sales. 
Part II - Module SVII: Identified and potential risks 
New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated RMP 
In the context of the current variation procedure, the MAH has proposed to review the list of safety 
concerns, as described in the RMP version 6.0 version 7.0. 
Following the completion of the EFC14643 study (conducted in paediatric patients ≥8 years) and in 
considering the totality of data now available, the MAH has proposed to remove the missing information 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 114/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“use in children and adolescents” from the list of safety concerns. Overall, alirocumab appeared to be 
well tolerated in paediatric patients consistent with the known safety profile of alirocumab in adults.  
Table 41: Summary of the Safety Concerns 
The missing information ‘use in children and adolescents’ was removed from the list of safety concerns 
based on study results obtained in the completed clinical trial in paediatrics. This is accepted. All sections 
in this module have been updated accordingly.  
Part III – pharmacovigilance plan 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities: 
The following three paediatric studies were part of the pharmacovigilance plan: 
• 
One Phase 2 study DFI14223: an 8 week open-label, sequential, ascending repeated dose-finding 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in children and adolescents with HeFH followed by 
an extension phase. This study has been completed. 
• 
Two Phase 3 completed studies, the EFC14643 (A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study followed by an open label treatment period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in 
children and adolescents with HeFH) and the EFC14660 (An open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of alirocumab in children and adolescents with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia). 
Following completion of PIP, the use in children and adolescents is not considered as missing information 
in the current RMP version 8.0.  
The study EFC14643 is now completed at the DLP of the RMP version 8.0 and is thus proposed to be 
removed from the pharmacovigilance plan. Overall, there are no additional pharmacovigilance activities 
for this product. The details and status of all these studies are provided under Annex 2. 
With the completion of study EFC14643, there are no further additional pharmacovigilance activities 
planned or ongoing. The summary table of additional pharmacovigilance activities was deleted and the 
section was updated accordingly to reflect this change.

Annexes 
In Annex 2, study EFC14643 was deleted from the list of planned and ongoing studies and transferred 
into the table of completed studies. 
Annex 7 was deleted.  
In Annex 8 the changes to the new RMP version 8.0 were displayed.  
3.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.0 is acceptable.  
4.  Update of the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated to include 
the results on treatment with alirocumab in the paediatric HeFH population. The Package Leaflet (PL) has 
been updated accordingly. 
4.1.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
“The PIL has been updated with the dosing schedule for the proposed added population, which is 
largely the same as for the already approved indications for adults, meaning that no new complex 
information is presented. Additionally, as with the already approved indications, the PIL and IFU 
are intended to be used by adults. In children less than 12 years of age, Praluent must be given by 
a caregiver, while in adolescents 12 years and older, Praluent should be given by or under the 
supervision of an adult. With regards to consultation with target patient groups, the applicant’s conclusion 
is that the updated information in the PIL and IFU regarding the new indication for the treatment of 
paediatric patients 8 years of age and older with HeFH does not require additional consultation.” 
5.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
5.1.  Therapeutic Context 
5.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which includes heterozygous and homozygous forms, is an inherited 
disorder of lipid metabolism, characterized by severely elevated levels of LDL-C leading to premature 
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD).  
Heterozygous FH (HeFH) accounts for the large majority of FH overall and is estimated to occur in 
1:250 individuals globally. Untreated LDL-C levels in affected individuals are significantly elevated (7.0 ± 
0.2 mmol/L]) compared with controls ( 2.6 ± 0.1 mmol/L). Despite aggressive statin use, there is still a 
2-fold excess of coronary heart disease (CHD) related deaths relative to age-matched controls within this 
population. 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 117/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The goal of therapy in patients with FH is to reduce LDL-C, which reduces atherogenesis and 
subsequently reduces CVD events and mortality, as demonstrated by the results of the CVOT ODYSSEY 
OUTCOMES study.  
5.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Available lipid-lowering therapies for children with HeFH include: 
•  Statins (oral tablets): Statins has been approved for the treatment of paediatric patients 6 to 17 
years of age with HeFH. According to the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline for the management of 
dyslipidaemias, statin treatment (in combination with a heart-healthy diet) should be considered at 
>8 years of age. Statin treatment should be started with low doses, and the dose should be increased 
to reach therapeutic goals. The therapeutic goal in children >10 years of age is an LDL-C <3.5 
mmol/L (<135 mg/dL), and at younger ages a >50% reduction of LDL-C. 
•  PCSK9 inhibitors (injectable monoclonal antibody or siRNA): Evolocumab, another PCSK9 inhibitor 
mAb , has been approved for the treatment of paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH. 
•  Ezetimibe (oral tablets): Ezetimibe is not indicated for the paediatric HeFH population. According to 
the labeling of Ezetrol (ezetimibe), the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe in children aged 6 to 17 years 
has not been established; available data are described in the SmPC, however, no recommendation on 
a posology can be made.  
•  Apheresis is a non-pharmacological treatment option; a single treatment reduces LDL-C by 55%-
70% relative to pre-treatment levels. However, apheresis may be burdensome and limitedly 
available. Also, only temporal reduction in LDL-C is achieved. 
Some patients, especially those with high LDL-C, are unable to achieve recommended LDL-C levels. Many 
patients with FH cannot achieve recommended goals despite using maximum doses of statin (in 
combination with ezetimibe), further emphasizing the need for additional treatment options. 
5.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The completed paediatric development program is in line with the approved EU PIP (PIP decision number 
P/0550/2021), as also indicated by the completed full compliance check. 
The Phase 3 clinical study (Study EFC14643) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
alirocumab administered at 40 mg or 75 mg Q2W (for BW <50 kg or ≥ 50 kg) and 150 mg or 300 mg 
Q4W (for BW <50 kg or ≥ 50 kg) as a starting dose, on top of an optimal stable daily dose of statin 
therapy ± other LMTs or stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of intolerance to statins, in paediatric 
population 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH. The study was a randomized, 24-week double-blind 
treatment, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study followed by an 80-week open-label treatment period 
with the primary endpoint on percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24.  
5.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoint. Alirocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 
compared with placebo in a population of patients (n=153 with 2:1 ratio) aged 8-≤17 years with 
genetically or clinically confirmed HeFH on optimized background lipid-lowering therapy with a LDL-C 
baseline level of 4.5 mmol/L; The LS mean (SE) difference versus placebo was -43.3% ([97.5% CI: -56.0 
to -30.7]; p<0.0001) in the Q2W cohort, and -33.8% ([97.5% CI: -46.4 to -21.2]; p<0.0001) in the 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 118/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q4W cohort. No differential effect of alirocumab versus placebo was observed between the Q2W and Q4W 
regimens and the BW categories.  
Other endpoints. The LDL-C lowering effect was further supported by the beneficial effects in other lipid 
parameters  (e.g. Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, Lp(a), HDL-C). At Week 24, 77.6% of patients achieved an 
LDL-C level lower than 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL), and 52.7% of patients an LDL-C level lower than 2.84 
mmol/L (110 mg/dL) in the alirocumab group.  
Subgroups. The LDL-C lowering effect appears generally consistent among several subgroups, including 
gender, age (<12, ≥ 12 years) and baseline LDL-C in both Q2W and Q4W cohorts. 
5.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Long term. The percent change of LDL-C from baseline to Week 104 was lower than as compared with 
the DB treatment period ( - 26.3% in the Q2W cohort and -23.9% (33.5) in the Q4W cohort.) 
Other endpoints. In the exploratory flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) sub-study, no difference in absolute 
change from baseline to Week 24 in %FMD was observed (-0.6% vs -2.1% in the alirocumab and placebo 
group, respectively; p=0.5368). 
5.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Exposure. A total of 101 paediatric HeFH patients (49 in the Q2W cohort and 52 in the Q4W cohort) 
were exposed to alirocumab in the DB treatment period with a mean duration of treatment of 23.7 vs. 
24.1 weeks in the Q2W cohort and 22.9 vs. 23.9 weeks in the Q4W cohort for alirocumab and placebo, 
respectively, and a total patient-years exposure of 22.2 in the Q2W cohort and 22.8 in the Q4W cohort. 
In the OL treatment period, the mean duration of treatment was similar in both cohorts (76.5 weeks in 
the Q2W cohort vs 79.7 weeks in the Q4W cohort), with a patient-years exposure to alirocumab of 104.1 
in the Q2W cohort and 113.1 in the Q4W cohort, which is considered sufficient.  
Adverse events. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were frequently reported, however, the 
percentage of patients with any TEAE in the DB treatment period was approximately similar across both 
treatment groups in the Q2W cohort (53.1% vs. 52.0% in the alirocumab and placebo group, 
respectively) or lower in the alirocumab compared with the placebo group in the Q4W cohort (50.0% vs. 
59.3%). The most frequent AEs with a higher incidence with alirocumab compared with placebo (a 
difference of ≥ 5%) in the Q2W cohort were nasopharyngitis (14.3% vs. 8.0%) and injection site 
reaction (6.1% vs. 0%), while there were not AEs with a notably higher frequency in the alirocumab 
group compared with the placebo group in the Q4W cohort. The most frequent treatment related AEs 
were injection site reactions.  
Adverse events of special interest. The incidence in general allergic events was low; Only 2 
patients (3.8%) in the Q4W cohort group experienced a rash event. Local injection site reactions occurred 
with a higher frequency for alirocumab than placebo (6.1% vs. 0% in the Q2W cohort and 3.8% vs. 0% 
in the Q4W cohort, respectively). The frequency in local injection site reactions remained stable 
throughout the study, with 4 (5.6%) patients  in the Q2W cohort and in 3 (4.1%) participants in the Q4W 
cohort in the OL treatment period. Furthermore, in the DB treatment period, there were no incidences of 
hepatic disorder, diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications, and cataract.  
Regarding very low LDL-C levels, in the DB treatment period, 4 (8.2%) and 7 (13.5%) patients in the 
alirocumab group of the QW2 and Q4W cohort, respectively, had at least one low LDL-C value of < 1.29 
mmol/L (< 50 mg/dL) of which 3 (5.8%) patients had 2 consecutive LDL-C values < 1.29 mmol/L (all 
Q4W) including 1 (1.9%) participant who had 2 consecutive LDL-C values < 0.65 mmol/L (<25 mg/dL). 
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 119/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the OLE period, 7 (10.0%) and 12 (16.2) in the Q2W and Q4W cohorts had at least one low LDL-C 
value of < 1.29 mmol/L  of which 1 (1.4%) in the Q2W cohort and 7 (9.5%) in the Q4W cohort had 2 
consecutive LDL-C values < 1.29 mmol/L. Three patients ( 1 in Q2W and 2 in Q4W) had one LDL-C value 
< 0.65 mmol/L. However, there is no evidence of an unexpected safety concern regarding subjects who 
achieved low LDL-C levels. 
Serious AEs. The percentage of subjects experiencing SAEs was relatively low, however, slightly higher 
in the alirocumab group compared with the placebo group in the Q2W cohort group (8.2% vs. 4.0%), 
whereas the percentage of SAEs was comparable in the Q4W cohort group (3.8% vs 3.7%). Again, 
however, no patterns indicative of a safety signal were observed. 
Deaths. There were no deaths reported. 
Immunogenicity. A low level of immunogenicity (n=3; all in Q2W cohort) was observed in the paediatric 
population in the pivotal Phase 3 study EFC14643. The treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
responses were classified as very low titer and transient. Further, no participants with neutralizing ADA 
were reported. 
Laboratory findings. No trends indicated clinically important treatment-related laboratory abnormalities 
including hematology parameters, renal and hepatic function parameters, blood glucose, hsCRP, hormone 
levels, and vitamins were observed with alirocumab. 
Vital signs. There were no trends indicative of important vital signs, including systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate abnormalities observed. 
Tolerability. The percentage of patients discontinued due to AEs was relatively low (n=2 (3.8%)). 
Post marketing experience. It represents 0.06% of all cases (n= 58 837). Of the 32 cases, 17 were 
reported in the clinical studies EFC14660, DFI14223, and EFC14643. From the remaining cases, no new 
safety signal was identified in paediatric patients in the post-marketing experience. 
5.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Adverse events of special interest. An increased risk of neurocognitive and neurological 
abnormalities was not observed. However, the data are considered limited, which precludes appropriate 
assessment. 
Very low LDL-C levels. No safety signal with very low LDL-C levels has emerged as yet. However, only 
limited safety data exist in (paediatric) patients with very low LDL-C. 
Vital signs. Assessments of growth and pubertal development (Tanner stage) and cognitive function  
did not reveal a detrimental effect. However, the safety data, particularly the placebo-controlled safety 
data of 24 weeks of exposure to alirocumab, is considered too limited to draw firm conclusions.

5.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
5.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which includes heterozygous (HeFH) and homozygous (HoFH) forms, 
is an inherited disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by severely elevated levels of LDL-C leading to 
premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). HeFH accounts for the large majority of FH 
overall and is estimated to occur in 1:250 individuals globally. Despite aggressive statin use, this 
population still has a 2-fold excess of coronary heart disease (CHD) related deaths relative to age-
matched controls. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for additional LDL-C lowering therapies. 
According to the ESC guideline (2019), the goals for treatment of children with FH > 10 years of age 
should be LDL-C < 3.5 mmol/L  and at younger ages ≥ 50% reduction of LDL-C. It must be noted that 
evolocumab, another PCSK9 inhibitor mAb, has been approved for treating paediatric HeFH patients 10-
≤17 years of age. 
This extension of indication application is based on efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 study 
EFC14643 supplemented with efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 dose-finding study (Study 
DFI14223) and safety data from the Phase 3 study in paediatric participants with HoFH (Study EFC14660) 
to include treatment of paediatric HeFH patients 8-≤17 years of age in line with the approved EU PIP 
P/0550/2021 as also indicated by the completed full compliance check. 
Alirocumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 compared with 
placebo in a population of patients (n=153 with 2:1 ratio) aged 8-≤17 years with genetically or clinically 
confirmed HeFH on optimized background lipid-lowering therapy with a LDL-C baseline level of 4.5 
mmol/L; The LS mean (SE) difference versus placebo was -43.3% ([97.5% CI: -56.0 to -30.7]; 
p<0.0001) in the Q2W cohort, and -33.8% ([97.5% CI: -46.4 to -21.2]; p<0.0001) in the Q4W cohort at 
week 24. No differential effect on LDL-C of alirocumab versus placebo was observed between the Q2W 
and Q4W regimens and the BW categories. Moreover, at week 24, 77.6% of patients achieved the 
treatment goal of LDL-C < 3.4 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) for paediatric HeFH patients recommended in the 
ESC guideline for the management of dyslipidaemias (2019). The changes in LDL-C are considered to be 
clinically relevant effects as LDL-C is an important surrogate endpoint with potential benefits in terms of a 
cardiovascular outcome, as previously confirmed by the results of the ODYSSEY OUTCOME study. The 
long-term OL period demonstrated maintenance of effect, although the effect size in LDL-C lowering of - 
26.3% in the Q2W cohort and -23.9% in the Q4W at week 104 was lower compared with the DB period 
most likely due to reduced compliance, however, the LDL-C lowering effect is still considered clinically 
relevant. The LDL-C lowering effect was supported by the beneficial effects in other lipid parameters (e.g. 
Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, Lp(a), HDL-C).  
Regarding safety, alirocumab displays an acceptable safety profile in paediatric HeFH patients aged 8-≤ 17 
years compared to those observed in adults HeFH in the initial MA dossier and the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES 
dossier with very limited patients discontinuing treatment. Additionally, alirocumab did not cause any 
clinically relevant differences in adverse events of special interest, including allergic events, neurologic 
events, neurocognitive events, hepatic disorders, diabetes mellitus, and cataract. No new safety signal 
has been identified. Most of the TEAEs considered treatment related were injections site reactions, which 
is a known ADR of alirocumab from the initial MA dossier.  
CHMP Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/529151/2023 
Page 122/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding the proposed posology, based on the efficacy and safety results and given the lower patient 
burden associated with monthly injections as compared to bi-weekly injections, the 150 mg or 300 mg 
Q4W for BW < 50 and ≥ 50 kg, respectively, starting dose regimen is proposed for children and 
adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with HeFH in section 4.2 of the SmPC, which is acceptable. Regarding 
the proposed dose up-titration, it can be concluded that paediatric patients with HeFH who do not reach 
the recommended LDL-C treatment target with the starting dose of alirocumab may benefit from the 
proposed dose adjustment. Therefore, the proposed up-titration regimen of 75 mg Q2W for BW < 50 kg 
or 150 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg is acceptable.  
5.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Benefits of alirocumab in terms of a substantial reduction in LDL-C are accompanied by limited risks. 
5.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
5.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of alirocumab for the paediatric HeFH patients aged 8-≤ 10 years is positive 
6.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following

Extension of indication to include treatment of paediatric patients 8 years of age and older with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with 
other LDL-C lowering therapies, based on final results from study EFC14643 listed as a category 3 study 
in the RMP; this is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an open-label 
treatment period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in children and adolescents with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 8.0 of the RMP was agreed 
during the procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to

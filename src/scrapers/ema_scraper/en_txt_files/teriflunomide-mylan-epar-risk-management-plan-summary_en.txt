SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Teriflunomide Mylan (teriflunomide) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Teriflunomide Mylan. The RMP details 
important risks of teriflunomide, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about teriflunomide's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Teriflunomide Mylan’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how it should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Teriflunomide  Mylan  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  the 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Teriflunomide Mylan’s RMP. 
The Medicine and What it is Used For 
Teriflunomide  Mylan  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  relapsing  remitting 
multiple sclerosis (MS). It contains teriflunomide as the active substance and it is given by oral 
route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Teriflunomide Mylan’s benefits can be found in 
Teriflunomide Mylan’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/teriflunomide-mylan. 
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise the 
Risks 
Important risks of Teriflunomide Mylan together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined 
below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly. 
•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  events  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed, so that immediate action can be taken, as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Teriflunomide Mylan is not yet available, 
it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
In the case of Teriflunomide Mylan, these routine measures are supplemented with additional risk 
minimisation measures, mentioned under relevant risks below. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Teriflunomide Mylan are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further  investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken  by 
patients. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Teriflunomide Mylan. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, 
but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to 
be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine/use in special patient populations etc.).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a progressive, irreversible, and life-threatening disease 
(please see below). There are very few therapeutic options, which have clear limitations.  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is a rare, progressive and fatal disease caused by 
mutations in the TTR gene. Single point mutations destabilize the tetrameric structure of the TTR 
protein, causing its dissociation into free misfolded monomers. These monomers subsequently 
aggregate to insoluble, extracellular amyloid fibril deposits resulting in cellular degeneration and death 
[Quintas, 2001; Plante Bordeneuve, 2011]. Amyloid deposits accumulate in multiple organs, 
particularly the peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and heart, which manifests in 
progressive polyneuropathy including sensorimotor neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy. 
Cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, and gastrointestinal dysfunction frequently develop simultaneously. 
The phenotypic presentation of the disease is dependent on the pattern of affected organs. Historically, 
hATTR has been phenotypically divided into hATTR with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN) with predominant 
involvement of peripheral nerves and gastrointestinal (GI) tract and hATTR with cardiomyopathy 
(hATTR-CM). However, due to the multiple organ deposition of amyloid, the disease has a wide clinical 
spectrum with the majority of patients exhibiting many of these manifestations to some degree.  
The disease nomenclature used within this report has been updated to be consistent with more 
recently defined standards of classification [Sipe, 2016], i.e., use of hATTR-PN instead of familial 
amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), and hATTR-CM instead of familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC), 
except for historic references to orphan drug designation, study title, and previous regulatory and 
scientific discussions. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The worldwide prevalence of hATTR-PN has been estimated at approximately 10,000 patients [Coelho, 
2008]. In Europe, the incidence is estimated as 0.003 cases per 10,000 per year (or 0.3 new cases per 
year per 1 million inhabitants), with a prevalence estimate of 0.052 per 10,000 (or 5.2 cases per 
1 million inhabitants) [Coelho et al., “A Guide to Transthyretin Amyloidosis”, Amyloidosis Foundation, 
2016 Edition]. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
So far, 119 point mutations in the TTR gene have been reported with Val30Met (V30M) being the most 
prevalent. Each TTR mutation results in widely different clinical manifestation, age of symptom onset 
and rate of hATTR disease progression, even in patients with the same underlying mutation. 
Early onset of hATTR symptoms between the third to fourth decades of life leads to rapid deterioration 
of the patients’ health due to progression of autonomic and sensory-motor deficits, whereas the 
polyneuropathy slowly develops after late onset of the disease between the sixth and eighth decades of 
life. The average life expectancy is 3 to 15 years after diagnosis [Gertz, 2017]. Presence of significant

cardiomyopathy is associated with poorer prognosis. Patients typically die from malnutrition and 
cachexia, renal failure and cardiac disease [Coelho, 2008]. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  and stage/prognosis 
The main clinical manifestations of hATTR-PN are progressive peripheral sensorimotor and autonomic 
neuropathy [Plante Bordeneuve, 2011]. Non-specific and symmetrical numbness, pain, and 
temperature sensitivity typically begins in the lower extremities, progressing distal to proximal. Motor 
neuropathy follows within a few years, which affects ambulatory status [Coutinho, 1980; Sekijima, 
2009; Plante Bordeneuve, 2011]. Hereditary ATTR-PN is classified into 3 stages based on ambulatory 
status of the hATTR patient [Coutinho, 1980]: in Stage 1, the patients present with weaknesses in the 
lower limbs and do not require assistance with ambulation, while they show gait dysfunctions, distal 
amyotrophies and hand involvement in Stage 2 and depend on assistance with ambulation, and are 
either wheel-chair bound or bedridden with generalised weakness and areflexia in Stage 3. This staging 
system was used to classify severity of disease in patients being considered for enrolment in the 
pivotal clinical study of inotersen (CS2). Disease severity can be also assessed using the 
Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score, which is a 5-stage scoring system [Suhr, 1996]. 
Life-threatening autonomic dysfunction develops in many patients, affecting the cardiocirculatory, 
gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. Symptoms include orthostatic hypotension, which can lead 
to dizziness and frequent falls. Gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhoea, severe constipation, 
alternating diarrhoea/constipation, vomiting, and gastroparesis, all leading to progressive weight loss. 
Urinary symptoms, fecal incontinence, and, in men, erectile dysfunction may be present [Plante 
Bordeneuve, 2011]. 
Amyloid deposits in the kidney are common and can result in microalbuminuria with progression to 
renal failure in a subset of patients. Symptoms of chronic kidney disease may include lower extremity 
edema, anemia, fatigue and weakness, and decrease in appetite. 
Cardiac involvement has been estimated to occur in 80% of ATTR [Plante Bordeneuve, 2011]. In 
subjects with hATTR-CM, mutant TTR amyloid fibrils infiltrate the myocardium, with resultant diastolic 
dysfunction progressing to restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure [Castańo, 2015]. Conduction 
abnormalities and arrhythmias are also common and many patients require pacemaker and/or 
defibrillator insertion. 
Given the severity of hATTR, there is a significant impact on patients’ and caregivers’ quality of life 
[Gertz, 2017; Stewart, 2013]. Caregivers have moderate to high levels of fatigue and spend a 
significant amount of time caring for patients. Hereditary ATTR is associated with a substantial 
disruption in employment rates and work productivity. There is also a large mental health burden on 
both caregivers and patients. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current therapeutic strategies to treat hATTR include orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) or 
pharmacotherapy with tafamidis or off-label use of diflunisal, both of which are TTR stabilizers that 
work by preventing dissociation of the tetramer into amyloid-forming monomers [Adams, 2016]. 
Because most of the amyloidogenic mutated TTR is secreted by the liver, OLT results in rapid 
disappearance of mutant TTR protein from the serum. However, wild-type TTR protein continues to be 
produced by the donor liver and can aggregate with pre-existing amyloid deposits in the tissues after 
transplantation, leading to continuous disease progression and, in some cases, accelerating heart

disease [Liepnieks, 2007; Liepnieks, 2010; Yazaki, 2000; Yazaki, 2007]. Younger patients with early 
disease, V30M mutation, and mild symptoms (typically Stage 1) generally experience better outcomes 
with OLT. Stage 2 patients are often not candidates for OLT due to advanced age, cardiac involvement, 
or other health reasons [Herlenius, 2004; Stangou, 2004].  
Since 2011, tafamidis (“Vyndaqel”; EMEA/H/C/2294) is approved across the EU for the treatment of 
ATTR in adult subjects with Stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurological 
impairment and has also been licensed in Japan and several other countries. Diflunisal is a non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is presently used off-label in subjects with Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 disease [Adams, 2016]; however, the cardiovascular and renal side effects associated with the 
NSAID class limit the use of this drug in older patients with hATTR-PN or patients with hATTR CM. 
Consequently, there continues to be an unmet medical need for effective and well tolerated treatments 
for subjects with ATTR (both hereditary and wild type) in European Union and worldwide. 
About the product 
Inotersen (also known as ISIS 420915) is a chimeric 20-mer phosphorothioate ASO consisting of ten 
central 2’-deoxyribonucleotides that are flanked by five 2’-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2’-MOE) 
ribonucleotides at each of the 5’- and 3’-termini (5-10-5 gapmer structure). These chemical 
modifications aim to enhance stability against nuclease-mediated degradation and reduce potential 
side effects associated with the polyanionic nature of phosphorothioate ASOs. Inotersen was designed 
to bind to the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of human TTR mRNA, which promotes RNase H1-
mediated cleavage of the mRNA. This prevents production of the TTR protein. 
Inotersen has been formulated as a sterile 200 mg/ml nonadecasodium salt solution (equivalent to 
189 mg inotersen) in pre-filled syringes for single use. Each pre-filled syringe contains the 
recommended once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of 284 mg inotersen in 1.5 ml. 
Inotersen is not approved for use for any indication anywhere in the world. The clinical development 
program for inotersen for hATTR was designed based on feedback from regulatory authorities in the 
European Union and United States. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on:  
 
The fact that familial ATTR is a rare disorder, which, with continuous progression over time, 
leads to complete disability, bedridden status, and ultimately death usually within 10 to 15 
years from symptoms onset. There are only two treatment options currently available for 
hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN), liver transplantation and 
tafamidis, which both have considerable limitations. 
  A clear unmet medical need, especially for patients with Stage 2 and Stage 3 hATTR-PN. 
  A mechanism of action, which appears to be mediated via an inhibitory action and not via a 
TTR stabilization action. 
 
Promising efficacy results for the two co-primary endpoints (the modified Neuropathy 
Impairment Score +7 (mNIS +7) and Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL-DN)), 
which are supportive of the efficacy of inotersen demonstrating significant changes from

nonadecasodium salt corresponding to the molecular formula C230H299N69O121P19S19Na19. It has a 
relative molecular mass of 7600.8 Da (nonadecasodium salt) and the following structure (Figure 1).

Figure 1: active substance structure 
The sequence of the oligonucleotide is:  
5ʹ-MeUMeCMeUMeUGGTTAMeCATGAAAMeUMeCMeCMeC-3ʹ  
Underlined letters are 2ʹ-O-(2-methoxyethyl)ribonucleotides; non-underlined letters are 2ʹ-
deoxyribonucleotides; all pyrimidines are 5-methylated; all linkages are phosphorothioates; the 
compound is the nonadecasodium salt.  
The absolute configuration of each 2-deoxy-D-ribose unit is (1R, 3S, 4R). The absolute configuration of 
each 2-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-D-ribose unit is (1R, 2R, 3R, 4R). The absolute configuration at each 
phosphorus atom is undefined. As other phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, inotersen is a mixture of 2n 
diastereoisomers hence inotersen (where n=19) is a mixture of 219 (524,288) diastereoisomers.  
Inotersen sodium exists as a white to pale yellow amorphous solid. It is freely soluble in water, 
phosphate buffer pH 7.5 and phosphate buffer pH 8.5. 
The chemical structure and sequence of the active substance has been adequately characterised and 
confirmed. Results of IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 31P-NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, mass 
spectrometry and sequencing data have been provided. The measured masses and the theoretical 
masses for the fragments are in compliance. Thermodynamic characterisation data (thermogravimetry 
and DSC), solid state form and X-ray powder diffraction, crystallinity, melting point to a 
complementary strand, solubility, UV spectrum and molar absorption coefficient have been provided. 
Adequate information on stereochemistry has been provided. Because the factors that impact 
internucleotide linkage stereochemistry, i.e., the identities of the coupling partners in each cycle and 
the choice of activator (DCI), are fixed, the synthesis of inotersen sodium proceeds in a stereo-
controlled manner to furnish a reproducible diastereoisomeric mixture.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Inotersen sodium is synthesised by solid phase synthesis in five main steps using well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. It is manufactured in one manufacturing site. 
Step 1. Synthesis Stage 
Step 2. Cleavage and Deprotection Stage 
Step 3. Purification Stage  
Step 4. Tangential Flow Filtration Stage  
Step 5. Lyophilisation Stage  
A single synthesis is processed through to a single active substance lot.  
The manufacturing process of inotersen sodium has been developed using a combination of 
conventional univariate studies and elements of Quality by Design (QbD), in line with ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, 
and Q11. Consistent with ICH Q11, a systematic, science, and risk-based approach was applied to 
evaluate, understand and improve the manufacturing process for inotersen sodium. A comprehensive 
description of the development has been provided. The described quality target product profile (QTPP) 
is reasonable and the selection of the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) has been adequately justified. 
Quality risk management is applied throughout the product lifecycle to drive product development and 
continuous improvement. High level sufficient information on quality risk management has been 
provided. 
Critical process parameters (CPP) and process parameters (PP) have been defined and are included in 
the description of the manufacturing process. Design spaces and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) 
have been defined for certain steps of the commercial manufacturing process. Good process 
understanding has been demonstrated and the classification of CPPs and PPs is acceptable. Summaries 
of the risk assessments, the description of initial screening and scoping experiments to identify 
potential CPPs and interactions between parameters and attributes and the design of experiments for 
the development of the design spaces are conclusive. Parameters that are defined as PARs or are part 
of a design space were explored at the limits of their ranges. The process scalability has been 
demonstrated to be valid for the commercial scale. The defined design spaces, PARs and the 
classification of PPs and CPPs are acceptable. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design 
spaces and PARs. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Suitable starting 
materials for this synthetic oligonucleotide have been selected. The suppliers of the starting materials 
are stated in the dossier. Detailed information on starting material impurities and their classification 
has been provided.  This classification is adequately justified and the impact on the active substance 
impurity profile has been evaluated. The overall control strategy is acceptable and its development 
using an enhanced approach has been intensively described and justified. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. A risk assessment of the commercial route of synthesis for 
potential mutagenic impurities was conducted in accordance with ICH M7. The result of the risk 
assessment that no mutagenic impurities are identified as inotersen sodium CQAs is acceptable.

The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. The comparability of inotersen sodium manufactured by development 
and commercial routes has been demonstrated by analytical testing. 
The active substance  is packaged in HDPE bottles with polypropylene closures which comply with the 
EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification is based on the identified CQAs and includes tests for description, 
identification (accurate mass measurement by MS and molecular sequencing by mass spectrometry 
fragmentation (MS-MS)), sodium counter ion content (ICP-OES), full length product content, inotersen 
content (purity) and product related impurities (all measured by IP-HPLC-UV-MS), water (KF), 
microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
The grouping of impurities as proposed by the Applicant in the specification is acceptable and reflects 
the specific properties of impurity profiles for synthetic antisense oligonucleotides. Impurities limits 
were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. All results were within the currently 
proposed specifications.  
Process adaptions made in the manufacturing process have resulted in higher purity for the most 
recent batches. Consequently the acceptance criteria for impurities, full length product content, 
inotersen content and the sum of impurities were tightened during the procedure. The CHMP 
recommends that while these revised acceptance criteria in the active substance specification are 
acceptable, in order to take account of scientific and technical progress, and to optimise purity, the 
applicant should submit a variation to update the specifications after additional drug substance batches 
are manufactured so that the proposed specifications are based on data from a total of 12 batches 
manufactured with the current process (see List of Recommendations). 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 batches of inotersen sodium active substance manufactured at production-scale 
by Route A2 at Nitto Denko Avecia, the proposed commercial manufacturer, stored in the intended 
commercial packaging for up to 15 months at long term conditions (-20°C) for up to 6 months at 
intermediate conditions ( 5°C ), and on for up to 3 months at accelerated conditions (30°C / 75% RH) 
according to ICH guidelines were provided . 
Additionally, supportive stability from 3 batches of inotersen sodium active substance manufactured at 
production-scale by Route A1 (demonstrated to be comparable to Route A2) at Ionis Pharmaceuticals 
stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 24 months at long term conditions (-20°C), 6 
months at intermediate conditions (5°C) and for 3 months at long term conditions (30°C / 75% RH) 
were provided.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release and were stability indicating. No significant change was observed for any parameter at any 
storage conditions. All results complied with the specification limits.

Results of photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B and forced degradation under stress 
conditions (60°C, acidic, basic, oxidation) were also provided on one batch. Degradation to varying 
degrees was observed under all stressed conditions. Mass balance was achieved for all stressed 
samples. 
According to ICH Q1E guideline extrapolation of stability data is not acceptable for new drug 
substances intended for storage in a freezer and the re-test period should be based on long-term data. 
Nevertheless, the proposed re-test period of 24 months if stored protected from light at -20°C is 
acceptable since it has been demonstrated that the results from the supportive stability studies are 
representative also for the primary stability batches. The comparability of the active substance 
produced via Routes A1 and A2 and have been demonstrated; the differences between specifications 
and analytical methods applicable for stability studies during the stages of development have been 
adequately described and justified.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable and support the proposed retest period of 24 months if stored protected from light at 
-20°C in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Inotersen Solution for Injection is a sterile, clear, colourless to pale yellow solution, essentially free 
from visible particles, containing 284 mg/1.5 mL (189 mg/mL) of inotersen (free acid basis).  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The QTPP was defined as a sterile, low endotoxin, product for subcutaneous injection, containing 284 
mg / 1.5 ml inotersen free acid base with a high assurance of product purity, quality and stability. The 
CQAs  and their relationship to the QTPP were defined. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. Initially, 
Inotersen Solution for Injection, 189 mg/mL, was supplied to the clinic in a vial configuration. The first 
vial configuration contained a 1.0 mL nominal volume in a 2 mL vial. As development proceeded and 
the target dose was established, the configuration was changed to a 1.5 mL nominal volume in a 3 mL 
vial. During Phase 3 clinical testing, a prefilled syringe (PFS) presentation was introduced for patient 
safety and convenience. The PFS delivers a dose of 284 mg in a delivered volume of 1.5 mL via 
subcutaneous injection. 
In the course of development and clinical trials, the finished product was manufactured at different 
manufacturing sites however, the manufacturing process comprising dissolving the active substance in 
WFI, pH adjustment, sterile filtration and filling of the container closure system remained basically the 
same. The QTPP, CQAs and CPPs have been identified and investigated in a risk assessment. The 
defined QTPP, CQAs and CPPs are in accordance with general expectations concerning the development 
and manufacture of an aqueous solution for subcutaneous injection in a pre-filled syringe. 
The finished product is aseptically prepared and sterilised by filtration. The provided justification for 
not applying heat sterilisation in the final container is accepted, as degradation products increased 
significantly after a treatment of 8 minutes at 121°C. 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018

A risk assessment for metal impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D was provided. Compatibility studies 
with other medicinal products were not performed and are not necessary as the Tegsedi is a solution 
not co-administered with any other product. 
The  finished  product  is  supplied  in  a  Type  1  glass  prefilled  syringe  (PFS)  with  a  staked  needle  and 
needle  shield  assembled  into  a  Safety  Syringe  Device  (SSD).  The  SSD  consists  of  a  needle  guard 
subassembly  with  extended  finger  flange  and  plunger  rod.  Relevant  extractables  and  leachables 
studies have been performed. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of 
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use 
of the product. Suitability of the PFS is demonstrated by container closure integrity testing and stability 
results. The SSD was developed according to industry standards and guidance documents pertaining to 
medical devices and combination products.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: active substance equilibration, formulation and 
mixing,  bioburden  reduction  filtration,  sterilizing  filtration,  and  filling  and  stoppering.  This  is  followed 
by safety syringe device assembly and inspection. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process / pharmaceutical form.  
Due  to  the  limited  finished  product  manufacturing  history  the  Applicant  committed  to  evaluate  the 
unfiltered bulk bioburden results for the first 10 finished product lots with the intent of establishing a 
tightened  acceptance  criterion  (see  List  of  Recommendations).  The  current  acceptance  criterion  is 
accepted  because  the  crucial  limit  of  the  bulk  solution  is  subsequently  controlled  as  an  in-process 
control prior to the sterile filtration step.  
The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. During the initial assessment, 
as only a process validation protocol, media fill and filter validation results was provided, the absence 
of full scale process validation data was raised as a major objection. In response, validation results for 
three  consecutive  commercial  size  batches  comprising  all  unit  operations  and  hold  times  were 
provided. The process qualification batches met all requirements outlined in the validation protocol and 
all  specification  limits  demonstrating  that  the  manufacturing  process  of  inotersen  finished  product  is 
under  control.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  specifications  shown  in  Tables  5  &  6  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of 
dosage form; description, identification (by accurate mass measurement by MS  and by duplex melting 
temperature),  inotersen  content  and  product  related  impurities  (IP-HPLC-UV-MS),  deliverable  volume 
(Ph.  Eur.),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  particulate  matter  (Ph.  Eur.),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.), 
osmolality  (USP),  bacterial  endotoxins  (Ph.  Eur.),  sterility  (Ph.  Eur.),  container  closure  integrity 
(validated dye ingress) and  syringe performance testing (ISO). 
The acceptance criteria for product related impurities were tightened during the procedure. A 
justification for not including a biological activity test was accepted. The analytical methods used have 
been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for batches manufactured in the prefilled syringe (PFS) 
configuration and used as part of stability studies and/or clinical trials. The batch analysis results

confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data was provided from 3 batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under long 
term  conditions  (2-8°C)  and  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (30°C/75%RH)  according  to  the 
ICH guidelines were provided. These batches of Tegsedi are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing; type I glass pre-filled syringes with 
safety device and thermoform tray.  
Supportive  stability  data  was  provided  for  3  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  12  months 
under long term conditions (2-8°C) and 6 months under accelerated conditions (30°C/75%RH) in pre-
filled syringes without safety device and thermoform tray; 3 batches of finished product stored for up 
to  18  months  under  long  term  conditions  (2-8°C)  and  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions 
(30°C/75%RH)  in  pre-filled  syringes  where  a  different  finished  product  manufacturing  process  and 
different active substance manufacturer were used and 2 batches of finished product stored for up to 
36  and  60  months  under  long  term  conditions  (2-8°C)  and  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions 
(30°C/75%RH) in glass vials.  
Samples  were  tested  in  line  with  the  shelf  life  specifications.  The  analytical  procedures  used  were 
stability  indicating.  In  addition,  one  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
No significant change in any attribute has been observed during the stability studies of the pre-filled 
syringes and the vials under long-term or accelerated storage conditions. The finished product is 
susceptible to light exposure (degradation observed) which is reflected in the SmPC with the advice 
“Store in the original package in order to protect from light”. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months and “Store in a refrigerator (2 
°C – 8 °C); Do not freeze; Store in the original package in order to protect from light” as stated in the 
SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.  
The statement in the SmPC “Inotersen-Ionis may be stored unrefrigerated for up to 6 weeks at a 
temperature not above 30°C. If not used within 6 weeks, it should be discarded.” is considered 
acceptable based on the provided data. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant has 
applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product and their 
manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of the 
active substance. The design spaces have been adequately verified.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant should submit a variation to update the specifications after additional drug substance 
batches are manufactured so that the proposed specifications are based on data from a total of 12 
batches manufactured with the current process. 
2.  Due to the limited drug product manufacturing history, the Applicant commits to evaluate the 
unfiltered bulk bioburden results for the first 10 drug product lots with the intent of establishing a 
tightened acceptance criterion. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical testing strategy for inotersen followed a development pathway typical for a new 
chemical entity (Olejniczak et al. 2001) rather than the developmental programme more recently 
recommended for oligonucleotide drugs.  
The doses selected for the nonclinical pharmacodynamic studies were intended to evaluate a full range 
of dose-response activity. Inotersen is 100% complementary to the human and Cynomolgus monkey 
TTR mRNA and, hence, exhibits pharmacological activity in humans and monkeys. However, the 
inotersen sequence contains several mismatches to the TTR mRNA of rodents and rabbits, which 
preclude its pharmacological activity in these species. For this reason, mouse- and rat-specific 
analogues of inotersen were included in the toxicology evaluations in order to distinguish toxicity 
associated with reduction of the target (TTR) from toxicities related to the chemistry of the 
oligonucleotide. 
The pharmacologic evaluation of inotersen included demonstration of sequence-specific reduction of 
human TTR in vitro and in monkeys as well as in transgenic mice expressing mutant human TTR 
in vivo. The predicted absence of off-target RNA suppression was confirmed in vitro . Safety 
pharmacology studies using inotersen were conducted to evaluate the potential effects of inotersen on 
cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous system (CNS) function. 
Studies were also performed to characterize the absorption, tissue distribution, metabolism and 
elimination of inotersen. The pharmacokinetic assessment included a complete characterization of 
plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics following single and repeated SC injections. The bioanalytical 
methods used allowed for the sensitive detection of the plasma levels as well as for the full 
characterization of tissue distribution, metabolism and clearance.  
The comprehensive toxicology program of inotersen was conducted in accordance with pertinent ICH 
guidelines and exceeded in part prevailing recommendations for oligonucleotide drugs (Cavagnaro 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 20/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
et al., 2014; Berman et al., 2016): 1) repeat dose studies for up to 26 weeks in mice and rats, and for 
up to 39 weeks in monkeys; 2) the “core battery” of safety pharmacology studies; 3) standard in vitro 
and in vivo genotoxicity studies; 4) reproductive and developmental studies in mice and rabbits; 5) 
carcinogenicity studies in Tg.rasH2 mice; and 6) an in vitro platelet activation study, in vivo 
antigenicity in mice and monkeys as well as immunotoxicity and impurity qualification studies in mice. 
The Cynomolgus monkey is regarded as the most relevant nonclinical species for evaluation of  
inotersen, because inotersen is pharmacologically active in this species and elicited toxicities that are 
largely known for the class of oligonucleotide drugs containing the same backbone chemistry with 
stabilising modifications. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Inotersen was identified in a screen of more than 400 candidate ASOs that had been designed to 
selectively inhibit translation of human TTR mRNA. Inotersen binds to the 3’-UTR of human TTR mRNA. 
The specificity of inotersen was confirmed in silico, which revealed 100 % complementary to the 
cognate TTR mRNA of humans and monkeys, whereas the analogous sequence contains 8 mismatches 
in mice and rats and 4 mismatches in rabbits that preclude efficient formation of a thermodynamically 
stable nucleic acid hybrid complex. Therefore, inotersen is only pharmacodynamically active in humans 
and monkeys. 
Accordingly, inotersen concentration-dependently inhibited TTR mRNA translation in human HepG2 
cells, in primary hepatocytes of transgenic mice overexpressing the mutated I84S variant of the 
human TTR gene (I84S transgenic mice) and in primary hepatocytes of monkeys. 
In vivo, twice weekly s.c. injections of 10 to 100 mg/kg inotersen for four weeks dose-dependently 
reduced the levels of human TTR mRNA in liver and circulating TTR protein in plasma of I84S 
transgenic mice. TTR mRNA and protein reductions were maximal (≥70 %) between two to four days 
post dosing and persisted for 1 to 2 weeks before gradual recovery to pre-treatment levels. The ED50 
values for human TTR mRNA and protein reductions in I84S transgenic mice were about 16.6 and 
22.7 mg/kg/week and were reverse proportional to hepatic inotersen EC50 values of 132 and 184 µg/g, 
respectively. 
Likewise, s.c. injections of 25 mg/kg inotersen for 12 weeks significantly inhibited hepatic TTR mRNA 
and TTR protein in plasma of monkeys by 78 % and 76 % in a time-dependent-manner. 
Concomitantly, the plasma level of Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP4), which is normally prevented from 
renal elimination by complexing with TTR, was time-dependently reduced in the monkeys by 
approximately 60 %. However, no significant effects on thyroid hormone levels and the histology of 
thyroid and retinol-dependent tissues were detected in these animals, albeit the TTR carrier protein 
normally transports about 15 % of thyroxine. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacology studies have not been conducted with inotersen. ASOs are predicted to be 
highly selective to their target sequences and secondary off-target actions are expected to be minimal 
as demonstrated by an in silico analysis conducted as part of the design of inotersen. In addition, 
inotersen proved not to suppress any potential off-target transcript with contiguous matches 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 21/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
≥10 nucleotides in vitro and no unexpected off-target pharmacologic effects were noted in the 
nonclinical toxicity studies. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In safety pharmacology studies, inotersen did not inhibit hERG currents in vitro up to 300 µM and did 
not affect cardiovascular or respiratory function of telemetered monkeys following s.c. injections up to 
40 mg/kg. Moreover, inotersen did not change neurobehavioural parameters in a modified Irwin test in 
mice after s.c. doses of up to 300 mg/kg corresponding to a maximum inotersen liver concentration of 
175 µg/g. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic studies have been performed to evaluate possible interactions of inotersen with 
other drugs that may be co-administered. Since inotersen inhibits the translation of the TTR mRNA by 
promoting its degradation with high selectivity, the likelihood of pharmacological action on other 
transcripts is very small. 
As such, the probability of pharmacological drug-drug interactions in ATTR patients receiving inotersen 
in combination with other co-medications is very low due to the specificity of mode of action of 
inotersen. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic properties were investigated after single s.c. injection of a 3H-labelled inotersen 
analogue in rats as well as following repeated s.c. administration of inotersen for 6 weeks in mice. 
These in vivo data were complemented with inotersen determinations in plasma, urine and tissue 
samples collected in repeated-dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. Part of these analyses also included evaluations of the 
metabolic profile of inotersen. 
Inotersen was readily absorbed after s.c. injection showing high plasma protein binding >94 % in 
monkeys and humans and dose-dependently increased plasma exposures (Cmax, AUC0-48h) with tmax of 
0.5 to 2 h in rodents and up to 6 h in monkeys. Upon multiple dosing, no accumulation in plasma was 
observed, but inotersen rapidly and widely distributed from plasma into tissues as indicated by the 
rather short plasma MRT0-48h values of 2.1 to 4 h in mice, 3.23 to 8.01 h in rats and 4 to 9 h in 
monkeys. High concentrations of inotersen were detected in kidneys, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, 
injection site and bone marrow. 
However, anti-inotersen antibodies (ADAs) developed in some monkeys of the 39 weeks toxicity study, 
which increased the median plasma trough concentrations of inotersen at approximately 3 months or 
beyond from ~2- to 12-fold compared to those monkeys that did not develop antibodies (see 
section 3.2.3 below). Of note, plasma exposure and elimination half-life of inotersen were not altered 
and efficacy or toxicity parameters in chronic toxicity studies remained unaffected. This is attributed to 
the two-compartmental pharmacokinetics of inotersen due to rapid clearance from plasma and 
distribution into tissues and the limited binding capacity of ADAs (picomolar range) relative to plasma 
albumin or tissue proteins. 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 22/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In kidney and liver, inotersen concentrations remained largely comparable after subchronic and chronic 
treatment of mice and monkeys indicating that steady-state levels were achieved within 13 weeks of 
dosing. No differences between genders were confirmed in mice, rats or monkeys. 
Compared to maternal liver concentrations of inotersen in pregnant mice and rabbits, <10 % were 
determined in the placenta and the inotersen levels in the milk of mice were at least >660-fold lower. 
Given this minimal milk transfer and the generally low oral bioavailability of 2’-MOE ASOs, the systemic 
exposure of nursing pups appears negligible. Inotersen was not detectable in foetal livers, which can 
be attributed to its macromolecular size and hydrophilicity that presumably interferes with efficient 
permeation across the placenta. 
Full length inotersen constituted <70 to 92 % of total oligonucleotides in kidneys and liver of mice, rats 
and monkeys compared to <10 % of metabolites of shorter chain length. Inotersen persisted in 
kidneys and liver until the end of the recovery periods of toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys 
suggesting slow tissue clearance. The estimated tissue half-lives of inotersen in kidney and liver 
consistently ranged from 13.5 to 19.3 days in mice and monkeys, whereas long terminal elimination 
half-lives of 17 to 29.7 days were determined in plasma of monkeys. Accordingly, unchanged inotersen 
was the major circulating component in plasma of mice, monkeys and humans accounting for >74 % 
of total oligonucleotides, whereas 13 metabolites of shorter chain length (mainly 3’-deletion 
metabolites) comprised ≤7 %. 
The elimination of inotersen was delayed indicating slow metabolism of the ASO within tissues. 
Approximately 13 % of the s.c. injected radiolabelled dose was determined within 24 h post-dosing in 
the excreta of the mass-balance study in rats. Nevertheless, more than 90% of the originally 
administered radioactivity was recovered in excreta and tissues/carcass in the following 55 days. The 
majority of inotersen was excreted by the renal route (45.2 %). 
Inotersen concentrations up to 100 µM did neither induce, nor interfere with the mRNA level or 
enzymatic activity of various members of the cytochrome P450 family in primary human hepatocytes. 
Inotersen also did not significantly inhibit or serve as a substrate of human drug transporters in 
MDCK-II cells. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In accordance with the current guidance on single-dose toxicity (EMA/CHMP/SWP/81714/2010), no 
specific single-dose/acute toxicity studies were conducted for inotersen. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity of repeated s.c. injections of inotersen was investigated for up to 26 weeks in mice and 
rats and for up to 39 weeks in monkeys using comparable drug substance as tested in the clinical 
program. Minimal safety margins with regard to the proposed therapeutic exposure are derived from 
these repeat-dose toxicity studies. As mismatches in the inotersen sequence preclude effective TTR 
mRNA translational inhibition in rodents and rabbits, mouse- (ISIS 401724) and rat-specific analogues 
(ISIS 594799) were additionally tested to discriminate between toxicities related to TTR inhibition from 
non-specific effects associated with the ASO administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 23/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacodynamic activity of inotersen was confirmed in monkeys by dose-dependent reductions 
of hepatic TTR mRNA (≤70 %) and of TTR and RBP4 protein in plasma (≤61 % and ≤56 %, 
respectively). Similarly, ISIS 401724 reduced TTR mRNA levels by up to 70 % in liver of mice, whereas 
ISIS 594799 reduced hepatic TTR protein levels by up to 34 % in rats. 
Pro-inflammatory effects 
Inotersen dose-dependently accumulated as cytoplasmic basophilic vacuolated granules within 
monocytes/macrophages throughout multiple organs of all animal species, including proximal tubular 
kidney epithelia, hypertrophied Kupffer cells of the liver, histiocytic infiltrates of lymph nodes and 
injection sites. In addition, lymphocyte depletion resulted in reduced thymus weights in mice and rats. 
Moreover, sporadic minimal to moderate mixed cell perivascular infiltration of multiple organs (liver, 
kidney, gallbladder, intestine and reproductive tract) with neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes 
was observed in monkeys. These pro-inflammatory effects in inotersen-treated animals were 
accompanied by decreased albumin levels, decreased albumin/globulin ratio and inter-individually 
variable increases of different inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 
Kidney toxicity 
The kidneys constitute a target organ of toxicity, because inotersen mainly accumulates in this tissue 
and is excreted by the renal route. The kidney changes were more severe in rats than in other species 
and comprised increased glomerular cellularity, minimal to moderate increases in glomerular matrix 
and occasionally adhesion of the glomerular tuft to the Bowman’s capsule (synechia formation). In 
monkeys, renal findings were limited to the 40 mg/kg/week high dose inotersen level of the 13 weeks 
subchronic toxicity study and involved mild multifocal tubular epithelial degeneration/regeneration, 
renal tubular dilatation, erythrocytic tubular casts, fibroconnective tissue proliferation and interstitial 
haemorrhage. In both rats and monkeys, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration and signs of 
proteinuria were additionally apparent. No comparable kidney alterations were noted after subchronic 
or chronic dosing of mice. 
Liver abnormalities 
As inotersen also accumulates in the liver, adverse effects were expected. Mononuclear cell infiltrates 
were detected in the liver of inotersen-treated mice and rats, whereas the increased liver weights of 
rats were associated with sinusoidal dilatation and granular macrophages, bile duct hyperplasia, 
individual hepatocellular necrosis and oval cell hyperplasia. Furthermore, minor elevations of AST and 
ALT in mice (1.9- and 3-fold each) and of ALT in monkeys (<2-fold) were determined. 
Platelet declines and thrombocytopenia 
Inotersen clearly reduced platelet counts in chronic toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys. Of note, 
platelet reductions were not observed after treatment with the mouse- and rat-specific ASO analogues 
ISIS 401724 and ISIS 594799 indicating that the declines were not related to TTR inhibition. 
Platelet decreases were moderate (-36 to -41%) at inotersen doses ≥40 mg/kg/week in mice, while in 
rats, mild reductions were determined at ≥15 mg/kg/week inotersen with compensatory increased 
megakaryopoiesis. In monkeys, platelet counts were reduced after chronic administration in one male 
monkey of the 3 mg/kg/week low dose group, 1 male and 1 female injected with 6 mg/kg/week and in 
1 female of the 10 mg/kg/week group. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <10x103/µl; ~90 % 
platelet decrease from baseline) was evident between 11 and 13 weeks in two male monkeys 
administered 10 and 20 mg/kg/week inotersen, respectively. Platelet counts recovered when the 
dosing of the high dose animal was temporarily suspended, but dropped again to even lower levels 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 24/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
when the treatment was resumed. In view of bruising and petechiae, both monkeys were prematurely 
euthanized. 
These platelet decreases were roughly dose-dependent with increased severity at inotersen dosages 
≥10 mg/kg/week in monkeys, showed inter-individual variability and obviously required time to 
develop, which is consistent with the onset of thrombocytopenia in the clinical program of inotersen 
(see clinical section). No cytotoxicity was noted up to the highest dosages in the bone marrow or other 
haematopoietic centres. A direct influence of inotersen or TTR protein on platelet activation was also 
excluded. Likewise, the complement system is presumably not involved in the platelet decline, since it 
is usually non-specifically activated after ASO administration in monkeys (see below). The Applicant 
further confirmed that anti-inotersen antibodies did not affect the marked platelet decreases, because 
one of the prematurely sacrificed monkeys with severe thrombocytopenia was even negative for anti-
inotersen antibodies, whereas several antibody-positive monkeys had normal platelet counts. 
With respect to the lack of a clear dose-relationship and the considerable inter-individually variable 
platelet counts between monkeys of the same dose group, the Applicant hypothesises that the pro-
inflammatory effects triggered by inotersen could induce the proliferation of pre-existing 
immunoglobulins that cross-react with platelets, hence accelerating platelet clearance. 
For example, the positively charged chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is released during platelet 
activation, forms highly immunogenic complexes with many polyanions like heparin and nucleic acids 
and has been involved in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. However, analysis of a subset of 
monkeys with decreased platelet counts revealed that anti-PF4 IgG antibodies were only elevated in 
two monkeys with platelet reductions from 400x103/µl to either 124x103/µl, or 141x103/µl (monkeys 
of the 6 mg/kg/week group), but were not affected in the two prematurely sacrificed monkeys with 
severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <10x103/µl). Instead, a combination of increased anti-platelet 
IgG and IgM together with anti-PF4 IgM antibodies were elevated in the two prematurely euthanized 
monkeys. Still, the analytic results of another monkey with the same antibody profile and only 
moderate platelet decreases (platelet counts ~230x103/µl) suggests that antibodies against other 
platelet surface epitopes are additionally involved. This is also implicated by comparable antibody 
profiles in patients with thrombocytopenia or low platelet counts in the clinical Phase 2/3 and open-
label extension studies (see clinical section below). Hence, induction of a combination of antibodies 
against several platelet antigens is apparently required to produce the observed individual cases of 
dramatic reductions in platelet counts. 
Haematological alterations 
Inotersen mildly reduced red blood cells in subchronic and chronic toxicity studies in mice, rats and 
monkeys. These signs of anaemia were obviously compensated by increased haematopoiesis in the 
spleen and bone marrow of mice and rats. Comparable effects were noted with the rat-specific 
analogue ISIS 594799. Inotersen was also found to activate the complement system in monkeys. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Inotersen lacked a genotoxic potential in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests and shows 
negligible risk for triplex formation with genomic DNA. No carcinogenic potential was identified in a 
short-term carcinogenicity study in transgenic rasH2 mice. A 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats is 
currently ongoing and results will be submitted post approval.

Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
The reproduction toxicity of inotersen was investigated in a combined fertility and embryonic 
development study as well as in a pre-/postnatal development study in mice. Effects on embryo-foetal 
development were also tested in rabbits. 
Inotersen did not affect fertility, embryonic or pre- and postnatal development in mice and rabbits, 
respectively. This is consistent with the low placental and foetal liver inotersen exposure. The 
decreased foetal weights in rabbits at the inotersen high dose level were attributable to maternal 
toxicity. The mouse-specific ASO analogue ISIS 401724 did not evoke clinical pathology, reproductive 
or embryo-foetal developmental changes despite reductions of TTR mRNA levels in maternal liver by 
~60 %.  
TTR plays an important role as carrier of retinol, which is crucial for normal embryonic development, 
because deficiency as well as excess in retinol may result in teratogenicity. Moreover, TTR is 
synthesised, secreted and taken up by human placenta and influences human receptivity and normal 
pregnancy.  
Local Tolerance  
The local tolerability of the inotersen formulation was evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
accordance with ICH M3(R2) recommendations (EMA/CPMP/ICH/286/1995). Accumulation of 
macrophages containing basophilic granules and mononuclear cell infiltrates were found in all species. 
Chronic inotersen administration induced occasionally minimal to mild subcutaneous fibrosis and/or 
oedema in rats or infrequent minor irritation and/or bruises, scabs, crusts in monkeys. Other findings 
were attributable to the s.c. injection procedure. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity/immunotoxicity 
The development of anti-inotersen antibodies was investigated in the chronic toxicity studies in mice 
and monkeys. Except one mouse of the 3 mg/kg inotersen low dose group and one control, no anti-
inotersen antibodies were detected in mice. In contrast, highly variable titres of anti-inotersen 
antibodies developed across all dose groups in 28.6 to 50 % of monkeys with a median onset of 
185 days. The TTR levels did not return to normal at the end of the recovery period in the 13 weeks 
repeat dose toxicity study, which contrasts the reversibility confirmed in the 39 weeks chronic toxicity 
study. This apparent difference is explained by different dose levels used in these two studies and 
consequent difference in clearance of inotersen from the liver. Although there was a trend towards 
lower liver TTR mRNA levels in the ADA+ animals compared with the ADA- animals after a 6 months 
recovery period, the available nonclinical data do not suggest that immunogenicity would have a 
significant impact on safety or efficacy.  
Inotersen or its mouse-specific analogue ISIS 401724 did not induce immunosuppression or 
immunotoxicity in the influenza host-resistance model at any dose level. 
Impurities 
Mixtures of starting material-derived impurities, or impurities arising from side or incomplete reactions 
during drug substance production were qualified in a 13 week repeated-dose toxicity study in mice.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has provided a Phase I Environmental Risk Assessment in accordance with the pertinent 
guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr.21*) including an assessment for Persistence, 
Bioaccumulation and Toxicity as well as a Calculation of Market Penetration (Fpen) and Predicted 
Environmental Concentration (PEC). The PECSURFACEWATER is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/l. The 
LogKow value was experimentally determined for inotersen sodium using a validated shake-flask 
method. Inotersen sodium is not likely to be highly lipophilic, as demonstrated by the log KOW values of 
-1.57, -1.58, and -1.58 in pH 5, 7, and 9 solutions, respectively. Therefore, it does not meet criteria 
for additional testing and evaluation for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Inotersen was specifically designed to bind to the 3’-UTR of human TTR mRNA, which lacks widespread 
polymorphisms and appears free of point mutations in humans. Therefore, inotersen can be reasonably 
expected to inhibit the expression of wildtype and all presently known mutant variants of the TTR 
Assessment report

gene. The target sequence of inotersen is conserved between monkeys and humans, but contains 
8 mismatches in rodents and 4 mismatches in rabbits. Inotersen is therefore not pharmacologically 
active in these species. This has been previously accepted during scientific advice given by the CHMP 
as rationale for inclusion of non-human primates in the toxicology program. Nevertheless, an early 
analysis of the sequence homology in further animal species would have been desirable to evaluate if 
other non-rodent species could have served to replace the use of monkeys in non-clinical development 
(see European Dir. 2010/63/EU). 
“Proof-of-concept” of the pharmacodynamic activity of inotersen was adequately demonstrated by the 
inhibition of TTR mRNA translation in hepatic cells of humans and monkeys in vitro as well as in 
monkeys and in transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated human TTR variant in vivo. The reduction 
of TTR protein in monkeys was associated with about 60 % lower levels of RBP4 that is normally 
prevented from renal clearance by complexing with TTR. Thus, inotersen treatment is expected to 
reduce the transport of vitamin A. However, no signs of vitamin A deficiency were observed after long-
term administration of inotersen or its mouse- and rat-specific ASO analogues. 
The available nonclinical data indicate that the presence of ADAs does not seem to have a significant 
impact on the TTR mRNA levels and consequently on the safety or efficacy of the product. 
Repeated inotersen dosing did not significantly alter the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, 
thyroxine and triiodothyronine as well as the histology of thyroid-dependent tissues in monkeys after 
12 weeks. This might be ascribed to the minimal transport of total thyroxine by TTR (~15 %). 
The lack of relevant effects of inotersen in safety pharmacology studies of cardiac, respiratory and CNS 
function coincides with published observations of seven other 2’-MOE phosphorothioate ASOs in 
animals (Kim et al., 2014) and the absence of an arrhythmogenic potential reported for 8 ASOs in 
clinical trials (Rabinovich-Guilatt et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2017). The large molecular size of ASOs most 
probably precludes significant inhibition of cardiac ion channels or permeation of the blood-brain-
barrier. 
Inotersen did not suppress the expression of any “off-target” transcripts with contiguous matching of 
≥10 nucleotides in vitro. As non-target mRNAs additionally need to be transcribed in a specific site- 
and time-dependent manner and must be also critical for cellular function, the manifestation of 
potential “off-target” effects appears unlikely. In view of the specific mechanism of action of inotersen, 
the CHMP agrees that secondary pharmacodynamic investigations and pharmacodynamic drug 
interaction studies are not required. However, inotersen potentially decreases platelet counts, which 
may culminate in thrombocytopenia. For this reason, anticoagulant agents or drugs that lower platelet 
levels should be used with caution in hATTR patients after administration of inotersen as reflected in 
section 4.4 of the approved SmPC. 
Consistent with experience gained with other 2’-MOE phosphorothioate ASOs (Yu et al., 2007; Geary, 
2009), subcutaneously administered inotersen was found to be rapidly absorbed with subsequent wide 
distribution from plasma into tissues. Thereafter, slow metabolism of inotersen was noted, which 
involves initial endonucleolytic cleavage between the central 2’-deoxy nucleotides followed by 
exonuclease-mediated degradation of the unprotected termini of the fragments. As metabolites of 
shorter chain length do no longer significantly interact with proteins, they are quickly eliminated, 
primarily via urine. 
The rapid clearance of inotersen from plasma following subcutaneous administration and its 
distribution into tissues, the limited binding capacity of ADAs relative to plasma albumin or tissue 
proteins as well as constant intracellular nuclease-mediated metabolism provide the rationale for 
unchanged plasma pharmacokinetic parameters in 39-week toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys.

In long-term toxicity studies for up to 26 weeks in mice and rats and up to 39 weeks in monkeys, the 
observed toxicities of inotersen have been also described for other phosphorothioate ASOs and were 
predominantly related to its backbone chemistry, its extensive tissue distribution and its enhanced 
stability against enzymatic degradation. These toxicities comprise kidney, liver and red blood cell 
alterations across species as well as perivascular inflammation of multiple organs and complement 
activation in monkeys and, hence, constitute typical class-effects of treatment with phosphorothioate 
ASOs. A contribution of sequence-specific TTR inhibition to these toxicities was reliably excluded by 
testing of mouse- and rat-specific analogues in parallel to inotersen in mice and rats. These findings 
are appropriately addressed through precautions for monitoring of renal and hepatic function  which 
are included in section 4.4 of the approved SmPC. Likewise, and supported by clinical findings anaemia 
is listed as very common adverse event of inotersen therapy in section 4.8 of the approved SmPC. 
The potential for complement system activation appears to predominate in monkeys, because the 
binding of ASOs to complement factor H (CFH) has been demonstrated, which releases the inhibition of 
constitutive activation of the alternative complement pathway (Henry et al., 2014). Monkeys are more 
sensitive than humans to this stimulation because of the ~3-fold higher inhibitory capacity of 2’-MOE 
ASOs to monkey CFH compared to the CFH of other species (Shen et al., 2014). As the inotersen 
exposure was at least 3-fold higher in monkeys than in patients at the recommended therapeutic dose, 
the CHMP considers that the potential for complement system activation in humans is minor. 
The most prominent toxicity of inotersen is the reduction of platelet counts in mice, rats and monkeys 
over time, which was not observed with the mouse- and rat-specific ASO analogues. The platelet 
decreases were apparently mild to moderate in mice and rats, but were pronounced in some of the 
monkeys of the chronic toxicity study.  Therefore, two monkeys had to be prematurely sacrificed, 
because their platelet counts dropped to even lower levels when inotersen administration was resumed 
following temporary treatment interruption. Platelet reductions with sporadic deterioration resulting in 
severe thrombocytopenia were similarly evident among members of a large set of 102 systemically 
administered 2’-MOE ASOs in non-human primates (Henry et al., 2017). In view of the variability of 
the effect across species and even between monkeys of the same dose group, it is assumed that 
inotersen could augment pre-existing immunoglobulins that interact with platelets to increase platelet 
clearance. In fact, the antibody profiles determined in a subset of monkeys with platelet declines 
suggest that inotersen induces various anti-platelet antibodies against several platelet-specific surface 
epitopes and a combination of these antibodies is apparently required to evoke the individual cases of 
severe thrombocytopenia. The clinical findings reinforced the observations that inotersen treatment is 
associated with reductions in platelet count, therefore specific recommendations for dose adjustments 
and platelet monitoring frequency have been included in section 4.2 of the approved SmPC.  
Inotersen revealed no genotoxic potential in an ICH S2(R1) compliant standard battery of test 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/126642/2008), which coincides with other phosphorothioate ASOs (Berman et al., 
2016; EMEA/CHMP/SWP/199726/2004). No risk for triplex formation was identified. Inotersen was also 
not carcinogenic in a short-term study in transgenic rasH2 mice. A 2 year carcinogenicity study in rats 
is currently ongoing and the Applicant proposed to submit the corresponding results by Q3 2018. In 
the absence of any signals observed in short term studies the CHMP found the proposal acceptable. 
The study is reflected as a category 3 study in the RMP and the requirement for the submission of the 
final study report is captured as well. 
Inotersen did not impact on fertility, embryonic or pre- and postnatal development in mice and rabbits. 
However, only one dose level was investigated and dose-related effects, e.g. occurring with nearly 
100 % reduction in TTR mRNA, could have been missed. Therefore, the CHMP considered that 
conducted animal studies do not allow reaching a definitive conclusion on reproductive toxicity of

inotersen. This conclusion is appropriately reflected in the approved SmPC section 4.6. In addition , 
TTR plays an important role in the transport of retinol, which is crucial for normal embryonic 
development. Except one dose group in mice, the pharmacological effects of inotersen were not 
captured in embryo-foetal development studies. As women of child-bearing potential will be receiving 
inotersen, adequate warnings for vitamin A supplementation and measures to prevent pregnancies in 
women of child-bearing potential are implemented in sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC and 
corresponding sections of the PL. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data were considered by the CHMP sufficient to support the application for a 
marketing authorisation of Tegsedi in the treatment of stage 1 or Stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult 
patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR). 
The CHMP furthermore concluded that Tegsedi was not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Analytical methods 
Inotersen quantification in plasma and urine 
The bioanalytical methods employed for quantitation of inotersen levels included hybridization-based 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (hybridization ELISA) methods for plasma and urine. All of the 
quantitative methods used were demonstrated to be specific and selective for detection of parent 20-
mer oligonucleotide (inotersen). The hybridization ELISA method for human plasma used in Studies 
CS2 and CS3 includes a protein digestion procedure to eliminate potential interference of anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) on the quantitation of inotersen. 
The bioanalytical reports for the analytical methods used in each study as well as the method 
validation reports are provided by the Applicant.

 The methods are validated for linearity, intra- and inter-assay accuracy and precision, selectivity, 
specificity, dilution integrity, hook effect and stability. Incurred sample reanalysis were performed for 
plasma samples and the results met the current regulatory recommendations. However, in some cases 
the accuracy and precision exceeded the recommendations given in Guideline on Biochemical 
Validation. Despite not meeting the acceptance criteria for intra-assay accuracy and precision in some 
runs, the criteria were met when all runs were taken into account. This provided the reassurance that 
the overall study results were not affected. Matrix effects on haemolysed and hyperlipidaemic plasma

samples were not evaluated in the validation; nonetheless, hemolysis and lipemia are not expected to 
have an effect on the bioanalytical assay. This would be mainly due to the high specificity of the assay, 
patients with hATTR-PN are unlikely to have hyperlipidaemia and the minimal number of hemolyzed 
samples. It was also adequately justified why interference of co-medications  with the determination of 
inotersen concentrations was not further examined. Due to the late appearance of ADAs, using the 
assay without the ADA migitation step within the Study CS1 is considered acceptable and the 
measured inotersen plasma concentrations can be considered valid. 
Determination of anti-drug antibodies 
A validated ELISA method was used to determine the presence and level of anti-inotersen antibodies in 
human plasma by a 3-tiered approach: (1) screen assay, which identifies initial positive or negative 
samples, (2) confirmation assay, which assesses specificity of the positive screen samples by free drug 
competition, and (3) titration assay, which estimates the level of antibody for the confirmed positive 
samples.  Assessed validation parameters included intra-assay and inter-assay precision, hook effect, 
drug tolerance, matrix selectivity, effect of haemolysis on matrix selectivity, specificity, stability, 
precision of titers, relative assay sensitivity, and established the screening cut point factor and 
confirmatory cut point.  Inter-assay precision of 23.6 % was observed at LPC2 level; however, 
according to the Guideline on Biochemical Validation precision should not exceed 20 %. The slightly 
higher inter-assay precision at the LPC2 level is expected to have minimal impact on the study data 
because it was mainly driven by 2 samples that had higher OD than the remaining samples tested. 
Study samples having higher OD than expected, would be classified as screen positive and further 
evaluated in confirmation assay. This finding is not expected to have any impact on the overall study 
results. 
Hyperlipidaemic plasma samples were not evaluated in method development or validation of the ADA 
assay; nonetheless, hyperlipidaemia is not anticipated for the patient population for the current 
submission (hATTR-PN).. The applicant justified based on the high specificity of the assay and the lack 
of signals in placebo treated patients, why the possible interference of co-medications  on the 
determination of ADAs was not investigated. The Applicant was requested to show long-term stability 
of positive control under the storage conditions (-70 °C). . The applicant provided literature data which 
supported the stability of antibodies at temperatures ≤ 20 °C for 2 years or longer. Stability of the 
study samples has not been evaluated. Since the analytes of interest in both positive controls and 
study samples are mostly IgG, the stability of the positive control is expected to represent the stability 
of study samples. The neutralizing capacity of antibodies present in positive samples has not been 
tested. The applicant highlighted that anti-inotersen antibodies bind to inotersen in circulation and do 
not make it to the intracellular site of activity of inotersen. Therefore it is expected that they have no 
effect on inotersen pharmacological activity. This is further supported by the fact that neither the non-
clinical data, nor the human PD and efficacy data indicate a loss of drug effect with the appearance of 
antibodies.  
Bioanalytical assay for characterisation of inotersen metabolites 
Inotersen metabolites in plasma and urine samples were identified and profiled in an exploratory 
manner using ion-pair HPLC-ES/MS in selected samples collected from Study ISIS 420915-CS1. 
Chromatographic separation of inotersen and its chain-shortened metabolites was followed by on-line 
mass measurements using a single-quadrupole mass spectrometer. 
Determination of diflunisal concentration in human plasma 
Diflunisal concentration in human EDTA K3 plasma was determined using a validated HPLC/MS/MS 
method. Diflunisal was extracted from human EDTA K3 plasma using an automated protein 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 34/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
precipitation procedure. Performance of the analytical method has been adequately demonstrated. The 
data on high and low concentrations of diflunisal demonstrate satisfactory stability of the analyte in 
human plasma for up to 665 days after storage at -20 °C. 
Absorption  
After subcutaneous injection inotersen is rapidly absorbed into the plasma. Peak plasma concentrations 
are typically reached within a few hours within both healthy volunteers and patients and plasma 
exposure increases dose-proportionally within the dose range from 100 mg to 400 mg with less than 
proportional increases in lower doses. In the multiple dose part of study CS1 similar median Cmax, 
Tmax and AUC were observed independent of treatment day. These results were comparable with data 
from hATTR-patients in study CS2, suggesting time-invariant PK. 
Distribution 
After reaching Cmax, plasma inotersen concentrations decline in a multi-phasic manner with an initial 
distribution half-life in hours and a terminal elimination half-life of 2 to 4 weeks in healthy subjects and 
approximately 1 month in patients with hATTR-PN. Plasma concentration decreases more than 90% 
compared to Cmax within 24 hours after subcutaneous injection. In in-vitro plasma protein binding 
studies in plasma from humans and cynomolgus monkeys inotersen showed high plasma protein 
binding of more than 94% independent of plasma concentration. Based on the population PK analysis 
the apparent volume of distribution in patients with hATTR was estimated to be 293 L, which is 
consistent with the drug being extensively distributed to tissue. Based on non-clinical drug-distribution 
studies and similarity of PK between monkeys and humans the main targets of distribution in humans 
are assumed to be kidney and liver. 
Metabolism 
Metabolites of inotersen were found in human plasma and urine and were produced by ubiquitous 
endonucleases and exonucleases and consisted of chain-shortened 6-mer to 12-mer oligonucleotide 
fragments. Intact inotersen is the most abundant detectable oligonucleotide in human plasma and 
comprises more than 74% of all oligonucleotides. Each detectable chain-shortened oligonucleotide 
comprised less than 7% of the total detectable amount. 
Excretion 
Due to being highly bound to plasma protein glomerular filtration of inotersen is minimal. Consistent 
with fast distribution to tissue and low renal excretion less than 1% of the administered dose can be 
found in urine within the first 24 hours. Chain-shortened oligonucleotides collected over 24 hours 
account for 13.5% of the administered dose. This is consistent with urine being the major excretion 
pathway for chain-shortened metabolites of inotersen. 
Elimination 
The elimination of inotersen appears to be a combination of metabolism through endo- and 
exonucleases and excretion of the metabolites through urine. This is the expected route of elimination 
for this chemical class of antisense oligonucleotides.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Inotersen showed dose proportionality within the clinically relevant dose range of 100 mg to 400 mg, 
however AUC and Cmax increased greater than dose proportionally from 50 mg to 100 mg. Consistent 
with this, plasma clearance was independent from dose between 100 mg and 400 mg but by 
comparison 2-fold higher for the 50 mg dose. The half-life of inotersen in healthy volunteers was dose 
independent over the whole investigated dose range. No major differences in AUC and Cmax were 
observed over the treatment duration, which is consistent with no plasma accumulation of inotersen 
and time-invariant pharmacokinetics. 
Special populations 
So far the pharmacokinetics of inotersen in special populations has not been investigated in a 
dedicated study. Due to the small sample size and high variability of data conclusions from the 
population pharmacokinetics remain limited and influences of several factors remain a possibility. 
Clinical significance however appears unlikely and overall the data support a flat dosing regimen 
without adjustments for special populations. 
While age has not been identified as a significant covariate in the population model based on analysis 
between patients of ≤ 65 years of age and ≥ 65 years data about the amount of patients included in 
the age groups ≥ 65 years (65-75years, 75-85 years, above 85 years) was presented during the 
evaluation procedure (see Table 3). PK parameters of inotersen in three different age subgroups have 
been also presented. No major difference was observed in PK parameters of inotersen between the age 
groups although clearance was slightly lower and AUC higher in patients over 75 years of age.

Population PK analysis and intra- and inter-individual variability 
Population  PK  analysis  was  performed  to  characterize  the  PK  of  inotersen  in  healthy  subjects  and  in 
patients with hATTR. Pooled plasma concentration time data and other demographic data from studies 
CS1, CS2,  and CS3 were  used to identify the intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with the inter-
individual variability in the PK of inotersen. 
Overall the developed population PK-model seems to adequately describe the observed data. The 
influence of several covariates on the PK parameters however could not be definitely assessed due to 
high variability and limited amount of data.  
Data collected after the onset of immunogenicity were excluded from the population PK analysis. 452 
records,  or  12.5%  of  the  plasma  concentrations,  which  occurred  after  the  formation  of  anti-drug 
antibodies  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  The  antibodies  have  no  effect  on  inotersen 
pharmacological activity but trough concentrations of inotersen were elevated. Leaving these elevated 
trough/ADA  samples  and  immunogenicity  out  of  the  final  model  has  been  justified.  The  lack  of 
incorporation of Cl/F from the peripheral compartment has also been adequately explained.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The effect of disease status on PK seems to be negligible. While the bulk of pharmacokinetic data were 
created in healthy volunteers they seem to also adequately describe PK in patients. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The potential of inotersen for cytochrome P450 inhibition and induction as well as the potential to act 
as a substrate or inhibitor of major human drug transporters were investigated in in-vitro studies. The 
results  showed  the  lack  of  potential  for  inotersen  to  inhibit  CYP1A2,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 as well as the lack of potential for inotersen to induce CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Inotersen is also not a substrate or inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
BSEP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3. These are the expected results for the chemical class of antisense 
oligonucleotides.  Consequently  no  clinical  drug-drug-interaction  studies  were  performed  and  the  in-
vitro  studies  are  considered  sufficient  evidence  that  no  interactions  are  to  be  expected  at  clinically 
relevant concentrations. 
Commonly  used  concomitant  medications  in  studies  CS2  and  CS3  included  diuretics  (30.5%), 
antithrombotic (36.4%), and non-NSAID analgesics (83.4%) in patients with hATTR-PN. As requested 
the  Applicant  has  provided  lists  of  specific  diuretics,  antithrombotics  and  non-NSAID  analgesics  and 
their frequencies taken during the studies. Several different agents have been taken during the studies 
but the amount of patients taking these different agents was  small (<5 patients).  
Additionally  transthyretin  and  cytochrome  P450s  share  common  transcriptional  regulatory  pathways 
(such  as  Hepatic  nuclear  factors).  Transthyretin  (TTR)  is  a  liver  produced  plasma  protein,  which 
functions as a carrier protein for thyroxine and vitamin A. There is no evidence that TTR regulates the 
expression of genes at the transcriptional level. Although TTR and cytochrome P450s are regulated by 
common  transcriptional  regulatory  pathways  such  as  the  hepatic  nuclear  factors  (HNFs),  TTR  itself 
does not have any reported role in regulating the expression of HNFs or cytochrome P450s (Buxbaum 
2009;  Lau  2017).  Therefore,  it  is  not  expected  that  changes  in  TTR  levels  after  administration  of 
inotersen would impact CYP levels or any co-medications that are metabolically influenced by P450s. 
Effects of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) on PK 
In  study  CS2  34  out  of  112  patients  (30.4%)  developed  anti-drug  antibodies  following  chronic 
treatment with inotersen. Inotersen concentration-time profiles were similar between ADA-positive and 
ADA-negative  subjects  on  all  examined  days  showing  minimal  effect  on  Cmax  and  AUC.  Beginning  at 
later  time  points  plasma  Ctrough  levels  were  substantially  higher  for  ADA-positive  subjects.  Similar 
observations  were  made  in  study  CS3  for  subjects  that  developed  ADAs  after  switching  to  inotersen 
from placebo. ADAs were not associated with loss of efficacy and did not have any major effects on the 
clinical safety of inotersen.  
Although  the  presence  of  ADA  does  prevent  an  accurate  estimation  of  drug  accumulation  over  time, 
TTR  level  (PD)  over  time  can  indirectly  reflect  drug  accumulation  in  the  hepatocytes.  Similar  TTR 
reduction between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects suggested inotersen accumulation was not 
affected by the presence  of ADA.    According to clinical studies no major differences in Cmax, AUC0-
24,  Clss//F  were  noticed  between  ADA  positive  and  ADA  negative  patients  at  week  1,  week  35  and 
week 65 in a subgroup in study  CS2 but the  amount  of subjects was small in both groups (n=4  and 
n=6,  respectively).  However,  plasma  trough  and  post-treatment  inotersen  concentrations  and  ADA

data, as well as TTR levels, are being monitored in the open label-extension study CS3, with planned 
treatment up to 5 years, and the results will be reported once available. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The Applicant has conducted three clinical studies and investigated the pharmacodynamics of inotersen 
primarily in the first-in-human study ISIS 420915-CS1 with additional, supportive data generated in 
the Phase 2/3 study, ISIS 420915-CS2, and the open-label extension (OLE) study for patients rolled 
over from study CS2, ISIS 420915-CS3. 
The primary pharmacodynamic biomarker has been the change of TTR protein in plasma compared to 
baseline, with RBP4 and retinol levels acting as additional markers. Reduction of TTR protein is 
considered the relevant effect of inotersen to produce clinical benefit for patients. Reduction of 
mutated TTR can also be achieved by orthotopic liver transplantation; however, wild-type TTR protein 
continues to be produced by the donor liver and can deposit in the pre-existing amyloid deposits in the 
tissues after transplantation. Total reduction of both, mutated and wild-type TTR protein, represents a 
novel therapeutic approach for treatment of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR). It is 
however not known what levels of TTR reduction are required to generate a clinical benefit for patients. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
In study ISIS 420915-CS1 a clear dose and time dependent pharmacodynamic effect was established. 
Levels of TTR, RBP4 and retinol all decreased in a similar fashion in the multiple dose cohorts as 
predicted by the non-clinical studies. No steady-state for inotersen tissue concentration was achieved.  
During the four week treatment duration TTR suppression levels in the 300 mg and 400 mg cohorts 
were very similar. Since only a minimal additional clinical benefit could be assumed for the 400 mg 
dose compared with the 300 mg dose, while at the same time the incidence rate for adverse events 
might increase, the sponsor chose the 300 mg dose for the further clinical development program in 
patients. 
Plasma concentrations of TTR, RBP4 and retinol were slowly rising after the final dose; however they 
still remained significantly reduced at the end of the observation period (study day 92). This prolonged 
pharmacodynamic effect is best explained by slow elimination of inotersen from the tissue and 
congruent with the long elimination half-life of 2 to 4 weeks in healthy volunteers. 
In study ISIS 430915-CS2 patients with hATTR were treated with 300 mg of inotersen weekly for 65 
weeks. TTR levels decreased until week 13 and then remained at a constant level of suppression of 
about 70% compared to baseline with more than 80% of patients reaching a TTR suppression of more 
than 60% by that time. A similar time dependent effect was found for RBP4. Maximum levels of TTR 
suppression seem to be reached at about the time inotersen concentrations in the liver reach steady 
state. The 13 week mark seems to be in line with the long elimination half-life. 
Further supportive data was generated in study ISIS 430915-CS3, the open-label extension to study 
CS2. Patients either continued treatment at the same dosing schedule they had in study CS2 or were 
switched to 300 mg inotersen weekly from placebo. In the inotersen-inotersen group, TTR suppression 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 38/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
levels remained comparable over the whole duration of the extension study, showing that the 
pharmacodynamic effect can be maintained over extended periods of time. 
Patients in the placebo-inotersen group reached TTR suppression levels of over 70% by week 13. This 
is of note because it shows that similar pharmacodynamics effects can be achieved with and without 
the loading doses during week one of treatment. From a pharmacodynamic point of view, a once 
weekly treatment regimen without additional administrations of inotersen on days 3 and 5 of week 1 is 
therefore supported. 
Overall, the pharmacodynamic endpoints investigated throughout the clinical development programme 
are consistent with the non-clinical data and show a pronounced and sustainable reduction of TTR 
protein over a treatment period of up to 3 years. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No studies were conducted to specifically assess secondary pharmacology. Inotersen is expected to be 
highly specific for transthyretin mRNA. No unexpected off-target effects were observed in the 
nonclinical toxicity studies. The adverse events in healthy volunteers and patients do not appear to be 
related to specific pharmacodynamic effects. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Inotersen acts in a highly specific way by first binding to and subsequently degrading transthyretin 
mRNA which then leads to decreasing TTR levels. No other gene products should be affected. There are 
also no approved drugs that are known to have a TTR lowering effect. Therefore any 
pharmacodynamics interaction between inotersen and co-administered drugs appears unlikely. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
More than 130 known mutations for TTR are described in the scientific literature. Inotersen was 
designed to avoid hybridization to any known TTR mutation site. Therefore both mutated and wild-type 
TTR mRNA should be affected in the same manner and mutated TTR should be reduced independent of 
the specific mutation. 
In study ISIS 420915-CS2 patients were stratified by their mutation status (V30M TTR mutation vs 
non-V30M TTR mutation). TTR and RBP4 showed similar suppression levels compared to baseline for 
subjects with V30M and non-V30M mutations. Based on the mechanism of action no difference was 
expected. These results are also supported by the overall efficacy data. 
Dose-response relationship 
Study ISIS 420915-CS1 investigated the exposure-response relationship of multiple doses on inotersen 
and levels of TTR, RBP4 and retinol. A sigmoid inhibitory exposure-response relationship was observed 
with the higher dose levels (300 mg and 400 mg) reaching plasma trough concentrations in the flat 
part of the curve. It also has to be noted that, due to the long elimination half-life of inotersen (2 to 4 
weeks in healthy volunteers) tissue steady state levels were not reached during the observation 
period. In studies ISIS 420915-CS2 and ISIS 420915-CS3 highest levels of TTR suppression were 
reached by week 13 and remained stable during continued treatment. 
Study ISIS 420915-CS2 compared individual trough plasma levels of inotersen given at a dose of 
300 mg once weekly with TTR levels on days 85 and 449. A flat exposure-response relationship was 
found on both days with consistent levels of about 70% reduction found over the entire exposure 
range. The data show that a single dose of 300 mg inotersen given once weekly achieves similar 
pharmacodynamic effects in patients with hATTR independent of body weight.

Effect of anti-drug antibodies 
A significant proportion of subjects under long-term treatment showed development of late onset 
(median onset of 202.5 days in CS2 and 327 days in CS3) anti-inotersen antibodies, with 30.4% in 
CS2 and 39.5% in CS3 being positive post baseline. Inotersen plasma trough concentrations were 
generally higher in ADA-positive subject. Study ISIS 420915- CS2 however showed similar levels of 
TTR suppression for ADA-positive and negative subjects. It can therefore be assumed that anti-
inotersen antibodies are drug binding antibodies, but not neutralizing antibodies, since 
pharmacodynamics responses were not affected. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The results from the three clinical studies conducted with inotersen allow for an adequate assessment 
of its pharmacokinetic characteristics. Adsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion are well 
described and conform to expectations for the chemical class of antisense oligonucleotides. The 
pharmacokinetic properties are adequately described in the SmPC. Inotersen showed dose proportional 
and time invariant PK. 
The analytical methods have overall been well described and all points for clarification have been 
adequately addressed by the Applicant. 
The pharmacokinetic data is, to certain extent, limited because  only few non-white patients were 
recruited in the studies. It should also be noted that the pharmacokinetic subgroup in study ISIS 
420915-CS2 did not include any female patients. Due to the small sample size and a high variability of 
data the influence of several covariates on PK could therefore not be definitely ascertained. The CHMP 
found to be sufficient the provided justification for excluding data from ADA-positive patients from the 
population PK model. 
Since the pharmacokinetics of inotersen has not been investigated in a dedicated study in special 
populations influences of several factors remain a possibility. Data in patients over 65 years has not 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 40/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
been analysed for potential effects of different age ranges. Clinical significant influences in special 
populations however appear unlikely and the limits of the population PK-model do not preclude a flat 
dosing in all patients. Therefore the CHMP considers that no special dosing recommendations in elderly 
are required. The limitations of the PK-model are adequately reflected in the SmPC section 5.2. 
In vitro studies with inotersen showed a general lack of interaction potential with cytochromes and 
major drug transporters. These results are expected for antisense oligonucleotides since the metabolic 
pathways for small molecules and ASOs are generally different and non-overlapping. The lack of 
human DDI-studies is therefore justified. A more detailed discussion of concomitant medications used 
in the clinical studies was provided during the evaluation procedure. No definite conclusions on the lack 
of interactions between inotersen and the other agents can be drawn based on the conducted clinical 
studies as the data is sparse. Possible effects of inotersen on CYP levels not by direct interaction but 
through common transcriptional regulatory pathways shared by transthyretin and cytochrome P450s 
can most likely be ruled out, since there is no evidence that TTR regulates the expression of genes at 
the transcriptional level. 
The pharmacodynamic effects of inotersen have also been well characterised. The proposed 
mechanism of action is plausible based on the mechanism of action of ASOs which well established and 
highly specific. Therefore no pharmacodynamic interactions are to be expected. Non-clinical data 
corroborates the primary pharmacodynamics.  
Inotersen showed the predicted time and dose dependent suppression of TTR, RBP4 and retinol with all 
biomarkers responding in a similar pattern. Suppression followed a sigmoid dose-response curve. 
Individual trough plasma concentrations at the dose of 300 mg SC once weekly vary greatly but are 
generally in the flat part of the exposure-response curve. Therefore, at the clinically relevant dose of 
300 mg a flat concentration-response curve has been established. 
It has to be noted that doses of inotersen lower than 300 mg SC weekly have not been clinically 
investigated and therefore the clinical significance of lower suppression levels of TTR cannot be 
evaluated.  
Inotersen was designed to bind to a part of TTR mRNA without any known mutations. Therefore, 
efficacy of inotersen is expected to be independent of mutation status. This is further supported by TTR 
and RBP4 suppression levels which showed similar values compared to baseline for subjects with V30M 
and non-V30M mutations. 
A significant portion of patients developed anti-inotersen antibodies. While Cmax and AUC appeared 
unaffected Ctrough levels showed significant increases in ADA-positive patients. Pharmacodynamic 
effects however were not significantly affected by the presence of antibodies. Therefore, anti-inotersen 
antibodies appear to be drug binding but not drug neutralising.  In the absence of pharmacodynamic or 
efficacy signals pointing towards a neutralising effect the CHMP considered acceptable that the 
neutralizing capacity of antibodies present in positive samples was not tested. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inotersen have been thoroughly investigated 
and well described. The results generally reflect the expected behaviour of a substance belonging to 
the chemical class of antisense oligonucleotides. The analytical methods have overall been well 
described. The influence of certain factors, including ADAs, on drug exposure cannot be definitely 
ascertained based on the presented population PK-model results. However possible influences appear 
to be minor and are considered by the CHMP as clinically not significant.

Inotersen has shown predictable and consistent pharmacodynamic effects (reduction of TTR, RBP4 and 
retinol) over treatment durations up to three years. Since the magnitude of TTR reduction required to 
optimally attenuate progression of disease is not known a possible clinical benefit of lower doses of 
inotersen remains unexplored. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development of inotersen consists of a Phase 1 first-in-human study in healthy volunteers 
(ISIS 420915-CS1; herein referred to as CS1), a Phase 2/3 pivotal study in patients with hATTR (CS2), 
and a Phase 3 Open Label Extension (OLE) study (CS3). CS1 provided pharmacodynamic (PD) 
evidence and a dose-response relationship for the actions of inotersen. The pivotal double-blind Phase 
2/3 study recruited Stage 1 and Stage 2 subjects with hATTR-PN with a Neuropathy Impairment Score 
(NIS) ≥10 and ≤130. This study investigated the change from baseline in Modified Neuropathy 
Impairment Score + 7 (mNIS+7) composite score and in the Norfolk Quality of Life - Diabetic 
Neuropathy (QoL-DN) questionnaire total score at week 65/66. The Supportive study CS3 is an open 
label extension for an additional 260 weeks (5 years), which recruited patients who had satisfactorily 
completed CS2. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
CS1 was a Phase 1, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study conducted at a single 
center. The study consisted of 4 single-dose (randomized to 3 active:1 placebo) and 5 multiple-dose 
(randomized to 8 active:2 placebo) treatment cohorts. Subjects in the single-dose treatment cohorts 
received a single SC dose of study drug on Day 1: Cohort A (50 mg), Cohort B (100 mg), Cohort C 
(200 mg), and Cohort D (400 mg). Subjects in the multiple-dose treatment cohorts received 3 SC 
doses of study drug on alternate days (Days 1, 3, and 5) during Week 1 followed by once weekly SC 
administration during Weeks 2 to 4 (Days 8, 15, and 22) for a total of 6 doses: Cohort AA (50 mg), 
Cohort BB (100 mg), Cohort CC (200 mg), Cohort DD (400 mg), and Cohort EE (300 mg). 
A maximum of 86 subjects were planned; 65 subjects were randomized and analyzed: 16 subjects in 
the single-dose treatment cohorts and 49 subjects in the multiple-dose treatment cohorts. 
In CS1, dose- and concentration-dependent reductions in TTR levels were observed after both single 
and multiple doses, based on evaluations in the 50 to 400 mg dose range. The exposure-response 
relationship between plasma trough concentrations and serum TTR was nonlinear and was best 
described with an inhibitory sigmoid Imax model. Based on modelling and simulation of the Phase 1 
data, a clinical dose of 300 mg per week was selected as the Phase 3 dose to achieve TTR reduction of 
≥ 70% in majority of patients (66%) and over 50% TTR reduction in approximately 90% of patients. 
In CS1, the 300 mg dose level showed a satisfactory safety profile and substantial PD effects after 6 
doses (>70% mean reduction in plasma TTR levels). The PD effect observed with the 300 mg dose 
level was also similar to that observed with the 400 mg dose level, and therefore the 300 mg per week 
dose (with additional loading doses in the first week) was selected for the Phase 2/3 study. Preliminary 
PK/PD modelling, based on data from CS1 and extrapolation to steady-state, predicted mean total TTR 
(wild-type and mutant) steady-state reductions of ~80% with either a 300 mg/week or 400 mg/week 
regimen.

Study Design and Treatment Schema. 
a)  Exceptions to the 6-week period to perform Screening evaluations and Baseline assessments were allowed 
for the TTR genotyping and amyloid biopsy tests. These tests were allowed up to 10 weeks prior to Study 
Day 1 and were only conducted if appropriate documentation was not already available. In addition, ERG 
and  ophthalmology  examinations  were  allowed  up  to  1  week  after  Study Day 1,  if  needed for  scheduling 
purposes. 
b)  Subjects  who  terminated  treatment  early  were  to  complete  the  early  termination  visit  and  EOT  efficacy 
assessments  within  14  days  from  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  These  subjects  then  entered  the  post-
treatment evaluation period.

In addition, a small number of subjects (approximately 20) at selected sites were to be enrolled in a PK 
subgroup to undergo additional sampling for PK, electrocardiogram (ECG), complement, coagulation, 
inflammatory, and haematology assessments. Subjects who met additional ECHO inclusion criteria also 
had the option to participate in an ECHO subgroup to receive additional transthoracic ECHO 
assessments during the Treatment Period.

Global longitudinal strain (GLS) by echocardiogram (ECHO) in the ECHO subgroup and in the 
Cardiomyopathy-ECHO (CM-ECHO) Set 
•  Additional secondary objectives 
To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of inotersen as compared with placebo based on 
the change from Baseline in TTR and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4).  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of inotersen 
To evaluate the plasma trough levels of inotersen in all subjects and to evaluate the plasma 
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of inotersen in a subset of subjects 
 
Tertiary objectives 
Tertiary objectives of the study were to evaluate the change from Baseline as compared with placebo 
in the following measures: 
Short form 36 health survey (SF-36) questionnaire 
Individual components of NIS, modified +7, and +7 
+7 
Individual domain scores of the Norfolk QoL-DN questionnaire 
 
Exploratory objectives 
Exploratory objectives of the study were to evaluate the change from Baseline as compared with 
placebo, in the following exploratory measures: 
ECHO parameters (except GLS) in the ECHO subgroup and in the CM-ECHO Set 
Plasma N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) 
Polyneuropathy disability (PND) score

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints were the change from Baseline to Week 66 in the Modified Neuropathy 
Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) composite score and in the Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic 
Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) questionnaire total score. The mNIS+7 consists of two composite scores: 
the NIS composite score (maximum of 244 points) and the modified +7 composite score (maximum of 
Assessment report

102.32 points) and has a maximum of 346.32 points. The mNIS+7 assessment procedure included an 
evaluation of each component, as well as additional components needed for the NIS+7 total score. 
Sample size 
The planned sample size for CS2 was revised (Protocol Amendment 7, dated 16-Nov-2015) from 195 
subjects to 135 subjects based on published results from the placebo-controlled Phase 3 diflunisal trial 
and a retrospective, multi-national natural history study in 283 patients with hATTR-PN [Berk, 2013; 
Adams, 2015a], as well as uncontrolled data for another TTR mRNA targeted therapeutic 
oligonucleotide [Adams, 2015b] 
The study was designed with 135 patients to detect a 9.6-point difference in the mean change from 
Baseline in mNIS+7 score between the 2 groups and a 10.7-point difference in the change from 
Baseline in the Norfolk QoL total score between the 2 groups. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized after all Screening and Baseline assessments were completed and after the 
investigator verified that subjects were eligible per the study entry criteria. No subject began 
treatment prior to randomization and assignment of a unique subject identification number. 
Using an Interactive Voice/Web-Response System (IXRS), eligible subjects were randomized 2:1 to 
receive inotersen or placebo, respectively. There were 2 separate and independent randomizations: 
one for subjects in the PK subgroup and one for remaining subjects who were not in the PK subgroup. 
Within each randomization, subjects were stratified for: 
Previous treatment with tafamidis or diflunisal vs no known previous treatment 
Stage 1 vs Stage 2 disease 
V30M TTR mutation vs non-V30M TTR mutation 
Blinding (masking) 
Sponsor personnel or their designees who were involved in the conduct of the study, monitors, study 
center personnel, and subjects were blinded throughout the study until all subjects completed the 
treatment period and the EOT efficacy assessments and the database was locked. In addition, the 
Sponsor, clinical research organization (CRO) personnel involved in the regular conduct of the study, 
investigators, study center personnel, and the subjects did not have access to any post-Baseline PK or 
PD data (e.g. TTR, RBP4) that may have resulted in unblinding of treatment assignments. 
If a subject experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) and/or if knowledge of the treatment 
assignment would have impacted the clinical management of the subject, the investigator only had the 
ability to unblind the treatment assignment for that subject using the IXRS. Every reasonable attempt 
was to be made in order to complete the EOT efficacy assessment or early termination visit procedures 
prior to subject unblinding, as knowledge of the treatment arm had the potential to influence 
assessment of the subject.

Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analyses were the comparison of change from Baseline to Week 66 in modified 
Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) Composite Score and in the Norfolk Quality of Life 
Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) questionnaire total score between the inotersen 300 mg group 
and the placebo group. To account for multiplicity between both endpoints a sequential testing 
approach was pre-defined and mNIS+7 was to be tested first and the QoL endpoint second. 
Both endpoints were analysed using a Mixed Effects Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) based on 
the Full Analysis Set (FAS) that included all enrolled subjects according to randomized allocation who 
received at least 1 injection of inotersen and who have a baseline and at least 1 post-Baseline efficacy 
assessment for mNIS+7 or Norfolk QoL questionnaire. The MMRM method included fixed factors for 
treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, and the 3 stratification factors. Covariates for baseline 
and baseline-by-time interaction were also included and an unstructured covariance matrix was used 
for repeated measures. 
Results 
Recruitment 
Two hundred seventy-eight subjects were screened for entry into the study. A total of 173 subjects 
were randomized into the study and 172 subjects received study treatment. One subject in the 
inotersen group was randomized in error and did not initiate study drug. 
Conduct of the study 
Most randomized subjects (80.3%) completed study treatment according to the protocol. The 
proportion of subjects who discontinued study treatment early was higher in the inotersen group 
(23.0%) compared with the placebo group (13.3%) due primarily to AEs. In the inotersen group, over 
one-third of the AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment were associated with 
thrombocytopenia (4 inotersen subjects) or glomerulonephritis (2 inotersen subjects), which are 
known to be associated with inotersen treatment. 
The majority of subjects who completed treatment (133 of 139 subjects) entered the CS3 OLE study at 
the end of the treatment period. Subjects who did not continue into the OLE study, either because they 
elected not to after completion of treatment in CS2 or because they discontinued CS2 treatment early, 
were followed for safety and efficacy in the 6-month post-treatment evaluation period. At the time of 
data cut-off for the submitted CSR (28 March 2017), a total of 3 subjects were still ongoing in post-
treatment follow-up. 
There were no subjects unblinded for safety reasons by the investigator during the study. 
The majority of subjects had at least 1 protocol deviation during the study (Table 11). The most 
frequently reported major protocol deviations involved study procedures that were not performed 
according to the protocol or study drug errors (primarily missed doses). The incidence of major 
protocol deviations was similar between treatment groups.

Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups (Table 7). 
Subjects were predominantly White (91.9%) and 68.6% of the subjects were male. The mean age of 
subjects was 59.2 years. The majority of subjects were enrolled at sites in North America (47.7%) and 
Europe (34.9%), with the remainder (17.4%) enrolled in South America/Australasia. 
Regional enrolment was well balanced between the treatment groups. 
Based on data entered in the electronic case report form, approximately two-thirds of treated subjects 
(67.4%) had Stage 1 hATTR-PN at Baseline and 32.6% of subjects were Stage 2. V30M TTR mutations 
were observed in 51.7% of subjects, and 57.6% of subjects received prior treatment with tafamidis or 
diflunisal. In the CM-ECHO Set, subjects were older (mean age: 62.7 years vs 59.2 years), a higher 
proportion were from North America (North America 58.3% vs 47.7%, South America 10.2% vs 
17.4%) and a lower proportion had V30M TTR mutations (41.7% vs 52.3%) compared with the SS. 
A total of 27 different TTR mutations were observed in treated subjects. The most common TTR 
mutation was V30M, and the incidence was similar between treatment groups (50.0% inotersen, 
55.0% placebo).

Note: Randomization strata were determined by IXRS and CRF data. Per the SAP, if the randomization strata recorded 
from IXRS was different from the actual data recorded in the CRF, the randomization strata recorded from IXRS was 
used in the analysis of efficacy. 
Due to the randomisation scheme 2:1 more patients were recruited in the inotersen group in CS2 
study. The percentages of the demographic characteristics for each subgroup were similar in the 
placebo and in the inotersen group. A slightly higher percentage of patients with Stage 2 disease 
(Stage 2 to Stage 1 ratio 34/66) were included in the inotersen group compared to the placebo (Stage 
2 to Stage 1 ratio 30/70).

Baseline hATTR-PN disease characteristics were consistent with study entry criteria and the disease 
severity of enrolled subjects. The mean duration of hATTR-PN disease from the time of symptom onset 
was 63.9 months. Approximately 40% of subjects had a concomitant diagnosis of hATTR-CM at study 
entry, with a mean duration of disease from the time of symptom onset of 41.1 months. Baseline 
mNIS+7 composite scores and Norfolk QoL-DN total scores ranged from 11.2 to 174.7 and from -2.0 
to 127.0, respectively. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 172 of the 173 randomized subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included 
in the SS (, which was the population used for the analyses of all safety measures. The majority of 
randomized subjects were included in the FAS (95.4%), which was the primary population for analysis 
of efficacy and PD outcomes. The proportion of subjects in the inotersen group (93.8%) included in the 
FAS was slightly lower than the placebo group (98.3%). 
A lower proportion of subjects in the inotersen group were included in the PPS compared with the 
placebo group (Table 8). The primary reason that excluded subjects from the PPS in both treatment 
groups was <80% of prescribed doses of study drug received. 
A total of 66 subjects (38.2%) participated in the ECHO substudy, and the proportion of subjects 
included in the ECHO subgroup was similar between treatment groups. Approximately 62% of subjects 
either had a diagnosis of hATTR-CM at study entry or were eligible to participate in the ECHO substudy 
(whether consented or not) and comprised the CM-ECHO Set. A higher proportion of subjects in the 
inotersen group (66.4%) were included in the CM-ECHO Set compared with the placebo group 
(55.0%). 
A total of 10 subjects in the inotersen group (8.8%) were included in the PK subgroup, which was used 
for all PK analyses.

Outcomes and estimation 
Results of primary analysis 
The primary endpoints demonstrated statistically significant differences from baseline to week 66. The 
differences were large with -19.73 (95% CI: -26.43, -13.03; p=0.00000004) for the mNIS+7 Score 
(maximum score 346) and -11.68 (95% CI: -18.29, -5.06; p<0.0006) for the Norfolk QoL-DN 
(maximum score 156) using the pre-specified MMRM analysis (Figures 4 and 5 below). It is noted that 
for mNIS+7 the difference at week 35 showed statistically significant results with a difference of -8.69 
(95% CI: -13.49, -3.90; p=0.0005).  For Norfolk QoL-DN the difference of -6.14 (95% CI: -11.77, -
0.52; p=0.032) was statistically significant at week 35 (MMRM analysis).  However, these evaluations 
were based on the pre-specified MMRM analysis that is not considered of primary importance (see 
section on statistical methods above).

In order to clarify whether any sites could have had a major influence on the results, an analysis was 
performed by the CHMP with the primary efficacy results pooled from all sites, all European sites 
except Site 1817, all USA sites except Site 1823, and all South American/New Zealand sites except 
Site 1863 and presented by the Applicant in a Table. From this analysis the centres that recruited more 
patients (1817 in Europe and 1823 in USA) did not dominate the results and no specific trends in 
individual sites or in regions could be detected. There were not one or two sites that played a major 
role in the differences in the means for the endpoints favouring inotersen versus placebo and defining 
the outcome of the study, as it can be seen from the graphs below.

It is also noted that a number of predefined sensitivity analyses have been performed and these were 
confirmatory of the results obtained with the primary analysis of the primary endpoints (please see 
below), including sensitivity analysis 6, which is considered of highest relevance (see discussion on 
statistics below) and results show, that also this analysis yielded significant results for both primary 
endpoint at week 66 with point estimates of -14.89 (95% CI: -22.55; -7.22, p<0.001) and -8.56 (95% 
CI: 15.42; -1.71, p=0.015) for mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL questionnaire, respectively. Considering 
sensitivity analysis 6, the results for week 35 are -7.57 (95% CI: -12.3 to 2.284; p-value=0.002) and  
-4.69 (95% CI: -10.56 to 1.18; p-value=0.116) for mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL questionnaire, 
respectively.  
Sensitivity analyses 
Results for all 13 sensitivity analyses of the change from Baseline in the mNIS+7 composite score 
conducted in CS2 were consistent with the primary analysis (Table 9). Statistical significance was 
maintained at Week 35 and Week 66 for all pre-specified sensitivity analyses, including all missing data 
sensitivity analyses.

A sufficient number of predefined sensitivity analyses have been performed supporting the primary 
efficacy results, which were analysed using MMRM. As mentioned above, this MMRM analysis is not 
supported. Instead sensitivity analysis 6 is considered of highest relevance and should be considered 
as primary instead of the MMRM analysis. 
Of note, the amount of missing assessment level data was small (i.e. <4% of subjects in each 
treatment group had a missing sub-component at any visit), with the exception of the heart rate to 
deep breathing (HRDB) component. HRDB cannot be assessed in subjects with active pacing or with

atrial fibrillation, both of which were common in the study. Therefore, Sensitivity Analysis 12 was 
included to examine the change in mNIS+7 excluding HRDB data from analysis. Statistical significance 
was maintained in this analysis of change from Baseline in mNIS+7 composite score without this 
component score included. 
The LSM changes from Baseline in mNIS+7 composite score using the PPS were similar to the primary 
analysis using the FAS. The difference in LSMs between treatment groups in the PPS was -7.54 (95% 
CI: -12.38, -2.70; p=0.003) and -18.80 (95% CI: -25.66, -11.94; p<0.001) at Week 35 and Week 66, 
respectively. 
A responder analysis was conducted in CS2 to examine the difference in response between the 
2 treatment groups over a range of thresholds (0 to 30 points). A responder was defined as a subject 
who was in the FAS set and who had a change from Baseline that was less than or equal to the 
threshold value. Subjects in the FAS who discontinued from the study prematurely or had missing data 
were considered non-responders. 
In the CS2 responder analysis (sensitivity analysis 10), the response rate in the inotersen group was 
consistently higher than in the placebo group over all thresholds evaluated (0- to 30-point increase), 
with an approximate 2-fold difference observed between the inotersen and placebo groups at each 
threshold. Statistical significance in favour of inotersen treatment was demonstrated at all thresholds 
beyond a 0-point change (i.e., 2-point change). Using the smallest statistically significant threshold, a

Sensitivity analysis 6 is considered as the analysis of highest importance (instead of the MMRM which 
uses a hypothetical strategy to address the effect had no patient discontinued treatment), since this 
analysis accounts for the unfavourable effect of treatment discontinuation, does not exclude patients 
from analysis and uses a reasonable assumption for missing data handling in lack of data collected 
after treatment discontinuation needed to reliably address treatment policy strategy. A responder 
analysis based on the safety set instead of the FAS would have been preferred, but counting the 
patients not included in the FAS as non-responders is not expected to relevantly change results and 
conclusions.

Note: mBMI was also designated as secondary endpoint but is not shown here. Interpretation of mBMI results were 
confounded by observed changes in albumin levels that differed slightly between groups. NIS+7, +7, and individual 
components of +7 were also designated as secondary or tertiary endpoints but are not shown here.  NIS+7, +7 and the 
nerve conduction component of +7 were statistically significant at Week 66.  The vibration of the big toe component of +7 
was not statistically significant. These endpoints were included in the study for completeness as they were used in previous 
hATTR-PN studies.

The analysis of change from Baseline in NIS composite score in CS2 showed a statistically significant 
difference in favour of inotersen treatment at Week 35 and Week 66 (-13.25, p<0.001), consistent 
with the mNIS+7 primary endpoint results . Statistical significance was also observed for the PPS . The 
analysis of change from Baseline in NIS+7 composite score showed a statistically significant difference 
in favour of inotersen treatment compared with placebo at CS2 Week 35 and Week 66 (-14.50, 
p<0.001), consistent with the mNIS+7 primary endpoint results .  
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 65/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With respect to BMI and mBMI the results cannot be considered conclusive since the Inotersen-placebo 
change from Baseline was small (0.5) and not statistically significant. Only a trend in favour of 
inotersen was observed and this could not be confirmed with the results from mBMI. 
The secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoint analyses were mostly supportive of the positive efficacy 
outcome for the inotersen group. However, the CHMP considered that the evaluation of secondary 
endpoints should be repeated using sensitivity analysis 6 which was considered of highest relevance in 
this setting. The Applicant presented the requested analysis and has highlighted the differences in 
statistical significance compared to the MMRM analysis. Overall results for secondary, tertiary and 
exploratory endpoints using sensitivity analysis 6 were mostly consistent with results of the MMRM 
analysis, although the effect sizes were, as expected, overall smaller. It is worth mentioning that, 
when sensitivity analysis 6 was applied, changes in the nerve conduction score in m+7, the composite 
score and the nerve conduction score in +7, the reflexes score in NIS and the autonomic (GI/urinary 
incontinence and other) in NSC were not statistically significant and had p-values greater than 0.05, 
due to a reduced effect estimate compared to the MMRM analysis.   
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis 
Changes from Baseline in mNIS+7 composite score and Norfolk QoL-DN total score were examined in 
17 subgroups in CS2, including the stratification factors, presence or absence of cardiomyopathy, 
region, and selected demographics. A statistically significant benefit for inotersen treatment compared 
to placebo treatment was observed in all 17 subgroups based on mNIS+7 and in 11 subgroups based 
on Norfolk QoL-DN at Week 66. The 8 subgroups representing the stratification factors or 
presence/absence of cardiomyopathy were statistically significant for both mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-
DN at Week 66 in all cases but one, which showed a trend (Norfolk QoL-DN: previous treatment with 
tafamidis or diflunisal, p=0.052). 
With respect to the subgroup analysis, it is noted that a very small number of non-white patients were 
included in the CS2 study 6 in the placebo group and 6 in the inotersen 300mg group and values were 
obtained at week 66 for 5 patients in the placebo group and 3 in the inotersen group. 
In the case of female and male population the numbers of patients were more balanced and the 
differences in LSMs between treatment groups were similar. No statistically significant treatment-by-
sex interactions were observed. 
However, subgroups were also analysed using an MMRM analysis which is not considered to address a 
treatment effect of relevance in this setting. Instead, sensitivity analysis 6 is considered of highest 
importance and the Applicant has repeated subgroup evaluation using sensitivity analysis 6. All 
relevant changes compared to the MMRM analysis have been highlighted, but overall results using 
sensitivity analysis 6 are similar compared to the primary MMRM analysis, although the effect sizes 
are, as expected, overall smaller.

Forest Plots of Subgroup Analysis for mNIS+7 With Multiple Imputation Data Assuming 
Jump to Reference (On-Study) - CS2 Safety Set 
From the Forest plots (Figures 6 and 7) consistency can be observed for mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN 
in the subgroups. In the case of mNIS+7 the effects were significant in all subgroups, whilst there 
were non-significant effects in some subgroups for the Norfolk QoL-DN such as in non-white patients 
(due to the very small number of non-white patients) and in patients 65 years or older. However, this 
was also observed for the MMRM analysis.  
It is noted that the effect seems to be larger for stage 2 than for stage 1 patients (especially for the 
mNIS+7).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Elderly patients 
Subgroup analyses were performed based on data collected in the pivotal study CS-2 and CS-3, but 
not a study dedicated in older subjects. The disposition of the elderly patients in the two trials based 
on age brackets is presented below:

A subgroup analysis by age in two groups <65 years and ≥65 years was performed. Efficacy was 
investigated in the study CS2 and safety was evaluated in study CS3. The oldest subjects who 
participated in the pivotal CS2 trial were a 78 year old white male who received inotersen and an 81 
year old white female who received placebo. The values at baseline were comparable for patients ≥65 
years without noticeable differences (mean value of mNIS+7 Composite Score was 80.19 for placebo 
and 80.85 for inotersen 300mg and mean value of Norfolk QoL-DN was 49.55 for placebo and 47.19 
for inotersen 300mg).  
In study CS2, subjects aged <65 years and ≥65 years showed a statistically significant difference in 
favour of inotersen treatment compared with placebo at Week 35 and Week 66, based on changes 
from Baseline in mNIS+7 composite score. The differences in LSMs between inotersen and placebo 
were statistically significant at Week 66 in both age groups. Subjects ≥65 years of age also showed a 
statistically significant difference in favour of inotersen treatment at Week 35. A statistically significant 
treatment-by-age interaction at the 10% significance level was observed at Week 35 (p=0.064), but 
not at Week 66. 
Changes from Baseline in Norfolk QoL-DN total score showed a statistically significant difference in 
favour of inotersen in subjects <65 years of age at Week 66 and trends in favour of inotersen 
treatment were observed at Week 35 (MMRM analysis). Statistical significance was not achieved at 
either time point in subjects ≥65 years of age, but there was a trend in favour of inotersen treatment 
at both time points. The differences in LSMs were similar for the 2 age groups at Week 35. At Week 
66, a statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed at the 10% significance 
level (p=0.069). 
These analyses were repeated using sensitivity analysis 6, which is considered of highest relevance. In 
the case of mNIS+7 the effects were significant in all subgroups and in patients 65 years or older. 
However, it was noted that the effect on Norfolk QoL-DN is considerably smaller and non-significant 
(but still in favour of inotersen) for older patients compared to that for patients lower than 65 years of 
age (using either MMRM or sensitivity analysis 6).  
CM-ECHO set 
In the CS2 CM-ECHO Set, some Baseline disease characteristics suggested that subjects in the 
inotersen treatment group had slightly more severe cardiomyopathy at study entry compared with 
subjects in the placebo group. A higher proportion of subjects in the inotersen group (66.4%) were 
included in the CM ECHO Set compared with subjects in the placebo group (55.0%) in study CS2. 
Approximately 45% of subjects in CS3 had a concomitant diagnosis of hATTR-CM at CS2 entry, with a 
mean duration from diagnosis of 36.4 months at the time of CS3 entry.

Table 14 
Number of Subjects Included in Each Analysis 
Subjects in the inotersen group had a slightly longer duration from onset of hATTR-CM symptoms and 
a higher mean Baseline NT-proBNP concentration at study entry compared with the placebo group. The 
mean duration of hATTR-PN disease from the time of diagnosis and onset of symptoms was also longer 
in subjects in the inotersen group (35.0 months and 63.4 months, respectively) compared with 
subjects in the placebo group (23.3 months and 54.0 months, respectively) in the CM-ECHO Set. 
The LSM changes from Baseline in mNIS+7 showed a statistically significant difference in favour of 
inotersen treatment compared with placebo at Week 35 and Week 66 in the CM-ECHO Set and the 
non-CM-ECHO Set (Table 19). The differences in LSMs between treatment groups were similar in the 
CM-ECHO Set and the non-CM-ECHO Set at both time points.

Based on Norfolk QoL-DN total score, subjects who received inotersen in the CM-ECHO Set appeared to 
progress faster than subjects who received inotersen in the non-CM-ECHO Set (Table 20). A 
statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction was observed at Week 35 (p=0.089), but not 
at Week 66.

In CS2, mean GLS values were abnormal at Baseline in both groups in the CM-ECHO Set, as compared 
with established reference ranges [Smiseth, 2016]. No statistically significant improvements in GLS 
were observed with inotersen compared with placebo in the CM-ECHO Set or the ECHO Subgroup 
(Table 20). Based on ranges utilized in other cardiovascular conditions [Smiseth, 2016], no clinically 
significant worsening of GLS was observed in either treatment group. Consequently, it was difficult to 
evaluate a potential benefit of inotersen treatment over the time frame of CS2.

a.  Positive changes from Baseline indicate a worsening in GLS. 
Mean GLS values were also abnormal at CS3 Baseline in both groups in the CM-ECHO Set, as 
compared with established ranges [Yingchoncharoen, 2013; Smiseth, 2016]. However, the changes in 
GLS observed in both groups (inotersen-inotersen and placebo-inotersen) over time were small and 
variable.  
Taken together, the duration of the studies was likely too short to evaluate potential benefits of 
inotersen on GLS. 
No statistically significant differences were observed between the inotersen group and the placebo 
group in the CS2 CM-ECHO Set in selected parameters of left ventricular (LV) size and function 
including interventricular septum (IVS) thickness, posterior wall thickness, LV ejection fraction, LV 
mass, LV mass index, left atrial strain, or E/Em lateral ratio. The changes in key ECHO measurements 
related to cardiac wall thickness (LV mass, intraventricular septum thickness, posterior wall thickness) 
showed an overall decrease at Week 65 that was numerically greater in the inotersen group compared 
with the placebo group. 
Further analyses of cardiac wall thickness parameters (LV mass, IVS thickness, and posterior wall 
thickness) were conducted in a subgroup of subjects with severe cardiomyopathy, defined as a 
Baseline IVS thickness ≥ 1.5 cm. The placebo subjects showed an increase in cardiac wall thickness 
parameters while the inotersen subjects showed a reduction in wall thickness. The differences in the

LSM changes from Baseline between the inotersen and placebo groups were statistically significant for 
all 3 parameters (Table 20). The decrease in cardiac thickness and mass suggest regression of cardiac 
amyloid.

Statistically significant differences in the ratio of geometric means for NT-proBNP were observed 
between the inotersen and placebo groups in the FAS at Week 13 and Week 35, but not at Week 65.

Supportive study 
Supportive study CS3 
The Supportive study CS3 was an open label extension multicentre study for an additional 260 weeks 
(5 years, currently ongoing), which recruited patients who had satisfactorily completed CS2.  
Eligible subjects who had satisfactorily completed CS2 receive 300 mg inotersen once weekly for up to 
260 weeks (5 years) in the OLE. Subjects who had a dose reduction or schedule change in the parent 
study are permitted to continue with the adjusted dose level or schedule in the OLE. Under special

circumstances, subjects who participated in CS2 but did not complete the full treatment period were 
allowed to participate in this study with approval from the Sponsor. All subjects receive supplemental 
doses of the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin A. In CS3, the efficacy of extended dosing 
with inotersen was evaluated as a secondary objective, and the majority of efficacy assessments 
identified for CS2 were also evaluated in CS3. 
Figure 8 
CS3 Design and Treatment Schema. 
There was no randomization in this OLE study. All subjects received inotersen. After completion of 
treatment, subjects enter the 3-month post-treatment evaluation period that consists of clinic and 
non-clinic visits for safety monitoring. 
Treatment with 300 mg inotersen once weekly for up to 260 weeks (5 years) was continued for 
patients who participated in ISIS 420915-CS2. 
Consistent with the pivotal study, CS3 is evaluating efficacy of inotersen by measuring mNIS+7 and 
the Norfolk QoL-DN total score, but in CS3, they are assessed as secondary endpoints. The efficacy 
endpoints in CS3 included changes from CS2 Baseline and CS3 Baseline at Week 78, Week 156, and at 
the end of each subsequent treatment year. For some endpoints, other time points were also 
summarized. 
The efficacy data from CS3 are supportive of those from CS2 and should be considered in the context 
of the following important limitations: 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 79/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The interim analysis data are summarized only and do not include the primary statistical 
analysis; the mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) analyses will be completed at the 
end of the study. 
• 
The open-label design, in contrast to placebo-controlled, has the potential to bias subjective 
endpoints. 
• 
The study is ongoing, with an enrollment period of more than 2.5 years. Therefore, efficacy 
data were not complete at the time of the interim analysis, and subject numbers were limited at many 
time points, particularly beyond Week 78. 
In addition, an investigator-initiated, open-label study to assess long-term safety and tolerability of 
inotersen 300 mg subcutaneous injection once weekly for 24 months enrolled approximately 20 
patients with ATTR-CM [Benson, 2017]. The investigator-initiated study does not contribute with data 
supporting the efficacy claims. 
The results obtained with the open label extension study corroborated the results obtained with CS2 
study and efficacy was maintained throughout the whole duration of the study.  However, the effect 
size for the inotersen-inotersen group was not as large as in the case of placebo-inotersen group. 
According to the Applicant, changes from CS2 Baseline in mNIS+7 composite score and Norfolk QoL-
DN total score showed less progression in the inotersen-inotersen group compared with the placebo-
inotersen group at CS3 Weeks 26, 52, and 78, indicating continued benefit with earlier inotersen 
treatment. This argument however, is a postulation that would require further confirmation with the 
continuation of the CS3 study.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical development programme of inotersen is comprised of the Phase 1 first-in-human study in 
healthy subjects (CS1), the Phase 2/3 pivotal study in hATTR-PN patients (CS2), and the Phase 3 open 
label extension study (CS3).   
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A dose-finding study (CS1) investigating doses of from 50 mg to 400 mg found a maximum effect in 
TTR reduction with the 300 mg and 400 mg doses. Only minimal differences in the effect of inotersen 
were detected between the 300 mg and the 400 mg doses and the effect did not increase further with 
the 400 mg dose. Therefore, the decision to take the dose of 300 mg forward into phase 2/3 is 
acceptable.  
The single pivotal Phase 2/3 study to support the marketing authorisation application was a 
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 15 months’ duration. The protocol 
was discussed with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The applicant followed the scientific advice 
given. 
The sample size calculation and the randomization procedure are acceptable. In general, the 
procedures to maintain the blind in the personnel involved in the trial conduct were also appropriate. 
However, the role of the external partner of the Applicant was initially unclear. The Applicant clarified 
that individuals that had access to unblinded safety, efficacy and PD data were R&D leads and Safety 
and Pharmacovigilance lead of the Partner Company. The individuals were not part of the team 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 80/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
responsible for the conduct of the study and the firewall was maintained between these individuals, 
others at GSK, and the study team.   
The pivotal study CS2 recruited subjects with stage 1 or 2 hATTR-PN with a Neuropathy Impairment 
Score (NIS) ≥10 and ≤130. This study investigated the change from baseline in Modified Neuropathy 
Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7) and in Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) at 
week 65/66 as co primary endpoints. The choice of end-points has been discussed during a Scientific 
Advice procedure in 2012 (Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/2286/1/2012/III). The Applicant has followed 
the recommendations of CHMP which, amongst others, stated that for the intended population, 
Neuropathy Impairment Score-lower limb (NIS-LL) is not appropriate. The Applicant has discussed the 
validity of Norfolk QoL-DN. This was not the case with modified NIS+7 score and at the CHMP’s 
request the Applicant presented relevant arguments. The existence of recent publications on the 
performance of modified NIS+7 and its use in clinical studies supporting its validity has been noted by 
the CHMP.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The baseline disease characteristics showed that the subjects in the inotersen group, on average, had 
more advanced autonomic neuropathy, sensorimotor neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy before starting 
treatment. However, (i) a relatively large effect size was observed between inotersen 300 mg and 
placebo groups with regard to change from baseline in the primary endpoints, mNIS+7 and Norfolk 
QoL-DN, (ii) other baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups (i.e. random 
imbalances are covered by the statistical test), and (iii) change from baseline is analysed for all 
endpoints and evaluation includes a baseline covariate. 
Both co-primary endpoints chosen, the changes from Baseline in mNIS+7 composite score and Norfolk 
QoL-DN total score, showed statistically significant benefit for inotersen compared with placebo at 
Week 66, as well as, at the earlier time point assessed, Week  35. Statistically, the primary endpoints 
were analysed in a hierarchical manner in order to protect against familywise type I error rate. The 
effect size observed in the two primary endpoints is considered large and clinically relevant, since the 
primary endpoints are considered to reflect the clinical condition of the patients and able to detect 
disease progression. The primary efficacy endpoint data were analyzed primarily using a Mixed Effects 
Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM).  
Thirteen sensitivity analyses were performed and confirmed the robustness of the efficacy results and 
the clinically relevant effect size for the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis, 
and statistical significance was maintained with all analysis at both Week 35 and Week 66.  
However, the primary MMRM analysis is not considered of primary importance due to the following 
deficiencies: (1) an imbalanced number of patients was excluded from the FAS (1 and 6 patients were 
excluded for placebo and inotersen, respectively). (2) An imbalanced number of patients in the FAS 
was excluded from the MMRM analysis (3 (4) placebo and 11 (12) inotersen patients were excluded 
from analysis of mNIS+7 (Norfolk QoL DN)). (3) A hypothetical strategy estimand is used which 
addresses the effect had no patient discontinued treatment. This may yield an overoptimistic effect 
which is less relevant from a clinical efficacy perspective, since AEs are the main reason for treatment 
discontinuation (TD). A treatment policy strategy is considered of highest relevance reflecting an 
overall expected treatment effect irrespective of early treatment discontinuation. Of the 13 sensitivity 
analyses, No 6 is considered to be the most appropriate because in case data after TD (which is 
needed to reliably address a treatment policy strategy) is missing using placebo-based multiple 
imputation and hence addressing the treatment effect if treatment had no effect after TD is a 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 81/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reasonable assumption to handle missing data. Sensitivity analysis 6 accounts for the unfavourable 
effect of treatment discontinuation and does not exclude patients from analysis. Therefore the CHMP 
considered that the results of this analysis are the most suitable to be included in the product 
information as they reflect the most clinically relevant estimand. Due to an increasing treatment effect 
over time and due to using placebo-based imputation, this estimand depends on the time point of 
analysis. 
Dose interruptions frequently occurred especially in the inotersen arm. However, subjects were mostly 
followed-up despite dose interruptions. Most subjects (49 of 59 inotersen and 20 of 23 placebo) with 
dose interruptions were completely followed up until the end of the study and hence had non-missing 
week 66 data. All data despite dose interruptions were included in the MMRM and all sensitivity 
analyses. Results of all sensitivity analyses – in particular sensitivity analysis 6 that addresses the 
treatment effect if treatment has no effect after treatment discontinuation (i.e. a kind of ‘worst case’ 
assumption for dose interruption effect) - are consistent with the MMRM analysis for week 66. 
For Norfolk QoL-DN, results for all 9 sensitivity analyses were also consistent with the primary 
analysis, and statistical significance was maintained across all analyses at Week 66.   It is 
acknowledged that a number of sensitivity analyses were performed without identifying discrepancies 
and these analyses can be considered as confirmatory of the primary analysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoints.   
There was also a responder analysis (sensitivity analysis 10) that showed consistency of benefit of 
inotersen over multiple thresholds. Clinically relevant progression of disease was improved or arrested 
in 36.5% of subjects treated with inotersen as evidenced by improvement (negative change) or no 
worsening in the mNIS+7 composite score (p<0.032) and 50% of subjects treated with inotersen had 
improvement (negative change) or no worsening based on the Norfolk QoL-DN total score (p<0.008) 
(observed cases). Based on the FAS and calculated by the CHMP, for mNIS+7 clinically relevant 
progression of disease was improved or arrested in 29.2% and 16.9% of subjects treated with 
inotersen and placebo, respectively (p=0.081). For Norfolk QoL-DN total score 39.6% (inotersen) and 
23.7% (placebo) showed improvement or no worsening (p=0.039).   
Subgroup analyses revealed that there were either statistically significant differences or trends in favor 
of inotersen treatment in the various subgroups, supportive of the positive efficacy outcome. Analyses 
in non-White subjects were limited due to small numbers.  However, subgroup analyses were based on 
the MMRM analysis and they were repeated using sensitivity analysis 6. Overall, results for subgroup 
analysis using sensitivity analysis 6 were similar compared to the primary MMRM analysis, although the 
effect sizes are, as expected, overall smaller. From the Forest plots, consistency can be observed for 
mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN in the subgroups, in favour of inotersen. In the case of mNIS+7 the 
effects were statistically significant in all subgroups, whilst there were non-significant effects in some 
subgroups for the Norfolk QoL-DN such as in females, non-white patients (due to the very small 
number of non-white patients), patients 65 years or older and the regions Europe and North America. 
However, this was also observed for the MMRM analysis.  
It is noted that the effect seems to be larger for stage 2 than for stage 1 patients (especially for the 
mNIS+7). 
The results presented for the open label extension study CS3 corroborated the results for CS2 study 
and efficacy was maintained throughout the whole duration of the study.  Whereas, the effect size was 
smaller for the inotersen-inotersen group compared to the placebo-inotersen group in CS3, it was 
larger in the inotersen-inotersen group when considering the whole study duration of CS2+CS3, 
indicating that benefits may be larger when starting treatment earlier in the disease.  However, no 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 82/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
definitive conclusion can be drawn at this point in time and this is expected to be further investigated 
and confirmed by the final results of CS3. 
The Applicant has provided the requested evaluation of the treatment effect estimates per study site. 
The Applicant stated that the two sites that recruited many patients are centres of excellence: one in 
Europe, site 1817 and one in the USA, site 1823. The Applicant performed different analyses with 
results from all sites separately, from all sites pooled, from Europe only without site 1817, from USA 
only without site 1823, and from South America/New Zealand without site 1863.  
Based on the presented analyses, the CHMP concluded that there was no specific site influencing to a 
greater extent the overall study results. 
CM-ECHO set 
Approximately 40% of subjects had a concomitant diagnosis of hATTR-CM at study entry, with a mean 
duration from diagnosis of 23.7 months. 45 (40.2%) subjects in Inotersen group and 22 (36.7%) 
subjects in the placebo group were diagnosed with hATTR-CM. The baseline characteristics did not 
show significant differences between the placebo and inotersen groups. 
It noted that a significant improvement was not consistently observed in GLS or ECHO parameters, 
which are associated with an improvement in cardiomyopathy. According to the Applicant the lack of 
statistical significance is not surprising, given the relatively short treatment period and that no 
clinically significant worsening was observed in the placebo group for any of the ECHO parameters 
included in the exploratory analysis in CS2 study. Prognosis and progression of disease in patients with 
hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy is better than in patients with primary 
amyloidosis with a median survival of 24 to 66 months (as reviewed by Mankad AK and Shah KB, Curr 
Cardiol Rep 2017; 19: 97). Furthermore, only patients in earlier stages of cardiac disease were 
included (NYHA I and II). The CHMP considered that the outcome measurement time points of 35 and 
62 weeks may indeed be too short to detect relevant effects on cardiac parameters in these patients. 
In addition, the results in study CS3 are difficult to interpret due to the low number of patients and the 
switch from placebo to inotersen. 
In a subgroup of the ECHO-CM patients with more advanced cardiac disease, the effects of inotersen 
appeared to be stronger but these very limited data and post-hoc analyses need to be interpreted with 
great caution. 
In addition, CHMP considered that ECHO parameters are not considered sufficient to demonstrate 
clinically relevant efficacy in patients with cardiomyopathy. Either a beneficial effect on morbidity/ 
mortality is expected or in case of an orphan disease, at least a beneficial effect on functional 
parameters e.g. 6 Minute Walk Test or VO2 max during exercise testing in the absence of a 
detrimental effect on morbidity/mortality in the relevant population should be demonstrated. These 
parameters were not investigated in CS2 and CS3. 
Advanced disease (stage 3) patients 
The disease hATTR-PN is classified into 3 stages such that i) Stage 1 patients do not require assistance 
with ambulation, ii) Stage 2 patients do require assistance with ambulation, and iii) Stage 3 patients 
are bound to wheelchair. Approximately two-thirds of treated subjects (67.4 %, n = 116) had Stage 1 
hATTR-PN at Baseline and only 32.6 % (n = 56) of subjects were classified as having Stage 2.  
Patients with stage 3 hATTR polyneuropathy were not enrolled in the pivotal study CS2 but the 
Applicant identified a small number of six (6) patients on placebo treatment who progressed to stage 3 
during the CS2 study. These patients switched to treatment with inotersen at the beginning of the 
Assessment report

extension study CS3. The applicant calculated annualised rates of the disease progression in these 
patients which suggested some positive effect of inotersen for these patients in the CS3 study. Of 
However, 4 out of these 6 patients discontinued treatment prematurely and the variability of the 
measured endpoints does not allow annualisation of the observed short-term effects. In addition, this 
was a post-hoc analyses including only a few patients of the placebo group, thus rendering the analysis 
subject to bias.  
In order to be able to evaluate the outcome more clearly, the assessors prepared visual 
representations of mNIS+7 Composite Score (absolute values) and  Norfolk QOL-DN Total Score for 
the six patients who progressed to Stage 3 disease, based on the data presented by the Applicant 
(Figures C and D). The y-axes in both graphs represent the endpoints’ scores and a higher number 
translates into worse condition. The shaded column in the graphs represents the last measurement at 
week 66 for study CS2, when the patients were still on placebo and the first measurement at baseline 
of study CS3 when the patients started receiving inotersen treatment. The graphs indicate that at least 
in one of the primary endpoints a slower progression of the disease condition could be observed for 4 
of these patients at stage 3 who received inotersen treatment, compared to being at stage 2 and 
receiving placebo.

The Applicant also presented safety data of the six patients who were on placebo treatment in CS2 and 
progressed to Disease Stage 3.   For 4 of these patients thrombocytopenia was recorded as a TEAE and 
for 1 patient decreased platelet count was observed, while these patients were on treatment with 
inotersen. With respect to renal function, the eGFR values remained at baseline levels in 5 patients and 
slightly improved in one patient. Although the AEs are in line with the inotersen safety profile in the 
overall population – it cannot be ruled out that inotersen could also have a more unfavourable safety 
profile in  subjects with a more advanced disease stage. Not only the limited data hamper any firm 
conclusions but also the fact that most of the patients had various dose pauses during CS3 and 4 of 6 
patients did not complete treatment (discontinued, withdrew voluntarily or terminated treatment 
early). 
From the mechanism of action and biological plausibility, it would be expected that treatment with 
inotersen delays disease progression in all subjects regardless of disease stage. However, evidence of 
beneficial effects of starting inotersen treatment in patients at an advanced stage (i.e. stage 3) is 
unconvincing and efficacy demonstrated for earlier disease stages cannot simply be extrapolated to 
stage 3. Also, comparing the mean annualized rate of progression in CS3 with the one in CS2 may be 
biased towards concluding that progression is slower under inotersen as a result of selection of six 
placebo patients from CS2 that likely showed a stronger worsening of disease compared to other 
placebo patients not progressing to stage 3. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether the benefit/risk 
balance continues to be favourable in patients progressing to stage 3 of the disease, while being 
treated with inotersen. Based on the very limited data of subjects progressing to stage 3, the expected 
slowing of the disease progression cannot be confirmed.

Initially, the Applicant applied for a broad indication for the “treatment of adult patients with hereditary 
transthyretin amyloidosis”. Due to the limitations of the submitted clinical data in patients with stage 3 
polyneuropathy and in patients with cardiomyopathy, the CHMP requested a restriction of the 
indication to “treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary 
transthyretin amyloidosis”. 
The arguments were as follows:  
As per the inclusion/exclusion criteria, no patients with Stage 3 disease were included in the pivotal 
study CS2. Therefore, the study population is not reflected in the indication initially proposed by the 
applicant. Extrapolation of efficacy from earlier disease stages to stage 3 is not possible, the data on 
the 6 patient that progressed to stage 3 on placebo and were later treated with inotersen are too 
limited, and the analyses provided by the applicant are likely flawed. Thus, evidence is insufficient to 
allow a conclusion of efficacy of inotersen in patients with stage 3 disease.  
A subgroup of 45 patients (40%) in the inotersen group were diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy hATTR-
CM. Only patients with less advanced cardiac disease were included (NYHA I-II, mean NT-proBNP 
levels were only moderately increased). Although some positive effects of inotersen on ECHO 
parameters and biomarkers were observed, the clinical relevance of the findings cannot be judged in 
the absence of clinical functional tests such as the 6MWT or VO2max. 
The Applicant has finally agreed to restrict the indication to “treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 
polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR)”. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clear statistically significant difference in the change from baseline in the two primary efficacy 
endpoints mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN was observed between placebo and inotersen 300 mg group in 
patients with stage 1 and stage 2 hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN), 
which is supported by a substantial number of predefined sensitivity analyses. Also, sensitivity analysis 
6 which is considered of highest relevance instead of the pre-specified primary MMRM analysis yielded 
clearly significant results. The clinical relevance of the results was further supported by responder 
analysis (sensitivity analysis 10).  
Convincing effects on CM have not been shown. Therefore the Applicant has proposed a revised 
therapeutic indication with focus on polyneuropathy patients in accordance with the population studied.  
 Efficacy and safety of inotersen has not been systematically studied in patients with stage 3 disease 
and extrapolation of data from patients with Stage 1 and Stage 2 hATTR-PN is considered difficult.  Six 
patients from the placebo group that progressed to stage 3 and were treated with inotersen in the 
open label study but these data are insufficient to conclude on relevant efficacy. In the light of the 
safety concerns, especially thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk, the CHMP considered that efficacy 
needs to be more robustly shown in stage 3 patients. Moreover, four of the six patients who 
progressed to stage 3 did not complete treatment due to thrombocytopenia and other TEAEs. Given 
the uncertainties related to the effect of inotersen in stage 3 hATTR-PN patients the applicant agreed, 
during the procedure, not to pursue any longer an indication in this population. 
Based on the totality of presented evidence, the CHMP considered that efficacy of inotersen was 
demonstrated for treatment of stage 1 or Stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary 
transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR).

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety of inotersen is based on a completed pivotal phase 2/3 study (ISIS 420915-CS2; in 
this report, final on-study data are presented with cut-off date: 28th March 2017) and interim data 
from a currently ongoing open-label study (ISIS 420915-CS3; original data cut-off date = 28th 
February 2017; updated cut-off date 15th September 2017). Subjects in CS2 were either randomised 
to placebo or inotersen 300 mg per week, while all subjects entering CS3 received inotersen, 
irrespective of treatment in CS2. The main body of the safety data base is generally considered 
adequately sized for a rare disease like hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR).  
The CS2 safety set informs on approximately 15-months safety data of inotersen compared to 
placebo, whereas the CS3 grouping reports on clinical safety for an additional 5-year period. Two 
further groupings of safety data are presented in the dossier: the longitudinal safety set refers to 
the safety profile of inotersen over the combined treatment periods in studies CS2 and CS3 (with 
reference to the CS2 baseline) in subjects, who received inotersen in both studies. The integrated 
inotersen safety set additionally includes subjects, who were randomised to placebo in the CS2 study 
and references results relative to the CS3 baseline. Results from a phase 1 single – and multiple dose 
study (CS1) are considered to be supportive in nature, while not pooled with the pivotal and the open-
label experience due to different study designs. In addition, the safety profile of inotersen is assumed 
to be different in healthy volunteers and patients with transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). In this 
assessment, the focus was set on results from the placebo-controlled study CS2, which forms the basis 
of information reflected in the SmPC. 
Subjects, who met additional ECHO inclusion criteria in CS2 formed the CM-ECHO subset and received 
additional transthoracic ECHO assessments during the treatment period in CS2. Safety parameters 
were intensively recorded in studies CS2 and CS3 (AESIs and OAEIs). In addition, laboratory 
parameters cover the most important safety issues with inotersen taking into account the signals from 
the preclinical data and the mechanistic features of the drug. 
There is an ongoing inotersen open - label study referenced in the dossier (Benson 2017) including 
both, hereditary and wild-type ATTR-CM patients. This investigator-initiated study is referred to as not 
contributing to this application. Upon CHMP’s request, few available safety data (serious adverse 
events) were provided by the applicant. This data did not reveal any new safety concerns. 
Patient exposure 
Placebo-controlled safety data of inotersen derive from a total of 113 subjects with hATTR of which 112 
subjects received at least one dose of inotersen (300 mg once weekly). 85 of 112 (75.9%) of 
inotersen-treated subjects in CS2 continued inotersen treatment in CS3. Similarly, 81.7% of subjects 
on placebo during CS2 received inotersen in CS3 (n=49). The number of subjects currently 
contributing to the open-label long-term experience of inotersen is 134 (as per the CS3 interim data 
cut-off 15th September 2017 provided at Day 106). The new interim CS3 data extends the cumulative 
CS3 safety data by 6.5 months. 112 (69.6%) and 69 (42.9%) patients had at least 1 year and 2 years 
of inotersen exposure. The longest inotersen treatment exposure is currently for 4.36 years in 2 
subjects. 27 of 134 subjects (20.1%) discontinued treatment for any reason in CS3 so far. Long-term 
safety information is currently limited as CS3 is ongoing and final results are not awaited in the course 
of this procedure. Hence, any conclusion on long-term outcomes of safety concerns is preliminary. 
Discontinuation rates in CS2 were almost twice as high for subjects on inotersen compared to 
placebo – treated subjects (23% vs. 13.3%), with the main reasons being adverse events (AEs) or 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 87/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
serious adverse events (SAEs) (14.2% vs. 1.7%). SAEs leading to discontinuations were determined 
the following adverse events of special interest (AESIs): thrombocytopenia in four patients and 
glomerulonephritis in two patients. Discontinuations due to disease progression were more pronounced 
in subjects on placebo compared to inotersen (5% vs. 1.8%). Subjects on inotersen-inotersen during 
CS3 were reported to discontinue more frequently due to TEAEs compared to those on placebo-
inotersen (9.4% vs. 4.1%), which might account for certain (S)AEs worsening over time. The reason 
for a higher percentage of subjects from the placebo-inotersen group that discontinued due to 
investigators judgement compared to those on inotersen-inotersen (7.5% vs. 1.4%) was not related to 
a specific risk. 
Subjects not continuing treatment in the open-label study CS3 were captured in the CS2 post-
treatment evaluation period (6 months duration) for further efficacy and safety assessment. 
Withdrawal from study due to an AE/SAE during this post-treatment evaluation period in 7% of 
subjects, who received inotersen in CS2, occurred as a consequence of the discontinuation from 
inotersen treatment due to an AE/SAE.  
A lower percentage of subjects on inotersen in CS2 received between 61 and 70 of the 67 planned 
doses compared to those on placebo (68.8% vs. 85%) probably due to the higher rate of 
discontinuations in the inotersen group.  
Dose holds were reported more frequently in inotersen-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated 
subjects in CS2 (52.7% vs. 38.3%). In particular, those differences were highest for holds due to 
platelet stopping rule (<75 x 109 /L; inotersen 11% vs. placebo 0%) and renally related issues 
(investigator decision; 13.4% vs. 0%), in line with the known class effects of AONs. In total, 63.4% of 
subjects (85 out of 134) had dose pauses during CS3. Increases in dose pauses during CS3 in each 
treatment group and for all reasons are considered a consequence of the increased exposure to 
inotersen during CS3.   
Baseline demographics of subjects in CS2 are in accordance with the target population, i.e. a mean 
age of 59.2 years, and slightly more male than female patients. Stratification was conducted for 
hATTR-PN disease stage (slightly more subjects with stage 1 than stage 2[67.4% vs. 32.6%], 
existence of the main mutation associated with hATTR, i.e. Val30Met (V30M; balanced in study 
patients), and previous treatment with tafamidis or diflunisal (yes [57.6%] or no). Compared to the 
CS2 safety set, patients included and evaluated in the CM-ECHO set were slightly older and less had 
V30M mutations. Of interest, more subjects on inotersen qualified for inclusion in this subset compared 
to placebo (66.4% vs. 55%), contributing to the assumption that subjects on inotersen were more 
diseased than those on placebo. 
Supplemental medications given to all subjects in both studies were vitamin A products (at 
recommended daily allowance) in order to compensate a mechanistically – induced hypovitaminosis A 
and eye drops for dilatation (ERG examination). 
Adverse events 
Analyses were provided by system organ class (SOC), time to occurrence of adverse events, severity, 
and adverse event causality.  
The incidence of adverse events of subjects from CS2 was ~ 100% for inotersen and placebo.  
TEAEs were frequently found to be related to treatment and leading to a substantially higher number 
of discontinuations or withdrawals in subjects on inotersen compared to placebo in CS2. Adverse

events of special interest (AESIs) and SAEs were also higher in subjects on inotersen. TEAEs resulting 
in dose reduction and fatal TEAEs have been reported with inotersen only.  
Dose reductions subsequently leading to TEAEs were more frequently observed with longer inotersen 
exposure. A substantial number of dose interruptions/delays was reported for subjects on inotersen in 
CS2 (24.1%) and even more pronounced in subjects, who were switched from placebo during CS2 to 
inotersen during CS3 (46.9%). Irrespective of the reason, more than 70% of subjects on inotersen had 
at least one dose hold over the course of studies CS2 and CS3 combined, hampering an accurate 
clinical safety interpretation over time.  
Differences in TEAE incidences between inotersen and placebo could be seen on the level of the 
following SOCs (differences of ≥ 10%) for Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (6.7% placebo vs 
27.7% inotersen), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (55% placebo vs 85.7% 
inotersen), Investigations (30% placebo vs 52.7% inotersen), Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders 
(13.3% placebo vs 24.1% inotersen), and Eye Disorders (38.3% placebo vs 27.7% inotersen).  
SOC differences in TEAE occurrence between inotersen and placebo in the Blood and Lymphatic 
Disorders SOC derived from a higher frequency in TEAEs of anaemia and thrombocytopenia (described 
within adverse events of special interest). Anaemia (more pronounced in the inotersen group) might be 
caused by baseline imbalances in autonomic neuropathy (associated with impaired erythropoietin 
response in hATTR). This association is further supported by the fact that more inotersen than placebo 
subjects had haemoglobin and haematocrit values below LLN at baseline. 
TEAEs from the Cardiac Disorders SOC were balanced across treatment groups; however, the number 
of events was higher for inotersen than placebo, possibly as a consequence of more severe 
cardiomyopathy for inotersen-treated subjects at baseline. Medical history/conditions in line with 
cardiomyopathy (subjects were included in the CM-ECHO subset) preceded severe and/or serious 
TEAEs of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. However, also vascular adverse events like 
arterial hypotension and hypertension were observed more frequently in the inotersen group and more 
severe CKD renal impairment stages (i.e. stages 4 and 5) have only been reached by (single) subjects 
on inotersen. eGFR decreases from baseline to post-baseline of more than 25% or 50% were clearly 
attributed to inotersen treatment (see below). Such AEs in the different organ classes may be related 
to each other (e.g. sinustachycardia due to hypotension, oedema due to renal failure in patients with 
underlying cardiomyopathy, decreased renal function due to hypotension etc.). Upon CHMP’s request, 
the Applicant has identified 15 patients that had concomitant deterioration in parameters of renal 
function and AEs related to cardiac and/or vascular disorders. 10 of these patients were on inotersen, 
5 on placebo (representing 8.9 and 8.3% of the patients). The data did not indicate that renal AEs 
were a reason for cardiac events and vice versa in the study. The incidence of TEAEs did not increase 
with continuous treatment.  
There were several safety aspects that can be rated tolerability issues rather than significant safety 
problems, including TEAEs from the Ear and Labyrinth disorders SOC and Gastrointestinal Disorders 
SOC, the latter being a consequence of the underlying polyneuropathy. Inotersen as an antisense 
oligonucleotide was also found to be related to a higher number of TEAEs from the General Disorders 
and Administration Site Conditions SOC including injection site related events and constitutional 
symptoms. Even though the effect of inotersen on disease progression might lead to less weight loss in 
the target population, TEAEs in the Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders SOC (decreased appetite 
reported in 9.8% of subjects on inotersen) are likely to occur as a consequence of gastrointestinal 
events. Notably, two SAEs in this SOC led to death (cachexia) in subjects on inotersen.

A higher frequency of TEAEs in the Investigations SOC for inotersen was mainly driven by TEAEs of 
platelet count decreased.  
Orthostatic hypotension (incidence: 6.3% inotersen and 0% placebo) within the Vascular Disorders 
SOC is a known manifestation of hATTR-PN that is thought to be in line with inotersen-treated subjects 
having more advanced cardiac disease than those in the placebo group.  
The most commonly reported on-study TEAEs by preferred terms in the inotersen group affecting more 
than 10% of subjects with a difference in incidence of more than 5% with placebo were injection site 
erythema (31.3% vs. 0%), nausea, fatigue, headache, injection site pain (20.5% vs. 6.7%), peripheral 
edema, pyrexia (19.6% vs. 8.3%), chills (19.9% vs. 3.3%), myalgia, vomiting (15.2% vs. 5%), 
thrombocytopenia (13.4% vs. 1.7%), anaemia (13.4% vs. 3.3%), injection site pruritus (11.6% vs. 
0%), and platelet count decreased (10.7% vs. 0%). 
Similar findings derive from CS3. However, a slightly lower occurrence of overall TEAEs between 
treatment groups (placebo-inotersen 93.9% and inotersen-inotersen 89.4%) was noted. This finding 
might account for the fact that a majority of TEAEs tended to occur with initial inotersen treatment and 
diminish over time. This is for most TEAEs supported by higher frequencies in the placebo-inotersen 
group during CS3 (in a majority of events in line with incidences from the inotersen group in CS2) 
compared to inotersen-inotersen. Differences found in the two treatment groups more pronounced in 
subjects who received placebo during CS2 are thought to be either a consequence of the progression 
of the underlying disease (e.g. urinary tract infection, myalgia, fall, and TEAEs from the GI disorders 
SOC) or a higher susceptibility to first-time treatment with inotersen (e.g. injection side rash, injection 
side erythema, vomiting, injection side pain, thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, chills). 
Analysis of TEAE occurrence by time of first administration of inotersen revealed that most of the 
TEAEs had their highest incidence within the first 6 months after treatment initiation with inotersen, 
followed by a reduced reporting rate 6 to 12 months after start of treatment. The re-increase in 
reporting in months 12 to 24 can best be explained by transitioning subjects from placebo to inotersen 
in CS3, i.e. TEAEs in subjects from the placebo-inotersen group. TEAEs that nearly exclusively occurred 
during the initial 6 months are pyrexia, injection site reactions (erythema, pain), and headache. Low 
reporting rates after 24 months of treatment initiation are thought to be a result of the low number of 
subjects included and hamper any firm conclusion on real long-term effects of inotersen.  
Severity of TEAEs was mild or moderate in approximately two third of subjects in both studies. 28% of 
subjects on inotersen and 22% on placebo had at least one severe TEAE during CS2. Differences were 
mainly based on a higher incidence of severe cardiac disorder events (probably based on pre-existing 
cardiomyopathy) and GI events with inotersen. In CS3, the incidence of severe TEAEs was double as 
high in subjects with continuous inotersen treatment compared to those who previously received 
placebo. The most commonly reported severe TEAEs with inotersen were cardiac failure congestive, 
cardiac failure, cachexia, and renal impairment.  
Causality assessment for TEAEs with inotersen and placebo revealed that most of the TEAEs observed 
in the clinical studies CS2 and CS3 were drug-related (for inotersen but not for placebo; 77.7% vs. 
38.3%). Most of the TEAEs related to inotersen treatment were of tolerability issues, e.g. injection site 
reactions, chills, pyrexia, headache, and fatigue. Except for thrombocytopenia (related to drug for 11% 
of inotersen and 1.7% for placebo subjects), drug-related TEAEs were not TEAEs of special interest. 
Long-term inotersen was not obviously associated with a different pattern in drug-related TEAEs.  
Inclusion of adverse drug reactions into the SmPC is based on a frequency at least twice as high in 
inotersen treated patients compared to placebo and biological plausibility.

Upon CHMP’s request the Applicant has provided a comprehensive list of all adverse events and their 
frequencies that occurred during studies CS2 and CS3. Generally the events lack a biological 
plausibility or can be better explained by the underlying disease or concomitant treatment. None of 
these TEAEs require inclusion in the SmPC. The safety data that derived from analysis of the 
longitudinal and the inotersen integrated safety set mirrored the data from CS2 and CS3, while a 
majority of the events were those from CS2. 
Overall, interpretation of safety data is hampered by the underlying disease itself presenting with 
various symptoms overlapping with adverse events from inotersen. In addition, few long-term safety 
data are included in the dossier and safety profile might change when longer-term data will become 
available. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Ocular adverse events potentially related to vitamin A deficiency 
Inotersen is capable to induce a vitamin A deficiency state due to inhibition of TTR that is – together 
with retinol binding protein 4 - responsible for the transport of retinol to respective tissues. All subjects 
received supplemental vitamin A throughout the studies.  
Vitamin A deficiency – related adverse events were not detected in excess in studies CS2 or CS3 based 
on an overall similar occurrence of TEAEs in the respective treatment groups. A lower proportion of 
subjects on inotersen vs. placebo (27.7% vs. 38.3%) had TEAEs in the Eye Disorders SOC while on 
study. No subjects met the protocol-defined stopping rules for ocular effects. 
Electroretinogram assessments performed do support the TEAE evaluation regarding changes from 
baseline to evaluation endpoint. Slight imbalances between treatment groups in abnormalities from 
baseline to endpoint are not considered to be clinically significant.  
Laboratory values for vitamin A but not for retinyl palmitate were reduced in almost every subject 
receiving inotersen during CS2 and CS3. Retinyl palmitate measurements support the hypothesis that 
sufficient amounts of vitamin A are probably transported through chylomicrons when RBP4 levels are 
low. Since all patients received 3000 IU vitamin A during studies CS2 and CS3 the retinyl palmitate 
levels in chylomicrons without substitution are unknown. Therefore it remains unexplored if inotersen 
could be used safely without supplementation. However, data from the placebo arm in study CS2 show 
no increased incidence of AEs that could be attributed to vitamin A and the supplemented dose is well 
within the range that is considered safe based on the scientific literature. Therefore, while vitamin A 
supplementation is based on hypothetical risks it does not seem to pose a risk to patients.  
In regard to an anticipated risk for hypovitaminosis A in pregnancy opposed to the risk probably 
deriving from an oversupply of vitamin A in pregnancy, concrete recommendations are provided to 
prescribers in  SmPC section 4.4. The Applicant has proposed distinguished instructions to compensate 
for potential vitamin A deficiency for non-pregnant patients as well as planned and unintentional 
pregnancies. Overall this approach is welcomed. 
Adequate levels of vitamin A are required for normal embryo-foetal development. While high 
concentrations of vitamin A may have teratogenic effects, low levels could also be harmful to the 
foetus. Due to the long half-life of inotersen a significant deficit of vitamin A can develop even after 
discontinuing the drug if supplementation is also discontinued. On the other hand the risk of 
teratogenic effects is highest in the early pregnancy. The “WHO Guideline on Vitamin A 
supplementation in pregnant women” describes a risk for single doses of a vitamin A supplement 
greater than 25 000 IU, particularly between day 15 and day 60 following conception. This is much 
higher than the dose given during inotersen treatment and it cannot be excluded that the risks of 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 91/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
developing a vitamin A deficit during early pregnancy might be greater than the risks associated with 
continuing supplementation. 
Based on the available scientific data it is therefore not justified to give a strict recommendation to 
discontinue supplementation of vitamin A during the first trimester of pregnancy of an unplanned 
pregnancy.  
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia has been occasionally noted following antisense oligonucleotide treatment in 
preclinical test species but appears to be compound-specific rather than a common oligonucleotide 
class effect (Frazier et al. 2015). Other findings attributed thrombocytopenia to the class of ASOs 
caused by the backbone of antisense oligonucleotides and not by a specific nucleotide sequence. Chi 
et al. (2017) reviewed the risk of ASO-induced thrombocytopenia and came to the conclusion that two 
different mechanisms might be involved: a) a mild, transient and dose-dependent thrombocytopenia 
that is not necessarily involved in bleeding episodes; and b) a marked thrombocytopenia, emerging 
after repeated exposure to AONs and resulting in multiple hemorrhages in monkeys. The latter was 
also found in clinical studies with other ASOs, e.g. drisapersen. The pathogenesis of mild and severe 
thrombocytopenia is unclear but seems different. 
TEAEs of thrombocytopenia including platelet count decreases were reported with a frequency of 
24.1% in subjects on inotersen (versus 1.7% on placebo). Continuous treatment with inotersen in CS2 
and CS3 did obviously not lead to an increased reporting rate of TEAEs up to the new cut-off date 
(incidence decreased in CS3 to 14.1%). The occurrence of thrombocytopenia TEAEs in subjects who 
received placebo in CS2 and were then switched to inotersen, was similar to those for subjects on 
inotersen in CS2 (26.5% for placebo-inotersen – treated subjects). Discontinuations due to 
thrombocytopenia events have been reported for four subjects in CS2 (including one death due to 
intracranial haemorrhage in a subject subsequent to Grade 4 thrombocytopenia) and two subjects in 
CS3 (assumes to a total of 5.4% of subjects in the longitudinal safety set with data cut off 28th 
February 2017). Most of the events were rated mild to moderate in severity. Three subjects from CS2 
and one subject from CS3 presented with severe/serious AEs. However, classification of severity is 
strongly doubted on since Grade 3 and Grade 4 TEAEs (according to CTCAE criteria) related to platelet 
count values of 25 to 50 x 109/L and <25 x 109/L should at least be considered “severe” in nature. 
Thrombocytopenia events Grade 4 according to CTCAE criteria were confirmed in 3 of 112 subjects 
(2.7%) on inotersen in CS2 . In one of the subjects grade 4 thrombocytopenia could not be confirmed 
on repeated testing but was mentioned for completeness in the table for Grade 3 to 5 events of 
platelet counts in the ISS. Grade 3 to Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in these subjects was observed within 
the first six months of treatment with inotersen (i.e. Week 8 – Week 20). 
In CS3 (updated at Day 106), clinical narrative descriptions revealed five additional subjects with 
decreased platelet counts in line with Grade 3 (four subjects) or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (one 
subject). These patients were all on inotersen during CS2 and (except one subject) also had events of 
thrombocytopenia in CS2. However, platelet count decreases to values suspect of Grade 3 and Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia were first detected in CS3 (between Week 77 and 151 of inotersen treatment). The 
Applicant informed on an additional serious and severe event of thrombocytopenia Grade 3 after the 
DLP of CS3. This patient had occasional steep drops in platelet counts after approximately 22 months 
of inotersen treatment that recovered without interruption. However, this patient presented with 
further platelet decrease of 80% within ~8 weeks some months later that culminated into 
hospitalisation and treatment with corticosteroids. Except for a single occurrence of positive anti-PF4 
IgM, no further antiplatelet antibodies were reported for this subject.

Page 92/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the aforementioned subjects with Grade 3/ 4 thrombocytopenia, TEAEs related to haemorrhages 
have been additionally found in the narratives and included for example menorrhagia, haematomas, 
gingival bleeding, bruising and an intracranial haemorrhage as the worst presentation of bleeding 
events leading to death in this subject (severe thrombocytopenia with a nadir of <10 x 109/L was 
concomitantly reported with the SAE of intracranial haemorrhage the day prior to death). The subject 
had platelet count decreased at several occasions (approximately during three months starting within 
the first weeks of treatment). Platelet count monitoring rules were changed as a consequence of this 
event (from every 2-3 weeks monitoring to weekly controls). In subjects with Grade3/4 
thrombocytopenia events in study CS3, ecchymosis, haematoma, haematuria periorbital haemorrhage, 
and scleral haemorrhage were reported in the narratives. In one subject (CS3), narrative description 
could not fully rule out possible punctate left frontal lobe corona radiata intraparenchymal 
haemorrhage. This subject also had a bleeding from an injury on his foot that did not stop 
spontaneously. Corticosteroids were commenced in this subject at a platelet cut-off >25 x 109/L.  
Mean decreases in platelet counts followed a gradual pattern over the first 6 months of treatment 
with inotersen in CS2. However, mean (%) changes from baseline in CS2 should be interpreted with 
caution since the number of subjects included in the calculation by week was highly variable. Within 
three and six months of treatment, mean platelet counts in the inotersen group decreased by 20% and 
24% from baseline. At Week 65 (EOT) mean platelet counts decreased by 26% from baseline 
confirming that the most relevant mean decrease in platelet counts takes place in the first 6 months of 
treatment. Evaluation of mean platelet count decreases in CS3 is clearly impeded by the low number of 
subjects. However, it appears that no further significant mean reductions in platelets occurred. Of 
interest, an initial rise in platelet values from baseline was observed in studies CS2 and CS3 upon 
initiation of inotersen treatment, i.e. at Week 2/3. The cause for this finding was explained to be 
activation of the innate immune system that translated into increase in high sensitivity (hs)CRP with 
the first doses of inotersen and followed by reactive thrombocytosis. This information is adequately 
reflected in the SmPC. 
Differences between placebo and inotersen safety profiles are further supported by the reported 
platelet abnormalities:  
More than half of the subjects on inotersen had any value below the LLN for platelets (i.e. <140 x 
109/L). Decreases by more than 30% and 50% from baseline have been reported in 70.5% and 18% 
of subjects. Platelet counts below the LLN were more frequently reported in subjects continuing on 
inotersen during CS3 compared to those previously treated with placebo.  
Duration of thrombocytopenia was 28 weeks during CS2 and 41 weeks in CS3 in subjects on inotersen. 
Patients meeting the stopping rule for platelet counts set in the protocol for CS2 (i.e. platelet count < 
75×109/L, affecting approximately 10% of inotersen-treated subjects in CS2 and CS3) needed to 
pause any further doses until platelet count had recovered to >100×109/L. The overall duration of 
interruptions was longer in CS3 (8 weeks vs. 4.5 weeks in CS2). When the data from CS2 and CS3 are 
combined, the full dose of inotersen was successfully reinitiated in 11 subjects, but in 8 subjects a 
reduced dose (150 mg) was required to maintain platelet counts above 75 x 109/L. Platelets, although 
not systematically evaluated, tended to recover following treatment interruption or dose reduction; 
however, thrombocytopenic states recurred after treatment resumption accommodated by a reduction 
in doses while no systematical dose reduction has been presented. Although the concern that reduction 
in dose along with long dosing pauses due to thrombocytopenia negatively affects efficacy could be 
refuted, it remains unclear whether frequent treatment interruptions and rechallenges might even 
trigger immunological responses and enhance even steeper decreases in platelets. The formation of 
ADAs in subjects after at least one dose pause is of the same magnitude as in subjects tested positive 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 93/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
without dose pauses and therefore occurring over the whole duration of the study. This might be in 
support of a triggered response after dose pauses. 
At least severe thrombocytopenia seems to be immunologically mediated while other causes, e.g. bone 
marrow dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura, thrombotic microangiopathy, sepsis, platelet activation, and systemic complement activation 
could not be confirmed.  
All subjects with IgG positivity had experienced platelet declines compared to none with IgM positivity. 
All subjects with confirmed thrombocytopenia Grade 4 were reported to be positive for post-baseline 
treatment-emergent anti-platelet IgG antibodies but not all subjects with IgG anti-platelet antibodies 
developed Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Treatment-emergent anti-PF4 IgA was additionally present 
in one of these subjects and anti-PF4 IgM in two of them. In 4 of 8 subjects with Grade 3 (subjects, 
who were re-challenged with inotersen) or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, positive test results for 
antibodies directed against platelet surface glycoproteins were detected in addition to antiplatelet IgG 
antibodies. The combination of anti-platelet IgG plus positivity for GP IIb/IIIa (and even anti-PF4 
antibodies) may be contributory to the cases of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. This assumption can be 
extended to cases of Grade 3 thrombocytopenia as well. These patients might be at risk for even 
further and steeper decreases in platelet counts. Further evidence supportive of immunologically 
related thrombocytopenia derives from the response to corticoid therapy and non-adequate response 
to platelet transfusion (rapid elimination from the body). 
Analyses of platelet count decreases over different time intervals were used to establish platelet 
monitoring rules. However, platelet decreases in a number of subjects did not follow theoretical 
calculations and presented unpredictable platelet declines from any baseline or previous value over 
short time periods. The following baseline and post-baseline monitoring options as well as stopping 
rules were discussed during the procedure: 
- 
The recommendation not to initiate treatment with inotersen in subjects with baseline platelet 
counts < 100 x 109/L is not in line with the exclusion criteria set in study CS2 (i.e. patients 
with platelets < 125 x 109/L are excluded). However, argumentation brought by the Applicant 
based on analyses of inotersen-treated subjects presented with the original clinical safety 
summary for whom platelet counts are not expected to drop from >100×109/L to <75 x 109/L 
within a 2-week period is accepted taking into account that patients with a platelet count of 
100 x 109/L or less will have weekly platelet monitoring. 
-  Although the proposed 2-week monitoring frequency in subjects with baseline platelet counts 
of > 100 x 109/L is not in line with once-weekly measurement in clinical studies, the risk is 
manageable: a majority of subjects with decreases from >100 x 109/L to <75 x 109/L between 
two platelet count measures had at least one value of less than 100 x 109/L in the past that 
would have set them at weekly monitoring anyway.  
- 
The Applicant’s proposed recommendation of a twice weekly monitoring (until three successive 
values above 75) in subjects with platelet counts between 25 and 75 x 109/L (section 4.2) is 
considered adequate. Additional recommendations have been included in the SmPC for 
subjects with platelet counts of <50x109/L in whom more frequent monitoring should be 
considered if additional risk factors for bleeding are present. 
- 
Experience with reduction in dose frequency derives from a total of four subjects only (all of 
them had Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and had recovered to platelet counts of more than 75 x 
109/L). These subjects could only be managed on reduced dose frequency by additional dose 
interruptions after re-challenge with inotersen. 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 94/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  A single change in the treatment schedule (i.e. extension of the dosing interval from once 
weekly to every 2 weeks) is recommended in SmPC section 4.2 in contrast to protocol 
requirements of up to 2 dose adjustments. This approach is conservative and agreed by the 
CHMP. 
-  Re-initiation of inotersen is proposed to be in line with the study protocols, i.e. not earlier than 
after recovery of platelets to > 100 x 109/L). For this scenario, section 4.2 proposes to re-
initiate dosing at reduced frequency of every 2 weeks. 
-  Re-initiation of inotersen in 16 recovered subjects with previous platelet decreases <75 x 109/L 
led anew to thrombocytopenic states in all but one of these subjects and subsequently to 
further treatment interruptions. Clarifications provided by the Applicant could not sufficiently 
rule out that immunological responses are triggered by dose interruptions. In a majority of 
subjects, antiplatelet antibody testing was not adequately performed. In addition, when 
adjusted for treatment duration, a relatively higher number of subjects with at least one dose 
pause developed ADAs compared to subjects without dose pauses. 
-  Results from baseline anti-platelet antibody testing are not considered to be predictive for 
severe decreases in platelet counts under treatment. The overall clinical significance of post-
baseline antiplatelet antibodies remains uncertain. Although significantly more subjects on 
inotersen were reported to have had positive testing results upon direct and indirect testing of 
antiplatelet antibodies (including epitopes), two testing laboratories (one of which was a 
specialised reference laboratory) revealed variable results, questioning the validity of the 
testing systems at present. Furthermore, antiplatelet antibody testing was not performed at 
the platelet nadirs of the reviewed Grade 3 thrombocytopenic subjects in CS3. It should, 
however, be noted that all subjects with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in CS3 continue inotersen, 
despite numerous dose interruptions. The excess of anti-PF4 IgM in inotersen-treated subjects 
in CS2 and CS3 (CS3: 20% vs. 0% treatment-emergent anti-PF4 IgM in subjects on placebo-
inotersen vs. inotersen-inotersen) has been hypothesised to derive from the loading dose 
regimen in CS2 by intensively stimulating an innate immune system response during the first 
weeks of treatment. Emerging anti-PF4 IgMs are not necessarily thought to be of pathogenic 
value and were not found to emerge at the time of platelet nadirs in CS2 and CS3. 
-  However, post-baseline anti-platelet antibodies including antibodies directed against platelet 
surface glycoproteins are in sum considered key to the steepness of platelet decreases in 
subjects treated with inotersen. Although, for patients with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia 
antiplatelet antibody testing results could not verify steeper decreases in platelet counts based 
on the provided data and the implementation of various treatment interruptions upon 
continued inotersen treatment in the respective subjects, the current platelet count testing 
measures (including additional wording for platelet counts of <50 x 109/L in SmPC in regard to 
monitoring frequency considerations, corticosteroid treatment and subject-based risk factors) 
and dosing recommendations address the potential risk for severe bleedings.  
-  A recommendation has been added to monitor platelet counts every 2 weeks for 8 weeks 
following discontinuation of inotersen treatment. 
-  Currently, there are no data to support different platelet cut-off values for subjects treated 
with inotersen and antithrombotic agents. A footnote to Table 1 in the SmPC has been included 
to indicate anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication as risk factors for bleedings. Section 4.4 
of the SmPC includes a warning on the use of antithrombotic and antiplatelet medication with

inotersen and that is considered sufficient by the CHMP for managing the risk of bleedings in 
conjunction with the use of antithrombotic and antiplatelet medication.  
Renal impairment 
20.5% of subjects treated with inotersen and 10% of placebo-treated subjects reported TEAEs of renal 
impairment in CS2, while TEAEs in the Renal and Urinary Disorders SOC were similar in inotersen- and 
placebo-treated subjects (25% vs. 26.7%). Severe and serious renal impairment TEAEs were more 
pronounced in inotersen-treated subjects compared to placebo (4.5% vs. 1.7% and 5.4% vs. 0%) 
including PTs of glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, acute kidney injury, renal failure and 
renal impairment. Of interest, albuminuria and proteinuria were not characteristically pronounced in 
subjects on inotersen compared to placebo. Urinalysis revealed baseline imbalances at the expense of 
inotersen, e.g. for protein and protein/creatinine ratio. Subjects on inotersen had mean values of P/C 
ratio >ULN throughout the study. In the updated CS3 safety set, renal impairment TEAEs were found 
in a similar frequency in the placebo-inotersen and inotersen-inotersen group (12.2% vs. 10.6%). 
Urinalysis parameters fluctuated in both treatment groups. Supported by the analysis of the 
longitudinal safety set, TEAEs of renal impairment were found more pronounced within the first year of 
inotersen treatment.  
A total of 13 subjects experienced 17 severe or serious TEAEs in the Renal and Urinary Disorders 
SOC in CS2 and CS3 (16 events in CS2). One of these subjects was on placebo. Risk factors were 
present in these subjects at baseline and renal impairment was also in line with the underlying hATTR. 
Half of the events were rated possibly related to inotersen or placebo. Two SAEs (glomerulonephritis) 
led to discontinuation from treatment. In addition, two subjects, who died during study CS2 (one with 
cardiac failure congestive and one with cachexia) were reported to have had a worsening of renal 
function prior to death (see section ‘Serious adverse events and deaths’).  
Four cases of glomerulonephritis were reported (three happened in CS2 and were rated possibly 
related to inotersen; one “chronic glomerulonephritis” occurred during CS3 in a subject on inotersen-
inotersen). Common for these cases was elevated protein and/or albumin at baseline, presentation of 
significant proteinuria at the time of the events together with a decrease in eGFR in two of the 
subjects. Two subjects presented with reduced complement C3. The subject reported in CS3 (updated 
safety set) did neither present renal function loss nor significant proteinuria. Therefore, 
glomerulonephritis diagnosis is disputable. Renal biopsy reports were presented for the three subjects 
in CS2 and in two of the subjects two distinct processes have been found i.e. the underlying disease 
leading to amyloid deposits in the glomeruli and additional immunological contribution of inotersen 
evident by glomerular deposits for complement factors and IgG. In the third subject, pauci-immune 
glomerulonephritis was diagnosed lacking concomitant amyloid disposition. This subject also presented 
with anti-drug antibodies. None of the subjects fully recovered despite immunosuppressive therapy 
and one subject required permanent haemodialysis due to end stage renal failure. 
Renal function assessed by serum and urine parameters was variable over time for subjects on 
placebo and inotersen. Mean eGFR was found to be decreased in subjects on inotersen from Week 10 
post-baseline but remained stable on these reduced values >80 mL/min/1.73 m2. Subgroup analysis of 
subjects (on placebo and inotersen) in CS2 with disease stage 1 and 2 revealed that mean baseline 
eGFR values were quite similar in subjects on placebo and inotersen up to Week 10, from where 
separation between placebo and inotersen could be recognised in subjects with disease stage 2 but not 
with disease stage 1. In other words, subjects with hATTR disease stage 2, suffering from longer 
disease and more pronounced renal amyloidosis might present a patient group at risk for renal function

decline while treated with inotersen. There is currently no information on patients with stage 3 disease. 
However, even worse effects could be expected in those patients. Possible mechanistic explanation 
behind the observed decline in eGFR has been discussed, although contributing non-clinical data are 
not available. The Applicant hypothesised changes in renal tubular creatinine secretion as a 
consequence of greater tubular dysfunction in the inotersen arm due to renal amyloid deposits and 
probably additional accumulation of inotersen in the proximal tubular epithelium, which might 
consequently affect eGFR. Twice as many subjects on inotersen compared to placebo had shifts from 
Grade 1 (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) to Grade 2 (≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) during 
CS2. A higher number (double as high) of subjects on inotersen-inotersen in CS3 experienced shifts 
from Grade 1 or 2 to Grade 3 or 4 compared to subjects on placebo-inotersen. A more pronounced 
effect of inotersen on kidney function with longer treatment duration cannot be excluded.  
Mean serum creatinine and BUN increased over the course of CS2 in inotersen-treated subjects to a 
variable extend compared to placebo.  
Renal parameter abnormalities:  
CKD renal impairment stages 4 and 5 have only been reached by (single) subjects on inotersen. eGFR 
decreases from baseline to post-baseline of more than 25% or 50% were clearly attributed to 
inotersen, the latter reduction affected a total of 8 subjects on inotersen (and none on placebo) in 
accordance with the presentations of severe and/or serious TEAEs of renal impairment. Serum 
creatinine increases of >44.2µmol/L (0.5mg/dL) from baseline affected 12 subjects on inotersen 
(10.7% vs. 1 subject on placebo). The Applicant demonstrated overlap of these subjects, i.e. the 8 
subjects with 50% and more decrease in eGFR had at the same time a serum creatinine increase 
>44.2µmol/L. It appears that subjects who presented with reduced eGFR at baseline progressively 
declined early during treatment, while decreases of eGFR in subjects with near normal baseline values 
were found steeper and starting within the first 6 months of inotersen initiation (four subjects). As per 
the presentation in the responses some of the patients with renal function decline had pre-existing 
medical conditions and some had alternative explanation for these findings. Nevertheless, it seems 
that older subjects and those with disease stage 2 are more susceptible than others for those changes. 
Numerous dose interruptions were deemed necessary in subjects with renal function impairment 
hampering clear differentiation of conditions in line with the underlying disease or renal toxicity elicited 
by inotersen. However, inotersen seems to affect renal function indicated by the aforementioned eGFR 
decreases for which mechanistical explanation is only hypothetical (see above).  
Proteinuria was measured by analysing A/C and P/C ratios. A/C ratios >5x ULN post-baseline were 
evenly distributed between subjects on inotersen and placebo. P/C ratio (including higher molecular 
weight non-albumin proteins, which may be tubular as well as glomerular in origin) >5x ULN was 
found higher in subjects on inotersen compared to placebo. Since baseline mean ratios for both, A/C 
and P/C were higher in subjects assigned to inotersen than to placebo and for both treatment groups 
higher than ULN, and moreover, mean as well as individual ratios fluctuated over time, it is again 
difficult to assess a clear contribution of inotersen to this finding. Results are, however, in line with 
TEAEs of proteinuria (more subjects on inotersen vs. placebo) and albuminuria (similar between 
treatment groups) in CS2. In addition, there were marked differences in serum creatinine increases of 
>0.5 mg/dL from baseline in subjects on inotersen over placebo (10.7% vs. 1.7%), which is 
considered an indicator of acute renal failure. Divergences in serum creatinine increases of >0.5 mg/dL 
from baseline and in urine protein between treatment groups seem again to be related to more 
diseased subjects that were included in the inotersen arm, in some of which, however, inotersen might 
have contributed to more pronounced proteinuria.  
Results from CS3 are not significant regarding renal parameter abnormalities.

Findings on renal function decline and glomerulonephritis detection implemented in the 
SmPC: 
A contraindication for subjects with a urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 113 mg/mmol (1 g/g) 
has been included. Similarly, subjects with an eGFR of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2and less (in line with CKD 
Stage 3b and higher) should not receive inotersen based on a) the number of subjects with such 
baseline values in whom inotersen was permanently discontinued (4 of 5 subjects, even though not 
due to renal issues), b) the remaining uncertainty that the decline in renal function in some patients 
might have been triggered by inotersen especially in those patients with an anticipated increased risk 
for renal deterioration, i.e. those with pre-existing renal function impairment (older subjects and those 
with advanced disease stage (stage 2) might have an increased susceptibility). 
Monitoring algorithm for early glomerulonephritis detection was evaluated and proposed to be based 
on urinary P/C ratio (significant proteinuria was common for all of the three glomerulonephritis cases) 
and on eGFR.  
Wording in regard to renal function monitoring in section 4.4 of the SmPC includes: 
-  General renal monitoring (UPCR and eGFR) every 3 months or more frequently, as clinically 
indicated, based on history of chronic kidney disease and/or renal amyloidosis. Since the mean 
decline in eGFR of 5 to 10% from baseline reported in the clinical studies is not considered of 
significance in regard to the underlying disease with considerable fluid shifts and general 
susceptibility to urinary infections and dehydration, the proposed monitoring interval is deemed 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
-  Monitoring algorithm of every 4 weeks for detection of acute glomerulonephritis is based on 
patients at risk “(…) Patients with UPCR more than or equal to twice the upper limit of normal, 
or eGFR < 60 ml/min, which is confirmed on repeat testing (…)”. In the CHMP’s view this is 
acceptable recommendation since it provides a more conservative monitoring strategy 
compared to study protocol requirements. 
Notwithstanding the Applicant’s rationale that each of the three subjects with glomerulonephritis would 
have been detected with this algorithm, uncertainty remains in regard to a worsening of renal function 
(progressive decline in eGFR and increase in serum creatinine) with inotersen in addition to the 
presentation of glomerulonephritis. Therefore, and in line with adverse drug reactions from the Renal 
and urinary disorders SOC listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the warning subheading 
“Glomerulonephritis” in section 4.4 includes “renal function decline”. 
A mandatory dose pause is required for patients with UPCR ≥2g/g, followed by glomerulonephritis 
diagnosis. In case of an eGFR decrease of >30%, dosing is proposed to be withheld while examining 
the cause. Inotersen treatment can be resumed after exclusion of glomerulonephritis diagnosis but not 
before the renal function has improved. The above warnings and precautions are properly reflected in 
SmPC section 4.4.  
Renal damage may be triggered by concomitant nephrotoxic medication. Hence, cautious wording has 
been proposed in regard to nephrotoxic drugs and other drugs that might impair renal function with 
reference in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC. 
In conclusion, the complexity of findings in at least three (a fourth case is not confirmed) subjects with 
glomerulonephritis hampers a clear differentiation of presentations of renal findings but strongly 
argues for coexistence of renal amyloid deposits that derive from the underlying disease and 
concomitant drug-induced alteration of the immune system particularly related to complement 
activation and/or immune complex deposition. Glomerulonephritis is hence a designated identified risk

and reflected in the RMP. The extent to which inotersen worsens pre-existing renal impairment, 
especially in older subjects and those with advanced disease (stage 2) remains uncertain.  Although 
experience on patients with disease stage 3 is currently limited and does not point to a worsening of 
renal function with inotersen treatment, the outcome in a larger safety set is unknown. 
Other adverse events of interest (OAEIs) 
Coagulation abnormalities were not reported in the clinical studies while several events might be 
suspect of a broader coagulation in inotersen-treated subjects, i.e. embolic stroke, pulmonary 
embolism, deep vein thrombosis (in CS2 and CS3), thrombosis, venous thrombosis and Mesenteric 
artery occlusion (thrombotic events). It may be hypothesised that thrombotic and embolic events 
are caused by inflammatory lesions. TEAEs were balanced between placebo and inotersen in CS2. Only 
one additional subject in CS3 was noted. Upon request, the Applicant summarised available laboratory 
parameters which could indicate inflammatory and immunological processes. However, no evidence of 
a contribution of inotersen derived from these limited data. Therefore, occurrence of thrombotic and 
embolic events is probably attributed to the underlying immobility and cardiac failure in this patient 
population. 
Hepatic abnormality TEAEs were more frequent for inotersen-treated subjects (12.5%) compared to 
placebo (6.7%). Liver transaminase increases, i.e. alanine aminotransferase increased [ALT] and 
aspartate aminotransferase increased [AST] (3.3% placebo vs. 2.7% inotersen and 3.3% placebo vs. 
4.5% inotersen) were the liver abnormalities most frequently mentioned in both treatment groups.  
Mean baseline values of ALT (more specific for liver) and AST (also expressed in other tissues) were 
found similar in subjects on placebo and inotersen at baseline in CS2: 24.2 U/L vs. 23.4 U/L and 26.6 
U/L in each group. No increase from baseline was found in subjects on placebo, while highest mean 
ALT (mean AST) in inotersen-treated subjects was 32 U/L (31 U/L) at Week 18. In CS3, mean baseline 
ALT and AST were higher for subjects continuously treated with inotersen as compared to subjects 
previously treated with placebo. No significant changes were noted in either group in CS3. Total 
bilirubin mean baseline and post-baseline values were unremarkable.  
No SAEs were reported. One subject presented with Gilbert’s disease with a single increase in ALT ≥ 3 
x ULN and elevation in total bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN. Several stopping rules have been implemented in the 
protocol but were not met during the studies. 
Hepatobiliary laboratory abnormalities as defined by confirmed cut-offs of ALT >3x ULN, 5x ULN, 8x 
ULN, and 10x ULN in CS2 solely occurred in subjects on inotersen.  
Of the six subjects with ALT >3x ULN, one had a diagnosis of Gilbert’s disease, that is thought to be 
causal for the increases in transaminases. In four of the subjects, increases occurred at single 
occasions during the study and resolved in a short period of time while inotersen was continued. One 
subject was reported with gradual increases in ALT, AST, and ALP during inotersen treatment in CS2 
and CS3 lacking alternative causes and considered possibly related to inotersen. 
Laboratory value abnormalities were less frequent reported in CS3. 
In conclusion, a significant risk regarding liver abnormalities could not be deduced from available 
clinical data. GGT and GLDH measures would have been more specific parameters examining the risk 
of substance-specific liver toxicity over time, but are not included in the panel for liver toxicity 
evaluation. Hepatic toxicity is not reflected in the RMP, while use in patients with hepatic impairment is 
listed as missing information. Annual liver monitoring is recommended in the SmPC. Liver function is 
known to be affected by AONs in preclinical studies (Henry et al. 2007), and increases in mean ALT 
and AST have been reported with inotersen treatment but not with placebo together with single

subjects presenting with transaminases above defined cut-off values. The Applicant presented a 
discussion on on-treatment liver enzyme measurements and stopping rule implementation in the 
SmPC. The CHMP considered that no stopping rules are needed. Since the highest mean ALT and AST 
were detected in Week 18 of CS2, transaminase testing is proposed to be conducted at baseline, after 
4 months of treatment followed by yearly monitoring thereafter. More data is expected in a post 
marketing setting in order to characterize the possible risks related to hepatic abnormalities 
(hepatotoxicity)/hepatic impairment and this is one of the objectives of registry study proposed as a 
post-authorisation measure. 
Although commonly seen with other s.c. antisense oligonucleotide treatment and thought to be an 
inflammatory response to the injected drug, injection site reactions with inotersen were found 
rather a tolerability than a safety issue and affected 51% of subjects vs. 12% of subjects on placebo. 
The most common PTs of ISRs in CS2 were injection site erythema, pain, and pruritus. More severe 
presentations of ISR events (e.g. atrophy, induration, or haemorrhages) occurred in single subjects 
only. The total absence of injection site erythema in patients receiving placebo raised a question on the 
effectiveness of blinding in study CS2. However, post-hoc analyses confirmed that the magnitude of 
inotersen’s mean effect and difference from the placebo group remains approximately at the same 
level. Of note, a bias is nearly excluded since subjects did not know the injection site reaction status of 
other subjects. The frequency of ISR events reported in CS3 (in subjects on continuous inotersen 
treatment) was found lower compared to CS2 and thus longer inotersen treatment is not related to 
more frequent or severe presentations. This is also supported by analysis of local cutaneous reactions. 
Injections site reactions and adequate measures to alleviate them are included in the SmPC. 
More subjects on inotersen revealed non-specific events of flu-like symptoms like pyrexia and 
influenza-like illness that are known AEs for the class of AONs (Frazier et al. 2015) compared to 
placebo (7.1% vs. 1.7% and 9.8% vs. 0%). Symptoms emerged early during treatment and 
diminished thereafter. Both events are listed in the SmPC section 4.8 (pyrexia “very common”, 
influenza like illness “common”). 
CNS-related AEs might appear as a consequence of a loss of TTR – associated neuroprotection or as 
a consequence of the underlying autonomic neuropathy in hATTR. An imbalance of CNS TEAEs could be 
found in CS2 deriving from a higher frequency of headache, events related to paraesthesia, and 
syncope/presyncope. Headache is a known AE related to antisense treatment. The occurrence of 
syncope/loss of consciousness can alternatively be explained by the underlying disease and past 
medical history of the subjects (especially those with cardiomyopathy). 
Haemorrhage TEAEs were reported with similar incidence in subjects on placebo and inotersen 
(33.3% vs. 35.7%), while some differences are seen in the reporting of haematomas/ subdermal 
bleeds favouring placebo (20.5% and 11.7%). Analysis of haemorrhage TEAEs by platelet categories 
prior to the event in CS2 could not specifically attribute events to low platelet counts compared to 
normal range platelets. No significant difference was reported in the incidence of bleeding events in 
subjects with and without antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs and no difference in severity of events 
with or without such agents was noted. Although most of the bleeding events were rated mild to 
moderate, one single severe, serious and finally lethal bleeding TEAE of intracranial haemorrhage 
occurred in strong relation to Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (while this patient did not receive 
anticoagulation). Upon update of CS3 subjects after DLP, one SAE of haemorrhage intracranial was 
reported in a placebo-inotersen treated subject after a fall, considered unrelated to the drug. Platelet 
counts in this subject were reduced but not below 100x109/L. The subject had unstable anticoagulation 
parameters at baseline and during treatment with inotersen in CS3 while receiving anticoagulation 
treatment. Up to the data cut-off of 28th February 2017, bleeding events were balanced in subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 100/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with normal range platelets and those with platelets <LLN in CS3. Slightly more subjects with 
anticoagulation treatment in CS3 (irrespective of the treatment assignment in CS2) had a bleeding 
event compared to those without concomitant drugs (33% vs. 24%). 
TEAEs potentially related to complement activation were evaluated using an unspecific MedDRA 
query of hypersensitivity. No significant difference was noted between treatments. Complement factors 
were not routinely measured in CS2. The reports of complement C3 values below LLN were found to 
increase during CS2. 55% of inotersen-treated subjects had any post-baseline C3 value below LLN 
compared to placebo (21%). Mean complement C3 deceased by 33% from baseline to Week 65 in CS2 
(however, based on a low number of subjects with any measures).  
Other complement split product measures are of limited value due to the imbalance and overall low 
numbers of subjects. Complement split product measurement (C5a and Bb) was conducted in study 
CS1. Upon request, the Applicant presented all complement split product data for studies CS1 and 
CS2. Interpretation of data is hampered given the fact that otherwise healthy volunteers in CS1 were 
reported to have had complement factors C5a and Bb >ULN at baseline as well as at several time 
points during the study in the placebo multiple dose cohort, in the inotersen single dose and in the 
multiple dose cohorts. No specific pattern could be detected and complement factors were often 
measured at a single time point only, probably in line with biological variation or secondary to acute 
phase response. Assessment of complement factors in study CS2 is clearly hampered by the 
irregularity of measurements applied and the overall low number of subjects. Since abnormalities in 
complement parameters were also reported at baseline for subjects in either treatment group, the only 
conclusion that can be drawn from these data is that there might be relevant complement activation in 
subjects with hATTR. The contribution of inotersen remains unknown at this time. 
15% of thyroxine is transported via TTR protein, while 65% of thyroxine is transported by thyroxine 
blinding globulin and 20% by albumin and retinol. Hypothyroid states might therefore theoretically 
occur with inotersen treatment, but relevance is not clear at this time. A gradual increase in subjects 
with thyroxine values <LLN from baseline to Week 65 for inotersen vs. placebo was noted (19.8% vs. 
8.5%). At the same time, thyrotropin values above ULN were not remarkably different between 
inotersen and placebo. Three subjects were affected by hypothyroidism TEAEs in study CS2 compared 
to one subject of placebo. During CS3, no increased reporting rate of TEAEs was noted. The overall risk 
for post - baseline low thyroxine levels is comparable for males and females. Overall differences 
between males and females are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Ten deaths were reported during the clinical program up to the most recent data cut-off of 15th 
September 2017 in subjects on inotersen (inotersen in CS2 or inotersen-inotersen in CS3) and none in 
the placebo or placebo-inotersen group. Five of the deaths occurred during the placebo-controlled CS2 
and another five in the uncontrolled single-arm extension study CS3.  
While being aware of the 1:2 randomisation to placebo: inotersen, respectively, and differences in 
exposure, there is still an imbalance of death cases with 5 deaths occurring in the inotersen group vs. 
none in the placebo group in study CS2.  
The causes of death were: cachexia in two subjects (not related to inotersen), intestinal perforation 
(not related to inotersen), cardiac failure congestive in two subjects (one in CS2 and another in CS3; 
not related to inotersen), intracranial haemorrhage (possibly related to inotersen), cardiac failure (not 
related to inotersen), cardiac failure acute/bacteriaemia/septic shock (CS3), neuropathy peripheral 
(CS3), and endocarditis (CS3). One of the five deaths reported during CS2 is considered related to 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 101/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inotersen (i.e. a subject with an intracranial haemorrhage as a consequence of severe 
thrombocytopenia reported with a nadir of <10 x 109/L the day prior to death). A decreasing platelet 
count was reported over several study visits (approximately during three months starting within the 
first weeks of treatment). Two of the five deaths in CS2 were due to cachexia, which is a common 
cause for death in subjects with hATTR (e.g. Hund et al. 2012). The narratives of the two subjects 
revealed sufficient justification for a lack of inotersen contribution to these deaths. Another common 
death cause in subjects with hATTR is cardiac failure (congestive), which was also the cause for 
another death in CS2. Two of these subjects (one with cardiac failure congestive and another with 
cachexia) had a worsening of renal function prior to death and therefore, relation to inotersen 
treatment against the background of the striking imbalance in death cases was requested to be re-
assessed. Inotersen could finally not be rated as a contributor to these deaths. 
Last but not least, the cause for death was intestinal perforation during surgery for sigmoid volvulus in 
another subject; sigmoid volvulus is thought to be a consequence of disease progression in the 
subject. 
Five subjects died during the open-label experience. These patients seemed to have had a complicated 
disease progression during the study lacking evidence of inotersen involvement. Three of them had the 
Thy60Ala mutation, known to preferably induce cardiomyopathy (Ando et al. 2013; patient information 
on hereditary ATTR Thr60Ala amyloidosis from NHS Foundation Trust) but also polyneuropathy. The 
causes of death in these three subjects are in line with the findings in subjects with Thr60Ala mutation, 
i.e. congestive heart failure (in a subject with significant amyloid heart infiltration during CS2), cardiac 
failure acute/bacteraemia and septic shock, and neuropathy peripheral. The first two subjects had 
stage 2 disease and NYHA stage II at baseline. All of them had cardiomyopathy and orthostatic 
hypotension, which is a common feature in hATTR. Two of them also displayed a loss in renal function 
most obviously in line with cardiac impairment.  
Another subject died during CS3 under liver transplantation surgery from a myocardial lesion (rupture 
in the right ventricle) reported as cardiac failure, which is considered a chance event. 
Last but not least, death due to endocarditis subsequent to a systemic infection (which is considered 
causal) was reported two months after the last inotersen dose in study CS3 in a subject with various 
preceding (S)AEs. Death in this subject occurred 10 years after the first symptoms of hATTR, which is 
in line with life expectancy in subjects with the Val30Met mutation. The patient had disease stage 2 at 
baseline and was diagnosed with hATTR-CM five years prior to death.  
In conclusion, the imbalance in deaths is not considered to be caused by inotersen based on the 
compilation of data provided by the Applicant, except for the case of intracranial haemorrhage due to 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The open-label experience does not raise additional concerns since death 
causes are found similar to those in CS2. Currently, there seems to be no evidence for non-specific 
effects related to systemic ASO treatment. Overall, patients in the inotersen group had more advanced 
disease compared to patients on placebo and this circumstance may have, at least in part, contributed 
to the observed excess mortality on inotersen in CS2. 
Although the data provided by the Applicant did not fully address the requested discussion on excess 
mortality, i.e. it has not been taken into account that active treatment would have been expected to 
delay disease progression, it is unlikely that additional helpful insights can be gained from this 
discussion. 
SAEs were more common with inotersen compared to placebo (32.1% vs. 21.7%) and found to be in 
accordance with AESI /OESI but also included safety issues related to the underlying disease (e.g. 
infections, cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders, metabolism and 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018

nutrition disorders). Seven renally - related SAEs were reported in six subjects on inotersen and 
included three events of glomerulonephritis, one events of acute kidney injury, and one event each of 
renal failure, renal impairment and tubulointerstitial nephritis. Thrombocytopenia was reported as SAE 
in 2 (1.8%) subjects treated with inotersen in CS2 and in one subject in CS3. 
Treatment-related SAEs in CS2 further condensed SAEs to AESIs or OESIs. Some PTs are mentioned 
under different SOCs while probably belonging to the same presentation, i.e. thrombotic/embolic 
events of embolic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism as a possible consequence of 
inflammatory lesions caused by inotersen. 
Laboratory findings 
Main changes in laboratory parameters have been presented in respective sections of AESIs or OAEIs. 
In addition, serum albumin was found to be parallel translated to lower levels for subjects on 
inotersen relative to placebo, probably due to baseline inconsistencies between treatment groups 
(subjects with <LLN: inotersen 28%, placebo 10%). Patients with FAP show up with significantly 
decreased serum albumin levels as the disease progresses (Kugimiya et al. 2011) in line with a loss of 
antioxidative function of albumin to effectively suppress TTR amyloid formation. The incidence of 
serum albumin below the LLN increased to almost 50% of subjects in the inotersen-inotersen group 
during CS3, while the placebo-inotersen group achieved levels of inotersen in CS2.  
C-reactive protein (measured as hsCRP) is known to increase during treatment with antisense 
oligonucleotides. Baseline mean hsCRP was already above the ULN in both groups in CS2, which might 
be a consequence of inflammatory processes of the underlying disease. Acute post-dose elevations in 
mean hsCRP levels were observed after the first exposure to inotersen (~20x of mean baseline value) 
and decreased from Week 5 on to placebo levels. During CS3, post-baseline abnormality frequencies 
were similar in both treatment groups and similar to results from the placebo group in CS2 (each 
around 50%).  
Immunological alterations are depicted by elevated IgG and IgM more pronounced in subjects on 
inotersen versus placebo.  
Other findings 
Vital signs recorded in CS2 were not significantly different between inotersen and placebo. A 
significant effect of inotersen on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (reduction) was noted within the 
first 15 days of exposure in study CS2. This effect is attributed to the loading scheme that has been 
applied for the first week of treatment (a total of three doses) and further supported by a number of 
TEAEs consistent with hypotension within the first 15 days of inotersen. For the remainder of the 
studies, no significant differences were noted for either treatment group. Omitting the loading dose is 
not thought to compromise long-term efficacy (supported by popPK modelling data; see also section 
2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics). 
Weight decreased was generally more pronounced in subjects on placebo in line with disease 
progression in this group. However, the “protective” effect of inotersen seems to diminish with ongoing 
treatment in CS3.  
QTcF: Inotersen did not interfere with Ikr- and hERG- currents up to the highest concentration of 300 
µM and did not significantly prolong the QTc-interval or affect other cardiovascular (arterial blood 
pressure, heart rate, ECG) parameters in preclinical studies (see NC AR). Hence, no thorough QT/QTc 
study was performed and only ECG data from the clinical development program are available. 14 (4)

subjects on inotersen had a shift to >500 msec and/or QTcF of >60 msec in CS2. It could be clarified 
that 15 of 18 subjects had a pacer placement, for which QTc stopping rules can be disregarded. In the 
remaining 3 subjects, alternative explanations for reaching stopping criteria were mentioned. 
In regard to C-SSRS evaluation, results in CS2 are clearly in favour of inotersen compared to placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender: the only PT that was found notably more pronounced in female compared to male subjects in 
all treatment groups was urinary tract infection. There was no consistent preponderance of one SOC or 
PT over another in CS2 and CS3 that would change the assessment of overall safety concerns.  
Age effects in the inotersen group in CS2 (disadvantaging subjects ≥ 65 y) were more pronounced for 
the cardiac disorders SOC, Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders SOC, chills, and platelet 
count decreased. These effects were not seen in the placebo group. Results from CS3 data and the 
longitudinal safety set contributed to the observations for the cardiac disorders SOC in CS2. The extent 
to which inotersen increases the risk for additional or worsening of pre-existing cardiac disorders over 
time especially in subjects >65 years of age, is not clear. An age effect was observed for platelet count 
decreased and discussed in relation to the identified risk for thrombocytopenia. In addition, Arnold et 
al. 2015 pointed towards an increased risk for severe bleedings not only predicted by platelet counts of 
10 – 20 x 109/L, but also age. As a result, a warning in regard to age over 60 being a risk factor for 
bleedings has been implemented in SmPC section 4.4 and mentioned in 4.2 in conjunction with the 
monitoring and treatment recommendations for platelet count. The finding is in line with the results in 
special population by age. Tabulated adverse events (see table below) in various age groups were 
provided by the applicant upon request and were found in line with the anticipated age effects already 
noted: i.e. a nearly 3-times higher incidence of TEAEs from the Cardiac disorders SOC in subjects aged 
65 and older compared to those aged <65. In addition, also based on limited data, renal investigations 
were more pronounced in older subjects, finding which is considered biologically plausible.

Note 1: Safety analysis based on data collected from the first dose of ISIS 420915 until the patient's last contact date 
within CS2 or CS3. CS2 data from 'Placebo (CS2) and ISIS 420915 300mg (CS3)' group is not summarized. 
Note 2: For each treatment, a patient is counted only once within each category or subcategory. 
Note 3: Adverse events were coded using MedDRA version 19.1. 
[1] AE appearing more frequently (>=10%) in older patients were included in this table by system organ class and 
preferred term. For each treatment, a patient is counted only once within each system organ class or preferred term. 
No additional safety concerns arose for subjects with hATTR-CM compared to those with hATTR-PN.  
Mean eGFR in inotersen-treated subjects was notably lower in subjects on inotersen with the V30M TTR 
mutation compared to inotersen-treated subjects with other mutations. In contrast, subjects with the 
V30M TRR mutation who were on placebo in CS2 had higher eGFR compared to subjects with other 
mutations. If – as hypothesised by the Applicant – subjects with V30M mutation are affected by a 
higher incidence of renal amyloidosis, eGFR would need to be similarly reduced in placebo- and 
inotersen-treated V30M subjects. It is therefore assumed that the type of mutation is not causative for 
the differences in eGFR in inotersen- and placebo-treated subjects. 
The influence of extrinsic factors on the safety of inotersen was determined. 
Several regional imbalances were found. However, the European subgroup did not display a higher 
number of TEAEs in any subgroup as compared to the other regions. In CS3, a strikingly higher 
number of subjects from North America had TEAEs from the cardiac disorders SOC compared to 
European patients. It is not clear, if this is due to regional differences in disease mutations or overall 
regional incidence of cardiac – related events. Notable differences in the occurrence of TEAEs by 
previous treatment (diflunisal or tafamidis) were found for the renal and urinary disorders SOC: 
more subjects on inotersen than placebo had TEAEs while not receiving prior treatment with these 
substances. More subjects with prior diflunisal or tafamidis treatment reported eye disorders TEAEs

with inotersen. In CS3, eye disorders TEAEs were also more pronounced in subjects previously treated 
with diflunisal or tafamidis while in the placebo-inotersen group (i.e. during the first exposure with 
inotersen), the relevance of this finding being unclear. 
Immunological events 
Anti-drug antibodies were detected in 30% of inotersen- treated patients in CS2. Testing was 
performed on study Day 1, Day 28, Day 85, Day 197, Day 323 and Day 449 (Week 65). In the 6-
months Post Treatment Evaluation Period of 6 months (for patients who did not enter the open-label 
extension study CS3), immunogenicity assessments were performed at Day 491 (Week 71), Day 631 
(Week 91) and upon Early Termination. These time points are considered relevant. Titers were 
persistent in most of the subjects tested positive for ADAs. ADAs were first reported at week 13 (Day 
85) but median onset was not before 202 days, and median time to reach peak titer was after another 
100 days of onset. Median peak antibody titers were rather low (300) but there were single patients 
with high ADA titers of 102 000 (three female patients). For the first two patients, the peak titer was 
reached before the last sampling time point and no potential immunogenicity-related AEs were 
reported. The last patient permanently discontinued study drug at Day 114 due to Hypersensitivity. A 
MedDRA “hypersensitivity” SMQ has been provided as summary of AEs potentially related to 
complement activation. There was no apparent association between low ADA titer vs. high ADA titer 
(lower 50-percentile vs. upper 50-percentile) with respect to TEAEs potentially related to complement 
activation, using the MedDRA “hypersensitivity” SMQ. In general, hypersensitivity PTs were slightly 
more frequent in the ADA positive subjects, particularly those related to local reactions of the injection 
site. Data related to complement factor C3 are limited. There was one inotersen-treated IM positive 
patient with decreased C3 reported as a TEAE. Overall the data available do not suggest a relationship 
between immunogenicity and C3 status.  
Median titers increased up to Day 197 (Week 29; median titer 1600) during treatment and decreased 
thereafter by Day 449 (Week 65; median titer 200). Increased ADA titers were observed during the 
Post - Treatment Evaluation Period in single patients. The Applicant was requested to provide all data 
currently available on post-treatment immunogenicity, and to discuss critically whether this finding 
could be attributed to long-term stimulation of antibody production or to poor drug tolerance of the 
assay with ADAs becoming detectable only after drug levels have reached zero. However, no new data 
related to post-treatment immunogenicity is available. Drug tolerance of the ADA assay is acceptable, 
and no further conclusions can currently be drawn before more data from study CS3 becomes 
available. 
TEAEs were analysed for subjects with and without ADA antibodies and generally found similar, 
including AESIs of thrombocytopenia (the sum of thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) and 
renal impairment (23.5% vs. 24.7% and 17.6% vs. 22.1%). Ocular AEs potentially related to vitamin 
A deficiency and flu-like symptoms were reported more frequently in ADA positive subjects. The clinical 
implications are not clear. Immunogenicity status in CS2 did not negatively affect severity or 
discontinuations due to TEAEs.  
Almost 50% of patients continuously treated with inotersen in CS3 were positive for anti-drug 
antibodies compared to 25% of subjects, who received inotersen as early as in CS3 (placebo-
inotersen) and titers were mostly persistent. The latter is in line with inotersen immunogenicity status 
in CS2. The longer subjects are exposed to inotersen (inotersen-inotersen group), the more ADA 
formation is to be expected. The first positive ADA assessment was reported at an earlier time point 
for subjects from the inotersen-inotersen group (week 13) as compared to those from the placebo-
inotersen group (Week 26). The latter onset is not in line with the results for inotersen in CS2, where 
ADAs were found as early as by Week 13. The difference between studies CS2 and CS3 is probably not 
a true difference in ADA onset but rather a consequence of the limited sample size of placebo-

Page 108/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inotersen subjects in CS3. In addition, the loading dose regimen might have contributed to some of the 
subjects from CS2 having an early onset of ADA formation. Of note, all positive IM samples observed 
at Week 7 during CS3 are from subjects who received inotersen treatments for 15 months in CS2, 
while the earliest onset for placebo-inotersen – treated subjects in CS3 was at Week 26. In Study CS3, 
inotersen-inotersen treated subjects received inotersen treatment 15 months longer than placebo-
inotersen treated subjects, leading to longer median onset of ADA formation. While placebo-inotersen 
subjects showed higher median peak titer, inotersen-inotersen subjects have a much wider range of 
different titers over all. With the overall small sample size of placebo-inotersen subjects and high 
variability of titers, differences between groups are difficult to interpret but overall the groups are 
probably comparable. In addition, the immunogenicity observed may be associated with slight re-
increase in mean and median TTR levels between Weeks 52 and 117 in the IM-positive inotersen-
inotersen group as well as hypersensitivity-type TEAEs including local cutaneous reactions at the 
injection site (LCRIS). Thorough analysis and discussion of efficacy and safety of inotersen based on 
immunogenicity status, taking into account all data available up to Day 91 of this procedure, revealed 
no significant differences in IM positive and IM negative subjects regarding efficacy.  With regard to 
safety by immunogenicity status, there were no clinically relevant differences in the overall incidence, 
severity or seriousness of the AEs between the groups, while injection site – related events, including 
LCRIS, as well as flu-like symptoms occurred more frequently in the ADA-positive subjects. These 
symptoms may be a marker for subjects who are more likely to develop ADAs, as generally symptoms 
occurred early in treatment (e.g. ISRs were frequently reported within the first 6 months) and did not 
lead to treatment discontinuation, while ADAs were reported rather late (onset between Days 200 and 
250 based on Studies C2 and C3). Immunogenicity and symptoms potentially related to 
hypersensitivity in ADA-positive patients, in particular reactions at the injection site, will be monitored 
as part of routine pharmacovigilance. SmPC Section 4.8 reflects that more reactions at the 
administration site were reported in subjects with anti-drug antibodies. 
Some imbalances in the occurrence of TEAEs and affected SOCs as well as for the AESIs and OAEIs 
were noted in CS3, especially in the placebo-inotersen group, while no such imbalances were observed 
in the inotersen group in CS2. However, the number of ADA-positive subjects in the placebo-inotersen 
group is rather small hampering any firm conclusion on potential differences. Platelet decreases of 
≥30% and ≥50% from baseline in CS3 were more frequently experienced by ADA positive subjects in 
both treatment groups. In line with what it is expected from AON treatment, i.e. induction of 
inflammatory processes, injection site reactions (and subsequently LCRIS) as well as potential 
complement activation were more frequently reported in ADA-positive subjects in both treatment 
groups. Long-term safety consequences remain unknown. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted by the Applicant. The CHMP considers 
that such studies are not required. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations from study drug due to TEAEs mainly occurred in CS2 and were reported in a higher 
number of subjects on inotersen versus placebo (14.3% vs. 3.3%). No specific TEAEs were involved in 
these numbers. The only TEAEs mentioned in n=2 subjects were thrombocytopenia and cachexia with 
the latter being fatal in both subjects. Cachexia is a known complication of the underlying disease. 
However, no subject on placebo was affected. Two subjects had TEAEs leading to discontinuation from 
the renal and urinary disorders SOC (acute renal injury/ glomerulonephritis).

In CS3 up to the updated data cut-off 15th September 2017, 10 subjects (7.5%) discontinued the 
study due to a TEAEs with 8 of them (9.4%) assigned to the inotersen-inotersen group (4.1% placebo-
inotersen). Most discontinuations in the inotersen-inotersen group occurred due to TEAEs from the 
Cardiac disorder SOC (4 patients), Infections and infestations SOC (2 patients), and the Nervous 
System Disorders SOC (2 patients). Other AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment in CS2 and CS3 
occurred without specific pattern. 
Discontinuations due to AEs of thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased in the longitudinal 
safety set were the main reasons for stopping inotersen treatment (4.5%). 
Post marketing experience 
N/A 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
hATTR (presenting as hATTR-PN and/or hATTR-CM) is a rare disease with certain geographic clusters 
described in Portugal, Japan, and Sweden with approximately 10 – 15,000 afflicted patients worldwide 
(Hawkins et al. 2015). For this reason, the size of the presented safety database for inotersen is 
generally considered adequate at the time of marketing authorisation.  
The main safety set to inform the SmPC derives from study CS2. 
112 subjects received at least one dose of inotersen (300 mg once weekly) and 60 subjects were 
treated with placebo (2:1) in CS2. Up to the latest data cut-off date for interim analysis (15th 
September 2017), a total of 134 subjects from CS2 were exposed to inotersen during CS3 (49 subjects 
previously treated with placebo and 85 subjects previously treated with inotersen). 112 (69.6%) and 
69 (42.9%) patients had at least 1 year and 2 years of inotersen exposure based on the total inotersen 
treated set.  
Differences between treatment groups were noted in the overall exposure that derive from 
discontinuations and dose pauses with inotersen that were to a high extent due to subjects 
reaching stopping rules or TEAEs. Study completion rate for CS2 was higher in subjects on placebo 
(87% vs. 77%). Discontinuation rates in CS2 were almost twice as high for subjects on inotersen 
compared to placebo – treated subjects (23% vs. 13.3%), most of all due to AEs or SAEs (14.2% 
inotersen vs. 1.7% placebo) including pre-defined AESIs.  
Overall, general observations in exposure and (S)AEs in CS3 are in support of more pronounced effects 
on tolerability early in treatment with inotersen, while it cannot be excluded from the available data 
that safety issues also translate into long-term effects.  
Demographics of subjects in CS2 were found in accordance with the disease to be treated. Compared 
to the CS2 safety set, the patients included and evaluated in the CM-ECHO set (with cardiomyopathy) 
were slightly older and fewer had V30M mutations as per stratification. More subjects on inotersen 
qualified for inclusion in this subset compared to placebo (66.4% vs. 55%), since they were more 
affected by autonomic neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. 
Nearly all subjects in both treatment groups in CS2 reported TEAEs while 91% of subjects in CS3 did 
so. Disproportionality in the number of events in CS2 between treatment groups might be a 
consequence of more subjects on inotersen having had more frequent occurrence of one and the same 
event. A majority of TEAEs were AESIs in the inotersen group but not in the placebo group in CS2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 110/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Common adverse events in study CS2 on PT level were either in line with AON – specific safety 
issues (e.g. injection site reactions, constitutional symptoms, thrombocytopenia or platelet count 
decreased, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms) or in line with ongoing underlying disease and 
increased autonomic neuropathy or cardiac involvement (e.g. oedema, anaemia, cachexia, orthostatic 
hypotension). Progressing autonomic neuropathy was attributed to inotersen-treated subjects rather 
than placebo-treated subjects due to baseline imbalances. Most of the events had their peak incidence 
within the first 6 months of treatment, were reported less frequently 6 to 12 months after treatment 
initiation and again more frequently in months 12 to 24, likely as a consequence of transitioning 
subjects from placebo to inotersen in CS3.  
Currently, no impact of inotersen on an overlap of TEAEs in different organ system (cardiac, vascular, 
and renal system) could be identified when compared with placebo. Nevertheless, it cannot be 
excluded that treatment with inotersen was associated with cardiac AEs on the one hand and renal AEs 
on the other hand.  
Types of TEAEs reported in CS3 were similar to CS2. The incidence in the placebo-inotersen group was 
well in line with incidences seen in the inotersen arm during CS2 due to a higher susceptibility to 
inotersen given for the first time or in line with disease progression (e.g. TEAEs of falls and fractures in 
subjects treated with placebo during CS2). The overall frequency of TEAEs was lower for most SOCs. 
Data from the longitudinal safety set and the inotersen integrated set were found in overall accordance 
with data from the single studies, although long-term data are limited.  
Severity of TEAEs was in a majority of subjects/events rated as mild or moderate for inotersen but 
severe AEs were more frequently reported with inotersen (28% vs. 22%), including events that were 
attributed to more diseased inotersen-subjects at baseline. 
Most of the TEAEs observed in CS2 (and CS3) were drug-related (for inotersen but not for placebo; 
77.7% vs. 38.3%). 
An imbalance in deaths was found in the clinical program with 10 deaths reported in subjects on 
inotersen compared to none in subjects on placebo or placebo-inotersen. Five of these deaths occurred 
in the placebo-controlled study (CS2) and another five in the uncontrolled single-arm extension study 
CS3. Cause of death was cachexia in two subjects, cardiac failure congestive in two subjects, cardiac 
failure, intestinal perforation, cardiac failure acute/bacteriaemia/septic shock (CS3), neuropathy 
peripheral (CS3), endocarditis (CS3) and intracranial haemorrhage (CS2) in one subject each. The 
latter happened as a consequence of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and is considered the only death 
related to inotersen while the other cases point towards progression or complication of the underlying 
disease. Baseline imbalances in disease severity favouring placebo may have, at least partly, 
contributed to the excess mortality observed on inotersen. 
SAEs were found to be in accordance with AESI /OESI as defined by the Applicant (renal SAEs and 
thrombocytopenia), but also included safety issues related to the underlying disease in single subjects. 
Longer exposure to inotersen in CS3 does not seem to increase the incidence of SAEs.  
The relevant safety concerns for inotersen deriving from the dossier pertain to the following AESI: 
  Ocular adverse events potentially related to vitamin A. There is currently no evidence for 
an increased risk for Ocular adverse events potentially related to vitamin A as a consequence of 
inotersen’s mode of action causing Vitamin A deficiency. Laboratory values for vitamin A but not for 
retinyl palmitate were reduced in almost every subject on inotersen during CS2 and CS3. While retinyl 
palmitate levels in chylomicrons without substitution are unknown, data from the placebo arm in study 
CS2 did not show an increased incidence of AEs that could be attributed to 3000 IU per day of vitamin

A. This is an indirect reassurance (also based on scientific literature) that the supplemented dose is 
safe. In regard to an anticipated risk for hypovitaminosis in pregnancy balanced against the risk of 
foetal harm deriving from an oversupply of vitamin A, section 4.4 of the SmPC recommends that for 
planned pregnancies vitamin A supplementation should be discontinued prior and during the pregnancy 
along with inotersen the treatment while in case of unplanned pregnancies no definitive 
recommendation can be given whether to continue or discontinue vitamin A supplementation during 
the first trimester.  
Occurrence of severe thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was defined an AESI for inotersen. No 
consistent effect on platelets was seen in the Phase 1 study with multiple dosing. Only one TEAE was 
reported in a placebo-treated subject while affecting 27 of 112 subjects (24.1%) on inotersen in CS2. 
The occurrence of severe thrombocytopenia represents the most important safety concern related to 
inotersen treatment. One subject died due to intracranial haemorrhage as a consequence of Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia with a platelet nadir of <10 x 109/L occurring within four weeks from a normal 
value (the normal value was based on estimation from a smear test). In CS3, a higher proportion of 
subjects in the placebo-inotersen group reported AESIs of thrombocytopenia than subjects in the 
inotersen-inotersen group during the on-study period (26.5% vs. 14.1%). Four subjects discontinued 
study due to thrombocytopenia (including the death case) in CS2 and 2 subjects in CS3 (5.4% of all 
subjects from the longitudinal safety set). Thrombocytopenia events Grade 4 according to CTCAE 
criteria affected 3 of 112 subjects (2.7%) on inotersen in CS2 (one additional subject remained 
unconfirmed for Grade 4 thrombocytopenia). Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs in these subjects were 
observed within the first six months of treatment (i.e. Week 8 – Week 20). During CS3, clinical 
narrative descriptions revealed five additional subjects with decreased platelet counts in line with 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia all of which were reported between Week 77 and 151 of 
treatment). Some of the subjects with Grade 3 or 4 events had concomitant haemorrhages (e.g. 
menorrhagia, haematomas, gingival bleeding, bruising, ecchymosis, periorbital haemorrhage, scleral 
haemorrhage, haematuria, and intracranial haemorrhage). In one subject (CS3), narrative description 
could not fully rule out possible punctate left frontal lobe corona radiata intraparenchymal 
haemorrhage. A total of 8 of 112 patients from the longitudinal safety set (i.e. 7.1%) had Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia. At least two different mechanisms seem to be involved, one of which leads to a 
gradual decline in platelets shortly after treatment initiation. Within three and six months of treatment, 
mean platelet counts in the inotersen group decreased by 20% and 24% from baseline and by 26% 
from baseline at week 65 (EOT). Further decrease in platelets is evident from CS3 data (e.g. CS3 Week 
39: mean platelet counts reduced by 28.5% from CS2 baseline). The other potential mechanism 
leading to a sudden and severe decline in platelets is considered to be immunologically–mediated. 
Treatment-emergent antiplatelet antibodies (IgG and IgM) and anti-PF4 antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) 
were seen in subjects receiving inotersen (~29% of inotersen-treated in CS2 and >53% of subjects in 
CS3 [where all subjects received inotersen]) and to a significantly lower extent in subjects receiving 
placebo (~6% in CS2). All subjects with severe thrombocytopenia (Grade 3/4) had confirmed anti-
platelet antibody formation (in two subjects with Grade 4 thrombocytopenia antibodies against platelet 
surface glycoproteins were detected). Interpretation is hampered by the fact that not all subjects with 
anti-platelet antibodies experienced severe thrombocytopenia and that some subjects also had positive 
anti-platelet antibodies at baseline. Baseline monitoring is therefore not considered predictive for 
severe post-baseline platelet decreases and not further pursued as a risk minimisation measure. 
Nevertheless, there is evidence for a correlation of severe thrombocytopenia and the magnitude of 
antibody formation, i.e. a steeper decline in platelets is noted in subjects with more than one 
antiplatelet antibody species (the lowest platelet counts were found in subjects with antiplatelet IgG 
antibodies and concomitant formation of antibodies against platelet surface glycoproteins). To 
conclude, implementation of antiplatelet antibody testing in a routine setting is hampered by a lack of

sensitivity and specificity of the applied indirect testing systems and the need for specialised 
laboratories for direct testing. 
Platelet abnormalities by CTCAE cut-offs showed consistent effects of inotersen on platelet counts.  
Thrombocytopenic states were prolonged in subjects from the inotersen-inotersen group in CS3 
compared to inotersen-treated subjects in CS2. Treatment interruption/dose pauses (in 10% of 
subjects with platelets <75 x 109/L in CS2 and in 13.4% of subjects in CS3), dose reduction or 
corticoid administration led to recovery of thrombocytes in a number of subjects but continuation with 
inotersen was subsequently associated with recurring thrombocytopenic states needing further 
interruptions. It appears that, based on comparable treatment duration, ADA development was 
increased in patients with treatment interruptions compared to those without interruption. Therefore, 
frequent dose pauses might trigger immunological reactions.  
Additional analyses for baseline platelet counts to predict a certain pattern of platelet decreases over 
time to inform monitoring algorithm have to be interpreted with caution and various exceptions were 
noted from theoretical calculations (i.e. subjects presenting with unpredictable steep decreases in short 
time intervals irrespective of baseline or prior platelet counts). The risk minimisation measures that 
have evolved during this procedure and delineated in the SmPC are now considered sufficient to 
prevent severe thrombocytopenia events. An additional monitoring step has been included in the 
monitoring and treatment recommendations for platelet count contained in the SmPC for subjects with 
a platelet count of <50x109/L. For them, more frequent monitoring of platelets should be considered 
based on the existence of additional risk factors for bleeding (that might include ‘age’, anticoagulant or 
antiplatelet medication, or prior history of major bleeding events). The same platelet threshold and risk 
factors should be taken into account in order for the prescriber to decide on case by case basis on 
initiating the treatment with corticosteroids. 
Analyses of haemorrhages (MedDRA query; OESI) in a low number of subjects revealed no obvious 
overall difference between inotersen and placebo. Similarly, analyses per platelet categories in 
inotersen-treated subjects with concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs showed no increased 
risk for bleeding events.  
  Renal abnormalities are a known class effect of antisense oligonucleotides due to their 
accumulation in the proximal tubules of the kidneys. The incidence of renal impairment was higher for 
subjects on inotersen vs. placebo during CS2 (20.5% vs. 10%) mainly including TEAEs of proteinuria, 
eGFR decreased, renal impairment, acute kidney injury, and renal failure. Severe and serious TEAEs 
were nearly exclusively reported for subjects on inotersen during CS2. At least two subjects who died 
during CS2 were reported to have experienced a loss in renal function prior to death, for which a 
contribution of inotersen could sufficiently be ruled out. Inotersen was found to be (possibly) related to 
four cases of glomerulonephritis (two of which led to discontinuation, amongst them one subject who 
turned to end stage renal disease; a new case of chronic glomerulonephritis was reported in CS3 in a 
subject on inotersen-inotersen). Glomerulonephritis is indicated as an identified risk in the RMP. All 
subjects with confirmed glomerulonephritis in CS2 had significant proteinuria prior to the onset of the 
events and two subjects had a significant decrease in eGFR. All of these cases did not emerge before 
approximately 3 months of treatment. The complexity of findings in the aforementioned subjects 
argues for coexistence of renal amyloid deposits that derive from the underlying disease in addition to 
concomitant drug-induced alteration of the immune system. Renal impairment TEAEs in CS3 were not 
found to increase over those in CS2. Chemistry (serum creatinine, BUN) and urinalysis data are in 
support of the clinical findings. The mechanism of renal function loss is unclear, while it seems possible 
that tubular dysfunction and tubular accumulation of inotersen is involved. Shifts to worse CKD stages 
were in support of these findings. Renal parameters abnormalities were found more pronounced in 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 113/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects on inotersen compared to placebo. Numerous dose interruptions were necessary in subjects 
with renal function impairment. Routine monitoring is considered to capture renal impairment seen in 
the clinical program, while renal function decline also occurred in subjects without glomerulonephritis. 
Based on available data, for subjects with an eGFR of <45 ml/min/1.73m2 treatment with inotersen 
(section 4.3) is contraindicated and subjects with a decline in eGFR of >30% during treatment need to 
interrupt inotersen for further evaluation of the cause followed by resumption of dosing after 
improvement of their renal function. Monitoring interval of renal function is set to every 3 month in 
patients with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73m2 and to every 4 weeks in patients with eGFR <60 
ml/min/1.73m2. 
Coagulation abnormalities as pre-defined by the Applicant (coagulation parameters, e.g. aPTT, INR, 
PT) did not constitute a safety issue in either study with similar incidences of respective TEAEs in 
subjects on inotersen and placebo. However, a broader view on coagulation abnormalities by including 
thrombotic events revealed SAEs of embolic stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (in 
CS2 and CS3), and Mesenteric artery occlusion that might be a consequence of inflammatory lesions 
caused by AON treatment. No increased incidence could be seen in subjects on inotersen vs. placebo.  
Hepatic abnormalities (mainly based on liver transaminase increases of ALT and/or AST relative to 
baseline) were found double as high for inotersen compared to placebo. Laboratory parameters 
revealed slight increases in both, ALT and AST, from baseline to Week 18 up to 32 and 31 U/L for 
inotersen but not for placebo. The totality of liver function parameters did not raise serious concerns 
on liver toxicity. However, the observed changes up to Week 18 justify liver monitoring prior to 
inotersen treatment initiation and testing after 4 months followed by yearly measurement thereafter. 
This recommendation for monitoring of hepatic function is properly reflected in the SmPC.  
Mild to moderate injection site reactions (not serious) were reported frequently in subjects on 
inotersen compared to placebo (51% vs. 12%) during CS2 and less during CS3. Frequent 
presentations of ISRs were (in decreasing order) injection site erythema, injection site pain and 
injection site pruritus and found to be ameliorated by injection site rotation.  
Constitutional (pyrexia, flu-like symptoms) as well as CNS symptoms (headache, paraesthesia, 
syncope) were found higher in subjects on inotersen versus placebo but safety was not significantly 
influenced by these events. 
Complement activation is discussed with antisense oligonucleotides (Chi et al. 2017). Although 
baseline C3 was reduced in some of the patients, post-baseline Complement C3 below LLN was more 
frequently reported in subjects on inotersen (55% vs. 21%). In CS1 (healthy volunteers), results from 
split product measurements are considered to be in line with normal biological variation and acute 
phase response to inotersen. Complement split product measurement was conducted infrequently in 
CS2 and CS3 and from the paucity of data, no specific pattern could be determined that could attribute 
specific TEAEs to these values.  
Although inotersen’s mechanism might theoretically lead to hypothyroid states (15% of thyroxine is 
transported by means of TTR), no increased rate in TEAEs based on reduced thyroxine was noted in 
the clinical program. Thyroxine post-baseline values below LLN were more frequently observed in 
subjects on inotersen compared to placebo. However, thyreotropin remained unchanged during CS2 
while more subjects on inotersen-inotersen were affected by thyreotropin levels >ULN in CS3 
compared to subjects on placebo-inotersen. The clinical relevance cannot be judged based on these 
data. The overall risk for post - baseline low thyroxine levels is comparable for males and females.

Several laboratory findings were identified: serum albumin in subjects on inotersen was parallel 
translated to lower levels relative to those on placebo. This might be a consequence of the more 
pronounced autonomic neuropathy in the inotersen group. However, the difference between inotersen-
inotersen and placebo-inotersen during CS3 in post-baseline serum albumin <LLN was more than 
double at the expense of continuous inotersen treatment, which might also point towards an additional 
effect on pre-renal impairment by inotersen. Mean hsCRP was >ULN at baseline in both groups and 
acute post-dose elevations were observed after the first exposure to inotersen (~20x of mean baseline 
value) and decreased from Week 5 on to placebo levels. 
Single presentations of inotersen-treated subjects with critically QTcF values (shifts to >500msec or 
increases from baseline >60msec) but these happened in a majority of subjects after pacer placement 
and are hence not meaningful. 
There is no clear impact of the formation and persistence of anti-drug antibodies in 30% of 
patients treated with inotersen in study CS2 on TEAEs. A majority of ADAs emerged at later time 
points (median onset not before 202 days). Inotersen plasma trough concentrations were found to be 
higher in subjects tested ADA positive compared to ADA negative subjects (see PK part of the clinical 
AR) leading to the conclusion that subjects with ADAs have higher accumulation in tissue compared to 
ADA negative subjects. Hypersensitivity PTs related to local reactions of the injection site were slightly 
more frequent in the ADA positive subjects but no apparent association between low or high ADA titers 
to TEAEs potentially related to complement activation could be retrieved.  
With continuous inotersen treatment in CS3, incidences of ADA positive results increased to 50% (25% 
of subjects in the placebo-inotersen group). First time points of ADA positivity were different in CS2 
(earlier) and CS3 (later for subjects on placebo-inotersen) but considered either a consequence of the 
small sample size of placebo-inotersen subjects in CS3 or of the loading dose regimen employed in 
CS2.  
No specific safety issues in subjects being ADA positive were noted except for platelet decreases of 
≥ 30% and ≥ 50% from baseline in ADA-positive subjects as in ADA-negative subjects in both groups 
in CS3 supporting the hypothesis of an immunologically-mediated process. Long-term effects of anti-
drug antibody formation probably resulting in activation of the complement system are unknown. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database at present seems adequately sized to allow the evaluation of clinical safety in 
patients receiving inotersen for the first year, i.e. based on safety data from completed CS2 study (65 
Weeks). However, limitations in integrated safety evaluation pertain to a high amount of patients 
(more than 50%) having had one or more dose pauses during treatment. These interruptions might 
under-estimate severity and persistence of relevant TEAEs. Long-term exposure at this time refers to 
ongoing data collection in open-label study CS3 with approximately half of the study patients being 
treated with inotersen for 2 years, while the maximum exposure to inotersen to date is 4.36 years in 
two subjects The new interim safety data cut-off of 15th September 2017 added additional 24 months 
data on inotersen from 11 subjects. As an additional pharmacovigilance activity the Applicant agreed 
to set up a product registry in order to collect additional safety data meant to overcome limitations in 
the data presented and to adequately react in case of a worsening of the safety profile of inotersen. 
These data will comprise prospective assessment of platelet count decreases, acute renal failure 
including glomerulonephritis, ocular toxicities due to vitamin A deficiency, discontinuations during 
treatment including follow-up of patients after discontinuation, SAEs, dose reductions, and treatment

pauses. 
Overall, the CHMP considers that the safety profile of inotersen is sufficiently documented and 
appropriate risk minimisation measures (requirements for initiating inotersen treatment, monitoring 
rules, and stopping criteria) are in place in order to manage the identified and potential risks related to 
inotersen treatment.

the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation.  
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of inotersen with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers inotersen to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tegsedi (inotersen) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

aggregate to insoluble, extracellular amyloid fibril deposits resulting in cellular degeneration and death. 
Accumulation of amyloid deposits in multiple organ systems, particularly the nervous system, 
gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and heart, is causing a range of disease manifestations including but not 
limited to progressive polyneuropathy, which includes sensorimotor neuropathy and autonomic 
neuropathy. 
Amyloidosis is the general term used to refer to the extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils composed 
of low molecular weight subunits of a variety of proteins, many of which circulate as constituents of 
plasma. The condition of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is classified as a rare genetic disease by 
ORPHANET. 
Hereditary ATTR is a multisystemic disorder with diagnostic challenges [Gertz 2017 and Parmana, 
Adams, Obici et al., 2016]. It has been reported that Neuropathy of TTR-FAP is typically a slowly 
progressive polyneuropathy, walking difficulties requiring aid occur after a delay of 6 years (stage 2) 
and confinement to wheelchair (stage 3) at 10 years. Late-onset Val30MetTTR-FAP is more severe and 
progresses twice as fast as early-onset presentation. The mean delay to reach stage 2 is only 2.6 
years, and to reach stage 3, 3.8 years. In other variants of TTR, 60 % of patients reach stage 3 in a 
delay of 4.6 years. Life expectancy is reduced to 7.3 years. Unusually rapid decline in neurologic 
deficits has been reported in Ala97Ser TTR-FAP patients [Adams D, Théaudin M, Cauquil C, et al., 
2014]. The staging system used to classify severity of disease in subjects being considered for 
enrolment in the pivotal study of inotersen (ISIS 420915-CS2 [CS2]) was the following: Stage 1 does 
not require assistance with ambulation; Stage 2 requires assistance with ambulation; and Stage 3 is 
wheelchair bound. Subjects with Stage 1 and Stage 2 hATTR-PN and an NIS ≥ 10 and ≤ 130 have been 
recruited in CS2, whilst patients with disease stage 3 have not been included. However, more recent 
publications are considering the disease a spectrum.  
While patients with hATTR  may present predominantly with either polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy 
manifestations, most patients with hATTR  manifest signs and symptoms of both polyneuropathy and 
cardiomyopathy over the course of their disease and reference is made to one hereditary disease with 
a spectrum of clinical manifestations rather than attempt to classify the disease into two distinct 
syndromes [Swiecicki PL, Zhen DB, Mauermann ML et al. 2015].  
Furthermore, in support of the approach of a spectrum of the disease, hATTR with polyneuropathy 
(hATTR-PN) has been reported to progress quickly following the onset of symptoms, with a rapid 
increase in Neuropathy Impairment Score [Hawkins P.N., Ando Y., Dispenzeri A. et al., 2015]. Several 
factors can affect the rate of neuropathy progression such as TTR genotype, age at symptom onset, 
and extent of neurologic impairment and in many patients neuropathy progression is relatively rapid 
[Adams D, Coelho T, Obici L, et al. 2015 and Berk J, Suhr O, Obici L, et al. 2013]. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatments for hATTR-PN include orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) or pharmacotherapy 
with Vyndaqel (tafamidis) or diflunisal. Orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) serves as an established 
option for patients with early-stage disease that allows suppression of the main source of variant TTR. 
However, large numbers of patients are not suitable transplant candidates (Sekijima, 2015,). The rate 
of success for this treatment can be from 0 to 100%, since this method cannot guarantee a cure for 
the underlying disease.  
Tafamidis is a small molecule protein stabilizer of the mutant TTR tetramer [Adams, 2016]. Tafamidis 
is indicated in Europe “for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with Stage 1 
symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurological impairment”.   
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 123/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Diflunisal is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which stabilizes TTR tetramers, thereby 
slowing the rate of amyloidogenesis. Known cardiovascular and renal side effects associated with the 
NSAID drug class may limit the use of diflusinal in an aging hATTR-PN patient population. Diflunisal is 
not approved for the treatment of hATTR-PN; however, off-label use has been reported in patients with 
Stage 1 and Stage 2 disease [Adams, 2016]. 
There is a clear unmet medical need, since there are no approved therapies in the EU for patients with 
Stage 2 and Stage 3 hATTR-PN.  OLT, has notable limitations and later stage patients often are not 
candidates for OLT. In addition, patients have disease progression despite treatment with tafamidis or 
diflunisal. Approximately 55% of the patients in the inotersen pivotal study were treated previously 
with tafamidis or diflunisal. 
Inotersen is a 20-nucleotide antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug targeted to human TTR messenger 
RNA (mRNA). ASOs bind to their target sequence by Watson-Crick base pairing in the same way that 
complementary nucleotides bind within a double stranded helix of DNA. Consequently, to maximize 
binding affinity, ASOs are designed to be 100% complementary to their target mRNA.  Importantly, 
inotersen binds to a region of the TTR mRNA that is free of any reported mutation. The selective 
binding of inotersen to the TTR and messenger RNA (mRNA) causes the degradation of both mutant 
and wild type (normal) TTR mRNA. Degradation of TTR mRNA prevents the synthesis of TTR in the 
liver, resulting in significant reductions in the levels of mutated and wild type TTR protein secreted by 
the liver into the circulation. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety studies are summarised in Table 2 of this report. 
Dose selection was based on the dose-exploration study (CS1) investigating doses from 50 mg to 400 
mg. The maximum effect in TTR reduction was obtained with the 300 mg and 400 mg doses with 
minimal differences between the 300 mg and the 400 mg doses. Therefore, the 300 mg dose was 
taken forward into the phase 2/3 trial. 
The pivotal trial CS2 was a Phase 2/3 multicenter, double-blind, randomized, stratified, 
placebo-controlled study of inotersen in subjects with Stage 1 and Stage 2 hATTR-PN with a 
Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of ≥10 and ≤130. Approximately 135 subjects were planned to be 
randomized 2:1 to 300 mg inotersen or placebo. Approximately 50% Stage 1 and 50% Stage 2 
subjects were planned to be enrolled in the study. No Stage 3 patients were enrolled. 173 patients 
were randomised and 172 patients received at least one dose of inotersen. 
The hypothesis of the pivotal study was that decreasing the amount of liver-derived TTR protein 
circulating in the plasma by treatment with inotersen will result in a decrease in the formation of TTR 
amyloid fibril deposits, and thus slow or halt disease progression (as measured by the mNIS+7) and 
maintain or improve quality of life (as measured by the Norfolk QOL-DN).  
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the change from Baseline to Week 66 in the Modified 
Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) Composite Score and in the Norfolk Quality of Life-
Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL-DN) questionnaire total score.  The mNIS+7 consists of 2 composite 
scores: the NIS composite score and the modified +7 composite score, each of which in turn consists 
of 4 individual components, that measure deficits in the strength of muscles innervated by the cranial 
nerves, muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation of the big toe and index finger. The +7 composite 
score shares the autonomic nerve assessment with the modified +7 (i.e., HRDB) but only includes 
peripheral nerve assessment of the lower limb (nerve conduction tests) and sensory nerve assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 124/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(vibration detection threshold), which is replaced by quantitative sensation testing in the modified +7. 
The composite  score as well as individual components were evaluated. 
The choice of end-points is in line with the CHMP recommendations given in 2012 in a Scientific Advice 
procedure (Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/2286/1/2012/III). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The baseline disease characteristics of the patients in the inotersen group were worse than those for 
the placebo group. However, (a) relatively large effect sizes were observed with regard to the change 
from baseline in mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN for inotersen 300 mg compared to placebo, (b) other 
baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups (i.e. random imbalances are 
covered by the statistical test), and (c) change from baseline was analysed for all endpoints and 
evaluation included a baseline covariate. A subset of patients (n=45 (40%) in the inotersen group and 
22 (36.7%) in the placebo group) were diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) at baseline.  
Changes from Baseline in mNIS+7 composite score showed a statistically significant difference in 
favour of inotersen compared with placebo at both Week 35 and Week 66. The difference in least 
squares means (LSMs) between treatment groups was -8.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -13.49, 
3.90; p=0.0005) at Week 35 and -19.73 (95% CI: -26.43, -13.03; p=0.00000004) at Week 66, 
respectively. Changes from Baseline in Norfolk QoL-DN total score showed a statistically significant 
difference in favour of inotersen compared with placebo at both Week 35 and Week 66. The difference 
in LSMs between treatment groups was -6.14 (95% CI: -11.77, -0.52; p=0.032) at Week 35 and -
11.68 (95% CI: -18.29, -5.06; p<0.0006) at Week 66, respectively. 
The analyses were performed using a Mixed Effects Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM), which was 
not supported by CHMP for providing too optimistic results (for more detailed reasons see section on 
uncertainties of favourable effects below). A high number (thirteen, 13) of predefined sensitivity 
analyses were performed, all supporting the primary efficacy results.  Using sensitivity analysis 6 
(placebo-based multiple imputation),the analyses supported by CHMP, the results at week 66 were 
also statistically significant i.e. for mNIS+7 the difference Inotersen 300 mg– Placebo  was -14.89 
(95% CI: -22.55; -7.22, p<0.001) and for Norfolk QoL-DN the difference Inotersen 300 mg– Placebo  
was -8.56 (95% CI: 15.42; -1.71, p=0.015). 
The results from the primary endpoints are supported by consistent effects in secondary, tertiary and 
exploratory endpoints (either statistically significant or trends in favour of inotersen). The clinical 
relevance is further supported by responder analysis (sensitivity analysis 10). It is notable that 
progression of disease was improved or arrested in 29.2%of patients treated with inotersen as 
evidenced by improvement (negative change) or zero worsening in the mNIS+7 (p<0.081), compared 
to 16.9% for the placebo group. In 39.6% of patients treated with inotersen there was improvement 
(negative change) or zero worsening in the Norfolk QoL-DN (p<0.039), compared to 23.7% for the 
placebo group (based on FAS and calculated by the CHMP). For mNIS+7, statistical significance in 
favour of inotersen treatment was demonstrated at all thresholds beyond a 0-point change (i.e., 
2-point change) and response rates were approximately 2-fold higher for inotersen compared to 
placebo at each threshold tested supporting consistency of results. 
Secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoint analyses as well as subgroup analyses were primarily 
performed using MMRM. In addition, sensitivity analysis 6, which is considered of highest relevance in 
this setting, was performed and the results compared to those of the MMRM analysis. For mNIS+7, all 
the subgroup analyses were statistically significant at Week 66, results which are consistent with the 
MMRM results. For Norfolk QoL-DN certain subgroups, such as females, non-whites, patients older than

65 years, and the regions Europe and North America, did not reach statistical significance, but in 
general results were consistent with MMRM analysis and showed numerically better results for 
inotersen. It was noted that the effect size seems to be larger for stage 2 than for stage 1 patients 
(especially for the mNIS+7).  
The results obtained with the open label extension study CS3 corroborated the results obtained with 
the CS2 study and efficacy was maintained throughout the duration of CS3 (up to interim analysis). 
The effect sizes for the coprimary endpoints were smaller for the inotersen-inotersen group compared 
to the placebo-inotersen group during CS3. However, changes from CS2 Baseline in mNIS+7 
composite score and Norfolk QoL-DN total score showed less progression in the inotersen-inotersen 
group compared with the placebo-inotersen group at CS3 weeks 26, 52, and 78, indicating that 
benefits may be larger when starting treatment earlier in the disease. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary analysis should ideally be based on all randomized subjects. In this case, however, only 
patients with at least one dose and a baseline value and at least one post-baseline assessment for the 
mNIS+7 or the Norfolk QoL-DN questionnaire were included in the FAS, which is the primary analysis 
population. While it can be argued that excluding patients who were not dosed is acceptable since the 
decision is not being influenced by treatment, excluding patients without post-baseline values for both 
endpoints is not acceptable since this could bias the results.  
The primary MMRM analysis has the following deficiencies: (1) an imbalanced number of patients (6 
vs. 1 on inotersen vs. placebo) was excluded from the FAS. (2) An imbalanced number of patients in 
the FAS was excluded from the MMRM analysis. (3) A hypothetical estimand is addressed (effect had 
no patient discontinued treatment) that yields an overoptimistic effect and is less relevant, since AEs 
are the main reason for treatment discontinuation (TD). A treatment policy estimand is considered of 
highest relevance reflecting an overall expected treatment effect irrespective of early treatment 
discontinuation.  
Of the 13 sensitivity analyses No 6 is considered to be the most appropriate, because in the absence of 
data after TD (which is needed to reliably estimate treatment policy) the use of a placebo-based 
multiple imputation addressing the treatment effect as if treatment has no effect after TD, is a 
reasonable assumption to handle missing data. This analysis accounts for the unfavourable effect of 
treatment discontinuation, does not exclude patients from analysis and is proposed to be included in 
the product information as it reflects the most appropriate estimand. Results of this analysis 
(sensitivity analysis 6) are also significant and relevant for both primary endpoint at week 66 with 
point estimates of -14.89 (95% CI: -22.55; -7.22) and -8.56 (95% CI: 15.42; -1.71) for mNIS+7 and 
Norfolk QoL questionnaire, respectively. CHMP considered that the results of this analysis are most 
appropriate to be presented in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Subgroup analyses did not reach statistical significance in all of the subgroups but trends in favor of 
inotersen treatment were observed. However, there was no indication that inotersen would not work in 
any of the subgroups investigated. 
Approximately 40% of subjects had a concomitant diagnosis of hATTR cardiomyopathy (CM) at study 
entry, with a mean duration from diagnosis of 23.7 months. These patients were included in the ECHO-
CM subgroup that underwent evaluation for cardiac effects of inotersen.  
No consistent statistically significant effects of inotersen were observed on selected cardiac parameters 
including left ventricular (LV) size and function including interventricular septum (IVS) thickness, 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 126/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
posterior wall thickness, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, LV mass index, left atrial strain, or E/Em lateral 
ratio. The changes in key ECHO measurements related to cardiac wall thickness (LV mass, 
intraventricular septum thickness, posterior wall thickness) showed an overall decrease at Week 65 
that was numerically greater in the inotersen group compared with the placebo group. 
Further analyses of cardiac wall thickness parameters (LV mass, IVS thickness, and posterior wall 
thickness) were conducted in a subgroup of subjects with more advanced cardiomyopathy, defined as 
a Baseline IVS thickness ≥ 1.5 cm. The placebo subjects showed an increase in cardiac wall thickness 
parameters while the inotersen subjects showed a reduction in wall thickness. The differences in the 
LSM changes from Baseline between the inotersen and placebo groups were statistically significant for 
all 3 parameters. The decrease in cardiac thickness and mass suggest regression of cardiac amyloid.    
Therefore, in a subgroup of the ECHO-CM patients with more advanced cardiac disease, the effects of 
inotersen appeared to be stronger but these very limited data and post-hoc analyses need to be 
interpreted with great caution. 
In addition, CHMP considered that ECHO parameters are not considered sufficient to demonstrate 
clinically relevant efficacy in patients with cardiomyopathy. At least a beneficial effect on functional 
parameters e.g. 6 Minute Walk Test or VO2 max during exercise testing should be demonstrated. 
These parameters were not investigated in CS2 or CS3. The CHMP therefore concluded that efficacy of 
inotersen in the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with hATTR has not been sufficiently 
demonstrated.  
Efficacy of inotersen has also not been demonstrated in patients with stage 3 hATTR polyneuropathy. 
Study CS2 only enrolled patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy and efficacy observed in 
these patients cannot be simply extrapolated to patients with stage 3 disease.  Six patients, who were 
treated with placebo in the study CS2, progressed to disease stage 3 and received inotersen in the 
open label study CS3. An uncontrolled post-hoc analysis suggested that, in four of these six patients, 
the annualised rate of disease progression to be slower after initiation of inotersen treatment. 
However, selection of six placebo patients from CS2 that likely had a more pronounced disease 
progression than other placebo patients who didn’t  progress to stage 3 could have biased the results. 
In addition, 4 out of the 6 patients discontinued the treatment prematurely and the variability of the 
measured endpoints does not allow for extrapolation/annualization of perceived short-term effects.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In long-term toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys, adverse events reported during inotersen 
treatment were mainly attributable to its 2’-MOE phosphorothioate backbone chemistry and to its 
extensive and persistent tissue distribution. These non-specific effects have been previously reported 
for other members of the pharmaceutical class of 2’-MOE ASOs. However, the decreases of platelets 
across animal species in association with increased anti-platelet antibodies, coincide with severe clinical 
TEAEs (see below). Severe thrombocytopenia was noted in two monkeys and resulted in premature 
sacrifice of these animals, because their platelet counts had dropped to even lower levels after 
inotersen administration was resumed following temporary interruption. 
In line with non-clinical findings, inotersen triggered immunological reactions in clinical studies, which 
include, but are not necessarily limited to, haematological changes (thrombocytopenia) and renal 
abnormalities. 30 % of inotersen - treated patients were positive to anti-drug antibodies compared to 
no subject on placebo. Based on provided analyses, incidence or severity of TEAEs appeared not to be 
associated with ADA titers. 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 127/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thrombocytopenia TEAEs including TEAEs of platelet count decreases occurred in 24.1% vs. 1.7% of 
subjects on inotersen and placebo, respectively in CS2 and in 25/134 subjects (18.7%) in CS3. Platelet 
abnormalities below <140 x 109/L (LLN) occurred in 55.4% of inotersen-treated patients compared to 
16.7% of placebo-treated patients in Study CS2. CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia emerged as a 
safety issue at different time points during inotersen treatment and concerned 8 of 112 patients from 
the longitudinal safety set (i.e. 7.1% as of data cut-off 28th February 2017), some of them 
accompanied by bleeding episodes. One subject died due to intracranial haemorrhage as a 
consequence of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Discontinuations due to thrombocytopenia events affected 
5.4% of subjects from the longitudinal safety set. Dose pauses triggered by platelet counts <75 x 
109/L affected 10% of inotersen-treated subjects in CS2 and 13.4% in CS3. Mean reduction in platelets 
from baseline to week 23 and week 65 was 24% and 26%, respectively. Treatment interruption due to 
low platelets lasted 4.5 weeks in CS2 and 8 weeks in CS3. Mean duration of thrombocytopenia was 28 
weeks in CS2 and 41 weeks in CS3 (i.e. patients with confirmed thrombocytopenia remained 
thrombocytopenic with ongoing inotersen exposure). 29% (6%) of subjects on inotersen (placebo) 
developed anti-platelet antibodies during CS2. All subjects with severe thrombocytopenia (i.e. Grade 3 
or 4) had confirmed anti-platelet antibody formation. 
Inotersen-related effects on the kidneys are expected to occur due to its accumulation in this tissue 
and renal excretion, therefore being a target organ of toxicity. Renal impairment was reported by 
20.5% of subjects treated with inotersen and 10% of placebo-treated subjects with the main 
presentations being proteinuria (6.3% vs. 3.3%) and eGFR decreased (5.4% vs. 3.3%). 
Glomerulonephritis (SAE) was reported in a total of 3 subjects (2.7%) in CS2, all of which were rated 
possibly related to inotersen and in one subject on placebo (1.7%), accompanied by significant 
proteinuria and loss of renal function (in two of the three subjects). Two subjects received 
immunosuppressive treatment, and two subjects discontinued due to glomerulonephritis TEAEs, 
amongst them one subject who turned to end-stage renal disease. None of the three subjects fully 
recovered from the event. Renal biopsy was conducted in all cases and revealed amyloid deposits in 
two subjects but also concurrent immune-complex deposits; in the third subject pauci-immune 
glomerulonephritis was diagnosed lacking concomitant amyloid disposition. Other severe and/or 
serious renal TEAEs reported in 7 subjects on inotersen and one on placebo during CS2 were renal 
impairment, tubulointerstitial nephritis, renal failure, acute kidney injury, and proteinuria (in the 
subject on placebo). Decline in renal function was in line with a ≥50% reduction in eGFR from baseline 
in 7.1% of patients on inotersen and in none on placebo, partly overlapping with serum creatinine 
increases of >44.2 µmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) from baseline in 10.7% of subjects on inotersen vs. 1.7% on 
placebo. 
Ocular adverse events potentially related to Vitamin A deficiency were balanced in subjects on 
inotersen and placebo (20.5% vs. 20%). All subjects were supplemented with Recommended Daily 
Allowance (RDA) of 3000 IU of Vitamin A. 
Inotersen administered subcutaneously caused injection site (IS) reactions in 50.9% of subjects 
(versus 11.7% on placebo), mainly IS erythema, IS pain, and IS pruritus. Injection site reactions are 
thought to be manageable by rotation of the injection site. 
Remaining other adverse events of interest, like hepatic abnormalities and flu-like symptoms were 
reported in a higher number of subjects on inotersen vs. placebo, while CNS disorders, haemorrhages, 
adverse events potentially related to complement activation, reduced thyroxine, and thrombotic events 
were reported at similar incidences for both treatment arms. 
With respect to laboratory findings and vital signs, inotersen had clear but transient elevating 
effect on C-reactive protein at treatment initiation, a known class effect of antisense oligonucleotides. 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 128/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abnormalities in IgG and IgM concentrations were also more pronounced with inotersen. Alterations in 
haematology values, such as anaemia, were observed more frequently in the inotersen –treated group 
compared to placebo, including three cases of eosinophilia in the CS2 study. Inotersen treatment was 
also associated with a lowered mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in CS2 study during the 
initial loading period. 
Deaths: Ten subjects died while being treated with inotersen compared to none on placebo (5 
subjects in the placebo-controlled study CS2, 5 subjects in the uncontrolled open-label study CS3). The 
reasons for death did not follow a specific pattern and all except one of the deaths were considered not 
related to inotersen treatment: two cases of cachexia, two cases of cardiac failure congestive and one 
case for each of the following: intestinal perforation, cardiac failure, cardiac failure 
acute/bacteriaemia/septic shock, neuropathy peripheral, and endocarditis. One death due to 
intracranial haemorrhage as a consequence of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was considered possibly 
related to inotersen treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
General uncertainties on the unfavourable effects of inotersen result from the limited long-term safety 
evidence, based on data from uncontrolled experience, and the fact that several TEAEs may be either 
related to the (immunological) effects of the drug or to the progression of the disease and co-
morbidities. The observed baseline imbalance in autonomic neuropathy in subjects on inotersen and 
placebo as well as various dose interruptions in the two studies additionally impede clear associations 
between drug and adverse effects. 
An imbalance in death cases with no fatal events in subjects on placebo and 10 fatalities in subjects 
on inotersen (5 in the placebo-controlled study CS2 and 5 in the uncontrolled single-arm extension 
study CS3 up to the latest interim data cut-off of 15th September 2017) was observed. Detailed 
discussion of every single case did not suggest a causal relationship to inotersen treatment in nine of 
ten subjects (for intracranial haemorrhage, see unfavourable effect section). The difference in 
exposure (2:1 randomisation to inotersen vs. placebo, respectively) and the baseline imbalance in 
disease severity favouring placebo may have, at least partly, contributed to the observed excess 
mortality with inotersen in study CS2. 
Although Ocular adverse events potentially related to Vitamin A deficiency were not found to be 
in excess in inotersen-treated subjects over placebo, 90.1% of subjects on inotersen but only 3.3% of 
subjects on placebo had at least one Vitamin A value <LLN in CS2. Retinyl palmitate measurements 
indicate a sufficient supply of vitamin A through chylomicron transportation when RBP4 levels are low. 
It remains, however, unexplored if inotersen could have been used safely without vitamin A 
supplementation since all patients received 3000 IU vitamin A during studies CS2 and CS3. No increase 
in TEAEs attributed to vitamin A was seen in subjects on placebo.  
Adequate Vitamin A levels are especially crucial in pregnancy; however it remains unclear, if the 
proposed vitamin A supplementation recommendations in the SmPC ensure adequate Vitamin A levels 
for normal embryo-foetal development.  
Severe thrombocytopenia is of concern with inotersen treatment and mechanistically thought to be 
different from a gradual mean decrease in platelets. No consistent effect on platelets was seen with 
multiple dosing in the Phase 1 study (CS1). Timing of severe platelet decline lacks a clear pattern and 
emerged between Week 8 and Week 20 in CS2 and between Week 77 and 151 in CS3 rendering any 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018

prediction difficult. In addition, an immunological mechanism is suggested based on findings of a 
higher total antiplatelet antibody formation in subjects with Grade 3 and especially Grade 4 
thrombocytopenia compared to those with Grade 1 or 2 thrombocytopenia. Antibodies involved 
typically more than one antiplatelet antibody species and antibodies against platelet surface 
glycoproteins seem to be responsible for the steepest decreases in platelets. A discussion of routine 
testing of antiplatelet antibodies was requested by CHMP in order to explore the possibility that 
antiplatelet antibody positivity might help identifying patients with platelet counts <50 x 109/L in 
whom inotersen should permanently be discontinued or in whom inotersen could safely be resumed. 
Baseline and on-treatment antiplatelet antibody monitoring was not found helpful to inform acute 
clinical decision making given that sensitivity and specificity of direct and indirect testing systems are 
low for detection of immune thrombocytopenia (Heikal et al. 2013).  
Subjects with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia will be in need for dose pauses according to the 
recommendations included in the SmPC (section 4.4). Experience from re-challenge with inotersen in a 
total of 4 subjects with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in the clinical studies indicate that dose pauses do 
not safely prevent from further decreases in platelets. Based on the available data it could not  be 
clarified, whether these dose interruptions additionally trigger antiplatelet antibody formation and/or 
overall immunogenicity (of note: the pattern of ADA formation points towards an increase in 
immunogenicity after dose pauses). 
Renal impairment/ decline in renal function: The most common denominators in subjects 
presenting with a loss in renal function are disease stage and age, i.e. the mean decline in eGFR during 
CS2 seems to derive from subjects with stage 2 disease. No renal function disturbances were reported 
for six subjects progressing to stage 3 of the disease. It remains unknown whether these limited data 
translate into the absence of renal impairment in a representative number of subjects with advanced 
disease. 
Risk minimisation measures for detection of glomerulonephritis have been discussed and include a 
stepwise approach for monitoring of UPCR and eGFR: monitoring is recommended to be undertaken 
every three months for all patients on inotersen while either UPCR ≥ 2x ULN or eGFR <60 
ml/min/1.72m2 (both confirmed on repeat testing) should trigger monthly monitoring. Dose 
interruption is recommended after either an eGFR decrease of more than 30% or an UPCR ≥ 2g/g (226 
mg/mmol). Based on the eGFR LLN value of 60 ml/min/1.73m2, a more than 30% reduction in eGFR 
reflects the contraindication threshold of 45 ml/min/1.73m2 that is mentioned in section 4.3 of the 
SmPC. The UPCR threshold of ≥ 2g/g (226 mg/mmol) has been chosen based on the fact that it is 
approximately equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein excretion of 2 g, which was the mandatory dose 
interruption rule in the CS2 and CS3 protocols. If glomerulonephritis is excluded as cause for the 
decline in renal function/proteinuria, re-challenge with inotersen can be considered as soon as renal 
function has improved, which is in line with section 4.3 of the SmPC.  
A mechanistical hypothesis for renal function loss has been raised that probably involves impairment of 
tubular function as a consequence of amyloid deposits. This is, however, not confirmed by data but will 
be further addressed in the post-market setting (i.e. product specific registry).  
Uncertainties arose regarding the occurrence of thrombotic and/or embolic events that were reported 
as SAEs (embolic stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and Mesenteric artery occlusion) 
and were suspected to be due to immunologically mediated inflammation. This suspician could not be 
confirmed by clinical data and the events were rather attributable to the underlying immobility and 
cardiac failure in this patient population.

Liver function is known to be affected by AON treatment, and transaminases increases (mean ALT 
and AST) were noted with inotersen but not with placebo. Baseline and on-treatment liver enzyme 
measurement (after 4 months and yearly thereafter or more frequently as clinically indicated) were 
determined based on clinical CS2 data. Liver toxicity will be further characterized in the proposed 
product registry. 
Complement activation was not thoroughly studied in the clinical program to further substantiate 
the findings on the immunogenic potential. However, a progressive increase in the number of subjects 
with complement factor C3 below LLN was observed in CS2. Further examination of complement split 
products could neither confirm nor exclude a contribution of complement activation.  
The clinical significance of thyroxine levels below LLN in 19.8% of inotersen- vs. 8.5% of placebo-
treated subjects is unclear but in line with theoretical considerations on the mode of action of 
inotersen. 
Some adverse events, e.g. hypotension, hsCRP, and platelet count increases were more frequently or 
solely reported during the loading period in Study CS2 and did not occur or to a minor extent in CS3 
study where no loading dose was administered. A loading dose is not part of the proposed posology. 
TEAEs from the Cardiac Disorders SOC were balanced across treatment groups; however, the number 
of events was higher for inotersen compared to placebo, possibly as a consequence of more severe 
cardiomyopathy in inotersen-treated subjects at baseline. Also vascular adverse events like arterial 
hypotension and hypertension were observed more frequently in the inotersen group and more severe 
CKD renal impairment stages (i.e. stages 4 and 5) have only been reported in subjects on inotersen. 
Adverse events reported in the cardiac and renal organ classes may be more relevant in patients with 
advanced cardiac disease but such patients (with NYHA stage III and IV) were not included in the 
study. 
Immunogenicity of inotersen has been discussed and currently there is no overall evidence of a 
significant increase in TEAEs related to immunogenicity.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy has been convincingly shown in one pivotal phase 2/3 trial conducted in 173 patients with 
Stage 1 or Stage 2 hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) polyneuropathy.  
Statistically significant and clinically relevant results were shown in both co-primary endpoints. Norfolk 
QoL-DN has been previously validated and the mNIS+7 has been considered appropriate to reflect the 
clinical condition and its progress (e.g. assessment of the nerve conduction in the upper limb). Two 
very similar versions of the mNIS+7 have been tested in Phase 3 studies in patients with hATTR-PN 
and found to discriminate the progression of disease in subjects with hATTR-PN and to differentiate 
between progression in those treated with active drug and those treated with placebo. While the 
subscales have been validated in other studies in patients with hATTR-PN the performance of mNIS+7 
has also been assessed and showed face validity and test-retest reproducibility. A good correlation 
between mNIS+7 and the validated Norfolk QoL-DN has been demonstrated for the overall population 
and for all stratification subgroups. As a result, the choice of endpoints is considered acceptable. 
The clinical relevance is further supported by the results of a responder analysis (sensitivity analysis 
10). 
The 13 sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoints together with the analyses of secondary, tertiary 
and exploratory endpoints provided supportive evidence for the robustness of the efficacy data in 
favour of inotersen. Out of the 13 sensitivity analyses, sensitivity analysis 6 (placebo based 
imputation) is considered by the CHMP to be of highest clinical relevance and consequently is reflected 
in the SmPC.  
It is usually expected that the scientific results are replicated in a second clinical trial. However, in this 
rare and ultimately fatal disease with a clear unmet medical need, a marketing application supported 
by data generated in a single pivotal trial is considered by CHMP acceptable. The submitted results are 
considered compelling with respect to data quality, statistical significance, clinical relevance and 
internal and external validity.  
However, in the CHMP view the submitted data are insufficient to demonstrate efficacy of inotersen in 
the treatment of cardiomyopathy manifestations associated with hATTR. In addition, the study 
population was limited to stage 1 and 2 patients with hATTR-PN and extrapolation of efficacy data to 
stage 3 patients is considered challenging. Very limited data on 6 patients who progressed to stage 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018

during treatment with placebo in study CS2 may be indicative of slowing of disease progression but 4 
of these 6 patients discontinued treatment early and the annualised progression rate presented by the 
Applicant is considered to be flawed. Therefore and taking the safety profile of inotersen into account, 
initiation of inotersen treatment in stage 3 patients is not endorsed. It is noted that no data are yet 
available for patients who, while being treated with inotersen, progressed to stage 3 of the disease. 
Inotersen obviously elicits immunological and pro-inflammatory effects in line with other drugs from 
the class of antisense oligonucleotides (e.g. Frazier et al. 2014), which are thought to translate into the 
main safety findings i.e. severe presentations of thrombocytopenia (including fatal bleeding in one 
subject) and renal abnormalities (including reports of four cases of glomerulonephritis (GN) and decline 
in renal function without GN). Immunological processes are thought to be involved in severe 
thrombocytopenia based on some investigational data for platelet count reductions. However, only 
theoretical considerations are available for the observed gradual decline in renal function, which could 
be related to inotersen treatment and/or the underlying disease. 
Two risk minimisation options for clinical management of patients at risk experiencing severe 
thrombocytopenia have been thoroughly discussed during this procedure, i.e. platelet count monitoring 
and/or antiplatelet antibody monitoring in subjects with a platelet count threshold of <50 x 109/L. 
Antiplatelet antibody measurement was, however, not considered feasible to further minimise the 
anticipated risk of bleeding given its rather complicated implementation into a routine setting. 
In order to overcome the uncertainty of an increased risk of platelet count drops in subjects with Grade 
3 thrombocytopenia, a tightened gradual monitoring scheme was introduced in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC that is considered to be sufficiently tight to capture sudden and steep drops on one hand, and 
present the lowest possible extra burden for the patient on the other hand. Low pre-specified platelet 
cut-off values trigger more frequent monitoring, reduction in dose frequency or even dose interruption 
(until platelet count recovery is confirmed): the originally proposed monitoring of platelets: >100 x 
109/L every 14 days (weekly dosing), ≥75 to <100 x 109/L weekly (dosing every 2 weeks), <75 x 
109/L twice weekly (dose interruption), and <25 x 109/L daily (discontinuation of inotersen and 
corticosteroid initiation) has been amended to include an additional monitoring step for subjects with 
platelet counts < 50x 109/L. This step includes consideration of more frequent than twice weekly 
platelet monitoring and individual corticosteroid treatment if additional bleeding risk factors are 
present. These risk factors are further specified in a footnote of table 1 in SmPC section 4.2 and 
include age >60 years (patients considered to be more susceptible to thrombocytopenia-related 
bleedings based on publically available literature (Cortalezzo et al. 1991); reference which is also 
included in section 4.4), patients receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication, and patients with 
prior history of major bleeding events.  
The anticipated uncertainties in regard to the monitoring and dose adjustment algorithm in the overall 
management of severe thrombocytopenia will be further elucidated as part of additional 
pharmacovigilance activities (i.e. product specific registry). 
Renal function parameters and reported TEAEs of renal impairment need to be interpreted against the 
background of the underlying disease including recurrent infections, fluid shifts and cardiomyopathy 
leading to variability in renal function over the course of the studies while an effect of inotersen on the 
kidney function over time (beyond those evaluated in the clinical studies) cannot be excluded from 
current data. 
Monitoring algorithm of proteinuria (UPCR) and renal function (eGFR) as well as their cut-offs for dose 
pauses sufficiently account for detection of glomerulonephritis during inotersen treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 136/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two contraindications related to renal impairment have been implemented during this procedure: 
subjects with pre-treatment UPCR ≥1g/g (113 mg/mmol) should not receive inotersen and this is 
according to the clinical study protocol exclusion criterion. In addition, renal amyloidosis in those 
subjects is considered advanced and the CHMP considers that in this population the B/R of inotersen 
treatment has not been established.  
While subjects with an eGFR of < 45 ml/min/1.73m2 were excluded from inotersen treatment as per 
the original study protocol, a higher eGFR of < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 was included in later versions of 
CS2 study protocol. Additional data were presented that could reasonably rule out a worsening of renal 
function in subjects with a pre-treatment eGFR of < 60ml/min/1.73m2, hence supporting a 
contraindication threshold of < 45 ml/min/1.73m2. Lower eGFR CKD stages have not been studied, 
except for five patients. In four of them, inotersen was permanently discontinued, even though not due 
to decline in renal function. 
Both contraindications were considered appropriate by CHMP in order not to  deny access to inotersen 
treatment to too many subjects on one hand and to sufficiently prevent a further decline of renal 
function in patients with pre-existing advanced (amyloidosis – related) renal function impairment (i.e. 
those with advanced disease stage and older subjects) on the other hand. . 
The uncertainties identified in the clinical program will further be addressed as part of post-marketing 
activities (i.e. a registry that collects specific information [through a structured questionnaire] on 
subjects who report episodes consistent with acute renal failure and results of any nephrologist 
consultation and specific tests, including reports of renal biopsies).  
The imbalance in death cases remains unexplained, although the difference in exposure and an 
imbalance in disease severity at baseline favouring placebo may have contributed to the observed 
increased mortality in patients treated with inotersen. However, the overall data point towards the 
progression of the disease as a plausible explanation rather than towards non-specific effects related to 
the systemic ASO administration. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Hereditary ATTR is a progressive and life-threatening disease where a high medical need has been 
identified due to very limited treatment options, esp. in patients beyond stage 1 disease.   
Statistically significant, robust and clinically relevant beneficial effects of inotersen have been shown in 
patients with stage 1 and 2 hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis polyneuropathy. The benefits were 
measured by employing two validated and clinically relevant primary endpoints. The secondary, 
tertiary and exploratory endpoints and a number of sensitivity analyses supported the positive 
outcome.  
The safety profile of inotersen, especially with regard to immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and 
associated bleeding risk and glomerulonephritis, is of concern. Mechanistic confirmation of inotersen’s 
contribution to immunological alterations and pro-inflammatory effects on the main safety findings is 
insufficient up to the cut-off date of this procedure. However, the safety risks are considered to be 
manageable by implementing stringent risk-minimisation measures which are expected to be both 
effective and feasible in clinical practice. These include specific monitoring, dose reduction as well as 
stopping rules. These risk minimisation measures are thoroughly described in the respective sections 
of the SmPC. Post-marketing measures will be in place to further collect data on the main identified 
safety concerns in a real-world treatment setting. 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018  
Page 137/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, in patients with stage 1 or stage 2, the benefits of treatment with inotersen are considered to 
outweigh the risks. 
On the other hand, efficacy of inotersen has not been sufficiently shown on cardiac manifestations of 
hATTR and in patients with advanced (stage 3) polyneuropathy. Considering the substantial 
uncertainty regarding efficacy and the safety concerns with inotersen, the B/R balance of inotersen 
treatment in patients with only cardiac manifestation of hATTR and in patients with advanced (stage 3) 
polyneuropathy is considered unfavourable. 
The applicant has agreed to restrict the indication accordingly. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R ratio of Tegsedi in the treatment of stage 1 or Stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients 
with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR) is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP, by consensus, is of the opinion that Tegsedi is not similar to Vyndaqel, as defined in Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See Appendix 1.

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of TEGSEDI in each Member State (MS), the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
must  agree  about  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  materials,  including  communication 
media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority (NCA).  
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where  TEGSEDI is marketed, all patients who are  expected to 
been  administered  the  products  are  provided  with  a  patient  alert  card  (wallet  size),  aiming  at 
preventing  and/or  minimising  the  important  identified  risks  of  thrombocytopenia,  glomerulonephritis, 
and the important potential risk of ocular toxicity due to vitamin A deficiency,  and reminding patients: 
 
To  carry  the  card  with  them  at  all  times  during  the  treatment  and  up  to  8  weeks  following 
treatment discontinuation; 
 
The  list  of  signs  and  symptoms  of  thrombocytopenia,  glomerulonephritis,    and  ocular  toxicity 
due  to  vitamin  A  deficiency,  highlighting  that  these    might  be  severe  or life-threatening,  and 
advising patients to call immediately their doctor or attend the emergency room if such signs 
and symptoms appear; 
To undergo all blood or urine tests as arranged by their doctor;  
To have a list of all other medicines they are using for any visit to a Health Care Professionals 
(HCP); 
 
 
In addition to a prompt to include the contact details of the patient’s physician and a call for reporting, 
the patient card should also:  
  Alert HCPs that the patient is taking TEGSEDI, its indication and the key safety concerns; 
  Advise HCPs that, due to the risks of thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis, patients should 
have their platelet count monitored at least every 2 weeks, and urine to protein creatinine ratio 
and estimated glomerular filtration rate monitored at least every 3 months; 
  Advise  HCPs  that  if  the  platelet  count  falls  below  25  x  109/L,  Tegsedi  treatment  should  be 
permanently discontinued and corticosteroid therapy is recommended; 
Assessment report  
EMA/411876/2018

Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that inotersen is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

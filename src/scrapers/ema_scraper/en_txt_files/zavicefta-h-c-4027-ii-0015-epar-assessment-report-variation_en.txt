1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 29 March 2019 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested:

C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an

Extension of indication to include paediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 18 years for Zavicefta (for 
the treatment of cIAI and cUTI), based on data from paediatric studies D4280C00014, C3591004 and 
C3591005 and the population PK modelling/simulation analyses (CAZ-MS-PED-01 and CAZ-MS-PED-02).  
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated in order to reflect 
this additional population, the paediatric posology, paediatric safety information, the description of the 
clinical trials and handling instructions for paediatric dosing. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to correct the sodium content to 
SmPC sections 2 and 4.4 and PL section 2 and the volumes of distribution of ceftazidime and avibactam in 
SmPC section 5.2.  
The RMP version 3.0 has also been submitted. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006, the application included the EMA Decision(s) 
P/0340/2018 of 8 November 2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some remaining measures in 
the PIP are still deferred. The current application is based on Study 3, 4, 5 and 7 in the PIP. 
The PDCO concluded a partial compliance for the PIP (EMEA-C2-001313-PIP01-12-M08) with positive 
outcome. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Infections due to resistant Gram-negative bacteria are increasingly common also in paediatric patients. 
Beta-lactamases are a major cause of resistance to beta-lactam antibacterial agents in infections caused by 
Gram-negative pathogens. The increasing resistance has significantly limited treatment options in patients 
with suspected extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) infections and often only carbapenems have 
sufficient coverage for empiric use in these cases. 
Few antibiotics with activity against ESBL and carbapenemase producing Gram-negative bacteria are 
currently available. Furthermore, only a few antibacterial agents have had their safety and efficacy carefully 
evaluated in paediatric patients. Hence, there is need for further treatment options for the paediatric patient 
population. 
Zavicefta - Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) - is a fixed drug combination (FDC) that has been developed 
as an intravenously administered compound for treatment of patients with infections caused by 
Gram-negative pathogens, including pathogens that are resistant to ceftazidime. 
Avibactam is a novel non-betalactam-lactamase inhibitor with a spectrum of beta-lactamases of class A and 
class C, including ESBLs and serine-based carbapenemases (KPCs). It also inhibits class D beta-lactamases 
(e.g. OXA-48 type carbapenemase). Avibactam has no inhibitory effect on class B metallo-beta-lactamases. 
Ceftazidime is a cephalosporin, approved in the EU for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal 
infection (cIAI), complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), nosocomial pneumonia (NP) and a range of other

infections. It has no noticeable antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, with the exception of 
some streptococci, or anaerobes. 
Zavicefta (CAZ-AVI) is currently approved for adults in complicated intra-abdominal infection, complicated 
urinary infection and hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia. 
Furthermore, ceftazidime (CAZ) is well-known from clinical practice also in the paediatric population and is 
approved from the age of 2 months. 
This application was initially intended to extend the approved treatment of cIAI and cUTI indications to 
children aged from 3 months to less than 18 years of age, including the appropriate dose recommendations 
for this age subgroup. The CHMP, during the variation procedure, suggested that the application would be 
extended to include the indications HAP/VAP and aerobic Gram-negative infections in patients with limited 
treatment options, in addition to cIAI and cUTI. The MAH provided therefore further analyses, updated 
Clinical Summary and RMP as part of the responses to the first RSI. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application. However, a non-clinical safety assessment 
specific for paediatric patients ≥3 months of age has been conducted, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
In the approved PIP (EMEA-001313-PIP01-12-M08) targeting the indications cIAI and cUTI, a 14-day 
toxicity study in juvenile rats is included in the measures.  
At the time of the initial MAA procedure for Zavicefta, the safety and efficacy profile of ceftazidime (CAZ) was 
already well known from clinical use, including children from 2 months of age. New non-clinical data was 
therefore only generated and submitted for avibactam (AVI), and to support the combination (CAZ-AVI). 
The initial MAA dossier included a dose range finding and a definitive juvenile rat toxicity study conducted 
with the CAZ-AVI (4:1) combination (studies 20040271(3582DR) and 20047213(3694DR), respectively), 
and two investigative renal studies in neonatal/juvenile rats (studies 3405KR and 200226123(3458KR)). 
The definitive juvenile rat toxicity study is in compliance with the PIP. 
Compared to the initial MAA, no new non-clinical data have been generated for this extension of indication 
application. General non-clinical characteristics for avibactam and the combination are briefly summarised 
below (source: EPAR for Zavicefta). The definitive juvenile rat toxicity study is presented in more detail in 
connection with the non-clinical safety assessment specific for paediatric patients ≥ 3 months of age. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Avibactam does not adversely affect the antibacterial activity of ceftazidime and restores the activity of 
ceftazidime against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria within its spectrum of activity and within the range 
of inhibition of avibactam.  
Intravenous administration of avibactam had no clinically relevant effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal or renal systems in animal models. There was also no effect on the hERG channel in a GLP 
compliant study at avibactam concentrations up to 1000 µM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 9/167 
 
 
  
  
 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Avibactam had no effect on plasma protein binding and has low penetration into blood cells. Avibactam is 
widely distributed across tissues and organs and evidence showed that avibactam crosses the placenta and 
is also excreted in rat milk.  
Metabolism of avibactam is very low in both animals and humans. Avibactam is readily excreted in urine and 
is also eliminated by OAT1 and OAT3 transport across the renal epithelium (but not ceftazidime). Blood 
concentrations of avibactam may therefore be affected by other drugs which induce or inhibit OAT1 and/or 
OAT3 transportation.  
No PK drug-drug interactions were observed between avibactam and ceftazidime following single or repeat 
IV administration to rats and dogs for up to 28 days and ceftazidime does not interact with the active uptake 
of avibactam into the proximal tubular cells in the kidney. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Following daily intravenous administration of avibactam for 4-weeks the No Observed Adverse Effect Level 
(NOAEL) was deemed to be 250 mg/kg/day in both rat and dog. No major systemic toxicity was observed in 
adult animals with avibactam or ceftazidime either alone or in combination; the main issue identified was 
local tolerance at the injection site in all non-clinical species used. Adverse drug reactions were seen in the 
clinical trials with avibactam but there were no reports of severe reactions or patient discontinuations due to 
injection site tolerability.  
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
Avibactam tested negative in the Ames assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis, chromosomal aberration assay 
and rat micronucleus test. No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with avibactam alone or in 
combination with ceftazidime. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Avibactam did not affect female fertility/reproductive performance or embryo-foetal development following 
repeat IV administration to rats at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day (AA39554 (DS0021)). Two malformed 
foetuses at 500 mg/kg/day (one with domed head, protruding tongue, malrotated right hindlimb and 
hyperextension of the right forepaw and a second with scoliosis) and at 1000 mg/kg/day (anophthalmia) 
were reported in the rat embryo-foetal development study. Since there were no malformations and no 
overall effects on embryo-foetal development at 250 mg/kg/day, the exposures at this dose were 
considered as an appropriate reference for a no observed effect level (NOEL) for embryo-foetal changes in 
the rat.  
In the rabbit embryo/foetal development study (AA39552 (DS0024)), there was an increased 
post-implantation loss at 1000 mg/kg/day and lower mean foetal weights with slightly retarded ossification 
of the metacarpal of the first digit, tarsal bone and sixth sternebra was observed at 300 mg/kg/day and 
above. These findings have been adequately addressed in the Zavicefta SmPC. There were no other overt 
findings at 100 mg/kg/day and this dose is therefore deemed to be the NOEL for embryo-foetal changes in 
the rabbit and the NOAEL for maternal toxicity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 10/167 
 
 
  
  
Avibactam administered alone during pregnancy and lactation to F0 rats was associated with a dose related 
increase in the incidence of F1 renal pelvic dilatation (without recovery) and ureter dilatation in less than 
10% of the pups, with no associated pathological changes to the renal parenchyma (AB04834 (3225WR)). 
The effect was seen at maternal exposure levels ≥ 1.5 times human therapeutic exposures. Ureter dilatation 
was reversible and not seen in the young adult offspring. The dose of 120 mg/kg/day was considered to be 
the NOEL. 
Juvenile toxicology 
14 Day Intravenous Toxicity Study in Neonatal Rats with a 5-Week Recovery Period (Study number 
20047213; reference number 3694DR, GLP) 
CAZ/AVI was dosed via an IV bolus injection into the tail vein of suckling SD rats (10/sex/group) once daily 
for 14 days from post-natal Day 7 to post-natal Day 20, using the intended clinical ratio of 4:1 ceftazidime: 
avibactam (0, 50/13, 150/38, 455/115). An additional 10 rats/sex/group were included in the control and 
high dose to assess reversibility following a 5-week recovery period and were terminated on PND 56. 
Additional satellite animals were included for assessment of toxicokinetics on PND 7 and 20. 
The following parameters and end points were evaluated in this study: viability, clinical observations, body 
weights, body weight changes, functional observational battery evaluations, clinical pathology, toxicokinetic 
evaluation, organ weights (paired kidney, brain and spleen), macroscopic observations, and microscopic 
examinations. 
There were no quantifiable concentrations of ceftazidime or avibactam in the control samples collected from 
the toxicokinetic satellite animals. All toxicokinetic satellite animals that were dosed with ceftazidime and 
avibactam showed exposure for both ceftazidime and avibactam that was approximately proportional to 
dose on both PND 7 and 20, for all doses. Exposure based on AUC(0-t) at PND 20 was less than half the 
exposure observed at PND 7 for both ceftazidime and avibactam, reflecting an increase in clearance. There 
was no apparent difference in exposure between males and females.  
In general, the exposure to ceftazidime and avibactam in juvenile rats appeared to be higher than in adult 
rats, when adjusting for administered dose. See Table 1 and Table 2.

Table 2. Summary of mean toxicokinetic parameters of avibactam in neonatal Sprague Dawley 
rats (PND 7 and PND 20) 
Renal cortical cysts in all groups, including controls, were observed at necropsy and by histology and were 
still present at the end of the 5-week recovery phase. The cysts covered a small proportion of the cortex and 
did not appear to have any significant implications for the animals (no adverse clinical signs, no effects on 
body weight gain and no significant changes in clinical pathology or organ weights). Evidence from two 
additional supportive studies (and the lack of renal cysts in the repeat dose toxicity studies using adult rats 
of the same species/strain, suggested that the findings were background lesions from one specific breeding 
facility (3405KR and 200226123(3458KR)). 
A minimal to mild, reversible, increase in extramedullary haematopoiesis was observed in the spleen and 
liver of both sexes at 455/115 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI. One female at 50/13 mg/kg/day on PND 21 and one 
female at 455/115 mg/kg/day on PND 56 had unilateral pelvic dilatation in the kidney. The MAH established 
a NOAEL at 455 /115 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI. The observation was however consistent with findings from the 
pre- and postnatal development study, which were associated with administration of avibactam. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Zavicefta is indicated for the treatment of the following infections in adults; 
•  Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) 
•  Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis 
•  Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) 
• 
Treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adult patients with limited 
treatment options. 
The active ingredients in Zavicefta are ceftazidime and avibactam. 
The recommended dosage of Zavicefta for adult patients with estimated creatinine clearance ≥51 mL/min is 
one vial containing 2000 mg ceftazidime and 500 mg avibactam administered by intravenous (IV) infusion. 
Treatment will be repeated every 8 hours, i.e. a maximum of 3 vials per 24-hour period. Hence, the 
maximum daily dose is 6000 mg/day and 1500 mg/day of ceftazidime and avibactam, respectively. 
Treatment duration is normally from 5 to 14 days. 
For the paediatric population, the recommended maximum dosage is similar to the adult population. 
Zavicefta was first approved in Europe in 2016. In the current submission, an extension of the indication to 
include paediatric use for the indications cIAI and cUTI is proposed.

The environmental risk assessment (ERA) is divided into an ERA for avibactam (Phase I) and an ERA for 
ceftazidime (Phase I and Phase II: Tier A and B).

The CHMP considered that issues with the calculation of the Fpen for avibactam and ceftazidime and the 
prevalence/ consumption data were resolved in the last revision of the environmental risk assessment. 
The PECsurfacewater for both substances are now accepted, as well as the prevalence/consumption data.  
Ceftazidine is not considered a PBT and does not need to be classified as such.  
Phase II Tier A, ceftazidime 
The Phase II Tier A assessment for ceftazidime was assessed during the initial marketing authorisation 
procedure, and therefore the results in table 2 are copied from the previous assessment report. 
For the calculation of the PNEC of all three compartments, an assessment factor (AF) of 10 is used. 
The risk quotient (RQ) for all compartments are under the action limit (table 2), therefore a Tier B is not 
triggered. However, in the water-sediment study greater than 10% of the applied radioactivity was 
associated with the sediment phase, therefore the effect of ceftazidime on the sediment dwelling organism 
Chironomus riparius was investigated in Tier B. 
Phase II Tier B, ceftazidime 
The Tier B study on sediment-water toxicity in Chironomids has been assessed previously: LOEC (28d) >100 
mg/kg dw, NOEC 100 mg/kg dw, recalculated to standard sediment: NOECstandard sediment 303 mg/kg, and using 
an AF of 10, results in a PNEC of 3030 µg/kg 
The calculation of the PECsediment is slightly different from the previous application (the Kpsusp is calculated 
using the weight fraction organic carbon in susp. solids (default value) and the KOC rather than using the Kd 
value).

The CHMP considered the use of the weight fraction organic carbon in susp. solids (default value) and the KOC 
rather than using the Kd value in the calculation of the Kpsusp acceptable. The RQsediment is 0.00043, which is 
under the action limit of 1 and no further testing is required. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Findings in juvenile toxicity studies 
Renal cortical cysts 
Non-reversible renal cortical cysts were detected in all groups (including control) of juvenile rats (post-natal 
day 7-20). This finding was assessed in the MAA procedure and the clinical relevance of renal cortical cysts 
detected in juvenile rats was discussed in depth. Evidence from two additional supportive studies and the 
lack of renal cysts in the repeat dose toxicity studies in adult rats of the same species/strain, suggested that 
the findings were background lesions from one specific breeding facility and therefore unlikely to have any 
clinical significance. Additional information also suggested that the cysts were substantially distinct from 
human polycystic renal disease and that since nephrogenesis is still ongoing in juvenile rats, whereas it is 
complete by 34 weeks gestation in humans, the renal findings observed in the juvenile rats was unlikely to 
be relevant for humans. Furthermore, based on the nature and very low number of the renal cortical cysts, 
reflecting an effect on a minimal number of individual nephrons (i.e. each cyst indicating one single 
nephron), the CHMP considered that should the finding occur in humans it would not have any clinical impact 
in paediatric patients, including pre-term neonates. 
Pelvic dilatation of the kidney 
The two cases of unilateral pelvic dilatation in the kidney observed at the end, or during the recovery phase 
of the definitive juvenile rat study were not discussed in the study report or by the MAH. During the initial 
MAA procedure, these were however assessed together with the similar observations in the F1 generation in 
the peri-post natal development (PPND) study in rat. The CHMP did not conclude on the potential risk related 
to use during pregnancy, or in neonates. Since a human relevance could not be excluded, the findings from 
the PPND study are reported in section 5.3 of the approved SmPC for Zavicefta. 
Dilatation of the renal pelvis is a recurring finding in rodents. This change is usually not of pathological or 
toxicological significance unless accompanied by histological evidence of pathological changes to the renal 
parenchyma (Histopathology of preclinical toxicity studies, Peter Greaves 3rd Ed.). Pathological changes 
were indeed not reported in the PPND study or the juvenile toxicity study. Nevertheless, the MAH does not 
suggest any mechanistic explanations for the dilated pelvis and there are no related reports of urine 
obstruction. Considering that this dose-related and irreversible finding has been seen in two different studies 
involving juvenile animals, and that the intended patient population includes children from 3 months of age 
with UTI infections, the MAH was requested to discuss the potential clinical relevance for the human 
paediatric population. Following receipt of supplementary information, the mechanism leading to an 
increase of dilated kidney pelvis in both the PPND study and the juvenile rat study, remains unknown.  It can 
however be agreed that factors related to rat specific ontogeny, together with low incidence, indicate 
spontaneous background findings that does not suggest any specific concern with respect to clinical 
paediatric use. 
Extramedullary haematopoiesis  
In the juvenile rat toxicity study, a reversible increase in extramedullary haematopoiesis was observed in 
the spleen and liver of both sexes at 455/115 mg/kg/day CAZ-AVI. At this dose level, the PND 20 CAZ-AVI 
AUC0-t was 785/145 µg*h/ml. A similar exposure to CAZ-AVI in children as in adults is expected (same 
PK/PD target attainment values). The total plasma levels in healthy volunteers given 500 mg avibactam and 
2000 mg ceftazidime every 8 hours, 120-minute infusion (D4280C00011) was 935/113 µg*h/ml. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 17/167 
 
 
  
  
suggest low margins of safety. The increase in extramedullary haematopoiesis was however classified as 
minimal to mild. Together with the reversible nature and lack of changes in any haematology parameters, 
this finding is not considered to be of clinical concern. Furthermore, haematological effects have been 
investigated and reported in the clinical paediatric trials. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The issues with the calculation of the Fpen for avibactam and ceftazidime and the prevalence/ consumption 
data have been resolved in the last revision of the environmental risk assessment. The PECsurfacewater for 
both substances are now accepted, as well as the prevalence/consumption data. Ceftazidine is not 
considered a PBT and does not need to be classified as such. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted results from a juvenile animal toxicity study, in compliance with the non-clinical 
measures in the approved PIP. There are no outstanding concerns from a non-clinical point of view.  
The environmental risk assessment is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has provided a 
statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance 
with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The paediatric data program for Zavicefta (including the completed/submitted and the planned/ongoing

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
This application to extend all adult indications to children and adolescents ≥3 months to <18 years is 
supported by one phase I (D4280C00014) and two phase II studies (D4280C00015/Pfizer reference 
C3591004; D4280C00016/Pfizer reference C3591005) (Table 5). An updated population PK (popPK) 
analysis was conducted to assess the PK of ceftazidime (CAZ) and avibactam (AVI) in paediatric patients and 
to support the paediatric dose recommendations (CAZ-MS-PED-02). 
There are no expected differences in the mechanism of action of CAZ-AVI based on age as both CAZ and AVI 
exert their effects by acting on the causative pathogen, and the Gram-negative causative pathogens are 
similar in adults and children, and the same joint PK/PD targets would be relevant to dose setting in 
paediatric patients. Thus, the aim of the dose selection was to achieve comparable exposures to those 
calculated for the Phase III studies in adult patients with cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP. 
The proposed CAZ-AVI dose in patients aged 6 months to <18 years is 50/12.5 mg/kg q8h (capped at the 
adult dose of 2 g/0.5 g) as a 2-hour infusion. In patients aged 3 to <6 months, the proposed dose is 40/10 
mg/kg q8h as a 2-hour infusion. Dose adjustments are recommended for paediatric patients ≥2 years with 
impaired renal function (31 to <50 mL/min/1.73m2). The proposed paediatric doses were used in the clinical 
phase II studies (C3591004 and C3591005) in cIAI and cUTI patients, respectively. The formulation used for 
the Phase II paediatric studies is identical to the final drug product for commercial use. 
The CHMP acknowledged that, in accordance with the EMA guideline on medicinal products to treat bacterial 
infections (EMA/CHMP/187859/2017), extrapolation of efficacy to the paediatric populations could be made 
provided similar exposures (and similar safety profile) to those in adults. One phase I study investigating 
CAZ and AVI PK in paediatric patients with suspected or confirmed infection, two phase II safety studies in 
target populations cIAI and cUTI, and popPK models incorporating all available paediatric PK data have been 
submitted in support of the current variation application. These investigations were conducted as part of the 
agreed CAZ-AVI Paediatric Investigation Plan, and the phase II studies have been submitted in previous 
procedures (C3591004 in EMEA/H/C/4027/II/09 and C3591005 in EMEA/H/C/4027/P46/003). The 
formulation used for the Phase II paediatric studies is identical to the final drug product for commercial use. 
The proposed CAZ doses are similar to approved doses for CAZ single substance products. 
The agreed PIP includes nosocomial pneumonia (NP, HAP/VAP) in patients from 3 months to less than 18 
years of age, and aerobic Gram-negative infections in patients from birth to less than 3 months of age, in 
addition to  the cUTI and cIAI indications in patients from 3 months to <18 years as initially sought for this 
paediatric indication. During the variation procedure, the CHMP suggested that the application would be 
extended to the HAP/VAP indication as well as aerobic Gram-negative infections in patients with limited 
treatment options. The MAH agreed to this, and the Clinical Summary was re-submitted with the inclusion of 
the above-mentioned additional indications. A PK study on NP, HAP/VAP requested by PDCO as part of the 
PIP is ongoing, and no PK data is presently available. This means that approval of these indications will be 
based on extrapolation using popPK and simulations without a supportive PK bridge. When the HAP/VAP 
exposure data becomes available the dosing recommendation and PK bridge must be reassessed.

generated during this submission and no new bioanalytical methods were used for the analysis of samples 
from studies C3591004 (cIAI) or C3591005 (cUTI). 
Acceptance criteria of analytical runs/within study validation 
The  CAZ  and  AVI  concentrations  were  analysed  by  Covance  Laboratories  Ltd  (Harrogate,  UK),  using  a 
validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection method (Covance HB-13-001 
[8280474], Pfizer reference C359901). For all pediatric studies, the LLOQ was 50 ng/mL for CAZ and 10 
ng/mL for AVI. ULOQ was 10000 ng/mL and 20000 ng/mL for CAZ and AVI, respectively. 
- 1004 Bioanalytical report (cIAI study) 
Total number of samples analysed were 179 for both CAZ and AVI, respectively. Eight CAZ (4.5%) and three 
AVI  (1.7%)  samples  were  re-analysed  due  to  high  IS  response  or  a  result  >ULOQ.  Two  samples  were 
received outside the established AVI stability period. Incurred sample reanalysis were performed for >10% 
of samples (20 CAZ and 20 AVI), where 80% of CAZ repeat and original results were within 20% of the mean 
of  the  two  values.  The  corresponding  number  for  AVI  was  85%.  To  dilute  study  samples  with  high  CAZ 
concentrations into the validated range, a larger dilution factor (100-fold) was successfully validated. For 
AVI, the overall %RSD value at the LoQC level (19.3%) was outside the mean QC sample acceptance criteria 
(±15%) due to one an individual LoQC value (run 20). All reported runs met acceptance criteria, including 
run 20, and the overall %RSD value is therefore considered to have no impact on the integrity of the QC data 
generated. Analytical run 19 was repeated twice before calibration and QC acceptance criteria were met. 
Carry-over was <5% of peak area of subsequent samples. 
Calibration standard data, QC sample data, incurred sample reanalysis data and chromatograms indicate 
that the method performed acceptably during the sample analysis. 
- 1005 Bioanalytical report (cUTI study) 
Total number of samples analysed were 183 for both CAZ and AVI, respectively. Twelve CAZ (6.6%) and 
nine  AVI  (4.9%)  samples were  re-analysed  due  to  high  IS  response,  a  result  >ULOQ  or  failure  to  meet 
acceptance  criteria  when  analysed  with  dilution.  Sixteen  samples  were  received/analysed  outside  the 
established CAZ stability period. Incurred sample reanalyses were performed for >10% of samples (24 CAZ 
and 24 AVI), where 91.7% of CAZ repeat and original results were within 20% of the mean of the two values. 
The corresponding number for AVI was 95.8%. Runs 15 and 16 did not meet acceptance criteria and were 
re-analysed. Carry-over was <5% of peak area of subsequent samples. 
Calibration standard data, QC sample data, incurred sample reanalysis data and chromatograms indicate 
that the method performed acceptably during the sample analysis. 
The CHMP considered that the analytical methods submitted to support the new phase II clinical studies 
C3591004 and C3591005 had been adequately validated in accordance with the EMA bioanalytical guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1). These methods were assessed in the original MAA, and no new 
bioanalytical methods were used for the analysis of samples from studies supporting the current variation 
application. The analysis of PK study samples (studies C3591004 and C3591005) are acceptable. 
The bioanalytical method used in the phase I study D4280C00014 investigating single-dose PK profile was 
missing in the initial submission of this procedure, but it was provided as response to the first RSI. Based on 
the review of the submitted report, the bioanalytical methods used to analyse PK samples from paediatric 
patients in the above-mentioned studies are considered by the Committee to be adequately validated.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The PK data analyses were performed using non-compartmental analysis. Population PK (popPK) analyses 
were performed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) with First Order Conditional Estimation 
with Interaction (FOCE-INTER) and Stochastic Approximation of Expectation-Maximisation estimation 
(SAEM) methods. 
The CHMP considered that acceptable methods were used.

The  CHMP  noted  that  several  popPK  models  have  been  developed  throughout  Zavicefta  product 
development, with separate models for each active substance. The preceding models are overall similar to 
the  most  recent  ones  (CAZ-MS-PED-02)  in  the  structural  and  co-variate  models,  i.e.  linear 
two-compartmental  models  with  first  order  elimination)  and  with  CLCr  and  body  weight  as  important 
covariates on CL and V, respectively, for both CAZ and AVI models. Patient population (cIAI and cUTI) was 
identified as a significant covariate impacting CL and/or Vc of CAZ and AVI, independent of any demographic 
differences.  In  general,  the  models  were  found  to  describe  the  data  well  (MAA  assessment  and 
EMEA/H/C/4027/II/02). 
Two popPK models were submitted in this application (CAZ-MS-PED-01 and -02). This assessment report 
focuses on the latter, which is the main model incorporating all available paediatric PK data and supporting 
the proposed paediatric dose recommendations. The main model is considered by the CHMP to be of medium 
regulatory impact. 
Objectives 
-  Describe the popPK of CAZ and AVI in pediatric patients with cIAI and cUTI, including subject covariate 
effects. 
- 
Evaluate current pediatric dose recommendations for cUTI, cIAI, and NP through simulations from the 
final CAZ and AVI PK models, and explore alternative CAZ-AVI dose regimens in the event that serious 
deficiencies were noted in the exposures achieved by the currently proposed regimens. 
-  Confirm the recommended dosing regimen of the current pediatric studies C3591004 and C3591005 and 
support the dosing regimen selection for two pediatric studies C3591024 (neonatal sepsis) and 
C3591025 (NP). 
Model development process 
The CAZ and AVI models from CAZ-MS-09 were refined and updated. Body weight and renal function 
(including a renal maturation function) were taken into account in the base model. The impacts of selected 
covariates on CL and Vc were tested using a forward inclusion/backward elimination procedure (acceptance 
criteria α = 0.05). All covariates, except the allometric body weight scaling, body size-normalised CrCL 
(NCrCL), and the renal maturation effect, were then subjected to a backward elimination procedure 
(acceptance criteria α = 0.01). 
Continuous covariate relationships were primarily modelled using power models. Other structural models, 
e.g. Emax model for weight on CL, were also examined if deemed necessary based on graphical analysis of 
EBE of the base model vs the individual covariate. Categorical covariate relationships were modelled as 
follows: 
As a last step, various variance-covariance matrices of random effect were evaluated, beginning with the 
most parsimonious case of a diagonal structure and subsequently increasing in complexity to include 
off-diagonal covariances if supported by the data. A cross-drug scatterplot matrix of the random effects was 
used to examine the correlation structure of both models.  
Dataset 
Individuals were defined as evaluable if they had at least one CAZ or AVI dose administration and one 
corresponding post-dose plasma sample of CAZ or AVI (>LLOQ). The total dataset consisted of 9674 CAZ 
observations from 2135 subjects and 14254 AVI observations from 2409 subjects. Of these, 519 CAZ 
observations and 518 AVI observations were from 160 paediatric patients. Of the paediatric patients, 32 
were from Study D4280C00014 with any type of suspected or confirmed infection, 60 were cIAI patients

(C3591004), and 67 were cUTI patients (C3591005). Eleven paediatric patients were excluded from 
analysis. 
Table 6. Number of patients by infection and age range 
The majority of the paediatric patients were Caucasian/white (79%), median age was 7.57 years (range: 
0.25 to 17.67 years) and 56% were females. Weight, height, and BMI were in line with expected baseline 
characteristics of this paediatric population overall and within each age cohort (Olsen, 2010). Study 
C3591004 had a greater proportion of males (73%) and study C3591005 of Chinese/Taiwanese (18%) 
subjects. The median baseline NCrCL was 104 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range 43 - 489 mL/min/1.73 m2). Based on 
reasonable physiologic values, the upper range for NCrCL was capped to a maximum value of 150 
mL/min/1.73 m2 for NONMEM modeling in 10, 12, and 2 patients in studies D4280C00014, C3591004, and 
C3591005, respectively. 
Data missingness 
Missing NCrCL values were imputed for subjects (N=2) by using CrCL, body surface area (BSA), weight, and 
height (Gehan and George, 1970). Missing PMA values for study D4280C00014 were imputed based on the 
assumption that subjects were born at full term. PMA (weeks) was imputed as 52 × AGE (y) + 40 for eight 
subjects. BLQ were either excluded (pre-dose samples) or imputed to LLOQ/2 (adults only). 
Outliers 
The final models were rerun with the total dataset to assess impact of excluded outliers (N=33 CAZ and N= 
17 AVI excluded observations, outliers defined as |CWRES|>4). A total of 3 CAZ and 17 AVI outlier 
observations were excluded from paediatric studies. Data cleaning for the adult dataset is described in the 
popPK report CAZ-MS-09.

Assumptions 
Table 7. Model key assumptions (CAZ-MS-PED-02) 
Co-variate considerations 
Allometric body weight effects on clearance (CL) and volume, and a renal maturation function for children ≤2 
years were incorporated a priori (Table 7). The CrCL effect on CL from the preceding adult models was 
replaced with NCrCL1 while keeping prior fixed the adult parameter estimates for the CrCL effect (for CAZ). 
The NCrCL was capped at an upper bound of 150 mL/min/1.73m2. The impact of renal maturation on CL was 
accounted for by a sigmoidal function of post-menstrual age (PMA) effect on CL with parameters fixed to the 
values reported in the literature reference2. 
The following covariates were considered for CAZ and AVI models: sex, race (Caucasian/White, Black, Asian, 
American Indian/Alaskan Native, Japanese, Chinese/Taiwanese, other Asians), age, body weight, APACHE II 
score (≤10 vs >10), ESRD, dialysis, augmented renal clearance (ARC), presence of ventilator in hospital 
room on PK day, population (healthy, cUTI, cIAI, NP, general infection), study phase, pediatric effect. 
Diagnostics/GoF evaluation 
Base and final models were evaluated by standard diagnostic plots (e.g. DV vs. PRED/IPRED, IWRES vs. 
IPRED, CWRES vs. PRED, WRES vs. TIME, IWRES vs. IPRED, VPCs, individual random effect values η vs. 
covariates). Also, successful convergence, OFV (or corrected AIC), precision of parameter estimates, 
1 Peadiatric BSA-NCrCL were calculated using the “bedside” Schwartz formula (i.e. NCrCL mL/min/1.73m2 = 0.413 x 
height or length/serum creatinine mg/dL). Adult NCrCL was computed using BSA-normalised CrCL (NCrCL = CrCL x 
1.73/BSA where Cokcroft Gault formula were used to compute CrCL and Gehan and George formula to compute BSA).

plausibility of and uncertainty in parameter estimates, and degree of parsimony were assessed. pcVPCs 
were stratified by paediatric versus adult subjects, age, weight, NCrCL, and disease indication to assess the 
predictive performance of the model in each stratum. 
Simulations to support dose recommendations in special populations and for PTA analysis 
The final CAZ-AVI popPK models (CAZ-MS-PED-02) were used to conduct simulations (1000 subjects per 
age group, indication and renal function group) to support paediatric dose recommendations. In this 
updated popPK model, the paediatric PK data from phase 2 studies (C3591004 and C3591005) and Study 
D4280C00014 were pooled with PK data from adults (phase 1 to phase 3). This results in a total number of 
9628 observations and 2130 subjects in the final ceftazidime dataset, and 14223 observations and 2403 
subjects in the final avibactam dataset. Of the CAZ-AVI paediatric patients, 32 were from Study 
D4280C00014 with any type of suspected or confirmed infection, 59 were cIAI patients from Study 
C3591004, and 63 were cUTI patients from Study C3591005. A range of mg/kg doses were simulated, with 
the total dose capped at the adult CAZ-AVI label doses (e.g. 2 / 0.5g q8h over a 2-hour infusion for normal 
renal function). Given ongoing renal maturation in paediatric patients ≤2 years of age, definitions of renal 
impairment based on adult CrCL ranges do not necessarily translate directly to children. Subjects with renal 
impairment were not simulated for subjects ≤2 years of age. 
A demography dataset (of 457 patients, 363 had NCrCL ≥80 mL/min/1.73 m2) was constructed for the 
simulations for patients from 2 to <18 years by pooling covariate values (i.e. age, weight, height, and 
NCrCL) from the CAZ-AVI paediatric studies with values from paediatric studies from another antibiotic 
program (ceftaroline fosamil). Simulations for all children <2 years of age were based on demography from 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. For adults, demographics were first stratified by 
indication followed by an approach subsetting for NCrCL ≥80 mL/min/1.73 m2, Phase III-only, non-Asian, 
and non-Japanese. For each indication, adults were resampled with replacement within the resulting 
indication specific groups (i.e. 271 adults with cUTI, 353 adults with cIAI, and 161 adults with HAP/VAP). 
PTA was determined as the percent of 1000 patients meeting PKPD targets for both CAZ and AVI, using the 
joint PKPD target of 50% fT>MIC at an MIC of 8 mg/L for CAZ and 50% fT>CT at a CT of 1 mg/L for AVI. The 
joint target was employed for PTA simulations for all site-specific indications (i.e. cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP). 
In addition, PTA at an MIC range of 0.125 to 128 mg/L was assessed. Free plasma concentration of CAZ and 
AVI were calculated using unbound percentages of 85% and 92%, respectively. 
The CHMP noted that CAZ and AVI model datasets are based on sparse and intensive sampling in phase I-III 
clinical studies in healthy subjects, adult and paediatric patients. Sparse sampling was conducted in phase II 
multiple dose paediatric clinical studies (three sampling periods at on Day 3 of treatment i.e. after nine 
administered doses) and, as the applicant has clarified during the procedure, in the phase I single dose study 
for patients aged ≥3 months to <6 years (cohorts 3 and 4). Paediatric studies are further described below 
under the Section “Special populations”. 
The MAH clarified the numbers used in the final population PK analyses (for CAZ 2130 individuals, 154 of 
whom were paediatric patients, for AVI 2403 individuals, 153 of whom were paediatric patients), and  the 
reasons for the exclusions are described. 
Regarding the paediatric dataset, more than 25 patients are providing PK data per age cohort (12- <18y; 6- 
<12y; 2- <6y; 3months- <2y). However, cIAI patients were primarily older (54 patients ≥6 years) with only 
six patients aged 2-6 years and none below 2 years. The cUTI patients were more evenly distributed across 
age cohorts. According to the EMA guideline EMEA/CHMP/EWP/147013/2004, PK information from one 
indication can be extrapolated to another indication if it can be assumed that the diseases and commonly 
used concomitant medications are not affecting the PK of the drug. The MAH showed that there is overlap by 
indication and similar concentration ranges by age group for the doses, and assessment of the paediatric 
dose normalized concentration data suggests that extrapolation across indications and age ranges is 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 26/167 
 
 
  
  
supported. However, the risk remains that optimal dosing was not established in the age group of 3 months 
to <6 months. The MAH informed that there was no evidence of overexposure or underexposure in this age 
group, and hence routine PhV was considered appropriate for monitoring. Besides, the information regarding 
the limited experience in this age group included in the SmPC Section 4.2 can mitigate the risk. The criteria 
of inclusion in the RMP as an important potential risk was thus not considered to be met.  
Only one paediatric patient with moderate renal impairment (NCrCL 30-50 mL/min/1.73m2, cohort 4, cUTI) 
was included in the phase II studies. Nine cIAI patients and 23 cUTI patients had mild renal impairment (≥50 
to <80 mL/min/1.73 m2). Twelve of the 23 cUTI patients were in cohort 4 where renal function maturation 
may be ongoing. No PK information is available for paediatric patients with severe renal impairment. 
In general, the allometric scaling of PK parameters (CL, V, Q) and the renal maturation function on CL in 
subjects <2 years is supported. During model development, the theoretically based allometric exponent of 
0.75 for CL and Q was changed to 0.67 – according to the Applicant – to better reflect the renal 
characteristics of CAZ and AVI in paediatric subjects (Hu et al. 2001). The allometric function for CL in the 
CAZ model was then further changed to an Emax model. However, theory and extensive confirmatory 
observation support an exponent of 0.75 that is believed to provide a stronger basis for predictions, 
especially for extrapolation from adults to children and small infants (Anderson and Holford 2009, EMA M&S 
Q&A3). The available paediatric data are likely too limited to confidently conclude that the allometric 
exponent is different from the theoretical value. Furthermore, the improved fit was apparently based only on 
statistical terms in terms of reduction in OFV, and was not supported by visual examinations (i.e. better 
predicted performance). As the final models appear to describe the data reasonably well (see below), the 
issue was not further pursued. 
Renal function maturation was modelled using the approach described by Rhodin et al. 2009, where the 
covariate CrCL on CAZ-AVI clearance is replaced with post-menstrual age (PMA). The current model is thus 
not  able  to  account  for  changes  in  CrCL  beyond  what  is  expected  based  on  PMA,  and  can  only  predict 
exposures in paediatric patients aged <2 years with CrCL values already represented in the popPK dataset. 
The issue is further addressed below, in the section “Special populations”.  
The division of APACHE II score into a binary variable of <10 vs ≥10 (as a marker of disease severity) was 
used in the prior adult modelling database. This was considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
For the simulations performed, it seems that representative in silico populations with variability in 
co-variates representing what is observed in studies or what would be expected in the target populations has 
been used, however the full range of covariates have clearly not been included (ie. renal function etc). 
Simulation results are presented further below under “Special populations”.  
For PTA simulations, the joint PKPD target of 50% fT>MIC at an MIC of 8 mg/L for CAZ and 50% fT>CT at 
a CT of 1 mg/L for AVI was employed for indications cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP. This is in line with the PKPD 
targets employed for the above-mentioned indications in adults.

Results 
Final model 
CAZ: 
The pooled paediatric and adult PK data for ceftazidime were described by a 2-compartment PK model with 
first-order elimination from the central compartment following IV infusion. Final popPK model (Run 77 and 
121) parameter estimates are presented in Table 8.  
Run 121 was a re-parameterised version of Run 77 (i.e. Emax covariate model constrained to 1 when WT 
was 70 kg). Run 121 achieved a lower condition number, reflecting a more precise determination of CL for 
the typical individual (7.75 L/h with an RSE of 1.56%). The OFV for Run 77 and 121 were similar 
(189896.2313 vs. 189896.2304, respectively) implying that the fits to the data were essentially the same. 
A subset of PK simulations and PTA calculations were re-run using Model 121 and confirmed that there were 
no numerical changes. 
The dependence of CL on kidney function as measured by NCrCL was modelled as a piecewise linear function 
derived from literature information (using CrCL):

Table 8. Parameter estimates for the final ceftazidime popPK model (Run 77 and Run 121)  
The median values of all the structural and covariate parameters from bootstrap resampling (N=200) were 
consistent with the original population PK estimates; all estimates were within the 90% confidence intervals. 
In the sensitivity analysis performed by including outliers (N=33), parameter estimates changed by <15%, 
however the additive error for phase II or III subjects changed by 44% and random effects on Vc, Q and Vp 
increased >40%. This significant impact of outliers on parameter estimates justified their continued 
exclusion. 
AVI: 
The pooled paediatric and adult PK data for avibactam were described by a 2-compartment disposition 
model with first-order elimination from the central compartment following IV infusion.

Table 9. Parameter Estimates for the Final Avibactam PopPK Model (Run 198)  
A piecewise function with an inflection point at 80 mL/min/1.73 m2 was employed to describe the 
relationship between NCrCL and CL: 
The avibactam CL estimate was 101% of the estimate in CAZ-MS-PED-01 and not statistically different. 
The median values of all the structural and covariate parameters from bootstrap resampling (N=200) were 
consistent with the original population PK estimates; all estimates were within the 90% confidence intervals. 
In the sensitivity analysis performed by including outliers (N=17), most parameter estimates changed by 
<15%. However, θ11 (population effect of cUTI on Vc) and θ12 (population effect of cIAI and NP Phase 3, 
and cIAI pediatric patients on Vc) changed by approximately 16% and 44%, respectively. This significant 
impact of outliers on parameter estimates justified their continued exclusion.

The CHMP noted that both CAZ and AVI models were described by a 2-compartment PK model with 
first-order elimination from the central compartment following IV infusion. Body weight and renal function 
were taken into account in the model and were the major covariates impacting on CAZ-AVI clearance and 
volume of distribution. Disease status (cIAI) resulted in a higher CL (33%/43%) compared to healthy 
subjects. Disease status (cIAI, cUTI) also affected central volumes of distributions for both models. 
Overall, fixed effects parameters were estimated with moderate precision (%RSE <30-40%). The 90% 
confidence intervals for final parameter estimates (see CAZ-MS-PED-02, Tables 15 and 20) would provide 
useful information about data consistency for covariate parameters from bootstrap resampling. 
The 90% confidence intervals for the final parameter estimates (see CAZ-MS-PED-02, Tables 15 and 20) 
were provided.  
Acceptable shrinkages were reported for CL in the CAZ-ASVI models (10.5%/6.8%) and for Vp in the AVI 
model (12%). However, the relatively high shrinkages of the central (50%/32%) and the peripheral (83%/-) 
volumes of distribution for CAZ-AVI, have not been discussed with respect to the potential impact on the 
eta-based diagnostics or the PTA simulations. The high shrinkage for volume of distribution was also 
observed in the original MAA, and was attributed to limited PK sampling in phase II-III clinical studies. The 
shrinkage in volume of distribution was at the time thought to mainly affect predicted concentrations in the 
elimination phase with limited impact on the validity of predictions. However, as volume of distribution in 
children, in particular in the youngest, is different than that of adults and as limited PK data in children are 
available, the high shrinkages confer uncertainty on the parameter and variability estimates and 
consequently to the results of the PTA analysis in the paediatric population. Shrinkage in the parameter 
estimates (although likely to be higher in children than adults due to sparser PK sampling) has been handled 
by re-inflating the post hoc etas for all subjects. With re-inflation, PTA increased by 2.5-5%, indicating that 
shrinkage has not had major influence on the conclusions derived from the PTA analyses.  
The continued exclusion of CAZ and AVI outliers, which comprised <0.1% of data, was supported by 
sensitivity analysis. Standard plots have been provided to evaluate the models. No obvious trends were 
observed in the random effects estimates vs continuous covariate plots for either model (not shown). The 
GoF plots indicate no major misfit of the CAZ model, however there is some indication of overestimation of 
variability, and the model performs less well over time (>1 dose interval). The clinical impact of the latter is 
not assumed to be of great importance as initial concentrations are the most important for PTA assessment. 
For the AVI model GoF plots similar observations are made. These tendencies are also visualised in the 
CAZ-AVI pcVPCs, with an overestimation of variability that is somewhat greater for the AVI model compared 
to the CAZ model. In general, the pcVPCs demonstrate a reasonable fit to the observed data for the overall 
adult and the paediatric population, and the median tendency is adequately predicted. pcVPCs, stratified by 
paediatric versus adult subjects, age, weight, NCrCL, and indication to assess the predictive performance of 
the model in each stratum, also demonstrate that the models overall capture the observed PK data (only 
pcVPCs stratified by age are shown). As discussed above, the shrinkage in the parameter estimates 
(although likely to be higher in children than adults due to sparser PK sampling) has been handled by 
re-inflating the post hoc etas for all subjects. With re-inflation, PTA increased by 2.5-5%, indicating that 
shrinkage has not had major influence on the conclusions derived from the PTA analyses. However, the 
Applicant then raised a different concern: that variability may rather be under-estimated because the 
methodology used for simulations was based on bootstrapping of post-hoc values, which are affected by 
parameter shrinkage. Potentially under-estimated variability is more concerning than potentially 
over-estimated variability because it will cause over-estimation of PTA. To account for this, the Applicant 
re-inflated all the random effects prior to using them for simulations. The shrinkage and required shrinkage 
adjustment was assumed to be similar in adults and children. This is questioned as PK sampling was 
generally more sparse in children, which in turn would lead to higher shrinkage in children and a need for 
Assessment report

Page 38/167 
 
 
  
  
 
 
more extensive shrinkage adjustment. Furthermore, the shrinkage adjustment was based on the 
model-reported shrinkage value, which is directly calculated from the model-estimated variability (which 
was overestimated) and should therefore be considered somewhat unreliable. Thus, there is some 
uncertainties with the PTA analyses. However, further analyses are not requested as part of this variation 
application as this is not expected to affect the overall conclusion. However, when the data from the ongoing 
HAP/VAP study becomes available and the PK bridge re-assessed, it is expected that this will be further 
addressed. The PTA analysis should then be conducted with further increased re-inflation of the random 
effects prior to PTA simulations to account for the likely underestimated PK variability. A discussion of 
relevant degrees of inflation should then be presented and it is recommended that a range of inflations is 
then explored to understand the sensitivity of the PTA simulations towards the variability. 
Special populations

Non-compartmental analysis 
D4280C00014 was a phase I, open-label, single-dose study in hospitalised paediatric patients from 3 
months to <18 years of age receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for suspected or confirmed infection, 
conducted to characterise the PK of CAZ and AVI and to assess the safety and tolerability following a single 
IV dose of CAZ-AVI. 
The study included four cohorts, each consisting of at least eight evaluable paediatric patients, aged ≥3 
months to <18 years, who were hospitalised with infections. Cohort 1 consisted of patients aged ≥12 to <18 
years, cohort 2 included patients aged ≥6 to <12 years, cohort 3 included patients aged ≥2 to <6 years, and 
cohort 4 patients aged ≥3 months to <2 years. A total of 35 patients were enrolled in the study and 32 
patients were included in in the PK analysis set. Each patient received a single IV dose of CAZ-AVI 
administered as a continuous infusion over a 2-hour period. 
The dose regimens of cohorts 1 and 2 were determined by Monte Carlo simulation of the CAZ and AVI 
exposure to approximately match that observed in adults. For cohorts 3 and 4, the PK data of CAZ-AVI from 
cohorts 1 and 2 of this study were used to update the PK model and determine the dose to be administered 
to younger patients (see section 5.3.4). Dosing regimens used in the study are listed in Table 5. All patients 
received concomitant antibiotic medication, most commonly clindamycin (15 patients), cephalosporins (11 
patients) and penicillins with or without beta-lactamase inhibitors (9 patients). 
The mean±SD plasma concentration-time profiles for CAZ overlapped and were comparable for each cohort 
1 to 4 (Figure 11). Mean plasma concentrations peaked at approximately 2 hours, which was at end of 
infusion. Also the mean±SD plasma concentration-time profiles for AVI overlapped and were comparable for 
each cohort 1 to 4 and mean plasma concentrations peaked at approximately 2 hours (Figure 12).

As shown in Figures above, the observed concentration profiles of ceftazidime and avibactam were similar in 
all four cohorts across sampling time points. 
PK parameters of CAZ and AVI for cohorts 1 and 2 are summarised below. In cohorts 1 and 2 CAZ had similar 
geometric mean Cmax and AUC values and the t1/2 of ceftazidime was similar; however, the CL, Vz, and Vss 
values were higher in cohort 1 than in cohort 2; the geometric mean body weight-normalised CL, Vz, and Vss 
values of CAZ appeared to be comparable for cohorts 1 and 2, although large variability was observed. In 
cohorts 1 and 2 AVI had similar geometric mean Cmax and AUC values and the t1/2 of avibactam was similar; 
however, the CL, Vz, and Vss values were higher in cohort 1 than in cohort 2; the geometric mean body 
weight-normalized CL, Vz, and Vss values of AVI appeared to be comparable for cohorts 1 and 2, although 
large variability was observed.

The CHMP noted that PK sampling in study D4280C00014 appeared to be less frequent in the two youngest 
cohorts. The PK sampling strategy for this study was outlined by the MAH as requested during the procedure. 
Caused by sparse sampling, CAZ-AVI PK parameters were not calculated for patients aged ≥3 months to <6 
years (cohorts 3 and 4) in the study, however acceptable model-derived population PK parameters were 
presented. 
C3591004/D4280C00015 was a phase II, single-blind, randomised, multi-centre, and actively controlled 
trial conducted in paediatric patients diagnosed with cIAIs of sufficient severity to require hospitalisation and 
treatment with IV antibiotics. Patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years with cIAIs were randomised 
in a 3:1 ratio to receive CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole or meropenem. Patients were allocated to 1 of 4 cohorts 
based on age (cohort 1: 12 to <18 years; cohort 2: 6 to <12 years; cohort 3: 2 to <6 years; cohort 4: 3 
months to <2 years). A total of 83 patients were enrolled, 61 were randomised to CAS-AVI plus 
metronidazole and 60 patients were included in the PK analysis. 
Patients received IV treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, i.e. 9 doses) before having the option 
to switch to an oral therapy on day 4. The total period of treatment (i.e. IV drug and oral switch treatment) 
was to be between 7 and 15 days. Patients could have remained on IV study treatment for the full 7 to 15 
days. Dosing regimens of CAZ-AVI in the study are listed in Table 5. 
Sparse PK sampling was conducted. On day 3 following a dose administration, blood samples (1 mL per 
sample for cohorts 1 and 2, and 0.5 mL per sample for cohort 3 and 4) for determination of ceftazidime and 
avibactam concentrations in plasma were obtained at the following time points: within 15 minutes prior to or 
after stopping CAZ-AVI infusion, between 30 and 90 minutes after stopping CAZ-AVI infusion, and between 
5 and 6 hours after stopping CAZ-AVI infusion. 
Median plasma concentrations of CAZ and AVI at Day 3 were similar across age cohorts 1 to 3 (Table 11 and 
Table 12). No patients from cohort 4 received CAZ-AVI, therefore no plasma concentration data are available 
for this cohort.

C3591005/D4280C00016 was a phase 2, single-blind, randomised, multi-centre, and actively controlled 
trial conducted in hospitalised paediatric patients diagnosed with cUTIs. Patients aged from 3 months to <18 
years with cUTI were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive CAZ-AVI or cefepime. Patients were allocated to 
1 of 4 cohorts based on age (cohort 1: 12 to <18 years; cohort 2: 6 to <12 years; cohort 3: 2 to <6 years; 
cohort 4: 3 months to <2 years). A total of 101 patients were enrolled and 68 were randomised to CAS-AVI. 
Patients received IV treatment for a minimum of 72 hours. CAZ-AVI doses were based on the age and weight 
of the patient with adjustment according to renal function and were designed to match adult exposures and 
PK/PD target attainment.  
In this study, sparse PK sampling was included, too. On day 3 following a dose administration, blood samples 
were obtained within 15 minutes prior to or after stopping CAZ-AVI infusion, between 30 and 90 minutes 
after stopping CAZ-AVI infusion, and between 5 and 6 hours after stopping CAZ-AVI infusion. 
Median observed plasma concentrations of CAZ and AVI on Day 3 were similar across age cohorts, although 
concentrations were lower for trough samples in Cohort 3 and lower for samples taken near the end of 
infusion in Cohort 4 (Table 13 and Table 14).

The CHMP acknowledged that in cIAI patients (study C3591005) median plasma concentrations of CAZ and 
AVI at Day 3 were similar across age cohorts 1 to 3. There were no patients in cohort 4 and only 6 patients 
in cohort 3 receiving CAZ-AVI, thus very limited PK data from patients < 6 years with cIAIs are available. In 
the PK model, patients with cIAI had higher CL for both CAZ and AVI compared to healthy subjects. 
In cUTI patients (study C3591005) median observed plasma concentrations of CAZ and AVI on Day 3 were 
similar across age cohorts, although concentrations were lower for trough samples in Cohort 3 and lower for 
samples taken near the end of infusion in Cohort 4.

Individual model-predicted exposures 
Individual model predicted exposures and PTA (using joint PKPD target) in paediatric patients from the two 
phase II studies are presented below (Table 16 and Table 17). Model-predicted AUCss,0-24 values for both 
CAZ and AVI were generally similar to the corresponding adult population, with geometric mean values from 
most study cohorts deviating from adults by ± 15%. Mean Cmin,ss values were lower in all paediatric cohorts 
than in the corresponding adult reference populations, and mean Cmax,ss values for CAZ and AVI tended to be 
higher in paediatric patients than in adults. 
In study C3591004, model-predicted CAZ geometric mean Cmax,ss for each age cohort ranged from 102% 
(12 to <18 years) to 122% (6 to <12 years) and AUCss,0-24 ranged from 84% to 101% of corresponding 
values for adults with cIAI. Model-predicted AVI geometric mean Cmax,ss for each age cohort ranged from 
89% to 128% and AUCss,0-24 ranged from 79% to 110% of corresponding values for adults with cIAI. 
In study C3591005, model-predicted CAZ geometric mean Cmax,ss for each age cohort ranged from 114% to 
145% and AUCss,0-24h ranged from 76% to 102% of corresponding values for adults with cUTI. 
Model-predicted AVI geometric mean Cmax,ss for each age cohort ranged from 102% to 139% and AUCss,0-24h 
ranged from 81% to 110% of corresponding for adults with cUTI.

Simulations to support paediatric dose recommendations 
Simulated CAZ and AVI exposures (1000 subjects per age group, indication and renal function group) are 
presented in the Tables below. In the updated popPK model (CAZ-MS-PED-02), the paediatric PK data from 
phase 2 studies (C3591004 and C3591005) and Study D4280C00014 were pooled with PK data from adults 
(phase 1 to phase 3). Overall, the predicted exposures for CAZ and AVI at the proposed dose regimens were 
similar to the predicted exposures in adult patients receiving the labelled CAZ-AVI dose.

Table 19. Mean ceftazidime and avibactam Cmax,ss and AUCss,0-24 in 1000 simulated patients 
with cIAI, cUTI, or HAP/VAP and normal renal function following repeated administration with 
CAZ-AVI by age group (Module 2.7.2, Table 7) 
The CHMP noted that the aim of the dose selection in paediatric patients was to achieve comparable 
exposures to that of adult patients with cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP. For ceftazidime-avibactam, limited PK 
sampling was performed in paediatric subjects with cIAI and cUTI, and comparisons rely on individual 
model-predicted exposures and simulations for cIAI and cUTI indications, and only on simulations for 
HAP/VAP indication.  
Of note, no PK data are currently available in paediatric patients with HAP/VAP. An ongoing study will provide 
exposure data from HAP/VAP patients 3 months old to 18 years of age. The applicant’s extrapolation 
strategy for this indication was thus based on popPK/PTA simulations, using adult datasets across 3 
approved indications (cIAI, cUTI, and HAP/VAP) and PK data from paediatric patients with cUTI and cIAI. Of 
note, paediatric patients with cUTI had severe infections requiring IV treatment. This strategy is acceptable 
to the CHMP, as paediatric PK data for at least two type of infections are available, including from cUTI 
patients with severe infections. 
Overall, individually predicted and simulated paediatric exposures do not differ greatly from that of adults for 
cIAI and cUTI. For HAP/VAP, simulated paediatric exposures were also overall comparable to the adult 
exposures.  
The cIAI population aged 1-6 years appears to have the lower exposure than the other subgroups, which is 
also reflected in the PTA analysis. For both active compounds the predicted exposures show a higher Cmax

and lower Cmin (trough) in the paediatric population compared to the adult population, although the total 
exposure (AUC) seem to be similar. This can be interpreted as the time above MIC is shorter which in turn 
could be the reason for the lower PTA in the age group 1-6 years. See below for further assessment. 
The requested graphical presentations of simulated exposure metrics (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by age, body 
weight and renal function were provided by the MAH. In retrospect, they are not considered very 
informative. Rather Cmin should have been presented, and sensitivity analysis on the PTA simulations with 
higher shrinkage adjustments, than the used adult values, should have been performed to explore the 
potential impact of the uncertainties. However, this was not further pursued, as it was not expected to 
further inform the conclusion on the dosing regimen.  
The MAH has not pre-specified acceptance limits for similarity of exposure. In general, such acceptance 
limits should be discussed, and pre-set, in relation to the therapeutic window of the medicinal product. 
Additional considerations toward the variability in a sparse sampling setting in a paediatric population must 
also be made. The MAH selected AUC0-24 and Cmax as the primary exposure metrics. However, in smaller 
children there is a risk that similar AUC may be observable, while Cmax may be higher and Cmin lower. As 
this may affect the PTA, it is of value to compare the simulated PTAs for the various cohorts.  
Even so, the comparability of exposure levels in children does demonstrate roughly similarity of exposures. 
In brief, the MAH provided several methods of comparing the exposure profiles in children of the various age 
cohorts to that of adults;  
- observed plasma concentrations,  
- estimated NCA for cohorts 1 and 2, 
- simulated exposure metric data (AUC0-24 and Cmax) for all cohorts, 
- simulations of PTA for all cohorts.  
The two latter comparisons depend on a credible model (population-PK model) for the simulations. The MAH 
provided model diagnostics for the paediatric model, which was assessed as part of the initial AR. The model 
is considered low to moderately credible for its context of use. With this background, the exposure metrics 
and the PTA does support that the proposed posology will provide adequate exposure levels, while not 
exceeding the exposure to a level where harm to patients is expected. While the exposure-response 
relationship of ceftazidime/avibactam is not explicitly presented, the therapeutic window of ceftazidime is 
known to be rather wide and the main risk to patients and society is underexposure (lack of effect and risk 
of bacterial resistance). However, there are sources of uncertainty on 1) the exposure levels in the younger 
age cohorts, 2) specifically in cIAI below 2 years and 3) in patients with moderate to severely reduced renal 
function that cannot be relieved by the available data.  
The totality of the data and the consideration that ceftazidime is approved for use in children, with dosing 
recommendations down to birth, allows for concluding that the proposed dosing recommendations are 
adequate and that the exposures are sufficiently similar to allow preceding with extrapolation of safety and 
efficacy.  
- Renal impairment 
Non-compartmental analysis 
CAZ and AVI are eliminated by the kidneys, therefore, the dose should be reduced according to the degree 
of renal impairment (SmPC, Zavicefta). In the studies D4280C00014 and C3591004, all patients had 
normal or mildly reduced renal function (CrCl values > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2). In study C3591005 the 
majority of patients (66.3%) had CrCl values at baseline in the normal range of > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2,

31.6% of the patients had mild renal insufficiency with CrCl values >50 to <80 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 2.1% 
had CrCl values >30 to <50 mL/min/1.73 m2. No patients had a CrCl value <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Thus, the 
experience with pediatric patients with moderately or severe reduced renal function is limited.

Simulations to support paediatric dose recommendations in renal impairment 
Simulated mean CAZ-AVI Cmax,ss and AUCss,0-24 in peadiatric patients with mild and moderate renal 
impairment are compared to adults exposures in the below table. Mean CAZ Cmax,ss and AUCss,0-24 values 
in paediatric patients with moderate renal impairment receiving the proposed dose were 91-107% and 
117-140%, respectively, of the mean values in adults with normal renal function. Corresponding AVI values 
were 93-120% and 116-148%, respectively. 
Mean CAZ Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and AUCss,0-24 values in paediatric patients (cUTI, cIAI, NP) with severe renal 
impairment receiving 18.75 / 4.75 mg / kg q12h were 78-95%, 176-271% and 104-124%, respectively, of 
the mean values in adults with normal renal function. Corresponding mean AVI values were 83-104%, 
190-330% and 104-131%, respectively. 
No dosage adjustment is considered necessary for paediatric patients with cIAI or cUTI and mild renal 
impairment.

There are insufficient paediatric PK data to recommend a dose adjustment in severe renal impairment. In 
addition, because renal function in children <2 years was modelled as a function of PMA rather than NCrCL, 
and because renal impairment categories are not clearly defined in this age range, no dosing 
recommendations are made for paediatric patients <2 years with renal impairment.

The CHMP considered that, as ceftazidime/avibactam is primarily renally excreted, dosing recommendations 
in renal impairment is required.  
Mild impairment 
No adjustment of the dose has been suggested for mild renal impairment in paediatric patients. This is in line 
with the recommendation for Zavicefta in adults as well as for ceftazidime as monocomponent in children 
and is considered justified by the Committee.  
Moderate to severe impairment in children 2 to <18 years 
A 50% reduction of dose is proposed in moderate renal impairment for patients 2 to <18 years, which is 
similar to the corresponding dosing recommendation in adults.  
Initially with this pediatric extension variation, no dosing recommendations was given by the MAH for 
paediatric patients 2 to <18 years with severe renal impairment (NCrCL <30 mL/min/1.73m2) due to lack of 
PK and safety data in this subpopulation. As preexisting renal impairment could be expected also in the 
target paediatric population, dosing recommendations in these subgroups are desirable. By comparison, 
dosing recommendations are made for all renal function categories in children aged 2 months to <18 years 
for CAZ single substance medicinal products, in adults for Zavicefta, and in paediatric (<2 years) and adult 
populations for the FDA-approved AVYCAZTM (CAZ-AVI). 
Very limited CAZ-AVI PK data are available for paediatric patients with moderate to severe impaired renal 
function; i.e. only one patient with moderate (cohort 4, cUTI) and no patients with severe renal impairment 
were included in the paediatric phase II studies. Consequently, the recommendation in moderate renal 
impairment is primarily based on adult PK data. Although not a validated assumption, it is considered 
reasonable to expect a similar relationship between CrCL and CAZ-AVI clearance in children (aged 2 years 
and older) and adults when accounting for body weight.). Simulations of exposures and PTA analysis have 
been provided for patients aged 2 to <18 years with both moderate and severe renal impairment 
demonstrating a good PTA of >97% at investigated doses (25 mg / 6.25 mg/kg q8h and 18.75 mg / 4.75 
mg/kg q12h, respectively). 
Dosing  recommendations  were  then  proposed  for  paediatric  patients  aged  2-<18  years  with  NCrCL  <30 
mL/min/1.73m2:  
16 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: 18.75/4.75 mg/kg q12h  
6 to 15 mL/min/1.73 m2: 18.75/4.75 mg/kg q24h 
< 5 mL/min/1.73 m2: 18.75/4.75 mg/kg q24h 
The dosing recommendation is considered justified based on exposure comparisons and PTA analysis. 
Dosing based on NCrCL in paediatric subjects is considered justified.  All modelling and simulation work for 
the CAZ-AVI paediatric programme used NCrCL. Inclusion/exclusion and dosing in the paediatric CAZ-AVI 
studies were based on the use of the “bedside Schwartz” equation giving estimated creatinine clearance in 
mL/min/1.73m2, and for paediatric subjects, GFR is usually expressed as mL/min/1.73m2. Dosing for drugs 
that  are  renally  cleared  often  express  paediatric  dosing  with  creatinine  clearance  expressed  in 
mL/min/1.73m2 to reflect clinical practice.  
More data on CAZ-AVI in paediatric patients with reduced renal function are expected from the two ongoing 
paediatric studies. The MAH proposed to add pre-existing moderate to severe renal impairment in the 
paediatric population as additional missing information in the RMP (section 2.7.).

Moderate to severe renal impairment in children 3 months to 2 years 
Initially with this pediatric extension variation, no dosing recommendations were proposed by the MAH for 
paediatric patients <2 years with impaired renal function (≤50 mL/min/1.73m2). The MAH justified this from 
the chosen popPK model structure (maturation function on CL instead of NCrCL) and lack of definition of 
renal impairment categories in this subgroup.  
For background, PDCO requested simulations for paediatric subjects <2 years of age with mild and moderate 
renal impairment as part of the PIP partial compliance check (EMEA-C2-001313-PIP01-12-M08). These 
simulations were performed based on inclusion of an adjustment factor (AF) for mild and moderate renal 
impairment (mean [range] AF for AVI: 0.71 [0.55; 0.88] and 0.44 (0.33; 0.55), respectively; mean [range] 
AF for CAZ: 0.63 [0.49; 0.78] and 0.39 [0.29; 0.49], respectively). Following the request by CHMP the 
applicant submitted simulations for PK and PTA for paediatric subject <2 years of age with mild renal 
impairment was performed for the same doses proposed for normal renal function. For patients with cIAI or 
cUTI and mild renal impairment, Cmax,ss and AUCss,0-24h values for CAZ were similar and for AVI were 
slightly higher (within 126%) for all age categories <2 years compared to adults with mild renal impairment. 
Cmin values are similar for AVI but lower for CAZ for paediatric patients with cIAI compared to adults with

mild renal impairment while continuing to achieve a high PTA (>99%). Simulations have not been shown for 
NP but exposures and joint PTA are expected to be similar to cUTI.

As requested by CHMP during assessment of this procedure, potential dosing recommendation in children 
<2years of age have been explored and model assumptions and uncertainties associated with predictions of 
exposure in patients <2 years with renal impairment discussed. Addition of NCrCl as a covariate on CL in 
addition to the Rhodin model of renal maturation did not improve the model fit. This indicates that only 
maturation processes affected the renal function of the patients <2years included in the study, and that

none (but the one declared) were renally impaired by pathologic means. However, with only one patient <2 
years in the data set being renally impaired, the lack of an improvement in model fit when adding NCrCl as 
a covariate should not be used to conclude that patients <2 years with renal impairment do not need a lower 
dose. It is agreed that there are uncertainties coming from the lack of data in patients with reduced renal 
function. However, considering that dosing recommendations are given for ceftazidime as monotherapy in 
children down to 2mo, that the exposure of avibactam has been shown to be roughly parallel to that of 
ceftazidime also in this age cohort, and that the conducted simulations support adequate PTAs for the 
investigated dosing regimens, dosing recommendations should be given for patients below 2years of age 
with moderate to severe renal impairment. As requested in the second RSI, the applicant has re-discussed 
the dosing recommendations in children below 2 years with reduced renal function. Section 4.2 of the SmPC 
have been revised to include dosing recommendations for children 3 months to 2 years of age with CrCL ≥ 
16 mL/min/1.73 m2. Further, it is stated that there is insufficient information to recommend a dosage 
regimen for paediatric patients < 2 years of age that have a CrCL < 16 mL/min/1.73 m2. This has been 
appropriately reflected in the amended Section 4.2 of the SmPC. The revised dosing recommendations are 
considered appropriate by the CHMP.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary pharmacology 
The microbiology profile of CAZ-AVI was extensively described in the original MAA, and is reflected in the 
approved prescribing information for Zavicefta. The in vitro activity of CAZ-AVI against isolates from 
paediatric patients has been shown to be similar against isolates of the same species in adult patients 
(INFORM 2017 European Report). 
The CHMP acknowledged that CAZ-AVI has demonstrated potent in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae 
and P. aeruginosa isolates collected globally from paediatric patients in 2012-2017, regardless of infection 
site.4  
PK/PD Indices and Targets from Nonclinical Data 
The relevant PK/PD indices for CAZ and AVI, and the magnitudes of these indices related to the efficacy of 
CAZ-AVI, were described in the original MAA and are briefly summarised below. 
It is well established that the PK/PD index that best describes the antibacterial activity of CAZ is %fT > MIC. 
Andes and Craig (2002) showed that approximately 30% fT > MIC of CAZ was related to bacteriostasis over 
24 hours for Enterobacteriaceae in the neutropenic mouse lung infection model, and a bactericidal effect of 
2 to 3 log10 killing was achieved by roughly 50% fT > MIC. For P. aeruginosa, stasis was achieved in the 
neutropenic thigh infection model at about 40% fT > MIC of CAZ. Muller et al analysed clinical study data for 
a dose of 2 g CAZ administered q8h as a 2-hour infusion in patients with nosocomial pneumonia, including 
VAP, from whom Gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa, were cultured. The authors concluded that 
plasma exposures to CAZ predicted clinical and microbiological outcomes and that a %fT > MIC of ≥45% 
was associated with a favourable outcome. MacVane et al conducted a retrospective E-R analysis of CAZ and 
cefepime in patients with VAP due to Gram-negative bacilli from previous studies. A similar result was found 
in that ≥53% fT > MIC of CAZ or cefepime was associated with microbiological eradication or presumed 
eradication. As 50% fT > MIC for CAZ and other cephalosporins is an established target associated with 
4 Hackel et al. 2019 In vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa collected from paediatric patients as part of the ATLAS Global Surveillance Program 2012-2017. Abstract P1146 29thECCMID,

efficacy and setting of breakpoints, this was used as the target plasma exposure for CAZ (with AVI). Based 
on global surveillance studies, the approved breakpoint for CAZ-AVI of ≤8 mg/L includes ≥90% of clinical 
isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. 
The relevant PK/PD index for AVI was shown, both in vitro using hollow-fiber models and in vivo using animal 
models of infection, to be the %fT > CT. In the hollow-fiber model using CAZ-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 
a minimum CT of 0.5 mg/L AVI was shown to be appropriate for estimating PTA for CAZ-AVI. Using the 
neutropenic mouse thigh infection model with P. aeruginosa, a mean %fT > CT of 40% for a CT of 1 mg/L AVI 
was associated with bacterial stasis, and a mean %fT > CT of 50% for a CT of 1 mg/L was associated with 
1-log kill. Additionally, using the neutropenic mouse lung infection model with P. aeruginosa, the mean %fT 
> CT values for a CT of 1 mg/L associated with stasis, 1-log kill, and 2-log kill were 20%, 24%, and 30%, 
respectively. 
A conservative target of 1 mg/L (i.e. the value determined as the most appropriate for P. aeruginosa) was 
set for the CT of AVI. As the role of AVI is to protect CAZ during the period CAZ is most active, the %fT > CT 
must be at least the same period of time that the concentration of the β-lactam needs to be above the MIC. 
Thus, the overall target exposure for CAZ-AVI was simultaneously achieving 50% fT > MIC at an MIC of 8 
mg/L for CAZ (with AVI) while maintaining 50% fT > CT of 1 mg/L for AVI as was used in the initial (adult) 
MAA. 
The CHMP noted that no new in vitro studies were submitted. There are no expected differences in the 
mechanism of action of CAZ-AVI based on age as the Gram-negative causative pathogens are similar in 
adults and children. The conservative joint PKPD target (i.e. 50% fT>MIC of 8 mg/L and 50% fT>CT of 1 
mg/L), identical to the PKPD target used to assess PTA in adults (cUTI, cIAI and HAP/VAP), have been 
employed for PTA simulations in children. This was acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Selection of Phase II dose based on PTA analysis 
The popPK model CAZ-MS-06 were updated with data from the phase I study D4280C00014 (described in 
section 2.3.2). The popPK models of CAZ and AVI were then used to quantify % fT>MIC (CAZ) and % fT>CT 
(AVI). A joint PK/PD target of 50% time above 8 mg/L for CAZ and 50% time above 1.0 mg/L for AVI, was 
selected as the primary criterion. This investigation informed the dose selection in the clinical phase II 
studies. The primary CAZ-AVI dose regimen for paediatric subjects was 50/12.5 mg/kg (capped at 2000/500 
mg), given as a 2-hour IV infusion q8h. Two additional dose regimens, 40/10 mg/kg and 30/7.5 mg/kg were 
also evaluated for Cohorts 2–4 paediatric patients. Three reduced dose regimens were considered for 
paediatric subjects with moderate renal impairment (i.e. 50% of the daily dose administered either q8h or 
q12h, and 33% of the total daily dose administered q12h). 
For Cohort 1 patients with normal renal function receiving 2000/500 mg q8h and Cohort 2–4 patients with 
normal renal function receiving the 50/12.5 mg/kg q8h regimen capped at 2000/500 mg, predicted PTA 
rates were >90%. Neither of the alternate lower dose regimens (40/10 mg/kg q8h and 30/7.5 mg/kg q8h) 
consistently achieved 90% PTA in Cohorts 2–4. For pediatric patients with mild renal impairment, predicted 
PTA was >97% for all dose regimens and all cohorts. For dose adjustment 1 (50% of daily dose for normal 
subjects administered q8h) in pediatric patients with moderate renal impairment, predicted PTA was >99% 
for the highest dose level (1000/250 mg in Cohort 1, 25/6.25 mg/kg in Cohorts 2–4 capped at 1000/250 
mg). Exposures for these regimens were predicted to be within 30% of adult cIAI patients with mild renal 
impairment. Lower PTA, but still exceeding 95%, was predicted for the alternate lower dose levels (20/5 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 58/167 
 
 
  
  
 
mg/kg, 15/3.75 mg/kg) for Cohorts 2–4. The other investigated dose levels (50%/q12h and 33%/q12h 
normal dose) achieved PTA >90% for some but not all age cohorts. 
Simulation of exposure and PTA analyses following Phase II studies 
Individual model-predicted PTA using joint PKPD target (i.e. 50%fT > MIC of 8 mg/L and 50%fT > CT of 1 
mg/L) in paediatric patients included in the two phase II studies were >94% (CAZ-MS-PED-02, see section 
2.3.2). Regardless of the apparent reductions in predicted Cmin,ss values relative to the adult population, PTA 
at an MIC of 8 mg/L for CAZ-AVI remained high across age cohorts in studies C3591004 and C3591005. If 
considered in aggregate, only three paediatric patients out of the 153 included in this analysis failed to 
achieve joint target attainment, translating to an overall joint attainment rate of 98.0%. 
The final popPK models were also used to conduct paediatric and adult simulations (1000 subjects per age 
group, indication and renal function group) to support paediatric dose recommendations. Sets of PK 
parameters were simulated with between-subject variability but not parameter uncertainty or residual 
variability. Between-subject variability was simulated non-parametrically through resampling of individual 
random effect estimates from the final CAZ and AVI models for adults and for paediatric subjects. Because 
shrinkage of the random effect has the potential to underestimate between-subject variability, the post-hoc 
random effect estimates were re-inflated using the shrinkage estimates reported by NONMEM prior to 
simulation. Simulated plasma concentrations were adjusted to reflect free drug concentrations (85% and 
92% for CAZ and AVI, respectively). The following joint PKPD targets were considered to be of principle 
interest when evaluating the proposed dose regimens, of which, the most stringent target (T4) was 
considered to be the primary criterion and was also used in adult regulatory filings (CAZ-MS-09) and in the 
initial paediatric modelling investigations (CAZ-MS-PED-01): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
T1: 40% fT > MIC for CAZ and 40% fT > 0.5 mg/L for AVI 
T2: 50% fT > MIC for CAZ and 50% fT > 0.5 mg/L for AVI 
T3: 40% fT > MIC for CAZ and 40% fT > 1.0 mg/L for AVI 
T4: 50% fT > MIC for CAZ and 50% fT > 1.0 mg/L for AVI 
Targets T1- T4 were computed for CAZ-AVI MIC values of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 
mg/L. 
Normal renal function 
PTA from the simulations at an MIC of 8 mg/L, which is the breakpoint for CAZ-AVI for Enterobacteriaceae 
and P. aeruginosa, is shown in the table below by age group and indication for patients with normal renal 
function receiving the doses used in studies C3591004 and C3591005. 
Lower PTAs of 82% for cIAI patients aged 1 to <6 years can be attributed to the following: 1) cIAI patients 
(adult and paediatric) have 33% increased CAZ CL on average; 2) weight based scaling of CL (Emax model) 
results in higher CAZ CL in younger children; and 3) there were very limited data for cIAI patients ≤6 years 
in study C3591004 (6 patients >2 to ≤6 years, 0 patients >1 to ≤2 years). Given a PTA of >80% in 
simulated cIAI patients from 1 to <6 years, and >90% for all other age ranges at an MIC of 8 mg/L, and 
considering that the PTA for actual cIAI patients <6 years in study C3591004 was 100% at this MIC, the 
proposed CAZ-AVI dose of 50 / 12.5 mg/kg q8h (2-hour infusion) may still be appropriate. To improve PTA 
at an MIC of 8 mg/L the infusion time could be extended. A dose of 50 / 12.5 mg/kg q8h administered as a 
3- hour infusion is predicted to result in a PTA of 95% for cIAI patients from 1 to <6 years, with the same 
predicted AUCss,0-24 and 20% less Cmax,ss compared to the same dose given as a 2-hour infusion for both CAZ 
and AVI.

Table 23. Percentage of 1000 simulated patients with cIAI, cUTI or HAP/VAP and normal renal 
function achieving the joint PK/PD target following repeated administration of CAZ-AVI 
(Module 2.7.2, Table 8) 
The simulated joint PTA rates are slightly lower than the predictions in CAZ-MS-PED-01 because the 
simulated pediatric subjects in CAZ-MS-PED-01 were not different to healthy adults, whereas the present 
analysis simulated PK with disease covariates for cUTI, cIAI, and NP patients. The covariate effects of cUTI, 
cIAI, or NP on CL, which all lead to higher clearance of CAZ and AVI compared to healthy subjects lead to 
systematically lower joint PTA rates here compared to CAZ-MS-PED-01. The PTA for these doses is predicted 
to be similar to the PTA for adult patients with cIAI and cUTI, and efficacy from adult patients can therefore 
be extrapolated to paediatric patients with cIAI and cUTI given the similar prevalence and CAZ-AVI 
susceptibility of key pathogens in paediatric and adult patients. 
The CHMP acknowledged that, for almost all paediatric subgroups, acceptable PTAs of >90% were achieved 
at the proposed dosing regimens using the same conservative joint PKPD target as employed for simulations 
in adults (for indications cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP), which is reassuring with regards to efficacy. However, 
lower model-predicted exposures and a PTA of only 82% were observed in cIAI patients aged 1 to <6 years. 
The Applicant claims that this can be due to the higher CAZ clearance (33%) in cIAI patients (including both 
paediatric and adult patients) compared to healthy subjects as well as the popPK model structure (i.e. 
weight-based scaling of clearance). Additionally, there are limited PK data based on 6 patients in the cIAI 
age group 1-6 years. Simulations suggest that PTA could be improved to 95% by prolonging the infusion 
time to 3 hours with comparable AUC0-24,ss and a 20% decrease in Cmax compared to a 2-hour infusion. 
However, there are no clinical data available with this prolonged infusion time. 
As stated by the MAH, PTA for actual cIAI patients <6 years in study C3591004 (n=6) was 100% at the joint 
target. Additionally, the slightly lower PTA is not considered to be of major concern due to the following: (i) 
the individual model-predicted PTA was supportive, (ii) the PDT against which PTA was estimated was 1-log 
kill while stasis might have sufficed for cIAI, and (iii) clinical outcomes of cIAI are strongly driven by 
adequate surgery. In addition, the proposed dose regimen for this age group is consistent with doses for 
other indications for CAZ-AVI. Of note, the proposed ceftazidime dose in the CAZ-AVI combination for 
paediatric patients (including the subgroup of 1-6 years) is also consistent with the approved paediatric 
posology for CAZ alone, for which there is an extensive experience with the use in children. 
Overall, the CHMP considered the proposed dose regimen of 50/12.5 mg CAZ-AVI for patients aged 1-6 
years with cIAI to be acceptable. 
Renal impairment 
PTA from the simulations at an MIC of 8 mg/L for CAZ-AVI is shown in the table below by age group and 
indication for patients with mild renal impairment receiving the doses used in Studies C3591004 and 
C3591005. Given the high PTA (≥99%), and similar exposure to adults with mild renal impairment, no

dosage adjustment is considered necessary for paediatric patients with cIAI or cUTI and mild renal 
impairment. Extended infusion time for cIAI patients 2 to <6 years with mild renal impairment is not 
necessary to achieve PTA >90%.

PTA from the simulations at an MIC of 8 mg/L is shown in the table below by age group and indication for 
patients with moderate renal impairment receiving CAZ-AVI 25 / 6.25 mg/kg q8h as a 2-hour infusion 
(capped at 1000 / 250 mg). Extended infusion time for cIAI patients from 2 to < 6 years with moderate renal 
impairment is not necessary to achieve PTA >90%.

renal impairment achieving the joint PK/PD target following repeated administration of 
CAZ-AVI (Module 2.7.2, Table 12) 
The CHMP noted that PTA ≥99% are predicted with the proposed dose recommendations in mild, moderate 
and severe renal impairment. Dosing recommendations have been given in the SmPC. However, there is 
insufficient information to recommend a dosage regimen for paediatric patients < 2 years of age that have 
a CrCL < 16 mL/min/1.73 m2. This has been appropriately reflected in the amended Section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. For details, see Section 2.3.2. 
Clinical trials 
Study C3591004 (cIAI) 
Overall, favourable clinical and microbiological response cure rates of ≥90% were observed for CAZ-AVI + 
metronidazole (MTZ)-treated CAZ-AVI cIAI patients from the End of 72 Hours Visit through late follow-up 
(LFU). High favourable microbiological response rates for predominant pathogens (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) 
were also observed; although few in number, favourable response rates were also observed in the two 
patients with CAZ-NS pathogens. These results are consistent with data from adult patients with cIAIs. 
Study C3591005 (cUTI) 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020

Favourable clinical response cure rates of >80% were observed for CAZ-AVI-treated paediatric patients with 
cUTI from the End of 72 Hours Visit through to the LFU Visit for the majority of the analysis sets. For 
Enterobacteriaceae, favourable microbiological response rates of approximately 80% or greater were 
observed for CAZ-AVI through test of cure, which included patients with CAZ-NS pathogens. These results 
are consistent with data from adult patients with cUTIs. 
Overall, in both Study C3591004 and C3591005, the treatment effects in paediatric patients were consistent 
with the treatment effects observed in the corresponding studies in adult patients with cIAI and cUTI 
(Studies D4280C0001/5 and D4280C0002/4, respectively). Although the number of patients in some 
cohorts was small, the microbiological responses were similar amongst the cohorts in either study. 
Additionally, there were no new safety issues identified in either paediatric study. 
Resistance development 
Efficacy and safety, as well as microbiological susceptibility in the phase II clinical studies are addressed in 
sections 2.4 and 2.5. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
- Pharmacokinetics 
With this application, the MAH is extending all four adult indications (cUTI, cIAI, HAP/VAP and aerobic 
Gram-negative infections in patients with limited treatment options) to children and adolescents ≥3 months 
to <18 years. The variation application is supported by one phase I (D4280C00014) and two phase II studies 
(C3591004 and C3591005), as well as PK and PKPD modeling and simulation. 
The proposed CAZ-AVI dose in patients aged 6 months to <18 years is 50/12.5 mg/kg q8h (capped at the 
adult dose of 2 g/0.5 g) as a 2-hour infusion. In patients aged 3 to <6 months, the proposed dose is 40/10 
mg/kg q8h as a 2-hour infusion. Dose adjustments are recommended for paediatric patients ≥2 years with 
impaired renal function (31 to <50 mL/min/1.73m2) (see below). The proposed paediatric doses were used 
in the clinical phase II studies (C3591004 and C3591005) in patients with cIAI and cUTI, respectively. 
Sparse PK sampling was conducted in both studies, also from severely ill cUTI patients. The formulation used 
for the phase II paediatric studies is identical to the final drug product for commercial use. 
The aim of the dose selection was to achieve comparable exposures to those calculated for the phase III 
studies in adult patients with cIAI, and cUTI and HAP/VAP. 
Bioanalytical methods 
The analytical methods submitted to support the new phase II clinical studies have been adequately 
validated in accordance with the EMA bioanalytical guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1). The 
analysis of PK samples from the phase II studies and phase I study are acceptable.  
Population-PK model 
To support dosing recommendations in the new target population, popPK models describing CAZ and AVI PK 
in adults have been modified and updated with available paediatric PK data from the three clinical studies 
(C3591004, C3591005 and D4280C00014) to predict exposure in both adults and children <18 years old. 
The preceding models are overall similar to the updated model (CAZ-MS-PED-02) in the structural and 
co-variate models, (i.e. linear two-compartmental models with first order elimination) and with CLCr and 
body weight as important covariates on CL and V, respectively, for both CAZ and AVI models. Patient 
population (cIAI and cUTI) was identified as a significant covariate impacting CL and/or Vc of CAZ and AVI, 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 62/167 
 
 
  
  
independent of any demographic differences. Overall, the predictive performance of the updated CAZ-AVI 
models are supportive of their intended use.  
Exposure data and popPK/PTA simulations 
- cIAI and cUTI 
In general, individually predicted and simulated paediatric exposures do not differ greatly from that of 
adults. In studies C3591004 and C3591005, model-predicted CAZ geometric mean Cmax,ss for each age 
cohort ranged from 97% to 145% and AUCss,0-24 ranged from 76% to 101% of corresponding values for 
adults. Model-predicted AVI geometric mean Cmax,ss for each age cohort ranged from 89% to 139% and 
AUCss,0-24 ranged from 79% to 110% of corresponding values for adults. Mean Cmin,ss values were lower in all 
paediatric cohorts than in the corresponding adult reference populations. Simulated geometric mean 
exposures (Cmax,ss and AUCss,0-24) ranged from 109% to 124% and from 92% to 110%, respectively, for CAZ. 
Corresponding values for AVI exposure were 115 to 148% and 104 to 130%.  
For almost all paediatric subgroups with cIAI and cUTI, PTAs of >90% were achieved at the proposed doses 
using the same conservative joint PKPD target as employed in the original MAA for adults, which is 
reassuring with regards to efficacy. However, lower model-predicted exposures and a PTA of 82% were 
shown in cIAI patients aged 1 to <6 years. Of note, there is limited data in cIAI subjects ≤6 years (n=6). For 
both active compounds the predicted exposures show a higher Cmax and lower Cmin (trough) in the 
paediatric population compared to the adult population, although the total exposure (AUC) appear to be 
similar. This can be interpreted as the time above MIC is shorter which in turn could be the reason for the 
lower PTA in the age group 1-6 years. However, the slightly lower PTA is not considered to be of major 
concern due to the following: (i) the individual model-predicted PTA was supportive, (ii) the PDT against 
which PTA was estimated was 1-log kill (stasis might have sufficed for cIAI) and (iii) clinical outcomes of cIAI 
are strongly driven by adequate surgery. In addition, the proposed dose regimen for this age group is 
consistent with doses for other indications for CAZ-AVI. Of note, the proposed ceftazidime dose in the 
CAZ-AVI combination is consistent with CAZ alone, for which there is an extensive experience with the use 
in children. 
Taken together, the proposed dose regimens for paediatric patients with cIAI and cUTI are considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
- HAP/VAP  
No exposure data from paediatric patients with HAP/VAP are available at present. A PK study on NP, 
HAP/VAP (for children >3 months old to 18 years of age) requested by PDCO as part of the PIP is ongoing.  
This means that the assessment of this additional indication will be based on extrapolation without a 
supportive PK bridge. The MAH’s extrapolation strategy for HAP/VAP was thus based on popPK/PTA 
simulations, using adult datasets across all 3 approved indications (cIAI, cUTI, and HAP/VAP) and PK data 
from paediatric patients with cUTI and cIAI, including children with severe cUTI infections requiring IV 
treatment. This strategy is considered acceptable since there are paediatric PK data from patients with cIAI 
and cUTI, including from severely ill patients with cUTI. Of note, the employed extrapolation strategy is in 
line with the Draft Paediatric Addendum for Antibacterial Agents, in which the following is stated: “The 
paediatric pharmacokinetic data may be obtained in patients with one or a limited range of the infectious 
diseases for which use of the antibacterial agent is proposed, taking into account whether pharmacokinetic 
differences were observed in adults depending on the site of the infection. It is recommended that 
pharmacokinetic data are obtained from at least some paediatric patients with evidence of severe systemic 
illness, if applicable to the indications proposed”. 
Based on the updated popPK model (CAZ-MS-PED-02), simulated paediatric exposures (AUCss,0-24 and 
Cmax,ss) were overall comparable to adult exposures, and a PTA of >90% was achieved in all age-subgroups 
with HAP/VAP. In the adult patients, the dose regimen of 2/0.5 g q8h was found efficacious for treatment of 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 63/167 
 
 
  
  
all three site-specific infections (cUTI, cIAI and HAP/VAP) based on clinical studies as well as PK/PD data. 
There were no significant differences in the PK parameters for ceftazidime and avibactam between these 
patient populations. Considering similarity of PK data for these components in paediatric patients with cIAI 
and cUTI, it is expected that ceftazidime and avibactam exposures will be similar in paediatric patients with 
HAP/VAP, as well. It should also be noted that PK characteristics of avibactam were shown to be very similar 
to ceftazidime in adults in all 3 site specific indications (including patients with HAP/VAP and penetration to 
ELF). 
Taken together, the proposed dose regimens for paediatric patients with HAP/VAP are considered 
acceptable. It is reassuring that PK data from ongoing HAP/VAP study (to be finalised in December 2020) will 
be used to confirm the adequacy of the proposed dose regimens for this indication. 
- Infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in paediatric patients with limited treatment options 
No exposure data has been submitted for this indication. The use of ceftazidime/avibactam for the 
above-mentioned indication is based on experience with ceftazidime alone and on analyses of the PK-PD 
relationship for ceftazidime/avibactam in both adults and children.  
For cIAI and cUTI indications, CAZ-AVI exposures in paediatric patients from the age of 3 months to >18 
years at the proposed doses were demonstrated to be roughly similar to adults. In addition, available data 
suggest that exposures of both ceftazidime and avibactam were similar between different indications 
investigated in paediatric studies D4280C00014 (patients with confirmed or suspected infections), 
C3591004 (cIAI) and C3591005 (cUTI). Therefore, sufficient exposures are expected to be achieved at the 
proposed CAZ-AVI doses for paediatric patients with limited treatment options as for adults. The proposed 
dose regimen for this indication is consistent with the doses for site specific infections for children. It should 
also be noted that, the same dose regimen is recommended for all four approved adult indications.   
Considering the unmet medical need for further treatment options against infections due to resistant 
Gram-negative bacteria, the extrapolation of this indication to paediatric patients is supported. 
Adequacy of the proposed dose regimens in patients with normal renal function  
Based on the above-mentioned popPK/PTA simulations, PK parameters were predicted to be comparable in 
paediatric patients aged 3 month and older across the site specific infections of cUTI, cIAI and HAP/VAP. In 
addition, PTAs of at least >90% were achieved at the proposed doses using the joint PKPD target for almost 
all paediatric subgroups with cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP.  
The  above-mentioned  data  demonstrating  similar  exposures  and  target  attainments  to  adults,  in 
conjunction with the consideration that ceftazidime is already approved for use in children, with the same 
dosing recommendations as the proposed doses for different age categories (including new-borns), allow for 
concluding that the proposed paediatric dose regimens are appropriate for the applied indications.  
Dosing recommendations in children with renal impairment 
As ceftazidime and avibactam is primarily renally excreted, dosing recommendations in patients with renal 
impairment may need to be adjusted. The following recommendations have been made for pediatric patients 
with different renal function categories (Table 26):

recommendation for ceftazidime monotherapy in adults and children with impaired renal

Potential dosing recommendation in children <2years of age have been explored and model assumptions 
and uncertainties associated with predictions of exposure in patients <2 years with renal impairment 
discussed. There are still uncertainties coming from the lack of data in patients with reduced renal function. 
However, considering that dosing recommendations are given for ceftazidime as monotherapy in children 
down to 2mo, that the exposure of avibactam has been shown to be roughly parallel to that of ceftazidime 
also in this age cohort, and that the conducted simulations support adequate PTAs for the investigated 
dosing regimens, dosing recommendations have been given for patients below 2years of age with moderate 
to severe renal impairment. However, there is insufficient information to recommend a dosage regimen for 
paediatric patients < 2 years of age that have a CrCL < 16 mL/min/1.73 m2. This has been appropriately 
reflected in the Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The totality of the data and the consideration that ceftazidime monotherapy is approved for use in children, 
with dosing recommendations down to birth, allows for concluding that the proposed dosing 
recommendations are adequate for both ceftazidime and avibactam, and that the exposures are sufficiently

similar to allow extrapolation of safety and efficacy for cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP as well as in aerobic 
Gram-negative infections in paediatric patients with limited treatment options from adults to children.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy in paediatric cIAI 
2.4.1.  Main study C3591004 (D4280C00015) 
The initial application for authorisation of CAZ-AVI did not include paediatric data from controlled clinical 
studies. Since completion of the adult studies, a paediatric study in cIAI has been conducted (C3591004 
[D4280C00015]). This Phase 2 study was initiated as part of the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan 
(PIP). 
Study  C3591004  (D4280C00015)  is  designed  to  evaluate  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  and 
efficacy of ceftazidime and avibactam (CAZ-AVI) + metronidazol, compared with meropenem, in children 
from 3 months to <18 years of age with complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAIs). 
The study was sponsored by AstraZeneca and the sponsorship was transferred to Pfizer, Inc, on 18 
September 2017. The study was conducted by investigators contracted by and under the direction of the 
Sponsor. 
Methods 
The study was a single-blind, randomised, multi-centre, and actively controlled trial conducted in paediatric 
patients diagnosed with cIAIs of sufficient severity to require hospitalisation and treatment with intravenous 
(IV) antibiotics. The study design of study D4280C00015 (C3591004) is illustrated in the Figure below.

condition. More than 2 consecutive doses were not permitted if the individual doses are expected to 
give >12 hours cover (i.e., giving a total cover of >24 hours). For patients enrolled after a surgical

The CHMP considered that, according to the inclusion criteria, it can be concluded that patients with 
complicated intra-abdominal infections are enrolled as the required infections will lead to infectious 
processes proceeding beyond the organ that is the source of the infection. Overall, the included types of 
intra-abdominal infections could be categorised as infections that are neither so limited that just surgery 
would be curative, nor so complicated that several additional confounding factors would affect curation. 
Treatments 
Patients received IV treatment for a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days, i.e. 9 doses) before having the option 
to switch to an oral therapy on Day 4 at the investigator`s discretion, if the patient had good or sufficient 
response and was tolerating oral fluids or food. CAZ-AVI doses were based on the age and weight of the 
patient with adjustment according to renal function (see table below). The total period of treatment (i.e. IV 
drug and oral switch treatment) was to be between 7 and 15 days. Patients could have remained on IV study 
treatment for the full 7 to 15 days. 
Table 27. CAZ-AVI Dose Regimens by Age, Weight and Creatinine Clearance 
Dosing for Metronidazole (anaerob coverage in the CAZ/AVI treatment group) 
The suggested dose regimen of metronidazole is 10 mg/kg IV, administered over 20 to 30 minutes every 8 
hours (±30 minutes), or according to local labels. The metronidazole infusion was to be started no later than 
30 minutes after completion of the CAZ-AVI infusion. 
Dosing for the comparator Meropenem treatment group 
The dose regimen of meropenem was to be 20 mg/kg every 8 hours (±1 hour) infused over approximately 
15 to 30 minutes or up to 1 hour (or infusion duration as per local guidelines). For patients weighing over 50 
kg, the maximum dose of meropenem should not have exceeded 1 g every 8 hours. The Investigator was to 
follow the package insert for meropenem for dose modifications associated with renal impairment.

Treatment if oral switch after 72 hours IV therapy 
Oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, oral ciprofloxacin + metronidazole, or pathogen-based therapy (in 
discussion with the Medical Monitor) were permitted for the oral switch and were administered per local 
standards of care. Oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and oral ciprofloxacin + metronidazole were only used in 
countries where its use for children is permitted. 
Gram positive adjunctive therapy  
If Enterococcus species or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was one of the pathogens 
suspected or isolated, then open label vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin may have been added to either 
of the study regimens according local label recommendations. 
If vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin were started empirically to cover MRSA or Enterococcus species, and 
if final culture results did not isolate MRSA or Enterococcus species, then the Investigator was to discontinue 
this treatment. 
The CHMP considered the choice of meropenem as comparator to be acceptable: it is approved and widely 
used as treatment for cIAIs and considered the drug of choice for treating infections due to ESBL-producing 
Gram-negative bacilli. 
Metronidazole was added for anaerobic coverage and this is in line with clinical recommendations. 
Generally, the treatment options suggested to cover MRSA and Enterococcus, lack activity against 
Gram-negative pathogens and were therefore not expected to impact efficacy results. 
The proposed treatment duration of 7-14 days and the option to switch to oral therapy is generally in line 
with current IDSA guideline 2010 and World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines 2017 for 
management of intra-abdominal infections. These guidelines state that patients with cIAI require 4 to 7-day 
courses of antibiotic therapy, either as oral or parenteral treatment. Switch from parenteral therapy to oral 
therapy is recommended after at least three days as long as they are clinically improving, according to 
pre-defined objective criteria. In the current study, clinical improvement at EOIV was defined, and had to be 
fulfilled before allowing a switch to oral therapy. Thus, the strategy of switching from IV to oral treatment to 
complete a short course of therapy is considered acceptable by the Committee. 
Of note, the Surgical Infection Society Revised Guidelines on the Management of Intra-Abdominal Infection, 
Mazuski 2017 recommend that antimicrobial therapy is restricted to five days in pediatric patients older than 
one month who have had adequate source control. However, an individualized approach is always 
mandatory according to the patient’s inflammatory response and the severity of the disease. Overall, the 
total IV and IV/oral treatment duration of 5-14 days proposed in the SmPC is therefore, considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
• 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole given at the selected dose regimen 
versus meropenem in paediatric patients aged ≥3 months to <18 years with cIAI. 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
To evaluate the descriptive efficacy of CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole versus meropenem in paediatric 
patients aged ≥3 months to <18 years with cIAI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 70/167 
 
 
  
  
 
• 
To evaluate the PK of CAZ-AVI in paediatric patients aged ≥3 months to <18 years with cIAI. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary outcome (safety) variables 
•  Adverse events (AEs) and Serious adverse events (SAEs); Cephalosporin class effects and additional 
AEs; Vital signs; Physical examination; Laboratory parameters; Electrocardiogram (ECG). 
Secondary outcome (efficacy) variables 
Plasma concentrations and PK parameters of CAZ and AVI; 
• 
•  Clinical response at End of 72 hours’ treatment, EOIV, EOT, and TOC; 
•  Microbiological response at EOIV, EOT, TOC, and LFU; 
•  Clinical relapse at LFU; 
• 
Emergent infections. 
The CHMP noted that, in this study, efficacy was not a primary endpoint. According to Draft guideline 
EMA/187859/2017 “Addendum to guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment 
of bacterial infections to address paediatric-specific clinical data requirements”, no appropriately powered 
efficacy studies are requested in the paediatric population as efficacy can be extrapolated from adults 
provided that similar exposure is achieved and sufficient safety data have been generated with the intended 
dose regimen in the paediatric population. Thus, the choice of efficacy as a secondary endpoint is considered 
acceptable by the Committee.

Table 31. Clinical Outcome Assessments at TOC 
Each patient who was considered clinically cured at TOC was reassessed at LFU for evidence of clinical 
relapse of cIAI symptoms. A favourable clinical outcome at LFU was a sustained clinical cure. 
Microbiological response assessment 
Culture and organism identification were (according to protocol) performed at the local or regional 
laboratory, as applicable. Susceptibility testing was done at the local or regional laboratory to support 
patient care. All isolates were sent to the central laboratory for organism identification and susceptibility 
testing.

Sample size 
A sufficient number of patients were to be randomised for 80 patients to complete at least 72 hours (3 full 
days, i.e., 9 doses) of study treatment (i.e., evaluable patients; at least 60 patients in the CAZ-AVI plus 
metronidazole group and at least 20 patients in the meropenem group). 
Patients were randomised 3:1 to the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole or meropenem study treatment groups.  
The proposed sample size is based on the probability of observing a ‘rare’ safety event. The ‘rare’ term used 
in this section is not based on the regulatory definition but is instead intended to reflect uncommon events. 
Safety data from this study and from Study D4280C00016 for complicated urinary tract infection were 
combined for analysis. As a total of at least 120 patients were treated with CAZ-AVI in both studies 
combined, when assuming an underlying incidence rate of 3% for a specific ‘rare’ event, this would ensure 
that the probability of observing such an event in at least 1 patient treated with CAZ-AVI exceeds 95%. 
Randomisation 
Patients were allocated to 1 of 4 cohorts based on age. Randomisation was stratified as follows: 
•  Cohort 1: At least 15:5 evaluable patients aged from 12 years to <18 years; 
•  Cohort 2: At least 15:5 evaluable patients aged from 6 years to <12 years; 
•  Cohort 3: No required minimum of evaluable patients aged from 2 years to <6 years; (as of protocol 
amendment 2); 
•  Cohort 4: No required minimum of evaluable patients aged from 3 months to <2 years, (as of 
protocol amendment 2), comprising Cohorts 4a and 4b as follows: 
-  Cohort 4a: Patients aged from 1 year to <2 years 
-  Cohort 4b: Patients aged from 3 months to <1 year. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was observer-blinded. Each investigational site was required to have a site-specific blinding plan 
that described the site-specific precautions being taken to ensure that the study was observer-blinded, 
taking into account the specific patient care procedures, equipment, and information accessibility at that 
site. 
Statistical methods 
The  study  was  descriptive  in  nature,  no  interim  or  final  inferential  analyses  were  performed  for  either 
efficacy or safety. Descriptive summaries was provided for each of the primary and secondary variables. In 
general, summaries were presented by cohort, treatment group and overall for treatment group across all 
cohorts.  The  Safety  analysis  set  was  used  for  summaries  and  listings.  Clinical  response  outcomes  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 75/167 
 
 
  
  
 
summarized by cohort, treatment group and overall for each treatment in the ITT, micro-ITT, CE and ME 
analysis sets (defined below).  
Analysis sets 
The Safety analysis set included all randomised patients who received any amount of IV study therapy (ie, 
CAZ-AVI  plus  metronidazole  or  meropenem).  For  the  Safety  analysis  set,  patients  were  included  in  all 
outputs according to the study treatment actually received.  
The Safety Evaluable analysis set was the subset of the Safety analysis set that received at least 9 doses of 
study treatment.  
The Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis set was the subset of the patients in the Safety analysis set who had at 
least 1 ceftazidime and/or avibactam plasma measurement available.  
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set included all patients assigned a randomised treatment.  
The  Microbiological  intent-to-treat  (micro-ITT)  set  included  all  randomised  patients  who  had  a  baseline 
pathogen known to cause cIAI.  
The Clinically Evaluable (CE) analysis set is defined at the end of 72 hours of study treatment (determined 
by the 72 hour efficacy assessment visit), and at each of the End of Intravenous Treatment (EOIV), End of 
Treatment (EOT), Test of Cure (TOC) and Late Follow up (LFU) visits. The CE analysis set will include:  
•  All randomised patients who receive any amount of IV study drug and have a confirmed diagnosis of 
cIAI;  
•  Have received at least 48 hours of IV study drug, defined as 6 doses, in order to be considered an 
evaluable clinical failure, unless deemed a clinical failure based on a treatment-limiting AE; 
•  Have received at least 72 hours of IV study drug, defined as 9 doses, in order to be considered an 
evaluable clinical cure; 
•  Have been evaluated at the End of 72 hours assessment and at the specific visits of EOIV, EOT, and 
TOC with a clinical response of cure or failure (or have been assessed as a clinical failure at or after 
EOIV  and  before  the  planned  assessment  visit),  or  for  LFU,  have  been  evaluated  with  a  clinical 
response of sustained cure or relapse; 
•  Had no important protocol deviations that would affect assessment of efficacy; 
•  Have not received concomitant antibiotics that would affect assessment of efficacy. 
The Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) analysis set will be defined at the end of 72 hours of study treatment, 
and at each of the EOIV, EOT, TOC and LFU visits. It includes all patients meeting the following criteria: 
•  All randomised patients who receive any amount of IV study drug and have a confirmed diagnosis of 
cIAI;  
•  Have received at least 48 hours of IV study drug, defined as 6 doses, in order to be considered an 
evaluable clinical failure, unless deemed a clinical failure based on a treatment-limiting AE; 
•  Have received at least 72 hours of IV study drug, defined as 9 doses, in order to be considered an 
evaluable clinical cure; 
•  At the specific visit had a microbiological response which was not indeterminate (note; presumed 
eradication or presumed persistence is acceptable); 
•  Had no important protocol deviations that would affect assessment of efficacy; 
•  Have not received concomitant antibiotics that would affect assessment of efficacy. 
Assessment report

•  Have at least 1 typical intra-abdominal infection (IAI) bacterial pathogen which has been isolated 
from  an  adequate  microbiological  specimen  at  Baseline  that  is  susceptible  to  both  study  agents 
(CAZ-AVI and meropenem).

Table 36. Summary of Microbiological Evaluable Analysis Sets at the End of 72 Hours, EOIV, EOT, 
TOC and LFU 
The CHMP noted that, overall, subject disposition was similar between the two treatment groups across the 
analysis sets. However, an imbalance was observed in CE population at End of 72h analysis set which 
included 49 [80.3%)] patients in the CAZ/AVI + MTZ group vs. 20 [90.9%] patients in the meropenem 
group. Similarly, an imbalance was observed in the ME population at End of 72h and EOT with fewer patients 
included in the CAZ/AVI+MTZ treatment group. 
The most common reason for exclusion from the CE population at the End of 72h was “no valid clinical 
response within the window”. It is noted that more patients in the CAZ/AVI+MTZ group (10 [16.4%] 
patients had no valid response at End of 72h compared to the meropenem treatment group (1 [4.5%]). The 
reason for this difference is unclear; it could seem as if more patients in the meropenem group achieve a 
clinical response faster compared to patients in the CAZ/AVI group. However, considering the low number of 
patients, it could also be random. 
At the TOC visit the difference between the two arms was approximately balanced (2 patients, 3.3% in the 
CAZ/AVI group vs. 0 patients in the meropenem group).

Table 37. Patient Disposition per cohort (All Patients) 
The CHMP noted that the majority of patients were enrolled in the older age cohorts. No patients less than 
2 years of age received CAZ-AVY plus metronidazole and only six patients received CAZ/AVI in the age group 
3-6 years. However, in line with CHMP Addendum guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products 
indicated for treatment of bacterial infections to address paediatric-specific clinical data requirements, 
efficacy results presented in the initial MA application for the adult in the cIAI indication can be extrapolated 
to the paediatric population provided similar exposure. In addition, the efficacy results observed in the 
youngest children with cUTI could be extrapolated to the same age cohorts for children with cIAI as these 
two infectious diseases are expected to have similar pathophysiology. See also the clinical pharmacology 
section regarding extrapolation of PK between indications. 
Most patients completed IV study treatment (58 [95.1%] patients in the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole group 
and 21 [95.5%] patients in the meropenem group). The majority of patients in both treatment groups 
completed the study through to TOC (81 [97.6%]) and LFU (80 [96.4%]) visits. Four patients (4.8%) 
discontinued the IV study treatment prematurely, of which one patient in cohort 1 in the CAZ-AVI + MTZ 
group discontinued due to lack of therapeutic response. 
Recruitment 
First patient first visit: 01 August 2015, last patient last visit: 01 June 2017.

clinical monitoring of this study was conducted by the Sponsor and PRA Health Sciences or its designated 
representatives. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendment 
The original protocol, approved on 20 January 2015 was amended twice. 
Amendment 1 was approved on 22 September 2015 and this modification provided additional doses for 
Cohort 4 and dose adjustments for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL < 50 ml/min.  
Amendment 2 was approved 07 March 2017 with endorsement from the European Medicines Agency 
Paediatric Committee (PDCO) to increase the maximum percentage of patients enrolled with complicated 
appendicitis from 80% to 90%, remove the requirement for a minimum number of evaluable patients to be 
enrolled in Cohorts 3 and 4, and remove specific exclusionary criteria related to immunocompromised 
patients. Amendment 2 also included the addition of two efficacy analysis sets (intent-to-treat [ITT] and 
microbiological intent-to-treat [micro-ITT]) per agreement with the Food and Drug administration (FDA). 
Protocol deviations 
Table 38. Important Protocol Deviations (Safety Analysis Set) 
The CHMP noted that the US site 5007 (principal investigator J. Blumer) was temporarily suspended and 
then terminated by the site IRB after one patient was randomised. Termination of this site was based upon 
findings of non
compliance with IRB policies occurring with other clinical studies. The site IRB performed an 
investigation and did not identify any adverse effects for the one patient who had been enrolled in this study.  
‑
The Sponsor also performed a quality assurance audit at the site. Based on the audit and a review of the 
safety and efficacy data, the Sponsor concluded there were no data integrity concerns that would preclude 
the data from being included in any data analysis. This is considered acceptable. 
Protocol amendments: Both amendments were implemented after the first subject first visit. Amendment 1 
was approved only one month after the first patient was enrolled. This amendment provided dose 
adjustment for renal impaired patients. However, according to baseline data no patients with moderate to 
renal impairment (CrCL < 50 ml/min) were included in the study. Regarding Amendment 2: comprised 
(among other things) increasing the maximum percentage of patients enrolled with complicated appendicitis 
from 80% to 90%. This proposed change was approved by the PDCO. The PDCO had also noticed that in 
adult patients with cIAI the efficacy of ceftazidime/avibactam was higher in cases related to appendicitis 
than in patients with cIAI due to other causes. It is acknowledged that appendicitis is the most commonly 
diagnosed cIAI in children. Since popPK modelling demonstrates that disease severity has minimal effect on 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 82/167 
 
 
  
  
 
CAZ-AVI exposure, the high proportion of patients with appendicitis is not considered to affect the 
applicability of the study results to cIAI patients with non-appendicitis type infections. Consequently, the 
change to include a proportion of 90% appendicitis is considered acceptable. 
The exclusion criterion that prevented immunocompromised patients from being included in the study has 
been removed. Since immunocompromised patients are more likely to develop infections and therefore 
constitute an important patient population for parenteral antibiotic therapy in clinical practice, examining 
efficacy in these patients is very relevant for CAZ-AVI. The MAH was therefore asked in the previous round 
to submit the number of immunocompromised patients enrolled in the study and provide an overview of the 
efficacy outcomes observed in these patients compared to patients who were not immunocompromised. The 
MAH clarified in the response to this request that no patients with significant immunosuppression were 
enrolled in the cIAI study, most properly due to the late removal of this exclusion criterion of less than 3 
months in this study. Please also refer to the assessment for the cUTI indication below. 
Protocol deviations: In total, over 50% of the patients had at least one important protocol deviation (35 
[57.4%] CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole; 10 [45.5%] meropenem patients). The most common deviations 
were in the category “Assessment safety” (approx. 30%). A total of 4 patients had important protocol 
deviations that led to a manual (non-programmatic) exclusion from the CE and ME analysis sets. The MAH 
argues that most of the deviations in the category “Assessment safety” were related to assessments not 
being conducted per the study schedule. Although there were 6 patients with important protocol deviations 
related to informed consent, there were no patients who lacked adequate informed consent. Across all 
cohorts, only two patients had important protocol deviations related to receipt of prohibited concomitant 
medications. These few deviations are not considered to have had a significant impact on the final conclusion 
of the study. Please also refer to section ‘Concomitant treatment’ below.

Bacteremia at baseline 
Two patients had isolates identified in the blood in the CAZ/AVI + MTZ treatment group at baseline (E.coli in 
1 patient and P.aeruginosa in 1 patient). No patients in the meropenem group had Gram-negative pathogens 
isolated from blood at baseline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 85/167 
 
 
  
  
 
The CHMP noted that for several of the demographic and baseline characteristics there were imbalances 
between the two treatment groups. The proportion of males was for instance much higher in the CAZ-AVI 
plus metronidazole group (72.1%) than in the meropenem group (40.9%). 
Overall, the majority of the patients was predominantly white, European, males with a median age of 11 
years and had normal renal function. No patients with CrCL < 50 ml/min were included and no dose 
recommendation is proposed by the MAH in the SmPC for this patient population (Please refer to LoQ for the 
pharmacology section, OC 14). As noted previously, only six patients of age 2-6 years were included in the 
study. No patients < 2 years (Cohort 4) were included in the CAZ/AVI arm. 
A high proportion in both treatment arms had appendicitis (in total 75 subjects [90.1%]) at screening. This 
reflects well the actual epidemiological situation in children. The majority were diagnosed as appendiceal 
perforation or per-appendiceal abscess. However, as previously mentioned, this was accepted by the PDCO 
(protocol amendment 2). More patients in the CAZ/AVI+ metronidazole group compared to the meropenem 
group had the operative procedure appendectomy not otherwise specified (NOS) (59.0% vs. 40.9%, 
respectively).

Baseline microbiology 
Table 41. Summary of Baseline Pathogens in > 2 Patients in Either Treatment Group from 
intra-abdominal site and/or blood (Micro-ITT Analysis Set) 
The CAZ-AVI MIC range for E. coli was ≤0.008 to 0.12 mg/L and for P. aeruginosa was 0.5 to 8 mg/L. Two 
patients in the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole treatment group and none in the meropenem group had 
ceftazidime-non-susceptible (NS) E. coli isolated at baseline. The MICs for these two isolates were 16 mg/L 
and 32 mg/L, respectively. The meropenem MIC range for E. coli was ≤0.008 to 0.03 mg/L and for P. 
aeruginosa it was 0.06 to 4 mg/L. There were no pathogens that were non-susceptible to meropenem. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 87/167 
 
 
  
  
 
 
The CHMP acknowledged that pathogens isolated at baseline reflect the pattern of pathogens most 
commonly detected for intra-abdominal infections.  
The most frequently reported Enterobacteriaceae pathogen reported at baseline was E. coli (55 [79.7%] 
overall; CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole: 42 [84.0%]; meropenem: 13 [68.4%]).  
The most frequently reported Gram-negative pathogen other than Enterobacteriaceae was P. aeruginosa 
(23 [33.3%] overall; CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole: 14 [28.0%]; meropenem: 9 [47.4%]). K. pneumoniae 
was reported in 3 (4.3%) patients overall (CAZ-AVI: 2 [4.0%]; meropenem: 1 [5.3%]). 
In both treatment groups very few of the pathogens were isolated from blood (2 patients in the CAZ/AVI + 
MTZ groups vs. none in the meropenem group [micro-ITT population]), reflecting the low number of 
bacteremic cases. No patients in the ME at TOC analysis set had Gram-negative pathogens identified in the 
blood at baseline. 
Overall, there were no isolates tested that were reported as being non-susceptible to either of the study 
drugs received. 
Two patients in the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole group had E. coli isolates that were non-susceptible to 
ceftazidime, 1 in cohort 1 and the other in cohort 3. 
Over 80% of patients in each treatment group of the safety analysis set belonged to the micro-ITT analysis 
set, and thus had baseline pathogens identified from intra-abdominal or blood cultures. 
Prior Treatments 
Systemic antibiotics taken within 2 weeks of the start of study treatment is considered prior treatments, and 
from randomisation through the LFU visit is considered concomitant treatment. 
The proportion of patients who received prior systemic antibiotic medication ranged from 81.8% to 100% 
across cohorts. The prior systemic antibiotic medication most commonly received by patients was 
gentamicin, used by 25 (30.1%) patients overall (CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole n = 18 [29.5%] and 
meropenem n = 7 [31.8%]). 
Concomitant treatment 
Systemic antibiotics taken from randomisation through the LFU visit is considered concomitant treatment. 
Overall, 86.9% of patients in CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole group, and 86.4% in the meropenem group 
received concomitant systemic antibiotics. The most frequent concomitant systemic antibiotic administered 
was gentamicin, used by 22 (26.5%) patients overall (CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole n = 16 [26.2%] and 
meropenem n = 6 [27.3%]). Two (2) patients (1 in each treatment group) were excluded from the CE and 
ME analysis sets at EOIV, EOT, and TOC and five patients (3 patients in the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole 
group and 2 patients in the meropenem group) were excluded from the CE and ME at LFU analysis sets for 
being in receipt of concomitant medication for a reason other than clinical failure. 
For the assessment of prior and concomitant medications, it should be noted that as the start/end time of 
antibiotic administration was not collected, systemic medications reported with the same start date as study 
drug administration are captured as both prior and concomitant medications. As a result, the proportions for 
each summary of prior or concomitant medications may be higher than actual exposures. However, across 
all cohorts, only two patients had important protocol deviations related to receipt of prohibited concomitant 
medications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 88/167 
 
 
  
  
According to the MAH, the apparent high proportion of patients with concomitant systemic antibiotics 
(approx. 86% in both treatment groups) could be explained by the fact that the time points for 
starting/ending points of the dosing of concomitant systemic antibiotics were not collected. The systemic 
antibiotics taken during Day 1 of IV study medication administration therefore had been reported as both 
prior and concomitant medications. The CHMP noted that the investigators only reported two cIAI patients 
who had important protocol deviations related to receipt of prohibited concomitant medications across all 
cohorts. Lack of data collection on the duration of prior/concomitant treatments is considered a weakness of 
the conduct of the study. However, considering that the efficacy should be extrapolated from adults this 
issue was not further pursued with regards to efficacy. 
Extent of exposure 
For all cohorts combined, the median (minimum-maximum) exposure to IV study drug was 7 (2-13) days for 
both the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole and meropenem treatment groups Exposure data are presented 
separately for CAZ-AVI and metronidazole within the CAZ-AVI + metronidazole group In terms of the 
individual components, the median (minimum-maximum) exposure was 7 (2-13) days for CAZ-AVI, 
metronidazole, and meropenem. 
Approximately 69% of patients in both treatment groups were switched to oral therapy to complete their 
study treatment. The median duration of oral drug exposure was 6 and 7 days for patients in the CAZ-AVI 
plus metronidazole and meropenem treatment groups, respectively. The majority (67/83 [80.7%]) of 
patients in the study received 8 to 20 days of IV + oral therapy, generally consistent with the protocol 
recommended treatment duration of 7 to 15 days (IV + oral therapy combined). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Compliance by study treatment was approximately 100% in all cohorts and treatment groups. The overall 
mean compliance values for CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole and meropenem ranged from approximately 93% 
to 105%, with a median of 100%.

Table 43. Clinical response at TOC by visit, treatment group and cohort (ITT Analysis Set) 
The CHMP considered that, in general, across all analysis sets, favourable clinical response rates of >90% 
were observed at the End of 72 hour visit and were sustained through the LFU visit for both treatment 
groups. In the CE population at TOC, 56 patients (91.8%) in the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole group and 21 
patients (95.5%) in the meropenem group had a favourable clinical response. However, the study was not 
statistically powered to conclude on efficacy. 
The clinical response rates in the individual cohorts were in general consistent with those observed in the 
overall study population, except for cohort 1 (12-18 years of age).

The MIC distributions for each baseline pathogen were presented based on ceftazidime, CAZ-AVI and 
meropenem MICs. Additionally, for pathogens for which the number was 10 or more, the MIC to inhibit the 
growth of 50% (MIC50), and for which the number is 10 or more the MIC to inhibit the growth of 90% of 
organisms (MIC90) were reported. 
Susceptibility testing methods and interpretive results were based upon CLSI criteria for meropenem and 
ceftazidime while the interpretation for CAZ-AVI was according to the FDA label. 
Two patients in the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole group had E. coli isolates that were non-susceptible to 
ceftazidime, 1 in cohort 1 and the other in cohort 3. 
Overall, there were no isolates tested that were reported as being non-susceptible to study drug received. 
For CAZ-AVI, the MIC range for E. coli was ≥0.008-0.12 mg/L and MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L for the CAZ-AVI 
plus metronidazole group and the corresponding data was 0.03-0.12 mg/L and MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L for the 
meropenem group. The MIC range for P. aeruginosa was 0.5-4 mg/L and the MIC90 was 4.0 mg/L for the 
CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole group. The corresponding data for the meropenem group were 1-8 mg/L and 
the MIC90 was not reported, due to <10 isolates. 
In CAZ/AVI + MTZ group, there were no reported cases of persistence showing an increase in CAZ/AVI MIC. 
According to the MAH, review of per-pathogen responses by MIC did not identify any trends. For 
predominant pathogens, such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa, there was no indication that increasing MICs were 
associated with a lower favourable response rate in either treatment group.

The CHMP noted that most microbiological outcomes were presumed eradicated based on clinical response; 
showing a similar pattern to the per-patient clinical response for the pathogens isolated. For cIAI, it is not 
unexpected that the microbiological eradication rates are mostly based on presumptions. 
Due to the high number of presumed eradications, the per-pathogen clinical response and per-pathogen 
microbiological response were comparable. 
In general, the per-pathogen microbiological response rates were similar between the Micro-ITT and the ME 
populations. 
Since CAZ-AVI was administered with MTZ throughout the treatment period, the relevant comparison of 
response rates by pathogen should exclude the anaerobes. 
Treatment emergent infections 
There were no treatment emergent infections reported in either treatment group. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy in paediatric cUTI 
2.5.1.  Main study C3591005 (D4280C00016) 
The initial MAA application for authorisation of CAZ-AVI did not include paediatric data from controlled 
clinical  studies.  Since  completion  of  the  adult  studies,  a  paediatric  study  in  cUTI  has  been  conducted 
(C3591005  [D4280C00016]).  This  Phase  2  study  was  initiated  as  part  of  the  agreed  Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP). 
Study  C3591005  (D4280C00016)  is  designed  to  evaluate  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  and 
efficacy  of  ceftazidime  and  avibactam  (CAZ-AVI),  compared  with  cefepime  (CEF),  in  children  from  3 
months to <18 years of age with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). 
The  study  was  sponsored  by  AstraZeneca  and  the  sponsorship  was  transferred  to  Pfizer,  Inc,  on  18 
September 2017. The study was conducted by investigators contracted by and under the direction of the 
Sponsor. 
Methods 
The efficacy of CAZ-AVI for the extended paediatric indication of cUTIs was evaluated in one single-blind, 
randomised, multi-centre, and actively controlled trial conducted in hospitalised paediatric patients with 
cUTIs requiring treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Patients aged from 3 months to <18 years with 
cUTIs were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive CAZ-AVI or CEF. Patients aged from 3 months to <1 year 
were to have been born at term (defined as gestational age ≥37 weeks). 
The duration of each patient’s participation in the study was to be a minimum of 27 days to a maximum of 
50 days from the start of study treatment, at which time a late follow-up (LFU) assessment visit was 
performed (20 to 36 days from the last dose of study drug). 
The study design of study C3591005 (D4280C00016) is illustrated in Figure 15 below.

Note: If patients met all of the entry criteria except for positive urine culture as outlined above, the 
patients may have been enrolled before urine culture results were available if the results were likely 
(based on urinalysis and clinical findings) to be positive and study drugs were considered appropriate 
empiric  therapy.  If  a  patient’s  urine  culture  was  negative  after  24  or  48  hours  of  treatment  but  the 
patient was improving, the Investigator could keep the patient on treatment. If the urine culture was 
negative and the patient was not improving, study treatment was to be stopped, and the patient was to 
be followed for the rest of the study including undergoing all safety assessments until LFU.

15. Trauma to the pelvis or urinary tract. 
16. Previous renal transplantation. 
17. Condition or history of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have made the 
patient unsuitable for the study (e.g., may have confounded the results of the study or posed 
additional risk in administering the study therapy to the patient). 
18. Considered unlikely to survive the 6 to 8 week study period or rapidly progressive illness, including

22. History of seizures, excluding documented febrile seizure of childhood. 
23. Currently pregnant or breast-feeding female. 
The CHMP considered that the selection criteria reflect a patient population with ongoing acute infections of 
the urinary tract, including acute pyelonephritis (AP), evaluated as being complicated, serious and require 
hospitalisation for treatment with IV therapy. The selected criteria are largely considered acceptable and in 
accordance with the patient criteria specified for UTI in the CHMP’s “Addendum to the guideline on the 
evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013)”. 
The MAH has planned to perform analyses of the clinical responses in the enrolled patients based on the 
diagnosis of cUTI with or without AP at screening in the CE, ME, micro-ITT, and ITT analysis sets. Since 
patients with AP do not always require parenteral treatment, this is considered useful by the CHMP for the 
evaluation of the efficacy results of CAZ-AVI.

Treatments 
The dosing of CAZ-AVI was dependent on the age and weight of the enrolled patients with adjustments 
according to renal function in line with the dosing applied in the paediatric cIAI study C3591004 
(D4280C00015). Please refer to the “Treatments” section for this cIAI study above for more information. 
Dosing of Cefepime (CEF) 
The dose, schedule and infusion duration of CEF have been dosed and adjusted for according to the local 
prescribing information or as prescribed by the investigator. Cefepime 50 mg/kg were administered IV every 
8 or 12 hours. The maximum dose of CEF in any single infusion should not have exceeded 2000 mg. 
For both treatment groups (CAZ-AVI or CEF) patients were to have received a minimum of 9 doses (if given 
3 times daily, or 6 doses if given twice daily) of IV study drug, representing 3 full days (72 hours) of dosing 
prior to the optional switch to oral therapy. At any time after a minimum of 72 hours of IV study treatment 
with CAZ-AVI or CEF had been received, there was the option to switch to an oral therapy or continue IV 
therapy. The decision to switch to oral therapy was entirely at the investigator’s discretion, if the patient had 
good or sufficient clinical response, and the patient was tolerating oral fluids or food. 
Treatment options if oral switch after 72 hours IV therapy 
•  Oral ciprofloxacin (only in countries where its use for children is permitted; according to local 
guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care), or 
•  Oral cefixime (only in countries where its use for children is permitted; according to local guidelines, 
administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care), or 
•  Oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (only in countries where its use for children is permitted; according 
to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care), or 
•  Oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (only in countries where its use for children is permitted; 
according to local guidelines, administered at a dose and formulation per standard of care), or 
• 
Pathogen-based therapy (in discussion with the medical monitor). The choice of oral antibacterial 
agent for pathogen-based therapy was driven by the results of a susceptibility test, which was 
provided to the investigator by either the local or central laboratory. Initiation of pathogen-based 
therapy was at the investigator’s discretion. Before administering pathogen-based therapy, the 
investigator was to discuss the results of the susceptibility test and the selected antibacterial drug 
(which should be approved for use in children) with the medical monitor. 
The CHMP noted that the MAH chose cefepime (CEF) as comparator because it has been widely used for 
treating pyelonephritis and cUTIs in children. According to the European Association of Urology (EAU), 
hospitalized patients with symptomatic cUTI, including AP, should initially be treated with an antimicrobial 
regimen. The choice of CEF as comparator in this paediatric cUTI study is considered acceptable. CEF is a 
fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic approved as monotherapy for the treatment of cUTI, including 
pyelonephritis, caused by E. coli, K. pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis, including cases associated with 
concurrent bacteraemia with these microorganisms. The chosen dose and dosing frequencies of CEF used in 
this study is within the dose range recommended for treatment of infants from 2 months of age, children and 
adolescents with cUTI. 
Regarding the timing of oral switch and duration of overall treatment, the EAU/ European Society for 
Paediatric Urology (ESPU) guidelines for UTI in children recommend that parenteral antibiotic therapy should 
be given until the child is afebrile, before switching to and continuing on oral antibiotics for additional 7-14 
days (Stein et al. 2015). In the majority of patients with UTI, normalisation of body temperature can be 
expected within 24-48 hours after start of therapy. Hence, both the timing of the optional switch from 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 97/167 
 
 
  
  
parenteral to oral antibiotics from the fourth day after treatment initiation, and the recommended total 
duration of IV and oral treatment of 7-14 days, are considered acceptable by the Committee. However, the 
recommended duration of treatment for adult patients with cUTI is 5-10 days according to the approved 
SmPC. It is noted that 55.2% of patients in the paediatric cUTI study received treatment for 11 or more 
days. This is a duration of 5 days longer than the one proposed for treating adults. Furthermore, the 
proposed amended SmPC specifies an overall treatment duration of 5-14 days for paediatric patients with 
cUTI. Thus, the MAH was asked to explain why the dosing recommendation should be different between 
children and adult patients with cUTI, and revise the SmPC if considered necessary to reflect the treatment 
duration applied in the clinical paediatric study C3591005 (D4280C00016). The MAH explained that the 
majority of patients in the paediatric cUTI study received longer duration of treatment for up to 14 days, 
since these patients had more serious infections such as bacteremia. The MAH further clarified that patients 
in the adult study typically received CAZ-AVI for 10 days if they did not have bacteremia and for 14 days if 
they had bacteremia. The MAH therefore proposed to harmonies the adult and paediatric sections of the 
SmPC by adding a footnote suggesting longer total duration of treatment for adult cUTI patients in cases 
where patients have bacteremia. The explanation provided by the MAH regarding durations of treatment for 
both the paediatric and adult populations was acceptable. 
The oral treatment options for switching are all frequently used oral antibacterial agents known to be 
effective for treatment of paediatric UTIs. Nevertheless, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, 
trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, are not considered suitable agents for treatment of AP 
or all types of cUTIs because of the current resistance percentages observed to these antibiotics. 
Prior and Concomitant treatments 
No other oral, intramuscular, or IV concomitant antibacterial treatments were permitted while receiving 
study therapy at any time up to the LFU visit. A patient requiring such antibacterial treatments other than 
the allowed study therapy for the treatment of the cUTI was considered a treatment failure. Other 
medication, which was considered necessary for the patient’s safety and well-being, could have been given 
at the discretion of the investigator. If analgesic medications were needed for pain, the use of analgesic 
medication without antipyretic properties was preferred. All concomitant medication(s) taken during the trial 
were to be recorded with indication, daily dose, and start and stop dates of administration. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
• 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAZ-AVI given at the selected dose regimen versus CEF in 
paediatric patients aged ≥3 months to <18 years with cUTI. 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the descriptive efficacy of CAZ-AVI versus CEF in paediatric patients aged ≥3 months to <18 
years with cUTI. 
To evaluate the PK of CAZ-AVI in paediatric patients aged ≥3 months to <18 years with cUTI.

As this study was descriptive in nature, it was not powered for inferential testing and was intended to provide 
descriptive statistics only. Based on the 3:1 randomisation, meaningful interpretation of direct comparisons 
is not possible. 
The CHMP noted that efficacy measures were defined as secondary endpoints in this paediatric cUTI study 
and evaluation of efficacy was based on descriptive statistics. According to the Draft guideline 
EMA/CHMP/187859/2017 “Addendum to guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for 
treatment of bacterial infections to address paediatric-specific clinical data requirements”, it is considered 
appropriate to extrapolate efficacy observed in adults to paediatric patients with cUTI provided similar 
exposure is achieved in the paediatric population across different age subgroups. In addition, sufficient 
safety data with the intended dose regimen have to be collected in the paediatric population, which is 
defined as a primary endpoint in the study. Thus, the primary and secondary endpoints of the paediatric 
cUTI study were considered acceptable by the Committee.

Table 49. Clinical Outcome Assessments at TOC 
Each patient who was considered clinically cured at TOC was reassessed at LFU for evidence of clinical 
relapse of cUTI symptoms. The clinical outcome categories at LFU are defined in Table 50. A favourable 
clinical outcome at LFU was a sustained clinical cure. 
Table 50. Clinical Outcome Assessments at LFU 
Microbiological response assessments 
Culture and organism identification were to be performed at the local or regional laboratory, as applicable, 
and susceptibility testing was to have been done at the local or regional laboratory to support patient care. 
All isolates were to be sent to the central laboratory for organism identification and susceptibility testing.  
Urine  samples  were  to  be  obtained  for  culture  and  routine  quantitative  analysis  (including  microscopic 
examination)  at  baseline  (before  any  antibiotics  were  administered)  and  at  EOIV,  EOT,  TOC,  and  LFU. 
Cultures were to be repeated per standard of care upon knowledge of a positive result until sterilisation is 
confirmed. In addition, if clinically indicated, blood samples may have been obtained for culture and routine 
analysis (including microscopic examination) at baseline (before any antibiotics are administered) and at 
any time until LFU.

Emergent Infections 
Pathogens first isolated after baseline are categorised as “emergent infections” until the LFU in patients with 
a baseline pathogen are: 
•  Superinfection: A urine culture identified pathogen other than a baseline pathogen during the course 
of active treatment with IV study therapy along with worsening signs and symptoms of infection 
requiring alternative antimicrobial therapy. 
•  New infection: A urine culture identified pathogen other than a baseline pathogen at any time after 
IV study treatment has finished along with worsening signs and symptoms of infection requiring 
alternative antimicrobial therapy. 
Combined Response 
At the EOIV and TOC assessments, the clinical and per-patient microbiological responses were to be used to 
create  a  combined  response.  If  either  clinical  or  microbiological  response  was  unfavourable,  then  the 
combined response was unfavourable. Otherwise, in the absence of unfavourable responses, if either clinical 
or microbiological response was indeterminate or missing, then the response was indeterminate. Finally, if 
both  clinical  and  microbiological  responses  were  favourable,  then  the  outcome  was  favourable. 
Indeterminate responses include missing assessments and assessments which were not performed.

The planned sample size for this paediatric cUTI study was 80 evaluable patients comprised of a minimum of 
60 and 20 patients, respectively, from the CAZ-AVI and CEF groups. For the purpose of this study, an 
evaluable patient was defined as having completed at least 72 hours (3 full days, i.e., 9 doses if given 3 
times daily, or 6 doses if given twice daily) of study treatment. 
The planned sample size was based on the probability of observing a ‘rare’ safety event. The ‘rare’ term used 
in this section is not based on the regulatory definition but is instead intended to reflect uncommon events. 
Safety data from this study and from study C3591004 (D4280C00015) in paediatric patients with cIAI was 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020

to be integrated, analysed, and reported separately. As a total of at least 120 patients were to be treated 
with CAZ-AVI in both studies combined, when assuming an underlying incidence rate of 3% for a specific 
‘rare’ event, this was to ensure that the probability of observing such an event in at least 1 patient treated 
with CAZ-AVI exceeds 95%. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to CAZ-AVI versus CEF in a 3:1 ratio, and allocated to 1 of 4 cohorts based on age. 
Randomisation was stratified as follows: 
-  Cohort 1: At least 6:2 evaluable patients aged from 12 years to <18 years; 
-  Cohort 2: At least 6:2 evaluable patients aged from 6 years to <12 years; 
-  Cohort 3: At least 9:3 evaluable patients aged from 2 years to <6 years; 
-  Cohort 4: At least 18:6 evaluable patients aged from 3 months to <2 years, sub-divided into 
Cohorts 4a and 4b as follows: 
o  Cohort 4a: At least 9:3 evaluable patients aged from 1 year to <2 years 
o  Cohort 4b: At least 6:2 evaluable patients aged from 3 months to <1 year, with a 
minimum of 3 patients with at least 1 PK sample aged from 3 months to <6 months 
treated with CAZ-AVI. 
The inclusion of more patients in the younger age cohorts (Cohorts 3, 4a, and 4b) compared to Cohorts 1 
and 2 was based on epidemiological data. Considering patients over all cohorts combined, at least 10% of 
evaluable patients with urological abnormalities in the urinary tract were to be included. 
Block randomisation using an interactive voice/web response system (IXRS) was used to assign patients in 
a ratio of 3:1 to the study treatment groups of CAZ-AVI or CEF, respectively, in each of the cohorts for the 
age groups. A representative of AstraZeneca, under the supervision of AstraZeneca statistical personnel, 
performed the randomisation. Patients who were randomised and ended IV treatment with <72 hours of 
study treatment did not meet the criteria for the safety evaluable population as decided by medical review 
and were eligible for enrolment replacement. Data from the replaced patients was included in the safety 
analysis set (and not the safety evaluable analysis set). The replacement process ensured that the next 
patient randomised in the same stratum was automatically assigned to the same treatment group as the 
non-evaluable patient who was replaced. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was observer-blinded. Each investigational site was required to have a site-specific blinding plan 
that described the site-specific precautions being taken to ensure that the study was observer-blinded, 
taking into account the specific patient care procedures, equipment, and information accessibility at that 
site. 
At each investigational site, at least 1 blinded investigator, referred to as Blinded Observer, who was not to 
know the patient’s treatment assignment conducted the clinical assessments related to safety and efficacy. 
The Blinded Observer was allowed to see the patient during times when the study drug was not being 
administered, and when possible was to complete all clinical assessments and perform causality 
assessments for AEs and SAEs. A DSMB reviewed unblinded safety data at regular intervals during the study. 
In addition, the main programming and statistical teams were blinded from study treatment during the 
course of development of reporting materials.

Statistical methods 
The study was descriptive in nature, no interim or final inferential analyses were performed for either 
efficacy or safety. Descriptive summaries were provided for each of the primary and secondary variables. In 
general, summaries were presented by cohort, treatment group and overall for treatment group across all 
cohorts. The Safety analysis set was used for summaries and listings. Clinical response outcomes was 
summarized by cohort, treatment group and overall for each treatment in the ITT, micro-ITT, CE and ME 
analysis sets (defined below).  
Analysis sets 
The Safety analysis set included all randomised patients who received any amount of IV study therapy (ie, 
CAZ-AVI or cefepime), categorized according to the study treatment actually received.  
The safety evaluable analysis set was the subset of the patients in the Safety analysis set that received at 
least 9 doses of study treatment for patients on the CAZ-AVI arm, or 6 doses for patients on the cefepime 
arm.  
The Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis set was the subset of the patients in the Safety analysis set who had at 
least 1 ceftazidime and/or avibactam plasma measurement available.  
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set included all patients assigned a randomised treatment.  
The Microbiological intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) analysis set included all randomised patients who had at least 
1 Gram-negative typical pathogen (in the urine) at baseline known to cause cUTI and no Gram-positive 
pathogen (in the urine) at baseline.  
The Clinically evaluable (CE) analysis set was defined separately at the end of 72 hours of study treatment, 
and at each of the EOIV, EOT, TOC and LFU visits. It included all patients meeting the following criteria:  
a)  Patients in the micro-ITT analysis set who have received IV study therapy and had a confirmed 
diagnosis of cUTI; 
b)  Had received at least 48 hours of IV study drug, unless discontinued due to a treatment-limiting AE; 
c)  At the specific visit had 
a clinical response of cure, improvement or failure (or had been assessed as a clinical failure before 
the planned assessment visit),  
or for LFU, had been evaluated with a clinical response of sustained cure or relapse. 
d)  Had no important protocol deviations that would affect assessment of efficacy;  
e)  Did not take any concomitant antibiotics that would affect assessment of efficacy. This does not 
include antibiotic therapy taken for the treatment of cUTI by patients who are considered clinical 
failures.  
The Microbiologically evaluable (ME) analysis set was defined separately at each of the EOIV, EOT, TOC and 
LFU visits. It included all patients meeting the following criteria:  
a)  Patients in the micro-ITT analysis set who have received IV study therapy and had a confirmed 
diagnosis of cUTI; 
b)  Had received at least 48 hours of IV study drug, unless discontinued due to a treatment-limiting AE; 
c)  At the specific visit had a (per-patient) microbiological response which was not indeterminate; 
d)  Had no important protocol deviations that would affect assessment of the microbiological responses;  
e)  Did not take any concomitant antibiotics that would affect assessment of the microbiological 
responses.  
f)  Had at least 1 Gram-negative typical UTI bacterial pathogen which has been isolated from an 
adequate microbiological specimen (in the urine) at Baseline that was susceptible to both study 
agents (CAZ-AVI and cefepime).

Table 54. Patient Disposition (All Patients) 
The CHMP noted that, in total, 68 patients were randomised to the CAZ-AVI group and 29 patients to the CEF 
group. The enrolment was considered by the Committee to be well balanced between the age cohorts. 
The majority of patients completed IV study treatment (92.6% in the CAZ-AVI group and 86.2% in the CEF 
group) and completed the study through to TOC and LFU visits (92.8% overall). Approximately 80% of the 
patients in each treatment group belonged to the micro-ITT analysis set with a baseline pathogen, and 
approximately 70% in each treatment group were considered clinically evaluable at the TOC visit. 
Seven patients (7.2%) discontinued from IV study treatment prematurely, of which four patients in the 
CAZ-AVI arm due to adverse events (n=3) and legal representative decision (n=1). Three patients in the 
CEF group discontinued from IV study treatment due to condition under investigation improving/patient 
recovering (n=1) and enrolment culture or susceptibility results (n=2).

In general, the CHMP noted that subject disposition was similar between the two treatment groups across 
the analysis sets. However, an imbalance was observed in the CE population at LFU with 64.7% vs. 51.7% 
in the CAZ-AVI and CEF groups, respectively. The main reason for this difference was a higher proportion of 
patients in the CAZ group that had “no valid clinical response within the window” compared to the 
CAZ-AVI-group (20.7% vs 11.8%). Similarly, an imbalance was observed in the ME population at EOT with 
a lower proportion included in the CEF group (48.3% vs. 57.4% in the CAZ-AVI group). This was also mainly 
due to a higher proportion of patients in the CEF group that had “no valid microbiological response within the 
window” (27.6% vs 16.2% in the CAZ-AVI group). The opposite was observed in the ME population at LFU, 
Assessment report

with a lower proportion included in the CAZ-AVI group compared to the CEF group (23.5% vs. 31.0%, 
respectively). This could partly be due to exclusion of patients who received “concomitant medication for 
reason other than clinical failure up to LFU” form the ME population, with a slightly higher proportion of 
patients observed in the CAZ-AVI group (10.3% vs. 6.9% in the CEF group). 
Similarly to the cIAI study, the highest number of patients in this paediatric cUTI study were excluded from 
the efficacy analysis sets in the investigated treatment group because of lack of valid clinical responses 
within the window or due to protocol deviations. The main reason for patients being excluded from the 
analysis was lack of valid microbiological response within the window. This persisted until the LFU visit. 
Based on PK/PD modelling, this was not unexpected.  
Recruitment 
First patient first visit: 24 September 2015, last patient last visit: 15 September 2017. 
The study was conducted at 25 centres in 9 different countries: 3 in the Czech Republic, 4 in Greece, 4 in 
Hungary, 2 in Poland, 1 in Romania, 2 in the Russian Federation, 4 in Taiwan, 2 in Turkey, and 3 in the US.  
Medical and clinical monitoring of this paediatric cUTI study was conducted by the Sponsor and PRA Health 
Sciences or its designated representatives. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendment 
The original protocol, approved on 14 January 2015 was amended three times. 
Amendment 1 was approved on 22 September 2015. This modification divided Cohort 4 into 4a and 4b, 
added the requirement that patients in Cohort 4b were to have gestational age ≥37 weeks, added a time 
window of 8 hours for conducting assessments after 72 hours of treatment, added flank pain as a symptom 
of cUTI, allowed inclusion of patients with moderate renal impairment, added specific exclusion criteria 
related to immunocompromised patients, required that creatinine clearance was to be calculated at time 
points when serum creatinine was being assessed as part of the clinical chemistry panel, revised timelines 
for urine culture, and made changes to wording and terminology. 
Amendment 2 was approved 07 March 2017 with endorsement from the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO) 
to remove specific exclusion criteria related to immunocompromised patients that had been added at 
amendment 1. Further, the amendment clarified several aspects of analysis set definitions and added the 
two efficacy analysis sets ITT and micro-ITT, and a combined responder outcome including clinical and 
microbiological response, all these changes per agreement with FDA. In addition, Amendment 2 clarified the 
definitions for minimum treatment duration, and added other minor changes. 
Amendment 3 was approved 17 July 2017 and contained mainly administrative changes. The amendment 
was partly implemented due to the switch of the sponsor from AstraZeneca to Pfizer. In addition, a change 
of the definition of the end of the trial from Q3 2017 to Q3 2018 was implemented, due to challenges in 
patient enrolment.

Protocol deviations 
Table 57. Important Protocol Deviations (Safety Analysis Set) 
With regard to Protocol amendments, the CHMP noted that Amendment 1 was implemented 2 days before 
the first subject first visit. This amendment is not suspected to have had an impact on the study results. 
Amendment 2 was approved approximately 1.5 years after the first patient was enrolled and 6 months 
before last patient last visit. The changes introduced in the amendment were largely agreed by PDCO or FDA 
and is therefore considered acceptable. Of note, one of the main changes in this amendment was removal of 
a specific exclusion criteria related to immunocompromised patients. Since immunocompromised patients 
are more likely to develop infections and therefore constitute a relevant patient population intended for 
parenteral antibiotic therapy in clinical practice, efficacy in these patients is relevant for the evaluation of the 
efficacy outcomes of CAZ-AVI. The MAH was therefore asked in the previous round to provide the exact 
number of immunocompromised patients enrolled in the study together with an overview of the efficacy 
outcomes observed in these patients compared to patients who were not immunocompromised. The MAH 
clarified in the response to this request that only one patient enrolled in the cUTI study potentially could have 
been immunocompromised. The apparent lack of enrolment of immunocompromised patients could be 
expected as these patients initially were excluded from being enrolled and removal of this exclusion criterion 
was implemented relatively late and approximately 6 months prior to LSLV for the cUTI study. Please also 
refer to the assessment for the cIAI indication above. 
Amendment 3 was mainly for administrative purposes and transfer of sponsor from AstraZeneca to Pfizer. 
With regards to Protocol deviations, the CHMP noted that over 60% of the patients had at least one protocol 
deviation. The most common deviations were “Lab/Endpoint Data” (21.1% of subjects) and “Assessment 
Safety” (20.0% of all subjects) with a higher proportion reported in the CEF group. The MAH argues that 
most deviations within these two categories were related to assessments not being conducted as per the 
study schedule of activities. Another common category of recorded protocol deviation was “Study Drug” 
(18.9% of all subjects), with a higher frequency in the CAZ-AVI group. The MAH states that most of the 
deviations for this category were related to minor variations in the expected timing of CAZ-AVI infusions 
(expected every 8 hours +/-30 minutes). Additional types of protocol deviations were relatively infrequent. 
Although multiple deviations to the study protocol were reported, these are not considered to have had a 
significant impact on the study results or the integrity of the study. However, one patient in the CAZ-AVI 
group was randomised to Cohort 4b of the study although the patient was premature (born at 30 weeks 
gestation). In addition, another patient in the CAZ-AVI group received a higher dose than specified in the 
Assessment report

protocol for the first 3 doses, corresponding to 50 mg/kg CAZ and 12.5 mg/kg AVI instead of 40 mg/kg CAZ 
and 10 mg/kg AVI. This patient experienced a non-serious AE of mild dermatitis diaper on Day 2 that was 
related to study treatment, and an SAE of severe pyelonephritis acute on Day 46 that was considered 
unrelated to study treatment.  
The pre-specified ratio for allocating patients to treatment groups was 3:1. However, the actual disposition 
of patients was more towards a ratio of 2:1 (given there were 67 patients in CAZ-AVI group and 28 in CEF 
group).

The CHMP considered the demographic and baseline characteristics to be relatively well balanced between 
the treatment groups. However, a higher proportion of patients in the CEF group had functional or 
anatomical abnormality of the urogenital tract (17.9% vs. 9.0%), vesicoureteral reflux (14.3% vs. 7.5%), 
and urological abnormalities (21.4% vs. 13.4%) compared to the CAZ-AVI group. On the contrary, more 
patients in the CAZ-AVI group had recurrent UTI than in the CEF group (10.4% vs 3.6%). A high proportion 
in both treatment arms had AP at screening, i.e. 82.1% in the CAZ-AVI group and 85.7% in the CEF group. 
The median age of all enrolled patients was 3.87 years. The majority of patients were female, White, 
enrolled in European, and 66.3% had CrCl values in the normal range of ≥ 80 ml/min/1.73 m2. Most of the 
patents did not have any complicating factors of the urinary tract infections beyond the requirements from 
the inclusion criteria (77.9% overall) and the majority had no urological abnormalities (84.2% overall).

Source: Table 14.1.2.1.5. A patient could have more than 1 pathogen. Multiple isolates of the same species from the same patient 
were counted only once for that pathogen. Likewise, patients with multiple isolates within the same pathogen group were counted 
only once for that pathogen group. CAZ-AVI = ceftazidime avibactam; CEF = cefepime; micro-ITT = microbiological 
intent-to-treat; N/n = number of patients. 
The CAZ-AVI MIC range for Enterobacteriaceae was ≤0.015 to 0.5 mg/L with all being confirmed to be 
susceptible to CAZ-AVI (MIC ≤0.5 mg/L). E. coli was the most common pathogen and the MIC range was 
≤0.015 to 0.25 mg/L. The CAZ MIC range for Enterobacteriaceae was ≤0.06 to 64.0 mg/L. E. coli was the 
most common pathogen and the MIC range was ≤0.06 to 64 mg/L. The CEF MIC range for 
Enterobacteriaceae was ≤0.015 to >16.0 mg/L. E. coli was the most common pathogen and the MIC range 
was ≤0.015 to >16.0 mg/L. 
Two patients in the CAZ-AVI group (both in Cohort 2) and one patient in the CEF group (in Cohort 3) had E. 
coli isolates that were non-susceptible to CAZ (based on an interpretive criterion of an MIC >4 mg/L) and 
CEF (based on an interpretive criterion of an MIC >8 mg/L) at baseline. 
The CHMP noted that, in total, 79% of the randomised patients in each treatment group had baseline 
pathogens identified from the urine cultures, thereby encompassing the micro-ITT population. None of the 
patients in the micro-ITT analysis set was infected with Gram-negative pathogens other than 
Enterobacteriaceae. The majority of patients in both treatment groups (>90%) who had microbiologically 
confirmed disease were infected by E.coli, which is the most common infectious cause to UTI, particular if it 
is a first infection. Additionally, three patients in the CAZ-AVI group had pathogen isolates at baseline of 
Enterobacter cloacae (n=1) and K. pneumoniae (n=2), which are more common the first year of life. 
Overall, no isolates that were tested were reported to be non-susceptible in vitro to CAZ-AVI, but two 
patients in the CAZ-AVI group and one patient in the CEF group were reported to have E. coli isolates 
non-susceptible to both CEF- and CAZ monotherapy. Since most patients in the study had isolates that were 
susceptible in vitro to both study drugs, resistance is not suspected to have had any impact on the efficacy 
results.

Prior and Concomitant treatments 
For the assessment of prior and concomitant medications, it should be noted that as the start/end time of 
antibiotic administration was not collected, systemic medications reported with the same start date as study 
drug administration are captured as both prior and concomitant medications. As a result, the proportions for 
each summary of prior or concomitant medications may be higher than actual exposures. 
Approximately 60% of the patients across both treatment groups had no prior systemic antibiotic 
medication, i.e. taken within 2 weeks of the start of study treatment. In total, 25 (37.3%) patients in the 
CAZ-AVI group and 15 (53.6%) patients in the CEF group, received concomitant antibiotics and 40 (42.1%) 
patients overall received concomitant systemic antibiotics. Both the prior systemic antibiotic medication 
most frequently received and concomitant systemic antibiotic administered was cefuroxime sodium, used by 
8 (8.4%) patients overall (CAZ-AVI n = 6 [9.0%] and CEF n = 2 [7.1%]). In addition, 86 (90.5%) patients 
received concomitant medications other than systemic antibiotics. 
Across all cohorts, 10.3% (7 patients) in the CAZ-AVI group and 6.9% (2 patients) in the CEF group had 
important protocol deviations, which were related to receipt of concomitant medications for reasons other 
than clinical failure up to LFU, that may have had an impact on the efficacy outcome at LFU visit (Table 
14.1.1.1.3). However, only 1 patients in Cohort 4 of the CAZ-AVI group received concomitant treatment that 
was prohibited in the study protocol (Table 57). 
The CHMP noted that, in total, 42.1% of the patients received concomitant antibiotics. The MAH explained 
that this apparent high proportion might reflect the fact that the start/end points of dosing were not collected 
in the study, and systemic antibiotics taken during Day 1 of IV study medication administration therefore 
were reported as both prior and concomitant medications. Hence, the reported proportions of prior and 
concomitant treatments might be higher than what were actually administered, according to the MAH. 
Although this assumption might be plausible, lack of data collection on the duration of prior/concomitant 
treatments is considered a weakness of the conduct of the study. However, considering that the efficacy 
should be extrapolated from adults this issue was not be further pursued by the Committee with regards to 
efficacy. Please also refer to the clinical pharmacology section. 
In addition, there is a marked difference between the two treatment groups with a higher proportion of 
concomitant antibiotics used in the CEF group compared to the CAZ-AVI group (53.6% vs. 37.3%). This 
could potentially also have influenced both the type and frequencies of AEs reported within the two 
treatment groups.  
The most frequent systemic antibiotic administered was cefuroxime sodium, used by 9.0% in the CAZ-AVI 
group and 7.1% in the CEF group (8.4% of the patients overall). 
Extent of exposure 
Of the 101 enrolled patients, 97 were randomised and 95 received treatment (67 were treated in the 
CAZ-AVI group and 28 were treated within in the CEF group). For all cohorts combined, the median 
(minimum-maximum) exposure to IV study drug was 4 (1-11) days for the CAZ-AVI group and 4 (2-11) 
days for the CEF group (Table 61). The exposure results for the safety evaluable analysis set were consistent 
with the safety analysis set (data not shown).

Table 61. Summary of IV study drug exposure by treatment group and cohort (Safety Analysis 
Set) 
Around 90% of patients in both treatment groups were switched to oral therapy to complete their study 
treatment, and most of these switched between either 3-5 or 6-9 days after initiation of study treatment. 
The median duration of oral drug exposure was 7 days for both treatment groups. The majority (84/95 
[88.4%]) of patients received IV + oral therapy for 8-15 days, consistent with the protocol recommended 
treatment duration of 7 to 14 days (IV + oral therapy combined). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Treatment compliance over the entire treatment period was defined as the number of infusions over all 
doses received, divided by the number of infusions over all doses expected during the treatment period, then 
multiplied by 100. The mean compliance for IV treatment was 100% across all cohorts, treatment groups, 
and overall, with a median of 100% across both treatment groups.

Table 62. Favourable Clinical Response by Visit and Treatment Group (ITT, micro-ITT, CE, and 
ME Analysis Sets by Visit) 
Four patients (5.9%) in the CAZ-AVI treatment group of the ITT analysis set had a clinical response of 
clinical failure at the TOC visit, three of which were carried forward from EOIV and were due to a 
treatment-limiting AE. The fourth patient was a clinical failure due to “additional infections” at the TOC visit. 
This patient had a microbiological response of eradication at the TOC visit, and eradication at LFU. 
Three patients (10.3%) in the CEF group of the ITT analysis set had a clinical response of clinical failure at 
the TOC visit, one of which was carried forward from EOIV and had E. coli at baseline that was found to be 
non-susceptible to CEF. Study medication for this patient was discontinued at the EOIV visit. The two other 
patients were assessed as clinical failures due to additional infections. Both patients also had a reported 
microbiological response of persistence at the TOC visit.

Table 63. Clinical, Microbiological, and Combined Response at EOIV and at TOC by Treatment 
Group (micro-ITT Analysis Set) 
In general, the CHMP considered that favourable clinical response rates were high across all analysis sets in 
both treatment groups and the rates were sustained from the end of the 72 hours visit through to the EOT 
visit, with responses remaining ≥ 80% at LFU for the ITT, micro-ITT, and CE analysis sets of both treatment 
groups. At the TOC visit, 86.8% and 82.6% in the ITT population of the CAZ-AVI and CEF groups, 
respectively, had a favourable clinical response. No numerical trends pointed to any specific efficacy concern 
for CAZ-AVI. 
The per-patient microbiological success rates in the micro-ITT analysis set at both the EOIV and TOC visits 
were lower than the clinical response rates in both treatment groups. The eradication rates at the TOC visit 
were 79.6% for the CAZ-AVI group compared to 60.9% for the CEF group, indicating that the pathogens 
were more susceptible to CAZ-AVI. Moreover, favourable combined response rates at the EOIV visit for the 
micro-ITT analysis set were 79.6% in the CAZ-AVI group and 78.3% in the CEF group. The combined 
success rates were numerical lower at the TOC visit, i.e. 72.2% for the CAZ-AVI group and 60.9% for the 
CEF group. Hence, the combined clinical and microbiological success rates observed in the micro-ITT 
population at the TOC visit points to a numerical trend of better efficacy of CAZ-AVI compared to CEF. Of 
note, between 13-17% of the patients in both treatment groups had a combined response defined as 
indeterminate at both the EOIV and TOC visits. 
The clinical response rates in the individual cohorts were consistent with those observed in the overall study 
population; there were no notable trends observed within the cohorts in terms of clinical response in any of 
the analysis sets.

(ITT, micro-ITT, CE, and ME Analysis Sets) 
In the micro-ITT analysis set, favourable clinical responses by pathogen at TOC for infections due to E. coli 
was >81% for both treatment groups (87.8% for the CAZ-AVI group and 81.8% for the CEF group). The 
results for the ME analysis set were similar to the results for the micro-ITT population; most patients had 
favorable clinical responses by pathogen at TOC for infections due to E. coli (91.9% for the CAZ-AVI group 
and 86.7% for the CEF group).

Source: Table 14.2.1.12. The denominator for percentages is the number of patients in the micro-ITT analysis set. Per patient 
favourable microbiological response is defined as the eradication of all pathogens. CAZ-AVI = ceftazidime avibactam; CEF = 
cefepime; EOIV = End of Intravenous treatment; EOT = end of treatment; LFU = late follow-up; micro-ITT = microbiological 
intent-to-treat; N/n = number of patients; TOC = test of cure. 
Favourable microbiological response rates were lower at the LFU visit for both treatment groups than at the 
preceding visits. This was primarily due to a high percentage of indeterminate responses (i.e., source 
specimen was not available to culture) at the LFU visit (CAZ-AVI: n = 32 [59.3%]; CEF: n = 14 [60.9%]). 
Since the LFU visit could have been performed via telephone for any patient who had not experienced clinical 
relapse, did not have ongoing AEs or SAEs at TOC, or did not develop AEs or SAEs since TOC, a urine culture 
was not required at this visit and was therefore not collected in a large proportion of the patients. 
Clinical Relapse at LFU 
A total of 4 (5.9%) patients in the CAZ-AVI group were reported to have clinical relapse in the ITT and 4 
(7.4%) patients in the micro-ITT analysis sets. This number was 3 patients (6.8%) in the CE analysis set and 
2 (12.5%) patients in the ME analysis set. Of the 4 patients, 3 had underlying urological abnormalities and 
complicating factors reported at baseline. No patients had clinical relapse at LFU in the CEF group in any of 
the four efficacy analysis sets.

Source: Tables 14.2.1.14 and 14.2.1.15. The denominator for percentages is the total number of pathogens in the specified 
analysis set (at TOC) at the given visit with that baseline pathogen. A patient could have more than 1 pathogen. Multiple isolates 
of the same species from the same patient were counted only once for that pathogen. Likewise, patients with multiple isolates 
within the same pathogen group were counted only once for that pathogen group. CAZ-AVI = ceftazidime-avibactam; 
CEF=cefepime; ME=microbiologically evaluable; micro-ITT=microbiological intent-to-treat; N/n=number of patients; TOC=test 
of cure. 
No uropathogens were identified in the blood in the micro-ITT and ME at TOC analysis sets. 
The CHMP noted that the total proportion of patients with a baseline diagnosis of AP was >80% and the 
relative frequency was comparable between the two treatment groups, i.e. 81% (55/68) in the CAZ-AVI 
group and 86% (25/29) in the CEF group. The clinical success rates at the TOC visit remained high for 
patients treated with CAZ-AVI regardless of the diagnosis of AP and was consistent with the overall clinical 
response. For patient treated with CEF, a higher proportion of patients with AP in the micro-ITT analysis set 
at TOC had a favourable clinical response compared to those without AP. The opposite was seen for patients 
treated with CEF in the ME at TOC analysis set. However, caution should be taken when interpreting these 
results, as only a limited number of patients without AP have been included in the separate analysis sets. 
Apparently, the microbiological eradication rates were low at the LFU visit in both treatment groups, i.e. 
29.6% in the CAZ-AVI group and 17.4% in the CEF group. According to the MAH, this was mainly due to 
indeterminate responses for around 60% of the patients in each treatment group because the visit could 
have been done via phone, and thus only more complicated cases were at the hospital, where sampling and 
culture was done. Consistent with the explanation given by the MAH, the proportions of clinical evaluable 
patients with a favourable clinical response at LFU were high in both treatment groups, i.e. 93.2% and 100% 
in the CAZ-AVI and CEF groups, respectively, implying that most of the patients had a sustained response to 
the study treatment. It is noted, though, that there were four patients who had a relapse in the CAZ-AVI 
group. Three of these patients had underlying urological abnormalities and complicating factors and two of 
them had E.coli as baseline pathogen. It is acknowledged that no incidences of pathogens with increasing 
MIC with any of the study drug were observed, despite clinical relapses in four of the patients treated with 
CAZ-AVI. However, none of the patients in the CAZ group had relapse, and in general, patient’s baseline 
characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. Considering uncertain adequacy of CAZ-AVI 
exposure, this is not unexpected.  
The eradication rates of infections due to E. coli in the micro-ITT analysis set at the TOC visit were 79.6% in 
the CAZ-AVI group and 59.1% in the CEF group, and 86.5% and 66.7%, respectively, in the ME analysis set. 
Pathogen susceptibility, MIC and persistence 
The MIC distributions for each baseline pathogen were presented based on CAZ, CAZ-AVI and CEF MICs. 
Additionally, for pathogens for which the number was 10 or more, the MIC to inhibit the growth of 50% 
(MIC50), and the MIC to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC90) were reported. 
Susceptibility testing methods and interpretive results were based upon CLSI (Clinical and laboratory 
standards institute) criteria for CEF and CAZ, while the interpretation for CAZ-AVI was according to the FDA 
label. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 120/167 
 
 
  
  
 
For the 46 E. coli isolates in the CAZ-AVI group, the CAZ-AVI MIC range was ≤0.015-0.25 mg/L and the 
MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L. For the 20 E. coli isolates in the CEF group, the CAZ-AVI MIC range was 0.06-0.25 
mg/L and the MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L. 
For the 46 E. coli isolates in the CAZ-AVI group, the CAZ MIC range was ≤0.06-0.64 mg/L and MIC90 was 
0.0.25 mg/L. For the 20 E. coli isolates in the CEF group, the CAZ MIC range was 0.12-16.0 mg/L and MIC90 
was 0.0.25 mg/L. 
For the 46 E. coli isolates in the CAZ-AVI group, the CEF MIC range was ≤0.015->16.0 mg/L and MIC90 was 
0.06 mg/L. For the 20 E. coli isolates in the CEF group, the CEF MIC range was ≤0.015->16.0 mg/L and 
MIC90 was 0.25 mg/L. 
Overall, there were no isolates tested that were reported as being non-susceptible to CAZ-AVI. There were 
2 patients (both in Cohort 2) in the CAZ-AVI group infected with ceftazidime non-susceptible (CAZ-NS) E. 
coli; one patient had E. coli at baseline that was resistant to ceftazidime (MIC = 32 µg/mL) and had 
favourable clinical responses at all time points; one patient had E. coli at baseline that was resistant to 
ceftazidime (MIC = 64 µg/mL) and had favourable clinical responses at all time points except for the EOT 
visit, at which the response was indeterminate. The one patient in the CEF group (in Cohort 3) infected with 
CAZ-NS E. coli had an isolate that was also resistant to CEF at baseline (MIC = >16 µg/mL) and was a clinical 
failure. 
There were 5 patients in each treatment group (CAZ-AVI: 5/54 [9.3%] and CEF: 5/23 [21.7%]) at TOC with 
persistent Enterobacteriaceae infections. At LFU, there were 6/54 patients with persistent pathogens 
(11.1%) in the CAZ-AVI group and 5/23 (21.7%) in the CEF group. All patients who had a microbiological 
response of persistence (EOIV, EOT, TOC and/or LFU) in the micro-ITT analysis set had E. coli as a baseline 
pathogen. The microbiological outcome of persistence at a particular visit was carried forward to subsequent 
visits. There were no reported cases of pathogens with reported persistence with increasing MIC in either 
treatment group. 
Review of per-pathogen responses by MIC did not identify any notable trends. For the predominant 
pathogen (E. coli), there was no indication that increasing MIC was associated with a lower favourable 
response rate in either treatment group. 
Treatment emergent infections 
A total of 3 patients (7.3%) in the CAZ-AVI group had treatment emergent infections, whereas none were 
occurring in the CEF group as assessed by the ECMA review committee. Of the three new infections, two 
patients were reported to have both underlying urological abnormalities and complicating factors. 
In addition to those emergent infections as assessed by the ECMA review committee, there were five cases 
of new infection reported . These 5 cases were reviewed by the study team and determined not to be new 
infections. None of the 5 cases met the definition in the study SAP: “A urine culture identified pathogen other 
than a baseline pathogen at any time after study treatment has finished along with worsening signs and 
symptoms of infection requiring alternative antimicrobial therapy.” 
The CHMP noted that, at TOC and LFU, a high proportion of patients in the micro-ITT population for both 
treatment groups had persistent Enterobacteriaceae infections, i.e. 9.3% (5/54) and 11.1% (6/54; 1 
additional patient), respectively, in the CAZ-AVI group, and 21.7% (5/23) for both visits in the CEF group. 
All patients who had a microbiological response of persistence had an infection caused by E. coli. Considering 
uncertain adequacy of CAZ-AVI exposure, this is not unexpected. 
No new infections occurred during the study in the CEF treatment group, whereas three patients (7.3%) had 
treatment emergent infections in the CAZ-AVI group. Two of these patients had both complicating factors 
and underlying urological abnormalities.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This variation application is intended to broaden the approved indication for CAZ-AVI to include paediatric 
population 3 months to <18 years of age with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and complicated 
intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH conducted two phase 2 studies that aimed to include children from 3 months to less than 18 years 
of age with cIAI (c3591004) and cUTI (study C3591005). The phase 2 studies were open label, 
observer-blinded, randomised, active-controlled studies, in which efficacy was defined as a secondary 
objective, and hence was not powered to determine efficacy. According to draft “Addendum to the guideline 
on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections to address 
paediatric-specific clinical data requirements (EMA/187859/2017)”, no appropriately powered efficacy study 
is requested in the paediatric population. Efficacy can be extrapolated from data in adults provided that 
similar exposure of CAZ-AVI is achieved and a sufficiently amount of safety data is collected in the paediatric 
age groups. Thus, the efficacy data in this submission are only descriptive and this is considered acceptable. 
The MAH chose meropenem as comparator in the cIAI study and cefepime (CEF) in the cUTI study. Both 
antibacterial agents are approved and widely used for treating paediatric patients with cIAI and cUTI, 
including pyelonephritis, respectively. 
A high proportion of patients in both studies received concomitant systemic antibiotics (86% overall in the 
cIAI study and 42% in the cUTI study). The MAH enlightens that this was due to the fact that the time points 
for starting/ending the dosing of concomitant systemic antibiotics were not collected. Systemic antibiotics 
taken during Day 1 of IV study medication administration therefore had been reported as both prior and 
concomitant medications. In addition, there is a marked difference between the two treatment groups with 
a higher proportion of concomitant antibiotics used in the CEF group compared to the CAZ-AVI group (53.6% 
vs. 37.3%). This could potentially have influenced both the type and frequencies of AEs reported within the 
two treatment groups. Furthermore, it is noted that the investigators have only reported two cIAI patients 
and one cUTI patient who had important protocol deviations related to receipt of prohibited concomitant 
medications across all cohorts. Lack of data collection on the duration of prior/concomitant treatments is 
considered a weakness of the conduct of the study. However, considering that the efficacy should be 
extrapolated from adults this issue will not be further pursued with regards to efficacy. Please refer to the 
clinical pharmacology section for more information regarding the extrapolation. 
One of the main changes in amendment 2 of the protocol for both studies were removal of a specific 
exclusion criterion related to immunocompromised patients (enacted in amendment 2). Since 
immunocompromised patients are more likely to develop infections and therefore constitute an important 
patient population intended for parenteral antibiotic therapy in clinical practice, efficacy in these patients is 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 125/167 
 
 
  
  
 
 
relevant for the evaluation of the efficacy outcomes of CAZ-AVI. The MAH was therefore asked in the 
previous round to submit an overview of the number of immunocompromised patients enrolled in the two 
studies, and provide an overview of the overall efficacy outcomes related to the baseline pathogens in these 
patients compared to other patients who were not immunocompromised. The MAH clarified in the response 
to this request that only one patient enrolled in the cUTI study potentially could have been 
immunocompromised. This apparent lack of enrolment of immunocompromised patients in the two clinical 
studies could be expected, since these patients initially were excluded from being enrolled and the two 
amendments, which allowed enrolment of immunocompromised patients, were implemented relative late 
prior to LSLV in both studies. The MAH informs that the remaining paediatric studies that are being 
conducted as part of a PIP (Decision P/0062/2017), which include study C3591024 in neonates and study 
C3591024 in patients with HAP/VAP (single-dose PK), will allow for enrolment of immunocompromised 
patients. 
Complicated intra-abdominal infection 
Initially, the protocol was approved by the PDCO based on inclusion of 80% of patient with focus of infection 
in the appendix. However, the protocol was later amended to allow for inclusion of a higher proportion of 
patients (90%) with infection originating from appendix. It is acknowledged that appendicitis is the most 
commonly diagnosed cIAI in children. Furthermore, since the population pharmacokinetics (PK) modelling 
demonstrates that disease severity has minimal effect on CAZ-AVI exposure, the high proportion of patients 
with appendicitis is not considered to affect the applicability of the study results to cIAI patients with 
non-appendicitis type infections. Therefore, the change to include 90% appendicitis is considered 
acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Complicated intra-abdominal infection 
In total 61 subjects were included to receive CAZ-AVI + MTZ in the study compared to 22 subjects in the 
meropenem group. The demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. 
European subjects were adequately represented; 64% male with median age 11.0 years in the CAZ-AVI plus 
MTZ group.  
Most patients (90%) in both treatment groups in the ITT and CE population had appendix as primary focus 
of infection and was diagnosed as appendiceal perforation or peri-appendiceal abscess. Recruitment in the 
lowest age group (3 to < 6 years) was low (n=6) and no children below the age of 2 years were included to 
receive CAZ-AVI + MTZ. Although very few or no patients were included in the youngest age cohorts, the 
efficacy results presented in the initial MA application for the adult cIAI indication can be extrapolated to the 
paediatric population provided similar exposure of CAZ-AVI. In addition, efficacy observed in the youngest 
cUTI children could be extrapolated to the same age cohorts for the cIAI patients as these two infectious 
diseases are expected to have similar pathophysiology. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 126/167 
 
 
  
  
The microbiological intent-to treat (micro-ITT) population, which included all patients who had at least one 
baseline intra-abdominal pathogen, consisted of 69 patients (CAZ-AVY + MTZ, n=50; meropenem, n=19). 
The predominant baseline pathogens were E. coli (79.7%) and P. aeruginosa (33.3%). 
A high proportion of patients completed the trial (98%), with no major imbalances between treatment 
groups. Premature discontinuations were few and evenly distributed between treatment groups. 
In general, across all analysis sets, favourable clinical response rates of > 90% were observed at the End of 
72 hours IV visit and were sustained through the LFU visit for both treatment groups. The clinical response 
rates in the individual cohorts were in general consistent with those observed in the overall study population, 
except for cohort 1 (12-18 years of age). In this cohort, it seems to be numerical lower clinical cure rates 
across all analysis populations at TOC. Although efficacy in the paediatric population could be extrapolated 
from adults, it should be noted that it was only in cohort 1 all clinical failures were identified of CAZ-AVI in 
this specific age group. The MAH is therefore asked to clarify the dose and duration of IV therapy received, 
as well as the duration and type of oral treatment given to the four patients who had a clinical failure, and the 
one who was indeterminate.  
In the micro-ITT population, clinical response rates at TOC for the predominant pathogens, E.coli and 
P.aeruginosa were >90% and >85%, respectively for patients treated with CAZ-AVI + MTZ, and >92% and 
>88%, respectively for patients treated with meropenem. Approximately the same results were observed 
for the ME population. Most microbiological outcomes were presumed eradicated based on clinical response; 
showing a similar pattern to the per-patient clinical response for the pathogens isolated. It is not unexpected 
for an indication like cIAI that the majority of the microbiological results were based on presumed 
eradication. Review of per-pathogen responses by MIC did not identify any trends. For predominant 
pathogens, such as E. coli and P. aeruginosa, there was no indication that increasing MICs were associated 
with a lower favourable response rate in either treatment group. 
Complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) 
Of the 101 enrolled cUTI patients, 97 were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive CAZ-AVI or CEF and 95 
received treatment (67 were treated in the CAZ-AVI group and 28 were treated in the CEF group). The 
paediatric age groups who received CAZ-AVI were as follows: 12 to <18 years (n=13), 6 to < 12 years 
(n=17), 3 to < 6 years (n=11), and i3 months of age to <2 years (n=27). The inclusion of patients was well 
balanced between the four different age cohorts. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics appear relatively well balanced between the treatment 
groups. The majority of cUTI patients were diagnosed with acute pyelonephritis at screening, i.e. 82.1% and 
85.7% in the CAZ-AVI and CEF groups, respectively. The median age of the enrolled patients was 3.87 
years. The majority were female, White, enrolled in European, and 66.3% had normal renal function (i.e. 
CrCl ≥ 80 ml/min/1.73 m2). Most of the patents did not have any complicating factors of the urinary tract 
infections beyond the requirements from the inclusion criteria (77.9% overall) or had any urological 
abnormalities (84.2% overall). 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 95 patients (CAZ-AVI, n=67, CEF, n= 28) who were 
randomised and received treatment. A comparable exposure was observed across the different age cohorts 
within the two treatment groups. 
Approximately 80% of the patients in each treatment group belonged to the micro-ITT analysis set with a 
baseline pathogen, and approximately 70% in each treatment group were considered clinically evaluable at 
the TOC visit. None of the patients in the micro-ITT analysis set was infected with Gram-negative pathogens 
other than Enterobacteriaceae. The majority of patients in both treatment groups (>90%) who had 
microbiologically confirmed disease were infected by E.coli, which is the most common infectious cause to 
UTI, particular if it is a first infection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 127/167 
 
 
  
  
In general, favourable clinical response rates were high across all analysis sets in both treatment groups and 
the rates were sustained from the end of the 72 hours visit through to the EOT visit, with responses 
remaining ≥ 80% at LFU for the ITT, micro-ITT, and CE analysis sets of both treatment groups. At the TOC 
visit, 86.8% and 82.6% in the ITT population of the CAZ-AVI and CEF groups, respectively, had a favourable 
clinical response. No numerical trends pointed to any specific efficacy concern for CAZ-AVI. 
The per-patient microbiological success rates in the micro-ITT analysis set at both the EOIV and TOC visits 
were lower than the clinical response rates in both treatment groups. The eradication rates at the TOC visit 
were 79.6% for the CAZ-AVI group compared to 60.9% for the CEF group, indicating that the pathogens 
were more susceptible to CAZ-AVI. Moreover, favourable combined response rates at the EOIV visit for the 
micro-ITT analysis set were 79.6% in the CAZ-AVI group and 78.3% in the CEF group. The combined 
success rates were numerical lower at the TOC visit, i.e. 72.2% for the CAZ-AVI group and 60.9% for the 
CEF group. Hence, the combined clinical and microbiological success rates observed in the micro-ITT 
population at the TOC visit points to a numerical trend of better efficacy of CAZ-AVI compared to CEF. 
However, the study was not statistically powered to demonstrate efficacy. 
The total proportion of patients with a baseline diagnosis of AP was >80% and the relative frequency was 
comparable between the two treatment groups, i.e. 81% (55/68) in the CAZ-AVI group and 86% (25/29) in 
the CEF group. The clinical success rates at the TOC visit remained high for patients treated with CAZ-AVI 
regardless of the diagnosis of AP and was consistent with the overall clinical response. For patient treated 
with CEF, a higher proportion of patients with AP in the micro-ITT analysis set at TOC had a favourable 
clinical response compared to those without AP. The opposite was seen for patients treated with CEF in the 
ME at TOC analysis set. However, caution should be taken when interpreting the results as only a limited 
number of patients without AP have been included in the separate analysis sets. 
The eradication rates of infections due to E.coli in the micro-ITT analysis set at the TOC visit were 79.6% in 
the CAZ-AVI group and 59.1% in the CEF group, and 86.5% and 66.7%, respectively, in the ME analysis set. 
The microbiological eradication rates appeared to be low at the LFU visit in both treatment groups, i.e. 
29.6% in the CAZ-AVI group and 17.4% in the CEF group. According to the MAH, this was mainly due to 
indeterminate responses for around 60% of the patients in each treatment group. In addition, the 
proportions of clinical evaluable patients with a favourable clinical response at LFU were high in both 
treatment groups, i.e. 93.2% and 100% in the CAZ-AVI and CEF groups, respectively, implying that most of 
the patients had a sustained clinical response to the study treatment. 
A higher proportion of patients in the micro-ITT population at the TOC and LFU visits who were treated with 
CEF compared to CAZ-AVI had persistent Enterobacteriaceae infections, i.e. 21.7% for both visits in the CEF 
group, and 9.3% and 11.1% (1 additional patient) in the CAZ-AVI group, respectively. All patients who had 
a microbiological response of persistence had an infection caused by E. coli. Although the number of patients 
in each treatment group is low, the clinical responses observed at TOC and LFU indicate a numerical trend in 
favour of CAZ-AVI. 
No new infections occurred during the study in the CEF treatment group, whereas three patients (7.3%) had 
treatment emergent infections in the CAZ-AVI group. Two of these patients had both underlying urological 
abnormalities and complicating factors rendering them more susceptible for a new infection. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considered the submitted efficacy data to support the extension of indication for CAZ-AVI to 
include treatment of the paediatric population from age 3 months to 18 years with cUTI and cIAI.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In seven Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, 2024 adult patients were treated with Zavicefta. The most 
common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of patients treated with Zavicefta were Coombs direct test 
positive, nausea, and diarrhoea. Nausea and diarrhoea were usually mild or moderate in intensity. 
In the SmPC for Zavicefta, there are warnings and precautions regarding hypersensitivity reactions, 
Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea, renal impairment, concurrent treatment with high doses of 
cephalosporins and nephrotoxic medicinal products, and direct antiglobulin test (DAGT or Coombs test) 
seroconversion and potential risk of haemolytic anaemia. 
An overview is given on the important identified and potential risks in adults in the initial RMP submission 
and which were approved in the initial MAA in 2016. 
Table 69. Listing of Important Identified and Potential Risks in the Initial RMP Submission 
The assessment of safety in children with cIAIs and cUTis is based on data from two phase 2 paediatric 
studies and the population PK modelling/simulation analyses that are submitted to support the current 
extension of the indication. 
The present application for extension of indication to include children presents a summary of pooled safety 
data from these two Phase 2 paediatric studies: 
•  Study C3591004 (Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) Study 4, previously referred to as Study 
D4280C00015 by AstraZeneca): A Single Blind, Randomised, Multi-centre, Active Controlled, Trial to 
Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Ceftazidime and Avibactam When 
given in Combination with Metronidazole, Compared with Meropenem, in Children from 3 months to 
Less Than 18 years of Age with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections (cIAIs). 
•  Study C3591005 (PIP Study 5, previously referred to as Study D4280C00016 by AstraZeneca): A 
Single Blind, Randomised, Multi-centre, Active Controlled, Trial to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of Ceftazidime and Avibactam Compared With Cefepime In Children 
From 3 Months to Less Than 18 Years of Age With Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTIs). 
These studies were conducted as part of the agreed European Union (EU) Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP). 
Both studies were initially sponsored by AstraZeneca. Sponsorship for Study D4280C00015 was transferred 
to Pfizer, Inc, on 17 July 2017, and for Study D4280C00016 was transferred on 18 September 2017. For the 
purposes of this submission, Studies D4280C00015 and D4280C00016, are referred to by the Pfizer study 
numbers of C3591004 and C3591005, respectively.

A PDCO/EMA compliance report was adopted on 01 February 2019 in scope of procedure 
EMEA-C2-001313-PIP01-12-M08. 
The paediatric data were analysed in comparison with the known safety profile of ceftazidime monotherapy 
in children, as presented in the United Kingdom (UK) Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the 
United States Prescribing Information (USPI), and with the observed safety profile of CAZ-AVI from the 
pooled Phase 2/3 adult studies.  
There are 2 planned clinical studies in paediatric patients: a 2 part, single- and multiple dose study in 
neonates (Study D4280C00017, also known as C3591024, or PIP study 6) and a single dose PK study in 
paediatric patients with HAP/VAP (Study D4280C00028, also known as C3591025, or PIP study 8) (Table on 
clinical studies given in Section 3).  
According  to  Draft  guideline  EMA/187859/2017  “Addendum  to  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal 
products  indicated  for  treatment  of  bacterial  infections  to  address  paediatric-specific  clinical  data 
requirements”,  no  appropriately  powered  efficacy  studies  are  requested  in  the  paediatric  population  as 
efficacy  can  be  extrapolated  from  adults  provided  that  similar  exposure  is  achieved  in  the  paediatric 
population. Furthermore, sufficient safety data have to be generated with the intended dose regimen in the 
paediatric population. In both paediatric studies submitted to support the indication extensions, safety and 
tolerability are primary endpoint, while pharmacokinetic and efficacy variables are secondary. 
The extension of indication to include paediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 18 years for Zavicefta 
was  suggested  by  the  CHMP  to  be  further  extended  to  include  the  other  approved  Zavicefta  indications 
HAP/VAP and aerobic Gram-negative infections in patients with limited treatment options, in addition to cIAI 
and cUTI. 
The CHMP noted that this safety assessment is based on the two phase 2 single-blind, randomized, 
multicenter active-controlled studies of paediatric patients aged ≥3 months to 18 years. This safety 
evaluation presents a summary of the safety data and emphasises the pooled safety data from the two 
paediatric studies. Details from the individual studies are presented when applicable. 
No clinical study results have yet been reported for children with the indication of HAP/VAP and aerobic 
Gram-negative infections in patients with limited treatment options. These two indications are based on 
extrapolation from adult indication. 
Patient exposure 
The first study of CAZ-AVI in paediatric patients (Study D4280C00014) was a Phase 1, single-dose, 
pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety study in 32 paediatric patients with ages ranging from 3 months to <18 
years, with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection for which they were receiving other systemic antibiotic 
therapy. Data from this study were used in PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and simulations to support 
dose selection for the subsequent Phase 2 Studies C3591004 and C3591005. Studies C3591004 and 
C3591005 were initiated in 2015 and both studies have now been completed, along with population PK 
(popPK) and PK/PD target attainment analyses to support paediatric dose regimens (CAZ-MS-PED-02).  
The safety assessment is based on a total of 128 children exposed in the two   paediatric studies conducted 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile of CAZ-AVI in paediatric subjects from 3 months to 
<18 years of age when given as treatment in subjects with cIAI (Study D4280C00015 [C3591004]) and cUTI 
(Study D4280C00016 [C3591005]). In both studies, patients were allocated to 1 of 4 cohorts based on age. 
Randomisation was stratified as follows: 
•  Cohort 1: Patients aged from 12 years to <18 years; 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 130/167 
 
 
  
  
 
•  Cohort 2: Patients aged from 6 years to <12 years; 
•  Cohort 3: Patients aged from 2 years to <6 years; 
•  Cohort 4: Patients aged from 3 months to <2 years, comprising Cohorts 4a and 4b as  follows: 
•  Cohort 4a: Patients aged from 1 year to <2 years; 
•  Cohort 4b: Patients aged from 3 months to <1 year.  
Patients were randomised 3:1 to the CAZ-AVI ± metronidazole or comparator treatment groups. The 
proposed sample size for each study was 80 evaluable patients comprised of a minimum of 60 and 20 
patients, respectively, from the CAZ-AVI ± metronidazole and comparator groups. An evaluable patient was 
defined as a subject having completed at least 72 hours of treatment (3 full days). The sample size was 
based on the probability of observing a ‘rare’ safety event. The ‘rare’ term used in this section is not based 
on the regulatory definition but is instead intended to reflect uncommon events with an underlying incidence 
rate of 3%. A total of at least 120 patients were to be treated with CAZ-AVI in both studies combined, when 
assuming an underlying incidence rate of 3% for a specific ‘rare’ event, to ensure that the probability of 
observing such an event in at least 1 patient treated with CAZ-AVI exceeded 95%.  
A description of both Phase 2 studies is provided in Table 70.

AEs = Adverse events; CAZ-AVI = ceftazidime-avibactam; cIAI = complicated intra-abdominal infection; cUTI =

q8h = quaque octa hora (every 8 hours); SAE = serious adverse events. 
* Cohort 1: Patients aged from 12 years to <18 years; Cohort 2: Patients aged from 6 years to <12 years; Cohort 3: 
Patients aged from 2 years to <6 years; Cohort 4: Patients aged from 3 months to <2 years, comprising Cohorts 4a and 
4b as follows: Cohort 4a: Patients aged from 1 year to <2 years; Cohort 4b: Patients aged from 3 months to <1 year. 
Doses of CAZ-AVI for the individual cohorts are given in the table found under the subheading Treatment 
below, including the dose reduction for patients with renal impairment. Due to differences in the two studies 
drug dosing regimens and the large fluid load that would be necessitated with double-blinded therapy, 
blinding of the treatment groups was not considered feasible for the study. The use of a single-blind study 
observer was chosen, which is a well-accepted study design feature for paediatric clinical trials. As children 
are a vulnerable population, this design allowed for close clinical monitoring by the Unblinded Observers 
while preserving the ability to assess safety and clinical response without bias through use of a Blinded 
Observer at each study site.

The numbers of patients included in each of the safety analysis datasets are summarised in Table 71. Of the 
178 patients who were randomised to receive CAZ-AVI ± MTZ or comparator, 128 were treated in the 
CAZ-AVI ± MTZ group and 50 were treated in the comparator group. 
In Study C3591004, most patients were recruited to Cohorts 1 and 2 with 30 (CAZ-AVI + MTZ n = 22 and 
meropenem n = 8) and 43 (CAZ-AVI + MTZ n = 33 and meropenem n =10) patients randomised, 
respectively. Cohort 3 randomised 9 patients (CAZ-AVI + MTZ (n = 6 and meropenem n = 3), and Cohort 4 
randomised 1 patient (meropenem).  
In  Study  C3591005,  most  patients  were  recruited  to  Cohort  4  with  38  patients  (CAZ-AVI  n  =  27  and 
cefepime n = 11) randomised. Cohort 1 randomised 19 patients (CAZ-AVI n = 13 and cefepime n = 6), 
Cohort  2  randomised  22  patients  (CAZ-AVI  n  =  17  and  cefepime  n  =  5),  and  Cohort  3  randomised  18 
patients (CAZ- AVI n = 11 and cefepime n = 7

Safety Analysis Datasets 
This pooled paediatric safety data report presents analyses for the Safety Analysis Sets pooled for both 
studies, namely, all randomised patients who received any amount of IV study therapy (i.e. CAZ-AVI plus 
metronidazole or meropenem in Study C3591004, and CAZ-AVI or cefepime in Study C3591005). 
Treatment 
Overview of exposure of CAZ-AVI in the two pediatric studies are given in Table 73. 
Table 73. Exposure to CAZ-AVI by age group 
The dosage regimens for the Paediatric Studies C3591004 (cIAI) and C3591005 (cUTI) are given below.

Table 74. CAZ-AVI Dose Regimens by Age, Weight and Creatinine Clearance 
Dosing for Metronidazole (anaerob coverage in the CAZ/AVI treatment group) in the cIAI study, C3591004  
Metronidazole was included to provide anaerobic coverage, as it was in the adult trials. The suggested dose 
regimen of metronidazole is 10 mg/kg IV, administered over 20 to 30 minutes every 8 hours (±30 minutes), 
but it could also have been prescribed/adjusted by the Investigator according to local labels. The 
metronidazole infusion was to be started no later than 30 minutes after completion of the CAZ-AVI infusion. 
Prior or concomitant medications 
A great proportion (37 and 54% in the CAZ-AVI and cefepime treatment arms, respectively, in the UTI 
study, and approx. 86% in both treatment groups in the cIAI study) of the paediatric patients received other 
systemic antibiotics reported either before or concomitantly with the CAZ-AVI treatment. The most frequent 
systemic antibiotic administered was cefuroxime sodium in the cUTI study, whereas in the cIAI study, the 
most frequent concomitant systemic antibiotic administered was gentamicin. This co-medication use will 
possibly hamper the evaluation of CAZ-AVI treatment, both regarding efficacy and safety, in the children. 
[According to the MAH, the apparent high proportion of patients with concomitant systemic antibiotics could 
be explained by the fact that since time of dose was not collected, systemic antibiotics taken during Day 1 of 
IV study medication administration are reported as both prior and concomitant medications.] 
More details on treatment regimens, including the comparator arms (meropenem in the cIAI study 
C3591004 and cefepime in the cUTI study, C3591005), and concomitant treatments, are given in section 3 
on Efficacy.  
Extent of exposure 
For the cUTI study, in all cohorts combined, the median (minimum-maximum) exposure to IV study drug 
was 4 (1-11) days for the CAZ-AVI group and 4 (2-11) days for the CEF group.  
Around 90% of patients in both treatment groups were switched to oral therapy to complete their study 
treatment, and most of these switched between either 3-5 or 6-9 days after initiation of study treatment. 
The  median  duration of  oral  drug  exposure  was  7  days  for  both  treatment  groups.  The  majority  (84/95 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 134/167 
 
 
  
  
 
[88.4%]) of patients received IV + oral therapy for 8-15 days, consistent with the protocol recommended 
treatment duration of 7 to 14 days (IV + oral therapy combined). 
In the cIAI study, for all cohorts combined, the median (minimum-maximum) exposure to IV study drug 
was 7 (2-13) days for both the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole and meropenem treatment groups. In terms of 
the individual components, the median (minimum-maximum) exposure was 7 (2-13) days for CAZ-AVI, 
metronidazole, and meropenem. 
Approximately 69% of patients in both treatment groups were switched to oral therapy to complete their 
study treatment. The median duration of oral drug exposure was 6 and 7 days for patients in the CAZ-AVI 
plus metronidazole and meropenem treatment groups, respectively. The majority (67/83 [80.7%]) of 
patients in the study received 8 to 20 days of IV + oral therapy, consistent with the protocol recommended 
treatment duration of 7 to 15 days (IV + oral therapy combined). 
For the pooled studies 
Overall, a total of 128 subjects received CAZ-AVI±MTZ and 50 subjects received comparator. For the pooled 
data, the median (minimum-maximum) duration of exposure to IV study drug was 5 (1 to 13) days for the 
CAZ-AVI ± MTZ group and 6 (2 to 13) days for the comparator group (Table 75). 
Among patients with cIAI, the median (minimum to maximum) duration of exposure to IV CAZ-AVI was 7 (1 
to 21) days in adults and 7 (2 to 13) days in paediatric patients. More than 90% of adults in the studies 
assessed in support of the MA application received the recommended 5 to 14 days of treatment compared to 
82% of paediatric patients receiving 5 to 15 days. Among patients with cUTI, the median (minimum to 
maximum) duration of exposure to IV CAZ-AVI was 7 (1 to 21) days in adults and 4 (1 to 11) days in 
paediatric patients. More than 80% of adults received the recommended 5 to 10 days of treatment 
compared to 34% of paediatric patients. This likely reflects the earlier switch to oral therapy seen in the 
paediatric studies; while the safety profile is consequently based on a shorter duration of therapy than 
adults, this reflects clinical practice in the paediatric population.

A global access programme (GAP [compassionate use]) for individual named patient requests for CAZ-AVI 
has been in place for countries outside of the United States and Canada since 01 February 2015. Cumulative 
to 31 October 2018, CAZ-AVI has been supplied through the GAP for 946 courses for 908 individual named 
patients. Of the 946 courses, 26 were courses for paediatric patients (of which 20 were from EU countries). 
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
Demographic Characteristics 
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics for the 178 patients included in the pooled paediatric 
Safety Analysis Set (128 in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ group and 50 in the comparator group) were generally 
balanced between treatment groups. The highest proportion of patients were female (about 60%), White 
(about 78%) and from Eastern Europe (about 40%). The mean age was approximately 8 years with a range 
of 3 months to 17 years. About 3/4 of patients in each treatment group were ≥6 years of age. 
Patient Characteristics at Baseline 
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) for all patients was balanced across treatment groups for height (126.2 
± 34.5 cm CAZ-AVI versus 123.1 ± 35.7 cm comparator), weight (32.2 ± 19.6 kg CAZ-AVI versus 31.0 ± 
20.4 kg comparator), body mass index (BMI) (18.29 ± 3.83 kg/m2 CAZ-AVI versus 18.46 ± 4.41 kg/m2 
comparator), and baseline CrCL (105.8 ±39.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 CAZ-AVI versus 104.0 ± 35.8 ml/min/1.73 
m2 comparator). At baseline, the majority of patients (>70%) had creatinine clearance values in the normal 
range of ≥80 mL/min for both treatment groups. Overall 25% subjects taking CAZ-AVI ± MTZ and 18% 
comparator had mild renal insufficiency with creatinine clearance values ≥50 to <80 mL/min. One patient in 
each group had a creatinine clearance value <50 mL/min.  
The CHMP acknowledged that Study D4280C00015 compared CAZ-AVI + MTZ to meropenem for treatment 
of cIAI. Study D4280C00016 compared CAZ-AVI to cefepime for treatment of cUTI. Since the dose regimen 
of CAZ-AVI is the same in each age category in the two studies, it is considered acceptable to pool the safety 
data from two studies even though there is different indications and different comparators used in the two 
studies. However, there are differences between the studies, which could impact the results of the pooling, 
see further below. 
It should, however, be noted that the median exposure to IV study drug was quite different in the two 
studies;  median (minimum-maximum) exposure was 7 (2-13) days for the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole 
group in the cIAI study versus  4 (1-11) days for the CAZ-AVI group in the cUTI study. However, there were 
comparable durations in the treatment arms within each study. The recommended duration of treatment in 
the proposed SmPC is 5-14 days for both indications. It is considered that the duration of treatment actually 
performed in the two studies are relevant for evaluation of safety. 
Study D4280C00014 was a Phase 1 single-dose PK study to determine dosing and will not be considered in 
the analysis of safety.  
In total, 67 pediatric patients were exposed to CAZ-AVI in the cUTI study and 61 pediatric patients were 
exposed to CAZ-AVI + metronidazole in the cIAI study for a total of 128 patients. A total of 50 patients 
received the comparator drug, either meropenem or cefepime. The stratification of patients into four age 
cohorts is considered relevant for the safety assessment. Exposure to CAZ-AVI by age group is given in a 
table above, and as shown here, there are differences regarding the recruitment of patients into the different 
age cohorts in the cIAI and cUTI studies (study C3591004 and study C3591005, respectively). For the safety 
assessment of CAZ-AVI in cIAI it is noted that there were more patients in the older age groups in the cIAI 
study, and none included in the age group under 2 years of age. This may reflect that cIAIs are more 
common in the older age groups, while cUTIs are also seen in the youngest age groups. However, except 
abovementioned limitations, the safety database is considered by the Committee adequate in terms of size 
and target population. With regards to renal function, see the section on Safety in special populations.

Adverse events 
The primary objective of both studies was to assess the safety and tolerability of CAZ-AVI. AEs with an onset 
date and time on or after the date and time of the first dose of study drug up to and including the last visit 
were summarised.  
The primary outcome variables were: 
•  AEs and serious AEs (SAEs); 
•  Cephalosporin class effects and additional AEoSI; 
•  Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature); 
• 
• 
•  CrCl; 
• 
Electrocardiogram (ECG). 
Laboratory parameters; 
Physical examination; 
There were no specifications provided with respect to collection of subjective AEs across various age groups 
in either of the 2 clinical studies. Safety data collection relied on the investigator to obtain and record on the 
CRF all observed or volunteered AEs and their severity (mild, moderate, or severe). All AEs were recorded in 
the CRF, including those spontaneously reported by the patient or care provider, reported in response to the 
open question from the study personnel: ‘Have you/the child had any health problems since the previous 
visit/you were last asked?’, or revealed by observations. No specific methodology beyond this assessment 
was required by the protocol and the MAH is not aware of any validated tools to facilitate assessment of 
subjective AEs in the very youngest (ie, nonverbal) paediatric patients. Therefore, as noted, some subjective 
AEs may not be wellcaptured in the youngest children, however less specific AEs such as irritability, inability 
to settle or crying might indicate if the child was experiencing such an event. Assessment of the reported 
cases did not identify clustering with regards to this pattern of AE reporting in the pooled paediatric safety 
data for CAZ-AVI.  
Adverse events in all studies were collected from the time of signing the consent form until the subject 
completed the study, in line with GCP principles. For the purposes of the pooled paediatric dataset, 
comprising Studies C3591004 and C3591005, the last timepoint for collecting safety data and at which the 
subject ended the study was named “last visit”.  
The subjects received CAZ-AVI as intravenous (IV) therapy, therefore for the pooled safety dataset, the last 
timepoint at which they received CAZ-AVI was designated End of IV therapy (EOIV), to differentiate from 
any protocolled continuation of oral study therapy. For the purposes of AE analysis, this time point is 24 
hours after the start of the last infusion, to ensure that any AEs that occurred before CAZ-AVI was cleared 
from the subject were also assessed as “on therapy” AEs. 
For both studies, the end of IV therapy was designated as the EOIV visit. The total treatment period was to 
be between 7 and 15 days. The duration of each patient’s participation in the study was to be a minimum of 
27 days to a maximum of 50 days after the start of study treatment (first dose) at which time there was a 
late follow-up (LFU) assessment. The LFU assessment was to be performed 20 to 35 days after the last dose 
of any treatment. 
Adverse events are presented up to EOIV and up to last visit. The EOIV is defined as the last IV dose/time 
+ 24 hours, ie, an AE is classified as ‘up to EOIV’ if date of onset of AE ≤ end date/time of last IV dose + 
24h. The Last visit is defined as any event which occurred from the beginning of the first dose of study drug 
up to the time that the subject completed the study and had their last interaction with the study site, which 
could be a month after last dose of study therapy.

The CHMP acknowledged that details regarding the safety data collection in the paediatric studies C3591004 
and C3591005 were submitted during the course of the procedure, as requested. Safety data collection 
relied on the investigator to obtain and record on the CRF all observed or volunteered AEs and their severity 
score. All AEs were recorded in the CRF, including those spontaneously reported by the patient or care 
provider, reported in response to the open question from the study personnel to the parents of the child 
treated. 
Acceptable definitions of terms and details regarding timelines for collecting AEs in the paediatric studies 
were also provided for clarification, as requested. 
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) for the Pooled Paediatric Data 
Methodology 
For laboratory-based medical concepts, the following algorithm was used: if either of the following criteria, 
or both, were fulfilled, the patient was counted as having an ADR for calculation of frequency (each patient 
was counted only once): 
1. Subject had at least 1 AE defined by a MedDRA PT which aligned with that laboratory based 
medical concept, and/or 
2. Subject had at least 1 potentially clinically significant (PCS) laboratory value for an ADR, as 
defined for each laboratory investigation, based on a value with multiples of > upper limit of normal 
(ULN) or < lower limit of normal (LLN) and percentage change from baseline (eg, with respect to 
thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis, the number of PCS events for platelets was the number of 
patients with both baseline and post-baseline values <0.65 x LLN and >50% decrease from 
baseline, or number of patients with both baseline and post-baseline values >1.5 x ULN and >100% 
increase from baseline, respectively). 
Only AEs with an onset date and time (and lab samples with a sample date and time) on or after the date and 
time of first dose and up to last visit were included. 
Methodology for Coombs Test seroconversion 
The estimated Coombs seroconversion rate was based on data from 81 (63.3%) CAZ-AVI ± MTZ patients in 
the Paediatric pool who had an initial negative Coombs test and at least 1 follow-up test. Overall, Coombs 
seroconversion rate at any time up to the last visit for patients with a baseline negative result and at least 
1 post-baseline result was 3.7% (3 of 81 patients; 1 with cIAI and 2 with cUTI). Further analysis was 
conducted to also include patients who had at least 2 post-baseline Coombs results, of which the first was 
negative. This was to include patients with a missing baseline value but with evidence of seroconversion. No 
additional patients were identified.  
The ADR rates of positive Coombs test were higher in the comparators group than the CAZ-AVI. No patients 
in the paediatric clinical development program had an AE of haemolytic anaemia during their respective 
study.  
Analysis of ADR Frequencies 
The frequency in the paediatric pool is compared with the frequency in the adult pool in Table 76. Also shown 
is the frequency category as presented in the IB and SmPC approved in adults. The frequencies were 
generally in line with those of the adult pool and the known paediatric safety profile of ceftazidime. In 
addition, the FORTUM SmPC for ceftazidime monotherapy was also used to define the frequencies presented 
in the IB and the European SmPC; if the Fortum frequency was higher than that observed in the adult pooled 
CAZ-AVI studies, the higher frequency category was used. Any differences between the paediatric and adult 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 138/167 
 
 
  
  
 
CAZ-AVI frequencies should be interpreted with caution given the limited numbers of paediatric patients. 
However, some differences, such as headache and nausea, can be explained by the fact that very young 
children are naturally less likely than adults to report AEs associated with these symptoms, and other 
symptoms such as vomiting can be explained by the fact that decreasing age increases the risk of 
post-operative nausea and vomiting.1 
In addition, as expected for the low numbers of patients, no ADRs were seen which are expected to be 
observed in less than 1 in 100 patients (i.e. frequency categories of uncommon, rare, very rare, and 
frequency unknown). 
The Coombs seroconversion rate was lower than that seen in the adult program (14.0% in adults vs 3.7% in 
children) and is similar to that known for ceftazidime monotherapy, as presented in the FORTUM UK SmPC 
which is 5%, and the FORTAZ USPI which is 1 in 23. No evidence of haemolysis was seen in either paediatric 
study.

current SmPC ADR frequencies are based on the denominator N=2024 and refers only to adult subjects in 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies who received CAZ-AVI ± MTZ. One paediatric safety pool (“paediatric pool”) has 
been submitted to EMA, comprising the studies C3591004 and C3591005 (N=126). 
As the MAH pointed out, any differences between the paediatric and adult CAZ-AVI frequencies should be 
interpreted with caution given the limited numbers of paediatric patients. The presented rates are 
acceptable and are deemed to change after larger paediatric exposure to CAZ-AVI. As expected due to the 
low numbers of patients, none the ADRs listed as uncommon/rare for adults in the current SmPC were seen 
in the paediatric population in the two studies. 
Analysis of Adverse Events 
An overview of AEs observed in the cUTI study is given in Table 77 below. 
Table 77. Adverse events in any category (Safety Analysis Set) in study C3591005 
An overview of AEs observed in the cIAI study is given in Table 78 below. 
Table 78. Adverse events in any category (Safety Analysis Set) in study C3591004 
Pooled studies 
The incidence of AEs up to the last visit in the overall patient population was balanced between treatment 
groups: 53.1% and 56.0% in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ and comparator treatment groups, respectively (Table 
79). The incidence of AEs occurring up to the End of IV therapy was generally similar to those occurring up 
to the last visit. 
In contrast to the observed adult data, the incidence of AEs in paediatric patients was similar in patients with 
cIAI and cUTI. On analysis, the paediatric population which has cUTI tended to be more sick at baseline and 
have more significant comorbidities such as congenital abnormalities or renal or cardiac disease, compared 
with the adults, and this was assessed to be the reason for the observed difference.

The CHMP noted that the frequency of AEs up to the last visit in the overall patient population was similar 
between pooled treatment arms (53.1% in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ vs. 56.0% in comparator treatment groups, 
respectively). There are some differences observed, the most obvious of which was a higher frequency of 
SAEs in disfavour of the pooled CAZ-AVI group.  
Three (3) patients had AEs that led to discontinuation in the CAZ-AVI arm in the cUTI study (See below 
under the section concerning discontinuation due to AEs), none in the comparator arm. No patient 
discontinued due to AEs in the cIAI study. There were no deaths in either study.  
Common Adverse Events 
The most frequently reported system organ class (SOC) for the CAZ-AVI treatment group, for the overall 
paediatric population, was Infections and infestations (23.4% [30 patients]. A summary of the incidence of 
AEs by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term (PT) reported up to the last visit 
in ≥3 patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group is presented in Table 80. 
The most frequently reported (≥4%) AEs by PT for the CAZ-AVI treatment group, for the overall paediatric 
population, were Vomiting (8.6% [11 patients]) and Diarrhoea (4.7% [6 patients]), both of which are known 
common ADRs included in Section 4.8 of the EU-SmPC approved in adults.

The CHMP noted that the most frequently reported SOC for the CAZ-AVI treatment group, for the overall 
paediatric population, was Infections and infestations (23.4%). The most frequently reported (≥4%) AEs by 
PT for the CAZ-AVI treatment group for the overall paediatric population, were Vomiting (8.6%) and 
Diarrhoea (4.7%), both of which are known common ADRs from Zavicefta /ceftazidime-avibactam/CAZ-AVI 
in adults. When including PTs reported up to the last visit in ≥3 patients, infusion site phlebitis (4 pts), 
seroma (3 pts), UTI (5 pts), rash (3 pts), rhinitis (4 pts), upper respiratory tract infection (3 pts) are AEs 
reported in addition to vomiting (11 pts) and diarrhoea (6 pts) in the CAZ-AVI group. These are reactions, 
except for seroma, that are previously observed in adults and hence, are not unexpected. No new signal is 
observed in the paediatric population in these studies. The AE of seroma is reported in 3 paediatric patients 
with cIAIs and might be related to surgical procedures. Seroma is apparently not related to study drug. 
A great proportion (54% in the CAZ-AVI and cefepime treatment arms, respectively, in the UTI study, and 
approx. 86% in both treatment groups in the cIAI study) received other systemic antibiotics reported either 
before or concomitantly with the CAZ-AVI treatment. To what degree concomitant treatment contributed to 
the AEs reported is uncertain and was not discussed by the MAH, but does not seem to have impacted in a 
detrimental way when looking at the treatment-related AE reported, which is reassuring. 
Frequency of AEs according to severity 
The majority of AEs reported in both studies were mild in intensity (Table 81). The incidence of AEs by 
maximum reported intensity, for PTs of severe intensity is summarised in Table 82. On review of the data, 
the AEs with severe intensity tended to be those expected to occur in patients with severe infections and 
therefore reflect the underlying infection or associated surgery.

The CHMP noted that in the CAZ-AVI±MTZ group there were 9 and 10 patients experiencing moderate and 
severe AEs, respectively, in total 14.8% (19/128). Based on the numbers in the table above, there is mostly 
one case per preferred term, and it is not possible to observe any trend in severity of AEs. Overall, the 
incidence of any severity AEs was similar in the study and comparator drugs, however, there were cases of 
study drug discontinuation due to AEs, and that was not the case for the comparators. Otherwise, the AEs 
incidence seems to be balanced between the compared groups. 
The patient who experienced AE in the SOC Nervous system disorder is described in the subheading “Serious

Frequency of study drug related AEs 
Overall, most AEs were assessed as not related to the study drug. The AEs assessed as related to study drug 
are presented by PT in Table 83. The majority of related AEs are known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
included in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and SmPC approved in adults or are expected due to the 
underlying disease. The AE of Nervous system disorder was considered by the Blinded Observer to be related 
due to the temporal relationship to the infusion, however the patient had a history of similar episodes before 
the study drug was started and the event had a plausible alternative explanation.

The CHMP noted that there were few (8 pts) of the observed AEs which are deemed related to study drug 
(6.3%) by blinded observer. It is agreed that all of the related AEs, except for term Nervous system disorder, 
are known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) included in the SmPC approved in adults. The numbers of AEs 
related to study drug are acknowledged to be similar in the study and the comparator group. No new safety 
concerns are detected in the paediatric population.

Adverse events of special interest (AEoSI) 
The incidence of AEoSI representing 5 topics of special interest 
- 
liver disorders, diarrhoea, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis, haematological disorders, and renal 
disorders were programmatically assessed based on pre-defined AE PTs (MedDRA Version 20.0).  
The incidence of AEoSI PTs for each of the 5 categories up to Last Visit for the Safety Analysis Set, is 
presented in Table 84. One patient had ALT and AST rises which were not accompanied by a bilirubin rise. No 
new safety findings were identified on review of these events and the majority of AEs in the AEoSI topics 
were known ADRs. Hepatotoxicity, and risk of neurological sequelae when the dose is not appropriately 
reduced in patients with renal impairment are important potential risks.

4.2.2.8.10 
The CHMP noted that AEoSI for CAZ-AVI are predefined to be liver disorders, diarrhoea, 
hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis, haematological disorders, and renal disorders. The AEoSI that are observed in 
the studies, are shown in the table above. In this table, the actual number of patients with events are lacking 
from the columns for each treatment arm. These numbers are, however, given in the individual overview 
tables from each of the two studies in cUTI and cIAI, see Table 77 and Table 78 (from the CSR).  
The AEoSI for CAZ-AVI were defined based upon warnings and precautions wording for ceftazidime 
monotherapy in the Fortum UK SmPC, and later the same text was included in the CAZ-AVI SmPC. No 
clinically relevant differences were identified when the pooled paediatric safety data was assessed, or in the 
individual studies, and therefore no change to the current SmPC text is considered necessary, the Applicant 
claims.  
The AEoSI called “renal disorders” was not defined using the MedDRA SOC “Renal and urinary disorder” that 
is represented in the text stated in the SmPC. The AEoSI “renal disorders” is rather defined in the paediatric 
pooled safety dataset using the MedDRA v20.0 Acute renal failure broad Standard Medical Query (SMQ). No 
MedDRA PTs that are included in this SMQ were reported as AEs in the pooled paediatric safety dataset. This 
is the explanation for the discrepancies observed and asked about in this application. Reported events with 
terms nephrolithiasis, renal colic and urethral meatus stenosis are not included in the SMQ used by the MAH 
and therefore not reflected as renal disorders in Table 83 even though they are terms belonging to SOC 
Renal and urinary disorder. However, there were only single cases observed, and none of them were deemed 
related to CAZ-AVI treatment, which makes the concern less worrisome. The CHMP did not consider 
inclusion of these reactions in the SmPC relevant.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

There were no deaths or AEs with a fatal outcome reported in either study; Studies C3591004 (cIAI) and

Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
SAEs were reported by 13 patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group (10.2%) and 3 patients in the 
comparator treatment group (6.0%). SAEs by SOC and PT up to Last Visit, for the Safety Analysis Set are 
presented in Table 85. The reported SAEs were in line with what would be expected for the underlying 
indications, surgical treatment and paediatric population. There were no new safety findings, according to 
the MAH.  
One SAE, reported in Study C3591005 in the CAZ-AVI group, was judged to be related to study treatment by 
the Blinded Observer:  
One patient (Cohort 1; CAZ-AVI), a 16 year old female, experienced severe Nervous system disorder 
(verbatim term: neurologic disorder on the lower leg extremity), which was considered a medically 
important event and occurred 2 days after the start of the IV study drug. The patient’s ongoing medical 
history included anxiety, depression and hypertension secondary to polycystic kidney disease and it was 
reported that she had experienced the same symptoms prior to enrolment in the study, which provides a 
plausible alternative explanation. The Blinded Observer stated that causality of this case is considered to be 
possibly related to study drug based on implied temporal relationship. Concomitant medications and 
treatments received during the SAE were sertraline, ramipril, vitamins with minerals, and amlodipine. The 
event was considered resolved on Day 3. The SAE led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment.

SAEs were reported by 13 patients in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ treatment group (10.2%) and 3 patients in the 
comparator treatment group (6.0%). One SAE (Nerveous system disorder), reported in Study C3591005 
(cUTI) in the CAZ-AVI group, was judged to be possibly related to study treatment by the Blinded Observer, 
and also led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment and is described above. The two other cases 
were deemed not related to treatment (see below). 
More specifically, when looking into the study documentation, the reported numbers of SAEs for the 
separate studies are: 
cIAI study: There were 6 SAEs in total with 5 in the CAZ-AVI + metronidazole group and 1 in the 
meropenem group, of which none led to discontinuation of study drug. The SAE experienced in the 
meropenem arm was ileus. The patients in the CAZ-AVI + metronidazole group experienced events 
classified into several SOCs [Gastrointestinal disorder (2 pts), Renal and urinary disorders (2 patients), and 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (1 patient)]. None of these cases was deemed related to 
treatment, which was agreed by the Committee. 
cUTI study: There were 10 SAEs in total in this study, with 8 in the CAZ-AVI group and 2 in the cefepime 
group. The 2 patients in the cefepime group had SAEs of cystitis and pyelonephritis. Among the patients in 
the CAZ-AVI group, 1 patient experienced SAE within the SOC Gastrointestinal disorder and 1 patient within 
Nervous system disorder, which both led to discontinuation. The majority (6 pts), however, experienced 
SAEs within the SOC Infections and infestations, and which were cases of UTI and pyelonephritis following 
the study, which may represent either treatment failures or new infections, rather than AEs. As described 
above, the SAE in the Nervous system disorder, was the only one case deemed (to be) possibly related to 
treatment with CAZ-AVI by the blinded observer. However, as the symptoms also seem to be consistent with 
pre-existing complaints that the patient had before prior to enrolment in the study, it seems less likely to be 
caused by the study drug, even though CAZ-AVI cannot be ruled out.  
The CHMP agreed that the reported SAEs were in line with what would be expected based on known safety 
profile for CAZ-AVI in adults, and that there were no new safety findings specifically identified for the 
paediatric population.

The MAH concluded:  
•  No clinically significant shifts in serum electrolytes were seen. 
• 
The C-reactive protein and white cells fell from a raised mean at baseline, reflecting the patients’ 
bacterial infection, and this fall is interpreted as reflecting recovery from the infection. 
•  A general rise in platelet count was seen and this was interpreted as thrombocytosis caused by 
bacterial infection, which is well recognised in children. 
o  3 patients met PCS criteria for platelets, 2 were on CAZ-AVI + MTZ, and one was on 
CAZ-AVI. Both patients with cIAI had intra-abdominal abscesses and one had a cannula

infection. The patient with cUTI did not have any AEs. No AEs related to thromboembolic 
events were reported by any patient. 
The CHMP considered that there were no unexpected observations reported in the clinical laboratory data. 
- Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
For the purposes of this Summary of Clinical Safety, ECG, vital sign and physical examination data for the 2 
studies have not been pooled. 
Changes in vital signs from baseline to those recorded at end of IV treatment, end of treatment, test of cure 
and late follow-up, were generally small and clinically insignificant. There was a trend for temperature to 
decrease, which is consistent with patients recovering from infection. 
Infrequently, clinically significant vital sign abnormalities were observed. These findings were assessed and 
considered consistent with variations expected for this study population and not suggestive of an effect by 
CAZ-AVI. 
The majority of patients had QTcB and QTcF values ≤500 ms. There were no ECG abnormalities that were 
deemed clinically significant. 
There were 15 cases of sinus tachycardia in Study C3591004, 4 of which were judged by the investigator to 
be clinically significant. All 4 of these patients were from the same site (Site 5120) and had tachycardia at 
baseline that was also judged to be clinically significant. One patient in Study C3591005 had tachycardia on 
Days 1 and 2 and deemed clinically significant by the investigator and resulted in permanent discontinuation 
of CAZ-AVI. 
The CHMP noted that the majority of patients had normal physical examination results at each study visit. 
Only infrequently were clinically significant vital sign abnormalities observed. These were, however, 
explainable and did not indicate an effect by CAZ-AVI.  
The MAH stated that the majority of patients had QTcB and QTcF values ≤500 ms, which is not unexpected. 
The MAH claimed that there were no ECG abnormalities deemed clinically significant. No patients taking 
CAZ-AVI in the paediatric studies C3591004 and C3591005 had post baseline QT values >450msec, which 
is reassuring. Among the 15 cases of tachycardia in cIAI study, four cases were found to be clinically 
significant, but all of them had significant tachycardia at baseline. One patient who experienced tachycardia 
in the cUTI study, discontinued study.  
The CHMP agreed that no safety issues were identified in the category of vital signs, physical findings, and 
other observations related to safety in this section. 
Safety in special populations 
The purpose of this variation is to extend the use of Zavicefta in paediatric patients aged 3 months to < 18 
years for the treatment of cIAI and cUTI based on data from two phase 2 paediatric studies and the 
population PK modelling/simulation analyses, and hence, this section is only applicable for age 
categories/cohort, gender and by renal function. 
- Safety by Age Cohort 
The Age Cohorts in the studies were defined according to the definitions agreed with PIP.  
Overall, fewer patients were recruited into the lower age ranges. Each AE category was generally balanced 
between treatment groups. The incidence of AEs reported by adolescents is consistent with the adult 
Assessment report

frequency and they were more likely to report symptoms such as tinnitus or back pain than younger 
patients. There is a higher rate of SAEs in the paediatric cUTI population than the adult cUTI population; 
however, this reflects the difference in the complicated recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) study 
population compared with the adults who tended to be least sick at baseline of the three adult indication 
populations (cIAI, cUTI and hospital-acquired pneumonia). 
The frequency of AEs up to the last visit was generally similar across age cohorts and treatment groups. Any 
differences should be interpreted with caution given the limited numbers (Table 88). 
Data for the following age ranges were also reviewed: Infants and toddlers- 3 months to <2 years, Children- 
2 to <12 years, and Adolescents- 12 to <18 years. No clinical differences were observed.

groups (Table 89). Any differences should be interpreted with caution given the limited numbers of patients.

- Effect of Renal Function 
Analysis of the effect of renal function on the safety profile of CAZ-AVI in paediatric patients is not possible 
in this pooled population. Overall 25% subjects taking CAZ-AVI ± MTZ and 18 % comparator had mild renal 
insufficiency with creatinine clearance values ≥50 to <80 mL/min at baseline. One patient in each group had 
a creatinine clearance value <50 mL/min. One patient in each group had a baseline CrCl ≤50 ml/min and 
experienced an AE (Urinary tract infection with CAZ-AVI; Diarrhoea, Coombs test positive with comparator. 
The EU-RMP v2.0 currently includes pre-existing severe renal impairment including experience in 
haemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis and other renal replacement therapy as a missing information topic. The 
MAH proposes to add pre-existing moderate renal impairment in paediatric population as an additional 
missing information topic. The proposed labelling includes information on the administration and posology of 
CAZ-AVI in paediatric patients with renal impairment. 
With regards to age, the MAH claimed that there was no clinically meaningful differences identified in the 
individual indications. The frequency of AEs up to the last visit was generally similar across age cohorts and 
treatment groups. Of notice, no patients from cohort 4 (3 months – <2 years) with cIAIs were included in the 
study. 
The CHMP considered that there was in general a slightly higher frequency in AEs in female children vs. 
males (56.2% vs 49.1%), also for SAEs (12.3% vs. 5.3%) and AEs of severe intensity (11.0% vs. 3.6%), In 
addition all the 3 patients who discontinued study due to AEs were females. However, the number of events 
was limited, and in both categories (age cohorts and gender), any differences should be interpreted with 
caution.  
There was a high degree (25%) of patients treated with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ having mild renal impairment, but 
only a few, single patients with more declined renal functions were included. The Committee therefore 
acknowledged that analysis of the effect of moderate to severe renal dysfunction on the safety profile of 
CAZ-AVI in paediatric patients is not possible in this pooled population.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Three (3) (2.3%) patients in the CAZ-AVI ±MTZ group had AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment. AEs by SOC and PT up to End of IV, for the Safety Analysis Set are presented in Table 90.  
One patient, who experienced a SAE of nervous system disorder, is briefly discussed under Serious adverse 
events.  
On assessment of the measurements of heart rate by the sponsor, the patient who experienced tachycardia 
did not have clinically significant tachycardia and this was assessed to not be a new safety finding. 
The patient who discontinued due to nausea and vomiting was a 17 year old female with an existing benign 
adrenal mass, chronic constipation and nausea requiring Ondansetron, who was also taking intravenous 
morphine for pain control of her cUTI (acute pyelonephritis), which may offer a plausible explanation for her 
symptoms requiring discontinuation.

The CHMP noted that, in the pooled population, three (2.3%) patients in the CAZ-AVI ±MTZ group had AEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment, all of which were experienced in CAZ-AVI arm in 
the cUTI study. There were no discontinuations due to AEs in the comparator (cefepime) arm. One 
discontinuation were due to a SAE - (Nervous system disorder), previously described and deemed possibly 
related to treatment and discussed under the subheading Serious adverse events. One patient had a SAE in 
the Gastrointestinal disorder SOC, - moderate dizziness, nausea and vomiting - and one patient experienced 
tachycardia, which were deemed no to be clinically significant, and therefore no new safety finding. Both 
permanently discontinued study drug.  
There were no discontinuations of study drug due to AEs reported in the cIAI study.  
No specific pattern of reasons for discontinuation can be seen, but the number of patients is too low to 
conclude much about AEs causing discontinuation.

Post marketing experience 
As of 24 February 2019, 83 events in 57 post marketing cases (15.8% of all 360 cases received) involved 
paediatric patients, including 5 patients treated in the compassionate use Global Access Program (GAP). 
Figure 17. Pie Chart Summary of Post-Marketing Cases involving Paediatric Patients 
Fifty-two cases describe off label use in paediatric patients. Of these, 47 events in 41 cases describe off label 
use without associated adverse events: Off label use [10 events], Product administered to patient of 
inappropriate age [3], Product use issue [33] and Product use in unapproved indication (use in patients with 
cystic fibrosis) [2]. 
The remaining 11 off label use cases, included 14 associated events: in 2 cases, off label use was reported 
with a medication error (Incorrect product administration duration [1], Product label issue [1]; 
In 9 cases, off label use was reported with the following 12 associated AEs: Alanine aminotransferase 
increased [1], Anaemia [1], Enterobacter infection [1], Hepatitis [1], Pathogen resistance [1], Septic shock 
[1], Platelet count decreased [2] and Hypernatraemia [4]. 
The remaining 7 cases did not report off-label use terms and the events described were Dug resistance [2], 
Intracranial pressure increased [1], Pneumonia [1], Drug ineffective [1] and Multiple-drug resistance [1]. 
There was one case of premature birth following maternal exposure during pregnancy. 
With the exception of one event of anaemia, the AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities were reported 
from one unit, and were assessed to be associated with the patients’ underlying medical conditions. 
One paediatric case included an AE of hepatitis. A 4-year-old patient received CAZ-AVI for Klebsiella 
pneumoniae infection. The patient’s medical history included neuroblastoma, bone marrow transplantation 
and graft versus host disease. Concomitant medications included meropenem trihydrate and tigecycline. 
According to the reporting physician, there was no causal relationship between hepatitis and CAZ-AVI and 
the event was more likely caused by the patient's general condition. The patient’s underlying pneumonia, 
carcinoma and graft versus host disease offer a plausible alternative explanation for the reported event and 
this case does not provide any evidence of a possible causal association between CAZ-AVI administration 
and hepatitis. 
The CHMP considered that no new safety issues have been identified in the paediatric population from post 
marketing surveillance. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This  application  was  submitted  to  extend  the  indication  of  Ceftazidime-avibactam  (CAZ-AVI)  to  include 
paediatric patients (3 months to <18 years old) with cIAIs and cUTIs. This safety assessment is based on 
two phase 2 single-blind, randomized, multicenter active-controlled studies of pediatric patients aged ≥3 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 154/167 
 
 
  
  
 
months to 18 years with either cIAI or cUTI, the studies are denoted C3591004 and C3591005. In addition, 
the MAH presented the data for global usage and paediatric patients who received the drug off-label. 
According  to  Draft  guideline  EMA/187859/2017  “Addendum  to  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal 
products  indicated  for  treatment  of  bacterial  infections  to  address  paediatric-specific  clinical  data 
requirements”,  no  appropriately  powered  efficacy  studies  are  requested  in  the  paediatric  population  as 
efficacy  can  be  extrapolated  from  adults  provided  that  similar  exposure  is  achieved  in  the  paediatric 
population. Furthermore, sufficient safety data have to be generated with the intended dose regimen in the 
paediatric population. In both the paediatric studies submitted to support the indication extensions, safety 
and tolerability are primary endpoint, while pharmacokinetic and efficacy variables are secondary. 
Of the 178 patients who were randomised to receive CAZ-AVI ± MTZ or comparator across the 2 paediatric 
studies, 128 were treated in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ group and 50 were treated in the comparator group. They 
were  stratified  into  four  age  cohorts:  12-18  years,  6-<12  years,  2-<6  years,  and  3  months-<2  years 
(further divided into 1-<2 years and 3 months-<1 year).The differences in recruitment in each age group 
between  the  two  studies  is  not  considered  of  great  importance  for  the  safety  assessment,  but  the  total 
number  of  patients  <2  years  treated  with  CAZ-AVI  is  only  26,  which  brings  uncertainty  to  the  safety 
assessment of this cohort. Even though there were no patients age 2 years or less in the cIAI study, the total 
numbers of patients in different cohorts were balanced. In the total overview, the numbers of infants and 
toddlers in the CAZ-AVI±MTZ group, compared to total comparators, were well balanced. 
Since the dose regimen of CAZ-AVI is the same in each age category in the two studies, it is considered 
acceptable to pool the safety data from two studies even though there is different indications and different 
comparators used in the two studies. It should, however, be noted that the median exposure to IV study 
drug  was  quite  different  in  the  two  studies;  median  exposure  was  7  (2-13)  days  for  the  CAZ-AVI  plus 
metronidazole group in the cIAI study versus 4 (1-11) days for the CAZ-AVI group in the cUTI study.  
For the pooled data, however, the median duration of exposure to IV study drug was 5 (1 to 13) days for the 
CAZ-AVI ± MTZ group and 6 (2 to 13) days for the comparator group. With reference to studies in adults 
assessed in the MA Application, a greater proportion of adults received the recommended duration of IV 
CAZ-AVI treatment compared to children; this likely reflects the earlier switch to oral therapy seen in the 
paediatric  studies.  While  the  safety  profile  is  consequently  based  on  a  shorter  duration  of  therapy  than 
adults, this may as well reflect clinical practice in the paediatric population, but however, also represent an 
uncertainty to and hampers the safety evaluation. The median duration of treatment is however within the 
range of recommended duration of treatment that is proposed in the product information (5-14 days) and is 
considered relevant for the safety assessment. 
In the cUTI and cIAI study, a great proportion (37 and 86%, respectively) of the paediatric patients in the 
CAZ-AVI arm received other systemic antibiotics reported either before or concomitantly with the CAZ-AVI. 
This co-medication use will possibly impact the evaluation of CAZ-AVI treatment, both regarding efficacy 
and safety, in the children. 
- Adverse events 
The frequency of AEs up to the last visit in the overall patient population was similar between the treatment 
groups: 68 patients (53.1%) and 28 patients (56.0%) in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ and comparator treatment 
groups, respectively. Numerically, the overall rate of any AEs was higher in the comparator group. But there 
were more AEs leading to treatment discontinuation the CAZ-AVI±MTZ patients, however, the number is low 
(3 patients, 2.3%). The majority of AEs were up to moderate severity. More severe AEs were registered in 
the CAZ-AVI±MTZ group. The driver here was the “Infections and infestations”, commonly reported in the 
cUTI study. 
The most frequently reported SOC for the CAZ-AVI treatment group, for the overall paediatric population, 
was Infections and infestations (23.4%). The most frequently reported (≥4%) AEs by PT for the CAZ-AVI 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020

treatment group for the overall paediatric population were vomiting (8.6%) and diarrhoea (4.7%), both of 
which are known common ADRs from ceftazidime-avibactam in adults. When including PTs reported up to 
the last visit in ≥3 patients, infusion site phlebitis (4 pts), seroma (3 pts), UTI (5 pts), rash (3 pts), rhinitis 
(4  pts),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (3  pts)  are  AEs  reported  in  addition  to  vomiting  (11  pts)  and 
diarrhoea (6 pts) in the CAZ-AVI group.  
There are few (8 pts) of the observed AEs which are deemed related to study drug (8 pts, 6.3%) by blinded 
observer. It is agreed that the all of the related AEs, except for term Nervous system disorder, are known 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) included in the SmPC approved in adults. 
- Adverse events of special interest 
The  AEoSI  for  CAZ-AVI  are  predefined  to  be  liver  disorders,  diarrhoea,  hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis, 
haematological  disorders,  and  renal  disorders.  Up  to  6.3%  of  patients  in  the  CAZ-AVI±MTZ  group 
experienced the hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis related AESI, however, this rate was higher in the comparator 
group. Some AEoSI (PTs within liver disorders, diarrhoea, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis) are observed in the 
studies. 
- Deaths and serious adverse events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in either study. 
Serious adverse events: 
SAEs were reported by 13 patients in the CAZAVI ± MTZ treatment group (10.2%) and 3 patients in the 
comparator treatment group (6.0%). One SAE (Nervous system disorder) reported in Study C3591005 in 
the CAZ-AVI group, was judged possibly related to study treatment and led to permanent discontinuation.  
- Discontinuation 
Three (2.3%) patients in the CAZ-AVI ±MTZ group had AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment, all in CAZ-AVI arm of cUTI study (nervous system disorder, tachycardia, and dizziness, nausea 
and vomiting).  
- Laboratory findings, vital signs, physical findings 
As of laboratory finding, there was increase in the numbers of platelets, but no thrombotic events were 
reported, the said increase is common in children with infections, however, such increase was not observed 
in the comparator group. The positive Coombs test was more prevalent in the comparator group, and no 
haemolytic  anaemias  were  registered.  There  are  no  unexpected  observations  reported  in  the  clinical 
laboratory evaluations, vital signs or physical findings.  
- Special patient groups 
The rate of ADRs was compared to the rate in adult population. Using this comparison, no new safety issues 
were  recognised.  The  presented  rates  are  acceptable,  but  are  deemed  to  change  after  larger  paediatric 
exposure to CAZ-AVI.  
Age and gender did not appear to be associated with a safety profile different from that already known, but 
there  is  a  trend  towards  higher  frequencies  of  (S)AEs  in  the  females  versus  females,  and  all  the  three 
patients who discontinued were females.  
Lack of inclusion in age group in the cIAI study  
No children in the ages 3 months < 2 years was included in the cIAI study C3591004. Evaluation of the 
present data did not identify any differences in the safety profile of clinical significance between Zavicefta in 
Assessment report

children 3 months to <18 years (evaluation of pooled safety data from paediatric studies in cUTI and cIAI) 
and what is known for the safety profile of Zavicefta from adult studies. However, there is an uncertainty 
regarding safety data for cIAI, including serious infections, as data in the population age 3 months to <2 
years is lacking. 
Lack of inclusion of children with moderate/severe renal impairment 
No safety concerns regarding decreasing renal function were reported in these studies, however studies 
included patients with relatively good kidney function. There was a high degree (25%) of patients treated 
with CAZ-AVI ± MTZ having mild renal impairment, but single patients with more declined renal functions.  
- Post-marketing experience:  
As of 24th February 2019, 83 events in 57 post marketing cases (15.8% of all 360 cases received) involved 
paediatric patients, including 5 patients treated in the compassionate use Global Access Program (GAP).  
Taking into account the post-marketing off-label use data, no clear trends are observed and no new safety 
issues have been identified in the paediatric population.

See above. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety analysis of the pooled phase 2 paediatric studies comprising 128 paediatric patients (aged 3 months 
to <18 years) exposed to intravenous ceftazidime-avibactam has been conducted. All randomised patients 
who  received  any  amount  of  IV  study  therapy  (CAZ-AVI±MTZ)  were  included.  About  half  (68  patients, 
53.1%) of the patients treated with CAZ-AVI±MTZ experienced AEs, however, only 8 AEs were considered 
treatment-related. 
The  overall  safety  profile  in  paediatric  patients  seems  to  be  in  line  with  the  expected  safety  profile  for 
CAZ-AVI in adults, and no new safety issues have been identified in the two studies performed. However, the 
data on safety is limited based on the small number of patients included. In particular is safety in patients <2 
years  of  age  including  serious  cases  of  cIAI  is  limited.  Safety  in  children  with  moderate/severe  renal 
impairment is missing, and currently, no dose recommendations in the severe group are proposed.  
It is concluded that the data provide overall clinical evidence that CAZ-AVI has an acceptable safety profile 
for use in paediatric patients aged 3 months to <18 years of age with cUTI and cIAI.

2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this extension of indications, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.3 and 6.6 of the 
SmPC are being updated to reflect the additional population, the paediatric posology, paediatric safety 
information, the description of the clinical trials and handling instructions for paediatric dosing.  
Due to the complex handling instructions, and particularly inconvenient concentrations/reconstitution 
volumes for calculation of individual paediatric doses, as a result of the assessment, a warning was included 
in the section 4.4 of the SmPC (under the subheading “Paediatric population”) to highlight that for the 
youngest children (from 3 months to less than 12 months of age) there is a potential risk of overdosing which 
is related to the difficulties to calculate the volume of administration of the dose, with a cross-reference to 
the section 4.9. 
In Section 6.6 of the SmPC a paediatric-specific wording for the youngest population (from 3 months to less 
than 12 months of age) was also included, together with tabulated dosing volumes calculated based on 
different weights. The tabulated instructions are presented separately for paediatric patients with normal 
renal function as well as for those with mild or moderate renal impairment. Although these instructions are 
not inclusive of all possible calculated doses, they include a broad range of the doses to be expected, and 
provide clear and detailed information to the user on how to calculate doses and prepare the infusions. 
The Package Leaflet was updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to correct the sodium content to SmPC sections 2 and 4.4 and PL 
section 2 and the volumes of distribution of ceftazidime and avibactam in SmPC section 5.2. 
For full details of the PI changes, please refer to Attachment 1. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require 
user consultation with target patient groups.

patients from the age of 3 months to <18 years with the following infectious diseases: 
-  Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 160/167 
 
 
  
  
 
-  Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) 
The CHMP, during this variation suggested that the scope of the application would be extended to include 
treatment of paediatric patients from the age of 3 months to <18 years with the following other approved 
indications for Zavicefta:  
-  Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP)  
- 
Treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adults, infants (aged 3 months 
and older), children and adolescents patients with limited treatment options  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
cIAI - available therapies 
According to IDSA guideline 2017, selection of specific antimicrobial therapy for paediatric patients with cIAI 
should be based on considerations of the origin of infection (community vs health care), severity of illness, 
and safety of the antimicrobial agents in specific paediatric age groups. 
Acceptable  broad-spectrum  antimicrobial  regimens  for  paediatric  patients  with  cIAI  include  an 
aminoglycoside-based 
regimen,  a 
carbapenem 
(imipenem,  meropenem,  or  ertapenem),  a 
β-lactam/β-lactamase-inhibitor  combination  (piperacillin-tazobactam  or  ticarcillin-clavulanate),  or  an 
advanced-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or cefepime) with metronidazole. 
cUTI - available therapies 
The EAU/ESPU guidelines 2015 for UTI in children recommend therapy with an antimicrobial regimen for 
paediatric  cUTI  patients,  such  as  an  aminoglycoside  with  or  without  amoxicillin,  or  a  second  or  third 
generation cephalosporin, or an extended-spectrum penicillin with or without an aminoglycoside. The most 
frequently  used  agents  for  treatment  of  paediatric  UTI  are  parenteral  cephalosporins  (e.g.  cefotaxime, 
ceftazidime and ceftriaxone) or oral cephalosporins (such as cefexime and cefuroxime axetil), trimethoprim 
and  trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole,  ampicillin,  amoxicillin,  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid,  piperacillin, 
aminoglycosides (i.e. tobramycin and gentamycin), ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin. The dosing regimen 
selected should be based on local resistance data and urine culture results. 
HAP/VAP 
Hospital acquired pneumonia, including VAP is a severe disease, and can be a life-threatening condition. The 
mortality risk increases when these infections are caused by MDR bacteria and in patients with concurrent 
bacteraemia. The mortality rate attributable to HAP/VAP ranges from 33% to 50%. 
Due to the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, few antibiotic agents are broadly active against the 
gram-negative  organisms 
frequently 
isolated 
from  NP 
infections.  The  WHO  (2017) 
identified 
carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa as a critical threat with an urgent need of new antibiotics. Recent data 
show an increase in the prevalence of NP caused by MDR pathogens, most commonly P. aeruginosa, with 
documented  resistance  to  β-lactams,  carbapenems,  aminoglycosides,  and  fluoroquinolones.  Although 
increasing drug resistance has diminished the utility of established antipseudomonal β-lactam antibiotics, 
there  are  still  some  antibacterial  agents  that  are  effective  in  treatment  of  HAP/VAP  patients.  However, 
considering  the  high  prevalence  and  severity  of  these  infections,  as  well  as  increasing  prevalence  of 
antibiotic-resistant  bacteria,  effective  treatment  options  are  still  needed.  Particularly,  there  is  an  unmet 
medical need for treatment of patients infected with certain pathogens such as MDR-resistant P. aeruginosa. 
Unmet medical need 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020

Infections due to resistant Gram-negative bacteria are increasingly common in paediatric patients. Few 
antibiotics with activity against ESBL and carbapenemase producing Gram-negative bacteria are currently 
available. Furthermore, only a few antibacterial agents have had their safety and efficacy carefully evaluated 
in paediatric patients. Hence, there is an undisputable medical need for further treatment options for the 
paediatric patient population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
D4280C00015 (C3591004) - cIAI 
Clinical  phase  2  study 
to  evaluate  Safety, 
tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  and  efficacy  of 
ceftazidime-avibactam  when  given  in  combination  with  metronidazole,  compared  with  meropenem,  in 
children from 3 months to less than 18 years of age with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs). Of 
the 86 enrolled patients, 83 were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive CAZ-AVI + MTZ or meropenem and all 
of these patients received treatment (61 were treated in the CAZ-AVI + MTZ group and 22 were treated in 
the  meropenem  group).  The  paediatric  age  groups  who  received  CAZ-AVI  plus  metronidazole  were  as 
follows: 12 to <18 years, (n=22), 6 to < 12 years, (n=33), 3 to < 6 years (n=6). No patients less than 2 
years of age received CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole. 
D4280C00016 (C3591005) - cUTI 
Clinical phase 2 study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of CAZ-AVI compared to 
CEF in children from 3 months to less than 18 years of age with cUTIs. Of the 101 enrolled patients, 97 were 
randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive CAZ-AVI or CEF and 95 received treatment (67 were treated in the 
CAZ-AVI group and 28 were treated in the CEF group). The paediatric age groups who received CAZ-AVI 
were as follows: 12 to <18 years (n=13), 6 to < 12 years (n=17), 3 to < 6 years (n=11), and from the age 
of 3 months to <2 years (n=27). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
An  updated  popPK  analysis  (CAZ-MS-PED-02)  was  conducted  to  assess  the  PK  of  CAZ-AVI  in  paediatric 
patients and to support the proposed paediatric dose recommendations as well as to support the PK bridging 
for extrapolation of efficacy and safety. In the updated popPK model, the paediatric PK data from phase II 
studies (C3591004 and C3591005) and Study D4280C00014 were pooled with PK data from adults (phase 
I to phase III). At the proposed dose regimens, individual model-predicted Cmax and AUCss,0-24 values for 
both CAZ and AVI in cIAI and cUTI paediatric patients were generally similar to the corresponding adult 
population, with geometric mean values from most study cohorts deviating from adults by ±15%.  
Simulated paediatric exposures for all age groups (1000 subjects per age group, for indications cIAI, cUTI 
and HAP/VAP, and renal impairment group) for CAZ and AVI were overall comparable to the corresponding 
adult exposures. 
The PTA simulations, using the joint PKPD target, demonstrated PTA achievement of >90% at the proposed 
dose regimens for almost all paediatric subgroups (including renal impairment groups) with cIAI, cUTI and 
HAP/VAP.  
Efficacy measures were defined as secondary endpoints in the phase II studies and evaluation of efficacy 
was based on descriptive statistics. 
cIAI indication 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 162/167 
 
 
  
  
 
Clinical  cure  rates  were  91.8%  (56/61)  in  the  CAZ-AVI  plus  metronidazole  treatment  arm  and  95.5% 
(21/22) in the meropenem arm in the ITT population at TOC. In the CE population, the cure rates were 
92.9% (52/56) in the CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole treatment arm and 95.0% (19/20) in the meropenem at 
TOC. 
cUTI indication 
The microbiological response rates were 79.6% (43/54) in the CAZ-AVI group and 60.9% (14/23) in the CEF 
group in the micro-ITT population at TOC. The combined response in the micro-ITT population were 72.2% 
(39/54) in the CAZ-AVI group and 60.9% (14/23) in the CEF group at TOC. 
The clinical success rates were 88.9% (48/54) in the CAZ-AVI treatment group and 82.6% (19/23) in the 
CEF group in the micro-ITT population at TOC. In the ME population, the cure rates were 92.7% (38/41) in 
the CAZ-AVI group and 87.5% (14/16) in the CEF group at TOC. 
The eradication rates of infections due to E.coli in the micro-ITT analysis set at the TOC visit were 79.6% 
(39/49) in the CAZ-AVI group and 59.1% (13/22) in the CEF group, and 86.5% (32/37) and 66.7% (10/15), 
respectively, in the ME analysis set. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No  exposure  data  from  paediatric  patients  with  HAP/VAP  are  available  at  present.  A  PK  study  on  NP, 
HAP/VAP (for children >3 months old to 18 years of age) requested by PDCO as part of the PIP is ongoing. 
The assessment of this indication is thus based on extrapolation without a supportive PK bridge.  
Limited PK data from cIAI patients <6 years and from paediatric patients <2 years were included in the 
popPK dataset on which the exposure and PTA predictions were based. 
Although total exposure (AUC) appeared to be comparable, the predicted exposures for both CAZ and AVI 
showed higher peak (Cmax) and lower trough (Cmin) values in the paediatric population compared to the adult 
population, which could translate into a shorter time above MIC. Nevertheless, a PTA of >90% was achieved 
in almost all paediatric subgroups (including renal impairment subgroups), except from cIAI patients aged 1 
to <6 years of age who achieved a lower PTA of 82%. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events 
The  frequency  of  AEs  up  to  the  last  visit  in  the  overall  pooled  patient  population  (N=128)  was  similar 
between the treatment groups: 68 patients (53.1%) and 28 patients (56.0%) in the CAZ-AVI ± MTZ and 
comparator treatment groups, respectively. There are few of the observed AEs which are deemed related to 
study drug (8 pts, 6.3%) to CAZ-AVI±MTZ by blinded observer. Study drug related AEs were dizziness, 
nervous system disorder, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, dermatitis diaper, intertrigo and rash, all observed in 
one patient each with except for diarrhoea and vomiting with 2 patients each. All the related AEs, except for 
term Nervous system disorder, are known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) included in the SmPC approved in 
adults.  
The  AEoSI  for  CAZ-AVI  are  predefined  to  be  liver  disorders,  diarrhoea,  hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis, 
haematological disorders, and renal disorders. Clarification on the data presented is requested. 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in either study. 
Serious adverse events: 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 163/167 
 
 
  
  
SAEs were reported by 13 patients in the CAZAVI ± MTZ treatment group (10.2%) and 3 patients in the 
comparator treatment group (6.0%). One SAE (Nervous system disorder) reported in Study C3591005 in 
the CAZ-AVI group, was judged possibly related to study treatment and led to permanent discontinuation.  
Discontinuation: 
Three (2.3%) patients in the CAZ-AVI ±MTZ group had AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment, all in CAZ-AVI arm of cUTI study (i.e. due to nervous system disorder, tachycardia, and dizziness, 
nausea and vomiting). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
With reference to studies in adults assessed in the MA Application, a greater proportion of adults received the 
recommended duration of IV CAZ-AVI treatment compared to children, and this likely reflects the earlier 
switch to oral therapy seen in the paediatric studies. While the safety profile is consequently based on a 
shorter duration of therapy than adults, this may as well reflect clinical practice in the paediatric population. 
However, it also represents an uncertainty to (and hampers the) safety evaluation, especially as it is to be 
compared to the adult population.  
A great proportion (from 37 to 86%) of the paediatric patients is reported to have received other antibiotics 
either before or concomitantly with the CAZ-AVI treatment. The majority of these have received cefuroxime 
(for cUTI) or gentamicin (for cIAI). This co-medication use will hamper the evaluation of CAZ-AVI treatment 
in children and was not discussed by the MAH. 
As no children below the age of 2 years (i.e. >3 months and up to 2 years of age) is recruited into the 
paediatric cIAI study (C3591005) submitted in the present application, there is an uncertainty with respect 
to the risk of exposing the youngest children to CAZ-AVI. 
The handling instructions in the PI were complex, and particularly concentrations/reconstitution volumes 
were inconvenient (SmPC section 6.6). To highlight this risk and prevent the resulting potential significant 
risk of severe dosing errors for paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 12 months of age, a warning 
was recommended for inclusion in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Safety in children with moderate and severe renal impairment is lacking and the dosing recommendation is 
only based on simulations. 
Overall, the number of children included is low and can only contribute to detect common AEs. 
3.6.  Effects Table

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Assuming that similar PK exposure to adults should lead to similar response to ceftazidime and avibactam, 
a population PK modelling approach was employed to identify appropriate doses of CAZ and AVI to be used 
in  children  >3  months  to  18  years  of  age.  Therefore,  the  extension  of  the  proposed  indications  to  the 
paediatric patients depends on the adequacy of the proposed dose regimens in different age subgroups and 
renal impairment categories based on the comparability of PK to adults and whether the paediatric safety 
profile is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/543616/2020 
Page 164/167 
 
 
  
  
The comparability of PK in paediatric patients to adults was demonstrated, using popPK modelling and PTA 
simulations. It is reassuring that acceptable PTAs of >90% were achieved at the proposed dose regimens 
using the same joint PKPD target as that employed in the original MAA for adults. This was shown for almost 
all paediatric subgroups (including renal impairment groups) with cIAI, cUTI and HAP/VAP, except for cIAI 
patients aged 1 to <6 years. However, the slightly lower PTA is not considered to be of major concern due 
to the following: (i) the individual model-predicted PTA was supportive, (ii) the PDT against which PTA was 
estimated was 1-log kill (stasis might have sufficed for cIAI) and (iii) clinical outcomes of cIAI are strongly 
driven by adequate surgery. In addition, the proposed dose regimen for this age group is consistent with 
doses for other indications for CAZ-AVI. Of note, the proposed ceftazidime dose in the CAZ-AVI combination 
is consistent with CAZ alone, for which there is an extensive experience with the paediatric use.  
The  extrapolation  for  HAP/VAP  was  based  on  popPK/PTA  simulations,  using  adult  datasets  across  all  3 
site-specific indications (cIAI, cUTI, and HAP/VAP) and PK data from paediatric patients with cUTI and cIAI, 
including children with severe cUTI infections requiring IV treatment. This strategy is considered acceptable. 
In adult patients, the same CAZ-AVI dose regimen of 2/0.5 g q8h was found efficacious for treatment of all 
site-specific  infections  (cUTI,  cIAI  and  HAP/VAP).  There  were  no  significant  differences  in  the  plasma 
exposures for ceftazidime and avibactam between these patient populations. Considering also similarity of 
PK data for both components in paediatric patients with cIAI and cUTI, it is expected that ceftazidime and 
avibactam  plasma  exposures  will  also  be  similar  in  paediatric  patients  with  HAP/VAP.  Nonetheless,  it  is 
reassuring  that  the  adequacy  of  the  dose  regimen  and  PK  bridge  will  be  reassessed  when  the  HAP/VAP 
exposure data from the ongoing PIP trial in children >3 months to <18 years of age become available. 
As  stated  in  the  Zavicefta  SmPC  section  4.4,  the  use  of  ceftazidime/avibactam  for  treatment  of  aerobic 
Gram-negative  infections  in  adult  patients  with  limited  treatment  options  is  based  on  experience  with 
ceftazidime alone and on analyses of the PK-PD relationship for ceftazidime/avibactam. This holds true for 
paediatric patients. Considering the unmet medical need for further treatment options against infections due 
to resistant Gram-negative bacteria, the extrapolation of this indication to paediatric patients is supported. 
The overall safety profile in paediatric patients seems to be in line with the expected safety profile for 
CAZ-AVI in adults, and no new safety issues have been identified in the two studies performed. The safety 
in children 3 months to <2 years of age with cIAI and in children with moderate and severe renal impairment 
could not be evaluated because there were none or only few patients included in the two paediatric studies. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The totality of the data and the consideration that ceftazidime is already approved for use in children, with 
dosing recommendations down to birth, allows for concluding that the proposed dosing recommendations 
are adequate for both ceftazidime and avibactam and that the exposures are sufficiently similar to allow 
extrapolation  of  safety  and  efficacy  for  cIAI,  cUTI  and  HAP/VAP  as  well  as  in  aerobic  Gram-negative 
infections in paediatric patients with limited treatment options from adults.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
There was a potential risk of overdosing for the youngest children from 3 months to less than 12 months of 
age, related to the difficulties to calculate the volume of administration of the dose. Therefore, a warning 
was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to highlight this risk, with a cross-reference to section 4.9. In 
addition, a table with dosing volumes calculated based on different weights was added to section 6.6. 
Although these instructions are not inclusive of all possible calculated doses, they include a broad range of 
the doses to be expected, and provide clear and detailed information to the user on how to calculate doses 
and prepare the infusions.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of CAZ-AVI (Zavicefta) is positive for the extension of indication to broaden the current 
indications to include treatment of paediatric patients with cIAI, cUTI, HAP/VAP and aerobic Gram-negative 
infections in patients with limited treatment options from the age of 3 months to less than 18 years.

Extension of indication to include paediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 18 years for Zavicefta (for 
the treatment of cIAI and cUTI, HAP/VAP and aerobic Gram-negative infections in patients with limited 
treatment options), based on data from paediatric studies D4280C00014, C3591004 and C3591005 and the 
population PK modelling/simulation analyses (CAZ-MS-PED-01 and CAZ-MS-PED-02). As a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated in order to reflect this additional 
population, the paediatric posology, paediatric safety information, the description of the clinical trials and 
handling instructions for paediatric dosing. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
A warning was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC, with a cross-reference to section 4.9, to highlight a 
potential risk of overdosing for the youngest children from 3 months to less than 12 months of age, related 
to the difficulties to calculate the volume of administration of the dose. In addition, a table with dosing 
volumes calculated based on different weights was added to section 6.6. 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to correct the sodium content to SmPC 
sections 2 and 4.4 and PL section 2 and the volumes of distribution of ceftazidime and avibactam in SmPC 
section 5.2.  
The RMP version 3.2 has been approved with this variation. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

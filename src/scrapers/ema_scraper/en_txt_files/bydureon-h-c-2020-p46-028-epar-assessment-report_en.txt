1.  Introduction 
On 15 Oct 2020, the MAH submitted a completed a paediatric study for Bydureon, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of a paediatric program based on an agreed Paediatric 
Investigational Plan (PIP), (PIP number: EMEA-000689-PIP01-09-M10). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Of note, the MAH has communicated the intention to submit a type II variation to update the Bydureon 
SmPC in Q4 2021 with a paediatric indication. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study BCB114 (Study code D5551C00002) is part of a paediatric program based 
on an agreed Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP), (PIP number: EMEA-000689-PIP01-09-M10) which 
is ongoing to assess the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as monotherapy or in 
combination with metformin, and/or sulphonylureas in patients who have not achieved adequate 
glycaemic control on maximally tolerated doses of these oral therapies, or in combination with insulin 
with or without other oral antidiabetic agents. 
The submitted paediatric study supports the use of Bydureon in paediatric patients (from 10 years to 
less than 18 years). The MAH has the intention to submit a type II variation to update the Bydureon 
with the proposed indication: “BYDUREON is indicated for use in patients 10 years and older with T2DM 
to improve glycaemic control in combination with other glucose- lowering medicinal products including 
basal insulin, when the therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate 
glycaemic control.” 
The variation application consisting of the full relevant data package is expected to be submitted by Q4 
2021. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Exenatide prolonged release was first approved for use in the US on the 27 January 2012 and in the EU 
on 17 June 2011. It is currently available as either as a vial and prefilled syringe single dose tray (SDT) 
or in a prefilled dual chamber pen (DCP), administered by subcutaneous injection. In order to avoid the 
need for recombination prior to administration, exenatide prolonged-release non-aqueous suspension 
via autoinjector was developed (Bydureon BCise; hereafter referred to as EQW). It was approved in 
the US on 20 October 2017 and in the EU on 27 August 2018. In the EU is approved for use in adults 
18 years and older with T2DM to improve glycaemic control in combination with other glucose-lowering 
medicinal products including basal insulin, when the therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, 
does not provide adequate glycaemic control.

Clinical study  
Study BCB114: “A phase 3, double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized, 
multicenter study to assess the safety and efficacy of exenatide once 
weekly in adolescents with type 2 diabetes” 
Description 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in paediatric and adolescent patients 10 
to 17 years of age with T2DM evaluating the glycemic control with exenatide extended release vs 
placebo. This study has been conducted as part of a paediatric program based on an agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (number: EMEA-000689-PIP01-09-M10), which assessed the potential therapeutic 
benefits of exenatide once-weekly in paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary efficacy objective of the study was to assess the effect on glycemic control, as measured 
by HbA1c, of EQW following 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo in children and adolescents 
with T2DM. 
The primary safety objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EQW compared with placebo 
following 24 weeks of treatment in children and adolescents with T2DM. 
Study design 
This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, Phase III study in adolescent patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with a stable dose of 
oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin. In addition to receiving study medications, all patients were to 
participate in a lifestyle intervention program encompassing diet and physical activity modifications.  
The total study duration was to be approximately 67 weeks. The study was divided in 4 periods (Figure 
1): 
•  Screening period (5 weeks) 
•  Controlled assessment period (24 weeks): double-blind, placebo-controlled period to examine 
the efficacy and safety of exenatide once weekly (EQW) compared with placebo. Approximately 
77 patients were to be randomly assigned in a 5:2 ratio to receive either EQW 2 mg (Group A) 
or placebo (Group B). 
•  Open-label extension period (28 weeks): open-label, uncontrolled period to examine the long-
term safety and efficacy of EQW. Patients assigned to the EQW 2 mg treatment (Group A) were 
to continue to be treated with EQW 2 mg during the open-label extension period (through 
Week 52). Patients randomized to placebo (Group B) were to receive EQW 2 mg beginning at 
the start of the open-label extension period through Week 52.

• 
Post-treatment follow-up period (10 weeks). 
Figure 1 Flow chart of study design 
An exploratory mixed meal substudy was performed in approximately 20 patients to evaluate the effect 
of EQW on postprandial beta-cell function (as assessed by C-peptide secretion) and postprandial 
glucose and glucagon responses during a mixed meal test (MMTT). 
All visits up to Week 62 (the end of the post-treatment follow-up period; last patient last visit: 06 May 
2020) took place in accordance with the CSP. Therefore, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
epidemic was not judged to meaningfully impact the overall quality of the study, including the conduct, 
data, and interpretation of results. 
CHMP comment: 
The overall design of the study as well as the study duration was adequate. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study population consisted of male or female children and adolescents of 10 to < 18 years of age, 
diagnosed with T2DM, and treated with diet and exercise alone or in combination with a stable dose of 
an oral antidiabetic agent (metformin and/or sulfonylurea [SU]) and/or insulin for at least 2 months 
prior to screening). 
Target Sample Size 
Approximately 77 patients were to be randomized into this study to yield 70 evaluable patients. This 
was estimated to provide an overall power of 74% to reject the null hypothesis of no difference 
between the 2 treatment arms assuming a true treatment difference of -0.7% between exenatide and 
placebo in changes from baseline for glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (%), with a common standard 
deviation of 1.0% and a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
At least 40% and not more than 60% of the randomized patients were to be females. At least 40% of 
patients were to be recruited from areas with similar ethnicity and lifestyle to those of the European 
Union member states.

CHMP comment: 
The selection of patients was adequate, in order to recruit a representative study population. The 
exclusion criteria included concomitant medications and conditions that might have rendered the 
interpretation of data difficult. Other exclusion criteria were in place to for the safety of the patients. 
Treatments 
Caregivers were to administer study medication (2 mg EQW or matching placebo) subcutaneously to 
the patient (or the patient self-administered, if deemed appropriate) once weekly (± 2 days) relative to 
the date of the first dose of study medication (Visit 2 [Week 0]), for the duration of the study, as 
applicable. Adjustments to dosing regimens were not permitted. 
Rescue Treatment 
Patients with a loss of glycemic control, defined as either an increase from baseline in HbA1c values by 
≥ 1.0% at 2 consecutive clinic visits that were at least 1 month apart, or a fasting plasma glucose 
value ≥ 250 mg/dL or random blood glucose value > 300 mg/dL for 4 days during a 7-day period, 
were to receive rescue treatment. Patients who required rescue therapy were to receive 
antihyperglycemic therapy (e.g., insulin) by the Investigator. Patients receiving rescue therapy were to 
remain in the study and continue receiving study medication, at the discretion of the Investigator. The 
temporary use of insulin to treat acute decompensation due to an intercurrent illness was permitted for 
up to 2 weeks. Extended use of insulin in this manner was to be considered as rescue treatment. 
CHMP comment: 
Exenatide prolonged release was given in accordance with the recommendations in the SmPC for 
Bydureon. Rescue medication was allowed. If prolonged insulin therapy was necessary, the patient 
was to discontinue from the study.

CHMP comment: 
Primary and secondary endpoints were adequate. 
Statistical Methods 
In general, primary and secondary continuous efficacy variables for which multiple postbaseline 
measurements were collected were to be analysed using a mixed model with repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach. The statistical analysis of categorical variables was to be conducted using a 
stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. If data has been collected at the Early Termination visit, it 
were to be included in the analyses. 
Intercurrent events that may have occurred during the study were defined as receipt of rescue 
therapy, study medication discontinuation, and study withdrawal. Efficacy data collected after the 
initiation of rescue medication or following discontinuation of study medication were to be excluded 
from the analyses, except for select sensitivity analyses and plasma EQW concentration endpoints, 
where data after rescue were included. 
The primary efficacy analysis was to compare treatment groups (EQW versus placebo) with respect to 
change in HbA1c from baseline (Visit 2 [Week 0]) to Visit 7 (Week 24) using MMRM. The model was to 
include change in HbA1c as the dependent variable and treatment group, visit, interaction between 
visit and treatment, region, baseline HbA1c and interaction between visit and baseline HbA1c as the 
fixed effects.

A fixed-sequence procedure hierarchical testing strategy was to be followed for the primary endpoint 
and secondary endpoints in order to protect the family wise error rate. Endpoints were to be tested in 
order from HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight to fasting insulin. 
All safety and tolerability variables (including examination of AEs, clinical laboratory measurements, 
physical examination findings, vital signs, and antibodies to exenatide) were to be summarized 
descriptively by visit to Week 52, and where applicable also for the 10-week follow-up, by treatment 
groups. Observations post rescue were to be included for safety analyses. 
CHMP comment: 
Statistical methods were adequate. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 159 patients enrolled in this study from 36 centers; 27 study centers randomized patients 
during the study (Figure 2).  
A total of 83 patients were randomized and entered the double-blind controlled assessment period: 59 
patients randomized to EQW and 24 patients randomized to placebo. Of the 83 randomized patients, 
82 (98.8%) received EQW/placebo treatment, 73 (88.0%) completed the controlled assessment 
period, and 72 (86.7%) completed treatment during the controlled assessment period. Of the 73 
patients who completed the controlled assessment period, all but 1 patient (randomized to EQW) 
entered the open-label extension period and received open-label EQW treatment. Of these patients, 64 
(77.1% of all randomized patients) completed the open-label extension period and 62 (74.7% of all 
randomized patients) completed treatment during the open-label extension period. No patients 
discontinued treatment during the controlled assessment period or the open-label extension period due 
to an AE.

Subjects Analysed (Analysis Sets) 
The Randomized Analysis Set, which included all randomized patients, consisted of 59 patients in the 
EQW group and 24 patients in the placebo group. One patient who was randomized to EQW did not 
receive any study medication and was excluded from the ITT, Evaluable, and Safety Analysis Sets. In 
addition, 1 patient who was randomized to placebo received a dose of EQW in error and was 
subsequently reassigned to the EQW group for analyses based on actual treatment (ie, for analyses 
based on the Safety and PK Analysis Sets). 
Of the patients who received at least 1 dose of randomized study medication, 55 patients in the EQW 
group and 0 patients in the placebo group had at least 1 postdose PK concentration assessment 
available and were included in the PK Analysis Set. A further 6 patients in the EQW group and 3 
patients in the placebo group also provided informed consent/assent for the substudy, participated in 
the standardized mixed meal test, completed study procedures in compliance with the main CSP and 
the substudy, and had valid and adequate pharmacodynamic measurements, and were included in the 
Standardized Mixed Meal Test Evaluable Analysis Set. Approximately 20 patients provided informed 
consent for the substudy; however, a high proportion of these patients failed screening. Therefore, the 
actual number of patients that participated in the mixed meal substudy was low. 
Baseline data 
The demographic, patient and baseline disease characteristics were generally representative of the 
intended adolescent population with T2DM. Demographic, patient, and baseline disease characteristics 
were broadly similar between the EQW and placebo groups, with the exception of minor imbalances in 
age, race, region, weight population percentile, and baseline diabetes duration; however, these 
imbalances would not be expected to affect the interpretation of the primary efficacy analysis. The pre-
existing conditions and concomitant medications were as expected for the study population, and 
similar between treatment groups (Table 1).

The mean baseline HbA1c was 8.17% and the mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 2.3 years. The 
mean baseline FPG was 166 mg/dL (9.2462 mmol/L) and the mean baseline eGFR was 107 
mL/min/1.73 m2. Prior to randomization, the most common antidiabetic medication was metformin 
alone, reported in 40.2% of patients, followed by insulin plus metformin, reported in 37.8% of 
patients. The majority of patients were Tanner stage 5 (69.5%), followed by Tanner stage 4 (17.1%), 
as expected based on the age of the study population. 
The baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the EQW and placebo groups, 
with the exception of diabetes duration: a higher proportion of patients in the EQW group had a 
duration of diabetes of < 1 year compared with the placebo group (31.0% and 12.5%, respectively), 
while a lower proportion of patients in the EQW group had a duration of diabetes of ≥ 1 and ≤ 5 years 
compared with the placebo group (58.6% and 83.3%, respectively) (Table 2). This imbalance would 
not be expected to affect the interpretation of the primary efficacy results.

eGFR was derived based on the Bedside Schwartz formula: eGFR (unit = mL/min/1.73 m2) = 41.3 × 
(Height in meters/Serum creatinine in mg/dL). 
Baseline was defined as the last nonmissing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) on or prior to first dose 
of randomized study medication. Percentages were calculated from the number of patients in the analysis 
set with nonmissing data, by treatment group and total. 
Duration of Diabetes (years) = (Date of screening – Date of diabetes diagnosis + 1) / 365.25. 
Prior antidiabetic medications were defined as antidiabetic medications that started prior to and continued 
past the first dose of randomized study medication. Anti-diabetic medication was identified based on 
medical review of concomitant medications recorded during the study using the WHO-Drug Enhanced plus 
Herbal 01Mar2020 version.

CHMP comment: 
The demographic, patient and baseline disease characteristics were representative of the intended 
population. Notably, the patients were overweight with a mean weight of 100 kg and mean BMI of 
36 kg/m2. No difference was observed in terms of pre-existing conditions and concomitant 
medications between study groups but there were minor imbalances in age, race, region, weight 
population percentile, and baseline diabetes duration. It is agreed that these imbalances are 
generally not expected to affect the interpretation of the primary efficacy analysis.

Data Source: Table 14.2.1.1, Table 14.2.2.2.1, Table 14.2.2.3.1, Table 14.2.2.4.1. 
Primary Endpoints: 
EQW was statistically superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c at Week 24 (p = 0.012). Sensitivity 
analyses of the primary endpoint were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
The reduction in mean HbA1c observed within the first 24 weeks of EQW treatment gradually 
diminished over time, returning to approximate baseline levels by Week 52. 
There were no significant differences between treatment groups in change from baseline at Week 24 in 
FPG, body weight, or fasting insulin. However, for patients in the EQW group numerical decreases in 
FPG and body weight, and numerical increases in fasting insulin were observed during the controlled 
assessment period. 
At Week 24, numerically higher proportions of patients achieved HbA1c goals of < 6.5%, ≤ 6.5%, and 
< 7% in the EQW group compared with the placebo group. 
At Week 24, there was a numerical decrease from baseline in mean triglycerides in the EQW group 
compared with a numerical increase in the placebo group. There were no notable differences between 
treatment groups in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol. 
There were no significant differences between treatment groups in change from baseline at Week 24 in 
systolic or diastolic blood pressure. 
The cumulative proportion of patients needing rescue medication due to failure to maintain glycemic 
control at Week 24 was low (EQW: 1.7%, placebo: 0%). 
Reductions in HbA1c were observed among patients who were switched from placebo to open-label 
EQW treatment, consistent with observations among patients treated with EQW during the controlled 
assessment period. 
For the EQW group, exenatide plasma concentration reached steady state by Week 8 and was stable 
over time (Weeks 12 to 52).

CHMP comment: 
The study met the primary endpoint, as the difference in HbA1c was statistically significant lower in 
the EQW group vs placebo. The decrease in HbA1c was clinically relevant. However, HbA1c returned 
to baseline at week 52.  
The reason why the effect on HbA1c decreases over time is unclear, as the effect in adult patients in 
the pivotal study was maintained up to 52 weeks.  
Although no significant differences were observed in secondary endpoints, there was a trend 
towards lower FPG and body weight in the EQW group. During the open-label phase of the study, 
patients switched from placebo to EQW treatment experienced also a reduction in HbA1c. 
PK analysis in paediatric patients shows a similar pharmacokinetic profile as compared to adults, 
where a stable exenatide plasma concentration was achieved by week 7-8. 
A mixed-meal substudy was originally planned as to assess the effect of EQW on beta-cell function, 
but no conclusion has been drawn from it due to the low number  (n=9) of patients included. 
Anti-drug antibody results 
The primary endpoint is summarized descriptively by antibody status and by visit for the Evaluable 
Analysis Set in  Table 4 and Table 5. 
Antibodies to exenatide were observed in the majority of patients (93.0%) in the EQW group at any 
time during the study, with more patients having high positive results (63.2%) compared with low 
positive results (29.8%). After an initial increase in positive antibody levels, with the percentage of 
patients positive for antibodies peaking at Week 12 (for high positive antibody results [58.8%]) or 
Week 24 (for low positive antibody results [55.1%]), antibody positivity decreased over the remaining 
time period to approximately half of patients (approximately quarter in each category) with any 
positive result at the 10-week follow-up period (Table 6).  
The primary endpoint was also summarized descriptively by antibody status and by visit for the 
Evaluable Analysis Set in Table 4 and Table 5. At Week 24, the mean change from baseline in HbA1c in 
the EQW group was greater in patients with low positive antibodies (-0.73%) compared with those with 
high positive antibodies (+ 0.07%). From Week 4 to Week 12, mean HbA1c decreased over time for 
the low positive group and remained relatively stable for the high positive group. Due to the low 
number of patients in the EQW group with negative antibody results, no further comparisons could be 
made.

CHMP comment: 
Almost all treated patients developed anti-drug antibodies throughout the study, whereof 60% 
developed high titres, as compared to 32% in in phase 3 studies in adults. Of note, HbA1c mean 
change from baseline was lower in patients with high antibody titres vs those patients with low 
levels, even though there are responders in both groups. At week 52, mean HbA1c has returned to 
baseline level in the group with high antibody titres, whereas a reduction of ca 0,7% still remain in 
group with low antibody levels. The reduction was greater in patients without antibodies, but no 
conclusion can be made due to the low number of patients.  
Safety results 
Extent of exposure 
In the controlled assessment period, the mean duration of EQW/placebo exposure was similar between 
the EQW and placebo groups (157.3 and 165.6 days, respectively). For the whole study period, the 
mean duration of EQW exposure was longer in the EQW group (356.7 days) than the placebo → EQW 
group (161.1 days), as expected. The majority of patients in the EQW group were exposed to 
exenatide for ≥ 364 days (76.0%), while the majority of patients in the placebo → EQW group were 
exposed to exenatide for 168 to 223 days (72.7%). 
CHMP comment: 
The duration of exposure was similar for both study groups during the controlled assessment period 
but taking into account the open-label extension phase period the exposure was longer in the EQW 
group as compared to the placebo → EQW group. 76 % of patients were treated for more than 365 
days.

Controlled assessment period AE is defined as an AE starting on or after day of first dose of study medication 
up to but not including Week 24 for patients entering the extension period. For patients not entering extension 
period, the period is defined up to and including last dose of study medication + 7 days (+ 90 days for SAEs 
and other clinically significant or related AEs). Extension period AE was defined as an AE starting on or after 
day of first dose of open-label EQW through Week 52 or last dose + 7 days for patients who discontinued 
open-label EQW prematurely (+ 90 days for SAEs and other clinically significant or related AEs). Events are 
captured up to the later of period definition or Week 52, where patients completed treatment. Percentages were 
calculated from the number of patients in the analysis set for the study period by treatment group. Patients

Data source: Table 14.3.2.1.1. 
Exenatide was generally well-tolerated in adolescents with T2DM and safety findings in this study 
were consistent with the known safety profile of the product. There were no AEs with an outcome 
of death or AEs leading to treatment or study discontinuation reported during the study. 
The incidence of AEs overall was generally lower in the EQW group (61.0%) than the placebo 
group (73.9%) during the controlled assessment period. The majority of AEs were mild or 
moderate in intensity throughout the whole study. 
CHMP comment: 
During the controlled assessment period, adverse events related to treatment occurred in a 
higher proportion of patients in the EQW compared with the placebo group. During the open-
label extension period, the reporting of AEs and SAEs was similar in both study groups. No 
deaths occurred during the study and the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity.

During the controlled assessment period, the most common AEs by SOC in both the EQW and 
placebo groups were: infections and infestations (16 patients [27.1%] and 5 patients [21.7%], 
respectively), gastrointestinal disorders (13 patients [22.0%] and 6 patients [26.1%], 
respectively), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (7 patients [11.9%] and 2 patients [8.7%], 
respectively). 
During the open-label extension period, the most common AEs by SOC in both the EQW and 
placebo → EQW groups were infections and infestations (10 patients [20.0%] and 6 patients 
[27.3%], respectively) and gastrointestinal disorders (6 patients [12.0%] and 3 patients 
[13.6%], respectively). 
Adverse events by intensity 
During the controlled assessment period, the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. 
One patient (1.7%) in the EQW group and 2 patients (8.7%) in the placebo group reported at 
least 1 severe AE. Of the severe AEs reported, 1 event of major depression in the EQW group

and 1 event of irritable bowel syndrome in the placebo group were considered serious but neither 
led to treatment or study discontinuation. 
There were no deaths reported during the study. No discontinuations of study treatment due to 
an AE were reported during the study. 
The incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) was low and comparable between the EQW and placebo 
groups during the controlled assessment period (Table 9). No SAEs were reported by more than 
1 patient in the EQW or placebo groups and none were considered related to study medication by 
the Investigator. Similar results were observed for patients with SAEs during the open-label 
extension period.

Data source: Table 14.3.4.1.1. 
CHMP comment: 
The majority of events were mild or moderate in intensity and only 4-6% of events were severe in 
intensity. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
During the controlled assessment period, the proportions of patients with gastrointestinal 
disorder-related AEs overall were slightly lower in the EQW group than the placebo group (13 
patients [22.0%]) and 6 patients [26.1%], respectively). 
The following gastrointestinal disorder PTs were reported in a higher proportion of patients in the 
EQW group compared with the placebo group: 
•  Diarrhea: 5 patients (8.5%) versus 1 patient (4.3%), respectively 
•  Nausea: 4 patients (6.8%) versus 1 patient (4.3%), respectively 
• 
Vomiting: 3 patients (5.1%) versus 0 patients, respectively 
•  Upper abdominal pain: 3 patients (5.1%) versus 0 patients, respectively 
None of the gastrointestinal disorder-related AEs in the EQW group led to study drug 
discontinuation and the majority were mild or moderate in intensity with most resolving during 
the study. Only the severe event of irritable bowel syndrome reported in the placebo group 
during the controlled assessment period was considered serious. 
During the open-label extension period, the proportions of patients with gastrointestinal disorder-
related AEs overall in both the EQW and placebo → EQW groups (6 patients [12.0%] and 3 
patients [13.6%], respectively) were lower than those observed for the EQW group during the 
controlled assessment period (13 patients [22.0%]). 
CHMP comment: 
The incidence of GI AEs was low and comparable between the EQW and placebo groups during the 
controlled assessment period. The most frequent gastrointestinal disorder-related AEs were 
diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain.  
Hypoglycaemia 
During the controlled assessment period, hypoglycemic events were reported in 8 patients 
(13.6%) and 1 patient (4.3%) in the EQW and placebo groups, respectively. Of the events 
reported, there were no major hypoglycemic events. The proportion of patients with minor 
hypoglycemic events was low and similar between the treatment groups: 1 patient (1.7%) with 1 
event in the EQW group compared with 1 patient (4.3%) with 1 event in the placebo group. 
Other hypoglycemic events (which did not meet the criteria for major or minor episodes) were 
reported in 8 patients (13.6%), with a total of 12 events, in the EQW group and 1 patient 
(4.3%), with a total of 6 events, in the placebo group. 
Among the 8 patients with hypoglycemic events in the EQW group, insulin use at baseline was 
reported for the majority of patients (6 of 8 patients), while no insulin or SU use at baseline was

reported for the remaining patients (2 of 8 patients). For the 1 patient with hypoglycemic events 
in the placebo group, insulin use at baseline was reported. 
During the open-label extension period, hypoglycemic events were reported in 4 patients (8.0%) 
in the EQW group and 1 patient (4.5%) in the placebo → EQW group. Of the events reported, 
there were no major hypoglycemic events. 
In the EQW group, the incidence of patients with minor hypoglycemia was similar between the 
treatment periods. 
CHMP comment: 
No major hypoglycaemic events were reported during the study. The occurrence of minor 
hypoglycaemic events was low and comparable between the study groups. Most of patients with 
hypoglycaemia events reported insulin and concomitant medication use at baseline. 
Injection site-related events 
During the controlled assessment period, the proportions of patients with AEs of injection site 
reactions were generally low and comparable between the EQW and placebo group. In both the 
EQW and placebo groups, injection site reactions occurred most frequently at Week 4 (5 patients 
[8.5%] and 2 patients [8.7%], respectively), then gradually diminished over time. No injection 
site reactions were reported after Week 12 in either treatment group. 
During the open-label phase of the treatment period, the incidence of AEs of injection site 
reactions was low (2 patients [4.0%] in the EQW group only). 
All AEs of injection site reactions were reported in patients using the prefilled syringe device (no 
injection site reactions were reported in patients using the dual chamber pen device) and were 
mild in intensity; none met the criteria for a SAE. 
CHMP comment: 
Injection site reactions were few and comparable between the EQW and placebo groups during both 
the controlled assessment period and open-label period. Of note, all injection-site reactions were 
reported among patients using the prefilled syringe device (none were reported among patients 
using the dual chamber pen device). 
The proportions of patients experiencing injection site reactions was low and comparable 
between the EQW and placebo groups during the controlled assessment period. Similar results 
were observed for patients who received open-label EQW during the treatment period. All 
injection-site reactions were reported among patients using the prefilled syringe device (none 
were reported among patients using the dual chamber pen device). 
Potentially immune-related events 
During the controlled assessment period for the EQW group, potentially immune-related AEs 
were more common among patients who were positive for exenatide antibodies (10.9%) 
compared with patients who were negative (0%).  
Of the patients who developed positive antibody status, potentially immune-related AEs were 
reported for a similar proportion of patients with a higher titer (10.8%) and with a low titer 
(11.1%). The most common potentially immune-related AEs were injection site erythema,

reported in 3 EQW patients (8.1%) with a higher titer, and injection site pruritus, reported for 1 
EQW patient (2.7%) with a higher titer and 1 EQW patient (5.6%) with a low titer. 
During the open-label extension period, potentially immune-related AEs were reported for 4 
patients (8.2%) in the EQW group who were all positive for exenatide antibodies. No patients 
were negative for exenatide antibodies and, therefore, no comparison could be made. 
Of the patients who developed positive antibody status, potentially immune-related AEs were 
reported for a similar proportion of patients with a higher titer (8.6%) and with a low titer 
(7.1%). At the PT level, none of the potentially immune-related AEs were reported by more than 
1 patient. 
None of the potentially immune-related AEs were considered serious or led to study drug 
discontinuation. 
CHMP comment: 
In the EQW group, there was a trend towards a higher incidence of potentially immune-related AEs 
among patients who were positive for exenatide antibodies compared with patients who were 
negative. This trend is consistent with an immune mediated mechanism for some of these events.  
Because the number of patients with negative antibodies at any time during the study were small, 
these results should be interpreted with caution. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation 
There were no clinically meaningful trends in laboratory parameters over time and no notable 
differences between treatment groups in laboratory parameters. No patients met the criteria for 
a potential Hy’s Law case. 
One patient in the EQW group reported an AE of carcinoembryonic antigen increased during the 
off-treatment period.  Serum calcitonin levels were undetectable (< 2 ng/L) throughout the 
study, and per the Investigator, the patient had no evidence of any medical condition that would 
result in elevated carcinoembryonic antigen. 
Vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
Treatment with EQW was associated with a small but notable reduction in systolic blood pressure 
and a small increase in heart rate. Of note, there were no AEs of hypotension or tachycardia 
reported during the study. No other clinically meaningful trends in vital signs over time or 
notable differences between treatment groups in vital sign parameters were observed. There 
were no new safety concerns related to vital signs.  
CHMP comment: 
No clinically meaningful changes were observed with regards to laboratory parameters other than a 
small but notable reduction in systolic blood pressure and a small increase in heart rate in the EQW 
group. No adverse events related to hypotension were reported. This is in line with short acting 
exenatide studies the paediatric population.

Tanner Pubertal Stage 
Development and growth assessed by Tanner staging resulted in comparable results for patients 
treated with EQW and placebo during the controlled assessment period. 
At Week 24, an overall Tanner stage of V was reported for the majority of patients treated with 
EQW or placebo (71.7% and 76.2%, respectively). Overall Tanner stage results at Week 52 were 
consistent with those observed at Week 24 for the treatment groups. 
CHMP comment: 
Development and growth assessed by Tanner staging resulted was similar between study groups. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted the results of Study BCB114 as part of the agreed PIP and subsequently plans 
to submit a type II variation by Q4 2021 to update the Bydureon SmPC with the proposed indication: 
“BYDUREON is indicated for use in patients 10 years and older with T2DM to improve glycaemic control 
in combination with other glucose- lowering medicinal products including basal insulin, when the 
therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control.” 
Exenatide prolonged-release non-aqueous suspension via autoinjector (Bydureon BCise) is 
administered by subcutaneous injection. This formulation was developed to simplify the administration 
of exenatide once weekly and was approved in the EU in 2018 for the use in adults 18 years and older 
with T2DM. This device was used by study subjects recruited from August 2018 and onwards whereas 
subjects recruited prior to this date used the prefilled syringe.  
Study BCB114 was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo- controlled, randomized, multicenter study to 
assess the safety and efficacy of exenatide once weekly in adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with 
type 2 diabetes. The overall design of the study was adequate as well as the study duration of 24 
weeks, with a follow-up period up to 67 weeks. The COVID-19 pandemic was not judged to 
meaningfully impact the overall quality of the study, including the conduct, data, and interpretation of 
results since the last patient visit occurred in May 2020. 
The selection of patients was adequate, in order to recruit a representative study population. The 
exclusion criteria included concomitant medications and conditions that might have rendered the 
interpretation of data difficult. Other exclusion criteria were in place to for the safety of the patients.  
During the treatment period of the study exenatide prolonged release was given in accordance with the 
recommendations in the SmPC for Bydureon. Rescue medication was allowed. If prolonged insulin 
therapy was necessary, the patient was to discontinue from the study. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visit 7 (Week 
24). The secondary efficacy endpoints were related to other relevant variables of metabolic control. 
Both the primary and secondary endpoints in terms of efficacy and safety were relevant, including 
Tanner pubertal stage.  
In addition, plasma exenatide concentration as well as several PD endpoints in the Exploratory Mixed 
Meal Substudy were to be evaluated. Approximately 20 patients provided informed consent for the 
mixed meal substudy; however, a high proportion of these patients failed screening. Therefore, the 
actual number of patients that participated in the mixed meal sub-study was too low for any 
conclusions to be drawn.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/94820/2021

The statistical methods were adequate. A total of 159 patients enrolled in this study from 27 study 
centres. A total of 83 patients were randomized and entered the double-blind controlled assessment 
period: 59 patients randomized to EQW and 24 patients randomized to placebo. The dropout rate was 
low, and no patients discontinued treatment during the controlled assessment period or the open-label 
extension period due to an AE.  
The demographic, patient and baseline disease characteristics were representative of the intended 
population. Notably, the patients were overweight with a mean weight of 100 kg and mean BMI of 36 
kg/m2. No difference was observed in terms of pre-existing conditions and concomitant medications 
between study groups. However, there were minor imbalances in age, race, region, weight population 
percentile, and baseline diabetes duration. Although it is agreed that these imbalances are generally 
not expected to affect the interpretation of the primary efficacy analysis,  the applicant is invited to 
discuss within the submission of the type II variation whether the imbalance in weight population 
percentiles between the study groups may have influenced the study results due to potential 
differences in study drug exposure.  
The study met the primary endpoint, as the difference in HbA1c was statistically significant lower in the 
EQW group vs placebo. The decrease in HbA1c was clinically relevant. However, HbA1c returned to 
baseline at week 52.  
The reason why the effect on HbA1c decreases over time is unclear, as the effect in adult patients in 
the pivotal study was maintained up to 52 weeks. The MAH is invited to discuss on the difference in 
long term effect between adult and paediatric patients within the submission of the type II variation. 
Although no significant differences were observed in secondary endpoints, there was a trend towards 
lower FPG and body weight in the EQW group. During the open-label phase of the study, patients 
switched from placebo to EQW treatment experienced also a reduction in HbA1c. 
Almost all treated patients developed anti-drug antibodies throughout the study, whereof 60% 
developed high titres, as compared to about 30% in in phase 3 studies in adults. Of note, HbA1c mean 
change from baseline was lower in patients with high antibody titres vs those patients with low levels, 
even though there are responders in both groups. At week 52, mean HbA1c has returned to baseline 
level in the group with high antibody titres, whereas a reduction of ca 0,7% still remain in group with 
low antibody levels. The reduction was greater in patients without antibodies, but no conclusion can be 
made due to the low number of patients. The MAH is invited to discuss within the coming type II 
variation on the relevance of anti-drug antibody development in the primary and secondary outcomes 
and whether (a lack of) HbA1c change from baseline could be used to identify patients with an 
inadequate treatment response, possibly due to the development of antibodies, in order to identify 
patients who will not benefit from treatment.  
With regards to safety, exenatide prolonged release was generally well-tolerated in adolescents with 
T2DM. Safety findings in this study were consistent with the known safety profile of the drug in the 
adult population. The incidence of AEs overall was generally lower in the EQW group vs placebo. The 
incidence of SAEs was also low, in total 7 events but with a higher reporting in the EQW group. None of 
the SAEs were considered related to treatment by the Investigator. The most common AEs were upper 
respiratory tract infection and abdominal pain in the EQW and placebo groups, respectively. Most AEs 
were mild or moderate in intensity. The incidence of GI-related AEs was low and comparable between 
the EQW and placebo groups during the controlled assessment period. There were no major 
hypoglycaemic events reported during the study. The occurrence of minor hypoglycaemic events was 
low and comparable between study groups. The proportions of patients experiencing injection site 
reactions was low and comparable between the study groups. Of note, all injection-site reactions were 
reported among patients using the prefilled syringe device. Furthermore, there was a trend towards a

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

higher incidence of potentially immune-related AEs among patients who were positive for exenatide 
antibodies compared with patients who were negative.   
Treatment with EQW was associated with a small but notable reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 
small increase in heart rate but here were no AEs of hypotension or tachycardia reported during the 
study. Development and growth assessed by Tanner staging resulted was similar between study 
groups. 
In summary, the safety profile does not appear to differ from what is known from the use of exenatide 
in adults. No new safety concerns arise from the data submitted 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH has submitted a completed paediatric study (BCB114) for Bydureon, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. This study has been conducted as part of a paediatric 
program based on an agreed PIP, which is ongoing to assess the use of exenatide in the treatment of 
paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
Exenatide prolonged release showed a clinically relevant and statistically significant effect on metabolic 
control compared to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment and the MAH intend to submit a variation to 
update the SmPC of Bydureon in Q4 2021 with a paediatric indication. The safety profile does not 
appear to differ from what is known from the use of exenatide prolonged release in adults and no new 
safety concerns arise from the data submitted. 
No further regulatory action is warranted at this time point, however a variation application consisting 
of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) concerning the use of Bydureon in the 
paediatric population should be submitted by Q4 2021.

accordingly. In addition, sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC for Lynparza hard capsules are revised based 
on updated safety data analysis.  
The RMP version 20 has also been submitted. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0262/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0262/2018 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.  
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 21 July 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/1215/4/2016/II). The

Opinion 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The applied indication is for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer and homologous recombination repair gene mutations (germline and/or somatic) who have 
progressed following a prior new hormonal agent. 
Epidemiology  
Worldwide in 2018, prostate cancer was estimated to be the fifth most common cause of cancer death in 
men (358,989 deaths) and the second most common newly diagnosed cancer in men (1,276,106 new 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 10/162 
 
  
 
 
cases) (Globocan 2018). In Europe in 2018, prostate cancer was estimated to be the third most common 
cause of cancer death in men (107,315 deaths) and the most common newly diagnosed cancer in men 
(449,761 new cases) (ECIS 2018). 
Almost all patients dying from prostate cancer will have mCRPC, and 90% of overall mortality in mCRPC 
patients is attributable to the underlying malignant disease (Scher et al 2015). For patients diagnosed with 
metastatic disease, the 5-year survival rate is 30% (American Society of Cancer 2019, Siegel et al 2019).   
Biologic features 
Most prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas. Following the initial evaluation and diagnosis, approximately 
90% of men undergo primary localized treatment with curative intent (Cooperberg et al, 2010). Androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) (i.e., surgical or medical castration) is often initiated in men with rising 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after primary therapy. Following ADT, the next most frequent clinical state 
in the current model of prostate cancer progression is that of CRPC, defined as disease progression 
despite castrate hormone levels (testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL). Men with CRPC can have metastatic or non-
metastatic disease. In the majority of patients, metastatic CRPC evolves from non-metastatic CRPC and 
PSA doubling time has been shown to be a strong predictor of the development of metastases in these 
patients (Moreira et al, 2015; Scher et al, 2015). 
Between 24% to 30% of mCRPCs have loss of function mutations in genes involved in homologous 
recombination repair (HRR) of DNA damage response (Abida et al 2017, Armenia et al 2018, Chung et al 
2019, Mateo et al 2015, Robinson et al 2015).  
In this application, the HRR genes refer to a family of 15 pre-specified genes with a biological rationale for 
loss of function to predict sensitivity to olaparib. 
Enrichment of BRCA1/2, ATM and CDK12 mutations in advanced prostate cancer has been documented in 
the literature by several studies (Abida et al 2017, Armenia et al 2018, Chung et al 2019, Mateo et al 
2018). Mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes ([BRCA] BRCA1 and/or BRCA2) are the most 
prevalent HRR gene mutations in mCRPC (with BRCA2 more prevalent than BRCA1) with ataxia 
telangiectasia mutated (ATM) the second most frequently mutated HRR gene in mCRPC (Armenia et al 
2018, Chung et al 2019, Mateo et al 2015, Robinson et al 2015). Based on literature, the prevalence of 
BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations is expected to be between 8.4% and 16%. The high representation of 
BRCA2 mutations in advanced/metastatic prostate cancer is considered to be a consequence of BRCA2 
mutations being associated with a particular aggressive phenotype (Castro et al 2013, Castro et al 2015, 
Chung et al 2019, Mateo et al 2018) rather than these mutations being acquired under treatment with 
standard therapies (e.g., androgen receptor mutations and amplifications [Mateo et al 2018]). 
Management 
New hormonal agents (NHAs) such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide are the preferred choice for 
first-line therapy for mCRPC patients.  
However, once mCRPC patients have failed NHA, the benefit from approved second-line treatment options 
such as taxanes or switching to another NHA, appears substantially diminished and no clear single standard 
of care exists. Considering the currently available treatments, there is a high unmet clinical need for an 
effective treatment option that is tolerable, suitable for long-term use, convenient for administration, able 
to significantly extend radiological progression-free survival (rPFS), delay symptom progression, without 
detriment to overall survival (OS) or health-related quality of life (HRQoL), particularly after failure of NHAs, 
especially among the patient population who previously received the taxanes or were not eligible for this 
toxic regimen.

2.1.2.  About the product 
The active substance of Lynparza is olaparib, a potent oral human PARP inhibitor (PARP-1, PARP-2, and 
PARP-3) that exploits deficiencies in DNA repair pathways to preferentially kill cancer cells with these deficits 
compared to normal cells. 
Lynparza is approved in EU for the treatment of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas. 
The MAH applied for a new indication for olaparib tablets formulation as follows: “Lynparza is indicated as 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and 
homologous recombination repair gene mutations (germline and/ or somatic) who have progressed 
following a prior new hormonal agent.”  
The final recommended indication is: “Lynparza is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and BRCA1/2-mutations (germline and/or 
somatic) who have progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent.” 
The recommended dose of Lynparza in monotherapy is 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, 
equivalent to a total daily dose of 600 mg. The 100 mg tablet is available for dose reduction. 
It is recommended that treatment be continued until progression of the underlying disease or 
unacceptable toxicity. Medical castration with luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue 
should be continued during treatment in patients not surgically castrated. 
For BRCA1/2-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), patients must have 
confirmation of a deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation (using either tumour or blood 
sample) before Lynparza treatment is initiated. BRCA1/2 mutation status should be determined by an 
experienced laboratory using a validated test method. 
Genetic testing should be conducted by an experienced laboratory using a validated test. Local or central 
testing of blood and/or tumour samples for germline and/or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations have been used 
in different studies. DNA obtained from a tissue or blood sample has been tested in most of the studies, 
with testing of ctDNA being used for exploratory purposes. Depending on the test used and the 
international classification consensus, the BRCA1/2 mutations have been classified as 
deleterious/suspected deleterious or pathogenic/likely pathogenic.   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Apart from an updated environmental risk assessment, no new non-clinical data were provided in the 
initial submission supporting this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
During the procedure, the MAH provided a discussion on the biological rationale for the HRRm gene 
panel-based selection approach supported by non-clinical (data not shown) and clinical data from the 
literature. In summary, clinical efficacy data from TOPARP (an open label, two part, Phase II study) were 
presented to support the sensitivity to olaparib in mCRPC patients with tumours harbouring defects in 
some genes associated with defects in homologous recombination DNA repair (Mateo et al, 2015 and 
2020). Results in mCRPC patients with BRCA1/ BRCA2 mutations are discussed further under the section 
on clinical aspects.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The potential environmental impact from use of the drug substance olaparib has already been evaluated 
and  supported  approval  of  the  capsule  (ovarian,  fallopian  tube,  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer)  as  a 
monotherapy  and  the  tablet  formulation  (epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer, 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas) as a monotherapy. 
An updated ERA covering this extension of indication has been submitted. 
The PECsurfacewater (0.16 µg/L) is above the Phase I action limit (0.01 μg/L) therefore the risk assessment 
for olaparib enters Phase II. The Log Pow (1.55 at pH 7) value is <4.5, therefore, it can be concluded that 
olaparib is not PBT or vPvB, as such, no further screening for PBT potential of olaparib is required in Phase 
I. 
It is predicted that in domestic sewage, olaparib will not significantly partition into the solid phase during 
waste water treatment. The measured Kd in active sludge was <3700 L/Kg, therefore an environmental 
risk assessment in the terrestrial compartment is not required in Tier B. 
Olaparib is not expected to undergo significant biodegradation during sewage treatment and is considered 
hydrolytically stable. It is therefore expected to pass into the aquatic environment where the results from 
the water sediment study showed that olaparib is predicted to partition into the sediment phase. Greater 
than 10% of  the  applied  radioactivity  was  associated  with the  sediment  phase;  therefore,  the  effects of 
olaparib on sediment dwelling organisms was investigated in Tier B. 
The PEC/PNEC ratios for microorganisms (1.6 x 10-5), ground water (1.2 x 10-3) and surface water (5.0 x 
10-3) are below the trigger ratios of 0.1, 1 and 1 respectively, indicating no significant environmental risk 
in these compartments. Therefore, no further evaluation of the drug substance and/or its metabolites on 
microorganisms or pelagic aquatic organisms is needed in Tier B. 
Olaparib is not expected to undergo significant biodegradation or adsorb to sludge solids during sewage 
treatment.  Therefore,  olaparib  is  expected  to  enter  the  aquatic  environment  and  partition  into  aquatic 
sediments  where  it  is  unlikely  to  be  significantly  degraded.  Whilst  the  DT50  data  for  the  persistence  of 
olaparib (251-551 days) are above the criterion for a very persistent compound (DT50 >180 days for total 
system), the octanol-water partition coefficient (Log Pow = 1.55) value for olaparib is <3 indicating that 
the risk of bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms is low. Based on these results, olaparib does not fulfil the 
criteria to be classified as a PBT or vPvB compound. 
The  PEC/PNEC  ratios  for  ground  water,  surface  water  and  sediment  are  below  1,  and  the  PEC/PNEC  for 
microorganisms  is  below  0.1,  indicating  that  olaparib  is  unlikely  to  present  a  risk  to  biological  sewage 
treatment processes or aquatic environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
An updated ERA covering this extension of indication has been submitted. Olaparib is not a PBT or vPvB 
substance. The total PEC surfacewater value is above the action limit. Considering the phase I and phase 
II data, olaparib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The MAH also provided a discussion on the biological rationale for the HRRm gene panel-based selection 
approach supported by non-clinical data (data not shown; see discussion on clinical efficacy).

Page 13/162 
 
  
 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, olaparib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. Although the role 
of the selected gene mutations in the HRR pathway is acknowledged, the clinical benefit of a PARP 
inhibitor on the non-BRCA mutations remains unknown (see discussion on clinical efficacy).

the pivotal, phase 3 study (PROfound study) were integrated in order to update the previous version of 
the population-PK model. The refined model was used in order to predict the exposure (AUC and Cmax) 
in patients enrolled and analyzed from study PROfound. The predicted systemic exposure was used in 
order to test for Exposure-Response (Efficacy and Safety) relationship. 
Population-PK Model 
In order to describe the concentration-time profiles of olaparib after oral tablet administration all available 
data from patients who received olaparib as tablets, including data from 9 previous studies and data from 
PROfound, were pooled. 
Clinical studies included in the present analyses are listed below. All studies were considered in the PopPK 
analysis. The table lists in addition if data from these studies (or parts of the studies) have been used in 
the efficacy and/or safety analysis.

Model development (Refinement) 
The previous established population PK model was reduced to contain only the absorption route for 
tablets and used as initial model with the same covariance (i.e., correlation of CL/F and Vc/F, as well as 
Q/F and Vp/F) and covariate structure. The current population PK analysis included only data collected 
with olaparib oral tablet formulation.  
As a first step in the covariate model building, the significance of the previous covariates (i.e., tablet 
strength on Ka and ECOG performance status on CL/F) was confirmed. Baseline values of age, creatinine 
clearance, and body weight, sex, race, ECOG performance status, tumour location, and BRCA mutation 
status were tested as covariates on selected model parameters. Since no additional covariates were found 
to be statistically significant, the final model was  
The following model was chosen as final model: 
• 
Linear two-compartmental distribution model with first order absorption from dosing into central 
compartment and zero-order absorption into dosing compartment. 
•  Correlation of individual random effects for apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent central 
volume (Vc/F). And separately of apparent intercompartmental clearance (Q/F) and apparent 
• 
• 
peripheral volume (Vp/F). 
Proportional residual error model. 
Time dependent CL/F, mimicking difference for single dose and steady-state conditions 
implemented by assuming single dose clearance up to 96 hours post first dose and steadystate 
clearance from 96 hours post first dose on. 
•  Mild ECOG status (ECOG1) and Moderate ECOG status (ECOG2) as categorical covariates on CL/F. 
• 
Tablet strength as time-dependent covariate on tablet absorption rate (Ka). Two groups of tablet 
strength were used (with 50 and 150 mg tablet strength being the reference group). Group 1: 
tablet strength of 100 mg. Group 2: 125, 200, 225, 250, and 300 mg tablet strength. 
The parameter estimates for the final updated model are reported in Table 2. In this table "CL, Vc, Q, 
Vp" should be understood as representing the apparent parameters "CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F, Vp/F.

Model Qualification/Validation 
Model diagnostics were provided. The random effects appeared to be adequately normally distributed 
(Figure 1) and the predicted and observed individual concentrations were generally symmetrically 
distributed around the line of identity (Figure 2). The different residuals and the NPDE did not show any 
trends, both over time and over the population prediction. Individual plots of observations, individual and 
population predictions were provided on linear and logarithmic scale, respectively.

A dose-normalized VPC was generated for the final model as shown in Figure 1, supporting the adequacy 
of the model to describe the observed data. VPCs stratified by study are shown in Figure 3.

Goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks (VPCs) demonstrated an adequate description of the 
data by the model. The estimated apparent clearance (7.81 L/hour) and the central volume (4.55 L) were 
comparable (less than 16% difference) to the values from the previous population PK model for the tablet 
formulation (Olaparib-MS-06). There was a 20% lower clearance for doses at steady state compared to 
the clearance after a single dose.

olaparib stratified by study 
Model-Based Systemic exposure predictions 
Simulations of the model were performed to determine the exposure in terms of area under the 
concentration time curve at steady state (AUCss) as well as maximum and/or minimum concentration 
within a dosing interval at steady state (Cmaxss and/or Cminss) for twice daily dosing for various dose 
levels. For patients at a 300 mg bid dosing regimen the geometric means (and %CVs) for individually 
predicted Cmaxss, AUCss, and Cminss were 7.63 μg/mL (34.6%), 49.2 μg.h/mL (44.1%), and 1.55 
μg/mL (72%) respectively. These values were similar to values reported based on the previous PopPK 
model which were 7.67 μg/mL (40.2%), 49.0 μg.h/mL (51.6%), and 1.57 μg/mL (86.2%). Individual 
exposure metrics were determined based on the empirical Bayes estimates of the model parameters.

Exposure-Efficacy Relationship 
Correlation between olaparib exposure and PFS 
The correlation between olaparib exposure and PFS was explored by plotting Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves 
with each of the considered olaparib exposure metrics (acAUC, AUCss, Cmaxss, and Cminss) stratified by 
tertiles (see Figure 4).  
All exposure metrics indicated an on average longer progression free survival time for the olaparib treated 
patients compared to the control group and for patients with a higher olaparib exposure compared to a 
lower olaparib exposure. Still, confidence intervals partly overlapped between the control group and the 
lower exposure group and the three exposure groups. At the end of the observation period of 18 months 
the fraction of progression free patients was about 10% for all groups.

Modeling efficacy by Cox regression 
As the KM curves suggested a potential olaparib exposure/response relationship on PFS Cox proportional 
hazard regression models were fitted to assess whether a significant relationship of exposure and PFS can 
be detected. Enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate treated patients were not considered in this analysis. 
Base model 
Univariate models with one covariate (BAGE, BWTKG, PSABASE, RACE, DISSEV,BRCAM2, ATM, CDK12) 
respectively were fitted to include all relevant covariates into the base model. Only showed a hazard ratio 
(HR) significantly different (p<0.01) from. The base model including the two significant covariates, 
BRCAM2 and CDK12, is shown in Table 6.

Exposure metrics models 
Cox proportional hazard model including either acAUC, AUCss, Cmaxss, or Cminss were fitted to the data. 
The estimation results are shown in Table 7. Inclusion of none of the exposure metrics led to a 
significant improvement of the model fit. The estimated HRs were smaller than one suggesting a lower 
risk of disease progression with increasing exposure. However, the 95%-CIs of the HR estimates for all 
exposure metrics include 1 indicating that no statistically significant correlation of exposure and PFS could 
be detected based on the PROfound data. 
The total number of olaparib patients included in this analysis was 74, this may limit the power to detect 
statistically significant trends.

Exposure-Safety Relationship 
The relationship of safety events and olaparib exposure was analysed based on a pooled data set from 
the same studies as the population PK analysis, with exception of the study D081DC00008. In this study 
(D081DC00008), olaparib had been administered only in combination with abiraterone and the safety 
analysis concerned olaparib only treatment. The safety analysis also included the data from the placebo 
arm in one study (SOLO2) which was not considered in the PK analysis. The data set included 576 
patients on active olaparib treatment and 99 patients in the placebo maintenance group in SOLO2. 
Patients had adverse event information recorded as a function of the CTC grade, with 0 for no event and 
1, 2, 3 and 4 for mild, moderate, severe, and life threatening, respectively.

Adverse events (AEs) for anaemia, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, fatigue, headache, nausea, 
neutropenia, and vomiting were evaluated. The considered event per patient and adverse event type was 
the first event of the maximum severity grade observed for the respective patient. The AEs were 
summarized by severity grade and type of AE for placebo patients and olaparib treated patients 
separately indicating moderately higher AE rates for olaparib treated patients in general. As in previous 
analyses, the exposure/AE response relationship was analysed based on Cmax, Cmin, and AUC at day of 
occurrence of considered safety event (dCmax, dCmin, dAUC) as well as the acAUC at day of occurrence 
of the considered safety event. First, proportions of the AEs by grade and stratified by quartiles of the 
exposure metrics (in comparison to the placebo patients) were graphically explored. Second, ordinal 
logistic regression was used to evaluate significant correlations (p<0.001) of the severity grades of the 
AEs and the different exposure metric values.  
Graphical investigation of Exposure-AE Relationship: 
Anaemia AEs were significantly correlated with all exposure metrics, while decreased appetite, fatigue, 
and vomiting showed a significant correlation with dAUC and dCmin. dAUC showed also to be a significant 
predictor for nausea. The pattern of AE to olaparib exposure relationship found by the current analysis 
was comparable to the pattern found in the previous analysis. Significant relationships to exposure were 
found for anaemia, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and no relationship was detected for 
neutropenia by both analyses. Comparable results were also found for diarrhoea (i.e., weak relationship). 
Dysgeusia was suggested to be significantly correlated with exposure based on the previous analysis 
while only a weak correlation could be detected by the current analysis. The current analysis also found a 
weak correlation of exposure and headache while none was detected previously. Based on the current 
analysis, the best predictor of AEs was dAUC while it was acAUC and dCmax in the previous analysis. 
Adverse event as a function of the CTC grade, with 0 for no event and 1, 2, 3 and 4 for mild, moderate, 
severe, and life threatening, for each exposure metric is illustrated below.

Modeling safety by ordinal logistic regression 
The exploratory plots indicated apparent relationships of proportions of observed safety grades for some 
of the adverse events (e.g., anaemia, nausea, fatigue) to olaparib exposure measured by dCmin or dAUC. 
Ordinal logistic regression analyses for all adverse events were conducted to further explore potential 
correlation between the exposure metrics and the frequency or severity of the different AEs. 
A full covariate modeling approach was chosen, in which the base model consisted of a model that 
considered BAGE, BWTKG, RACE, SEX, DISSEV, TUMGRP, and BRCA as predictors for the occurrence of 
the different adverse events. Subsequently, the different exposure metrics were introduced into the 
model as additional predictors and the change in objective function (-2xLogLikelihood) from the base 
model to the models including exposure was determined. Results are shown in Table 8. Following this 
analysis dAUC appeared to be the best predictor for occurrence of adverse events. Models for anemia,

decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting improved on the 0.001 significance level, i.e., by a 
drop of the objective function of more than 10.83 points, when including dAUC in the model. Anemia 
adverse events showed the strongest relationship with exposure in general as any of the exposure 
metrics improved the model fit on the 0.001 significance level.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Olaparib presented as tablets as monotherapy, is already approved in adult patients with breast cancer, 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion 
of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Olaparib pharmacokinetics (ADME) as well as the influencing 
intrinsic factors have been fully characterised and already evaluated with the hard gelatine capsules and 
the tablets.  
The variation under review concerns the use of olaparib tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and homologous recombination repair gene 
mutations (germline and/or somatic) who have progressed following a prior new hormonal agent. The 
claimed dose of olaparib in this indication is the same than the dose approved for other solid tumours 
indications. This extension indication is not claimed for the hard gelatine capsule. 
The MAH provided the results of an updated population PK analysis integrating the sparse data from 
study PROfound. The population PK of olaparib after oral administration using tablets was well described 
by a two-compartmental distribution model with linear elimination from the central compartment and 
consecutive zero and first order absorption.  
The model characteristics are in line with previous results. However, the Omega-Shrinkage (Inter 
Individual Variability) was too high (more than 25%) for most of the model parameters: Vc, Q, Vp, Ka, 
Tk0. As a consequence, the predictive power of the model is questionable. Therefore, the model-based 
prediction of the individual exposure should be considered cautiously and as such the exposure-Response 
relationship investigations should also be. 
In the current analysis, the clearance was 20% smaller for steady-state administration compared to 
single doses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 35/162 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Covariate analysis of the latest pooled tablet formulation data was consistent with the previous covariate 
analysis of pooled tablet and capsule formulation data. The estimated effects were comparable to the 
previous population PK analysis (Olaparib-MS-06). 
Patients with an ECOG performance status of 1 had a 18% smaller apparent clearance and patients with 
an ECOG performance status of 2 had a 44% smaller apparent clearance compared to patients with an 
ECOG performance status of 0. 
The absorption rate was dependent on the tablet strength. Compared to tablets of 50 or 150 mg olaparib 
tablets with 125, 200, 225, 250, or 300 mg had a faster first order absorption and tablets with 100 mg 
olaparib had a faster first order absorption than any other tablets. 
No additional covariate relationships for age, body weight, creatinine clearance, sex, ethnicity, disease 
severity, tumour location, hepatic impairment status, tablet strength, BRCA mutation type were detected. 
The analysis of exposure-efficacy relationship of data from pivotal PROfound study revealed no clear 
correlation between exposure and efficacy endpoint PFS. However, the outcome of such analysis should 
be considered cautiously, as the reliability of the model-based prediction of exposure is questionable (see 
comments on the pop-PK model). 
The graphical analysis visualizing the event rates by exposure quartile and a model-based analysis using 
ordinal logistic regression indicated a similar safety pattern as was detected in a previous safety analysis 
(Olaparib-MS-07). This updated analysis of exposure-AE relationship (including data from the pivotal 
PROfound study) revealed no particular concern by comparison to the previous investigations. However, 
the outcome of such analysis should be considered cautiously, as the reliability of the model-based 
prediction of exposure is questionable (see comments on the pop-PK model) 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No new biopharmaceutical or clinical pharmacology study has been submitted to support the proposed 
indication. The current clinical pharmacology package provides sufficient characterisation of the key PK 
characteristics of olaparib and when combined with in vitro drug metabolism and PK profiling data and in 
vivo DDI studies, it provides sufficient data in support of an adequate labelling for special populations and 
DDI. The results of the Pop PK analysis and exposure-efficacy/ safety analysis should be considered 
cautiously. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study D081DC00007 (PROfound) 
Methods 
This was a Phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre trial to assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib 
monotherapy in patients with mCRPC that have qualifying HRR gene mutations that were predicted to be 
deleterious or suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be detrimental/lead to loss of function) who 
have failed prior treatment with an NHA.

4. Candidate for treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate with documented current evidence 
of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, where metastatic status was defined as at least 1 
documented metastatic lesion on either bone scan or computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scan. Patients whose disease spread is limited to regional pelvic lymph nodes or local 
recurrence (e.g., bladder, rectum) were not eligible. 
5. Patients must have progressed on prior NHA (e.g., abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide) for the 
treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and/or CRPC. Determination of progression was done per local 
investigator. 
6. Serum testosterone levels ≤50 ng/dL (≤1.75 nmol/L) within 28 days before randomisation. 
7. Patients without prior surgical castration must have been currently taking and willing to continue LHRH 
analog (agonist or antagonist) therapy throughout the duration of study treatment.

• 
• 
Either archival or de novo biopsies were acceptable. 
If patients had a mutation in 1 of the 15 HRR genes based on prior prostate cancer tissue 
specimen testing by the commercially available FoundationOne assay, they must have had the 
mutation confirmed as a qualifying mutation by FMI. Residual DNA (stored at FMI) from the 
original FoundationOne test was to be used for confirmation. Patients who did not have sufficient 
residual DNA from their original test were to be analysed in-silico for qualifying HRR gene 
mutations, according to the criteria in place for determining eligible mutations in PROfound, based 
on their original FoundationOne test data, but these patients must have supplied a sufficient 
formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour sample to carry out retrospective central confirmation 
using the FMI CLIA HRR CTA. 
10. Patients must have had normal organ and bone marrow function measured within 28 days prior to 
administration of study treatment as defined below:

• 
• 
Patients must have creatinine clearance estimated of ≥51 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault 
equation for males or based on a 24 hour urine test.

Mutation status 
The procedure for assignment of HRR mutation status in PROfound was as follows: 
•  Screening part 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 40/162 
 
  
 
o  Prospective tHRR testing for patient selection using the FMI CLIA HRR CTA: HRR 
mutation  status  was  determined  through  central  tumour  tissue  testing  performed  by 
Foundation  Medicine  Inc.  using  the  CLIA  HRR  CTA.  For  this  purpose,  either  an  archival 
tumour block, or a de novo tumour biopsy sample was required.  
o  Patients with prior FoundationOne test result: Patients could also enter screening if 
they had a prior FoundationOne test result which confirmed an eligible tHRRm result. These 
patients required generation of a confirmatory CLIA HRR CTA result. Confirmatory CLIA 
HRR CTA testing was performed on residual DNA samples, if available. Patients who did 
not have sufficient residual DNA available were able to proceed to screening part 2 following 
reanalysis  of  the  existing  FoundationOne  result  using  the  CLIA  HRR  CTA  mutation 
calling and classification process. 
Patients with a tHRRm result were eligible to participate in screening part 2. 
•  Screening part 2 
o  Confirmed  FMI  F1CDx  subgroup:  To  determine  the  patient  population  who  would 
comprise  the  FoundationOne  CDx  positive  subgroup  (called  “Confirmed  FMI  F1CDx 
subgroup”), results obtained for tHRR status using the CLIA HRR CTA were evaluated prior 
to database lock to determine if the patient was tHRRm according to the FoundationOne 
CDx  quality  control  (QC)  criteria  and  classification  rules.  No  retesting  of  study 
samples using the FoundationOne CDx test was performed in PROfound. 
o  Confirmed Myriad gBRCAm subgroup: The germline mutation status of the BRCA1/2 
genes  was  assessed  retrospectively,  prior  to  database  lock,  through  central  testing 
performed using the BRACAnalysis CDx test.

Treatments 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to the treatments as specified below: 
-  Olaparib tablets orally 300 mg [2 x 150 mg tablets] twice daily [bd], tablet formulation 
-  Investigators choice of NHA with either enzalutamide 160 mg orally once daily (od) or abiraterone 
acetate 1000 mg orally od with prednisone 5 mg orally bd (prednisolone was permitted for use 
instead of prednisone, if necessary) 
Treatment continued until objective radiological disease progression or until patients were unable to 
tolerate study treatment.  
Once patients receiving investigators choice of NHA were determined to have objective radiological 
progression by a blinded independent central radiological (BICR), or by investigator assessment if after 
the date of DCO for the primary analysis, they were eligible to switch to treatment with olaparib.

Sample size 
The primary endpoint of the study was rPFS in Cohort A. It was planned to randomise approximately 240 
patients (2:1 ratio of olaparib:investigators choice of NHA), with the rPFS analysis occurring once 
approximately 143 rPFS events (confirmed by BICR) had occurred.  
The PROfound study was designed to enrol approximately 340 subjects with 240 subjects in Cohort A and 
approximately 100 subjects in Cohort B. The study sample size calculation was based on Cohort A with 
the ratio of patients between Cohort A and Cohort B based on an assessment of natural prevalence of the 
genes in the literature at the time of study design (Robinson et al 2015). 
It was expected that the targeted sample size of 240 patients in Cohort A with approximately 143 rPFS 
events (60% maturity) would provide 95% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in 
rPFS at a 2-sided alpha level of 5% assuming true treatment effect was a HR=0.53. This translates to an 
approximate 4.5-month improvement in median rPFS over an assumed 5-month median rPFS on 
enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate assuming rPFS was exponentially distributed. 
Cohort B of the study was to consist of approximately 100 patients with qualifying HRR gene mutations 
other than BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM. These patients were to be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to 
olaparib:investigators choice of either enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate. 
The number of patients enrolled in Cohort B was not driven by a formal sample size calculation and was 
determined by the enrolment period for Cohort A. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to either olaparib or pre-declared investigator choice of either enzalutamide 
or abiraterone acetate in each of the Cohorts A and B.  
Patients with mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM were randomised in Cohort A (irrespective of co-
occurring mutations in one of the 12 other HRR genes), whereas patients with mutations among  other 
genes were randomised in Cohort B. 
Randomization was stratified based on prior receipt of taxane chemotherapy (yes vs no) and presence of 
measurable disease at baseline (yes vs no). 
Blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Hypotheses were to be tested using a MTP with an alpha-exhaustive recycling strategy (Burman et al 
2009). Upon achieving statistical significance on the primary endpoint rPFS in Cohort A, testing of each of 
the secondary endpoints, ORR (Cohort A), rPFS (Cohort A+B), time to pain progression (Cohort A), and 
overall survival (Cohort A) were to be performed sequentially with the 2-sided 5% level of alpha recycled 
from the primary rPFS (Cohort A) endpoint. This testing procedure was to stop when the entire test mass 
is allocated to non-rejected hypotheses. Implementation of this pre-defined ordered testing procedure, 
including recycling, was to strongly control type I error at 5% (2-sided), among all key hypotheses. 
Analysis populations 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 46/162 
 
  
 
-  Full analysis set (FAS) (all randomised patients) for analysis of the efficacy and HRQoL 
endpoints (except for ORR, duration of response [DoR] and best overall response [BoR]) 
-  Patients evaluable for response (EFS): a subset of the FAS population who had measurable 
disease at baseline as per the RECIST 1.1 criteria (the EFR analysis set) for the analysis of ORR, 
DoR and BoR 
-  Safety analysis set (SAS): All patients who were randomised as part of the global enrolment 
and received at least one dose of randomised study treatment in Cohort A or in Cohort B were 
included in the safety analysis set (SAS) in their respective cohorts. 
-  Safety Switch Analysis Set: All patients randomised to investigator choice, who received at 
least one dose of study treatment in Cohort A or in Cohort B, who subsequently switched to 
olaparib upon progression and received at least one dose of olaparib were included in the safety 
switch analysis set. 
Analysis methods 
The study was designed to provide at least 95% power to demonstrate a statistically significant 
difference in rPFS at a 2-sided alpha level of 5% assuming a true treatment effect was indicated by a 
hazard ratio (HR) of 0.53 in Cohort A. 
- 
rPFS  
Primary analysis 
The rPFS analysis was planned for when approximately 143 events (confirmed by BICR) had 
occurred in Cohort A. 
rPFS was defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression 
or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the subject 
withdraws from randomized therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression.   
Objective progression in soft tissue by RECIST 1.1 was defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of 
the diameters of the target lesions (compared to previous minimum sum) and an absolute 
increase of ≥5 mm, or an overall non-target lesions assessment of progression or a new lesion. 
Patients had tumour assessments at baseline and every 8 weeks relative to the date of 
randomisation until objective radiological disease progression by BICR.  
Bone lesions were assessed by bone scan using PCWG-3 (prostate cancer working group 3). If 2 
or more new metastatic bone lesions were observed compared to the 8-week assessment, the 
confirmatory scan performed at least 6 weeks later and preferably at the next scheduled 
assessment, must have shown the persistence of or an increase in the number of metastatic bone 
lesions compared to the prior scan for progression to be documented.  
rPFS was analysed using a log-rank test. Patients who had not progressed (defined as complete 
response [CR], partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD] by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue disease, 
or non-progressive disease [PD] for bone disease) or died at the time of analysis were censored 
at the time of the earliest date of their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment (taking the latest 
target lesion, non-target lesion or new lesion scan date) or bone scan assessment that showed 
non-PD. If performed at the same visit, the latest of the previous RECIST 1.1 assessment or bone 
scan assessment was used.

Subgroup analysis 
The following subgroups of the FAS in Cohort A and Cohort A+B were analysed for rPFS for stratification 
factors: 
• 
Previous taxane use (yes, no) 
•  Measurable disease at baseline (yes, no) 
Values collected on the eCRF were used to define subgroups for stratification factors. Additional 
subgroups of interest included: 
•  HRR gene mutations using all patients (Cohort A+B) in the FAS; each individual gene and pre-
specified combinations 
•  Metastases at baseline: bone only vs visceral vs other - Cohort A and Cohort A+B 
• 
ECOG performance status at baseline (0, 1 or 2) - Cohort A and Cohort A+B 
•  Age at randomisation (<65, ≥65) - Cohort A and Cohort A+B

•  Region (Asia, Europe, North and South America) - Cohort A and Cohort A+B 
•  Race (White, Black/African-American, Asian, Other) - Cohort A and Cohort A+B 
•  Baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA; above/below median baseline PSA of the patients across 
both treatment groups) - Cohort A and Cohort A+B 
-  Confirmed ORR assessed based on BICR assessed RECIST and bone scan data using PCWG-3 
only patients with measurable disease (target lesions) at entry were to be included in the 
analysis. A patient was classified as a responder if the RECIST 1.1 criteria for a CR or PR are 
satisfied (as well as the absence of confirmed progression on bone scan assessed by PCWG-3) at 
any time up to and including the defined analysis cut-off point. For each treatment group, the 
ORR was the number of patients with a CR and PR divided by the number of patients in the 
treatment group in the FAS with measurable disease at baseline. 
-  TTPP, analysed using log-rank test. Pain was assessed using Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form 
[BPI-SF] worst pain [Item 3] and quantified with a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) where 
0=“no pain” and 10=“worst pain imaginable”. An analgesic log in ePRO handheld devices was 
used by subjects to electronically record all analgesic medication doses and dosage times to track 
pain medication use. Only changes in opiate use were considered in pain progression evaluation. 
Opiates taken by patients were converted into oral morphine equivalents (OME) as defined by 
Chung et al using the Analgesic Quantification Algorithm (AQA). For each visit or time point, pain 
score and opiate analgesic use (AQA score) were averaged over 7 days of assessments. A 
minimum of 4 days assessments was required to compute the average pain score. Pain 
progression was defined as an increase of 2 or more points from baseline in average BPI-SF worst 
pain [Item 3] score on the 0 to 10 NRS. 
-  OS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any cause. Any 
patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded 
date on which the patient was known to be alive. An interim analysis of OS was carried out at the 
time of the rPFS analysis, with the final OS analysis scheduled to take place when approximately 
146 deaths have occurred (61% maturity) in Cohort A, which is estimated to occur in 2Q2020. 
Exploratory analyses of OS in Cohort A, adjusting for impact of subsequent PARP inhibitor trial or 
treatment (or other potentially active investigational agents), may be performed if a sufficient 
proportion of patients switch. 
In PROfound, pre-specified sensitivity analyses to the main analyses of rPFS, confirmed ORR, TTPP and 
OS were performed in the subset of patients whose qualifying gene mutation status was confirmed 
positive according to the testing QC metrics and mutation classification process approved for the FMI 
F1CDx test or the subset of patients whose gBRCAm status was confirmed by the Myriad test. The FMI 
F1CDx subgroup analysis was performed for Cohort A, Cohort B and Cohort A+B; however, the Myriad 
gBRCAm subroup analysis was performed for Cohort A+B only.

Patients with BRCA1m/BRCA2m 
Median age was 68 years and 67 years in the olaparib and comparator arms, respectively. Prior therapy 
in the olaparib arm was 71% taxane, 41% enzalutamide, 37% abiraterone acetate and 20% both 
enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate. Prior therapy in the comparator arm was 60% taxane, 50% 
enzalutamide, 36% abiraterone acetate and 14% both enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate. Fifty-eight 
percent (58%) of patients in the olaparib arm and 55% in the comparator arm had measurable disease at 
study entry. The proportion of patients with bone, lymph node, respiratory and liver metastases was 
89%, 62%, 23% and 12%, respectively in the olaparib arm and 86%, 71%, 16% and 17%, respectively 
in the comparator arm. Most patients in both treatment arms had an ECOG of 0 or 1 (93%). Baseline pain 
scores (BPI-SF worst pain) were 0-<2 (52%), 2-3 (10%) or >3 (34%) in the olaparib arm and 0-<2 
(45%), 2-3 (7%) or >3 (45%) in the comparator arm. Median baseline PSA was 57.48 µg/L in the 
olaparib arm and 103.95 µg/L in the comparator.

HRR testing results 
-  Screening part 1 
Overall, 4425 patients were screened for inclusion into PROfound. Samples from 4069 patients were 
received at Foundation Medicine and 356 screened patients did not supply a sample. Of the 4069 patients 
who supplied a sample, 4047 patients were eligible for testing and were tested for their tHRR status at 
Foundation Medicine for the PROfound study and 22 patients were ineligible for testing. 
The 4047 patients tested at FMI include 12 (0.3%) patients (who had a prior FoundationOne test that was 
confirmed by CLIA HRR CTA testing or data re-analysis and 4035 (99.7%) patients who were 
prospectively tested using the CLIA HRR CTA. 
Out of these 4035 patients: 
•  2780 patients (68.9%) had a valid CLIA HRR CTA test result.

o  767 patients were reported as having a mutation detected in one or more of the HRR 
gene panel members. A total of 380 prospectively tested tHRRm patients were 
randomised onto the PROfound study and 387 patients were screen failed for non-testing 
related reasons. Overall, 27.6% (767/2780) successfully tested patients were determined 
as tHRRm. 
o  2013 patients were reported as having no qualifying mutation detected in all of the 15 
HRR gene panel members and as a result were screen failed for PROfound 
•  1255 patients were reported as a failed CLIA HRR CTA test. Reasons for failures were split into 3 
categories: pathology review, DNA extraction and Post DNA extraction (sequencing workflow 
including data interpretation). Some of the patients failed due to more than one reason. The 
primary reasons for failures among the 1255 patients reported as FAIL were as follows: Note: 
some patients supplied more than one sample and the multiple supplied samples failed for 
different reasons, these patients are summarised in a separate category: 
o  277 (22.1 %) patients failed due to not meeting pathology review criteria. 
o  533 (42.5%) patients failed DNA extraction failure criteria. 
o  280 (22.3 %) patients failed post DNA extraction criteria. 
o  165 (13.1%) patients failed for more than one of the categories above. 
• 
In addition to patients who failed testing, 315 patients were initially reported as failed by the CLIA 
HRR CTA test but subsequently had another tissue sample tested which was successful. The 
reasons for reported failure of the first test was were as follows 
o  100 (31.7%)8%) out of these 315 patients failed due to not meeting pathology review 
criteria. 
o  119 (37.8%) patients failed DNA extraction failure criteria. 
o  81 (25.7%) patients failed post DNA extraction criteria. 
o  15 (4.8%) patients failed for more than one of the categories above. 
Overall, 4035 samples from 4425 screened patients were prospectively tested in PROfound. The 
prospective sample testing success rate was 68.9% (2780/4035). 
In total, 387 patients were randomised using either a prospectively generated CLIA HRR CTA tHRRm test 
result (n = 380, 98.2%) or a confirmed FoundationOne tHRRm test result (n = 7, 1.8%).

Of the 224 patients in Cohort A with a single mutation, approximately two thirds of patients had a BRCA1 
or BRCA2 mutation alone and one third of patients had an ATM mutation alone. Of the 135 patients in 
Cohort B with a single mutation, two thirds of patients had a CDK12 mutation alone. The remaining one 
third of patients had a single mutation in 1 of 9 HRR genes (BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK1, CHEK2, PALB2, 
PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51D and RAD54L). No patients in Cohort B had a FANCL or RAD51C mutation 
alone. 
A total of 21 patients in Cohort A and 7 patients in Cohort B had co-occurring mutations.

-  Screening part 2 
o  Confirmed FMI F1CDx Subgroup 
Out of 387 patients randomised based on the CLIA HRR CTA QC criteria and rules, application of the 
FoundationOneCDx QC criteria resulted in 6 patients (1.6%) not passing QC criteria as they did not 
meet the minimum tissue volume requirements (≥0.6mm3). Furthermore, an additional 2 patients 
were randomised solely on a prior FoundationOne result available without CLIA HRR CTA confirmatory 
results from tissue or DNA. Overall, therefore, there were 379 (97.9 %) patients who had a result 
which would be considered as valid by applying the FoundationOneCDx QC criteria and 8 patients 
excluded due to low tissue volume (n=6) or due to not having a CLIA HRR CTA result (n=2). 
For 379 patients with valid test results according to the FoundationOneCDx QC criteria a further 3 
patients were excluded from the confirmed FMI F1CDx subgroup as they had a BRCA mutation which 
was included in the curated mutation list for CLIA HRR CTA, but not included in the curated mutation list 
for FoundationOneCDx FDA approved CDx BRCA rules. 
In total, 376/387 (97.2%) randomised patients were considered as tHRRm according to the 
FoundationOneCDx QC and mutation classification rules. These patients comprise the Confirmed FMI 
F1CDx tHRRm subgroup. These 376 patients are assigned as follows: 
-  240 patients in Cohort A 
-  136 patients in Cohort B 
o  Confirmed Myriad gBRCAm subgroup 
Subjects confirmed to have a qualifying HRR gene mutation, were required to submit a blood sample for 
germline HRR gene analysis after successfully passing screening part 2. Of the 387 randomised patients, 
354 patients had a blood sample available for testing. 
As germline diagnostic development was not planned at the outset of PROfound, the main study consent 
did not include consent for development of a germline diagnostic, only germline testing was consented in 
the main study consent. To facilitate use of germline HRR gene data for companion diagnostic 
development, patients had to sign an optional consent for future medical research which did permit 
diagnostic development activities. Germline HRR testing to support companion diagnostic development, in 
patients who provided optional consent for future medical research, was performed at Myriad using the 
BRACAnalysis CDx and tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations only. 
Out of the 288 patients who were germline tested and successfully reported at Myriad, a total of 62 
patients were reported as carrying a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1 
and/or BRCA2 (61 Deleterious, 1 Suspected Deleterious). All gBRCAm patients were in Cohort A. 
Of the tBRCAm patients tested for their gBRCA status, 61/114 carried a deleterious or suspected 
deleterious germline mutation according to Myriad’s classification. Within the 174 patients who were non-
tBRCAm, 1 patient was reported as gBRCAm. This patient was randomised into Cohort A on the basis of 
an ATM mutation detected by prospective testing using the CLIA HRR CTA. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 12: Retrospective gBRCA testing of patients randomised onto the PROfound study 
Figure 13: Overall mutation status in Myriad gBRCA tested patients 
Overall, patients with BRCA1m, BRCA2m detected in their tumours were patients enrolled on the basis of 
prospective central testing, with the exception of 3 patients enrolled using a local test result. Of the 160 
patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation in PROfound, 114 patients were retrospectively tested to 
determine if the identified BRCA1/2 mutation was germline or somatic in origin. Within these patients, 63 
BRCA1/2 mutations were identified in the germline blood sample and hence were determined to be 
germline in origin. The remaining 51 patients did not have a tumour detected BRCA1/2 mutation 
identified in the germline blood sample and hence the BRCA1/2 mutations are determined to be somatic 
in origin. For the remaining 46 patients, somatic or germline origin is unknown.

Outcomes and estimation 
•  Primary endpoint: rPFS by BICR (cohort A) 
The DCO for the analysis of rPFS (4 June 2019) took place when 174 progression events had occurred 
(71% maturity) in Cohort A, approximately 26 months after the first patient was randomised. 
The progression status based on BICR at the time of rPFS analysis is presented below.

Progression, as assessed by BICR, was defined by RECIST 1.1 and/or PCWG-3 or death (by any cause in the 
absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomised therapy or received another 
anticancer therapy prior to progression. 
The HR and CI were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for the variables selected in the 
primary pooling strategy (prior taxane use and measurable disease in Cohort A).  The Efron approach was used 
for handling ties.  An HR <1 favours olaparib 300 mg bd. 
The analysis was performed using the log-rank test stratified by the variables selected in the primary pooling 
strategy (prior taxane use and measurable disease in Cohort A) using the Breslow method for handling ties. 
The midpoint between the time of progression and the previous evaluable assessment (RECIST or PCWG-3) 
was used in this analysis. Values resulting in non-integer values were rounded down. 
Progression used the actual rPFS event times of patients who progressed or died in the absence of progression 
following 2, or more, not evaluable tumour assessments. In addition, patients taking subsequent therapy prior to 
progression or death were censored at their last evaluable assessment. 
f)  Unequivocal progression was included as an event. 
g)  Revised confirmation criteria where bone progression accompanied by unequivocal clinical progression did not 
require a confirmatory bone scan.

h DoR is the time from the first documentation of CR/PR until the date of radiological progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG-3 as 
assessed by BICR, or death in the absence of disease progression. If a patient does not progress following a response, then their rPFS 
censoring date was used as the date at which the patient was censored for DoR. Includes patients who had measurable disease at 
baseline and had a confirmed response (CR or PR). Calculated using the Kaplan Meier method.

o The HR and CI were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for the variables selected in the primary pooling 
strategy (prior taxane use in Cohort A). The Efron approach was used for handling ties. An HR <1 favours olaparib 300 mg bd. 
p Confirmed response defined as a reduction in PSA level of 50% or more on 2 consecutive occasions at least 3 weeks apart compared 
with baseline. Patients may have more than one confirmed response but will be counted one for this response rate. 
q CTC conversion defined as the proportion of patients achieving a decline in the number of CTCs from ≥5 cells/7.5 mL at baseline to 
<5 cells/7.5 mL at any visit post baseline. All patients in the FAS were included, regardless of whether or not they had a baseline CTC 
measurement. Of note, patients with a CTC count at baseline of <5 cells/7.5 mL were counted as not having CTC conversion. 
r CIs calculated using Clopper-Pearson exact method for binomial proportion. 
Note: In PROfound, in order to strongly control the Type I error at 5% 2-sided, an MTP was employed across the primary endpoint 
(rPFS [Cohort A]) and key secondary endpoints (confirmed ORR [Cohort A], rPFS [Cohort A+B], TTPP [Cohort A] and OS [Cohort A]). 
All other variables that were tested (time to first SSRE, time to opiate use for cancer related pain, confirmed ORR for soft tissue, PFS2, 
time to pain severity progression and time to deterioration in FACT-P) were at a 2-sided significance level of 5% but not 
adjusted for multiplicity. In the FMI F1CDx subset and Myriad gBRCAm subset all variables (rPFS, confirmed ORR, TTPP and OS) were 
not adjusted for multiplicity. Twenty-one patients in Cohort A had a co-occurring mutation.

Time to pain severity progression defined as time from randomisation to time point at which worsening in pain is observed for 
asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients at baseline. Analgesic use included in the definition. Pain is defined using BPI-
SF pain severity subscale.  Overall pain severity score is calculated for each patient/visit as the mean of the individual non-
missing items (worst, least, average, right now) of the BPI-SF. 
The HR and CI were calculated using a Cox Proportional Hazards model adjusted for the variables in the primary pooling strategy (no 
variables in Cohort A and measurable disease in Cohort A+B).  The Efron approach was used for handling ties.  An HR <1 favours 
olaparib 300 mg bd. 
The analysis was performed using the log-rank test stratified by the variables in the primary pooling strategy (no variables in 
Cohort A and measurable disease in Cohort A+B) using the Breslow method for handling ties. 
Pain palliation defined for patients with a BPI-SF ‘worse pain’ item 3 score ≥4 points at baseline and was assessed as the proportion of 
patients with a decrease of ≥ 2 points in BPI-SF item 3 score at 12 weeks, confirmed at least 2 weeks later, without a ≥1 point 
increase (or ≥2 increase if starting value was 0) in AQA analgesic score.  Pain palliation compared using logistic regression (PROC 
GENMOD) adjusting for the variables selected in the primary pooling strategy: no variables (Cohort A), no variables (Cohort A+B).  
An odds ratio > 1 favours olaparib 300 mg bd.  CI calculated using profile likelihood method.  An odds ratio >1 favours olaparib 300 
mg bd.

Twenty-one patients in Cohort A and 28 patients in Cohort A+B had a co-occurring mutation. 
The analysis was performed using a MMRM with treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, baseline FACT-P total score and 
baseline score by visit interaction, with prior taxane use and measurable disease included as fixed effects. The treatment by visit 
interaction remains in the model regardless of significance. An unstructured covariance matrix is used to model the within-
patient error. The Kenward-Roger approximation is used to estimate degrees of freedom. 
FACT-P Total score change from baseline values can be a minimum of -156 and a maximum of 156.  TOI score change from 
baseline values can be a minimum of -104 and a maximum of 104.  FWB and PWB score change from baseline values can be a 
minimum of -28 and a maximum of 28.  PCS score change from baseline values can be a minimum of -48 and a maximum of 48.  
FAPSI-6 score change from baseline values can be a minimum of -24 and a maximum of 24.  FACT-G Total score is the sum of 
PWB, SWB, EWB and FWB.

Ancillary analyses 
•  Co-occurring HRR mutations 
Co-occurring HRR mutations are defined as HRR alterations occurring in at least 2 different HRR genes in 
a patient. Proportion of co-occurring HRR mutations in PROfound randomised HRRm patients was 7.2% 
(28/387), which was consistent with the total proportion of co-occurring HRR mutations in all PROfound 
screened mCRPC population with a positive HRRm at 7.6% (59/778), which represents the largest clinical 
trial mCRPC dataset to date.

a The analysis performed included the stratification factors selected in the primary pooling strategy as covariates. 
Progression, as assessed by BICR, was defined using RECIST 1.1 and/or PCWG-3 or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomised 
therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy. 
The analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model that contains a term for treatment, factor and treatment by factor interaction. 
Size of circle is proportional to the number of events. Grey band represents the 95% CI for the overall (all patients) HR. An HR <1 favours olaparib 300 mg bd. 
Subgroup categories with fewer than 5 events across both treatment groups are not presented. 
Median PSA used in this analysis was derived from Cohort A+B.

Progression, as assessed by BICR, was defined by RECIST 1.1 and/or PCWG-3 or death (by any cause in the absence of 
progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomised therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to 
progression.  The analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model that contains a term for treatment, factor and 
treatment by factor interaction.  CI calculated using profile likelihood method.  Subgroups with fewer than 5 events across both 
treatment groups do not have HRs and CIs presented. 
The analysis performed included the stratification factors selected in the primary pooling strategy as covariates. 
Analyses are based on patients with single and co-mutations. 
Includes patients with the following mutations: BARD1 and/or BRIP1 and/or CHEK1 and/or CHEK2 and/or FANCL and/or PALB2 and/or 
PPP2R2A and/or RAD51B and/orRAD51C and/or RAD51D and/or RAD54L. 
Gene subgroup analysis is based on patients with a single HRR mutation. 
Median OS and its CI were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique.  The HR and its CI were calculated using a Cox 
Proportional Hazards model, adjusting for prior taxane and measurable disease as covariates, with the Efron approach being used 
for handling ties. 
Time to first SSRE data are from a post hoc exploratory analysis for Cohort A+B. 
The HR and CI were calculated using a Cox Proportional Hazards model adjusted for the variables selected in the primary pooling 
strategy: prior taxane.  The Efron approach was used for handling ties. 
An HR <1 favours olaparib 300 mg bd. 
No patients in Cohort B had FANCL or RAD51C mutations.

Impact of Subsequent Olaparib 
In order to assess the impact of olaparib as a subsequent therapy in a high proportion of NHA patients, 
cross-over adjusted analyses have been performed using the pre--specified sensitivity OS analysis 
(RPSFTM). This included patients from the investigators choice of NHA arm who were eligible to receive 
olaparib (i.e., had BICR confirmed progression).  
At the DCO 20 March 2020, 56 patients (67.5%) in the NHA arm of Cohort A received olaparib as a 
subsequent therapy and 30 patients (62.5%) in the NHA arm of Cohort B received olaparib as a 
subsequent therapy. Thus, in total 86 patients (65.6%) in the NHA arm (Cohort A+B) received olaparib 
as a subsequent therapy.

Subgroup analyses according to NHA treatment 
In PROfound, there were a total of 131 patients randomised to the investigator’s choice of NHA arm and 
130 of these patients received treatment (63 abiraterone, 67 enzalutamide). Forty-seven out of the 130 
patients were in Cohort B (17 abiraterone, 30 enzalutamide). In Cohort B, the median rPFS was 
3.32 months (95% CI 1.77, 5.42) for patients on abiraterone and 3.65 months (95% CI 1.77, NC) for 
patients on enzalutamide. The rPFS HR for patients on olaparib compared to abiraterone was 0.83 (95% 
CI 0.46, 1.64) and 0.94 (95% 0.56, 1.65) for patients on enzalutamide. 
In Cohort B, the median OS for patients on abiraterone was 10.78 months (95% CI 6.93, 16.16) and 
17.02 months (95% CI 7.82, NC) for patients on enzalutamide. The OS HR for patients on olaparib 
compared to abiraterone was 0.75 (95% CI 0.38, 1.65) and 0.77 (95% 0.43, 1.48) for patients on 
enzalutamide.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The claimed indication was for Lynparza, tablet formulation, in monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and homologous recombination 
repair (HRR) gene mutations (germline and/ or somatic) who have progressed following a prior new 
hormonal agent (NHA). Patients must have confirmation of a HRR gene mutation  before Lynparza 
treatment is initiated. 
The current application is based on the results of the pivotal study PROfound. This was a Phase III, 
randomised, open-label, multicentre trial to assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib monotherapy in 
patients with mCRPC that have qualifying HRR gene mutations that were predicted to be deleterious or 
suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be detrimental/lead to loss of function) who have failed 
prior treatment with a NHA. Treatment was continued until objective radiological disease progression or 
until patients were unable to tolerate study treatment. Once patients receiving investigators choice of 
NHA were determined to have objective radiological progression by a BICR, or by investigator 
assessment if after the date of DCO for the primary analysis, they were eligible to switch to treatment 
with olaparib. This cross-over strategy may bring a confounding impact on OS and PFS2 as well as the 
safety profile. Furthermore, it should be noted that patients also had the possibility to access PARP 
inhibitor outside of this study (off-label use, other clinical trials). 
Randomization was stratified based on prior receipt of taxane chemotherapy (yes vs no) and presence of 
measurable disease at baseline (yes vs no). The stratification based on taxane chemotherapy would avoid 
heterogeneous population due to variability in the prior use of docetaxel and/or cabazitaxel as raised in 
the CHMP Scientific Advice, which was agreed. The other stratification by measurable disease was agreed 
since ORR, DoR and BoR are assessed in subset of the FAS population who had measurable disease at 
baseline. 
Patients with mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM were randomised in Cohort A (irrespective of co-
occurring mutations in one of the 12 other HRR genes), whereas patients with mutations among other 
genes involved in the HRR pathway were randomised in Cohort B. 
The MAH focused on 15 pre-specified HRR genes with a biological rationale for loss of function to predict 
sensitivity to olaparib. Between 24% to 30% of mCRPCs have loss of function mutations in genes 
involved in HRR of DNA damage response (DDR) and BRCA2 mutations are the most common mutations 
among genes involved in HR repair in advanced prostate cancer patients. Although the role of the 
selected gene mutations in the HRR pathway is acknowledged, the clinical benefit of a PARP inhibitor on 
the non-BRCA mutations remains unknown. For other HRR genes and particular mutations within those, 
there is no or only limited clinical data available to support a possible benefit of olaparib or another PARP 
inhibitor in prostate cancer patients. The applicant provided updated preclinical data on PARPi sensitivity 
for ATM, CDK12 and PPP2R2PA and literature data from additional studies in prostate cancer and other 
cancers with other PARPi (data not shown). Emerging preclinical data that became available after 
submission has shown weak evidence of PPP2R2A as an HRR gene that may confer sensitivity to a PARP 
inhibitor. Regarding ATM, the applicant provided preclinical data on ATM loss in prostate cancer cell lines

leading to sensitisation to olaparib treatments in vitro, but no in vivo pharmacological data or clinical 
evidence that could confirm the biological plausibility.   
A scientific advice (SA) was sought in July 2016 for a pivotal study targeting BRCA1/2 or ATM mutated 
mCRPC patients only. Changes in the design of the pivotal study were noted compared to the proposal in 
the CHMP SA. A double-blind design was initially planned but has been changed to an open-label study 
due to the absence of feasibility to get a matching placebo for enzalutamide. A BICR was therefore set. 
The other change to the SA was the use of the comparators enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate for 
both Cohorts A and B. The initially planned use of placebo was not endorsed and the subsequently 
proposed use of enzalutamide re-challenge was questioned at the time of SA. Since the efficacy of 
enzalutamide and abiraterone could be considered similar, the use of these two comparators was 
preferred to re-challenge with the same agent. The inclusion of patients previously treated with NHAs and 
taxanes was endorsed at the time of SA. The main efficacy endpoints have been maintained, with a 
primary endpoint of rPFS being based only on cohort A population whereas the study also aimed to assess 
the efficacy and safety of olaparib monotherapy in a broader target population (patients with mCRPC that 
have qualifying HRR gene mutations). Therefore, the design of PROfound study was considered not 
adapted to the large claimed indication encompassing patient population with alterations in any of the 15 
HRR genes. 
PROfound study included metastatic CRPC patients with HRRm, except patients with brain metastases. 
Patients with disease spread limited to regional pelvic lymph nodes or local recurrence were not eligible. 
The qualifying HRR gene mutation were to be detected in tumour tissue; no germline DNA nor ctDNA 
were used in prospective HRR testing. Patients should have progressed with prior NHA for the treatment 
of metastatic prostate cancer and/or CRPC, taking into account that abiraterone acetate is indicated in 
mCRPC and metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) whereas enzalutamide is indicated in 
non-metastatic CRPC and mCRPC. Patients having prior platinum-based chemotherapy for prostate cancer 
were excluded.  
Having a tumour qualifying mutation in one of 15 HRR genes was a requirement to entry in this study. 
The determination of the mutation status was a key component for BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM mutations 
(either as single mutations among HRR genes or concomitantly with mutations in such genes) that were 
qualifying for inclusion in Cohort A for the primary efficacy analysis. The randomisation of patients was 
based on tumour HRRm prospectively determined by an investigational HRR clinical trial assay conducted 
in CLIA laboratory at FMI based on FoundationOne CDx specifications which was not yet approved by FDA 
at the time of the initiation of the study. Patients with a prior FoundationOne test result could also be 
screened with a confirmatory CLIA HRR CTA result.    
A second screening was done on the randomised tHRRm patients for the determination of two subgroups: 
a confirmed FMI F1CDx subgroup including patients with tHRRm results from CLIA HRR CTA matching with 
FoundationOne  CDx  quality  control  criteria  and  classification  rules,  and  a  confirmed  Myriad  gBRCAm 
subgroup  including  patients  with  a  germline  BRCA1/2  mutation  based  on  the  use  of  a  retrospective 
BRCAnalysis CDx test. The other germline HRR mutations were not tested.  
The selected dose of olaparib for this study was the approved commercial tablet dose (300 mg BID) with 
the  100  mg  strength  tablet  which  is  considered  acceptable.  The  selected  doses  of  abiraterone  acetate 
(1000 mg) with 5 mg prednisone (or prednisolone) administered orally bd and enzalutamide (160 mg) were 
in line with the marketing authorisation. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  rPFS  by  BICR  in  Cohort  A.  The  choice  of  rPFS  by  BICR  as  primary  endpoint 
instead  of  OS  was  acceptable  despite  the  poor  prognosis  of  mCRPC.  As  raised  in  the  sought  CHMP  SA, 
although OS would be the preferred primary endpoint, the feasibility challenges for powering the trial in a 
relatively small biomarker-selected patient population were acknowledged, as well as the possibility to the 
patients from NHA arm to switch to olaparib that could confound OS. The assessment by BICR was also 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 107/162 
 
 
  
  
 
agreed  since  the  study  had  open-label  design.  Sensitivity  analysis  were  planned  in  the  SAP  as  follows: 
assessment of possible evaluation time bias, attrition bias, ascertainment bias (discrepancies between BICR 
and investigator’s assessment), use of unequivocal clinical progression, confirmation of bone progression 
and censoring patients with subsequent therapy. 
The comparisons between olaparib and NHA arms for all other secondary endpoints (time to first SSRE, 
DoR, time to opiate use, PSA50 response, CTC conversion rate, PFS2 and HRQoL) in this study were not 
confirmatory since no multiplicity adjustment plan was set up.  
Overall, the study primary objective reflected a study designed to evaluate efficacy of olaparib in mCRPC 
subjects with BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM mutations only. The study was designed to provide at least 95% 
power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in rPFS at a 2-sided alpha level of 5% 
assuming a true treatment effect was indicated by a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.53 in Cohort A.  
The study was planned to enrol approximately 240 patients in Cohort A and 100 patients in Cohort B. The 
number of patients enrolled in Cohort B was not driven by a formal sample size calculation but was 
determined by the enrolment period for Cohort A. Ultimately 142 patients were enrolled in Cohort B. 
Important protocol deviations (IPD) occurred more frequently in cohort B compared to cohort A, 
respectively 12.0% vs 5.3%. Nevertheless, IPD were balanced between the treatment arms in each 
cohort: 4.9% olaparib vs 6.0% NHA in cohort A, 12.8% olaparib vs 10.4% NHA in cohort B, 7.8% 
olaparib vs 7.6% NHA in cohort A+B. Considering the IPD was beyond the pre-defined 10% threshold 
regardless of the treatment arms, two relevant rPFS ‘deviation bias’ sensitivity analyses by excluding the 
patients with IPD were conducted in Cohort B and their results were consistent with the primary Cohort B 
FAS analysis (data not shown). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline data 
The median age in cohorts A+B was 69.0 years old in both arms, which is slightly younger than the 
literature observations of a median age of ≥70 years for unselected mCRPC patients who received 
enzalutamide, abiraterone or docetaxel following progression on a prior enzalutamide or abiraterone 
(Azad et al 2015, de Bono et al 2018, Khalaf et al 2018, Loriot et al 2013, Mezynski et al 2012, Vogelzang 
et al 2015). Nevertheless it is reported in the literature a relative increase in risk of prostate cancer in 
men <65 years ranges from 1.8-fold to 3.8-fold for gBRCA1m carriers (Leongamornlert et al 2012, 
Thompson and Easton 2002) and from 2.5-fold to 8.6-fold for gBRCA2m carriers (Breast Cancer Linkage 
Consortium 1999, Gallagher et al 2010, Kote-Jarai et al 2011, van Asperen et al 2005) compared to non-
carriers. More subjects ≥65 years old were randomized in NHA arm compared to olaparib arm, 
respectively 72.3% vs 66.7% in cohort A, 77.1% vs 70.2% in Cohort B and 74.0% vs 68.0% in Cohort 
A+B. 
Differences between the two arms were noticed for the median baseline PSA which was higher in NHA 
arm compared to olaparib arm (106.490 μg/L vs 68.2 μg/L respectively in cohorts A+B). The applicant 
provided the results of sensitivity analyses for rPFS (BICR) and OS to assess the impact of baseline PSA 
imbalances between the arms (data not shown). Overall, the adjusted rPFS and OS were consistent with 
the values from the primary model. Also baseline pain score was higher in NHA arm compared to olaparib 
arm. 
The histology (mostly adenocarcinoma), the ECOG PS at baseline (0-1) and total Gleason Score at 
diagnosis (7-9) were globally balanced between the treatment groups and the cohorts.  
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 108/162 
 
 
  
  
 
Median time from CRPC and mCRPC diagnosis to randomisation was similar among the olaparib arm and 
NHA arm: 24.8 months vs 23.7 months respectively for median time from CRPC to randomisation in 
cohorts A+B; 23.3 months vs 21.9 months respectively for median time from mCRPC to randomisation in 
cohort A+B. The time from randomisation to CRPC diagnosis was generally similar than time from 
randomisation to mCRPC diagnosis.  
Bone was the most common site of distant metastasis in mCRPC patients at baseline. According to the 
inclusion criteria, the patients with confirmed bone metastatic lesions were also eligible and allowed to 
continue the use of bisphosphonates or denosumab (for bone disease) before or even during the study. In 
general, the proportions of the patients with bone metastases receiving bone agents before or during the 
study were similar and their baseline characteristics were well balanced between two treatment groups 
(data not shown).The MAH provided subgroup analysis in Cohort A and Cohort A+Bby bone agents taken 
as per the eligibility criteria in the study. The subgroup analyses for rPFS (BICR) and final OS by bone 
agents taken showed for both Cohort A and Cohort A+B consistent results across subgroups regardless of 
whether or not bone agents were taken during study and/or prior to randomisation (data not shown). 
Overall, the provided results did not suggest a clinically relevant (confounding, moderating or mediating) 
role of bone agents. 
The sites of disease baseline were presented together (prostate and other metastatic locations), therefore 
the distinction between the extent of disease was unclear. Demographics and baseline characteristics 
were generally well balanced between the olaparib and comparator arms in patients with BRCA1/2 
mutations. 
Regarding the previous treatment-related disease, about two-third of randomized subjects received prior 
taxane (66.4% in olaparib arm and 64.1% in NHA arm in cohort A+B). Of those subjects, most of them 
received taxane treatment at mCRPC and were balanced between the treatment arms and cohort: in cohort 
A+B, a total of 147/256 (57.4%) subjects received taxane at mCRPC in olaparib arm and 73/131 (55.7%) 
subjects received taxane at mCRPC in NHA arm.  
Subjects received both enzalutamide and abiraterone in about 20% in olaparib arm and 17.6% in NHA 
arm in cohort A+B. The subjects receiving prior abiraterone were well balanced with patients with prior 
enzalutamide in both arms and cohorts: overall, 40.6% of patients received prior enzalutamide, 39.0% of 
patients received prior abiraterone.   
The inclusion criteria indicated that patients must have progressed on prior NHA for metastatic prostate 
cancer and/or CRPC. Most of the subjects in cohort A+B had progressed on NHA at mCRPC (98.0%), and 
most of them received at least 2 lines of treatment (58.8%). These rates were balanced between cohort 
A and cohort B and among the treatment groups. The treatment sequencing was heterogenous among 
the subjects, resulting in the absence of optimal recommended sequencing for mCRPC. The MAH 
confirmed that all subjects included in the study received and progressed on prior NHA either in the 
metastatic setting or in an earlier disease setting.   
In Cohort A+B, 35.2% patients in the olaparib arm and 63.4% patients in the investigators choice of NHA 
arm  received  subsequent  anticancer  therapies,  including  PARP  inhibitor,  hormonal  therapy/taxane 
chemotherapy. In the summary of the number of patients remaining on treatment at 6, 12, and 18 months 
after randomisation, almost half of the patients in the comparator arm switched to olaparib after the disease 
progression (data not shown).   
HRR testing results 
Of the 4047 patients that were primarily screened and tested for HRR mutations, there were 4035 patients 
who were prospectively tested using the CLIA HRR CTA, of which 31.1% (1255/4035) patients failed due 
to fail test results. Mutations detections were done on either archival tissue or de novo tissue. According to 
the  MAH,  the  reasons  of  this  fail  test  results  were  pathology  review,  DNA  extraction  and  Post  DNA 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 109/162 
 
 
  
  
 
extraction. The use of archival tumoral tissue for the mutation detection may increase the percentage of 
failure since the quantity of tissue can be low.  
Of the 2780 subjects with valid CTA results, 767 (27.6%) subjects were tested tHRRm, which was in line 
with the prevalence of the loss of function mutations in genes involved in HRR of DNA damage response 
in mCRPCs estimated between 24% to 30% (Abida et al 2017, Armenia et al 2018, Chung et al 2019, 
Mateo et al 2015, Robinson et al 2015). Overall, 387/4047 (9.5%) subjects that were tested at FMI were 
tHRRm and randomized in the study.  
Among 4047 patients with an FMI tHRR test result, 778 patients had HRRm mutations. Among these, 391 
patients screen failed for non-testing related reasons. Most of the non-testing relating reasons for screen 
fail were related to inclusion criteria not fulfilled, i.e. normal organ or bone marrow function (19.9%), 
qualifying HRR mutation in tumour tissue (9.0%) and radiographic progression at study entry while on 
ADT (7.2%). For 35 of the 391 patients having valid tHRR test result and that screen failed, the reason of 
not meeting inclusion criterion 9 (confirmation of the presence of an eligible HRR gene mutation) remains 
unknown.  
Overall the mutations in HRR were well balanced between the arms olaparib and NHA. Single BRCA2 
mutation occurred with the higher prevalence among the randomized subjects (37.5%).  
Single  ATM  and  CDK12  mutations  were  the  second  most  frequent  mutations  (24.0%  and  24.8% 
respectively), then single BRCA1 mutation (3.6%). This single mutation occurrence seems in line with the 
prevalence  from  the  literature.  In  PROfound,  28/387  (7.23%)  subjects  harboured  co-occurring  HRR 
mutations.  A comparative table of the co-occurring HRR mutations in PROfound study was provided. The 
FMI dataset used for the comparison was generated on a similar sequencing platform as PROfound at FMI 
while it would have been more adequate to compare the PROfound data with external data from literature. 
However, it is understood that it is challenging due to differences of elaboration of the datasets (different 
sequencing platforms and sample preparation, only somatic mutations reported in some datasets). Overall 
the comparison provided shows similar rate of co-occurring HRR mutation compared to patients screened 
and patients with HRRm. 
Since exploratory endpoints were added in a protocol amendment to compare the effect of olaparib vs NHA 
in subjects harbouring a qualifying mutation as detected by ctDNA analysis, the comparison of HRR gene 
mutation  status  between  tumour  DNA  and  plasma  derived  ctDNA  results  and  the  rPFS  analysis  with 
mutation identified by ctDNA were provided (data not shown). The overall percent agreements between 
the  CLIA  HRR  CTA  tissue  test  result  and  F1  Liquid  CDx  test  result  for  analysis  of  plasma  ctDNA  was 
consistent  among  the  assessed  mutations,  i.e.  for  BRCA1m,  BRCA2m  and  ATMm,  respectively  98.2%, 
93.7% and 91.3%. The rPFS by BICR for Cohort A with mutation identified by ctDNA was similar to the 
FAS.The MAH is recommended to provide updated results of the ctDNA analyses specifically for BRCA1/2 
mutations from PROfound and other studies with olaparib in prostate cancer patients (recommendation). 
Primary endpoint 
PROfound study met its primary endpoint with the demonstration of a statistically significant 
improvement in rPFS in cohort A as assessed by BICR for olaparib compared to investigators choice NHA. 
At DCO (04 June 2019), 174 progression events had occurred (71% maturity) in Cohort A with a higher 
proportion on the NHA arm than the olaparib arm (81.9% NHA vs 65.4% olaparib, respectively), 
approximately 26 months after the first patient was randomised.  
The difference in median rPFS by BIRC between olaparib vs NHA was 3.8 months in favour of olaparib 
(HR = 0.34, 95% IC 0.25-0.47, p<0.0001). The median rPFS was 7.39 months in olaparib arm vs 3.55 
months in investigators choice of NHA arm.  Progression events occurred in 65.4% of subjects in olaparib 
arm vs 81.9% of subjects in investigators choice of NHA arm. Similar rPFS results were obtained between 
the FAS and FMI F1CDx subset. Overall the sensitivity analysis of rPFS in cohort A were concordant with 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 110/162 
 
 
  
  
 
the primary analysis. However, the pre-defined potential prognostic factors did not include other 
important prognostic factors such as the previous primary malignancy(ies), previous/concurrent 
administration of bisphosphonates or denosumab, duration of previous NHA response, the previous 
treatment with both enzalutamide and abiraterone. 
Nearly 10% of enrolled patients had a secondary malignancy. In cohort A and A+B, treatment benefit 
favouring olaparib was shown in the subgroup analysis for the patients with a personal history of 
secondary malignancies, but this was not observed in cohort B. The minimum interval between previous 
other malignancies and the randomisation date varied from 2 to 4 years among some enrolled patients, 
which seems contradictory to the exclusion criteria 6 (exclusion of patients with other malignancy 5 years 
before the study enrolment).     
In the sensitivity analysis, the discordance between investigator and BICR based radiological disease 
progression was reported in nearly 14% patients of Cohort A.  
A  slight  imbalance  in  the  distribution  of  the  patients  previously  administrated  with  abiraterone  and 
enzalutamide was observed between the olaparib and the comparator arm in Cohort B and in the Myriad 
gBRCAm  subset.  In  cohort  B,  there  was  no  significant  difference  on  median  rPFS  and  OS  between  the 
abiraterone or enzalutamide-treated and olaparib-treated patients indicating the impact on clinical efficacy 
caused by the imbalanced choice of abiraterone or enzalutamide might be limited. In Myriad gBRCAm subset 
(cohort A+B), median rPFS of the olaparib treated patients was superior to that of either abiraterone or 
enzalutamide  treated  patients.  These  results  are  in  line  with  the  clinical  outcomes  from  the  primary 
analyses.    However,  there  was  no  similar  improvement  in  median  OS  observed  among  olaparib  treated 
patients in Myriad gBRCAm subset probably due to the immaturity of the OS data and some other potential 
imbalanced factors.  
In  addition,  the  applicant  also  performed  a  subgroup  analysis  on  patients  who  previously  received  both 
enzalutamide and abiraterone in case of the potential influence on the efficacy caused by the overlapping 
resistance mechanism (data not shown). Olaparib improved rPFS (BICR) and OS among mCRPC patients 
compared to investigators choice of NHA, consistently with the primary analysis results.   
Key secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoints were multiplicity controlled. There was a statistically significant improvement 
in confirmed radiological ORR by BICR for patients in Cohort A with measurable disease at baseline in the 
olaparib arm compared with the investigators choice of NHA arm (33.3% vs 2.3%), with an odds ratio of 
20.86 (95%CI 4.28-379.18, p<0.0001). Most of the subjects that reached an objective response in olaparib 
arm achieved a partial response (27 of 28 subjects). Only one subject reached an objective response in 
NHA arm (PR).  
A statistically significant improvement in rPFS by BICR in Cohort A+B was also shown in the olaparib arm 
compared with the investigators choice of NHA arm. The KM plot shows a separation of the curves in favour 
of olaparib; this separation started at approximately 2 months (coinciding with the first planned tumour 
assessment). The median rPFS was 5.82 months in olaparib arm vs 3.52 months in investigators choice 
arm, and the median progression-free interval was 2.3 months (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.38-0.63, p<0.0001). 
Results in FMI F1CDx subset were consistent with FAS. Since the median rPFS in olaparib arm was lower in 
cohort  A+B  than  in  cohort  A  only  (7.39  months)  and  taking  into  account  that  more  subjects  were 
randomized in cohort A than cohort B, it is questionable how much the results in cohorts A+B were driven 
by the rPFS in cohort A and, especially, by BRCAm patients. Moreover, results in Myriad gBRCAm subset 
showed  a  better  improvement  of  rPFS  with  olaparib  compared  to  NHA  with  a  median  progression-free 
interval of 8.25 months. 
The median TTPP based on BPI-SF worst pain [Item 3] and opiate use has not been reached in olaparib 
arm  in  cohort  A.  Nevertheless,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  delay  in  TTPP  in  the  olaparib  arm

compared with the investigators choice of NHA arm (HR: 0.44; p=0.0192). The KM plot showed a separation 
of the 2 curves at approximately 3.5 months after randomization. 
The initially submitted OS data were immature (38% mature; 93/245 events) at the time of DCO (4 June 
2019). The MAH provided the final OS analysis (DCO 20 March 2020; 60.4% mature; 148 events out of 
245 patients in Cohort A). There was a statistically significant improvement in OS in Cohort A with a HR of 
0.69 (95%CI 0.50, 0.97; p=0.0175) and a median OS improvement of 4.4 months compared to NHA. The 
OS at 12 months was 73.07% in olaparib arm vs 56.94% in NHA arm and at the time of DCO, 56.8% of 
olaparib-treated  patients  and  48.2%  of  investigators  choice  of  NHA-treated  patients  were  alive  and  in 
survival  follow-up.  The  KM  plots  showed  a  separation  of  the  curves  at  approximately  3  months  after 
randomisation.  Moreover,  approximately  80%  of  subjects  with  a  BICR  confirmed  progression  in  the 
investigators choice of NHA arm crossed-over to olaparib arm, which could lead to confounded results. A 
sensitivity analysis to adjust the impact of olaparib has been performed and the results were still in favour 
to olaparib arm with HR of 0.42 (95% CI 0.19, 0.91).  
Overall the PROfound study met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints that were multiplicity 
controlled.  
Other secondary endpoints 
The other efficacy endpoints in Cohort A, Cohort A+B and Cohort B were not adjusted for multiplicity.  
For the other efficacy endpoints in Cohort A, there was a favourable trend for olaparib compared to NHA 
except for the median duration of response (DoR) which was longer in NHA arm (7.39 months, 95% CI NC, 
NC) compared to olaparib arm (5.88 months, 95% CI 5.52, 9.03), taking into account that DoR was based 
on a single subject with a confirmed response in NHA arm. There was a favourable trend in PFS2 (assessed 
by the investigators) for the olaparib arm (median PFS2 = 17.22 months, 95% CI 12.71, 18.30) compared 
to the investigators choice of NHA arm (median PFS2 = 10.64, 95%CI 9.13, 11.24) as demonstrated by an 
improvement in median PFS 2 of 6.6 months in Cohort A, with the switch from NHA arm to olaparib that 
could have confounded the PFS 2. PSA50 results should be interpreted with caution since imbalances in PSA 
baseline were noted between the 2 arms. 
For the other efficacy endpoints in Cohort A+B, a favourable trend in efficacy endpoints was shown with 
olaparib compared to NHA. The results were consistent with the Cohort A for interim and final OS, DoR, 
time  to  opiate  use  and  CTC  conversion  but  the  efficacy  improvement  is  less  important  in  Cohort  A+B 
compared to Cohort A for rPFS, ORR, PFS2, PSA50. 
All of PRO results showed that compared with the investigator’s choice of NHA, no statistically significant 
or clinically meaningful difference or at least a favouring trend on QOL were observed after olaparib 
treatment among some HRR-mutated mCRPC patients. In most cases, the concordance of these PRO 
results between Cohort A and Cohort A+B reinforced the positive effect of the olaparib over NHAs. 
However, the results in BRCAm population is not considered robust for inclusion in the SmPC. 
Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analysis of rPFS in cohort A did not reveal an obvious differential benefit across most of the pre-
defined subgroups compared with the overall population. In Asian population rPFS was less favourable to 
olaparib compared to the White population. A larger effect in terms of rPFS was noted for olaparib compared 
to NHA in subjects with prior taxane than in subjects without prior taxane (respectively HR = 0.28 [95% 
CI 0.19, 0.41] vs HR = 0.55 [95% CI 0.32, 0.97]).  
Subgroup analysis per gene mutation were conducted in Cohort A+B, considering mutations in single gene 
and co-mutations. In patients with tBRCA2m, there was a clear improvement of rPFS for olaparib compared 
to NHA (median rPFS in olaparib 10.84 months vs 3.48 months in NHA) with a median progression-free 
interval of 7.36 months and HR = 0.21 (95% CI = 0.13, 0.32), an OS improvement with median OS of 
Assessment report

24.84 months in olaparib arm vs 15.15 months in NHA arm (HR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.37, 0.95) and an ORR 
higher in olaparib arm compared to NHA arm (respectively 55.8% vs 0).  
In BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 subgroup, there was an improvement of median rPFS with olaparib (9.79 months, 
95% CI 7.62, 11.30) compared to NHA (2.96 months, 95% CI 1.81, 3.55) with HR of 0.22 (95% CI 0.15, 
0.32). 
A numerical improvement of rPFS and OS was shown with olaparib for BRCA1 subgroup but the very low 
number of patients leads to limitation for any conclusion.  
No difference of median rPFS between olaparib (5.36 months, 95% CI 3.61, 6.21) compared to NHA (4.70 
months, 95% CI 1.84, 7.26) in ATM subgroup was shown with HR = 1.04 (95% CI 0.61-1.87) and a very 
limited improvement of median OS was observed (18.00 months in olaparib arm vs 15.57 months in NHA 
arm) with HR=0.93 (95% CI 0.53, 1.75). 
Since  BRCA2  mutation  was  the  most  frequently  reported  HRR  mutation  among  the  mCRPC  subjects 
(128/359 in single mutation and 17/28 in co-occurring mutations) and the efficacy results in this subgroup 
demonstrates a clear benefit of olaparib vs NHA, the efficacy results in Cohort A might likely be driven by 
results in BRCA2m. Although the number of patients with BRCA1 mutations was lower, based on biological 
rationale  and  overall  available  data,  results  in  patients  with  BRCA2  mutations  could  be  extrapolated  to 
patients with BRCA1 mutations. 
In  accordance  with  the  EMA  Guideline  on  the  investigation  of  subgroups  in  confirmatory  clinical  trials 
(EMA/CHMP/539146/2013),  the  inconsistency  of  BRCA1/2m  and  ATMm  subgroups  among  the  trial  was 
further discussed. In all trials investigating the effect of PARP inhibitors and exploring subsets of mutations 
possibly  predictive  of  sensitivity  to  these  drugs,  activity  and  benefit  size  were  more  pronounced  in  the 
BRCAm groups as opposed to other groups. Grouping ATMm patients with BRCAm ones and not the other 
mutations appears a posteriori questionable: outcomes in ATMm patients were similar to those observed in 
cohort B and contrast with the undisputable benefit in BRCAm patients.  
Regarding the 12 other HRR mutations from cohort B, the low number of subjects in each gene subgroup 
cannot  allow  to  draw  any  conclusion  on  a  potential  benefit  of  olaparib  compared  to  NHA.  The  CDK12 
subgroup is comparable to ATM subgroup in terms of number of subjects and efficacy results trend to a 
more favourable effect of olaparib in CDK12 compared to ATM. 
Overall, the efficacy results by gene subgroups show that BRCA2m subjects were the best responders to 
olaparib  compared  to  NHA  and  likely  drove  the  efficacy  results  among  the  Cohort  A  and  Cohort  A+B.  
Although the number of subjects in each subgroup was low, no difference in efficacy of olaparib compared 
to NHA was shown in the ATMm subgroup. Moreover the efficacy results in non-BRCAm patients showed no 
difference of olaparib arm with the comparator, i.e. for rPFS, HR = 0.94 (95%CI 0.68-1.34) with a median 
rPFS  improvement  of  1.58  months  and  for  final  OS,  HR  =  0.95  (95%CI  0.68-1.34)  with  a  median  OS 
improvement of 2.46 months. The exploratory analysis for BRCAm patients by gBRCAm vs sBRCAm showed 
that median rPFS in gBRCAm and sBRCAm were consistent in subjects with a single mutation across the 
Cohort A. A favourable trend for olaparib was shown for the other efficacy endpoints for both gBRACm and 
sBRCAm,  however  these  results  were  limited  by  the  low  number  of  subjects.  A  total  of  19  subjects 
harboured  BRCA1/2  co-occurring  mutations.  The  exclusion  of  co-occurring  mutations  from  the  efficacy 
analysis for BRCAm patients by gBRCAm vs sBRCAm was justified by the applicant to enable evaluation of 
the contribution of each individual HRR mutation to clinical outcomes, which is agreed.  
Subgroup analysis in Cohort B excluding patients with BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM mutation (a total of 4 subjects 
incorrectly  assigned  in  Cohort  B)  showed  a  rPFS  that  was  less  favourable  to  olaparib  compared  to  the 
primary analysis in Cohort B, respectively HR = 0.942 (95% CI 0.619, 1.469) vs HR = 0.88 (95%CI  0.58, 
1.36). The other efficacy results were consistent with the primary analysis of cohort B with a similar small 
numerical improvement of OS (HR=0.749, 95% CI 0.452, 1.270) and no improvement of TTPP nor ORR. 
Assessment report

The treatment benefit observed when the 4 other patients with a BRCA2 or ATM mutation were included in 
Cohort A was consistent with the primary analyses of Cohort A. The rPFS in cohort B may have been slightly 
driven by the subjects with BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM mutation.  
Supportive efficacy data was provided by Study 42, an open-label, non-randomised, non-comparative study 
assessing  efficacy  and  the  safety  of  olaparib  in  advanced  cancer  who  have  confirmed  a  genetic  BRCA1/ 
BRCA2  mutation,  including  prostate  cancer  (data  not  shown).  The  efficacy  results  are  based  on  a  low 
number  of  subjects  with  advanced  prostate  cancer  (N=8)  with  a  gBRCA  mutation,  therefore  it  remains 
challenging to interpret them for the support of an indication including a broader panel of HRR mutations. 
At the time of PROfound study initiation, only abiraterone and enzalutamide were approved among new 
hormonal  agents  (NHAs)  or  next-generation  anti-androgen  therapies.  However,  other  NHAs  have  been 
approved for the treatment of prostate cancer. Given the mechanism of action of NHAs that either block 
the biosynthesis of androgens (i.e., abiraterone) or prevent the androgens from stimulating prostate cancer 
cells by blockade to the androgen receptors on prostate cancer cells (e.g. enzalutamide), it was considered 
reasonable  to  extrapolate  the  results  obtained  with  prior  use  of  enzalutamide  to  other  medicines  of  the 
same  class  as  being  mechanistically  and  therapeutically  similar.  Patients  with  BRCAm  who  failed  either 
abiraterone or enzalutamide received appear to derive similar clinical benefit from olaparib treatment. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
PROfound study met its primary endpoint rPFS by BICR in Cohort A, which was supported by the key 
secondary endpoints (statistically improvement of confirmed ORR, TTPP and final OS in Cohort A). The 
subgroup gene analysis showed that the benefit of olaparib is higher in the subgroup with BRCA1/2 
mutations compared to the other HRR gene mutations, which may drive the efficacy in Cohort A. In 
particular, no difference in efficacy of olaparib compared to NHA was shown in the ATM subgroup. 
The efficacy results in Cohort A+B also showed an improvement of rPFS, ORR and final OS with olaparib 
but these results are likely driven by efficacy in Cohort A and especially in patients with BRCAm since the 
results in Cohort B have not demonstrated a benefit of olaparib compared to NHA.  
A benefit of olaparib compared to NHA is shown in patients with BRCA1/2m but has not been 
demonstrated in Cohort B and ATM subgroup. Moreover, the efficacy results in non-BRCAm patients 
showed no difference between olaparib arm and the comparator. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Across the entire clinical program, as of 15 June 2019, approximately 11919 patients are estimated to have 
received  treatment  with  olaparib.  The  focus  of  this  application  is  the  PROfound  study,  where  olaparib 
300 mg bd or investigators choice of NHA was given as a treatment for mCRPC patients with HRRm who 
have failed prior treatment with an NHA. 
Supportive safety data, for olaparib 300 mg bd as a monotherapy, are provided by a pool of 1585 patients 
who  were  intended  to  receive  this  dose  and  received  olaparib  in  AstraZeneca-sponsored  studies,  as 
indicated in Table 44.

All  of  the  256  patients  randomised  to  the  olaparib  arm  in  PROfound  study  received  study  treatment;  1 
patient in the investigators’ choice of NHA arm did not receive treatment. The PROfound SAS consisted of 
386 patients (256 who received olaparib and 130 who received investigators choice of NHA). 
As shown in Table 45, a higher proportion of olaparib-treated patients received treatment for a period of at 
least  3  months  compared  with  the  investigators  choice  of  NHA  arm.  The  number  of  patients  still  on 
treatment began to diverge between arms after 2 months (in favour of olaparib).

As  shown  in  Table  46,  the  median  total  treatment  duration  in  the  olaparib  arm  (7.5  months),  was 
approximately 1.9 times longer than in the investigators choice of NHA (3.9 months), consistent with the 
delayed  time  to  disease  progression  or  death.  Actual  treatment  duration  was  similar  to  total  treatment 
duration suggesting short treatment interruptions. 
Table 46: Duration of olaparib/investigators choice of NHA 
In general, toxicity observed during the course of the study could be managed by dose interruptions and 
reductions; reduction to 250 mg bd as a first step and further reduction to 200 mg bd as a second step, 
with no dose re-escalations allowed. These interruptions and reductions included single missed or forgotten 
doses. 
In both arms, AE was the most common reason for dose interruption (90 [35.2%] olaparib-treated patients 
versus  11  [8.5%]  investigators  choice  of  NHA-treated  patients),  dose  reductions  (59  [23.0%]  olaparib-
treated patients versus 6 [4.6%] investigators choice of NHA-treated patients) and dose modifications (99 
[38.7%] olaparib-treated patients versus 13 [10.0%] investigators choice of NHA-treated patients). 
Median relative dose intensity (percentage of the actual dose delivered relative to the intended dose through 
to  treatment  discontinuation)  and  percentage  intended  dose  (percentage  of  the  actual  dose  delivered 
relative to the intended dose through progression) were similar and were >98% in both treatment arms, 
suggesting  that  most  patients  were  treated  through  to  progression  and  dose  modifications  had  a  small 
impact on dose intensity. 
An assessment of mean daily dose over time throughout PROfound (Table 47) showed that the majority of 
patients  in  the  olaparib  treatment  arm  (55.8%  to  82.8%,  dependent  on  time  period)  received  between 
500 and 600 mg/day.

Overall extend of exposure: Olaparib 300 mg bd pool 
The median total treatment duration in the 300 mg bd pool was 266.0 days (approximately 8.7 months). 
Table 48: Overall extent of exposure in the 300 mg bd pool 
Demographics 
Demographic and disease characteristics of patients in PROfound are summarised in Table 16 and Table 
17. 
In  the  FAS,  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  generally  well  balanced  between  treatment 
groups, in line with expectations and representative of the proposed indication. The majority of patients 
were White, and one quarter of patients were Asian (27.1%). There were no noteworthy differences in age, 
race and ethnicity between the treatment groups. The median age of patients in PROfound (69.0 years in 
both  treatment  arms)  was  slightly  younger  than  the  median  age  of  ≥70  years  for  unselected  mCRPC 
patients  who  received  enzalutamide,  abiraterone  or  docetaxel  following  progression  on  a  prior  NHA 
(enzalutamide or abiraterone; see Azad et al 2015, de Bono et al 2018, Khalaf et al 2018, Loriot et al 2013, 
Mezynski et al 2012, Vogelzang et al 2015). 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the Myriad gBRCAm subset (n=62 patients) and the FMI 
F1CDx subset (n=376 patients) were similar to the FAS (n=387 patients). 
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
Demographic data have  not  been  pooled,  as  the  group of  studies  contributing  to the  300  mg  bd  pooled 
dataset have different patient populations of varying stages of disease. Summaries of the key demographic 
and baseline patient characteristics for the 15 studies contributing to the pooled dataset are provided in 
Table 49. The data in this table are for all patients in these studies and not just those in the olaparib 300 
mg bd tablet dose cohorts. The majority of patients in the 300 mg bd pool had either ovarian, fallopian 
tube  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  (818/1585  [51.6%]  patients),  breast  cancer  (268/1585  [16.9%] 
patients)  or  prostate  cancer  (267/1585  [16.8%]  patients).  Patients  with  other  advanced  solid  tumours, 
including colon/colorectal (n=23 patients) or pancreatic (n=103 patients) cancers were also treated in these 
studies. Patients were generally heavily pre-treated with anticancer therapies.

Adverse events 
Overview of AE 
The number and proportion of patients who had at least one AE in any category in PROfound are 
summarised in Table 50. 
Table 50: PROfound: Number (%) of patients who had at least 1 AE in any category (Cohort A+B 
SAS) 
The patients in the confirmed FMI F1CDx subset (n=375 patients) included most of the SAS dataset 
(n=386 patients). Overall the safety profile (AEs, SAEs, DAEs, Grade ≥3) was similar to the overall 
patient population. The confirmed Myriad gBRCAm subset (n=62 patients) included a smaller subset of 
the SAS dataset. Overall the safety profile (AEs, SAEs, DAEs, Grade ≥3) was similar to the overall patient 
population. In this subset analyses there were no DAEs and fatal AEs in the investigators choice of NHA 
arm, reflective of the small number of patients selected (n=19).  
AE data for the Safety Switch Analysis Set (patients randomised to the investigators choice of NHA arm 
who switched to olaparib after confirmed BICR disease progression; n=72 patients) was similar to those 
for the SAS. 
Safety profile in patients who switched to olaparib was quite similar with slightly less SAE and drug 
discontinuation as expected due to shorter time of olaparib exposure.

The most commonly reported (≥30% of patients in the olaparib arm) AEs by  system organ class (SOC) 
were: Gastrointestinal disorders (170 [66.4%] patients in the olaparib arm and 51 [39.2%] patients in the 
investigators  choice  of  NHA  arm);  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (141  [55.1%] 
patients  and  58  [44.6%]  patients,  respectively);  Blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (132  [51.6%] 
patients and 23 [17.7%] patients, respectively); Metabolism and nutrition disorders (100 [39.1%] patients 
and  37  [28.5%]  patients,  respectively);  Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (96  [37.5%] 
patients and 51 [39.2%] patients, respectively); and Infections and infestations (78 [30.5%] patients and 
32 [24.6%] patients, respectively). The proportion of patients with AEs in each of the SOCs was generally 
higher for the olaparib arm, compared with the investigators choice of NHA arm. 
The largest differences in incidence between the 2 arms were for the AEs of anaemia and nausea: anaemia 
occurred at an incidence of 46.1% in the olaparib arm vs an incidence of 15.4% in the investigators choice 
of NHA arm (a difference of 30.7%); nausea occurred at an incidence of 41.4% in the olaparib arm vs an 
incidence of 19.2% in the investigators choice of NHA arm (a difference of 22.2%). Almost all of the AEs of 
nausea were CTCAE Grade ≤2 (only 3 [1.2%] olaparib-treated patients had AEs of nausea that were CTCAE 
Grade  3);  however,  over  half  of  the  AEs  of  anaemia  were  also  CTCAE  Grade  ≤2,  55  (21.5%)  olaparib-
treated patients had AEs of anaemia that were CTCAE Grade ≥3, compared with 7 (5.4%) patients in the 
investigators choice of NHA arm. 
Pulmonary embolism was reported in 11 (4.3%) patients in the olaparib arm and 1 (0.8%) patient in the 
investigators choice NHA arm. This imbalance was smaller after adjustment for duration of exposure: 62.24 
(events  per  1000  patient-years)  and  17.88  (events  per  1000  patient-years),  respectively.  Six  (2.3%) 
patients in the olaparib arm and 1 (0.8%) patient in the investigators choice of NHA arm reported pulmonary 
embolism  Grade  ≥3.  Treatment  was  interrupted  in  2  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  and  1  patient  in  the 
investigators  choice  of  NHA  arm  and  1  AE  led  to  discontinuation  of  olaparib.  Pulmonary  embolism  was 
reported as causally related by the investigator in 2 patients (0.8%) in the olaparib arm. Eight out of 11 
patients continued olaparib at an unchanged dose. The outcome was reported as recovered in 5 patients, 
recovering in 2 patients, and not recovered in 4 patients in the olaparib arm and recovered in the 1 patient 
in the investigators choice of NHA arm with no reports of recurrence in either arm. The majority of patients 
with pulmonary embolism (9 out of 1) were 65 years or older in the olaparib arm. No difference has been 
detected in medical history between the olaparib and investigators choice NHA arms. None of the patients 
who  developed  pulmonary  embolism  had  a  history  of  venous  thromboembolic  events  and  none  of  them 
were on anticoagulation prior to the pulmonary embolism event in the olaparib arm. The time to onset of 
the events ranged between 6 and 337 days and 4 events occurred after the first 120 days of treatment in 
either  arm.  In  the  olaparib  arm,  5  patients  experienced  CTCAE  Grade  1  or  Grade  2  AEs  of  pulmonary 
embolism, suggesting that these patients were asymptomatic and did not require hospitalisation.  
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
The most common (≥30% of patients in the 300 mg bd pool) AEs consistently reported in PROfound and 
in the 300 mg bd pool were nausea, anaemia, fatigue and vomiting. In general, the most common events 
with olaparib were mild or moderate in severity and resolved on continued treatment. Table 53 shows the 
most commonly-reported AEs for the olaparib treatment arm in PROfound and the 300 mg bd pool. 
The common (≥10% in either arm) AEs that were reported at a higher incidence (≥5% difference) in the 
PROfound SAS compared with the 300 mg bd pool were: anaemia and decreased appetite. The common 
(≥10% in either arm) AEs that were reported at a lower incidence (≥5 difference) in the PROfound SAS 
compared  with  the  300  mg  bd  pool  were:  abdominal  pain,  fatigue,  headache,  nausea,  neutropenia  and 
vomiting.

Data for first onset of AEs beyond the 6 month period (reported as first onset of AEs >112 days, showed 
that  only  14  patients  (6.4%)  still  receiving  treatment  in  the  olaparib  arm,  and  5  patients  (6.3%)  still 
receiving treatment in the investigators choice of NHA arm had a first onset of any AEs in the PROfound 
study after 112 days on treatment. 
•  CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs 
AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥3 were most commonly reported in the SOC of Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
in the olaparib arm and the SOC of General disorders and administration site conditions in the investigators 
choice of NHA. The incidence of CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs in the olaparib arm was largely driven by the incidence 
of AEs of anaemia (55 of olaparib-treated patients [21.5%] had CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs of anaemia).

•  Serious adverse events 
During  PROfound,  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  reported  SAEs  in  the  olaparib  arm  compared  with  the 
investigators choice of NHA arm (Table 61). The most common SOC for reported SAEs in the olaparib arm 
was Blood and lymphatic system disorders and in the investigators choice of NHA arm was Infections and 
infestations. Most SAE preferred terms (PTs) were reported in fewer than 2 patients in each arm.  
The most commonly reported SAE (≥5%) was anaemia (22 events in 22 patients [8.6%]) in olaparib arm 
and urinary tract infection (4 events in 4 patients [3.1%]) in the investigators choice of NHA arm.  
In both the olaparib arm and the investigators choice of NHA arm, a low proportion of patients (13.7% and 
3.8%, respectively) reported SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be causally related to study 
treatment. 
The  majority  of  the  SAEs  reported  occurred  whilst  on  treatment.  A  total  of  27  patients  (10.5%)  in  the 
olaparib arm and 14 patients (10.8%) in the investigators choice of NHA arm had SAEs with a date of onset 
during the safety follow-up period. 
The majority of SAEs had resolved with either no action taken, following a temporary dose interruption or 
dose reduction, or were resolving. In total, 28 patients (10.9%) in the olaparib arm and 6 patients (4.6%) 
in the investigators choice of NHA arm had SAEs that were ‘not recovered/not resolved’ at the DCO date 
for this analysis.

Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
SAEs were reported at a higher frequency in PROfound compared with the 300 mg bd pooled dataset and 
may be explained by the differences in baseline characteristics (higher mean age, male population) in the 
PROfound study population compared with the 300 mg bd pool (see Table 62). The SOC where SAEs were 
most commonly reported was Blood and lymphatic system disorders and this was consistent for 300 mg 
bd pool data.

Anaemia 
Table 63 shows AEs of anaemia in the PROfound study and 300 mg bd pool (grouped term consisting of the 
PTs  anaemia,  anaemia  macrocytic,  erythropenia,  haematocrit  decreased,  haemoglobin  decreased, 
normochromic anaemia, normochromic normocytic anaemia, normocytic anaemia and red blood cell count 
decreased); AEs of anaemia were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm compared 
with the investigators choice of NHA arm. A higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm compared 
with the investigators choice of NHA arm had AEs that were CTCAE Grade ≥3. These events rarely led to 
permanent discontinuation of treatment. In the olaparib arm, 18 of the 55 patients with CTCAE Grade ≥3 
AEs of anaemia (single PT) were SAEs and no patient had a CTCAE Grade 4 AE. 
Olaparib treatment was interrupted in 7 of the 18 patients with CTCAE Grade ≥3 SAEs of anaemia (single 
PT), the dose was reduced in 6 of the 18 patients and the SAE led to treatment discontinuation in 4 of these 
18 patients. Nine of the 18 patients with CTCAE Grade ≥3 SAEs of anaemia had events that were reported 
as recovered.

Onset of anaemia was early, generally in the first 3 months of starting olaparib (median time to first onset 
was 1.87 months), although the risk of developing anaemia remained fairly constant throughout exposure 
with no evidence of cumulative effect. 
Overall,  44  of  119  (37.0%)  olaparib-treated  patients  had  first  events  of  anaemia  that  resolved  (median 
time to resolution 3.88 months for first event. 
Table 63: PROfound and the 300 mg pool: Patients who had at least 1 AE of anaemia (grouped 
term) reported in any category 
Treatment of anaemia 
In the olaparib arm, 72 (60.5%) of 119 patients with AEs of anaemia (grouped term) were treated for the 
AE compared with 14 (70.0%) of 20 patients in the investigators choice of NHA arm. 
In PROfound, 62 (24.2%) patients in the olaparib arm received at least 1 blood transfusion as a concomitant 
medication.  Thirteen  (5.1%)  olaparib-treated  patients  had  treatment  with  an  erythropoiesis  stimulating 
agent. 
In  PROfound,  13  (10.0%)  patients  in  the  investigators  choice  of  NHA  arm  received  at  least  1  blood 
transfusion as a concomitant medication. No investigators choice of NHA-treated patients had treatment 
with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent. 
Neutropenia 
Table 64 shows AEs of neutropenia (grouped term consisting of the PTs agranulocytosis, febrile neutropenia, 
granulocyte count decreased, granulocytopenia, idiopathic neutropenia, neutropenia, neutropenic infection, 
neutropenic  sepsis  and  neutrophil  count  decreased);  AEs  of  neutropenia  were  reported  for  a  higher 
percentage of patients in the olaparib arm compared with the investigators choice of NHA arm. These events 
were predominantly Grade ≥3 in severity and rarely led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. Three 
patients  had  AEs  of  febrile  neutropenia  and  1  patient  had  an  SAE  of  neutropenic  sepsis.  There  were  no 
patients with AEs of neutropenic infection in PROfound. 
In the olaparib arm, 4 of the 15 patients with CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs of neutropenia (grouped term) were 
SAEs. 
One patient in the olaparib arm died due to SAEs of neutropenia and lung infection. On Day 3, SAEs of lung 
infection, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were reported. The patient discontinued treatment the same 
day as onset and subsequently died on Day 9 due to the SAEs of lung infection and neutropenia. 
There  was  no  association  between  the  development  of  neutropenia  and  the  length  of  time  on  olaparib 
treatment; AEs of neutropenia (grouped term) were reported throughout the study period in the olaparib-

treated arm (median time to onset of first event was 3.27 months); the majority (19 of 24 [79.2%]) of 
first events with olaparib resolved (median time to resolution of 0.66 months for first event).

Treatment of neutropenia 
Of the patients in the olaparib arm with AEs of neutropenia (grouped term), 7 of 24 patients (29.2%) were 
treated for the AE compared with 1 of 3 patients (33.3%) in the investigators choice of NHA arm. Colony 
stimulating factor use in the olaparib arm was rare: 5 (2.0%) olaparib-treated patients received a colony 
stimulating factor. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Table  65  shows  AEs  of  thrombocytopenia  (grouped  term  consisting  of  the  PTs  platelet  count  decreased, 
platelet  production  decreased,  plateletcrit  decreased  and  thrombocytopenia).  AEs  of  thrombocytopenia 
were  reported  for  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  compared  with  the  investigators 
choice  of  NHA  arm.  Eleven  patients  (4.3%) in the olaparib  arm  had  AEs  of  thrombocytopenia  that  were 
Grade  ≥3  in  severity.  Reported  events  of  thrombocytopenia  rarely  led  to  permanent  discontinuation  of 
treatment. 
There  were  3  patients  (1.2%)  with  CTCAE  Grade  4  SAEs  and  1  patient  (0.4%)  with  a  Grade  3  SAE  of 
thrombocytopenia in the olaparib arm; no patients had SAEs of thrombocytopenia (grouped term) in the 
investigators choice of NHA arm. 
There was no association between the development of thrombocytopenia and the length of time on olaparib 
treatment.  First  onset  of  AEs  of  thrombocytopenia  (grouped  term)  were  reported  throughout  the  first 
12 months of study period in the olaparib-treated arm (median time to first onset was 2.63 months); 15 of 
31 (48.4%) olaparib-treated patients had first events of thrombocytopenia that resolved (median time to 
resolution of first event of 1.02 months.

Table 65: PROfound and the 300 mg pool: Patients who had at least 1 AE of thrombocytopenia 
(grouped term) reported in any category 
A total of 19 patients reported bleeding or haemorrhage events in PROfound. These were 14 patients (5.5%) 
in the olaparib arm (with AEs including anal haemorrhage, conjunctival haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, 
GI  haemorrhage,  gingival  bleeding,  haematotympanum,  lower  GI  haemorrhage,  petechiae  and  rectal 
haemorrhage)  and  5  patients  (3.8%)  in  the  investigators  choice  of  NHA  arm  (with  AEs  of  contusion, 
epistaxis, gastric ulcer haemorrhage, haematochezia and intracranial haemorrhage). Two patients reported 
bleeding or haemorrhage events after switching to olaparib (epistaxis and petechiae; the patient with the 
event of epistaxis had previously had an AE of epistaxis while receiving investigators choice of NHA). Two 
events  in  the  investigators  choice  of  NHA  arm  were  CTCAE  Grade  3,  the  majority  were  CTCAE  Grade  1 
events). Only 1 of these patients in the olaparib arm had a CTCAE Grade ≥3 AE of thrombocytopenia. One 
patient had a CTCAE Grade 3 AE of thrombocytopenia which started on Day 57 which led to discontinuation 
of  olaparib.  The  event  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of  his  death.  On  Day  150  the  patient  also  had  AEs  of 
haematotympanum (CTCAE Grade 2) and rectal haemorrhage (CTCAE Grade 1). 
Treatment of thrombocytopenia 
Six of 31 olaparib-treated patients (19.4%) compared with no investigators choice of NHA-treated patients 
were treated for AEs of thrombocytopenia (grouped term). 
Lymphopenia 
Table 66 shows AEs of lymphopenia (grouped term consisting of the PTs B-lymphocyte count decreased, 
lymphocyte count decreased, lymphopenia and T-lymphocyte count decreased). AEs of lymphopenia were 
reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm compared with the investigators choice of 
NHA  arm.  These  events  were  predominantly  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  and  none  led  to  permanent 
discontinuation of treatment. 
There  was  no  association  between  the  development  of  lymphopenia  and  the  length  of  time  on  olaparib 
treatment. First onset of AEs of lymphopenia (grouped term) were reported throughout the first 12 months 
of study period in the olaparib-treated arm (median time to first onset was 2.83 months); 8 of 19 (42.1%) 
olaparib-treated patients had first events of lymphopenia that resolved (median time to resolution of first 
event of 3.42 months).

Treatment of lymphopenia 
Only  1  of  the  19  olaparib-treated  patients  (5.3%)  with  lymphopenia  were  treated  for  the  AE;  no 
investigators choice of NHA-treated patients received treatment for lymphopenia (grouped term). 
Nausea and vomiting 
As shown in Table 67, AEs of nausea and vomiting were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the 
olaparib  arm  compared  with  the  investigators  choice  of  NHA  arm  in  PROfound.  These  events  were 
predominantly  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  and  rarely  led  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  treatment  in  the 
olaparib arm. Events of nausea and vomiting were generally reported early in the treatment period (median 
time to onset was 0.49 months and 0.95 months, respectively in the olaparib-treated arm. 
The majority (74 of 106 patients [69.8%] with AEs of nausea and 44 of 47 patients [93.6%] with AEs of 
vomiting) of first events with olaparib resolved (median time to resolution of first event of 1.97 months and 
0.16 months, respectively). Cumulative incidence plots for first incidence of nausea and vomiting illustrate 
first reports of nausea tended to occur early in treatment. 
Prevalence  plots  for  nausea  and  vomiting  showed  that  the  prevalence  of  nausea  events  remained  fairly 
constant (between 15% and 30% of patients affected) on olaparib treatment. The prevalence of vomiting 
was approximately 0.05% for the duration of the study. 
A total of 38 (35.8%) olaparib-treated patients reported both nausea and vomiting. Approximately half of 
the olaparib-treated patients with nausea or vomiting were treated for the AE (60 of 106 patients [56.6%] 
and 22 of 47 patients [46.8%], respectively); similar proportions of patients received treatment for nausea 
or vomiting in the investigators choice of NHA arm (15 of 25 patients [60.0%] and 7 of 16 patients [43.8%], 
respectively).

Diarrhoea 
Table 68 shows that AEs of diarrhoea (single PT) were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the 
olaparib arm compared with the investigators choice of NHA arm in the PROfound study. These events were 
predominantly Grade 1 or 2 in severity and only led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 1 patient 
in the olaparib arm. Events of diarrhea were generally reported early in the treatment period (median time 
to  onset  was  1.35  months)  and  the  majority  (44  of  54  patients  [81.5%])  of  first  events  with  olaparib 
resolved (median time to resolution of first event of 0.82 months). A higher proportion of patients in the

Increase in creatinine 
AEs of increased creatinine were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm compared 
with the investigators choice of NHA arm in the PROfound study, although overall numbers were low. These 
events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and none led to permanent discontinuation of treatment.

increased reported in any category 
In PROfound, the median change in creatinine from baseline to Week 12 for olaparib-treated patients was 
an increase of 9.0 μmol/L compared with 0 μmol/L for investigators choice of NHA-treated patients. Median 
creatinine  levels  for  olaparib-treated  patients  then  remained  consistent  over  time  (maximum  median 
change 14.0 μmol/L, median change at the majority of time points between 9.0 and 12.0 μmol/L. 
In  PROfound,  97.6%  of  olaparib-treated  patients  with  data  available  had  normal  creatinine  levels  at 
baseline, 2.0% had CTCAE Grade 1 at baseline and 0.4% of patients had CTCAE Grade ≥2 at baseline. A 
total of 188/248 (75.8%) olaparib-treated patients had a single worsening change in CTCAE Grade (most 
changes were normal to Grade 1) and 39/248 (15.7%) olaparib-treated patients had worsening 2 grade 
shifts in CTCAE Grade for creatinine (all were normal to Grade 2); 4 olaparib-treated patients had a shift 
from normal at baseline to CTCAE Grade 3 on treatment, no patients had worsening 4 grade shift. In the 
investigators choice of NHA arm of PROfound, 96.9% of patients with data available had normal creatinine 
at baseline and 3.1% had CTCAE Grade 1 at baseline; of these patients, 78/127 (61.4%) patients had a 
single  worsening  change  in  CTCAE  Grade  (most  changes  were  normal  to  Grade  1)  and  7/127  (5.5%) 
patients had worsening 2 grade shifts in CTCAE Grade (most changes were normal to Grade 2); no patients 
had more than a 2 grade shift in CTCAE Grade for creatinine. 
Data from all patients in the 300 mg bd pool showed that a similar proportion of patients in the 300 mg bd 
pool  had  CTCAE  grade  shifts  in  creatinine,  compared  with  PROfound.  In  the  300  mg  bd  pool,  92.4%  of 
olaparib-treated patients had normal creatinine at baseline, 6.9% had CTCAE Grade 1 at baseline and 0.5% 
had CTCAE Grade 2 at baseline. A total of 1205/1573 (76.6%) patients had a single change in CTCAE Grade 
(changes were normal to Grade 1 in 1165/1573 [74.1%] patients); 243/1573 (15.4%) had 2 CTCAE grade 
shifts (all were normal to Grade 2) and 7/1573 (0.4%) patients had a 3 grade shift in creatinine (all were 
Grade 0 to Grade 3. 
Dyspnoea 
Table  70  shows  that  AEs  of  dyspnoea  (grouped  term  consisting  of  the  PTs  dyspnoea  and  dyspnoea 
exertional)  were  reported  for  a  higher  percentage of  patients in  the olaparib  arm  than the  investigators 
choice of NHA arm in the PROfound study. There were few CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs or SAEs and no DAEs for 
dyspnoea (grouped term) in the PROfound study. 
AEs of dyspnoea (grouped term) were reported throughout the study period (median time to first onset 
was 1.91 months). In the majority of patients (20 of 29 [69.0%] patients) the first events of dyspnoea 
resolved (median time to resolution of first event of 2.04 months). Seven of 29 patients (24.1%) in the 
olaparib  arm  of  PROfound  were  reported  by  the  investigator  to  have  received  treatment  for  the  event, 
compared with no patients in the investigators choice of NHA arm.

Important potential risks 
MDS/AML, pneumonitis and new primary malignancies have been classified in the Risk Management Plan 
as important potential risks. Reports for events of MDS/AML and new primary malignancies continue to be 
collected beyond 30 days after the last dose of olaparib: investigators are asked during the regular follow 
up for OS if the patient had developed MDS/AML or a new primary malignancy and prompted to report any 
cases to the Sponsor. A targeted safety questionnaire was also used to collect specific follow-up information 
on these cases. 
Since  MDS/AML,  pneumonitis  and  new  primary  malignancies  occur  at  low  frequency,  to  improve  the 
sensitivity and precision of estimates to characterise these important potential risks, information has been 
drawn from larger pools of olaparib studies. For pneumonitis, in addition to cases from PROfound and the 
300 mg bd pool, cases from the 400 mg bd capsule pool were also presented (i.e., the olaparib monotherapy 
combined  therapeutic  dose  pool).  For  MDS/AML  and  new  primary  malignancies,  this  pool  was  further 
extended to include all patients who have received at least 1 dose of olaparib (tablet or capsule formulation) 
as monotherapy treatment in a monotherapy clinical study, at any dose (the olaparib monotherapy all doses 
pool). For MDS/AML and new primary malignancies, these pools are supplemented by data from the entire 
clinical programme to provide a comprehensive assessment of these risks. 
Olaparib  monotherapy  combined  therapeutic  dose  pool  (n=2351  patients)  consisted  of  all  patients  who 
have  received  olaparib  monotherapy  at  the  intended  therapeutic  dose  of  300  mg  bd  for  the  tablet 
formulation or at the therapeutic dose of 400 mg bd for the capsule formulation (as a continuous dose). All 
patients from the 300 mg bd pool were included in the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose 
pool. 
Olaparib monotherapy all doses pool (n=2783 patients) consisted of all patients who have received at least 
1 dose of olaparib as a monotherapy treatment (tablet or capsule formulation) at any dose. In addition, 
66 patients  from  Study  41  were  included  (a  Phase  II,  open-label,  randomised,  comparative,  multicentre 
study  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  olaparib  [capsule  formulation]  in  combination  with 
paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  versus  paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  alone  in  patients  with  platinum  sensitive 
advanced serous ovarian cancers). All patients from the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose 
pool were included in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool. 
The  entire  clinical  programme  as  of  15  June  2019 (n=11919  patients)  included  all the  studies  shown in 
Table 44, any studies where olaparib is given in combination with other anticancer treatments, investigator-
sponsored studies (ISSs) and data from the MAP.

In PROfound, there were no events of MDS or AML in the olaparib or investigators choice of NHA treatment 
arms, which occurred on treatment or within the 30-day follow-up.  
Table 71 shows the AEs and incidence rates of MDS/AML in PROfound, in the olaparib all doses monotherapy 
pool and across the entire olaparib clinical programme. 
Table 71: Summary of AEs of MDS/AML occurring across the olaparib program 
The incidence of events of MDS/AML in the olaparib arm of PROfound (no events) was consistent with the 
incidence for olaparib in other studies in breast cancer and pancreatic cancer (no AEs of MDS/AML were 
reported  in  the  OlympiAD  study  or  the  POLO  study)  and  lower  than  that  seen  for  olaparib  in  studies  in 
ovarian  cancer  (SOLO1  [1.9%],  SOLO2  [2.1%]  and Study  19  [1.5%])  and  the  larger  monotherapy  pool 
population for the olaparib clinical programme (0.6%).  
In the entire clinical programme pool, largely composed of ovarian and breast cancer patients, there have 
been 70 reports of MDS/AML out of a total of 11919 patients estimated to have received olaparib in the 
clinical study programme, giving an estimated cumulative incidence of 0.6% for MDS/AML. The 70 reports 
of  MDS/AML  comprise  the  30  reports  from  the  olaparib  monotherapy  all  doses  pool,  plus  reports  from 
ongoing  open  label  monotherapy  studies,  the  ongoing  MAP  program,  combination  studies  with  olaparib 
(including ISSs) and events from placebo-controlled, blinded monotherapy studies. Events in patients which 
are still on blinded treatment have been considered as olaparib cases in the calculation of incidence rates. 
Most of the 30 patients with events of MDS/AML in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool were receiving 
treatment for ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer (n=28), with 2 other events occurring in patients 
with breast cancer. Twenty-six patients had a documented BRCA mutation, 2 patients were gBRCA wildtype 
and in 2 patients, the BRCA mutation status was unknown. 
In 18 of the 30 cases of MDS/AML in the monotherapy pool a fatal outcome was reported, with MDS/AML 
noted as the primary or secondary cause of death. The duration of therapy with olaparib in patients who 
developed MDS/AML varied from <4.2 months to >4.9 years. 
The time to death after olaparib was discontinued ranged from 17 to 667 days (median 191 days). In 4 of 
the 30 cases, patients died due to other causes (progressive disease [2 patients], bone marrow transplant 
complications [1 patient], and disseminated intravascular coagulation [1 patient]). In 6 cases, MDS/AML 
was ongoing at the time of reporting and in 2 cases the outcome was reported as recovered. 
There have also been reports of MDS/AML from post marketing surveillance. 
New primary malignancy events  
In PROfound, a review of the SOC of “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and 
polyps)” showed that during treatment, 4 patients (1.6%) in the olaparib arm and 4 patients (3.1%) in the 
investigators choice of NHA arm had events in this SOC. 
The following events were excluded for the reasons described below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 139/162 
 
 
  
  
 
 
- AEs of cancer pain (1 patient in the olaparib arm) and tumour pain (1 patient in the olaparib arm and 2 
patients in the investigators choice of NHA arm) were excluded due to being pain events. 
- An AE of skin papilloma (1 patient in the olaparib arm) was excluded as it was a benign tumour. 
Therefore, there was 1 patient in the olaparib arm and 2 patients in the investigators choice of NHA arm 
with new primary malignancies.  
Table  72  shows  the  AEs  of  new  primary  malignancies  in  PROfound  compared  with  other  studies  in  the 
clinical programme, and provides incidence rates. When larger populations of olaparib-treated patients are 
considered the incidence remains below 1.5%. 
All patients in the 300 mg bd pool had other potential factors that offer alternative explanations for the 
development of the new primary tumour, such as: a history of smoking, alcohol consumption or exposure 
to strong sunlight; a documented breast cancer gene (BRCA1 or 2) mutation; a medical history of previous 
cancers;  exposure  to  previous  chemotherapy  agents  including  multiple  cycles  of  platinum  containing 
chemotherapies  that  are  known  DNA-damaging  agents  and taxanes,  anthracyclines  and  other  alkylating 
and DNA-damaging agents; and prior radiotherapy. 
Table  72:  Summary  of  AEs  of  new  primary  malignancies  occurring  across  the  olaparib 
programme 
Of the 36 AEs in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool, 12 patients had skin cancers as follows: basal 
cell carcinoma (n=6), skin cancer (n=2), malignant melanoma (n=2), 1 patient reported both a basal cell 
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and 1 patient reported squamous cell carcinoma unspecified. The 
non-skin cancer events were: breast cancers (n=9), GI cancers (n=5), thyroid cancer (n=2), plasma cell 
myeloma (n=2), lung cancer (n=2), bladder cancer, myeloma cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the oral 
cavity, lip and/or oral cavity cancer (n=1 of each). Of the 36 patients in the olaparib monotherapy all doses 
pool with new primary malignancies, 31 patients had a documented BRCA mutation, 1 patient was gBRCA 
wildtype and in 4 patients, the BRCA mutation status was unknown. 
Including  all  patients  exposed  to  olaparib  during  clinical  development  (i.e.,  including  data  from  ongoing 
studies, blinded studies, combination studies, ISS studies and the MAP) provides data for 11 919 patients 
(as of 15 June 2019). In this population, there have been 96 reports of new primary malignancies out of a 
total  of  11919  patients  estimated  to  have  received  olaparib  in  the  clinical  study  programme,  giving  an 
estimated cumulative incidence of 0.8%. There have also been reports of new primary malignancies from 
post marketing surveillance, consistent with the characterisation of the events reported from monotherapy 
clinical studies. 
Pneumonitis 
At the time of the DCO for PROfound (4 June 2019), it was reported that 5 (2.0%) patients in the olaparib 
arm and 2 (1.5%) patients in the investigators choice of NHA arm had an AE of pneumonitis on treatment 
and no patients had AEs of pneumonitis in the post-follow-up period.  
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 140/162 
 
 
  
  
 
 
The pneumonitis AEs reported with olaparib in PROfound were generally mild or moderate; 3 of the 5 AEs 
were  CTCAE  Grade  1  or  2  and  3  of  the  5  cases  were  non-serious.  In  1  olaparib-treated  patient,  the 
pneumonitis AE led to treatment discontinuation.  
Table 73 shows the rates of pneumonitis in the clinical program, and provides incidence rates. In the larger 
pool (therapeutic dose pool), the incidence of pneumonitis events was 0.9%. 
Table 73: Summary of AEs of pneumonitis occurring across the olaparib program 
Of the 20 pneumonitis AEs in the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose pool (N=2351, including 
PROfound data), 15 were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 and the remaining 5 AEs were CTCAE Grade 3. Thirteen of 
the 20 pneumonitis AEs were non-serious and 7 were SAEs. Twelve of the 20 AEs were reported to have 
recovered/resolved or recovering/resolving and the remaining 8 AEs did not resolve. In 8 of the 20 patients 
with pneumonitis AEs, treatment was continued without interruption, in a further 6 patients the dose of 
olaparib was interrupted or reduced and in the remaining 6 patients, olaparib treatment was permanently 
discontinued. 
Overall, the majority of pneumonitis AEs reported in the olaparib monotherapy therapeutic dose pool were 
mild or moderate, non-serious and resolved without treatment discontinuation. 
None of the 20 pneumonitis AEs in the pool had a fatal outcome. The MAH’s global Patient Safety database 
contains all AE reports, from spontaneous sources (e.g., healthcare professionals, Regulatory Authorities, 
literature, consumers, and others), whether or not they meet regulatory authorities’ definition of SAE, and 
reports from clinical study use that are defined as SAEs. Non-SAE reports from clinical study use are usually 
only  entered  into  the  clinical  study  database,  but  in  some  (but  not  all)  olaparib  studies,  non-serious 
pneumonitis events were also entered into the safety database. A search of the MAH safety database up to 
15 June 2019, retrieved 161 case reports; 75 case reports from clinical studies, 49 case reports from the 
post-marketing setting and the remaining 37 case reports from other solicited sources (eg, post marketing 
non-interventional studies or patient assistance programmes). Of the 75 case reports from clinical studies 
(including PROfound), 66 reported a pneumonitis SAE and 9 reported a non-serious pneumonitis event. 
Five  of  the  events  in  these  161  case  reports  had  a  fatal  outcome;  all  of  these  patients  were  receiving 
olaparib  in  combination  with other  therapies  (including  other  chemotherapies and/or  radiation)  and  2 of 
these 5 were being treated for non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, 2 events in the 86 case reports from 
the post-marketing setting and other solicited sources had a fatal outcome. One patient had a history of 
interstitial lung changes before starting olaparib therapy and was receiving concomitant simvastatin and 
had a recent cycle of carboplatin, which are potential confounders. The patient discontinued olaparib 25 
days before the onset of the event. The other patient who developed fatal pneumonitis had lung metastases, 
pleural effusion and bronchitis, requiring home oxygen use as potential confounders before starting olaparib 
treatment.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In PROfound, a higher proportion of patients had AEs that led to discontinuation of treatment (DAEs) in the 
olaparib arm, compared with the investigators choice of NHA arm (Table 74). 
The most common DAE in the olaparib arm (reported in ≥5% of patients) was anaemia, all other events 
occurred in ≤2.0% of patients. The majority of DAEs were Grade 3 and non-serious. 
Table 74: PROfound: AEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurring in >1 patient in either 
treatment group (Cohort A+B SAS) 
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
AEs leading to discontinuation of olaparib in PROfound occurred at a higher frequency compared with the 
300 mg bd pool. Table 75 summarises these data, which show that anaemia was the most common AEs 
leading to discontinuation in PROfound and the 300 mg bd pool.

Table 75: Most common AEs leading to discontinuation (reported by >1 patient in the olaparib 
treatment arm of PROfound or the 300 mg bd pool) 
•  Adverse events leading to treatment interruption 
The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  (>2  patients  in  either  treatment  group)  leading  to  interruption  of 
treatment dosing (of any duration) are presented in Table 76. AEs leading to dose interruption occurred 
more frequently in olaparib-treated patients compared with investigators choice of NHA-treated patients. 
The most common (≥5%) AEs leading to treatment interruption in the olaparib arm were: anaemia and 
Assessment report

thrombocytopenia. There were no AEs leading to treatment interruptions reported in ≥5% of patients in 
the investigators choice of NHA arm. 
Table 76: PROfound: AEs leading to treatment interruption occurring in >2 patients in either 
treatment group (Cohort A+B SAS) 
In  the  olaparib  arm,  the  median  total  treatment  duration  was  similar  to  the  actual  treatment  duration, 
which  shows  that  that  the  duration  of  any  treatment  interruptions  was  short.  The  median  time  to  first 
treatment interruption of olaparib (for any reason) was 2.3 months (range 0 to 13 months) and median 
duration of first interruption of olaparib was short (12 days [range 2 to 49 days]). 
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
The proportion of patients who had AEs leading to dose interruption was similar for PROfound (115 patients 
[44.9%]) compared with the 300 mg bd pool (630 patients [39.7%]). Anaemia, vomiting and neutropenia 
were  the  most  common  AEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  in  the  300  mg  bd  pool  and  anaemia  and 
thrombocytopenia were the most common in PROfound. 
•  Adverse events leading to dose reduction 
AEs  leading  to  dose  reduction  occurred  more  frequently  in  olaparib-treated  patients  compared  with 
investigators choice of NHA-treated patients (Table 77). The most common (≥5% of patients) AE leading 
to dose reduction in the olaparib arm was anaemia. There were no AEs leading to dose reduction reported 
in ≥5% of patients in the investigators choice of NHA arm. 
Assessment report

Page 144/162 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Table 77: PROfound: AEs leading to dose reduction (Cohort A+B SAS) 
The median time to first dose reduction of olaparib (for any reason) was 3.0 months (range 0 to 10 months). 
It should be noted that once a patient was on a reduced dose, the dose could not be re-escalated. 
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
The proportion of patients who had AEs leading to dose reduction was similar for PROfound (57 patients 
[22.3%]) and the 300 mg bd pool (339 patients [21.4%]). Anaemia was the most common AE leading to 
dose reduction in the 300 mg bd pool and PROfound. 
In PROfound study, dose reduction was more reported in olaparib group compared to NHA group (22.3% 
vs 3.8%). Anaemia was the main reason for dose modification (15.6% of cases) and the median time to 
first dose reduction of olaparib for any reason was 3.0 months. However, most patients were able to receive 
their treatment with a dose between 500 and 600mg daily (from 82.8% up to 3 months to 55.8% up to 12 
months of treatment). 
Dose reduction data in PROfound study were consistent with data from olaparib 300mb bd pool (22.3% 
21.4%). 
Laboratory findings 
•  Haematology 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 145/162 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Changes in the laboratory values for the haematology parameters of haemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets, 
lymphocytes and leukocytes are presented in Table 78.  
In PROfound, a higher proportion of patients in the olaparib arm had ≥2 grade changes in haematological 
laboratory parameters, compared with patients in the investigators choice of NHA arm. The proportion of 
patients with a maximum CTCAE Grade of 3 or 4 lymphocytes during the study was 23.1% in the olaparib 
arm and 12.9% in the investigators choice of NHA arm and for haemoglobin was 13.4% in the olaparib arm 
and 4.0% in the investigators choice of NHA arm; the proportion of patients in either treatment arm with 
a maximum CTCAE Grade of 3 or 4 for other haematological parameters was ≤5%. The frequency of CTCAE 
Grade ≥3 AEs of lymphopenia (grouped term) was 1.6% in the olaparib-treated arm whilst anaemia was 
the most frequently reported CTCAE Grade ≥3 AE, SAE and DAE. 
Table  78:  PROfound:  Number  (%)  of  patients  with  maximum  overall  CTCAE  grades  during 
treatment for key haematological parameters (Cohort A+B SAS) 
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
In general, the laboratory evaluations for PROfound and the 300 mg bd pool were comparable. Changes in 
haemoglobin, neutrophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes and platelets were the only significant haematological 
parameters  with  clinically  relevant  changes;  these  parameters  are  recognised  ADRs  for  olaparib.  The 
majority of the changes in laboratory haematological parameters on olaparib had a worst grade of CTCAE 
Grade 1 or 2; there were few patients with Grade 3 or 4 changes in these haematological parameters. 
•  Clinical chemistry 
There were no new clinical chemistry changes observed during PROfound (Table 79).  
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 146/162 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Table  79:  PROfound:  Number  (%)  of  patients  with  maximum  overall  CTCAE  grades  during 
treatment for key chemistry parameters (Cohort A+B SAS) 
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
The only significant change in clinical chemistry parameters occurred for creatinine: creatinine increases 
are a recognised ADR for olaparib and are discussed above. For PROfound, small increases were observed 
early in olaparib treatment, which then stabilised; this pattern of effect is consistent with OCT2 and MATE-
1 inhibition. 
Assessment of the potential for drug-induced liver injury 
There were no confirmed or suspected Hy’s Law cases. Although 1 patient randomised to receive olaparib 
and 1 patient who switched to olaparib after progression in PROfound had concurrent elevations of bilirubin 
and  ALT/AST,  there  were  alternative  explanations  for  the  elevated  liver  function  test  results  in  these 
patients.  
•  Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
There were no clinically relevant changes noted in vital signs or physical examination safety parameters in 
the olaparib or in the investigators choice of NHA arm, and no individual abnormalities raised any safety 
concerns.  
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
•  Effect of gender 
As all patients in the PROfound study were male, an analysis of the effects of gender has been conducted 
in the 300 mg bd pool. 
It should be noted that 256 of the 408 male patients in the 300 mg bd pool were recruited in the PROfound 
study and 52 of the 408 male patients in the 300 mg bd pool were recruited in the POLO study (pancreatic 
cancer). These 308 patients constitute nearly all of the male patients who have been recruited in Phase III 
studies with olaparib. The vast majority of the remaining 100 male patients were recruited to a variety of 
Phase  I  studies;  therefore  approximately  one  quarter  of  the  male  patients  in  the  300  mg  bd  pool  were 
treated  in  studies  that  were  generally  of  short  duration  and  conducted  early  in  the  development  of  the 
olaparib tablet formulation. In contrast, a large proportion (approximately three-quarters) of the female 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 147/162 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
patients in the 300 mg bd pool have been recruited to Phase III studies with long durations of treatment 
(eg, SOLO1 [304 patients, including the China cohort], SOLO2 [217 patients including the China cohort], 
SOLO3 [178 patients] and OlympiAD [205 patients]). 
Table 78 shows the distribution of AEs in the olaparib 300 mg bd pool by patient gender; this shows that 
the  incidence  of  AEs  in  each  category  was  generally  similar  for  male  and  female  patients  on  olaparib 
treatment. 
Table 80: 300 mg bd pool: Number (%) of patients reporting at least 1 AE by gender (SAS) 
Common (≥10% of either sex) AEs which occurred with a different frequency between male and female 
patients  on  olaparib  treatment  (a  difference  in  incidence  of  ≥5%  between  males  and  females)  were  as 
follows: 
- The only AE that occurred more frequently in male patients was: decreased appetite (27,7% vs 21,9%). 
-  AEs  that  occurred  more  frequently  in  female  patients  were:  abdominal  pain,  abdominal  pain  upper, 
diarrhoea, dizziness, dysgeusia, fatigue, headache, nausea, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection 
and vomiting. These imbalances are likely to be related to differences in the diseases under treatment; the 
majority of female patients were treated for ovarian cancer. 
An  analysis  of  AEs  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥3  by  gender  showed  that  no  CTCAE  Grade  ≥3  AEs  occurred  more 
frequently (≥5% difference between genders) in female patients compared with male patients. 
•  Effect of age 
Table 81 shows the distribution of AEs by patient age. A similar proportion of patients had AEs in all age 
categories;  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  had  SAEs  in  the  ≥85  years  age  category  compared  with  the 
other age categories; however, as there were only 6 patients in the ≥85 years age category these results 
should be interpreted with caution. A higher proportion of patients had DAEs in the 75 to 84 years and ≥85 
years age category, compared with <65 years and 65 to 74 years categories. The proportion of patients 
who were hospitalised or who had prolonged hospitalisation increased with increasing age. Seven fatal AEs 
were  reported  in  the  age  <65  years  age  category,  9  fatal  AEs  were  reported  in  the  65  to  74  years  age 
category, 3 fatal AEs were reported in the 75 to 84 years age category and none were reported in the ≥85 
years age category.

Table 81: 300 mg bd pool: Number (%) of patients reporting at least 1 AE by age group (SAS) 
For the majority of the AEs, there were no differences in frequency of AEs by PT in patients aged <65 years 
when compared with patients aged 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years and ≥85 years. Nausea and vomiting 
were the only AEs that occurred at a higher incidence (≥5% difference) in the <65 years category compared 
with 65 to 74, 75 to 84 and ≥85 years age categories. 
For  the  65  to  74  years  age  category,  AEs  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  (≥5%  difference)  when 
compared with <65 years age category was: oedema peripheral. AEs that occurred at a lower incidence 
(≥5% difference) when compared with <65 years age category were: nausea and vomiting. 
For  the  75  to  84  years  age  category,  AEs  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  (≥5%  difference)  when 
compared with <65 years were: anaemia, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, hypotension, muscular weakness, 
oedema  peripheral  and  pneumonia.  AEs  that  occurred  at  a  lower  incidence  (≥5%  difference)  when 
compared with <65 years age category were: abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, dysgeusia, headache, 
leukopenia, nasopharyngitis, nausea and vomiting. 
An analysis of AEs by the SOCs/SMQs most relevant to elderly patients, and age is provided in Table 82. 
Table  82:  300  mg  bd  pool:  Number  (%)  of  patients  with,  and  reports  of  AEs  within  the 
SOCs/SMQs of most relevance to elderly patients, by age (SAS) 
Analysis  of  AE  by  age  revealed  that  although  proportion  and  distribution  of  AE  by  SOC  were  similarly 
reported in all age categories (<65 years old, 65-74 years old, 75-84 years old ,>85 years old), seriousness 
increases  with  age  (SAE  respectively  of  20.4%,  28.1%,  33%,  66.7%)  as  well  as  discontinuation  of 
treatment due to AE (7.4%, 11.7%, 21.4%, 33.3%).

•  Effect of race 
The  safety  profile  in  the  300  mg  bd  pool  for  olaparib  in  White,  Asian  and other  non-White  patients  was 
generally  similar.  Safety  data  are  presented  for  the  371  non-White  patients  who  received  the  proposed 
dose of 300 mg bd as a monotherapy across the clinical program. 
The  majority  of  these  patients  331  (85.8%)  were  of  Asian  origin,  19  (4.9%)  patients  were  of  Black  or 
African-American origin, 9 (2.3%) were of American Indian or Alaska Native origin, 1 (0.3%) was of Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander origin and 11 (2.8%) were of other racial origin. Numbers of Asian and 
other  non-White  patients  represent  20.9%  of  patients  and  2.5%  of  patients  (331/1585  and  40/1585 
patients) in the 300 mg bd pool, respectively.  
The most common AE (≥20% patients) in the Asian patient population were: nausea, anaemia, vomiting, 
decreased appetite, fatigue and WBC count decreased. The most common (≥20% patients) in the other 
non-White  patient  population  were:  anaemia,  nausea,  diarrhoea,  fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  vomiting, 
headache and neutropenia.  
AEs that occurred at a higher incidence in Asian patients (≥5% difference) compared with White patients 
were:  ALT  increased,  anaemia,  AST  increased,  decreased  appetite,  malaise,  muscle  spasms,  neutrophil 
count decreased, platelet count decreased, upper respiratory tract infection and WBC count decreased. AEs 
that occurred at a lower incidence in Asian patients (≥5% difference) compared with White patients were: 
abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, arthralgia, asthenia, back pain, constipation, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, 
fatigue, headache, nausea, oedema peripheral and urinary tract infection. 
AEs that occurred at a higher incidence in other non-White patients (≥5% difference) compared with White 
patients  were:  anaemia,  decreased  appetite,  hyperglycaemia,  hypertension,  hypokalaemia,  leukopenia, 
neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, vertigo and WBC count decreased. AEs that occurred at a 
lower incidence in other non-White patients (≥5% difference) compared with White patients were: asthenia, 
dyspepsia, fatigue, nausea, pyrexia, rash and vomiting. 
AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥3 that occurred at a higher incidence in Asian patients (≥5% difference) compared 
with White patients were: anaemia, neutrophil count decreased and WBC count decreased. The only CTCAE 
Grade ≥3 AE that occurred at a higher incidence (≥5% difference) in other non-White patients compared 
with White patients was anaemia. 
Anaemia, neutrophil count decreased and WBC count decreased were the only AEs that resulted in a dose 
modification that occurred at a higher incidence in Asian patients (≥5% difference) compared with White 
patients. Anaemia was the only AE that resulted in a dose modification that occurred at a higher incidence 
(≥5% difference) in other non-White patients compared with White patients. 
There were no AEs leading to treatment discontinuation that occurred at a higher incidence in Asian patients 
(≥5%  difference)  compared  with  White  patients.  Anaemia  was  the  only  AE  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation that occurred at a higher incidence (≥5% difference) in other non-White patients compared 
with White patient. 
Post marketing experience 
The  capsule  formulation  of  olaparib  is  currently  approved  in  more  than  55  countries  worldwide  for  the 
treatment  of  patients  with  ovarian  cancer.  As  of  2  October  2019,  the  tablet  formulation  of  olaparib  has

more than 40 countries (including the US, EU [via the centralised procedure], Japan, Canada, Australia and 
Brazil for the maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer patients with BRCAm advanced epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-
based chemotherapy. Furthermore, as of 2 October 2019, the olaparib tablet formulation has been approved 
in  more  than  45  countries,  (including  the  US,  EU  [via  the  centralised  procedure],  Japan,  Canada  and 
Australia) for gBRCAm HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. 
The PSUR reports received did not change the benefit-risk profile of olaparib.  
Access programme and ongoing studies 
As of 15 June 2019, a total of 847 patients have been dosed with olaparib capsules or tablets in the following 
Global  Access  Programmes:  Named  Patient  Supply  Scheme,  French  Authorisation  of  Temporary  Use, 
Turkish  Compassionate  Use  Programme,  UK  Early  Access  to  Medicines  Scheme,  UK  Compassionate  Use 
Programme,  German  Compassionate  Use  Programme,  Dutch  Compassionate  Use  Programme,  and  USA 
Early Access programme. In addition, there are a number of ongoing clinical studies in which patients have 
been dosed with either olaparib tablets or a blinded comparator agent. 
Safety data from these ongoing studies are available in the PSUR. In summary, no new or important safety 
information resulting in changes to the safety profile of olaparib has been identified from the ongoing studies 
or patient access programme. No new signal emerged from last PSUR. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety assessment is mainly based on pivotal study PROfound in patients with metastatic prostate cancer 
with HRR mutation who have failed prior treatment with an NHA (abiraterone or enzalutamide depending 
on investigators choice). These data were thereafter compared with a large pool of 1585 patients which 
received the same dose of olaparib as monotherapy in other indications. This methodology is acceptable 
and available data are considered sufficient to ensure an effective analysis of the safety profile of olaparib 
in the scope of the requested indication. 
Study PROfound collected data from 386 patients (256 in olaparib arm and 130 in NHA arm). Patients were 
divided into two cohorts based on HRR gene mutation status. The MAH provided additional analysis showing 
that underlying genetic mutations do not affect the safety profile of olaparib.  
In Study PROfound, median duration of olaparib treatment was 1.9 times longer than in the NHA group 
(7.5 months vs 3.9 months) with a maximum of 692 days in olaparib group. Treatment interruptions and 
dose  reductions  were  reported  during  the  study,  mainly  due  to  AE  occurrence.  However,  considering 
comparable total and actual treatment duration of olaparib (242.8 vs 229.6 days), interruption appears to 
be short and the majority of patients were able to receive a dose between 500 and 600 mg daily (82.8% 
of patients for a period up to 3 months and 55.8% of patients for a period > 12 months of treatment). 
Overall, 20.3% of patients in the olaparib arm remained on treatment for ≥ 1 year, compared to 3.8% of 
patients in the investigators choice of NHA arm. Due to a longer exposure, exposure adjusted rates have 
been provided for AEs which is considered appropriate. 
Compared with the olaparib arm of PROfound, median treatment duration in the 300 mg bd pool was 
similar. A higher proportion (26.3%) of patients in the 300 mg bd pool had a treatment duration of 
≥ 18 months compared with 3.9% in the olaparib arm of PROfound; only 10 of the 417 patients (2.4%) 
who have received ≥18 months olaparib treatment in the 300 mg bd pool were recruited in PROfound. 
This reflects the diverse nature of patients that comprise the 300 mg bd pool, including the use of 
olaparib as first-line maintenance treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 151/162 
 
 
  
  
 
It is noted that olaparib 300mb bd pool provided supportive safety data from longer exposure to olaparib 
(> 48 months) but mainly in women with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. 
In PROfound study, patient’s demographics were consistent across treatment groups and nearly reflect the 
population of the proposed indication despite lower median age compared to mCRPC population. All patients 
were men with mean age of 69 years old and more white patients were represented. Compared to the pool 
of olaparib 300 mg bd, the population included was older in PROfound study. There is also limited experience 
in men from other clinical trials included in the pool of olaparib 300 mg bd. 
Overall, the safety profile reported in PROfound study was consistent with that observed in previous studies 
with olaparib monotherapy.  
The proportions of patients with SAEs, AEs leading to treatment (olaparib) discontinuation, CTCAE Grade 
≥3 AEs and AEs leading to death were higher in PROfound compared with the 300 mg bd pool. This might 
be  explained  by  differences  in  baseline  characteristics  such  as  higher  mean  age,  male  population  of  the 
PROfound population compared with the 300 mg bd pool, as suggested by higher rates of SAEs, including 
those with a fatal outcome also observed in the PROfound investigators choice of NHA arm, compared with 
the 300 mg bd pool. 
The majority of AEs occurred within the first 3 months of treatment. Most commonly AE reported pertained 
to the SOC Hematologic disorders (anaemia (46,1%), thrombocytopenia (8,6%), neutropenia (6,3%) and 
lymphopenia  (5,1%)),  SOC  Gastro-intestinal  disorders  (nausea  (41,4%),  decrease  appetite  (30,1%), 
diarrhoea  (21,1%),  vomiting  (18,4%),  constipation  (17,6%),  dyspepsia  (7%),  dysgueusia  (6,6%),  SOC 
General  disorders  (fatigue  (26,2%),  asthenia  (15,6%)),  SOC  respiratory  disorders  (cough  (10,9%), 
dyspnoea (10,2%)) and Nervous system disorders (dizziness (6,6%), headache (5,9%)). 
All of the AEs reported with a higher incidence of ≥5% for patients in the olaparib arm compared with the 
investigators  choice  of  NHA  were  known  ADRs  for  olaparib.  AE  were  mainly  manageable  by  treatment 
interruption or dose reduction and supportive treatment. Treatment discontinuation was reported in 18% 
of cases with anaemia as the AE responsible for most discontinuation. 
Most deaths reported in PROfound study were related to the disease under investigation. Only two fatal 
cases might be related to olaparib in patients who presented lung infection 3 and 13 days after treatment 
initiation  respectively.  In  one  of  them,  neutropenia  was  also  associated.  Appropriate  warnings  are 
mentioned in the SmPC to closely monitor haematotoxicity including neutropenia during olaparib treatment. 
Compared to olaparib pool, similar proportion of AE were reported, with slight differences such as anaemia 
and decrease appetite which were reported with a higher incidence in PROfound study (46,1% vs 39,9% 
and 30,1% vs 23,4% respectively). Slightly more SAE (35,5% vs 23%) and AE of CTACE Grade≥3 were 
also reported (50.8% vs 41.6%). Differences observed could be related to baseline characteristics (higher 
median age of patients and male population). 
Compared to investigator NHA group, proportion of AE reported was higher in olaparib group (95.3% vs 
87.7%), as well as proportion of SAE (35.5% vs 27.7%) and proportion of AE of CTCAE Grade≥3 (50.8% 
vs 37.7%). The differences between both groups were mainly driven by anaemia (46.1% in olaparib group 
vs 15.4% in NHA group) including of CTCAE Grade≥3 anaemia (21.5% vs 5.4% in NHA arm) and nausea 
(41.4% vs 19.2%). Treatment discontinuation was also more frequently observed (18% vs 8.5%). Similar 
rate of deaths was reported (3.9% vs 3.8%). 
Small  imbalances  were  noted  in  the  incidence  of  oedema  peripheral  (12.5%  in  the  olaparib  arm  versus 
7.7% in the investigators choice of NHA arm) and pulmonary embolism (4.3% in the olaparib arm versus 
0.8% in the investigators choice of NHA arm) that are not recognized as part of the known safety profile of 
olaparib. All AEs of oedema peripheral were classed as low grade (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2) and none were 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 152/162 
 
 
  
  
 
classed as serious. The exposure adjusted event rate was similar between the treatment arms and therefore 
these events are most likely due to underlying disease. 
The difference between arm in the rate of pulmonary embolism persisted but decreased after adjustment 
by treatment duration. No differences of medical history were detected between both groups. Among the 
11 patients who presented pulmonary embolism, risk factors were retrieved in 8 cases and 5 cases were 
detected  on  routine  follow-up  CT  as  incidental  finding.  Among  other  venous  thromboembolic  events 
reported, no difference was retrieved between both arms. The rate of pulmonary embolism was also higher 
compared to olaparib 300 mg bd pool (1.7%) but populations differ in terms of underlying diseases, types 
of cancer, median age, time of olaparib exposure and gender since olaparib pool mainly included women 
with ovarian and breast cancers. No imbalances in pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis events 
were observed between the olaparib and the comparator arms in individual studies.  Thus, it is considered 
plausible that the observed imbalance in incidence of pulmonary embolism between both treatment arms 
is rather a finding by chance. 
Anaemia is a known and common ADR of olaparib which has been more reported in olaparib group than in 
NHA arm in PROfound study (46,5% vs 15,4%, 119 vs 20 patients). 21,5% were CTCAE Grade≥3 and 
8.6% were serious. Anaemia occurred generally within the first 3 months of treatment but was reported 
throughout the course of treatment with no evidence of cumulative effect. Anaemia after olaparib 
treatment remained manageable and necessitated interruption (64 patients out of 119; 53,8%) or 
reduction of the olaparib dose (40 out of 119; 33,6%) or blood transfusions (62 out of 119; 52,1%) or 
erythropoiesis stimulating agent (13 out of 119; 10,9%). Treatment discontinuation was infrequently 
required (18 out of 119; 15,1%). Despite a slight increase in incidence, anaemia events in PROfound 
study are consistent with results from the olaparib 300 mg bd pool. Appropriate warnings are mentioned 
in the SmPC to prevent, monitor and minimize haematological toxicity including anaemia (baseline testing 
and monthly monitoring). 
Overall, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia events in PROfound study were also consistent with 
results from the 300 mg bd pool and already adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
Regarding  potential  risks,  no new  information  emerged  from  PROfound  study. No  case  of  MDS/AML  and 
only one case (0.4%) of new primary malignancy was reported in olaparib group. However, despite similar 
and consistent rates reported compared to olaparib entire program (0.8%) and NHA arm (1.5%), low rates 
reported make the interpretation of differences observed difficult between groups.  
The types of new primary cancers reported in the olaparib clinical trial programme were generally in line 
with  secondary  cancers  observed  in  ovarian  and  breast  cancer  populations  reported  in  the  literature 
(Bergfeldt  et  al  1995,  Fowble  et  al  2001,  Wesolowski  et  al 2007)  or  were  cancers,  such  as  skin  cancer, 
known to be the most common cancer in the general population and associated with high cure rates.  
Due to mechanism of action of olaparib which leads to accumulation of DNA damage, a contributory role of 
olaparib  in  MDS/AML  and  new  primary  malignancy  by  creating  genomic  instability  in  the  absence  of 
apoptosis  cannot  be  excluded  and  these  safety  concerns  are  included  in  the  RMP  as  potential  risks. 
Appropriate  warnings  are  mentioned  in  the  product  information  and  a  targeted  questionnaire  has  been 
implemented to better document cases reported. No new information emerged from PROfound study and 
this risk will continue to be closely monitored in post-marketing setting. 
Five  cases  of  pneumonitis  (2%)  were  reported  in  olaparib  group  in  patients  with  confounding  factors 
(previous  treatment  with  docetaxel,  presence  of  baseline  respiratory  metastases  or  concomitant  use  of 
leuprorelin). Similar incidence of pneumonitis were reported in pivotal studies SOLO1 (1.9%) and SOLO2 
(1.5%). The statement in the SmPC that “Pneumonitis, including events with a fatal outcome, has been 
reported in <1.0% of patients treated with Lynparza in clinical studies” is based on calculation of pooled 
data  from  across  the  entire  programme,  remains  valid  after  inclusion  of  the  PROfound  population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 153/162 
 
 
  
  
 
Pneumonitis is a potential risk which is adequately addressed in the product information and in the RMP. 
These events will continue to be closely monitored in post-marketing setting. 
Laboratory findings were also consistent with available data on olaparib pool. 
Safety  in  special  population  do  not  seem  to  differ  with  gender  despite  low  number  of  men  included.  In 
addition,  similar  proportion  of  AE  was  reported  among  the  different  age  population  with  an  increase  of 
seriousness and discontinuation of treatment from younger to older groups which could be explained by a 
higher median age, cancer stage and ECOG PS and different cancer types in PROfound study. Considering 
the higher number of patients over 75 years old included in the entire clinical program with PROfound study 
(>100 patients), update of SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.8 has been made to remove the reference to limited 
clinical data in patients aged 75 years and over. 
Although there appears to be some variability in the reporting of individual terms, particularly with respect 
to reporting of laboratory values as AEs, no clinically significant differences in the safety profile of olaparib 
in White versus Asian or other non-White patients have been observed and no effect of race on the PK of 
olaparib has been identified. Consistent data were reported by race but these data should be interpreted 
with caution due to over representation of White patients compared to non-White patients. 
The SmPC has been revised with updated safety data (updating frequencies of ADRs) based on pooled data 
from  2351  patients  with  solid  tumours  treated  with  olaparib  monotherapy  in  clinical  trials  at  the 
recommended dose (see also variation II/35). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of olaparib tablet formulation is well characterised, generally manageable and 
considered acceptable for the intended population. 
The  study  PROfound  provided  significant  evidence  and  results  showed  no  high  differences  in  risk  when 
compared to pooled safety data from other studies. However, the safety profile was slightly less favourable 
compared  to  treatment  with  a  new  hormonal  agent  (enzalutamide  or  abiraterone  acetate),  with  higher 
incidences of AEs of any grade, of AEs ≥ Grade 3, of SAEs, of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, of 
AEs leading to dose reduction and of AEs leading to treatment interruption. 
Patients experiencing ADRs need to be carefully followed by physicians as indicated in the SmPC and more 
data are needed to assess the causal relationship between olaparib exposure and development of important 
potential risks. These risks will continue to be closely monitored.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The purpose of the current submission was to seek marketing approval for olaparib for the following 
indication: Lynparza tablets as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer and BRCA1/2-mutations (germline and/or somatic) who have 
progressed following a prior new hormonal agent. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to ESMO guideline on cancer of the prostate (October 2015), the recommended treatment of 
CRPC are abiraterone or enzalutamide for asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic men with chemotherapy-
naïve metastatic CRPC, radium-223 for men with bone-predominant symptomatic metastatic CRPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/541236/2020 
Page 157/162 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
without visceral metastases, docetaxel  for men with metastatic CRPC and Sipuleucel-T is an option in 
asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic CRPC. 
Bone protective agents are recommended to be used in men with mCRPC to prevent fractures. 
The optimal sequence or combination of these agents (abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, docetaxel 
and Sipuleucel-T) is unknown. In practice, sequencing decisions will be made in the light of the 
distribution, extent and pace of disease, co-morbidities, patient preferences and drug availability. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main study is the PROfound study which was a Phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre trial to 
assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib monotherapy in patients with mCRPC that have qualifying HRR 
gene mutations that were predicted to be deleterious or suspected deleterious (known or predicted to be 
detrimental/lead to loss of function) who have failed prior treatment with an NHA. 
Patients with mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM were randomised in Cohort A (irrespective of co-
occurring mutations in one of the 12 other HRR genes), whereas patients with mutations among 12 
other genes involved in the HRR pathway were randomised in Cohort B. 
The primary objective was to determine the efficacy (as assessed by rPFS) of olaparib versus 
investigator choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate in subjects with mCRPC with BRCA1, BRCA2 
or ATM qualifying mutations (Cohort A). Key secondary endpoints included: Confirmed ORR by BICR 
assessment in patients with measurable disease using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG-3 (bone) 
criteria in cohort A; rPFS by BICR using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG-3 (bone) criteria in cohort 
A+B; Pain progression based on BPI-SF Item 3 “worst pain in 24 hours” and opiate analgesic use (AQA 
score) in cohort A and Overall survival in cohort A. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study was met with a statistically significative improvement of rPFS in 
Cohort A for olaparib (HR=0.34, p<0.0001) with a prolongation of the median rPFS of 3.8 months (median 
rPFs of 7.39 months in olaparib arm vs 3.55 months in NHA).  
This was supported by statistically significative improvements of confirmed ORR in Cohort A (Odds ratio = 
20.86, p<0.0001), rPFS in Cohort A+B (median rPFS prolongation of 2.3 months with HR=0.49, p<0.0001) 
and TTPP in Cohort A (HR=0.44; p=0.0192).  
A statistically significant OS benefit in olaparib-treated patients compared with investigators choice of NHA-
treated patients [60.4% maturity] was shown in Cohort A (HR=0.69, 95% CI 0.50, 0.97; p=0.0175) with 
a median OS in olaparib arm of 19.1 months vs 14.7 months in NHA arm (median OS difference of 4.4 
months). 
However, the benefit of olaparib was more pronounced in patients with a BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation, 
with  a  median  improvement  of  rPFS  of  6.83  months  (HR=0.22,  95%  CI  0.15,  0.32),  a  median  OS 
improvement of 5.67 months (HR=0.63, 95% CI 0.42, 0.95) and a rate of responders of 43.9% for olaparib 
vs 0 in the comparator arm.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no remaining uncertainties regarding the favourable effects in the patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer and BRCA1/2-mutations (germline and/or somatic) who have 
progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of olaparib is well characterised and is consistent with previous data from olaparib 
monotherapy.  Most  commonly  AE  reported  pertained  to  the  SOC  Hematologic  disorders  (anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia  and  lymphopenia),  SOC  Gastro-intestinal  disorders  (nausea,  decrease 
appetite,  diarrhoea,  vomiting),  SOC  General  disorders  (fatigue  and  asthenia),  SOC  respiratory  disorders 
(cough and dyspnoea and SOC Nervous system disorders (dizziness and headache). 
Adverse events were mainly manageable by treatment interruption (44.9%) or dose modification (22.3%) 
and supportive treatment.  
Compared  to  olaparib  300  mg  bd  pool,  higher  incidences  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥3  AEs  (50.8%  vs.  41.6%, 
respectively), of SAEs (35.5% vs. 27.7%, respectively), of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (18.0% 
vs. 9.3%, respectively), of AEs leading to dose interruption (44.9% vs. 39.7%, respectively) were noted 
which might be explained by baseline characteristics. 
Compared to the controlled group of abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment, median duration of olaparib 
treatment was 1.9 times longer. Proportion of AE reported was slightly higher in olaparib group (95.3% vs 
87.7%), as well as proportion of SAE (35.5% vs 27.7%) and proportion of AE of CTCAE Grade≥3 (50.8% 
vs  37.7%).  The  differences  between  both  groups  were  mainly  driven  by  anaemia  (46.1%  vs  15.4%) 
including CTCAE Grade≥3 anaemia (21.5% vs 5.4% in NHA arm) and nausea (41.4% vs 19.2%). Treatment 
discontinuation due to AE was also more frequently observed (18% vs 8.5%) as well as dose interruption 
(44.9% vs 18.5%) and dose reduction due to AE (22.3% vs 3.8%). Similar rate of deaths was reported 
(3.9% vs 3.8%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties  remain  on  potential  risks  of  AML/MDS,  new  primary  malignancies  and  pneumonitis.  These 
safety concerns will continue to be closely monitored in post-marketing setting. 
In addition, the safety data available are considered limited in terms of number of patients and long-term 
follow-up.  The  MAH  is  recommended  to  submit  complete  long-term  safety  data  of  the  clinical  study 
PROfound.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The pivotal study PROfound met its primary endpoint with a statistically significative improvement of rPFS 
in Cohort A, supported by the key secondary endpoints in Cohort A and Cohort A+B. However, it is 
questionable how much the results in Cohort A+B are driven by the Cohort A, and especially by BRCAm 
patients. The benefit of olaparib has not been established in Cohort B, and the efficacy results in the gene 
subgroup analysis showed no difference in rPFS between olaparib and the comparator groups and very 
limited numerical OS improvement in ATM subgroup whereas BRCA1/2 subgroup represented the best

responders to olaparib among the HRRm subjects. Moreover, the efficacy results overall in non-BRCAm 
patients showed no difference on rPFS and OS between olaparib arm and the comparator and the 
numbers of patients with alterations in particular genes are limited. Further, the available non-clinical 
data on sensitivity of tumour cells harbouring particular non-BRCA HRR gene alterations to olaparib are 
reported mainly for a gene/protein loss and do not appear to translate into clinical setting for a range of 
alterations in functionally divers proteins with potentially differential functional impact on homologous 
recombination repair pathways. Taking into account the overall available evidence on biomarkers 
conferring sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, the biology of prostate cancer and the results of the PROfound 
trial, a clinically relevant benefit can only be concluded for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations. 
Overall, olaparib was well tolerated with a manageable safety profile which is sufficiently characterised 
although data for long-term safety remain limited. While ADRs of hematologic and lymphatic system 
occurred at a high frequency, they are generally of low grade and easily manageable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A  clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  terms  of  relevant  endpoints  has  been  demonstrated  for  patients 
with BRCA1/2 mutations. 
Safety  results  of  PROfound  seem  to  be in  line  with the  safety  profile  of  olaparib  from  other  studies  and 
post-marketing information. Measures to minimize the risk are well addressed in the RMP submitted by the 
MAH. The safety profile is considered acceptable for this patient population. 
The benefit-risk balance is considered positive in patients with BRAC1/2m mCRPC. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lynparza as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer and BRCA1/2-mutations (germline and/or somatic) who have 
progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent, is positive.

patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and BRCA1/2-mutations (germline and/or 
somatic) who have progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The PL is updated 
accordingly. In addition, sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC for Lynparza hard capsules are revised 
based on updated safety data analysis and minor changes are made to section 5.3. The RMP version 20.3 
has also been accepted. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

Study OBS14697 is a non-interventional drug utilisation 
final results from category 3 study OBS14697; a 
non-interventional, retrospective drug utilisation 
study that was designed to assess in Europe the 
effectiveness of the dosing recommendation and to 
describe patterns of alirocumab utilization in real 
world clinical practice. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement editorial changes in SmPC 
and package leaflet. The submission of the study 
report addresses the Post-Authorisation Measure 
MEA/FSR 019.8. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
study to assess in Europe the effectiveness of the dosing 
recommendation included in the SmPC to avoid very low 
LDL-C levels. In the drug utilisation study, it has been 
shown that the EU SmPC was well understood and followed 
by the physicians prescribing alirocumab, and that 
compliance to the EU SmPC allowed to prevent the 
occurrence of very low LDL-C levels in most of the patients, 
while a substantial number of the patients met the 
therapeutic goal of LDL-C reduction. However, although 
adverse consequences of very low LDL-C data were not 
identified in in alirocumab studies, data on the long-term 
effects of very low levels of LDL-C are overall limited and 
the MAH was asked to retain the sentence reflecting that 
the long-term effects of sustained very low levels of LDL-C 
are unknown in the SmPC. Section 4.8. of the SmPC was 
updated to remove the increased risk of new onset of 
diabetes associated with lower levels of LDL-C.

neurocognitive function based on final results from 
the study R727-CL-1532 listed as a category 3 study 
in the RMP; this is an interventional study to 
evaluate the neurocognitive function during the 
treatment, as well as the effect of the medicinal 
product in comparison with placebo on lipoproteins 
and to assess the safety and tolerability. The RMP 
version 6.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with 
the latest QRD template version 10.2 and to update

statin with or without other lipid-lowering therapies 
or, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering 
therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for 
whom a statin is contraindicated. The final study 
report of Study EFC11570 was provided in support of 
the application; a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the effect 
of alirocumab on the occurrence of cardiovascular 
events in patients who have recently experienced an 
acute coronary syndrome. As a consequence,

results of study CHOICE I (MEA 005). 
Section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and the PL 
have also been updated to reflect the study results. 
In addition, the MAH submitted the final study report 
of study CHOICE II (MEA 009) and additional 
analysis of the two studies. 
The MAH is also taking the opportunity the update

elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
dosing regimen of 300 mg every 4 weeks as an alternative 
for the 75 mg or 150 mg dose every 2 weeks.  
To support this submission the applicant has evaluated the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of this dosing regimen in two 
exploratory phase 2 studies.  The CHMP concluded that the 
300 mg dose every 4 weeks was demonstrated to be 
generally safe and effective.  
The usual starting dose for Praluent remains 75 mg 
administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks. Patients 
requiring larger LDL-C reduction (>60%) may be started on 
150 mg once every 2 weeks, or 300 mg once every 4 
weeks (monthly), administered subcutaneously. 
The dose of Praluent can be individualised based on patient 
characteristics such as baseline LDL-C level, goal of 
therapy, and response. Lipid levels can be assessed 4 to 8 
weeks after treatment initiation or titration, and dose 
adjusted accordingly (up-titration or down-titration). If 
additional LDL-C reduction is needed in patients treated 
with 75 mg once every 2 weeks or 300 mg once every 4 
weeks (monthly), the dosage may be adjusted to the 
maximum dosage of 150 mg once every 2 weeks.

of the analysis of the efficacy endpoints beyond Week 52, 
ie, up to Week 78 (FH I, FH II, HIGH FH, and LONG TERM),

The data presented on the 5 finalised studies shows a

The additional safety data with longer exposure are

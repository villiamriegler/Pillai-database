2. Clinical studies 
10PN-PD-DIT-049;  Evaluation  of  immunological  persistence  following  3-dose  priming  with 
GSK Biologicals’ 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in study 111654 and safety and 
immunogenicity following a booster dose of the same vaccine. 
  Description 
  Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
Primary: 
To assess the antibody persistence induced by the GSK Biologicals’ 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (commercial lot versus phase III clinical lot), when co-administered with DTPa- IPV/Hib 13-16 
months  after  completion  of  the  3-dose  primary  vaccination  course  in  study  10PNPD-  DIT-048 
(111654). 
Secondary: 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine (commercial lot), 
when  co-administered  with  DTPa-IPV/Hib  at  18-21  months  of  age  in  children  primed  at  2,  3  and  5 
months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-048 (111654). 
To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  a  booster  dose  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  (commercial  lot),  when 
co-administered with DTPa-IPV/Hib at 18-21 months of age in children primed at 2, 3 and 5 months of 
age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-048 (111654). 
•  Study design 
Phase III, multicentre, open study with 2 parallel groups. The study was conducted in Singapore.

•  Study population /Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  contingent  on  the  number  of  subjects  who  received  three  doses  of 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either commercial lot or phase III clinical lot) in study 10PN-
PD-DIT-048 (111654) in Singapore. Assuming that around 20% of these subjects did not enter 
this  study,  it  could  be  considered  that  approximately  240  subjects  among  the  298  enrolled  in 
Singapore during primary vaccination study (120 in Clin-Com group and 120 subjects in Com-
Com group) received the booster dose of study vaccine. 
Considering  that  120  subjects  per  group  (240  subjects  in  total)  were  to  be  enrolled  and 
included in the Total vaccinated cohort, and up to 10% of the subjects might be excluded from 
the  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  immunogenicity,  there  were  108  evaluable  subjects  per  group 
(216 subjects in total) in the current study. 
Healthy  male  or  female,  between  and  including  18  and  21  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  the 
booster  vaccination,  who  received  three  doses  of  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  in  study 
10PN-PD-DIT-048 (111654) and for whom the investigator believes that their parents/ Legally 
acceptable  representative(s)  (LARs)  could  and  would  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the 
protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/LAR(s) of the subject. 
• 
Treatments 
The study groups were as follows: 
Clin-Com  group  (‘ClinCom’  in  result  tables  and  figures):  subjects  previously  primed  with  3 
doses  of  the  phase  III  clinical  lot  of  10Pn-PD-DiT,  co-administered  with  HRV1  and  DTPa 
combined 2 vaccines in study 10PN-PD-DIT-048 (111654) in Singapore and receiving a booster 
dose  of  the  commercial  lot  of  10Pn-PD-DiT,  co-administered  with  DTPa-IPV/Hib,  at  18-21 
months of age. 
Com-Com  group  (‘ComCom’  in  result  tables  and  figures):  subjects  previously  primed  with  3 
doses of the commercial lot of 10Pn-PD-DiT, co-administered with HRV1 and DTPa combined2 
vaccines in study 10PN-PD-DIT-048 (111654) in Singapore and receiving a booster dose of the 
commercial lot of 10Pn-PD-DiT, co-administered with DTPa-IPV/Hib, at 18-21 months of age. 
Note: 
1. HRV was given at at the first and second vaccination visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2) during 
primary vaccination course. 
2. DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib was given at the first and third vaccination visits (Visit 1 and Visit 3) and 
DTPa-IPV/Hib  was  given  at  the  second  vaccination  visit  (Visit  2),  during  primary  vaccination 
course. 
Vaccination schedule: single-dose booster vaccination at 18-21 months of age. 
Note:  Local  medically  recommended  or  required  vaccines  (for  example  hepatitis  A,  Japanese 
encephalitis,  measles-mumps-rubella,  varicella,  influenza  or  OPV  vaccines)  provided  through  the  EPI 
program  or  through  national  immunization  campaigns  were  allowed,  even  if  concomitantly 
administered with the study vaccines, but had to be documented in the eCRF. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Outcome: 
Immunogenicity: 
Evaluation  of  the  immune  responses  to  components  of  the  investigational  vaccine  before 
booster vaccination in terms of: 
Concentrations of antibodies against vaccine pneumococcal serotypes. 
Concentrations of antibodies against protein D. 
Secondary Outcomes: 
Safety and reactogenicity: 
Occurrence of each solicited adverse event (AE), within 4 days after booster vaccination. 
Local (any, grade 3) adverse events. 
General (any, grade 3, related) adverse events. 
Occurrence of unsolicited AEs within 31 days after booster vaccination. 
Occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) after booster vaccination up to study end (Visit 1 
to Visit 2).

Immunogenicity: 
Evaluation of the immune responses to components of the investigational vaccine, before and 
one month after booster vaccination in terms of: 
•  Concentrations of antibodies against vaccine pneumococcal serotypes. 
•  Concentrations of antibodies against cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 6A 
and 19A. 
•  Concentrations of antibodies against protein D. 
Note: The opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) testing was not performed as initially planned in the 
study protocol. 
Evaluation of the immune responses to components of the co-administered vaccine, before and 
one  month  after  booster  vaccination  in  terms  of:  Antibody  concentrations  against  diphtheria, 
tetanus, PRP, PT, FHA and PRN, and titres against polio type 1, 2 and 3. 
•  Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  ATP  cohort  for  persistence  for  the  analysis  of  the 
primary immunogenicity objective and on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity for the analysis of 
the  secondary  immunogenicity  objectives.  As,  in  any  group,  the  percentage  of  vaccinated 
subjects  with  serological  data  excluded  from  this  ATP  cohort  was  less  than  5%,  a  second 
analysis  based  on  the  Total  vaccinated  cohort  was  not  performed  to  complement  the  ATP 
analysis. 
Within group assessment: 
•  Geometric  mean  concentrations/titres  (GMCs/GMTs),  seropositivity/seroprotection 
rates were calculated with their 95% confidence interval (CI) for each group and each 
antigen, prior to and one month post-booster vaccination. 
•  Distribution of antibody concentrations/titres was displayed using tables and/or reverse 
cumulative  curves  for  each  group  and  each  antigen,  prior  to  and  one  month  post-
booster vaccination. 
Safety: 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  Total  vaccinated  cohort.  As,  in  any  group,  the 
percentage  of  enrolled  subjects  excluded  from  the  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  safety  was  less 
than  5%,  a  second  analysis  based  on  this  ATP  cohort  was  not  performed  to  complement  the 
Total analysis. 
Within group assessment:

• 
Incidence  of  solicited  and/or  unsolicited  local  and/or  general  AEs  during  the  31-day 
post-booster  vaccination  period  was  calculated  with  exact  95%  CI,  according  to  the 
type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination. 
Incidence of each local and each general solicited symptom reported during the 4-day 
post-booster  vaccination  period  was  calculated  with  exact  95%  CI,  according  to  the 
type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination. 
The  percentages  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  symptoms  reported  within  the  31-days 
post-booster  vaccination  period  were  summarized  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), with exact 95% CI, according to the intensity and 
relationship  to  vaccination.  The  same  tabulation  was  done  for  unsolicited  symptoms 
resulting in a medically attended visit. 
The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  who  took  concomitant  antipyretic/medication 
during the 4- day post-booster vaccination period was computed with exact 95% CI. 
SAEs,  large  swelling  reactions  and  withdrawal(s)  due  to  AE(s)/SAE(s)  reported  during  the 
entire study period were described in detail

Solicited local adverse events (Table 2): 
Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local symptoms during the 4-day post-
vaccination period in 10Pn-Hx and Hexa groups (reported following 48.9% and 31.0% of 
overall doses whatever the injection site, respectively). 
In the 10Pn-Hx group, grade 3 solicited local symptoms were reported following 0.9% 
(redness) to 6.5% (pain) of overall doses, whatever the injection site. 
In the Hexa group, grade 3 solicited local symptoms were reported following 0.3% 
(redness) to 1.0% (pain) of overall doses.

Solicited general adverse events(Table 3): 
Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general symptom in both groups 
(58.0% of doses in the 10Pn-Hx group and 40.4% doses in the Hexa group). 
In the 10Pn-Hx group, the incidence of grade 3 solicited general symptoms ranged from 
0.0% to 1.9% (irritability). Out of these, all except one were considered by the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination (1.7%). 
In the Hexa group, the incidence of grade 3 solicited general symptoms ranged from 
0.0% to 0.3%. 
There was one report of grade 3 fever (axillary temperature > 39.5°C) during the 4-day 
post dose 3 vaccination period and was considered by the investigator to be causally 
related to vaccination.

Unsolicited adverse events: 
Unsolicited adverse events were reported following 12.3% and 14.8% of administered doses in the 
10Pn-Hx and Hexa groups, respectively.

Grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported for a maximum of 0.3% of doses in the two study 
groups. None of the grade 3 adverse events was assessed by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination. 
Serious adverse events: 
At least one SAE was reported by 15 subjects (9/199 subjects in the 10Pn-Hx group and 6/99 subjects 
in the Hexa group) during this study. 
Among these SAEs, none was assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. No 
fatal SAEs were reported during the entire study period. 
Assessor’s comment: There was an increase in reactogenicity when Synflorix was co-administered with 
Infanrix hexa, which has also been reported from previous studies. No further regulatory action is 
required based on these results.  
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
In both submitted studies Synflorix was given in accordance with the EU approved dosing schedule. 
The results were also in line with the previously submitted studies, and no further regulatory action is 
considered necessary. 
III. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
This article 46 submission is considered satisfactory and no further regulatory action is required.  
  Recommendation

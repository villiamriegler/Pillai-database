2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune, debilitating neurodegenerative 
disorder  with  multifocal  demyelination  affecting  the  brain,  optic  nerves  and  spinal  cord.  This 
process  leads  to  dysfunctions  of  the  Central  Nervous  System  (CNS)  manifesting  in  various 
symptoms and frequently leading to severe disability. Its prevalence rate varies between races 
and  geographical  latitude,  ranging  from  more  than  100  per  100,000  in  Northern  and  Central 
Europe to 50 per 100,000 in Southern Europe. 
The pathogenesis of MS remains unknown. It is generally assumed that MS is mediated by an 
autoimmune process possibly triggered by infection based on a genetic predisposition.  
MS may manifest in relapsing and progressive forms. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) accounts 
for  about  85%  of  MS  cases.  RRMS  is  characterised  by  unpredictable  acute  episodes  of 
neurological dysfunction, followed by variable recovery and periods of clinical stability. Within 
10 years of disease onset more than 50% of patients develop sustained deterioration with or 
without relapses i.e. secondary progressive variety of MS (SPMS). However, about 10-15% of 
patients develop a sustained deterioration of their neurological function from the beginning i.e. 
primary  progressive  MS  (PPMS).  The  course  of  MS  can  also  be  benign  i.e.  RRMS  with  few 
relapses and no significant disability after several years or malignant i.e. leading to significant 
disability in a few years after the onset.  
Relapses  are  considered  the  clinical  expression  of  acute  inflammatory  focal  lesions  in  e.g. 
spinal  cord,  optic  nerve  or  brainstem,  whereas  progression  is  considered  to  reflect  an 
increasing  degree  of  demyelination,  axonal  loss  and  gliosis.  RRMS  and  SPMS  are  probably 
different  stages  of  the  same  disease  where  the  relative  contribution  of  the  active 
immunological aspect and a degenerative aspect changes.  
Current  therapeutic  approaches  include  symptomatic  treatment,  treatment  of  acute  relapses 
with  corticosteroids,  disease  modifying  treatment  with  immunomodulators  e.g.  glatiramer 
acetate,  beta-interferons,  natalizumab, 
fingolimod,  dimethyl 
fumarate,  alemtuzumab, 
teriflunomide or immunosuppressant/cytotoxic agents. 
Plegridy  contains  the  active  substance  peginterferon  beta-1a,  which  is  a  polyethylene  glycol 
(PEG)-conjugated form of glycosylated, recombinant interferon beta-1a modified with a single, 
linear molecule of 20 kDa mPEG-O-2-methylpropionaldehyde (mPEG). The proposed product is 
a pre-filled syringe or a pre-filled pen containing up to 125 µg of peginterferon beta-1a. After 
an  initial  titration  with  63  and  94 µg/ml  solutions,  the  maintenance  dose  is  125 µg  to  be 
administered subcutaneously every other week.  
Interferon betas are cytokines with immunomodulatory activity and represent established first 
line  therapies  in  multiple  sclerosis.  The  biological  effects  of  interferon  betas  include  up-
regulation  of  anti-inflammatory  cytokines  [e.g.  Interleukin-4  (IL-4),  IL-10,  IL-27],  down-
regulation  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  (e.g.  IL-2,  IL-12,  IFN-γ,  TNF-α)  and  inhibiting  the 
migration of activated T cells across the blood brain barrier. Whether these effects mediate the 
mechanism of action of interferon beta is unclear as the pathogenesis of MS remains unclear. 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 10/98 
 
  
  
Several products containing interferon beta were already approved in the European Union (EU) 
for MS treatment at the time of this report, including two interferon beta-1a products (Avonex 
and  Rebif)  and  two  products  containing  interferon  beta-1b  (Extavia  and  Betaferon).  The 
currently available interferon beta therapies require either intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous 
(SC) injections, administered once a week (interferon beta-1a IM), to as many as 3 to 4 times 
a  week  (interferon  beta-1a  SC,  interferon  beta-1b  SC).  In  Plegridy,  pegylation  at  the 
N-terminal alpha amino group of the interferon beta-1a protein was performed, as pegylation 
protects  against  enzymatic  degradation  and  other  clearance  mechanisms  and  therefore 
prolongs the half-life compared to unmodified substances. 
Pegylation can be considered a well-established modification to reduce the frequency of dosing 
while maintaining safety and efficacy of an active substance. It has been used in a number of 
protein  products  centrally  approved  across  the  EU  including  two  interferon  alpha  products 
(Pegasys and PegIntron) approved for the treatment of hepatitis.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Peginterferon  beta-1a  (pegIFN  ß-1a)  is  a  pegylated  form  of  interferon  beta-1a  (IFN  β-1a). 
Peginterferon beta-1a is presented as a solution for subcutaneous injection, supplied either as 
pre-filled  syringe  (PFS)  or  pre-filled  pen  (PFP).  For  both  PFS  and  PFP,  three  strengths  are 
available:  two  titration  doses  (63  and  94  microgram)  and  one  administration  dose  of  125 
microgram,  per  0.5  mL  of  solution.  The  dose indicates  the  quantity of  the  interferon  beta-1a 
moiety of peginterferon beta-1a without consideration of the PEG moiety attached. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Peginterferon  beta-1a  is  a  glycosylated  recombinant  interferon  beta-1a  (IFN  β-1a)  that  is 
pegylated  with  a  single  20kDa  methoxypoly  (ethyleneglycol)-O-2  methylpropionaldehyde 
(mPEG)  moiety  at  the  N-terminus.  IFN-β-1a  is  a  166  amino  acid  glycoprotein.  The  Mw  of 
mPEGIFN-β-1a is approximately 44 ± 2 kDa as predicted from the amino acid sequence, and 
the masses of the attached poly(ethyleneglycol) and carbohydrate chains. 
Manufacture 
The peginterferon beta-1a active substance is manufactured by Biogen Idec Inc. in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, US.  
Origin, source, and history of the cells, characterisation and testing 
A two-tiered cell bank system consisting of a Master Cell Bank (MCB) and a Working Cell Bank 
(WCB) was established.  
In  addition,  an  Extended  End  of  Production  Cell  Bank  (EEPCB)  was  prepared  to  establish  the 
limit  of  in  vitro  cell  age  for  cell  line  identity,  safety,  and  purity  testing.  The  cell  banks  were 
tested  and  released  accordingly  to  the  specifications  demonstrating  identity,  purity  and 
suitability of all the three cell banks. 
The  MCB  and  WCB  were  tested  for  adventitious  agents  and  identity  by  isoenzyme  analysis. 
Additionally,  genetic  characterisation  was  performed.  MCB  and  WCB  are  stored  in  the  vapour 
phase of liquid nitrogen. The genetic characterisation of the MCB and EEPCB demonstrates that 
the cells are genetically stable up to the proposed limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA).  
Manufacturing process 
The  manufacturing  process  is  comprised  of  cell  culture  expansion,  a  production  bioreactor, 
clarification of the cell culture fluid, and purification resulting in highly purified interferon beta-
1a.  The  purified  interferon  beta-1a  is  then  pegylated  by  reaction  with  20  kDa  mPEG-O-2-
methylpropionaldehyde  and  further  purified  resulting  in  the  peginterferon  beta-1a  active 
substance.

EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 12/98 
 
  
  
 
All  process  steps  and  material  controls  are  well  described.  The  process  control  strategy  is 
presented  in  detail  and  key  and  critical  controlled  parameters,  in-process  controls  and  in-
process tests have been provided.  
Control of Materials 
All  raw  materials  are  approved  for  use  on  the  basis  of  specified  testing  and  a  manufacturer’s 
certificate of analysis and origin, as applicable. Non-compendial materials are also qualified with 
testing  requirements  developed  by  Biogen  Idec.  No  raw  materials  of  direct  animal  origin  are 
used in either the working cell bank or the pegIFN β-1a manufacturing processes.  
A comprehensive risk management plan and control strategy has been implemented in line with 
the requirements for starting materials (ICH Q11). 
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
The  control  strategy  is  based  on  comprehensive  risk  assessments  to  identify  critical  quality 
attributes  (CQAs),  raw  materials  and  process  parameters  impacting  on  CQAs  of  the  active 
substance  process  performance.  The  applicant  proposes  a  three-tiered  approach  including 
critical, key and non-key controlled process parameters. The classification of the parameters is 
performed based on the impact of process parameters at each step on CQAs (=> critical) and 
process performance (=> key). Non-key parameters are assumed to impact neither CQAs nor 
process performance.  
Process validation 
The validation runs were well within the pre-defined acceptance criteria. Besides the in-process 
controls  and  critical 
in-process  controls, 
in-process  measurements  were  conducted 
demonstrating  that  the  process  performs  consistently.  The  hold  times  of  media,  buffer  and 
intermediates  as  well  as  shipping  conditions  have  been  provided.  The 
lifetime  of 
chromatography  columns  is  prospectively  set  based  on  small  scale  studies  and  a  protocol  to 
further confirm these on full scale manufacturing conditions is set.  
The  information  on  the  analytical  methods  used  for  the  depletion/clearance  process  validation 
studies  is  considered  acceptable.  Input  variables  that  control  the  process  were  initially  tested 
during  screening  studies  and  those  variables  shown  to  control  the  process  (greatest  effect  on 
critical  quality  attributes  and/or  process  consistency)  were  later  taken  into  modelling  studies. 
These  process  characterisation  studies  were  designed  to  evaluate  the  highest  risk  input 
parameters  using  a  multifactorial  design  of  experiments  (DoE)  approach.  The  deduced  normal 
operating ranges (NOR) are well within the ranges tested. 
Characterisation 
The  active  substance  was  sufficiently  characterized  by  state  of  the  art  spectroscopic  and 
chromatographic techniques.  
The  structural  characterisation  and  elucidation  of  physico-chemical  properties  using  adequate 
analytical  methods  presented  in  the  application  have  confirmed  that  the  structure  and 
properties  of  peginterferon  beta-1a  active  substance  produced  by  Biogen  Idec  Inc.  have 
identical features to interferon beta-1a pegylated at the N-terminus.

EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 13/98 
 
  
  
Specification 
The  active  substance  release  and  stability  specification  comprises  testing  of  identity,  activity, 
quantity, purity, impurities and other general tests.  
The  specification  is  based  on  batch  release  data,  stability  data,  clinical  batch  data  and 
developmental studies. In addition, product and process risk assessments were conducted and 
a  testing  strategy  was  developed  to  ensure  that  the  critical  quality  attributes  are  controlled. 
Acceptance  limits  were  also  set  based  on  criticality  of  the  attribute  for  pegIFN  ß-1a  safety 
and/or efficacy; manufacturing capability and variability; and analytical test method capability.  
During  the  evaluation  procedure,  the  specifications  for  the  active  substance  have  been 
amended or further justification has been provided.  
Analytical Methods 
In  general,  the  description  of  the  analytical  methods  is  considered  sufficient.  Non-compendial 
tests  have  been  validated.  The  information  provided  on  batch  analyses  as  well  as  on  the 
justification of specification is considered acceptable.  
Reference Material 
Sufficient information on the primary reference standard and on the selection and qualification 
of future working standards has been provided.  
Stability 
Sufficient stability data have been provided and no adverse stability trends have been observed 
at  the  long-term  or  accelerated  storage  conditions.  In  summary,  based  on  the  available  data 
the proposed shelf life is considered appropriate. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The  finished  product  is  supplied  as  a  sterile,  liquid  formulation  in  a  pre-filled  syringe  for 
subcutaneous  injection.  The  finished  product  has  three  different  fixed  dosage  strengths  and 
each  is  filled  into  the  Pre-filled  Syringe  at  a  nominal  volume  of  0.5  mL.  The  63  and  94  µg 
strengths are for initial dose titration and the 125 µg strength is the administration dose.  
In addition to the pre-filled syringe, a single-use, disposable, spring-powered pre-filled pen will 
be available for patients.  
The  excipients  of  the  finished  product  are  sodium  acetate  trihydrate,  acetic  acid,  L-Arginine

Pharmaceutical Development 
The  development  of  the  Phase  1  finished  product  formulation  was  initiated  with  the  same 
composition  as  the  Avonex  formulation.  The  pH  range  and  osmolality  of  the  formulation  was 
suitable for subcutaneous use, the intended route of administration for Plegridy. 
To evaluate the robustness of the finished product formulation, a partial factorial experimental 
design  study  was  performed.  Overall,  these  data  demonstrated  that  the  finished  product 
manufacturing  process  is  robust  and  able  to  remain  within  stability  acceptance  limits  even  if 
manufacturing variations in the formulation composition occur.  
Manufacture of the product 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  comprises  formulation  steps,  filtration,  aseptic 
syringe filling, and assembly of pre-filled pen.  
Process  consistency  validation  of  the  finished  product  process  was  demonstrated.  The  overall 
control strategy applied, taking risk management/mitigation measures into account, is deemed 
acceptable. 
All the excipients used in the manufacture of the finished product are of appropriate compendial 
grade  (USP,  Ph.  Eur,  and/or  JP).  No  excipients  of  human  or  animal  origin  are  used  for  the 
manufacture  of  the  finished  product.  No  novel  or  non-novel,  non-compendial  excipients  are 
used in the manufacture of Plegridy finished product. 
Product specification 
The  pegIFN-β-1a  finished  product  specifications  were  developed  in  line  with  the  ICH  Q6B 
guideline:  “Specifications  -  Test  Procedures  and  Acceptance  Criteria  for  Biotechnological  / 
Biological Products.” The  proposed release and stability specifications for pegIFN-β-1a finished 
product provide assurance of product quality of each finished product lot at release and over its 
shelf-life.  
As a basis for establishing the commercial release specifications, a product risk assessment was 
conducted  and  a  testing  strategy  was  developed.  The  risk  assessment  was  conducted  as  per 
internal guidelines. 
The  approach  for  CQA  classification  based  on  risk  assessment  using  impact  and  uncertainty 
score  and  calculated  risk  priority  number  is  deemed  acceptable.  However,  the  approach  for 
setting specification acceptance criteria based on already too wide acceptance criteria for active 
substance  was  not  accepted.  During  the  initial  evaluation  the  Applicant  has  revised  the 
specifications or has further provided adequate justification.  
Batch analysis results are presented for both the pre-filled syringe component and the final pre-
filled pen. A summary of the lots, their manufacturing history and purpose is provided as well 
as  release  test  results  of  clinical  lots  and  process  validation  lots.  All  results  met  the  release 
specifications,  demonstrating  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  under  control  to  produce 
pegIFN-β-1a batches of the intended quality.

Container Closure System 
The finished product is a sterile, liquid formulation filled in a 1 mL syringe. A pre-filled syringe 
is  contained  within  a  single-use,  disposable,  spring-powered  pen  injector  called  Plegridy  Pen. 
The syringe inside the pen is a 1 mL pre-filled syringe made of glass (Type I) with a bromobutyl 
rubber  stopper  and  thermoplastic  and  polypropylene  rigid  needle  shield  (RNS),  containing 
0.5 mL of solution.  
Stability of the product 
A 2 years shelf life is proposed for pegIFN-β-1a finished product at all strengths (63 μg/syringe, 
94 μg/syringe, and 125 μg/syringe) when stored at 2oC to 8oC, with an allowance of storage for 
up to 30 days at room temperature (2oC to 25oC), protected from light, within the 2 years shelf 
life.  
The  cGMP  finished  product  stability  studies  were  designed  in  accordance  with  ICH  guidelines 
Q1A  (R2),  Stability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products  and  Q5C,  Quality  of 
Biotechnological Products: Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products.  
Results  from  stability  studies  have  been  provided  for  the  pre-filled  syringes  under  long-term 
storage  conditions  and  accelerated  conditions.  Furthermore,  stability  studies  have  been 
performed  with  the  pre-filled  pen  under  long-term  storage  conditions  and  accelerated 
conditions  in  accordance  with  ICH  guidelines.  A  post-approval  stability  protocol  and  stability 
commitment have been provided.   
As  PegIFN-β-1a  finished  product  was  shown  to  be  sensitive  to  light,  a  storage  condition  of  
‘Store  in  the  original  package  in  order  to  protect  from  light’  has  been  included  in  the  product 
information.  
Additional  stability  studies  were  conducted  to  support  an  additional  storage.  The  study  results 
confirm  that  these  specified  times  do  not  adversely  change  pegIFN  beta-1a  finished  product 
quality. 
Based on the data provided, a shelf life of 2 years at 2oC to 8oC, with an allowance of storage 
for up to 30 days at room temperature (2oC to 25oC), protected from light, within the 2 years 
shelf  life  for  the  finished  product  is  considered  acceptable.  If  Plegridy  is  at  room  temperature 
for  a  total  of  30 days,  it  should  be  used  or  discarded.  If  it  is  not  clear  if  Plegridy  has  been 
stored at room temperature 30 days or more, it should be discarded. 
Adventitious agents  
The virus safety of Plegridy is controlled by a complementary strategy comprising testing of cell 
banks,  raw  materials  and  the  unprocessed  bulk  harvest  for  adventitious/endogenous  agents 
and validation of the virus removal/inactivation capacity of the manufacturing process. Process 
steps  have  been  investigated  in  virus  validations  studies  and  indicate  that  the  process  is 
capable of adequate virus removal/inactivation.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
The  information  provided gives  a  clear  overview  of development,  and  production  of  the active 
substance.  In  general  the  information  is  well  presented  and  state-of-the-art.  However,  two 
major objections have been raised during the initial MA application regarding the control of the 
purified interferon beta protein prior pegylation and the lack of sufficiently detailed information 
on the analytical procedures which have been satisfactorily addressed. 
The genetic characterisation of the MCB and EEPCB demonstrated that the cells are genetically 
stable  up  to  the  proposed  limit  of  in  vitro  cell  age  (LIVCA).  Data  regarding  the  viable  cell 
density  and  cell  viability  at  harvest  and  beyond  the  proposed  LIVCA  has  been  provided  and 
substantiated the proposed LIVCA, as viable cell density and cell viability remain stable. 
A  list  of  all  materials  used  in  the  manufacturing  process  is  presented.  For  non-compendial  or 
critical  raw  materials  the  currently  qualified  vendors  are  described.  Specifications  for  non-
compendial raw materials as well as specifications for critical raw materials used in cell culture 
and purification have been added. 
The control strategy has been further clarified and/or justified. Updated flowcharts and process 
descriptions  including  the  entire  operating  ranges  of  the  controlled  parameters  were  provided 
and these were considered acceptable. Action limits for key and critical operational parameters 
as  well  as  specification  limits  for  critical  in-process  controls  have  been  provided.  The 
information on the analytical methods employed for the depletion/clearance process validation 
studies was considered acceptable. 
Finished product - Plegridy pre-filled syringe 
The information provided on the finished product manufacture, control and stability is deemed 
acceptable.  A  Major  Objection  was  initially  raised  on  the  description  and  qualification  of  the 
analytical procedures (as described in the active substance section) related to the control of the 
finished  product  at  release  and  its  stability  over  shelf  life.  This  objection  has  been  sufficiently 
addressed. 
The  approach  for  CQA  classification  based  on  risk  assessment  using  impact  and  uncertainty 
score  and  calculated  risk  priority  number  is  deemed  acceptable.  However,  the  approach  for 
setting specification acceptance criteria based on already too wide acceptance criteria for active 
substance  was  not  accepted.  During  the  initial  evaluation  the  Applicant  has  revised  the 
specifications or has provided adequate justification. 
The  batch  analyses  demonstrated  that  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  is  able  to 
produce lots that consistently meet the specifications set. 
Based  on  the  data  provided,  a  shelf-life  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  for  the  finished  product  is 
considered acceptable.

Finished Product – Plegridy Pre-filled Pen 
All development studies on pen suitability were performed by utilising the intended type of pre-
filled  pen  for  commercial  production.  The  established  strategy  for  controlling  and  monitoring 
the  assembly  process  provides  evidence  that  the  intended  product  quality  of  the  pen  is 
ensured.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions  on  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological 
aspects 
The  development,  characterisation,  and  manufacture  of  the  active  substance  and  finished 
product have been adequately described.  
The manufacturing process of the finished product is described in sufficient detail and has been 
satisfactorily  validated.  The  IPC  tests  are  described  and  deemed  suitable  for  controlling  and 
monitoring the manufacturing process. The results indicate that active substance as well as the 
finished  product  can  be  reproducibly  manufactured.  No  quality  aspects  impacting  on  the 
Benefit-Risk balance have been identified for Plegridy. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAHs  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommended some points for further investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  objective  of  the  non-clinical  program  of  Plegridy  was  to  evaluate  the  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of BIIB017 with a view to support up to weekly chronic SC 
administration in MS patients. The development was based on the experience gained with non-
modified  interferon  beta-1a  products  (Avonex  and  Rebif).  In  addition,  results  from  the  non-
clinical  developments  of  PegIntron  and  Pegasys  were  also  considered  given  that  these  drugs 
represent  a  pegylated  version  of  similar  type  I  interferons  that  have  been  approved  and 
marketed. 
The non-clinical development program of Plegridy was comprised of: 
• 
• 
Pharmacology  studies  evaluating  the  receptor  binding  affinity  and  the  in  vitro  antiviral 
and antiproliferative activity of BIIB017. 
PK  studies  evaluating  the  PK  profile  and  tissue  distribution  of  BIIB017,  including 
comparisons to interferon beta-1a. 
•  Non-clinical  safety  studies  to  support  the  chronic  use  of  BIIB017  for  MS  at  the 
recommended dose and regime. 
The  applicant  followed  the  relevant  scientific  guidelines  for  the  non-clinical  development,  the 
ICH S6 guideline for Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals. 
The  early  peginterferon  beta-1a  drug  substance  used  in  the  5 week  repeated-dose  toxicity 
study  in  rhesus  monkeys  and  the  initial  phase I  trials  (BIIB017-A)  was  derived  from  a  foetal 
bovine  serum-containing  production  and  was  later  replaced  by  a  serum-free  manufacturing 
process  without  materials  of  animal  origin  (BIIB017-B).  This  process  also  utilizes  a  different 
purification to  increase  yield  while  reducing  heterogeneity  of the  drug  product.  Comparability 
between  both  productions  also  in  relation  to  Avonex  was  investigated  in  physiochemical  and 
biochemical  studies  and  is  ensured  by  quality  measures.  Moreover,  both  BIIB017-A  and 
BIIB017-B  were  compared  in  non-clinical  investigations.  BIIB017-B  drug  product  was 
investigated in two phase I studies and in phase III and will be used for marketing of Plegridy. 
The  commercial  formulation  contains  peginterferon  beta-1a  in  acetic  acid/sodium  acetate 
buffer arginine HCl and polysorbate 20.  
For all of the non-clinical studies, with the exception of 1 PK study in rats, the 20 kDa mPEG-
O-2-methylpropionaldehyde was supplied from a single vendor.   
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacology programme, including primary and secondary in vitro pharmacology studies 
was  designed  to  determine  if  the  pharmacology  of  BIIB017  was  consistent  with  that  of 
interferon beta-1a (Avonex) with respect to: 
1.  Receptor binding affinity to interferon alpha/beta receptor 2 (IFNAR2), the receptor chain 
mediating high affinity binding of type I interferon beta-1a, 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 19/98 
 
  
  
2.  Antiviral activity in an assay measuring the ability to protect human A549 lung carcinoma 
cells from the cytopathic effect of encephalomyocarditis virus, 
3.  Antiproliferative  activity  in  an  assay  measuring  the  ability  to  inhibit  the  proliferation  of 
human Daudi B cells. 
Pharmacological  activity  of  BIIB017  was  further  evaluated  in  the  PK  and  toxicology  studies 
conducted in rhesus monkeys.  
In  vivo  efficacy  studies  in  animal  models  of  MS  were  not  conducted.  While  mouse  and  rat 
experimental  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis  (EAE)  models  have  been  developed  that  reflect 
certain  aspects  of  the  pathophysiology  of  MS,  mice  and  rats  are  not  pharmacologically 
responsive  to  human  interferon  beta-1a,  therefore  precluding  studies  with  BIIB017  in  these 
models. Moreover, the applicant considered it not appropriate to test pegylated mouse or rat 
interferon  beta  in  these  EAE  models  since  the  data  would  not  necessarily  reflect  the 
pharmacology  of  BIIB017  in  humans.  Furthermore,  there  was  considerable  data  on  the 
efficacy of interferon beta-1a in MS. 
The exact mechanism of action of interferon beta in MS is not known.  However, there are well 
established  biomarkers  of  the  pharmacological  activity  of  interferon  beta-1a  including  serum 
neopterin  levels  and  decreases  in  lymphocyte  numbers.  While  it  has  not  been  determined 
whether any of these biomarkers are surrogates for efficacy in MS, they were included in the 
PK and some of the non-clinical safety studies. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
According  to the  commonly  held  view,  type  I  interferons,  including  interferon  beta-1a,  signal 
through a cell surface receptor composed of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains.  The intracellular 
portions  of  IFNAR1  and  IFNAR2  associate  with  Janus  tyrosine  kinase  2  and  Janus  kinase  1, 
respectively. Following ligand binding, the kinases phosphorylate each other and the receptor 
chains  thereby  creating  binding  sites  for  Signal  Transducers  and  Activators  of  Transcription 
(STAT) proteins.  The STAT proteins are subsequently phosphorylated, oligomerise, migrate to 
the  nucleus,  and  drive  the  expression  of  interferon-stimulated  genes.  These  genes  and  their 
corresponding protein products are responsible for mediating the efficacy of interferon beta-1a 
in  MS.    IFNAR2  is  the  high  affinity  receptor  chain  that  first  binds  interferon  beta-1a  prior  to 
association of IFNAR1 with the interferon beta-1a/IFNAR2 binary complex. Therefore, binding 
to the type I interferon receptor was studied by investigating the affinity of interferon beta-1a 
and BIIB017 for the extracellular portion of the IFNAR2 chain.  
There  was  no  apparent  difference  in  the  affinity  of  either  interferon  beta-1a  or  BIIB017  for 
IFNAR2  indicating  that  in  solution,  the  20  kDa  mPEG  moiety  did  not  interfere  with  receptor 
binding.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  antiviral  activity  of  BIIB017  was  determined  in  an  assay  measuring  the  ability  of  the 
protein  to  protect  human  A549  lung  carcinoma  cells  from  the  cytopathic  effect  of 
encephalomyocarditis  virus,  and  the  antiproliferative  activity  was  determined  in  an  assay 
measuring the ability of the protein to inhibit the proliferation of human Daudi B cells. In these 
assays, BIIB017 showed a modest ~2-fold loss of potency compared to interferon beta-1a.   
These  differences  in  activity  of  BIIB017  compared  to  interferon  beta-1a  suggest  that  the 
Assessment report

affinity  for  the  type  I  interferon  receptor,  composed  of  the  full-length  IFNAR1  and  IFNAR2 
chains expressed on the cell surface, may be affected by the attached 20 kDa mPEG. Studies 
with  mouse  interferon  beta  have  shown  that  different  gene  sets  may  be  activated depending 
on  the  mode  of  activation  of  the  interferon  type  I  receptor  (de  Weerd  et  al,  2013).  Gene 
expression profiling of  peripheral blood samples, obtained from healthy human subjects in the 
phase  1  study  105HV101,  showed  the  induction  of  interferon  responsive  genes  both  by  IFN 
beta-1a and BIIB017, albeit with a temporal difference reflecting the slower absorption time of 
the pegylated form (Allaire et al 2013).   
Pharmacodynamic response was also monitored in pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies by 
determination  of  serum  neopterin,  increase  of  body  temperature  and  (in  the  repeated  dose 
toxicology  study  only)  decrease  in  peripheral  lymphocyte  count.  The  correlation  of  these 
surrogate  markers  of  interferon  beta  pharmacological  activity  with  efficacy  in  the  claimed 
indication is not known. As the increase in body temperature is variable, this surrogate marker 
was  considered  of  little  value  when  evaluating  the  pharmacodynamic  response  of  interferon 
beta. 
Serum neopterin (D-erythro-1’, 2’, 3’-trihydroxypropylpterin), a small molecule product of the 
activity  of  the  interferon-inducible  enzyme,  GTP-cyclohydrolase  I,  has  been  used  widely  as  a 
PD  marker  of  interferon  beta-1a  activity  in  both  humans  and  primates.  Neopterin  response 
following  a  single  administration  of  BIIB017  and  interferon  beta-1a  (100  µg/kg)  was  similar 
based  on  AUClast  and  Cmax.  Yet,  BIIB017  showed  a  longer  elimination  half-life  (t1/2), 
reduced  clearance,  and  greater  exposure  than  the  unmodified  protein  (see  pharmacokinetics 
section).  As  shown  in  a  subsequent  single  dose  dose-response  study  in  rhesus  monkeys, 
saturation of biological response occurs above a dose of 10 µg/kg. Thus, the study comparing 
interferon  beta-1a  with  BIIB017  likley  used  a  dose  which  was  already  in  the  maximum 
response range, making the study factually non-discriminative. 
In the 5-week repeated dose toxicology study, decreases in lymphocyte counts and increases 
in  neopterin  concentrations  were  observed  for  rhesus  monkeys  administered  BIIB017. 
However,  the  pharmacodynamic  response  diminished  from  the  3rd  dose  onwards,  which  was 
reflected by waning of the neopterin response, disappearance of the transient increase in body 
temperature  4  hours  post-dose  and  diminished  reduction  of  lymphocyte  count.  The  most 
probable  explanation  for  the  waning  of  these  PD  effects  is  the  appearance  of  neutralising 
antibodies  (Nabs).  However,  fading  of  the  effect  on  lymphocyte  count  was  delayed  in  the 
intramuscularly  treated  animals  and  the  applicant  suggested  that  administration  through  this 
route  may  delay  the  development  of  antibodies.  Yet,  in  IM  treated  animals  waning  of  the 
neopterin effect  was similar to that seen in the subcutaneously treated animals. 
Finally,  the  trend  and  magnitude  of  the  neopterin  response  was  similar  for  BIIB017-A  and 
BIIB017-B following a single SC or IM dose of 10 µg/kg in male rhesus monkeys. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety  pharmacological  parameters  were  monitored  in  the  repeated  dose  toxicology  study 
which  is  in  line  with  the  ICH  S6  guideline  for  biotechnology-derived  products.  The  only 
BIIB017-related  effect  was  a  variable  and  transient  increase  in  body  temperature  in  some 
animals, which was expected.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Due  to  the  lack  of  drug-drug  interactions  reported  for  other  interferon  beta  products  in  the 
clinical  and  commercial  settings  and  to  the  limited  value  in  the  qualitative  and  quantitative 
projection  of  interactions  between  therapeutic  proteins  and  drug  metabolising  enzymes  from 
in vitro or non-clinical studies, nonclinical drug interaction studies of BIIB017 were not carried 
out.   
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  designed  to  characterise  the  PK  profile  of 
BIIB017  in  comparison  with  unmodified  interferon  beta-1a,  particularly  with  regards  to 
clearance, exposure, and tissue distribution. In addition, dose linearity, gender differences and 
route of administration (SC and IM) were studied.  
Although not a pharmacologically relevant species, the rat was used as a pre-clinical model for 
PK  studies  to  evaluate  the  changes  in  renal  clearance  and  enzymatic  proteolysis  due  to 
pegylation.  More  detailed  PK  studies  were  then  conducted  in  rhesus  monkeys,  the 
pharmacologically relevant species to interferon beta-1a that has been used in pharmacology 
and  toxicology  studies.  Finally,  the  guinea  pig,  also  considered  a  pharmacologically  relevant 
species, was used to study tissue distribution. 
The  serum  concentrations  of  BIIB017  in  serum  samples  of  rats  and  rhesus  monkeys  were 
determined by a validated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a purified goat 
anti-human  interferon  beta  antibody.  Furthermore,  BIIB017  concentrations  were  determined 
during early research in rodents by a cytopathic effect bioassay which measures the ability of 
the protein to protect human lung carcinoma A549 cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis 
virus  .  The  serum  and  tissue  concentrations  of  BIIB017  in  the  tissue  distribution  study  were 
determined by radioactivity (125I). The PK analysis was conducted using a non-compartmental 
analysis  extravascular  input  model.  Moreover,  the  metabolic  stability  of  BIIB017  was 
evaluated in human and monkey serum by Western blot in vitro. 
Following  SC  single  dose  administration  in  rhesus  monkeys,  BIIB017  exposure  increased  in 
an approximately dose-proportional manner from 2 to 100 μg/kg. The concentration peaked at 
~12-24 h post-dose and t1/2 ranged from 14 to 21 h. The PK parameters were similar following 
SC  and  IM  administration  at  100  μg/kg,  except  faster  absorption  and  slightly  greater 
exposures  (AUClast  and  Cmax  were  1.3  and  2-fold  greater,  respectively,  following  IM 
administration). Supportive data were also available from other studies in nude mice, rats and 
rhesus monkeys.  
Following  repeated  dosing  in  a  5-week  toxicology  study  in  rhesus  monkeys,  dose-
proportional  exposure  of  BIIB017  was  confirmed  for  up  to  3  doses  (SC  or  IM).  Thereafter, 
BIIB017 exposure decreased and was not detectable in 29 out of 40 BIIB017-treated monkeys 
after the 5th dose, likely due to the development of Nabs. Similar PK data were available from 
another  5-week  repeat  dose  toxicity  study,  investigating  the  effect  of  BIIB017  on  the 
menstrual cycle of female rhesus monkeys. 
In  order  to  understand  the  impact  of  sialyation  and  mPEG  molecular  weight  on  BIIB017  PK 
parameters,  and  to  provide  guidance  for  BIIB017  specification,  a  single  dose  structure 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 22/98 
 
  
  
activity  relationship  study  was  conducted  in  rats.  BIIB017  exposure  in  rats  was  markedly 
reduced  by  major  decreases  in  the  percentage of  sialylation  and  the  molecular  weight  of  the 
mPEG used for pegylation, while a smaller reduction in the percentage of sialylation from 95% 
to  81%  had  minimum  impact  on  the  PK  in  rats.  Furthermore,  a  25%  difference  in  exposure 
between  BIIB017  manufactured  with  20  kDa  mPEG  obtained  from  two  independent  vendors 
was observed (see section 2.3.6. for related discussions).  
To support the pharmaceutical development of a serum-free production, the pharmacokinetic 
properties  of  pegylated 
interferon  beta-1a  derived 
from  an  early  serum-containing 
manufacturing  process  (BIIB017-A)  was  compared  in  rhesus  monkeys  with  material,  which 
was  subsequently  produced  without  serum    (BIIB017-B).  Generally,  the  PK  profiles  of  both 
BIIB017-A and BIIB017-B were similar after IM or SC administrations, but a 40% difference in 
Cmax was observed after SC dosing. The mean concentration difference was limited to the first 
few hours post-dose and converged at later time points. 
The  tissue  distribution  of  125I-BIIB017  and  125I-interferon  beta-1a  was  compared  in  guinea 
pigs after a single intravenous dose. Compared to non-pegylated interferon beta-1a, BIIB017 
showed  similar  tissue  distribution  pattern,  but  was  more  restricted  to  serum,  and  less 
distributed  to  tissues,  likely  due  to  increased  molecular  size.  The  tissue/serum  exposures 
ratios  of  BIIB017  was  reduced  as  much  as  20-40  fold  for  highly  distributed  tissues,  and  3-4 
fold for poorly distributed tissues. The rank order of AUClast72h ratios was consistent with that 
of  Cmax,  where  the  highest  tissue:serum  AUClast72h  ratios  were  observed  for  spleen,  kidney, 
liver, and lung. Elimination of radioactivity from all tissues was gradual over time, and by 72 h 
post-dose all tissues examined retained measurable levels of radioactivity. The majority of the 
radioactivity  was  recovered  in  urine  as  catabolic  products  (84.5%  and  63.6%  recovered  for 
BIIB017 and interferon beta-1a, respectively) with no intact protein detected, indicating renal 
clearance  as  the  major  elimination  pathway  for  both  BIIB017  and  interferon  beta-1a.  SDS-
PAGE analysis confirmed that the radioactivity present in serum (up to 72 hours post-dose), in 
spleen  and  kidney  (up  to  24  hours  post-dose),  and  in  liver  (up  to  6  hours  post-dose)  was 
primarily  associated  with  the  intact  pegylated  Interferon  beta-1a.  The  concentration  versus 
time  profiles  of  BIIB017  of  kidney,  liver,  lung,  and  spleen  were  generally  in  line  with  that  of 
serum, indicating that the estimated half-life of BIIB017 in tissues with the highest exposures 
was similar to that in serum. 
In  line  with  ICH  S6  recommendations,  a  metabolism  study  specific  to  BIIB017  was  not 
performed.  However,  the  stability  of  the  linker  between  the  mPEG  and  interferon  beta-1a 
moieties of BIIB017 was evaluated in serum of rhesus monkeys and humans in vivo. Limited 
degradation of BIIB017 in serum was observed. Both deconjugation, producing low molecular 
weight  (LMW)  BIIB017,  presumably  free  interferon  beta-1a,  and  the  formation  of  high 
molecular weight (HMW) product-related substances, presumably aggregates of BIIB017 with 
serum  protein  or  oligomers,  occurred,  amounting  to  30%  HMW  BIIB017  and  20%  (rhesus 
monkey  serum)  or  <5%  (human  serum)  LMW  BIIB017  after  2  weeks.  Since  half-life  of 
BIIB017  in  humans  is  approximately  2-3  days,  the  contribution  of  degradation  in  serum  is 
considered limited.    
Reference  to  the  literature  regarding  catabolism  of  interferon  in  vivo  was  also  provided.  The 
studies by Bino et al. (J Gen Virol. 1982; J Interferon Res. 1982) and Bocci et al. (J Interferon 
Res. 1981) mostly concern rat data, but also some rabbit and cynomolgus monkey data. The 
Assessment report

authors studied interferon alfa, instead of interferon beta-1a. Similar to the tissue distribution 
study  conducted  with  BIIB017  in  guinea  pigs,  these  studies  indicated  that  catabolism  mostly 
occurs  in  the  kidneys.  The  guinea  pig  study  showed  that  43%  of  radioactivity  appeared  in 
urine  within  the  first  8  hours,  which  accumulated  to  85%  after  72  hours.  Thus,  although  no 
direct proof was provided, it appears reasonable to assume that it is likely that BIIB017 will be 
catabolised  renally,  including  presumably  other  mammals,  and  humans.  A  preclinical  hepatic 
metabolizing enzyme-mediated metabolism study of BIIB017 was not conducted. 
For  the  same  reasons  mentioned  before  (section  2.3.2.  ),  pharmacokinetic  drug  interaction 
studies of BIIB017 were not carried out. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  rhesus  monkey  was  chosen  as  the  toxicology  species  for  BIIB017  as  it  is  was 
demonstrated  to  be pharmacologically  responsive  to  the  human  interferon-beta-1a  protein  in 
an  in  vitro  2’,5’-oligoadenylate  synthetase  induction  (2’,5-  OAS)  assay  in  peripheral  blood 
lymphocytes (PBL). 
The  nonclinical  toxicology  programme  for  BIIB017  was  designed  to  support  chronic 
administration for the treatment of MS and consisted of: 
•  5-week  repeat-dose  toxicology  study  (with  a  4-week  recovery  period)  in  rhesus 
monkeys, 
• 
In vitro genotoxicity studies (Ames and chromosomal aberrations, and 
•  5-week  repeat-dose  study  in  female  rhesus  monkeys  to  evaluate  effects  of  BIIB017  on 
hormones involved in pregnancy and effects on the menstrual cycle. 
Exposure  to  BIIB017  was  determined  using  an  ELISA  assay.  Furthermore,  pharmacological 
markers  of  interferon  beta  activity,  body temperature  and  serum  neopterin,  were  included  in 
the 5-week repeat dose toxicity study. Studies were limited to a duration of no longer than 5 
weeks because, consistent with the effects of observed with non-pegylated interferon beta-1a, 
the  administration  of  BIIB017  resulted  in  the  development  of  neutralising  antibodies  that 
significantly  reduced  and  in  some  animals  ablated  exposure  after  repeated  dosing.  Animals 
used  in  in  vivo  toxicology studies  were  administered  BIIB017  in  the  same  vehicle  and  routes 
(SC or IM) used for BIIB017 administered in the clinic to human subjects.  
BIIB017-A,  the  pegylated  form  of  interferon  beta-1a  derived  from  serum-containing 
manufacturing process, was used in the 5- week toxicity study in rhesus monkeys. BIIB017-B, 
produced  by  a  serum-free  process  intended  for  commercialisation  that  uses  no  materials  of 
direct  animal  origin,  was  used  for  the  5-week  hormone  study  in  female  rhesus  monkeys  and 
for the in vitro genotoxicity assays. 
Single dose toxicity 
In line with ICH S6, single-dose toxicity studies with BIIB017 were not conducted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The potential toxicity of BIIB017 was evaluated by administration to male and female rhesus 
monkeys  once  weekly  for  5  weeks  of  up  to  100  μg/kg  via  SC  or  IM  injection,  followed  by  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 24/98 
 
  
  
four-week  treatment-free  recovery  period.  No  relevant  changes  have  been  observed  in  this 
toxicology  study,  besides  the  expected  mild  pharmacological  effects  and  the  anticipated 
generation  of  neutralising  antibody  (NAbs).  Based  on  the  results  of  this  study,  the  applicant 
calculated a 400-fold safety margin over the clinical maintenance dose (125 μg). However, the 
difference  in  sensitivity  for  pharmacology  related  adverse  effects  between  rhesus  monkeys 
and  humans  was  not  considered  in  this  calculation.  Furthermore,  chronicity  of  exposure  is 
excluded  from  the  monkey  study  since  repeated  exposure  causes  formation  of  ADA,  greatly 
diminishing  exposure.  ADAs  were  formed  in  most  monkeys  and  these  antibodies  appeared 
quickly.  Almost  all  of  these  antibodies  were  neutralising  antibodies.  Consequently,  after 
3 weeks  of  weekly  repeated  dosing,  BIIB017  serum  levels  were  diminished.  Similarly,  the 
pharmacodynamic  parameters  (transient  rise  in  body  temperature  and  elevation  of  serum 
neopterin and reduction in peripheral blood lymphocyte count) also diminished in the course of 
the study.  
Genotoxicity 
The  class  of  type  I  interferons,  as  well  as  higher  molecular  weight  poly(ethyleneglycol)  
molecules    (i.e.  12  kD  mPEG)  have  not  been  demonstrated  to  be  genotoxic.  Furthermore, 
according  to  ICH  S6  guidance,  proteins  are  not  expected  to  have  genotoxic  potential  and 
standard genotoxicity assays are not appropriate to assess the genotoxic potential of process 
impurities.  
However,  as  in  silico  results  from  a  DEREK  analysis  of  the  20  kDa  mPEG-O-2-
methylpropionaldehyde  moiety  of  BIIB017  revealed  a  structural  alert  for  chromosomal 
damage,  genotoxicity,  and  mutagenicity,  BIIB017  was  tested  in  an  Ames  mutagenicity  assay 
and in a chromosomal aberration assay). Both tests were negative.  
Carcinogenicity 
Consistent  with  the  ICHS6  Addendum,  a  weight  of  evidence  approach  was  taken  in  the 
evaluation  of  the  potential  carcinogenicity  risk  of  BIIB017  for  humans.  The  nonclinical 
toxicology  profile  of  BIIB017  as  well  as  of  type  I  interferons  as  described  in  the  scientific 
literature  did  not  indicate  a  cause  for  concern  and  BIIB017  was  negative  in  the  in  vitro 
genotoxicity  assessment.  Finally,  though  limited  in  duration,  no  concern  arose  from  the 
preclinical  safety  assessments  for  BIIB017  or  Avonex.  Thus,  the  weight  of  evidence  did  not 
suggest a potential human risk for cancer and no carcinogenicity studies were conducted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
A  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  study  was  not  conducted  due  to  the  known 
abortifacient  activity  of  interferon  beta-1a  in  rhesus  monkeys  (Avonex  EPAR).  Instead,  the 
reproductive  toxicity  of  BIIB017  was  evaluated  in  a  5-week  study  in  sexually  mature  female 
rhesus  monkeys  that  was  designed  to  determine  if  BIIB017  caused  hormonal  changes 
(progesterone  and  17-beta  estradiol)  in  sexually  mature,  non-pregnant  monkeys  consistent 
with  the  anovulatory  and  abortifacient  interferon  class  effects.  Results  from  this  study  were 
meant to serve as a bridge to the developmental and reproductive toxicity studies conducted 
for Avonex. 
Treatment with 125 μg/kg/week of BIIB017 for up to 5 doses was associated with a reversible 
prolongation of menstrual cycles and reductions in serum 17-beta estradiol and progesterone 
levels. Two out of five animals in the high dose group (125 ug/kg/week) and one out of five in 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 25/98 
 
  
  
the low dose group (2.5 ug/kg/week) showed prolonged menstrual cycles. In one of the high 
dose  animals  with  a  prolonged  menstrual  cycle,  hormone  levels  did  not  show  a  peak  in  the 
acclimatisation  period  either,  and  in  the  other  animal,  no  clear  hormone  peak  could  be 
observed in the post-dose recovery period, which might have been an early sign of the animal 
phasing out the breeding season. No effects on menstrual cycle or serum hormone levels were 
observed  following  treatment  of  2.5  μg/kg/week  of  BIIB017,  at  approximately  a  10-fold 
exposure-based safety margin over the clinical dose.  
Toxicokinetic data 
The  pharmacokinetic  data  from  the  5-week  repeated  dose  toxicology  study  are  described  in 
the pharmacokinetic section of this report (see section 2.3.3. ). The relevance of this study for 
evaluation  of  long-term  safety  was  limited  due  to  the  reduction  in  exposure  following 
formation of NAbs.  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance, as measured by injection site reactions, was evaluated in the 5 week repeat-
dose  study  in  rhesus  monkeys.  There  were  no  adverse  BIIB017-related  changes  at  any 
injection  site  for  any  dose  tested  up  to  100  μg/kg  (11  MIU/kg)  following  SC  or  IM 
administration. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Formation of binding and neutralising antibodies was monitored in the 5-week repeated dose 
study of BIIB017 in rhesus monkeys with a 4-week recovery period (see above).  
Immunotoxicity 
Consistent with ICH S8, potential immunomodulatory effects of BIIB017 were evaluated in the 
repeat  dose  toxicology  study  by  evaluation  of  haematology,  and  of  macro-  and  microscopic 
analysis  of  tissues.  There  was  no  indication  for  any  immune  modulatory  effects  of  BIIB017 
suggestive of a cause for concern. 
Studies on impurities 
The  applicant  did  not perform  any  studies  on  impurities,  which  is  in  agreement  with  ICH  S6, 
where  it  is  stated  that  it  is  preferable  to  rely  on  purification  processes  to  remove  impurities 
and contaminants rather than to establish a preclinical testing program for their qualification. 
Consequently,  the  safety  assessment  for  the  process-related  impurities  was  based  on  the 
clearance validation. 
Concerning  product-related  impurities,  free  interferon  beta-1a  is  of  no  concern  as  per  the 
specification.  Likewise,  free  residual  mPEG  is  of  no  toxicological  concern  since  the  aldehyde 
form is quenched to produce the arginine conjugate and the maximum daily dose is 0.2 µg. No 
information was provided on peginterferon dimers and oligomers. As PK, PD and immunogenic 
potential  may  be  affected,  the  CHMP  considered  it  to  be  important  that  these  impurities  are 
kept consistently at a low level. However, there is  no need to investigate these properties of 
the impurities per se.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Peginterferon  beta-1a  is  not  a  persistent,  bioaccumulative  and  toxic  (PBT)  substance  as  log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. Furthermore, the predicted environmental concentration in surface 
water (PECsw) was 4.1 x 10-6 µg/L, which is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore, in 
line with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal product for human 
use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1), no further (phase II) studies were performed.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Regarding  non-clinical  pharmacology,  the  applicant  provided  in  vitro  data  showing  that 
Plegridy  (BIIB017),  like  Avonex  (interferon  beta  1a)  binds  to  the  extracellular  domain  of 
IFNAR2. However, when tested in cell assays, compared to interferon beta 1a, a modest 2-fold 
reduction of in vitro antiviral and antiproliferative activity was demonstrated, suggesting that 
the affinity for the type I interferon receptor, composed of the full-length IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 
chains expressed on the cell surface, may be affected by the attached 20 kDa mPEG. This may 
lead  to  differences  in  gene  expression.  However,  there  was  no  indication  for  a  differential 
activation of interferon responsive genes other than a temporal difference reflecting the longer 
elimination time of peginterferon beta-1a. 
The justification by the applicant to limit the pharmacology studies to the above mentioned in 
vitro studies and to gather data on pharmacological surrogate markers in pharmacokinetic and 
safety studies was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
These  studies  showed  that  BIIB017  is  pharmacologically  active  in  vivo  in  rhesus  monkeys  as 
expressed by increased serum neopterin, transient mild body temperature elevations in some, 
but  not  all  monkeys  and  reduction  of  peripheral  blood  lymphocyte  count.  All  shifts  in  these 
parameters,  as  well  as  BIIB017  plasma  levels  were diminished  after the  3rd  weekly  dose  due 
to the formation of NAbs. After 5 weeks, practically no BIIB017 could be confirmed in plasma 
samples  and  the  pharmacodynamic  response  had  disappeared.  Therefore,  no  conclusions  on 
the long-term safety of BIIB017 could be drawn.

EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 27/98 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
With  regards  to  long-term  safety,  renal  epithelial  vacuolation  was  described  in  the  literature 
after  3  month  exposure  to  pegylated  proteins  in  rats.  However,  since  the  dose  of  BIIB017  in 
patients will be more than 2000-fold lower on a mg/kg bodyweight basis, similar renal effects 
in patients treated with BIIB017 were considered unlikely.  
Pharmacokinetics 
PK studies in both rats and rhesus monkeys indicated that the pegylation reduced clearance, 
prolonged half-life, and increased exposure of BIIB017 compared to the unmodified interferon 
beta-1a as expected.  
Furthermore, PK profiles of both BIIB017-A and BIIB017-B were generally similar following IM 
or  SC  administration,  but  a  40%  difference  in  Cmax  was  observed  during  the  first  few  hours 
post SC-dosing. However, considering that most clinical studies were performed with BIIB017-
B derived material, which will be used commercially, the CHMP considered that this difference 
could be acceptable, since conclusions on tolerability in humans would not solely be based on 
data from studies performed with BIIB017-A. 
A rat study showed that BIIB017 exposure was markedly affected by major changes in the 
percentage of sialylation and the molecular weight of the mPEG. Furthermore, a 25% 
difference in exposure between BIIB017 manufactured with 20 kDa mPEG obtained from two 
independent vendors was observed, raising questions on the inter-changeability of the two 
mPEGs. The applicant considered that the difference in point estimates was due to the 
variability observed in the PK study (16-35%) and in the bioanalytical assay (<10%), as well 
as due to the small study size (N=10). Further to the review of additional analyses, the CHMP 
concluded that the apparent differences were unlikely to cause a clinically relevant PK 
difference in humans 
The  tissue  distribution  pattern  of  BIIB017  was  generally  similar  to  non-modified  interferon 
beta-1a,  but  was  more  restricted  to  serum,  and  less  distributed  to  tissues,  likely  due  to 
increased  molecular  size.  No  metabolism  studies  were  performed  with  BIIB017,  which  is 
agreed considering the protein nature of the product. Although no direct proof was provided, 
based  on  the  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  BIIB017  was  likely  to  be  catabolised 
renally.  The  fate  of  the  PEG  moiety  was  not  further  studied,  but  in  view  of  the  clinical 
experience  with  pegylated  proteins,  no  further  study  was  considered  necessary  by  the  CHMP 
at the time of this report. 
Toxicology 
The CHMP agreed that the lack of single dose toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies was 
in line with ICH S6 and therefore acceptable. Likewise, in line with ICH S8, no immunotoxicity 
studies were needed. While no concerns arose from the repeated toxicity study, the estimate 
of  a  400-fold  safety  margin  over  the  clinical  maintenance  dose  (125  μg)  as  proposed  by  the 
applicant was not agreed by the CHMP for the reasons described above.  
Finally, the CHMP considered, after critical review of the results of the study performed in 
sexually mature female rhesus monkeys, that no firm conclusions could be drawn from these 
data. Prolongation of menstrual cycles might have been due to other reasons than treatment 
with BIIB017.  Furthermore, variability in hormone levels was high and the number of animals 
in the study was low. In general, the evidence for an abortifacient effect caused by interferon 
Assessment report

Page 28/98 
 
  
  
betas was considered to be very limited altogether and it was not considered evident that the 
temporal changes in hormone level can be extrapolated to pregnant animals. Effect in 
pregnancy was included as missing information in the risk management plan (RMP) of Plegridy 
and data on pregnancy outcomes will be collected post-marketing in the European Interferon 
Beta Pregnancy Registry. 
As the predicted environmental concentration in surface water was below the action limit and 
since no other environmental concerns were apparent, peginterferon beta 1a was not expected 
to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP concluded that BIIB017 has been shown to have qualitatively similar 
pharmacological properties compared to interferon beta-1a in vitro and in vivo, which would 
support the use of Plegridy in the proposed indication from a non-clinical point of view. Non-
clinical PD and PK comparisons have shown that the addition of 20 kDal mPEG to the 
interferon protein prolongs the duration of its pharmacodynamic  activity, but does not clearly 
affect its pharmacological response qualitatively.  
Overall, the CHMP was of the opinion that the non-clinical program presented with this 
application was acceptable and that relevant data were adequately reflected in the product 
information.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A  total  of  5  clinical  studies  were  performed  to  study  the  pharmacokinetics  and 
pharmacodynamics  of  peginterferon-beta  1a  (BIIB017):  three  Phase  1  studies  in  healthy 
subjects  (studies  105HV101,  105HV102  and  105HV103),  one  Phase  1  study  in  subjects  with 
renal impairment (Study 105RI101) and one Phase 3 study in MS patients (Study 105MS301). 
Among  these  studies,  3  were  single  dose  studies  (studies  105HV101,  105HV103,  and 
105RI101)  and  2  were  multiple-dose  studies  (studies  105HV102  and  105MS301).  Study 
105HV103 is considered a biopharmaceutical study, which characterised the PK of the prefilled 
syringe (PFS) and prefilled pen (PFP). 
BIIB017 was administered subcutaneously in all studies. Intramuscular route of administration 
was also evaluated to compare BIIB017 with non-pegylated interferon beta-1a (Avonex).  
The BIIB017 doses evaluated in Phase 1 studies ranged from 63 to 188 µg in healthy subjects, 
and from 63 to 125 µg in subjects with renal impairment.  
In the Phase 3 study (105MS301) with MS patients, 63 and 94 µg were used as titration doses 
and  125  µg  as  the  therapeutic  dose.  Blood  samples  were  taken  from  all  subjects  at  Week  4 
and  24,  using  a  combination  of  intensive  (frequent  sampling)  and  sparse  sampling  strategy. 
For PK/PD evaluation, result from the intensive sampling group were used. Only a small group 
of  patients  agreed  and  was  eligible  for  participation  in  the  intensive  sampling  schedule  at 
Weeks 4 and 24 (44 subjects total, placebo group included, 25 subjects in the BIIB017 group). 
The  PK  profile  of  BIIB017  was  determined  by  a  validated  ELISA  assay  in  all  studies  and  a 
validated  cytopathic  effect  bioassay  in  selected  studies.  Results  from  a  cell-based  myxovirus 
resistance  protein  A  (MxA)  gene  assay  were  not  considered  for  the  PK  assessment  as  the 
validation  parameters  did  not  meet  all  target  criteria.  The  cytopathic  effect  assay  has 
traditionally  been  used  to  measure  unmodified  interferon  concentrations,  but  is  unable  to 
discriminate between different interferon types.  
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 32/98 
 
  
  
 
For the initial PK comparison between BIIB017 and interferon beta-1a, conclusions were drawn 
based  on  results  from  the  cytopathic  effect  assay.  The  ELISA  assay  was  used  in  subsequent 
studies. Both cytopathic effect and ELISA assays showed similar PK properties for BIIB017 in 2 
studies (105HV101 and 105HV102).  
Finally,  a  population  PK/PD  analysis  study  (CPP-12-016-BIIB017)  was  performed  to 
characterise  the  PK  profile  of  BIIB017  in  the  MS  population,  identify  intrinsic  and  extrinsic 
factors  which  affect  BIIB017  disposition,  characterise  exposure-response  relationships  with 
neopterin and identify covariates that were significant determinants of variability of neopterin 
response.  The  population  PK  model  was  developed  using  data  from  study  105MS301  and 
based  on  a  one-compartment  linear  model  with  a  first-order  absorption  rate.  For  the 
population PD model, data from study 105HV102 and 105MS301 were pooled and an indirect 
stimulatory response  (Emax) model was applied. 
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of BIIB017 SC has not been compared to the intravenous route of 
application since only the SC route was evaluated in the pivotal clinical study, which is also the 
proposed  route  for  commercial  use.  Like other  biologics,  peginterferon  beta-1a  is  believed  to 
be absorbed through the lymphatic system and by blood capillaries after SC administration. 
Generally, the estimated inter-subject variability was high (AUC: 56–88% and Cmax: 47–75%). 
Likewise, a high intra-subject variability was observed (AUC: 26–46% and Cmax: 38–55%). 
In  order  to  study  the  effect  of  pegylation,  the  applicant  compared  the  PK  profile  of  BIIB017 
with non-pegylated interferon beta-1a in healthy subjects (study 105HV101). 
In study 105HV101, a single SC injection of BIIB017 resulted in approximately 4-, 9-, and 13-
fold  higher  exposure  (AUC168h)  values  and  approximately  2-,  3.5-  and  5-fold  higher  Cmax 
values, following single doses of 63 (6 MIU), 125 (12 MIU), and 188 µg (18 MIU) respectively, 
compared to intramuscular administration of 30 µg (6 MIU) non-pegylated interferon beta-1a. 
Following  SC  administration  of  BIIB017  in  MS  patients  (study  105MS301),  the  peak 
concentration  was  reached  between  1  to  1.5  days  post-dose.  After  repeat  dosing  of  125  µg, 
the observed Cmax (mean ± SD) was 280 ± 249 pg/ml with every two weeks (q2W) dosing and 
305±  225  pg/ml    with  every  4  weeks  dosing  (q4W).  The  concentration  at  the  end  of  the 
dosing  interval  (mean  ±  SD)  was  34.8±  17  and  32.9  ±  20  h*ng/ml  for  the  q2W  and  q4W 
dosing,  respectively  and  the  AUC168h  (mean  ±  SD)  was  29.9 ±  18  h*ng/ml  and  29.5  ±  18 
h*ng/ml  for  the  q2W  and  q4W  dosing,  respectively.  BIIB017  exposures  based  on  median 
values (Cmax and AUC168h) decreased by 6% and 3% (q2W) and by 23% and 27% (q4W) from 
Week 4 to Week 24. 
In  order  to  facilitate  assessment  of  possible  differences  between  healthy  subjects  and  MS 
patients, exposure variables AUC and Cmax were compared across studies (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 - AUC and Cmax Comparison Between Healthy Volunteers and MS Patients 
No study was performed comparing different injection sites (thigh, arm or abdomen). However 
Pop PK analysis showed that injection site was not a significant covariate.  
Bioequivalence 
No  bioequivalence  study  was  carried  between  the  products  manufactured  with  and  without 
serum (BIIB017-A and BIIB017-B). The pivotal study and its extension study were performed 
with the serum-free manufactured product, which is the proposed commercial formulation. 
Study  105HV103  was  conducted  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetics  of  BIIB017  between  the 
two delivery systems applied for, the pre-filled syringe (PFS) and the pre-filled pen [PFP or AI 
(autoinjector)].  No  formal  statistical  testing  was  performed  as  the  study  was  not  powered  to 
show bioequivalence and the inter-subject variability was high. However, study 105HV103 was 
submitted  as  a  descriptive  study  to  characterise  the  PK  profiles  of  the  two  delivery  systems. 
The  serum  concentration-time  curves  obtained  with  both  devices  are  depicted  in  Figure  3. 
BIIB017  exposure  with  the  autoinjector/PFP  was  only  slightly  higher  (AUC:  7%  and 
Cmax: 18%) and compared to the PFS. Furthermore, the interquartile range of the two devices 
overlapped.

Food interaction  
No food interaction study was done and this is not necessary as BIIB017 will be administered 
subcutaneously. 
Distribution 
No protein binding study was performed as this is not required for pegylated proteins.  
Following  repeat  dosing  of  125μg  SC  BIIB017,  the  apparent  volume  of  distribution  was 
481 ± 105 l (mean ± SE). 
Elimination 
No mass balance study was conducted in humans for BIIB017.  
Pegylation  is  known  to  alter  the  PK  properties  of  a  protein,  which  includes  decreased  renal 
clearance and decreased proteolysis leading to an extended circulating half-life (t1/2). This has 
been substantiated for BIIB017 in study 105MS301 as follows: The t1/2 of BIIB017 in healthy 
volunteers  was  approximately  2-fold  longer  than  of  the  non-pegylated  interferon  beta-1a 
(study 105HV101). In MS patients, the steady-state t1/2 (mean ± SE) of BIIB017 was 78 ±15 
hours and the steady state clearance was 4.1 ± 0.4 l/h (mean ± SE). 
Based  on  a  simple  linear  regression  model  predicting  clearance  as  a  function  of  estimated 
glomerular  filtration  rate,  total  renal  clearance  was  estimated  to  be  due  to  42%  renal 
clearance and 58% non-renal clearance. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following SC administration of BIIB017, linear pharmacokinetics were observed.  
In  both  single  dose  and  repeat  dose  studies  (105HV101  and  105HV102),  systemic  exposure 
(AUC168h  and  Cmax)  increased  in  an  approximately  dose-proportionate  manner  following  SC 
administration of doses of 63, 125 and 188 µg BIIB017.  
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1

No  accumulation  was  observed  in  BIIB017  exposure  following  multiple  doses  of  125μg  once 
every 2 weeks or once every 4 weeks in MS subjects (study 105MS301).  
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The  renal  impairment  study  (105RI101)  showed  that  increasing  severity  of  renal  impairment 
resulted  in  a  corresponding  increase  in  BIIB017  exposures.  In  subjects  with  mild,  moderate 
renal 
impairment  based  on  glomerular 
and  severe 
rate  classification 
(mL/min/1.73m2) and median values, the AUC336h increased by 13, 22 and 62%, respectively, 
and Cmax increased by 32, 38, and 44%, respectively, compared to normal renal function. The 
AUC336h  and  Cmax  of  the  normal  renal  function  and  end-stage  renal  disease  (ESRD)  groups 
were  similar,  which  was  partly  due  to  BIIB017  removal  by  dialysis  as  shown  by  a  24% 
filtration 
(geometric mean) reduction from pre- to post-haemodialysis. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No  hepatic  impairment  study  was  conducted  as  the  liver  is  only  one  of  many  other  catabolic 
organs (e.g. spleen, lung, lymph nodes and pancreas) involved in the metabolism of interferon 
beta-1a and therefore hepatic impairment was considered by the applicant not likely to have a 
significant effect on the PK profile of BIIB017.  
However,  hepatic  function  was  tested in  the  population  PK/PD  study  (CPP-12-016-  BIIB017). 
The population PK (PopPK) analysis showed no hepatic function effect. However, the analysis 
has  limited  value  as,  in  line  with  the  inclusion  criteria  of  the  pivotal  trial,  which  was  used  to 
build the model, subjects had normal laboratory values. 
Age 
No patients older than 65 years of age were included in the Phase 3 studies.  
No  data  were  available  in  children  at  the  time  of  this  report.  A  study  in  the  MS  paediatric 
population  (10  years to  17  years  old) is  being planned.  A  waiver  for  a  PIP has  been  granted 
for children younger than 10 years since MS is exceedingly rare in this age group.  
The PopPK analysis showed that age did not impact on the PK of BIIB017. 
Weight 
Body weight did not affect the PK parameters of BIIB017 in the PopPK analysis. However, the 
model  predicted  a  less  than  proportional  increase  in  clearance  (CL)  with  body  mass  index 
(BMI). A 50% increase in BMI corresponded to a 24% increase in CL, which translates into a 
decrease in BIIB017 median AUC of about 40% in the highest BMI quintile (80%) compared to 
the lowest quintile (20%).  
Race 
The PopPK analysis showed that race did not influence BIIB017 PK parameters.  
Gender 
The PopPK analysis showed that gender did not influence BIIB017 PK parameters.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  drug-drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted  due  to  the  lack  of  drug-drug  interaction 
observed for existing beta interferons used in the treatment of MS.  
However, in the pivotal Phase 3 study and its extension, patients were allowed to received IV 
corticosteroids  to  treat  relapses  and  the  study  data  suggested  that  concomitant  use  of  both 
products  was  well 
tolerated.  Furthermore,  other  concomitant  medication 
including 
paracetamol,  ibuprofen,  mepresone,  naproxen,  modafinil,  gabapentin,  and  baclofen,  selected 
based  on  the  high  frequency  of  use  in  MS  subjects  in  study  105MS301  and  their  potential 
influence  on  renal  and  hepatic  functions,  did  not  significantly  affect  the  PK  parameters  of 
BIIB017 in the PopPK analysis.  
No data on consequences of possible genetic polymorphism were provided.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  BIIB017  is  considered  to  be  the  same  as  for  interferon  beta. 
BIIB017 binds to the type I interferon receptor on the surface of cells and elicits a cascade of 
intracellular events  leading  to the  regulation  of  interferon-responsive  gene  expression.  These 
genes, and their gene products, are believed to mediate the efficacy of BIIB017 in MS. 
Interferon  beta  modulates  immune  responses  that  are  believed  to  play  a  role  in  the 
pathogenesis  of  MS.  While  the  pathogenesis  of  the  disease  is  complex  and  multifaceted, 
BIIB017 may act at several levels including up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. 
IL-4,  IL-10,IL-27),  down-regulation  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  (e.g.  IL-2,  IL-12,  IFN-γ, 
TNF-α)  and  inhibiting  the  migration  of  activated  T  cells  across  the  blood  brain  barrier. 
Furthermore,  it  has  been shown that  interferon  beta-1a  induces  the  synthesis  of  Interleukin-
10. This cytokine contributes to slow down auto immunological processes in the disease course 
of MS. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The pharmacology of peginterferon beta-1a was investigated in 4 studies, including 3 phase 1 
studies (studies 105HV101, 105HV102, 105RI101) and 1 phase 3 study (study 105MS301). 
The assessment of the pharmacological activity of BIIB017 was based on study results for the 
elevation  of  serum  neopterin  concentration  and  whole  blood  2',5'-oligoadenylate  synthetase 
(2’,5’-OAS)  expression.  Neopterin  is  a  well-characterised  biomarker  induced  by  type  I 
interferons and was determined using a competitive, validated ELISA in all PD studies, i.e. in 
both healthy subjects and MS patients. Expression of 2’,5’-OAS, an interferon-induced protein 
important in the antiviral actions of interferons, was determined only in study 105HV101 using 
a  real-time  polymerase  chain  reaction  to  quantify  OAS  messenger  RNA.  PD  parameters, 
including the maximum serum concentration (Emax), time to reach Emax (ETmax) and area under 
the concentration-time curve (EAUC) were determined based on the respective median values 
after  baseline  adjustment.  In  addition,  for  the  neopterin  response,  EAUC  and  ET  for 
concentrations above 1.5ng/ml (EAUCdur and ETdur) were determined as these were considered 
most likely treatment-related in Study 105HV101.  
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 37/98 
 
  
  
In  the  single  dose  study  105HV101,  levels  of  both  neopterin  serum  concentration  and 
2',5'-OAS  expression  increased  in  less  than  a  dose  proportionate  manner  with  increasing 
concentrations  of  BIIB017.  The  maximum  neopterin  concentrations  were  attained  at  about 
48 h.  Neopterin  and  2',5'-OAS  profiles  obtained  for  SC  and  IM  route  of  administration  were 
comparable.  Compared  to  non-pegylated  interferon  beta-1a,  the  neopterin  and  2',5'-OAS 
responses to BIIB017 were augmented (EAUC336h and Emax) and a longer duration of effect was 
observed as shown by the neopterin median EAUCdur and ETdur (591 versus 289 h*ng/ml and 
167 versus 109 ng/ml, respectively). 
Similar  to  the  single-dose  study,  neopterin  serum  concentrations  increased  in  a  less  than 
dose-proportionate  manner  in  the  multiple-dose  study  in  healthy  volunteers  (105HV102).  In 
general,  neopterin  profiles  obtained  for  both  the  q2W  and  q4W  regimes  were  comparable. 
However,  there  was  a  slight  reduction  in  the  neopterin  levels  with  the  q2W  dosing  scheme 
from  Day  1  to  Day 29  while  no  such  reduction  was  observed  when  BIIB017  was  dosed  q4W. 
For  the  125  µg  dose  at  Day  29,  the  EAUC336h  was  slightly  lower  (10%)  for  the  q4W  regime 
than  with  the  q2W  dosing  frequency  (1145  versus  1270  h*ng/ml,  respectively)  but  the 
induction ratio (ratio of peak to baseline) was slightly higher (6%) for q4W compared to q2W 
(4.7 versus 4.4-fold, respectively).  
In  MS  patients  (study  105MS301),  the  maximum  neopterin  levels  were  attained  at  about 
72 hours  post-dose.  Levels  returned  to  near  baseline  values  at  about  10 to  14  days  for  both 
q2W  and  q4W  dosing.  Neopterin  levels  decreased  with  repeated  dosing  particularly  for  the 
q2W  dosing  regimen.  From  Week  4  to  Week  24,  Emax  and  EAUC336h  decreased  by  40%  and 
48%, respectively following q2W dosing and by 8% and 20%, respectively with  q4W dosing. 
In terms of EAUC336h at week 24 dose, a higher value was obtained for q4W (47%) compared 
to q2W (1397 versus 956 h*ng/ml, respectively).  
In  renally  impaired  patients  (study  105RI101),  neopterin  baseline  values,  EAUC672h  and  Emax  
increased  with  worsening  renal  impairment.  The  baselines  in  the  ESRD  groups  were  5-fold 
greater compared with the normal renal function group. EAUC672h and Emax in the ESRD group 
were about 10-fold greater compared with the normal renal function group. 
Immunogenicity 
A  tiered  testing  scheme  was  used  to  measure  immunogenicity.  Firstly,  sera  samples  were 
tested for the presence of antibodies that bind to interferon beta-1a (binding antibodies, BAbs) 
using ELISA. Samples that generated a positive response were further tested for the presence 
and  titer  of  interferon  beta-1a  neutralising  antibodies  (Nabs)  in  a  validated  cell-based  assay 
measuring  the  induction  of  MxA  expression  by  ELISA.  All  samples  were  also  tested  for  the 
presence  and  titer  of  antibodies  to  PEG.  Evaluation  of  the  immunogenic  potential  of  BIIB017 
was  conducted  by  initially  categorising  subjects  negative  at  baseline  and  positive  post-
baseline. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent antibodies to interferon beta-1a or PEG was low in both 
healthy  volunteers  and  MS  subjects.  In  Year  1  of  the  pivotal  study  105MS301,  the  incidence 
was  4%  and  8%  in  the  q4W  and  q2W  groups,  respectively.  With  regards  to  Nabs,  less  than 
1%  were  seen  in  both  BIIB017  treatment  groups.  Anti-PEG  antibodies  were  observed  in  9% 
and  7%  in  the  q4W  and  q2W  groups,  respectively.  The  majority  of  treatment-emergent 
antibodies  were  transient  responses.  Additional  data  from  2  and  3  years  exposure  indicated 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 38/98 
 
  
  
that  the  level  of  antibodies  remained  low  throughout,  with  Nabs  remaining  at  an  incidence 
below  1%  and  overall,  3%  of  patients  developing  persistent  antibodies  to  the  PEG  moiety  of 
peginterferon.  
In  the  intensive  PK/PD  group  in  study  105MS301,  2  subjects  each  were  tested  positive  for 
anti-interferon  Babs  and  anti-PEG  antibodies.  No  patient  in  this  group  had  Nabs.  In  the  Bab 
positive  subjects,  significantly  reduced  BIIB017  serum  concentrations  (in  one  case  not 
detectable)  were  observed  at  Week  24  compared  to  the  group  median,  while  the  neopterin 
response  was  not  affected.  Neopterin  response  and  BIIB017  serum  concentration  were 
comparable to the group median for the two patients testes anti-PEG positive. 
The  effect  of  anti-interferon  binding  antibodies  (BAbs)  could  not  be  reliably  predicted  in  the 
PopPK  analysis,  as  the  anti-interferon  BAbs  positive  subjects  and  BLQ  (below  the  limit  of 
quantitation) concentrations due to BAbs were excluded from analysis. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considered that the bioanalytical methods used for PK/PD analyses  were generally 
acceptable. While the cytopathic effect assay was not discriminatory between interferon types, 
the  lack  of  specificity  was  considered  to  be  compensated  by  the  parallel  use  of  the  selective 
and validated ELISA method. 
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  BIIB017  SC  has  not  been  studied.  However,  the  PK  profile  of 
peginterferon  beta-1a  was  characterised  after  single  and  repeated  dose  in  healthy  subjects 
and MS patients, and compared with non-pegylated interferon beta-1a as well as for the q2W 
and q4W dosing regimens and for the IM and SC route of administration.  
The  pharmacokinetic  profiles  in  MS  patients  and  healthy  subjects  were  considered  to  be 
generally similar. 
With  regards  to  BIIB017  SC  administration,  the  CHMP  noted  that  bioavailability  might  differ 
between administration sites as observed for another pegylated interferon protein (Pegasys). In 
the  pivotal  study  with  MS  patients,  BIIB017  was  injected either  in  the thigh,  arm  or  abdomen 
while in the phase 1 single- and multiple-dose studies, BIIB017 was injected in the thigh only. 
Pop PK analysis showed that injection site was not a significant covariate. Therefore, the CHMP 
considered that no differences in exposure were to be expected. 
The  two  delivery  systems,  pre-filled  syringe  (PFS)  and  pre-filled  pen  (PFP),  were  compared  in 
study  105HV103,  whereby  no  formal  statistical  testing  was  performed  as  the  study  was  not 
powered  to  show  bioequivalence  and  the  inter-subject  variability  was  high.  The  mechanism  of 
needle penetration is similar for both PFS and PFP. Patients manually insert the needle into the 
injection site to complete the needle penetration into the subcutaneous tissue. Therefore, use of 
the  PFP  was  considered  not  to  impact  the  route  or  dose  of  administration  for  delivery  of 
BIIB017 drug product. The serum levels available from study 105HV103 demonstrated that the 
drug  was  reliably  delivered  from  the  auto  injector  and  the  serum  levels  indicated  no  essential 
differences  of  clinical  relevance  between  the  two  delivery  systems.  The  CHMP  considered  the 
two  devices  qualitatively  similar  and,  since  the  formulation,  route  of  administration  and  the 
injected volume is the same, that similarity of both devices can be assumed. 
No  bioequivalence  study was  conducted  to  compare  products  manufactured  with  and  without 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 39/98 
 
  
  
serum (BIIB017-A and BIIB017-B). This was considered by the CHMP not to be a major issue 
as  it  is  not  planned  to  use  both  products  interchangeably  in  the  commercial  setting.  The 
pivotal study and its extension study used the serum-free manufactured product, which is the 
proposed commercial formulation. 
The CHMP noted that the apparent volume of distribution was considerably larger compared to 
other approved pegylated proteins, possibly due to a low bioavailability from the injection site. 
The lack of a mass balance study to characterise elimination was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP,  as,  like  for  other  proteins,  catabolism  and  excretion  are  expected  to  be  the  clearance 
mechanisms  for  peginterferon  beta 1a.  This  is  supported  by  animal  studies,  suggesting  renal 
clearance as the main elimination pathway, as well as data from the scientific literature for free 
PEG showing that hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion are minor routes for clearance.  
Elimination PK parameters showed a prolonged half-life compared to unmodified substances, as 
could be expected. 
With  regards  to  special  populations,  the  applicant  conducted  a  study  in  renally  impaired 
patients.  Increased  exposures  due  to  reduce  renal  clearance  were  observed  in  the  different 
renal  impairment  groups  compared  to  subjects  with  normal  renal  function.  To  further  explore 
the clinical relevance of this observation, the applicant referred to the comparison performed in 
different  BMI  categories  resulting  in  different  exposure  similar  to  levels  observed  for  renal 
impairment  (see  discussion  below).  Furthermore,  a  PK  simulation  comparing  MS  subjects  with 
normal and severely impaired renal function, showed that concentration-time profiles at steady 
state greatly overlapped, but an increased exposure in severely renally impaired patients could 
not be excluded. Tolerability was comparable across all groups, however, the data were limited 
due  to  the  small  size  of  the  study.  Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  a  warning  for  patients 
with severe renal impairment should be included in SmPC section 4.4, but no dose adjustment 
was considered necessary. 
The  CHMP  furthermore  noted  that  the  increased  neopterin  levels  in  patients  with  ESRD 
compared  to  patients  with  normal  renal  function  was  not  in  line  with  the  corresponding  PK 
parameters,  which  were  comparable  in  both  groups.  However,  published  data  obtained  in 
ESDR patients who had undergone haemodialysis (Fuchs et al. 1988, Estelberger et al, 1993; 
Lhee et al, 2006), showed as well high neopterin levels, which were attributed to interactions 
between  blood  coagulation  molecules  and  the  haemodialysis  membrane,  as  well  as  to  the 
activated cellular immune response to exposure to the dialysis membrane. 
No hepatic impairment study was carried out. In the SmPC, the absence of hepatic impairment 
studies  is  stated  in  the  posology  section  and  caution  and  monitoring  is  recommended  when 
administering  BIIB017  to  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment.  This  was  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP.  
The  body  mass  index  (BMI)  has  been  found  in  the  Pop  PK  model to  significantly  influence  the 
clearance and volume of distribution of BIIB017. A 50% increase in BMI corresponded to a 24% 
increase  in  clearance,  which  translates  into  a  40%  decrease  in  BIIB017  median  AUC  in  the 
highest  BMI  quintile  (80%)  in  comparison  with  the  lowest  quintile  (20%).  Post  hoc  efficacy 
subgroup analysis of data from study 105MS301 with stratification by BMI showed that a 40% 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 40/98 
 
  
  
decrease  did  not  lead  to  significant  loss  of  efficacy  and  hence  can  be  considered  not  clinically 
relevant. The CHMP agreed that no dose adjustment in relation to BMI was necessary. 
The lack of drug-drug interaction studies was considered acceptable by the CHMP. However, as 
a class, interferons are known to be weak inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 1A2. Upon request of 
the CHMP, this was reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC in line with other approved interferon 
MS products. 
There was no data on consequences of possible genetic polymorphism. An exploratory genetic 
analysis  was  planned  to  identify  genetic  factors  that  contribute  to  the  safety  and  efficacy  of 
BIIB017.  The  CHMP  requested  that  the  results  of  the  exploratory  genetic  analyses  should  be 
submitted upon completion. 
When  comparing  PD  results  with  PK  parameters  measured  in  MS  patients,  the  attainment  of 
the  peak  levels  of  neopterin  (72h)  was  delayed  in  comparison  to  that  of  the  BIIB017  serum 
levels which occurred at about 36 hours post dose. Both neopterin and serum BIIB017 levels 
reduced from Week 4 to Week 24, but the magnitude of the reduction differed. However, the 
available  clinical  data  after  2  years  treatment  with  BIIB017  did  not  suggest  a  reduction  in 
efficacy (see also section 2.5. ), which was reassuring. 
Some  differences between  neopterin  and  BIIB017  serum  levels  were  also  noted  with  regards 
to  the  area  under  the  curve  for  the  two  tested  dosing  regimens, q2W  and  q4W,  after  repeat 
dosing  (Week  24).  However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  data  obtained  in  healthy  volunteers, 
showing  similar  profile  of  gene  expression  in  peripheral  blood,  was  more  relevant.  Still,  no 
study  was  performed  on  the  relationship  between  serum  concentration  and  effect.  Additional 
analyses performed by the applicant in this context, based on the primary clinical end-points 
used  in  the  pivotal  study,  indicated  that  the  q2W  dose  produced  a  2-fold  higher  monthly 
cumulative  exposure  which  correlated  with  higher  neopterin  induction  and  less  gadolinium 
(Gd)-enhanced lesions and new/newly enlarged T2 lesions using magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI).  However  the  pivotal  trial  was  not  powered  to  detect  differences  in  the  annualized 
relapse  rates  (ARR)  between  the  two  doses.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  that  correlation 
between  exposure  and  efficacy  can  be  considered  confirmed  for  PD  parameters  (neopterin) 
and  MRI  outcomes,  but  not  for  the  most  relevant  clinical  outcomes  ARR  and  disability 
progression. The dosing regimen is further discussed in section 2.5.3.  
With regards to immunogenicity, the occurrence of antibodies was observed in several studies. 
In both dose regimens in study 105MS301, anti-interferon Nabs, which are the most relevant 
antibodies from a clinical point of view, were found in less than 1% of patients. The presence 
of non-neutralising antibodies to interferon beta-1a appeared to decrease the concentration of 
BIIB017  in  serum,  but  did  not  impact  the  pharmacological  activity  as  measure  by  neopterin 
response. The evaluation of the influence of the anti-interferon NAbs on PK and PD (neopterin) 
parameters  was  not  possible  due  to  the  low  incidence  of  NAbs  and  visit  time  for  PK  and 
neopterin  sample  collection.  Neither  could  a  reliable  estimate  be  obtained  from  Pop  PK/PD 
analysis.  Anti-PEG  antibodies  did  not  significantly  affect  BIIB017  serum  concentrations  or 
neopterin  PD  effects,  at  least  for  titer  values  ≤  800.  Overall,  based  on  the  provided  study 
results , the CHMP considered that the potential impact of antibodies is likely to be minor.  
Taken together, based on the data provided The CHMP concluded that the pharmacodynamic 
response correlates with the dose of BIIB017 in a nonlinear relationship.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted were considered satisfactory.  
As  there  were  no  data  on  consequences  of  possible  genetic  polymorphism,  the  CHMP 
recommended that the applicant should provide the results of the exploratory genetic analyses 
with the final study report of study 105MS301. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose-response studies were performed.  
In  phase  1  studies,  SC  doses  of  63,  125  and  188  µg  peginterferon  beta-1a  were  tested.  All 
doses  resulted  in  higher  exposure  than  non-pegylated  interferon  beta-1a  30  µg  IM  (Avonex) 
and were well tolerated by both healthy volunteers and subjects with renal impairment.  
A  dose  of  125  µg  every  2  weeks  (q2W)  was  chosen  for  the  phase  3  studies  as  it  provides  an 
equivalent  biological  activity  (24  MIU  per  month)  and  produces  at  least  equivalent  neopterin 
induction  over  a  4-week  dosing  interval  as  compared  to  interferon  beta-1a  30  μg  IM  once  a 
week,  which  is  an  approved  MS  treatment  (Avonex).  Furthermore,  accumulation  was  not 
observed in subjects receiving q2W dosing in phase 1 studies. A dose of 125 µg every 4 weeks 
(q4W)  was  also  included  in  phase  3  trials  to  study  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  a  lower  monthly 
dose. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Introduction 
To  support  this  application,  the  applicant  submitted  results  from  two  phase  3  studies,  study 
105MS301  (also  referred  to  as  study  301)  and  its  extension  105MS302.  Both  studies  were 
randomised, multicentre, double-blind studies, with a duration of 2 years.  
The  first  year  of  study  301  included  a  placebo  arm.  In  both  studies,  2  dosing  regimens  of 
peginterferon beta-1a were administered: once every 2 weeks (q2W) and once every 4 weeks 
(q4W).  At  the  time  of  the  application,  the  first  year  of  study  301  was  completed,  and  year  2 
was on-going. During the procedure the full 2-years of study 301 were completed.

2.5.2.1.  Study 105MS301 and 105MS302 
2.5.2.1.1.  Methods 
The  pivotal  trial  (105MS301)  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  pegylated  interferon  beta-1a 
(BIIB017) in subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis. 
The total study treatment period was 96 weeks. Year 1 of the study (Week 0 to Week 48) was 
placebo-controlled  and  double-blinded.  Year  2  of  the  study  (Week  48  to  Week  96)  was  dose-
blinded.  
At the beginning of Year 1, subjects were randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups:  
•  Placebo, 
•  BIIB017 125 μg administered once every 4 weeks, or  
•  BIIB017 125 μg administered once every 2 weeks.  
At the end of Year 1, subjects in the placebo group were re-randomised to BIIB017. 
Study 105MS302 was a dose-frequency blinded, multicenter, extension study to determine the 
long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  pegylated  interferon  beta-1a  (BIIB017)  in  subjects  with 
relapsing multiple sclerosis. The extension period is 2 years (the study was on-going at the time 
of this report). Subjects who completed study 301 were eligible to enrol in study 302 and would 
continue to receive BIIB017 in the dosing regimen followed during Year 2 of study 301.  
Study Participants  
A  total  of  1512  subjects  with  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (RRMS)  from  26  countries 
were enrolled and dosed in study 301. 
Main inclusion criteria:

randomisation (Day 1). 
Main exclusion criteria: 
- Primary progressive, secondary progressive, or progressive relapsing MS. Subjects with these 
conditions  may  also  have  had  superimposed  relapse,  but  were  distinguished  from  relapsing 
subjects by the lack of clinically stable periods or clinical improvement. 
-  Prior  treatment  with  interferon  could  not  exceed  4  weeks  and  subjects  must  have 
discontinued interferon treatment 6 months prior to Baseline. 
-  History  or  presence  of  any  clinically  significant  medical  condition  or  abnormal  laboratory 
findings  that  could  affect  subject  safety  or  interpretation  of  test  results,  including  malignant 
disease, seizure disorder or unexplained blackouts or history of a seizure, suicidal ideation or an 
episode  of  severe  depression  within  3  months  prior  to  Baseline  as  well  as  history  of  human 
immunodeficiency  virus,  history  or  positive  test  result  for  hepatitis  C  antibody,  or  current 
hepatitis B infection at screening. 
- Prior treatment with total lymphoid irradiation, cladribine, fingolimod, T cell or T cell receptor 
vaccination,  or  any 
therapeutic  monoclonal  antibody  (e.g.,  rituximab,  natalizumab, 
alemtuzumab). 
-  Prior  treatment  with  interferon  could  not  exceed  4  weeks  and  subjects  must  have 
discontinued interferon treatment 6 months prior to Baseline. 
Treatments 
All  subjects  enrolled  in  this  study  were  to  receive  a  subcutaneous  (SC)  injection  (pre-filled 
syringe)  every  2  weeks  to  maintain  the  blind,  starting  on  Day  1  and  ending  at  Week  96.  All 
three  treatment  groups  were  equally  sized  (approximately  500  patients  each).  Subjects 
randomised to BIIB017 125 μg SC every 2 weeks were to receive an injection of BIIB017 125 
μg  SC  every  2  weeks  and  subjects  randomised  to  BIIB017  125  μg  SC  every  4  weeks  were  to 
alternate  between  placebo  and  BIIB017  125  μg  SC  injections  every  2  weeks.  Subjects 
randomised  to  placebo  were  to  receive  an  injection  of  placebo  every  2  weeks.  Subjects  who 
received placebo in Year 1 were re-randomised to one of the dosing regimens (q2W or q4W) for 
BIIB017 in Year 2.  
In  order  to  mitigate  flu-like  symptoms,  all  subjects  randomised  to  receive  BIIB017  began 
treatment with a lower dose of BIIB017, starting at 63 μg and increasing in steps of 2 weeks to 
the target dose of 125 μg by Week 4. This same dose titration process was followed in Year 2 
for placebo-group subjects who were re-randomised to BIIB017.  
Subjects  were  to  participate  in  this  study  for  up  to  108  weeks  (2  years,  3  months),  which 
consisted  of  a  6-week  screening  period,  a  96-week  (2-year)  treatment  period  that  included  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 44/98 
 
  
  
 
4-week titration period, and up to a 4- or 8-week safety follow-up period for subjects who did 
not  enter  the  extension  study  under  a  separate  protocol.  Subjects  who  prematurely 
discontinued  study  treatment  and  switched  to  an  approved  open-label  MS  medication  were  to 
remain in the study for up to 24 weeks of follow-up evaluations. 
Subjects  were to  self-administer  study  treatment every  2  weeks  and  to  return  to  the  clinic  as 
scheduled  for  data  collection.  Unscheduled  relapse  assessment  visits  were  to  occur  within  72 
hours of the onset of any new neurological symptoms that might indicate the onset of a clinical 
relapse. 
Figure 4 – Study Scheme 
Treatment compliance  
Treatment  compliance  was  monitored  by  syringe-count  at  scheduled  visits  and  patient  diaries 
on  self-administration.  Patients  who  missed  more  than  2  consecutive  doses  or  more  than  4 
total doses during the study were defined as non-compliant.  
Other allowed therapies 
To  further  reduce  the  flu-like  symptoms,  patients  were  instructed  to  take  paracetamol, 
ibuprofen,  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  or  naproxen  prior  to  injection  and  for 
24 hours following each treatment injection during the first 26 weeks of the study. 
Symptomatic  therapy  was  allowed.  Protocol-approved  relapse-treatment  was  either  3  days  or 
5 days with IV methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day. Steroid re-treatment of the same relapse was 
not allowed unless approved by the advisory committee.  
Rescue medication was allowed per protocol if  
•  patients had completed 48 weeks of blinded study treatment and experienced or 2 more 
relapses confirmed by the Independent Neurology Evaluation Committee (INEC), or 
•  patients experienced significant disability progression i.e. at least a 1.0-point increase on 
the  EDSS  from  a  baseline  EDSS≥  1.0  that  was  sustained  for  12  weeks,  or  at  least  a 
1.5-point  increase  on  the  EDSS  from  a  baseline  EDSS  =  0  that  was  sustained  for 
12 weeks

In  these  cases  patients  could  either  choose  to  remain  on  study  treatment,  to  discontinue  the 
study treatment and switch to approved, open-label MS therapy or to discontinue the study and 
decline switching to another therapy.  
For relapse definition, see section on outcomes/endpoints. 
Objectives 
Study 301 
The  primary  objective  of  study  301  was  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  BIIB017  in  reducing  the 
annualized relapse rate (ARR) in subjects with RMS at 1 year. 
The  secondary  objectives  were  to  determine  whether  BIIB017,  at  1  year  as  compared  with 
placebo was effective in: 
•  Reducing the total number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain 
MRI scans; 
•  Reducing the proportion of subjects who relapsed; 
•  Slowing  the  progression  of  disability  (see  outcomes/endpoints  for  the  definition  of 
sustained progression). 
The additional, tertiary objectives of this study were to determine: 
• 
• 
• 
The safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BIIB017 over a 2-year treatment period; 
The PK and PD profile of BIIB017 in subjects with RMS; 
The maintenance of efficacy of BIIB017 over a 2-year treatment period. 
As  an  exploratory  objective,  the  potential  biomarkers  from  RNA  gene-expression  profiling  and 
serum cytokine/chemokine panel that may be associated with treatment response to BIIB017, 
as  well  as  potential  genetic  polymorphisms  from  DNA  that  may  be  associated  with  treatment 
response to BIIB017, were to be determined. 
Study 302 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of 
BIIB017 in subjects originally treated in Study 105MS301 who continue BIIB017 treatment. 
The  secondary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  describe  the  long-term  multiple  sclerosis  (MS) 
outcomes in subjects originally treated in Study 105MS301 who continue BIIB017 treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Study 301 
The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 1 year.  
Secondary endpoints were in order of  relative importance: 
•  Number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at 1 year; 
•  Proportion of subjects relapsing at 1 year; 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 46/98 
 
  
  
•  Disability progression measured by EDSS at 1 year. 
Tertiary endpoints included the above mentioned endpoints at year 2 as well as the number of 
Gd-enhancing lesions at 1 year and the number of new T1 hypointense lesions at 1 year. Other 
tertiary endpoints included clinical measures (such as relapses requiring steroid use, MS-related 
hospitalizations, Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite); MRI measures (including new active 
lesions,  lesion  volumes,  brain  atrophy,  and  magnetization  transfer  ratio);  and  assessments  of 
cognition, visual function, and various patient-reported outcomes relevant to MS. 
Study 302 
Study  302  employed  the  same  endpoints  as  study  301.  These  endpoints  were  analysed  at 
baseline and the Week 48 and Week 96 visits. 
Definitions of MS relapses 
A relapse was documented when a subject informed study site personnel of any symptoms that 
might indicate that a relapse was occurring or had occurred. 
All relapses: Any event suspected of being a relapse by a subject whether or not the event met 
the criteria for protocol-defined or INEC-confirmed relapse. 
Protocol-defined relapses: New or recurrent neurologic symptoms not associated with fever or 
infection,  lasting  at  least  24  hours,  with  onset  more  than  30  days  after  the  last  relapse,  and 
accompanied  by  new  objective  neurological  findings  upon  examination  by  the  examining 
neurologist. Protocol-defined relapses may or may not have been confirmed by INEC. 
INEC-confirmed relapses (only for study 301): protocol-defined relapses that were evaluated by 
3 INEC members and confirmed by a majority vote (2 out of 3 members confirmed the event as 
a MS relapse). Only INEC-confirmed relapses were included in the primary endpoint analysis. 
Relapses not evaluated by the treating neurologist within 72 hours of onset of symptoms or not 
evaluated by the examining neurologist within 5 days of onset of of symptoms were not sent to 
INEC for confirmation, and could not be INEC confirmed. 
Definition of disability progression 
The outcome measure was the sustained disability progression, defined as a 1.0 point increase 
on  EDSS  score  from  baseline  (for  baseline  EDSS  score  ≥1.0)  or  1.5  point  increase  on  EDSS 
score  from  baseline  (for  baseline  EDSS  score  =  0)  and  this  increase  in  EDSS  score  had  to 
persist for at least 12 weeks (study 301). In study 302, disability progression had to persist for 
24 weeks. 
Sample size 
Sample size calculation was based on the type I error rate of 0.05 and a dropout rate of 10%. 
It was assumed that the treatment effect for BIIB017 would be a 32% reduction from placebo 
in the Year 1 ARR. 
Initially, a sample size of 420 per treatment group was planned to provide approximately 90%, 
87%,  and  85%  power  when  the  placebo  Year  1  annualized  relapse  rate  is  0.6,  0.55,  or  0.5, 
respectively.  Following  blinded  monitoring  of  the  pooled  Year  1  ARR,  the  sample  size  was 
increased from 420 to 500 subjects per group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1

Randomisation 
Randomisation to one of the three treatment groups in year 1 was done in a 1:1:1 ratio using a 
centralized  interactive  voice/web  response  system.  Randomisation  was  stratified  by  study 
centre.  After  completion  of  Year  1,  subjects  on  the  placebo  group  were  re-randomised  to 
receive BIIB017 every 2 or 4 weeks for the duration of Year 2, and the extension study 302. 
Blinding (masking)  
Study 301 was a double-blind, rater-blinded study. All subjects and study staff were blinded to 
the  treatment  assignment.  Patients  receiving  BIIB017  once  in  4  weeks  received  placebo 
injection  every  2  weeks  in  order  to  maintain  the  blind.  On  the  second  year  of  the  study,  the 
blinding of dosing frequency was sustained but patients were told that they received the active 
treatment. 
As  for  study  301,  in  study  302,  subjects,  study  staff  and  examining  physicians  are  blinded  to 
dose frequency and clinical assessment is performed by blinded neurologists. 
Statistical methods 
All  efficacy  endpoints  were  evaluated  on  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  including  all 
randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment (BIIB017 or placebo). In 
addition,  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  also  analysed  based  on  the  per-
protocol  (PP)  population,  defined  as  a  subset  of  the  ITT  population  without  major  protocol 
deviation. The analyses performed on the ITT population were considered the primary analyses, 
and the analyses based on the PP population were considered supportive. 
While  statistical  comparisons  were  made  between  the  placebo  and  BIIB017  groups  during  the 
placebo-controlled  period  in  Year  1,  data  from  Year  2  were  descriptive  only,  and  unless 
otherwise specified, no formal comparisons were made between the treatment groups.  
Due  to  the  multiplicity  of  endpoints  and  dose  regimens,  a  hierarchical  testing  procedure  was 
used to control the type I error rate for the primary and secondary endpoints: For the primary 
endpoint,  the  BIIB017  q2W  group  was  compared  to  placebo  and  if  the  difference  was 
statistically  significant  (p ≤0.050),  then  the  comparison  of  BIIB017  q4W  versus  placebo  could 
also be performed and considered statistically significant if p ≤0.05. Secondary endpoints were 
ranked  and  each  dose  group  was  compared  to  placebo  in  the  same  manner  as  the  primary 
endpoint.  If  statistical  significance  was  not  achieved  for  an  endpoint  for  a  particular  dose 
frequency  group,  all  comparisons  for  endpoint(s)  of  lower  rank  for  that  dose  frequency  group 
were not considered statistically significant. 
The  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  used  negative  binominal  regression  on  INEC-confirmed 
relapses with time of study as offset parameter. In case of under-dispersion or if the negative 
binominal  regression  model  did  not  converge,  a  Poisson  regression  model  was  used  instead. 
Dispersion was evaluated from the Pearson Chi-Square statistic. The response variable was the 
total  number  of  relapses. Logarithmic  transformation  of  the  time on  study  was  included  as  an 
independent  variable  in  the  model.  The  model  variables  included  treatment,  baseline  relapse 
rate, age (<40 vs. >40) and EDSS (<4 vs. >4).   
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 48/98 
 
  
  
Negative binominal regression was also used to analyse the number of new or newly enlarging 
T2  hyperintense  lesions  at  1  year,  while  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  was  applied to the 
other two secondary endpoints.  
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the rate ratio were provided for the comparisons of 
each active treatment versus placebo. The estimated relapse rate and its 2-sided 95% CIs and 
the gross estimate of ARR are provided for each treatment group.

Participant flow in study 105MS301 for Year 1 
Recruitment 
The  study  started  on  13  March  2009  and  the  placebo-controlled  phase  of  the  study  (Year  1) 
was completed on 24 October 2012.  
A  total  of  1936  subjects  were  screened  for  enrolment  in  study  301.  Of  these,  1516  subjects 
were randomised, 1512 subjects received at least 1 dose of study treatment, and 1332 subjects 
completed Year 1. Of the subjects who received BIIB017 during Year 1, a total of 876 subjects 
continued treatment in Year 2 at the same dose (438 in each dose group). The 456 subjects in 
the placebo group who completed Year 1 were re-randomised to the BIIB017 treatment groups,

with 228 subjects in the q2W and q4W group, respectively. A total of 1198 patients completed 
study  Year  2  (200  and  196  patients  who  switched  from  placebo  to  BIIB017  q2W  and  q4W, 
respectively, and 391 and 411 patients continuing on BIIB017 q2W and q4W, respectively). 
Study  302  was  on-going  at  the  time  of  this  report.  At  the  time  of  data  cutoff  (24  October 
2012), 517 subjects had entered study 302, and 508 subjects had received at least 1 dose of 
study  treatment.  Only  17  subjects  in  the  BIIB017  q4W  and  13  subjects  in  the  BIIB017  q2W 
groups who were continuously exposed to BIIB017 in study 301 had completed Year 1 of study 
302 and consequently had 3 years of exposure to BIIB017. 
Conduct of the study 
Study 301 and 302 were performed in 26 countries world-wide including countries in Europe. 
Enrolment  began  under  global  protocol  Version  1,  dated  13  March  2009.  The  protocol  was 
subsequently  amended  4  times  with  all  changes  made  to  the  protocols  occurring  prior  to 
breaking  the  blind  of  the  study.  In  the  latest  protocol  update,  the  age  limit  for  subject 
enrolment  into  the  study  was  increased  to  include  patients  of  56-65  years  of  age  to  better 
reflect the age range of the treated MS population. 
All patients who completed study 301 were eligible for the extension study 302 thus the study 
population originates from the same geographic areas. Study 302 was initiated in 2011. 
Baseline data 
See  Table  3  and  Table  4  for  an  overview  of  patient  demographics  and  baseline  disease 
characteristics and MRI evaluation. 
Geographically,  70%  of  subjects  in  the  ITT  population  were  from  Eastern  Europe  (Bulgaria, 
Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, 
Serbia,  and  the  Ukraine),  11%  were  from  India,  8%  were  from  Western  Europe  (Belgium, 
France,  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  Spain,  and  the  UK),  7%  were  from  the  rest  of  the  world 
(Chile, Colombia, Georgia, Mexico, New Zealand, and Peru), and 3% were from North America 
(Canada  and  the  US).  Therefore,  the  majority  of  the  recruited  patients  represented  the 
European target population [1183 (78%) out of 1512 patients]. 
With  regards  to  patient  demographics,  the  majority  of  patients  were  Caucasians  (82%)  and 
females (71%). The mean age was 36.5 years. Less than 1% of the patients were over the age 
of 59.  
The  mean  EDSS  score  at  baseline  was  2.46  representing  mild  to  moderate  neurological 
impairment. A total of 436 patients with EDSS scores ≥3.5 were included. The mean number of 
relapses  within  the  past  year  was  1.5.  The  mean  time  since  the  occurrence  of  the  first 
symptoms of MS was 6.6 years, with a wide range of individual subject values (0 to 40 years). 
The mean time since MS diagnosis was 3.6 years (range: 0 to 40 years). 
With regard to MRI parameters, the majority of subjects (61%) had no Gd-enhancing lesions at 
baseline. Compared with placebo and BIIB017 q4W, slightly more subjects in the BIIB017 q2W 
had no Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline (59%, 59%, and 65%, respectively). The overall mean 
number of Gd-enhancing lesions was 1.5. The mean number of Gd-enhancing lesions was 1.6, 
1.8 and 1.2 in the placebo group, the BIIB017 q4W and the BIIB017 q2W groups, respectively. 
The  mean  number  of  T2  hyperintense  lesions  at  baseline  was  50.6,  51.4,  and  48.7  in  the

placebo, BIIB017 q4W and BIIB017 q2W groups, respectively. The overall mean number of T2 
hyperintense  lesions  was  50.2.  Overall,  a  majority of  subjects  (92%)  had  ≥9  T2  hyperintense 
lesions at baseline. The percentage of subjects with ≥9 T2 hyperintense lesions at baseline was 
94%, 93%, and 90% in the placebo, BIIB017 q4W and BIIB017 q2W groups, respectively. 
Of  the  1512  patients  included  in  the  ITT  population,  the  majority  were  naïve  to  previous  MS 
medication  (83%).  The  most  common  pre-study  MS  medication  was  glatiramer  acetate  (5%), 
corticosteroids (4%), followed by interferon beta-1b and azathioprine (1% of subjects each). 
The  medications  most  frequently  used  (≥10%  of  subjects)  in  Year  1  included  paracetamol 
(88%),  ibuprofen  (37%),  methylprednisolone  (22%),  and  omeprazole  (10%).  Paracetamol, 
ibuprofen,  naproxen,  and  aspirin  were  protocol-specified  medications  that  subjects  were 
instructed  to  take  for  the  first  26  weeks  of  the  study  to  reduce  flu-like  symptoms,  and 
additional  dosing  was  allowed  as  necessary.  Methylprednisolone  for  the  treatment  of  an  MS 
relapse  while  on  blinded  treatment  was  used  by  more  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (29%) 
compared to BIIB017 q4W (21%) and BIIB017 q2W (17%). 
Concomitant medications used by ≥10% of subjects in Year 2 included paracetamol, being the 
most commonly used (81% of subjects) followed by ibuprofen (33%), and methylprednisolone 
(16%).  
In  Year  1,  16  subjects  (1%)  of  the  ITT  population  switched  to  open-label  treatment  with 
approved  alternative  MS  medications.  Interferon  beta-1a,  glatiramer  acetate,  and  interferon 
beta-1b were the alternative MS medications most commonly used.

*Completed Year 2 as of the data cut-off date, 24 October 2012 
Numbers analysed 
Of  the  1516  subjects  randomised  for  the  study,  4  subjects  were  never  treated  (3  had  been 
randomised  in  error,  and  1  reported  a  pre-treatment  adverse  event  and  became  ineligible  to 
participation in the study). The 1512 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment 
comprised the ITT and safety populations.  
The PP population included 1465 subjects (97%) overall with 482, 486, and 497 subjects in the 
placebo, BIIB017 every 4 weeks, and BIIB017 every 2 weeks groups, respectively.

Data  were  analysed  for  the  study  302  ITT  population,  which  included  247  subjects  in  the 
BIIB017 q4W and 261 subjects in the BIIB017 q2W at the time of data cut-off.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The  adjusted  ARR  at  Year  1  was  0.397  in  the  placebo  group,  0.288  in  the  BIIB017  q4W  arm 
and  0.256  in  the  BIIB017  q2W  arm,  translating  into  a  reduction  of  27.5%  and  35.6%  in  the 
active treatment groups, respectively (see Table 5), compared to placebo. The improvement in 
ARR  for  both  BIIB017  treatment  arms  was  statistically  significant  with  slightly  numerically 
better results for the higher BIIB017 dose (q2W).

There was a higher relapse rate in the placebo group, but relapse rates were in general low in 
al  there  groups.  Table  6  provides  an  overview  of  the  reported  relapses  in  each  group  during 
Year 1 (see section 2.5.2.1.1. , outcomes/endpoints, for the definition of relapses). Most of the 
patients  in  all  treatment  groups  experienced  zero  relapses  (placebo:  72%,  BIIB017  every  4 
weeks: 79%, BIIB017 every 2 weeks: 82%).

A  post-hoc  analysis  of  study  participation  status  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  early  withdrawal  on 
the primary endpoint showed a similar trend in reduction of ARR compared to all subjects in the 
primary analysis. 
Furthermore,  results  of  an  analysis  of  adverse  events  known  to  occur  in  subjects  receiving 
interferon treatment, including influenza-like symptoms and injection-site reactions, to evaluate 
the effect of potential un-blinding of subjects or investigators on the primary endpoint at Year 1 
showed consistency with the conclusions from the primary analysis. 
Figure 5 provides an overview of the ARR by study year.  
For  patients  who  received  BIIB017  q4W,  the  ARR  in  Year  2  seemed  to  be  comparable  to  the 
ARR  in  Year  1.  For  patients  who  received  BIIB017  q2W,  the  ARR  in  Year  2  seemed to  show  a 
reduction compared to the ARR in Year 1.  
Also  for  patients  who  received  placebo  in  Year  1  and  who  were  re-randomized  to  BIIB017  in 
year 2, the ARR in Year 2 was lower than the ARR in Year 1.

Secondary endpoints 
•  Number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at 1 year 
The adjusted mean number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was 10.9 in the 
placebo group, compared to 7.9 in subjects who received BIIB017 q4W and 3.6 in subjects who 
received  BIIB017  q2W  (see  Table  7).  Treatment  with  BIIB017  q4W  and  BIIB017  q2W 
significantly  reduced  the  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions  that 
developed  over  1  year  by  28%  (p=0.0008)  and  67%  (p<0.0001),  respectively,  compared  to 
placebo, which was statistically significant.

Sensitivity analyses also provided statistically significant results for both active treatment arms 
in comparison to placebo. 
Among  the  subjects  who  continued  into  Year  2  of  the  study,  the  effect  of  BIIB017  on  the 
occurrence of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was maintained in subjects who 
continued to receive BIIB017. Subjects who started on BIIB017 in Year 2 saw improvements as 
compared to Year 1. 
•  Proportion of subjects relapsing at 1 year 
The  proportion  of  subjects  that  relapsed  at  Year  1  was  0.291  in  the  placebo  group  compared 
with 0.222 in the BIIB017 q4W group and 0.187 in the BIIB017 q2W group (see Table 8). The 
hazard  ratios  were  0.74  for  the  BIIB017  q4W  group  versus  placebo  and  0.61  for  the  BIIB017 
q2W  group  versus  placebo.  The  risk  of  relapse  was  statistically  significantly  reduced  by  26% 
(p = 0.0200) following treatment with BIIB017 q4W and 39% (p = 0.0003) following treatment 
with BIIB017 q4W.

Similar results were obtained for the PP population analysis and a sensitivity analysis using all 
relapses.  
Kaplan-Meier plots (see Figure 6) of the time to first relapse revealed a separation between the 
curves of the two active arms around Week 36, which is maintained over time.

•  Disability progression measured by EDSS at 1 year 
Disability progression was measured in terms of 12 weeks confirmed increase in EDSS score. 
The proportion of subjects with sustained disability progression at Year 1 was 0.105 in the 
placebo group as compared to 0.068 in both BIIB017 q4W and BIIB017 q2W (Table 9). The risk 
of progression of disability over 1 year was reduced by 38% following treatment with BIIB017 
q4W and 38% following treatment with BIIB017 q2W relative to placebo. Both active treatment 
arms reached statistical significance when compared to placebo.

Further to a request by the CHMP, the applicant provided additional analyses applying a 
definition of sustained worsening in line with the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (CPMP/EWP/561/98 Rev. 1) as 
follows:  
- increase of the EDSS score of 1.0 point from baseline (if the baseline EDSS score was ≤5.5) 
or increase by 0.5 point from baseline (if the baseline EDSS score was >5.5); 
- increase of EDSS score as defined above persisting for 6 months (24 Weeks). 
The results of this analysis are shown in Table 10. 
Table 10 - Confirmed Disability Progression 
The  Kaplan-Meier  plots  for  patients  with  sustained  disability  progression  over  time  revealed  a 
separation between the placebo group and the 2 BIIB017 groups from Week 12 through Week 
48  both  for  the  original  definition  of  sustained  disability  progression  (see  Figure  7)  and  the 
alternate  definition  in  line  with  the  multiple  sclerosis  guideline  (see  Figure  8).  However,  when 
calculating  disability  progression  sustained  over  24  weeks,  only  results  for  BIIB017  q2W,  but 
not for q4W, were statistically significantly better than placebo (see also Table 10).

The mean number of Gd-enhancing lesions in the placebo group was 1.4, compared to 0.9 and 
0.2  in  the  BIIB017  q4W  and  in  the  BIIB017  q2W  group,  respectively.  The  difference  was  only 
statistically significant for BIIB017 q2W (p <0.0001). 
The mean number of new T1 hypointense lesions was 3.8 in the placebo group and 3.1 in the 
BIIB017 q4W group at Week 48 and was significantly lower in the BIIB017 q2W group (mean 
1.8).  This  translated  into  a  reduction  of  new  T1  hypointense  in  Year  1  of  18%  (p=0.0815) 
under  treatment  with  BIIB017  q4W  and  53%  (p<0.0001)  in  the  BIIB017  q2W  group 
respectively,  compared  to  placebo.  Only  the  difference  for  BIIB017  q2W  was  statistically 
significant. 
Tertiary  endpoints  relating  to  2-year  results  for  outcome  measures  representing  primary  and 
secondary  endpoints  at  Year  1  are  summarised  together  with  results  of  the  primary  and 
secondary endpoints (see above). 
Interim results for study 302 
At  Year  1  in  study  302,  30  subjects  in  the  BIIB017  q4W  group  had  experienced  37  relapses, 
and  14  subjects  in  the  BIIB017  q2W  group  had  experienced  18  relapses.  The  corresponding 
adjusted ARR were 0.410 in the BIIB017 q4W group and 0.203 in the BIIB017 q2W group. 
The estimated proportion of subjects relapsed at Week 36 was 0.186 and 0.104 in the BIIB017 
q4W and q2W groups, respectively.  
At the time of data cut-off, 24-week sustained disability progression (based on combined study 
301 and 302 data) had been confirmed for 21 subjects (8.5%) in the BIIB017 q4W group and 
16 subjects (6.1%) in the BIIB017 q2W group.

Among the 37 subjects with available MRI data at the time of data cut-off, a mean of 3.7 new 
or newly enlarging T2 lesions was detected among the 19 subjects in the BIIB017 q4W group, 
and a mean of 1.1 lesions was detected among the 18 subjects in the BIIB017 q2W group. 
Discontinuation 
The majority of discontinued subjects were patients who withdrew their consent. The majority 
of these patients withdrew due to personal reasons, which included relocation, wish to receive 
approved  MS  treatment,  wish  not  to  receive  placebo,  plans  of  pregnancy  and  other.  A  limited 
number  of  patients  withdrew  due  to lack  of  efficacy  (9,  5  and  5  in the  placebo  group  and the 
BIIB017  q4W  and  q2W  groups,  respectively).  Discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  is 
presented in section 2.6.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
The  applicant  performed  a  number  of  subgroup  analyses  for  the  most  important  clinical 
endpoints  in  study  301.  The  results  of  the  analysis  of  ARR  in  the  BIIB017  groups  were  in 
general similar among the demographics (gender, age, weight, geographic origin) and baseline 
disease characteristics subgroups.  
In the subgroup analysis of patients with different numbers of relapses within 3 years prior to 
study  entry,  patients  that  had  suffered  4  or  more  relapses  showed  results  comparable  to 
placebo.  However,  the  number  of  patients  in  this  subgroup  was  rather  small  (66  patients 
receiving placebo, 52 patients receiving active treatment).  
With regards to 3-month sustained disability progression, results for patients without prior MS 
treatment  favoured  active  treatment  against  placebo  for  both  dosing  regimens.  No  treatment 
effect was detected for BIIB017 in the subgroup of patients who already were treated with MS 
substances. However, the number of patients in this subgroup was rather small.  
Immunogenicity 
The  MAH  investigated  the  impact  of  immunogenicity  on  the  efficacy  of  BIIB017  for  BAbs  to 
interferon beta-1a, NAbs to interferon beta-1a, and BAbs to PEG (anti-PEG). Subjects who were 
positive at any time point during Year 1, including baseline, were categorized as ‘ever positive’ 
to  assess  the  impact  of  antibodies  on  efficacy.  In  the  BIIB017  q4W  and  q2W  groups, 
respectively,  28/500  subjects  (6%)  and  54/512  subjects  (11%)  were  ever  positive  for  anti- 
interferon  BAbs,  4/500  subjects  (0.8%)  and  12/512  subjects  (2.3%)  were  ever  positive  for 
anti-interferon  NAbs,  and  70/500  subjects  (14%)  and  56/512  subjects  (11%)  were  ever 
positive for anti-PEG antibodies. Although the impact on efficacy measurements was difficult to 
interpret  due  to  the low  incidence  of  antibodies  found,  the  unadjusted  ARR  at  1  year  for  both 
groups of BIIB017-treated subjects who were ‘ever positive’ or ‘never positive’ was lower than 
the ARR observed for placebo-treated subjects.  
Dosing regimens 
A direct comparison of the two dosing regimens showed that dosing every 2 weeks resulted into 
better efficacy compared to q4W for all main endpoints.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical efficacy studies in special populations were performed. A study in paediatric patients 
above 10 years of age will be performed according to the paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
Considering the target population for interferons, a specific study in elderly was not considered 
necessary by the applicant.  
The  applicant  has  performed  a  phase  1  PK/PD  study  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (see 
discussion on clinical pharmacology in section 2.4.4. ). 
Supportive study(ies) 
The  main  interim  results  of  study  302  were  presented  with  the  results  of  study  301,  as 
relevant. At the time the interim analysis was provided, the study was still on-going.

A small usability study (n=39) was performed (as a sub-study of study 302) to assess the ease 
of use of the auto-injector device (pre-filled pen) as well as its safety as compared to the pre-
filled syringe. No comparisons on exposure or efficacy were made. Based on the results derived 
from  patient  questionnaires,  the  majority  of  patients  found  the  device  easy  to  use.  However, 
the  study  did  not  include  any  comparisons  between  the  auto-injector  and  pre-filled  syringe  in 
terms of ease of use.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Peginterferon beta-1a  is  a  new  formulation  of  an  existing,  established  class  of  products  in  the 
treatment  of  multiple  sclerosis  (MS),  beta  interferons.  In  light  of  the  extensive  experience 
gained  with  this  class,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  requirements  laid  down  in  the 
current  MS  guideline  (CHMP  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the 
treatment  of  multiple  sclerosis,  CPMP/EWP/561/98  Rev.  1)  would  apply  only  partially,  for 
example in terms of study duration and the duration of placebo control. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No  conventional  dose-response  studies  were  performed.  The  lack  of  such  studies  was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP, as the main clinical studies included 2 dose regimens, once 
every  2  weeks  (q2W)  and  once  every  4  weeks  (q4W),  with  a  two-fold  difference  in  exposure. 
The  justification  for  selection  of  125 μg  as  the  maintenance  dose  in  the  pivotal  trial  was  also 
considered acceptable in light of the fact that no accumulation was observed in PK studies. 
In  support  of  this  application,  results  from  two  phase  3  studies,  301  and  its  extension  302, 
were provided. Both studies were randomised, multicentre, double-blind studies with a duration 
of 2 years, whereby the first year of study 301 included a placebo arm.  
Overall, the study design and methodology was considered acceptable. 
The studied patient population with respect to patient demographics and disease characteristics 
was considered by the CHMP to be generally in line with the expected MS patient population to 
use interferons. A sufficiently high number of patients from the European target population was 
included in the trial. Generally, all treatment groups were comparable with respect to baseline 
disease characteristics. The mean age of 36.5 years was considered acceptable, but the CHMP 
requested  to  reflect  the  limited  data  in  patients  over  the  age  of  59  years  in  the  product 
information. Of note, patients had rather mild disease activity at the time of enrolment and the 
majority were naïve to previous MS treatments.  
The CHMP furthermore noted, that, based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, only patients with 
relapsing-remitting  MS  (RRMS)  were  included,  which  was  not  in  line  with  the  initially  claimed 
target  population  of  relapsing  MS  (RMS)  patients.  The  applicant  argued  that  one  in  five 
recruited  subjects  could  actually  be  considered  most  similar  to  patients  with  secondary 
progressive  MS  (SPMS).  While  the  CHMP  agreed  that  for  some  patients  the exact  definition  of 
RRMS  and  SPMS  may  be  difficult  to  achieve,  in  order  to  extend  the  indication  to  a  wider 
population,  efficacy  would  have  needed  to  be  demonstrated  in  a  clearly  defined  population  of 
SPMS patients with superimposed relapse. However, no subgroup analysis was provided by the 
applicant to that effect.

EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 65/98 
 
  
  
The  studies  did  not  include  an  active  comparator.  The  applicant’s  original  plan  was  to  include 
non-pegylated  beta  interferon-1a  (Avonex)  as  an  active  arm.  The  reasoning  for  dropping  the 
active  arm  from  the  final  investigational  plan  was  not  clarified.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the 
lack  of  an  active  comparator  makes  it  difficult  to  conclude  if  the  efficacy  of  peginterferon 
beta-1a is the same as of other beta interferons products, an issue which is  further discussed 
below.  
Both studies covered a period of 2 years, which is in line with the current recommendation for 
MS  studies.  However,  the  efficacy  claim  was  primarily  supported  by  the  one-year  placebo-
controlled data derived from study 301. Two year efficacy data were provided during the course 
of the assessment, which was considered sufficient by the CHMP to provide supportive data for 
the demonstration of maintenance of the effect. 
The  primary  endpoint,  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR),  is  the  recommended  endpoint  for  MS 
studies in the chosen population. The chosen definition of relapses was in accordance with the 
widely  accepted  clinical  definition.  Disability  (3-month  sustained  disability  progression)  was 
included  as  a  secondary  endpoint,  however,  it  was  only  ranked  3rd  among  the  secondary 
endpoints.  In  this  assessment,  disability  was  considered  to  be  the  most  important  secondary 
endpoint.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP  noted  that  the  applied  definition  of  sustained  disability 
progression  was  unconventional  and  not  in  line  with  the  MS  guideline  as  regards  the  required 
increase in EDSS score based on baseline EDSS as well as duration of persistence of disability 
worsening  (3 months versus 6 months). Hence, the applicant was requested to re-analyse the 
data in line with the guideline requirements. Finally, several MRI endpoints provided supportive 
efficacy data. These were considered adequate by the CHMP. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy  in  terms  of  ARR  for  RRMS  patients  was  demonstrated  with  both  dosing  regimens  of 
peginterferon beta-1a over a study period of one year in the placebo-controlled study 301. The 
effect size was modest, i.e. an ARR of 0.40 for placebo versus 0.26 and 0.29, for peginterferon 
beta-1a q2W  and  peginterferon  beta-1a q4W,  respectively.  However  the  relative  effect  size  of 
around  30%  reduction  in relapse  rate  was  comparable  to  that of  other interferons,  which  was 
considered clinically relevant.   
Efficacy  was  also  investigated  for  sustained  disability  progression  over  1  year  as  defined  in 
study 301 as well as when applying the proposed definition according to the MS guideline (post 
hoc analysis upon CHMP request). When applying the definition of 24-week sustained disability 
progression,  the  effect  size  was  smaller  compared  to  the  results  from  the  primary  analysis. 
Furthermore,  for  the  q4W  regimen,  statistical  significance  was  not  achieved.  From  this 
sensitivity  analysis  it  can  be  concluded  that  efficacy  in  preventing  disability  progression 
(although smaller in size) over 1 year was confirmed for the Q2W regimen while data for Q4W 
were less convincing. 
Efficacy was also investigated for MRI endpoints. BIIB017 treatment with both dosing regimens 
resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the  number  of  new  or  newly  enlarging  T2 
hyperintense  lesions  compared  to  placebo.  However,  only  the  BIIB017  q2W  regimen 
demonstrated  statistically  significant  differences  against  placebo  on  the  endpoints  of 
Gd-enhancing lesions and T1 hypointense lesions at Year 1, but not the q4W regimen.

Data  over  the  full  2-year  treatment  period  were  considered  by  the  CHMP  supportive  of  the 
maintenance of the treatment effect of BIIB017 seen at Year 1.  
Sub-group  analyses  revealed  generally  similar  results  with  regard  to  demographics  (gender, 
age, weight, geographic origin) and baseline disease characteristics. However, in the subgroup 
of  patients  with  the  highest  number  of  relapses  (≥  4)  in  the  3  years  prior  to  study  entry,  no 
effect  of  BIIB017  was  seen  neither  with  regard  to  ARR  nor  disability  progression.  While  the 
number  of  patients  was  too  small  to  draw  firm  conclusions,  in  light  of  the  fact  that  the  study 
participants  generally  presented  with  mild  disease  activity,  the  CHMP  considered  that  clear 
information  on  the  available  data  should  be  provided  in  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  to  inform 
prescribers.  Furthermore,  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  received  disease  modifying  MS 
treatment prior to study start, no effect of BIIB017 compared to placebo was seen with regard 
to sustained disability progression. However, these results are probably explained by the rather 
small number of patients in this subgroup.  
No  discernible  negative  impact  on  primary  or  secondary  endpoints  of  clinical  efficacy  was 
associated with antibodies against either interferon beta-1a or PEG. 
With  regard  to  the  tested  dosing  regimens,  the  CHMP  considered  that,  generally,  the  two 
regimens  showed  comparable  effect  sizes  at  Year  1  with  slightly  better  results  for  the  q2W 
scheme.  Comparative  efficacy  analyses  for  clinical  and  key  MRI  outcomes  performed  post-hoc 
supported the  position  that  the  q2W  regimen  could  be  advantageous  as  compared  to  the  less 
frequent q4W dosing regimen. The difference between the two regimens increase with time of 
treatment,  at  least  in  terms  of  ARR  and  disability  progression,  but  remained  overall  rather 
small. Taken together, from an efficacy point of view, the CHMP considered the proposed dose 
regimen of 125 μg every 2 weeks acceptable and preferable over the q4W dosing schedule. 
Finally,  the  CHMP  discussed  the  impact  of  the  absence  of  an  active  comparator  in  the  pivotal 
study, which raised the question if the efficacy of peginterferon beta-1a was comparable to that 
of other interferon beta products. To address this question, the applicant performed an across-
study  comparison  of  efficacy  and  safety  data  between  peginterferon  beta-1a  and  the  non-
pegylated beta-interferons as well as other MS products available in the EU at the time of this 
report.  However,  indirect  comparison  to  historical  data  was  considered  problematic  due  to 
differences  in  the  MS  patient  populations  recruited  in  these  studies,  background  therapy, 
endpoints (3 month- or 6 month sustained disability progression), duration of the studies (one 
or  two  years)  and  standards  of  care.  Still,  with  all  caveats  of  such  a  comparison,  the  CHMP 
agreed that the relative reduction of ARR and time to sustained disability progression observed 
for peginterferon beta-1a and the non-pegylated beta-interferons were in a comparable range, 
which  provides  some  reassurance.  Overall,  as  superiority  of  BIIB017  over  placebo  has  been 
shown for the duration of one year, and was supported by 2 years of data on maintenance of 
effect,  the  lack  of  an  active  comparator  was  not  considered  an  essential  issue  with  respect  to 
establishing efficacy of Plegridy.  
However,  since  the  magnitude  of  effect of  beta interferons  is  modest,  any  potential  difference 
in  the  effect  size  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  critical  with  a  view  to  switching  patients 
from  one  interferon  product  to  the  other.  Given  the  fact  that  peginterferon  beta-1a  is 
recommended  to  be  given  subcutaneously  every  2  weeks,  while  non-pegylated  interferon 
beta-1a  has  to  be  injected  more  frequently  (e.g.  Avonex  IM  injection  once  a  week),  switches 
Assessment report

Page 67/98 
 
  
  
from  non-pegylated  interferons  to  peginterferon  beta-1a,  once  available,  may  occur.  While  it 
was  acknowledged  by  the  CHMP  that  loss  of  efficacy  could  be  difficult  to  detect  in  clinical 
practice, especially in a rather mild MS patient population as relapses usually occur infrequently 
and  even  in  some  cases  with  years  in  between  consecutive relapses,  comparative  data  would 
have  been  valuable  for  prescribers  and  patients.  Since  the  active  principle  and  mechanism  of 
action of pegylated and non-pegylated interferons are the same, clinical data focussing on MRI 
endpoints to assess the relative anti-inflammatory effect may have been considered to indicate 
comparable  efficacy.  However,  the  CHMP  pointed  out  that  this  was  a  specific  case  and  that, 
generally,  clinical  endpoints  in  line  with  the  CHMP  MS  guideline  have  to  be  investigated  to 
establish patient benefit of a new active substance in the treatment of MS and that approval of 
disease-modifying therapies based only on MRI endpoints would not be acceptable.  
Taken  together,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  SmPC  should  provide  adequate 
information  in  sections  4.2  and  5.1  on  the  lack  of  comparative  clinical  data,  which  should  be 
considered when switching patients between pegylated and non-pegylated interferons.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considered that the data provided demonstrated efficacy of Plegridy, at the proposed 
maintenance dose of 125 μg SC every 2 weeks, in patients with RRMS as compared to placebo 
for a one-year study period. Efficacy was shown in terms of effects on the ARR and on disability 
progression,  with  a  modest  effect  size  that  seemed  to  be  comparable  to  that  of  already 
approved  interferon  beta  products.  However,  the  effect  on  disability  progression  was  not 
considered  to  have  robustly  been  shown  and  therefore  did  not  support  a  specific  claim  in  the 
indication.  The  placebo-controlled  study  period  of  one  year  was  considered  to  be  sufficient  in 
this  particular  case  of  a  pegylated  form  of  interferon  beta-1a,  a  well-known  class  of  MS 
products  for  which  extensive  clinical  experience  exists.  Data  for  2 years  treatment  supported 
maintenance of the effect beyond year 1.  
Unfortunately,  the  relative  efficacy  of  pegylated  and  non-pegylated interferon beta-1a  has  not 
been  directly  investigated,  although  this  information  would  have  been  valuable  for  treating 
physicians and patients when switching between these treatments.  
Altogether the CHMP considered the data from the clinical development programme satisfactory 
to support an indication of Plegridy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety development program focused on the results of the phase  3 study 301 and 
its  extension  302,  forming  the  integrated  safety  database  of  BIIB017.  Doses  administered 
during  these  studies  were  125  µg  SC  in  two  dosing  regimens,  q4W  or  q2W  (see  section 
2.5.2.1.1.  for a detailed description of the study design and methodology).  
Results of the phase 1 clinical studies were considered to be supportive and employed different 
doses  and  routes  of  administration  (105HV101,  105HV102),  safety  of  a  prefilled  pen 
(autoinjector  in  Study  105HV103),  and  safety  of  BIIB017  in  a  special  population  with  varying 
degrees of renal impairment (105RI101) (see also section 2.4. ). 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 68/98 
 
  
  
Phase 3 studies 301 and 302 were pooled for the integrated analysis of safety. Phase 1 studies 
were  not  included  because  the  design,  objectives,  and/or  populations  in  these  studies  were 
significantly different from the Phase 3 studies.  
At  the  time  of  submission,  both  study  301  and  302  were  on-going.  Data  used  for  the  safety 
analysis  were  therefore  initially  based  on  a  cut-off  date  of  24  October.  These  were  later 
complemented  with  additional  data  provided  during  the  assessment  of  this  application  with  a 
cut-off date of 27 March 2013, which translated into safety data up to a duration of 3.5 years.  
The  safety  analysis  population  is  based  on  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study 
treatment (ITT populations). Safety data after subjects switched to alternative MS medications 
were excluded from the overall safety analysis. Two study safety populations were defined: 
•  Study  301  Safety  Population  or  Placebo-Experience  Population,  defined  as  all 
subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  treatment  with  placebo  or  BIIB017  in 
study 301 Year 1.  
•  Overall  BIIB017  Safety  Population,  defined  as  all  subjects  who  received  at  least 
1 dose  of  study  treatment  with  BIIB017  in  Study  301  or  302.  This  was  the  analysis 
population for the overall BIIB017 experience. Subjects were analysed in the treatment 
groups according to the treatment. 
Patient exposure 
As  of  the  data  cut-off  date  of  24  October  2012,  a  total  of  608  subjects  had  completed  both 
years of study 301, and 625 subjects were continuing year 2 of Study 301. At cut-off date, 508 
subjects were receiving treatment in the extension study 302.   
In  Table  13,  exposure  as  indicated  by  subject  years,  number  of  patients  by  duration  of 
treatment, by study arm and compliance is presented.

For  the  placebo-controlled  BIIB017  experience,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  higher  in  the 
BIIB017  treatment  groups  compared  to  placebo  (83%  placebo  versus  94%  and  94%  in  the 
BIIB017 q4W and q2W, respectively).  
Differences in the AE profile between the placebo and BIIB017 treatment groups were primarily 
driven  by  events  in  the  SOC  of  general  disorders  and  administration-site  conditions  (45%  for 
placebo  versus  89%  and  88%  for  BIIB017  q4W  and  q2W,  respectively),  musculoskeletal  and 
connective tissue disorders (33% for placebo versus 42% and 40% for BIIB017 q4W and q2W, 
respectively), investigations (15% for placebo versus 18% and 21% for BIIB017 q4W and q2W, 
respectively),  and  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (9%  for  placebo  versus  12%  and 
15% for BIIB017 q4W and q2W, respectively). 
The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  by  PT  with  an  incidence  ≥10%  in  any  treatment  group 
included injection-site erythema, influenza-like illness, pyrexia, headache, MS relapse, myalgia, 
chills,  injection-site  pain,  asthenia,  back  pain,  injection-site  pruritus,  nasopharyngitis, 
arthralgia, fatigue, and pain in extremity.  
With  the  exception  of  relapse,  nasopharyngitis,  fatigue,  and  pain  in  extremity,  all  other 
commonly  reported  AEs  were  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  BIIB017  treatment  groups 
compared to placebo.  
The  most  common  ADRs  (incidence  ≥10%  in  the  BIIB017  group)  in  the  BIIB017  q4W  group 
were similar to the BIIB017 q2W. 
Assessment report

The overall incidence of treatment-related AEs was higher with BIIB017 treatment compared to 
placebo and similar between the BIIB017 treatment groups (53% placebo versus 90% in each 
of the two BIIB017 treatment groups). 
The overall incidence of severe AEs was higher in the BIIB017 treatment groups compared with 
placebo (11% placebo versus 16% BIIB017 q4W and 18% BIIB017 q2W). The incidence of the 
following  severe  events  was  higher  in  the  BIIB017  treatment  groups  compared  with  placebo: 
headache (2% placebo versus 4% and 5% in the BIIB017 q4W and q2W groups, respectively), 
myalgia (<1% placebo versus 1% and 2% in the BIIB017 q4W and q2W groups, respectively), 
influenza-like  illness  (<1%  placebo  versus  4%  and  5%  in  the  BIIB017  q4W  and  q2W  groups, 
respectively),  pyrexia  (0%  placebo  versus  3%  in  each  of  the  BIIB017  treatment  groups),  and 
injection-site erythema (0% placebo versus 2% in each of the BIIB017 treatment groups).  
Discontinuation  from  treatment  due  to  an  adverse  event  was  overall  low  but  higher  in  the 
BIIB017  groups  (5%  each)  compared  to  placebo  (1%).  Withdrawal  from  study  due  to  an 
adverse  event  was  higher  in  the  BIIB017  groups  (4%  and  5%  for  BIIB017  q4W  and  q2W) 
compared to placebo (1%). 
The incidence of AEs was analysed in 12-week time intervals. When examined at both the SOC 
and  PT  level,  the  incidence  of  AEs  for  the  placebo-controlled  BIIB017  experience  remained 
stable  or  decreased  at  each  time  interval  in  both  the  placebo  and  the  BIIB017  treatment 
groups.  There  were  no  increases  over  time  in  the  incidence  of  any  AE  by  PT  or  SOC  in  any 
treatment group.  
Adverse events reported from the overall BIIB017 experience were similar to those reported 
from the placebo-controlled experience (study 301, Year 1), giving an overall consistent picture 
of controlled and controlled/uncontrolled studies. 
Adverse events of special interest 
AEs identified of special interest for beta-interferons include  
• 
• 
flu-like symptoms (FLS),  
injection site reactions,  
•  cardiovascular disorders,  
•  hepatic disorders,  
•  autoimmune disorders,  
•  seizures,  
•  depression and suicide ideation,  
•  hypersensitivity reactions,  
•  haematological laboratory abnormalities, and  
•  abnormal liver function tests.  
AEs identified of special interest for immunomodulation are  
• 
infections and  
•  malignancies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 74/98 
 
  
  
Furthermore, development of anti-interferon beta or anti-PEG antibodies was also an event of 
special interest as it may affect both efficacy (lack of efficacy) and safety. 
•  Flu-like symptoms (FLS) 
FLS were defined and described using 2 definitions. The narrow definition of FLS was based on 
the  single  PT  of  influenza-like  illness  whereas  the  broad  definition  included  the  PTs  chills, 
hyperpyrexia, influenza-like illness, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, pain, and pyrexia. 
Incidence of flu-like symptoms is presented in Table 15.

For  the  placebo-controlled  BIIB017  experience,  FLS  occurred  most  frequently  over  the  first 
12 weeks  of  treatment  and  decreased  slightly  thereafter  within  both  BIIB017  dose  frequency 
groups. Analysis of FLS over time for the overall BIIB017 experience showed the same pattern 
for FLS seen for the placebo-controlled BIIB017 experience.  
The mean percentage of days with FLS using the narrow definition (excluding subjects without 
FLS in the analysis) from 0 to 48 weeks was 5.2% in the placebo group versus 6.9% and 9.6% 
days  in  the  BIIB017  q4W  and  q2W  groups,  respectively.  When  including  all  subjects  in  the 
analysis the mean percentage of days with FLS was lower, but the outcome was similar with a 
higher mean percentage of days with FLS in subjects receiving BIIB017 (3.2% and 4.5% days 
in  the  BIIB017  q4W  and  q2W  groups,  respectively)  compared  with  placebo  (0.7%)  The  same 
outcome was observed when using the broad FLS definition.   
The incidence of FLS that occurred within 2 days of the most recent injection was higher in the 
BIIB017  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (78%  placebo  versus  95%  and 
96%  in  the  BIIB017  q4W  and  q2W  groups,  respectively).  The  duration  of  FLS  that  occurred 
within  2  days  of  the  most  recent  injection  was  similar  between  the  BIIB017  and  placebo 
treatment groups (2.6 to 3.0 days). 
In  the  overall  BIIB017  experience,  the  percentage of  days  with  FLS  by  12-week  intervals  was 
similar  to  the  placebo-controlled  BIIB017  experience  and  similar  between  BIIB017  dose 
frequency groups. The same outcome was observed when using the broad FLS definition.  
The time course of FLS events indicated a peak during the first 12 weeks of treatment followed 
by a slightly lower plateau phase in the subsequent weeks up to Week 48. However, the overall 
BIIB017  experience  revealed  higher  incidences  in  the  subsequent  months  of  treatment  up  to 
three years of treatment, especially with BIIB017 q2W. The  updated analysis with a data cut-
off  of  27th  March  2013  showed  no  increase  in  FLS  towards  the  end  of  the  study  period  in 
contrast to the original analysis.

Discontinuations  from  treatment  and  withdrawals  from  study  due  to  flu-like  illness  AEs  were 
overall low and similar across treatment groups (<2%). 
•  Injection-site reactions 
Injection-site  reactions  were  commonly  reported by  subjects  receiving  BIIB017  treatment  and 
occurred at a higher incidence compared with the placebo group. The incidence of injection-site 
reactions  tended  to  be  dose-frequency  related  in  both  the  placebo-controlled  BIIB017 
experience and in the overall BIIB017 experience. 
Injection-site erythema, injection-site pain, and injection-site pruritus were the most commonly 
reported adverse events in relation to injection-site reactions.  
The  incidence  of  reported  injection-site  reactions  and  percentage  days  did  not  change 
significantly over time when examined by 12-week intervals.  
The  majority  of  the  injection-site  reactions  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  There  was  one 
serious  case  (BIIB017  q2W),  including  erythema,  oedema,  pain,  and  pruritus,  which  was 
treated  with  IM  dexamethasone  and  oral  cetirizine  and  resulting  in  discontinuation  and 
withdrawal.  This  was  described  as  a  local  hypersensitivity  reaction  with  no  systemic 
hypersensitivity  symptoms  involved  others  than  the skin  reactions described. One  further  SAE 
was reported in the overall BIIB017 experience (gangraneous cellulitis, resulting in necrosis).   
In general, injection-site reactions only led to study drug discontinuations and withdrawals from 
studies in few cases only.  
Injection Site Reactions in Relation to Antibody Status 
Because  of  the  low  incidence  of  neutralising  antibodies  (NAbs:  12  out  of  676),  binding 
antibodies (BAbs: 63/625) and anti-PEG antibodies (87/601) in the placebo-controlled BIIB017 
population, no meaningful conclusion could be drawn regarding the presence of NAbs, BAbs or 
anti-PEG  antibodies  and  occurrence  of  injection-site  reactions.  In  the  overall  BIIB017 
population,  the  incidence  of  injection-site  reactions  by  antibody  status  (ever  positive  versus 
never  positive;  any  post-baseline  positive  versus  rest)  was  similar  in  the  overall  BIIB017 
experience.  There  was  no  increase  in  the  incidence  of  injection-site  reactions  in  subjects  who 
were anti–interferon beta-1a BAb-, NAb-, or anti-PEG antibody-positive at any point in time.  
•  Infections 
There  was  no  evidence  for  an  increased  risk  of  infections,  serious  infections  or  opportunistic 
infections in subjects treated with BIIB017. Severe infections concerned in the BIIB q4W group 
15  subjects.  Most  frequent  were  urinary  tract  infections  (n=6),  influenza  (n=2)  and  sepsis 
(n=2).  In  the  BIIB  q2W  group  13  subjects  had  severe  infections.  Most  frequent  were  urinary 
tract infections (n=4), urosepsis (n=2), sepsis (n=2) and pneumonia.  
A  total  of  12  and  11  subjects  treated  with  BIIB017  q4W  and  q2W,  respectively,  had  serious 
infections.  
Opportunistic  infections  were  reported  in  2  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  [cryoptosporidial 
gatrosenteritis (NZ), dissiminated tuberculosis (India)] and  in 1 subject receiving BII017 q2W 
[positive cytomegalovirus immunoglobiline G test without associated symptoms (UKR)].

•  Cardiovascular disorders 
There was no evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular disorders or serious cardiovascular 
disorders  in  patients  treated  with  BIIB017.  Most  of  the  reported  cardiovascular  disorder  AEs 
were assessed as mild or moderate.  
In the placebo-controlled safety population, serious cardiovascular disorders were reported by 3 
subjects  (paraparesis,  monoparesis,  paresis)  in  the  BIIB017  q4W  group,    3  subjects 
(paraparesis, cerebral ischemia, cerebrovascular insufficiency) in the BIIB017 q2W group and 2 
subjects (subarachnoid haemorrhage, chest pain) in the placebo group. All events except for 1 
were considered not related to study treatment by the Investigator.  
In  the  overall  BIIB017  population,  serious  cardiovascular  disorders  were  reported  by  9  and  4 
subjects In the BIIB017 q4W and q2W respectively. These concern: paraparesis, paresis (n=2), 
lacunar  infarction,  monoparesis,  syncope,  myocardial  infarction  (n=2)  cardiac  failure)  in  the 
BIIB017  q4W  group  and  paraparesis,  cerebral  ischemia,  cerebrovascular  insufficiency, 
cardiopulmonary failure  in the BIIB017 q2W group. 
•  Autoimmune disorders 
In  the  placebo-controlled  population,  3  cases  were  reported:  1  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  2 
autoimmune  thyroiditis.  In  the  BII017  2qW  group  there  was  one  report  of  autoimmune 
thyroiditis.  There  were  no  autoimmune  disorder  events  that  were  assessed  as  severe  or 
serious. 
In  the  overall  BIIB017  safety  population,  2  subjects  in  each  BIIB017  group  reported  an 
autoimmune disorder AE. None was reported as severe. One event in the BIIB017 q4W group 
concerned  a  serious  autoimmune  disorder  i.e.  Basedow’s  Disease.  This  event  was  not 
considered  related  to  study  treatment,  because  this  patient  had  hyperthyroidism  prior  to  the 
onset of BIIB017 treatment and the diagnosis of Basedow’s disease was made shortly after the 
initiation of BII017 treatment in year 2.  
There were no autoimmune disorders that led to study treatment discontinuation or withdrawal 
from study. 
•  Hepatic disorders 
Hepatic  injury,  ranging  from  asymptomatic  elevated  serum  hepatic  enzyme  levels,  hepatitis, 
and autoimmune hepatitis to severe hepatic failure, has been associated with the use of IFN-β. 
There  was  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  alanine  transaminase  (ALT)  and  aspartate 
aminotransferase  (AST)  levels  from  baseline  in  BIIB017-treated  subjects,  but  the  majority  of 
these elevations were less than 3 times the upper limits of normal (ULN).  
In the placebo-controlled BIIB017 population, the incidence of elevated ALT and AST ≥3 × ULN 
was  slightly  higher  in  BIIB017-treated  subjects  compared  with  subjects  receiving  placebo. 
However,  elevations  of  ALT  and  AST  >5  ×  ULN  were  balanced  between  BIIB017  and  placebo 
treated subjects.  
One severe AE was reported each in the BIIB017 q4W and q2W groups.  
In  clinical  trials  with  BIIB017,  there  were  a  total  of  3  cases  of  concurrent  elevations  of 
transaminases ≥3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN. All 3 cases were on the BIIB017 Q4W

dose frequency group. One of these cases (Acute hepatic failure) was reported during the Year 
1  of  Study  301  (placebo  controlled  experience)  and  was  assessed  as  not  related  to  BIIB017 
treatment (and related to corticosteroid treatment) and the 2 other cases (one reported during 
the Year 2 of Study 301 and the other reported from the Study 302) were assessed as related 
to BIIB017 treatment. 
Severe AEs were reported in 3 subjects.  
Serious hepatic disorders were reported in 1 subject in the BIIB017 q4W group (see above) and 
1 subject (drug-induce liver injury) in the BIIB017 q2W group.   
•  Hypersensitivity Events 
The majority of hypersensitivity events were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity.  
In  the  placebo-controlled  BIIB017  population,  the  overall  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  events 
was 14% (n=71), 13% (n=67) and 16%  (n=82) for placebo, BIIB017 q4W and BIIB017 q2W, 
respectively.  Three  serious  hypersensitivity  events  were  reported  all  in  the  BIIB017  groups. 
None  of  these  events  were  related  to  BIIB017  treatment,  and  none  were  associated  with  the 
presence of antibodies to the interferon or PEG components of BIIB017. 
In  the  overall  BIIB017  population,  the  incidence  of  hypersensitivity  events  was  14%  (n=105) 
and 17% (n=125) for BIIB017 q4W and BIIB017 q2W, respectively.  
The  most  frequent  events  concerned  (BIIB017  q4W  /  BIIB017  q2W):  skin  and  subcutaneous 
tissue  disorders  (47/68),  cough  (40/31),  pruritus  (19/23),  erythema  (7/15),  urticaria  (7/12), 
oedema  peripheral  (14/5),  dyspnoea  (7  /9),  dermatitis  allergic  (6/4),  pruritus  generalised  (3 
/6),  eye  disorders  (3/6),  drug  hypersensitivity  (2/4),  hypotension  (2/4),  face  oedema  (0/4), 
flushing (1/3), sneezing (3 /1). 
The rates of hypersensitivity events in subjects who were anti–interferon beta-1a BAb-, NAb-, 
or  anti-  PEG  antibody-positive  at  any  time  during  the  study  were  either  similar  to  rates 
observed in antibody-negative subjects or too low to draw a conclusion.  
•  Malignancies 
Malignancies  were  identified  in  four  subjects  (breast  cancer,  cervix  carcinoma,  Squamous  cell 
carcinoma  lip/oral  cavity,  Basal  cell  carcinoma)  treated  with  BIIB017.  In  one  case  the 
malignancy  (Squamous  cell  carcinoma  lip/oral  cavity  under  BIIB017  q4W  treatment)  was 
assesses as related to treatment.  
•  Seizure 
There was a similar incidence of seizures occurring across all treatment groups in the placebo-
controlled  BIIB017  experience.  The  majority  of  seizure  events  reported  occurred  in  subjects 
with  medical  histories  of  seizure  disorders.  One  SAE  was  considered  related  to  BIIB017 
treatment due to its onset shortly after injection of BIIB017.  
•  Depression and suicide 
In  the  placebo-controlled  experience  there  was  no  excess  of  AEs  related  to  depression  and 
suicidal  ideation  of  BIIB017  over  placebo  (8%  placebo  vs.  9%  BIIB017  q4W  and  8%  BIIB017 
q2W).  Suicidal  ideation  was  reported  in  single  subjects  only  across  treatment  groups  (<1%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 79/98 
 
  
  
Serious  depression  and  suicide-related  AEs  were  reported  in  one  single  subject  per  treatment 
group. 
Regarding the overall BIIB017 experience, the incidence of depression or suicide AEs was 10% 
and 9% in the BIIB017 q4W and q2W groups, respectively, with suicidal ideation only occurring 
in single subjects (<1% in each treatment group). The only two SAE of depression and suicidal 
ideation were already included in the placebo-controlled experience.  
There were no cases of completed suicide.  
The  Beck  Depression  Inventory  II  (BDI-II)  scores  were  similar  across  treatment  groups  in 
Year 1  and  in  Year  2.  The  incidence  of  depression,  suicidal  tendency,  and  suicide  attempt 
according to BDI-II (score >18) were similar across treatment groups and remained stable over 
time.

Overall,  over  the  period  of  >96  weeks,  there  was  a  low  rate  of  immunogenicity  detected  for 
BIIB017, which was similar across the BIIB017 dose frequency groups. The overall incidence of 
NAbs  to  interferon  beta-1a  was  low  (<1%)  in  the  BIIB017  treatment  groups.  The  overall 
incidence  of  anti-PEG  antibodies  was  similar  between  BIIB017  dose  frequency  groups,  but 
about half of these subjects had persistent anti-PEG antibodies.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths  
Eight deaths have been reported in Year 1 and Year 2 of study 301. No deaths have been 
reported in study 302 as of the data cut-off date.  
In Year 1 of study 301, 4 deaths were reported. None of the deaths were considered related to 
study treatment by the investigator. Cause of death was unknown (n=2, one in placebo and 
one in the BIIB017 q2W arm), subarachnoid haemorrhage (n=1, placebo) and septicemic shock 
(n=1, BIIB017 q4W). 
In year 2 of study 301, 4 additional deaths were reported. Causes of death concerned lip/oral 
cavity squamous cell carcinoma rated as related to treatment (BIIB q4W), cranio-cerebral 
injury due to motor vehicle accident rated as not related to treatment (BIIB q2W), sepsis due 
to cardiorespiratory failure rated as related to study treatment (BIIB q2W) and an unknown 
cause of death (BIIB q2W, lost in follow-up). 
Other serious adverse events (SAE) 
•  Study 301 Safety Population (Placebo-Experience Population) 
For the placebo-controlled BIIB017 experience, the percentage of subjects reporting an SAE 
was similar across treatment groups (15% placebo versus 14% and 11% in the BIIB017 q4W 
and q2W groups, respectively). MS relapse was the most frequent SAE reported in Year 1 
across treatment groups. Other SAEs occurring in ≥2 subjects included pneumonia and urinary 
tract infection. All other SAEs were reported by at most 1 subject in each treatment group with 
an incidence of ≤1%.   
The distribution of SAEs considered related to study treatment by the investigator was 
2 subjects (<1%) in the placebo group (both with MS relapse); 6 subjects (1%) in the BIIB017 
q4W group (2 subjects with MS relapse, 1 subject with pneumonia, 1 subject with febrile 
neutropenia, 1 subject with overdose and 1 subject with deep vein thrombosis); and 4 subjects 
(<1%) in the BIIB017 q2W group (1 subject with transaminase levels increased, 1 subject with 
partial seizures, 1 subject with injection-site reactions and 1 subject with paraparesis).  
•  Overall Safety Population (Placebo-Experience Population) 
For the overall BIIB017 experience, the overall incidence of SAEs was lower in the BIIB017 q2W 
group (16%) compared with BIIB017 q4W (21%). MS relapse was the most frequent SAE 
reported in the overall BIIB017 experience. Other SAEs occurring in ≥3 subjects included 
urinary tract infection, pneumonia, sepsis and fall.  
The incidence of SAEs considered related to study treatment between the 2 BIIB017 dose 
frequency groups was: 16 subjects (2%) in the BIIB017 every 4 weeks group and 13 subjects 
(2%) in the BIIB017 every 2 weeks group. 
Laboratory findings 
•  White blood cell (WBC) Parameters 
There  were  small  BIIB017  dose-related  decreases  from  baseline  and  shifts  to  low  counts 
observed  in  WBC,  lymphocytes,  and  absolute  neutrophil  counts  in  BIIB017-treated  subjects 
compared with placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 81/98 
 
  
  
Mean values remained within normal limits at all evaluations across all treatment groups.  
Monocytes,  eosinophils,  and  basophils  did  not  change  markedly  from  baseline  in  BIIB017-
treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects. 
•  Red blood cells (RBC) 
RBC (RBC counts, haemoglobin, and haematocrit) and platelets were found to be moderately 
decreased in BIIB017-treated subjects compared to placebo.  
Data on the overall BIIB017 experience at Year 3 (week 144) revealed no further decrease in 
mean RBC counts and mean haemoglobin levels relative to Year 2. Clinically significant values 
for  RBC  counts,  haemoglobin,  and  platelets  were  not  different  across  groups  in  general. 
However,  one  SAE  was  reported  with  significant  haemoglobin  decrease  resulting  in 
hospitalisation of a woman, who already had a relevant medical history and therefore the SAE 
was not rated related to treatment. Another SAE was reported as severe thrombocytopenia and 
was  considered to be  related to  BIIB017  treatment.  In  addition,  one  subject discontinued  due 
to thrombocytopenia.  
•  Blood Chemistry Results 
Liver Function Tests 
There  was  a  dose-related  increase  in  the  incidence  of  elevated  liver  transaminase  levels  in 
BIIB017  treated  subjects.  This  increase  was  primarily  due  to  differences  that  occurred  in  the 
first  3  months  of  BIIB017  treatment.  For  the  majority  of  subjects  treated  with  BIIB017  who 
experienced elevated transaminase levels, the maximum post/baseline values for ALT and AST 
were <3 times ULN and were not associated with any corresponding increase in total bilirubin. 
ALT or AST values ≥3 x ULN and total bilirubin >2 x ULN, which defines Hy’s law, was reported 
in one subject from the BIIB017 q2W group (acute hepatic failure due to corticosteroids) during 
the placebo-controlled experience and in two subject from the overall experience.  
Three SAEs included drug-induced liver injury, transaminitis, and AST/ALT increased. 
Kidney Function 
Mean  values  and  change  from  baseline  for  blood  urea  nitrogen  (BUN)  and  creatinine  were 
similar  across  treatment  groups  and  showed  no  meaningful  changes  over  time;  mean  values 
were  within  the  normal  range  in  both  groups  at  all  time  points  during  the  study.  Kidney 
function  parameters  were  similar  in  the  overall  BIIB017  experience  population  compared  to 
those reported in the placebo-controlled BIIB017 experience and were similar between BIIB017 
treatment groups.  
Other Blood Chemistry 
Mean  values  for  bicarbonate,  sodium,  potassium,  chloride,  glucose,  and  thyroid-stimulating 
hormone  (TSH)  were  similar  across  the  placebo  and  BIIB017  treatment  groups  at  all  time 
points,  did  not  change  significantly  from  baseline,  and  remained  within  normal  range  at  all 
times  through  Week  48.  Results  in  the  overall  BIIB017  experience  safety  population  were 
comparable to the placebo-controlled BIIB017 experience.  
Urinalysis  
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 82/98 
 
  
  
In  the  placebo-controlled  BIIB017  experience,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  shift  from 
baseline  to  low  or  high/positive  values  in  the  urinalysis  was  similar  between  the  placebo  and 
BIIB017  treatment  groups.  Shifts  to  high  across  treatment  groups  were  more  commonly 
reported  in  descending  order  in  urine  protein,  blood,  RBC,  WBC,  and  ketones.  No  subjects  in 
any treatment group had shifts to high (or low) values for urine bilirubin. Similar results were 
observed in the overall BIIB017 experience and results were similar between the BIIB017 dose 
frequency groups. 
Vital signs, physical findings  
In  the  placebo-controlled  BIIB017  experience,  the  mean  baseline  values  for  vital  signs  (body 
temperature,  pulse,  and  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure),  weight  were  similar  across  the 
treatment  groups.  There  were  no  significant  changes  from  baseline  values  over  time  for  any 
vital sign across treatment groups.  
No  clinically  significant  changes  were  observed  between  placebo  and  the  BIIB017  treatment 
groups for QTc interval or any other parameter.  
Body weight changes 
Safety data for the overall BIIB017 experience at the cut-off date of 27th March 2013 comprised 
196  weeks  of  exposure  and  revealed  no  significant  change  of  body  weight  for  the  active 
treatment groups.  
Safety in special populations 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  by  demographic  characteristics  was  consistent  with  the  incidence 
of AEs in the overall safety population, and there were no clinically relevant differences in the 
incidence  of  AEs  between  BIIB017  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  age  (subjects  <40  years 
and  subjects  ≥40  years),  sex  (female  and  male),  race  (white,  Asian,  black,  and  other),  body 
weight, BMI, and antibody status (NAbs, BAbs, and anti-PEG antibodies). 
Some  minor  and  clinically  non-relevant  differences  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  were  observed  by 
region  (North  American  and  Western  European  countries  versus  Eastern  European  countries 
versus rest of the world) in the placebo-controlled BIIB017 experience whereas the incidence of 
AEs  in  the  overall  BIIB017  experience  was  similar  between  BIIB017  dose  frequency  groups 
within a region.  
Due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  in  studies  301  and  302  who  used  prior  MS  therapies,  an 
analysis of the incidence of AEs by prior MS therapy was inconclusive.  
Twelve  pregnancies  in  BIIB017-treated  women  were  identified  in  the  clinical  program.  There 
were  no  safety  signals  concerning  fetal  abnormalities.  However,  spontaneous  abortion  was 
reported  in  one  patient  from  the  placebo  group  versus  two  patients  from  the  BIIB017  group. 
Three pregnancies were still on-going at the time of database closure.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with BIIB017.  
As  corticosteroids  are  commonly  used  in  MS  subjects  for  the  treatment of  relapses,  and  since 
complications  arising  from  high-dose  corticosteroids can  occur,  an  analysis  of  the  incidence  of 
AEs in subjects who had IV corticosteroid treatment for an MS relapse compared with subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 83/98 
 
  
  
who did not have IV corticosteroid treatment during the studies has been performed. With the 
exception  of  events  of  MS  relapse,  no  considerable  differences  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  for 
subjects  who  received  IV  corticosteroid  treatment  versus  subjects  who  did  not  receive  IV 
corticosteroid treatment were observed.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation from study due to AEs 
In  the  placebo-controlled  BIIB017  experience  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  that  led  to 
discontinuation  of  study  treatment  was  higher  in  the  BIIB017  treatment  groups  (24  subjects 
[5%] in the BIIB027 q4W group, and 25 subjects [5%] in the BIIB017 q2W group) compared 
with the placebo group (7 subjects [1%]). The data from the overall experience were similar to 
the placebo-controlled experience for the BIIB017 groups. 
The most common AEs that led to study treatment discontinuation in BIIB017-treated subjects 
were  influenza-like  illness,  injection-site  erythema,  and  pyrexia;  and  the  incidence  of  each  of 
these was ≤2% in each BIIB017 treatment group.  
Withdrawal from study due to AEs  
In the placebo-controlled BIIB017 experience the overall incidence of AEs that led to withdrawal 
from the study was higher in the BIIB017 treatment groups (22 subjects [4%] and 25 subjects 
[5%]  in  the  BIIB017  every  4  and  every  2  weeks  groups,  respectively)  compared  with  the 
placebo group (6 subjects [1%]).  
The data from the overall experience were similar to the placebo-controlled experience for the 
BIIB017  groups.  In  general,  the  pattern  of  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  from  the  study  was 
similar  to  that  observed  for  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  treatment.  Influenza-like 
illness  leading  to  study  withdrawal  was  reported  by  1%  of  subjects  in  the  BIIB017  treatment 
groups as the most common AE leading to study withdrawal. 
Dose interruptions 
In the placebo-controlled BIIB017 experience, the incidence of AEs that led to dose interruption 
was  similar  between  treatment  groups.  The  results  for  the  overall  BIIB017  experience  were 
comparable to the placebo-controlled BIIB017 experience.  
Withdrawal and rebound  
In the placebo-controlled BIIB017 experience the number of subjects in the placebo-controlled 
BIIB017 population who discontinued study treatment but remained in the study for follow-up 
and  had  an  AE  was  low  (5  [11%]  subjects  in  the  placebo  group,  7  [11%]  subjects  in  the 
BIIB017 every 4 weeks group, and 9 [12%] subjects in the BIIB017 every 2 weeks group). 
For the overall BIIB017 experience, the number of subjects who discontinued study treatment 
and  remained  in  the  study  for  follow-up  evaluations  was  similar  between  the  BIIB017  dose 
frequency groups: 16.9% and 18.1% in the BIIB017 q2W and q4W groups.  
The  number  of  subjects  who  discontinued  study  treatment  and  reported  an  AE  after  study 
treatment discontinuation was low.

Post marketing experience 
Postmarketing  experience  was  not  available  for  BIIB017,  but  for  other  interferon-beta  1a 
therapies  like  Avonex  (IM)  and  Rebif  (SC).  A  comparison  of  the  safety  profiles  of  BIIB017, 
Avonex, and Rebif, mainly based on placebo-controlled experience, revealed high similarities in 
the  adverse  events  of  special  interest.  BIIB017  tended  to  be  favourable  regarding 
hypersensitivity reactions, depression and suicidal ideation, infections, cardiovascular disorders 
and the formation of NAbs. Incidences of all other AEs of special interest including FLS, hepatic 
disorders, seizures, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies were similar.  
Regarding  injection-site  reactions,  there  was  a  significantly  higher  event  rate  following 
BIIB017-treatment compared to IM Avonex (60%-66% vs. 3%). This higher incidence is well in 
line with Rebif (89%-92%), which is also administered SC.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  database  presented  with  this  application  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be 
acceptable  both in term of numbers of patients as well as considering the duration of use. The 
CHMP noted that, at the time of this report, study 302 was on-going and hence, long-term data 
were still being generated. 
The definition of two safety populations, i.e. placebo-experience population and overall BIIB017 
safety  population,  was  suitable  to  enable  overall  safety  assessment  as  well  as  comparison  of 
active  test  drug  versus  placebo.  Since  the  placebo-experience  population  is  included  in  the 
overall  population,  it  was  not  unexpected  that  the  safety  of  BIIB017  in  these  two  populations 
was similar.  
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with BIIB017. 
Compared to placebo the overall incidence of any adverse events as well as for any treatment-
related AEs was higher in both active arms. Most common adverse events concerned injection-
site  events  and  influenza-like  illness  and  symptoms  e.g.  headache,  myalgia,  chills,  asthenia, 
arthralgia, fatigue, and pain in extremities.  
Apart  from  local  site  reactions  and  flu-like  syndrome,  no  specific  pattern  of  serious  adverse 
events, that could be associated with active treatment, emerged. Eight cases of death occurred. 
Overall there was no specific pattern regarding the nature of these cases of death.  
Adverse events of special interest, based on previous experience with beta-interferons were flu-
like symptoms (FLS), injection site reactions (ISRs), hepatic disorders, autoimmune disorders, 
seizures, depression and suicide ideation, hypersensitivity reactions, haematological laboratory 
abnormalities  and  abnormal  liver  function  tests.  AEs  identified  of  special  interest  due  to  the 
immunomodulatory mechanism of action were infections and malignancies.  
Flu-like symptoms are a common adverse reaction to beta interferons. They typically occur at 
the beginning of treatment and are mild and moderate in severity. In the safety population, FLS 
was recognised as one of the major reason for treatment failure. However, the low incidence of 
severe flu-like illness, low percentage days of flu-like symptoms and low rate of discontinuation 
due  to  flu-like  syndrome  indicated  that  for  BIIB017  this  was  not  a  large  issue.  Flu-like 
symptoms were referred to as important identified risk in the risk management plan (RMP, see 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 85/98 
 
  
  
section  2.8.  ).  The  CHMP  agreed  that  dose  titration  at  treatment  initiation  may  help  to 
ameliorate  flu-like  symptoms.  As  already  recommended  with  other  interferon-beta  therapies, 
concomitant  administration  of  anti-inflammatory,  analgesic  and/or  antipyretic  treatments  may 
help to ameliorate these symptoms. This was considered to be adequately reflected in section 
4.2 of the SmPC. 
Injection-site reactions are also common with interferon-beta treatment. There was a slight but 
consistent  disadvantage  in  adverse  events  related  to  injection  site  for  the  BIIB017  q2W  dose 
versus  the  BIIB017  q4W  dose,  which  is  likely  explained  by  the  larger  dose  interval.  Serious 
injection-site  reactions  were  mentioned  as  an  important  identified  risk  in  the  RMP.  Regarding 
the  warning  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  (and  respective  section  in  the  PIL),  following  a 
recommendation by CHMP, a more precise instruction on the injection technique and alertness 
on the occurrence of symptoms of injection-site reactions has been included. 
BIIB017 treatment carries the risk for the development of (serious) hypersensitivity reactions, 
which is already known for other interferon-beta treatments. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that 
use of Plegridy should be contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to natural 
or  recombinant  interferon  beta  or  peginterferon.  Additional  appropriate  warnings  and 
instructions  were  included  in  the  SmPC.  Furthermore,  serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  were 
included as important identified risk outlined in the RMP.  
Preclinical  data  for  non-pegylated  interferons  have  indicated  hepatic  toxicity  in  animals  and 
furthermore, clinical studies with Plegridy/BIIB017 confirmed hepatic damage, e.g. by increases 
in  liver  enzymes  and  rare  cases  of  hepatic  injury.  BIIB017-related  liver  enzyme  abnormalities 
were  found  to  be  generally  in  line  with  data  for  Avonex  and  Rebif,  with  incidences  ranging 
somewhere  in  between  the  two  non-pegylated  products.  Since  rare  serious  adverse  events  of 
hepatic injury with BIIB017 have been reported to be related to elevated ALT/AST and bilirubin 
(Hy’s  Law),  routine  monitoring  of  liver  parameters  (and  laboratory  parameters  in  general) 
should  be  performed  at  pre-specified  time  points  as  known  from  other  interferon-beta  MS 
therapies  (section  4.4  of  the  SmPC).  Furthermore,  hepatic  injury  was  included  in  the  RMP  as 
potential important risk.  
For injection-site reactions, hepatic disorders, elevated liver function tests, and hypersensitivity 
reactions  there  was  a  slight  advantage  of  the  BIIB017  q4W  dose  versus  the  q2W  dose. 
Although the differences in frequencies for the two dose regimens were small, taken together, 
this resulted in a less favourable safety profile of the q2W regimen compared to the q4W dosing 
schedule.  
Based on the safety database presented with this application it appeared that BIIB017 was not 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  infections,  opportunist  infections,  autoimmune  disorders, 
seizures  or  depression/suicidal  ideation.  Depression  and  suicidal  behaviour  were  however 
considered  a  potential  important  risk  within  the  RMP  and  the  CHMP  agreed  that  Plegridy  was 
contraindicated  in  patients  with  current  severe  depression  and/or  suicidal  ideation,  as 
depression  is  known  to  occur  with  increased  frequency  in  MS  patients  and  in  association  with 
interferon use. 
No conclusion could be drawn based on the low incidence and pattern of malignancies.

The  changes  in  haematology  and  chemical  variables  other  than  liver  function  parameters 
described  above  were  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  consistent  with  what  is  known  for  non-
pegylated  beta  interferons.  Specification  of  routine  blood  monitoring  in  accordance  with  other 
interferon-beta therapies has been implemented in the SmPC and decrease in peripheral blood 
cell count was reflected in the RMP (important identified risk). 
Anti–PEG  antibodies  were  found  to  be  higher  for  subjects  in  the  BIIB017  groups  compared  to 
placebo. Many of these patients showed persistent anti-PEG antigenicity and the impact for the 
therapy with Plegridy was not clear. Additional analyses provided by the applicant showed that 
the  emerging  of  anti-PEG  antibodies  during  BIIB017  treatment  did  not  lead  to  altered  PK/PD, 
efficacy and safety profiles. However, the findings were only representative for a 2-year period. 
Immunogenicity was an important potential risk in the RMP and the CHMP considered that long-
term data from the extension study 302 would help to better characterise this safety concern. 
Overall,  the  occurrence  of  antibodies,  especially  neutralising  anti-bodies  to  interferon  beta-1a 
was  low.  Therefore  and  since  the  duration  of  treatment  was  considered  to  be  too  short,  the 
CHMP was unable to draw firm conclusions on the immunogenicity of Plegridy and the impact of 
antibody  formation  on  safety.  However,  overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  immunogenic 
potential of BIIB017 was low.  
No direct comparison of safety between BIIB017 and other beta-interferons could be made due 
to  a  lack  of  active  controlled  studies.  Based  on  a  review  of  data  from  the  BIIB017  placebo-
controlled  pivotal  study  and  available  data  from  controlled  clinical  studies  for  other  approved 
interferon  beta-1a  products  (Avonex  and  Rebif)  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  safety  profile  of 
BIIB017  was  generally  consistent  with  that  of  approved  non-pegylated  beta-interferon 
therapies and relevant parts of the product information were aligned.  
Available  data  from  other  interferon-containing  products  were  indicative  for  a  slightly  higher 
risk of spontaneous abortion 
Overall, from the safety database all relevant adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have 
been  included  in  the  SmPC.  Furthermore,  the  product  information  was  brought  in  line  with 
wording  previously  agreed  further  to  two  recent  signals  at  the  time  of  this  report  for  beta 
interferons  concerning  nephrotic  syndrome  with  different  underlying  nephropathies  including 
collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and thrombotic microangiopathy. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall the clinical safety data set was considered acceptable. 
Based on the review of the available safety data, the CHMP concluded that the safety profile of 
Plegridy was comparable to already approved interferon beta products and overall acceptable. 
Numerically,  more  hepatic  events,  elevated  liver  function  tests  and  hypersensitivity  reactions 
were  observed  in  the  q2W  dose  regimen  as  compared  to  the  q4W  regimen,  resulting  in  a 
slightly  less  favourable  safety  profile  of  the  q2W  dosing  scheme.  Long-term  data  from  study 
302 were considered to be needed to further elucidate the immunogenic potential of Plegridy.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils 
the legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted RMP: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1.2, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for Peginterferon Beta 1a (Plegridy) in the 
proposed indication of adult treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis to slow the progression 
of disability and decrease the frequency of relapses is acceptable. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. These changes concerned the 
Pharmacovigilance plan of the Risk Management Plan following a request of the applicant to 
introduce a minor correction to the objective of the pregnancy registry to clarify that the 
registry will not be able to characterise patterns of congenital abnormalities. 
The approval of Risk Management Plan version 1.3 is based on the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  active  substance  of  Plegridy  is  peginterferon  beta-1a,  which  represents  a  polyethylene 
glycol  (PEG)-conjugated  form  of  interferon  beta-1a  in  order  to  protect  the  interferon  moiety 
from  enzymatic  degradation  and  other  clearance  mechanisms.  Medicinal  products  including 
beta interferon are established treatments in MS as 1st line therapy.  
Data  in  support  of  efficacy  of  a  therapeutic  dose  of  125  μg  peginterferon  beta-1a  has  been 
generated  in  two  randomised,  multicentre,  double-blind  phase  3  studies,  105MS301  (study 
301) and its extension, 105MS302 (study 302). As study 302 was still on-going at the time of 
this  report  and  since  the  study  was  not  controlled,  data  from  this  study  were  considered 
descriptive and supportive.  
Both  studies only  tested one  of  the  two proposed delivery  systems,  the pre-filled  syringe,  but 
not the pre-filled pen. However, since the formulation, route of administration and the injected 
volume is the same, and as the PK profiles of both devices were similar, CHMP agreed that both 
devices could be used inter-changeably. 
In study 301, a statistically significant reduction in the adjusted annualised relapse rate (ARR) 
at  Year  1  was  observed  for  both  active  treatment  arms  when  compared  to  placebo  (ARR  was 
0.397  for  placebo,  0.256  for  Plegridy  every  2  weeks  and  0.288  for  Plegridy  every  4  weeks). 
Although the observed effect size was rather modest (relative reduction of about 30%), it was 
considered clinically relevant. The CHMP agreed that it could be considered comparable to other 
interferons,  based  on  historical  comparison.  Amongst  the  secondary  endpoints,  the  CHMP 
considered the time to 12-weeks sustained disability progression as the most clinically relevant 
endpoint. The proportion of patients with progression at Year 1 was higher in the placebo group 
(0.105)  compared  to  both  Plegridy  every  2  weeks  and  Plegridy  every  4  weeks  (both  0.068). 
The  difference  between  placebo  and  both  active  arms  was  statistically  significant.  However, 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 92/98 
 
  
  
 
when sustained disability progression was assessed over 6 months, statistical significance after 
one year was only maintained for Plegridy every 2 weeks. 
Efficacy  was also shown in MRI endpoints for both dosing regimens. The percentage reduction 
of  new/newly  enlarging  T2  hyperintense  lesions  compared  to  placebo  was  67%  and  28%  for 
Plegridy  every  2  weeks  and  Plegridy  every  4  weeks,  respectively,  which  was  statistically 
significant.  However,  Plegridy  only  demonstrated  statistically  significant  differences  against 
placebo  on  the  number  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  and  T1  hypointense  lesions  at  Year  1  when 
administered every 2 weeks. 
The available data over 2 years of treatment from study 301 showed that efficacy in terms of 
ARR was maintained beyond Year 1. In terms of disability progression, a statistically significant 
effect over placebo was only apparent for Plegridy every 2 weeks. 
The  two  dosing  regimens  tested  in  the  pivotal  trial  (every  2  weeks  versus  every  4  weeks) 
generally showed comparable effect sizes at Year 1 of study 301. The difference became larger, 
though  still  rather  small,  over  2  years  of  treatment,  at  least  in  terms  of  ARR.  This  was 
supported by comparative efficacy analyses for clinical and key MRI outcomes.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Efficacy  of  Plegridy  was  primarily  supported  by  one-year  placebo-controlled  data  from  study 
301.  However,  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the 
treatment  of  multiple  sclerosis  (CPMP/EWP/561/98  Rev.  1,  hereafter  referred  to  as  MS 
guideline)  requires  that  efficacy  is  confirmed  over  a  period  of  2 years.  Two-year  results  were 
available  and  despite  the  lack  of  a  comparator  arm,  they  provided  some  support  for 
maintenance of the effect.  
Only  patients  with  relapsing-remitting  MS  (RRMS)  were  included  in  the  studies;  they  were 
rather  mildly  affected  and  mostly  treatment-naïve  to  MS  medications.  The  CHMP  considered 
that  the  lack  of  data  in  patients  with  high  disease  activity  and  prior  MS  treatment  was 
adequately  reflected  in  SmPC  section  5.1.  However,  while  the  CHMP  agreed  that  efficacy  of 
Plegridy  has  been  demonstrated  in  RRMS  patients,  this  was  not  the  case  for  a  wider  MS 
population,  i.e.  RMS  as  initially  proposed  by  the  applicant,  and  therefore  only  an  indication  in 
RRMS was supported. 
The  age  limit  for  subject  inclusion  was  increased  while  the  study  was  on-going  for  two  years. 
However, less than 1% of the enrolled patients were over the age of 59 years. Therefore, lack 
of data in the elderly was reflected in the product information. 
The  definition  of  sustained  progression  to  disability  was  unconventional.  Based  on  the  MS 
guideline,  sustained  worsening  is  defined  as  an  increase  in  EDSS  score  by  1  point  in  patients 
with  a  baseline  EDSS  <5.5  points  and  by  0.5  point  if  the  EDSS  at  baseline  is  ≥5.5  points. 
Furthermore,  accurate  and  reliable  definition  of  sustained  worsening  for  this  chronic  disease 
should include an assessment of disability over 6 months (24 weeks). Analyses in line with this 
definition  were  only  generated  post-hoc  and  showed  smaller  effect  sizes  as  compared  to  the 
results from the primary analysis. Results for the dosing regimen every 4 weeks did not reach 
statistical significance. Overall, considering shortcomings in the study design with regard to the 
lack of placebo-controlled data beyond Year 1, the CHMP considered that the effect on disability 
Assessment report  
EMA/339024/2014 Rev 1 
Page 93/98 
 
  
  
progression has not robustly been shown and therefore did not support a specific claim in the 
indication. 
The  pivotal  study  did  not  include  an  active  comparator,  which,  although  not  essential  in 
establishing  a  favourable  benefit/risk  balance,  would  have  provided  valuable  additional 
information  on  relative  efficacy  for  treating  physicians  and  patients  switching  between 
pegylated  and  non-pegylated  interferon-beta.  Only  data  from  an  indirect  across-study 
comparison  was  available.  While  supportive,  these  data  cannot  be  taken  as  proof  of  similar 
effects.  This  is  also  true  for  the  comparison  of  neopterin,  a  secondary  PD  marker,  in  healthy 
volunteers  and  of  profiles  of  interferon-responsive  genes  expression,  which  did  not  further 
elucidate similarities or potential differences.  
One  of  the  possible  advantages  of  Plegridy  could  be  an  increased  patient  adherence  and 
convenience due to a less frequent dosing scheme compared to non-pegylated beta interferons 
as  well  as  due  to  the  SC  route  of  administration.  Based  on  the  available  data,  treatment 
compliance  and  adherence  appeared  indeed  to  be  good,  but  as  direct  comparison  to  non-
pegylated interferon treatment (e.g. Avonex) was missing, no firm conclusions could be drawn. 
While  generally,  the  effect  of  Plegridy  was  similar  across  demographics  and  baseline  disease 
characteristics,  in  two  subgroups  representing  patients  with2  higher  disease  activity  (≥  4 
relapses within 3 years prior to study entry) and patients who prior to study start had received 
other  MS  treatments,  no  benefit  over  placebo  was  seen  for  some  of  the  relevant  endpoints. 
However, the number of patients was too small to draw firm conclusions and information on the 
patient population was adequately reflected in SmPC, section 5.1. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  database  presented  with  this  application  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be 
acceptable  both  in  term  of  numbers  of  patients  as  well  as  considering  the  duration  of  use. 
Overall,  the  BIIB017  experience  amounted  to  1468  patients  (1932  patient  years)  and  a 
maximum of 196 weeks of exposure, with about 800 patients treated up to 2 years and about 
100 patients with up to 3 years exposure. At the time of this report, long term safety data were 
still being generated (study 302). 
Compared  to  placebo  the  overall  incidence  of  any  adverse  events  was  higher,  i.e.  83%  for 
placebo versus 94% in both BIIB017 treatment groups. The overall incidence of any treatment-
related  adverse  event  was  also  higher,  i.e.  53%  for  placebo  versus  90%  in  both  BIIB017 
treatment groups. Most common adverse events concerned injection-site events  and influenza-
like illness and symptoms including headache, myalgia, chills, asthenia, arthralgia, fatigue, and 
pain in the extremities. The majority of these events were mild or moderate in severity. 
Adverse  events  of  special  interest  were  flu-like  symptoms,  injection  site  reactions,  hepatic 
disorders,  autoimmune  disorders,  seizures,  depression  and  suicide  ideation,  hypersensitivity 
reactions,  haematological  laboratory  abnormalities  and  abnormal  liver  function  tests.  AEs 
identified of special interest due to the immunomodulatory mechanism of action were infections 
and malignancies.

prior MS medication rather than those without prior therapy (treatment-naïve)

Flu-like  symptoms  were  common  in  the  active  study  arms  and  one  of  the  main  reasons  for 
treatment  failure.  While  the  safety  profile  of  Plegridy  was  overall  comparable  with  non-
pegylated  beta  interferons  in  this  respect,  the  low  incidence  of  severe  flu-like  illness,  low 
percentage days of flu-like symptoms and low rate of discontinuation due to flu-like syndrome 
(1%,  74/740)  indicated  that  this  was  not  a  major  issue  for  Plegridy.  As  for  other  interferons, 
dose titration is recommended to ameliorate flu-like symptoms at the beginning of treatment. 
Based  on  the  current  safety  database,  it  appeared  that  Plegridy  was  not  associated  with  an 
increased  risk  of  infections,  opportunist  infections,  autoimmune  disorders,  seizures  or 
depression/suicidal  ideation.  Nevertheless  relevant  safety  information  for  these  events  related 
to  the  class  of  interferons  was  included  in  the  product  information  and  the  risk  management 
plan of Plegridy, as appropriate. 
Cases  of  hepatic  damage  and  liver  enzyme  abnormalities  were  observed  in  clinical  trials  with 
Plegridy  as  were  decreases  of  cell  counts  in  all  blood  cell  lines.  These  effects  were  not 
unexpected  and,  overall,  Plegridy  showed  an  hepatic  and  haematological  safety  profile  in 
between  non-pegylated  interferon  beta-1a  products  (Avonex  and  Rebif).  Therefore,  regular 
monitoring of these parameters was considered appropriate, which has been reflected in SmPC 
section 4.4 similar to other beta interferons. 
Numerically,  more  events  of  injection  site  reactions,  hepatic  disorders,  liver  function 
abnormalities and hypersensitivity reactions were observed for the every 2 weeks dose regimen 
as  compared  to  the  every  4  weeks  dose  regimen.  Although  the  differences  were  small,  taken 
together  they  sum  up  to  a  slightly  less  favourable  safety  profile  of  the  every  2  weeks  dosing 
schedule compared to the every 4 weeks regimen. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Based  on  the  available  data,  there  were  uncertainties  with  regards  to  the  immunogenic 
potential of Plegridy. While overall there was no clear signal for increased immunogenicity with 
prolonged use of the product, the duration of treatment was considered by the CHMP to be too 
short to fully elucidate the exact degree and impact. Further monitoring was encouraged and to 
this end immunogenicity has been referred to in the RMP as important potential risk and will be 
further addressed throughout extension study 302.  
No direct comparison of safety between Plegridy and other beta interferons could be made due 
to the lack of an active control in the pivotal trial. Based on a review of data from the placebo-
controlled  pivotal  study  301  and  available  data  from  controlled  clinical  studies  for  other 
approved  non-pegylated  interferon  beta-1a  products  (Avonex  and  Rebif),  the  safety  profile  of 
Plegridy  appeared  generally  consistent  with  that  of  existing  non-pegylated  beta  interferon  MS 
therapies.  However,  the  CHMP  noted  that  a  comparative  exercise  involving  a  non-pegylated 
interferon  beta-1a  based  on  e.g.  PK/PD  parameters,  would  further  clarify  the  safety  profile  of 
Plegridy. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Efficacy of peginterferon beta-1a was demonstrated in terms of effects on annual relapse rate 
and  time  to  sustained  disability  progression.  Whilst  modest,  the  effect  size  appeared  to  be 
comparable to that of other beta-interferons approved for MS treatment, which was considered

clinically  relevant.  The  patient  population  was  representative  of  the  target  population  for 
interferons,  i.e.  rather  mildly  affected  RRMS  patients,  and  efficacy  of  Plegridy  was  considered 
demonstrated in this population.  
Overall  the  safety  profile  of  Plegridy  appeared  to  be  comparable  to  non-pegylated  beta 
interferon  MS  therapies.  Flu-like  symptoms  and  injection-site  reactions  were  common  under 
treatment  with  Plegridy  and  were  generally  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Efficacy  and  safety 
remained  unaltered  for  subjects  with  and  without  antibody  formation  and  overall  the 
immunogenic potential was considered to be likely small. 
A slightly inferior safety profile was observed for the every 2 weeks dosing scheme compared to 
the  every  4  weeks  regimen.  However,  safety  was  generally  manageable  for  doses  every  2 
weeks. At the same time, a numerical advantage of the every 2 weeks regimen was observed 
in terms of efficacy. This was further supported by comparative efficacy analyses for clinical and 
key MRI outcomes. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance  
Despite  the  deficiencies  in  the  clinical  development  programme,  in  particular  the  lack  of  an 
active  comparator  and  the  fact  that  placebo-controlled  data  were  only  available  for  one  year, 
which  is  not  in  line  with  the  requirements  stated  in  the  MS  guideline,  overall,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  the  programme  was  satisfactory,  taking  into  account  that  Plegridy  is  a 
pegylated form of beta-interferons, a well-established class of MS products for which extensive 
clinical experience existed at the time of this report.  
The CHMP did not agree that the benefit/risk profile could be extrapolated from RRMS patients, 
included in the pivotal trial, to the wider population of RMS patients. In addition, the effect on 
disability progression has not robustly been shown.  
The magnitude of the observed treatment effect was rather modest. The observed reduction in 
relapse  rate  would  mean  that  a  patient  will  suffer  on  average  one  relapse  in  4  years  with 
peginterferon  beta-1a  treatment  as  compared  to  one  relapse  in  3  years  without  disease 
modifying  treatment.  However,  the  effect  size  was  in  line  with  that  of  non-pegylated  beta 
interferon, which was considered of clinical relevance.  
The  safety  profile  of  Plegridy  appeared  to  be  comparable  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  non-
pegylated  beta-interferons  and  no  new  unexpected  safety  issues  emerged  from  the  available 
data.  
The  benefit-risk  profile of  peginterferon  beta-1a  would  position  Plegridy  as  a  first  line  therapy 
amongst  other  interferons  in  patients  with  RRMS.  The  less  frequent  SC  dosing  schedule  was 
considered by the CHMP of benefit to patients as other interferons require more frequent dosing 
and some need to be injected via the IM route. However, due to the lack of comparative data, it 
was  not  possible  to  exclude  without  doubt  differences  in  the  effect  size  of  non-pegylated 
interferon-beta  and  peginterferon-beta.  Considering  the  modest  magnitude  of  effect,  any 
difference  in  the  effect  size  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be  important  with  a  view  to 
switching patients from one interferon product to the other, which may be expected in clinical 
practice given the less frequent need for injections with Plegridy. While it was acknowledged by 
the  CHMP  that  loss  of  efficacy  could  be  difficult  to  detect  in  clinical  practice,  especially  in  a 
rather mild MS population, as relapses usually occur infrequently and even in some cases with

years  in  between  consecutive relapses,  comparative  data  would  have  been  valuable  for 
prescribers  and patients.  Since  the  active  principle and  mechanism  of  action of  pegylated  and 
non-pegylated interferons are the same, clinical data focussing on MRI endpoints to assess the 
relative  anti-inflammatory  effect  may  have  been  considered  sufficient  to  indicate  comparable 
efficacy.  However,  the  CHMP  pointed  out  that  this  was  a  specific  case  and  that,  normally, 
clinical  endpoints  in  line  with  the  MS  guideline  were  required  to  establish  patient  benefit  of  a 
new  active  substance  in  the  treatment  of  MS  and  approval  of  disease-modifying  therapies 
based  on  MRI  endpoints  only  was  not  possible.  Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  prescribers 
should be informed about the lack of direct comparative data through adequate information in 
the SmPC. 
With regard to the two dosing regimens tested in the pivotal trial, the CHMP concluded that the 
every  2  weeks  dosing  regimen,  on  balance,  offered  a  slightly  more  favourable  benefit/risk 
balance,  based  on  better  efficacy,  for  all  patient  groups  and  that  no  subgroup  could  be 
identified  for  which  the  less  frequent  dosing  regimen  (every  4  weeks)  would  be  more 
appropriate.   
All adverse reactions and safety concerns associated with Plegridy were considered adequately 
described  in  the  product  information  and  the  RMP,  which  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  be 
sufficient  to  manage  the  risks.  Long-term  data  will  become  available  from  the  extension 
study 302 and these data will allow to further characterise the benefit/risk balance of Plegridy. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the available quality, efficacy and safety data, the CHMP considered that the benefits 
of  Plegridy  in  the  treatment  of  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis  in  adult  patients  and 
subject  to  the  agreed  product  information  and  the  risk  management  plan,  outweigh  its  risks. 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk balance was favourable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Plegridy in the treatment of relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis in adult patients is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of 
the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

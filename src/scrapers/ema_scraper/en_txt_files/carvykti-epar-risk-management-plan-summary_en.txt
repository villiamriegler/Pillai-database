SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of Risk Management Plan for ciltacabtagene autoleucel
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  CARVYKTI.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of CARVYKTI, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about CARVYKTI’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
CARVYKTI’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how CARVYKTI should be used.
This summary of the RMP for CARVYKTI should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
CARVYKTI’s RMP.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
I. 
CARVYKTI is authorized for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma  who  have  received  at  least  3  prior  therapies,  including  an  immunomodulatory  agent 
(IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease 
progression  on  the  last  therapy  (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It  contains  ciltacabtagene 
autoleucel as the active substance and is given via intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of CARVYKTI’s benefits can be found in CARVYKTI’s 
EPAR,  including in  its  plain-language summary,  available on the European  Medicines Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/carvykti.

Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further
Characterize the Risks
Important risks of CARVYKTI, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about CARVYKTI’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:



Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;

The  medicine’s  legal  status  — the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (eg,  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of CARVYKTI, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analyzed  including Periodic  Benefit-Risk  Evaluation  Report/Periodic  Safety  Update 
Report assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of CARVYKTI is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of CARVYKTI are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is  sufficient proof  of a link  with the use  of  CARVYKTI. Potential risks  are concerns  for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is  currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks
Important Identified Risk:  Cytokine release syndrome (including HLH) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
CRS, including events that were fatal or life-threatening, has been 
reported in patients treated with CARVYKTI in clinical trials and 
CRS was identified as an adverse reaction. The risk for CRS and 
information regarding this adverse reaction are described in the 
SmPC for CARVYKTI. 
CAR-T-related CRS is commonly described in the literature, with 
several published guidelines for toxicity grading and management. 
For CARVYKTI clinical trials, CRS was graded using American 
Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) 2019 
criteria as predefined in the trial protocols.
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) occurring in the 
context of CAR-T cell therapies can be a potential manifestation of 
severe CRS. 
Based on the strength of evidence from the clinical trial data and 
information from the literature, CRS (including HLH) is 
considered an important identified risk for CARVYKTI.
Risk factors for severe CRS include high pre-infusion tumor 
burden, active infection, and early onset of fever or persistent fever 
after 24 hours of symptomatic treatment. Active uncontrolled 
infection was an exclusionary criterion in clinical trials.

Important Identified Risk:  Neurologic toxicities (including ICANS and other neurotoxicities)
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Cases of CAR-T cell neurologic toxicities have been reported for 
subjects treated with CARVYKTI in clinical trials, and have 
included both ICANS as well as other neurotoxicity determined by 
the investigator to be related to CAR-T therapy and occurring after 
recovery of CRS and/or ICANS. Specific types of neurotoxicity 
other than ICANS include movement and neurocognitive toxicity 
with signs and symptoms of Parkinsonism, GBS, peripheral 
neuropathy, and cranial nerve palsies. Note that ICANS and other 
neurotoxicities are not mutually exclusive as patients can 
experience both ICANS and other neurotoxicity. 
Neurologic toxicities (including ICANS and other neurotoxicities) 
were identified as an adverse reaction. The risk for neurologic 
toxicities and information regarding this adverse reaction are 
described in the SmPC for CARVYKTI.
While ICANS and other neurotoxicities (occurring within 8 weeks 
of infusion) associated with CAR-T therapy are well described in 
Risk factors and risk groups
the literature, information on late onset of neurological events 
(ie, onset >8 weeks after CAR T cell infusion) is still evolving.
Based on the known risk associated with CAR-T therapies, as well 
as on the strength of evidence from clinical trials of CARVYKTI, 
neurologic toxicities (including ICANS and other neurotoxicities) 
is considered an important identified risk.
A known risk factor for neurologic toxicity with the use of CAR-T 
therapy is concurrent or resolved CRS. The cluster of movement 
and neurocognitive events appears to be potentially associated with 
a combination of two or more factors such as high tumor burden, 
prior Grade 2 or higher CRS, prior ICANS, and high CAR-T cell 
expansion and persistence.

Important Identified Risk:  Prolonged or recurrent cytopenia (excluding anemia)
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Cytopenia has been identified as one of the most common adverse 
reactions in patients after receiving CARVYKTI. Cases of 
prolonged cytopenia (not resolved by Day 30) have been reported 
for subjects treated with CARVYKTI in clinical trials and 
prolonged cytopenia has been identified as an adverse reaction. In 
addition, cases of cytopenia recurring after 60 days post-infusion 
have been reported in clinical trials of CARVYKTI. The risk for 
prolonged or recurrent cytopenia and information regarding this 
adverse reaction are described in the SmPC for CARVYKTI. 
Evidence from clinical data with CARVYKTI suggests a drug 
association, including temporal association and persistence. 
Anemia begins to appear after lymphodepleting therapy but 
typically resolves within approximately 3 weeks post-infusion, and 
hemoglobin continues to rise thereafter, suggesting that bone 
marrow hematopoiesis improves following CAR-T therapy. 
Because of this, anemia is not considered an important risk of 
CARVYKTI. Some cases of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
lymphopenia continued for a longer period of time, with some 
recurrences of Grade 3 or 4 after Day 60.
Based on the incidence, temporal association, and persistence of 
the events in clinical trials, prolonged or recurrent cytopenia 
(excluding anemia) is considered an important identified risk for 
CARVYKTI.
Risk factors that may contribute to the development of cytopenia 
include the type of background therapy, bone marrow function, 
and disease progression. The use of bridging therapy and 
lymphodepletion prior to CARVYKTI administration is also a risk 
factor. Other factors include pre-existing neutropenia, or the 
concurrent use of antibiotics, corticosteroids, or symptomatic

Important Identified Risk:  Serious infections
Evidence for linking the risk to

Serious infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, 
have been reported with subjects treated with CARVYKTI in 
clinical trials and serious infection has been identified as an 
Risk factors and risk groups
adverse reaction. The risk for serious infection and information 
regarding this adverse reaction are described in the SmPC for 
CARVYKTI. 
Based on the strength of evidence from clinical trials, serious 
infections are considered an important identified risk for 
CARVYKTI.
Patients with multiple myeloma are at risk of infection due to the 
overproduction of ineffective monoclonal antibodies from the 
underlying disease, which causes immune dysfunction. 
Additionally, the use of chemotherapy (including bridging therapy 
and lymphodepletion prior to CARVYKTI administration) and 
immunosuppressive treatments may increase the risk of infection. 
Multiple myeloma patients have as much as a 15-fold increase in 
risk of infections, particularly pneumonia. Risk factors for fatal 
COVID-19 infection include comorbidities associated with 
severe/fatal COVID-19 such as diabetes and obesity, and 
concomitant use of immune-suppressant medications.

Important Identified Risk:  Hypogammaglobulinemia
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Hypogammaglobulinemia has been reported with subjects treated 
with CARVYKTI in clinical trials and hypogammaglobulinemia 
has been identified as an adverse reaction. The risk for 
hypogammaglobulinemia and information regarding this adverse 
reaction are described in the SmPC for CARVYKTI.
Based on the strength of evidence from clinical trials, including 
incidence and temporal association, hypogammaglobulinemia is 
considered an important identified risk for CARVYKTI.
Patients with multiple myeloma are at risk of developing 
hypogammaglobulinemia and are prone to infection. 
Hypogammaglobulinemia can be intrinsic to the disease, occurring 
in 45% to 83% of patients with asymptomatic multiple myeloma 
(ie, SMM) at some point during the disease course (Patel 2019). 
The most common infections in these early-stage patients involve 
the respiratory tract and are predominantly caused by encapsulated 
bacteria such as H. influenzae or S. pneumonia, and viral 
reactivation, suggesting a role of hypogammaglobulinemia in their 
pathogenesis (Compagno 2014). It is also frequently associated 
with chemo immunotherapy regimens used to treat the disease, 
particularly those that either deplete B cells and plasma cells, or 
inhibit B cell survival, impair activation or interaction with T cells. 
Multiple prior lines of therapy and low IgG baseline values may 
increase the risk of developing hypogammaglobulinemia in 
patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. Finally, patients with co 
morbidities, such as chronic lung or heart disease and extra-
articular rheumatoid arthritis, have also been reported to have 
higher instances of hypogammaglobulinemia (Patel 2019).

theoretical risk from lentiviral vector DNA insertion and 
replication competent lentivirus (RCL), second primary 
malignancy is considered an important potential risk.

Important Potential Risk:  Tumor Lysis Syndrome
Evidence for linking the risk to

Risk factors and risk groups
The incidence of TLS was low in clinical trials of CARVYKTI, 
with only one confounded case of TLS reporting as of the data 
cutoff. However, a biological plausibility may exist for risk of 
developing TLS in multiple myeloma patients with extensive 
disease burden and/or plasmacytomas, considering the 
antimyeloma effects of CARVYKTI. Therefore, TLS is considered 
an important potential risk.
Patients at high risk for TLS include those with a high tumor 
burden (≥60% plasma cell infiltrate on the bone marrow biopsy or 
aspirate [whichever is higher] or those with multiple 
extramedullary disease sites and/or plasmacytomas.

Important Potential Risk:  Aggravation of Graft versus Host Disease
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
No cases of aggravated or de novo GvHD have been reported in 
clinical trials of CARVYKTI to date. However, a biological 
plausibility may exist for increased risk of aggravation of GvHD, 
particularly in patients receiving allogenic transplant prior to 6 
months of CARVYKTI or still receiving immunosuppressants to 
control a prior event of GvHD after allogenic transplant who will 
not be restricted from receiving CARVYKTI. Therefore, 
aggravation of GvHD is considered a potential risk.
Risk factors for developing GvHD in multiple myeloma patients 
after receiving allogenic transplant include the following: higher 
degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch, older age of 
the donor or recipient, sex disparity between donor and recipient, 
prior acute GvHD (aGvHD), a splenectomized recipient, CMV 
seropositivity in the donor or recipient, donor EBV seropositivity. 
The probability of developing a subsequent acute or chronic 
GVHD increases with increasing numbers of risk factors 
(Hill 2021). Patients receiving allogenic transplant prior to 
6 months of CARVYKTI or still receiving immunosuppressants to 
control a prior event of GvHD after allogenic transplant may be at 
increased risk for aggravation of GvHD.

Important Potential Risk:  Generation of Replication Competent Lentivirus
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
While no cases of generation of RCL have been reported to date in 
clinical trials of CARVYKTI, this is a potential risk due to 
potential viral insertion (DNA integration) of the lentiviral vector.
Risk factors and risk groups
All patients who receive CARVYKTI are theoretically at risk.

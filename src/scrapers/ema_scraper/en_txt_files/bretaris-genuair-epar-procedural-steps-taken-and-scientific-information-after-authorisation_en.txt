The MAH submitted the final study report for study 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Submission of the final study report from study 
D6570R00002 listed as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. This is a descriptive, non-interventional, 
multinational European cohort study of new users of 
aclidinium, aclidinium/formoterol, and other selected 
COPD medications. The following safety concerns 
listed as missing information in the RMP: ‘safety in 
patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment’ and 
‘safety in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia 
or urinary retention’ are removed. The updated RMP 
version 8.0 is acceptable.

D6570R00002 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This 
is a descriptive, non-interventional, multinational European 
cohort study of new users of aclidinium, 
aclidinium/formoterol, and other selected COPD 
medications. New users of aclidinium and 
aclidinium/formoterol were characterised as a population 
with high prevalence of chronic comorbidity, high use of co-
medications and more severe chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) than users of other non-LAMA 
COPD medications. Off-label use of aclidinium and 
aclidinium/formoterol was observed to be low and the main 
reason was having a diagnosis of asthma in the absence of 
a recorded diagnosis of COPD. Discontinuation and 
switching for both drugs were important during follow-up 
period. The following safety concerns ‘safety in patients 
with hepatic or severe renal impairment’ and ‘safety in 
patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or urinary 
retention’ are no longer considered as Missing Information 
and are thus removed from the RMP.

The procedure was initially submitted as a modification of 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Updates of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in 
order to add safety and efficacy information based on 
the ASCENT study, a phase IV double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
outcome study to evaluate the effect of aclidinium on 
cardiovascular (CV) safety and COPD exacerbations 
in patients with moderate to very severe COPD, and 
prior history of CV events or CV risk factors. In 
addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives 
in the Package Leaflet for Bretaris Genuair and to 
implement minor editorial changes in section 4.4, 
4.6, 5.3 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL for both 
Eklira Genuair and Bretaris Genuair. 
The worksharing procedure leads to amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or 
indication in order to reflect the reduction of COPD 
exacerbations in the approved indication (section 4.1 of the 
SmPC). The evaluation of the data presented by the MAH 
led to an update of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
to describe information that may be relevant for the 
prescribers to take decisions in the step wise approach to 
COPD management. Results from the ASCENT study did not 
allow ascertaining the exact contribution of Eklira/Bretaris 
Genuair to the reduction in the rate of exacerbations 
therefore the revision of the indication was not accepted by 
the CHMP. However, the data were considered relevant 
from the clinical point of view taking into account the 
known correlation between exacerbations and 
morbidity/mortality. The following data are added to 
section 5.1 of the SmPC:  
Long Term Safety and Efficacy Trial up to 3 years 
The effect of aclidinium bromide on the occurrence of major 
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was assessed in a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study in 3630 adult patients between 40 and 91 
years of age with moderate to very severe COPD, treated 
for up to 36 months. 58.7% were male and 90.7% were 
Caucasian, with a mean postbronchodilator FEV1 of 47.9%

modification of an approved one 
of predicted value and a mean CAT (COPD Assessment 
Test) of 20.7. All patients had a history of cardiovascular or 
cerebrovascular disease and/or significant cardiovascular 
risk factors. 59.8% of patients had at least one COPD 
exacerbation within the past 12 months from the screening 
visit. Approximately 48% of enrolled patients had a prior 
history of at least 1 documented previous cardiovascular 
event; cerebrovascular disease (13.1%), coronary artery 
disease (35.4%), peripheral vascular disease or history of 
claudication (13.6%).  
The study had an event-driven design and was terminated 
once sufficient MACE events for the primary safety analysis 
were observed. Patients discontinued treatment if they 
experienced a MACE event and entered into the post-
treatment follow-up period during the study. 70.7% of 
patients completed the study per investigator assessment. 
The median time on-treatment in the Eklira Genuair and 
placebo groups was 1.1 and 1 year, respectively. The 
median time on-study in the Eklira Genuair and placebo 
groups was approximately 1.4 and 1.3 years, respectively.  
The primary safety endpoint was the time to first 
occurrence of MACE, defined as any of the following 
adjudicated events: cardiovascular death, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction (MI), or non-fatal ischemic stroke. 
The frequency of patients with at least one MACE was 
3.85% vs. 4.23% patients in the aclidinium and placebo 
groups, respectively. Eklira Genuair did not increase the 
MACE risk in patients with COPD compared to placebo when 
added to current background therapy (hazard ratio (HR) 
0.89; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.23). The upper bound of the 
confidence interval excluded a pre-defined risk margin of 
1.8. 
Page 6/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations per 
patient per year during the first year of treatment was 
evaluated as the primary efficacy endpoint in the study. 
Patients treated with Eklira Genuair showed a statistically 
significant reduction of 22% compared to placebo (rate 
ratio [RR] 0.78; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89; p<0.001). In 
addition, Eklira Genuair showed a statistically significant 
reduction of 35% in the rate of hospitalisations due to 
COPD exacerbations while on-treatment during the first 
year compared with placebo (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.48 to 
0.89; p=0.006). 
The Eklira Genuair group showed a statistically significant 
delay in the time to first moderate or severe exacerbation 
while on-treatment compared to the placebo group. 
Patients in the aclidinium bromide group had a 18% 
relative reduction of the risk of an exacerbation (HR 0.82; 
95% CI [0.73, 0.92], p<0.001).

Labelling and 
placebo-controlled clinical study to assess the effect of 
tolerance study M/34273/40. Additionally, a better 
description of the potential taste has been included 
in the Instructions for use in section 4.2 of the SmPC 
and in the package leaflet. The product information 
has been amended with minor linguistic changes and 
to include the statement on additional monitoring in

aclidinium bromide 400 μg BID on exercise endurance in 
patients with moderate to severe, stable chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease) in which aclidinium bromide 
was associated with a statistically significant improvement 
in exercise endurance time in comparison to placebo of 58 
seconds (95% CI=9-108; p=0.021; pre-treatment value: 
486 seconds). 
Aclidinium bromide statistically significantly reduced lung 
hyperinflation at rest (functional residual capacity 
[FRC]=0.197 L [95% CI=0.321, 0.072; p=0.002]; residual 
volume [RV]=0.238 L [95% CI=0.396, 0.079; p=0.004]) 
and also improved trough inspiratory capacity (by 0.078 L; 
95% CI=0.01, 0.145; p=0.025) and reduced dyspnoea 
during exercise (Borg scale) (by 0.63 Borg units; 95% 
CI=1.11, 0.14; p=0.012). 
The CHMP concluded that the improvement in exercise 
endurance time demonstrated in study M/34273/40 in 
conjunction with the improvements seen in other lung 
parameters can be considered to be clinically relevant in

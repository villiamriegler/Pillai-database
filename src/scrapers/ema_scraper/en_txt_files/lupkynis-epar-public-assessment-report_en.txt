2. Scientific discussion 
2.1 Problem statement 
2.1.1 Disease or condition 
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease which primarily affects women 
between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Lupus Nephritis (LN) is the most common serious manifestation 
of SLE and is a debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition. 
2.1.2 Epidemiology  
The prevalence of LN in Europe has been estimated to be between 0.44 and 1.4 per 10,000 based on 
studies of patients with LN in the UK, Norway and Denmark [Patel et al 2006, Eilertsen et al 2011, 
Hermansen et al 2016]. The prevalence of SLE and the chances of developing LN vary considerably 
across different regions of the world and across different races and ethnicities. Hanly and colleagues 
studied a large (N=1,827) multi-ethnic cohort of patients with SLE across the EU, US, Canada, Mexico 
and Asia [Hanly et al 2016]. SLE was diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
criteria and LN was defined by the ISN/RPS Classification [Hochberg 1997, Tan et al 1982, Weening et 
al 2004]. The proportion of patients with SLE who developed LN by race/ethnicity was: 20.3% 
Caucasian, 36.8% Asian, 39.9% African; 49.3% Hispanic and 33.8% other [Hanly et al 2016]. Similar 
findings have been reported by a study in the UK in which 10% of White patients with SLE developed 
LN compared with 27% of patients of Indo-Asian descent and 58% of patients of Afro-Caribbean 
descent [Patel et al 2006].  
There is evidence that Black and Hispanic patients with SLE develop LN earlier and have worse 
outcomes than White patients with SLE, including death and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [Almaani 
et al 2017, Contreras et al 2006]. 
2.1.3 Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
In patients with LN, renal damage results in proteinuria and/or hematuria and a decrease in renal 
function as evidenced by reduced creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).  
It is estimated that 10%-30% of patients with LN will develop ESRD, the presence of which has been 
associated with a 26-fold increase in mortality risk compared with a demographically matched general 
population [Almaani et al 2017, Costenbader et al 2011, Tektonidou et al 2016, Yap et al 2012]. 
Proteinuria is the defining aspect of LN and indicates damage to the kidney; if not resolved this 
damage becomes permanent. A rapid reduction in proteinuria is, therefore, an important goal of 
treatment in LN [Fanouriakis et al 2020]. 
LN is divided into different classes (I-VI) according to the International Society of Nephrology and the 
Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) 2003 Classification of LN [Weening et al 2004]. Treatment of LN is 
based in large part on the classification according to these criteria. The proliferative classes (III and 
IV) require aggressive treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. Class V 
(membranous LN) is treated similarly to Classes III/IV if it is associated with nephrotic range 
proteinuria or is combined with Classes III/IV. In contrast, Classes I and II generally do not require 
immunosuppressive therapy and patients with Class VI LN are considered to be candidates for renal 
transplant [Fanouriakis et al 2020, Hahn et al 2012]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 9/10 
 
 
 
In conclusion, LN is a serious condition which is associated with an increased risk of ESRD and 
mortality. 
2.1.4 Management 
The current treatment approach for LN has remained broadly unchanged over the past 10 years and 
consists of high dose corticosteroids plus off-label use of an immunosuppressant such as 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), cyclophosphamide, or azathioprine. In May 2021, belimumab was 
approved in the EU for use in combination with background immunosuppressive therapies for the 
treatment of adult patients with active LN.  
The 2019 update of the European League Against Rheumatism/European Renal Association-European 
Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERA-EDTA) recommendations for the management of LN 
provides guidance to physicians treating LN [Fanouriakis et al 2020]. Initial treatment with 
immunosuppressive agents (MMF [2 3 g/day] or intravenous (IV) low-dose cyclophosphamide [500 mg 
every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses]) in combination with corticosteroids are recommended for Class 
III (±Class V) and Class IV (±Class V) LN, with similar recommendations for pure Class V LN where it 
is associated with nephrotic range proteinuria. If improvement after initial treatment is achieved, 
subsequent immunosuppression is recommended with either MMF (1 2 g/day) or azathioprine (2 
mg/kg/day). Although the EULAR guidelines were published prior to the approval of belimumab, they 
state that belimumab may be considered as an off label add on treatment.  
For patients with adverse clinical (GFR between 25 and 80 mL/min), histological (crescents or necrosis 
in >25% of glomeruli) or non-specific urinary sediment prognostic factors, the guidelines state that 
high dose cyclophosphamide (0.5-0.75 g/m2 monthly for 6 months) can be considered. In pure Class V 
LN, MMF is recommended at the same doses as in Class III/IV disease but the guidelines acknowledge 
that there is no high-quality evidence to guide treatment. A combination of MMF with a CNI such as 
tacrolimus is recommended as an alternative in patients with nephrotic range proteinuria [Fanouriakis 
et al 2020]. However, treatment with both tacrolimus and cyclosporine A is associated with a range of 
side effects which are associated with a need for therapeutic drug monitoring. Increased blood 
pressure and acute renal vasomotor effects are well-known potential toxicities of CNIs that are dose-
related, reversible, and responsive to dose reduction or temporary interruption of treatment [Wiseman 
2016]. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients with LN, in the absence of any 
contraindications, to reduce risk of kidney flares and improve survival [Fanouriakis et al 2020].  
Cyclophosphamide is given as an IV infusion in one of two treatment regimens: low dose 
cyclophosphamide, which is commonly used in Europe, or the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
regimen, which is most commonly used in the US. A large, double blind, international, randomised trial 
in 370 patients with LN - the Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS) - investigated the efficacy of 
MMF and cyclophosphamide (modified NIH regimen) and found no difference in the efficacy of MMF 
plus corticosteroids versus cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids [Appel et al 2009]. The efficacy of 
low-dose cyclophosphamide has been shown to be comparable to that of high-dose cyclophosphamide 
in the Euro-lupus trial which enrolled 90 patients with proliferative LN [Houssiau et al 2002]. Due to 
the toxicity concerns surrounding cyclophosphamide, MMF is widely used as the treatment of choice 
[Almaani et al 2017]. However, given the teratogenicity of MMF, azathioprine is used in women of 
child-bearing potential who may wish to become pregnant.  
Historically, treatment for LN was divided into two distinct phases: an induction/initial treatment phase 
during which patients received cyclophosphamide or MMF and high doses of corticosteroids and a 
maintenance phase in which the doses of all drugs were reduced in order to improve tolerability [Hahn 
et al 2012]. This treatment paradigm has its origins in the early trials for LN where monthly infusions 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 10/11 
 
 
 
of cyclophosphamide were established as the standard of care [Austin et al 1986]. Since IV 
cyclophosphamide is associated with considerable toxicity, including irreversible infertility and embryo 
fetal toxicity, there were concerns around long term use and several studies demonstrated that short-
term therapy (3 6 months) with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids could be used to induce 
remission, with MMF or azathioprine added as maintenance therapy [Contreras et al 2004, Chan et al 
1995].  
Although the recently published EULAR/ERA-EDTA guidelines still refer to initial treatment and 
maintenance treatment, the difference between the two phases has become less obvious. One key 
difference between the initial and maintenance phases is that cyclophosphamide is recommended only 
for the initial treatment phase with patients being switched to MMF or azathioprine for maintenance 
treatment. As discussed above, this is due to the toxicity of cyclophosphamide. However, if the initial 
treatment phase included MMF then the only difference is to consider reducing the dose from 2 3 g/day 
in the initial phase to 1 2 g/day in the maintenance phase, although no specific timeframe is 
recommended for this reduction.  
A pulse of IV corticosteroid is used at the start of the initial treatment phase with patients being 
switched to oral corticosteroids after a few days. The realisation of the adverse effects of long term 
corticosteroid treatment together with the emerging evidence that following initial pulse corticosteroid 
treatment, lower doses of corticosteroids may be as efficacious as high doses led to the EULAR/ERA-
EDTA recommendation to reduce the cumulative corticosteroid dose. The 2019 guidance recommends 
total IV methylprednisolone doses of 500 to 2,500 mg and a starting dose of oral methylprednisone of 
0.3-0.5 mg/day for up to 4 weeks, reducing to ≤7.5 mg/day by 3 6 months [Fanouriakis et al 2020].  
Damage due to both the disease and to treatment accumulates over time and contributes to the high 
morbidity and mortality [Lateef & Petri 2012]. Early treatment to prevent loss of nephrons and 
ultimately improve outcomes is critical. There is an unmet medical need arising from lower than 
desired levels of efficacy combined with organ damage resulting from corticosteroid treatment. 
2.2 About the product 
Voclosporin is a novel CNI which is structurally  similar  to  cyclosporine  A  except  for  the  
modification of a functional group on amino acid-1 of the molecule [Kuglstatter et al 2011]. The 
immunosuppressant activity results in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell cytokine production, 
and expression of T-cell activation surface antigens. Some studies have indicated that CNIs may have 
a protective effect on kidney podocytes by stabilizing the  cytoskeleton  and  inhibiting  podocyte  
apoptosis  [Liao  et  al  2015].  It is claimed by the applicant that voclosporin has several advantages 
over cyclosporine A and tacrolimus: a predictable PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship allowing for 
flat dosing with no need for the monitoring of drug levels required by cyclosporine A and tacrolimus, a 
four-fold  increase  in  potency over cyclosporine A and an enhanced metabolic profile potentially 
resulting in fewer CNI-associated side effects [Abel et al 2004, Mayo et al 2013].

2.3.2 Active substance 
2.3.2.1 General information 
The chemical name of voclosporin is cyclo{[(6E)-(2S,3R,4R)-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)-
6,8-nonadienoyl]-L-2-aminobutyryl-N-methyl-glycyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-L-valyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-L-
alanyl-D-alanyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-L-valyl} corresponding to the molecular 
formula C63 H111N11O12. It has a relative molecular mass of 1214.6 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of voclosporin was elucidated by a combination of IR, MS, 13C-NMR and 1H-
NMR. The solid -tate properties of the active substance were measured by polymorph screening 
(including cooling crystallisation, evaporative crystallisation, precipitation by adding anti-solvent and 
slurry experiments with various solvents and temperatures), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 
and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies.  
The active substance is a white to off-white solid, crystalline hydrate, slight hygroscopic form. Besides 
amorphous material obtained in most of crystallisation experiments, polymorphic forms were produced 
under certain conditions. The form manufactured by the active substance manufacturer is the stable 
form which contains about one molecule of water in the crystal lattice (not tightly bound) and for which 
it has been confirmed that is slightly hygroscopic. DSC and TGA thermograms of the polymorphic 
forms are compared, showing that the forms can be differentiated by thermal analysis. The stable form 
was chosen for development based on crystallinity, physico-chemical and chemical stability, low 
hygroscopicity and synthetic accessibility. As the voclosporin is completely solubilised in the finished 
product formulation, polymorphism is not considered as a critical quality attribute (CQA) for 
voclosporin. Therefore, this attribute is not included as part of the release and stability specification.

Voclosporin is practically insoluble in water. The active substance does not bear readily ionisable 
groups, therefore the pH dependence of the solubility in water is limited. The solubility of voclosporin 
in organic solvents at ambient temperature is stated in Table 1.

Voclosporin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 12 chiral centres and one C=C double 
bond. Voclosporin consists of a mixture of E (trans) and Z (cis) isomers, although the commercial 
synthetic method was developed to produce voclosporin predominantly as the trans isomer (trans 
content between 90% and 95%). Chiral centers are fixed based on the stereochemistry of the 
incoming active substance intermediate, ciclosporin A (CsA). The specific optical rotation of voclosporin 
is controlled in the active substance specification (determined at 20°C in chloroform solution according 
to Ph. Eur. 2.2.7). 
Voclosporin is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself, based on the modification of a 
functional group on the amino acid-1 residue of the ciclosporin A molecule that has led to voclosporin. 
Specifically, voclosporin is a new chemical entity that is not a prodrug of ciclosporin A, is not an 
enantiomer or diastereoisomer of ciclosporin A, is not considered a complex, does not contain an ester 
or ether functional group, is not a salt, and is not a different solid state of ciclosporin A (or any other 
active substance).  
2.3.2.2. Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Voclosporin is synthesised in five main steps using cyclosporine A as active substance intermediate and 
a  starting material, with acceptable specifications. Ciclosporin A contributes as the main structural 
element of voclosporin. As there is a monograph of ciclosporin A in the European Pharmacopoeia, the 
manufacturer of ciclosporin A has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European 
Pharmacopoeia (CEP) which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
The starting material contributes to the terminal olefinic moiety to the modified amino acid-1 sidechain 
of voclosporin. 
The five synthesis steps consist of four chemical steps, resulting in four isolated intermediates and a 
final purification step. The chemical steps include protection, deprotection and two chemical 
transformation steps. The proposed route of synthesis is considered appropriate and in general the 
manufacturing process description is provided in sufficient detail (including quantities of all raw 
materials, process parameters incl. proven acceptable ranges for non-critical parameters and qualified 
ranges for critical parameters, in-process controls employed and expected yields).  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin, fate, purge and characterisation. Nine  specified  impurities,  arising  from  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 13/14 
 
 
 
 
cyclosporine  A  active  substance  intermediate, voclosporin synthesis, purification and storage, have 
been included in the active substance release specification. 
The proposed control strategy for each of them takes into consideration their origin and the material 
attributes and/process parameters that impact their presence. An evaluation of the potential genotoxic 
impurities has been provided, in line with ICH M7(R1) provisions, and demonstrates that all specified 
impurities are Class 4 or Class 5 compounds and designated as non-mutagenic, with the exception of 
some impurities classified as Class 2 (known mutagens with unknown carcinogenic potential) for which 
the applicant adequately justified that neither routine testing as part of active substance release, nor 
additional controls of the voclosporin manufacturing stages are necessary.  
Residual solvents are controlled in the release specifications with limits according to ICH Q3C guideline. 
All the solvents used in the synthesis of the starting materials are controlled in the specifications of the 
respective starting material.  
An elemental impurities risk assessment was conducted as per ICH Q3D(R1) using a risk-based 
approach to determine the risk for carryover of Class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities into the 
active substance. The outcome of the risk assessment supports that there is minimal risk for metal 
contamination that could originate from the active substance manufacturing process. Based upon the 
outcome of the risk assessment, it is concluded that neither routine testing as part of active substance 
release, nor additional controls of the voclosporin manufacturing stages are necessary to control any 
elemental impurity.  
A nitrosamines impurities risk assessment was conducted as per EMA/369136/2020 guideline and Q&A 
EMA/409815/2020, using a risk-based approach to determine the risk for carryover of nitrosamines 
impurities into the active substance. The outcome of the full risk assessment indicated that there was a 
moderate risk for nitrosamines contamination that could originate from the active substance 
manufacturing process, namely N-NitrosoDimethylAmine (NDMA) and N-NitrosoDiethylAmine (NDEA), 
and that confirmatory testing on several voclosporin batches was required. NDMA and NDEA were 
tested in 8 voclosporin production batches and were found below LOQ of 0.03 ppm (less than 10% of 
the acceptable limit of 0.6 ppm, based on a MDD of 47.4 mg voclosporin and an acceptable intake of 
26.5 ng/day of more potent NDEA, since more than one nitrosamine impurity is identified). The data 
provided support the conclusion that neither routine testing as part of active substance release, nor 
additional controls of the voclosporin manufacturing stages are necessary to control any nitrosamines 
impurity. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags which comply with 
the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The LDPE bags are placed in a thermally 
sealed Polyethylene Terephtalate (PET)/aluminium/polyethylene triplex bag containing one desiccant 
sachet. The aluminium triplex bag is then placed in a suitable polyethylene drum with a lid that is 
sealed with a tamper evident seal for shipment. 
2.3.2.3 Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance and colour (visual examination), 
identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF, Ph. 
Eur.), specific rotation (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition/sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.) and microbial count (Ph. 
Eur.). 
The proposed active substance specification includes relevant testing parameters. The specification was 
established taking into account applicable ICH and EU guidelines and compendial considerations, as 
well as manufacturing capability, batch analysis data and stability results. Impurities present at higher 
Assessment report

than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies 
and appropriate specifications have been set. During the assessment, the tightening of acceptance 
criteria for unspecified impurities and for individual impurities was requested and has been 
implemented by the applicant. The control strategy for residual solvents has been detailed in the 
characterisation of the active substance section and the applied limits are in line with ICH Q3C. 
Justification for not controlling elemental impurities and tetramethylammonium ion in the voclosporin 
batches has been provided by the applicant and it is acceptable. Criteria for trans-isomer are in line 
with the batch analysis. Because the active substance is completely solubilised in the medicinal product 
formulation, polymorphism and particle size distribution are not considered critical quality attributes for 
the active substance and, therefore, not included as part of the commercial release specification for 
voclosporin.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data are provided for 27 batches of voclosporin active substance and 4 historical 
batches (purification step performed by chromatography instead of crystallisation). All results are 
within the proposed specification limits.  
2.3.2.4. Stability 
Results of stability studies on 6 primary registration stability batches, manufactured at proposed scale 
and packed in the proposed primary packaging, were presented for up to 60 months at -20°C ± 5°C, 
5°C ± 3°C and 25°C/60% relative humidity (RH), and up to 6 months at 40°C/75% RH, according to 
the ICH guidelines. Batches packed in the less protective packaging are tested up to 60 months at -
20°C ± 5°C and 25°C/60% RH, and up to 9 months at 40°C/75% RH, and are considered as 
supportive stability batches. Parameters tested during stability study are appearance, identity by HPLC 
and XRD, assay, impurities, water content and microbial purity. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. 
At 25°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH, significant assay decrease with out-of-specification (OOS) results 
at later testing points is observed. At -20°C ± 5°C and 5°C ± 3°C, the results are within proposed 
limits. This is considered acceptable.  
There was no trend observed for specified impurities at any of the storage conditions. At -20°C ± 5°C 
and 5°C ± 3°C, total impurities are below 1.0%, while significant increase is seen at 25°C/60% RH (up 
to 2.5%), without an observed increase of specified and unspecified related impurities. This was due to 
the increase of impurities, which were not detected by the related substances method. Therefore, a 
new method has been developed, suitable for determination of impurities. The stability results indicate 
that no unspecified and no individual impurities are above identification threshold of 0.10% during the 
proposed retest period at proposed long-term storage condition. All other testing parameters were 
within the specification limits at all storage conditions. 
Based on this, the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is deemed sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months in the proposed container. 
Adequate post-approval stability protocol information is presented and acceptable handling of any 
confirmed OOS is proposed.

2.3.3. Finished medicinal product 
2.3.3.1. Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product consists of a non-aqueous solution of voclosporin active substance, containing 7.9 
mg of voclosporin per unit, filled into a size 5 (13 mm × 6 mm) opaque pink-orange to orange soft 
gelatin capsule. The composition of voclosporin soft capsule is adequately presented in the dossier.  
Due to the low aqueous solubility of voclosporin, the objective during formulation development was to 
produce a non-aqueous formulation for oral administration which would form a relatively stable 
oil/water emulsion upon introduction into physiologically relevant aqueous media. Since drug 
permeation is associated with particle surface area, it was considered desirable to develop a 
formulation which would form a microemulsion when dissolved in aqueous media. Therefore, soft 
gelatin capsules were chosen as pharmaceutical form. Since the active substance is dissolved in the 
capsule fill, the physico-chemical characteristics of voclosporin (e.g., polymorphism and particle size) 
are not relevant for the quality of the finished product. 
The selected excipients used for the finished product are sufficiently justified by the applicant. All 
excipients are commonly used for oral pharmaceutical dosage forms and their quality is compliant with 
the Ph. Eur., with the exception of Opacode® White WB NSP-78-18022 (used as the ink for printing on 
the outside of the capsule shell) and the excipients used as processing aids for the capsule shell 
(lecithin, denatured ethanol and Phosal® 53 MCT), which are non-compendial excipients and controlled 
against internal specifications. This is considered acceptable.  
All excipients used in the production of the finished product are of non-human and non-animal origin, 
except for the gelatin used in production of the gelatin capsule shell of the finished product, derived 
from a bovine source and for which an appropriate TSE CEP has been provided. No novel excipients are 
used.  
Definition of a Quality Target Product Profile (QTTP), the associated CQAs and identification of CPPs in 
each step of the finished product manufacturing process are considered sufficiently described. The 
suggested control strategy covering the active substance specification tests, finished product CPPs and 
IPCs, as well as the finished product specification tests are considered acceptable. No design spaces 
are claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product. 
The compatibility of the active substance and formulation components is demonstrated by the finished 
product stability data. The formulation development, including optimisation of the product formulation, 
is described and studies confirming the robustness of the finished product are presented. No overage 
of voclosporin is added for the manufacture of the finished product. 
It is to be noted that initial development includes 5 mg and 10 mg voclosporin softgel capsule 
strengths that were used in clinical studies investigating other autoimmune indications (renal 
transplantation, plaque psoriasis, and non-infectious uveitis) before lupus nephritis (LN) clinical 
development. For the LN indication, a 7.9 mg voclosporin softgel capsule was developed based upon 
the historical efficacy and safety data of voclosporin obtained from clinical studies in other autoimmune 
indications. The qualitative composition of the fill formulation is identical for the 5 mg, 7.9 mg and 10 
mg strengths, with minor differences in the quantitative composition to hold total fill volume fixed, as 
well as in qualitative composition of the capsule shell. The pivotal clinical efficacy studies for the LN 
indication were performed using the final intended commercial formulation. 
The main physicochemical properties relevant for the finished product performance as identified and 
evaluated, are robust with regard to minor formulation changes. Further, a preliminary evaluation of 
the dissolution of the unencapsulated development formulations screened suggests that the dissolution 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 16/17 
 
 
 
is rapid (<15 minutes), by visual evaluation. These data suggest that dissolution rate is mainly 
controlled by rupture time of the capsule shell. 
The development of the dissolution method used for QC control is described and the discriminatory 
power of the method is sufficiently demonstrated. The choice of surfactant and the rotation speed have 
been adequately justified by the applicant. Dissolution profiles for pivotal batches and commercial 
finished product are presented and it is concluded the profiles can be considered similar. The 
dissolution method development studies were performed with the proposed commercial finished 
product formulation, as well as the previous 5 mg and 10 mg strengths of voclosporin softgel capsules, 
and are considered representative for the purposes of dissolution method development.  
Studies confirming the comparability of pilot scale pivotal clinical and registration batches versus 
commercial scale are presented. 
The primary packaging of the finished product is cold-formed aluminium blisters, laminated backing 
and lidding materials that are thermo-sealed together. The primary packaging material complies with 
Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. Each blister contains 18 soft capsules and ten such blister cards are 
packaged into a carton (non-functional secondary packaging) to achieve a sufficient quantity of 
capsules to meet a month’s supply of the finished product. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.3.3.2. Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The voclosporin finished product is manufactured, filled, packaged, inspected and tested in accordance 
with GMP. 
The manufacturing process consists of 7 main steps:  
Stage 1: Preparation of formulation fill material 
Stage 2: Gel mass preparation/conversion 
Stage 3: Encapsulation, capsule printing, and drying 
Stage 4: Drying 
Stage 5: Washing, sorting, and metal check 
Stage 6: Inspection and bulk packaging 
Stage 7: Packaging 
The flow diagram for the manufacture of the finished product is provided in the dossier. There are no 
intermediates for the manufacture of voclosporin softgel capsules. The commercial batch size and 
corresponding formula for voclosporin softgel capsules is adequately described in the dossier. 
A risk assessment was performed that has identified the CPPs for the manufacture of the voclosporin 
softgel capsules. In addition, an integrated control strategy for the manufacture of the finished product 
was developed that takes into account the manufacturing process history to date and the risk 
assessment performed for the finished product manufacturing process. The integrated control strategy 
ensures that each finished product CQA is appropriately controlled.  
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. The finished product manufacturing 
process has also been validated by three consecutive batches. Based on extensive knowledge, 
experience of manufacturing of this kind of pharmaceutical form (soft gelatin capsules), presented 
batch analysis data and adequacy of in-process controls and extensive pharmaceutical development 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 17/18 
 
 
 
studies, it is considered that the manufacture is sufficiently robust to provide assurance that the 
process produces the finished product of consistent quality, complying with the designated 
specification.  
2.3.3.3. Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual inspection), identification (HPLC-UV), assay (HPLC-UV), degradation products 
(HPLC-UV, UPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC-UV/Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC-UV/Ph. Eur.), 
ethanol content (GC-FID), water content (Karl Fischer/Ph. Eur) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification tests are in line with ICHQ6A and Ph. Eur. requirements. The parameters 
included in the finished product specification are found adequate to control the quality of the finished 
product at release and shelf-life. The acceptance criteria were selected on the basis of the available 
manufacturing and testing experience, manufacturing process capabilities, regulatory guidance, 
scientific knowledge, and the stability characteristics. During the assessment, inclusion of limits for 
some impurities (individual and total) and tightening of acceptance criteria for other impurities, ethanol 
content and assay (for shelf-life specification only) were requested and have been implemented by the 
applicant. Moreover, the applicant commits to further adjust the shelf-life assay specification when 
more data is available. 
Appropriate rationale for not including in the finished product specification acceptance criteria for other 
tests has been provided by the applicant and is considered acceptable.  
In accordance with ICH Q3B(R2), only degradation products are controlled in voclosporin softgel 
capsules. Impurities that are synthetic process-related impurities are controlled in the active substance 
and are not further controlled in the finished product. This approach is endorsed. 
Residual solvents used as part of the voclosporin active substance manufacturing process are 
controlled as per the active substance specification. For the finished product, an evaluation of residual 
solvents in the finished product was performed, confirm that the finished product complies with the 
requirements of ICH Q3C(R7) and that there is no need to control residual solvents also in the finished 
product. This is considered acceptable. Of note, for the finished product ethanol is employed as an 
excipient that is used as a solubilizing agent for the active substance. Therefore, ethanol is treated as 
an excipient and testing for ethanol is performed as part of the finished product specification. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. 
The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. The voclosporin primary reference standard used for finished 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 18/19 
 
 
 
product testing is the same as the primary standard used to test the active substance and is 
considered acceptable. 
Batch analysis results are provided for one qualification batch, five clinical batches and three 
commercial full-scale batches, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability 
to manufacture to the intended product specification. he finished product is released on the market 
based on the above release specifications, through traditional final product release testing. 
2.3.3.4. Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been performed on several batches of the finished product, using a range of 
stability conditions (25°C/60%RH and 40°C/75%RH). The analytical methods and acceptance criteria 
applied during stability studies are identical to the finished product release specifications, except for 
assay testing, for which slightly broader limits are set.  
Stability data are available for all three primary registration batches through 36 months and 6 months 
of storage at 25°C/60%RH and 40°C/75%RH, respectively. For both storage conditions, no significant 
changes were observed in any of the monitored parameters throughout the entire testing period, 
compared to the initial values.  
Supportive stability data are also available for two clinical batches of finished product through 48 
months and 60 months of storage at 25°C/60%RH, respectively. No changes were observed in any of 
the monitored parameters compared to the initial values.  
All stability indicating parameters remain within the proposed commercial specifications when stored at 
the long-term storage condition (25°C/60%RH) through 24 to 60 months or at the accelerated storage 
condition (40°C/75%RH) through 6 months for each primary and supportive registration stability batch 
of voclosporin softgel capsules. 
Photostability study results demonstrated that voclosporin softgel capsule is stable following exposure 
to the conditions defined in ICH Q1B, Option 2. All finished product quality attributes remained within 
the specifications after light exposure and all degradation products were found at or near the limit of 
quantification for both the light exposed samples in an open dish, light exposed in the blister and dark 
control samples. Based on these results, no special storage statement is required to be added to the 
labelling for voclosporin softgel capsules. 
For the temperature cycling study, no significant change was observed in any of the following test 
attributes evaluated: appearance, assay, uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, moisture content, 
ethanol content (whole capsule), degradation products and microbial limits. The results demonstrate 
that voclosporin softgel capsules are chemically and physically stable when exposed to extremes in 
temperature for several days through three cycles. Therefore, no precautionary statement to avoid 
freezing is required to be added to the labelling for voclosporin softgel capsules. 
Force degradation stability studies have been performed to demonstrate stability indicating of the 
analytical methods. The results presented demonstrated that the methods are stability indicating 
methods. 
The applicant commits to continue the ongoing primary registration stability study through at least the 
end of the proposed finished product shelf-life according to the stability protocols. Adequate post-
approval stability protocol information is presented and acceptable handling of any confirmed out-of-
specification (OOS) is proposed. Furthermore, as part of the post-approval stability commitment, one 
finished product batch per year will be subjected to stability testing and evaluation for continuous 
stability monitoring. 
Assessment report

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months for the finished product stored 
under the following storage conditions: “Store in the original package, in order to protect from 
moisture.”, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3), are acceptable. 
2.3.3.5 Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
2.3.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
finished product. 
2.3.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.3.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
N/A 
2.4 Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1 2.4.Introduction 
Voclosporin consists of 2 geometric isomers; a trans-isomer and a cis-isomer, depending on the 
orientation of the modified functional group at amino acid-1. The drug substance/formulation used in 
early nonclinical and clinical studies was an approximately equal mixture of both isomers (45-50% 
trans-, 50-55% cis-). This formulation is referred to throughout the dossier as mix-ISA247 and 
ISATX247 in the study reports. From 1999 to 2002, the pharmacodynamics of mix-ISA247 was studied 
in vitro and in vivo. A decision was made in 2003 to develop a new formulation, enriched with the 
trans-isomer (90 to 95% trans-isomer) which is current formulation referred to as voclosporin. 
Voclosporin is structurally similar to cyclosporine A except for a modification of a functional group on 
amino acid-1 of the molecule and is claimed to reversibly inhibit immunocompetent lymphocytes, 
particularly T lymphocytes, in the G0 or G1 phase of the cell cycle and reversibly inhibit the production 
and release of lymphokines and to mediate its immunosuppressive effects by binding to the 
intracellular protein, cyclophilin.

The recommended dose of Lupkynis is 23.7 mg (three 7.9 mg soft capsules), twice daily. Each soft 
capsule contains 21.6 mg ethanol and 28.7 mg sorbitol. Formulation excipients also include vitamin E 
polyethylene glycol succinate (also known as Tocofersolan), polysorbate 40, and medium chain 
triglycerides. The vehicle used in most of the nonclinical studies performed is stated to be the same as 
that utilised for human administration. The oral route of administration was used, as this is the 
proposed route for administration in humans. 
2.4.2. Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1. Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacological activity of voclosporin has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo using 
calcineurin inhibition and lymphocyte proliferation as markers of pharmacological effect and using 
different animal models for autoimmune uveitis, arthritis and organ transplants.  
In in vitro studies in human whole blood voclosporin, in the form of trans-ISA247 (containing 18% cis- 
and 82% trans-isomer), was shown to inhibit calcineurin activity with an IC50 of 0.46 µM and to be 1.5 
times more potent than cyclosporine A (CsA). In another study Mix-ISA247 (containing 45-50% trans- 
and 50-55% cis isomers) was shown to be 1.8 and 1.2 more potent than CsA, in two different 
laboratories, using a simple E-max model. Using a human lymphocyte proliferation assay it was shown 
that the IC50 for voclosporin was 15.8±10.2 ng/ml and that all major metabolites investigated (IM9, 
IM4, IM4n, IM1c and IM1-Diol-1) had IC50 values that were at least 9-fold higher than voclosporin. 
In vivo, voclosporin gave a dose-related increase in calcineurin inhibition in whole blood in monkeys 
with an indicated direct relationship between PD effect and drug concentration. A length of time with 
>50% inhibition of calcineurin of 6 to 9 hours was said to indicate significant immunosuppression in 
high dosed animals (75 and 150 mg/kg/day). When T Cell Function was studied in monkeys, mix-
ISA247 demonstrated a greater overall PD effect compared to CsA, both in vitro and in vivo, even 
though drug concentrations for mix-ISA247 were lower in vivo at the doses used (mix-ISA247 25 and 
50 mg/kg, and CsA 25 mg/kg).  
In an animal model for Uveitis the therapeutic efficacy of voclosporin appeared to be similar to 
cyclosporine. In this study the in vitro voclosporin induced inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes 
from rodents and humans, and Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokine levels in human lymphocytes were also 
studied and indicate that voclosporin efficacy may be mediated through the inhibition of T-cell effector 
responses. 
Mix-ISA247 were also shown to have greater potency than CsA in the treatment of established 
collagen-induced arthritis in mice and in treatment of established antigen-induced arthritis in rabbits 
based on dose comparisons (exposure levels were not analysed). 
After allotransplantation of pancreatic isle cells ISATX247 (containing 45-50% trans- and 50-55% cis 
isomers) enhanced graft survival and seemed to be more potent at delaying the onset of diabetes as 
compared with the same dose (20 mg/kg) of cyclosporine A. Mix-ISA247 also showed enhanced 
potency with respect to overall survival in comparison with CsA at a dose of 1.75 mg/kg/day (ip 0.875 
mg/kg BID) in a rat heterotopic heart transplant model. In a similar study in this model survival times 
for ISA247-(mix), trans-ISA247, and CsA at the same dose (1.75 mg/kg/day) were all significantly 
greater than the survival time for control animals, with mix-ISA247 and voclosporin prolonging graft 
survival in all animals during the treatment period as compared to 83% survival in CsA and 33% 
survival in cis-ISA247 treated animals.

Survival of cynomolgus monkeys with heterotopic renal allografts were also shown to be higher in 
monkeys treated with ISATX247 as compared to CsA at equal exposure levels suggesting a more 
potent immunosuppressive effect of ISATX247. 
2.4.2.2. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In monkeys with kidney transplants mix-ISA247 (50 mg/kg) seemed to have lesser effects on kidney 
mitochondrial dysfunction than CsA (25 mg/kg) when activation of cytosolic glycolysis and glucose 
utilisation were analysed using MRS (magnetic resonance spectrometry). Less cellular oedema and 
papillar necrosis was also present after treatment with mix-ISA247 as compared to CsA treatment and 
less renal lipid peroxidation was also indicated after treatment with mix-ISA247. 
No adverse renal effects were observed in rabbits following 7 days of intravenous administration 
followed by 23 days of subcutaneous administration of mix-ISA247 at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day. The 
2 animals treated with 25 mg/kg/day died at 5 and 7 days, respectively, with metabolic effects 
preceding the death, but without adverse renal effects.  
In dogs with islet cell autografts, mix-ISA247 (20 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) was not toxic to islet cells, 
while CsA (20 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) showed an adverse effect on islet cell function. However, the 
average through concentration was ~3 times higher for CsA. 
In conclusion, except for the “metabonomics” data obtained in monkeys using MRS, indicating a lower 
potency for mix-ISA247 to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in the kidney than CsA, no clear difference 
between mix-ISA247 and CsA regarding effects on kidneys and islet cells were obtained. No effects 
were seen on kidneys at the CsA dose level used in rabbits, and the CsA exposures levels obtained in 
dogs where 3 times higher as compared to that obtained for mix-ISA247. No other potential secondary 
pharmacological effects have been analysed or discussed by the applicant. This is considered 
acceptable, considering the similarity of the toxicological profile of voclosporin and CsA and the only 
1.5-fold increase in potency towards calcineurin, as well as the presence of clinical data. 
In rabbits, a reduction in spermatogenesis was detected, which was concluded to be drug related in 
one study (ISA99-02) and possibly drug related in another study (ISA00-21). The applicant was asked 
to discuss this point during the evaluation and agrees that voclosporin, like CsA, can reduce the 
prostate and testicular weights in the rat.  
2.4.2.3. Safety pharmacology programme 
In vitro studies on CHO cells expressing recombinant hERG channels and in rabbit Purkinje fibres 
indicate that mix-ISA247, cis-ISA247 and voclosporin block repolarizing currents through hERG 
channels in vitro at twenty percent inhibitory concentration (IC20) values of approximately 6 to 18 μM 
(7300 -21900 ng/mL). These concentrations are well in excess of estimated therapeutic whole blood 
concentrations of Cmax bound 120 ng/mL with a free fraction of 3.6 ng/mL. In the rabbit Purkinje fiber 
assay, mix-ISA247 was not associated with the induction of arrhythmias at the concentration range 
tested (nominally 0.01-10 μM), while slowing of cardiac action potential depolarisation indicated that 
ISA-247 may produce ventricular conduction abnormalities in vivo (QRS-prolongation) at free 
myocardial concentrations above ~3 μM (3660 ng/mL). 
In two in vivo studies in conscious monkeys, mix-ISA247, cis-ISA247 and voclosporin lengthened QT 
intervals and corrected QT intervals (QTc) at a dose level of 200 mg/kg and were considered to have 
an effect on ventricular repolarisation. In these studies, no effects on heart rate were observed and the 
electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms showed no effect on RR, PR or QRS complex duration. A Cmax of 
~600 ng/mL was seen after a dose of 200 mg/kg (as compared to a clinical Cmax of 120 ng/mL).  
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 22/23 
 
 
 
Safety pharmacology studies were also conducted in rats to assess the potential respiratory, CNS, and 
renal effects of voclosporin. At a dose of 25 mg/kg, the highest dose tested, voclosporin was 
associated with a slight decrease in respiration rate, without an increase in tidal volume, at 120 
minutes after dose administration. Voclosporin did not cause any neuropharmacological or toxicological 
signs at doses up to 25 mg/kg except for a 0.5ºC decrease in body temperature (a decrease of body 
temperature ≤0.5 ˚C was also seen in one of the studies in monkeys at 200 mg/kg). In the renal 
safety study, the only effect of voclosporin was a marginal decrease in urine volume at a dose of 25 
mg/kg, the highest dose tested. Based on AUC from a 13-week rat toxicology study (ISA03-03) the 
estimated exposure margin relative to clinical exposure is approximately 24 times at a dose of 25 
mg/kg. 
2.4.2.4. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
2.4.3 Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Oral bioavailability of voclosporin ranged from 7.6% to 7.8% for male and female Sprague-Dawley rats 
with a higher exposure seen in male rats as compared with female. There was no evidence of 
accumulation. Upon repeat dosing the rate and extent of absorption of mix-ISA247 decreased over 
time. Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) values were typically between 1 and 4 hours and were 
consistent among the species evaluated. In general, voclosporin was eliminated at a moderate to rapid 
rate (t1/2 3-8 hours) in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys. Data suggest that the trans-isomer is more 
bioavailable than the cis-isomer. Systemic exposure seemed to be higher for CsA than for mix-ISA247. 
The trans-isomer of voclosporin has been shown not to convert to the cis-isomer in whole blood in vivo 
and the conversion of cis-ISA247 to trans-ISA247 (or vice versa) do not occur in vitro either in human 
whole blood or denatured human whole blood. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding ranged between 96.97% (human) to 98.34% (rat) in all species investigated 
(mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and human). High distribution to red blood cells showed that whole 
blood is the most appropriate biological matrix for quantifying voclosporin. 
Following a single oral administration of voclosporin to Sprague-Dawley rats (4.1-4.3 mg/kg 14C-
Voclosporin (42.6 μCi/mg)) drug related material was rapidly distributed into essentially all major 
organs/tissues analysed. Tissue concentrations of radioactivity were generally higher in males than in 
females and radioactivity in the tissues also appeared to decline more rapidly in females than in males. 
The highest concentrations of radioactivity were generally associated with the gastrointestinal tract, 
liver and kidney. However, concentrations were also relatively high in the pancreas, thyroid, spleen, 
adrenals and mesenteric lymph node in both males and females. Tissue concentrations in the brain and 
spinal cord were low in both sexes. The concentrations of radioactivity were notably higher in the 
female sexual organs than in male sexual organs. Similar results were obtained after administration of 
a single oral dose of [3H]-mix-ISA247 (25 mg/kg, 45-63 μCi/animal). Tissue radioactivity 
concentrations in male rats generally declined after reaching peak levels, such that at 72 hours post-
dose (the final sampling time) more than half of the tissues/organs in male rats and almost all of the 
tissues/organs in female rats, were below the limit of quantification and only the exorbital and intra-
orbital lacrimal glands in male rats contained greater than 0.1 μg equivalents/g.  
There were no significant differences in the [14C]-voclosporin distribution profile of Lister Hooded 
(pigmented) rats versus the Sprague-Dawley (non-pigmented) rats (for the selected organs 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 23/24 
 
 
 
evaluated), or between pigmented and non-pigmented skin in Lister Hooded rats, suggesting negligible 
binding of voclosporin to melanin. 
Tissue distribution of radioactivity, following oral administration of [14C]-voclosporin (40 mg/kg, 260 
μCi/kg) to cynomolgus monkeys, was similar to the pattern observed in rats. Once absorbed, drug-
derived radioactivity was rapidly and widely distributed to all tissues and organs analysed. The highest 
concentrations of drug-derived radioactivity were associated with the walls of the GI tract, bile (gall 
bladder contents), liver, aorta (female only), lymph nodes (mesenteric) and kidney. Radioactivity 
concentrations were low in the tissues of the central nervous system. Exposure to both parent drug 
and radioactivity appeared to be comparable between the two sexes with time of maximum 
concentration (Tmax) at around 2-3 h post-dose. At 168 h post-dose (one female only), tissue : whole-
blood ratios generally declined or remained at a similar level to those at 2 h post-dose. Exceptions to 
this were pigmented skin, non-pigmented skin and mammary glands, where notable increases (20 – 
47-fold) in the ratio were observed. This was concluded to likely reflect the lipophilic nature of 
voclosporin and/or its metabolites. 
Distribution in pregnant animals was similar to that in non-pregnant animals. Radiolabelled material 
was observed in foetal tissues after administration of [14C]-Voclosporin to pregnant rats, suggesting 
that dose-related material had crossed the placental barrier, although distribution was slow and limited 
and the levels in foetal carcasses were low (0.019% of the dose administered to the dam was observed 
in foetal tissues at 8 hours (Tmax) post-dose). 
Metabolism 
Voclosporin is extensively metabolised by hydroxylation and oxidative N-demethylation reactions in all 
species, including humans. CYP3A4/5 is the primary CYP450 enzyme involved in the Phase 1 
metabolism of voclosporin. The proposed metabolic scheme consists of a CYP450-catalyzed oxidation 
of amino acids, other than amino acid-1, to yield the metabolites IM9, IM4 and IM4n, or a CYP450-
catalyzed oxidation of amino acid-1 to generate the metabolites IM1-Diol-1, IM1c (R), and IM1w. Other 
metabolites are observed in vivo but at levels too low to quantitate. In addition, IM1-Diol-2 and IM1-
Diol-3 are only formed from cis-ISA247 (of which voclosporin contains ≤10%), while the trans-isomer 
preferentially forms IM1-Diol-1. The major metabolite in all species is IM9 with a relative % 
distribution of 16.7%, based on total radioactivity in 0-24h human pooled blood samples. 
Metabolism of voclosporin is similar across species with no unique human metabolite. 
IM1-Diol-1 is close to be classified as a major human metabolite that would need to be characterised in 
nonclinical studies in accordance with the ICH M3 guideline. The relative distribution for IM1-Diol-1 is 
reported to be 9.47±1.66% of total radioactivity, as compared to the classification limit stated in the 
M3 Guideline; “greater than 10% of the measured total exposure to drug and metabolites”. It is of 
interest that a proposed possible pathway for the formation of IM1-diol-1 as well as IM1w and IM1A 
includes an initial oxidation of the terminal double bound in amino acid 1 and the formation of an 
epoxide intermediate. This suggests a possible formation of reactive intermediates during the 
formation of M1-diol-1. However, the absence of detectable levels of GSH adducts in incubations with 
human liver microsomes in combination with the absence of time dependent inhibition of cytochrome 
P450 enzymes suggest that no, or very low levels of reactive intermediates are formed during 
voclosporin metabolism, including the formation of IM1-diol-1. 
No additional nonclinical characterisation of IM1-diol-1 is considered needed based on the absence of 
detectable levels of reactive intermediates and the average relative distribution being below 10%. 
Excretion 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 24/25 
 
 
 
The major route of excretion in rats, monkeys and humans following oral administration is faecal 
(~96%, ~79% and ~93%, respectively) with only minimal urinary secretion.  
A rapid and substantial distribution to milk is seen in lactating rats after oral administration of 
voclosporin. 
PK interactions  
PK interactions were investigated in vivo in rats in a steroid interaction study with voclosporin and 
prednisone and a interaction study with voclosporin, CsA, or tacrolimus (Tac) co-administered with 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Voclosporin exposure was generally higher when administered alone 
compared to administration with prednisone. There was no evidence of accumulation of voclosporin 
when administered alone or with prednisone. In male rats, following dosing of voclosporin (25 
mg/kg/day) and prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/day) a sign of a possible accumulation of 
prednisone/prednisolone was detected. In other groups, administration of voclosporin up to 10 
mg/kg/day did not seem to affect exposure to prednisone/prednisolone. Daily oral administration of 
voclosporin for 7 days and co-administration of a single dose of mycophenolate mofetil on Day 7 had 
no effect on MPA plasma concentrations, but MPAG plasma concentrations were increased relative to 
control. This was in contrast to CsA which reduced MPA plasma concentrations and increased MPAG 
plasma concentrations. 
2.4.4. Toxicology 
The applicant has developed voclosporin, a calcineurin inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients 
with lupus nephritis (LN). The structure is similar to cyclosporine A (CsA), except for a modification to 
the amino acid-1 region which was introduced to give an alteration of the metabolic profile and 
improved potency compared to CsA. The recommended oral dose is 23.7 mg twice daily (BID).  
Voclosporin consists of 2 geometric isomers, a trans-isomer and a cis-isomer, and most studies in the 
programme have evaluated a mixture of the two isomers (mix-ISA247; 45-50% trans-, 50-55% cis-), 
whereas a few newer studies have evaluated the clinical product. A bridging programme with the two 
formulations has been performed which consisted of a 13-week oral voclosporin study in rats, an EFD 
study in rabbits and an Ames’ test. In several studies, CsA has been included as a “positive control” to 
enable comparison regarding toxicological profile and potency. 
A full programme of studies has characterised the toxicity of voclosporin, and the pivotal studies were 
performed in accordance with GLP regulations. Repeated-dose toxicity studies were performed in rat 
(up to 26weeks), mice (up to 13 weeks), dog (up to 13 weeks) and monkey (up to 39-weeks). Further, 
genotoxicity studies, carcinogenicity studies (rat and mouse), EFD-studies (including a 10-week 
juvenile toxicity study) and local tolerance studies were included in the study programme. The primary 
species used for multiple-dose toxicity studies were Sprague-Dawley rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, 
why focus was put on the pivotal studies in these species in this assessment report. A limited number 
of studies have also been performed in CD-1 mice and Beagle dogs of which limited studies were 
included. The dog studies were limited by frequent emesis findings resulting in variable TK data, why 
the use of dog was discontinued in the development programme.  Except for emesis in dogs, no 
changes occurred in mice or dogs that were not also seen in rats or monkeys. While the applicant has 
not provided with a clear justification for the species used in the toxicology programme, rat, rabbit and 
monkey are considered appropriate main species for the studies based on pharmacodynamics and 
metabolic profile.  
The vehicle used in all oral toxicology studies was Vitamin E TPGS (D-alpha-tocopheryl-polyethylene 
glycol 1000 succinate)/medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil/Tween 40/95% ethanol (4:2:2:1, 
w/w/w/w). From a toxicological perspective this vehicle was suboptimal as it generated toxicities which 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 25/26 
 
 
 
may have masked voclosporin-induced effects. These toxicitites include GI-effects in all species tested 
and effects on haematology parameters, coagulation and organ weights (also in 13-week study) in the 
39-week study in monkey.  In addition, in the carcinogenicity study in mouse, increased mortalities 
were noted in the vehicle group, whereas an increased incidence of cervical granular tumours were 
noted in the vehicle group compared to controls in the rat carcinogenicity study. Voclosporin and mix-
ISA247 are extensively metabolised by hydroxylation and oxidative N-demethylation reactions. The 
major metabolite in all species including human is IM9. Metabolism of voclosporin is similar across 
species, with no unique human metabolites, and no separate toxicity studies have been performed for 
the metabolites. 
The toxicity profile of voclosporin is mostly reflective of the calcineurin inhibitory action of the 
substance, and the profile is very similar to CsA.  
2.4.4.1. Single dose toxicity 
Two non-GLP single-dose TK studies have been performed, one in SD rat and one MTD study in Beagle 
dog which used repeated single doses. No deaths or apparent toxicities were noted in the rat. In the 
dog, vomiting and/or regurgitation was the only toxicity reported. 
2.4.4.2.Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies have been performed in rat and cynomolgus monkey using oral (gavage) 
administration. As most studies were performed using mix-ISA247, a bridging programme was 
performed with voclosporin which included a 13-week study in the rat. The overall impression is that 
mix-ISA247 and voclosporin have overlapping toxicological profiles. Further, 13-week studies in the rat 
were performed to evaluate whether vitamin E in the formulation may mask voclosporin-induced liver 
toxicity. Based on the study results presented, it was concluded that the toxicological profile of 
voclosporin was similar regardless of if the formulation contained vitamin E or not.  A 13-week 
combination toxicity study with voclosporin and prednisone to determine the toxicological interaction 
and toxicokinetic profile of the test articles did not identify new toxicities in the combination groups 
compared to the separate voclosporin and prednisone groups. In the combination toxicity study, the 
lowest effective dose of prednisone was used for rats (0.5 mg/kg) without titration of the corticosteroid 
dose throughout the study, while the voclosporin dose was changed from 0 to 25 mg/kg. It is unclear if 
there would be any toxicities from the combination if prednisone was used in higher effective doses, 
but since one of the clinical goals is to lower corticosteroid usage in patients, this is considered to be of 
minor concern and was not further pursued by the CHMP. 
Treatment related mortalities were identified in the repeated-dose toxicity studies. In the 13-week 
study in rats, two recovery animals’ demise (10 and 25mg/kg/day) are considered related to 
treatment. This is based on clinical signs which correlated with neuropathological findings of multifocal 
vascular/perivascular infiltrate (associated with gliosis and vacuolation) in the brain and spinal cord.  
In the rat 26-week study, the 7 deaths in the cyclosporin group (compared to 2 in the control) were 
according to the study report treatment related. However, the 4 deaths in the Mix-ISA247 group (4/66 
animals) were not considered biologically different from that of the control group. The basis for this 
position is unclear as no cause of death was identified for most of the animals, and the overall findings 
in the study suggest that the substances are very similar from a toxicological perspective. However, 
this issue was note further pursued by the CHMP. 
In the 39-week study in Cynomolgus monkey, three deaths occurred during the study, of which one 
was in the control group. A vehicle-treated male died of pneumonia, which is of unclear treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 26/27 
 
 
 
relation. One female administered 150 mg/kg/day died on SD 132 from lymphosarcoma. This death is 
considered treatment-related as 5 animals (4 females, 1male) in the high-dose group were diagnosed 
with the disease at necropsy (see subsection on lymphosarcoma below). 
Clinical signs and body weights 
GI effects (soft/loose feces, diarrhea and dark feces) were evident in all species tested (including the 
rabbit EFD-study) and increased with dose in several studies. In the dog, diarrhea and emesis was 
noted in 14-day and 13-week studies (despite attempts to use enterically coated capsules). This 
limited the usefulness of the species for longer studies as the emesis resulted in highly variable 
pharmacokinetics. In studies with recovery groups, the GI effects recovered. Bodyweights correlated 
with the GI effects from 10mg/kg/day in the rat but recovered or showed signs of recovery. In 
monkey, no effects on body weight were noted.  
Gingival hyperplasia 
In the 13-week study in cynomolgus monkey, macroscopic findings of gingival epithelial hyperplasia (3 
vehicle monkeys+3 at 75 mg/kg/day) were seen which correlated with inflammation. In the 39-week 
study clinical signs of increased swelling of the gums were evident from 75mg/kg/day with a clear 
dose-relationship. This correlated macroscopically with gingival thickening and microscopically with 
lymphocytic infiltration into tissues and increased rete peg development. Gingival hyperplasias were 
also seen in the dog but not in the rat.  
Cataracts 
Cataracts noted at ophthalmoscopy which correlated with lenticular degeneration microscopically was 
evident in rat studies from 28-days duration at dose levels at and above 2.5mg/kg/day mostly in 
males (perhaps related to higher exposures in males). The findings generally increased at recovery. No 
cataracts were noted in mouse dog, rabbit or monkey suggesting a species-specificity. Cataracts are 
known effects of CsA in the rat, and studies have suggested increased rates of steroid-induced 
cataracts with the use of cyclosporin. However, in a 13-week combination toxicity study with 
voclosporin and prednisone, no increased cataracts were noted in the combination groups compared to 
voclosporin alone. 
Renal toxicity 
In rat, the kidney was a sensitive target of toxicity with effects noted already from 28 days of exposure 
and included increased BUN and increased urinary glucose and specific gravity which correlated with 
macro and microscopic findings. In the 28-day study, increased kidney weights from 24.2 mg/kg/day 
correlated with microscopic findings of renal corticomedullary mineralisation and trace to minimal 
bilateral renal tubular basophilia in mid- and high-dose males. In the 13-week study, renal 
corticomedullary mineralisation was evident in the kidney from 10mg/kg/day including increased 
incidence of bilateral renal tubular basophilia. In the 26-week study, minimal to mild microscopic 
findings of degeneration/regeneration of cortical tubules were evident which showed dose-relation. 
These findings persisted through recovery. In cynomolgus monkey, increased kidney weights from 
25mg/kg/day did not correlate with macro- or microscopic findings.  
Neurological findings 
Major neurohistological effects of CsA, cis-ISA247, voclosporin and mix-ISA247 were noted in the rat 
in studies from 13-weeks duration. In the 26-week study, histopathological findings were observed in 
the central and peripheral nervous systems after CsA and mix-ISA 247 exposure. In the spinal cord, 
the cervical, thoracic and lumbar segments showed subacute inflammation and/or nerve fiber 
degeneration and gliosis with various incidences from 1.25mg/kg/day. Further, in the brain of males at 
10mg/kg/day from both substance groups, multifocal subacute perivascular inflammation characterised 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 27/28 
 
 
 
by accumulation of mononuclear cells, gliosis, nerve fiber degeneration was noted. Findings in the 
cranial and sciatic nerves were observed in high-dose males (mix-ISA247 or CsA) which included nerve 
fiber degeneration and/or lymphocytic infiltration and/or gliosis. The findings in the CNS and PNS 
remained through recovery. Interestingly, despite these clear toxicities to the nervous system, no 
treatment-related effects were evident in the performed FOB evaluation. The underlying reason for this 
is unclear but may reflect that areas of the brain important for the execution of these tests (e.g. 
striatum, hippocampus) were not affected. No recovery was seen, and similar neurotoxic effects were 
noted also in the 13-week study 
Lymphoid tissues 
In the 13-week study in mouse, reduced absolute lymphocyte counts in the mid- and high-dose groups 
correlated with depletion of lymphoid cells and hypocellularity in the thymus and lymph nodes. This is 
likely related to the immunosuppressant effects of the substance. Lymphopenia and reduction of 
lymphoid cells were identified in the thymus and lymph nodes. 
In the rat 13- and 26-week studies treatment with mix-ISA247 and CsA was associated with medullary 
atrophy in the thymus and cortical lymphocytolysis. The effects remained after recovery. Absence of 
germinal centres in the spleen was noted more frequently in animals at 10 and 25 mg/kg/day and in 
the mandibular lymph node at 25mg/kg/day. Collectively, these findings are considered exaggerated 
pharmacology effects and related to the immunosuppressant effect of the substances. 
Liver 
The liver was not a major target organ of toxicity, but increased expression of liver enzymes (AST, 
ALT, ALP) were noted in rats treated with mix-ISA247 and CsA in the rat 26-week study, suggestive of 
liver engagement. 
Haematology and clinical chemistry 
Across all species, treatment with mix-ISA247 and CsA resulted in reduced lymphocyte counts. A 
reduction of Mg is noted for both sexes from 10mg/kg/day in the 13-week and 26-week studies in rat. 
According to the applicant, this reflects a class effect of calcineurin inhibitor drugs noted in animals and 
humans, thought to be drug-induced intracellular redistribution of Mg within renal tubular epithelium. 
However, the exact mechanism is uncertain, but serum Mg levels rapidly return to normal after the 
cessation of drug treatment. 
Reproductive organs 
In the 13- and 26-week repeated-dose toxicity studies in rat and in the 13-week study in monkey, 
prostate and testes (only rat) weights were reduced without microscopic correlation. 
Lymphosarcomas 
Macro- and microscopic examination of monkeys in the 39-week study revealed lymphosarcomas in 5 
high-dose (150/300 mg/kg/day) animals (one of which died on SD132) which were very extensive and 
invasive in 2 animals. Lymphosarcomas were also identified in the rat carcinogenicity studies (see 
below). According to the applicant, other compounds of this class have been associated with 
lymphosarcomas, and they can be related to excessive immunosuppression. Indeed, at the high dose, 
calcineurin inhibition was substantial, and studies referenced by the applicant have shown increased 
development of lymphosarcomas in non-human primates treated with immunosuppressive drugs.

2.4.4.3. Genotoxicity 
A full programme of genotoxicity studies has been performed. Voclosporin was not mutagenic in a 
bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) or in a vitro chromosomal aberration assay using CHO cells. 
An isomer mix (Mix-ISA247), used in early development, showed no genotoxic potential in an in vivo 
micronucleus assay with bone marrow smears. Voclosporin was not tested in an in vivo assay.  This is 
acceptable since the dosing with Mix-ISA247 most likely resulted in sufficient exposure of the trans-
isomer.  In summary, the genotoxicity studies presented do not indicate a genotoxic risk for 
voclosporin. 
2.4.4.4. Carcinogenicity 
Two long term studies with voclosporin were performed in mice and rats. Planned to be 2-year studies, 
both had to be early terminated due to decreased survival. In both studies, two separate control 
groups (vehicle and saline) were used and there was vehicle-related toxicity and vehicle-related effects 
on the survival of mice and rats. 
Main findings were malignant lymphomas in mice. Moreover, there were increases in benign granular 
cell cervix and vaginal granular cell tumours in female rats given vehicle or voclosporin.  
Mouse 89-week carcinogenicity study 
The applicant conducted an 89-week carcinogenicity study in mice. The study was planned to last 104-
weeks (2 years) but was terminated early due to decreased survival and poor condition of the mice in 
the low- and high-dose. The exposure levels in the mid-dose group, which can be considered the 
NOAEL for neoplastic findings, were comparable to clinical exposure.  
The vehicle was not well-tolerated over time and vehicle-related effects on overall survival and 
histopathology as described below were observed. All groups had 50% or higher survival through study 
week 48. Survival at termination of each group was in the saline control, vehicle control, 3, 10 and 30 
mg/kg/day groups 51%, 31%, 23%, 31% and 23%, respectively, for males and 63%, 40%, 37%, 
34% and 31%, respectively for females.  
There were increases in malignant lymphomas in high-dose males (at 9 times human exposure) and 
females (at 7,5 times human exposure) compared to vehicle or saline groups. Voclosporin has 
immunosuppressive effects and an increased risk for neoplastic lesions would therefore be expected.  
There was also a statistically significant increase in mid-dose females when comparing combined 
bronchiolar-alveolar adenoma and carcinoma with the vehicle group. This finding is considered 
incidental with limited clinical relevance. 
Rat 96-week carcinogenicity study 
The 2-year rat study had to be terminated early (at week 96) due to decreased survival of vehicle 
control group animals. At termination, survival in the saline control, vehicle control, 0,05, 0,25 and 
1,25 mg/kg/day group males was 40%, 31%, 29%, 33% and 25%, respectively, and in the saline 
control, vehicle control, 0,1, 0,5 and 2,5 mg/kg/day group females was 35%, 32%, 46%, 32% and 
46%, respectively. All groups had 50% or higher survival through study week 79 which is considered 
low. A NOEL was not determined due to mortality. At all dose-levels, the exposure levels in the rats 
were below human exposure. 
Pancreatic islet tumours (adenoma and carcinoma combined) were increased in the high-dose males 
compared to vehicle control group, but not compared to the saline control group.

There was an increase in granular cell tumours in the female reproductive tract (benign granular cell 
cervix and vaginal granular cell tumours) compared to saline control group but not when compared to 
vehicle control group.  
The benign granular cell tumours of the cervix were statistically significantly increased in the mid-
dosed females when compared to the saline control group, but not the vehicle control group. When 
benign granular cell tumours of the cervix were combined with benign granular cell tumour of the 
vagina, statistical significance was also reached for the high-dose females when compared to the saline 
control group, but not the vehicle control group. 
2.4.4.5. Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
A full programme of reproductive and developmental studies has been performed with voclosporin, 
which included FEED, EFD PPND and juvenile toxicity studies in SD rat as well as EFD studies in NZW 
rabbit. In all studies, mix-ISA247 administration was used. Further, an EFD bridging study was 
performed in NZW rabbit using voclosporin administration. 
FEED 
In males the incidence of swollen snout, localised alopecia of the limbs, swollen forepaw digits and 
urine-stained abdominal fur showed a clearly increased incidence in the 25mg/kg/day dose-group. 
Further, body weight and food consumption were reduced in males at 25mg/kg/day. This difference in 
clinical signs between the sexes can be explained by the roughly double exposure (AUC) noted in 
males compared to females. Interestingly, body weights were increased in males at 2.5 and 
10mg/kg/day which correlated with increased food consumption at 10mg/kg/day. The underlying 
reason for this effect is unclear, and since no data have been made available on water consumption, a 
relation is not possible to clarify. This issue was not further pursued. 
Reproductive organ weights (left cauda epididymis, left and right epididymis, seminal vesicles with and 
without fluid prostate) and testes (abs.) weights were reduced or significantly reduced at 
25mg/kg/day. However, no microscopic correlation was noted, and sperm motility, count and density 
were unaffected. Nor did the changes in reproductive organ weights translate into reduced fertility in 
the males of this study. However, it is noted that in the 13- and 26-week repeated-dose toxicity 
studies in rat and in the 13-week study in monkey, prostate and testes (only rat) weights were 
reduced, also without microscopic correlation. Further, according to the pharmacology study report ISA 
99-02 decreased spermatogenesis in all male rabbits treated with mix-ISA247 at 15 mg/kg/day was 
treatment related (similar findings were also noted in study ISA00-21 but reported to need additional 
analysis). Caesarean section parameters and litter data were unaffected by treatment. Collectively, 
considering the effects in reproductive organs in males, a paternal NOAEL is considered to be 10 
mg/kg/day, whereas the maternal and reproductive NOAELS were 25mg/kg/day, the highest doses 
tested. 
EFD studies 
Based on the dose-range finding studies in rat and rabbit, it was concluded that mix-ISA247 has a 
reproductive toxicity potential. A dose of 20mg/kg/day was identified as high dose for the pivotal 
studies in both rat and rabbit. The voclosporin DRF-study in NZW rats showed similar toxicities as 
previously noted in rabbits administered mix-ISA247. Based on effects on fetal and maternal body 
weights from 40mgkg/day and effects on implantation also from 40mg/kg/day, 20mg/kg/day was 
considered a reasonable maximum dose for the pivotal study. 
Rat

In the pivotal rat EFD study, dam mortalities were evident in the study and the clinical signs included 
increased incidences of scant feces, excess salivation, urine-stained abdominal fur and alopecia from 
2,5mg/kg/day. Further, at 25mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested) a red perioral substance of unclear 
composition was noted. At 25mg/kg/day, maternal body weights and body weight gains were reduced 
which correlated with a significantly reduced food consumption from GD15. Also at this dose, the total 
number of resorptions, the percent dead or resorbed conceptuses per litter and early and late 
resorptions were significantly increased, which led to a reduced gravid uterus weight and mean litter 
size and also a reduced number of live fetuses. 
With the exception of a reduced number of ossified metatarsals, which are likely reversible 
manifestations of the reduced body weight, no treatment-related malformations or variations were 
reported. Given the major developmental effects evident at 25mg/kg/day, this is surprising. 
Collectively, the maternal and fetal toxicities were considered adverse were seen in the 25mg/kg/day 
dose-group why maternal and fetal NOAELs are considered to be 10mg/kg/day, corresponding to a 
margin to clinical exposure of 7.2. 
Rabbit 
In the rabbit EFD-study with mix-ISA247, 4 does were found dead or were sacrificed. Of these, one 
doe at 10mg/kg/day was terminated on GD21 after abortion and two does at 20mg/kg/day were 
terminated on GD21 and 24 respectively after abortions. These abortions are considered related to 
mix-ISA247-treatment. 
Clinical signs included ungroomed coat and liquid feces from 2mg/kg/day. Bodyweight and bodyweight 
gain was increased at 20mg/kg/day, but after correction for gravid uterine weight (reduced at 10 and 
20mg/kg/day), dam body weights were significantly increased from 10mg/kg/day. At 20 mg/kg/day, 
increased resorptions were evident (early and late resorptions) and the litter size and the number of 
live fetuses was decreased suggestive of developmental toxicity. Further, fetal weights were 
significantly reduced from 10mg/kg/day. However, no increase in external, visceral or skeletal 
malformations were noted. From 10mg/kg/day, reduced metacarpal ossification was reported, which is 
considered a developmental delay of minor toxicological importance. Since treatment-related deaths 
were noted from 10mg/kg/day along with effects on body weight development, a maternal NOAEL of 
2mg/kg/day is set. The developmental NOAEL is set at 2mg/kg/day based on the reduced fetal 
weights. At this dose, all TK values were BLQ why there are no margins to clinical exposure. Of note, 
the MoE to the dose associated with increased early and late resorptions is only 1.9. 
In the EFD-study with voclosporin, 3 dams were found dead or euthanised in the study, none of which 
was considered treatment-related. Clinical signs included increased incidences of soft stool and brown 
material on various body surfaces noted in all treated groups including vehicle group. Similar findings 
but at lesser incidence was noted in control group. According to the applicant, the vehicle (a lipophilic 
carrier) is causing the toxicity which was increased at voclosporin exposure at 20mg/kg/day. It is in 
this respect noted that GI problems with the vehicle have been evident throughout the study 
programme. Body weight was significantly increased at 20mg/kg/day (up to 10%) whereas food 
consumption was decreased. As the gravid uterus weight was also reduced in this dose-group, dam 
body-weight increase was likely even larger. 
Fetal weights were decreased from 5mg/kg/day, which also correlated with skeletal variations 
(increased incidences of unossified sternebrae no 5 and 6 from 5mg/kg/day and unossified hyoid body 
and/or arches only at 20mg/kg/day). No other malformations or variations considered treatment-
related were noted. According to the applicant, the maternal and fetal NOAELs should be 1mg/kg/day 
based on swollen mammary glands and effects on fetal body weight at 5mg/kg/day. This was agreed 
by the CHMP.

PPND 
A pre and postnatal development study has been performed in SD rats administered mix-ISA247 at 
doses up to 25mg/kg/day. No mortalities in F0 dams were considered treatment-related, and clinical 
signs included findings of red and/or brown substance in the vaginal and/or perivaginal areas, pale 
mucous membranes, soft or liquid feces, dehydration and emaciation. Gestational body weight losses 
were evident from 10mg/kg/day, whereas lactational body weights did not differ among groups. 
Further, feed consumption values were significantly reduced during gestation in the 25 mg/kg/day 
dosage group whereas no effects were evident during lactation. 12 dams at 25mg/kg/day were 
euthanised between GD27-31 due to failures to complete parturition (dystocia). Among these dams, 
clinical signs of ataxia, impaired righting reflex and decreased motor activity were noted. As a result of 
the dystocia, the mean number of total pups delivered, surviving pups per litter and the number of 
liveborn pups was significantly reduced in the 25 mg/kg/day dosage group. At ≥10 mg/kg/day the 
number of fetuses with umbilical hernias was increased, suggestive of reproductive toxicity. 
No effects on body weights or sexual maturation were seen in the F1-generation. However, no data on 
pup physical and functional development (e.g. eye opening, incisor eruption, pinna unfolding) were 
identified. While these data should be available, the lack of effect on other developmental parameters 
(e.g. body weight development, sexual maturation) suggest that treatment related effects are not 
considered likely. Further, no differences were found in the values for learning, short-term retention, 
or response inhibition. Finally, no effects on mating or fertility parameters, including gross alterations 
of the F2 generation were evident. Therefore, the maternal and fetal NOAELs are considered to be 2.5 
mg/kg/day, as the 25 mg/kg/day administration caused dystocia in dams and reduced fetal weights in 
the F1 offspring. Further, at 10mg/kg/day, umbilical hernias were noted, as well as adverse reduced 
maternal body weight gain. 
Based on a placental transfer and milk transfer study in SD rat, drug-derived radioactivity was 
observed in milk by 1 hour post-dose and increased with a Tmax (blood and milk) at 4 hours post-
dose. At Tmax, the milk/blood concentration ratio was nearly 1. Radioactivity in the stomach contents 
of the pups indicated lactational transfer (0.7% of the dose 23h post-dose) of voclosporin from the 
mother to the pup. Low levels of radioactivity were observed in pup carcasses indicating that drug 
material had been absorbed.  
Juvenile toxicity 
A juvenile toxicity study was performed in SD rat with voclosporin exposure from PND28-PND101. In a 
previous satellite study (not made available by the applicant), mortalities were evident around PND 7-
14 which according to the applicant were presumably related to adverse interactions with the milk and 
the vehicle/voclosporin. Therefore, this study was initiated post weaning. As previous rat studies in the 
programme have shown increased exposures in males compared to females, a maximal dose of 5 
mg/kg/day was given to males, whereas 10 mg/kg/day was the high dose in females. 
Two unscheduled deaths were apparent in the study, but they were not considered to be related to 
voclosporin treatment.  
No clinical signs or body weight effects with relation to treatment were identified. However, males in 
the vehicle group showed significantly increased body weights (up to 8%) across the study duration, 
which correlated with a decreased mean number of rears, and an increased mean score for urination in 
the open field compared to the control group. Further vehicle-related findings included presence of 
blood in the urine and increased urine specific gravity. Presence of blood in urine was also seen in this 
group during recovery along with increased levels of ketone bodies. Given the mortalities noted in the 
satellite study and the clear vehicle induced effects noted here (and elsewhere in the study 
programme) it is clear that the vehicle used is suboptimal.  
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 32/33 
 
 
 
Voclosporin-induced changes were identified in kidneys of female rats where voclosporin administration 
at 10 mg/kg/day resulted in an increased incidence of mineral deposition at the corticomedullary 
junction. This finding remained after recovery. In males from 2.5mg/kg/day and females from 
5mg/kg/day, thymus changes were recognised as cortical vacuolation associated with tangible body 
macrophage accumulation. This finding remained in one female after recovery. Nervous system 
findings of mild vacuolation of the neuropil in the brain (1 female), and mild, multifocal lymphocytic 
infiltration of the sciatic nerve (1 female) noted after the dosage period were not evident after 
recovery. Finally, findings in male recovery animals associated with chronic progressive nephropathy 
were identified in 1, 2, 1, 1 and 3 males at control, vehicle, 1.25, 2.5 and 5mg/kg/day respectively. To 
conclude, no toxicities considered new for the juvenile patient population were identified in this study. 
However, findings considered adverse were identified in the kidney and the thymus from 
2.5mg/kg/day. 
2.4.4.6. Local Tolerance  
A dermal irritation study in NZW rabbit does not support that voclosporin has corrosive or irritating 
potential. An eye irritation study in rats was performed where 3 NZW rabbits were instilled with 
voclosporin (100mg neat powder/eye) in the right eye (left eye was control). Following observation of 
the eyes at several time-points up to 72 hours post-dose, it was concluded that voclosporin is 
considered a slight ocular irritant. Given that the clinical route of administration is oral, the significance 
of the finding for the clinical situation is considered minor and this issue was not further pursued. 
2.4.4.7. Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
A delayed dermal contact hypersensitivity study in Guinea pig demonstrated that, under the conditions 
of the study, voclosporin did not elicit a delayed contact hypersensitivity response in induced guinea 
pigs when challenged with topically applied voclosporin. Accordingly, voclosporin is not considered a 
sensitiser. 
Impurities and reagents 
No dedicated studies on impurities were performed. A number of voclosporin-related impurities were 
evaluated for genotoxic structural alerts using the Leadscope Model Applier, a quantitative structure-
activity relationship (QSAR) software program which includes both expert rule- and statistical-based 
models. No structural alerts were identified, why the impurities can be classified as ICH M7 class 5 
compounds and thus treated as non-mutagens. 
The applicant has also provided with genotoxicity evaluations for eight voclosporin reagents using the 
Leadscope Model Applier. Further, a literature review was also conducted for each compound to 
identify available genotoxicity data to support the determination of genotoxicity classification. Two 
compounds were classified as ICH M7 Class 2 (known mutagens with unknown carcinogenic potential). 
The remaining six compounds were classified as Class 5 (i.e. non-mutagenic impurities) and should 
thus be reported and qualified according to the principles laid out in ICH Q3A/B. 
Specified impurities were present in toxicology batches in concentrations that allowed for qualification 
of impurities in nonclinical studies. Proposed acceptance criteria for specified impurities can be 
accepted. 
Phototoxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 33/34 
 
 
 
According to the applicant, voclosporin does not absorb light in the wavelength of 290-700nm, 
suggesting that the substance has no phototoxic potential. 
2.4.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA has been produced by the applicant. Log Pow was determined to 5.5 in a OECD 107 study, why 
a definitive PBT assessment was triggered. No study report for the OECD 107 study was provided. 
When asked to substantiate the log Kow  of 5.5 with the study report the applicant stated that the slow 
stirring method (OECD 123) was considered more appropriate and referred to the study submitted in 
the application. CHMP agreed that for compounds with log Kow > 4, the slow-stirring method should 
be used. Based on the OECD 123 study, the log Kow is considered to be 6.26. 
Regarding PBT assessment, the applicant submitted an OECD301F study with voclosporin which was 
performed in accordance with relevant guidelines. Based on the study, it can be concluded that 
voclosporin is readily biodegradable. According to the draft EMA “Guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1), when a non-
natural peptide/protein is demonstrated to be excreted in amounts < 10% of the dose, or shown to be 
readily biodegradable in an OECD 301 test, the ERA stops. Therefore, no further ERA data are 
considered needed for voclosporin and it can be concluded that voclosporin in the proposed use is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The pharmacological activity of voclosporin has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo using 
calcineurin inhibition and lymphocyte proliferation as markers of pharmacological effect and using 
different animal models for autoimmune uveitis, arthritis and organ transplants.  
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 34/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Voclosporin is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant that inhibits calcineurin in a dose-dependent 
manner up to a maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Activation of lymphocytes involves an increase in 
intracellular calcium concentrations. Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase whose 
activity is required for the induction of T-cell lymphokine production and proliferation. The 
immunosuppressant activity results in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell cytokine production, 
and expression of T-cell activation surface antigens. 
In vitro studies showed that voclosporin was 1.5 times more potent than cyclosporine A (CsA) and to 
inhibit calcineurin activity with an IC50 of 0.46 µM. In general, voclosporin was also more potent in 
vivo as compared to CsA. Results from studies using a human lymphocyte proliferation assay indicated 
that the metabolites of voclosporin studied (including the major circulating metabolites IM9 and IM1-
Diol-1) were at least 9-fold less potent than voclosporin. Only three studies were performed on 
secondary pharmacodynamics. This is considered acceptable, considering the similarity of the 
toxicological profile of voclosporin and CsA, the only 1.5-fold increase in potency towards calcineurin, 
as well as the presence of clinical data. 
Safety pharmacology studies suggested only minor respiratory, CNS, and renal effects at an estimated 
maximum single dose exposure approximately 24-fold higher than that observed in clinical studies and 
are thus not considered of relevance for the clinical situation. Prolongation of QT interval and corrected 
QT interval were seen in monkeys at exposures ~5 times the estimated clinical exposure level without 
any significant in vitro effects on hERG detected. No additional studies are required considering that 
two clinical thorough QT-studies have been performed (see clinical part).  
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey, with a focus on 
rat and monkey. Oral bioavailability of voclosporin was ~8% in rat with a higher exposure seen in male 
rats as compared with female. There was no evidence of accumulation. Data suggest that the trans-
isomer is more bioavailable than the cis isomer. No conversion between the isomers were detected 
either in vitro or in vivo. Protein binding was high (97-98%) in all species investigated. 14C-
voclosporin drug related material was rapidly distributed into essentially all major organs/tissues 
analysed with tissue concentrations in the brain and spinal cord being low. No significant differences in 
the distribution profile between pigmented and non-pigmented rats were seen, suggesting negligible 
binding of voclosporin to melanin. Distribution across the placental barrier was detected. 
Metabolism of voclosporin is similar across species with no unique human metabolite. One major 
metabolite, IM9, with a relative distribution of 16.4% of total exposure was identified in human blood. 
A second metabolite, IM1-Diol-1, proposed to possibly be formed via an epoxide intermediate, was 
close to be classified as a major human metabolite having a relative distribution of 9.47±1.66% of 
total radioactivity. No additional nonclinical characterisation of IM1-diol-1 is considered needed, based 
on the absence of detectable levels of reactive intermediates and the average relative distribution 
being below 10% of total exposure in humans. The major route of excretion was faecal in all species 
investigated with only minimal urinary secretion. A rapid and substantial distribution to milk was seen 
in lactating rats after oral administration of voclosporin (see below). The pharmacokinetic 
characterisation of voclosporin is considered sufficient and no additional studies are required. The 
pharmacokinetic data obtained support the use of rodents and monkey as the primary toxicological 
species. 
Toxicology 
A full programme of toxicology studies has characterised the toxicity of voclosporin, and the pivotal 
studies were performed in accordance with GLP regulations. The toxicology profile of voclosporin is 
mostly reflective of the calcineurin inhibitory action of the substance, and the profile is very similar to 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 35/36 
 
 
 
CsA. Therefore, several findings can be considered related to the class of calcineurin inhibitors. The 
vehicle used in all oral toxicology studies was Vitamin E TPGS (D-alpha-tocopheryl-polyethylene glycol 
1000 succinate)/medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil/Tween 40/95% ethanol (4:2:2:1, w/w/w/w). 
From a toxicological perspective this vehicle was suboptimal as it generated toxicities which may have 
masked voclosporin-induced effects. These toxicities include gastro-intestinal (GI)-effects in all species 
tested and effects on haematology parameters, coagulation and organ weights in the 39-week study in 
monkey. In addition, in the carcinogenicity study in mouse, increased mortalities were noted in the 
vehicle group, whereas an increased incidence of cervical granular tumours were noted in the vehicle 
group compared to controls in the rat carcinogenicity study. Therefore, the applicant was asked to 
discuss the toxicities found with the vehicle throughout the non-clinical development and correlate the 
findings with possible clinical implications. In the response, the applicant acknowledged that the 
vehicle is partly responsible for GI toxicities found in nonclinical and clinical studies. It is agreed that 
the GI effects are most probably caused by partly vehicle and partly active substance, even though the 
pharmacological effect of active substance is not completely understood. From a clinical perspective, 
gastrointestinal disorders were the second-most frequent adverse events by System Organ Class and 
are included in SmPC. The applicant argues that other nonclinical vehicle toxicity findings are not 
consistent or clear enough to point out the vehicle used as responsible for effects seen. This is agreed 
and taking into consideration the multiples to clinical exposure presented (26 – 258) and lack of clinical 
implications of vehicle toxicity. This issue was not further pursued by the CHMP.  
No metabolite studies have been performed by the applicant. During the assessment, the applicant 
was asked to discuss whether IM1-Diol-1 should be considered a major metabolite. The low exposure 
levels obtained with this metabolite in the toxicological species used in studies on genotoxicity, 
carcinogenesis and embryo-foetal development should especially be considered. It should be noted 
that in accordance with guidelines it would be sufficient to show that animal exposure is at least 50% 
of the exposure seen in humans in one species used. In the response, the applicant presented clinical 
PK data and considerations regarding borderline results from the mass balance study. Additionally, in 
the response to clinical PK question on major metabolite, the applicant presented metabolite-to-parent 
ratios based on AUC0-12 at steady-state across different doses used in 4 studies. The CHMP concluded 
that it can be agreed that steady-state M-P data do not suggest that IM1-Diol-1 should be considered a 
major metabolite and no further evaluation of protein binding or DDI potential is requested from a 
clinical PK point of view. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that no discussion of the toxicological 
characterisation of this metabolite was required. 
Gingival hyperplasias were seen in the dog but not in the rat. This is a well-known clinical problem 
associated with exposure to immunosuppressant drugs and is a common ADR noted in the Lupkynis 
clinical trials. It has been included in SmPC section 4.8. 
Major neurohistological effects of CsA, cis-ISA247, voclosporin and mix-ISA247 were noted in PNS and 
CNS in rat studies from 13-weeks duration. The findings included multifocal subacute perivascular 
inflammation characterised by accumulation of mononuclear cells, gliosis and nerve fiber degeneration 
and remained through recovery. Despite these clear toxicities to the nervous system, no treatment-
related effects were evident in the performed FOB evaluation. The underlying reason for this is unclear 
but may reflect that areas of the brain important for the execution of these tests (e.g. striatum, 
hippocampus) were not affected. Neurotoxicity is a clinically recognised AE of voclosporin (and CsA) 
and are included in sections 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC. Still, given that no recovery was seen, and 
similar neurotoxic effects were noted also in the 13-week study, the applicant was asked to reflect on 
the clinical relevance of these findings and include them in section 5.3 of the SmPC. Of note, the lack 
of similar effects in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs and monkeys suggest that there could be 
species differences.  
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 36/37 
 
 
 
No mechanistic explanation was proposed by the applicant to explain the increased neurotoxicity noted 
in the rat compared to dog or monkey, but it was noted that the effects are dose-dependent and occur 
in the rat at voclosporin concentrations (based on AUC) which were also reached in the monkey. This 
suggests an increased susceptibility to the neurotoxicity in the rat compared to monkey. However, the 
lack of dramatic neurotoxicities in the clinical studies performed with voclosporin thus far indicates that 
the findings noted in the rat may not reflect clinically relevant effects. 
Lymphosarcomas were identified in the repeated-dose toxicity studies in monkey and in the 
carcinogenicity study in rat. In the 39-week study in cynomolgus monkey, lymphosarcomas were 
identified in five animals in the high-dose group (150/300 mg/kg/day). One of these animals died on 
SD132 and the findings were regarded as very extensive and invasive in two animals. According to the 
applicant, other compounds of this class have been associated with lymphosarcomas, and they can be 
related to excessive immunosuppression. Indeed, calcineurin inhibition was substantial in high-dose 
group animals, and studies referenced by the applicant have shown increased development of 
lymphosarcomas in non-human primates treated with immunosuppressive drugs. It was therefore 
considered likely that the lymphosarcomas were related to the extensive immunosuppression. 
Lymphosarcomas are described in the key safety findings from non-clinical studies in the RMP, and in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
A full programme of genotoxicity studies has been performed, which did not indicate a genotoxic risk 
for voclosporin. This is adequately described in the Section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Malignant lymphomas were observed in the carcinogenicity study in mice. Lymphomas are not 
uncommon findings with immunosuppressive drugs and lymphosarcomas were also observed in the 
39-week monkey study. Given the immunomodulatory effects of calcineurin inhibition, the lymphoma 
findings are most likely linked to voclosporin-induced immunosuppression.  The non-clinical lymphoma 
findings are adequately listed in the SmPC and the increased risk for malignancies, including 
lymphomas, are listed as an important potential risk in the risk management plan. 
The applicant considers that the high mortality rate observed in vehicle control and treatment groups, 
when compared to saline controls, in the mouse carcinogenicity study is due to procedure and gavage 
errors and not vehicle or treatment related (see also issue discussed above). Although findings in the 
oesophagus (perforation, inflammation) and swollen necks could indicate that more mice in the vehicle 
or treatment groups showed increased frequencies of gavage-related deaths, gavage and procedure-
related deaths are not considered to be able to fully account for the increased mortality seen with the 
vehicle.  At the CHMP’s request, the applicant has presented an explanation of the terms “gavage 
error” and “local procedure related injury”. Moreover, the applicant argues that if total local procedural 
and gavage error are subtracted, there is no consistent difference in mortality. While this seems to be 
the case, the applicant agrees that it is not clear why there was an increase in vehicle-related 
occurrence of gavage-related injuries, although several hypothetical arguments are made. Based on 
the applicant’s response, the CHMP considered that it is not meaningful to further pursue this issue. 
In the rat carcinogenicity study, pancreatic islet tumours (adenoma and carcinoma combined) were 
increased in the high-dose males compared to vehicle control group, but not compared to the saline 
control group.  The applicant considers these findings to be incidental due to the lack of a dose-related 
trend and the sex differences which is acknowledged. Although lack of dose-response is not a sufficient 
argument by itself, the incidence of pancreatic islets cell tumours were within the range of the 
historical controls and there was not a clear difference to both control groups. The clinical relevance of 
the pancreatic tumours is therefore considered uncertain and not likely toxicologically significant. 
There was an increase in granular cell tumours in the female reproductive tract (benign cervix and 
vaginal granular cell tumours). The applicant considers the lack of dose-response at mid- and high-
dose animals supportive of that the findings are incidental. The absence of dose-response is not

considered a sufficient argument on its own to conclude that they are not related to treatment. 
Granular cell tumours are very uncommon and the historical control database of the CRO shows very 
low mean incidences of 0,09% (2/2341) and 0,13% (3/2344) in the cervix and vagina, respectively, 
while the present study showed incidences of saline control: 1,5% (1/65), vehicle control: 6,2% 
(4/65), low-dose voclosporin: 3,1% (2/65), mid-dose voclosporin 9,2% (6/65) and high-dose 
voclosporin 7,7% (5/65) for cervical granular tumours. A publication (Markovits JE and Sahota P.S. 
Granular Cell Lesions in the Distal Female Reproductive Tract of Aged Sprague-Dawley Rats. Vet Pathol 
37:439–448, 2000) indicates that granular cell lesions in aging female SD rats are in general more 
common and seen at similar rates as in the present study. The publication further adds uncertainty 
when it comes to clinical relevance of the findings. A sufficient programme of reproductive and 
developmental studies has been performed with voclosporin. In the FEED study in SD rat, reproductive 
organ weights (left cauda epididymis, left and right epididymis, seminal vesicles with and without fluid 
prostate) and testes (abs.) weights were reduced or significantly reduced at 25mg/kg/day. However, 
no microscopic correlation was noted, and sperm motility, count and density were unaffected. Nor did 
the changes in reproductive organ weights translate into reduced fertility in the males of this study. 
However, it is noted that in the 13- and 26-week repeated-dose toxicity studies in rat and in the 13-
week study in monkey, prostate and testes (only rat) weights were reduced, also without microscopic 
correlation. Further, according to the pharmacology study report ISA 99-02, decreased 
spermatogenesis in all male rabbits treated with mix-ISA247 at 15 mg/kg/day was treatment related 
(similar findings were also noted in study ISA00-21 but was reported to need additional analysis). At 
the CHMP’s request, the applicant agrees that repeated administration of voclosporin can result in a 
reduction in testicular and prostate weights from 10 mg/kg/day and decreases in cauda epididymal, 
epididymal, and seminal vesicle weights at 25 mg/kg/day. However, no histological findings or effects 
on sperm analysis parameters or fertility were noted. While the fertility parameter is considered an 
insensitive measure in the rat, it is curious that no sperm or histological effects were identified, not 
even in the 26-week study. No clear mechanisms for the reduced weights have been presented, and 
none were expected. Possible hypotheses by the applicant includes indirect disturbances of the HPG 
axis given that the prostate and seminal vesicles androgen dependent organs. Another possibility 
would that the reduced weights may be early indicators of atrophy reflecting a direct cytotoxic effect 
on prostatic glandular cells.  
Based on published data, CsA has been shown to target male reproductive organs in the rat and induce 
reduced reproductive organ weights, degeneration and atrophy of seminiferous tubules, and impaired 
spermatogenesis. CsA was active comparator in several non-clinical studies in the present application. 
In the 26-week study in rats, CsA and voclosporin at 10mg/kg/day significantly reduced mean absolute 
prostate weights and prostate/brain ratio without histopathological correlation. In the animals 
administered voclosporin, but not CsA, significantly reduced testis weights and testis/brain ratios were 
also evident but without histopathological correlation. According to the applicant, the lack of 
comparable microscopic findings in the animals administered voclosporin in the 26-week study to the 
published CsA effects makes it unclear if the effects are exerted through similar pathways. This line of 
reasoning is hard to follow. In the 26-week study, no correlation to histopathology was seen for CsA 
either, why we have currently no obvious reason to assume that the substances differ with regard to 
their effects on male reproductive organs in the rat.  
Regarding the effects in the non-GLP studies in rabbit, important aspects of the studies are missing 
(testes weight, gross pathology, histopathology, PK). Still, the study supports that voclosporin, like 
CsA, can induce reduced spermatogenesis and degenerative changes in the testis. That said, given the 
lack of GLP and other limitations with the studies the CHMP agreed that they need not be included in 
the SmPC. Regarding the reduced prostate and testis weights in the monkey 13-week study, the CHMP 
agreed that the mean weights in the vehicle group animals were also reduced further supporting that 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 38/39 
 
 
 
the vehicle is suboptimal (see also discussion above) and that these data do not need to be included in 
the SmPC. 
To conclude, the applicant agreed that voclosporin, like CsA, can reduce the prostate and testicular 
weights in the rat. The data has been included in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
In the EFD study in SD rat with mix-ISA247, maternal body weights and body weight gains were 
reduced at 25mg/kg/day which correlated with a significantly reduced food consumption from GD15. 
Also at this dose, the total number of resorptions, the percent dead or resorbed conceptuses per litter 
and early and late resorptions were significantly increased, which led to a reduced gravid uterus weight 
and mean litter size and also a reduced number of live fetuses. In the rabbit EFD study with mix-ISA 
247, increased resorptions were evident at 20mg/kg/day (early and late resorptions) and the litter size 
and the number of live fetuses was decreased suggestive of developmental toxicity. Further, fetal 
weights were significantly reduced from 10mg/kg/day. In the rabbit EFD study with voclosporin, fetal 
weights were decreased from 5mg/kg/day, which also correlated with skeletal variations (increased 
incidences of unossified sternebrae no 5 and 6 from 5mg/kg/day and unossified hyoid body and/or 
arches only at 20mg/kg/day). No other malformations or variations considered treatment-related were 
noted. It has to be emphasised that exposures in the EFD studies in rabbits were significantly below 
expected human exposure. 
A PPND study was performed in SD rat. Gestational body weight losses were identified from 
10mg/kg/day, whereas lactational body weights did not differ among groups. Further, feed 
consumption values were significantly reduced during gestation in the 25 mg/kg/day dosage group 
whereas no effects were evident during lactation. 12 dams at 25mg/kg/day were euthanised between 
GD27-31 due to failures to complete parturition (suggestive of dystocia). Among these dams, clinical 
signs of ataxia, impaired righting reflex and decreased motor activity were noted. As a result of the 
dystocia, the mean number of total pups delivered, surviving pups per litter and the number of 
liveborn pups was significantly reduced in the 25 mg/kg/day dosage group. At the CHMP’s request, the 
applicant included the findings including margins to clinical exposure in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Based on a placental transfer and milk transfer study in SD rat, drug-derived radioactivity was 
observed in milk by 1 hour post-dose and increased with a Tmax (blood and milk) at 4 hours post-
dose. At Tmax, the milk/blood concentration ratio was nearly 1. Radioactivity in the stomach contents 
of the pups indicated lactational transfer (0.7% of the dose 23h post-dose) of voclosporin from the 
mother to the pup. Low levels of radioactivity were observed in pup carcasses indicating that drug 
material had been absorbed. As the drug is present in animal milk, it is assumed that the drug will be 
present in human milk unless we have data indicating otherwise. Given the risk for adverse reactions 
related to the lupkynis pharmacology (e.g., increased risk for infection), breastfeeding is not 
recommended during treatment with Lupkynis. This is adequately reflected in Sections 4.6 and 5.3 of 
the SmPC. 
In the juvenile toxicity study, no toxicities considered new for the juvenile patient population were 
identified. However, findings considered adverse were identified in the kidney and the thymus from 
2.5mg/kg/day. 
According to the applicant, voclosporin does not absorb light in the wavelength of 290-700nm, but no 
study could be identified in the dossier (non-clinical or quality) as evidence for this statement. At the 
CHMP’s request, the applicant presented an absorbance spectrum substantiating that voclosporin does 
not absorb light in the wavelength of 290- 700nm. 
An ERA has been produced by the applicant. Log Pow was determined to 5.5 in a OECD 107 study, why 
a definitive PBT assessment was triggered. No study report for the OECD 107 study has been provided 
why the applicant was asked to submit the study.  When asked to substantiate the log Kow of 5.5 with 
Assessment report

Page 39/40 
 
 
 
the study report the applicant stated that the slow stirring method (OECD 123) was considered more 
appropriate and that the report can be found in Module 3.2.S.4.3. It is agreed that for compounds with 
log Kow > 4, the slow-stirring method should be used. The applicant re-submitted the OECD 123 study 
and based on the data the log Kow is considered to be 6.26.  
Regarding PBT assessment, the applicant submitted an OECD301F study with voclosporin which was 
performed in accordance with relevant guidelines. Based on the study, it can be concluded that 
voclosporin is readily biodegradable. According to the draft EMA “Guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1), when a non-
natural peptide/protein is demonstrated to be excreted in amounts < 10% of the dose, or shown to be 
readily biodegradable in an OECD 301 test, the ERA stops. Therefore, no further ERA data are 
considered needed for voclosporin and it can be concluded that voclosporin in the proposed use is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.4.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Voclosporin is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant that inhibits calcineurin in a dose-dependent 
manner up to a maximum dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Activation of lymphocytes involves an increase in 
intracellular calcium concentrations. Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase whose 
activity is required for the induction of T-cell lymphokine production and proliferation. The 
immunosuppressant activity results in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell cytokine production, 
and expression of T-cell activation surface antigens. Pharmacology studies showed that voclosporin 
inhibited calcineurin with a 1.5-fold higher potency compared to cyclosporine in vitro and also that 
voclosporin had a higher potency in vivo in animal models. Secondary pharmacodynamics has not been 
well characterised, but this is considered acceptable due to the similarity of the toxicological profile of 
voclosporin and CsA, the only 1.5-fold increase in potency towards calcineurin, as well as the presence 
of clinical data. Safety pharmacology studies showed prolongation of QT interval and corrected QT 
interval in monkeys at exposures ~5 times the estimated clinical exposure level (Cmax) without any 
significant effects in vitro on hERG detected. Only minor respiratory, CNS, and renal effects where 
seen, without relevance for the clinical situation. No additional pharmacological studies have therefore 
been requested by the CHMP. 
The pharmacokinetic characterisation of voclosporin is considered sufficient and no additional studies 
are required. No unique human metabolite has been identified. The pharmacokinetic data obtained 
support the use of rat and monkey as the primary toxicological species. 
The review of the non-clinical toxicology data for Lupkynis indicates no major issues for concern. The 
toxicity profile of voclosporin is mostly reflective of the calcineurin inhibitory action of the substance 
(neurotoxicity, lymphomas, reduction of the prostate and testicular weights in the rat). This 
information is adequately reflected in the SmPC and the RMP. Of note, the non-clinical toxicology 
profile is very similar to CsA in the comparative studies.  
As the drug is present in animal milk, it is assumed that the drug will be present in human milk unless 
we have data indicating otherwise. Given the risk for adverse reactions related to the lupkynis 
pharmacology (e.g., increased risk for infection), breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment 
with Lupkynis. This is adequately reflected in Sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Based on the provided ERA studies it can be concluded that voclosporin in the proposed use is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.5.2. Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1. Pharmacokinetics 
Voclosporin (LX211, ISA247) is a next generation calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) structurally similar to 
cyclosporine A (CsA) except for a modification to the amino acid-1 region. It is a new chemical entity 
and the pharmacokinetic studies should thus aim at describing the disposition and also to identify 
subgroups where an increased or decreased exposure can be expected based on the pharmacokinetic 
properties. Potential interactions based on the pharmacokinetic properties should also be evaluated in 
the clinical pharmacology development. 
Table 2 provides an overview of the Phase 1 studies in the voclosporin clinical pharmacology 
programme, which included 13 studies in healthy subjects (including a bridging study in healthy 
Japanese subjects, 5 DDI studies and 2 thorough QT studies), two special population studies, in 
hepatically impaired and renally impaired subjects (and their matched controls) and a DDI study in 
subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with or without LN. In addition, two Phase 2 studies 
(AURA-LV and AURION) and a Phase 3 study (AURORA 1) provided PK data for voclosporin.

The oral solution formulation (50 mg/mL) was used in the initial Phase 1 studies. It shares the same 
composition as the fill used in capsules used in later clinical studies and intended for market. In the 
drug product intended for commercialisation, the oral solution is filled in a size 5 oval softgel capsule 
containing 7.9 mg voclosporin. 
An in vitro package characterising in vitro metabolism, transporters, protein binding, blood to plasma 
partitioning as well as potential to inhibit or induce enzymes or transporters is also provided. 
The voclosporin structure contains 12 centres of chirality as well as one C=C double bond and exists 
predominantly (90 to 95%) as the E (trans) configuration. However, one early clinical study included a 
mixture of 45%-50% trans-isomer/50%-55% cis-isomer of voclosporin (mix-ISA27) as a bridge to 
earlier non-clinical data. 
The initial tolerability studies evaluated the PK of voclosporin after single doses of 0.25 to 4.5 mg/kg 
and after multiple doses of 0.25 to 1.5 mg/kg BID. The majority of clinical pharmacology studies (e.g., 
drug-drug interactions (DDI), effect of renal and hepatic impairment) were conducted using a 
voclosporin 0.4 mg/kg dose. The proposed dose for treatment of LN is 23.7 mg (three 7.9 mg 
capsules) BID, which corresponds to a dose of 0.37 mg/kg BID based on a body weight of 64 kg (the 
median body weight of subjects receiving active treatment in AURORA 1). Dose reduction is proposed 
in case of concomitant treatment with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and in patients with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment. Dose adjustment is also required based on 
reduction of eGFR during treatment with voclosporin. 
In all clinical studies, voclosporin is measured in whole blood instead of in plasma, which is also the 
common practice for cyclosporin A. 
Voclosporin has one major metabolite and several minor metabolites. The metabolites provide little or 
no contribution to the pharmacological effect of voclosporin. 
Methods 
Bioanalysis 
Voclosporin and several of its metabolites have been measured in whole blood and urine using 
validated HPLC/MS methods. In whole blood, isomer-specific as well as non-isomer-specific methods 
have been used. 
Non-compartment data analysis 
Standard non-compartmental analysis was performed in all studies where rich sampling was applied. 
Population PK analysis 
A population PK analysis was used to describe voclosporin PK collected in AURA-LV and AURORA 1 
studies. A two-compartmental population PK model with first order oral absorption and linear 
elimination was developed for voclosporin in LN patients. A covariate analysis was performed to 
evaluate the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on exposure. 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model-based analysis 
A PBPK model based on prior in vitro and in vivo information on the metabolism and PK of voclosporin 
was constructed with the aim of predicting whole blood concentration-time profiles of voclosporin 
following single and multiple dosing in healthy subjects, evaluating the relative contribution of CYP3A4 
and P-gp in the metabolism and transport of voclosporin, evaluating the likely impact of co-
administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on the PK of voclosporin, and evaluating the impact of 
co-administration of voclosporin on the PK of OATP1B1 substrate drugs.

Absorption  
Oral absorption of voclosporin is relatively rapid, achieving median peak whole blood concentrations at 
approximately 1.5 hours (range: 0.75 to 2 hours) under fasted conditions in subjects following 
voclosporin 23.7 mg BID (study AUR-VCS-2018-01). 
At steady state, the whole blood mean Cmax and pre-dose trough values for voclosporin were 120 
ng/mL (32% CV) and 15.0 ng/mL (49% CV), respectively. (study AUR-VCS-2018-01). 
Voclosporin is a low solubility drug substance. The solubility is not pH dependent. 
Voclosporin is a possible P-gp substrate. 
Absolute bioavailability studies have not been performed. In the mass balance study (Study LX211-05) 
in which healthy subjects ingested an oral dose of [14C]-voclosporin 71.6±0.4 mg, 5% of the dose was 
excreted unchanged in feces recovered over 168 hours, suggesting a high fraction absorbed. 
Bioequivalence 
During the clinical development of voclosporin, an oral solution as well as different softgel capsule dose 
strengths have been used.  
Study ISA04-01 was a Phase I, single centre, randomised, single-dose open-label, 4-way crossover 
study comparing liquid versus capsule formulations of orally administered voclosporin 100 mg in water 
or apple juice in 19 healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. Bioequivalence was demonstrated 
between a 100 mg dose administered as an oral solution (50 mg/mL) dissolved in apple juice or water 
and as 50 mg softgel capsules fille with the same 50 mg/mL oral solution. The drug product used in 
the pivotal LN clinical trials and to-be-marketed 7.9 mg softgel capsule as well as the 10 mg softgel 
capsule used in the clinical pharmacology studies have the same relative ratio of formulation fill 
components as the 50 mg softgel capsule, consisting of the 50 mg/mL solution filled into a smaller 
softgel capsule. Consequently, the 7.9 mg and 10 mg softgel capsules can also be considered to be 
bioequivalent to the oral solution when administered at the same dose. Tmax was comparable between 
oral solution and capsule when administered with water, with median (range) values of 1.26 (1.00-
2.00) hours and 1.50 (1.50-2.00) hours, after administration as oral solution and capsule, respectively. 
When administered with apple juice, Tmax was slightly delayed for the capsule 2.50 (1.50-4.00) hours 
compared to the oral solution 1.50 (1.00-2.50) hours. 
Influence of food 
Study ISA04-02 was a Phase I, single centre, randomised, single-dose, open-label, 3-way crossover 
food interaction study to assess the effects of fasting, consumption of a high-fat breakfast, and 
consumption of a low-fat breakfast on the PK of voclosporin in 18 normal, healthy volunteers. The 
administration of a single 1.5 mg/kg voclosporin dose with either low- or high-fat meals decreased 
both the rate and extent of absorption, which appeared to be related to the fat content of the meal. 
With a high fat meal, Cmax and AUC were reduced by 53% and 25%, respectively. The effect of a low-
fat breakfast appeared to be less; Cmax and AUC were decreased by approximately 29% and 15% 
respectively after a low-fat breakfast. Median Tmax (range) was observed at 2.00 (1.00-2.50), 1.52 
(1.00-3.00) and 2.07 (1.00-4.15) hours after administration under fasting conditions, after a low-fat 
breakfast and after a high-fat breakfast, respectively. 
Distribution 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis (Population PK Report 19 041) using a two compartment model 
resulted in a total apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) of 2,154 L.

Plasma protein binding in human plasma was investigated in vitro using equilibrium dialysis. 
Voclosporin was found to be highly bound to plasma proteins (97%), ie with a fraction unbound of 3%. 
There was no indication of concentration dependency in the studied concentration range. For the major 
metabolite M4 (IM9) the protein binding was lower than for parent drug and appeared to be dependent 
on concentration (at a nominal concentration of 0.1 μM (the concentration most clinically relevant) the 
protein binding was 72.4%). 
Concentration measurement for voclosporin has been made in whole blood in the clinical studies, 
similar to the case of cyclosporin. Blood/plasma ratio was measured in vitro and depended on 
temperature and concentration but a mean value of 1.6 has been reported. In the mass balance study 
(Study LX211-05), mean Cmax and AUC for [14C]-voclosporin in blood were approximately 3-fold higher 
than in plasma, indicating that voclosporin and/or its metabolites may be associated with red blood 
cells. 
Elimination 
Voclosporin whole blood concentrations demonstrated biphasic elimination after oral dosing. With 
sufficiently large doses and extended sampling time, a third compartment could be determined. Mean 
t1/2 estimates after multiple dosing ranged from 24.9 to 36.5 hours, independent of dose, with a mean 
half-life at steady state of approximately 30 hours. After a single dose, the reported t1/2 values 
appeared to be variable and ranged from 6.9 to 58.2 hours. The estimate of terminal t1/2 is dependent 
on the sampling duration and assay limit of quantification used in the study. The clinical mass balance 
Study LX211-05 (lower LLOQ than other studies) showed that the t1/2 of voclosporin was 58.2 hours 
based on whole blood concentration data. 
The mean apparent clearance at steady state (CLss/F) after voclosporin 23.7 mg twice daily is 63.6 L/h 
(37.5% CV) (study AUR-VCS-2018-01). 
Mass balance 
Study LX211-05 was a single dose mass balance study of [14C]-voclosporin administered as an oral 
solution (voclosporin 50 mg/ml solution with the same composition as the formulation fill used in the 
capsules intended for commercialisation, diluted in apple juice) containing approximately 70 mg 
(approximately 200 μCi radioactivity) of [14C]-voclosporin (equivalent to a 1.0 mg/kg dose in a 70 kg 
subject) to 6 healthy male subjects following a 10-hour fast. Overall mean recovery of [14C]voclosporin 
in urine and faeces through 168 hours post-dose was 94.8%. Mean recovery in feces and urine was 
92.7% and 2.11%, respectively.  
The mean total amount of unchanged voclosporin accounted for about 5% of the administered dose 
recovered in pooled fecal samples. Unchanged [14C]-voclosporin accounted for a mean of 0.25% of the 
administered dose recovered in the 0 to 48 hours pooled urine sample.

Metabolism 
Based on in vitro data, CYP3A4 was the main enzyme involved in CYP3A4 metabolism. In the in vivo 
study with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole there was a 19-fold increase in AUC of voclosporin 
(see Drug Drug Interaction part).

In the metabolite profiling of the mass balance study, seven circulating metabolites (M1 through M7) 
were identified in human blood. M1 to M7 were also present in urine and/or faeces. Twelve additional 
metabolites, M8 to M18, were also characterised in human faeces.  
Unchanged voclosporin was the major radioactive component in plasma, accounting for approximately 
37% of the total radioactivity in pooled 0 to 24-hour human blood samples. The five most abundant 
circulating metabolites, M1 (IM1-Diol-1), M2 (IM4n9), M3 (IM1w), M4 (IM9) and M6 (IM4n), exhibited 
AUC0-24 that were approximately 25%, 10%, 9%, 44% and 10% of voclosporin AUC0-24, respectively 
(9.5, 4, 3, 17 and 4% of total radioactivity respectively). M4 (IM9) is a major metabolite according to 
the definition given in the Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions. Two minor circulating 
metabolites, M5 (IM4) and M7 (IM4n9n) were observed at approximately 1% and 4% of the 
voclosporin AUC0-24. In addition, an impurity, voclosporin vinyl, which was observed in the dosing 
solution, was also detected in human blood and represented 4% of the total radioactivity in blood. 
Each of the remaining radio-labeled components represented less than 5% of the parent AUC0-24 in 
blood. 
After oral administration of [14C]-voclosporin, renal excretion was limited as 2.11% of the dose was 
recovered in the urine (1.9% recovered during the first 48 hours). Unchanged [14C]-voclosporin 
accounted for a mean of 0.25% of the administered dose recovered in the 0 to 48 hours pooled urine 
sample. Seven (7) metabolites, M1 (IM1-Diol-1), M2 (IM4n9), M3 (IM1w), M4 (IM9), M5 (IM4), M6 
(IM4n) and M19 (unidentified) were detected, each accounting for 0.01% to 0.13% of the dose in the 
0 to 48 hours urine samples. 
In feces, unchanged [14C]-voclosporin was a minor radioactive component, accounting for about 5% of 
the administered dose recovered in the pooled fecal samples. Nineteen (19) minor metabolites were 
tentatively identified, each accounting for less than 5% of the dose in the pooled fecal samples. This 
study also demonstrated that voclosporin does not undergo metabolic degradation when incubated 
(aerobic incubation) for 24 hours at ~37°C in human feces, suggesting that the metabolites in feces 
come from hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion.  
Voclosporin is mainly eliminated by metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4 to form oxidative metabolites, 
followed by excretion in faeces. The metabolism scheme suggested by the applicant is presented in 
Figure 2.

Figure 3: Proposed Metabolic Pathway for Voclosporin in Humans 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
Voclosporin is metabolised to a number of oxidative metabolites. Several of the metabolites have been 
evaluated in one or more clinical studies after single and/or multiple administration of voclosporin. 
Overall exposure of major metabolite M4 (IM9) and total metabolites was uniformly less than parent 
drug. Apparent elimination half-lives for all metabolites were similar to or less than the t1/2 of 
voclosporin and IM9 demonstrated an accumulation ratio similar to parent drug while substantial 
accumulation was observed for IM1-Diol-1. 
Interconversion 
Voclosporin comprises two geometric isomers, a trans-isomer and a cis-isomer, depending on the 
orientation of the modified functional group. Voclosporin is enriched with the trans-isomer (90% to 
95% trans-isomer). In vitro and in vivo evaluations showed that there was no evidence for trans- to 
cis-isomer interconversion.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality of voclosporin was assessed in healthy subjects over a dose range of 0.25 to 
4.5 mg/kg as a single dose and 0.25 to 1.5 mg/kg as multiple BID dose administration. A non-linearity 
between dose and exposure was observed at the lower end of the dose range studied, but the dose 
proportion factor was less than 1.5. 
The population PK analysis in patients with LN did not detect non-linearity of the dose range studied. 
Assessment of voclosporin pre-dose trough concentrations indicated that steady-state conditions were 
achieved after 6 days of twice daily dosing (Studies ISA03-12 and AUR-VCS-2015-J01). The 
accumulation ratio (measured as the ratio of AUC0-12 at steady-state to AUC0-12 after a single dose) 
after BID dosing for 7 to 10 days was independent of dose (0.25 to 1.5 mg/kg) and was around 2. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
After oral administration of voclosporin to healthy volunteers at single doses of 0.5 to 4.5 mg/kg inter-
subject variability (%CV) for Cmax and AUC0-inf ranged from approximately 25% to 27% and 26% to 
40%, respectively. After oral administration of voclosporin at multiple doses of 0.25 to 1.5 mg/kg BID, 
%CV for Cmax and AUC0-12 ranged from approximately 21% to 53% and 34% to 48%, respectively. 
Similar variability in PK parameters was observed in Study AUR-VCS-2018-01, where subjects with LN 
received multiple doses of 23.7 mg BID: 32% for Cmax and 43% for AUC0-12. 
Intra-subject variability was estimated to be 16.1% and 14.2% for Cmax and AUC0-inf, respectively, 
indicating that the inter-subject variability was greater than the intra-subject variability (Study ISA04-
01). 
Based on the population PK analysis on data from sparse sampling in Phase 2 and 3 studies, the inter-
subject variability on CL/F and the volume of the central compartment was 45% and 158%, 
respectively. The degree of inter-subject variability is supported by the 1.7-fold range in mean 
observed CL/F of voclosporin after a multiple dose of 0.4 mg/kg BID. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Sparse sampling strategies were included in two Phase 2 studies (AURA-LV, AURION) and a Phase 3 
study (AURORA 1) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of voclosporin in LN. 
Intensive PK sampling for voclosporin was not performed in the LN patient population, precluding a 
direct comparison of PK parameters in subjects with LN and healthy subjects. However, a single DDI 
study was performed in subjects with SLE (with and without LN), receiving voclosporin 23.7 mg BID in 
the presence of MMF 1 g BID (Study AUR-VCS-2018-01). MMF is not considered to affect the 
exposures of voclosporin. The PK profile of voclosporin after 10 days of BID dosing is presented in 
Figure 3 and derived PK parameters over a dosing interval at steady-state are presented in Table 3.

There does not appear to be a consistent difference in exposure between healthy subjects and subjects 
with LN. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
As LN is an immune-complex mediated renal disease, renal impairment is an inherent characteristic of 
subjects affected with LN. A dedicated study has been performed in otherwise healthy subjects with 
renal impairment (study ISA07-08).  
Study ISA07-08 was an open-label, multi-arm, PK and PD study of voclosporin administered orally in 
male (14) and female (19) subjects with defined renal impairment (as measured by the Cockcroft-
Gault formula) and matched normal healthy subjects under fasting conditions. In the original study 
report, subjects were not classified according to the current guideline on the evaluation of the 
pharmacokinetics in subjects with impaired renal function, but a reclassification was performed based 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 52/53 
 
 
 
 
 
on the recommendations in the current guideline: normal renal function (CLCr ≥90 mL/min), mild renal 
impairment (CLCr 60-89 mL/min), moderate renal impairment (CLCr 30-59 mL/min) and severe renal 
impairment (CLCr <30 mL/min). In line with the conclusion in the original CSR, after single and 
multiple doses, Cmax and AUC were similar in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. After a single dose, severe renal impairment resulted 
in a 1.46- and 1.74-fold higher Cmax and AUC0-48, respectively. 
The cumulative amount of voclosporin excreted in urine over 24 hours decreased with increasing 
impairment of renal function, with amounts excreted ranging from 0.06 to 0.02 mg, representing less 
than 0.1% of the administered dose. 
Markers of renal damage, baseline 24-hour UPCR and eGFR (based on CKD-EPI formula) obtained in 
subjects with LN were also evaluated as potential covariates in the population PK analysis. UPCR and 
eGFR were not not found to influence any of the model parameters in the final population PK model 
(Population PK Report 19 041). 
The LN studies (AURA-LV, AURORA 1) excluded subjects with eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR 
was monitored at every visit. In the event of a decrease in eGFR while on treatment, subjects were re-
evaluated at an unscheduled visit and dose adjustment or dose interruption was considered. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Since voclosporin is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, hepatic 
impairment is likely to decrease its clearance. A dedicated HI study was conducted to characterize the 
effect of impaired hepatic function on the single- and multiple-dose PK of voclosporin and its 
metabolites. 
Study ISA07-09 was a Phase 1, multi-centre, sequential, open-label study to evaluate the PK and PD 
of voclosporin 0.4 mg/kg and metabolites in male and female subjects with defined mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment (assessed by Child-Pugh scale) compared to healthy subjects.   
Administration of voclosporin to subjects with mild (Class A) to moderate (Class B) hepatic impairment 
significantly increased exposure to voclosporin. In subjects with mild hepatic impairment, pre-dose 
concentrations increased 2-fold, while Cmax and AUC increased approximately 1.5- and 1.7-fold, 
respectively, after a single dose, and 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, after multiple doses. In subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment, Cmax and AUC increased 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively, after a single 
dose.   
The cumulative amount of voclosporin excreted in urine over 24 hours increased with a decrease in 
hepatic function, with amounts excreted ranging between 0.08 and 0.17 mg, representing less than 
0.1% of the administered dose. 
Markers of liver impairment (serum albumin, total bilirubin, alanine phosphatase, alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) were also evaluated as potential 
covariates in the population PK analysis in subjects with LN. These markers were not found to influence 
any of the model parameters in the final population PK model. (Population PK Report 19 041). 
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not included in the study and there is limited clinical 
experience with administration of voclosporin in subjects with hepatic impairment, as subjects with 
liver dysfunction (AST, ALT, or bilirubin ≥2.5 times the upper limit of normal) were excluded from the 
Phase 2 and 3 trials.  
Sex, race/ethnicity, weight, age 
The effect of body weight on voclosporin PK was assessed in the population PK analysis of Phase 2 and 
3 data (Population PK Report 19 041). Baseline body weight ranged from 37 to 133 kg. Body weight 
Assessment report

was not found to influence the PK of voclosporin. Body weight did not appear to have a relevant impact 
on exposure.

The effect of age on voclosporin PK was assessed in the population PK analysis of Phase 2 and 3 data. 
Baseline age ranged from 18 to 66 years; hence, limited data in elderly subjects (≥65 years) is 
available. Age was not not found to influence any of the model parameters in the final population PK 
model. Age did not appear to have an impact on exposure. 
The effect of sex on voclosporin PK was assessed in the population PK analysis of Phase 2 and 3 data. 
Few subjects were male (11%), lowering the power to predict a potential effect, if present. Sex was 
not retained as covariate in the population PK model. However, based on individual predicted AUC0-12, 
male subjects showed on average a 17% lower exposure compared to female subjects. No dose 
adjustment for male subjects is required as the clinical relevance of this change in AUC0-12 is limited.  
The effect of race was assessed in a population PK analysis of sparse sampling data obtained in 
subjects with LN. The proportion of black subjects was relatively low (9.3%) diminishing the power to 
predict potential effect, if present. In addition, Study AUR-VCS-2015-J01 examined the PK of single 
and multiple doses of voclosporin in healthy Japanese subjects; PK parameters were compared to 
those obtained in non-Japanese subjects in a comparable study. Asian versus non-Asian on 
bioavailability was found to be a significant covariate and was included in the final model. Asian 
subjects appeared to have a 22% higher exposure (median AUC0−12 (90% CI) ratio of 1.22 [1.14-
1.30]) compared to non-Asian subjects. Based on individual predicted AUC0-12, black subjects showed 
on average 18% lower exposure compared to non-black subjects. Taken together, the results indicate 
that at a therapeutic dose in subjects with LN, race has no clinically relevant impact on PK of 
voclosporin and no dose adjustment is required as the clinical relevance of the changes in AUC0-12 are 
limited.  
The pharmacokinetics of voclosporin has not been studied in subjects less than 18 years of age. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Voclosporin as victim of drug interactions 
Voclosporin is a possible substrate of P-gp based on in vitro data, but does not appear to be a 
substrate of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.  
In vitro data indicate that CYP3A4 is the main CYP enzyme involved in voclosporin metabolism. An in 
vivo study has been performed, investigating the effect of multiple doses of the strong CYP3A4 (and P-
gp) inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg QD for 9 days) on voclosporin exposure following multiple dose 
treatment, that resulted in 19-fold increase of voclosporin AUC and 6-fold increase in Cmax (study 
LX211-06). There is also an in vivo study with multiple doses of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (and P-
gp inhibitor) verapamil (80 mg three times per day (TID) for 10 consecutive days), that resulted in 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 54/55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.7-fold increase in voclosporin AUC and 2.0-fold increase in Cmax (study LX211-07). The applicant 
concludes that the results of the in vivo studies with ketoconazole and verapamil are predominately 
due to CYP3A4 inhibition and not P-gp inhibition. Multiple doses of the strong CYP inducer rifampicin 
(600 mg QD for 10 consecutive days) resulted in 87% lower voclosporin AUC and 68% lower Cmax 
(study LX211-09). A PBPK model was constructed with the aim of evaluating the relative contribution 
of CYP3A4 and P-gp in the metabolism and transport of voclosporin and the likely impact of co-
administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on the PK of voclosporin. 
Voclosporin as perpetrator of drug interactions 
The following cut-offs have been used for voclosporin for assessment of interaction potential in vivo: 
Table 5 Cut-offs for voclosporin for assessment of interaction potential in vivo 
a) Input parameters were Cmax 120 ng/ml in whole blood (study AUR-VCS-2018-01), fu = 0.03, Mw = 
1214.63 g/mol. 
Note that plasma Cmax is normally used for calculation of systemic cut-off, but since voclosporin 
concentrations are only measured in whole blood, this input parameter has been used instead. Plasma 
concentrations are lower than whole blood concentrations; thus using whole blood concentrations is a 
conservative approach (as cut-offs based on plasma concentrations would be lower). 
b) Input parameters F=1, ka= 0.1 min-1, blood-plasma ratio 1.6 
Note that hepatic inlet is calculated based on blood concentrations and thus there is no need to 
recalculate from plasma to blood concentration in this case (blood-plasma ratio is however used to 
calculate fu in blood). 
c) Dose = 23.7 mg 
For the major metabolite IM9 the cut-off was 0.6 µM based on a Cmax value of 0.043 μM (from a 
study where a voclosporin dose of 0.5 mg/kg BID) and using a protein binding of 72.4% (obtained at a 
nominal concentration of 0.1 μM).

Based on in vitro studies, voclosporin does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 or 2D6. There is a 
risk for clinically relevant inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 based on in vitro data. There was no indication 
of time-dependent inhibition.  
There was no signal of induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 (or of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19) at 
concentrations relevant for systemic interaction.  
The major metabolite IM9 does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, CYP3A4 or 2D6.  
An in vivo study has been performed investigating the effect of multiple doses of voclosporin on the 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrate midazolam, where no relevant effect was seen on midazolam exposure 
(AUC within BE criteria and Cmax almost within BE criteria). 
Based on in vitro studies, voclosporin is an inhibitor of P-gp, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 but is not a 
clinically relevant inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K. Voclosporin may also be a 
clinically relevant inhibitor of intestinal BCRP. An in vivo study has been performed investigating the 
effects of multiple doses of voclosporin on the P-gp substrate digoxin, resulting in 1.5-fold increase in 
digoxin Cmax and 1.25-fold increase in digoxin AUC. The applicant has not performed an in vivo study 
with an OATP1B1/ OATP1B3 substrate. Attempts were made to claim that no clinically relevant effects 
were expected based on PBPK, but the applicant has proposed an SmPC warning regarding 
concomitant use with statins, and thus did not rely on the PBPK model. This was considered acceptable 
to the CHMP. 
Voclosporin has been co-administered with MMF in the pivotal clinical study, and therefore the effect of 
multiple doses of voclosporin on blood levels of MMF’s active metabolite MPA or the main inactive 
metabolite MPAG was investigated in an in vivo study. AUC and Cmax of the active metabolite MPA was 
similar following treatment with voclosporin compared to without voclosporin. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
In study AUR-VCS-2018-01, a DDI study performed in subjects with SLE (with and without LN), 
receiving voclosporin 23.7 mg BID in the presence of MMF 1 g BID (not considered to affect the 
exposures of voclosporin), the following exposure parameters were reported at steady state (after 10 
days of BID dosing): 
AUC0-12h: 433 ng*h/ml, corresponding to AUC0-24h of 866 ng*h/ml 
Cmax: 120 ng/ml   
2.5.2.2. Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Voclosporin is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant. Activation of lymphocytes involves an 
increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent 
phosphatase whose activity is required for the induction of T-cell lymphokine production and 
proliferation. The immunosuppressant activity results in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell 
cytokine production, and expression of T-cell activation surface antigens. 
According to the applicant, studies in animal models also support a non-immunological role for 
calcineurin inhibition in kidney function to stabilise actin cytoskeleton and stress fibres in podocytes 
leading to increased podocyte integrity in glomeruli.

Voclosporin Concentrations vs. Calcineurin Inhibition  
According to the applicant, calcineurin inhibition appeared to increase with dose. PK-PD correlation 
demonstrated a strong relationship between drug concentration and calcineurin inhibition. At the 
maximum dose tested the maximal effect (Emax) also appeared to decrease from a maximum 91% 
calcineurin inhibition observed at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg to 89% at 4.5 mg/kg suggesting saturation of the 
immunophilin. Based on a simple Emax model, a half maximal effect concentration (EC50) of 82.7±5.8 
ng/mL was observed for voclosporin. 
Single and Multiple Ascending Dose (Study ISA03-12) 
This was a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose followed by multiple-dose study 
to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of voclosporin in healthy subjects. 
The relationship between calcineurin inhibition and exposure to voclosporin is presented in Table 9.

According to the applicant, a strong correlation between drug concentration and calcineurin inhibition 
was observed. Calcineurin inhibition appeared to increase with dose. At the highest dose levels tested, 
on Day 13 the Emax appeared to decrease from a maximum 88.7% calcineurin inhibition at 1.0 mg/kg 
BID to 77.4% at 1.5 mg/kg BID. This may be due to saturation of the immunophilin binding site. Thus, 
the ability of voclosporin to inhibit calcineurin appears to be dose related up to a maximum dose of 
1.0 mg/kg BID. Based on a simple Emax model, an EC50 of 83.9±9.9 ng/mL and 63.5±8.3 ng/mL was 
observed for voclosporin on Day 1 and Day 13, respectively (Study ISA03-12).  
In Study AUR-VCS-2018-01 (DDI with MMF), multiple PK samples were taken during a 12-hour dosing 
interval at steady-state in subjects with SLE (with or without LN) receiving voclosporin 23.7 mg BID. 
Mean (SD) Ctrough, Cmax and Cavg were 15.0±7.35 ng/mL, 120±38.8 ng/mL and 36.1±15.5 ng/mL, 
respectively. Based on the mean values obtained at a dose of voclosporin 23.7 mg BID, calcineurin 
inhibition was determined to be 15.7% at Ctrough and 58.1% at Cmax, which results in an average 
inhibition of 30.6% during a dosing interval (Table 10).

Similar results were observed based on the calcineurin inhibition obtained in the subjects with plaque 
psoriasis including receiving 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg voclosporin BID (Study ISA04-03 PK/PD Report: 
Emax=104%; EC50=152 ng/mL) and in renal transplant subjects receiving 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mg/kg 
voclosporin BID (Study ISA05-01 PK/PD Report: Emax=100%; EC50=159.5 ng/mL).  
The tolerability of voclosporin up to 1.5 mg/kg BID was evaluated in healthy subjects (Studies 
ISA03-12, ISA05-03 and AUR-VCS-2015-J01). Safety evaluations demonstrated that voclosporin was

generally well tolerated, particularly in subjects receiving the lower doses (0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 mg/kg) 
BID. Subjects receiving 1.5 mg/kg BID had the highest incidence of adverse events (AEs). No relevant 
differences between doses were observed with respect to clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, 
and ECG results. However, AEs of decreased heart rate, increased blood pressure (BP), increased blood 
potassium, decreased blood magnesium and proteinuria were more frequent following voclosporin 
treatment (primarily the 1.5 mg/kg dose) than with placebo. Serum magnesium generally decreased 
more from baseline with voclosporin than with placebo, most notably at the highest dose (1.5 mg/kg 
BID). However, these changes were not clinically significant. In summary, the 1.5 mg/kg BID dose 
may represent the upper limit of tolerability.  
The therapeutic dose for subjects with LN is 23.7 mg BID (or 0.37 mg/kg BID based on the median 
weight of subjects receiving active treatment in AURORA 1). This dose is approximately 4-fold lower 
than the 1.5 mg/kg BID dose which is considered to be the upper limit of tolerability.  
Exposure Response Evaluation 
To assess whether eGFR decreases were related to higher voclosporin exposures, the exposure before 
an eGFR-related dose modification was assessed in LN patients using the population PK model. 
Simulated PK parameters were summarised by eGFR category per the study dose modification 
guidance for both the 23.7 mg BID and 39.5 mg BID (AURA-LV only) dosing regimens. Based on this 
evaluation, there was no distinction between the simulated exposure parameters Cmax, Ctrough and 
AUC0-12 in subjects meeting the eGFR-related dose modification criteria and subjects with an eGFR ≥60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 for both dosing regimens. Voclosporin exposures in subjects who experienced 
decreases in eGFR meeting the criteria for dose modification were within the ranges seen in subjects 
who did not. This suggests that eGFR decreases are not due to higher exposure to the drug, a 
conclusion that is supported by the observation that treatment with the higher dose of 39.5 mg BID 
did not result in a higher rate of eGFR decreases. 
In addition, an exposure (AUC0-12) quartile analysis was performed based on the efficacy response in 
AURA-LV and AURORA 1. The odds ratio (OR) of 1-year adjudicated complete and partial renal 
response was evaluated by exposure quartiles (23.7 mg BID dosing regimen only). The average 
exposure over a dosing interval was obtained based on the final population PK model. Within the 
23.7 mg BID dosing regimen, no relationship between AUC and response was observed. 
A summary of the QT studies is presented in 2.5.8. (clinical safety).  
2.5.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Therapeutic window 
The applicant claimed that based on data from the AURA-LV study, it is safe to use voclosporin up to 
doses (and related exposure) of at least 1.67-fold the therapeutic dose of 23.7 mg BID. However, an 
eGFR monitoring schedule, with recommended dose adjustments based on a decrease in eGFR, should 
be applied. The applicant was asked to discuss this further as there seemed to be a dose-dependent 
risk for adverse events with a higher risk of for example infections and renal failure with the 39.5 mg 
dose. Based on the submitted response, it is agreed with the applicant that the overall data does not 
support a potential dose-dependent risk for infections. Based on the overall data, there seems to be a 
small but consistent dose-dependent risk for kidney injury/decreased GFR, however the difference 
between the arms is very small and the clinical relevance is unclear. The potentially higher risk for 
renal adverse events and hypertension in patients with increased exposure is considered possible to 
handle through monitoring of GFR and blood pressure, followed by dose reduction if clinically needed. 
When combining the predicted AUC0-12h from both 23.7 mg and 39.5 mg BID dose groups the 5th and 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 60/61 
 
 
 
95th percentile values were 297 and 1223 ng.h/mL, respectively. The median value for the 23.7 mg 
BID dose group was 573 ng.h/mL, and the exposure range studied in phase 3 was approximately 2-
fold the median value for the 23.7 mg dose. Given adequate monitoring, a 1.7- to 2-fold increase from 
573 ng.h/mL can be acceptable.   
The applicant was also asked to discuss the lower limit of the therapeutic window. Given a 23.7 mg 
dose, the simulated AUC0-12 ranged from 137 to 1418 ng.h/mL, with a median value of 573 ng.h/mL. 
The 5th and 95th percentile with 287 and 988 ng.h/mL, respectively. Compared to the median value, 
the 5th percentile value was approximately 2-fold lower. It is agreed that this is the therapeutic 
exposure range that has been studied. However, patients that are already in the lower part of the AUC 
range could decrease even further due to e.g. DDI. The lower limit of exposure for loss of efficacy 
remains uncertain. A caution for potential loss of efficacy for scenarios where a decrease in exposure 
could be expected might be advisable. 
Based on this, dose adjustments in case of concomitant treatment with interacting substances as well 
as in case of organ impairment have been proposed as discussed below. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods 
Based on the submitted full and partial validation reports, the methods are considered adequately 
validated. Overall, the within study validation reports show that the methods performed satisfactorily. 
Population PK analysis 
The population PK analysis is overall considered adequate. In the analysis of AURA-LV and AURORA 1 
PK data, 35 patients were found to have aberrant PK profiles and to describe PK in these patients a 
mixture model for central volume of distribution (Vc/F) was applied. Thus, two different Vc/F values 
were reported from the analysis which somewhat decrease the interpretability of the model. However, 
the Vc/F value (34.4 L) reported for the main proportion of patients was largely in line with the Vc/F 
value reported in the analysis of AURA-LV alone (41.0 L, Population PK Report AURA-LV). Given that 
the population PK model describes data well, the parameterisation of the PK model is accepted. 
However, eta shrinkage was moderate to high (18% for CL/F and 61% for Vc/F), subsequently 
exposure predictions from individual Bayes estimates should be interpreted with caution. 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model-based analysis  
The PBPK model for voclosporin was based on prior in vitro and in vivo information across single and 
multiple dosing over a range of dose levels. It is noted that the Km-value for CYP3A4 from in vitro did 
not describe data well and was optimised during model development with the result of a 20-fold 
reduction. It is questionable whether this procedure is reliable. Nevertheless, the main concern with 
the developed PBPK model is the poor prediction of the voclosporin PK profile. To develop a reliable 
PBPK model it is of essence that the model can predict voclosporin PK over a range of dose levels. The 
presented results display both over and under prediction of voclosporin concentration in various 
scenarios. The predicted PK profiles clearly indicate that the elimination phase is not well described but 
also that Cmax is not well predicted. The poor predictive ability of voclosporin PK propagate into a 
large uncertainty of the reliability of simulated voclosporin PK given a DDI. In the verification exercise 
the predicted magnitude of interaction displayed less deviation in the prediction ratio (with the 
exception of verapamil). However, the actual voclosporin exposure levels (Cmax and AUC) consistently 
display both under and over predictions.  In conclusion, due to the poor prediction of voclosporin PK, 
the simulated Cmax and AUC-values under a DDI scenario are not considered reliable and cannot be 
used to support dosing recommendations. See further discussions below on the dosing 
recommendations.

Absorption 
In the mass balance study, a total of 93% of the dose was recovered in faeces. When looking at 
samples used for metabolite characterisation, 88% of the dose was recovered in faeces and very little 
of this was as unchanged parent drug (5% of the dose). This would indicate a high degree of 
absorption, provided that metabolites have not been formed in lumen or faeces (ie by unabsorbed 
parent drug). Although a large part of the metabolites have not been identified in faeces, there is data 
that indicate stability of parent drug in faeces. Thus, it can be concluded that the degree of absorption 
is high, although an exact figure of fraction absorbed is difficult to determine.  
The initial SmPC proposal recommended intake on an empty stomach. This was based on the fact that 
all patients in the phase 3 studies were instructed to take the investigational medicinal product 
(voclosporin or placebo) on an empty stomach. The protocols did however not specify the amount of 
time before or after a meal subjects should wait until taking investigational medicinal product and meal 
intake was not recorded in the studies. Administration of voclosporin with food decreased both the rate 
and extent of absorption. Cmax and AUC of voclosporin were reduced by 53% and 25%, respectively, 
when given with high-fat food and by 29% and 15%, respectively, when given with low-fat food. In 
their responses to CHMP’s questions, the applicant considered that a reduction in AUC up to 25% 
would not affect the efficacy of voclosporin and concluded that voclosporin can be taken irrespective of 
food and that it is not possible to know the conditions of intake in the patient population of the studies 
and thus no instruction on how long to wait between capsule and food intake can be provided. As 
discussed above, there is not much data to support the lower range of the therapeutic window and to 
conclude that a 50% decrease in exposure would not be clinically relevant as claimed by the applicant 
(especially for patients already having an exposure in the lower range). However, the decrease in 
exposure observed with a high-fat meal is considerably lower than 50%. In addition, patients in the 
clinical study will likely not have been strictly fasted as in a fasted PK study, and thus the difference 
between the exposure in the clinical studies and the exposure with a high-fat meal will likely be less 
than 25%. Thus, the effect of food on the AUC of voclosporin is not considered to be clinically relevant. 
CHMP agreed that voclosporin can be taken with or without food and this is adequately reflected in the 
SmPC.

Distribution 
Voclosporin has one metabolite that can be classified as major, M4 (IM9), and for which the potential 
to inhibit CYP enzymes should be investigated according to the DDI guideline. Data regarding plasma 
protein binding data for the major metabolite M4 (IM9) has been submitted as requested, in order to 
determine cut-offs for DDI potential.  
It can be concluded based on in vitro and in vivo data that voclosporin is extensively partitioned into 
red blood cells, although an exact figure of blood/plasma ratio should be given with caution considering 
the dependence on experimental conditions. 
Elimination 
It can be concluded that metabolism followed by biliary secretion in faeces is the main elimination 
pathway for voclosporin. The very large effects on voclosporin exposure by the CYP3A4 inhibitor 
ketoconazole supports that CYP3A4 is the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of voclosporin.  
Urinary excretion of parent drug is a minor elimination pathway.  
The elimination pathways of voclosporin are considered sufficiently well characterised. 
The Guideline on interactions recommends that more than 80% of the excreted dose should be 
identified, and this was not fulfilled as 44% of the dose is described as “unidentified miscellaneous 
components” in faeces. However, the unidentified components are likely numerous trace-level 
metabolites (possibly from further oxidation of primary voclosporin metabolites). Hence, no concern 
was raised from CHMP. 
There is no investigation of absolute bioavailability of voclosporin. The fact that very little unchanged 
parent drug was recovered in faeces would indicate a high degree of absorption, provided that 
metabolites have not been formed in lumen or faeces (ie by unabsorbed parent drug). As stated 
above, a large part of the metabolites has not been identified in faeces. However, there is data that 
indicate stability of parent drug in faeces. Thus, it can be concluded that the degree of absorption is 
high. 
Renal clearance following oral administration was 0.469 L/h and filtration (fu*GFR) is expected to be 
around 0.2 L/h; thus active renal secretion may be involved in the renal elimination. However, as renal 
clearance of unchanged parent drug is a very minor elimination pathway, any effect on renal 
transporters is not likely to affect the elimination of voclosporin. 
Several metabolites are formed. The applicant claims that these metabolites do not contribute to the 
effect of voclosporin, and this is agreed, as they are less potent and have lower exposure in plasma.  
According to the Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions, it is recommended to investigate 
the enzyme inhibitory potential of phase I metabolites with an AUC both larger than one fourth of the 
AUC of parent drug and larger than 10% of the drug-related exposure. This is fulfilled for one of the 
metabolites, M4 (IM9), that has an AUC that is 44% of voclosporin and 17% of total radioactivity. 
Thus, this metabolite should be considered as major and investigated for CYP inhibiting potential. 
Metabolite M1 (IM1-Diol-1) is borderline to be considered a major metabolite, as AUC is 9.5% of total 
radioactivity and 24.8% of parent drug, ie just below the recommended limits. The applicant was 
asked to discuss whether IM1-Diol-1 should be considered a major metabolite, considering the 
borderline results from the mass balance study and the significant accumulation of this metabolite 
observed in the MAD study. Overall, based on data presented, it can be agreed that steady-state M-P 
data do not suggest that IM1-Diol-1 should be considered a major metabolite. All other metabolites 
detected in plasma can be considered minor metabolites. 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 63/64 
 
 
 
No major consequences of genetic polymorphism are expected as CYP3A4 is the most important 
enzyme involved in the metabolism of voclosporin. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
A non-linearity between dose and exposure was observed in the studies in healthy volunteers at the 
lower end of the dose range studied, but the dose proportion factor was less than 1.5. The population 
PK analysis in patients with LN did not detect non-linearity of the dose range studied. 
When comparing AUCtau on day 13 to AUCinf on day 1 in study ISA03-12, the ratio is slightly more than 
unity (range 1-1.7). However, based on the midazolam study, autoinduction is not expected, and there 
is thus no clear mechanism for a time dependency. It can be concluded that there is little or no time 
dependency for voclosporin. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Lupus nephritis is a condition inherently associated with reduced renal function, however patients with 
eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded from the AURA-LV and AURORA 1 clinical studies. 
Voclosporin is excreted renally to a very small extent; thus large effects of renal impairment on 
voclosporin exposure are not expected. However, severe RI may affect the elimination also of non-
renally eliminated drugs, and a dedicated RI study has been performed.  
One weakness with the performed study is however that unbound concentrations were not measured 
and thus PK data based on unbound concentrations were not determined. This is recommended for 
substances that exhibits high extent of plasma protein binding (>90%) in addition to PK parameters 
based on total concentrations. As expected, AUC and Cmax of voclosporin were largely similar when 
comparing subjects with mild or moderate RI to subjects with normal renal function. For subjects with 
severe RI, higher exposure was observed (1.46- and 1.74-fold higher Cmax and AUC0-48, respectively 
when using data from the revised classification according to the current guideline). The SmPC section 
4.2 proposed by the applicant recommends dose reduction to 2/3 of the normal dose if voclosporin is 
used in patients with severe renal impairment. The proposed dose adjustment in severe RI is 
considered reasonable from a pharmacokinetic perspective, as this would be expected to result in 
largely similar exposure compared to the normal dose in patients with normal renal function. Also, 
from a PK perspective, a reduction of starting dose in patients with mild or moderate RI would not 
seem necessary. See 0Considering that eGFR is monitored during treatment and that other aspects 
than PK are relevant regarding the possibility to use voclosporin in subjects with renal impairment, no 
concern is raised regarding the fact that unbound concentrations were not measured in the RI study. 
Hepatic impairment 
Subjects in the moderate HI group were affected in aspects primarily related to elimination capacity of 
drugs, i.e. in markers that are likely to be relevant for the elimination capacity of drugs (such as 
albumin, bilirubin and prothrombin time). 
Unbound concentrations were not measured in the hepatic impairment study, although this is 
recommended in the EMA guideline. If the drug or metabolites exhibit a high extent of plasma protein 
binding, the pharmacokinetics should be described and analysed with respect to the unbound 
concentrations of the drug and active metabolites in addition to total concentration. The applicant was 
asked to discuss the possibility that unbound concentrations would be more affected by HI than total 
concentrations, also considering the binding of voclosporin to erythrocytes. The applicant discussed 
whether patients with lower levels of albumin, which could potentially result in an increased unbound 
fraction of voclosporin, also had an increased safety risk. Low albumin levels are related to disease 
activity (proteinuria). CHMP agreed with the applicant that the frequency of adverse events is larger in 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 64/65 
 
 
 
patients with lower albumin levels both in the voclosporin group and the placebo group, thus likely due 
to disease activity, but it is not known how low albumin levels due to hepatic impairment would affect 
safety. It would have been preferrable if unbound concentrations had been determined in the HI study 
as recommended in the EMA guideline. However, the HI study was performed in subjects with mild and 
moderate hepatic impairment only, and the largest effect on albumin levels would be expected in 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment. In addition, the protein binding is not extremely high (97%). 
For these reasons, it can be accepted that only total concentrations were measured in the HI study and 
that dose adjustment is based on total concentrations.  
Administration of voclosporin to subjects with mild (Class A) to moderate (Class B) hepatic impairment 
significantly increased exposure to voclosporin. In subjects with mild hepatic impairment, pre-dose 
concentrations increased 2-fold, while Cmax and AUC increased approximately 1.5- and 1.7-fold, 
respectively, after a single dose, and 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, after multiple doses. In subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment, Cmax and AUC increased 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively, after a single 
dose.   
The proposed dose adjustment in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (dose-reduction 
to 2/3 of the normal dose expected to lead to slightly higher total exposure (1.3-fold) than in patients 
with normal hepatic function taking a normal dose, based on HI study showing up to 2-fold increase in 
total exposure) can be accepted.  
Other special populations 
It is agreed that no dose adjustments are necessary for other special populations. A population 
pharmacokinetic analysis assessing the effects of age, sex, race and body weight did not suggest any 
clinically significant impact of these covariates on voclosporin exposures. 
Interactions 
Voclosporin as victim of interactions 
The ketoconazole study confirmed that voclosporin is a very sensitive CYP3A4 substrate and that 
CYP3A4 is the main enzyme involved in voclosporin metabolism. Possibly, an even higher effect would 
have been seen with a longer ketoconazole treatment, but it is clear that voclosporin is very sensitive 
to the effects of ketoconazole. 
Based on in vitro data, voclosporin is a possible P-gp substrate but the study is inconclusive. It is 
however agreed that the results of the in vivo studies with ketoconazole and verapamil are 
predominately due to CYP3A4 inhibition and not P-gp inhibition, as the mass balance study shows high 
absorption (indicating that P-gp is not significantly involved in absorption) and as renal/biliary 
excretion of unchanged voclosporin are very minor routes of elimination (indicating that P-gp is not 
significantly involved in elimination). Thus, it is not considered necessary to mention P-gp inhibitors in 
the SmPC. The in vitro study investigating voclosporin as substrate of BCRP is considered inconclusive. 
However, even if voclosporin would be a BCRP substrate, similar as for P-gp, large effects of BCRP-
inhibitors would not be expected.  
Active secretion of unchanged drug is not a major route of drug elimination based on the mass balance 
study, and thus it is not mandatory to investigate if voclosporin is a substrate of transporters involved 
in renal/biliary excretion. 
Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is proposed to be contraindicated, which is agreed. The 
PBPK model cannot be used to support any claims regarding DDI potential (see above); thus, the 
effect of additional moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or mild CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be predicted using the 
PBPK model. Regarding use with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, there is in vivo data with verapamil that 
can be used to support dose adjustments. The proposed dose adjustment in case of concomitant 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 65/66 
 
 
 
administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (dose-reduction to half the normal dose expected to 
lead to slightly larger exposure than with the normal dose without moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (1.4-
fold increase), based on verapamil in vivo data showing 2.7-fold increase in exposure) was accepted by 
CHMP. 
In case of concomitant treatment with mild CYP3A4 inhibitors, the exposure of a sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate could by definition increase up to 2-fold. This is borderline to what has been studied, and it 
should be noted that the upper limit of the therapeutic window discussed above is based on median 
exposure; thus, a patient who is in the higher exposure range could be outside the studied range if the 
exposure was increased 2-fold. However, a dose adjustment is not considered adequate as most mild 
inhibitors would result in less than 2-fold increase in exposure. CHMP considered that this was possible 
to handle through adequate monitoring and a statement regarding this has been added in the SmPC. 
Concomitant use of voclosporin with moderate or severe CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended. This is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. A mild CYP3A4 inducer may according to definition result in up to 
50% decrease in AUC of a sensitive substrate. As previously concluded, there is not much data to 
support the lower range of the therapeutic window and to conclude that a 50% decrease in exposure 
would not be clinically relevant (especially for patients already having an exposure in the lower range). 
It is not necessary to have a recommendation that concomitant use is not recommended (as for 
moderate/strong inducers); however, this has been added to the SmPC and endorsed by the CHMP. 
Voclosporin is to be used with background therapy consisting both of MMF and corticosteroids. 
Interaction potential of voclosporin to influence the MMF pharmacokinetics was evaluated in a 
dedicated clinical study showing no significant interaction. The published literature suggests that 
corticosteroids may have a CYP3A4 inducing effect, although the data are conflicting. Voclosporin, 
being a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, could be affected by corticosteroids co-administration. The 
applicant was asked to discuss the interaction potential between corticosteroids and voclosporin. PK 
sampling in study AUR-VCS-2018-01 allowed estimation of Cmax and AUC0-12. Voclosporin exposure 
with prednisone co-administration (different doses combined as well as individual doses) was 
comparable to voclosporin exposure without prednisone co-administration.  In AURORA 1 study, only 
sparse PK sampling was performed, but no difference was observed in voclosporin concentrations with 
and without corticosteroid background therapy. Overall, based on provided data no clinically relevant 
interaction is expected between voclosporin and corticosteroid background therapy. 
Voclosporin as perpetrator of interactions 
In some in vitro studies there were issues with non-specific binding and low recovery, while this was 
not investigated in other in vitro studies and thus it is not known if actual studied concentrations were 
lower than nominal concentrations. This gives some uncertainty to the observed IC50 values, but 
regarding inhibition of CYP enzymes (except CYP3A4) and inhibition of the transporters OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K , a clinically relevant interaction may still be excluded as Ki values were 
well above the relevant cut-offs.  
There was no signal of induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 (or of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19) by 
voclosporin at concentrations relevant for systemic interaction. For CYP3A4, the highest studied 
concentration of 7 μM was lower than the cut-off of 7.8 μM relevant for intestinal induction, and at the 
highest studied concentration of 7 μM there were also issues with cell toxicity so that results should be 
interpreted with caution. At the concentrations of 3 μM and 7 μM there was no sign of induction of 
CYP3A4, but rather of down-regulation. There is an in vivo midazolam study that did not demonstrate 
a clinically relevant effect of voclosporin on midazolam exposure; thus any inhibition/induction/down-
regulation resulted in no net effect on the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. The applicant has 
also presented in vitro induction data for other PXR regulated enzymes (CYP2C8, 2C9, or 2C19) that do 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 66/67 
 
 
 
not indicate a risk for induction. It can be concluded that a clinically relevant induction by voclosporin 
can be excluded. 
An in vivo study has been performed investigating the effects of multiple doses of voclosporin on the P-
gp substrate digoxin, resulting in 1.25-fold increase in digoxin AUC. Digoxin is however not a sensitive 
substrate for intestinal inhibition (due to its rather high oral bioavailability), and the effect may be 
larger on P-gp substrates that are more sensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition, such as dabigatran 
etexilate.  
In vitro inhibition data indicate a risk for in vivo inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by voclosporin at 
clinically relevant concentrations and the PBPK model cannot be used to exclude a clinically relevant 
effect on OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrates. The applicant has agreed to perform an in vivo study with a 
sensitive OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrate and the CHMP recommends the applicant to submit the results 
of this study when available.  
The observed IC50 value for BCRP is well above the cut-off for systemic inhibition (0.1 µM). The 
applicant was asked to discuss the risk of in vivo relevant inhibition of intestinal BCRP considering that 
the observed IC50 value (>10 µM (45% inhibition at 10 µM)) is close to the relevant cut-off (7.8 µM) 
and as stability and non-specific binding of voclosporin in the in vitro inhibition experiment has not 
been discussed (thus IC50 may possibly be overestimated in the study). Also, Ki should generally be 
used in the interpretation of in vitro results, and this has not been discussed by the applicant. The 
applicant concluded that an in vivo-relevant inhibition could not be excluded and included a warning 
regarding BCRP substrates in the SmPC section 4.5. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
There is one major metabolite, M4 (IM9), that has been investigated for potential to inhibit CYP 
enzymes according to the guideline. It can be concluded that there is no signal for in vivo-relevant 
inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 by the major metabolite 
M4 (IM9). 
Exposure response evaluation 
To assess whether eGFR decreases were related to higher voclosporin exposures, the exposure over 
12-hours prior to an eGFR-related dose modification was derived in LN patients using the population PK 
model. For patients without an eGFR decrease the exposure over the last dosing interval was used. 
This strategy assumes that it is the exposure just prior to the measured eGFR decrease that is driving 
the effect, which might not be the case.  Furthermore, the reported results are categorised according 
to percent eGFR reduction from baseline for patients with eGFR values <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, whereas 
a reduction from baseline eGFR for patients above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is not reported. The 
categorisation of eGFR reduction decrease the information content compared to an analysis of change 
from baseline eGFR for all patients. Nonetheless, CHMP agreed that the presented results do not 
indicate an impact of exposure on reduction of eGFR and thus it is not foreseen that therapeutic drug 
monitoring would be meaningful in predicting eGFR reduction. 
Exposure-safety trends were investigated by reporting the first occurrence of observed adverse events 
in the pivotal studies summarised by predicted exposure quartiles. However, it is not clear how the 
number of events (E) can be larger than the number of subjects (n) if it is the first event that is 
reported. Nevertheless, the only trend of increasing AEs with increasing exposure was for vascular 
disorders which will be monitored (elevated blood pressure) in LN patients with voclosporin treatment. 
Thus, the questions regarding the descriptive exposure-safety summary was not be further pursued by 
the CHMP.   
In addition, a logistic regression analysis based on 1-year adjudicated complete and partial renal 
response by exposure quartiles (23.7 mg BID dosing regimen only) has been presented. However, due 
to dose adjustment based on eGFR the average exposure over a dosing interval from 0-24 weeks is 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 67/68 
 
 
 
not considered meaningful as the exposure could change over time whereas the renal response is only 
measured at one point in time.   
Individual predictions from the population PK analysis should be used with caution due to shrinkage 
the calculation of individual clearance and volume of distribution values, subsequently the exposure-
response analyses should be interpreted with caution. In addition, the dose adjustment regimen used 
in the pivotal studies further introduces uncertainty of the interpretation of exposure-response 
relationships for voclosporin. Nevertheless, no alarming exposure-response trends have been detected 
thus there is no indication that therapeutic drug monitoring would be meaningful in predicting eGFR 
reduction. 
The clinical pharmacology information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Voclosporin is metabolised by CYP3A4 and is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). It is an inhibitor of 
organic-anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. Co-administration of 
voclosporin with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin) is contra 
indicated. 
The CHMP recommends the applicant to submit the results of the planned in vivo DDI study, 
investigating the effects of voclosporin on simvastatin and its active metabolite simvastatin acid as 
substrates for OATP1B1/OATP1B3, when available. 
Limited data are available on the use of Lupkynis in LN patients with baseline eGFR 30 to < 45 
mL/min/1.73 m2. It is recommended to use Lupkynis in these patients, only if the benefit outweighs 
the risk, and at a starting dose of 23.7 mg twice daily. Lupkynis has not been studied in LN patients 
with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and is not recommended in these patients 
unless the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, the recommended starting dose is 15.8 mg twice daily. 
The CHMP concluded that the clinical pharmacology data supported the application for voclosporin.  
2.5.5. Clinical efficacy 
2.5.5.1. Dose response study(ies) 
The selection of VCS doses was based on previous  experience  with  VCS  in healthy  subjects  and  in  
other  autoimmune  indications (i.e., renal transplant, plaque psoriasis, and non-infectious uveitis).  In  
these autoimmune indications, subjects  were  administered  VCS  at  doses  ranging  from  0.2 mg/kg  
BID  to 0.8 mg/kg  BID.  In  an  integrated  analysis  of  safety  comparing  doses of  0.2 mg/kg  BID,  
0.3 mg/kg BID, 0.4 mg/kg BID, and 0.6 mg/kg BID, a difference was observed between the 0.6 mg/kg 
BID dose and the lower doses. Subjects in the higher dose group had more AEs,  serious  adverse  
events  (SAEs),  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  and  the frequency of AEs related to renal 
dysfunction and changes in serum creatinine were also higher in the high-dose group. In addition, 
population PK analyses of VCS concentrations from  the  clinical  development  programme  (including  
healthy  subjects  and  subjects  from  other autoimmune indications) demonstrated that weight did 
not have a significant effect on the PKs of VCS. Therefore, weight-based dosing is not considered 
necessary. In consideration of the efficacy and safety of VCS in the studies discussed above, doses 
equivalent to approximately 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg BID (low-dose) and 0.5 to 0.6 mg/kg BID (high-dose) 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022

were  selected  for  the  AURA-LV  study,  i.e.,  23.7  mg  BID  (three capsules BID)  and 39.5 mg BID 
(five capsules BID). Voclosporin was administered as fixed doses without the use of therapeutic drug 
monitoring.  To  ensure  the  safety  of  subjects  randomised  to  the high-dose (39.5  mg  BID)  
group, subjects were  started  on  low-dose  (23.7  mg  BID)  VCS for  the  first  2  weeks  after  
randomisation  and  titrated  up  to  high-dose  VCS  at  Week  2.  The  protocol  contained  detailed 
provisions for management of dose based on safety concerns, in particular, blood pressure  and  renal  
function.  The applicant states that the  safety  data  from  the  use  of  VCS demonstrates  that  these  
risks  are  dose-related,  reversible,  and  can  be  managed  by  dose  reduction  and  temporary  
interruption. Therefore, close  monitoring  of  eGFR  and  blood  pressure and dose  modification  as  
needed  was  included  in  the  protocol  to  prevent  and manage potential CNI-associated nephron 
toxicity.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were in line with the pivotal phase 3 AURORA 1 study, except for the 
following: In the AURA-LV study, all subjects had to have a kidney biopsy performed within 6 months 
of screening. In the AURORA 1 study, in addition to subjects with biopsies within 6 months before 
screening, subjects with older biopsies up to 2 years before screening could also be eligible. 
In the AURA-LV study an additional exclusion criteria of serum potassium >5.5 mmol/L at screening, 
and a medical history of pancreatitis or gastrointestinal haemorrhage within 6 months of screening or 
active unhealed peptic ulcer within 3 months of screening. AURORA 1 had an additional exclusion 
criterion on the use of live vaccines during the study. 
Treatments 
Study treatments administered during the study were as follows: 
Dose modification of VCS/placebo was permitted for tolerability reasons. A specific schedule was 
implemented for dose reduction with regards to decrease in kidney function or increase in blood 
pressure. In addition to VCS/placebo, all subjects received background standard of care with MMF and 
corticosteroids.

Complete remission occurred earlier in subjects treated with either low-dose or high-dose voclosporin 
compared to placebo (HR=2.26; 95% CI: 1.45, 3.51 for low-dose voclosporin and HR=2.25; 95% CI: 
1.46, 3.47 for high-dose voclosporin). The median time to complete remission was 19.7 weeks in the 
low-dose voclosporin group and 23.4 weeks in the high-dose voclosporin group. The median time to 
complete remission in the placebo group was not calculable as the placebo curve did not reach 
probability of 0.5.

Deaths 
In total, 13 subjects (4.9% of the total study population) died during the study. The frequency of 
deaths was higher in the low-dose VCS treatment group (10 (11.2%) subjects) compared to either the 
high-dose VCS (2 (2.3%) subjects) or placebo (1 (1.1%) subject) treatment group. None of the deaths 
were considered related to study drug by the Investigators. A review of the deaths revealed that all but 
one death in the placebo group and one death in the low-dose VCS group occurred within the low-GDP 
subgroup; 54% (7/13) of all deaths occurred in two sites in Bangladesh. The causes of death were 
multi-factorial including sepsis and other lupus related complications. The majority of the deaths (69% 
(9/13)) occurred during the first few weeks of initiation of treatment with study drug. A dose 
relationship could not be established for the deaths.  
After in-depth review of extensive post-hoc data analyses, the DSMB concluded that the higher 
incidence of deaths in the low-dose VCS group was attributable to factors predisposing subjects to fatal 
outcomes in the study and local imbalances in randomisation. The subjects who died had more severe 
renal disease, with clinical and laboratory features consistent with malnutrition and other comorbidities 
at BL. Key BL characteristics, independent of treatment group, that were shown to have a statistically 
significant association with an outcome of death were UPCR >5 mg/mg, low serum albumin (<2 
mg/dL), high lymphocytes (>1.8 x 109/L), high diastolic blood pressure (>85 mmHg), elevated pulse 
(>90 bpm) and enrolment from low-GDP countries (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Philippines).

Treatments 
Voclosporin was orally administered at a dose of 23.7 mg BID given as three 7.9 mg soft gel capsules 
per dose for 52 weeks. Matching placebo soft gel capsules were orally administered at a dose of 3 
capsules BID for 52 weeks.  
Doses were taken with water on an empty stomach every 12 hours or as close to a 12-hour schedule 
as possible, with a minimum of 8 hours between doses. If the subject missed a dose of study 
treatment by less than 4 hours from the anticipated dosing time, the missed dose was to be taken 
immediately. The next dose was to be taken at the originally scheduled time. If a missed dose of study 
treatment was greater than 4 hours from the expected dosing time, the subject skipped the dose and 
took the next dose at the originally scheduled time. 
All participants received concomitant MMF and corticosteroids.

Corticosteroid treatment 
Table 21 Dosing Schedule for IV Methylprednisolone and Daily Oral Prednisone (mg) 
Subjects with a lack of response were allowed one 4-week interval without dose reduction or one dose 
escalation to the previous dose for 2 weeks at any time during the study. Lack of response was defined 
as no or minimal change in UPCR per Investigator judgment over 3 visits or deterioration in UPCR not 
meeting the criteria for withdrawal. All deviations from the prescribed dosing schedule had to be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor and documented in the source notes and eCRF.

Mycophenolate Mofetil treatment 
Subjects who were receiving MMF prior to randomisation continued without interruption. Subjects on 
azathioprine or mycophenolate sodium at screening were switched to MMF at baseline (Day 1). For 
subjects who were not already taking prescribed MMF prior to randomisation, the dosing of MMF 
started at 0.5 g BID for a total daily dose of 1 g/day for the first week, increasing to 1 g BID for a total 
daily dose of 2 g/day for the second and subsequent weeks (i.e., beginning on Day 8). A stable dose of 
MMF was to be maintained throughout the study. Dose changes or interruptions were permitted for 
clearly documented safety reasons only, including gastrointestinal disturbance and decreases in 
absolute neutrophil count. 
Discontinuation from Study Treatment Due to Early Non-response to Therapy 
Subjects could be discontinued from study treatment if their early disease response was 
suboptimal if the subject meets 1 of the 2 following criteria:  
After 12 weeks of treatment, the subject shows a >30% decrease from baseline value

Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
To assess the efficacy of voclosporin compared with placebo in achieving renal response after 52 weeks 
of therapy in subjects with active lupus nephritis (LN)  
Secondary Objective: 
To assess the safety and tolerability of voclosporin over 52 weeks compared with placebo in subjects 
with active 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of subjects showing renal response at Week 52. Renal 
response was adjudicated based on blinded data by the CEC based on meeting the following criteria: 
UPCR of ≤0.5 mg/mg, and  
eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or no confirmed decrease from baseline in eGFR of >20%, and 
Received no rescue medication for LN, and 
Did not receive more than 10 mg prednisone for ≥3 consecutive days or for ≥7 days in total during 
Weeks 44-52, just prior to the renal response assessment.  
Subjects who withdrew from the study prior to the Week 52 assessment were defined as non-
responders.  
Note: To be disqualified from renal response, the subject had to fail both eGFR measures (i.e., 
confirmed eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 AND confirmed >20% drop from baseline) and have an 
associated treatment-related or disease-related AE that impacted eGFR.

Sample size 
The planned sample size was 324 subjects (162 subjects per treatment arm) based on a two-group 
continuity-corrected Chi squared test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level and 80% power. The 
assumptions made at the planning stage were a placebo response rate of 20.0% and a voclosporin 
response rate of 34.4%. Adjustment of sample size for withdrawals was not planned since subjects 
withdrawing for any reason were to be counted as non-responders in the primary analysis. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
All subjects meeting eligibility criteria were randomised at baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2) in a ratio of 1:1 to 
receive either voclosporin 23.7 mg BID or matching placebo using an interactive web response system 
(IWRS). Randomisation was stratified by biopsy class (Class V versus Others) and prior MMF use at 
screening (yes versus no). Region was used as a blocking factor to ensure balance within each region: 
North America, Latin America, Europe/South Africa, and Asia Pacific. According to the applicant, 
regional differences were not expected and blocking by region was more for drug distribution reasons. 
As a sensitivity analysis the primary endpoint analysis was repeated omitting region from the model; 
the impact on the point estimate for the difference was shown to be only minor.  
Study AUR-VCS-2016-01 had a double-blind design and voclosporin and placebo were to be identical in 
taste, smell, and appearance. All study personnel and subjects were to be blinded to study treatment 
until the end of the study. In case of emergency, there was an unblinding process in place with 
procedures for unblinding provided in a separate manual. It has been reported that the blind was 
broken for only one patient (in the placebo arm).  
A Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC) adjudicated renal response by reviewing blinded data. The 
working procedures and responsibilities of the CEC was described in a separate charter document. The 
submitted AURORA 1 CEC Charter was version Draft V2 dated 03 July 2019. Changes made compared 
to any earlier version was not described. Upon request, the applicant clarified that renal response was 
to be reviewed once a subject had completed the study. This was expected to occur on an ongoing 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 86/87 
 
 
 
basis between July 2019 and the database lock in November 2019, but as has been explained, the 
actual CEC review did not start before mid-October. With this clarification along with the confirmation 
that the CEC charter dated 03 July 2019 is the final version, a concern for that CEC adjudications could 
have been performed based on different instructions is alleviated. 
Statistical methods 
All statistical analyses were performed at study closure and incorporated all Week 24 and Week 52 
endpoints. There were no interim analyses planned and none was performed.  
Details of the statistical analysis were provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The AUR-VCS-
2016-01 SAP version 5.0 (dated 21 Oct 2019) contained an amendment history describing 
revisions/additions made before database lock (01 November 2019) and their rational. 
The primary analysis population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisting of all randomised 
subjects. Analyses were based on the treatment to which the subject had been randomised. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the number of subjects with renal response week 52 based on pre-defined 
criteria (see above) and adjudicated by the CEC). 
The CEC was also to consider the following: 
• Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to the Week 52 assessment and provide insufficient 
week 52 data to determine response will be defined as non-responders. Subjects who discontinued 
study drug but continued to attend study visits (as was the expectation) were to have their data 
assessed for response. 
• eGFR values eliminating a subject from complete remission should be accompanied by a treatment or 
disease-related treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) that impacts eGFR. 
An estimand was defined with SAP version 3.0 (March 2019). 
Intercurrent events included: 
• Treatment discontinuation for any reason  
o the subject remains on study allowing the primary endpoint to be assessed at 1 year. 
• Study discontinuation  
o resulting in insufficient information at 1 year to ascertain response status leading to assumed non-
response. 
• Rescue medication taken at any time prior to the primary assessment at 1 year  
o results in non-response. Rescue medication is adjudicated by the Clinical Endpoints Committee.  
• Death at any time prior to the 1-year primary assessment 
o results in assumed non-response. 
Primary endpoint analysis 
Renal response week 52 was analysed using logistic regression. The logistic regression model included 
terms for treatment, baseline UPCR, biopsy class, MMF use at baseline and region. The proportion of 
subjects achieving renal response at Weeks 52 were summarised by treatment group and the 
comparison between treatments was displayed with the odds ratio, a 2-sided 95% CI and the p-value.  
Subjects who withdraw from the study prior to the Week 52 assessment were defined as non-
responders. 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 87/88 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was analysed based on the ITT population using two different logistic regression 
models; one including only a term for treatment and the other including terms for treatment, baseline 
UPCR, biopsy class and MMF use at baseline, i.e., omitting the regional covariate. The odds ratios, 95% 
confidence intervals and p-values for voclosporin compared to placebo were reported. 
In addition, a number of subgroup analyses were defined to be based on age (≤30 versus >30), 
gender, race (White, Asian, Other), biopsy class, region (defined at the continental level and, where 
numbers allow, country level), MMF use at screening, and Maximum MMF Dose (≤2g versus >2g).  
Supplementary analyses based on the primary endpoint 
A number of supplementary analyses were planned and have been presented.  
• Renal response at Week 52 was derived programmatically and analysed in an identical fashion to the 
primary analysis. All components of the primary response endpoint were independently programmed 
apart from the use of rescue medication for which the CEC adjudication was used and incorporated into 
the programmed endpoint. 
• The primary endpoint analysis was repeated for the per protocol analysis set. 
• The primary endpoint analysis was repeated for each biopsy class category (Class III, Class III/V, 
Class IV, Class IV/V, Class V and Class VI). A separate category defined as “All but Pure Class V” was 
also to be defined. 
• For both the adjudicated week 52 renal response (primary endpoint) and the programmed week 52 
renal response (supplementary endpoint), each individual component (and some component groups) of 
the endpoint was to be summarised by treatment group and analysed in the same manner using a 
logistic regression. 
Tipping point analysis for primary endpoint  
The impact of withdrawals on the primary endpoint was investigated in a tipping point analysis.  
Key secondary endpoints 
Key secondary binary endpoints were analysed in a similar manner to the primary endpoint and 
endpoints measured as a time-to-event were displayed using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Comparisons 
between voclosporin and placebo were performed using a log rank test and Cox proportional hazard 
regression.  
Other secondary endpoints 
Continuous (/change from baseline) endpoints have been analysed using Mixed Effect Model Repeated 
Measures (MMRM) based on a model including terms for treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction 
and baseline.  
Multiplicity 
An overall type 1 error rate of 5% for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints was to be 
maintained; the Hochberg step-up procedure was used to adjust for multiple comparisons amongst key 
secondary endpoints, see figure below.

Hochberg procedure 
Post-hoc analyses in reply to CHMP advice 
Regarding the eGFR assessment, the applicant was strongly recommended (CHMP advice, 
EMEA/H/SA/3483/1/2017/SME/III) to remove the “>60 ml/min/1.73m2” component from the 
definition of stable renal function and instead define it solely on an acceptable confirmed % reduction 
in eGFR, preferably < 10-15% and using different cut-offs for confirmed %reduction in eGFR as part of 
sensitivity analyses. The criterion for eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was retained and post-hoc analyses 
using no confirmed decrease from baseline >10%/>15%/>20% in corrected eGFR, respectively were 
conducted.

The most common reason for screen failure was a lack of evidence of active nephritis. A total of 357 
eligible subjects were randomised into the study: 178 to the placebo arm and 179 to the voclosporin 
arm. A large number of subjects entered screening towards the end of the study. They were permitted 
to complete screening and enrol if eligible, hence the total number of subjects was greater than 
planned. Overall, 309 subjects (86.6%) completed the study, with more subjects in the voclosporin 
arm (162 subjects [90.5%]) than the placebo arm (147 subjects [82.6%]) reaching Week 52.  
Study treatment was discontinued in 59 subjects (33.1%) in the placebo arm and 43 subjects (24.0%) 
in the voclosporin arm. The most common reason for study treatment discontinuation was intolerable 
AE, recorded for a similar number of subjects in each arm (24 subjects [13.5%] in the placebo arm 
and 23 subjects [12.8%] in the voclosporin arm). More subjects in the placebo arm discontinued study 
treatment due to lack of efficacy than in the voclosporin arm (11 [6.2%] and 4 [2.2%] subjects, 
respectively).

Recruitment 
First subject enrolled: 17 May 2017 
Last subject last visit: 10 October 2019 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in 142 centres in 27 countries in North America, Latin America, Europe, 
South Africa and Asia. 
The original protocol was finalised on 01 December 2016 and the protocol was amended once during 
the study (protocol Version 2, 04 May 2017).  
The key changes were: 
The time point for the primary efficacy endpoint of renal response was changed from Week 24 to Week 
52, based on data from other clinical studies (see Section 9.2) and feedback from regulatory 
authorities. Renal response at Week 24 was included as a secondary endpoint.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of UPCR of ≤0.7 mg/mg was amended to UPCR of ≤0.5 mg/mg, in line 
with current guidelines and EMA recommendations.  
The time duration limits for prednisone use for renal response were modified from ‘Received ≤10 
mg/day prednisone from Weeks 16 through 24’ to ‘Did not receive more than 10 mg prednisone for ≥3 
consecutive days or for ≥7 days in total during Weeks 44 through 52’ for consistency with the Phase 2 
AURA-LV study. 
The secondary endpoint ‘Proportion of subjects experiencing a confirmed >30% decrease from baseline 
in eGFR at each time point’  was added following discussions with PMDA and EMA to ensure that the 
clinical profile of voclosporin was fully characterised.  
The time window for the biopsy used for screening was extended from ‘within 6 months of screening’ 
to ‘within 2 years of screening’. Any subject having a biopsy over 6 months old was reviewed by the 
Medical Monitor for recent disease activity and clinical features of a renal flare to ensure eligibility.  
The final approval of Protocol Version 2 was received on 11 February 2019. As a result of regulatory 
agency feedback, changes were made to the planned analyses which were described in the SAP but not 
reflected in the protocol.  
• 
In the randomisation, regional differences were not expected and blocking by region was done 
more for drug distribution reasons. While the analysis specified in the protocol stipulated that 
the regional blocking factor was not to be used in the analysis models, the final model included 
terms for each of the factors used in the randomisation process: −Biopsy class (Class V vs 
Others) MMF use at screening (Yes vs No)−Region (North America, Latin America, Europe + 
South Africa and Asia Pacific) 
• 
‘Duration  of  UPCR  ≤0.5 mg/mg’ and ‘Proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  a  confirmed 
>30% decrease from baseline in eGFR at each time point’ were changed from key secondary 
endpoints to ‘other’ secondary endpoints and removed from the hierarchical testing procedure.

Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations were recorded for 61 subjects (34.3%) in the placebo arm and 67 subjects 
(37.4%) in the voclosporin arm. The most common deviations related to study procedures (38 subjects 
[10.6%]), study drug (33 subjects [9.2%]), restricted concomitant medication (31 subjects [8.7%]) 
and randomisation procedure (26 subjects [7.3%]). Protocol deviations resulting in the exclusion of a 
subject from the PP population were identified in 22 subjects (12.4%) in the placebo arm and 18 
subjects (10.1%) in the voclosporin arm.

The applicant states that a total of 39 subjects (11%) had a biopsy more than 6 months prior to 
screening; of these subjects, the majority had a biopsy between 6 and 12 months prior with 12 (3%) 
having a biopsy more than 12 months prior to screening. The applicant also states that the timing of 
biopsies taken more than 6 months prior to screening was balanced between treatment groups (>6 
months to 12 months: 14 placebo and 13 voclosporin subjects; and >12 months: 7 placebo and 5 
voclosporin subjects).

Primary Endpoint: CEC Adjudicated Renal Response at Week 52 
The primary endpoint was the number of subjects showing renal response at Week 52 as adjudicated 
by the CEC, analysed using a logistic regression model with terms for treatment, baseline UPCR, biopsy 
class, MMF use at baseline and region.  
Table 33 Adjudicated Renal Response at Week 52 (ITT Population) 
Upon request the applicant clarified that for most non-responders, a subject’s status could be 
calculated owing to that sufficient data was available at week 52; non-responder imputation was used 
for 14/179 (7.8%) and 25/178 (14.0%) subjects in the voclosporin and placebo arm, respectively.

Similar results were seen for supplementary analyses, i.e., for the PP population (OR 2.55; 95% CI: 
1.55, 4.18; p<0.001), and for the programmed renal response (OR 2.32; 95% CI: 1.43, 3.78; 
p<0.001); and for sensitivity analyses including only a  term for treatment (OR2.38; 95% CI: 1.50, 
3.77; p<0.001) and omitting the regional covariate (OR 2.58; 95% CI: 1.61, 4.14; p<0.001). 
Logistic regression analyses for each individual component of response (UPCR ≤0.5 mg/mg, eGFR 
success, no rescue medication and not more than 10 mg prednisone for ≥3 consecutive days or for ≥7 
days during Weeks 44-52) showed that UPCR ≤0.5 mg/mg was the only significant factor in the 
observed difference in adjudicated renal response between the two treatment arms ( OR 3.11; 95% 
CI: 1.93, 5.00; p<0.001). UPCR≤0.5 mg/mg(OR 2.53; 95% CI: 1.57, 4.09; p<0.001) and, to a lesser 
extent, eGFR success (OR 2.04; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.84; p=0.027) were both significant components of 
the results based on programmed renal response.

Upon request, the applicant explained that although the total number of responders and non-
responders were the same in the adjudicated and programmed renal response analysis respectively, 
the individual responding subjects differed concerning a total of six subjects all in the voclosporin arm. 
The difference in subjects led to a different covariate pattern and the slightly different estimates.

Figure 11 Kaplan-Meier  Curve  of  Time  (Days)  to  UPCR ≤0.5 mg/mg  (ITT  Population) 
Time to 50% Reduction in UPCR  
A 50% reduction in UPCR from baseline at any time during the study was achieved by 96.6% of 
subjects treated with voclosporin compared with 75.8% of subjects receiving placebo The time taken 
to reach a 50% reduction in UPCR was significantly shorter for the voclosporin arm than the placebo 
arm ( HR 2.05; 95% CI: 1.62, 2.60; p<0.001). Median time to 50% reduction in UPCR was 29 days for 
voclosporin versus 63 days for placebo. Similar results were seen when using the lowest available pre-
dose UPCR measurement as baseline. 
Table 39 Analysis of Time (Days) to 50% Reduction in UPCR from Baseline (ITT Population) 
Consistent with the time to UPCR ≤0.5 mg/mg, the difference between the two treatment arms in the 
time to 50% reduction in UPCR was apparent within the first month of treatment and was sustained 
throughout the study (see figure below). The Kaplan-Meier curve shows that a small number of 
subjects in the placebo arm achieved a 50% reduction in UPCR late on the study (beyond Day 350). 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022

However, most subjects in the voclosporin arm achieved this response earlier, with only 6 subjects still 
“at risk” beyond Day 300 compared to 38 subjects in the placebo arm.

Proportion of Subjects With >30% Decrease in eGFR by Time Point 
A total of 18 subjects (10%) in each arm recorded a confirmed decrease of >30% from baseline in 
corrected eGFR during the study. More occurrences were reported during the second half of the 
treatment period (i.e., Week 24 onwards). The applicant states there were no notable differences 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 106/107 
 
 
 
 
 
between two treatment arms at any time point. However, it is noted that from week 16 onwards at 
each time point numerically more >30% decreases in eGFR were recorded in voclosporin compared to 
placebo. The total number of occurrences of >30% decrease in eGFR was 61 for voclosporin compared 
to 43 in placebo arm. 
Change from Baseline in UPCR by Time Point 
Mean UPCR at baseline (defined as the average of the last 2 pre-randomisation values) was similar for 
the two treatment arms: 4.14 mg/mg in the voclosporin arm and 3.87 mg/mg in the placebo arm. 
Decreases in mean UPCR were observed for both treatments Week 2. In the voclosporin arm, mean 
UPCR levels of less than 1.5 mg/mg were observed from Week 16 onwards, while in the placebo arm, 
levels reduced to around 2.5 mg/mg by Week 8 and continued to slowly decrease to approximately 2.0 
mg/mg by Week 42. The MMRM analysis confirmed that statistically significantly greater reductions 
from baseline in UPCR were achieved in the voclosporin arm compared with the placebo arm at every 
time point. The significant difference between treatments was also seen when using the more stringent 
baseline definition for UPCR of lowest available measurement prior to dosing. 
Figure 14 Mean (±95% CI) Change in UPCR (mg/mg) from Baseline by Visit (ITT Population) 
Change from Baseline in Urine Protein, Serum Creatinine and eGFR by Time Point 
Mean urine protein levels in the study were similar in both treatment arms at baseline (384 mg/dL  
and  379 mg/dL in  the  voclosporin  and  placebo  arms,  respectively). Changes in urine protein 
during the study reflected changes in UPCR; decreases in mean urine protein were observed in both 
arms with a difference between treatment arms observed around Week 2. 
Mean corrected eGFR values at baseline were similar in both arms (78.3 mL/min/1.73m2 in the 
voclosporin arm and 77.4 mL/min/1.73m2 in the placebo arm). At Week 2, the mean corrected eGFR 
had decreased slightly in the voclosporin arm while the mean value in the placebo arm showed a small 
increase. For the remainder of the study, mean levels followed a similar pattern in both arms, 
remaining relatively stable with a slight decrease across the second half of the study

Change from Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes 
Improvements (increases) in mean scores from baseline were seen in both treatment arms for the 
health-related quality of life assessments SF-36 and for the health-related domains of the LupusPRO 
assessment (HRQoL). Smaller changes were seen in both arms for the non-health-related domains of 
the LupusPRO assessment (N-HRQoL). There was no significant difference in the degree of 
improvement between the two treatments. 
Health Resource Utilisation 
Health resource utilisation was assessed based on the frequency of visits to health care providers and 
diagnostic tests (excluding study visits and assessments). There were no apparent differences between 
the two treatment arms in health resource utilisation at baseline or during the study. 
Dose changing during the study  
A summary of dose changing during the study is provided below. Dose modification of VCS/placebo 
was permitted for tolerability reasons. A specific schedule was implemented for dose reduction with 
regards to decrease in kidney function or increase in blood pressure (see 2.5.8. ).  
Table 43 Summary of Voclosporin/Placebo Dose Changes (Safety Population) 
In  most  subjects,  study  treatment  was  resumed  once  the  event  resulting  in  a  dose  
decrease/interruption had resolved. More subjects in the voclosporin arm than the placebo arm were 
restarted on 1 capsule (7.9 mg) or 2 capsules (15.8 mg) BID instead of the full dose of 3 capsules 
(23.7 mg) BID and stayed on this lower dose for the remainder of the study. At  the  end  of  the  
study,  42.9%  of  voclosporin  subjects  who  had  a  dose decrease/interruption were back on 23.7 
mg BID compared with 65.3% of placebo subjects.

Comparison and Analyses of Results Across Studies 
The LN ITT population of the integrated analysis comprises 268 subjects in the voclosporin 23.7 mg 
BID group and 266 subjects in the placebo group from studies AURORA-1 and AURA-LV. With the 
exception of one subject in the voclosporin arm, all randomised subjects were treated with at least one 
dose of study treatment (and thus included in the safety population).

Subjects randomised to placebo in ISA04-03 and ISA05-25 received placebo for 12 weeks and then 
were switched to 0.3 mg/kg BID voclosporin for the remainder of the trial. 
The AURORA 2 and ISA05-02 trials are not included as these are extension studies and subjects 
are 
already counted in the original trials (AURORA 1 and ISA04-03, respectively). 
2.5.5.4. Supportive study(ies) 
Data from the ongoing AURORA 2 continuation study, as of 01 April 2021 were initially provided. 
Study AUR-VCS-2016-02 (AURORA 2) is now completed and the final CSR, the CSP and the SAP have 
been provided, as well as all other documentation.  
Study Population and Disposition 
Subjects who completed 52 weeks of treatment in the AURORA 1 study were eligible to continue with 
their randomised treatment for up to a further 24 months in the AURORA 2 continuation study (i.e., up 
to 36 months total exposure). 
Of the 357 subjects who entered AURORA 1, a total of 216 subjects (60.5%) continued to receive 
blinded treatment beyond 12 months in the AURORA 2 study: 116/179 subjects (64.8%) from the 
voclosporin arm and 100/178 subjects (56.2%) from the placebo arm.  
Of the other 141 subjects who entered AURORA 1, 46 subjects withdrew prematurely from the study 
(15 from the voclosporin arm and 31 from the placebo arm), and 28 subjects in each arm who 
completed the AURORA 1 study had permanently discontinued study treatment and thus were not 
eligible to participate in AURORA 2. A further 18 subjects did not enter AURORA 2 for administrative 
reasons (such as health authority approval not received in time or a decision taken that the site or 
country would not participate) and 7 subjects did not give consent as they were planning a pregnancy 
or were moving out of the area. The reasons for non-participation for the remaining 14 subjects who 
were potentially eligible but did not enter AURORA 2 were not captured.

Table 51 Summary of Demographics for AURORA 1 Subjects Enrolled or Not Enrolled into AURORA 2 
(ITT) 
The two treatment arms in AURORA 2 were balanced with respect to SLE history and  
comorbidities. The mean time since SLE diagnosis was approximately 7 years (range <1 to 38 years), 
and the majority of subjects reported mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, and haematological  
involvement. As in the full AURORA 1 population, hypertension and hyperlipidemia were the most 
common comorbidities, affecting 69% and 48% of subjects, respectively, with the majority of  
cases considered related to SLE. 
The mean time since first proteinuria and mean time since LN diagnosis were slightly higher  
in subjects entering AURORA 2 (4.8 years and 4.9 years, respectively) than for the full  
AURORA 1 population (4.7 years and 4.6 years, respectively)

Figure 20 Subject Disposition – AURORA 2  
Table 54 Summary of study drug discontinuation in AURORA 2 
As in AURORA 1, decreases in eGFR and increases in blood pressure were managed by dose 
modifications per protocol guidance. Across the total treatment duration (up to 3 years), more subjects 
in the voclosporin arm than the placebo arm had their dose of study drug modified (decreased): 39.7% 
of voclosporin subjects recorded no dose changes compared with 58.0% of placebo subjects. The 
proportion of subjects with no dose changes increased year on year in the voclosporin arm, from 
55.2% in Year 1 to 78.4% in Year 3. In the placebo arm, 74% of subjects had no dose changes in Year 
1, rising to 87.1% in Year 3. In years 2 and 3 of treatment, 42.2% of voclosporin subjects and 25.0% 
of placebo subjects recorded dose decreases and a higher proportion of subjects in both treatment 
groups consistently received the target dose of 47.4 mg per day (49.1% and 69.0%, respectively) 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 124/125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were no notable differences in MMF or corticosteroid dosing between the two groups. The 
majority of dose changes in the voclosporin arm were due to changes in eGFR levels. 
The AURORA 2 protocol allowed the investigator to reduce the dose of voclosporin or placebo  
to 2 capsules BID after 24 months of treatment in a subject whose UPCR was well controlled  
In practice, few investigators acted upon this, and only 3 placebo subjects and 6 voclosporin subjects 
had their dose reduced at 2 years (12 month in AURORA 2) as permitted. Fewer subjects in the 
voclosporin arm (78.4%) than the placebo arm (91.0%) were taking the full dose of 3 capsules BID of 
study treatment at the end of AURORA 1. This proportion dropped in both arms over the next two 
years to 49.1% and 64%, respectively, at the end of the AURORA 2 study. 
The majority of subjects (at least 85% in each arm) were taking ≤2.5 mg/day prednisone (or  
equivalent) at the end of AURORA 1 (Month 12). Over the 2 years of the AURORA 2 study, this reduced 
slightly to approximately 80%, and at Month 36, 78% of placebo subjects and 76% of voclosporin 
subjects were on 2.5 mg or less per day.

Renal flares: 
The CEC adjudicated adequate renal response, renal flares and recovery of renal flares from  
the start of treatment in AURORA 1 for all 216 subjects who entered AURORA 2. In order to experience 
a renal flare, a patient must have achieved an adequate response to treatment as judged by the CEC. 
A sustained reduction in UPCR to ≤0.7 mg/mg was considered an adequate response, based on clinical 
judgement and allowing for small inherent fluctuations. A patient could experience a flare from the

point they achieved a response (or recovery). Renal flares were judged according to the following 
criteria:  
• A reproducible increase to UPCR >1 mg/mg from a post-response baseline of <0.2 mg/mg or  
• an increase to UPCR >2 mg/mg from a post-response baseline between 0.2 to 1.0 mg/mg or  
• a doubling of UPCR for baseline values of UPCR >1 mg/mg 
Table 56 Adjudicated renal flares (AURORA 1 and AURORA 2) 
The CEC adjudicated 4 placebo subjects and 5 voclosporin subjects as having severe renal  
flares. 
A further analysis was performed looking at the proportion of subjects who achieved an  
adequate response and did not have a renal flare. These subjects can be considered to have a  
positive renal outcome. Using these criteria, more voclosporin subjects than placebo subjects achieved 
a good outcome (66.4% vs 54.0%; OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32, 0.99; p=0.045)

Table 57 Adjudicated Good Renal Outcome (AURORA 1 and AURORA 2) 
AURION (AUR-VCS-2014-01) 
This study was an open label study conducted at 2 sites in Malaysia and enrolled 10 Asian, female 
subjects with LN. The subjects were aged between 23 and 36 years at the start of the study, with a 
median duration of LN of 5.5 years (range 2 to 12 years). Subjects received 23.7 mg BID for 48 weeks 
with a background therapy of MMF 2 g daily and IV and oral corticosteroids. Complete remission was 
achieved in a total of 7/10 (70.0%) subjects at Week 24 and 4/8 (50.0%) subjects at Week 48. 
Improvements from baseline in UPCR, urine protein, and serum albumin levels were observed across 
all visits, with median changes from baseline to Week 48 of -0.55 mg/mg, -0.09 g/L, and 3.0 g/L, 
respectively. However, also increases in serum creatinine levels from baseline were observed (median 
increase of 15.5 μmol/L to Week 48). The small sample size and lack of control group mean that it is 
not possible to draw firm conclusions from this study. 
2.5.6. Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
“Lupkynis is indicated in combination with background immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment 
of adult patients with class III, IV or V (including mixed class III/V and IV/V) lupus nephritis (LN).”

Four clinical studies are included for efficacy analysis in this application. Two phase 2 studies (AURION 
and AURA-LV), one pivotal phase 3 study (AURORA 1) and final results from the AURORA 1 
continuation study (AURORA 2).  
Dose selection 
Dose selection for the phase 2 AURA-LV study was based on previous experience with VCS in studies in 
healthy subjects and in other autoimmune indications (i.e., renal transplant, plaque psoriasis, and non-
infectious uveitis). In these autoimmune indications, subjects were administered VCS at doses ranging 
from 0.2 mg/kg BID to 0.8 mg/kg BID. In consideration of the efficacy and safety of VCS in these 
studies, doses equivalent to approximately 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg BID (low-dose) and 0.5 to 0.6 mg/kg BID 
(high-dose) were selected for the AURA-LV study, i.e., 23.7 mg BID (three capsules BID) and 39.5 mg 
BID (five capsules BID). 
AURA-LV was a phase II randomised controlled double-blind study comparing the Efficacy and Safety 
of two doses of Voclosporin (23.7 mg BID or 39.5 mg BID) with Placebo in Achieving renal remission in 
patients with Active Lupus Nephritis. The length of the study was 48 weeks with primary endpoint 
assessed at 24 weeks. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were in line with the pivotal phase 3 AURORA 1 
study (see below), with some minor difference that do not influence the ability to compare the result 
from the two studies. Study treatments were administered in 4 treatment arms: low-dose Voclosporin 
(3 capsules, 23.7 mg BID), low-dose placebo (3 capsules BID), high-dose Voclosporin (5 capsules, 
39.5 mg BID) and high dose placebo (5 capsules BID). Thus, there was no blinding regarding dose 
levels of active treatment (high vs low), only to placebo. All participants received background SoC with 
corticosteroids and MMF. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of subjects showing so called 
complete remission at Week 24 and secondary efficacy endpoints include complete remission at Week 
48. It should be noted that although the term “complete remission” was used for the primary 
composite endpoint in the AURA-LV study, it was similar to the endpoint “renal response” used in the 
AURORA-1 study. Lack of multiplicity adjustment in this study leads to an increased possibility of 
observing a statistically significant result purely by chance. 
A total of 265 subjects were randomised (88 to the placebo group (low/high placebo-dose combined), 
89 to the low-dose Voclosporin (23.7 mg BID) group, and 88 to the high-dose Voclosporin (39.5 mg 
BID) group. Of these, 223 (84.2%) subjects completed the study, 70 (79.5%) subjects in the placebo 
group, 73 (82.0%) in the low-dose VCS group, and 80 (90.9%) in the high-dose VCS group. A total of 
185 (69.8%) subjects completed 48 weeks of treatment with the study drug, with similar proportions 
in each treatment group. There were however more deaths in the low dose VSC group 10 (11.5%) 
compared with the high dose VCS group 2 (2.3%) and placebo 1 (1.1%). There were several notable 
differences in the composition of the treatment groups. More participants from Asia were randomised 
to the low dose VCS group and the low dose VCS group also consisted of patients with a longer disease 
duration and a more severe kidney disease at baseline. The low dose VSC group also had more 
haematological SLE involvement at baseline. Investigation of this difference revealed that there was a 
local imbalance in randomisation with subjects from low gross domestic product (GDP) countries 
(Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Philippines) over-represented in the 23.7 mg voclosporin arm: 47.2% of 
subjects in the 23.7 mg voclosporin group were recruited from low GDP countries compared with 
37.5% of subjects in the 39.5 mg group and 31.8% in the placebo group. This difference between the 
23.7 mg group and the placebo group was statistically significant (p=0.0365). It could be agreed that 
this could explain difference in other baseline characteristics and also the discrepancies in deaths seen 
between the groups. However, regarding the local imbalance in randomisation, the applicant was 
asked to provide further details on this issue, including a description of steps undertaken to minimise 
selection bias in AURA-LV study. The CHMP considered that the described processes appear robust, 
and the described steps seems adequate to minimize the risk of selection bias.

The AURA-LV study met its primary endpoint. At Week 24, complete remission was achieved by a 
higher proportion of subjects in both the low-dose (32.6%) and high-dose (27.3%) voclosporin groups 
compared to the placebo group (difference 19.3%, OR=2.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 4.05; p=0.045 low dose 
vs placebo). At Week 48, complete remission was achieved by a higher proportion of subjects in both 
the low-dose (49.4%) and high dose (39.8%) voclosporin groups compared to the placebo group 
(23.9%). There was no formal comparison between the two doses and no clear dose-response 
connection was apparent in the AURA-LV study, but slightly more AEs with the higher dose and thus 
the lower dose was chosen to the phase 3 AURORA-1 study. This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant received a Scientific Advise (EMEA/H/SA/3483/1/2017/SME/III) in March 2017. Some 
recommendations were incorporated in the pivotal study AURORA 1 (e.g primary efficacy endpoint at 
week 52 instead of 24, inclusion of UPCR ≤0.5 instead of ≤0.7 and agreement to run a continuation 
study for 24 months after completion of AURORA 1 to allow a further assessment of the sustained 
long-term effect of voclosporin under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions). However, there 
were also several points that diverged from the EMA advice, the major related to the definition of 
stable renal function in the composite primary endpoint “renal response”. This, and other deviation 
from the recommendation will be discussed later in the report.  
Pivotal Phase 3 study AURORA 1 
AURORA 1 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre, 
2-arm study of voclosporin versus matching placebo. Voclosporin at a dose of 23.7 mg BID or 
matching placebo were administered for 52 weeks with a background therapy of MMF and 
corticosteroids with a tapering schedule. The double blind, parallel group, randomised trial design with 
placebo given in add-on to standard of care therapy is in line with the EMA SLE/Lupus nephritis 
guideline. However, as pointed out in the GL, the 52-week trial design seems too short for the claimed 
indication “treatment”, which are supposed to include both induction and maintenance therapy. To 
address comments in the previous Scientific Advice (SA), the applicant agreed to conduct a double-
blind follow up study (AURORA 2), and initially an interim analysis from that study was provided. Study 
AUR-VCS-2016-02 (AURORA 2) is now completed and the final CSR, the CSP and the SAP have been 
provided, as well as all other documentation.  
Eligible subjects in the study were 18-75 years old with SLE and active, biopsy-proven lupus nephritis 
Class III, IV or V (or V in combination with III or IV). According to the GL, “active nephritis should be 
properly documented by increments in the total protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), the presence of 
sediment and/or a significant decrease in renal function”. It is noted that in the inclusion criteria, 
activity is only defined by the level of proteinuria (in relation to the biopsy results) with no requirement 
for significant decrease in renal function or presence of sediment. However, the patient should also be, 
in the opinion of the investigator, in need of high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressive 
therapy. Therefore, it could be agreed that the patient had active disease at baseline and upon request 
from the CHMP the applicant agreed to revise the wording of the indication to reflect that the 
treatment is indicated in LN patients with active disease. 
It is noted that the time period for a kidney biopsy prior to screening was extended from 6 months in 
AURA-LV to 2 years in the AURORA 1 study. To ensure active disease, subjects with a biopsy between 
6 months and 2 years prior to screening were additionally required to have had at least a 50% 
increase in UPCR within the last 6 months. In addition, data for any subject with a biopsy performed 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 129/130 
 
 
 
 
more than 6 months prior to screening were reviewed by the Medical Monitor to ensure eligibility for 
treatment with systemic immunosuppression. This approach is acceptable to CHMP. However, it should 
be noted that it is not uncommon for patients to switch from one biopsy class to another after 
treatment, making it difficult to fully classify this group.  
Voclosporin was orally administered at a dose of 23.7 mg BID given as three 7.9 mg soft gel capsules 
per dose for 52 weeks. Dose adjustments were allowed based on eGFR and blood pressure elevation. 
All patients received background therapy with corticosteroids and MMF. 
Corticosteroids were given intravenous 1 g Day 1 and/or Day 2 combined (0.5 g in subjects who 
weighed <45 kg) followed by 20 mg/day for subjects <45 kg and 25 mg/day for subjects ≥45 kg. The 
dose was reduced according to a protocol-specified tapering schedule. The aim was for all subjects to 
have their steroid dose reduced to 2.5 mg/day by the end of Week 16.  
Subjects with a lack of response were allowed one 4-week interval without dose reduction or one dose 
escalation to the previous dose for 2 weeks at any time during the study. Lack of response was defined 
as no or minimal change in UPCR per Investigator judgment over 3 visits or deterioration in UPCR not 
meeting the criteria for withdrawal. Additional information provided by the applicant upon CHMP 
request showed that there was no notable difference between dose groups in the proportion of 
subjects recording an increase in corticosteroid dose during the first 16 weeks of the trial (placebo: 
14.6% of subjects; voclosporin: 12.8% of subjects). No information regarding any dose escalation 
later in the study was provided; however, since >80 % of the patients were able to decrease their 
steroid doses to 2.5 mg/day or less at week 16, a small, short increase in corticosteroid dose would 
not have any major impact on the result. 
Subjects who were receiving MMF prior to randomisation continued without interruption. Subjects on 
azathioprine or mycophenolate sodium at screening were switched to MMF at baseline (Day 1). For 
subjects who were not already taking prescribed MMF prior to randomisation, the dosing of MMF 
started at 0.5 g BID for a total daily dose of 1 g/day for the first week, increasing to 1 g BID for a total 
daily dose of 2 g/day for the second and subsequent weeks (i.e., beginning on Day 8). Regarding the 
MMF dose, the applicant states “Approval by the Medical Monitor is required for subjects taking a dose 
other than 2 g/day MMF from randomization onwards (e.g., total daily dose of 1 or 3 g/day)”. 
However, it was unclear if a pre-defined criteria based on lack of response for increasing the dose of 
MMF to 3 g/d was defined, as suggested in the SA. Upon CHMP request, the applicant clarified that 
there were no predefined criteria for increasing the dose of MMF in AURORA 1 trial; investigators could 
adjust the MMF dose according to their professional judgement. However, the investigators were 
blinded and the overall exposure to MMF in g/day was comparable in both treatment arms (mean (SD) 
were 1.960 (0.3779) in placebo compared to 1.875 (0.4005) in voclosporin). Therefore, the CHMP 
concluded that the lack of a pre-defined criteria did not seem to impact study results.  
All patients received MMF as “background immunosuppressive therapies”, and no other 
immunosuppressive therapy were allowed. This was a major concern during the assessment that the 
risk of infections and nephrotoxicity could be elevated when combined with other 
immunosuppressants, especially cyclophosphamide. Thus, at the CHMP’s request, the applicant has 
submitted a revised product information and revised their claimed indication to combination with 
mycophenolate mofetil only.  
The primary endpoint renal response is a combined endpoint. To achieve the primary endpoint “renal 
response” the patient must have urine protein to creatine ration (UPCR) ≤0.5, an eGFR ≥60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 or no confirmed decrease from baseline in eGFR of >20% and not have received any 
rescue treatment or more than 10 mg prednisone for ≥3 consecutive days or for ≥7 days in total 
during Weeks 44-52. The primary endpoint is not fully in line with the EMA GL, especially with respect 
to the eGFR value used.  
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 130/131 
 
 
 
According to the EMA GL, “Studies conducted in patients with lupus nephritis should be aimed for the 
control of renal activity. It is expected that primary endpoints should be contextualised by reference to 
clinically meaningful values for major/complete response, such as normalisation/return to baseline of 
measured GFR or proteinuria of <0.5 g/24-h. A partial response, i.e. not full recovery but renal 
response able to maintain an eGFR within pre-specified margins with respect to baseline values, could 
only be accepted as primary endpoint if prospectively defined and relevance is well justified”.  
It should be noted that according to the applicant’s definition of stable renal function (an eGFR ≥60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 or no confirmed decrease from baseline in eGFR of >20%), a patient will be regarded 
as having a stable renal function even if the eGFR will drop from >90 to 61 or from 60 to 40. It is not 
fully clear why the applicant kept this definition, despite the strong recommendation against using it. 
In the EMA SA it was suggested using a stricter endpoint, not allowing a decrease of eGFR more than 
10-15% regardless of eGFR values. The applicant has however included this endpoint in 
complementary analysis 
The endpoint chosen by the applicant includes a strict definition regarding the amount of proteinuria 
allowed to be a responder (i.e UPCR ≤0.5). The CHMP considers that it is a clinically relevant 
measurement since a reduction in proteinuria to levels below 0.5-0.7 has been associated with 
improved renal survival. Also the key secondary endpoints reflect different aspects of reducing 
proteinuria. 
Considering the above and the fact that the presented results are considered as robust and are 
supporting a clinically relevant effect, this issue of the choice of the primary endpoint was not further 
pursued by the CHMP. 
The primary efficacy outcome was adjudicated, i.e., blinded data were reviewed by a Clinical Endpoints 
Committee (CEC), a group of external experts consisting of a chairperson along with two nephrologists 
and two rheumatologists. Each case was reviewed separately by one nephrologist and one 
rheumatologist, who each recorded their adjudicated outcome. The Chair then reviewed each case. 
Where the three outcomes were not unanimous, the CEC met to agree on the adjudicated outcome. 
The applicant provided additional information regarding this and disagreement within the CEC in 
adjudicating the primary outcome in AURORA 1 occurred in 16 cases. This amounts to approximately 
4.5% of the total randomised participants, which is a rather small proportion of all randomised 
participants. In the majority of cases, the final adjudication was that the subject had achieved renal 
response (12/16, i.e. 75%). In voclosporin arm 9/11 (≈82%) subjects were finally adjudicated as 
achieving response while in placebo arm 3/5 (=60%) subjects were finally adjudicated as achieving 
response. Due to small numbers (particularly in placebo arm), no conclusions can be made regarding 
this imbalance in positive adjudication.  
The five key secondary endpoints, renal response at week 24, partial renal response at week 52 and at 
week 24, time (days) to UPC of ≤5 and time (days) to 50 % reduction in UPCR from baseline all 
reflected aspects of the primary endpoint, where proteinuria is the main feature. It is acknowledged 
that the data in the scientific literature indicates that reduction in proteinuria at 12 months represents 
the best single predictor for long- term renal outcome (ie, risk for end- stage kidney disease (ESKD) or  
doubling of serum creatine after 10 years). Specifically, proteinuria reduction to 0.5- 0.7 g/day in 
response to treatment is associated with increased long-term kidney survival and is recommended as a 
treatment target in LN (2019 EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendation for the management for lupus 
nephritis). According to that recommendation, evidence of improvement in proteinuria (with GFR 
normalisation/stabilisation) should be noted by 3 months, and at least 50% reduction in proteinuria by 
6 months. Thus, the key secondary endpoints are considered relevant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 131/132 
 
 
 
Other endpoints evaluated duration of the response, change from baseline in serology, change from 
baseline in eGFR, SLE activity index and HRQoL parameters and also renal response in patients on low-
dose corticosteroids. However, to be in line with the GL and as pointed out in the SA, the incidence, 
severity, and type of renal flares throughout induction and maintenance phases should be assessed, 
and upon request the applicant provided this information, see further below in the report.  
The CHMP guideline (EMA/CHMP/51230/2013) states that “If patients with SLE are included, it should 
be ensured that any benefit in renal functioning is not offset by a deleterious effect on other organs. 
Therefore, this should be assessed either as a component of a co-primary endpoint or as a key 
secondary endpoint.” During the discussion meeting the applicant proposed “Change from baseline in 
the SELENA-SLEDAI Index score at Weeks 24 and 52” as a secondary endpoint. The SA recommended 
inclusion of the BILAG score as well; this advice was not followed. The applicant was asked to discuss 
measures taken to ensure that the benefit in renal functioning is not offset by a deleterious effect on 
other organs. The applicant confirmed that baseline non-renal SELENA-SLEDAI score was low, with a 
median score of 4 points, showing that the majority of subjects had few extrarenal symptoms. This 
was not unexpected since the inclusion criteria was based on LN symptoms and did not specify a 
minimum SELENA-SLEDAI score. Voclosporin treatment resulted in a difference from baseline of -3.4 in 
renal score and – 2.4 in non-renal score. In the placebo group, the difference from baseline were -2.8 
in renal score and -2.7 in non-renal score. No additional information with regards to different organ 
system were provided by the applicant; a more thorough evaluation of disease activity could have 
been gained if both indices (SELENA-SLEDAI and BILAG) had been used. However, although it could 
not be claimed that voclosporin does not have deleterious effects on other organs, in patients with 
active LN and little extrarenal activity, voclosporin did not seem to be associated with a worsening of 
other SLE symptoms, assessed with SELENA-SLEDAI score.  
One protocol amendment was made during the study with some changes regarding the timing of the 
primary endpoint. It was not clear why the endpoint “Proportion of subjects experiencing a 
confirmed >30% decrease from baseline in eGFR at each time point” were removed as a key 
secondary outcome and upon request the applicant clarified that the inclusion of this endpoint as a key 
secondary endpoint instead of an“ other” secondary endpoint was an error. The first statistical analysis 
plan and all subsequent versions of the SAP correctly included this endpoint as an “ other” secondary 
endpoint, thus this error does not evoke any further concerns.  
Statistical/methodological considerations 
The statistical considerations with regard to the planned analyses and study design were found to be 
acceptable. The sample sise estimation was informed by phase 2 outcomes. All statistical analyses 
were performed at study closure; there were no interim analyses planned and none was performed. 
Database lock has been reported to have occurred on 01 November 2019 and the submitted SAP 
(version 5.0) was dated 21 October 2019. The included SAP amendment history covered all SAP 
versions; most of the changes/clarifications and what seemingly were the most significant were 
implemented with version 2.0 (July 2018 and September 2018). There appears hence to have been 
two version 2.0. This raises no serious concern per se more than to add to other minor unclarities. 
Several of the SAP revisions pertained to “regulatory agency feedback”, they and others are overall 
supported. One exception, as discussed above, was the removal of one endpoint from the list of key 
secondary endpoints due to that it was not clear when or why. 
Multiplicity was accounted for by proceeding to secondary endpoints only if the principal analysis of the 
primary efficacy endpoint reached statistical significance at the 5% level. Key secondary outcomes 
were tested using the Hochberg step-up procedure to adjust for multiple comparisons and maintain the 
overall type 1 error rate of 5%.

The primary endpoint was a composite responder endpoint; for a subject to be classified as responder 
all components had to be achieved. Subjects lacking week 52 data were classified as non-responders. 
Upon request, the applicant clarified non-responder imputation was used for 14/179 (7.8%) and 
25/178 (14.0%) subjects in the voclosporin and placebo arm, respectively. For most non-responders, a 
subject’s status could be calculated owing to that sufficient data was available at week 52. 
The primary estimand was defined while the study was already ongoing (SAP version 3.0, March 
2019). Regarding the intercurrent events (IEs), a combination of a composite strategy (study 
discontinuation, intake of rescue medication and death) and a treatment policy strategy (treatment 
discontinuation for any reason) was applied; in case of the latter, expectations were that they were to 
remain in the study. From the table as requested summarising the distribution of intercurrent events 
by treatment arm, it is clear that more subjects in the placebo than in the voclosporin arm, 
discontinued study treatment, discontinued the study, and received rescue medication. Although, the 
differences between treatment arms were <10% irrespective of intercurrent event, their direction 
support voclosporin efficacy. 
Few subjects seemingly needed rescue medications with a not that dissimilar number of subjects 
comparing randomised arms; 24/178 (13.5%): placebo and 16/179 (8.9%): voclosporin. Being part of 
the primary endpoint definition, rescue use disqualified a subject from being a responder. Instead, it 
could have been considered to also handle intake of rescue medication using a treatment policy 
strategy. Upon request, an analysis ignoring intake of rescue medication and using available week 52 
data in the responder/non-responder decision was performed. The difference compared with the 
protocol-defined primary endpoint analysis was however small since most of those receiving rescue 
were shown to be non-responders for other reasons. Actually, it was only 2 subjects, both in the 
voclosporin arm, who switched from being a non-responder to being responder, rather strengthening 
the renal response outcome in favour of voclosporin (OR 2.72 (95% CI: 1.69, 4.36; p < 0.0001) 
compared with an OR of 2.65 for the protocol-defined primary endpoint). 
Several additional analyses of the primary endpoint were planned; a number of them for sensitivity 
purpose while others had been denoted supplementary. What regards the sensitivity analyses, they 
were rather performed to challenge the primary analysis model and, the supplementary analyses are 
considered more valuable for the understanding of the primary endpoint outcome. In addition, the 
planned Tipping point analysis is appreciated and is agreed to support the primary endpoint conclusion. 
Among the supplementary analyses were separate analyses of the primary endpoint components. As 
will be further discussed below, while the composite primary endpoint was statistically significant, the 
difference in favour of voclosporin versus placebo was driven by the difference in one component alone 
(UPCR). 
The supplementary analysis using the programmed counterpart of renal response week 52 supported 
the primary (adjudicated) although the difference between voclosporin and placebo was slightly 
decreased. Separate analyses of the primary endpoint components were performed also for the 
programmed renal response confirming the treatment difference based on the UCPR component, 
although it is noted that in this analysis there was also a difference regarding eGFR success contrary to 
the adjudicated response. Based on information in the SAP (added in version 2.0, July 2018), renal 
response week 24 was initially only to be derived programmatically. When it was decided that also the 
week 24 renal response was to be adjudicated by the CEC is unclear. There is, however, no objection 
to the adjudication per se, and analyses of both the adjudicated and programmed response were 
provided. Despite that the number of responder/non-responders were identical, the estimated 
treatment difference slightly differed. This was clarified by the applicant to pertain to that the 
individual responding subjects differed concerning a total of six subjects all in the voclosporin arm. The 
difference in subjects led to a different covariate pattern which explains the slightly different estimates.

Regarding the primary endpoint, the applicant was strongly recommended (CHMP scientific advice) to 
change the definition of stable renal function. This advice was not followed. Instead, a number of post-
hoc analyses were provided. These support the primary endpoint analysis although indicate that the 
voclosporin effect may be smaller. In the analysis using the strictest definition (confirmed % reduction 
in eGFR <10%), the estimated difference between treatment arms was decreased but was still 
nominally statistically significant. This should be explained by that the impact of the eGFR component 
on the overall outcome was small.  
Subgroup analyses largely support internal consistency.  
The submitted AURORA 1 CEC Charter was version Draft V2 dated 03 July 2019. The changes made 
compared to any earlier version or, why there seemingly did not exist a final version was not clear. 
According to the charter, CEC was to review blinded data for individually completed subjects on an 
ongoing basis. The applicant clarified that renal response was to be reviewed once a subject had 
completed the study. This was expected to occur between July 2019 and the database lock in 
November 2019, but as has been explained, the actual CEC review did not start before mid-October. 
With this clarification along with the confirmation that the CEC charter dated 03 Jul 2019 is the final 
version, the concern that CEC adjudications could have been performed based on different documented 
instructions and patient data has been alleviated. 
It was recommended (CHMP scientific advice) that the incidence of renal flares should be assessed. 
According to the applicant, renal flares was to be addressed as part of the final analysis of the long-
term AURORA 2 study. (AUR-VCS-2016-02). AURORA 2 was still ongoing at the time of the submission 
but was expected to complete in October 2021. Neither the CSP nor the SAP had been submitted. 
Eligible to enter AURORA 2 was subjects who completed AURORA 1 while still on study drug. AURORA 
2 implied that subjects could continue on randomised treatment for an additional 24 months. AURORA 
2 is now completed and the final CSR, the CSP and the SAP, as well as all other documentation, have 
been provided. According to the SAP, interim analyses were planned to enable that authorities could be 
provided with the most up to date information available. This is acknowledged. According to the SAP, 
timing of the interim analyses ranged from 3 months post the final subject final visit of the AURORA 1 
study up to 6 months prior to the end of AURORA 2, i.e., when the last subject had reached Month 30. 
The latter time-point being in line with the data cut 01 April 2021 used for the reporting of outcomes 
provided with the initial submission. However, the submitted SAP (version 1.0) was dated 11 May 
2021, i.e., after the above-mentioned data cut. To potentially mitigate any concerns regarding 
unplanned analyses it has been stated that the proposed analyses were based on the contents of the 
final version of the protocol (Amendment 2, dated 21 Dec 2018). However, according to the CSP, there 
was to be one unblinded, interim analysis expected to occur 3 months post the final subject final visit 
of the AURORA 1 study. Thereby is the SAP wording considered to be a post-construction. No 
randomisation was performed in this study and the sample sise was decided by the number of AURORA 
1 subjects eligible and willing to continue. Efficacy was a secondary objective and there was no type I 
error control. Further, it is unavoidable that there has been a selection of subjects entering and 
thereby that AURORA 2 does no longer offer a truly randomised comparison and thus, efficacy data can 
at most be viewed as descriptive. A total of 216 subjects entered the AURORA 2 study: 116/179 
subjects (64.8%) from the voclosporin arm and 100/178 subjects (56.2%) from the placebo arm 
whereof a similar proportion of subjects in the two arms completed the study: 85.0% (85/100) 
(placebo) and 87.1% (101/116) (voclosporin). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 357 eligible subjects were randomised into the study AURORA 1: 178 to the placebo arm and 
179 to the voclosporin arm. Overall, 309 subjects (86.6%) completed the study, with more subjects in 
the voclosporin arm (162 subjects [90.5%]) than the placebo arm (147 subjects [82.6%]) reaching

Week 52. More subjects withdrew from the placebo arm (17.4%) than the voclosporin arm (8.9%). 
The most common reason for early withdrawal from the study was withdrawal of consent which 
accounted for nearly half of all withdrawals in both arms. Study treatment was discontinued in 59 
subjects (33.1%) in the placebo arm and 43 subjects (24.0%) in the voclosporin arm. The most 
common reason for study treatment discontinuation was intolerable AE. 
The demographic characteristics of subjects in the study were balanced across the two treatment arms 
and representative for the population intended for the indication. The mean age was 33 years (range 
18 to 72 years) and the majority of subjects were female (87.7%). Most participant were white 
(36.1%) or Asian (30.5%), only 9.5% were black. The mean time since SLE diagnosis was  6.7 years 
(range <1 to 38 years), and the majority of  subjects reported mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, and 
haematological involvement. Mean time since diagnosis of LN was just under 5 years (range <1 to 28 
years) in both groups and only 3 subjects in each arm had previously received dialysis. In both 
populations mean and median UPCR was > 3 mg/mg at baseline and mean and median eGFR values 
were > 90 (range 25 to 136) suggesting a patient population with nearly nephrotic range proteinuria 
but with rather preserved kidney function. Although the range of the values at baseline includes values 
not allowed for inclusion (e.g eGFR <45) the applicant states that all subjects met the eligibility criteria 
for UPCR and eGFR levels at screening. The applicant clarified that if a subject had eGFR > 45 at 
screening but was then found to have eGFR of ≤ 45 at baseline, the subject was still eligible to remain 
in the trial. All subjects had to demonstrate at least one eGFR value of > 45 to be eligible for trial 
entry. Approximately 5% of subjects in each group recorded a minimum baseline eGFR of < 45 prior to 
the first dose of study treatment. This is acceptable.  
Given that the median number of years since diagnosis of LN was 2 years, half of the included study 
population was diagnosed within 2 years prior to enrolment. As the likelihood of successful initial 
outcome is greater if therapy for LN is started early in the course of the disease, inclusion of relatively 
recently diagnosed subjects might result in more favourable outcomes compared to the general LN 
population. Upon request the applicant provided a post-hoc analysis showing that the benefit of 
voclosporin treatment compared to placebo seems to be greater in patients diagnosed with LN within 2 
years of enrolment compared to patients diagnosed with LN more than 2 years of enrolment. However, 
a larger proportion of responders treated with voclosporin compared to placebo is observed even for 
patients diagnosed with LN more than 2 years of enrolment (29.8% vs 18.4%, respectively). Adequate 
information regarding the mean and median duration of LN in AURORA-1 population (alongside other 
main characteristics of the studied population) is included in the SmPC 5.1.  
The most common kidney biopsy class was pure Class IV (77 [43.3%] of placebo subjects and 91 
[50.8%] of voclosporin subjects); 25 subjects (14.0%) in each arm were recorded as having pure 
Class V LN. Around 25% in both groups had a combined pattern of Class V + III or IV.  
A total of 39 subjects (11%) had a biopsy more than 6 months prior to screening; of these subjects, 
the majority had a biopsy between 6 and 12 months prior with 12 (3%) having a biopsy more than 12 
months prior to screening. The timing of biopsies taken more than 6 months prior to screening was 
balanced between treatment groups). Thus, any misclassification regarding biopsy class in this group 
are not supposed to affect the results.  
Almost all patients had received previous treatments for LN (taken at any time prior to first dose of 
study treatment) and these treatments were well balanced across the treatment arms. The most 
common previous LN treatments in both groups were corticosteroids, antimalarials and MMF, which 
were taken by 94%, 67% and 63%, respectively, of all subjects. Cyclophosphamide and Azathioprine 
were taken by 34.6% and 30.1%, respectively. It was not clear whether there were any treatment 
naïve patients (patients who never had received any treatment for a LN flare) included in the study. It 
also not clear whether the patients included in the study had a previous response with Soc treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 135/136 
 
 
 
and then relapsed, or if they never received a response on SoC treatment (i.e. refractory patients). 
Upon CHMP request, the applicant clarified that data on subjects’ responses or relapses with prior LN 
treatments were not collected in the study. In addition, only a few patients (4 subjects in the placebo 
arm and 3 subjects in the voclosporin arm) recorded no previous treatment for LN, although the 
applicant’s definition of treatment naïve seems stricter than necessary, excluding patients on 
antimalarials and methotrexate. The numbers are too small to draw any conclusion regarding efficacy 
in this group. One may argue that the lack of data on treatment naïve patients could imply that 
Lupkynis should be used as second line therapy on top of SoC in patients who failed to achieve a 
response with SoC treatment only. However, the treatment is intended for active LN in combination 
with SoC (MMF), and it is anticipated that a response, with decrease of proteinuria and a similar safety 
profile will be achieved also when treating a first active LN episode. At CHMP’s request, information 
regarding previous LN treatment (Cyclophosphamide, MMF) and the small number of treatment naïve 
patients has been included in the SmPC. 
Additional information provided by the applicant assured that treatment  groups  were  well  balanced 
with  regards  to  use of important concomitant medications at study start also in respect of doses of 
corticosteroids and MMF. The only exception is a slightly higher proportion of patients on calcium 
channel blocker in the placebo group (around 33% vs 22%) but this is not expected to have any 
important impact on the results. 
Also, upon request, concomitant medications taken after study commencement were presented cut-off 
of ≥2% subjects instead of a cut-off of ≥10%. The most common concomitant medications started or 
subjected to a dose change during the trial were antihypertensive medications. Other concomitant 
medications in reflect the higher incidence of infections, gastrointestinal disorders, cough, and anaemia 
seen in the voclosporin arm than the placebo arm.  
Efficacy analysis: The proportion of subjects achieving renal response was significantly higher in the 
voclosporin arm than in the placebo arm (40.8% vs 22.5%). The odds of responding were 2.65 times 
greater for subjects treated with voclosporin than placebo (OR 2.65; 95% CI: 1.64, 4.27; p<0.001). 
The absolute risk reduction observed with voclosporin is 18.3%. The results of the primary efficacy 
analysis are both statistically significant and clinically relevant. 
Similar results were seen for supplementary analyses i.e., for the PP population, programmed renal 
response and for sensitivity analyses including only a term for treatment and omitting the regional 
covariate. A tipping point analyses showed that if all voclosporin withdrawals were truly non-
responders, 65% of placebo assumed non-responders would have to be truly responders in order for 
statistical significance to be lost. The applicant concludes that this is an unlikely scenario given the 
observed placebo response was 22.5%, and this conclusion is supported. 
However, when analysing the different components included in the combined endpoint “renal response” 
(UPCR ≤0.5 mg/mg, eGFR success, no rescue medication and not more than 10 mg prednisone during 
Weeks 44-52), it is clear that the main component driving the response is the reduction of proteinuria. 
No significant differences between Voclosporin and Placebo were seen in the other components. For 
UPCR≤0.5 mg/mg, the response was 23% in the placebo group and 45.3% in the voclosporin group 
(OR 3.11, CI 1.99, 5.0 p<0.001). For eGFR success the response was 75.8 % in the placebo group and 
82.1 % in the voclosporin group (OR 1.50, CI 0.89, 2.52, p=0.129). Rescue medications were given to 
13.5% in the placebo group and 8.9% in the voclosporin group and only 14.6% in the placebo group 
and 12.8% in the voclosporin group did receive steroids above 10 mg during the last 8 weeks before 
week 52.  
Reducing proteinuria is important in the treatment of lupus nephritis, since sustained proteinuria is 
associated with a worse prognosis, however the main goal is still to prevent kidney damage and in the 
end kidney failure. Thus, it is crucial that the beneficial effect seen in renal response regarding 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 136/137 
 
 
 
proteinuria is not counterbalanced by a detrimental effect in eGFR. It is noted that a patient could be a 
responder with an eGFR≤60 and a decrease of >20% if there was a non-treatment related AE in close 
relation to the measured value that could affect the eGFR. Only a few patients were responders in 
relation to that criterion (6 patients in the placebo group and 7 patients in the voclosporin group). 
Upon request, the applicant provided additional information regarding this topic that did not evoke any 
further concerns.  
The applicant has also provided some complementary analysis with stricter eGFR definition of stable 
renal function. When “no confirmed decrease from baseline of >10% in corrected eGFR” were used, 
62/179 (34.6%) in the voclosporin group and 38/178 (21.3%) in the placebo group achieved a renal 
response (OR 2.11 CI 1.3, 3.43, p=0.0026). This is reassuring, but it is noticed that the response in 
the voclosporin group seems to be affected more (contributing to a lesser response) than the placebo 
group with this stricter definition. To evaluate the contribution of this stricter definition to the total 
score, the applicant provided some additional information which showed, as expected, that a decrease 
in GFR was apparent in more patient treated with Voclosporin, than patients with SoC treatment. This 
is further discussed in the safety section (see 2.5.8. ). 
Consistent with the primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects achieving the key secondary 
outcomes were all in favour of voclosporin. Adjudicated renal response at Week 24 was significantly 
higher in the voclosporin arm than the placebo arm (32.4% vs 19.7%; OR 2.23; 95% CI: 1.34, 3.72; 
p=0.002). This result is in line with the results from the AURA LV study, where renal response at week 
24 was the primary endpoint (32.6% vs 19.3%, OR=2.03; 95% CI: 1.01, 4.05; p=0.045). More 
subjects in the voclosporin arm achieved a partial renal response (defined as a 50% reduction from 
baseline in UPCR) at Week 24 and Week 52. In the majority of subjects who responded, partial renal 
response was achieved already at week 24. Of the subjects who achieved a partial response at Week 
24, a higher proportion of subjects in the voclosporin group than in the placebo group were 
adjudicated to have a renal response at Week 52 (52.4% vs 39.3%). In addition, of the patients who 
did not achieve a renal or partial response at week 24, a numerical higher proportion of patients in 
voclosporin group than placebo group achieved a partial or renal response at week 52 (around 40% vs 
28%). Upon CHMP request, the applicant also provided information that verified that, due to the wide 
individual fluctuation, it would be difficult to set a cut-off value for UPCR at 12- or 24-weeks which 
would accurately identify subjects who will not benefit with continued treatment. Thus, no additional 
stopping rules are suggested and decision to continue treatment beyond Week 24 in patients who may 
not have experienced a notable improvement in their disease after 6 months of treatment, are left to 
the treating physician’s judgement. This gives support for continuing treatment also in patients who do 
not fully respond at week 24 and since no additional stopping rules were identified (such as level of 
proteinuria), the decision to continue treatment beyond Week 24 in patients who may not have 
experienced a notable improvement in their disease after 6 months of treatment, are left to the 
treating physician’s judgement.  
The time to UPCR ≤0.5 mg/mg was also significantly shorter for voclosporin treatment (median time: 
169 days vs 372 days for placebo treatment; HR 2.02; 95% CI: 1.51, 2.70; p<0.001). Also, the time 
taken to reach a 50% reduction in UPCR was significantly shorter for the voclosporin arm than the 
placebo arm ( HR 2.05; 95% CI: 1.62, 2.60; p<0.001). Median time to 50% reduction in UPCR was 29 
days for voclosporin versus 63 days for placebo. These results confirms that voclosporin together with 
MMF + corticosteroid reduce proteinuria faster and more effectively (i.e to a lower level) than MMF+ 
corticosteroids alone.  
Almost half of the patients who achieved UPCR <0.5 in both groups had a secondary occurrence of 
UPCR > 0.5 (47.4 % in the placebo group and 45.7% in the voclosporin group). This implies that the 
reduction of proteinuria may not sustain for a significant number of patients. In addition, a total of 18 
subjects (10%) in each arm recorded a confirmed decrease of >30% from baseline in corrected eGFR 
Assessment report

during the study. More occurrences were reported during the second half of the treatment period. Both 
these finding could imply a progression/relapse in disease activity with a similar number in both 
treatment group. Upon request additional information were provided by the applicant, including the 
final report of the AURORA 2 study. The proportions of subjects with a second occurrence of UPCR > 
0.5 were derived programmatically based on any incursion above 0.5 (including values of 0.51) and as 
the applicant points out, such fluctuations in UPCR are expected, and do not necessarily indicate that 
the reductions in proteinuria are not sustained or that all these subjects relapsed. Based on data from 
the AURORA 2 study, the difference between the arms in the proportion of subjects with UPCR < 0.5 
seems to be maintained across a further 2 years. In the AURORA 1 trial, 72.6% of subjects in the 
voclosporin arm achieved an adequate response (i.e a reduction in UPCR to ≤ 0.7 mg/mg) compared 
with 51.1% of subjects in the placebo arm. The incidence of renal flares in the responders were 10% in 
the voclosporin arm and 19.8% the placebo arm. For those patients who continued to AURORA 2 a 
similar proportion in both arms were adjudicated as having a renal flare (placebo 26.0%, voclosporin 
23.8%) and 4 placebo subjects and 5 voclosporin subjects were considered to have severe renal flare. 
Thus, the frequency of flares did not seem to differ between the two groups, and it is noted that no 
definition with respect to mild, moderate or severe flares were provided. A good renal outcome, based 
on adequate renal response (UPCR ≤0.7) and no renal flare, was achieved by 66.4% of subjects 
treated with voclosporin compared with 54.0% of placebo subjects indicating a beneficial efficacy of 
voclosporin over placebo also in a longer perspective. This is reassuring to the CHMP even though, as 
stated above, efficacy data from Aurora 2 can at most be viewed as descriptive.  
Mean corrected eGFR values at baseline were similar in both arms (78.3 mL/min/1.73m2 in the 
voclosporin arm and 77.4 mL/min/1.73m2 in the placebo arm). At Week 2, the mean corrected eGFR 
had decreased slightly in the voclosporin arm while the mean value in the placebo arm instead showed 
a small increase. 
A >30% decrease in eGFR was reported for each time point. A total of 18 subjects (10%) in each arm 
recorded a confirmed decrease of >30% from baseline in the AUrORA-1 study . The applicant states 
there were no notable differences between two treatment arms at any time point. However, this 
statement is not agreed as from week 16 onwards at each time point numerically more >30% 
decreases in eGFR were recorded in voclosporin compared to placebo. The total number of occurrences 
of >30% decrease in eGFR was 61 for voclosporin compared to 43 in placebo arm. Given that the total 
number of subjects experiencing these decreases is the same both treatment arms, these findings may 
suggest a more protracted pattern of >30% decreases in eGFR in voclosporin compared to the placebo 
arm. The effect on eGFR is thoroughly discussed in the safety section (see 2.5.8. ). 
A reduction of the SELENA/SLEDAI index score and improvement of HRQoL were seen in both groups 
but there was no difference between the treatment groups. There were no apparent differences 
between the two treatment arms in health resource utilisation at baseline or during the study. 
The study protocol requested a rather fast corticosteroid tapering schedule with a reduction to ≤2.5 
mg at week 16. A majority of the patients in both groups were able to reduce their steroids to these 
levels (81.1% in the voclosporin group and 80.7% in the placebo group). In addition, 74.7% of the 
voclosporin group and 73.5% of the placebo group were still on that dose at week 52. Taken into 
account the adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid treatment it is an important finding that the 
renal response at week 52 in patients with a low corticosteroid dose were also favouring voclosporin, 
with a response of 35.8% in the voclosporin group and 20.2% in the placebo group. Corticosteroid 
duration of exposure and mg/day exposure were similar in the groups with slightly lower corticosteroid 
dose in the voclosporin group. The mean cumulative oral steroid dose across the whole 12 months was 
slightly higher for the placebo arm (2549 mg) than the voclosporin arm (2374 mg). 
Assessment report

A dose reduction or temporary interruption of treatment drug was done for slightly over half of the 
patients in the Voclosporin group (51.1%) and for 27.5% of the placebo patients. In most subjects, 
study treatment was resumed once the event resulting in a dose decrease/interruption had resolved. 
In the Voclosporin group, 57.2% of the patients did not resume to the full dose (28.6% stayed on 7.9 
mg and 28.6% stayed on 15.8 mg). It was not clear whether these patients still achieved a renal 
response, and the applicant was asked to present renal response in this subpopulation. In subjects 
with no dose decreases, the response rate in the voclosporin arm was twice that in the placebo arm 
(around 46% vs 23% ). Similar response rates were observed in subjects who finished the trial on the 
full dose of three capsules BID after a dose decrease or interruption (41% vs 22%). The response 
rates were lower in voclosporin subjects who ended the trial on 2 capsules (9/26, 34%) or 1 capsule 
(7/26, 27%) BID. Thus, a temporary decrease in dose does not seems to affect the results, but for the 
patients that continued with a lower dose, efficacy is reduced, although a response is still seen in some 
of the patients.  
A treatment benefit of voclosporin was also seen across all pre specified subgroups. Especially in the 
patients who were already on MMF, Voclosporin seems to provide a robust renal response. This 
indicates a good efficacy in patients with a flare despite MMF. It is however unclear whether these 
patients had failed MMF therapy or if the patients suffered a renal flare responsive to MMF (i.e., not 
responding vs. responding to higher MMF dosage). The applicant was asked to clarify, however data on 
subjects’ responses or relapses with prior MMF treatments were not collected in the study. There are 
some discrepancies between efficacy outcome in the subgroups with MMF at baseline or without MMF 
at baseline in the AURA-LV study and the AURORA-1 study and additional information regarding this 
was requested during the assessment. The applicant states that random variation was the only 
explanation for the differences seen in response rate between the groups in the two studies. This was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Regarding the subgroups, the 95% CI of OR for voclosporin vs placebo crosses the line of null effect in 
several subgroups (White, pure Class V, Europe + South Africa, North America, no MMF at screening 
and maximum MMF dose >2 g). The sise of some of those subgroups (pure Class V, North America, 
maximum MMF dose >2 g) is small, providing a possible explanation for level of uncertainty around the 
effect sise. However, the sise of subgroups White, Europe + South Africa and no MMF at screening is 
considerable and the 95%CI is not very wide. Therefore, subgroup sise seems unlikely to be the only 
explanation for the 95% CI crossing the value of no difference between treatments in subgroups 
White, Europe + South Africa and no MMF at screening. Upon CHMP request, the applicant provided 
additional explanations and concluded that a high placebo response rate was observed in the selected 
subgroups, while the response to voclosporin was similar to that in the overall population. The CHMP 
concluded that a treatment benefit of voclosporin was seen across all pre-specified subgroups, 
including black participants, males and participants with Class V LN in the pivotal study. 
Upon request, the applicant provided the final protocol from the AURORA 2 study. The proportion of 
patients in renal response month 36 among those who continued in AURORA 2 was 51% (59/116) in 
the voclosporin group and 39% (39/100) in the placebo group. When including the whole ITT-
population from AURORA 1, the proportion of patients in renal response month 36 (AURORA 1 and 
AURORA 2) was 33% (59/179) in the voclosporin group and 22% (39/178) in the placebo group. 
At the start of AURORA 2, 34/100 (34%) placebo subjects and 61/116 (52.6%) voclosporin subjects 
were in renal response. At month 36, 22/34 (64.7%) of the placebo subjects and 44/61 (72.1%) 
voclosporin subjects were still in renal response, indicating sustained remission for the majority of the 
patients in both groups. For patients with partial renal response, around 50% of the patients achieved 
a renal response at week 36 in both groups.

A description regarding the AURORA 2 study is considered informative for the prescriber to be included 
in the SmPC. 
2.5.7. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
AURA-LV was a phase II randomised controlled double-blind study comparing the Efficacy and Safety 
of two doses of Voclosporin (23.7 mg BID or 39.5 mg BID) with Placebo in Achieving renal remission in 
patients with Active Lupus Nephritis. The AURA-LV study met its primary endpoint. There was no 
formal comparison between the two doses and no clear dose-response connection was apparent in the 
AURA-LV study, but slightly more AEs with the higher dose. Hence, the lower dose (23.7 mg BID) was 
chosen to the phase 3 AURORA-1 study. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The pivotal study AURORA 1 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo 
controlled, multicenter, 2 arm study of voclosporin versus matching placebo. Voclosporin at a dose of 
23.7 mg BID or matching placebo were administered for 52 weeks with a background therapy of MMF 
and corticosteroids with a tapering schedule. 
Patients that completed the AURORA 1 study could continue in a 2-year continuation study (AURORA 
2). 
A better response for Voclosporin was seen in the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoint, 
suggesting that voclosporin, together with MMF + corticosteroid, reduces proteinuria faster and more 
effectively (i.e. to a lower level) than MMF+ corticosteroids alone.  
The study protocol requested a rather fast corticosteroid tapering schedule with a reduction to ≤2.5 mg 
at week 16. A majority of the patients in both groups were able to reduce their steroids to these levels. 
Taken into account the well-known adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid treatment, it is an 
important finding that the rate of renal response at week 52 in patients with a low corticosteroid dose 
were also favouring voclosporin. 
At the CHMP’s request, the applicant accepted to revised their claimed indication to reflect that the 
treatment is indicated in LN patients with active disease and that voclosporin should only be used in 
combination with combination with mycophenolate mofetil as all patients in AURORA 1 received MMF 
as “background immunosuppressive therapies”, and no other immunosuppressive therapy were 
allowed.  
The CHMP concluded that the data submitted supported the following dosing recommendations and 
indication: 
“Lupkynis is indicated in combination with mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of adult patients 
with active class III, IV or V (including mixed class III/V and IV/V) lupus nephritis (LN).” 
The recommended dose is 23.7 mg (three 7.9 mg soft capsules), twice daily. 
2.5.8. Clinical safety 
Voclosporin, a novel calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), is according to the applicant structurally similar to 
cyclosporine A (CsA) except for a modification to the amino acid-1 region. According to the applicant, 
this alteration has changed the binding of voclosporin to calcineurin, increasing the potency by 2- to 4-
fold compared to CsA, and has shifted metabolism away from amino acid-1, the major site of 
metabolism for CsA, thus altering the metabolic profile.  
Increased blood pressure and acute renal vasomotor effects are well-known potential toxicities of CNIs 
that are dose-related, reversible, and responsive to dose reduction or temporary interruption of

treatment [Wiseman 2016]. Other adverse effects associated with current CNIs include neurotoxicity 
(psychosis, speech apraxia, dysesthesias, anxiety, sleep disturbances, reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome), electrolyte disturbances, impaired glucose tolerance and new-onset 
diabetes mellitus, and, like all immunosuppressants, infections and malignancies [Sketris 1995]. 
2.5.8.1. Patient exposure 
The application included safety data from 2,666 subjects exposed to voclosporin (any dose or duration) 
in clinical trials. The number of subjects with LN who have been exposed to voclosporin (any dose or 
duration) is 365 (Table 58-Table 59).

Placebo control subjects for the high-dose (5 capsules BID) arm in AURA-LV. 
Days on treatment calculated as the sum of all prescription record durations up to the last non-zero prescribing record. 
Subjects who attended the Week 52 visit after the protocol-specified window of Day 364±10 days; subjects with 365 to 374 days of 
study treatment are counted in the category of >9 to 12 months because this is within the visit window. 
Notes:  BID = twice daily; IQR = interquartile range; SD = standard deviation. 
Within the pooled LN population, the mean daily dose of voclosporin was higher in the AURORA 1 study 
(41.3 mg) compared with the AURA-LV study (34.6 mg). The guidance for dose modification or 
interruption was similar between the AURA-LV and AURORA 1 study protocols; however, a more 
cautious approach was used in the AURA-LV study given that it was conducted earlier in the LN 
development programme, with less safety information available. In AURA-LV, dose reductions were 
implemented based on a fixed percentage decrease from baseline (even if eGFR continued to be 
normal) and there was greater caution for returning to or near the prescribed study treatment dosing 
regimen.

Table 62 Summary of demographics for AURORA 1 subjects enrolled or not enrolled into AURORA 2 
(ITT) 
AURA-LV study (39.5 mg BID arm): There was local imbalance in randomisation between the 
treatment groups with respect to region (47.2% of subjects of the 23.7 mg BID voclosporin group was 
from low-GDP countries compared to 37.5% in 39.5 mg BID voclosporin and 31.8% in placebo group), 
which reflected with poorer safety outcomes in the 23.7 mg BID group. 
AURION study: Contrary to other LN studies, all included subjects were female. 
Renal Transplant Study 
The subjects were primarily Caucasian (61.9%) and male (66.1%) with a median age of 46 to 50 years 
and received de novo kidney transplants within 24 hours prior to randomisation into the study with a 
history of dialysis for median duration of 19 to 23 months.  
Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
In the 13 Phase 1 studies were included healthy volunteers, primarily young (ranging from 18 to 45 
years), majority Caucasians in most of these studies. 
Subjects in the Phase 1 studies of renal or hepatic impairment were older compared to LN population 
(mean age of 62 years and 50 years) and majority were Caucasian. More males than females were 
included in the study of hepatic impairment. 
SLE subjects were aged between 26 and 65 years (30% had history of LN) and most subjects were 
white and female.

2.5.8.2. Adverse events 
This section presents the analysis of AEs and TEAEs in the pooled LN population, which includes 
subjects who were treated with placebo or voclosporin 23.7 mg BID for up to 12 months in the AURA-
LV or AURORA 1 studies. Final results from the AURORA 2 study are also presented. 
Overview of adverse events 
The incidence of AEs in the pooled LN safety population is summarised in Table 63.  
The following definition of treatment-emergent was used: 
•  Any AE that had an onset on or after the first dose of study drug within a given regimen up to 
30 days following the last dose of study drug within the regimen. 
• 
For subjects who moved into the continuation study on the same active treatment (i.e., from 
AURORA 1 to AURORA 2), the 30-day window after last dose was reduced to end of day prior 
to the start of the continuation study. 
TEAEs leading to dose modification occurred more often in voclosporin-treated subjects (46%) than 
placebo-treated subjects (25%) (Table 63). However, the incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent 
study drug discontinuation was similar between placebo and voclosporin treatment groups (13.2% vs 
13.5%). Treatment-related TEAEs leading to dose modification or permanent study drug 
discontinuation occurred in more voclosporin-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects (dose 
modification: 28% vs 7%; permanent discontinuation: 7.5% vs 2.6). The study protocols included 
close monitoring of eGFR with prespecified guidance for dose modification or temporary interruption in 
the event of eGFR decreases; therefore, dose modification was not unexpected in these study groups.

In the pooled LN safety population (N=533), Infections and Infestations were the most frequently 
reported types of TEAEs and occurred in more voclosporin subjects (62.2%) than placebo-treated 
subjects (54.9%). Gastrointestinal (GI) Disorders were the second-most frequent type of TEAEs, 
reported in 45.3% and 35.3% of voclosporin and placebo subjects, respectively. While there was a 
higher incidence of GI Disorders in the voclosporin group, gastrointestinal events are also expected 
with MMF therapy.

drug were prepared based on the pooled LN (N=533) and AURORA 2 (N=216) populations. 
Acute renal failure 
Overall, in the pooled LN population, 33.3% of voclosporin-treated subjects compared with 17.7% of 
placebo-treated subjects experienced a TEAE in this SMQ during the first year of study treatment, but 
the majority of these subjects had GFR decreases (26.2% in the voclosporin group and 9.4% in the 
placebo group) that were managed effectively with dose interruption or modification.

According to the applicant, in summary, the majority of the TEAEs identified using the Acute Renal 
Failure SMQ appear to be related to the small, transient, pharmacological effect of voclosporin on eGFR 
that resolves following dose reduction or interruption, or were due to underlying disease, and do not 
indicate a clinically meaningful acute adverse effect of voclosporin on the kidney.  
In response to day 120 LoQ, the applicant also presented long-term renal data from the AURORA 2 
trial: 
Acute Renal Failure and Chronic Kidney Disease in the Long-Term AURORA 2 Trial 
Overall, the proportion of subjects in AURORA 2 who experienced acute renal failure events (defined 
using SMQ20000003) or CKD events (defined using SMQ20000213) and including eGFR decreases was 
27.6% in the voclosporin group and 17.0% in the placebo group. Excluding eGFR decreases, 18.1% of 
voclosporin treated subjects and 12.0% of placebo subjects had a TEAE in the acute renal failure SMQ 
and the CKD SMQ. The proportion of subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the 
voclosporin group compared with the placebo group (1.7% vs 5.0%) while the proportions with TEAEs 
leading to dose modification or dose discontinuation were similar across the treatment groups.

Chronic kidney disease 
Overall, 30.0% of voclosporin-treated subjects compared with 22.9% of placebo-treated subjects 
experienced a TEAE in this SMQ during the first year of study treatment; this includes a large number 
Assessment report

of subjects that had temporary GFR decreases (26.2% in the voclosporin group and 9.4% in the 
placebo group) that were managed with dose interruption or modification.  
The applicant concludes that the majority of the TEAEs in the Chronic Kidney Disease SMQ appear to 
be related to the small, transient, pharmacological effect of voclosporin on eGFR or due to underlying 
disease, and do not indicate any chronic adverse effect of voclosporin on the kidney or development of 
CKD meeting KDIGO definitions. 
Also in the long-term AURORA 2 study (interim data submitted in the original application), a higher 
proportion of of voclosporin subjects (22.4%) than placebo subjects (13.0%) of in AURORA 2 have 
reported a TEAE in the Chronic Kidney Disease SMQ during the second or third year of study 
treatment. Most of these TEAEs were not considered related to study treatment (23 out of 33 TEAEs in 
the voclosporin group and 13 out of 16 TEAEs in the placebo group). GFR decreases (10.3% 
voclosporin vs 4.0% placebo), lupus nephritis (7.8% voclosporin and 3.0% placebo), and proteinuria 
(2.6% voclosporin vs 1.0% placebo) are the most frequently reported TEAEs in this SMQ.  
Hypertension 
Overall, in the pooled LN population (N=533), a total of 69 events were identified by this SMQ in 56 
subjects in the voclosporin group (21.0%) and 37 events in 28 subjects in the placebo group (10.5%). 
Serious TEAEs were reported in 6 subjects (2.2%) in voclosporin group, which included 5 events of 
hypertension in 5 subjects and 1 event of hypertensive crisis in 1 subject. The exposure-adjusted 
incidence of hypertension was highest in the first 4 weeks of treatment and declined over time in both 
groups. The treatment difference between voclosporin and placebo group gradually decreased until the 
incidence was the same in both groups after 26 weeks. 
Calcineurin inhibitor-related adverse events 
Overall, in the pooled LN population (N=533), 32.2% of voclosporin-treated subjects and 22.9% of 
placebo subjects experienced TEAEs that are recognised effects of CNIs (Table 70).

Infections 
The overall incidence of infections in the pooled LN population was 62.2% in the voclosporin group and 
54.9% in the placebo group. Infections occurring in at least 5% of patients receiving voclosporin and 
at least 1% more frequently than patients receiving placebo were urinary tract infection, viral upper 
respiratory tract infection, herpes zoster and gastroenteritis.

Adverse Events are coded using MedDRA v20.0. A TEAE is an AE that occurred on or after the 
first 
dose of study drug up to the last dose of study drug + 30 days. 
Opportunistic infections 
Overall, in the pooled LN population (N=533), the incidence was similar between the voclosporin 
(1.1%) and placebo (0.8%) groups with 5 subjects reporting an Opportunistic Infection. The types of 
infections included cutaneous/disseminated or ophthalmic manifestations of cytomegalovirus or the 
herpes family of viruses. Only 1 subject, in the placebo group, had a serious opportunistic infection 
(herpes zoster disseminated). All of the opportunistic infections observed are a known complication of 
MMF, which was part of the study treatment regimen for both voclosporin and placebo groups. 
According to the applicant, these results indicate that in subjects with LN, who are also using 
corticosteroids and MMF, the risk of opportunistic infection and serious opportunistic infection does not 
increase by the addition of voclosporin treatment.

Malignancies 
A total of 4 subjects in the pooled LN population reported a TEAE in this SMQ, all of whom were in the 
voclosporin group (1.5%). These TEAEs included a wide variety of preferred terms, with only single 
occurrences reported for each TEAE (stage 0 cervical carcinoma, skin neoplasm, pyoderma 
gangrenosum, and breast tumour excision). The only serious TEAE was cervical carcinoma. 
No malignancies were reported in the AURORA 2 study. 
MACE 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of MACE in the pooled LN population was lower in the 
voclosporin group (1.7 E/100 PYs ) than in the placebo group (2.1 E/100 PYs). 
Adverse events after drug discontinuation  
In AURORA 1 the patients that did not participate in the continuation study, were followed-up for 4 
Weeks (+/-10 days). Post-treatment AEs were defined as events occurring more than 30 days post-
last dose. That is deemed as an appropriate follow-up period. 
Overall incidence of any post-treatment AE was 14% (25/178 subjects) in each study group, with 72 
events in voclosporin and 69 events in placebo group. Most common were those pertaining to SOC 
Infections and infestations, but other SOCs with CNI class related AEs were represented (SOC Renal 
and urinary disorders, SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, SOC Blood and lymphatic 
system disorders, SOC Nervous system disorders and so on). Except of pneumonia events (4 vs 5 
events) and SLE (4 vs 1 event), other occurred in 1-2 cases. 
There were post-treatment SAEs observed: 6.2% (N=11, 17 events) in voclosporin vs 4.5% (N=8, 17 
events) in placebo group. Same SOCs were represented, with pneumonia being most frequent (3 vs 2 
events) and other events occurring individually. Three of these events resulted in death - 1 voclosporin 
subject and 2 placebo subjects (please refer to section “Deaths” below).  
According to available data, post-treatment eGFR values suggest resolution of voclosporin effect on 
eGFR decrease. This effect was rather small and in accordance with analysis of eGFR over time (please 
refer to section “Laboratory findings” below). 
2.5.8.3. Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In the pooled LN population, serious TEAEs occurred in 22.8% of voclosporin-treated subjects and 
18.8% of placebo-treated subjects (Table 72). The exposure-adjusted incidence of serious TEAEs in the 
voclosporin and placebo groups, respectively, was 28.3 and 23.2 events per 100 years of exposure.

are coded using 
MedDRA v20.0. An AE is an event that occurs on or after the first dose of study drug. 
The proportion of subjects in the 23.7 mg BID group in the AURA-LV study who died was higher than 
expected. The majority of deaths occurred in subjects from low-GDP countries (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, 
Philippines), who also had more severe baseline disease characteristics. An imbalance in regional 
randomisation was subsequently identified, where the 23.7 mg BID group had a higher proportion of 
subjects enrolled from these low-GDP countries, and this is believed to have introduced a bias towards 
poorer safety outcomes in this group. Additionally, there was no greater proportion of deaths in the 
high-dose 39.5 mg BID voclosporin group and other safety indices from the AURA-LV study were 
similar between treatment groups (incidence of TEAEs and serious TEAEs). Supplementary analyses 
identified region and several baseline disease characteristics as significant factors contributing to death 
independent of treatment assignment. Furthermore, the incidence of death in subjects treated with 
23.7 mg BID voclosporin in the AURORA 1 study was low (0.6%). According to the applicant, the 
Assessment report

totality of data suggests that the imbalance of deaths in subjects treated with 23.7 mg BID voclosporin 
in the AURA-LV study was associated with additional factors independent of voclosporin treatments. 
Of all deaths across the LN studies, none were considered to be treatment-related. An examination of 
mortality across all subjects with LN in the voclosporin studies indicated that the causes of death were 
multifactorial including sepsis, infection, and other lupus-related complications. Five deaths in the 
pooled LN population occurred >30 days after last dose of study drug. All subjects who died, along 
with the events leading to death, are listed below.

Notes:  BID=Twice daily; N=No; No.=Number; SAE=Serious adverse event; TEAE=Treatment-emergent adverse event; Y=Yes. 
In the final CSR from the AURORA 2 study, 3 placebo subjects have had TEAEs leading to death: 
coronavirus infection (2 subjects) and pulmonary embolism (1 subject). None of these TEAEs were 
considered treatment-related by the Investigators, who remain blinded to study treatment. There were 
no deaths in voclosporin-treated subjects in AURORA 2. 
The weighted incidence of all-cause mortality or renal failure was 4.2% in the placebo group, 6.4% in 
the voclosporin 23.7 mg group and 3.4% in the voclosporin 39.5 mg group (Table 77).

Figure 21 Recommended Voclosporin Dose Adjustments in Response to eGFR 
Note: Individuals requiring a decrease in dose should be reassessed for eGFR recovery within 2 
weeks. For patients that had a decrease in dose due to eGFR reduction, consider increasing the 
dose by 7.9 mg BID for each eGFR measurement that is ≥80% of baseline; do not exceed the 
starting dose. 
Analysis of the change in eGFR over time was calculated with both raw eGFR values (as reported by 
the central laboratory) and corrected values (all values >90 mL/min/1.73 m2 were rounded to 
90 mL/min/1.73 m2 as requested by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board). In the pooled LN 
population, mean baseline corrected eGFR was similar between treatment groups (mean±SD of 
79.0±15.44 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the voclosporin group and 79.1±15.86 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the 
placebo group). The maximum mean decrease from baseline in corrected eGFR in the voclosporin 
group occurred at Week 4 and was -3.4 mL/min/1.73 m2; in comparison, the placebo group had a 
mean increase of 2.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Week 4 (for a mean difference of -5.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
p <0.0001. 
In the final CSR from the AURORA 2 continuation study, mean corrected eGFR values during Years 2 
and 3 of study treatment are similar to the mean eGFR values observed over the first year of study 
treatment in this same group of subjects (Figure 21).

The reversibility of renal events was discussed in response to day 120 LoQ: 
An analysis of the reversibility of TEAEs of acute renal failure or chronic kidney disease or a confirmed 
eGFR decrease of ≥ 30% is provided below for AURORA 1 together with an analysis of subjects with a 
≥ 20% decrease in eGFR.  
Recovery was defined as an increase in eGFR to within 20% of baseline. This is in line with the 
AURORA 1 protocol which stated that: “subjects experiencing a decrease in eGFR with resultant 
decrease in dose should be reassessed for recovery of renal function. If the repeated eGFR is >80% of 
baseline, the dose should be increased by 1 capsule BID and eGFR assessed within 2 weeks.” It also 
reflects the proposed SmPC wording (SmPC Section 4.2) which states that the current dose of 
voclosporin should be maintained for a ≤ 20% reduction in eGFR. 
Acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease or confirmed eGFR decreases of ≥ 30% 
In total, 65 voclosporin subjects (36.5%) and 55 placebo subjects (30.9%) had at least 1 of the 
following events: 
Acute renal failure defined using SMQ20000003. 
CKD event defined using SMQ20000213. 
eGFR decreases ≥ 30% defined as 2 consecutive measures showing at least a 30% drop from baseline. 
Of these subjects, the proportion of voclosporin treated subjects who recovered was 92.3% (Table 79).

Of the 5 subjects in the voclosporin group who did not recover to within 20% of the baseline eGFR, 4 
had clear disease progression/LN flare and 1 subject had a partial recovery in eGFR levels, although 
recovery was to less than 20% of baseline.  
Confirmed eGFR decreases of ≥ 20% 
More voclosporin subjects than placebo subjects had a confirmed decrease of ≥ 20% in eGFR (25.8% 
vs 18.5%). Among these, 73.9% of subjects in the voclosporin group recovered (Table 80).

Of the 12 subjects in the voclosporin group who did not recover, 5 were discussed above (=had eGFR 
decrease of ≥ 30%). Of the remaining 7 subjects who did not recover, disease progression was a 
factor in 6 subjects and 1 had partial recovery in eGFR levels although recovery was to less than 20% 
of baseline.

Further, in response to day 180 LoQ, the applicant presented details on the reversibility of renal events 
from the AURORA 2 study.  
During the second and third years of treatment, fewer subjects in both arms experienced events of 
acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or eGFR decrease of ≥ 30% from AURORA 1 baseline 
than in the first 12 months. As in the first year of treatment in AURORA 1, more events were recorded 
in the voclosporin arm than the placebo arm (30.2% vs 20.0%); however, the recovery rate was 
higher in the voclosporin arm (85.7% vs 55.0%). 
Table 81 Summary of subjects with renal events and their recovery in AURORA 2 
Similarly, more voclosporin subjects than placebo subjects had a confirmed decrease of ≥ 20% in 
eGFR (19.8% vs 12.0%), but the proportion of subjects who recovered was higher in the voclosporin 
group compared with the placebo group (69.6% vs 41.7%). This shows that even after long-term 
treatment with voclosporin (beyond 12 months), the majority of subjects recover from the CNI-induced 
decrease in eGFR.

Serum creatinine 
In the pooled LN population, mean baseline serum creatinine was similar between treatment groups 
(0.82 mg/dL in the voclosporin group and 0.80 mg/dL in the placebo group). Mean serum creatinine 
levels are shown below. 
Figure 25. Mean (±95% CI) Observed Serum Creatinine (mg/dL) by Visit (AURORA 1 and AURORA 2) 
No subjects in the voclosporin group had any Grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine increases during study 
treatment and in the placebo group, there were 2 subjects with increases in serum creatinine to Grade 
3 or 4. Shifts to Grade 2 serum creatinine occurred in 34 subjects in the voclosporin group and 17 
subjects in the placebo group. 
Other renal function parameters 
In the pooled LN population, mean baseline albumin levels were below normal (range of 3.5 to 
5.5 g/dL) in both the voclosporin (2.87±0.757 g/dL) and placebo (2.98±0.711) groups, which is 
expected given that the subjects had pronounced proteinuria. Albumin levels gradually improved 
throughout study treatment in both groups and reached the normal range by Week 12 in the 
voclosporin group and by Week 24 in the placebo group.

Liver function 
In the pooled LN population, alkaline phosphatase gradually increased from baseline in the voclosporin 
group, whereas the placebo group experienced sporadic changes. Mean values remained within the 
normal range (37 to 116 U/L) at all time points.  
Mean bilirubin values were within normal ranges (0.1 to 1.1 mg/dL) at all time points in both groups. 
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl 
transpeptidase (GGT) were within normal ranges and there were no meaningful differences between 
treatment groups). There was no difference in the percentages of subjects with shifts from baseline 
representing a Grade 1 or 2 worsening of ALT or AST (no subjects in either group had Grade 3 or 4 
shifts). 
There was 1 subject in the voclosporin group with changes in both aminotransferases and bilirubin that 
met biochemical criteria for Hy’s Law. This subject had increases in ALT (>5x upper limit of normal 
[ULN]), AST (>5x ULN), and bilirubin (>2x ULN) on Day 31; however, study treatment had been 
previously discontinued on Day 23 following several TEAEs, including drug-induced liver injury that was 
reported as hepatotoxicity secondary to anti-tuberculosis medication and was considered by the 
Investigator to be unrelated to study treatment. The subject was taking multiple concomitant 
medications, including rifampicin (known to have hepatotoxic adverse effects), and had other 
comorbidities, including pulmonary tuberculosis starting on Day 22 and pericarditis tuberculous leading 
to death on Day 40. There were no other subjects with changes in transaminases and bilirubin 
suggestive of liver injury, nor any other TEAEs of drug-induced liver injury in the LN population. 
Other blood chemistry parameters 
Serum electrolytes 
Mean calcium levels were below normal range (8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL) in the voclosporin group at baseline 
but increased to within the normal range during study treatment (8.38±0.650 mg/dL at baseline and 
8.95±0.517 mg/dL Week 52. Shifts from normal to below normal or from below normal to a more 
severe category of below normal at any time during study treatment occurred in both voclosporin and 
placebo groups at similar frequencies. Furthermore, the incidence of hypocalcemia as a TEAE was 
similar between treatment groups (0.4% voclosporin and 0.8% placebo) 
The changes from baseline in potassium were significantly different between treatment groups at every 
visit (p≤0.002), but mean values remained within the normal range (3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L) in both 
groups at all time points. According to the applicant, there was no meaningful difference between 
treatment groups in TEAE incidence of hypokalemia (5.6% voclosporin vs 6.8% placebo) and 
hyperkalemia (1.9% voclosporin vs 0.8% placebo). 
Haematology and coagulation 
In the pooled LN population, mean and median values for haematocrit, haemoglobin, and red blood 
cells (RBCs) were near or below the lower limit of the respective normal ranges in both placebo and 
voclosporin groups at all time points, including baseline. Both placebo and voclosporin groups 
experienced small decreases from baseline in mean haematocrit, haemoglobin, and RBC values 
throughout study treatment at most time points. These decreases were larger in the voclosporin group 
than placebo group at each time point. 
Leukocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils initially increased from baseline at Week 4 in both treatment 
groups, with larger increases from baseline in the voclosporin group than the placebo group; however, 
absolute counts were within the normal range. After Week 4, mean leukocyte counts were lower than 
baseline in both treatment groups with no differences between treatments, and mean values continued 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 164/165 
 
 
 
to remain within normal ranges at all time points. A lower percentage of voclosporin-treated subjects 
(3.1%) shifted to Grade 3 or 4 lymphocytes compared with placebo-treated subjects (6.5%). 
Neutrophils remained normal in most subjects in both treatment groups overall, with shifts to Grade 3 
or 4 neutrophils occurring at a low, similar frequency between groups (2.3% of voclosporin and 1.5% 
of placebo). 
Lipids and glucose 
Hyperlipidemia is a common comorbidity in subjects with LN and was observed frequently in the 
medical history of the study populations. As such, mean baseline values for total cholesterol, low-
density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides were above the respective normal ranges in both placebo 
and voclosporin groups. Overall, lipid profiles improved in both treatment groups throughout the study 
periods. 
Mean glucose levels were within normal range (60 to 115 mg/dL) at all time points in both treatment 
groups, according to the applicant with no meaningful change over the study treatment periods. A 
similar number of subjects experienced a shift above normal in the placebo (13 subjects, 4.9%) and 
voclosporin groups (10 subjects, 3.8%); shifts to Grade 3 hyperglycemia were observed in 2 
voclosporin subjects and 0 placebo subjects. The Grade 3 shifts in glucose in the voclosporin group 
occurred in different subjects at sporadic visits (Week 8 and 20) and were not sustained. The absence 
of any long-term changes in glucose is supported by the HbA1c results, as mean levels were within 
normal range (4% to 6%) at all time points in both treatment groups and there were no meaningful 
changes from baseline during treatment. New-onset diabetes is an important recognised adverse effect 
of CNI inhibitors, but an examination of TEAEs related to diabetes and glycemic control indicate that 
there is no increase in these types of events with voclosporin treatment. 
Urinalysis 
In general, urinalysis parameters improved in both the placebo and voclosporin groups. Improvements 
include a reduction in the percentage of subjects exhibiting any amount of blood in the urine 
(voclosporin: 78.7% at baseline and 42.9% at Week 52; placebo: 74.4% at baseline and 49.2%; 
results for urinary RBCs were similar) and, in those subjects with results available, increases in the 
percentage of subjects with no or occasional granular casts present (voclosporin: 27.0% at baseline 
[n=63] and 42.1% at Week 52 [n=19]; placebo: 26.5% at baseline [n=68] and 55.6% at Week 52 
[n=18]). 
Improvements in urinary protein were also observed throughout study treatment. At baseline most 
subjects had ≥300 mg/dL (79% voclosporin and 80.1% placebo). By Week 52, the proportion of 
subjects with ≥300 mg/dL protein decreased to 23.7% in the voclosporin group and 49.2% in the 
placebo group.  
Vital signs and physical findings 
Dedicated QT studies 
The effect of voclosporin on the QT interval were explored in the single-dose (Study ISA03-11) and 
multiple-dose (Study ISA05-03) studies in healthy subjects. According to the applicant, these studies 
were designed in accordance with the ICH E14 guidance “Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval 
Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs” and primarily included 
supratherapeutic doses (from 0.5 to 4.5 mg/kg single dose and 0.3 to 1.5 mg/kg multiple dose for 6 
days). According to the ICH Topic E 14, ”The Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and 
Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs”: 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 165/166 
 
 
 
”The positive control should have an effect on the mean QT/QTc interval of about 5 ms (i.e., an effect 
that is close to the QT/QTc effect that represents the threshold of regulatory concern, around 5 ms)”.  
”A negative ‘thorough QT/QTc study’ is one in which the upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence 
interval for the largest time-matched meaneffect of the drug on the QTc interval excludes 10 ms.” 
Study ISA03-11 showed that after a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg, the mean maximum difference from 
placebo on the QTcF interval was 6.4 msec (upper bound of the 95% CI 11.6 msec). In Study ISA05-
03, voclosporin did not prolong the QTcF interval after multiple doses of 1.5 mg/kg BID 
(supratherapeutic dose) nor 0.3 or 0.5 mg/kg BID dosing (closer to therapeutic LN dose) relative to 
placebo.  
ECG findings in phase 2/3 studies 
In the AURA-LV study, TEAEs of QT prolongation were observed in one subject treated with 23.7 mg 
BID voclosporin and one subject treated with 39.5 mg BID voclosporin. According to the applicant, a 
detailed, independent analysis of ECG data from the AURA-LV study in subjects with LN showed no 
evidence of ECG-related safety concerns. Mean values for heart rate and PR, QRS, and QTcF intervals 
were stable across visits with only nominal differences between treatment groups. Furthermore, a 
regression analysis of change of QTcF from baseline (adjusted for placebo) showed a minimally 
negative slope that was not statistically different from a slope of 0. As a result of these conclusions 
from the AURA-LV study, it was determined that the ECG monitoring (12-lead) requirements could be 
reduced for the subsequent AURORA 1 study (i.e., less frequent and without triplicate readings or 
central monitoring, except for subjects who met prespecified criteria). 
According to the applicant, in the AURORA1 study there were no clinically meaningful changes from 
baseline or differences between treatment groups in ECG parameters. No subject recorded a QTcF of 
>500 msec. Two TEAEs of QT prolongation were recorded in one subject (increases of 92 msec and 53 
msec from baseline) and this subject discontinued voclosporin treatment following the second event. 
QTcF prolongation (an increase from baseline of 76 msec) was confirmed in a second subject who had 
discontinued study treatment 22 days earlier, but not recorded as a TEAE. Both subjects were 
asymptomatic and continued follow-up in the study. An independent review of ECG interval changes 
from AURORA 1 was also performed and concluded that there were no meaningful signs of delayed 
cardiac repolarisation. 
In the final CSR from AURORA 2 (01 April 2021), 3 subjects in the placebo group were reported to 
have prolonged QT time. No TEAEs of QT prolongation have been reported in the voclosporin group.

Renal impairment 
Adverse events by baseline eGFR 
The incidence of TEAEs was comparable between voclosporin and placebo treatment groups in the 
subgroups of subjects with higher baseline eGFR (i.e., ≥60 and <90 or ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2), but in 
the lowest baseline eGFR subgroup (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2), the voclosporin group had a higher 
incidence of TEAEs (97.5%) than placebo (87.3%) (Table 84). The incidence of serious TEAEs was 
highest in the subgroup of subjects with the worst baseline eGFR levels and lowest in the subgroup of 
subjects with the highest baseline eGFR, reflecting an increasingly greater incidence of serious TEAEs 
Assessment report

as baseline disease increased in severity, with similar incidences between voclosporin and placebo, 
except in the lowest eGFR subgroup (38.2% voclosporin vs 28.8% placebo).

Hepatic impairment 
According to the applicant, voclosporin is metabolised in the liver, primarily through the cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzyme CYP3A4/5, and is predominantly eliminated through biliary excretion. The hepatic 
impairment study ISA07-09 was conducted to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
profile of voclosporin and its metabolites in subjects with hepatic impairment after single or multiple 
doses. Safety parameters of AEs, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory parameters were also 
examined. 
The applicant states that single and multiple doses of voclosporin 0.4 mg/kg were well tolerated in 
healthy volunteer subjects and in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, as were single doses in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. No deaths and no SAEs were reported during the study, 
and no subjects discontinued due to an AE.  
The applicant concludes that administration of 0.4 mg/kg voclosporin to subjects with mild (Child-Pugh 
A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment resulted in an approximately 1.5-fold to 2-fold 
increase in voclosporin exposure after single doses. Furthermore, that single and multiple doses of 
voclosporin were well tolerated with regard to AEs, vital signs, ECG findings and laboratory findings in 
subjects with hepatic impairment and in normal subjects. Thus, voclosporin dose reductions may be 
required in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, similar to the manner recommended 
for subjects with reduced eGFR. The use of voclosporin in subjects with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh C) has not been evaluated. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
In nonclinical studies, voclosporin was not teratogenic in animal studies at doses that caused maternal 
toxicity. The maternal effects included changes in body weight and/or swollen mammary glands, and 
fetal effects consisted of a slight reduction in body weights and related skeletal developmental 
variations.

There are no adequate well-controlled studies with voclosporin in pregnant women. A study of 
placental transfer and lacteal excretion in rats demonstrated that radiolabeled voclosporin was present 
in fetal tissues, suggesting that dose-related material had crossed the placental barrier. Dose-related 
material was observed in the milk of lactating females, and in the stomach contents and carcasses of 
male and female pups, suggesting that voclosporin administered to pregnant female rats was 
transferred to the pups via the milk and subsequently absorbed from the GI tract of the pups. These 
results suggest that voclosporin might also cross the placental barrier in humans. 
In clinical trials with voclosporin, across all indications, there were 16 reports of pregnancy in subjects 
treated with voclosporin or their partners (Table 85). It is important to note that subjects with LN were 
also taking MMF as part of the study treatment regimen, which is known to be teratogenic; therefore 
any adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes in voclosporin-treated subjects with LN will be confounded 
by the use of this background medication.

In summary, from the information available, no adverse maternal or foetal effects were identified due 
to voclosporin exposure at the doses used in these clinical studies. There are no adequate or well-
controlled studies of voclosporin in pregnant women. Available data on use of voclosporin in pregnant 
women are insufficient to determine whether there is a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or 
miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with SLE. 
A placental transfer and lacteal excretion study in rats indicated that voclosporin was secreted in rat 
breast milk; therefore, it is likely to be excreted in human milk. No information is available on the 
presence of voclosporin in human milk, the effects of voclosporin on the breastfed infant, or the effects 
of voclosporin on milk production. 
2.5.8.6. Immunological events 
No immunogenicity is expected for a small molecule. 
2.5.8.7. Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In vitro data demonstrate that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for voclosporin metabolism 
and voclosporin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Based on the results from in vitro studies, 
clinical PK drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 and/or P-

gp inhibitor), verapamil (moderate CYP3A4 and strong P-gp inhibitor), and rifampin (strong CYP3A4 
and P-gp inducer, OATP1B1/3 inhibitor) to evaluate the potential for voclosporin to be a victim for 
interactions. In addition, clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of voclosporin as a 
perpetrator of drug-drug interactions with midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) and digoxin (P-gp 
substrate). Furthermore, as voclosporin is to be administered with MMF as background therapy, a 
clinical drug-drug interaction study was performed in subjects with SLE (with or without LN) to 
evaluate the effect on plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and mycophenolic acid 
glucuronide (MPAG).  
The results from these studies are discussed in detail in the PK section (see 2.5.2. ). 
Approximately one-third of subjects in the AURA-LV and AURORA 1 studies received concomitant 
treatment with statins. There was no consistent imbalance in TEAEs reflective of clinical manifestations 
of statin toxicity in voclosporin-treated subjects on statins compared with not receiving statins. A 
dedicated statin study is planned for (see 2.5.4. ). 
2.5.8.8. Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The percentage of subjects in the pooled LN population who experienced TEAEs resulting in permanent 
study drug discontinuation was the same between the voclosporin (13.5%) and placebo (13.2%) 
groups (Table 65). Although there was a similar overall incidence between treatment groups, an 
examination of the specific TEAEs that led to study drug discontinuation shows some differences. In 
the voclosporin group, TEAEs resulting in study drug discontinuation were most often due to GFR 
decreased (10 subjects, 3.7%), a recognised effect of CNIs. In contrast, only 5 placebo-treated 
subjects (1.9%) had this TEAE resulting in study drug discontinuation. The next most frequent TEAEs 
resulting in study drug discontinuation in the voclosporin group were renal impairment (5 subjects) 
and pneumonia (3 subjects), which occurred in similar numbers of placebo subjects (4 subjects and 2 
subjects, respectively).  
In the placebo group, the most frequent TEAE resulting in study drug discontinuation was lupus 
nephritis (6 subjects, 2.3%), which occurred in only 2 voclosporin-treated subjects (0.7%). The 
incidences of proteinuria and SLE leading to discontinuation were also higher in the placebo group (5 
and 3 subjects, respectively) than in the voclosporin group (0 subjects and 1 subject, respectively). As 
these events are part of the underlying disease, this pattern of TEAE-related discontinuations indicates 
that disease activity remained higher in the placebo group. 
Overdose 
In the AURORA 1 study, one accidental overdose occurred in the voclosporin group; the subject 
accidentally dosed more than prescribed on some mornings for a total of 12 extra capsules over a 4-
week period. The TEAE was considered mild and intermittent and was not associated with any medical 
intervention or ongoing sequelae. A second voclosporin-treated subject in the AURORA 1 trial had an 
intentional multidrug overdose, which did not involve an overdose of voclosporin: the subject 
consumed an estimated 20 tablets each of atorvastatin, sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim, and MMF. 
In the AURORA 2 trial, one TEAE of accidental overdose was reported in a voclosporin-treated subject, 
which was classified as mild and non-serious. Following a 1-week interruption in study treatment (from 
30 Aug 2019 to 05 Sep 2019) due to a decrease in eGFR, the subject was restarted on a dose of 2 
capsules (15.8 mg) BID on 06 Sep 2019 (Day 382). Over the next 73 days (between this date and the 
Month 15 visit on 18 Nov 2019 [Day 455]), the subject took 67 capsules more than prescribed 
(equivalent to less than one additional capsule per day above their prescribed dose of 2 capsules BID). 
Therefore, the subject is not thought to have exceeded the proposed therapeutic dose of 3 capsules 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 170/171 
 
 
 
BID. No symptoms were reported relating to the misdosing of voclosporin, and the subject did not 
require or receive treatment for the overdose and recovered without sequalae. 
Additional information on potential adverse effects of voclosporin overdose can be drawn from Study 
LX211-06, in which coadministration of ketoconazole and voclosporin resulted in an 18-fold increase in 
voclosporin exposure in healthy volunteers. Increases in serum creatinine, decreases in serum 
magnesium, and increases in blood pressure were observed in these subjects, which were considered 
to be effects directly related to the large increase in voclosporin exposure. 
2.5.8.9. Post marketing experience 
Voclosporin (Lupkynis) was approved in the United States on 22 January 2021. As of 21 April 2021, an 
estimated patients in the United States have been prescribed Lupkynis as part of their medical care 
(based on the number of patients who have had a prescription dispensed). According to the applicant, 
preliminary reports from postmarketing use of Lupkynis indicate that the safety profile remains 
consistent with that observed in clinical trials and there continues to be a favorable benefit / risk in 
patients with LN. 
The most frequently reported ADRs pertained to SOC Gastrointestinal disorders (24 cases, 42 events), 
followed by SOC Nervous system disorders (17 cases, 18 events), SOC General disorders and 
administration site conditions (12 cases, 16 events), SOC Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications (8 cases, 10 events), SOC Vascular disorders (8 cases, 8 events). The most frequently 
reported ADRs were nausea (N=12), headache (N=9), diarrhoea (N=8), hypertension (N=7). 
2.5.9. Discussion on clinical safety 
Voclosporin is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant proposed for treatment of lupus nephritis. 
Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase whose activity is required for the induction 
of T-cell lymphokine production and proliferation.  
According to the applicant, voclosporin is structurally similar to cyclosporine A (CsA) except for a 
modification to the amino acid-1 region which is proposed to alter the metabolic profile.  
Increased blood pressure and acute renal vasomotor effects are well-known potential toxicities of CNIs. 
Other adverse effects associated with current CNIs include neurotoxicity, electrolyte disturbances, 
impaired glucose tolerance and new-onset diabetes mellitus, and, like all immunosuppressants, 
infections and malignancies. 
Voclosporin was approved in the US for treatment of lupus nephritis in January 2021. 
Exposure 
The total exposure to voclosporin is 2,666 subjects, including 365 patients with LN whereof 116 have 
been exposed for >1 year. Across all indications (including also psoriasis and uveitis), a total of 
385 subjects have been exposed for more than 1 year. 
The current application is based primarily on pooled data from the phase 2 AURA-LV and phase 3 
AURORA 1 study up to 1 year of treatment exposure. The final CSR from the long-term extension 
phase of AURORA 1 (AURORA 2) was submitted in response to day 120 LoQ. In this study, 101 
voclosporin-treated patients were exposed for >36 months. 
The following exclusion criteria with impact on safety were used in the AURA-LV and AURORA 1 
studies:

Information on this is available in the SmPC section 4.2. 
Taking medications listed as prohibited in the protocol 
In response to day 120 LoQ it was clarified in the section 4.4 that there are no data on concomitant 
use with cyclophosphamide. 
Requiring dialysis 
Previous or planned kidney transplant  
History of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, malignancy, lymphoproliferative disease or 
previous total lymphoid irradiation, severe viral infection requiring antiviral therapy, active

with isoniazid 
Active medical conditions such as severe cardiovascular disease, liver dysfunction, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease or asthma requiring oral steroids, bone marrow insufficiency, active bleeding 
disorders, or current infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics. 
At the CHMP’s request, the Section 4.4 SmPC text was updated to reflect the common warnings about 
serious infections.  
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics 
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the pooled LN safety population were well 
balanced between voclosporin and placebo groups, and are deemed representative of the target 
population. Background medications use, i.e. MMF and corticosteroids (iv and peroral), was generally 
balanced between the groups in the pooled LN safety population. However, it is impossible to 
distinguish possible interaction of voclosporin with MMF. The assessment of voclosporin’s clinical safety 
profile is further hampered by extensive additional concomitant treatment (e.g. angiotensin receptor 
blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, lipid modifying agents, anti-anaemic agents, 
calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, antimalarials). For details on concomitant medications, please 
refer to the efficacy section (See 2.5.5. ). 
Integrated analyses present demographic baseline characteristics of LN patients combining the 
European and South-African regions, representing 28.8% of analysed LN safety population. European 
sites were generally located in eastern countries, outside EU. As part of day 120 LoQ, the applicant 
was invited to elaborate whether LN studied population is representative of the EU-population taking 
possible differences in medical practices into consideration too (please refer to the ICH E5 and 
Reflection paper CHMP/EWP/692702/08). In their response, the applicant provided a justification that 
the studied population is representative of the EU-population, which was agreed by the CHMP. 
Adverse events 
In the pooled LN population, the incidences were similar for adverse events (AEs) (91% and 88%) and 
TEAEs (treatment-emergent adverse events) (91% and 87%, defined as occurring on-treatment or up 
to 30 days post-treatment) in the voclosporin and placebo groups, respectively. On the other hand, 
treatment-related TEAEs were more frequently observed in voclosporin-treated subjects (47%) than 
placebo-treated subjects (23%). Serious TEAEs occurred in 23% of voclosporin-treated subjects and 
19% of placebo-treated subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 172/173 
 
 
 
 
 
TEAEs leading to dose modification occurred more often in voclosporin-treated subjects (46%) than 
placebo-treated subjects (25%). However, the incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent study drug 
discontinuation was similar between voclosporin and placebo treatment groups (13.5% vs 13.2%). 
Infections and Infestations were the most frequently reported SOC for TEAEs and were more frequent 
among voclosporin-treated subjects (62.2%) than among placebo-treated subjects (54.9%). Also in 
the AURORA 2 study, infections and infestations were the most frequently reported types of TEAEs. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders were the second-most frequent SOC for TEAEs, reported in 45.3% and 
35.3% of voclosporin and placebo subjects, respectively. 
Among TEAEs, GFR decreased was the most frequently reported TEAE in voclosporin-treated subjects 
(26.2%, compared with 9.4% placebo) followed by hypertension (19.1%, compared with 8.6% 
placebo). Although these are known and expected side effects of CNIs, it is problematic in a disease 
manifesting with these symptoms since this might complicate monitoring of disease activity. This is 
discussed in detail below.  
Other TEAEs occurring in ≥10% in voclosporin group were: diarrhoea (18.7%), headache (15.0%), 
anaemia (12.4%), cough (10.9%) and urinary tract infection (9.7%). 
In the final CSR from the AURORA 2 study, AEs were reported in 86% of subjects in the voclosporin 
group and 80% of subjects in the placebo group.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Approximately half of the subjects who experienced serious TEAEs had a serious Infection or 
Infestation, with similar incidence across treatment groups (10.1% of subjects in each group). Serious 
TEAEs more common in the voclosporin than in the placebo group were acute kidney injury, renal 
impairment, nervous system disorders, hypertension, respirator, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, 
and anaemia. 
A total of 23 subjects died in the LN studies, 13/365 voclosporin-treated patients (3.6%) and 10/266 
placebo-treated patients (3.8%). Infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary 
embolism were the most frequent causes of death.  
It is noteworthy that there was a higher number of deaths in the voclosporin group than in the placebo 
group in the AURA-LV study. According to the applicant, this might be due to differences in baseline 
characteristics between the groups with a higher proportion of subjects in the voclosporin group 
enrolled from low-GDP countries, which is believed to have introduced a bias towards poorer safety 
outcomes in this group. Although this can only be hypothesised, it is reassuring that the same pattern 
was not observed in the AURORA 1 or AURORA 2 studies, where the frequency of death was higher 
among placebo-treated subjects. In total, the frequency of death is comparable between the treatment 
groups. Further, reassuringly, there was a low number of deaths in higher dose voclosporin 39.5 BID 
group in the AURA-LV study. 
There were two deaths among voclosporin-treated patients in the psoriasis/uveitis population, one 
accident and one case of bile duct cancer, the latter possibly related to voclosporin. In response to day 
120 LoQ, details were presented on this case. The applicant clarified that the case of death due to bile 
duct cancer in the plaque psoriasis study occurred 56 days from start of voclosporin treatment, which 
is considered too short to suspect causality. Further, that the case was confounded by previous 
treatment with other immunosuppressive drugs. Causality with voclosporin is thus unlikely. 
As noted in the “Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products to prevent 
development/slow progression of chronic renal insufficiency”, the composite of all-cause mortality and 
renal failure should always be reported. This was reported in response to day 120 LoQ: The incidence 
of all-cause mortality or renal failure in the AURA-LV and AURORA 1 studies was 4.2% in the placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 173/174 
 
 
 
group, 6.4% in the voclosporin 23.7 mg group and 3.4% in the voclosporin 39.5 mg group. Although 
this is of some concern, data from the AURORA 2 study are reassuring where the incidence was 4.0% 
in the placebo group and 0.9% in the voclosporin group.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of particular interest in LN patients and/or the CNI class of drug were acute renal 
failure, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, calcineurin-inhibitor-related adverse events, 
opportunistic infections, and malignancies. 
 Serious Infections including opportunistic infections is listed as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
MACEs, Neurotoxicity, Nephrotoxicity (acute and chronic), Malignancies (including lymphomas) 
associated with long term use are listed as important potential risks in the RMP. 
Acute renal failure occurred in 33.3% of voclosporin-treated subjects compared with 17.7% of placebo-
treated subjects during the first year of study treatment. Of these, the large majority had decreased 
GFR, 26.2% in the voclosporin group and 9.4% in the placebo group, that according to the applicant 
were managed effectively with dose interruption or modification.  
Chronic kidney disease occurred in 30.0% of voclosporin-treated subjects compared with 22.9% of 
placebo-treated subjects during the first year of study treatment. 
The maximum mean decrease from baseline in corrected eGFR in the voclosporin group occurred at 
Week 4 and was -3.4 mL/min/1.73 m2. Mean GFR levels remained stable thereafter, and there were no 
signs of decreasing mean GFR levels over time in the AURORA 2 study up to 36 months treatment.  
The reversibility of the observed decreases in GFR and renal adverse events were discussed in 
response to day 120 and 180 LoQs. The applicant clarified that the increased risk for acute renal failure 
observed for voclosporin compared to placebo was mainly due to a reversible decrease in GFR. In total, 
65 voclosporin subjects (36.5%) and 55 placebo subjects (30.9%) had at least 1 of the following 
events: acute renal failure, CKD, or eGFR decreases ≥ 30%. Of these subjects, 92.3% of voclosporin-
treated subjects recovered. Of the 5 subjects in the voclosporin group who did not recover to within 
20% of the baseline eGFR, 4 had clear disease progression/LN flare and 1 subject had a partial 
recovery in eGFR levels, although recovery was to less than 20% of baseline. There are no indications 
on a chronic nephrotoxic effect of voclosporin. The risk for acute renal failure is considered possible to 
handle through careful monitoring of GFR, and dose modification or discontinuation of therapy in case 
of decreased GFR. The monitoring guidelines and dose recommendation are based on what was used in 
the AURORA 1 study (please refer to Figure 21) and is considered acceptable.  
When comparing AEs by GFR subgroups, in all subgroups AEs were slightly more frequent for 
voclosporin than for placebo, but the difference was most prominent in patients with 
eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients with GFR<45 were excluded from the clinical studies. The safety in 
patients with renal impairment was discussed in response to day 120 LoQ. The applicant clarified that 
seventeen subjects (9 voclosporin, 8 placebo) enrolled into the AURORA 1 clinical trial had an eGFR 
value ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening or baseline visits. Of these patients, 8 voclosporin-treated 
patients completed AURORA 1 and 5 of these entered the AURORA 2 study. According to the applicant, 
the dedicated renal impairment study suggests that there is no significant effect of mild or moderate 
renal impairment on voclosporin exposure and that severe renal impairment may result in a 1.46- and 
1.74-fold increase in Cmax and AUC0-48 a after a single dose. Voclosporin and metabolites are in 2% 
excreted by the kidney.  
Although on one hand these patients with GFR<45 can be considered to represent those with the most 
serious disease and are likely to be in most need of effective treatment, on the other hand these are 
the most fragile patients with limited reserves to handle potential CNI-induced renal toxicity. It is 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 174/175 
 
 
 
agreed that in certain patients with severe disease, use of Lupkynis might be justified despite GFR<45 
and adequate dosing recommendations in these patients are available in Section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
“Lupkynis has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
and is not recommended in these patients unless the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, the 
recommended starting dose is 15.8 mg twice daily (see section 5.2).” 
A small increase in mean serum creatinine levels was observed in the voclosporin group from week 4, 
with stable levels thereafter.  
Adequate information on the risk of renal toxicity and monitoring of the GFR levels have been included 
in the SmPC: 
“As with other calcineurin-inhibitors, adverse reactions of acute worsening of renal function or eGFR 
decreases have been seen in patients treated with voclosporin. In the first four weeks of treatment 
with voclosporin, haemodynamic reductions in eGFR have been observed. This can be managed by 
dose adjustments. Regular monitoring of eGFR levels is recommended.” 
“It is recommended to establish a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before starting 
treatment with voclosporin, and assess every two weeks for the first month, and every four weeks 
thereafter.” 
AURORA 2 includes a biopsy substudy, in which 18 voclosporin subjects and 15 placebo subjects had 
second biopsies taken. Although the results were requested, no biopsy results could be provided 
because of a delay in the interpretation of the biopsies due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to 
the AURORA 2 CSR these biopsies should have been performed 6 months after entry in the AURORA 2 
study. Of the 216 patients who entered the AURORA 2 study, the majority (186/216 patients) had 
completed 36 months of treatment (i.e. had completed 24 months in the AURORA 2 study). Therefore, 
most of these biopsies should have been performed >18 months ago. Although it is understandable if 
all analyses (such as gene expression and immune markers) might be time consuming, at least 
preliminary histological results should be available. However, the CHMP agreed to receive the final 
results in December 2022, . The AURORA 2 biopsy substudy is included as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. 
Hypertension occurred in 56 subjects in the voclosporin group (21.0%) and 28 subjects in the placebo 
group (10.5%). Hypertension is a known CNI effect and is an expected AE also for voclosporin. This AE 
is adequately reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC Furthermore, a warning is included in section 4.4, 
along with recommendations for management in case hypertension occurs: 
“Voclosporin can cause or worsen systemic hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored every 
two weeks for the first month after initiating voclosporin, and as clinically indicated thereafter. In the 
event of clinically concerning elevated blood pressure, the recommendations in table below should be 
followed.

Calcineurin inhibitor-related adverse events that were reported more frequently in the voclosporin 
group (at least 2% higher incidence) compared with placebo were hypertension, tremor, and 
hypertrichosis. 
In the pooled LN population, 32.2% of voclosporin-treated subjects and 22.9% of placebo subjects 
experienced CNI-related TEAEs. Hypertrichosis, hirsutism and gingival hypertrophy were observed 
exclusively in the voclosporin group. 
This information is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Due to limited long-term follow-up, it is still not clear whether voclosporin like other calcineurin 
inhibitors is associated with a risk for renal fibrosis after many years of treatment. To date, there are 
no indications on irreversible renal damage caused by voclosporin but this will be an important issue to 
follow through post-approval data collection (PSUR and PASS).  
Opportunistic infections were rare but more frequent in the voclosporin group, 10.9% compared to 
6.4% in placebo group. Serious opportunistic infections were recorded in 1.1% (3 participants) in 
voclosporin group and in 0.8% (2 participants) in placebo group. One opportunistic infection, 
pericarditis tuberculous, in the voclosporin group led to death. Incidences of opportunistic infections in 
AURORA 2 study were higher in voclosporin group compared to placebo group (5.2% vs 0.8%). This is 
adequately described in the SmPC. 
Malignancies occurred in 4 subjects in the pooled LN population, all of whom were in the voclosporin 
group (1.5%). Due to the rarity and diversity of observed malignancy cases, it is not possible to draw 
conclusions. Information on the risk for malignancy is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of MACE in the pooled LN population was lower in the 
voclosporin group (1.7 E/100 PYs ) than in the placebo group (2.1 E/100 PYs). 
At the CHMP’s request, the applicant will conduct a PASS to further characterise potential risks: 
malignancy, neurotoxicity, and chronic nephrotoxicity. The applicant is currently undertaking a 
feasibility assessment to determine the most appropriate design for this study in order to meet the 
required objectives. The duration of recruitment to the study will be determined by the market uptake 
of Lupkynis in Europe. It is planned to obtain up to 6 years of data from patients from the time of their 
initiating Lupkynis. A study protocol will be submitted to the EMA 3 months after the granting of MA for 
Lupkynis in the EU. This study is listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. 
Laboratory findings 
Renal parameters are discussed above.  
Regarding liver function, voclosporin is metabolised in the liver, primarily through the cytochrome P450 
(CYP) enzyme CYP3A4/5, and is predominantly eliminated through biliary. In the hepatic impairment 
study, voclosporin Cmax and AUC0-48 increased by 1.5-fold and 2.0-fold, respectively, in patients with 
mild and moderate hepatic impairment. In clinical studies, there seems to be minor effects of 
voclosporin on liver parameters. Although 1 patient in the voclosporin group met criteria for Hy´s Law, 
this patient was on concomitant hepatotoxic drugs (rifampicin) and causality with voclosporin seems 
Assessment report

Page 176/177 
 
 
 
 
 
less likely. In patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, 
respectively), the recommended starting dose is 15.8 mg twice daily. The effect of voclosporin in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) has not been assessed and is not 
recommended in this patient population. Relevant information is included in sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 
of the SmPC. 
Among serum electrolytes, hyperkalaemia was observed with a higher frequency among voclosporin-
treated patients than among patients treated with placebo. This is reflected in the SmPC.  
Among haematological parameters, a higher proportion of patients in the voclosporin group was 
reported with anaemia as an AE, and anaemia is proposed for inclusion in the SmPC section 4.8. 
Although diabetes is a class effect of the CNIs, mean increase from baseline to follow-up in glucose 
levels was lower in the voclosporin than in the placebo group.  
QT prolongation is a class effect of CNIs. The single dose finding QT study was positive, though steady-
state findings were negative. Also in the non-clinical and clinical studies, there have been signs of QT 
prolongation for voclosporin. This is reflected in the SmPC.  
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Lupkynis is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Preclinical studies have shown excretion of voclosporin/metabolites in milk. It is unknown whether 
voclosporin/metabolites are excreted in human milk (see also discussions in 2.4. ). Since voclosporin in 
LN is intended for use in combination with MMF, which is contraindicated during lactation, voclosporin 
is not expected to be used during breast-feeding unless MMF is discontinued.  
Section 4.6 of the SmPC states that: 
“Lupkynis is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.” 
“A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
Lupkynis therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.” 
Use in pregnancy is listed as missing information in the RMP. 
Interactions 
Voclosporin is metabolised by CYP3A4, is an inhibitor of P-gp and an OATP1B1 inhibitor. Based on DDI 
studies and safety data, there are restrictions in use of voclosporin with other inhibitors/ inducers/ 
substrates of respective enzyme or cell membrane protein/ transporter. Please refer to section 2.5.2. . 
Voclosporin is contraindicated in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. A warning is also proposed 
for inclusion in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Voclosporin should not be used in combination with cyclophosphamide, since there are no data to 
support such a combination. This is adequately reflected in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
An interaction study with statins is planned for (see recommendation in Section 2.5.4. ). Approximately 
one-third of subjects in the AURA-LV and AURORA 1 studies received concomitant treatment with 
statins and in these patients, there were no safety signals observed.  
Age 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 177/178 
 
 
 
There were only 2 subjects in the voclosporin group in the LN trials aged ≥ 65 years and no subjects 
aged 75 years or over. No conclusions can be drawn from this due to the very limited number of 
patients. In the plaque psoriasis and uveitis clinical programme, 47 subjects were aged 65 to 74 years 
and 10 subjects were aged 75 years and over. According to the applicant, the safety profile of 
voclosporin in subjects aged 65 years and over was consistent with that in the younger age groups and 
no new AEs of concern were seen. This is agreed by the CHMP.  
Overdose 
In response to day 120 LoQ, the wording in Section 4.9 of the SmPC was revised to distinguish 
overdose symptoms observed in voclosporin trials from other CNI class effects and to provide more 
detail around the treatment of overdose. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.10. Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety of voclosporin seems consistent with other calcineurin inhibitors, with predominantly 
infections, renal impairment and hypertension. Renal adverse events were observed more frequently in 
voclosporin-treated patients, than in patients treated with placebo. This is of concern because patients 
with LN are already at risk for development of renal failure, where an additive effect of LN and drug 
toxicity might enhance this risk. Furthermore, it can be difficult to distinguish between voclosporin-
caused toxicity and treatment failure. At the CHMP’s request, the applicant clarified that these renal 
adverse events were mostly due to decreases in GFR. Although this is still of concern, it is somewhat 
reassuring that these events were generally reversible. To date, there are no indications on irreversible 
renal damage caused by voclosporin. The risk for acute nephrotoxicity is considered possible to handle 
through careful monitoring of GFR, and dose reduction or treatment discontinuation if GFR is 
decreased. Adequate warnings and guidance on the monitoring have been included in the SmPC. 
At the CHMP’s request, the applicant has accepted to conduct an observational PASS in EU to further 
characterise and quantify long-term safety profile of Lupkynis to address the uncertainties regarding 
long term safety and more particularly the risks of Malignancy, Neurotoxicity and Nephrotoxicity. This 
study is included in the RMP as a category 3 study.

2.8. Product information 
2.8.1. User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2. Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lupkynis (voclosporin) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3. Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1. Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1. Disease or condition 
Voclosporin is a novel calcineurin inhibitor which is structurally similar to cyclosporine A except for the 
modification of a functional group on amino acid-1 of the molecule. The immunosuppressant activity 
results in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell cytokine production, and expression of T-cell 
activation surface antigens. 
The applicant applied for the following indication is “Lupkynis is indicated in combination with 
background immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of adult patients with active class III, IV 
or V (including mixed class III/V and IV/V) lupus nephritis (LN)”. 
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease which primarily affects women 
between the ages of 20 and 40 years. LN is the most common serious manifestation of SLE and is a 
debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition.  
LN is divided into different classes (I-VI) according to the International Society of Nephrology and the 
Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) 2003 Classification of LN [Weening et al 2004].  
In patients with LN, renal damage results in proteinuria and/or hematuria and a decrease in renal 
function as evidenced by reduced creatinine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).  
It is estimated that 10%-30% of patients with LN will develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the 
presence of which has been associated with a 26-fold increase in mortality risk compared with a 
demographically matched general population [Almaani et al 2017, Costenbader et al 2011, Tektonidou 
et al 2016, Yap et al 2012]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 181/182 
 
 
 
Proteinuria is the defining aspect of LN and indicates damage to the kidney; if not resolved this 
damage becomes permanent. A rapid reduction in proteinuria is, therefore, an important goal of 
treatment in LN [Fanouriakis et al 2020]. 
The overall aim of treatment is to achieve remission, in order to prevent future renal failure. 
3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of LN is based in large part on the histopathological classification. The proliferative classes 
(III and IV) require aggressive treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. Class V 
(membranous LN) is treated similarly to Classes III/IV if it is associated with nephrotic range 
proteinuria. In contrast, Classes I and II generally do not require immunosuppressive therapy and 
patients with Class VI LN are considered to be candidates for renal transplant [Fanouriakis et al 2020, 
Hahn et al 2012]. 
Initial treatment with immunosuppressive agents (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF 2 3 g/day] or 
intravenous low-dose cyclophosphamide [500 mg every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses]) in combination 
with corticosteroids are recommended for Class III (±Class V) and Class IV (±Class V) LN, with similar 
recommendations for pure Class V LN where it is associated with nephrotic range proteinuria. If 
improvement after initial treatment is achieved, subsequent immunosuppression is recommended with 
either MMF (1 2 g/day) or azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day). Although the EULAR guidelines were published 
prior to the approval of belimumab, they state that belimumab may be considered as add on 
treatment.  
Despite current treatment regimens, a significant proportion of LN patients develops end-stage renal 
disease. This, in combination with the toxicity of available treatment options, implies that there is an 
unmet medical need for new treatments in LN. 
3.1.3. Main clinical studies 
Four clinical studies are included for efficacy analysis in this application. Two phase 2 studies (AURION 
and AURA-LV), one pivotal phase 3 study (AURORA 1) and one long-term AURORA 1 continuation

The pivotal study AURORA 1 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter, 2-arm study of voclosporin versus matching placebo. Voclosporin at a 
dose of 23.7 mg BID or matching placebo were administered for 52 weeks with a background therapy 
of MMF and corticosteroids with a tapering schedule. Eligible subjects in the study were 18-75 years 
old with SLE and active, biopsy-proven lupus nephritis Class III, IV or V (or V in combination with III 
or IV). Primary efficacy endpoint was adjudicated renal response, a combined endpoint. To achieve the 
primary endpoint “renal response” the patient must have urine protein to creatine ration (UPCR) ≤0.5, 
eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or no confirmed decrease from baseline in eGFR of >20% and not have 
received any rescue treatment or more than 10 mg prednisone for ≥3 consecutive days or for ≥7 days 
in total during Weeks 44-52. A total of 375 patients were included in the study, 179 in the voclosporin 
group and 178 in the placebo group. 
3.2. Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint, adjudicated renal response at week 52, was achieved by 73/179 (40.8%) in the 
voclosporin group and 40/178 (22.5%) in the placebo group (OR 2.65; 95% CI: 1.64, 4.27; p<0.001).  
The results of the primary efficacy analysis are supported by two pre-specified sensitivity analyses 
(including only a term for treatment and omitting the regional covariate) and by two supplemental 
analyses (for the PP population and for the programmed renal response).  
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022

A tipping point analyses showed that if all voclosporin withdrawals were truly non-responders, 65% of 
placebo assumed non-responders would have to be truly responders in order for statistical significance 
to be lost. 
Consistent with the primary endpoint, the proportions of subjects achieving the key secondary 
outcomes (adjudicated renal response at Week 24, partial renal response at Week 24 and Week 52. 
time to UPCR ≤0.5 mg/mg and time to a 50% reduction in UPCR) were all in favour of voclosporin. 
Adjudicated renal response at Week 24 was achieved by 58/179 (32.4%) in the voclosporin group and 
35/178 (19.7%) in the placebo group (OR 2.23; 95% CI: 1.34, 3.72; p=0.002). 
Partial renal response (defined as a 50% reduction from baseline in UPCR) at Week 52 was achieved 
by 125/179 (69.8%) in the voclosporin group and 92/178 (51.7%) in the placebo group (OR 2.26; 
95% CI: 1.45, 3.51; p<0.001). 
Partial renal response at week 24 was achieved by 126/179 (70.4%) in the voclosporin group and 
89/179 (50%) in the placebo group (OR 2.43; 95% CI: 1.56, 3.79; p<0.001).  
The median time to UPCR ≤0.5 mg/mg was 169 days for voclosporin and 372 days for placebo (HR 
2.02; 95% CI: 1.51, 2.70; p<0.001). 
The median time to reach 50% reduction in UPCR was 29 days for voclosporin versus 63 days for 
placebo ( HR 2.05; 95% CI: 1.62, 2.60; p<0.001).  
Proportion of subjects on low dose steroids achieving renal response was higher in voclosporin arm 
compared to placebo arm at both Week 24 (OR 2.44, 95%CI 1.26, 4.71, p 0.008) and Week 52 (OR 
2.44, 95%CI 1.48, 4.00, p <.001). 
3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary endpoint renal response is a combined endpoint. The primary endpoint is not fully in line 
with the EMA GL, especially with respect to the eGFR value used to define “eGFR success” (or stable 
renal function). However, the presented results are considered as robust and are supporting a clinically 
relevant effect. 
More subjects in the voclosporin arm achieved a partial renal response at Week 24 and Week 52. Of 
the subjects who achieved a partial response at Week 24, a higher proportion of subjects in the 
voclosporin group than in the placebo group were adjudicated to have a renal response at Week 52 
(52.4% vs 39.3%). In addition, of the patients who did not achieve a renal or partial response at week 
24, a numerical higher proportion of patients in voclosporin group than placebo group achieved a 
partial or renal response at week 52 (around 40% vs 28%). This gives support for continuing 
treatment also in patients who do not fully respond at week 24 and since no additional stopping rules 
were identified (such as level of proteinuria), the decision to continue treatment beyond Week 24 in 
patients who may not have experienced a notable improvement in their disease after 6 months of 
treatment, are left to the treating physician’s judgement.  
A dose reduction or temporary interruption of treatment drug was done for patients 51.1% and for 
27.5% in the voclosporin and placebo groups, respectively. In most subjects, study treatment was 
resumed once the event resulting in a dose decrease/interruption had resolved. In the Voclosporin 
group, 57.2% of the patients did not resume to the full dose (28.6% stayed on 7.9 mg and 28.6% 
stayed on 15.8 mg). The response rates were lower in voclosporin subjects who ended the trial on 2 
capsules (9/26, 34%) or 1 capsule (7/26, 27%) BID.  
Almost half of the patients who achieved UPCR <0.5 in both groups had a secondary occurrence of 
UPCR > 0.5 (47.4 % in the placebo group and 45.7% in the voclosporin group). This implies that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 184/185 
 
 
 
reduction of proteinuria will not sustain for a significant number of patients. In addition, a total of 18 
subjects (10%) in each arm recorded a confirmed decrease of >30% from baseline in corrected eGFR 
during the study. More occurrences were reported during the second half of the treatment period. In 
the ITT-population from AURORA 1, the proportion of patients in renal response month 36 (AURORA 1 
and AURORA 2) was 33% (59/179) in the voclosporin group and 22% (39/178) in the placebo group. 
At the start of AURORA 2, 34/100 (34%) placebo subjects and 61/116 (52.6%) voclosporin subjects 
were in renal response. At month 36, 22/34 (64.7%) of the placebo subjects and 44/61 (72.1%) 
voclosporin subjects were still in renal response, indicating sustained remission (response both at the 
start of AURORA 2 and month 36) for the majority of the patients in both groups.  
An important issue is whether the benefit in renal functioning could be offset by a deleterious effect on 
other organs affected by the SLE disease. Only limited information with regards to the potential effects 
on different non-renal organ systems were provided by the applicant. Thus, it is uncertain whether the 
drug can have deleterious effects on other SLE target organs. However, based on the available data, it 
can be concluded that in patients with active LN and little extrarenal activity, voclosporin does not 
seem to be associated with a worsening of other SLE symptoms, as assessed with SELENA-SLEDAI 
score. 
3.4. Unfavourable effects 
The total exposure to voclosporin is 2,666 subjects, including 365 patients with LN. Of these, 116 
patients were exposed for 1 year in AURORA 1. In the follow up study, 101 of these patients were 
exposed to voclosporin for 36 months. 
Adverse events 
In the pooled LN population, the overall incidences of TEAEs were 91.4 vs 87.2% in voclosporin and 
placebo group, respectively. Serious AEs occurred in 22.8% voclosporin-treated participants compared 
to 18.8% in placebo group. 
The most commonly (≥10%) TEAEs reported in voclosporin group in the pooled LN population were 
GFR decreased (26.2% vs 9.4%), hypertension (19.1% vs 8.6%), diarrhoea (18.7% vs 13.2%), 
headache (15.0% vs 8.3%), anaemia (12.4% vs 6.0%), cough (10.9% vs 2.3%) and urinary tract 
infection (9.7% vs 6.4%). 
Adverse events leading to dose modification or temporary interruption and study treatment 
discontinuation 
The incidences of TEAEs that led to dose modification or temporary interruption were 46.1% in 
voclosporin group compared to 25.2% in placebo group. The incidences of TEAEs that led to study 
treatment discontinuation were 13.5% in voclosporin and 13.2% in placebo group. 
Deaths 
There were in total 23 deaths in the LN clinical studies (N=631), with exposure-adjusted incidences of 
2.3 E/100PYs in both the voclosporin and placebo groups. When looking at all TEAEs leading to death 
in pooled LN safety population (N=17/533), none of TEAEs stands out. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of particular interest in LN patients and/or the CNI class of drug were acute renal 
failure, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, calcineurin-inhibitor-related adverse events, 
opportunistic infections, and malignancies.

Acute renal failure occurred in 33.3% of voclosporin-treated subjects compared with 17.7% of placebo-
treated subjects during the first year of study treatment. According to the applicant, of these, 26.2% in 
the voclosporin group and 9.4% in the placebo group were managed effectively with dose interruption 
or modification.  
In total, 65 voclosporin subjects (36.5%) and 55 placebo subjects (30.9%) had at least 1 of the 
following events: 
Acute renal failure 
CKD event 
eGFR decreases ≥ 30% defined as 2 consecutive measures showing at least a 30% drop from baseline 
Of these subjects, 92.3% of voclosporin treated subjects recovered compared with 76.4% in the 
placebo group. 
The maximum mean decrease from baseline in corrected eGFR in the voclosporin group occurred at 
Week 4 and was -3.4 mL/min/1.73 m2. Mean GFR levels remained stable thereafter, and there were no 
signs of decreasing mean GFR levels over time in the AURORA 2 study up to 36 months. 
Hypertension occurred in 56 subjects in the voclosporin group (21.0%) and 28 subjects in the placebo 
group (10.5%). 
Malignancies occurred in 4 subjects in the pooled LN population, all of whom were in the voclosporin 
group (1.5%). No specific patter was observed with regards to malignancy type. 
The incidence of opportunistic infections was similar in the voclosporin (1.1%, 3 subjects) and placebo 
group (0.8%, 2 subjects) in the pooled LN population. Those were sporadic cases of cytomegalovirus 
(CMV chorioretinitis, CMV infection) and herpes virus family infections (herpes zoster cutaneous 
disseminated, herpes zoster disseminated, ophthalmic HSV).  
All those adverse events are adequately reflected in the SmPC. When relevant, appropriate guidance 
on how to handle them is provided.  
Safety in special populations 
Lupkynis is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Voclosporin is contraindicated in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Dose reduction is proposed in patients with mild and moderate impairment, and voclosporin is not 
recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
There are limited data in patients with impaired renal function (GFR<45 mL/min/1.73 m2). However, it 
is agreed that in certain patients with severe disease, use of Lupkynis might be justified despite 
GFR<45 with adequate monitoring and dose adjustments.  
All the information above is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Important potential long-term risks are renal toxicity, malignancy and neurotoxicity. Other important 
uncertainties pertain to adverse events with low frequency, given the rarity of the disease and the 
limited sise of the clinical studies. Even if 100 patients have been exposed for 36 months, some 
uncertainties remain with respect to long term safety. At the CHMP’s request, the applicant has 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 186/187 
 
 
 
accepted to conduct an observational PASS in EU to further characterise and quantify long-term safety 
profile of Lupkynis to address the uncertainties regarding long term safety and more particularly the 
risks of Malignancy, Neurotoxicity and Nephrotoxicity. This study is included in the RMP as a category 3 
study. 
Renal adverse events were observed more frequently in voclosporin-treated patients, than in patients 
treated with placebo. This is of concern because patients with LN are already at risk for development of 
renal failure and the additive effect of LN and drug toxicity might enhance this risk. Furthermore, it can 
be difficult to distinguish between voclosporin-caused toxicity and LN treatment failure. In response to 
day 120 LoQ, the applicant clarified that these renal adverse events were mostly due to early 
decreases in GFR. Although this is still of concern, it is reassuring that these events were generally 
reversible. It is noted that of the 65 voclosporin-treated subjects with at least 1 of the following 
events: acute renal failure, CKD, or eGFR decreases ≥ 30%, 92.3% recovered. Of the 5 subjects who 
did not recover to within 20% of the baseline eGFR, 4 had clear disease progression/LN flare and 1 
subject had a partial recovery in eGFR levels, although recovery was to less than 20% of baseline. 
Thus, it is agreed that this safety issue can be handled through careful monitoring of GFR, and dose 
reduction or treatment discontinuation if GFR is decreased. Adequate warning and recommendations 
have been included in the SmPC. 
AURORA 2 includes a biopsy substudy, in which 18 voclosporin subjects and 15 placebo subjects had 
second biopsies taken. Although the results were requested, no biopsy results could be provided 
because of a delay in the interpretation of the biopsies due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to 
the AURORA 2 CSR these biopsies should have been performed 6 months after entry in the AURORA 2 
study. Of the 216 patients who entered the AURORA 2 study, the majority (186/216 patients) had 
completed 36 months of treatment (i.e. had completed 24 months in the AURORA 2 study). Therefore, 
most of these biopsies should have been performed >18 months ago. Although it is understandable if 
all analyses (such as gene expression and immune markers) might be time consuming, at least 
preliminary histological results should be available. to the applicant will present the final results in 
December 2022. The AURORA 2 biopsy substudy is included as a category 3 study in the RMP.  
Due to limited long-term follow-up, it is still not clear whether voclosporin like other calcineurin 
inhibitors is associated with a risk for renal fibrosis after many years of treatment. To date, there are 
no indications on irreversible renal damage caused by voclosporin but this will be an important issue to 
follow through post-approval data collection (PSUR and PASS).  
There are no clinical data on pregnancy or lactation. Voclosporin is proposed with concomitant MMF 
with a known teratogenic effect, limiting the possibilities to gain further data. 
Repeated-dose animal studies have shown neurohistological findings of gliosis and perivascular 
infiltrates in the brain and spinal cord in rats, but not in dogs or monkeys. Data in human is too limited 
for a reliable assessment of this risk. This finding is adequately reflected in Section 5.3 of the SmPC.

3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects 
LN is the most common serious manifestation of SLE and is a debilitating and potentially life-
threatening condition. Proteinuria is the defining aspect of LN and indicates damage to the kidney; if 
not resolved this damage becomes permanent. A rapid reduction in proteinuria is, therefore, an 
important goal of treatment in LN.  
The pivotal phase 3 AURORA 1 used a composite primary endpoint, renal response at week 52. This 
endpoint includes a strict definition regarding the amount of proteinuria allowed to be a responder (i.e 
UPCR ≤0.5). This is a clinically relevant measurement since a reduction in proteinuria to levels below 
0.5-0.7 has been associated with improved renal survival. Also the key secondary endpoints reflect 
different aspects of reducing proteinuria.  
In the AURORA 1 study, the results seen for the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints were 
highly significant and robustly showed that voclosporin together with MMF+ corticosteroid reduce 
proteinuria faster and more effectively (i.e to a lower level) than MMF+ corticosteroids alone. Also, 
when renal response was analysed with a stricter eGFR definition of stable renal function “no confirmed 
decrease from baseline of >10% in corrected eGFR”, 34.6% in the voclosporin group and 21.3% in the 
placebo group achieved a renal response. Although based on a complementary analyse, this finding is 
reassuring and provide additional information that a response is seen also when aiming for complete 
renal remission.

The study protocol requested a rather fast corticosteroid tapering schedule with a reduction to ≤2.5 mg 
at week 16. A majority of the patients in both groups were able to reduce their steroids to these levels. 
Taken into account the well-known adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid treatment, it is an 
important finding that the rate of renal response at week 52 in patients with a low corticosteroid dose 
were also favouring voclosporin. 
A treatment benefit of voclosporin was seen across all pre-specified subgroups, including black 
participants, males and participants with Class V LN in the pivotal study. There were however only a 
few treatment-naive patients included and detailed clinical data regarding refractory or relapsing 
patients were not collected in the study, making an evaluation of efficacy in these patients difficult. 
However, it is anticipated that a response, with decrease of proteinuria and a similar safety profile will 
be achieved also when treating a first active LN episode. 
Voclosporin was not studied in combination with other immunosuppressive therapies than MMF. There 
is a major concern that the risk of infections and nephrotoxicity could be elevated when combined with 
other immunosuppressants, especially cyclophosphamide. Thus, the indication is restricted to 
combination with mycophenolate mofetil only. At the CHMP’s request, the applicant also accepted to 
revised their claimed indication to reflect that the treatment is indicated in LN patients with active 
disease. 
Importance of unfavourable effects 
Class effects of calcineurin inhibitors include increased blood pressure, acute renal vasomotor effects 
and renal fibrosis. Other adverse effects associated with CNIs include neurotoxicity, electrolyte 
disturbances, impaired glucose tolerance and new-onset diabetes mellitus, and, like all 
immunosuppressants, infections and malignancies. 
The safety of voclosporin seems consistent with other calcineurin inhibitors, with predominantly 
infections, renal impairment and hypertension. These are considered possible to handle through 
information in the SmPC. This information is included in the SmPC. 
It is worth noting that the risk of malignancy, infection and cardiovascular events is already increased 
in SLE patients. 
The most important safety concern is the risk for nephrotoxicity. Acute and chronic renal toxicity are 
known risks associated with calcineurin inhibitors. The efficacy of voclosporin is mainly driven by a 
reduction in proteinuria, which is acknowledged as a predictor of preserved long-term renal function. 
However, the nephrotoxic effect of voclosporin might negatively affect the long-term prognosis. A 
mean decrease in GFR was noted from baseline in the voclosporin group. Although this decrease was 
small on a group level it might be serious in individual cases and have a significant impact, especially if 
the decrease is persistent. Furthermore, adverse events of acute and chronic renal failure were 
observed more frequently in voclosporin-treated patients, than in patients treated with placebo. 
Patients with LN are already at risk for development of renal failure and an additive effect of LN and 
drug toxicity might enhance this risk. Another aspect is that it will be difficult to distinguish between 
voclosporin-caused toxicity and treatment failure, which is important because of different treatment 
approaches.  
At the CHMP’s request, the applicant clarified that these renal adverse events were mostly due to early 
decreases in GFR. Although this is still of concern, it is somewhat reassuring that these events were 
generally reversible. The CHMP agreed that this safety issue can be handled through careful monitoring 
of GFR, and dose reduction or treatment discontinuation if GFR is decreased. Adequate information the 
risk and recommendations for monitoring have been included in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/681286/2022  
Page 190/191 
 
 
 
Long-term safety data are limited, and the potential long-term risks associated with voclosporin use, 
mainly nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and malignancy, needs to be further characterised post approval. 
At the CHMP’s request, the applicant has accepted to conduct an observational PASS in EU to further 
characterise and quantify long-term safety profile of Lupkynis to address the uncertainties regarding 
long term safety and more particularly the risks of Malignancy, Neurotoxicity and Nephrotoxicity. This 
study is included in the RMP as a category 3 study. A feasibility assessment and updated protocol will 
be submitted after approval. 
3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy results show superiority of voclosporin 
23.7 mg BID to matching placebo for 52 weeks with a background therapy of MMF and corticosteroids 
in adult patients diagnosed with LN. Efficacy results are robust. Internal validity of the main study 
appears to be high. 
Voclosporin safety profile can be characterised as serious and complex. An extensive monitoring of 
patients is required, and dose modifications due to ADRs are needed. The most important safety 
concern for voclosporin is the risk for nephrotoxicity, which is considered possible to handle through 
careful monitoring of GFR, and dose reduction or treatment discontinuation if GFR is decreased. 
Adequate information on risks and recommendations for monitoring have been included in the SmPC. 
In addition, at the CHMP’s request, the applicant has accepted to conduct an observational PASS in EU 
to further characterise and quantify long-term safety profile of Lupkynis. 
3.8. Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Lupkynis is positive. 
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Lupkynis is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Lupkynis is indicated in combination with mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of adult patients 
with active class III, IV or V (including mixed class III/V and IV/V) lupus nephritis (LN). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2.) 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive

2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted:

CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Menveo is indicated for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults 
at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults 
Menveo should be administered as a single dose (0.5 mL). 
To ensure optimal antibody levels against all vaccine serogroups, the primary vaccination schedule 
with Menveo should be completed one month prior to risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis 
groups A, C, W-135 and Y. Bactericidal antibodies (hSBA≥1:8) were observed in at least 64% of 
subjects at 1 week post vaccination (see section 5.1 for immunogenicity data per individual 
serogroups).

Older people 
There are limited data in individuals aged 56-65 and there are no data in individuals aged >65 years. 
Booster vaccination 
Long-term antibody persistence data following vaccination with Menveo are available up to 5 years 
after vaccination (see section 4.4 and 5.1). 
Menveo may be given as a booster dose in subjects who have previously received primary vaccination 
with Menveo, other conjugated meningococcal vaccine or meningococcal unconjugated 
polysaccharide vaccine. The need for and timing of a booster dose in subjects previously vaccinated 
with Menveo is to be defined based on national recommendations. 
Paediatric population (under 2 years of age) 
The safety and efficacy of Menveo in children under 2 years of age has not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can 
be made. 
Method of administration 
Menveo is given as an intramuscular injection, preferably into the deltoid muscle. 
It must not be administered intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. 
Separate injection sites must be used if more than one vaccine is being administered at the same time. 
For instructions on preparation and reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, 
see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, or diphtheria 
toxoid (CRM197), or a life-threatening reaction after previous administration of a vaccine containing 
similar components (see section 4.4). 
As with other vaccines, Menveo should be postponed in individuals suffering from an acute severe 
febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Before the injection of any vaccine, the person responsible for administration must take all precautions 
known for the prevention of allergic or any other reactions including thorough medical history and 
current health status. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision 
must always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following administration of the 
vaccine. 
Anxiety
related 
related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress
reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection 
‐
(see section 4.8 Undesirable effects). It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from 
fainting. 
‐
Menveo should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. 
Menveo will not protect against infections caused by any other serogroups of N. meningitidis not 
present in the vaccine.

As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees 
(see section 5.1). 
Studies with Menveo have shown a waning of serum bactericidal antibody titers against serogroup A 
when using human complement in the assay (hSBA) (see section 5.1). The clinical relevance of the 
waning of hSBA serogroup A antibody titers is unknown. If an individual is expected to be at 
particular risk of exposure to Men A and received a dose of Menveo more than approximately one 
year previously, consideration may be given to administering a booster dose. 
There are no data on the applicability of the vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis. 
In immunocompromised individuals, vaccination may not result in an appropriate protective antibody 
response. While Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is not a contraindication, Menveo 
has not been specifically evaluated in immunocompromised people. Individuals with complement 
deficiencies and individuals with functional or anatomical asplenia may not mount an immune 
response to meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccines. 
Individuals with familial complement deficiencies (for example, C3 or C5 deficiencies) and 
individuals receiving treatments that inhibit terminal complement activation (for example, 
eculizumab) are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis group A, C, 
W-135 and Y, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination with Menveo. 
Menveo has not been evaluated in persons with thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorders or that are 
receiving anticoagulant therapy, because of the risk of haematoma. The risk-benefit ratio for persons 
at risk of haematoma following intramuscular injection must be evaluated by health care professionals. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say 
essentially ‘potassium-free’. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Menveo can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: monovalent and combined 
hepatitis A and B, yellow fever, typhoid fever (Vi polysaccharide), Japanese encephalitis, rabies and 
meningococcal group B (Bexsero). 
In adolescents (11 to 18 years of age), Menveo has been evaluated in two co-administration studies 
with either Tetanus, Reduced Diphtheria and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed (Tdap) alone or 
Tdap and Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant 
(HPV), both of which support the co-administration of the vaccines. 
There was no evidence of an increased rate of reactogenicity or change in the safety profile of the 
vaccines in either study. Antibody responses to Menveo and the diphtheria, tetanus or HPV vaccine 
components were not negatively affected by co-administration. 
The administration of Menveo one month after Tdap resulted in statistically significantly lower 
serogroup W-135 seroresponses. Since there was no direct impact on the seroprotection rate, 
the clinical consequences are presently unknown. There was evidence of some suppression of antibody 
response to two of the three pertussis antigens. The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. 
After vaccination, over 97% of subjects had detectable pertussis titers to all three pertussis antigens. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For children 2 to 10 years of age, no data are available for evaluating safety and immunogenicity 
of other childhood vaccines when administered concomitantly with Menveo. 
Concomitant administration of Menveo and other vaccines than those listed above has not been 
studied. Concomitant vaccines should always be administered at separate injection sites and preferably 
contralateral. It should be checked if the adverse reactions may be intensified by any 
co-administration. 
If a vaccine recipient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment, the immunological response may 
be diminished. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Insufficient clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. 
In non-clinical studies, Menveo had no direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, 
embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development. Considering the severity of 
invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, 
pregnancy should not preclude vaccination when the risk of exposure is clearly defined. 
Although insufficient clinical data on the use of Menveo during breast-feeding are available, it is 
unlikely that secreted antibodies in milk would be harmful when ingested by a breastfed infant. 
Therefore, Menveo may be used during breast feeding. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. Dizziness has 
been very rarely reported following vaccination. This may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use 
machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing 
seriousness. 
Frequencies are defined as follows: 
Very common:

Adverse reactions from clinical trials 
Children 2 to 10 years of age 
Overall 3464 subjects aged 2 to10 years were exposed to Menveo in completed clinical trials. The 
characterization of the safety profile of Menveo in children 2 to 10 years of age is based on data from 
four clinical trials in which 3181 subjects received Menveo. 
The most common adverse reactions during the clinical trials generally persisted for one to two days 
and were not severe. These adverse reactions were: 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders: 
Common: eating disorder

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: 
Common: rash 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 
Common: myalgia, arthralgia 
General disorders and administration site conditions: 
Very common: irritability, malaise, injection site pain, injection site erythema (≤50 mm), injection site 
induration (≤50 mm) 
Common: injection site erythema (>50mm), injection site induration (>50mm), chills, fever ≥38oC 
Uncommon: injection site pruritus 
Individuals 11 to 65 years of age 
The characterization of the safety profile of Menveo in adolescents and adults is based on data from 
five randomised controlled clinical trials including 6401 participants (from 11-65 years of age) who 
received Menveo. Among Menveo recipients, 58.9%, 16.4%, 21.3% and 3.4% were in the 11-18 year, 
19-34 year, 35-55 year and 56-65 year age groups, respectively. The two primary safety studies were 
randomised, active-controlled trials that enrolled participants aged 11 to 55 years (N=2663) 
and 19 to 55 years (N=1606), respectively. 
The incidence and severity of any, local, systemic, and other reactions were generally similar in the 
Menveo groups across all studies and within the adolescent and adult age groups. The reactogenicity 
profile and rates of adverse events among subjects aged 56-65 years who received Menveo (N=216), 
were similar to that observed in Menveo recipient subjects aged 11-55. 
The most common local and systemic adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were pain at the 
injection site and headache. 
The list provided below presents adverse reactions reported in three pivotal and two supportive clinical 
trials per system organ class. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials usually 
lasted only one to two days and were not usually severe.

Immunogenicity 
The efficacy of Menveo has been inferred by measuring the production of serogroup-specific 
anti-capsular antibodies with bactericidal activity. Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was measured 
using human serum as the source of exogenous complement (hSBA). The hSBA was the original 
correlate of protection against meningococcal disease. 
Immunogenicity was evaluated in randomised, multicenter, active controlled clinical trials that 
enrolled children (2-10 years of age), adolescents (11-18 years of age), adults (19-55 years of age) 
and older adults (56-65 years of age). 
Immunogenicity in children 2 to 10 years of age 
In the pivotal study V59P20 immunogenicity of Menveo was compared to ACWY-D; 1170 children 
were vaccinated with Menveo and 1161 received the comparator vaccine in the per protocol 
populations. In two supportive studies V59P8 and V59P10 immunogenicity of Menveo was compared 
to ACWY-PS. 
In the pivotal, randomised, observer-blind study V59P20, in which participants were stratified by age 
(2 through 5 years and 6 through 10 years), the immunogenicity of a single dose of Menveo one month 
post vaccination was compared with the single dose of ACWY-D. Immunogenicity results one month 
after Menveo vaccination among subjects aged 2-5 years and 6-10 years are summarized below 
in Table 1

In another randomised, observer-blind study (V59P8) US children were immunized with a single dose 
of either Menveo (N=284) or ACWY-PS (N=285). In the children 2-10 years of age, as well as in each 
age strata (2-5 and 6-10 years), immune response as measured by percentage of subjects with 
seroresponse, hSBA≥1:8 and GMTs were not only non-inferior to comparator vaccine ACWY-PS, 
but all were statistically higher than the comparator for all serogroups and all immune measurements 
at 1 month post vaccination. At 1 year post vaccination, Menveo continued to be statistically higher 
than ACWY-PS for serogroups A, W-135 and Y, as measured by percentage of subjects with 
hSBA≥1:8 and GMTs. Menveo was non-inferior on these endpoints for serogroup C (Table 2). 
The clinical relevance of higher post-vaccination immune responses is not known.

In a randomised, observer-blind study (V59P10) conducted in Argentina, children were 
immunized with a single dose of either Menveo (N=949) or ACWY-PS (N=551). Immunogenicity 
was assessed in a subset of 150 subjects in each vaccine group. The immune response observed in 
the children 2-10 years of age was very similar to those observed in the V59P8 study shown above: 
immune response to Menveo at 1 month post vaccination, as measured by percentage of subjects 
with seroresponse, hSBA≥1:8 and GMTs, was non-inferior to ACWY-PS. 
A randomised, observer-blind study was conducted in children 12 to 59 months of age in Finland 
and Poland (V59P7). A total of 199 subjects 2-5 years of age were in the Menveo per protocol 
immunogenicity population and 81 subjects 3-5 years of age were in the ACWY-PS group. 
At 1 month post-first vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 were consistently 
higher in the Menveo group for all four serogroups (63% vs 39%, 46% vs 39%, 78% vs 59%, and 65% 
vs 57% for Menveo as compared to ACWY-PS for serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, respectively). 
In a randomized, observer-blind study (V59_57) conducted in US, immunogenicity of a 2-dose series 
and a single dose of Menveo was compared in children 2 through 5 and 6 through 10 years of age 
(N=715). 
At baseline, the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 across the two age strata was 1%-5% for 
serogroup A, 13%-28% for serogroup C, 42%-64% for serogroup W-135, and 6%-19% for serogroup 
Y. At 1 month post last vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 in the 2-dose group 
and in the single dose group across the two age strata were: 90%-95% vs 76%–80% for serogroup A, 
98%-99% vs 76%-87% for serogroup C, 99% vs 93%-96% for serogroup W-135, and 96% vs 65%-
69% for serogroup Y. GMTs were higher in the 2-dose group than the single dose group at 1 month 
after vaccination in both age strata; however, this difference was less pronounced in the older age 
stratum. 
At 1 year post last vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 after the 2-dose series and 
the single dose were both lower than at 1 month post-vaccination (30% after the 2-dose series, 11%-
20% after the single dose for serogroup A; 61%-81% and 41%-55% for serogroup C; 92%-94% and 
90%-91% for serogroup W-135; 67%-75% and 57%-65% for serogroup Y). The differences between 
hSBA GMTs in the 2-dose and the single dose groups at 1 year after vaccination were lower than 
those seen at 1 month post-vaccination. 
The clinical benefit of a 2-dose vaccination series in children 2 through 10 years of age is not known.

Persistence of immune response and booster response in children 2 to 10 years of age 
Antibody persistence at 5 years after primary vaccination was assessed in study V59P20E1, this was 
an extension of study V59P20. There was antibody persistence observed against serogroups C, W-135 
and Y, with the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 being 32% and 56% against serogroup C in 
subjects 2-5 and 6-10 years of age, respectively, 74% and 80% against serogroup W-135, and 48% and 
53% against serogroup Y.  GMTs were respectively 6.5 and 12 for serogroup C, 19 and 26 for 
serogroup W-135, and 8.13 and 10 for serogroup Y. For serogroup A, 14% and 22% of subjects 2-5 
and 6-10 years of age, respectively, had hSBA ≥ 1:8 (GMTs 2.95 and 3.73).  
The children also received a booster dose of Menveo, 5 years after a single dose primary vaccination. 
All subjects in both age groups had hSBA ≥ 1:8 across all serogroups, with antibody titers several fold 
higher than seen after the primary vaccination (Table 3).

Immunogenicity in individuals 11 years of age and above 
In the pivotal study (V59P13), adolescents or adults received either a dose of Menveo (N = 2649) 
comparator vaccine ACWY-D (N = 875). Sera were obtained both before vaccination and 1 month 
after vaccination. 
In another study (V59P6) conducted in 524 adolescents, the immunogenicity of Menveo was 
compared to that of ACWY-PS. 
Immunogenicity in adolescents 
In the 11-18 year old population of the pivotal study, V59P13, the immunogenicity of a single dose of 
Menveo one month post vaccination is compared with the ACWY-D. Immunogenicity results at one 
month after Menveo are summarized below in Table 4.

In the subset of subjects aged 11-18 years who were seronegative at baseline (hSBA < 1:4), 
the proportion of subjects who achieved a hSBA ≥ 1:8 after a dose of Menveo were as follows: 
serogroup A 75% (780/1039); serogroup C 80% (735/923); serogroup W-135 94% (570/609); 
serogroup Y 81% (510/630). 
In the non-inferiority study, V59P6, immunogenicity was assessed among adolescents 
aged 11-17 years who had been randomised to receive either Menveo or ACWY-PS. Menveo was 
shown to be non-inferior to ACWY-PS vaccine for all four serogroups (A, C, W-135 and Y) based on 
seroresponse, proportions achieving hSBA ≥1:8, and GMTs.

At one year post vaccination in these same subjects, compared with ACWY-PS, a higher proportion of 
subjects vaccinated with Menveo had hSBA ≥1:8 for serogroups C, W-135, and Y, with comparable 
levels for serogroup A. Similar findings were observed in the comparison of hSBA GMTs. 
Persistence of immune response and booster response in adolescents 
In study V59P13E1, the persistence of immune responses against serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y was 
assessed at 21 months, 3 years and 5 years post primary vaccination among subjects aged 11-18 years 
at the time of vaccination. The percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 remained constant against 
serogroups C, W-135, and Y from 21 months to 5 years postvaccination in the Menveo group and 
decreased slightly over time against serogroup A (Table 6). At 5 years after primary vaccination, there 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were significantly higher percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 in the Menveo group than in the 
vaccine-naive control subjects against all the four serogroups.

A booster dose of Menveo was administered 3 years after primary vaccination with Menveo or 
ACWY-D. Both groups showed a robust response to the booster dose of Menveo at one month after 
vaccination (100% of subjects had hSBA ≥ 1:8 across serogroups) and this response largely persisted 
through 2 years after the booster dose for serogroups C, W-135 and Y (with 87% to 100% of subjects 
with hSBA ≥ 1:8 across serogroups). A small decline was observed in percentages of subjects with 
hSBA ≥ 1:8 against serogroup A, although percentages were still high (77% to 79%). GMTs declined 
over time as expected but remained between 2- and 8-fold higher than prebooster values (Table 8). 
In study V59P6E1, at one year post vaccination, the percentage of Menveo recipients with hSBA 
≥ 1:8 remained significantly higher compared with ACWY-PS recipients for serogroups C, W-135 and 
Y, and similar between the two study groups for serogroup A. hSBA GMTs for serogroups W-135 and 
Y were higher among Menveo recipients. In 5 years post vaccination, the percentage of Menveo 
recipients with hSBA ≥ 1:8 remained significantly higher compared with ACWY-PS recipients for 
serogroups C and Y. Higher hSBA GMTs were observed for serogroups W-135 and Y (Table 7).

A booster dose of Menveo was administered 5 years after primary vaccination with Menveo or 
ACWY-PS. At 7 days after the booster dose, 98%-100% of subjects who previously received Menveo 
and 73%-84% of subjects who previously received ACWY-PS achieved hSBA ≥1:8 against 
serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. At one month post vaccination, the percentages of subjects with 
hSBA≥1:8 were 98%-100% and 84%-96%, respectively. 
A significant increase in the hSBA GMTs against all four serogroups was also observed 
at 7 and 28 days after the booster dose (Table 8).

Immunogenicity in adults 
In the pivotal immunogenicity trial, V59P13, immune responses to Menveo were assessed among 
adults aged 19 to 55 years. Results are presented in Table 9. In the subset of subjects aged 19-55 years 
who were seronegative at baseline, the proportion of subjects who achieved a hSBA ≥ 1:8 after a dose 
of Menveo were as follows: serogroup A 67% (582/875); serogroup C 71% (401/563); serogroup W-
135 82% (131/160); serogroup Y 66% (173/263).

The onset of immune response after the primary vaccination with Menveo in healthy 
subjects 18 through 22 years of age was evaluated in study V59P6E1. At 7 days post vaccination, 64% 
of subjects achieved hSBA ≥1:8 against serogroup A and 88% through 90% of subjects had 
bactericidal antibodies against serogroups C, W-135 and Y. At one month post vaccination, 92% 
through 98% of subjects had hSBA ≥1:8 against serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. A robust immune 
response as measured by hSBA GMTs against all serogroups was also observed at 7 days 
(GMTs 34 through 70) and 28 days (GMTs 79 through 127) after a single dose vaccination. 
Immunogenicity in older adults 
The comparative immunogenicity of Menveo vs. ACWY-PS was evaluated in subjects 
aged 56-65 years, in study V59P17. The proportion of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:8 was non-inferior to 
ACWY-PS for all four serogroups and statistically superior for serogroups A and Y (Table 10).

The immunogenicity of Menveo in children 2 to 23 months of age was evaluated in several studies. 
Although a high percentage of subjects achieved hSBA titers above 1:8 following 4-dose series of 
Menveo, with lower percentages in studies of 2-dose series and of a single dose, Menveo was

response at least equivalent to a monovalent conjugated serotype C vaccine (after a single dose at the 
age of 12 months). Currently available data are not sufficient to establish the efficacy of Menveo in 
children under 2 years of age. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional repeated-dose and 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. 
In laboratory animals, no adverse reactions were seen in vaccinated maternal rabbits or in their 
offspring through postnatal day 29. 
No effects on fertility were observed in female rabbits receiving Menveo pre-mating and during 
pregnancy.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Menveo is and what it is used for 
Menveo is a vaccine that is used for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), 
adolescents and adults at risk of exposure to a bacterium named Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, 
C, W-135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. The vaccine works by causing your body to make its 
own protection (antibodies) against these bacteria. 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria can cause serious and sometimes 
life-threatening infections such as meningitis and sepsis (blood poisoning). 
Menveo cannot cause bacterial meningitis. This vaccine contains a protein (called CRM197) from 
the bacteria that cause diphtheria. Menveo does not protect against diphtheria. This means that 
you (or your child) should receive other vaccines to protect against diphtheria when these are due 
or when advised by your doctor. 
2.  What you need to know before you or your child are given Menveo 
Do not use Menveo if you or your child has:  
ever had an allergic reaction to the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this 
ever had an allergic reaction to diphtheria toxoid (a substance used in a number of other 
- 
vaccine (listed in section 6) 
- 
vaccines) 
- 
cold) itself is not a reason to delay vaccination. 
an illness with high fever. However, a mild fever or upper respiratory infection (for example 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions: 
have a weakened immune system. Little is known about the effectiveness of Menveo when 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you or your child are given Menveo if you or your child:  
- 
administered to individuals with weakened immunity due to the use of immunosuppressive 
medications, or HIV infection, and other possible causes. It is possible that the effectiveness 
of Menveo could be reduced in such individuals. 
- 
persons receiving blood thinners (anticoagulants). 
receive treatment that blocks the part of the immune system known as complement activation, 
- 
such as eculizumab. Even if you have been vaccinated with Menveo you remain at increased risk of 
disease caused by the Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W-135 and Y bacteria. 
have haemophilia or any other problem that may stop your blood from clotting properly, such as 
Fainting, feeling faint or other stress-related reactions can occur as a response to any needle injection. 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have experienced this kind of reaction previously. 
This vaccine can only protect against meningococcal group A, C, W-135, and Y bacteria. It cannot 
protect against other types of meningococcal bacteria other than groups A, C, W-135 and Y, or against 
other causes of meningitis and sepsis (blood poisoning). 
As with any vaccine, Menveo may not fully protect 100% of those who get the vaccine. 
If you or your child received a dose of Menveo more than one year ago and remains at particular 
risk of exposure to meningococcal group A bacteria, consideration may be given to administering 
a booster dose to maintain protection. Your doctor will advise you if and when you should receive 
a booster dose. 
Other medicines and Menveo 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Menveo may be given at the same time as other vaccinations but any other injected vaccines should 
preferably be given into a different arm from the site of the Menveo injection. 
These include the following vaccines: tetanus, reduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap), 
human papillomavirus (HPV), yellow fever, typhoid fever (Vi polysaccharide), Japanese encephalitis, 
rabies, hepatitis A and B and meningococcal group B (Bexsero). 
Menveo’s effect could be diminished when administered to individuals who are taking medicines that 
suppress the immune system. 
Separate injection sites must be used if more than one vaccine is being administered at the same time. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before this medicine is given. Your doctor or nurse may still recommend that 
you receive Menveo if you are at high risk of infection with meningococcal group A, C, W-135 and Y 
bacteria. 
Driving and using machines  
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
Dizziness has been very rarely reported following vaccination. This may temporarily affect the ability 
to drive or use machines.

Menveo contains 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 
‘potassium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Menveo 
Menveo will be given to you or your child by a doctor or nurse. 
The vaccine is usually given into the upper arm muscle (deltoid) for children (from 2 years of age), 
adolescents and adults. Your doctor or nurse will take care to ensure the vaccine is not given into 
a blood vessel and will make sure that it is injected into muscle and not into the skin. 
For children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults: a single (0.5 mL) injection will be given. 
The safety and efficacy of Menveo in children under 2 years of age has not yet been established. There 
are limited data in individuals aged 56-65 and there are no data in subjects aged older than 65 years. 
Please tell your doctor if you have received a previous injection with Menveo or another 
meningococcal vaccine. Your doctor will tell you if you need an additional injection of Menveo. 
For information on the reconstitution of the vaccine see the section for medical or healthcare 
professionals at the end of this leaflet. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Reconstitution of the vaccine 
Menveo must be prepared for administration by reconstituting the powder with the solution. 
The contents in the two different vials (MenA powder and MenCWY solution) are to be mixed prior to 
vaccination providing 1 dose of 0.5 mL. 
Using a syringe and suitable needle (21G, 40 mm length or 21 G, 1 ½ inch length), withdraw the entire 
contents of the vial of solution and inject into the vial of powder to reconstitute the MenA conjugate 
component. 
Invert and shake the vial vigorously and then withdraw 0.5 mL of reconstituted product. Please note 
that it is normal for a small amount of liquid to remain in the vial following withdrawal of the dose. 
Prior to injection, change the needle with one suitable for the administration. Ensure that no air 
bubbles are present in the syringe before injecting the vaccine. 
Following reconstitution, the vaccine is a clear, colourless to light yellow solution, free from visible 
foreign particles. In the event of any foreign particulate matter and/or variation of physical aspect 
being observed, discard the vaccine. 
Menveo is given as an intramuscular injection, preferably into the deltoid muscle. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

1.  Introduction 
On 28 June 2016, the MAH submitted the final report for an Infanrix-IPV study in which Rotarix 
lyophilised formulation is one of the coadministered vaccines, in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Study DTPA-IPV (INFANRIXIPV)-059 (114260) was a phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre 
study to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of the combined DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine 
administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2-4-6 months of age in healthy subjects in 
South Korea. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study DTPA-IPV (INFANRIXIPV)-059 is a stand alone study.  
The main objective of the study was to demonstrate that the immunogenicity of DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine 
(“combo” registered as Infanrix-IPV/Hib in some countries) administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age 
was non-inferior to that of the concomitant but separate administration of DTPa-IPV (Infanrix-IPV) and 
Hib (Hiberix) vaccines, in terms of immune response to all vaccine antigens, one month after the third 
dose of the primary vaccination. 
Rotarix and Synflorix were administered in the study as part of the local recommended immunization 
schedule, and in a staggered manner. Rotarix was administered orally at 6 weeks and 3.5 months of 
age. Synflorix (10Pn-PD-DiT) was administered at 6 weeks, 3.5 months and 5.5 months of age.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The commercially available formulation of Rotarix was used in the study. Lot numbers for Rotarix and 
Diluent were AROTA217A and AD05A657A, resp. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study DTPA-IPV (INFANRIXIPV)-059 (114260) was a phase III, randomised, open-label, 
multicentre study to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of the combined DTPa-
IPV/Hib vaccine administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2-4-6 months of age in 
healthy subjects in South Korea. 
This study did not generate immunogenicity data of Rotarix. The safety follow-up of these vaccinations 
was limited to the collection of serious adverse events.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
DTPA-IPV (INFANRIXIPV)-059 (114260) was a phase III, randomised, open-label, 
multicentre study to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of the combined 
DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2-4-6 
months of age in healthy subjects in South Korea. 
Description 
This was a phase III, multi-center, open-label, randomized, controlled trial with 2 study groups. 
Rotarix was one of the vaccines that were co-administered during this study. 
The first subject was enrolled on 04 March 2011 and the last study visit was on 24 February 2012. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary: 
Immunogenicity 
To demonstrate that the immunogenicity of DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine administered at 2, 4 and 6 months 
of age was non-inferior to that of the concomitant administration of DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines, in 
terms of immune response to all vaccine antigens, one month after the third dose of the primary 
vaccination. 
Non-inferiority was to be demonstrated if: 
- the upper limits of the standardized asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI) on the group differences 
[Control Group minus Combo Group] in percentages of subjects seroprotected against diphtheria, 
tetanus, poliovirus type 1, poliovirus type 2, poliovirus type 3 and Hib were all ≤ 10%, and, 
- the upper limits of the 95% CI on the group ratios [Control Group divided by Combo Group] of 
geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of antibodies against pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous 
haemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN) were all ≤ 1.5. 
Secondary: 
Immunogenicity 
• 
The immune response to the DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine versus the DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines 
administered separately was to be assessed, in terms of seroprotection/ seropositivity and 
antibody geometric mean concentrations/titres (GMCs/GMTs) to all antigens and in terms of 
vaccine response to pertussis antigens one month after the third dose of primary vaccination. 
Safety 
• 
• 
The safety and reactogenicity of the DTPa-IPV/Hib, DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines were to be 
assessed, in terms of solicited local and general symptoms. 
The safety of all study vaccines was to be assessed in terms of unsolicited adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).

Study design 
Subjects were randomized 1:1 into 2 study groups. This study was conducted in an open manner as 
the number of injections differed between groups. 
Approximately 3.5 ml whole blood sample was taken from all subjects before the first dose and one 
month after the third dose of the DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine or the DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 451 subjects (224 subjects in the Combo group and 227 subjects in the Control group) 
were randomised and completed in the study. Healthy males or females between, and including, 42 
and 69 days of age at the time of the first vaccination, were included in the study. Written informed 
consent was obtained from the parents/ Legally Acceptable Representatives (LARs) of the subjects.  
Evidence of previous or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and Hib vaccination or 
disease led to exclusion of the subject from the study. 
Treatments 
Study vaccine: DTPa-IPV/Hib consisting of two components and combined prior to use (“combo”) 
(1)  the liquid DTPa-IPV component presented in a prefilled syringe; and  
(2)  the lyophilized Hib component which was reconstituted with the liquid DTPa-IPV component. 
Control vaccine: DTPa-IPV/Hib consisting of the same components but given separately (“control”) 
(1)  the liquid DTPa-IPV component presented in a prefilled syringe; and  
(2)  the lyophilized Hib component which was reconstituted with the provided diluent. 
The primary study vaccines were given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. 
Co-administered vaccines: 
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine: Synflorix given at 6 weeks, 3.5 months and 5.5 months of age. 
Infants received IM vaccinations into the right anterolateral thigh.

Rotavirus vaccine: Rotarix. Two doses given two months apart orally. 
Study procedures 
Rotarix was administered at Visit 1 and Visit 3. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity: 
Immunogenicity outcomes are not discussed here as no immunogenicity data were collected for 
Rotarix. 
Safety: 
- 
The safety of Rotarix was assessed in terms of unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs). 
-  All AEs starting within 30 days following administration of each dose of the primary study 
vaccines (DTPa-IPV/Hib or DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines) were recorded onto the Adverse Event 
screen in the subject’s eCRF, irrespective of intensity or whether or not they were considered 
vaccination-related.

- 
The standard time period for collecting and recording SAEs began at the first receipt of study 
vaccine and ended 30 days following administration of the last dose of study vaccine for each 
subject. 
- 
In addition to the above-mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil international 
reporting obligations, SAEs that were related to study participation (e.g. protocol-mandated 
procedures, invasive tests) or were related to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine or any 
fatal SAE was collected and recorded from the time the subject consents to participate in the 
study until she/he was discharged. 
-  A post-study AE/SAE was defined as any event that occurred outside of the AE/SAE reporting 
period. Investigators were not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study 
participants. However, if the investigator learned of any SAE, including a death, at any time 
after a subject had been discharged from the study, and he/she considered the event 
reasonably related to the investigational product, the investigator promptly notified the Study 
Contact for Reporting SAEs. 
Statistical Methods 
Safety

ATP analyses with reasons for exclusion.  
Efficacy results 
One month after the third dose of primary vaccination: 
-  All subjects in both the groups were seroprotected against diphtheria antigen. The anti-
diphtheria GMCs were 8.096 IU/mL in the Combo group and 8.692 IU/mL in the Control group. 
-  All subjects in both the groups were seroprotected against tetanus antigen. The antitetanus 
GMCs were 10.259 IU/mL in the Combo group and 12.421 IU/mL in the Control group. 
-  All subjects in both the groups were seroprotected against poliovirus type 1 and type 2. The 
anti- poliovirus type 1 GMTs were 328.8 ED50 in the Combo group and 372.7 ED 50 in the 
Control group. The anti - poliovirus type 2 GMTs were 340.6 ED50 in the Combo group and 
400.2 ED 50 in the Control group.  
-  All except one subject (99.5 %) in the Combo group and 99% of subjects in the Control group 
were seroprotected against poliovirus type 3 antigen. The anti - poliovirus type 3 GMTs were 
377.7 ED 50 in the Combo group and 465.3 ED50 in the Control group. 
-  All subjects in both groups were seropositive against pertussis PT, FHA and PRN antigens. The 
anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN GMCs were 54.2 EU/mL, 125 EU/mL and 125.8 EU/mL 
respectively in the Combo group and 56 EU/mL, 134.2 EU/mL and 133.4 EU/mL respectively in 
the Control group.  
-  Vaccine response rates to PT antigen were observed in 99.5% of subjects in both the groups. 
Vaccine response rates to FHA antigen were observed in 98.1% of subjects in Combo group

and in 96.7% of subjects in Control group. Vaccine response rates to PRN antigen were 
observed in 100% of subjects in Combo group and 99.5% of subjects in Control group. 
-  All subjects in both the groups were seroprotected against Hib PRP antigen. The anti- PRP 
GMCs were 8.456 μg/ml in the Combo group and 18.700 μg/ml in the Control Group. 
Assessor’s comment 
No immunogenicity data were collected for Rotarix.  
Immunogenicity data of the primary study vaccines (DTPa-IPV/Hib or DTPa-IPV and Hib vaccines) 
show very high seroprotection rates in both Combo and Control group. 
Safety results 
All 224 enrolled subjects in the Combo group and 227 subjects in the Control group received at least 
one dose of their allocated vaccines. 
As Rotarix was administered at Visit 1 (6 weeks) and Visit 3 (3,5 months), the recording of non-serious 
AE within 30 days post-vaccination at Month 2 and Month 4 reflects also the safety profile of Rotarix.  
Summary of safety according to co-administration vaccine regimen 
-  Any solicited symptom/unsolicited AE: During the 4-day post-vaccination follow-up period, any 
solicited symptom and unsolicited AE were reported for 96.9% of subjects in the Combo group 
and Control group. Grade 3 symptoms were more frequently reported in the Combo group 
(26.8%) compared to the Control group (20.7%). 
-  Solicited local symptoms: During the 4-day post-vaccination period, redness was the most 
frequently reported solicited local symptom, reported for 79.0% of subjects in the Combo 
group and 73.6% of subjects in the Control group. Redness was also the most frequently 
reported Grade 3 solicited local symptom, reported for 12.9% of subjects in Combo group and 
11.5% of subjects in the Control group. 
-  Solicited general symptoms: During the 4-day post-vaccination period, irritability was the 
most frequently reported solicited general symptom, reported for 80.8% of subjects in the 
Combo group and 80.2% of subjects in the Control group. Irritability was also the most 
frequently reported Grade 3 solicited general symptom, reported for 6.7% of subjects in the 
Combo group and 4.0% of subjects in the Control group. 
-  Unsolicited AEs: During the 31-day post-vaccination period, at least one unsolicited AE was 
reported for 58% of subjects in the Combo group and 54.2% of subjects in the Control group. 
Nasopharyngitis reported for 37 subjects (16.5%) was the most frequently reported 
unsolicited AE in the Combo group while nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection 
reported for 29 subjects (12.8%) were the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs in the 
Control group. At least one Grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported for four subjects (1.8%) in the 
Combo group and five subjects (2.2%) in the Control group. Urinary tract infection, reported 
for two subjects (0.9%) was the most frequently reported Grade 3 unsolicited AE in the Control 
group. At least one unsolicited AE possibly related to vaccination was reported for 6.7% 
subjects in the Combo group and 3.5% of subjects in the Control group. Diarrhoea and 
injection site mass, reported for four subjects (1.8%) were the most frequently reported 
unsolicited AEs possibly related to vaccination in the Combo group while diarrhoea and

nasopharyngitis, reported for two subjects (0.9%) were the most frequently reported 
unsolicited AEs possibly related to vaccination in the Control group. 
-  SAEs: A total of 57 SAEs were reported in 46 subjects (25 subjects in the Combo group and 21 
subjects in the Control group). Among the SAEs, bronchiolitis, urinary tract infections and 
gastro-enterititis were the most frequently reported SAEs in both the groups. All SAEs led to 
hospitalisation and were resolved by the end of study.  
-  Withdrawals due to AEs/SAEs: None of the subjects were withdrawn due to an AE or SAE, 
during the study period. 
-  No fatal events were reported during the study period. 
-  One case of intussusception was reported. 
Intussusception case 
This female subject was enrolled in the prophylactic open study 114260 (DTPa-IPV-059). On 15 March 
2011 and 16 May 2011, she received the 1st and 2nd dose of 10-valent pneumococcal-protein D 
conjugate vaccine (Synflorix, IM, left thigh) and rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, oral). On 29 March 2011 
and 30 May 2011, she received the 1st and 2nd dose of combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular 
pertussis, inactivated polio, haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Infanrix-IPV/Hib, IM R thigh). On 
19 July 2011, she received a 3rd dose of Synflorix. On 02 August 2011, she received a 3rd dose of 
Infanrix-IPV/Hib.  
On 09 August 2011, 85 days after the 2nd dose of Rotarix, 21 days after the 3rd dose of Synflorix, 
seven days after the 3rd dose of Infanrix-IPV/Hib, this six-month-old subject developed acute 
gastroenteritis and intussusception. The subject was hospitalised. 
The subject was treated with cefpiramide, Medilac-S, sulphamethoxazole, sodium chloride and 
Dextrose + sodium chloride. Intussusception resolved on 11 August 2011. Acute gastroenteritis 
resolved on 25 August 2011.  
The investigator considered that there was no reasonable possibility that the acute gastroenteritis and 
intussusception may have been caused by Rotarix, Synflorix and Infanrix-IPV/Hib. 
Assessor’s comment 
There were no new safety issues for Rotarix based on the results of this study.  
AE related to Rotarix were treated as unsolicited AE as per study protocol. The most common AE 
reported within 30 days of Rotarix administration are diarrhea and irritability (SmPC Rotarix, 
2016). As these AE are also part of the expected safety profile post-DTaP and Hib vaccination 
(SmPC Infanrix-IPV, 2014; SmPC Hiberix, 2016), it is surprising that diarrhea was treated as an 
unsolicited AE and therefore not included as a predefined safety endpoint. The frequency of 
diarrhea observed in this study (0.9 – 1.8%) is at the lower limit of being classified as “common” 
AE (>1% - <10%), which might be attributed to underreporting in case of an unsolicited AE. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
A limitation of the current study is the potential bias due to the open-label design.  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/743127/2016  
Page 9/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Another limitation is the lack of specific endpoints for assessing the clinical aspects of Rotarix. The 
study was also not designed nor powered to detect rare AE. All study subjects (n=451) received  two 
doses of Rotarix. 
The immune responses against rotavirus antigens were not determined, but immune responses to the 
primary study vaccines were acceptable. The safety data did not give rise to new safety concerns.  
Thus, the addition of these results to the already presented clinical data does not impact on the 
benefit/risk balance of Rotarix. No further regulatory action is considered necessary.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
No data on the immunogenicity of Rotarix were provided in this report.  
Study DTPA-IPV (INFANRIXIPV)-059 was not designed to exclude an effect of Rotarix on the 
immunogenicity and safety of the primary study vaccines (containing DTPa-IPV and Hib antigens) in 
health infants. Nevertheless, the provided data do not cause concern regarding safety of Rotarix. 
The Article 46 paediatric submission is considered fulfilled, and no further regulatory action is needed.  
The benefit/risk balance of Rotarix remains positive. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
  Not fulfilled: 
Additional clarifications requested 
Not applicable.

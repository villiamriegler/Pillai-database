Part VI:   Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Epidyolex 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Epidyolex.  The RMP details 
the  important  risks  of  Epidyolex,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more 
information  will  be  obtained  about  Epidyolex’s  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information). 
Epidyolex’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give 
essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals,  patients  and  their  carers  on  how 
Epidyolex should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Epidyolex  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language 
summary, all which are part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current concerns will be included in updates of 
Epidyolex’s RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What it is Used For 
Epidyolex is authorised for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-
Gastaut  syndrome  (LGS)  or  Dravet  syndrome  (DS)  in  conjunction  with  clobazam,  for 
patients 2 years of age and older. 
Epidyolex is authorised for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC) for patients 2 years of age and older.  
It contains Cannabidiol (CBD) as the active substance, and it is given as an oral solution 
(CBD-OS). 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  the  benefits  of  Epidyolex  can  be  found  in 
Epidyolex’s  EPAR,  including  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/epidyolex 
Risks  Associated  with  the  Medicine  and  Activities  to  Minimise  or 
II. 
Further Characterise the Risks 
Important  risks  of  Epidyolex,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about Epidyolex’s risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analysed,  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Epidyolex is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A   List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important  risks  of  Epidyolex  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which  there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Epidyolex.    Potential  risks  are 
concerns  for  which  an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on 
available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further 
evaluation.    Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of 
the medicine).

II.B   Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified Risk 1: Hepatocellular injury 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Clinical trial results have shown that CBD-OS is associated with 
dose-related alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations in a subset 
of patients.  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations have also 
been observed, but to a lesser extent than ALT.   
Risk factors and risk groups 
No severe liver injury has been observed.   
However as elevated ALT and AST can be the first sign of a drug-
induced liver injury (DILI) this would affect how CBD-OS may be 
used in a patient. 
Elevations in liver enzymes called transaminases (such as ALT and 
AST) appear to be more frequent in patients taking higher doses of 
CBD-OS.   
Patients who were also using valproate, a commonly used drug in 
epilepsy, were at an increased risk of developing elevated 
transaminases during treatment. 
Patients with higher levels of ALT at the beginning of treatment 
were at an increased risk developing elevated transaminases. 
The majority of elevations in transaminases occurred within the first 
60 days of commencing CBD-OS.  Some patients had elevations 
after this time and therefore periodic monitoring is recommended.

Important Identified Risk 2: Somnolence and Sedation  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In clinical trials conducted in patients with DS, LGS or TSC, 
somnolence was a common AE, and was consistently more frequent 
in patients treated with CBD-OS compared with placebo.   
Risk factors and risk groups 
Sedation occurred less frequently than somnolence, but is a 
medically similar event.  For both events, some were serious or led 
to discontinuation and also occurred in both the long and short-term 
trials. 
Patients most often first reported somnolence by their second week 
of treatment with CBD-OS.  Sedation was reported at a much lower 
rate than somnolence but again the greatest number of events were 
reported within the first 2 weeks of treatment. 
The incidence of somnolence or sedation is considered to be dose-
related. 
Risk minimisation measures 
The incidence of somnolence or sedation was higher in patients 
taking CLB alongside CBD-OS, compared with those who were not.

Important Identified Risk 3: Lethargy  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In clinical trials conducted in patients with DS, LGS or TSC, 
lethargy was consistently more frequent in patients treated with 
CBD-OS compared with placebo.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Lethargy events were considered dose related.  Some events were 
serious or led to discontinuation and also occurred in both the long 
and short-term trials. 
Most events of lethargy were reported within the first 2 weeks of 
treatment with CBD-OS.  
The incidence of lethargy is considered to be dose-related. 
Risk minimisation measures 
The incidence of lethargy was higher in patients taking CLB 
alongside CBD-OS, compared with those who were not.

Important Identified Risk 4: Pneumonia 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Clinical trial results have shown that more patients receiving CBD-
OS experienced pneumonia-type events compared with those who 
received placebo.  It is noted that these events are common in the 
target patient populations and there was no increase in incidence 
with increasing CBD-OS dose. 
The incidence of pneumonia does not appear to be dose related. 
More patients experienced pneumonia if they were also taking CLB, 
compared to if they were not taking CLB.

Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Clinical trial results have shown that more patients receiving CBD-
OS experienced events of rash compared with those who received 
placebo.  Healthy subjects as well as patients with epilepsy have 
experienced rash events.  These rashes have not been associated 
with serious outcomes. 
However, based on what has been observed, serious rashes may be 
seen in post-marketing. 
The occurrence of all rash events was approximately twice as high 
in epilepsy patients who were also taking CLB along with CBD-OS, 
in the pivotal trials.

Important Potential Risk 1: Suicidality (Class Effect) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Suicidality-related events have been reported more often in people 
with epilepsy, than in the general population. 
Suicidality-related events have also been reported more often in 
people taking any epilepsy medication. 
From the clinical development programme, there is no evidence that 
CBD-OS increases the risk of patients experiencing suicidality-
related events. 
However, taken together, suicidality has been added as an important 
potential risk for CBD-OS in the indications of DS, LGS and TSC. 
Having epilepsy and using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) means that 
the target population already have risk factors for developing 
suicidality-related events. 
From the clinical trials there is no evidence that CBD-OS increases 
the risk of patients experiencing suicidality-related events.

Important Potential Risk 2: Seizure Worsening 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Based on seizure count data in the LGS trials, some patients 
receiving 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS, in the absence of CLB were more 
likely to experience a ≥ 25% increase in primary seizure frequency, 
compared to those receiving placebo.  This was not the case in the 
10mg/kg/day CBD-OS groups. This did not occur in the DS or TSC 
trials. 
Based on AE reporting, there was no difference in the frequency of 
seizure worsening type events between patients receiving CBD-OS 
and placebo.  
Seizure worsening can occur when patients do not respond to an 
AED, particularly in severe, difficult-to-treat epilepsies such as DS, 
LGS, or TSC. It is also possible that an AED may worsen certain 
seizure types.  
Taken together, seizure worsening has been considered as an 
important potential risk. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Important Potential Risk 2: Seizure Worsening 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
In the LGS trials, in the absence of CLB, patients taking 20 
mg/kg/day CBD-OS were more likely to experience seizure 
worsening (≥ 25% increase from the number of seizures experienced 
prior to starting CBD-OS) than those taking placebo. In such 
patients taking concomitant CLB, the opposite trend was seen.  
Seizure worsening ≥ 25% was not seen in patients on 10mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS as compared to placebo. 
Patients with a greater number of seizures prior to starting CBD-OS 
tended to be more likely to experience a ≥ 25% increase in the 
number of seizures on treatment with CBD-OS and may be at 
greater risk. 
Patients with DS and TSC appear to have less risk as in the DS and 
TSC trials, the frequency of patients with ≥ 25% seizure increases 
was no greater with CBD-OS treatment groups, compared with 
placebo.

Important Potential Risk 3: Aggression 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Clinical trial results have shown that more patients receiving CBD-
OS experienced aggression compared with those who received 
placebo.  Most events of aggression were mild or moderate in 
intensity.  There have been isolated individual reports of aggression 
which suggest that aggression-type events could potentially result in 
important outcomes.  There is already a risk of patients with 
epilepsy such as DS, LGS and  TSC to have behaviour problems 
such as aggression.  For these reasons, aggression is an important 
potential risk. 
No clear risk factors or risk groups for aggression have been 
identified.  Aggression is a comorbidity in the target population. 
Although not data-driven, a history of aggression and/or behavior 
problems would likely confer an increased risk of aggression on 
CBD-OS.

Important Potential Risk 4: Euphoria 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Clinical trials in DS, LGS and TSC patients suggest that the 
presence of euphoria-related events with CBD-OS was minimal.   
 More patients receiving CBD-OS compared with those who 
received placebo experienced euphoric mood during a Phase 1 study 
in recreational polydrug users.  All events were reported as mild in 
intensity and none were serious AEs. However, in this study CBD-
OS was not “liked” by the users of CBD-OS as much as other drugs 
with known abuse potential. 
No clear risk factors or risk groups have been identified in the target 
patient population. It is possible that the euphoria events seen in a 
study in polydrug abusers were only seen due to the nature of these 
patients.

Important Potential Risk 5: Impact on cognitive development 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In the clinical trials, the available data makes the assessment of a 
possible decrease in cognitive function impossible.  Some adverse 
event reports have been received that may potentially indicate a 
change in some aspects of cognitive function, although patients with 
DS, LGS or TSC often have impaired cognitive function.  It should 
also be noted that CBD-OS is an anti-epileptic drug, and reduction 
of seizure may help improve cognitive function. 
However, taken together, a possible decrease in cognitive function 
has been added as an important potential risk for CBD-OS 
No clear risk factors or risk groups for a negative impact on 
cognitive development have been identified. 
Patients with a higher numbers of seizures and those experiencing 
somnolence and/or sedation may be at a higher risk.

Important Potential Risk 6: Urinary retention 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Clinical trial results have shown that more patients receiving CBD-
OS experienced urinary retention compared with those who received 
placebo.   
Adverse events are likely linked to the complex medical history and 
physical characteristics of the population in which CBD is being 
administered, although it is noted that the occurrence of urinary 
symptoms occurred predominantly in CBD-OS patients 
administering 20mg/kg/day in the DS and LGS pivotal trials.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
HIV infection remains a major public health concern in EU/EEA (European Union/European Economic 
Area) countries, characterised by a significant number of new infections. In contrast, the overall 
number of AIDS cases has continued to decline in correlation with the use of effective antiretroviral 
treatment, although in some eastern EU countries, the number of AIDS cases continues to rise. In 
2012, 29 306 diagnosed cases of HIV infection were reported in 29 EU/EEA countries, a rate of 5.7 per 
100 000 population. This number is likely to be an underestimation due to the delay in reporting HIV 
diagnoses in a number of countries. The highest proportion was reported among MSM (men who have 
sex with men) (40%); heterosexual contact accounted for 34% (including 12% in cases from countries 
with generalised HIV epidemics); and injecting drug use for 6%. The overall rate ranged from 6 cases 
per 100 000 population in 2008 to 5.7 per 100 000 in 2012. When adjusted for reporting delay, the 
rate was 6.2 cases per 100 000 in 2012, indicating a relatively stable rate over the period. 
The most significant advance in the medical management of HIV-1 infection has been the treatment of 
patients with antiviral drugs, which can suppress HIV-1 replication to undetectable levels. The 
discovery of HIV-1 as the causative agent of AIDS together with an ever increasing understanding of 
the virus replication cycle have been instrumental in this effort by providing researchers with the 
knowledge and tools required to prosecute drug discovery efforts focused on targeted inhibition with 
specific pharmacological agents. 
Since the first HIV-1 specific antiviral drugs were given as monotherapy in the early 1990s, the 
standard of HIV-1 care evolved to include the administration of a cocktail or combination of 
antiretroviral agents. The advent of combination therapy, also known as highly active antiretroviral 
therapy or HAART, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and 
mortality associated with HIV-1 infection and AIDS. 
Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses viral replication and reduces the plasma 
HIV-1 viral load to below the limits of detection of the most sensitive clinical assays (0,50 RNA copies/ 
mL) resulting in a significant reconstitution of the immune system as measured by an increase in 
circulating CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Importantly, combination therapy using three antiretroviral agents 
directed against at least two distinct molecular targets is the underlying basis for forestalling the 
evolution drug resistance. 
With proper adherence, HAART can suppress viral replication for decades, dramatically increasing the 
life expectancy of the HIV-infected individual. However, HAART alone cannot eliminate HIV-1 infection. 
HIV-1 is a chronic infection for which there is currently no cure—the prospect of maintaining therapy 
for the lifetime of a patient presents major challenges. The potential for persistent viral replication in 
compartments and reservoirs may continue to drive pathogenic disease processes. The effect of 
therapy can be impaired by nonadherence, poor drug tolerability, and drug interactions among 
antiretroviral agents and other medications that decrease optimal drug levels. Each of these can lead 
to virologic failure and the evolution of drug resistance.

Combination of three antiretrovirals, typically two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
(NsRTI/NtRTI or NRTI) plus either a (boosted) HIV-protease inhibitor (PI), a nonnucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or an integrase inhibitor (INI), referred to as highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART), is also recommended by international guidelines. 
Physicians experienced in the management of HIV infection commonly refer to the two-drug NRTI 
combination as the “backbone” and the third agent as the “base” of the regimen. Co-formulation of 
tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine provides the nucleotide backbone for once-daily dosing, as a 
component of HAART, and improve patient adherence, thereby decreasing the risk of acquired drug 
resistance. Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil have been investigated in numerous placebo 
controlled and comparative clinical studies and have been proven effective and safe drugs for the 
treatment of patients with the proposed indication in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is presented as film coated tablets containing a fixed-dose 
combination of 200 mg of emtricitabine and 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil (equivalent to 300.7 mg of 
tenofovir disoproxil succinate or 136 mg of tenofovir) as the active substances. 
Other ingredients of the tablet core are pregelatinised starch, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose 
sodium, lactose monohydrate, sodium stearyl fumarate and stearic acid. The film coating is composed 
of Hypromellose 5 cP, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol and indigo carmine aluminum lake (E132). 
The product is available in OPA/Alu/PE+DES/Alu blisters or in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles 
with polypropylene closure with integrated a silica gel desiccant, as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Emtricitabine 
General information 
The chemical name of emtricitabine is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan- 
-5-yl]-2(1H)- pyrimidinone corresponding to the molecular formula C8H10FN3O3S. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 247.3 g/mol and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236203/2017  
Page 8/31 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Structure of emtricitabine 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis (C,H, N & 
S), mass spectrometry, 1H- & 13C-NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, HPLC, and x-
ray powder diffraction. 
The active substance appears as a white to almost white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely 
soluble in methanol and water. The solubility in aqueous solution is pH dependent being more soluble 
at acidic pH. Its pKa was found to be 2.27. 
Emtricitabine has two chiral centres. The cis enantiomer having the 2R, 5S absolute configuration is 
produced. Enantiomeric purity and emtricitabine diastereomers content is controlled routinely by chiral 
HPLC.  
Emtricitabine exhibits polymorphism with a number of different forms and an amorphous form known. 
The polymorphic form manufactured by the proposed manufacturer has been confirmed by XRD on 
three batches of emtricitabine. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance (AS) has been provided in 
the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Emtricitabine is synthesized in five main chemical steps. The starting materials are well-defined with 
acceptable specifications. The first two steps of the synthesis, leading to the intermediate, are 
performed by one manufacturer and the last three steps by a different manufacturer.  
The critical steps and process parameters have been adequately described and their control is 
acceptable. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The batch size range has 
been defined. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the 
EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities including genotoxic 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. The absence of genotoxic 
impurities has been demonstrated through carryover studies and where needed, by batch data. 
Emtricitabine is packed in transparent low density polyethylene bag (LDPE) with tag seal, followed by a 
secondary transparent LDPE bag with heat seal all inside an HDPE container. The polythene bags used 
as primary packaging material are food grade and comply with the requirements of Ph. Eur. and 
European Directive 10/2011 as amended. Specification, test procedures, and a certificate of analysis 
for the LDPE containers have been provided. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), 
solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, specific optical rotation), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash 
(Ph. Eur.), enantiomer and emtricitabine diastereomers content (chiral HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (laser 
diffraction).  
The potential impurities and possible genotoxic impurities are controlled in the AS by validated test 
methods. Based on batch results which showed that impurities were either below detection limit or not 
detected, it has been demonstrated that the impurities are generally adequately controlled during 
manufacturing of the active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236203/2017  
Page 9/31 
 
 
 
 
The specification does not include a test for heavy metals and this has been justified in line with ICH 
Q3D Guideline, on the basis of batch analysis from commercial scale batches. Polymorphism is 
controlled by the ASMF holder and re-testing by the finished product manufacturer in not considered 
necessary.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from multiple production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on multiple batches, most of them manufactured at commercial scale, from the proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial packaging under long term conditions 
(25 °C ± 2 °C/ 60%RH ± 5% RH) and under accelerated conditions (40 °C ± 2 °C/ 75%RH ± 5% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Samples were tested for description, identification, loss 
on drying, related substances and assay. The analytical methods used were the same as for release 
and are stability indicating. No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed 
under either storage condition and all results remained within specification. 
Photostability testing following ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one commercial scale batch. No 
significant change was observed in assay, related substances, enantiomer or diastereomers content. 
The results showed that the AS is not sensitive to light. 
Forced degradation studies have been performed with the aim of showing that the HPLC method for 
assay and related substances is stability indicating by studying samples exposed to base, acid, 
oxidation and high temperature conditions.  
The stability results justify the proposed retest period and specific storage conditions, stored in the 
proposed packaging is acceptable. 
Tenofovir disoproxil 
General information 
The chemical name of tenofovir disoproxil succinate is 9-[(R)-2- 
[[bis(isopropoxycarbonyl)oxy]methoxy] phosphinyl] methoxy]propyl]adenine succinate corresponding 
to the molecular formula C23H36N5O14P. It has a relative molecular mass of 637.5 g/mol and the 
structure shown in figure 2: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236203/2017  
Page 10/31 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Structure of tenofovir disoproxil succinate 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis (C,H, 
N & S), mass spectrometry, 1H- and  13C-NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, UV Spectroscopy, 
HPLC, and X-ray powder diffraction. 
The active substance is a white to off-white, not hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in 
water and sparingly soluble to soluble in aqueous media across the physiological pH range. Its pKa has 
been found to be 4.87 and its partition coefficient was found to be 0.94. 
Tenofovir disoproxil succinate is known to exhibit polymorphism. Batch data from three validation 
batches have been presented with X-ray diffractogrammes and theta values confirm consistent 
manufacture of the desired polymorphic form.  
There is one chiral centre at C-2 position of the propyl side-chain which has been sufficiently discussed 
with regard to its origin and control. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Tenofovir disoproxil succinate is synthesized in three main steps using well-defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications. The single chiral centre is controlled in (R)-propylene carbonate and 
carries through unaltered to the active substance.  
The critical steps and parameters have been adequately described and their control is acceptable. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The batch size has been defined.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. A 
thorough assessment of potential genotoxic impurities (GTI) was carried out. The absence of 
carry-over of the potential GTI compounds or their control below TTC limits has been demonstrated in 
commercial scale batches of the AS and the controls put in place are considered adequate. 
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with 
the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. 
The active substance is packaged in double transparent low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags each on 
tied with nylon strip seal. The double LDPE bag is kept in heat sealed Triple Laminated Sunlight Barrier 
(TLSB) bag inside a high density polyethylene (HDPE) drum. The materials comply with the EC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236203/2017

directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. Specification, test procedures, and a certificate of 
analysis for the LDPE containers have been provided as well. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, 
HPLC), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.),  S-isomer content (chiral HPLC), related substances 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (laser 
diffraction). All unknown and specified related substances are limited according to the ICH Q3A 
guideline with the exception of the mono ester impurity, the isopropyl impurity and a potential 
genotoxic impurity. The proposed limit for the potentially genotoxic impurity has been sufficiently 
justified on the basis of bacterial reverse mutation (AMES) test and batch analysis of the reference 
product. For the limit of the isopropyl impurity and the mono ester impurity, reference is made to the 
WHO International Pharmacopoeia monograph in which they are listed which can be considered as 
valid and can be used for qualification purposes. The residual solvents limits are based on ICH Q3C. 
The consistency of the crystalline form has been established and batch data from commercial batches 
of tenofovir disoproxil succinate have been presented. In addition, this crystalline form has been shown 
to be stable under long term storage conditions and the existing identification test by IR is specific for 
the correct polymorphic form. 
As tenofovir disoproxil succinate is a non-sterile active substance intended for oral administration, 
based on the ICH Q6A, Decision tree#6, inclusion of microbial limit test in the AS specification is not 
considered necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from multiple production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from multiple production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package under long-term conditions (5 ± 3 °C) and 
under accelerated conditions (25 ± 2 °C/60 ± 5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Samples were tested for appearance, identification, water content, related substances and assay. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. No significant 
changes to any of the measured parameters were observed under either storage condition and all 
remained within specification. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one commercial scale batch. 
No significant change was observed in assay, related substances. The results showed that the AS is not 
sensitive to light. 
Stress testing (high temperature, acidic, basic and oxidising aqueous media) was performed on one 
batch. No significant change in assay, related substances was observed at high temperature.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance is stable during the studied period at 5±3 °C in 
the proposed container and in line with extrapolation applied in accordance to CPMP/QWP/122/02, rev 
1 corr., and the commitment to continue the stability studies for the revalidation batches, a retest

period of 30 months with the proposed storage conditions “Store at 2-8 °C”, when stored in the 
proposed packaging materials, is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a fixed dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil succinate, 
presented as blue, oval biconvex film coated immediate release tablets, intended for oral 
administration. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a generic product equivalent to the 
reference product Truvada which is an immediate release tablet for oral administration. 
Emtricitabine, according to BCS, is a class I substance (highly soluble and highly permeable).  It is 
optically active and corresponds to the cis enantiomer with 2R, 5S absolute configuration. Tenofovir 
disoproxil succinate is a BCS class III (highly soluble, low permeability) substance. Tenofovir disoproxil 
succinate is optically active and corresponds to R-isomer.  It has been demonstrated for both active 
substances that the other stereoisomers do not form during the tablet manufacturing process or on 
exposure to stressed conditions, and thus there is no need to control them in the finished product.  
A different salt of tenofovir disoproxil is used compared to the reference product (succinate rather than 
fumarate). The potential impact of this difference on pharmaceutical aspects (e.g. stability and 
compatibility with excipients) and clinical performance (e.g. in vivo PK) has been discussed in detail. 
The choice of the succinate salt is considered justified. 
With regard to the polymorphism of the ASs, it has been shown that both the selected polymorphic 
forms exhibit adequate chemical and physical stability as confirmed during the pharmaceutical 
development by results of batches of tablets after storage. 
The excipients used in the formulation are well known in the manufacture of solid dosage forms and 
are very similar to those used in the reference product. With the exception of indigo carmine 
aluminium lake, they are all described in the Ph. Eur. The results of compatibility studies of each AS 
with the excipients in binary mixtures have been provided. No incompatibilities were identified and the 
two tenofovir disoproxil salts gave similar results.  
Film-coating was chosen to protect the tablet core containing the active ingredients against the 
influence from environment and to achieve better compliance for patients. 
Two different manufacturing processes were investigated and the effect of excipients in the stability of 
the product was studied. The manufacturing process and film coating were chosen taking into account 
the physocochemical proerties of the active substances and excipients and suitable IPCs are put in 
place. 
The dissolution profile of the most promising trial formulation was compared with that of Truvada film-
coated tablets. The release rate of both active ingredients was comparable with the reference product. 
A number of trials were carried out to improve the ease of processing of the product and the best 
prototype formulation was chosen. 
Additional experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of film coating on final product 
stability. Based on these studies a suitable film coating was selected. The effect of lubricant was 
studied and the quantity was optimised. The effect of particle size of both ASs on dissolution was also

investigated during the development of the product and suitable specifications have been set for each 
AS. 
The impact of the tenofovir disoproxil salt on the formulation properties was also evaluated. The 
dissolution profiles of pilot scale batches with qualitatively and quantitatively similar composition but 
with different tenofovir disoproxil salt (fumarate vs succinate) were compared and found to be similar. 
The tablets were also compared in a pilot bioequivalence study (15-455) and found to afford similar 
exposures. Finally the bioequivalence of the proposed formulation against the reference product was 
demonstrated in study 15-465. The comparability of dissolution profiles of the test and reference 
batches used in this study was shown in three different pH media. The dissolution of emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil is rapid in 0.1M hydrochloric acid, acetate buffer solution pH 4.5 and phosphate 
buffer solution pH 6.8. The dissolution profiles of the test product can be considered similar in the 
stated media. The dissolution method for QC has been shown to be discriminatory. 
The process parameters of roller compaction could potentially affect the drug release rates and 
therefore suitable limits were set to ensure consistent final product performance. The proposed holding 
times are supported by data. 
The primary packaging of Emtricitabine/ tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. 200/245 mg film coated tablets 
is OPA/Alu/PE+DES/Alu blisters with integrated desiccant, or in high density polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottles with polypropylene closure with an integrated silica gel desiccant. The proposed packaging 
materials are used extensively in the pharmaceutical industry for solid oral dosage forms and provide 
good protection from moisture and light. A container closure system with a desiccant was selected in 
order to reduce exposure of active ingredients to moisture and improve chemical stability of the 
formulation. The suitability of the desiccant was evaluated during development and the most 
advantageous quantity and type for each container configuration was chosen. The provided stability 
results indicate that the proposed packaging materials are suitable for the storage of the finished 
product. The primary packaging material complies with relevant EU regulations. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is considered to be a standard process which comprises the following main 
steps: a) preparation of blend for roller compaction, b) roller compaction, c) preparation of 
compression mixture, d) tabletting, e) coating of tablets and f) packaging.  The process critical steps 
have been identified. Critical process parameters have been identified for those manufacturing steps 
and adequate IPCs are in place. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a 
number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing 
the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The manufacturing process will be 
validated on three production batches prior to commercialisation which is acceptable since the process 
is a standard one. An acceptable validation protocol has been presented. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including appearance, uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), content uniformity for emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.),  identification (emtricitabine & tenofovir: HPLC 
and TLC), related substances (emtricitabine & tenofovir: HPLC), assay (emtricitabine & tenofovir: 
HPLC), ethanol (GC), dissolution (emtricitabine & tenofovir: Ph. Eur.) and microbiological quality (Ph. 
Eur.).

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used in the routine analysis of finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data three pilot scale batches were presented. All batches are representative of the 
commercial formula and process. All batches meet the commercial specification limits. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot and one smaller scale batch of finished product stored for up to 12 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, average tablet weight, water content, dissolution, assay, related 
substances and microbial purity. The methods used were the same as for release testing and are 
stability indicating. There is no significant change in any of characteristic of Emtricitabine/ tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka d.d. 200/245 mg film coated tablets as tested at any time point. No trends were 
observed. 
Photo-stability testing according to ICH Q 1B (Option 2) was performed on one pilot batch. All tested 
parameters remained unchanged apart from the blue colour of tablets exposed directly to light which 
became a bit lighter as compared with tablets outside the immediate packaging and protected from 
light. 
In-use stability testing (after the first opening of the container) of final product packed in multidose 
(HDPE) containers with desiccant was performed in accordance with the Note for Guidance on In-Use 
Stability Testing of Human Medicinal Products (CPMP/QWP/2934/99). Testing was performed on a pilot 
batch at 25±2 °C/60±5% RH, simulating the intended use of the product. The presented in-use 
stability data supports the proposed 1 month in-use shelf-life (SmPC section 6.3). Further data to 
support the 1 month in-use shelf life will be generated using a second pilot scale batch towards the end 
of its proposed shelf life as per the stability commitment provided. 
Based on the overall data presented support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as 
mentioned below and in the SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4 is acceptable.  
Blister: 2 years, “Do not store above 30°C” and “Store in the original blister in order to protect from 
moisture and light”,  
HDPE bottle: 1 year, “Do not store above 30°C” and “Keep the bottle tightly closed in order to protect 
from moisture and light”.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  Bioequivalence  with  the  reference  product  has  been 
demonstrated. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  Data  has  been 
presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP considered that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
Pharmacology  
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of cytidine. Tenofovir disoproxil is converted in vivo to tenofovir, 
a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate. Both emtricitabine 
and tenofovir have activity that is specific to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and 
hepatitis B virus. 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate 
and tenofovir diphosphate, respectively. In vitro studies have shown that both emtricitabine and 
tenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells. Emtricitabine triphosphate and 
tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain 
termination. 
Both emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA 
polymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. 
Antiviral activity in vitro: Synergistic antiviral activity was observed with the combination of 
emtricitabine and tenofovir in vitro. Additive to synergistic effects were observed in combination

studies with protease inhibitors, and with nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors of HIV 
reverse transcriptase. 
Resistance: Resistance has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due to the 
development of the M184V/I mutation with emtricitabine or the K65R mutation with tenofovir. 
Emtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but 
retained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The K65R mutation can also be 
selected by abacavir or didanosine and results in reduced susceptibility to these agents plus 
lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir. Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in patients with HIV- 1 
harbouring the K65R mutation. In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has 
been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, 
lamivudine and tenofovir. 
Patients with HIV-1 expressing three or more thymidine analogue associated mutations (TAMs) that 
included either the M41L or L210W reverse transcriptase mutation showed reduced susceptibility to 
tenofovir disoproxil. 
In vivo resistance (antiretroviral-naïve patients): In an open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01- 
934) in antiretroviral-naïve patients, genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from all 
patients with confirmed HIV RNA > 400 copies/ml at weeks 48, 96 or 144 or at the time of early study 
drug discontinuation. As of week 144: 
- The M184V/I mutation developed in 2/19 (10.5%) isolates analysed from patients in the 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d./efavirenz group and in 10/29 (34.5%) isolates analysed 
from the lamivudine/zidovudine/efavirenz group (p-value < 0.05, Fisher’s Exact test comparing the 
emtricitabine+tenofovir disoproxil group to the lamivudine/zidovudine group among all subjects). 
- No virus analysed contained the K65R or K70E mutation. 
- Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N mutation, developed in virus from 13/19 
(68%) patients in the Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d./efavirenz group and in virus from 
21/29 (72%) patients in the comparative group. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Reference is made to the SmPC of the Reference product. 
Absorption 
The bioequivalence of one Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. film-coated tablet with one 
emtricitabine 200 mg hard capsule and one tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablet was 
established following single dose administration to fasting healthy subjects. Following oral 
administration of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. to healthy subjects, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil are rapidly absorbed and tenofovir disoproxil is converted to tenofovir. Maximum 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil concentrations are observed in serum within 0.5 to 3.0 h of 
dosing in the fasted state. Administration of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. with food 
resulted in a delay of approximately three quarters of an hour in reaching maximum tenofovir 
concentrations and increases in tenofovir AUC and Cmax of approximately 35% and 15%, respectively, 
when administered with a high fat or light meal, compared to administration in the fasted state. In 
order to optimise the absorption of tenofovir, it is recommended that Emtricitabine/tenofovir Krka 
should be taken with food.

Distribution 
Following intravenous administration the volume of distribution of emtricitabine and tenofovir was 
approximately 1.4 l/kg and 800 ml/kg, respectively. After oral administration of emtricitabine or 
tenofovir disoproxil, emtricitabine and tenofovir are widely distributed throughout the body. In vitro 
binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of concentration over 
the range of 0.02 to 200 μg/ml. In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was 
less than 0.7 and 7.2%, respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 μg/ml. 
Biotransformation 
There is limited metabolism of emtricitabine. The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation 
of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and 
conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). In vitro studies 
have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the CYP450 enzymes. 
Neither emtricitabine nor tenofovir inhibited in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major 
human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug biotransformation. Also, emtricitabine did not inhibit uridine-
5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation. 
Elimination 
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in urine 
(approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%). Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine dose was 
recovered in urine as three metabolites. The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged 307 ml/min. 
Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours. 
Tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system 
with approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous 
administration. The apparent clearance of tenofovir averaged approximately 307 ml/min. Renal 
clearance has been estimated to be approximately 210 ml/min, which is in excess of the glomerular 
filtration rate. This indicates that active tubular secretion is an important part of the elimination of 
tenofovir. Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 
hours. 
Toxicology 
The Applicant’s product is a generic of branded product Truvada.  Reference is therefore made to the 
SmPC of the Reference product. 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate reveal no special hazard for humans. Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and 
monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical exposure levels and with possible 
relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a decrease in serum phosphate 
concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced bone mineral 
density (BMD) (rats and dogs). The bone toxicity in young adult rats and dogs occurred at exposures ≥ 
5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred in juvenile infected monkeys 
at very high exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the exposure in patients). Findings in 
the rat and monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-related decrease in intestinal 
absorption of phosphate with potential secondary reduction in BMD.

Genotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results 
in one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat 
hepatocytes. However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. 
Oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an 
extremely high dose in mice. These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. 
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or 
foetal parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate reduced the viability index and weight of 
pups in peri-postnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. 
Combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: Genotoxicity and repeated dose 
toxicity studies of one month or less with the combination of these two components found no 
exacerbation of toxicological effects compared to studies with the separate components. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of  Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. manufactured by KRKA, d.d., Novo mesto  
is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
emtricitabine and tenofovir containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active 
substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided. The 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data as well known for tenofovir disoproxil and thus 
new non-clinical data are not required.  The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC 
of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided. The 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data as well known for tenofovir disoproxil and thus 
new non-clinical data are not required.  The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC 
of the reference product.

Sciences Intl. Ltd. Ireland) in 28 healthy, adult male human subjects under fed conditions. The 
objective of the study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of both products and to 
monitor the adverse events to ensure the safety of the subjects. 
The study centre was outside EU. 
The study was conducted between 28 August 2015 and 22 September 2015 and bioanalysis was 
performed between 18 September 2015 and 08 October 2015. 
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours subjects 
received a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast 30 minutes prior to drug administration.  
The meal was comprised of approximately 240 mL of whole milk, 2 large eggs, 4 ounces of hash brown 
potatoes (2 potato patties), 1 English muffin with approximately 4.5 g of butter and 2 strips of bacon. 
This meal was composed of 14.5% of protein (136 calories), 30.3% of carbohydrate (284 calories) and 
55.2% of fat (518 calories) for a total of 938 calories.  
Thirty minutes after the start of the breakfast, a single dose of the assigned formulation was 
administered with approximately 240 ml of water at ambient temperature, starting at 08:30, to one 
subject per minute. Water was allowed ad libitum until 1 hour pre-dose and beginning 1 hour after 
drug administration. 
Subjects fasted for at least 5 hours following drug administration, after which a standardized lunch was 
served. A supper and a light snack were also served at appropriate times thereafter, but not before 10 
hours after dosing. 
Subjects were confined to the clinical facility from at least 10 hours prior to dosing of the 
investigational product until after the 24-hour blood sample collection in each study period. The two 
periods were separated by a wash-out phase of at least 14 days.  
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 
1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00,  10.00, 12.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00 and 72.00 
hours after dosing. Blood sampling time adjustments are presented in the dossier.

Population studied 
28 healthy adult male human subjects were enrolled as per the protocol whilst 26 subjects completed 
both study periods.  
Main inclusion criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Subjects were male, age ≥18 and ≤ 55 
non- or ex-smokers 
body mass index (BMI) ≥18.50 kg/m2 and <30.00 kg/m2 
no clinically significant abnormality found in the 12-lead ECG performed at study entry 
healthy according to medical history, complete physical examination (including vital signs) and 
laboratory tests (general biochemistry, haematology and urinalysis) 
Time deviations that were equal to or greater than 2 minutes were adjusted in the pharmacokinetic 
analysis to reflect actual sampling times. The other time deviations were considered to have a 
negligible impact on the assessment of bioequivalence and were not accounted for in the calculation of 
the pharmacokinetic parameters. 
For the sample for which the exact collection time was not known or inconclusive, the scheduled time 
was used in the statistical analysis without any adjustment. 
The protocol deviations reported for the subjects included in the analysis were judged to have no 
significant impact on the bioequivalence assessment or subject’s safety. 
Analytical methods 
Analysis of emtricitabine and tenofovir was performed using test method KRS-P5-566. 
This HPLC/MS/MS method involved the extraction of emtricitabine, tenofovir and the respective 
internal standards.  
Storage period of study samples  
Blood samples were collected in K2 EDTA Vacutainers. As soon as possible following blood collection, 
samples were centrifuged at a temperature of 4°C nominal and at approximately 1500g for 10 
minutes. The plasma obtained was separated into duplicate polypropylene culture tubes, when 
feasible. The tubes were labelled with a code number that did not reveal formulation identity. The 
samples were frozen in an upright position and retained in the clinic's freezers at a temperature of -
20°C nominal until sent on dry ice to the bioanalytical facility for assay. The time from blood sample 
collection to plasma aliquot storage should have been within 90 minutes. 
Dosing started on the 29 August 2015 and the bioanalysis was performed between 21 September to 6 
October 2015 (38 days of storage). 
The long-term stability of Emtricitabine and was adequately covered.1204 samples were expected 
according to the protocol however 1163 blood samples were received (41 missing samples). The

missing samples are accounted for in the dossier.  
Bioanalytical report 
The bioanalytical report was submitted KRS-P5-566 (dated 29 October 2015) with 20% of the subject 
chromatograms presented as well as the method SOPs.  
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Primary parameters:  Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-T, AUC0-∞, residual area, λZ and T1/2. 
Bioequivalence criteria: The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean AUC 0-t and Cmax of the test 
and reference product should be at least 80.00% and not more than 125.00% for log-transformed 
data. 
Statistical methods 
The main absorption and disposition parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental approach 
with a log-linear terminal phase assumption. The trapezoidal rule was used to estimate area under the 
curve. The terminal phase estimation was based on maximizing the coefficient of determination. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters of this trial were Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-T, AUC0-∞, Residual Area, λZ and Thalf. 
The statistical analysis was based on a parametric ANOVA model of the pharmacokinetic parameters; 
the two-sided 90% confidence interval of the ratio of geometric means for the Cmax and AUC0-T was 
based on ln-transformed data; Tmax was based on a non-parametric approach. 
ANOVA model: 
Fixed factors: sequence, period, treatment, subject (nested within sequence)  
Criteria for Bioequivalence: 
Statistical inference of emtricitabine and tenofovir was based on a bioequivalence approach using the 
following standards: 
- The ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence interval calculated from the 
exponential of the difference between the Test and Reference product for the ln-transformed 
parameters Cmax and AUC0-T were all to be within the 80.00 to 125.00% bioequivalence range. 
Safety: Descriptive statistics was applied.

Safety data 
A total of 28 subjects were included in this study and, after randomization, 27 subjects (96%) received 
the Test (Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil) and 27 subjects (96%) received the Reference (Truvada). 
No deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in the study. Also, no subject was withdrawn for 
safety reasons. 
A total of 20 adverse events were reported by 10 (36%) of the 28 subjects who participated in this 
study. Of these events, 10 occurred after administration of each the Test and the Reference. 
The AE reported with the highest incidence was headache, experienced by 2 subjects (7%) dosed with 
the Test and 4 subjects (15%) dosed with the Reference. Nausea was experienced by 2 subjects (7%) 
dosed with the Test and 1 subject (4%) dosed with the Reference. Dizziness was experienced by 1 
subject (4%) per group. Upper abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and vomiting were each 
experienced by 1 subject (4%) dosed with only the Test; while somnolence, fatigue, and procedural 
dizziness were experienced each by 1 subject (4%) dosed only with the Reference. 
The incidence of AEs was similar for subjects administered the Test (19%) and the Reference (22%). 
Drug-related AEs were reported by 5 subjects (19%) administered the Test and 6 subjects (22%) 
administered the Reference. 
All of the AEs were considered mild (16/20; 80%) or moderate (4/20; 20%) in this study. No severe 
AEs were reported in this study. 
Generally, the subjects showed laboratory values within normal range in all treatment groups and all 
physical examination (including vital signs) were judged normal or not clinically significant.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC consider that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.6.  PSUR submission 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
In line with the reference product, the SmPCs/PLs state that as method of administration the tablets 
may be disintegrated and mixed with water or food prior to administration in patients with difficulties 
swallowing tablets whole. The applicant has provided data in support of the alternative method of 
administration. The data show that the disintegration time between test and reference product are 
comparable. Although the BE was demonstrated with tablets taken whole, the data support the 
applicability of specific administration recommendation in originator SmPC to the generic 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d.. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of generic version of emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil 
film-coated tablets. The reference product Truvada is indicated for treatment and prevention of HIV 
infection. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of 
the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236203/2017  
Page 29/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a two-way, two- period, two-sequence cross-
over design under fed conditions. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the 
bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. The 
analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (succinate) met the protocol-defined criteria 
for bioequivalence when compared with Truvada. The point estimates and their 90% confidence 
intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined 
acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was 
demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is favourable in the following 
indication: 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Krka d.d. is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infected adults (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

•  HIV renal educational brochure 
The HIV renal educational brochure should contain the following key messages: 
• 
That there is an increased risk of renal disease in HIV infected patients associated with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing products such as Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka 
• 
That Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir disoproxil Krka should only be used in patients with impaired 
renal function if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks  
• 
That use of Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir disoproxil Krka should be avoided with concomitant or 
recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products. If Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir disoproxil Krka is 
used with nephrotoxic medicinal products, renal function should be closely monitored 
according to the recommended schedule 
• 
That patients should have their baseline renal function assessed prior to initiating 
Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir disoproxil Krka therapy 
• 
The importance of regular monitoring of renal function during Emtricitabine/ Tenofovir 
disoproxil Krka therapy 
•  Recommended schedule for monitoring renal function considering the presence or absence 
of additional risk factors for renal impairment

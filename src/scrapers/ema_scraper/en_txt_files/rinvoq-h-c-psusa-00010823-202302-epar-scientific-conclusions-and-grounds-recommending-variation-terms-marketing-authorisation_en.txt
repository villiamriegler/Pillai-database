Scientific conclusions
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for upadacitinib, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows: 
In view of available data on hypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes from finding in the literature, 
spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, positive de-challenge and 
cases where anti-diabetic therapy was discontinued or dose reduced, in view of a plausible mechanism of 
action and potential class effect the PRAC considers a causal relationship between upadacitinib and 
hypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded 
that the product information of products containing upadacitinib should be amended accordingly.
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation.
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for upadacitinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing upadacitinib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information.
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

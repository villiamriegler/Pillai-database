1.  Introduction 
On 06 March 2019, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study, Study VX16-661-113 for 
Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) 100 mg/150 mg film coated tablets in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor 150 mg tablets, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Study VX16-661-113 involved the use of two authorised medicinal products held by Vertex 
Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Limited:  
- Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor) 100 mg/150 mg film coated tablets.  
- Kalydeco (ivacaftor) 150 mg film-coated tablets  
The same Article 46 submission has therefore been submitted in parallel for Kalydeco 
(EMEA/H/C/002494).  
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s).  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Study VX16-661-113 is a Phase 3, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and 
Tolerability of VX-661 in Combination with Ivacaftor in Subjects 6 Through 11 Years of Age With Cystic 
Fibrosis, Homozygous or Heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR Mutation. 
In the EU, TEZ/IVA is approved as a combination regimen of Symkevi® with IVA 150-mg tablets 
(Kalydeco®) for the treatment of patients with CF 12 years of age and older who are homozygous for 
the F508del-CFTR mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and have 1 of the 
following mutations in the CFTR gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, 
S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
In 2016, Vertex initiated clinical development in subjects 6 through 11 years of age with CF. Currently, 
there are 3 studies that have been completed or are ongoing in this population. A brief description of 
these studies is provided below. 
• Study VX16-661-113 (completed): A Phase 3, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics 
(PK), safety, and tolerability of TEZ/IVA combination therapy in subjects 6 through 11 years of age 
with CF, homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Study 113 was conducted in the 
US and Canada to support the indication extension of the US label to the 6 through 11-year-old age 
group. In Study 113 Part A, 13 subjects received at least 1 dose of TEZ/IVA for 14 days. In Study 113 
Part B, 70 subjects received at least 1 dose of TEZ/IVA for 24 weeks. Study 113 Part A is included in 
the TEZ/IVA EMEA-001640-PIP01-14-M04; Study 11 (Study C, Part A). 
• Study VX16-661-115 (Study 115; study conduct completed, data analysis ongoing): A Phase 3, 
double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TEZ/IVA in subjects 6 through 
11 years of age with CF, homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Subjects were 
administered TEZ/IVA for approximately 8 weeks. Study 115 was conducted in Europe and Australia 
and is included in the TEZ/IVA EMEA-001640-PIP01-14-M04; Study 12.

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/411016/2019  
Page 7/88 
 
 
 
 
 
• Study VX17-661-116 (Study 116; ongoing): A Phase 3, open-label, rollover study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with TEZ/IVA in subjects 6 years of age and older with CF, 
homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. 
The MAH stated that study VX16-661-113 is part of a clinical development program.  Vertex plans to 
submit a Line Extension grouped with a Type II variation to extend the indications of Symkevi and 
Kalydeco to children aged 6 through 11 years. The planned submission date is in the second half of 
2019. 
A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
Part A of the study VX16-661-113 is part of paediatric investigation plan, study 11  (EMEA-001640-
PIP01-14-M05). Clinical efficacy and safety will be studied in Study 12 (Study C, part B; VX16-661-
115).  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study  
A 50 mg/75 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet dosage was developed for this paediatric 
population. A summary of the TEZ/IVA and IVA formulations and dose regimen used in Studies 113, 
115, and 116 are provided in  
Table 1. No specific paediatric pharmaceutical form was required for this study. PK results from Study 
113 Part A were used to select the weight cut-off and dose regimens evaluated in Part B. A new lower 
dose strength of the TEZ/IVA tablet has been introduced for patients <40 kg to achieve target 
exposures in lighter weight patients.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
A summary of the Study 113 objectives is outlined in Table 2.  
Table 2 Study 113 Objectives 
Study design 
Study 113 is a, 2-part (Part A and Part B), open-label, multicenter study.  
Part A 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/411016/2019

Part A included a Screening Period (28 days), Treatment Period (14 days) and a Wash-out/Safety 
Follow-up Period (14 days) to evaluate off-drug response. Subjects were enrolled into 2 weight-based 
cohorts and dosed as shown in Figure 1 
Figure 1 Schematic of Study Design for Study 113 Part A  
Part B 
Part B included a Screening Period (28 days), Treatment Period (24 weeks [± 5 days]), and Safety 
Follow-up Visit (4 weeks [± 7 days]). 
A review of safety, tolerability, and PK data was completed by an internal Vertex team after completion 
of Part A to select the TEZ/IVA dose regimens for Part B. Based on this review, subjects were dosed by 
weight as shown in  
Figure 2. No dose adjustments were made throughout the duration of treatment of Part B. 
At the Week 24 Visit, subjects who completed study drug treatment were offered the opportunity to 
enrol in an extension study evaluating TEZ/IVA (enrolment was based on the eligibility criteria 
specified within the extension study). A Safety Follow-up Visit was scheduled to occur 4 weeks (± 7 
days) after the last dose of study drug. The Safety Follow-up Visit was not required for subjects who 
enrolled in the extension study within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects who 
permanently discontinued study drug treatment before the Week 24 Visit had an Early Treatment 
Termination (ETT) Visit and a Safety Follow-up Visit.

Rapporteurs’ comments 
The dosing differs between Part A and Part B for tezacaftor compound as well as for ivacaftor 
compound. 
For ivacaftor component, the dosing is 75 mg q12 h and 150 mg q12h in both parts, but the cut-off in 
weight is different i.e. 25 kg in Part A and 40 kg in Part B. For tezacaftor compound the dosing is 50 
mg qd in part A, while there is a cut-off in weight of 40 kg with either 50 or 100 mg qd in Part B.  
Study population /Sample size 
Eligibility Criteria 
Subjects who met all of the following main inclusion criteria were eligible for Part A and Part B. 
Subjects who participated in Part A may have participated in Part B, if the subject met all Part B 
eligibility criteria. 
1.  Subjects (male and female) were between the ages of 6 and 11 years, inclusive, on the date(s) of 
informed consent (and assent, if applicable) for each relevant part of the study (Part A and/or Part 
B, as applicable). 
2.  Subjects weighed >15 kg without shoes at the Screening Visit. 
3.  Subject had a confirmed diagnosis of CF and an eligible CFTR genotype. Subject genotype was 
confirmed at the Screening Visit. If the CFTR screening genotype result was not received before 
enrolment, a previous CFTR genotype lab report may have been used to establish eligibility. If a 
subject had enrolled, but their screening genotype did not confirm study eligibility, the subject 
would have been discontinued from the study. 
4.  F508del homozygous subjects were eligible for both Part A and Part B.  
Different populations of F508del heterozygous subjects were eligible for Part A and Part B: 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/411016/2019  
Page 11/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
For Part A, subjects who were heterozygous for F508del were eligible for enrolment if they had 
a second CFTR allele that met at least 1 of the following criteria: (1) the mutation was 
predicted to have residual function (2) the mutation causes a gating defect that has been 
clinically demonstrated to be IVA-responsive or (3) the mutation was not likely to respond to 
TEZ and/or IVA therapy (Truncation mutations: %PI >50% and/or SwCl >86 mmol/L, no full-
length protein; Canonical splice mutations: %PI >50% and/or SwCl >86 mmol/L, no or little 
mature mRNA; Frameshift mutations %PI >50% and/or SwCl >86 mmol/L, garbled or 
truncated protein; Class II, III, IV mutations not responsive to ivacaftor or VX-661, %PI >50% 
and/or SwCl >86 mmol/L, OR not responsive in vitro to ivacaftor and VX-661) (Refer to 
Appendix 16.1.1/Protocol Version 3.0/Appendix A of the CTR for a list of eligible mutations in 
each category) 
• 
For Part B, F508del heterozygous subjects were only eligible if clinical efficacy of TEZ/IVA had 
been demonstrated in a corresponding adult population. At the time of Part B enrolment, 
clinical studies had demonstrated efficacy for F508del heterozygous subjects with a second 
CFTR allele predicted to have residual function (evaluated in Study VX14-661-108), but not for 
the other heterozygous genotypes eligible for Part A (evaluated in Studies VX14-661-107 and 
109). Therefore, only heterozygous subjects who had a residual function mutation on the 
second CFTR allele were eligible for Part B.  
Appendix 16.1.1/Protocol Version 3.0/Appendix A of the CTR:  
Encodes a mutation predicted to have residual function 
o  Encodes a mutation with a gating defect clinically demonstrated to be ivacaftor-
responsive (subjects may be eligible if clinical benefit has been demonstrated in the 
corresponding adult population): R117H , G178R, S549N, S549R, G551D, G551S, 
G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D (Source: CFTR2.org [Internet]. Baltimore (MD): Clinical

o  Persistent chest radiograph abnormalities consistent with CF pulmonary disease 
(e.g., bronchiectasis, atelectasis, infiltrates, hyperinflation) 
o  Nasal polyps or chronic sinusitis as manifested by radiographic or computed 
tomographic abnormalities of the paranasal sinuses 
o  Evidence of gastrointestinal disease consistent with the diagnosis of CF 
o  Significant delays in growth and/or weight gain consistent with the diagnosis of 
CF 
c.  For subjects who were heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation with a second CFTR 
mutation that was not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA therapy (only eligible for Part A). 
•  Confirmed diagnosis of CF defined as a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L by 
quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis (as documented in the subject’s medical record 
or from the sweat chloride test result obtained at the Screening Visit).

with a gating defect that has been clinically demonstrated to be IVA responsive (only eligible 
for Part A) 
•  Confirmed diagnosis of CF defined as a sweat chloride value ≥ 60 mmol/L by 
quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis (as documented in the subject’s medical record 
or from the sweat chloride test result obtained at the Screening Visit). 
• 
If the sweat chloride value was <60 mmol/L, subject was required to have documented 
evidence of chronic sinopulmonary disease and/or gastrointestinal disease consistent 
with a diagnosis of CF as judged by the principal investigator, manifest by at least 1 of 
the following:

5.  Subjects had a percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) ≥40 percentage 
points adjusted for age, sex, height, and ethnicity using the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) 
equation at the Screening Visit. 
6.  Subjects with stable CF disease, as deemed by the investigator, at the Screening Visit. 
7.  Subjects were willing to remain on their stable CF medication regimen through Day 14 (Part A) or 
through Week 24 (Part B) or, if applicable, through the Safety Follow-up Visit. 
8.  Female subjects of childbearing potential had a negative serum pregnancy test at the Screening 
Visit and a negative urine pregnancy test at the Day 1 Visit before receiving the first dose of study 
drug.  
9.  Subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active met the contraception requirements 
outlined in the Protocol  
10.  As deemed by the by the investigator, the subject or their legally appointed and authorized 
representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) was able to understand protocol requirements, 
restrictions, and instructions. The subject or their legally appointed and authorized representative 
could ensure that the subject would comply with study restrictions and would be likely to complete 
the study as planned.  
Subjects who met any of the following exclusion criteria were not eligible for Part A or Part B. 
1.  History of any comorbidity reviewed at the Screening Visit that, in the opinion of the investigator, 
might have confounded the results of the study or posed an additional risk in administering study 
drug to the subject. For example: 
• 
• 
history of cirrhosis with portal hypertension 
history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes 
o  e.g., familial long QT syndrome, hypokalemia, heart failure, left ventricular 
hypertrophy, bradycardia, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, history of arrhythmia 
(ventricular and atrial fibrillation), obesity, acute neurologic events (subarachnoid 
hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident, intracranial trauma), 
and autonomic neuropathy 
2.  Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at the Screening Visit that could have interfered 
with the study assessments or posed an undue risk for the subject (as deemed by the 
investigator).

Rapporteurs’ comments 
In Part A, patients with different classes and therefore different severities of CF were allowed to be 
included. Overall, this is not expected to impact PK. 
In Part B, in and exclusion are quite similar compared to the registration trials Study VX14-661-106 
(F508del homozygous subjects) and Study VX14-661-108 (F508del heterozygous subjects). The main 
difference concerns the included mutation of F508del heterozygous subjects. According to the MAH, 
F508del heterozygous subjects with a second CFTR allele predicted to have residual function for which 
efficacy have been demonstrated in clinical studies could be included in Part B. However, during the 
MAA not all of the above mentioned mutations were accepted. The following mutations are registered 
for Symkevi: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, 
D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. Furthermore, compared to the MAA pivotal 
trial 108, currently patients with documented evidence of chronic gastrointestinal disease consistent 
with a diagnosis of CF were allowed if the sweat chloride value was <60 mmol/L. Overall, this 
difference is not expected to impact PK or safety. However, for efficacy a difference in results cannot 
be excluded. Therefore, the efficacy results should be interpreted with caution. 
Additional Dietary Restrictions/Prohibited Medications 
Part A 
To avoid variable PK results due to uncontrolled use of dietary/nutritional supplements, tobacco, juices, 
or other foods and medications that may affect drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, subjects 
were required to comply with study restrictions summarized in Table 3.

Prohibited medications and certain foods were not allowed in Part B (Screening Period through Week 
24) as summarized in Table 4. Both TEZ and IVA are metabolized predominantly via the hepatic 
enzymatic pathway using CYP3A4. Inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A have the potential to significantly 
alter the exposure of TEZ and IVA; therefore, the use of known CYP3A inducers and inhibitors was 
restricted in this study. 
Table 4 Lifestyle Guidelines and Study Restrictions (Part B) 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Restrictions are similar to the pivotal trials and acceptable. Study restrictions which were applied, e.g. 
to avoid inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4, are expected to reduce variability in PK response in the 
study population. CYP3A4 is fully mature at an age of 6, so no different effects of inhibition of CYP3A4 
as compared to older patients are expected. The advice regarding CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers as 
stated in the SmPC for patients 12 years of age and older is expected to be applicable also for the 6-11 
years patient population. 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Subjects abstained from all restricted concomitant medications as described in the exclusion criteria. 
Information regarding all prior and concomitant medications (including the subject's CF medications, 
other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies) administered from 4 weeks before the 
Screening Period through the Safety Follow-up Visit were recorded in each subject's source documents 
and electronic case report form. 
Subjects were recommended to remain on their stable CF medication regimen from 4 weeks before 
Day 1 through Day 14 (Part A) or through Week 24 (Part B) or, if applicable, through the Safety 
Follow-up Visit. Stable medication regimen was defined as the current medication regimen for CF 
(except for commercially available CFTR modulators) that subjects had been following for at least 4 
weeks before Day 1. Subjects were prohibited from initiating long-term treatment with new medication

from 28 days before Day 1 through the Safety Follow-up Visit, unless discussed and approved by the 
Vertex medical monitor. Guidelines for stable medication regimens for CF are as follows: 
•  Subjects who took daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics were 
advised to remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
•  Subjects who took inhaled cycling antibiotics were advised to continue on their prior schedule. 
The timing of the first dose of study drug was synchronized as closely as possible to the first 
day of inhaled cycling antibiotics in the cycle. 
•  Subjects who alternated 2 different antibiotics monthly were advised to remain on the same 
schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug was synchronized as 
closely as possible to the first day of 1 of the inhaled alternating antibiotics. 
•  Subjects were permitted to receive doses of prednisone (or prednisolone) of up to 10 mg qd 
(chronically), or prednisone (or prednisolone) 60 mg qd for up to 5 days with tapering down to 
10 mg qd within 2 weeks, without prior approval of the medical monitor. 
o 
Information about bronchodilator use during the study was collected and documented. 
Subjects who used a bronchodilator had their spirometry assessments performed 
according to the guidelines. 
o  Subjects were permitted to use concomitant medications known to prolong the QT 
interval with caution during the study, even though the effect of TEZ/IVA on the QT 
interval had been evaluated in a thorough QT study, which demonstrated no 
prolongation of the QT interval. Consideration was given to obtaining an ECG when 
concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval was administered 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Prior and Concomitant Medications are considered acceptable.

Efficacy parameters are the usual parameters for measuring efficacy in CF in a 24 weeks study. 
Exacerbations were measured as safety events.  
Safety parameters are sufficient to capture relevant safety issues.  
Statistical Methods 
Sample Size and Power 
Part A 
Sample size calculations were conducted to estimate the precision in determining TEZ clearance in 
paediatric subjects in the 2 weight-based cohorts. The method used noncompartmental analysis 
(NCA)-based PK parameters, such as clearance and volume, in adults with the assumption that there 
would be similar variability in clearance in adults and paediatric subjects 6 through 11 years of age 
within each weight group. The calculations indicated that data from 8 subjects would allow 80% power 
to target a 95% CI within 60% and 140% of the geometric mean (geo mean) estimate of clearance for 
TEZ in each paediatric subgroup (cohort). Therefore, approximately 16 subjects (approximately 8 
subjects in each cohort) were planned for enrolment in Part A. 
Part B 
Planned enrollment was approximately 56 subjects. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, approximately 50 
subjects were expected to complete Part B. The incidence of AEs is an important safety endpoint. With 
a total sample size of 50 subjects completing the study, there would be a 92.3% chance of observing 
AEs in at least 1 subject if the true incidence rate were 5%, and a 99.5% chance of observing AEs in at 
least 1 subject if the true incidence rate were 10%. These probabilities were calculated by assuming a 
binomial distribution for the number of AEs using SAS®. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Part A 
Assuming variability in PK in adults and patients 6-11 years of age is comparable, the samples size 
calculation is agreed. The target of 8 patients per cohort was not fully met in Part A, however, PK data 
were also obtained in Part B of the study, confirming PK in patients 6-11 years of age. 
Part B 
The sample size calculation indicates that AEs with true incidence rate of 5% or more will be very likely 
picked up. However, such a small sample size hampers the interpretation of the safety data for AES 
with lower incidence rates.  Therefore, it will be difficult to draw safety conclusions based on this small 
sample size.  
Analysis Sets 
Part A 
The following analysis sets are defined: Part A - All Subjects Set and Part A - Safety Set. Assignment of 
subjects to analysis sets was performed prior to the data-cut for the IA following completion of Part A. 
The Part A - All Subjects Set is defined as subjects who consented to Part A of the study or received at 
least 1 dose of study drug in Part A of the study. 
The Part A - Safety Set is defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part A of 
the study.

Part B 
The following analysis sets were defined for Part B: Safety Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), and FAS – LCI 
Substudy. 
The Part B Safety Set was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part B 
of the study. 
The Part B FAS was defined as all subjects who carried the intended CFTR mutations and received at 
least 1 dose of study drug in Part B of the study. The FAS was used for all efficacy analyses except for 
LCI endpoints. 
The Part B FAS - LCI substudy was defined as all subjects who carried the intended CFTR mutations 
and received at least 1 dose of study drug in Part B of the study and had at least 1 LCI measurement. 
The FAS-LCI substudy was used for efficacy analyses of exploratory LCI endpoints. 
Variables 
Definition of Treatment-emergent Period 
Part A 
The treatment-emergent (TE) period for Part A corresponds to data from the first dose of study drug in 
Part A to the Safety Follow-up Visit in Part A, or 14 days after the last dose in Part A for subjects who 
did not have a Safety Follow-up Visit. 
Part B 
The treatment-emergent period for Part B corresponds to data from the first dose of study drug to 28 
days after the last dose of the study drug, or to the date of completion of study participation, 
whichever occurred first. Completion of study participation was defined as one of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For subjects who completed Part B and enrolled in the extension study within 28 days of the 
Week 24 Visit: the last participation date 
For subjects who completed Part B and did not enrol in the extension study within 28 days of 
the Week 24 Visit: the Safety Follow-up Visit 
For subjects who prematurely discontinued study drug treatment, but did not withdraw 
consent: the latest of ETT Visit, or Safety Follow-up Visit (if required) 
For subjects who withdrew consent: date of withdrawal of consent 
Definition of Baseline 
Part A baseline: Baseline for Part A was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement 
(scheduled or unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in Part A. For ECGs, baseline 
values were the average of the 3 pre-treatment measurements on Day 1 of Part A. 
Part B baseline: Baseline for Part B was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement 
(scheduled or unscheduled) collected prior to the first dose of study drug in Part B. For ECGs, baseline 
values were the average of the 3 pre-treatment measurements on Day 1 of Part B. For sweat chloride, 
the baseline values were the mean of the last values on the left and the right arm prior to the first 
dose of the study. 
Absolute change from baseline was calculated as post-baseline value – baseline value. 
Relative change from baseline was calculated and expressed in percentage as 100 × (post-baseline 
value – baseline value)/ baseline value.

Missing Data and Outliers 
Incomplete/Missing data were not imputed, unless specified otherwise. 
Outliers: No formal statistical analyses were performed to detect or remedy the presence of statistical 
outliers, unless specified otherwise. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
No removal of outliers is considered acceptable.  
Pharmacokinetic Data 
Samples were analysed using validated bioanalytical methods in compliance with Vertex or designee 
standard operating procedures (SOPs). Descriptions of the assay and validation data are provided in 
separate reports: 
For the determination of TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ in human plasma: 
• Method validation Report L105 
• Bioanalytical Report O283 
For the determination of IVA, M1-IVA, M6-IVA in human plasma: 
• Method validation Report L114 
• Bioanalytical Report O284 
Calibration curves in human plasma for all 6 analytes ranged from 2.00 to 2000 ng/mL. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
TEZ and its metabolites as well as IVA and its metabolites in plasma were assayed according to 
previously reported methods. Calibration curves were in agreement with requirements as stated in the 
EMA bioanalytical guidance 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed upon the entire population given a dose of study drug(s), 
whether the subject completed all treatments or not, and if the dataset(s) supported those analyses as 
described in the Clinical Pharmacology Analysis Plan (CPAP). Phoenix WinNonlin Professional Edition v. 
7.0 was used to evaluate drug concentration - time profiles and generate pharmacokinetic parameters.  
PK parameters were determined using standard non-compartmental methods. PK parameters 
calculated in non-compartmental analysis included Cmax, tmax, Ctrough, t½, CLss/F, Vss/F, and AUCτ. The 
linear/log trapezoidal rule was used to estimate AUC with at least 4 quantifiable concentration 
timepoints. The AUCτ calculation was based on the assumption that the drug concentration at the end 
of dosing interval (24 hours for TEZ and 12 hours for IVA) would be equal to the pre-dose 
concentration (0 hour) at steady state. PK parameters were summarized in terms of the total number 
of values (N), mean, and standard deviation (SD), minimum (min), median, maximum (max), 
coefficient of variation (CV%), geometric mean (geo mean), and CV% geo mean. For summary 
statistics of concentration-time series, N, total values below the limits of quantification (NBLQ), mean, 
SD, min, median, max, and CV%, were presented.  
Efficacy Analysis (Part B Only) 
There was no multiplicity adjustment in this study; P values provided for the secondary and other 
endpoints are considered nominal.

All efficacy analyses described in this section were based on the FAS, unless specified otherwise. The 
analysis included all available measurements through the last assessment, including measurements 
after treatment discontinuation. 
Absolute Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 Through Week 24 
This endpoint is defined as the average of the absolute changes from baseline in ppFEV1 at each post-
baseline scheduled visit. 
Percent predicted FEV1 is the ratio of FEV1 (L) to the predicted FEV1 (L), expressed as a percentage. 
The predicted FEV1 was calculated using the Quanjer GLI-2012 Regression Equations and Lookup 
Tables, adjusting for age, height, sex and ethnicity. 
Absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 was analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-
based mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach that included visit and baseline 
ppFEV1 (continuous) as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect. An unstructured (co)variance 
structure was used to model the within-subject errors. If the model failed to converge, a compound 
symmetry covariance structure was considered. The degrees of freedom of the denominator was 
approximated by the Kenward-Roger’s method. 
The primary result obtained from the model was the average treatment effect through Week 24. The 
corresponding least squares mean (LS mean), standard error (SE), the 95% CI, and P value were 
provided. 
Furthermore, absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 at each post-baseline scheduled visit was 
estimated from the main model above. The LS mean at Week 24, with the corresponding 2-sided 95% 
CIs and P values, were provided; LS mean and the corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were provided for 
other post-baseline scheduled visits. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The repeated measurements analysis, including the choice for random effects, covariance matrix and 
degrees of freedom, is considered standard and agreed. However, if drop-out would be substantial, 
then the estimated effect by this analysis is rather the hypothetical effect as if no patients would have 
drop-out assuming that trajectories for drop-out patients would have been as the trajectories of 
similar patients that did not drop-out.  
Relative Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 Through Week 24 
A similar MMRM model as described for absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 
used for this variable using the same approach as described for the absolute change in ppFEV1 from 
baseline. 
Absolute Change from Baseline in Weight, Height, BMI, and Associated z-Scores At Week 24 
Weight, height, and BMI z-scores were calculated using the CDC growth charts as described in the 
SAP. 
A similar MMRM model was used for the above variables using the same approach as described for the 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24. The MMRM included corresponding 
baseline values (continuous) as covariates instead of baseline ppFEV1. For these variables, the 
assessment of efficacy was primarily based on the estimated mean change from baseline at Week 24. 
Absolute Change from Baseline in Sweat Chloride Through Week 4 and Through Week 24 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/411016/2019

A similar MMRM model was used for this variable, using the same approach as described for the 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline. The MMRM included baseline sweat chloride value as a 
covariate instead of baseline ppFEV1. Because the first post-baseline assessment of sweat chloride was 
performed at Week 4, the estimated mean change at Week 4 was used to assess the absolute change 
in sweat chloride from baseline through Week 4. 
Absolute Change from Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score Through Week 24 
A similar MMRM model was used for this variable, using the same approach as described for the 
absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline. The MMRM included the baseline CFQ-R respiratory domain 
score as a covariate instead of baseline ppFEV1. 
Safety Data 
Safety was the primary objective of Part B and a secondary objective of Part A. 
Safety analyses were based on the Safety Set in each study part. Only descriptive analysis of safety 
was performed (i.e., no statistical hypothesis testing was performed). Safety endpoints are 
summarized using descriptive summary statistics. The primary analysis of safety is based on the total 
subjects in the Safety Set, and a by-dose level summary is also provided. Due to the small sample 
sizes in the dosage level subgroups, the by-dose level summary should be interpreted with caution. 
Throughout this section, “change” refers to absolute change from baseline. 
Adverse Events 
Adverse events were coded according to MedDRA and categorized as pretreatment AEs, TEAEs, or 
post-treatment AEs for each study part as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Pretreatment AE: any AE that started before the first dose of study drug in Part A. 
TEAE: any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed during the TE period for 
Part A. 
Post-treatment AE: any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed beyond the 
TE period for Part A. For subjects from Part A who enrolled in Part B, an AE that increased in 
severity on or after the first dose of study drug in Part B will not be considered as a post-
treatment AE. 
For AEs with missing or partial start dates, if there was no clear evidence that the AEs started 
before or after study treatment for Part A, then the AEs were classified as TEAEs. 
For Part B , as an intermediate step for programming purposes, imputation rules for missing or 
partially missing AE start/end dates are defined in Appendix 16.1.9/SAP Part B Version 
1.0/Section 12.5 of CTR. 
For all AEs, the action taken on the CRF for TEZ/IVA FDC tablet (AM dose) was collected separately 
from the AE action taken for the IVA tablet (PM dose). 
Respiratory Events and Symptoms (Part B only) 
Respiratory symptoms were defined as any TEAEs for the following 3 PTs: Chest discomfort, Dyspnoea,  
Respiration abnormal 
Respiratory events were defined as any of the previously mentioned respiratory symptoms, or any 
TEAEs for the following 4 additional PTs: Asthma, Bronchial hyperreactivity, Bronchospasm, Wheezing.

Overall, the analyses and definitions are in agreement with usual requirements. Important to note is 
that there was no multiplicity adjustment in this study and that testing was not planned to be 
confirmatory (efficacy was a secondary objective); P values provided for the secondary and other 
endpoints are thus considered descriptive.  
Changes in Conduct of Study 
The Study 113 protocol was amended 2 times. Table 6 provides a list of the protocol versions, their 
dates, and the major changes introduced with every amendment. 
Table 6 Summary of Study VX15-661-113 Protocol Amendments
Statistical Analysis Plan 
The following changes were made in the SAP for Part B compared to the protocol: 
• The All Subjects Set for Part B was removed in the SAP, due to the fact that the All Subjects Set for 
Part B would be the same for the Safety Set Part B, which included all subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study drug in Part B. Subject data listings were presented based on the Safety Set Part B. 
• The details of mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) approach was updated in the SAP 
considering the study design and study population. 
No changes were made to the analysis planned in Version 1.0 of the IA SAP for Part A or Version 1.0 of 
the SAP for Part B. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
The protocols only specify to use an unstructured (co)variance structure to model the within-subject 
errors and no random effect for subject, while the SAP does specify (additionally) a random effect for 
subject. Because the within-subject errors are modelled with an unstructured (co)variance structure, 
this is not expected to affect the estimated effect and precision: it will only mean that the total 
covariance structure is split differently. Therefore, this change is considered acceptable.   
Thus, the changes in the conduct of the study are acceptable and not considered of major influence.

Table 11 Subject Demographics, Part B Safety Set 
In total, 61 subjects (87.1%) were homozygous for the F508del mutation and 9 subjects (12.9%) were 
heterozygous for F508del and a second allele that results in residual CFTR function. At baseline, the 
mean ppFEV1 was 91.1%.  
Most subjects (88.6%) weighed <40 kg at baseline. The mean (SD) weight at baseline was 30.7 (10.0) 
kg, and the mean weight z-score was 0.20 (0.94), indicating that baseline weights were above average 
for subjects’ age and sex. Similarly, the mean (SD) baseline BMI was 17.44 (2.69) kg/m2 and the 
mean (SD) baseline BMI z-score was 0.37 (0.90). The mean (SD) baseline height was 131.0 (13.0) cm 
and mean (SD) baseline height z-score was -0.07 (0.98). 
At baseline, the majority of subjects used an inhaled bronchodilator (98.6%), dornase alfa (88.6%), 
and inhaled hypertonic saline (72.9%). The majority of subjects (78.6%) were negative for 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the 2 years prior to the start of Part B. (Table 12)

Rapporteurs’ comments 
Most patients (87.1%) were homozygous for the F508del mutation.  The median age in Part B was 8.0 
years covering the full age range 6 to 11 years. Mean baseline ppFEV1 was 91.1% indication FEV1 was 
still well preserved, but the range (63.4-188.0%) indicated that subjects could already have impaired 
FEV1. Most subjects (88.6%) weighed <40 kg at baseline. The mean (SD) weight z-score (0.20 (0.94)) 
and mean (SD) BMI z-score (0.37 (0.90)) indicated that baseline weights and BMI were above average 
for subjects’ age and sex. While the mean (SD) weight Z-score at baseline was 0.20 (0.94), the 
median (range) was 0.05 (-1.52, 2.58) which indicates that some children were obese. Comparing the 
mean and median weight Z-scores shows that the distribution is somehow skewed.  
Overall, the baseline data provided show the highest severity of the disease in homozygous F508del 
subjects as expected even at this young age. Homozygopus F508del subjects had a median (min, max)  
weight-for-age percentile of 51.46 (6.43, 99.50) as compared to heterozygous patients (i.e., 74.11 
[11.83, 95.71). Similarly, median (min, max) height-for-age percentile is 39.42 (2.50, 99.10) as

compared to 51.33 (21.03, 93.70). This results in median (min, max)  BMI percentile of 69.05 (7.47, 
98.43) vs. 70.77 (16.41, 94.55) in heterozygous patients. In subjects with cystic fibrosis aged 2 to 18 
years the target is 0 SD (50th percentile) of BMI for a healthy, same-age population. This is considered 
as indicative of adequate nutritional status. However, when assessing BMI the change in height 
percentile/SD score should be considered, as stunted (low height-for-age) children can have a normal 
BMI (Turck et al 2016). This seems to be the case in the population of homozygous F508del children 
for whom the height percentile is well below the 50th percentile in spite of which the BMI percentile is 
above 50.    
Mean sweat chloride was higher in children homozygous for F508 CFTR. This difference in sweat 
chloride is considered a characteristic of the difference in disease genotype. 
Small, irrelevant differences were seen in the use of medication.   
Treatment Compliance 
In Part B, the mean (SD) compliance was 99.50% (2.99%). One (1.4%) subject was <80% compliant.  
Protocol Deviations 
Part A: There were no IPDs in Part A 
Part B 
In total, 3 subjects had IPDs: 
•  One subject (TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h) was <80% compliant with study drug. 
•  One subject (TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h) was enrolled in the study without review of their 
coagulation lab results. 
•  One subject (TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h) began the washout of physician-prescribed 
LUM/IVA prior to signing the ICF. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
The compliance with therapy was high (99.5%).  
Protocol deviations are not considered to be of major influence on the efficacy, except for the early 
beginning of the washout of physician-prescribed LUM/IVA in one subject, because baseline values e.g. 
FEV1 value could be affected.

Rapporteurs’ comments  
Although details on the applied modelling and simulations were not provided, the actual PK outcome of 
part B appears to conform that exposure to TEZ and IVA in paediatric patients 6-11 years of age <40 
kg and ≥40 kg is comparable.  
Further, in Part A and Part B, TEZ and IVA exposures in subjects 6 through 11 years of age appear 
within the range of exposures in subjects 12 years of age and older (PK data from EPAR) when given in 
combination, though mean exposure to TEZ and IVA appear at the lower end of the exposure ranges

Figure 5 MMRM Analysis of Absolute Change from Baseline in ppFEV1 (Percentage Points) at Each Visit, 
Part B Full Analysis Set 
F/F and F/RF subjects had similar absolute increases from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24. For 
F/F subjects, the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was 0.9 (6.7) 
percentage points. For F/RF subjects, the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through 
Week 24 was 0.9 (5.1) percentage points.  
These data are consistent with the well-preserved baseline lung function values.  
Rapporteurs’ comments 
The LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 0.9 percentage points 
(95% CI: -0.6, 2.3; nominal P value: 0.2361). This change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 
is lower compared to the MAA in adults and adolescents with homozygous F508del mutation (3.4, 95% 
CI: 2.7, 4.0). The less impaired lung function in this younger population may be of influence for this 
difference, but also the number of patients is low (n=70), making it more difficult to draw final 
conclusions.   
Furthermore, the population was mixed consisting of homozygous F508del mutation patients and 
heterozygous F508del mutation patients. Patients heterozygous for F508del mutation + residual 
function mutation are less severely affected than homozygous F508del mutation patients. As the vast 
majority of patients was homozygous for the F508del mutation (87.1%), the results are driven by this 
group. Within the limitations of performing a subanalysis, patients with F/F and F/RF mutations had 
similar mean (SD) absolute increases from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24, i.e. 0.9 (6.7) 
percentage points in F/F subjects and 0.9 (5.1) percentage in F/RF subjects. In the adult/adolescents 
studies, study VX14-661-106 and study VX14-661-108, absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1

through Week 24 was 3.4 and 6.5 in respectively F/F subjects and F/RF subjects. The well-preserved 
baseline lung function values may be the reason for the small increase in mean ppFEV1.  
All included children with heterozygous F/RF had mutation as allowed in the label.  
No missing data sensitivity analysis was performed. This is acceptable for two reasons: premature 
discontinuation was small (4.3%) and efficacy is a secondary objective and no statistical conclusion 
can be drawn, because no multiplicity correction was applied.  
Unfortunately, the subanalysis by gender for the homozygous patients was not included in the 
question. At the moment, this issue is not pursued further, because the applicant will submit a 
variation for a line extension in children aged 6 through 11 years. It is expected that more results will 
become available through Study VX16-661-115. At that time, the results will be assessed together.   
Relative Change from Baseline in ppFEV1 Through Week 24 
The LS mean relative change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 1.4% (95% CI: -0.4, 3.1; 
nominal P value: 0.1230). 
Absolute Change from Baseline in Weight, Height, BMI, and Associated z-scores at Week 24 
Table 20 presents the MMRM analysis results for BMI, weight, height, and associated z-scores. 
The LS mean absolute change from baseline in weight at Week 24 was 1.7 kg (95% CI: 1.3, 2.0; 
nominal P value <0.0001). The LS mean absolute change from baseline in height at Week 24 was 2.7 
cm (95% CI: 2.4, 2.9; nominal P value <0.0001). The LS mean absolute change from baseline in BMI 
at Week 24 was 0.23 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.4; nominal P value = 0.0081). 
The LS mean absolute change from baseline in weight z-score at Week 24 was 0.0 (95% CI: -0.05, 
0.05; nominal P value = 0.9490). The LS mean absolute change from baseline in height z-score at 
Week 24 was 0.0 (95% CI: -0.05, 0.05; nominal P value = 0.9953). The LS mean absolute change 
from baseline in BMI z-score at Week 24 was -0.03 (95% CI: -0.10, 0.04; nominal P value = 0.4456).

Faecal elastase-1 assessments were not performed in Study 113. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
There was no evidence of a gain in Weight z-score, Height z-score and BMI z-score. An extra-
pulmonary effect in weight, height of BMI is therefore not (yet) established, although interpretation of 
the data is hampered by the limited number of patients included.  
No responder analysis was performed for these endpoints despite a request by the CHMP. As the vast 
majority of the population were patient with F/F mutation, the results can be considered as indicative 
for this population. In the pivotal study 106 in subjects homozygous F508del similar results were seen, 
i.e., the mean within-group change in BMI after 24 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA was 0.18 kg/m2 
which suggests that the effect of TEZ/IVA on anthropometric parameters is limited for the homozygous 
F508del population.  
Absolute Change from Baseline in Sweat Chloride Through Week 4 and Week 24 
Because the first post-baseline assessment of sweat chloride was performed at Week 4, the estimated 
mean change at Week 4 was used to assess the absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline 
through Week 4. 
The LS mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 4 was -13.0 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -16.2, -9.9; nominal P value<0.0001). The LS mean absolute change from baseline through 
Week 24 was -14.5 (95% CI: -17.4, -11.6; nominal P value <0.0001).

The change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 4 (-13.0 mmol/L) or through Week 24 (-
14.5 mmol/L) is considered relevant for the establishment of the mode of action.  
Absolute Change from Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Through Week 24

Figure 6 MMRM Analysis of Absolute Change from Baseline in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score (Child 
Version) at Each Visit 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Using the MMRM analysis as defined in the SAP, the LS mean absolute change from baseline through 
week 24 in CFQ-R respiratory domain score of 3.4 points (95% CI: 1.4, 5.5; nominal P value = 
0.0013) being below the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Additional 
information about the responder rate, i.e. the percentage of homozygous F508del patients who 
achieved a change from baseline through week 24 ≥ 4, was considered needed for insight how many 
patients experience a benefit in quality of life. The MAH argues that there is no consensus MCID for the 
Child Version of the questionnaire. For these reasons, no analysis of change from baseline in CFQ-R ≥4 
points is presented. However, in previous procedures the MAH accepted the minimal clinically 
important difference (MCID) of 4 points and this instrument has been used as a primary endpoint for 
regulatory approval. Although the general arguments against the subanalysis are acknowledged, 
consistency is expected across procedures unless the scientific evidence leads to change of opinion on 
this issue.  
When using the posthoc LS mean absolute change from baseline at week 24 in CFQ-R respiratory 
domain score (5.4 points) was above the MCID. This ad-hoc analysis is not further motived by the 
MAH, but it may be motived by the course of the scores.   
Lung Clearance Index (Optional Exploratory Substudy) 
Lung clearance index was included as an exploratory endpoint in this study to evaluate a LCI device 
and over-reading process that were new to the Vertex CF program.  
The LS mean (95% CI) absolute change from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 24 was 0.09 (-0.32, 
0.49). The LS mean (95% CI) absolute change from baseline in LCI5.0 through Week 24 was 0.05 (-
0.15, 0.26). 
Evaluation of LCI data quality from the new device is ongoing. This ongoing analysis is not summarized 
in this report; additional information may be provided in another report.

Rapporteurs’ comments 
Lung clearance index is considered an acceptable alternative for traditional pulmonary function test 
(PFT) using FEV1. Lung clearance index is capable to detect abnormalities in mild and moderate stages 
of disease early and reflect changes in disease severity directly. However, there is limited experience 
of this as an outcome measure, and an established clinically relevant magnitude of benefit is not 
established yet.  
In this exploratory substudy no benefit could be established, as LS mean (95% CI) absolute change 
from baseline in LCI2.5 through Week 24 increased (0.09 (-0.32, 0.49)), reflecting worsening.

Adverse events  
Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any AE that increased in severity or that was 
newly developed at or after the first dose of study drug through the end of the treatment-emergent 
period. TEAEs will hereafter be referred to as AEs.

In total, 12 subjects (92.3%) had AEs during the treatment-emergent period. There were no deaths, 
serious, severe or life-threatening AEs. No subject had an AE that led to study drug interruption or 
discontinuation. All AEs were either mild (9 subjects [69.2%]) or moderate (3 subjects [23.1%]) in 
severity. Most subjects had AEs that were not related (5 subjects [38.5%]) or unlikely related (3 
subjects [23.1%]) to study drug. 
Part B 
A total of 65 (92.9%) subjects had at least 1 AE in Part B. Overall, the majority of subjects had AEs 
that were either mild (48.6%) or moderate (40.0%) in severity; no deaths and no life-threatening AEs 
occurred in Part B. 
A total of 19 (27.1%) subjects had an AE considered to be related or possibly related to study drug. 
A total of 6 (8.6%) subjects had SAEs, but none of the SAEs were considered to be related to study 
drug. By severity, 3 (4.3%) subjects had Grade 3/4 AEs. Among the subjects with Grade 3/4 AEs, 3 
subjects had severe (Grade 3) AEs, and no subject had a life-threatening (Grade 4) AE. One (1.4%) 
subject had an AE that led to treatment discontinuation and 4 (5.7%) subjects had AEs that led to 
treatment interruption.

Rapporteurs’ comments 
The primary objective of Part B is to investigate the safety and tolerability. In this part, the dosing was 
for subjects ≥ 40 kg identical to the dosing in adults in adolescents. For children with a weight < 40 kg 
at baseline the dosing was adapted.  
In the total group, overall, distribution of AEs is within normal expectation; 3 patients with severe 
events, no life- threatening events and no deaths, 6 patients with SAE of which no related. For more 
detailed assessments see below.   
More AEs were severe Grade 3/4 in subjects <40 kg versus ≥40 kg. However, the number of patients 
in  ≥40 kg group is low i.e. N = 8, and the results should be interpreted with caution. With the 
submission of the variation to extend the indications of Symkevi and Kalydeco to children aged 6 
through 11 years, more studies will be submitted and this issue will be further analysed during the 
variation.

No subject had a Grade 4 (life-threatening) AE. There were 3 (4.3%) subjects with Grade 3 (severe) 
AEs. No Grade 3 AE occurred in >1 subject. Grade 3 AEs included infective pulmonary exacerbation of 
CF, sinusitis, breath odor, and snoring.  
Rapporteurs’ comments 
No life-threating SAE were observed. The SAE observed, infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF, and 
sinusitis, are common events in CF population.  
Relationship of Adverse Events 
Part A 
The incidence of AEs in Part A and their relationship to study drug is summarized in Table 28. Most of 
the subjects had AEs that were considered not related (i.e. not related or unlikely related) to study 
drug. A total of 4 (30.8%) subjects had AEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to 
study drug (i.e. related or possibly related). 
The most common related or possibly related AE (occurring in >1 subject) was cough, which occurred 
in 2 subjects (15.4%).

Related AEs are known AEs already observed in the adult and adolescent population.  
Adverse Events Associated With Elevated Transaminases 
An AE associated with elevated transaminases was pre-defined as one of the following PTs: 
• Alanine aminotransferase abnormal, Alanine aminotransferase increased 
• Aspartate aminotransferase abnormal, Aspartate aminotransferase increased 
• Hepatic enzyme abnormal, Hepatic enzyme increased 
• Hypertransaminasaemia 
• Liver function test abnormal, Liver function test increased 
• Transaminases abnormal, Transaminases increased 
In total, 6 subjects (8.6%) had an AE associated with elevated transaminases. All of these subjects 
had an AE of ALT increased, and 2 subjects had an AE of AST increased as well. All of the AEs 
associated with elevated transaminases were mild. None of the AEs associated with elevated

transaminases led to discontinuation of study drug or death. None of the AEs associated with 
transaminase elevations were serious. 
Table 30 Summary of Treatment-emergent Elevated Transaminase Events, Part B Safety Set
Rapporteurs’ comments 
In total, 6 subjects (8.6%) had an AE associated with elevated transaminases i.e. ALT either or not in 
combination with AST. All of the AEs associated with elevated transaminases were mild. Elevated 
transaminases were observed before in ivacaftor, but not in Symkevi. Moreover, the shift table of 
transaminases below showed that the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) in adult and 
adolescent population were somewhat lower.  
Adverse Events Associated With Respiratory Symptoms and Respiratory Events 
Respiratory AEs and symptoms are a group of PTs pre-defined to explore select AEs within the 
respiratory system. These PTs included in this group were used to assess and characterize the 
respiratory symptoms/events of LUM/IVA, as included in the product labels. 
Respiratory symptoms were defined as AEs with any of the following PTs: Chest discomfort, Dyspnea,  
Respiration abnormal. 
Respiratory events were defined as AEs with any of the following PTs: Asthma, Bronchial 
hyperreactivity, Bronchospasm, Wheezing, Chest discomfort, Dyspnea, Respiration abnormal. 
In total, 2 subjects had a respiratory symptom and/or respiratory event. Two subjects (2.9%) had AEs 
of respiration abnormal (considered a respiratory symptom and an event). One of these 2 subjects had 
a mild AE of respiration abnormal, and the other subject had a moderate AE of respiration abnormal. 
No subject had an AE of chest discomfort, dyspnea, asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, 
or wheezing. No subject had a respiratory symptom or event that led to treatment discontinuation or 
interruption or was considered serious.

Rapporteurs’ comments 
The number of patients is low, thus conclusions need to be drawn with caution. Within this limitation, 
Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor appears to have a low incidence of adverse events associated 
with respiratory symptoms, and respiratory events (2.9%).  
Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths in Part A or Part B.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Part A 
There were no SAEs in Part A. 
Part B 
In total, 6 subjects (8.6%) had a SAE. Only 1 SAE occurred in >1 subject: infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of CF (occurring in 2 [2.9%] subjects). None of these SAEs were considered related to 
study drug by the investigator.  
Table 31 Serious Adverse Events by Preferred Term, Part B Safety Set 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Six patients had a SAE. All SAEs were considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator.  
Therefore, these SAE are not considered as a new safety signal.  
Adverse Events That Led to Discontinuation or Interruption of Study Drug 
Part A 
No AE led to study drug discontinuation or interruption. 
Part B

Adverse Events That Led to Discontinuation of Study Drug 
One subject discontinued study drug due to an SAE of constipation, which was considered moderate in 
severity, and unlikely related to study drug. 
Adverse Events That Led to Interruption of Study Drug 
In total, 4 subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption. No AE that led to treatment interruption 
occurred in >1 subject. Among the subjects with AEs that led to treatment interruption, 2 subjects had 
AEs that were considered related or possibly related to study drug (1 subject with an AE of blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased and 1 subject with AEs of liver laboratory parameters increased). No 
related AE that led to treatment interruption was serious. All related AEs that led to interruption 
resolved without any treatment. 
Rapporteurs’ comment 
Two subjects with interruption of study drug had AEs related to study drug. The AEs resolved without 
any treatment. The AEs are known and are not considered as a new safety signal.  
Liver Function Tests 
Part A 
There were no AEs related to LFTs during Part A. Overall, no clinically meaningful trend in LFT results 
was identified. 
Part B 
The mean values for LFT parameters were generally within normal ranges at all visits during the TE 
Period. No clinically meaningful trends were observed. Adverse events associated with elevated 
transaminases are discussed above. 
Liver function test results that met threshold criteria are summarized in Table 32. Overall, the 
incidence of ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN was 10.0%, 4.3%, and 1.4%, respectively. No subject 
had an elevated ALT or AST level >3 x ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin >2 × ULN. 
There were 3 (4.3%) subjects with AEs of blood ALP increased and 2 (2.9%) subjects with AEs of GGT 
increased. One subject had AEs of liver enzymes increased that led to study drug interruption. For the 
2 other subjects with ALP increased, the AE was not serious, mild, and did not result in interruption or 
discontinuation of study drug. For the other subject with an AE of GGT increased, the AE was 
considered not serious, mild, not related to study drug, and did not require treatment or study drug 
interruption. 
Overall, the LFT data were consistent with the expected outcomes in paediatric patients with CF, who 
are known to have background LFT abnormalities.

Table 32 Threshold Analysis of Liver Function Tests during the Treatment-emergent Period, Part B Safety 
Set
Rapporteurs’ comments 
In the adult and adolescent population, during the placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies the incidence of 
maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 x ULN were in Symkevi in combination with 
ivacaftor 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4%. The increases in LFT are in children are somewhat higher compared 
to the outcomes in the adult and adolescent population. In ivacaftor and lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
combination, also ALT and AST elevations appeared to be higher than that observed in subjects 12 
years of age and older. These observations are consistent with information available in the published 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of

literature that indicates transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than in 
adults.  
Vitamin Levels 
Part A 
There were no AEs related to vitamin levels during Part A and no clinically meaningful change in 
vitamin levels was observed. 
Part B 
No clinically meaningful trends that could be attributed to TEZ/IVA were observed. There were 2 
subjects with AEs related to vitamin panels; 1 subject had elevated vitamin E levels and 1 subject had 
elevated vitamin B12 levels. Both vitamin-related AEs were mild, considered unrelated or unlikely 
related to study drug, and did not result in study drug interruption or discontinuation. 
Lipid Panels 
Part A 
There were no AEs in Part A associated with lipid panels. 
Part B 
No subject had an AE related to lipid panels in Part B. There were no identifiable trends in lipid panels 
that could be attributed to TEZ/IVA. 
Other Serum Chemistry 
Part B 
Serum chemistry lab results were generally within the normal range. No trends in serum chemistry 
labs that could be attributed to TEZ/IVA were identified. 
In total, 3 subjects had AEs related to serum chemistry tests. One subject had an AE of creatine 
phosphokinase increased that was moderate in severity, non-serious, and considered related to study 
drug. This event resolved without any treatment, after study drug interruption. One subject had an AE 
of lipase increased that was mild and considered not related to study drug. One subject had an AE of 
GGT increased that was mild and considered not related to study drug. 
Haematology 
Part B 
Haematology lab results were generally within the normal range in Part B. No trends in haematology 
lab results that could be attributed to TEZ/IVA were observed. 
In total, 2 subjects had AEs related to haematology results. Both subjects had 2 AEs related to 
haematology results, which were the same for both subjects: neutrophil count decreased and white 
blood cell count decreased. One subject’s AEs were mild and considered possibly related to study drug. 
The other subject’s AEs were mild and considered unlikely related to study drug. 
Coagulation

One subject had 3 AEs related to laboratory parameters. These AEs were considered mild and not 
related to study drug. 
Part B 
Overall there were no clinically meaningful trends in coagulation results and no subjects had AEs 
related to coagulation in Part B. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
Overall, the vitamin Levels, lipid panels, serum chemistry data were consistent with the expected 
outcomes in paediatric patients with CF, who are known to have background LFT abnormalities.  
Haematology showed unexpected AEs; 2 subjects had 2 AEs of neutrophil count decreased and white 
blood cell count decreased. One subject’s AEs were considered possibly related to study drug.  
Overall, no conclusions can be drawn based on 1 patient.  
Vital Signs 
Part A 
No subject had an AE related to vital signs. No clinically meaningful trend in vital signs was observed.  
Part B 
No clinically meaningful trends in vital signs were identified in Part B. No subject had an SAE related to 
vital signs. 
No subject had an AE related to increased BP, 1 subject (1.4%) had an AE of syncope, 1 subject 
(1.4%) had an AE of poor weight gain, and 13 subjects (18.6%) had an AE of pyrexia . The AE of 
syncope was moderate in severity, non-serious, not related to study drug, and resolved without 
treatment or study drug discontinuation or interruption. The AE of poor weight increased was mild in 
severity, non-serious, considered unlikely related, did not require study drug discontinuation or 
interruption, and was not resolved at the end of the study. All AEs of pyrexia were mild or moderate in 
severity, none were considered serious, all were considered not related or unlikely related, none led to 
study drug interruption or discontinuation, and all resolved (7 of them requiring treatment). 
Electrocardiograms 
Part A 
No subjects had QTcF >450 msec, or a maximum QTcF change >60 msec. Overall, no clinically 
meaningful trend in ECG results was observed during Part A. There was no AE related to ECG findings. 
Part B 
No male subjects had QTcF >450 msec and no female subjects had QTcF >470 msec. No subject had a 
maximum QTcF change >60 msec. No clinically meaningful trends in ECGs were observed and there 
were no AEs associated with ECG findings in Part B.

Overall, no clinically meaningful trends were identified from pulse oximetry results. No subjects had 
AEs related to pulse oximetry in Part B.  
Rapporteurs’ comments 
No specific finding were observed in pulse oximetry. 
Ophthalmological Examinations (Part B only) 
Subjects had ophthalmologic examinations at baseline (Screening) and Week 24. Overall, no clinically 
meaningful trends attributable to TEZ/IVA were identified from ophthalmological exams. 
At Screening, 5 subjects had cataracts or lens opacities, which were all considered not clinically 
significant. Of these 5 subjects, 4 subjects had ophthalmological exams at Week 24. Among these 4 
subjects, 1 subject continued to have cataracts at Week 24. 
At Week 24, 2 subjects had lens opacities that were not present at Screening. These lens opacities 
occurred in 2 subjects with prior steroid use and were not deemed to be cataracts or clinically 
significant. Overall, no new cataracts were detected at Week 24 that were not present at Screening. 
For 1 of the 2 subjects with lens opacities that were present at Week 24 but not at Screening, the 
ophthalmological exam findings were reported as an AE of slit lamp test abnormal. This AE was mild, 
not serious, and occurred in a subject with a family history of. There was no other AE relevant to 
ophthalmological exam findings. 
Rapporteurs’ comments 
No specific finding were observed in ophthalmological examinations . 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In the EU, Symkevi is approved as a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients 
with CF 12 years of age and older who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation or who are 
heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and have 1 of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: 
P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 
2789+5G→A, 3272-26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study VX16-661-113 is a phase 3, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and 
tolerability of Symkevi in combination with ivacaftor in patients 6 through 11 years of age with cystic 
fibrosis, homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. 
Study 113 is a, 2-part (Part A and Part B), open-label, multicenter study. A new lower dose strength of 
the TEZ/IVA tablet has been introduced for lighter weigh patients to achieve target exposures.   
Part A included a Screening Period (28 days), Treatment Period (14 days) and a Wash-out/Safety 
Follow-up Period (14 days) to evaluate off-drug response.  
Part B included a Screening Period (28 days), Treatment Period (24 weeks [± 5 days]), and Safety 
Follow-up Visit (4 weeks [± 7 days]). A Safety Follow-up Visit was scheduled to occur 4 weeks (± 7 
days) after the last dose of study drug.  
The dosing differs between Part A and Part B. For ivacaftor component, the dosing is 75 mg q12 h and 
150 mg q12h in both parts, but the cut-off in weight is different i.e. 25 kg in Part A and 40 kg in Part 
B. For tezacaftor compound the dosing is 50 mg qd in part A, while there is a cut-off in weight of 40 kg 
with either 50 or 100 mg qd in Part B.

The inclusion criteria were acceptable and generally in line with the Symkevi authorisation trials.  The 
inclusion criteria were identical for Part A and part B with the exception of the allowed mutations.  In 
part A, all different classes and therefore different severities of CF mutations were allowed to be 
included (mutation with residual function, the mutation with a gating defect that has been clinically 
demonstrated to be IVA-responsive or the mutation was not likely to respond to TEZ and/or IVA 
therapy). Overall, this is not expected to impact PK. 
In Part B, F508del homozygous subjects were eligible as well as F508del heterozygous subjects if 
clinical efficacy of TEZ/IVA had been demonstrated in a corresponding adult population. Furthermore, 
subjects had a percent predicted ppFEV1 ≥40 percentage points. These criteria are quite similar 
compared to the registration trials Study VX14-661-106 (F508del homozygous subjects) and  Study 
VX14-661-108 (F508del heterozygous subjects). The main difference concerns the included mutation 
of F508del heterozygous subjects as more mutations were allowed than registered for Symkevi. 
Furthermore, in this study patients with documented evidence of chronic gastrointestinal disease 
consistent with a diagnosis of CF were allowed if the sweat chloride value was <60 mmol/L. Overall, 
this difference is not expected to impact PK or safety. However, for efficacy a difference in results 
cannot be excluded. Therefore, the efficacy results should be interpreted with caution. 
Important exclusion criterion concerned existing abnormal liver function.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments consisted from measuring plasma PK parameters of TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-
TEZ, IVA, M1-IVA, and M6-IVA.  
For efficacy evaluation, spirometry, weight and weight z-score, height and height z-score, BMI and BMI 
z-score, sweat chloride, and CFQ-R were assessed. These are all relevant parameters.  
Safety parameters were the usual measurements.  
Statistics were adequate, but only descriptive for efficacy parameters.  
Demographics and patient characteristics  
In part A, the majority (92.3%) of subjects were white and all subjects were not Hispanic or Latino. A 
total of 46.2% of subjects were male. The median age was 8 years (range: 6 to 11 years).  
The mean (SD) weight was 30.5 (8.49) kg, the mean (SD) height 132.5 (12.00) cm and the mean 
(SD) BMI was 17.09 (2.44) kg/m2. Mean ppFEV1 was 89.1 (14.76) percent.  
In Part B, the vast majority of the patients (87.1%) were homozygous for the F508del mutation.   
Most subjects (88.6%) weighed <40 kg at baseline. The mean (SD) weight at baseline was 30.7 (10.0) 
kg, and the mean weight z-score was 0.20 (0.94), indicating that baseline weights were above average 
for subjects’ age and sex. Furthermore, the median (range) was 0.05 (-1.52, 2.58), indicating the 
distribution was somewhat skewed and that some children were obese (z-score > +2).  
The mean baseline BMI z-score was 0.37 (0.90) and mean (SD) baseline height z-score was -0.07 
(0.98). Mean baseline ppFEV1 was 91.1% indication FEV1 was still well preserved, but the range 
(63.4-188.0%) indicated that subjects could already have impaired FEV1. Because there are 
differences between homozygous and heterozygous patients, demographics and baseline 
characteristics for both populations separately were requested. Overall, the baseline data provided in 
relation to the anthropmetreic parameters showed the highest severity of the disease in homozygous 
F508del subjects as expected even at this young age. This is particularly the case for weight-for-age 
and height-for-age z-scores and percentiles. Differences were also seen in sweat chloride. Mean sweat 
chloride was higher in children homozygous for F508 CFTR. This difference in sweat chloride is 
considered a characteristic of the difference in disease genotype.

A total of 13 patients were enrolled in Part A and 70 patients in in Part B. In Part A, PK data are not 
available for all patients. However, though TEZ-related PK data are described for 13 patients at D1 
(TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ), at Day 14 data are only available for 12 patients. In case of IVA and 
metabolites the numbers are 10 (at Day 1) or 12 (at Day 14) (See Tables 13 and 14). The MAH 
clarified why TEZ and IVA PK data is not available for all patients, i.e., because patients received IVA 
monotherapy just prior to day 1, and the fact that no samples could be obtained in one patient at day 
14.PK assessment of TEZ/IVA in Part A was conducted in a small number of subjects (N = 13) to 
evaluate TEZ/IVA regimens and determine the TEZ/IVA dose for Part B. In part A, patients <25 kg 
were dosed with TEZ 50 mg QD/IVA 75 mg q12h, and patients ≥ 25 kg TEZ 50 mg QD/IVA 150 mg 
q12h. 
For Part B, the body weight cut-off for dosing was shifted from 25 kg to 40 kg, because modelling and 
simulations predicted the potential for higher TEZ exposures in subjects receiving 100 mg qd dose of 
TEZ. Based on the TEZ exposures in adult subjects, the TEZ dose for subjects weighing ≥ 40 kg in Part 
B was increased to the adult dose of 100 mg qd to be comparable to the exposures in adult subjects. 
Thus, paediatric patients 6-11 years <40 kg were dosed with TEZ 50 mg QD/IVA 75 mg q12h, and 
patients ≥40 kg TEZ 100 mg QD/IVA 150 mg q12h. In Part B, 62 subjects weighing <40 kg and 7 
subjects weighing ≥40 kg were included in PK analyses.  
Although details on the applied modelling and simulations were not provided, the actual PK outcome of 
part B appears to conform that exposure to TEZ and IVA in paediatric patients 6-11 years <40 kg and 
≥40 kg is within the range of exposures obtained in older patients, though mean exposure to TEZ and 
IVA appear at the lower end of the exposure ranges observed in older patients. See table below for a 
rough comparison of the exposure data in patients 6-11 years of age (Cohort B Study 113) and older 
patients (EPAR):

In this respect, it is noted that for IVA given as single agent, the dose of IVA for children aged 6 years 
and older and weighing 25 kg or more is 150 mg BID while those below 25 kg are dosed with 75 mg 
BID. Therefore, patients weighing 25 to 40 kg in Study 113 Cohort B treated with TEZ/IVA received a 
lower IVA dose (75 mg BID) than when given as single agent (150 mg BID). Further PK comparison 
data, i.e., a direct comparison of exposures between children, adolescents, and adults at the proposed 
doses for both TEZ and IVA based on pop-PK modeling and simulation were provided. The popPK data 
support the view that exposure to TEZ, TEZ-M1, and IVA in children 6-12 years <40 kg are within the 
range of exposures obtained in adolescent and adult patients receiving Symkevi, to a reasonable 
extent. It is further acknowledged that dose-selection for Kalydeco and Symkevi were independently 
conducted. Moreover, the use of a single weight cut-off both for the TEZ and IVA component of 
Symkevi is considered beneficial with regard to usability/simplicity of the dose regimen. However,

further discussion of the posology at the time of submission of the type II variation, including all 
available data at that time, is awaited. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The LS mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through Week 24 was 0.9 percentage points 
(95% CI: -0.6, 2.3; nominal P value: 0.2361), was lower compared to the MAA in adults and 
adolescents with homozygous F508del mutation (3.4, 95% CI: 2.7, 4.0). The less impaired lung 
function in this younger population may be of influence for this difference. Alternatively, the lower IVA 
dose may also have been of influence although the PK results showed similar exposure as in adults.  
Furthermore, the population was mixed consisting of homozygous F508del mutation patients and 
heterozygous F508del mutation patients. Patients heterozygous for F508del mutation + residual 
function mutation are less severely affected than homozygous F508del mutation patients. As the vast 
majority of patients  was homozygous for the F508del mutation (87.1%), the results are driven by this 
group. Despite the acknowledgment of the limitations of the subanalyses because of the small group of 
children with heterozygous F/RF and efficacy was a secondary parameter, a subanalysis was requested 
because disease progression is different in the two population. Moreover, the results of Symkevi in the 
adults and adolescents population were also different for the two populations.  In study 113, the mean 
(SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was 0.9 (6.7) percentage points for 
F/F subjects, and the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was 0.9 
(5.1) percentage points for F/RF subjects.  
In addition, subanalyses are requested for the homozygous patients by gender because differences in 
disease progress. It is expected that more results will soon become available through Study VX16-661-
115 with the submission of the variation for a line extension in children aged 6 through 11 years. At 
that time the results will be assessed together. The range of BMI Z-scores at baseline indicated that 
some children are below 0 while other are obese. The EU consensus guidelines for nutrition in patients 
with cystic fibrosis (Turck D. et al. 2016) state that the target for children 2 to 18 years is 0 SD (50th 
percentile) of BMI for a healthy, same-age population. Given that TEZ/IVA is a systemic therapy, it has 
the potential to improve extrapulmonary manifestations of CF, including gastrointestinal symptoms. 
During treatment Weight z-score, Height z-score and BMI z-score remained stable, without 
improvement. An extra pulmonary effect in weight, height of BMI is therefore not established. The MAH 
was requested to provide the percentage of homozygous F508del patients with a BMI at baseline below 
0 who at week 24 reached a BMI Z-score ≥0 together with the corresponding change in height Z-score 
as stunted children can have a normal BMI. No responder analysis was performed for these endpoints 
despite a request by the CHMP. As the vast majority of the population were patients with F/F mutation, 
the results can be considered as indicative for this population. Overall, the (lack of) effect in 
anthopometric parameters is similar to that observed in the pivotal study 106 (adult and adolescents 
homozygous F508del subjects) although children are expected to have a more preserved nutritional 
status than older patients.  
If Faecal elastase-1 levels have not been collected. This would have been of interest as an increase of 
FE-1 values (above 100 or 200 µg/g) in combination with a decrease in serum immune reactive 
trypsinogen (IRT) would be indicative of a decrease in the stress that exocrine pancreatic cells undergo 
under disease circumstances.  
When using the predefined MMRM analysis, the LS mean absolute change from baseline through week 
24 in CFQ-R respiratory domain score was 3.4 points (95% CI: 1.4, 5.5; nominal P value = 0.0013). 
This was below the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points. When using a post-hoc 
analysis, the LS mean absolute change from baseline at Week 24 was above MCID of 4 points, 
indicating symptomatic improvement. This ad-hoc analysis may be motived by the course of the 
scores. The MAH did not  provide an analysis of the percentage of patients homozygous for F508del

who reached a change from baseline through week 24 ≥ 4 points. In the current view of the MAH there 
is no consensus MCID for the Child Version of the questionnaire. This view is inconsistent with previous 
claims. Consistency is expected across procedures unless the scientific evidence leads to a change of 
opinion.  
Lung clearance index was included as an exploratory endpoint in this study. Lung clearance index is 
considered an acceptable alternative for traditional PFT using FEV1. Lung clearance index is capable to 
detect abnormalities in mild and moderate stages of disease early and reflect changes in disease 
severity directly.  However, there is a limited experience of this as an outcome measure, and an 
established the clinically relevant magnitude of benefit is not established yet. In this exploratory 
substudy, no benefit could be established as LS mean (95% CI) absolute change from baseline in 
LCI2.5 through Week 24 increased (0.09 (-0.32, 0.49)) reflecting worsening.  
Sweat chloride is a biomarker of CFTR function; improvements in CFTR function result in reduced 
sweat chloride. In this study, reductions in sweat chloride concentration were observed during the 
treatment period. The LS mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 4 was -
13.0 mmol/L (95% CI: -16.2, -9.9). The LS mean absolute change from baseline through Week 24 was 
-14.5 mmol/L (95% CI: -17.4, -11.6; nominal P value <0.0001). 
Discussion on Safety  
In Part A, 13 subjects received at least one dose of study drug. The mean exposure duration was 14.2 
days (range: 14 to 15 days). In Part B, 70 subjects received at least one dose of study drug in Part B. 
The mean exposure was 23.6 weeks. A total of 69 (98.6%) subjects received >16 weeks of treatment.  
In Part A, 12 subjects (92.3%) had AEs during the treatment-emergent period. There were no deaths, 
serious, severe or life-threatening AEs. All AEs were either mild (9 subjects [69.2%]) or moderate (3 
subjects [23.1%]) in severity.  
The most common AEs included cough (23.1%), headache (23.1%), and nasal congestion (15.4%), 
while in Part B the most common AEs included cough (35.7%), infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF 
(22.9%), pyrexia (18.6%), nasal congestion (14.3%), abdominal pain (14.3%), rhinorrhea (10.0%), 
and vomiting (10.0%) consistent with paediatric population with CF. Overall, the type of AEs are 
similar to the adult and adolescent population.  
Most subjects had AEs that were not related (5 subjects [38.5%]) or unlikely related (3 subjects 
[23.1%]) to study drug. The most common related or possibly related AE (occurring in >1 subject) 
was cough, which occurred in 2 subjects (15.4%). 
No subject had an AE that led to study drug interruption or discontinuation. 
In Part B, In the total group, overall, distribution of AEs is within normal expectation; 3 patients with 
severe events, no life- threatening events and no deaths, 6 patients with SAE of which no related. For 
more detailed assessments see below. No major differences were seen between subjects <40 kg 
versus ≥40 kg. Only, more AEs were severe Grade ¾ were seen in subjects <40 kg. However, the 
number of patients in  ≥40 kg group is too low to draw conclusions. 
In the total group, 65 (92.9%) subjects had at least 1 AE in Part B. Overall, the majority of subjects 
had AEs that were either mild (48.6%) or moderate (40.0%) in severity.   
A total of 19 (27.1%) subjects had an AE considered to be related or possibly related to study drug. 
The most common related AEs by PT (occurring in >1 subject) were ALT increased (4.3%), infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of CF (4.3%), nausea (2.9%), cough (2.9%), productive cough (2.9%), and 
rhinorrhea (2.9%), and blood ALP increased (2.9%). 
A total of 6 (8.6%) subjects had SAEs, but none of the SAEs were considered to be related to study 
drug. Only infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (2 [2.9%] subjects) occurred in >1 subject.

In total, 4 subjects had AEs that led to treatment interruption. Among the subjects with AEs that led to 
treatment interruption. Two subjects had AEs that were considered related or possibly related to study 
drug (1 subject with an AE of blood creatine phosphokinase increased and 1 subject with AEs liver 
enzymes increased). All resolved without any treatment.  
No deaths and no life-threatening AEs occurred in Part B. 
The incidence of ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN was 10.0%, 4.3%, and 1.4%, respectively. In the 
adult and adolescent population, during the placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies the incidence of 
maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 x ULN were in Symkevi in combination with 
ivacaftor 0.2%, 1.0%, and 3.4%. The increases in LFT are in children somewhat higher compared to 
the outcomes in the adult and adolescent population. This was also observed in ivacaftor and 
lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination, and are also observed in the published literature that indicates 
transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than in adults. 
General 
The Company indicated plans to submit a line extension to extend the indications of Symkevi and 
Kalydeco to children aged 6 through 11 years in the second half of 2019. Therefore, a proposal for an 
updated SmPC is not necessary at the moment. The SmPC can be updated when all data are available.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In Study 113 Part B, 69 paediatric patients aged 6-11 years and <40 kg were dosed with TEZ 50 mg 
QD/IVA 75 mg q12h, while patients ≥40 kg were dosed TEZ 100 mg QD/IVA 150 mg q12h. Applying 
this posology, TEZ and IVA exposures in subjects 6-11 years of age weighing <40 kg or ≥40 kg were 
comparable, and were within the range of exposures in subjects 12 years of age and older obtained 
with the adult dosing regimen of TEZ 100 mg QD/IVA 150 mg q12h. Although mean exposure to TEZ 
and IVA in subjects 6-11 years appears to be at the lower end of the exposure ranges observed in 
older patients, further PK comparison data, i.e., a direct comparison of exposures between children, 
adolescents, and adults at the proposed doses for both TEZ and IVA based on pop-PK modelling and 
simulation support the view that exposure to TEZ, TEZ-M1 and IVA in children 6-12 years <40 kg are 
within the range of exposures obtained in adolescent and adult patients with Symkevi to a reasonable 
extent. It is further acknowledged that dose-selection for Kalydeco and Symkevi were independently 
conducted. Moreover, the use of a single weight cut-off both for the TEZ and IVA component of 
Symkevi is considered beneficial with regard to usability/simplicity of the dose regimen. However, 
further discussion of the posology in patients aged 6-11 years is awaited at the time of submission of 
the type II variation, including all available data at that time.  
Common AEs were mostly expected manifestations of underlying CF disease. The incidence of 
treatment discontinuation due to AEs was low. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and were 
considered not related to study drug. 
Treatment with TEZ/IVA resulted in improvements in sweat chloride concentration that sustained for 
24 weeks of treatment. Treatment with TEZ/IVA also improved CFQ-R respiratory domain scores from 
baseline. Lung function (ppFEV1 and LCI) and growth parameters (weight, height, and BMI z-scores) 
remained stable over 24 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA. There are only results of FEV1 presented 
for the subpopulation. As the vast majority of the population were patients with F/F mutation, the 
results can be considered as indicative for this population.

  Fulfilled: 
Vertex plans to submit a Line Extension grouped with a Type II variation to extend the indications of 
Symkevi and Kalydeco to children aged 6 through 11 years. The submission is planned for the second 
half of 2019.  
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  A total of 13 patients were enrolled in Part A of Study 113. However, though TEZ-related PK 
data are described for 13 patients at Day 1 (TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ), at Day 14 data are only 
available for 12 patients. The number of patients analysed for PK of IVA and metabolites is 10 
(at Day 1) or 12 (at Day 14). The Applicant should clarify why TEZ and IVA PK data is not 
available for all subjects and clarify at which dose these excluded subjects were treated (TEZ 
50 mg QD/IVA 75 mg q12h or TEZ 50 mg QD/IVA 150 mg). 
2.  Applying the TEZ 50 mg QD/IVA 75 mg q12h and TEZ 100 mg QD/IVA 150 mg q12h posology 
in patients 6-11 years <40 and > 40 kg, respectively, TEZ and IVA exposures in subjects 6-11 
years of age weighing <40 kg or ≥40 kg were within the range of exposures in subjects 12 
years of age and older obtained with the recommended dosing regimen. However, mean 
exposure to TEZ and IVA in patients 6-11 years appear at the lower end of the exposure 
ranges as observed in older patients. Therefore, further comparative PK data should be 
provided, i.e., a direct comparison of exposures between children, adolescents, and adults at 
the proposed doses for both TEZ and IVA based on pop-PK modelling and simulation. Based on 
this direct comparison, the optimal dose should be discussed further. In this respect, the lower 
IVA dose applied in combination with TEZ (75 mg BID) as compared to the IVA dose given as 
single agent (150 mg BID) in patients 6-11 years weighing between 25 and 40 kg should be 
included in this discussion. 
3.  The MAH is requested to indicate when a variation including data from other studies as well will 
be submitted. If no variation will be submitted, the MAH should include tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
PK data (including information based on the requested popPK and simulation comparison of the 
exposure) in paediatric patients aged 6-11 years from Study 113 in the SmPC.  
4.  As Part A of the study VX16-661-113 is part of paediatric investigation plan, the MAH is 
requested to submit the most recent version of the PIP. 
5.  The patient population was mixed consisting of homozygous F508del mutation patients and 
heterozygous F508del mutation patients. Patients heterozygous for F508del mutation + 
residual function mutation are less severely affected than homozygous F508del mutation 
patients. As the vast majority of patients was homozygous for the F508del mutation (87.1%), 
the results are driven by this group. The MAH is requested to provide the demographics and 
baseline characteristics for both populations separately. In addition to the baseline 
characteristics, faecal elastase-1 levels should be provided as well. For both Part A and Part B, 
anthropometric measures should be provided as Z-scores and percentiles.  
6.  For completeness, the MAH is requested to provide the results for both homozygous F508del 
mutation patients and heterozygous F508del mutation patients separately, including the 
mutation of the heterozygous patients.

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/411016/2019  
Page 67/88 
 
 
 
 
 
7.  The MAH is requested to present the percentage of homozygous F508del patients with a BMI at 
baseline below 0 who at week 24 reached a BMI Z-score ≥0 with the corresponding change in 
height Z-score.  
8.  If collected, the MAH is requested to provide the change from baseline at week 24 for 
homozygous F508del patients who have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (based on FE-1 levels 
< 100 µg/g stool) as well as the percentage of patients who at week 24 achieved a level ≥ 200 
µg/g.  
9.  The MAH is requested to present  the percentage of patients homozygous for F508del who 
reached a change from baseline through week 24 in the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R ≥ 4 
should be presented. 
10. The primary objective of Part B is to investigate the safety and tolerability. In this part, the 
dosing was for subjects ≥ 40 kg identical to the dosing in adults in adolescents. For children 
with a weight < 40 kg at baseline the dosing was adapted. Although most subjects (88.6%) 
weighed <40 kg at baseline, it is considered of interest to have the results for the two groups 
separately provided. This request concerns the overview of adverse events, subjects with any 
and with related AEs, subjects with SAE, and subjects with AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation/interruption. 
11. The incidence of ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN was 10.0%, 4.3%, and 1.4%, respectively. 
The increases in LFT are in children somewhat higher compared to the outcomes in the adult 
and adolescent population. Especially the group >5 and ≤ 8 ULN and the group   >8 × ULN are 
of interest and needs further detailed (e.g. values) discussion.  
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Pharmacokinetics 
1.  A total of 13 patients were enrolled in Part A of Study 113. However, though TEZ-
related PK data are described for 13 patients at Day 1 (TEZ, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ), at Day 
14 data are only available for 12 patients. The number of patients analysed for PK of 
IVA and metabolites is 10 (at Day 1) or 12 (at Day 14). The Applicant should clarify 
why TEZ and IVA PK data is not available for all subjects and clarify at which dose 
these excluded subjects were treated (TEZ 50 mg QD/IVA 75 mg q12h or TEZ 50 mg 
QD/IVA 150 mg). 
Company’s response 
In Study 113 Part A, pharmacokinetic (PK) data were missing for the following reasons: 
Day 1: Ivacaftor (IVA) PK data from 3 subjects were excluded from analysis because these subjects 
received IVA monotherapy before the first dose of tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA). 
Day 14: One subject had difficulties with venipuncture; therefore, blood collections were not collected 
for TEZ and IVA PK analyses. 
Table 1 summarizes the number of subjects with missing PK results in each cohort in Study 113 Part A, 
including the doses of TEZ and IVA each of these subjects received. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/411016/2019  
Page 68/88 
 
 
 
 
 
Assessment of the response: 
The Applicants response is acceptable. IVA was not measured in 3 patients at day 1 (single dose day) 
since they received IVA monotherapy before this day, and for one patient at day 14 no samples could 
be taken, and therefore no analysis for TEZ and IVA was possible. 
Issue resolved 
2.  Applying the TEZ 50 mg QD/IVA 75 mg q12h and TEZ 100 mg QD/IVA 150 mg q12h 
posology in patients 6-11 years <40 and > 40 kg, respectively, TEZ and IVA 
exposures in subjects 6-11 years of age weighing <40 kg or ≥40 kg were within the 
range of exposures in subjects 12 years of age and older obtained with the 
recommended dosing regimen. However, mean exposure to TEZ and IVA in patients 
6-11 years appear at the lower end of the exposure ranges as observed in older 
patients. Therefore, further comparative PK data should be provided, i.e., a direct 
comparison of exposures between children, adolescents, and adults at the proposed 
doses for both TEZ and IVA based on pop-PK modelling and simulation. Based on this 
direct comparison, the optimal dose should be discussed further. In this respect, the 
lower IVA dose applied in combination with TEZ (75 mg BID) as compared to the IVA 
dose given as single agent (150 mg BID) in patients 6-11 years weighing between 25 
and 40 kg should be included in this discussion. 
Company’s response 
Comparison of TEZ and IVA Exposures in Children, Adolescents, and Adults 
To evaluate the dosing regimen in Study 113 Part B, data from this study was used to update 
population PK models for TEZ, M1-TEZ, and IVA. M1-TEZ is an active metabolite of TEZ that has similar 
pharmacologic activity to TEZ. 
Population PK modelling results from the updated models are presented for children (6 through 11 
years of age), adolescents (12 through 17 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) in 
Table 2 (exposures at steady-state by age group), Figure 1 through Figure 3 (boxplots of steady-state 
exposures by age group), and Figure 4 (exposures at steady-state versus weight). Area under the 
concentration versus time curve at steady state (AUCss) was assessed as AUC0-24h for TEZ and M1-
TEZ and as AUC0-12h for IVA. 
Overall, the population PK models indicate that individual exposures for all 3 analytes in Study 113 
were within the ranges observed for subjects 12 years of age and older.

TEZ/IVA Versus IVA Monotherapy Dose and Optimal TEZ/IVA Dose 
Dose selections and weight cut-offs are optimized independently for the Kalydeco™ (IVA monotherapy) 
and Symkevi™ (TEZ/IVA) programs. For the Kalydeco program, doses were selected based on data 
derived from the population PK modeling of IVA only, whereas both TEZ and IVA were evaluated for 
the Symkevi program. 
In Study 113 Part B, a different weight cut-off (40 kg) was selected for the lower dose of TEZ/IVA 
treatment (TEZ 50 mg once daily [qd]/IVA 75 mg every 12 hours [q12h]) compared to the weight cut-
off (25 kg) that is approved to treat children 6 years of age and older with the 75-mg dose of 
Kalydeco. The 40-kg weight cut-off was chosen for evaluation in Study 113 for the following reasons: 
• 
• 
Population PK modeling predicted that a 40-kg weight cut-off for dosing with TEZ/IVA in 6- 
through 11-year-old subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) would yield exposures of TEZ and IVA 
that would be within the adult ranges. 
IVA has a wide therapeutic window. Predicted exposures of IVA were expected to fall within the 
well-characterized, wide therapeutic window. 
•  Using the same weight cut-off for both TEZ and IVA simplifies the dose regimen. 
As described in response to Question 3, Vertex plans to submit a Line Extension grouped with a Type II 
variation to extend the indications of Symkevi and Kalydeco to children 6 to 11 years of age. Additional 
discussion of the proposed commercial doses of TEZ and IVA will be provided in this submission.

The provided discussion and data is appreciated. It is acknowledged that dose-selection for Kalydeco 
and Symkevi were independently conducted. Further, the use of a single weight cut-off both for the 
TEZ and IVA component of Symkevi is considered beneficial with regard to usability/simplicity of the 
dose regimen. Finally, the popPK data provided, support the view that exposure to TEZ, TEZ-M1, and 
IVA in children 6-12 years <40 kg are within the range of exposures obtained with Symkevi in 
adolescent and adult patients to a reasonable extent. 
Further discussion at the time of submission of the type II variation (See OC3), including all available 
data at that time, is awaited. 
Issue resolved. 
Regulatory 
3.  The MAH is requested to indicate when a variation including data from other studies 
as well will be submitted. If no variation will be submitted, the MAH should include 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor PK data (including information based on the requested 
popPK and simulation comparison of the exposure) in paediatric patients aged 6-11 
years from Study 113 in the SmPC.  
Company’s response 
Vertex plans to submit a Line Extension grouped with a Type II variation to extend the indications of 
Symkevi and Kalydeco to children aged 6 through 11 years. The submission is planned for the second 
half of 2019. 
Assessment of the response 
Because the Company plans to submit a line extension to extend the indications of Symkevi and 
Kalydeco to children aged 6 through 11 years in the second half of 2019, a proposal for an updated 
SmPC is not necessary at the moment. The SmPC can be updated when all data are available. 
Issue resolved. 
Clinical  
4.  As Part A of the study VX16-661-113 is part of paediatric investigation plan, the MAH 
is requested to submit the most recent version of the PIP. 
Company’s response 
The most recent PIP Decision is provided in Module 1.10. 
Assessment of the response 
The applicant submitted the most recent version of the PIP, EMEA-001640-PIP01-14-M05. According to 
the PIP, Part A of the study VX16-661-113 is part of paediatric investigation plan, study 11  (EMEA-
001640-PIP01-14-M05). Clinical efficacy and safety will be studied in Study 12 (Study C, part B; VX16-
661-115). It is assumed that study VX16-661-115 will be submitted with the variation.  
5.  The patient population was mixed consisting of homozygous F508del mutation 
patients and heterozygous F508del mutation patients. Patients heterozygous for

F508del mutation + residual function mutation are less severely affected than 
homozygous F508del mutation patients. As the vast majority of patients was 
homozygous for the F508del mutation (87.1%), the results are driven by this group. 
The MAH is requested to provide the demographics and baseline characteristics for 
both populations separately. In addition to the baseline characteristics, faecal 
elastase-1 levels should be provided as well. For both Part A and Part B, 
anthropometric measures should be provided as Z-scores and percentiles.  
Company’s response 
Subject demographics in Study 113 Part B are presented by CFTR mutation type (homozygous for 
F508del [F/F] versus heterozygous for F508del and a second allele that results in residual function 
[F/RF]) in Table 3. Baseline characteristics in Part B (including anthropometric z-scores and 
percentiles) are presented by mutation type in Table 4. Study 113 Part A baseline anthropometric 
measures (including z-scores and percentiles) are presented by mutation type in Table 5. 
Fecal elastase-1 assessments were not performed in Study 113; therefore, these data are not 
available.

In part B, out of the 70 patients, 61 children were homozygous for F508del mutation. The remaining 9 
children were heterozygous for F508del mutation and a residual function mutation.  
Overall, the two populations were comparable in baseline demographics and baseline characteristics 
with some exceptions. The baseline data provided show the highest severity of the disease in 
homozygous F508del subjects as expected even at this young age. Homozygopus F508del subjects had 
a median (min, max)  weight-for-age percentile of 51.46 (6.43, 99.50) as compared to heterozygous 
patients (i.e., 74.11 [11.83, 95.71). Similarly, median (min, max) height-for-age percentile is 39.42 
(2.50, 99.10) as compared to 51.33 (21.03, 93.70). This results in median (min, max)  BMI percentile 
of 69.05 (7.47, 98.43) vs. 70.77 (16.41, 94.55) in heterozygous patients. In subjects with cystic 
fibrosis aged 2 to 18 years the target is 0 SD (50th percentile) of BMI for a healthy, same-age 
population. This is considered as indicative of adequate nutritional status. However, when assessing 
BMI the change in height percentile/SD score should be considered, as stunted (low height-for-age) 
children can have a normal BMI (Turck et al 2016). This seems to be the case in the population of 
homozygous F508del children for whom the height percentile is well below the 50th percentile in spite 
of which the BMI percentile is above 50. The difference in sweat chloride is a characteristic of the 
difference in disease genotype. 
In part A, the groups are small i.e. 5 children with homozygous F/F mutations and 4 children with 
heterozygous F/RF. Overall Children with homozygous F/F mutations were heavier and children with 
heterozygous F/RF were taller resulting in a higher BMI in children with homozygous F/F mutations.  
Conclusion: The applicant provided the requested tables. Issue solved.  
6.  For completeness, the MAH is requested to provide the results for both homozygous 
F508del mutation patients and heterozygous F508del mutation patients separately, 
including the mutation of the heterozygous patients.  
Company’s response 
Study 113 had primary objectives of PK (Part A) and safety and tolerability (Part B).  
With the exception of spirometry endpoints, efficacy endpoints were not analysed separately for F/F 
and F/RF subjects because: 
1. Efficacy was a secondary objective of the study (Part B only). 
2. This study was not powered for subgroup analysis of efficacy endpoints in F/F and F/RF subjects. 
3. Given the small sample size for the F/RF group (N = 9), statistically robust conclusions cannot be 
drawn from a subgroup analysis of subjects with F/RF genotypes. 
Descriptive summary statistics for change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(ppFEV1; secondary endpoint, Part B only) were provided separately for F/F and F/RF subjects in Study 
113 CSR/Table 14.2.1.1.1b.  
F/F and F/RF subjects had similar absolute increases from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24. For 
F/F subjects, the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was 0.9 (6.7) 
percentage points. For F/RF subjects, the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through 
Week 24 was 0.9 (5.1) percentage points. These data are consistent with the well-preserved baseline 
lung function values. Given the small number of F/RF subjects, the high baseline ppFEV1 values in 
Study 113, and that similar increases in ppFEV1 were observed in F/F and F/RF subjects, further 
analyses in F/RF and F/F subgroups are not considered to provide further insight.

No subgroup analysis was performed for the individual residual function (RF) mutations, because no RF 
mutation was carried by >2 subjects. The RF mutations enrolled in Study 113 Part B are summarized 
below: 
Assessment of the response 
The applicant provided the subanalysis only for the efficacy parameter percent predicted forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1).  
The applicant did not provide other subanalyses based on the facts that efficacy was a secondary 
objective of Study 113, the study was not powered for subgroup analysis and the vast majority of the 
patients were carrying F/F mutation (refer also to response to question 7).   
The Rapporteurs are well aware of the limitations of the subanalyses and the small group of children 
with heterozygous F/RF and these results are considered with caution. However, because the 
populations are different for disease progression but also for response to Symkevi as been seen in the 
adults and adolescents (refer to initial marketing application), in the view of the rapporteurs, these two 
populations should be distinguished from each other. Thus, the requested analyses should have been 
provided.  
The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 is similar in the two 
populations, i.e. 0.9 (6.7) percentage points in F/F subjects and 0.9 (5.1) percentage in F/RF subjects. 
In the adult/adolescents studies, study VX14-661-106 and study VX14-661-108, absolute change from 
baseline in ppFEV1 through Week 24 was 3.4 and 6.5 in respectively F/F subjects and F/RF subjects. It 
is agreed with the applicant that the well-preserved baseline lung function values may be the reasons 
for the small increase in children.  
The included children with heterozygous F/RF had mutation as allowed in the label for the use in adults 
and adolescents.  
In the assessment report in the comment box and discussion, subanalyses were requested for the 
homozygous patients by gender because differences in disease progress were requested. 
Unfortunately, this was not included in the question.  
At the moment, this issue is rested, because the applicant will submit a variation for a line extension in 
children aged 6 through 11 years. It is expected that more results will be become available through  
Study VX16-661-115. At that time, the results will be assessed together.   
Conclusion: issue is considered resolved within this procedure. 
7.  The MAH is requested to present the percentage of homozygous F508del patients 
with a BMI at baseline below 0 who at week 24 reached a BMI Z-score ≥0 with the 
corresponding change in height Z-score.

Company’s response 
As described in response to Question 6, efficacy was a secondary objective of Study 113. The study 
was not powered for subgroup analysis for efficacy, including subgroups defined by CFTR mutation or 
baseline z-scores above/below 0. 
Overall, body mass index (BMI) and height Z-scores were stable across 24 weeks of TEZ/IVA 
treatment in Part B. No subgroup analysis was performed for these endpoints, given that the overall LS 
mean (SE) absolute change in BMI z-score was -0.03 (0.04) and the overall LS mean (SE) absolute 
change in height z-score was 0.00 (0.02). The F/F subgroup would be expected to have similar results 
to the overall study population, given that 87.1% of the Study 113 population had an F/F genotype. 
Assessment of the response 
The information requested has not been provided. The Rapporteurs are well aware of the limitations of 
the subanalyses (refer to question 6). The requested analyses should have been provided.  
In the pivotal study 106 in subjects homozygous F508del similar results were seen, i.e., the mean 
within-group change in BMI after 24 weeks of treatment with TEZ/IVA was 0.18 kg/m2 which suggests 
that the effect of TEZ/IVA on anthropometric parameters is limited for the homozygous F508del 
population. In study 108 (heterozygous F508del/CFTR mutation of residual function), the mean within-
group change in the TEZ/IVA group after 8 weeks of treatment was 0.34 kg/m2. The baseline data for 
part B provided in response to Question 5 show that based on the anthropometric parameters for each 
population (homo- and heterozygous), the latter have a better preserved nutritional status as 
expected.  
Given that in response to Question 3, the MAH states that a Line Extension grouped with a type II 
variation is planned to extend the indications of Symkevi and Kalydeco to children aged 6 through 11 
years no further questions in this respect are raised. In study 115 anthropometric parameters have 
been analysed and compared vs. placebo even though just for 8 weeks of treatment (according to 
opinion on EMEA-001640-PIP01-14-M05). At that time, the results will be assessed together.   
Conclusion: issue is considered resolved within this procedure. 
8.  If collected, the MAH is requested to provide the change from baseline at week 24 for 
homozygous F508del patients who have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (based on 
FE-1 levels < 100 µg/g stool) as well as the percentage of patients who at week 24 
achieved a level ≥ 200 µg/g.  
Company’s response 
Faecal elastase-1 assessments were not performed in Study 113; therefore, Vertex is not able to 
provide these data. 
Assessment of the response 
As faecal elastase-1 (FE-1) was not collected, data are not available. It is assumed that at the age of 6 
years most homozygous F508del subjects are (exocrine) pancreatic insufficient as the disease is 
usually established very early in life and FE-1 values expected to be below 50 µg/g. It would have been 
of interest to assess whether treatment with TEZ/IVA results in FE-1 increases above the cut-off of 100 
or 200 µg/g. In combination with a decrease in IRT, this would be indicative of a decrease of the stress 
that pancreatic exocrine cells undergo (with increases in FE-1 reflecting some recovery of CFTR

function at the gastrointestinal tract and reduction in IRT levels interpreted as a decreased leakage into 
the bloodstream under disease circumstances).    
Conclusion: Faecal elastase-1 data was not collected. Therefore, no assessment can be made. Issue 
resolved. 
9.  The MAH is requested to present  the percentage of patients homozygous for F508del 
who reached a change from baseline through week 24 in the respiratory domain of 
the CFQ-R ≥ 4 should be presented. 
Company’s response 
The primary objectives of Study 113 were to evaluate TEZ/IVA PK (Part A) and safety and tolerability 
(Part B); efficacy was a secondary objective (Part B only). While the minimal clinically important 
difference (MCID) for the Adult and Adolescent Versions of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire- Revised 
(CFQ-R) respiratory domain score is 4 points, there is no consensus MCID for the Child Version of the 
questionnaire. For these reasons, no analysis of change from baseline in CFQ-R ≥4 points is presented. 
Assessment of the response 
The MAH argues that there is no consensus MCID for the Child Version of the questionnaire. For these 
reasons, no analysis of change from baseline in CFQ-R ≥4 points is presented. However, in previous 
procedures, the MAH accepted the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points and this 
instrument has been used as a primary endpoint for regulatory approval. The difference of ≥4 points 
as the MCID is based on the results of the study performed by Quittner et al (2009) which included 
children aged 6 to less than 13 years old.   
Although the arguments against the subanalysis may be acknowledged, the inconsistency in the 
opinion of the MAH regarding the MCID of 4 points for the CFQ-R in children 6 to less than 12 years old 
would need further justification. At the moment, this issue is rested, because variation will be 
submitted for a line extension in children aged 6 through 11 years. Consistency is expected across 
procedures unless the scientific evidence leads to change of opinion on this issue.  
Conclusion: issue is considered resolved within this procedure. 
10. The primary objective of Part B is to investigate the safety and tolerability. In this 
part, the dosing was for subjects ≥ 40 kg identical to the dosing in adults in 
adolescents. For children with a weight < 40 kg at baseline the dosing was adapted. 
Although most subjects (88.6%) weighed <40 kg at baseline, it is considered of 
interest to have the results for the two groups separately provided. This request 
concerns the overview of adverse events, subjects with any and with related AEs, 
subjects with SAE, and subjects with AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation/interruption.  
Company’s response 
All safety results are presented separately for subjects weighing ≥40 kg (TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg 
q12h) and subjects weighing <40 kg (TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h) in Study 113/CSR/Section 14. 
Table 6 presents an overview of treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) for subjects <40 kg and ≥ 40 
kg. Additional information about AEs in subjects <40 kg and ≥40 kg can be found in Study 
113/CSR/Section 14.3.1.

Although there are no clinically significant differences between subjects <40 kg versus ≥40 kg, results 
in the ≥40 kg group (N = 8) should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of subjects. 
Table 6 Study 113 Part B: Overview of Adverse Events, Safety Set 
Assessment of the response 
The number of patients in  ≥40 kg group is low i.e. N = 8. Therefore, results should be interpreted 
with caution making it difficult to draw conclusions. However, still an  impression, more AEs were 
severe Grade ¾ in subjects <40 kg versus ≥40 kg. These Grade ¾ concern infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, sinusitis, breath odour and snoring. SAEs were absent. 
With the submission of the variation to extend the indications of Symkevi and Kalydeco to children 
aged 6 through 11 years, more studies will be submitted and this issue will be further analysed during 
the variation.   
Conclusion: Issue resolved.  
11. The incidence of ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN was 10.0%, 4.3%, and 1.4%, 
respectively. The increases in LFT are in children somewhat higher compared to the 
outcomes in the adult and adolescent population. Especially the group >5 and ≤ 8

ULN and the group   >8 × ULN are of interest and needs further detailed (e.g. values) 
discussion.  
Company’s response 
The incidence of transaminase elevations observed in Study 113 is consistent with expectations of 
patients with CF in this age group. Published literature indicates that transaminase elevations are more 
common in younger patients with CF than in adults.1 
The results are also consistent with Vertex’s previous paediatric studies of IVA monotherapy and 
lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA therapy. In a 48-week study of IVA monotherapy treatment in 6- to 11-year-old 
subjects, the percent of subjects with alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) 
>3, >5, and >8 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were 19%, 4%, and 0%, respectively, in the placebo 
group and 19%, 4%, and 4%, respectively, in the IVA monotherapy group (Study 770-103 CSR). 
Similarly, in a 24-week study of LUM/IVA treatment in 6- to 11-year-old subjects, placebo-treated 
subjects had a rate of ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN of 8%, 3%, and 2%, respectively.2 Together, 
these results suggest that the rates of liver function test (LFT) elevation observed after TEZ/IVA 
treatment in Study 113 (1) were similar to background levels in patients with CF in this age range and 
(2) were not increased compared to treatment with IVA alone. 
Given the sample size in Study 113 Part B (N = 70), a difference of just 1 subject with a transaminase 
elevation would yield a 1.4% difference in rate, so apparent differences in rates in Study 113 
compared to adult data could be due to the effects of small sample size. 
In Study 113, 3 subjects had ALT or AST >5 × ULN; 1 of these subjects also met the criterion of ALT 
or AST >8 × ULN. A summary of these subjects’ baseline, maximum, and Week 24 Visit ALT and AST 
values is presented in Table 7. More detailed LFT values for these subjects, along with additional 
relevant clinical details, are provided in subject narratives in Study 113 CSR/ Section 14.3.3.3. 
Analysis of transaminase elevations for all 3 subjects with ALT or AST >5 × ULN was confounded by 
high baseline ALT values and/or alternative aetiologies for the elevations. No subject discontinued 
TEZ/IVA due to elevated transaminases. For the 2 subjects with ALT >5 × ULN and <8 × ULN, the 
elevations did not result in study drug interruption. The subject with ALT and AST >8 × ULN was 
treated with antibiotics before the elevations. After this subject interrupted treatment, the subject 
successfully resumed dosing with TEZ/IVA and completed the study.

Assessment of the response 
ALT and AST elevations appeared to be higher than that observed in subjects 12 years of age and 
older but similar tot the frequencies found in ivacaftor and lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination. These 
observations are consistent with information available in the published literature that indicates 
transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients with CF than in adults. At the time of 
the line variation, this issue will be further assessed.

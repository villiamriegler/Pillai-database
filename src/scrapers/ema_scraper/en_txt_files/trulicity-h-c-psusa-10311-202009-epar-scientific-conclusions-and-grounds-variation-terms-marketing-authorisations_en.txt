Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dulaglutide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on pancreatitis and acute pancreatitis from spontaneous reports, the PRAC 
considers that the wording currently included in section 4.8 of the SmPC is not adequate. Such wording 
refers only to pre-authorisation studies, and does not reflect the current knowledge, where acute 
pancreatitis and pancreatitis have been reported also in the post-marketing setting. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing dulaglutide should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dulaglutide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dulaglutide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

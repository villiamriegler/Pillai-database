4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Oxlumo is indicated for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) in all age groups. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the management of 
hyperoxaluria. 
Posology  
Oxlumo is administered by subcutaneous injection. The recommended dose of Oxlumo consists of 
loading doses given once a month for 3 doses, followed by maintenance doses beginning one month 
after the last loading dose, as shown in Table 1. Dosing is based on body weight. 
The patient dose (in mg) and volume (in mL) should be calculated as follows: 
Patient body weight (kg) × dose (mg/kg) = total amount (mg) of medicinal product to be administered. 
Total amount (mg) divided by concentration (189 mg/mL) = total volume of medicinal product (mL) 
to be injected.

Patients on haemodialysis 
Administer Oxlumo following haemodialysis if administered on dialysis days. 
Missed dose 
If a dose is delayed or missed, treatment should be administered as soon as possible. Prescribed 
monthly or quarterly dosing should be resumed from the most recently administered dose. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Oxlumo has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is necessary in 
patients with transient elevation in total bilirubin (total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5×ULN). Caution is 
required when treating patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment (eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73m2) 
including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or those on dialysis. Limited data are available in patients 
with ESRD and on dialysis, and these patients should be treated with caution (see sections 4.4 and 
5.2). 
Paediatric population 
In patients under 1 year of age, limited data are available. Caution should be used when treating these 
patients (see section 5.2). 
Method of administration  
For subcutaneous use only. 
This medicinal product is provided as a ready-to-use solution in a single use vial. 
• 
• 
• 
The required volume of Oxlumo should be calculated based on the recommended weight-based 
dose as shown in Table 1. 
If the dose is more than 0.5 mL (94.5 mg), more than one vial will be needed. 
The maximum acceptable single injection volume is 1.5 mL. Doses requiring more than 1.5 mL 
should be administered as multiple injections (the total dose divided equally between syringes 
with each injection containing approximately the same volume) to minimise potential injection 
site discomfort due to injection volume.

Having the medicinal product on the needle tip before the needle is in the subcutaneous space 
should be avoided. 
This medicinal product should be injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, upper arms, or 
thighs. 
For subsequent injections or doses, rotating the injection site is recommended. 
This medicinal product should not be administered into scar tissue or areas that are reddened, 
inflamed, or swollen. 
Oxlumo should be administered by a healthcare professional. For instructions on the medicinal 
product before administration see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Severe hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Severe or end-stage renal impairment  
Treatment with lumasiran increases plasma glycolate levels, which may increase the risk of metabolic 
acidosis or worsening of pre-existing metabolic acidosis in patients with severe or end-stage renal 
disease. These patients should therefore be monitored for signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis.  
Moderate or severe hepatic impairment  
In patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment there is a potential for decreased efficacy. 
Therefore, efficacy should be monitored in these patients (see section 5.2).  
Excipient (sodium content)  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinical drug interaction studies have been performed (see section 5.2). 
Concomitant use with pyridoxine  
Concomitant use of pyridoxine did not meaningfully influence the pharmacodynamics or 
pharmacokinetics of lumasiran. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation 
Pregnancy  
There are no data from the use of lumasiran in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The use of this 
medicinal product could be considered during pregnancy taking into account the expected health 
benefit for the woman and potential risks to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether lumasiran is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain 
from Oxlumo therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.

Fertility  
There are no data on the effects of lumasiran on human fertility. No impact on male or female fertility 
was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Oxlumo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Injection site reactions 
In placebo-controlled and open-label clinical studies, injection site reactions were reported in 34 out of 
98 patients (34.7%). The most commonly reported symptoms were erythema, swelling, pain, 
haematoma, pruritus, and discolouration. The majority of injection site reactions started on the day of 
administration, with <2% of injection site reactions occurring 5 or more days after administration. 
Injection site reactions were generally mild, resolved within two days, and did not result in 
interruption or discontinuation of treatment. 
Abdominal pain 
In the placebo-controlled study, abdominal pain was reported in 1 of 13 (7.7%) placebo-treated 
patients and 4 of 26 (15.4%) lumasiran-treated patients. In the placebo-controlled and open-label 
clinical studies, 16 of 98 patients (16.3%) reported abdominal pain, including upper or lower 
abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, or abdominal tenderness. Most of the events have been mild, 
transient, and resolved without treatment. None have resulted in discontinuation of treatment. 
Immunogenicity 
In patients with PH1 and healthy volunteers dosed with Oxlumo in clinical studies, 7 of 120 (5.8%) 
individuals tested positive for anti-drug-antibodies (ADA). ADA titres were low and generally 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transient, with no impact on the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic profiles of the 
medicinal product. 
Paediatric population  
The safety profile of lumasiran was similar in paediatric (aged 4 months to 17 years) and adult patients 
with PH1. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored as medically indicated for any 
signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Various alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX18. 
Mechanism of action  
Lumasiran is a double-stranded small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) that reduces levels of 
glycolate oxidase (GO) enzyme by targeting the hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAO1) gene messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in hepatocytes through RNA interference. Decreased GO enzyme levels 
reduce the amount of available glyoxylate, a substrate for oxalate production. This results in reduction 
of urinary and plasma oxalate levels, the underlying cause of disease manifestations in patients with 
PH1. As the GO enzyme is upstream of the deficient alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) 
enzyme that causes PH1, the mechanism of action of lumasiran is independent of the underlying 
AGXT gene mutation. 
Clinical efficacy  
The efficacy of lumasiran was studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study 
in patients 6 years and older with PH1 (ILLUMINATE-A), in a single-arm clinical study in patients 
less than 6 years of age with PH1 (ILLUMINATE-B), and in a single-arm clinical study in paediatric 
and adult patients with PH1 who have advanced renal disease, including patients on haemodialysis 
(ILLUMINATE-C).  
ILLUMINATE-A 
A total of 39 patients with PH1 were randomised 2:1 to receive subcutaneous doses of lumasiran or 
placebo during the 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled period. Patients 6 years and older with 
an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were enrolled and received 
3 loading doses of 3 mg/kg lumasiran or placebo administered once monthly, followed by quarterly 
maintenance doses of 3 mg/kg lumasiran or placebo (see section 4.2). After the 6-month double-blind 
treatment period, patients, including those originally assigned to placebo, entered an extension period 
with administration of lumasiran.

During the 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled period, 26 patients received lumasiran, and 
13 received placebo. The median age of patients at first dose was 14.9 years (range 6.1 to 61.0 years), 
66.7% were male, and 76.9% were white. The median 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion corrected for 
body surface area (BSA) at baseline was 1.72 mmol/24 h/1.73 m2, the median spot urinary 
oxalate: creatinine ratio at baseline was 0.21 mmol/mmol, and the median plasma oxalate level at 
baseline was 13.1 µmol/L. Overall, 33.3% of patients had normal renal function (eGFR 
90 mL/min/1.73 m2), 48.7% had mild renal impairment (eGFR of 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 
18% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR of 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Of the patients enrolled in 
the study, 84.6% reported a history of symptomatic renal stone events and 53.8% reported a history of 
nephrocalcinosis at baseline. The treatment arms were balanced at baseline with respect to age, urinary 
oxalate level, and eGFR. 
The primary endpoint was the percent reduction from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion 
corrected for BSA averaged over months 3 through 6. Lumasiran was associated with a statistically 
significant reduction of 65.4% in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA, as compared to 11.8% in 
the placebo group, representing a difference of 53.5% (95% CI: 44.8, 62.3; p<0.0001). Consistent with 
the primary endpoint, a reduction of 60.5% was observed at month 6 in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine 
ratio in the lumasiran arm compared to an 8.5% increase in the placebo arm. Furthermore, patients 
treated with lumasiran had a rapid and sustained decrease in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for 
BSA, as shown in Figure 1.

corrected for BSA by month 
Abbreviations: BL = baseline; BSA = body surface area; M = month; SEM = standard error of mean. 
Results are plotted as mean (±SEM) of percent change from baseline. 
At month 6, a higher proportion of lumasiran-treated patients achieved normal or near-normal levels 
of 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA (≤1.5×ULN) compared to placebo-treated patients, as 
shown in Table 3.

Þ Analysed in 23 lumasiran and 10 placebo patients who had baseline levels that allowed for reduction to occur. 
Reduction in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected for BSA from baseline in patients with PH1 receiving 
lumasiran compared to placebo was similar across all pre-specified subgroups, including age, sex, 
race, renal impairment, baseline pyridoxine (vitamin B6) use, and history of symptomatic renal stone 
events (Figure 2). 
Figure 2:  ILLUMINATE-A: Percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate corrected 
for BSA, subgroup analysis 
Reduced oxalate levels observed in the double-blind period were maintained with continued lumasiran 
treatment through 24 months during the extension period of study. eGFR and renal stone events 
(reported by events per person-year) were assessed through the 6-month double-blind and extension 
periods for a total of 24 months. eGFR remained stable in patients administered lumasiran.  
The rate of renal stone events per person-year reported in patients treated with lumasiran in 
ILLUMINATE-A are presented in Table 4.

ILLUMINATE-B 
A total of 18 patients were enrolled and treated with lumasiran in an ongoing multi-centre, single-arm 
study in patients with PH1 (ILLUMINATE-B). The study enrolled patients less than 6 years of age 
with an eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients 12 months of age and older, and normal serum 
creatinine in patients less than 12 months of age. In the 6-month primary analysis, at first dose, 
3 patients were less than 10 kg, 12 were 10 kg to less than 20 kg, and 3 were 20 kg and above. The 
median age of patients at first dose was 51.4 months (range 4.0 to 74.0 months), 55.6% were female, 
and 88.9% were white. The median spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio at baseline was 
0.47 mmol/mmol.  
At month 6, patients treated with lumasiran achieved a reduction of 72.0% (95% CI: 66.4, 77.5) in 
spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio from baseline (averaged over months 3 through month 6), the 
primary endpoint. Lumasiran was associated with rapid, and sustained reductions in spot urinary 
oxalate: creatinine ratio (Figure 3), which were similar across all weight strata. The percent reduction 
in urinary oxalate excretion was maintained with continued lumasiran treatment through month 12 and 
consistent with data from ILLUMINATE-A.

Figure 3:  ILLUMINATE-B: Percent change in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio from 
baseline by month 
At month 6, nine of 18 patients achieved near normalisation (≤1.5×ULN), including 1 patient who 
achieved normalisation (≤ULN), in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio. At month 12, ten of 18 
patients achieved near normalization (≤1.5×ULN), including 2 patients who achieved normalization 
(≤ULN), in spot urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio. 
Furthermore, from baseline to month 6 (average of month 3 to month 6), a mean plasma oxalate 
reduction of 31.7% (95% CI: 23.9, 39.5) was observed. Reduced plasma oxalate levels observed in the 
primary analysis period were maintained with continued lumasiran treatment. The eGFR remained 
stable in all patients with continued dosing. 
The rate of renal stone events per person-year reported in the 12-month period prior to consent and 
during the 6-month primary analysis period was 0.24 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.63) and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.06, 
0.96), respectively. The rate of events from month 6 to month 12 was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.84).

ILLUMINATE-C 
A total of 21 patients were enrolled and treated with lumasiran in an on-going multi-centre, single-arm 
study in patients with PH1 and advanced renal disease (eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients 12 
months of age and older and elevated serum creatinine in patients less than 12 months of age), 
including patients on haemodialysis. ILLUMINATE-C includes 2 cohorts: Cohort A consists of 6 
patients who did not require dialysis at the time of study enrolment and Cohort B consists of 15 
patients who were on stable regimen of haemodialysis. Patients received the recommended dosing 
regimen of lumasiran based on body weight (see section 4.2). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The median age of patients at first dose was 8.9 years (range 0 to 59 years), 57.1% were male, and 
76.2% were white. For Cohort A patients, the median plasma oxalate level was 57.94 µmol/L. For 
Cohort B patients, the median plasma oxalate level was 103.65 µmol/L.  
The primary endpoint of the study was the percent change in plasma oxalate from baseline to month 6 
(average from month 3 to month 6) for Cohort A (N=6) and the percent change in pre-dialysis plasma 
oxalate from baseline to month 6 (average from month 3 to month 6) for Cohort B (N=15).  
During the 6-month primary analysis period, patients in both cohorts had a reduction in plasma oxalate 
as early as month 1. The percent change from baseline to month 6 (average from month 3 to month 6) 
in plasma oxalate levels for Cohort A was an LS mean difference of -33.3% (95% CI: -81.82, 15.16) 
and for Cohort B the LS mean difference was -42.4% (95% CI: -50.71, -34.15). 
Figure 4:    ILLUMINATE-C: Percent Change from Baseline in Plasma Oxalate (µmol/L) at 
Each Visit during the Primary Analysis Period 
Results are plotted as mean (±SEM) of percent change from baseline. 
Abbreviations: BL = baseline; M = month; SEM = standard error of mean. 
For Cohort A, the baseline is defined as the mean of all plasma oxalate samples collected prior to the first dose of lumasiran; 
for Cohort B, the baseline is defined as the last four pre-dialysis plasma oxalate samples collected prior to the first dose of 
lumasiran. In Cohort B, only pre-dialysis samples are utilized. 
In Cohort A the mean (SD) eGFR was 19.85 (9.6) mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline and 16.43 (9.8) 
mL/min/1.73m2 at month 6. 
The rate of renal stone events per person-year reported 12 months prior to consent for Cohort A and 
during the 6-month primary analysis period was 3.20 (95% CI: 1.96, 5.22) and 1.48 (95% CI: 0.55, 
3.92), respectively. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Oxlumo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in hyperoxaluria (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption  
Following subcutaneous administration, lumasiran is rapidly absorbed with a median (range) time to 
reach maximum plasma concentration (tmax) of 4.0 (0.5 to 12.0) hours. In children and adults with PH1 
≥20 kg, the peak plasma concentration of lumasiran (Cmax) and area under the concentration curve 
from time zero to the last measurable concentration after dosing (AUC0-last) following the 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended lumasiran dose of 3 mg/kg were 529 (205 to 1130) ng/mL and 
7400 (2890 to 10700) ng·h/mL, respectively. In children less than 20 kg, Cmax and AUC0-last of 
lumasiran following the recommended lumasiran dose of 6 mg/kg were 912 (523 to 1760) and 
7960 (5920 to 13300). Lumasiran concentrations were measurable, up to 24 to 48 hours post-dose. 
Distribution  
In healthy adult plasma samples, the protein binding of lumasiran is moderate to high (77 to 85%) at 
clinically relevant concentrations. For an adult patient with PH1, the population estimate for the 
apparent central volume of distribution (Vd/F) for lumasiran is 4.9 L. Lumasiran primarily distributes to 
the liver after subcutaneous dosing. 
Biotransformation  
Lumasiran is metabolised by endo- and exonucleases to oligonucleotides of shorter lengths. In vitro 
studies indicate that lumasiran does not undergo metabolism by CYP450 enzymes. 
Elimination  
Lumasiran is primarily eliminated from plasma by hepatic uptake, with only 7 to 26% of the 
administered dose recovered in urine as lumasiran in the pooled data from healthy adult subjects and 
patients with PH1 >6 years of age. The mean (%CV) terminal plasma half-life of lumasiran is 
5.2 (47.0%) hours. The population estimate for apparent plasma clearance was 26.5 L/h for a typical 
70-kg adult. The mean renal clearance of lumasiran was minor and ranged from 2.0 to 3.4 L/h in 
paediatric and adult patients with PH1. 
Linearity/non-linearity  
Lumasiran exhibited linear to slightly nonlinear, time-independent pharmacokinetics in plasma 
following single subcutaneous doses ranging from 0.3 to 6 mg/kg and multiple doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg 
once monthly or 3 mg/kg quarterly. There was no accumulation of lumasiran in plasma after repeated 
once monthly or quarterly dosing. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s)  
Plasma concentrations of lumasiran do not reflect the extent or duration of the pharmacodynamic 
activity of lumasiran. Rapid and targeted uptake of lumasiran by the liver results in rapid decline in 
plasma concentrations. In the liver, lumasiran exhibits a long half-life leading to maintenance of 
pharmacodynamic effect over the monthly or quarterly dosing interval. 
Interactions  
In vitro studies indicate that lumasiran is not a substrate or an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes. Lumasiran is not expected to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes or modulate the activities of 
drug transporters. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
No studies have been conducted in patients ≥65 years of age. Age was not a significant covariate in the 
pharmacokinetics of lumasiran. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gender and race 
In clinical studies, there was no difference in the plasma exposure or pharmacodynamics of lumasiran 
based on gender or race. 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Limited 
pharmacokinetic data in patients with mild and transient elevations in total bilirubin (total 
bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5×ULN) showed comparable plasma exposure of lumasiran and similar 
pharmacodynamics as patients with normal hepatic function. Published literature show lower 
expression of the asialoglycoprotein receptors in the liver, i.e. the receptors responsible for lumasiran 
uptake, in patients with hepatic impairment. Nonclinical data suggest that this may not influence liver 
uptake or pharmacodynamics at therapeutic doses. The clinical relevance of these data is unknown. 
Renal impairment 
Patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) had comparable plasma 
exposure of lumasiran as patients with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). In patients 
with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) Cmax was similar to that in patients 
with normal renal function; AUC was 25% higher based on limited data. In patients with severe renal 
impairment (eGFR 15 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), ESRD (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2), or who are on 
dialysis (see section 4.2), within the same body weight category, a transient 1.8 to 3.6 fold higher Cmax 
and 1.6 to 3.1 fold higher AUC0-last was observed (see section 5.2). These increases were transient as 
plasma concentrations decline below the level of detection within 24 to 48 hours, similar to patients 
without renal impairment (see section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s)). The 
pharmacodynamics in patients with renal impairment (eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2), including ESRD 
(eGFR<15 mL/min/1.73 m2) or those on dialysis were similar to patients with normal renal function 
(eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population  
Data in children younger than 1 year of age are limited. In children <20 kg, lumasiran Cmax was 2-fold 
higher due to the nominally higher 6-mg/kg dose and faster absorption rate. The pharmacodynamics of 
lumasiran were comparable in paediatric patients (aged 4 months to 17 years) and in adults, despite the 
transiently higher plasma concentrations in children <20 kg, due to the rapid and predominant 
distribution of lumasiran to the liver. 
Body weight 
The recommended dosing regimens yielded up to 2-fold higher Cmax in children <20 kg while AUC 
was similar across the body weights studied (6.2 to 110 kg). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. 
In rats, but not in monkeys, microscopic changes in the liver (e.g. hepatocellular vacuolation, mitosis 
and karyomegaly) were observed, accompanied by decrease in plasma fibrinogen levels and other 
laboratory changes. The reason for the apparent rodent-specificity is not understood and the relevance 
for humans is unclear. 
Lumasiran did not show any adverse effects on male and female fertility and pre- and post-natal 
development in rats. In embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, skeletal abnormalities 
were observed, but at high exposure multiples relative to human therapeutic exposures. The NOAELs 
were approximately 20- to 70-times higher (based on monthly exposures). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A dose-range finding toxicity study in neonate rats did not show increased sensitivity of the 
developing rat to either the toxicology or pharmacology of lumasiran at exposure multiples of 2 
compared to human therapeutic exposures (based on monthly exposures).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Oxlumo is and what it is used for 
What Oxlumo is 
Oxlumo contains the active substance lumasiran. 
What Oxlumo is used for 
Oxlumo is used to treat primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) in adults and children of all ages. 
What PH1 is 
PH1 is a rare illness in which the liver produces too much of a substance called oxalate. Your kidneys 
remove oxalate from the body and it is passed out in the urine. In people with PH1, the extra oxalate 
can build up in the kidneys and cause kidney stones, and can stop the kidney from working as well as 
they should. A build-up of oxalate can also damage other parts of the body such as eyes, heart, skin, 
and bone. This is called oxalosis. 
How Oxlumo works 
Lumasiran, the active substance in Oxlumo, reduces the amount of an enzyme called glycolate oxidase 
that the liver makes. Glycolate oxidase is one of the enzymes involved in producing oxalate. By 
lowering the amount of the enzyme, the liver produces less oxalate and the levels of oxalate in the 
urine and blood also fall. This can help to reduce the effects of the illness. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Oxlumo 
You must not be given Oxlumo: 
• 
if you are severely allergic to lumasiran, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6).  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before being given this medicine. 
Your doctor may monitor you for signs of metabolic acidosis (the build-up of acid in the body) if you 
have severe renal impairment. 
Other medicines and Oxlumo 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
nurse for advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will decide whether you should take Oxlumo 
after considering the expected health benefits for you as well as the risks to your unborn baby. 
Breast-feeding 
This medicine may pass into breast milk and it could have an effect on your baby. If you are 
breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will help you 
decide whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop treatment.  
Driving and using machines 
This medicine is unlikely to have any effect on your ability to drive or use machines. 
Oxlumo contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per mL, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.

How Oxlumo is given 
This medicine will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. 
• 
It is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneously) into your stomach area (abdomen), or 
in some cases, your upper arm or thigh. You will be given the injection in a different spot from 
one injection to the next. 
Depending on your dose, more than one subcutaneous injection may need to be given. 
Your doctor or nurse will not inject into skin areas that are scarred, reddened, inflamed, or 
swollen. 
• 
• 
If you are given too much Oxlumo 
In the unlikely event that your doctor or nurse gives you too much (an overdose) they will check you 
for side effects. 
If you miss your dose of Oxlumo 
If you miss a dose of Oxlumo, talk to your doctor or nurse as soon as possible about when to get your 
next dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

Instructions for use  
For subcutaneous use only. 
•  Collect materials not included in the pack that are needed for administration which will include a 
sterile syringe (0.3 mL, 1 mL, or 3 mL), an 18-gauge (G) needle, and a 25-G to 31-G needle. 
•  Calculate the required volume of Oxlumo based on the recommended weight-based dose. If the 
dose is more than 0.5 mL, you will need to use more than one vial. The maximum acceptable 
single injection volume to be administered is 1.5 mL. If more than 1.5 mL is needed, you may 
need to give more than one subcutaneous injection. 
•  To withdraw Oxlumo, hold the vial upright or tilt at a slight angle and ensure the flat edge of the 
needle is pointed downwards. 
•  Point the needle and syringe straight up and tap the syringe to move any bubbles to the top. Once 
the bubbles are at the top, gently push the plunger to force the bubbles out of the syringe. Check to 
ensure the correct amount of medicine is in the syringe. 
•  Administer the medicine with a sterile 25- to 31-G needle with a 13-mm or 16-mm needle length 
for subcutaneous injection. For volumes less than 0.3 mL, a sterile 0.3-mL syringe is 
recommended. 
•  Note: Do not push this medicine into the 25-G to 31-G needle. When using 0.3 mL (insulin) 
• 
syringes, do not force the bubble from syringe. 
Injection can be into the abdomen, upper arms, or thighs. Consider rotating injection sites. Do not 
administer into scar tissue or areas that are reddened, inflamed, or swollen. 
•  Note: When administering subcutaneous injections into the abdomen, avoid a 2.0-cm diameter 
circle around the navel. 
•  Clean the area of planned injection with an alcohol swab and wait for the area to dry completely. 
•  Ensure proper injection technique. Do not inject into a vein or muscle. 
• 
Insert the needle at a right angle (90 degrees) to deliver the injection just below the skin. In 
patients with little subcutaneous tissue, the needle should be inserted at a 45-degree angle. 
•  Do not press down on the plunger while piercing the skin. Once the needle is inserted through the 
skin, release the pinched skin and administer the dose in a slow and steady manner. Once the 
medicine has been administered count for at least 5 seconds before withdrawing the needle from 
the skin. Lightly press gauze or cotton ball on the injection site as needed. Do not put the needle 
cap back on. 
•  Note: Do not aspirate after inserting the needle to prevent tissue damage, haematoma, and 
• 
bruising. 
If more than one injection is needed for a single dose of Oxlumo, the injection sites should be at 
least 2 cm apart. 
•  Only use the vial once. After administering the dose, dispose of any unused medicine in the vial 
according to local regulations. 
•  Use the syringes, transfer needles, and injection needles only once. Dispose of any used syringes 
and needles in accordance with local regulations.

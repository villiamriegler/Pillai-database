Summary of risk management plan for Nyvepria (PF-06881894) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Nyvepria.  The RMP details 
important risks of Nyvepria, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Nyvepria risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Nyvepria’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Nyvepria should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for Nyvepria should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of  
Nyvepria’s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
Nyvepria has been developed as a biosimilar to Neulasta (pegfilgrastim), for reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia and the incidence of FN in adult patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and 
myelodysplastic syndromes).  It contains pegfilgrastim as the active substance and it is 
administered subcutaneously. 
Further information about the evaluation of Nyvepria’s benefits can be found in Nyvepria’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/neulasta 
II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Nyvepria, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined 
below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Page 1
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about AEs is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Nyvepria is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Nyvepria are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Nyvepria.  Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine);

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available data sources, 
including Amgen and PF-06881894 clinical studies and Amgen post-marketing 
AE reporting.  There were no events of capillary leak syndrome in Amgen 
pegfilgrastim placebo controlled clinical studies or in PF-06881894 clinical 
studies.  
Capillary leak syndrome has been reported after administration of multiple drugs, 
some of which include interleukins, gemcitabine, doxorubicin, granulocyte-
macrophage colony stimulating, and interferon. Capillary leak syndrome has also 
been reported in relation to miscellaneous conditions such as carbon monoxide 
poisoning, postpartum state, and pustular psoriasis.

Risk minimisation 
measures 
Data to evaluate the safety concerns are derived from available data sources, 
including Amgen and PF-06881894 clinical studies and Amgen post-marketing 
AE reporting.  The Amgen placebo-controlled clinical study data show a higher 
rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome in subjects receiving pegfilgrastim 
compared to subjects receiving placebo.  There were no events of ARDS in PF-
06881894 clinical trials. 
Risk factors include concurrent chemotherapy and infections.  A number of 
studies have showed that elevated risk of interstitial pneumonia is associated with 
use of rituximab in NHL. Interstitial pneumonitis and other interstitial lung 
diseases have been seen with other chemotherapy agents in the setting of lung 
cancer, particularly in Japan.

placebo controlled clinical studies.  There were no events of sickle cell crisis in 
PF-06881894 clinical trials.  
Patients with sickle cell disease are at risk for sickle cell crisis.  Factors such as 
infections, dehydration, low oxygen tension, acidosis, extreme physical exercise, 
physical or psychologic stress, alcohol, pregnancy, cold weather, and concomitant 
medical conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, herpes) have been 
identified as the cause of sickle cell crisis.

Chemotherapy only and radiotherapy and chemotherapy increase the risk of 
AML/MDS among elderly women diagnosed with breast cancer.  
AML 
Increased risk of AML has been reported among relatives of patients with 
leukaemia; patients receiving alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors; 
and exposure to environmental risk factors including radiation, benzene, 
pesticides, smoking, diagnostic radiology, chloramphenicol, and viruses.  
MDS 
Risk factors for MDS include first degree relatives with history of MDS, aplastic 
anaemia, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, ionizing radiation, alkylating 
agents, halogenated organics, copper, arc welding fumes, exhaust gases, 
pesticides, smoking, hair dye, benzene, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons in air 
pollution.

Risk factors and risk

Risk minimisation 
measures 
Patients receiving bi-specific antibodies and T cells engineered to express anti-
CD19 chimeric antigen receptor are at particularly high risk for cytokine release 
syndrome. The severity of the cytokine release syndrome mediating infusion 
reaction might be related to the number of circulating lymphocytes. Among 
patients with B-cell malignancies, risk factors for developing cytokine release 
syndrome included higher bone marrow tumour burden, higher chimeric antigen 
receptor T-cell (CAR-T) cell dose, bulk CD8+ T-cell selection, lymphodepletion 
using fludarabine/ cyclophosphamide, and presence of thrombocytopenia before 
lymphodepletion.  
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
None. 
CAR-T = Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell

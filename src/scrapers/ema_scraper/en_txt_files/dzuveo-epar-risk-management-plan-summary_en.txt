Summary of risk management plan for Dzuveo (Sufentanil (as 
citrate)) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Dzuveo. The RMP details important risks of 
Dzuveo, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information  will be obtained about Dzuveo 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Dzuveo summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information to 
Healthcare Professionals and patients on how Dzuveo should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Dzuveo should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Dzuveo RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Dzuveo  is  an  opioid  pain  medicine  used  to  treat  moderate  to  severe  pain  in  adults.  It  is  a  ‘hybrid 
medicine’. This means that it is similar to a ‘reference medicine’ (called Sufenta Forte) containing the 
same active substance. The difference between the products is that Dzuveo is available as sublingual 
tablets (tablets to be dissolved under the tongue) while the reference medicine is a solution for injection. 
Dzuveo contains the active substance sufentanil. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Dzuveo, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Dzuveo risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and Healthcare Professionals 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly 
• 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the case of  Dzuveo, these  measures are  supplemented  with  additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Dzuveo is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Dzuveo are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can be regarded 
as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with 
the use of Dzuveo. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been  established yet and needs further 
evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Respiratory depression  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Sufentanil may cause respiratory depression, for which the 
the medicine 
degree/severity is dose related. The respiratory effects of 
sufentanil should be assessed by clinical monitoring, e.g., 
respiratory rate, sedation level and oxygen saturation. 
Respiratory depression caused by sufentanil can be reversed by 
opioid antagonists. Repeat antagonist administration may be 
required as the duration of respiratory depression may last 
longer than the duration of the effect of the antagonist. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients at higher risk are those with respiratory impairment or 
reduced respiratory reserve. Respiratory depression is a 
particular concern in very elderly and debilitated patients and 
those with underlying pulmonary conditions such as chronic 
bronchitis, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, or those who receive other CNS drugs that affect 
ventilation (Pergolizzi et al. 2008). CNS depressants such as 
benzodiazepines, barbiturates, antidepressants, phenothiazine 
derivatives, and alcohol increase the risk of respiratory 
depression if taken with any opioid analgesia (Dahan and 
Teppema 2003, Pergolizzi et al. 2008) this may progress to 
apnoea.

Important potential risk: Drug abuse and drug diversion 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Similar to all opioids, sufentanil is known to have a risk of abuse 
the medicine 
(misuse) and diversion (illegal use for recreational purposes). 
Dzuveo is administered by the HCP to the patient.  However, it is 
known that due to the nature of the medicine some people may 
try to use sufentanil for illegal purposes. The product information 
warns about the potential risk of abuse and diversion with 
sufentanil. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with a high potential for abuse include those with a 
history of substance abuse or psychiatric issues.

Prescription only medicine 
Important potential risk: Overdose 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic or severe renal 
the medicine 
impairment should be monitored carefully for symptoms of 
sufentanil overdose.  
Management of sufentanil overdose should be focused on 
treating symptoms of µ-opioid receptor agonism including 
administration of oxygen and opioid antagonists. Primary 
attention should be given to obstruction of airways and the 
necessity of assisted or controlled ventilation. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Opioid overdose has been associated with a history of depression 
or substance abuse and is related to the dose prescribed. Elderly 
patients and patients with renal impairment are also at increased 
risk. Sufentanil should also be used with caution in patients with 
previous or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias as sufentanil in 
overdose is known to cause bradycardia. In hypovolemic 
 
 
 
patients sufentanil in overdose may cause hypotension and 
appropriate measures should be taken to maintain stable arterial 
pressure.

Important potential risk: Hypotension 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Sufentanil may cause hypotension, especially in hypovolemic 
the medicine 
patients. Appropriate measures should be taken to maintain 
stable arterial pressure. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Hypovolemic patients are at increased risk of hypotension.

Evidence for linking the risk to 
Warning to use sufentanil with caution in patients who may be 
the medicine 
particularly susceptible to the cerebral effects of CO2 and 
patients with brain tumours is included in SmPC. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients who are particularly susceptible are those with impaired 
consciousness, head injuries or brain tumours.

Important potential risk: Convulsion  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Compounds with μ-opioid receptor agonist activity in general are 
the medicine 
known to have excitatory effects on the CNS (Duthie and Nimmo 
1987). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
For opioids with active metabolites, such as pethidine, codeine, 
morphine, and (to a lesser degree) hydromorphone, use of the 
opioid for a period greater than a few days may increase the risk 
of convulsions when the dose of the metabolite builds up 
(Gallagher 2007). Factors such as dehydration, infection, or 
adding drugs that depress the CNS can increase the risk of 
convulsions in the elderly.

II.C Post-authorisation development plan 
II.C.1 Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation 
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligation of 
Dzuveo. 
II.C.2 Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
Survey aiming at measuring the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures (routine / 
additional): Study short name and title:  
Dzuveo HPG Effectiveness Survey. 
Purpose of the study: A survey containing questions on the actual use of Dzuveo will be performed in 
order to assess whether the HCP followed the guidance provided in the educational materials. The survey 
will be initiated 6 months to 2 years after Dzuveo launch in selected medical centres across EU countries 
(depending on market penetration and use of Dzuveo) and aims at capturing the understanding of the 
appropriate use of the product.

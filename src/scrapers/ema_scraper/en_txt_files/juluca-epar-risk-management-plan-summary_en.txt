 Summary of risk management plan (RMP) for JULUCA 
(dolutegravir/rilpivirine) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for JULUCA. The RMP details 
important risks of JULUCA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about JULUCA's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
JULUCA's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how JULUCA should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for JULUCA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
JULUCA's RMP. 
I.
The medicine and what it is used for
JULUCA is authorised for the treatment of HIV infection (see SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains dolutegravir and rilpivirine as the active substances and it is given as a tablet by 
mouth. 
Further information about the evaluation of JULUCA’s benefits can be found in JULUCA’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/juluca 
II.
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise
or further characterise the risks
Important risks of JULUCA, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about JULUCA's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
1
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of JULUCA these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of JULUCA is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of JULUCA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of JULUCA. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine); 
JULUCA is a new medicine that does not contain a new active substance. The identified and 
potential risks for JULUCA have been taken from the approved TIVICAY (dolutegravir 
(DTG)) and EDURANT (rilpivirine (RPV)) RMPs. No new risks have been identified for 
JULUCA.

Summary of important risks 
JULUCA is a new medicine that does not contain a new active substance. The identified and 
potential risks for JULUCA have been taken from the approved TIVICAY (dolutegravir) and 
EDURANT (rilpivirine) RMPs. No new risks have been identified for JULUCA.

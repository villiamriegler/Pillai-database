1.  Introduction 
On  29  July  2020,  the  MAH  submitted  a  study  report  for  a  completed  clinical  study  (study  number 
IM101566) for ORENCIA, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The study enrolled a mixed population of adult and paediatric patients. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  study  number  IM101566,  entitled  “A  Phase  II  Randomized,  Placebo-Controlled, 
Double-Blind,  Parallel  Arms  with  Switchover,  Pilot  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of 
Intravenous  Abatacept 
in  Treatment  Resistant  Nephrotic  Syndrome 
(Focal  Segmental 
Glomerulosclerosis/ Minimal Change Disease)” is a stand alone study. 
The  MAH  stated  that,  in  accordance  with  Article  16(2)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the  data 
submitted  do  not  influence  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  ORENCIA  and  therefore  no  further  impact  on 
the ORENCIA product information is anticipated. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Intravenous abatacept, currently marketed for use in adult and paediatric subjects with RA/pJIA, is a 
sterile, white, preservative-free, lyophilised powder for “concentrate for solution” IV use. This was the 
formulation used in Study IM101566. 
There  is  no  difference  in  the  way  the  abatacept  dose  is  prepared  for  and  administered  to  adult  and 
paediatric/adolescent  populations.  A  silicone-free  syringe  was  used  to  reconstitute  the  lyophilised 
powder and for transfer to the infusion bag/bottle. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
study  number  IM101566,  entitled  “A  Phase  II  Randomized,  Placebo-Controlled,  Double-Blind, 
Parallel  Arms  with  Switchover,  Pilot  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Intravenous 
Abatacept  in  Treatment  Resistant  Nephrotic  Syndrome  (Focal  Segmental  Glomerulosclerosis/ 
Minimal Change Disease)” 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study IM101566 
Description 
Study  IM101566  was  a  Phase  2  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  arms  with  switchover,  placebo-
controlled multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous abatacept in adult and 
paediatric patients with treatment resistant nephrotic syndrome (TRNS).

Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary Objective: 
•  Demonstrate  improvement  in  nephrotic  range  proteinuria  to  sub-nephrotic  range  while 
maintaining renal function following treatment with abatacept compared to placebo. 
o  Demonstrate  difference  in  percent  of  renal  responders  defined  by  composite  renal 
index at Day 113. 
Secondary Objectives: 
•  Assess  improvement  in  change  from  baseline  in  the  level  of  proteinuria  following  treatment 
with abatacept compared to placebo. 
o  Assess  difference  in  mean  change  from  baseline  in  urine  protein/creatinine  ratio 
(UPCR) at Day 113. 
•  Assess improvement in serum albumin levels following treatment with abatacept compared to 
placebo. 
o  Assess difference in mean change from baseline in serum albumin at Day 113. 
•  Assess  improvement  in  complete  remission  while  maintaining  renal  function  following 
treatment with abatacept compared to placebo. 
o  Assess  difference  in  percent  of  subjects  achieving  complete  remission  (UPCR  ≤  0.3) 
with preservation of eGFR at Day 113. 
•  Assess improvement in patient reported outcomes related to nephrotic syndrome. 
o  Assess  changes  using  the  Patient  Reported  Outcomes  Measurement  Information 
System (PROMIS). 
•  Assess the safety and immunogenicity of abatacept in subjects with TRNS. 
o  Describe rates of AEs and SAEs and immunogenicity testing. 
•  Assess the pharmacokinetics of abatacept in subjects with TRNS. 
Study design 
In  the  original  study  design,  subjects  were  to  be  randomised  1:1  to  IV  abatacept  or  placebo  in  a 
double-blind fashion into parallel arms with a switchover study design. The trial consisted of 5 periods: 
the  Screening  Period  was  28  days  (could  be  extended  an  additional  14  days  to  complete  testing  by 
repeating  screening  labs),  a  16  week  Treatment  Period  1  (parallel  arms:  IV  abatacept  vs  placebo),  a 
switchover in treatment in a second 16-week Treatment Period 2, and a 169 day abatacept Open Label 
Extension  Period  (OLE),  and  a  6  month  Follow-up  Period.  The  original  study  design  is  depicted  in 
Figure 1.

Figure 1. Original IM101566 Study Design 
In  an  attempt  to  improve  enrolment,  the  study  design  was  modified  after  study  initiation  within 
Amendment 2 of the study protocol. The final study design was also to randomise subjects 1:1 to IV 
abatacept  or  placebo  in  a  double-blind  fashion  into  parallel  arms  but  without  the  switchover  and  a 
blinded Period 2. The trial consisted of 4 periods: the Screening Period was 28 days (could be extended 
an additional 14 days to complete testing by repeating screening labs), a 16 week Double-Blind Period 
(parallel arms: IV abatacept vs placebo), and a 169 day abatacept Open Label Extension Period (OLE), 
and a 6 month Follow-up Period. An optional early escape for subjects < 18 year of age was available 
on Day 85. The revised study design is shown in Figure 2.

Study population /Sample size 
Key inclusion criteria: 
•  Male and female subjects aged 6 years or older 
•  Subjects  diagnosed  with  TRNS  due  to  either  focal  segmental  glomerulosclerosis  (FSGS)  or 
Minimal Change Disease (MCD) [TRNS (FSGS/MCD)] 
o  Pathological  findings  of  either  FSGS  (excluding  collapsing  FSGS)  or  MCD  on  the  most 
recent renal biopsy (renal biopsies will not be part of this study). This will be confirmed 
by review of the pathology report (not slides) by a central pathologist 
o  UPCR ≥ 3 at screening 
o  Treatment resistant defined as: 
 
Persistence  of  UPCR  ≥  3  in  spite  of  therapy  with  any  one  of  the  following 
agents:  corticosteroids 
(CS),  calcineurin 
inhibitors 
(cyclosporine  and 
tacrolimus), sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolic acid (MPA) 
or cyclophosphamide 
  Duration  of  therapy:  The  duration  of  CS  therapy  required  to  determine 
treatment  resistance  will  be  6  weeks  in  subjects  <  18  year  of  age  and 
12 weeks for subjects ≥ 18 years. For all other agents, the minimum duration 
of therapy will be 16 weeks, regardless of age 
 
Intolerance to any two of these agents, regardless of duration of treatment or 
age 
•  Subjects  must  be  receiving  either  an  angiotensin-converting-enzyme  inhibitor  (ACEi)  or  an 
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at stable doses for at least 2 weeks prior to randomisation 
unless intolerance is documented. Combined use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors 
will  not  be  allowed.  If  aldosterone  inhibitors  (spirolactone  or  eplerenone)  or  aliskiren  (direct 
renin inhibitor) are used, they must also be at stable doses. 
•  A  minimal  level  of  renal  function  at  screening  based  on  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate 
(eGFR) will be required (≥ 45 for both children and adults) 
•  APOL1  Genotyping.  Subjects  will  be  genotyped  for  the  APOL1  renal  risk  variants  SNPs  [Risk 
allele  G1  (rs73885319  and  rs60910145)  and  risk  allele  G2  (rs71785313)].  Subjects  with 
2 copies  of  the  high-risk  APOL1  variants  are  in  the  APOL1  high-risk  group  which  will  be  used 
for stratification at randomization. Genotyping during screening will not be necessary if results 
of previous testing are available. Subjects will be allowed to opt-out of genotyping for APOL1. 
Subjects who refuse genotyping will still be eligible to be randomised. 
•  Concomitant medication. Subjects may enrol with or without the following background agents 
used  to  treat  TRNS  (FSGS/MCD):  CS  (low  dose,  prednisone  or  equivalent  at  doses 
≤ 10 mg/day), calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus), MMF or  MPA.  Agents must 
be used at standard doses, must not have been started within 8 weeks of enrolment and must 
be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to randomisation. No adjustment in doses of concomitant 
medications will be allowed during the double-blind period. Dose decrease or holds to address 
drug-related toxicity are allowed.

Key exclusion criteria: 
•  Subjects with causes of TRNS other than FSGS or MCD (eg, IgA  nephropathy, obesity related 
glomerulopathy or membranous nephropathy) 
•  Subjects with collapsing FSGS, also known as collapsing glomerulopathy 
•  Subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
•  Subjects with diabetes mellitus, both type 1 and type 2 
•  Subjects  with  clinically  significant  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF;  New  York  Heart  Association 
[NYHA] Class III or Class IV) 
•  Body mass index (BMI) > 40 for adults 
The  study  was  planned  to  randomise  90  subjects  to  assess  the  primary  endpoint  of  proportion  of 
subjects  in  Renal  Response  at  Day  113  between  the  IV  Abatacept  and  placebo  arms.  Randomisation 
was stratified by genotype (APOL1 high risk group vs Others) and age (< 18 and ≥ 18 years). 
Treatments 
Subjects randomised to abatacept treatment in the Double-Blind Period were dosed as follows. 
•  Adults  used  the  weight-tiered  dose:  <  60  kg:  500  mg,  60  to  100  kg:  750  mg,  >  100  kg: 
1000 mg; 
• 
Paediatric patients 6 to 17 years who weigh < 75 kg received 10 mg/kg and those who weigh 
≥ 75 kg followed adult dosing. 
Dosing  was  on  Day  1,  15,  29  and  then  every  28  days  for  113  days.  Subjects  in  the  placebo  arm 
received  normal  saline  or  D5W  following  the  same  dosing  schedule.  In  the  open-label  extension,  all 
subjects received age and weight-based IV abatacept every 28 days for 169 days. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  in  Renal  Response  at  Day  113.  Renal 
Response was defined as a subject meeting all of the following criteria: 
• 
Proteinuria:  Reduction  of  baseline  urine  protein/creatinine  ratio  (UPCR)  of  ≥  50%  and  to  less 
than 3. 
•  Renal  function:  No  worsening  of  baseline  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (eGFR),  defined 
as  within  normal  range  if  normal  at  baseline,  or  ≥  75%  baseline  value  if  below  normal  at 
baseline. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
•  Mean change from baseline in UPCR at Day 113 
•  Mean change from baseline in serum albumin at Day 113 
• 
Proportion of subjects achieving complete remission (UPCR ≤ 0.3 with eGFR: normal or ≥ 75% 
of baseline value if below normal at baseline) at Day 113 
•  Mean change from baseline in PROMIS measures at Day 113.

Safety endpoints included: 
• 
all adverse events (AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, deaths, etc) and AEs of interest 
(infections,  malignancies,  autoimmune  disorders,  infusion  related  reactions,  renal-related 
events). 
The  immunogenicity  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  positive  antibody  response  relative 
to baseline over time. 
Exploratory  endpoints  comprised  mean  change  from  baseline  in  serum  total  cholesterol  and 
triglycerides  at  Day  113;  and  mean  change  in  height  standard  deviation  score  (HSDS)  in  subjects 
< 18 years at Day 113. 
Statistical Methods 
Table 1 summarises the MAH’s planned efficacy analyses. 
Table 1. Summary of Planned Efficacy Analyses 
The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  using  the  ITT  Analysis  Population  by 
treatment  group  assigned  at  randomisation  during  the  double-blind  period.  The  primary  analysis  was 
to be repeated using the PP analysis population if more than 10% of subjects in any treatment group 
met the criteria for a relevant protocol deviation. All other efficacy analyses were performed using the 
ITT Analysis Population, unless otherwise specified. 
Analysis of all safety data followed the MAH’s standard safety data conventions and supplements to the 
standard  conventions  for  the  abatacept  programs.  The  evaluation  of  drug  safety  was  based  primarily 
on  clinical  AEs,  vital  signs  and  laboratory  abnormalities  reported  during  the  study.  All  safety 
presentations were based on the As Treated Analysis Population by treatment group. Unless otherwise 
specified  adverse  events  and  laboratory  abnormalities  were  summarised  for  double-blind  period, 
cumulative  abatacept  safety  period  and  OLE  period.  The  efficacy  analysis  was  mainly  focused  on  the 
double-blind period.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 66 subjects were enrolled at 24 sites in the US, and 36 were randomised and treated. The 
remaining 30 enrolled subjects failed to meet study criteria. Of the 36 randomised subjects, 16 were 
less than 18 years of age. 
The  enrolment  period  lasted  approximately  36  months.  The  MAH  terminated  Study  IM101566 
prematurely  due  to  concerns  over  an  unexpectedly  slow  rate  of  enrolment,  in  spite  of  previously 
extending the study recruitment timelines and multiple efforts to increase enrolment, including a major 
protocol  revision.  The  Data  Monitoring  Committee  also  voiced  concern  over  the  slow  enrolment  to 
complete and achieve the primary study efficacy assessment and recommended study termination. 
Baseline data 
For  all  randomised  and  treated  subjects,  the  mean  (SD)  age  was  25.8  (16.80)  years,  55.6%  of 
subjects were female and most subjects were white (75.0%) and not Hispanic/Latino (80.6%). For the 
paediatric subjects, mean (SD) age was 11.0 (3.06) years, 43.8% of subjects were female, and most 
subjects  were  white  (62.5%)  and  not  Hispanic/Latino  (75.0%).  Baseline  demographic  characteristics 
for the entire study population and the paediatric subgroup are summarised in Tables 2 and 3.

Efficacy results 
Subject disposition 
Subject disposition is summarised in Table 6. A total of 27 subjects (75%) completed the double-blind 
period, and 22 (61.1%) were treated in Period 2 (with the remaining 5 subjects entering OLE directly 
after  the  double-blind  period  as  per  amended  study  design).  A  total  of  23  subjects  (63.9%)  were 
treated in OLE, and 10 subjects (27.8%) completed OLE. In all periods, lack of efficacy was the most 
common reason for discontinuation, while very few subjects discontinued due to an adverse event.

Efficacy results 
By Day 113 of the double-blind period, only one subject in the placebo group had reached the primary 
endpoint  of  Renal  Response  (Table  7).  A  breakdown  of  Renal  Response  by  age  group  is  displayed  in

Changes  from  baseline  in  UPCR,  serum  albumin  or  eGFR  were  very  small,  and  there  were  no 
differences  between  treatment  groups  (Table  9).  Very  little  effect  was  seen  on  any  domain  of  the 
PROMIS measures.

Extent of exposure 
During  the  double-blind  period,  27  subjects  (75%)  received  5  infusions  of  medication  and  9  subjects 
(25%)  received  3-4  infusions.  The  mean  (SD)  number  of  days  of  exposure  was  105.4  (15.75)  days 
(Table 10).

No  deaths  were  reported during  the  study.  SAEs  were  reported  in  9  subjects  during  the  double-blind 
period  (5  in  the  abatacept  group  and  4  in  the  placebo  group;  Table  13).  Of  these,  one  SAE  was 
considered related to study drug; this was a  case of Grade 1 lip swelling on study day 6 in a subject 
assigned to placebo. The event resolved on day 8 and no action was taken concerning the study drug. 
During the cumulative abatacept period, a total of 10 subjects experienced an SAE (Table 14).

The  MAH  has  separately  highlighted  four  SAEs  as  follows:  one  subject  had  new  onset  of  reported 
seizures  7  weeks  after  the  last  infusion  of  abatacept;  one  subject  had  a  complex  medical  event 
characterised by acute kidney injury associated with thrombotic microangiopathy and pneumonia due 
to  RSV,  almost  4  months  after  the  last  dose  of  abatacept;  one  subject  developed  a  tunnel  graft

infection  over  6  months  after  last  abatacept  dose;  and  one  subject  develop  a  parainfluenza  virus 
pneumonia  after  their  3rd  dose  of  abatacept  (this  was  the  only  serious  infection  associated  with 
abatacept use). 
During the double-blind period, three subjects (8.3%) experienced an AE that led to discontinuation: in 
the abatacept group, 1 subject discontinued due to fluid overload, and in the placebo group, 1 subject 
discontinued  due  to  influenza  and  another  subject  due  to  acute  kidney  injury.  During  the  cumulative 
abatacept  period,  2  subjects  (6.3%)  had  an  AE  that  led  to  discontinuation  (1  subject  with  diarrhoea, 
face oedema and non-cardiac chest pain, and 1 subject with fluid overload). 
Most frequently reported AEs across both dose groups during the double-blind period are displayed in 
Table  15.  During  the  cumulative  abatacept  period,  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  nausea 
(25%), diarrhoea (21.9%), vomiting (21.9%), headache (18.8%) and upper respiratory tract infection 
(15.6%). 
Table 15. Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events during the Double-Blind Period: All Treated 
Subjects 
Among  pre-specified  AEs  of  special  interest,  peri-infusional  AEs  were  more  frequent  with  abatacept 
than  placebo.  Other  AEs  of  special  interest  were  equally  distributed  between  treatment  groups,  the 
most common AE of special interest being an infection in both groups (Table 16).

Table 16. Adverse Events of Special Interest: All Treated Subjects 
There  were  no  particular  findings  in  clinical  laboratory  assessments.  The  most  frequent  laboratory 
abnormality was a low total protein concentration, observed in 4 subjects on abatacept and 6 subjects 
on placebo. 
According to the MAH, the overall safety observed was consistent with that seen in abatacept trials and 
more  favourable  than  that  seen  in  randomised  controlled  trials  with  abatacept  for  the  treatment  of 
active lupus nephritis. 
Pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity results 
In  study  IM101566, PK blood samples were obtained pre-dose and 0.5 hours  post-dose in relation to 
each study drug administration. In addition, samples were collected at 1 week intervals between study 
days  85  and  113  for  determination  of  the  area  under  the  serum  time  curve  over  a  dosing  interval 
(AUCtau).  Trough  (Cmin)  and  maximum  observed  serum  concentrations  (Cmax)  and  AUCtau  are 
summarised  in  Table  17.  The  results  in  the  overall  populations  showed  that  trough  concentration  did 
not  reach  therapeutic  levels  of  10  ug/mL,  with  the  exception  of  Day  29  within  the  adult  population. 
According  to  the  MAH,  the  detrimental effects  of  ongoing  proteinuria  contributed to  the observed  PK, 
and  the  lower  exposures  compared  to  those  seen  in  non-proteinuric  patients  were  therefore  as 
expected.

In study IM101566, immunogenicity was evaluated at Day 1 (Baseline) and at Day 113. For subjects 
who discontinued during or at the end of the Double-blind Treatment Period, immunogenicity was also 
evaluated  56,  84  and  168  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  medication.  Immunogenicity  results  are 
summarised in Table 18. In the abatacept group, 1 out of 14 subjects (7.1%) had a positive CTLA4 and 
possibly Ig response at Day 113, and 3 out of 7 subjects (42.9%) had a positive CTLA4 and possibly Ig 
response  during  post-treatment  visits.  In  the  placebo  group,  no  subjects  had  a  positive  response  at 
Day 113, whereas 2 out of 5 subjects (40.0%) had a positive CTLA4 and possibly Ig response during 
post-treatment  visits.  No  paediatric  subjects  in  the  abatacept  group  had  a  positive  response  either 
during  or  post  treatment,  whereas  in  the  placebo  group,  one  paediatric  subject  developed  a  positive 
response post treatment. According to the MAH, the presence of anti-drug antibodies had no effect on 
the PK or safety.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study  IM101566  was  a  double-blind  placebo-controlled  Phase  2  study  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and 
safety  of  intravenous  abatacept  in  the  treatment  of  treatment  resistant  nephrotic  syndrome.  In 
principle,  the  design  elements  as  described  are  considered  adequate  and  fit  for  purpose.  A  mixed 
population  of  adult  and  paediatric  subjects  was  to  be  enrolled,  and  randomisation  was  stratified  by 
age.  For  purposes  of  Article  46,  it  should  be  noted  that  there  was  no  specified  minimum  number  of 
paediatric subjects. 
Subject  enrolment  appears  to  have  been  challenging;  moreover,  a  significant  number  of  screened 
subjects  failed  to  meet  eligibility  criteria.  The  study  was  terminated  before  the  planned  number  of 
subjects had been randomised, and only 36 subjects, of which 16 subjects were in the paediatric age 
group,  were  ultimately  treated  with  study  drug  in  the  double-blind  period.  Overall,  32  subjects, 
including 15 paediatric subjects, were exposed to abatacept during the entire study. 
Overall, very few subjects demonstrated any signs of potential efficacy in respect of either the primary 
or  secondary  endpoints  assessed.  The  overall  safety  profile  was  consistent  with  previous  experience. 
The relatively low abatacept exposures observed in the study are readily explained by the underlying 
condition in the patient population studied. 
In  conclusion,  this  prematurely  terminated  Phase  2  study  did  not  suggest  that  abatacept  would  have 
general applicability for treatment resistant nephrotic syndrome in either adult or paediatric subjects, 
and  there  was  no  significant  new  safety  information.  Considering  the  very  limited  sample  size,  no 
further conclusions can be made. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The  current  study  does  not  seem  to  support  the  use  of  abatacept  in  treatment  resistant  nephrotic 
syndrome  (FSGS  or  MCD  type),  and  no  claims  thereto  are  made  by  the  MAH.  In  terms  of  paediatric 
use,  no  conclusions  relevant  to  Article  46  can  be  made  based  on  the  few  paediatric  subjects  treated 
within the study. Overall, the results of the study do not change the benefit-risk profile of abatacept in 
its  currently  approved  indications  for  use.  No  changes  to  the  current  product  information  are 
warranted.

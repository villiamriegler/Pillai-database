Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
II. 
the risks 
Important risks of Sunitinib Accord 12.5/25/37.5/50 mg hard capsules, together with measures to 
minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed  studies  for  learning  more  about  Sunitinib  Accord 
12.5/25/37.5/50 mg hard capsules risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed including signal management activity, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Sunitinib Accord 12.5/25/37.5/50 mg hard 
capsules is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Sunitinib Accord 12.5/25/37.5/50 mg hard capsules are risks that need special 
risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product

concerns  for  which  there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Sunitinib  Accord 
12.5/25/37.5/50 mg hard capsules. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the

established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-
term use of the medicine).

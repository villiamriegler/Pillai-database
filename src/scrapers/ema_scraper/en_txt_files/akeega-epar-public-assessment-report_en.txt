1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Janssen-Cilag International N.V. submitted on 28 April 2022 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for AKEEGA, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 May 2021. 
The applicant applied for a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of niraparib plus abiraterone acetate in 
combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who are positive for homologous recombination repair 
(HRR) gene alterations (germline and/or somatic). 
Legal basis 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended – relating to applications for new fixed combination 
products. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0244/2020 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver. 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the Applicant did not submit a critical report, addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the 
product was not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that 
despite the positive results of the pivotal Phase 3 study (MAGNITUDE), in which a statistically 
significant gain in radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) was observed in the randomized 
patient population, it was unclear that the proposed combination of niraparib + abiraterone would 
address an unmet need in the applied indication. Granting accelerated assessment was therefore not 
considered justified.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant applied for a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of niraparib plus abiraterone acetate for the 
treatment, in combination with prednisone or prednisolone, of adult patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who are positive for homologous recombination repair 
(HRR) gene alterations (germline and/or somatic). 
The finally agreed indication for Akeega is, in combination with prednisone or prednisolone, for the 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and BRCA1/2 
mutations in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Worldwide, prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer 
death in men, accounting for 1.4 million new cancer cases and 375,304 cancer deaths in 2020 (IARC 
2020). In Europe, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, with 473,344 new cases, 
representing 20.2% of all cancers in men, and 108,088 (10%) of cancer deaths in 2020 (IARC 2020).  
The incidence of prostate cancer correlates with age, with the average age at the time of diagnosis 
being 66 years (Rawla 2019). Of note, prostate cancer is more common in Black men compared with 
White or Hispanic men. 
The main prostate cancer risk factors are advanced age, ethnicity, genetic factors and family history. 
Other factors that have been associated with prostate cancer include diet, obesity and physical 
inactivity. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The oncogenesis of prostate cancer is associated with complex interactions between inherent germline 
susceptibility, acquired somatic gene alterations, and microenvironmental and macroenvironmental 
factors (Sandhu 2021). 
DNA damage response (DDR) genes have a key role in prostate cancer. The estimated prevalence of 
inherited DDR mutations in men with metastatic prostate cancer is approximately 12%, and these 
mutations are most commonly in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, RAD51D, and PALB2 (Pritchard 2016) 
Prostate cancers arising in patients with germline BRCA2 mutations often have more aggressive 
clinicopathological features and worse clinical outcomes (Castro et al 2013). However, the prognostic 
value of other germline mutations in DDR genes is not currently known. Somatic aberrations in DDR 
genes (most frequently, BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, CHEK2, CDK12, and PALB2) occur in approximately 23% 
of metastatic prostate cancers (Robinson 2015). Mutations in the BRCA (BRCA1 and/or BRCA2) are the 
most prevalent homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations in mCRPC (with BRCA2 more 
prevalent than BRCA1) with ATM the second most frequently mutated gene in mCRPC (Robinson 
2015). 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 12/196 
 
 
  
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients have localised disease. Patients diagnosed at an early 
stage are amenable to curative therapy, however advanced stages are life-threatening. Patients who 
present with metastatic disease at initial presentation typically have cancers with a more aggressive 
biology and have a shorter overall survival compared with patients who develop metastatic recurrence 
years after the initial diagnosis of primary prostate cancer. For patients diagnosed with metastatic 
disease, the 5-year survival rate is 30% (American Cancer Society 2021, Siegel 2021). 
Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer is predominantly characterised by bone pain, fatigue, 
and urinary dysfunction (Gater 2011). Bone is the predominant site of disseminated prostate cancer, 
and pain is the most common manifestation of bone metastases. Around 90% of patients with mCRPC 
have bone metastases, which leads to significant morbidity, including pain and skeletal-related events 
such as spinal cord compression and pathological fractures, which require interventions such as bone 
surgery or radiation therapy.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Prostate cancers are dependent on androgen-mediated signalling for their growth and survival. Thus, 
for many decades, initial treatment for metastatic prostate cancer has been surgical castration by 
bilateral orchiectomy or chemical castration with androgen deprivation therapy [ADT] (Crawford 1989, 
Eisenberger 1998, Sharifi 2010). Of note, androgen pathway inhibitors (i.e., abiraterone, enzalutamide 
or apalutamide) and docetaxel, in combination with ADT, have shown to be beneficial in this context. 
However, even if there is an initial benefit with ADT, resistance to ADT, inevitably occurs.  
Treatment options for patients with mCRPC include abiraterone acetate (plus prednisone or 
prednisolone) and enzalutamide for chemotherapy naïve patients who are asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic and in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated (ESMO 2020; NCCN 2022). For 
symptomatic patients or patients with signs of rapid progression or visceral metastases despite lack of 
symptoms, initial use of docetaxel may be preferred. The radionuclide radium-223 may be used in 
patients with bone-predominant symptomatic metastatic CRPC.  
Patients with HRR gene alterations who have not received therapy for mCRPC (first line treatment for 
mCRPC) are currently managed in the same manner as other patients with mCRPC who do not harbour 
an HRR alteration. The PARP pathway has been identified as a potential drug target in prostate cancers 
that have HRR gene alterations. In this context, poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase 
(PARP) inhibitors represent a novel, targeted therapeutic approach toward the treatment of men with 
prostate cancer and HRR gene alterations. 
Recently, two PARP inhibitors, olaparib and rucaparib, were approved for the treatment of men with 
mCRPC. Olaparib is approved for the treatment of mCRPC in patients with deleterious HRR mutations 
(US) or BRCA mutations (EU) who had progressed after prior treatment with enzalutamide or AAP and  
in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients 
with mCRPC  in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated. Rucaparib is approved, only in the US, 
for mCRPC patients with deleterious BRCA mutation who had received previous treatment with an AR-
targeted therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy.

2.2.  About the product 
Akeega is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of the individual drug substances niraparib and 
abiraterone acetate as film-coated tablets. 
Niraparib is an orally available, highly selective PARPi, with activity against PARP-1 and PARP-2 DNA-
repair polymerases. In vitro studies have shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve 
inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA 
damage, apoptosis and cell death. 
In the EU niraparib (Zejula) is approved as monotherapy for (1) the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer who are in response to platinum-based chemotherapy; and for (2) the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (International Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] Stages III and IV) high grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are in response following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Abiraterone acetate is a prodrug of abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor. Specifically, 
abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is 
expressed in and is required for androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumour 
tissues. CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone 
precursors, DHEA and androstenedione, respectively, by 17α-hydroxylation and cleavage of the C17,20 
bond. CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. 
In the EU abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) is approved with prednisone or prednisolone for (1) the 
treatment of newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in adult 
men in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); (2) the treatment of mCRPC in adult 
men who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of ADT in whom chemotherapy is not 
yet clinically indicated; and (3) the treatment of mCRPC in adult men whose disease has progressed on 
or after a docetaxel based chemotherapy regimen. 
The FDC is formulated in two strengths:

2.4.2.  Active substance 
The quality information for the active substances niraparib tosylate monohydrate and abiraterone 
acetate is mainly the same as the information provided in the previously approved marketing 
authorisation (MAs) for the mono-component products. The active substances information includes 
resubmission of data from the niraparib (Zejula) and abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) MAs. Changes to the 
active substances sections in the dossier compared to the active substance information in the 
previously approved mono-component MAs are highlighted in the dossier. 
Niraparib tosylate monohydrate 
General information 
The chemical name of niraparib tosylate monohydrate is 2-[4-(3S)-3-piperidinylphenyl]-2H-indazole-
7-carboxamide,4-methylbenzenesulfonate hydrate corresponding to the molecular formula 
C26H30N4O5S. It has a relative molecular mass of 510.61 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Niraparib tosylate monohydrate structure 
The chemical structure was elucidated by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(NMR), liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS), and single crystal X-ray crystallography 
with confirmatory data from elemental analysis, Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and 
ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by 
thermogravimetric-FTIR analysis (TGA-FTIR). 
Niraparib exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of a single chiral centre. The stereochemistry 
originates and is controlled in the synthesis. 
Niraparib tosylate monohydrate is a non-hygroscopic white to off white powder, highly soluble in 
aqueous media over the pH range from 1.2 – 6.8. It is classified as a class I compound according to 
the BCS. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 16/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Only one crystalline form is observed for niraparib tosylate monohydrate (designated as niraparib 
tosylate monohydrate Form 1. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Niraparib tosylate monohydrate is manufactured by two manufacturing sites. 
Niraparib tosylate monohydrate is synthesized in 6 main steps using two  commercially available, well 
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications The manufacturing process is fully described 
and is in line with the currently approved process for the mono-component product (Zejula). 1Based 
on the results of the comprehensive process development program conducted and process purging 
studies, stages have been designated as critical steps in the niraparib commercial process. Stages of 
the commercial process were shown to have no critical process parameters (CPPs) or in-process 
controls/critical in-process controls (IPCs/CIPCs) and are not considered critical steps. 
Genotoxic impurities may be generated from the proposed commercial process. The levels are well 
controlled by the process and it has been demonstrated that they are not a safety concern.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. There have been three slightly different variations of the same synthetic 
route to manufacture niraparib tosylate monohydrate active substance. The synthetic approaches for 
Processes I to III all employ the same carbon-carbon bond and carbon-hetero bond formation steps. 
The order of some chemical transformations has varied between processes, as has the selection of 
isolated intermediates. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been 
justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. Active 
substance batches manufactured using Process III were used in clinical studies, as primary stability 
batches, and for commercial product. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of traditional and enhanced 
approach to pharmaceutical development, in line with ICH Q11 Guideline. The early development work 
in establishing the commercial route for niraparib synthesis primarily used the traditional approach to 
screen and select reagents, solvents, catalysts, and reaction temperature, as well as to optimize the 
process for early stage production. When appropriate, an enhanced approach, such as the use of 
statistical design of experiment and one variable at a time (OVAT) studies has been conducted to 
understand the sensitivity of the process to various parameters and ensure that the process is robust 
across the defined normal operating ranges (NORs), proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and critical 
process parameters (CPPs). Although aspects of enhanced approach to pharmaceutical development 
have been used, no design space or regulatory flexibility is applied for. 
The active substance is packaged in a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) inner liner in an LDPE outer bag. 
Both liner and bag are appropriately closed and placed in a closed plastic drum. The container closure 
system  has  been  evaluated  in  ongoing  stability  studies  under  both  accelerated  (40  °C/75%  RH)  and 
long-term (25 °C/60% RH) storage conditions. The available stability data indicate that the container 
closure system is suitable to storage of niraparib tosylate monohydrate. All primary packaging material 
complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (FT-IR, HPLC), 
identification of toluene sulfonic acid  (HPLC), assay (HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), chiral 
purity (Chiral HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), 
particle size (laser diffraction), solid form (Ph. Eur.) and residue on ignition / sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.).   
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (n=49 pilot and commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, individual and total impurities, water 
content, chiral impurity, particle size, and solid form. The analytical methods used were the same as 
for release and were stability indicating.  
Samples from all active substance batches placed on stability at the long-term stability condition (25 
°C/60% RH) and the accelerated stability condition (40 °C/75% RH) remained within the commercial 
acceptance criteria for attributes at all timepoints tested. No apparent change occurred for any 
attribute during up to 48 months of storage at the long-term condition or during up to 6 months of 
storage at the accelerated condition. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 2 batches. No detectable 
degradation was observed for niraparib tosylate monohydrate exposed to light stress conditions over 
the duration of the study. 
Results as solid to heat, light and as solution to acid, base and hydrogen peroxide forced degradation 
conditions were provided.  None of the impurities observed during the forced degradation studies have 
been shown to increase during the accelerated, intermediate and long-term stability studies, using the 
same stability indicating method. These studies demonstrate the stability indicating nature of the HPLC 
method. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier(s) is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period without storage conditions in 
the proposed container.

Abiraterone acetate 
General information 
The chemical name of abiraterone acetate is (3β)-17-(3-pyridinyl) androsta-5,16-dien-3-yl acetate 
corresponding to the molecular formula C26H33NO2. It has a relative molecular weight of 391.55 and 
the following structure: 
Figure 2: Abiraterone acetate structure 
The chemical structure of abiraterone acetate was elucidated by a combination of high-resolution mass 
spectrometry (MS), elemental analysis, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) spectroscopy. Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy data is added only to complement the spectral data 
set. Optical rotation is added to demonstrate the chirality of the compound. 
Abiraterone acetate is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white powder practically insoluble in aqueous 
media over a wide range of pH values and very slightly soluble in 0.1 N HCl solution.  
Abiraterone acetate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 6 chiral centers (3S, 8R, 9S, 10R, 
13S, 14S) and 2 centers of geometrical isomerism (5Z and 16E). Abiraterone acetate is produced as a 
single enantiomer with its stereochemical elements introduced via the synthesis starting material 
acetate which is an enantiomerically pure material. The diastereomeric purity does not alter during the 
chemical synthesis. 
Polymorphism has been observed for abiraterone acetate. The majority of polymorph screening 
experiments resulted in Form A. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Abiraterone acetate is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
Abiraterone acetate is synthesized in 4 steps from one well defined starting material with acceptable 
specification. The critical steps and controls in the active substance manufacture have been identified 
taking into account critical quality attributes of the active substance and a pre-determined set of 
principles.  Process steps 1 to 3 were identified as being critical in terms of the impact on the impurity

profile. The fate of the impurities has been extensively investigated using spiking studies and was 
supported with data from a large number of batches. Critical process parameters are adequately 
defined and justified.  
2Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in an antistatic, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag that has been 
flushed with an inert gas and secured appropriately with a twist-tie or equivalent which complies with 
the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
Abiraterone acetate specification includes tests for  appearance (visual), identification (IR), assay 
(HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), palladium (ICP-
MS), residue on ignition / sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), and particle size (laser 
diffraction) 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (n=28 pilot and commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, water content and chromatographic purity. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
Available stability data indicate that abiraterone acetate remains stable during storage at the different 
storage conditions, when stored in the proposed container closure system. No stability related changes 
are observed in the assay values and no significant degradation is observed in any of the long-term 
storage and accelerated conditions. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. No detectable 
degradation was observed for abiraterone acetate exposed to light stress conditions over the duration 
of the study.  
A forced degradation study under extreme stress conditions was performed on the active substance in 
solution. The forced degradation study included testing the effects of photolysis, thermal oxidative, 
thermal acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions on the active substance. In addition, the study was 
EMA/126335/2023

conducted to demonstrate that the HPLC analytical purity method is stability indicating. The Stress In 
solution stability study shows that all major degradation products are separated from each other and 
none of them co-elute. The final HPLC test method is stability-indicating.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period without storage conditions in 
the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The strength 100 mg/500 mg is presented as orange, oval, film-coated tablets (22 mm x 11 mm), 
debossed with “N 100 A” on one side, and plain on the other side. 
The strength 50 mg/500 mg is presented as yellowish orange to yellowish brown, oval, film-coated 
tablets (22 mm x 11 mm), debossed with “N50 A” on one side, and plain on the other side. 
The aim of the finished product development was to combine niraparib and abiraterone acetate in an 
oral  fixed  dose  film-coated  tablet  that  is  bioequivalent  to  the  combined  administration  of  both 
commercially available single agent formulations i.e., niraparib 100 mg capsule and abiraterone acetate 
250 mg uncoated tablet. The rationale to develop a fixed-dose combination (FDC) instead of using two 
single component finished products was to reduce the pill burden. 
The  physicochemical  properties  of  the  active  substances  that  can  influence  the  performance  of  the 
finished product and its manufacturability () are identified and discussed.  
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards except Opadry which complies with In house specifications. There are no novel excipients used 
in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The  granulation process  were used as the starting point for the development of the FDC film-coated 
tablet. 
To avoid potential dust formation and to differentiate tablet formulations by color, a film-coat was applied 
to the tablets. 
The proposed QC dissolution method was optimized for medium pH, type and concentration of surfactant 
and the paddle rotation speed.Discriminatory power is sufficiently justified using batches with meaningful 
changes  compared  to  the  applied  finished  product:  particle  size  distribution  (PSD)  of  both  active 
substances, tablet hardness, stability changes and film-coating weight gain. 
Bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between the fixed-dose combination and 
the niraparib and abiraterone acetate co-administered as single agents at steady state under modified 
fasted conditions. 
A Quality by Design (QbD) approach is followed for the manufacturing process development. Finished 
product quality target product profile (QTPP) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) are defined following 
ICH  Q8  and  with  sufficient  justification.  A  risk  assessment  is  performed  in  order  to  establish  critical 
process parameters (CPPs) and their ranges; the risk assessment is not detailed, but is assured to be in 
line with ICH Q9. Critical control points (CCPs) are defined as control limits or ranges for a CPP, a CMA 
of an active substance or excipient, or a critical in-process control (CIPC). However, design space is not 
claimed by the applicant.

The  primary  packaging  is  PVdC/PE/PVC  foil  blister  with  an  aluminum  push-through  foil.  The  material 
complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site.The finished product is manufactured 
using  granulation of the niraparib tosylate monohydrate and abiraterone acetate as active substances, 
followed by blending with the extragranular excipients, compression, and film-coating 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  10  main  steps:  preparation  of  binder  solution,  preblending,  
granulation  and  drying,  screening,  initial  blending,  final  blending,  compression,  preparation  coating 
suspension, film coating and packaging.  
3 
Process  validation  data  are  not  provided.  However,  since  the  manufacturing  process  is  standard 
according  to  the  Annex  II  of  the  Guideline  on  process  validation,  this  can  be  accepted.  A  process 
validation scheme on three consecutive batches and according to the Annex I of this guideline has been 
presented for each strength. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identification active substances (HPLC, UV), assay active substances (HPLC), 
chromatography purity (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), dissolution of the active substances 
(Ph. Eur.), microbial purity (Ph. Eur.).  
 Taking  into  account  the  toxicologically  qualified  status,  the  acceptance  criterion  in  the  commercial 
niraparib tosylate monohydrate, and the limited release and stability data that are currently available, 
the proposed acceptance criterion is considered appropriate and adequately justified.   
Taking into account acceptance criteria for the impurities in the commercial active substance abiraterone 
acetate, the toxicological qualification levels, and the limited release and stability data that are currently 
available,  the  proposed  acceptance  criteria  for  these  impurities  are  considered  appropriate  and 
adequately justified.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity 
was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment it can be concluded 
that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for  testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for a number pilot and commercial scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches per strength of the finished product stored for up to 6 
months under 5 ºC, for up to 18  months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC/75%), 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) and for up 6 months under stress 
conditions (50 ºC)  according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the finished product 
are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  chromatographic  purity,  dissolution,  water  content,  and 
microbial purity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No substantial stability related changes were observed during storage of the drug product at the different 
storage conditions. All results are well within specification. The currently available stability data indicate 
that the  finished  product  is  chemically  and  physically  stable  under  light  ICH  conditions,  for  at  least  6 
months at 5 ºC, for at least 18 months at 25 °C/60% RH and 30 ºC/75% RH, for at least 6 months at 
40 ºC/75% RH, and for at least 3 months at 50 ºC upon storage in the proposed commercial packaging. 
Forced degradation studies under extreme stress conditions were performed to test the effects of thermal 
acidic,  thermal  alkaline  oxidative,  neutral,  dry  heat,  humid  heat,  and  metal  ions    conditions  on  the 
finished product in solution, as well as the effect of light on the solid finished product as per ICH Q1B 
Guideline.  These  studies  were  also  conducted  to  demonstrate  that  the  finished  product  UHPLC 
chromatographic purity methods are stability indicating. 
The finished product is stable under neutral, heat, heat/humidity and metal ions conditions. The finish 
product  is  prone  to  minor  degradation  under  oxidative  conditions  and  when  exposed  to  light  at  ICH 
conditions. The finished product is unstable under acidic and alkaline conditions. 
In conclusion, the UHPLC test methods are specific and stability indicating and are suitable for analysis 
of stability samples. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months without storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The combination of niraparib/abiraterone acetate (AA) is presented as a fixed-dose combination (200 
mg/1000 mg, respectively), in which the monotherapies have been previously characterized in their 
original MAA (EMEA/H/C/004249 and EMEA/H/C002321). 
From a non-clinical point of view, the Applicant based the development of this FDC on the preclinical 
data generated for the monocomponents. In line with ICH S9 guidance, only two additional nonclinical 
pharmacology studies were conducted with the combination. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics of niraparib from approved package showed the inhibition of PARP-1 and 
PARP-2 in the nanomolar range. In the case of abiraterone, in vitro studies showed the inhibition of 
CYP17αhydroxylase. 
In vivo combination studies 
With regards to the combination of niraparib (PARP inhibitor) and abiraterone acetate (androgen 
biosynthesis inhibitor), the Applicant conducted two in vivo studies conducted in two xenograft tumor 
models (BRCA1/2 wild type VCaP and BRCA2 mutant LuCaP).

Xenograft model in Mice

The anti-tumour efficacy of the combination (with AA) and niraparib alone was investigated in the 
BRCA2-wt VCaP xenograft model (DD18026 study). VCaP tumours harbour no known mutations in 
homologous recombination genes. The results of the study revealed that niraparib/AA combination 
inhibited tumour growth and increased survival compared with animals dosed either agent as 
monotherapy (Figure 3).

Tumours on Tumour Volume (left) and Survival (right) 
•

Bearing BRCA2 Mutant Prostate Cancer Xenografts 
The other in vivo study combination was conducted in the LuCaP 174.1 BRCA2-mutant PDX model 
(DD21076 study). Treatment with niraparib induced 89% TGI at Week 5, compared with the vehicle 
control group. At week 9.5, niraparib treatment resulted in sustained tumour regressions in 10 of 10 
mice and induced at least 58% ILS and a significant increase in survival (p=0.0002) compared with the 
control group. This study demonstrates that in certain, highly sensitive BRCA2 deficient models, 
niraparib has potent single-agent anti-tumour efficacy. 
In LuCaP 96 CR BRCA2-mutant PDX, niraparib and AA were tested alone or in combination. Over the 
course of the study, tumours in the vehicle control group grew progressively, more slowly in the 
niraparib or AA groups, and in the combination group remained static or decreased in volume (Figure 
4, left). Survival after 7.5 weeks of treatment indicated that niraparib and AA treatments each induced 
an ILS of 100% compared with the control group. All 10 mice in the niraparib + AA treatment group 
survived to the end of the study, for an ILS of at least 150% and a significant increase in survival 
(p<0.0001) compared with the vehicle control group (Figure 4).

mutant Tumours (left) and Survival (right) 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic assays for niraparib as monotherapy have been previously analysed in 
the original dossier. Initial in vitro studies showed a potential action of niraparib on brain monoamines 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 25/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(dopamine and norepinephrine). Follow-up studies revealed that niraparib did not occupy DAT in 
striatum (PET study) at relevant exposure levels. In a second in vivo study, niraparib did not exert a 
psychostimulant effect on mice. No secondary pharmacodynamics assays for abiraterone acetate were 
conducted, which is supported due to the selectivity and mechanism of action proposed.  
Regarding the combination, no secondary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted, which is in line 
with ICH S9 and guideline on the non-clinical development of fixed-dose combinations of medicinal 
products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted separately, and no combination study was carried out. 
This is in line with guideline ICH S9. Summary of safety pharmacology for single agents is provided 
below. 
Niraparib 
In vitro cardiovascular safety 
In a GLP-compliant hERG (human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene) assay, (3000-09-004), hERG current 
inhibition was 11.0% at 3 μM, 37.9% at 10 μM, 69.3% at 30 μM, and 91.4% at 100 μM versus 0.78% 
using vehicle control. The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of niraparib tosylate monohydrate on hERG 
potassium current was 15.2 μM. 
In vivo cardiovascular safety 
In a non-GLP study in anesthetised dogs (TT-07-5300), niraparib (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) increased the 
heart rate in a dose-dependent fashion (+5%, +9%, and +17%). A dose-independent increase 
(+16%, +21%, or 20%) in mean arterial pressure was observed from 1 mg/kg. There was no effect on 
QT/QTc, blood flow or PR up to and including the highest dose of 10 mg/kg (peak average plasma 
concentration measured during infusion in dogs was 15.3 μM). 
In a GLP study in conscious telemeterized beagle dogs (3, 6, and 15 mg/kg of niraparib), no changes 
were noted in heart rate, pulse pressure, ECG parameters (PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals), or body 
temperature up to 24 hours post-dose. When adjusted for baseline, a statistically significant increase 
in blood pressure (mean arterial pressure, systolic pressure, and diastolic pressure) was noted in 
female dogs at 15 mg/kg. For male dogs, a statistically significant increase was observed only in 
systolic pressure at the interval of 4 to 5 hours post-dose. 
In the 1-month and 3-month GLP toxicity studies in dogs, niraparib was administered at the highest 
doses of 15 and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively. No drug-related ECG abnormalities were observed. 
Central Nervous System Safety 
Niraparib (100 mg/kg single dose) had no effect in mice on neurological function, including general 
behaviour, neural reflexes, or spontaneous activity during the 24-h post-dose period and no effect on 
thermoregulation (TT-07-5362, non-GLP).  
Single oral administration of niraparib at doses of 5, 10, and 30 mg/kg to male and female rats had no 
effect on any qualitative and quantitative FOB parameters up to 24 h post-dose (6901661, GLP).  
Respiratory Safety 
No niraparib-related (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg) effects were noted on any of the respiratory parameters 
(tidal volume, respiratory rate, and derived minute volume) up to 24 hours post-dose (6901248, GLP). 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 26/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Abiraterone Acetate 
In Vitro Cardiovascular Safety 
Abiraterone inhibited the hERG potassium current at 10 and 27 μM by 2% and 6%, respectively. Due 
to this modest level of inhibition at the highest concentration, which was close to the limits of solubility 
for the compound, the IC50 for abiraterone could not be determined. Abiraterone acetate inhibited the 
hERG potassium current at 1.3, 3, 10 and 27 μM by 2, 10, 38 and 84%, respectively. The IC50 for the 
inhibitory effect of AA on hERG potassium current was 12.2 μM (071018.DPC). 
In Vivo Cardiovascular Safety 
The administration of AA at dose levels up to 2,000 mg/kg had no effect on the hemodynamic and the 
electrocardiographic intervals (RR, PR, QRS, QT and QTc) in male cynomolgus monkeys following a 24-
h monitoring period. In addition, no overt arrhythmias/abnormalities were found on inspection of the 
ECG tracings over the 24-h recording period (692409, GLP). 
Central Nervous System Safety 
Behavioural assessment in rats (TOX9587, GLP) revealed a slight decrease in alertness and a 
decreased pinna reflex at 40 and 400 mg/kg. Peak observations were observed at 3 h post-dosing on 
Day 0 and absent at the 24-h post-dosing observation. In addition, a slight increase in incidence for 
reacting to touch escape was noticed at 400 mg/kg at 24 hours post-dosing. There were no neurologic 
or autonomic abnormalities and no signs of general toxicity. The observed behavioural changes noticed 
at 40 and 400 mg/kg were considered of minor clinical relevance.  
Respiratory Safety 
Lower tidal volume was observed in rats given 750 mg/kg but not in animals dosed at 2,000 mg/kg. 
No other significant changes in respiratory parameters were observed (8210847, GLP). 
Gastric Irritation 
There were no treatment-related effects in the gastrointestinal tract and the internal viscera in male 
mice administered AA at 800 mg/kg at gross observations (1632-1, GLP). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The potential PD interactions are shown in the primary pharmacodynamics section (in vivo combination 
studies). 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The non-clinical PK package presented for this procedure relied on the documentation previously 
assessed for the approval of the single agents. Assessment for the combination was made based on 
the review of metabolism, enzymes/transporters involved in the metabolism or disposition and in vitro 
drug-drug interaction potential of individual single agents.  
The analytical methods for non-clinical study samples were previously assessed in the individual 
dossiers, in line with Guideline on bioanalytical methods validation (EMA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 
Rev. 1 Corr. 2).  
Consistent with guideline on non-clinical development of fixed combinations of medicinal products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005), the applicant has submitted non-clinical studies, ADME-related 
EMA/126335/2023

parameters and data for mono-components of the FDC. These data were previously assessed in the 
original dossiers, and no further assessment is considered necessary.  
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of the combination was based on the previous studies conducted with the 
individual components. In line with ICH S9 guidance, no combination toxicology studies is required for 
the proposed FDC. Previous findings are summarized below.  
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No  single  dose  studies  were  conducted  with  niraparib.  No  mortality  was  observed  after  single  dose 
administration of abiraterone acetate in mice or rats up to 2000 mg/Kg or 400 mg/kg, respectively. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Niraparib: the target organs of toxicity reported were bone marrow (hypocellularity, decrease of RBC, 
WBC and platelets) and testes (hypospermatogenesis considered as a pharmacological effect of PARP 
inhibition).  They  were  observed  in  both  rat  and  dog  species,  in  a  dose-dependent  fashion  and  were 
reversible  after  a  free-drug  period.  Other  toxicological  findings  noted  in  rats  were  cardiac  arterial 
hypertrophy and an increased amount of trabecula in the bone, without reversibility. NOAEL values were 
established at 10 mg/kg/day and 4.5 mg/kg/day for rats and dogs, respectively. 
AA: the most significant findings were attributed to the interference of steroid metabolism (androgen 
biosynthesis inhibitor), producing toxicity in reproductive system, adrenal glands, liver, pituitary (rats 
only), and male mammary glands. Also, RBC parameter was affected in studies in mice and rats, with 
evidence of extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen in mice, although no microscopic changes were 
correlated in bone marrow. In this regard, haematological changes were also observed in monkeys. Liver 
of the nonclinical species was also affected in long-term toxicity studies, and the findings were not fully 
reversed after a 4-week recovery period. Similarly, cataracts were observed in chronic studies in rats 
(potential species-specific effect cannot be ruled out), which were not considered reversible.  
Overlapping toxicities from the individual components were identified, namely effects on testes and RBC. 
In  terms  of  interspecies  comparison,  safety  margins  of  the  FDC  were  presented  on  the  base  of  the 
individual data for monotherapies.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Niraparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) test but was clastogenic in 
an in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration assay and in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus 
assay. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the primary 
pharmacology of niraparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in humans. AA and abiraterone was 
without genotoxic potential in a standard battery of studies. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenic studies were performed with niraparib.  
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 28/196 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
A six-month carcinogenicity study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse and a 2-year carcinogenicity 
study in rat were conducted with AA. These studies were submitted and assessed in a previous 
procedure for AA (EMEA/H/C/002321/II/0012). A brief summary of both studies is presented below. 
In Tg.rasH2 mice (TOX10088), AA was administered orally (gavage) once daily for 6 months at 0 
(vehicle), 125, 375 or 750 mg/kg/day (25/sex/group).Treatment of Tg.rasH2 mice with AA at daily oral 
doses up to 750 mg/kg for 6 months did not increase the incidence of neoplastic lesions. 
In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Crl:CD(SD) rats (TOX9619), AA was administered orally (gavage) 
once daily for 2 years (65/sex/group) at 0 (demineralized water), 0 (vehicle), 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg/day 
for male rats, and 0 (demineralized water), 0 (vehicle), 15, 50 or 150 mg/kg/day for female rats. 
Histopathological examination revealed an increase in the incidence of testicular interstitial (Leydig) 
cell adenomas in all test article-treated male groups; in addition, two males given 50 mg/kg/day and 
one male given 15 mg/kg/day had testicular interstitial cell carcinomas.  
Oral administration of AA to rats for 2 years was associated with an increase in the incidence of 
testicular interstitial (Leydig) cell adenomas in all treated male groups and with interstitial cell 
carcinomas in 1 and 2 rats at 15 and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively. These findings were a sequential 
response of the pharmacological action of the test article, which inhibits testosterone production, and 
are considered rat-specific as the interstitial cells of rats possess significantly higher number of LH 
receptors than humans (Alison 1994 and Clegg 1997). The occurrence of testicular tumours had no 
impact on overall survival in treated male groups. Overall survival was higher than vehicle control for 
all treated female groups and there was a concomitant dose-dependent reduction in the incidence of 
pituitary adenomas and mammary tumours. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive toxicology studies were performed with niraparib. Given the potential teratogenicity 
and foetal mortality because of its mechanism of action (inhibition of PARP-1 and PARP-2), the absence 
of these studies with niraparib is justified and in line with ICH S9.   
In male rats, AA administration revealed effects on male fertility (reduced organ weights of the 
reproductive system, sperm counts, sperm motility, altered sperm morphology and decreased fertility), 
with reversibility observed after 16 weeks recovery. In female rats, AA caused increased incidence of 
irregular or extended estrous cycles and pre-implantation loss. No differences in mating, fertility, and 
litter parameters were observed. Effects were reversible after 4 weeks from the last AA administration. 
Findings in fertility are consistent with pharmacological activity (anti-androgenic effect).  
In an embryo-foetal development study in rats, AA had adverse developmental effects on foetuses 
(increased post implantation loss and resorptions and decreased number of live foetuses; foetal 
developmental delay; decreased foetal body weight; and decreased foetal ano-genital distance).  
In a non-GLP study in juvenile rats, AA findings were consistent with those observed in adult animals 
(histopathological changes in the liver, pituitary, ovaries, and the male reproductive tract of the 
juvenile rats). Sexual maturation was also affected in males. It is noted that the effects observed were 
attributed to the androgen inhibition.

2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance (oral gavage) studies were conducted with niraparib. In the case of AA, no 
treatment-related effects were reported in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. 
2.5.5.  Other Toxicity studies  
The major metabolites of niraparib and AA were identified in nonclinical species and can be considered 
as evaluated in the studies conducted. Information for qualified impurities was also included in the 
non-clinical part. 
Additional toxicity studies were performed with the mono-components of the FDC. In the case of 
mechanistic assay, AA administration resulted in decreased testosterone levels and increased in LH 
levels, which are in line with the pharmacological activity of AA. Also, the potential phototoxicity of 
niraparib and AA were investigated, and the results indicated no evidence for cutaneous or ocular 
phototoxicity

2.5.7.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
This is a FDC of niraparib and AA in which individual components are already approved in the EU. The 
Applicant has designed the strategy for this MAA based on ICH S9, in which no additional studies with 
the combination are required.  
In this context, the only new non-clinical studies submitted in the nonclinical part of the dossier have 
been two PD studies. Based on these studies the combination showed decreasing tumour volumes and 
increasing survival with the combination as compared with single-agent treatments in BRCA-related 
tumour models (BRCA1 and BRCA2 wild type VCaP and BRCA2 mutant LuCaP).  
By referring to literature data and in vivo data showing effect of niraparib and other PARP inhibitors on 
HRD mutated, wt-BRCA models (not comprising prostate), it is suggested that niraparib may provide 
clinical benefit to prostate cancer patients with BRCA-1- and BRCA-2-mutation positive, and BRCA 
wild-type, HRD positive tumors. However, while additive effects of niraparib and abiraterone acetate 
were demonstrated in an animal model with BRCA2 mutation positive castrate resistant prostate 
tumours, no data have been presented supporting beneficial effect of the combination in castrate 
resistant tumour models harbouring other HR mutations than BRCA2. Thus, while the nonclinical data 
have demonstrated pharmacodynamic effects of niraparib and abiraterone on mCRPC with BRCA 
mutations, there are no nonclinical data supportive of effect on mCRPC with non-BRCA mutations. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 33/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
It is noted that proposed dose levels of each component do not exceed the maximum approved dose 
levels given as monotherapy in clinical practice. Safety margins of the FDC were presented on the base 
of the individual data for monotherapies, which is considered adequate given the absence of potential 
interactions between the mono-components of the combination. No major clinical DDIs are expected 
between the two mono-components. Primary metabolic pathways involved in the metabolism of 
niraparib and AA are mediated by esterases with subsequent metabolism via phase II enzymatic 
pathways (glucuronidation or sulfate conjugation). For both drugs, CYPs pathways play a minimal role 
in the metabolic elimination and are unlikely to be induced or inhibited by major CYP DDIs. Drug 
transporter substrate and inhibition profiles suggests unlikely interaction between the two drugs. 
Considering the mechanism of actions proposed for niraparib and AA (PARP inhibition and CYP17 
inhibition), the combination niraparib/AA could affect fertility. This is also indicated by findings in 
animal studies where niraparib-related decreased spermatogenesis was observed in both rats and 
dogs, and AA reduced male fertility was observed in rats.  This is adequately addressed in SmPC 
sections 4.6 and 5.3.  
Considering that mono-components are well characterized, and given that both are approved in the 
EU, no further assessment has been considered necessary from a non-clinical point of view. 
ERA 
Niraparib is considered to be very persistent (vP), but it is considered to be a not-PBT and not-vPvB 
substance. The BCF values for abiraterone acetate have been revised and updated to 903 (low dose) 
and 931 (high dose), and Abiraterone Acetate is still considered to be a non-bioaccumulative 
substance.  
Niraparib and Abiraterone DT50 Persistence values have been normalised to 12 ºC using Arrhenius 
Equation to reflect environmental temperatures in Europe. Niraparib final values of DT50 remain over 
the 180 days triggering threshold (according to REACH Annex XIII Criteria), so Niraparib is still 
considered to be a very persistent substance. Updated Abiraterone final values of DT50 remain below 
the corresponding triggering thresholds (40 days for water and total system and 120 days for soil 
compartment, according to REACH Annex XIII), so it is still considered to be a non-persistent 
substance. 
For niraparib, a Phase I and Phase II Tier A-Tier B analysis (for toxicity study with sediment-dwelling 
organisms) was carried out and all risk quotients were below the threshold values. 
Regarding abiraterone acetate, a Phase I and Phase II Tier A-Tier B were carried out. All risk quotients 
were under the triggering threshold except the surface water one, which was above 1 (8.23 µg/L).  
Considering the above data, niraparib tosylate monohydrate and its metabolites are not considered to 
pose a risk for the environment, but abiraterone acetate and/or its metabolites may represent a risk to 
the organism population in aquatic environment, following prescribed usage in patients.  
2.5.8.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of Akeega (niraparib/AA) have been summarised in this document.  
Considering that mono-components are well characterized and given that both niraparib and 
abiraterone Acetate are approved in the EU, only two new PD studies were submitted in the nonclinical 
part of the dossier, and no further assessment is considered necessary from a non-clinical point of 
view. Overall, the nonclinical part of the dossier is considered approvable. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 34/196 
 
 
  
 
 
Based on the ERA, abiraterone acetate and/or its metabolites may represent a risk to the organism 
population in aquatic environment, therefore, abiraterone acetate should be used according to the 
current precautions stated in the SmPC to minimise any potential risks to the environment.

1In MAGNITUDE Cohort 2, results from a pre-specified futility analysis suggested no clinical benefit, and no further 
patients were subsequently enrolled. In total, 247 subjects were randomized, and 246 subjects were treated. 
2QUEST is set up as a platform-like study to evaluate different combination regimens with niraparib. Other niraparib 
combination regimens in the QUEST and BEDIVERE studies are not part of the MAA, so are not included in the table. 
3In BA/BE Study, up to 120 subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure at least 96 subjects evaluable for BE. 
4In QUEST Combination 3 and the BA/BE Study, entry criteria allowed previous treatment for mCRPC and only limited 
safety data was collected in the Extension (SAEs in QUEST Combination 3; SAEs, grade 3 or higher AEs, AEs leading 
to dose modification and withdrawal in the BA/BE Study). 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  clinical  pharmacology  program  for  the  FDC  (fixed-dose  combination)  of  niraparib/  abiraterone 
acetate (AA) plus prednisone is based on the development of the two single agents used in combination. 
Pharmacokinetics  (PK)  bridging  from  the  SAC  (single-agent  combination)  to  the  FDC  tablets  were 
submitted to support the approval of niraparib/AA FDC plus prednisone for the treatment of adults who 
have progressed to mCRPC and are positive for HRR gene alterations. 
The FDC biopharmaceutic development program consisted of: 
−  an  initial  relative  BA  study  (QUEST  Combination  3)  in  which  two  different  fixed-dose 
formulations FDC1 (FDC1-RS and LS) and FDC2 (FDC2-RS) were tested 
−  a formal BE study for FDC-RS and relative BA for FDC-LS (BA/BE Study) 
−  an in silico evaluation of BE for the FDC-LS tablets. 
Additionally, subjects were dosed in a separate cohort of the Phase 3 Study MAGNITUDE to gain clinical 
experience with the FDC-RS and FDC-LS tablet formulations. 
Niraparib RP2D (recommended Phase 2 dose) when administered in combination with an AR-targeted 
therapy was investigated in a phase 1b dose-escalation study (BEDIVERE). Other analyses included a 
population  PK  (PopPK)  analysis  based  on  data  pooled  from  the  five  clinical  studies  (Table  19)  in  the 
mCRPC population and an exposure-response (E-R) analysis based on the primary efficacy and selected 
safety endpoints of the pivotal Phase 3 study (MAGNITUDE). 
In addition to the above studies clinical pharmacology studies conducted as part of the registration 
package of the respective monotherapy submissions for niraparib and AA, were also included in this 
submission to provide comprehensive clinical pharmacology package for the niraparib/AA FDC. 
Analytical Methods: Bioanalytical methods were developed and validated to support the 
quantification of niraparib, major niraparib metabolite M1, AA, and abiraterone in plasma 
Absorption  
Niraparib 
Study PR-30-5015-C: based on the results from in vitro using bidirectional cell permeability assays in 
Caco-2 cells and LLC-PK1 cells, niraparib was predicted to be a highly permeable drug with limited efflux 
transport. Niraparib showed relatively high oral absolute BA (F approximately 73%) after administration 
of a single oral dose of 300 mg niraparib given as 3×100 mg capsules in subjects with cancer.  
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 37/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Absolute BA for a 200 mg dose is not available. However, up to a dose of 200 mg, due to its high solubility 
and  permeability,  niraparib  is  considered  to  be  a  biopharmaceutical  classification  system  Class  I 
compound and the PK of niraparib is approximately dose proportional (study PN001), thus the absolute 
BA is predicted to be similar at a 200 mg dose. Following oral dosing, the tmax occurs within 5 hours. 
Abiraterone 
In vitro, both abiraterone and AA were found to have low apparent permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers 
and not to be substrates of P-gp. Based on its low solubility and permeability, AA is a biopharmaceutical 
classification  system  Class  IV  compound.  These  physicochemical  properties  of  AA  and  the  rapid 
conversion to abiraterone systemically, resulted in comparable plasma abiraterone concentration-time 
profiles across studies when given alone or in combination with niraparib. 
Abiraterone is rapidly absorbed. The absolutely bioavailability is not known, although the bioavailability 
from the commercial tablet in the fasted state is unlikely to be higher than 10%, as the bioavailability 
can be increased by 10-fold in the fed state. 
Influence of food 
No formal food effect study with the FDC tablets was conducted. 
Niraparib 
Based on results from the food effect study of niraparib as single agent (Study PR-30-5011-C2-FE), 
food has no clinically relevant effect on niraparib BA and thus can be taken with or without food. 
Abiraterone 
Food 
increases 
the  BA  of  abiraterone 
(Studies  COU-AA-009,  212082PCR1005,  and 
212082PCR2008) and thus AA is recommended to be administered under modified fasting conditions 
(SmPC section 4.2). 
Distribution 
Niraparib 
In the ADME Study PR-30-5015-C after administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg niraparib given 
as  3×100  mg  capsules  in  subjects  with  cancer,  the  Vd/F  was  1,220  L,  indicating  an  extensive  tissue 
distribution of niraparib. In the PopPK analysis of niraparib in the combination with AA, the central and 
peripheral  Vd/F  were  386 and  731  L,  respectively  in  subjects  with  mCRPC.  Niraparib  was  moderately 
protein bound to human plasma (83.0%) in vitro.  
Abiraterone acetate 
The  plasma protein  binding  of  14C-abiraterone in  human  plasma  is 98.8% to  99.9%  (in  vitro  studies 
8202266, FK7603, FK7448). Based on popPK analysis (abiraterone as single agent), the central and 
peripheral  Vd/F  were  5,630  L  and  17400  L,  suggesting  that  abiraterone  extensively  distributes  to 
peripheral tissues. In the PopPK analysis of abiraterone when given in combination with niraparib, the 
central and peripheral Vd/F were 7,052 L and 18,722 L, respectively in subjects with mCRPC. 
Elimination 
Niraparib 
In the ADME Study PR-30-5015-C after administration of a single oral dose of 300 mg 14C-radioactive 
niraparib  given  as  3×100  mg  capsules  in  six  subjects  with  cancer,  a  mean  measured  total  of  86.2% 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 38/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
(range: 71.1-91.0%) of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and faecal samples collected daily 
from 0 to 504 hours (21 days) post-dose. Total radioactivity recovered in the urine accounted for 47.5% 
(range:  33.4-60.2%)  and  in  the  faeces  for  38.8%  (range:  28.3-47.0%)  of  the  dose.  Therefore,  the 
overall recovery in the excreta following the continuous collection up to 21 days was virtually complete, 
suggestive  of  minimal  long-term  retention  of  niraparib  or  its  metabolites.  Moreover,  hepatobiliary 
clearance and renal excretion are the major routes of elimination in humans. 
Abiraterone 
Following oral administration of 14C-AA, approximately 88% of the radioactive dose was recovered in 
faeces and approximately 5% in urine (study COU-AA-007). The major compounds present in faeces 
were  unchanged  AA  and  abiraterone  (approximately  55%  and  22%  of  the  administered  dose, 
respectively). The mean t1/2 of abiraterone in plasma was approximately 15 hours based on data from 
healthy subjects. The average t½ of abiraterone when given in combination with niraparib, calculated 
based  on  PopPK  based  estimated  values  of  clearance,  intercompartmental  clearance,  and  central  and 
peripheral  volume  of  distribution,  was  approximately  19.7  hours  in  subjects  with  mCRPC,  which  is 
consistent with observed t1/2 of abiraterone monotherapy. 
•  Metabolism 
Data  generated  regarding  the  metabolism  of  niraparib  and  abiraterone,  when  niraparib  and  AA  were 
administered as monotherapy, were used to support the niraparib/AA combination. No new studies of 
metabolism were conducted during the development of the combination. 
Niraparib 
Niraparib is metabolised primarily via the amide hydrolysis pathway, catalysed by carboxylesterases to 
form a major inactive metabolite (M1), followed by the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases-
mediated glucuronidation and the other minor secondary pathway (ie, methylation). Exposure to M1 in 
plasma  appears  to  be  comparable  to  that  of  the  parent  compound  with  terminal  elimination  half-life 
(t1/2) analogous to that of the parent. 
Abiraterone 
Following  oral  administration  of  14C-AA  as  capsules,  AA  is  hydrolysed  to  abiraterone,  which  then 
undergoes  metabolism  including  sulfation,  hydroxylation,  and  oxidation  primarily  in  the  liver.  The 
majority of circulating radioactivity (approximately 92%) is found as abiraterone and its metabolites. Of 
15 detectable metabolites, there are two main metabolites (inactive), abiraterone sulfate and N-oxide 
abiraterone sulfate, each representing approximately 43% of total radioactivity. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Niraparib 
Niraparib exhibited linear PK and dose-proportional exposure (AUC and Cmax). Moreover, the consistent 
tmax  and  t1/2  across  the  range  of  doses  evaluated  (30-400  mg)  suggest  overall  dose  independent 
absorption and clearance. Following repeat administrations of the daily recommended dose of 300 mg, 
niraparib accumulation on Day 21 was consistent for both AUC and Cmax (approximately 2 folds) (Study 
PN001). 
Abiraterone 
Comparison  of  abiraterone  exposure  after  administration  of  the  500  mg  and  250  mg  doses  to  the 
reference  dose  of  1,000  mg  showed  that  abiraterone  exposure  was  slightly  greater  than  dose 
proportional (Study COA-AA-016). 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 39/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Bioequivalence 
Bioequivalence  of  the  100/500  mg  niraparib/AA  FDC  tablet  to  the  SAC  is  supported  by  Study 
67652000PCR1001 (hereafter referred to as BA/BE Study).  
Bioequivalence  of  the  50/500  mg  Tablet  to  the  SAC  is  claimed  by  the  results  from  the  relative  BA 
assessments  and  additional  analyses  comparing  FDC-LS  to  SAC  in  the  BA/BE  Study  as  well  as 
supplemental in silico BE studies based on a PopPK model. 
Initial relative BA study, Niraparib plus AA (64091742PCR2002, QUEST Combination 3) 
Study QUEST was a Phase 1b-2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate niraparib in combination with 
other anticancer agents in subjects with mCRPC with or without HRR gene alterations. 
Combination 3 of this study was a partly randomised (Cohort 1 only), parallel group study to determine 
the PK and safety of three FDC tablet formulations of niraparib plus AA in 68 subjects with mCRPC.  
The primary objective was to determine the relative BA of two FDC-RS tablet formulations of niraparib 
and  AA  compared  with  niraparib  and  AA  co-administered  as  SAC  under  fasting  conditions  in  subjects 
with mCRPC. A secondary objective was to evaluate the PK of a FDC-LS tablet formulation. 
Serial blood samples were collected at pre-dose and up to 168h post-dose. Study design and results are 
given in the Tables below. 
Overall, given the comparable niraparib exposures seen with FDC1-RS and FDC2-RS but higher 
abiraterone exposures for FDC2-RS compared to FDC1-RS, the FDC1 (RS and LS) formulation was 
chosen for further clinical development.

•  Niraparib plus AA (67652000PCR1001, BA/BE Study) 
Study design 
This was an open-label, randomised, multi-centre study with a sequential design to assess the BE of a 
regular-strength (RS) FDC tablet formulation of niraparib/AA versus the single agent combination 
(SAC) formulation of niraparib and AA at steady state and to assess the relative BA of a low-strength 
(LS) FDC tablet formulation of niraparib/AA versus the SAC formulation of niraparib and AA after single 
dose administration in subjects with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Objective and endpoints 
Table 8: Objectives and Endpoints (Study 67652000PCR1001) 
Statistical approaches to establish BE 
The primary PK parameters for the statistical analysis were Cmax,ss and AUC0-24h,ss. 
A linear mixed-effect model that included treatment, period, and treatment sequence as fixed effects, 
and subject within sequence as a random effect, was used to estimate the least square means and 
intrasubject variance. Data were log-transformed prior to analysis. Point estimates and 90% CIs for 
the GMRs of Cmax,ss and AUC0-24h,ss between the test (Treatment D) and reference (Treatment B) 
formulations for niraparib and abiraterone were obtained. As a secondary analysis, an ANOVA model 
that included treatment, period, sequence, and subject within sequence as fixed effects was applied in 
the statistical analysis for the BE assessment. No random effect was included in this model.  
Statistical Analysis of Relative BA 
The  primary  PK  parameters  for  statistical  analysis  were  Cmax  and  AUC0-72h  of  niraparib  and 
abiraterone.  An  ANOVA  model  with  treatment  as  fixed  effect  was  applied  to  the  log-transformed  PK 
parameters and the results were presented in original scale after antilog transformation. 
Additional Paired Data Analysis to Assess the Comparability of Abiraterone Exposures between the FDC-
LS and SAC Formulation 
To further assess the relative BA of the FDC-LS formulation versus SAC within the same subjects, based 
on  the  high  inter-subject  variability  observed  for  FDC-LS  in  the  initial  analysis,  comparing  exposures 
between  Treatment  groups  C  and  A,  an  additional  subgroup  analysis  using  single  sequence  data 
(extracted data for Treatments C and B based on treatment sequences CBD and CDB) was performed 
for abiraterone as abiraterone PK at the dose of 1,000 mg is shown to be linear and stationary. 
For Cmax comparison, since Treatment C was a single-dose design, abiraterone Cmax,ss for this group 
was calculated using nonparametric superposition method and popPK model derived accumulation ratios. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 46/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
For AUC comparison abiraterone AUC0-∞ was calculated for Treatment C, which was compared with the 
observed AUC0-24h,ss from Treatment B. 
A linear mixed-effect model that included treatment as fixed effect and subject as a random effect was 
used to estimate the least square means and intrasubject variance. The point estimate and 90% CIs for 
the GMRs of Cmax,ss and AUC (AUC0-∞ for Treatment C and AUC0-24h,ss for Treatment B) between 
the test (Treatment C) and reference (Treatment B) formulations for abiraterone were obtained.

The inter-subject variabilities (%CV) in the PK parameters for Cmax and AUC0-72h were 80.4% and 
72.9%, respectively. 
Based  on  the  90%  CIs  of  single  dose  Cmax  and  AUC0-72h  for  niraparib  and  abiraterone,  the  FDC-LS 
formulation did not meet the BE criteria versus the reference SAC formulation for niraparib Cmax and

Based on the additional paired analysis, 90% CI of the GMRs for estimated abiraterone Cmax,ss and 
AUC (AUC0-∞ for FDC-LS or AUC0-24h,ss for SAC) between FDC-LS and SAC were within the 80.00% 
to 125.00% BE criteria (Table below).

In silico BE assessment for the FDC-LS 
PopPK simulations of 1000 replicates of the BA/BE study design (conducted as a 2-way steady state 
cross-over PK assessment phase in Periods 2 and 3, ie, the BE assessment phase for FDC versus SAC) 
with a sample size of N=120 were performed. The Day 11 and Day 22 individual exposure parameters 
AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss for FDC-LS and/or SAC for both niraparib and abiraterone were calculated 
from the simulated data using NCA. The probability of demonstrating BE for FDC-LS compared with 
SAC was calculated as the proportion of simulated clinical trial replicates in which BE criteria (90% CI 
of estimated GMR within the 80% to 125% range) were met for both AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss for 
both niraparib and abiraterone. 
The abiraterone pre-final PPK model, which included effects of FDC-LS on KA (20% decrease versus 
SAC) and D1 (34% decrease versus SAC) was used for the simulated BE assessment of FDC-LS. BE 
criteria would simultaneously be met in 96.4% for all four exposure parameters.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Population PK analysis 
PK  modelling  was  performed  using  Nonlinear  mixed-effects  modelling  software  NONMEM  (ICON  plc, 
Version 7.3) and the first-order conditional estimation with interaction estimation method. The PopPK 
analysis  was  based  on  9935  niraparib  plasma  PK  samples  from  916  subjects  and  6289  abiraterone 
plasma PK samples from 954 subjects, obtained in the five clinical studies described in the Table below.

Niraparib PPK model 
A PPK model of niraparib, previously developed in subjects with ovarian cancer (TESA-PMX-
NIRAPARIB-1391, dated 02.09.2019), was used as the starting point for structural model 
development on the current analysis dataset. The effects of FDC-RS and -LS formulations compared 
with single-agent niraparib capsule formulation were introduced on the absorption parameters KA, D1, 
and F1 in the base model prior to covariate testing. The final niraparib model is given below.

Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
There  is  no  formal  study  of  niraparib/AA  combo  (as  SAC  or  FDC)  in  subjects  with  renal  impairment. 
Results  from  mono  component  studies  and  popPK  analyses  including  combination  therapy  data  are 
presented below. 
Niraparib 
There was no formal study of niraparib in subjects with renal impairment. 
In the pooled PopPK dataset from subjects with mCRPC, 50% of the subjects had normal renal function 
(CRCL  ≥90  mL/minute;  N=462/916),  37%  of  the  subjects  had  mild  dysfunction  (CRCL  60-<90 
mL/minute;  N=337/916),  12%  of  the  subjects  had  moderate  dysfunction  (CRCL  30-<60  mL/minute; 
N=114/916), and 3 of the subjects had severe dysfunction (CRCL <30 mL/minute). 
In the popPK niraparib model analysis, CRCL was identified as a covariate on CL/F (estimated exponent 
0.305, which translates into a ~29% reduction in CL/F in a subject with CRCL 30 mL/min compared to 
the reference subject with CLCR 90.24 mL/min. 
Abiraterone 
Systemic exposure to abiraterone was not increased in subjects with end-stage renal disease compared 
with matched control subjects with normal renal function in study COU-AA-012. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 65/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Table 24: PK Parameters of Abiraterone in Plasma From Stage I (COU-AA-012) 
In  a  previous  popPK  analysis  in  subjects  with  mCRPC  who  received  abiraterone,  renal  function 
(mild/moderate impairment) was not identified as a significant covariate on abiraterone PK. 
In the current PopPK dataset consisting of subjects with mCRPC, 47% of the subjects had normal renal 
function (CRCL ≥90 mL/minute; N=447/954), 40% of the subjects had mild dysfunction (CRCL 60-<90 
mL/minute;  N=378/954),  13%  of  the  subjects  had  moderate  dysfunction  (CRCL  30-<60  mL/minute; 
N=127/954),  and  two  of  the  subjects had  severe  dysfunction  (CRCL  <30  mL/minute).  Renal  function 
(CRCL) was not re-investigated as a covariate in the current popPK model analysis. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
There is no formal study of niraparib/AA combo (as SAC or FDC) in subjects with hepatic impairment. All 
clinical trials investigating the combination therapy (niraparib and abiraterone) excluded subjects with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 
Niraparib 
Study 3000-01-003: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-
∞) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment was 1.56 times the niraparib AUC0-∞ in subjects with 
normal  hepatic  function  following  administration  of  a  single  300  mg  dose  whereas  moderate  hepatic 
impairment did not have an effect on niraparib Cmax or on niraparib protein binding. 
In  the  pooled  niraparib  PopPK  dataset  from  subjects  with  mCRPC,  the  majority  of  patients  (74.7%, 
684/916) had normal hepatic function, and 25.2% (231/916) and 01.1% (1/916) had mild and moderate 
hepatic  impairment,  respectively  (National  Cancer  Institute  criteria).  Hepatic  impairment  was  not 
identified as a significant covariate on niraparib pharmacokinetics in the popPK model analysis. 
Abiraterone 
Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single 1,000 mg oral dose of AA increased by approximately 
11%  and  260%  in  subjects  with  mild  and  moderate  pre-existing  hepatic  impairment,  respectively, 
compared  with  subjects  with  normal  hepatic  function  (study  COU-AA-011).  Systemic  exposures  to 
abiraterone  after  the  administration  of  a  125  mg  suspension  of  AA  in  subjects  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment  were  358%  (for  Cmax),  756%  (for  AUC  from  time  0  to  the  time  of  the  last  quantifiable 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 66/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
concentration), and 697% (for AUC0-∞) of dose-normalised exposures reported in subjects with normal 
hepatic function after the administration of a 2,000 mg suspension of AA (study 212082PCR1004). 
The  fraction  of  free  drug  increased  by  80%  in  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  compared  to 
subjects with normal hepatic function. 
In the pooled abiraterone PopPK dataset from subjects with mCRPC, the majority of patients (87.9%, 
684/954) had normal hepatic function, and 25.2% (114/954) and 01.1% (1/954) had mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment, respectively (National Cancer Institute criteria). Mild hepatic impairment was not 
investigated as a covariate in the abiraterone popPK model analysis. 
•  Gender 
All clinical pharmacology data for the combination were derived from male subjects.  
Race 
Niraparib 
In  the  studied patient  population  (n=916),  68.7%  (n=629)  was  white  (not  Hispanic  or Latino),  5.9% 
(n=54)  was  white  (Hispanic  or  Latino),  11.4%  (n=104)  was  Asian,  2.2%  (n=20)  was  black,  other  or 
unknown was 11.5 % (n=105), while Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander accounted for 0.2% (n=2) 
and American Indian or Alaskan Native accounted for 0.2% (n=2). 
Based on the PopPK analysis with pooled PK data from subjects with mCRPC, other races (ie, races other 
than white, Asian, or Hispanic/Latino), and Hispanic/Latino race, were identified as covariates on first-
order absorption rate constant (36% decrease versus white race and 33% decrease versus white race, 
respectively), as well as Asian race on intercompartmental clearance (39% decrease versus white race), 
and on volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment (48% increase versus white race).  
Abiraterone 
In a previous PopPK analysis in subjects with mCRPC who received abiraterone, the potential effects of 
race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were not formally investigated as subjects were 
primarily white males (>75%). 
In the currently studied patient population (n=954), 67.2% (n=641) was white (not Hispanic or Latino), 
7.2% (n=69) was white (Hispanic or Latino), 17.1% (n=163) was Asian, 1.2% (n=11) was black, other 
or unknown was 6.8% (n=65), while Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander accounted for 0.2% (n=2) 
and  American  Indian  or  Alaskan  Native  accounted  for  0.3%  (n=3).  Race  was  not  investigated  as  a 
covariate in the current popPK model analysis. 
•  Weight 
Niraparib 
Based on the current PopPK analysis, body weight (43-165 kg) did not have a clinically relevant impact 
on the exposure to niraparib. 
Abiraterone 
Based on previous popPK modelling using data from single agent therapy, body weight (56-135 kg) did 
not have a clinically relevant impact on the exposure of abiraterone. In the current popPK analysis body 
weight (46-165 kg) was not re-investigated as a covariate. 
•  Elderly 
The summary table with the distribution of subjects included in the PK analysis dataset across different 
sub-groups of age (18-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85+ years) is shown in Table 25 for niraparib and in

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with the FDC have not been performed. 
Potential for DDI for the FDC is based on information that were generated as part of the development 
programs for niraparib and abiraterone as single entities. No new DDI is expected when niraparib and 
AA are given in combination. 
The exposures of niraparib and abiraterone are apparently not impacted to a great extent when given in 
combination compared with when given alone based on comparison with historical data generated with 
single entities (Table 27,Table 28).

Niraparib in combination with abiraterone acetate 
Niraparib is an orally available, highly selective PARPi, with activity against PARP-1 and PARP-2 DNA-
repair  polymerases.  In  vitro  studies  have  shown  that  niraparib-induced  cytotoxicity  may  involve 
inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA 
damage,  apoptosis  and  cell  death.  Abiraterone  acetate  is  a  prodrug  of  abiraterone,  an  androgen 
biosynthesis inhibitor. Specifically, abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-
lyase (CYP17). 
Approximately 15-20% of subjects with mCRPC have HRR gene alterations. The HRR gene alterations 
may act as be a second oncogenic driver, which could be amenable to treatment with a PARP inhibitor. 
For  such  subjects,  antitumor  activity  with  a  PARP  inhibitor  has  been  demonstrated  in  Study 
64091742PCR2001 (hereafter referred to as GALAHAD). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacology 
The E-R evaluations were based on data from the MAGNITUDE study, Cohort 1 and 2, cohorts with a 
double-blind placebo-controlled design. For efficacy, only data from subjects with HRR gene alteration 
(Cohort  1)  were  included,  while  for  safety,  data  from  subjects  with  or  without  HRR  gene  alteration 
(Cohort 1 and 2) were considered. The primary efficacy endpoint was rPFS, defined as the time interval 
from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  first  date  of  radiographic  progression  as  assessed  by  Blinded 
Independent Central Review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

Multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted in a stepwise manner. 
A  multivariate  Cox  regression  analysis  with  niraparib  Cavg  categorised  by  quartiles  adjusted  for  the 
significant  prognostic  factors  (baseline  prostate-specific  antigen,  lactate  dehydrogenase,  alkaline 
phosphatase, and presence of visceral disease [yes versus no]) was conducted. No E-R relationship was 
observed.

The  key  safety  endpoints  included  in  the  exposure-safety  analysis  were  selected  based  on  observed 
adverse events with an occurrence higher than 10% and severity of Grade 3 or higher and a statistically 
significant  difference  between  the  incidences  in  the niraparib  plus  AAP  group  versus  the  placebo  plus 
AAP group. Preselected safety endpoints (grouped term) for the analysis included: 
o  Haematological toxicity (including thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and/or neutropenia) 
o  Nausea 
o  Hypertension 
o  Hypokalemia 
o  Fluid retention/edema

•  Secondary pharmacology 
Niraparib (PR-30-5011-C1-CARDIAC) (Monotherapy Study, Previously Submitted) 
Evaluation of potential effect of niraparib on QT/QTc in patients with cancer. 
The relationship between niraparib plasma concentration and change from baseline in the QTcF interval 
was explored graphically and analysed using a linear mixed-effects model. No exposure-related 
positive trends were observed in mean QTcF or mean changes from baseline (ΔQTcF) versus time since 
dosing. No statistically significant correlation between ΔQTcF and the concentration of circulating 
niraparib in subjects was detected (estimated slope: 0.0049, 95% CI: -0.0020, 0.0117).

A QT/QTc and multi-dose PK study of AA (CB7630) plus prednisone in patients with mCRPC. 
The relationship between QTcF and the corresponding abiraterone concentrations were evaluated by 
applying a linear mixed effects model. The expected changes from baseline in the QTcF intervals (and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals) were also presented. 
In addition the change in QTc was plotted vs. corresponding abiraterone concentrations and Cmax for 
abiraterone. 
The individual change from baseline in QTcF interval and corresponding abiraterone plasma 
concentrations exhibited no apparent relationship as shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15.

•  Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure-Response analysis 
Exposure metrics: 
For the E-R analyses, niraparib and abiraterone average exposure up to the time of the first event (ie, 
progression or death for efficacy, adverse event for safety endpoints), censoring, or end of the 
treatment was considered: 
• 
• 
Efficacy: steady-state Cavg (ie, AUC0-24h,ss/24) up to the time of the event of interest 
Safety: steady-state AUC0-24h and Cmax up to the time of the event of interest 
The relationship between AUC0-24h,ss and Cmax,ss exposure metrics was investigated via scatterplots 
and linear regression. The correlation between the metrics was high (R²>0.98) for both niraparib and 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 74/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
abiraterone. Therefore, the exposure metrics used for the safety E-R analysis was AUC0-24h up to the 
time of the event or end of treatment. 
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
Univariate Kaplan-Meier analyses on the primary population for E-R analysis were performed to explore 
the influence of niraparib exposure on rPFS. Niraparib Cavg exposure metrics were categorised by 
quartiles and an additional category included the subjects randomised to placebo plus AAP. 
As summarised in Table 29, no consistent exposure-response relationship was observed in the 
niraparib plus AAP group. Cavg group Q2 appeared to have a slightly longer median rPFS when 
compared with other exposure quartile groups, however, none of the groups was statistically different 
than the lowest quartile (Q1) group.

Kaplan- Meier Analysis): Influence of the Niraparib Exposure Metrics – Cohort 1, All HRR 
Randomized Analysis Set (Subjects With PK Parameters) (N=414) 
Exposure-safety analysis 
First, the exploratory analysis consisted in checking that the pre-selected safety endpoints met the 
pre-defined criteria for E-R analysis, ie, Grade 3 or higher, overall incidence ≥10% and difference 
between the incidences in the niraparib plus AAP group versus placebo plus AAP group statistically 
significant. 
Based on the exploratory analysis, the safety endpoints included in the E-R analysis were anaemia and 
haematological toxicity as combined class of events. 
The results showed that the probability of experiencing Grade 3 to 4 anaemia increases with increasing 
niraparib exposure (Figure 16 a). Similar results were observed with haematological toxicity as 
combined class of events (Figure 16 b).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  validation  of  the  analytical  methods  used  for  the  determination  of  abiraterone  and  abiraterone 
acetate  (PBRL-RD-1350/JJP567XL-115673-B/BA10183)  and  of  niraparib  and  M1  in  human  plasma 
samples, is considered correct according to EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev.1 Corr.2. 
The analysis of study samples is considered to have been overall correctly conducted.  
Bioequivalence 
To bridge the applied formulations to efficacy and safety data obtained with single agent formulations 
in MAGNITUDE cohort 1 (efficacy and safety, target population) and cohort 2 (safety population), the 
Applicant conducted a BE/BA study comparing the PK following administration of single agent 
EMA/126335/2023

formulations and the regular and low strength fixed-dose combinations. Currently EU approved single 
agent formulations (i.e. niraparib [Zejula] 100 mg capsules and abiraterone [Zytiga] 250 mg tablets) 
were used in both the BA/BE study and in Magnitude cohort 1 and 2. 
Regular strength tablet (FDC-RS) 
The BE study design for assessing bioequivalence of FDC-RS vs SAG is acceptable and in accordance 
with the EMA BE guidline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **).  
Sample size calulations, based on inter-individual variability (IIV) from single agent studies and an 
overall power of at least 80%, appears acceptable. Up to 120 patients were to be enrolled to account 
for potentially greater IIV due to modified fasting conditions and potential non-evaluability and ensure 
at least 96 BE evaluable subjects (protocol amendement 2, 19. April 2021). 
Based on niraparib and abiraterone half-lifes (50±15 h and 15h, respectively) and QD dosing, steady 
state is expected to be achieved within the second PK assessment period (i.e. 11 days). The PK 
assessment phase was, according to the Applicant, kept to a minimum due to the potential 
heamatological effect of niraparib in HRR negative patients. 
Primary PK parameters (Cmax, AUC24,ss) and statistical methods used to investigate bioequivalence 
for FDC-RS are acceptable. Originally, a two-stage design in accordance with the EMA BE guideline was 
originally planned, however “to increase the probability of success in the final BE analysis”, the interim 
analysis was not further pursued (Protocol amendment 2 19. April 2021). 
With respect to niraparib, BE was demonstrated for FDC-RS vs SAC. Point estimates were 1.03 and 
1.01 for Cmax,ss and AUC0-24h,ss, respectively, the 90% CIs were within the prespecified acceptance 
limits (80.00-125.00%), and IIVs for the primary BE PK parameters were low (~15-16%). Abiraterone 
Cmax,ss and AUC0-24h,ss geometric mean ratios and corresponding 90% CI intervals (i.e. 96.67 
[90%CI 87.59, 106.69] and 93.33 [90%CI 86.91, 100.23]) were also within the acceptance limits 
when FDC-RS was compared with SAC, although the upper bound 90% CI for AUC0-24h,ss was just 
above 100. IIVs for primary BE PK parameters were ~34-48%. 
In summary, bioequivalence between the regular-strength fixed-dose combination tablets and the single 
agents of niraparib and abiraterone acetate has been adequately demonstrated. 
Low strength tablet (FDC-LS) 
The lower strenght tablet was developed to accommodate dose reductions of niraparib. No formal 
evaluation of BE between the lower strength of niraparib/abiraterone fixed-dose tablets (FDC-LS) and 
SAC was attempted. Instead, relative bioavailability of FDC-LS versus SAC following a single dose was 
investigated using a parallel design which was not in accordance with the scientific advice provided 
(EMEA/H/SA/4392/1/2020/III). The rationale for chosing a parallel design (i.e. biowaiver criteria) is 
not supported.  
In parallel design studies, the treatment groups should be comparable in all known variables that may 
affect the pharmacokinetics of the active substance. This is an essential pre-requisite to give validity to 
the results from such studies. Although, according to the Applicant, no differences in demographics or 
disease characteristics between treatment sequences were apparent, the study design did not account 
for inter-subject differences as patients were randomly assigned to treatment sequences 1 to 4. 
For the FDC-LS formulation following a single dose of niraparib/abiraterone 100 mg/1000 mg, lower 
bound 90%CI of niraparib Cmax (78.22) was not within the general BE acceptance limits, and lower 
bound 90%CI for AUC0-72h was borderline (80.31). Geometric mean ratios of niraparib Cmax and 
AUC0-72h were 90.88% and 90.11%, respectively. With respect to abiraterone, GMR (90%CI ) for 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 77/196 
 
 
  
 
 
Cmax and AUC0-72h were 132.62 (108.35-162.32) and 121.93 (101.09-147.07), and 90CI% intervals 
did not contain 100. 
Thus, the relative BA assessment indicated non-bioequivalence between FDC-LS tablets and SAC.The 
apparent increased abiraterone exposure represent a potential safety concern with the FDC-LS as 
abiraterone is already given at the maximum recommended dose (1000 mg) according to the proposed 
posology. However, it is still unclear whether these BA results are related to high interindividual 
variability or represent actual formulation effects.  
Due to the high IIV in GMR observed for abiraterone FDC-LS vs SAC, the Applicant presented 
additional post hoc investigations of paired single-sequence data which showed that 90% CI of the 
GMRs for estimated abiraterone Cmax,ss and AUC (AUC0-∞ for FDC-LS or AUC0-24h,ss for SAC) 
between FDC-LS and SAC were within the 80.00% to 125.00% BE criteria.  
In addition, the Applicant conducted a model-based assessment to predict whether the FDC-LS 
formulation was bioequivalent with the single agents. The simulation of a cross-over design with the 
pre-final PopPK model of abiraterone, which included the covariate effects of LS-FDC on KA and D1, 
while accounting for their large RSE, showed a probability of showing BE of 96.4%.Considering the 
unfeasibility to conduct an experimental BE study, the submitted modelling and simulation exercise 
could be used in this specific case to support the post hoc analysis conducted with sequence 3 and 4 of 
the submitted BA/BE study. However, a level of uncertainty still remains regarding the potential higher 
exposure of abiraterone with the LS-FDC, which has been communicated in section 4.2 and 5.2 of the 
currently proposed SmPC. 
Food effects 
The impact of food effects has not been characterised with the FDC of niraparib and abiraterone. The 
effect of food has only been assessed in food effects studies where niraparib or abiraterone were 
administered as monotherapy. Studies with abiraterone showed a significant increase in the exposure 
of abiraterone when administered with food. Based on that data, MAGNITUDE, QUEST combination 3 
and BA/BE studies were conducted under modified fasting conditions. A statement that Akeega should 
be taken under modified fasting conditions is included in the SmPC section 4.2. 
Distribution 
The SmPC includes the data of apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F) of both molecules niraparib and 
abiraterone. Both active principles show a high distribution to peripheral tissues and the large protein 
binding (>80%) explains the large apparent volume of distribution in the central compartment for 
niraparib (386L) and abiraterone (7052 L).  
Elimination 
PopPK analysis has been used to inform the SmPC section 5.2. The niraparib and abiraterone models 
were overall able to describe central tendency in the studied population of mCRPC patients.  
Dose proportionality 
Niraparib administered as monotherapy showed linear PK and dose-proportional exposure across the 
range of doses evaluated (30-400 mg). 
The dose proportionality of abiraterone between 250 and 1000 mg has been demonstrated, based on 
the estimated Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf ratios between the highest dose (1000 mg) and the lower 
doses (250, 500 and 750 mg). 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 78/196 
 
 
  
 
 
Niraparib co-administered with AAP 
After multiple dose administration of 200 mg and 300 mg of niraparib plus AAP, no conclusions on dose 
proportionality could be drawn; for the majority of subjects receiving 200 mg niraparib trough values 
were only available for one treatment cycle and for subjects receiving 300 mg niraparib the data were 
very limited (Study BEDIVERE). 
Population PK modelling 
The niraparib and abiraterone popPK models are used to support the current application with: 
- a description of pharmacokinetics and its variability; 
- the identification of significant covariates (extrinsic and intrinsic factors) and 
- an estimate of exposures for ER analysis. 
The PopPK models were also used to simulate bioequivalence for the FDC-LS formulation (see above). 
When used for bioequivalence simulation, the popPK models are of high regulatory impact as they are 
then the key source of evidence in the absence of an adequately designed confirmative bioequivalence 
study.  The descriptive use of the model to inform the SmPC is considered of low to medium impact. 
The popPK analysis was based on a pooled dataset from five Studies, which includes data of niraparib 
as monotherapy and niraparib and AA in combination, all in subjects with metastatic prostate cancer 
[reference to Table popPK dataset in section 2.6.2.1]. M1 method for handling BLQ-data is considered 
acceptable as niraparib and abiraterone BLQs were <3.9% and <1.9%, respectively. 
Niraparib PPK model 
The base PopPK model of niraparib was a 2-compartment model with linear elimination and sequential 
zero and first-order absorption. Although the structural definition of the popPK model of niraparib in 
monotherapy was a 3-compartment model, the use of 2-compartment PK model seems adequate 
based on the statistical performance and the modelling strategy implemented.  
The covariate analysis included a full covariate model with backward elimination of non-statistically 
significant covariates. The strategy is endorsed due to the moderate-to-high eta-shrinkage observed in 
several PK parameters of the base model. 
The effects of FDC-RS and FDC-LS formulation were tested on the absorption parameters (Ka, D1, F1). 
Due to very large RSEs values on the effects of FDC-RS on Ka and F1 and of FDC-LS on D1, only FDC-
LS on D1 and FDC-LS on F1 (RSEs<50 %) were retained in the final model. The strategy of covariate 
selection seems adequate, although it leads to unexpected PK relationships, such as differences for the 
FDC at low strength on F1 and D1, but not on Ka. The impact on bioavailability (F1) and duration of 
zero-order absorption (D1) of the low strength is difficult to understand, since it may be linked to 
differences in the soluble fraction and transit time, leading the ~11-12% difference on F1 and D1 vs 
the regular strength. However, the impact in terms of exposure metrics of those differences is 
unknown. 
Inter-individual variability (IIV) on Ka, Vp and D1 in the final model was high (66%, 44% and 83% 
respectively) and the added covariate effects explained only a small part of the observed variability. 
The final model included the following statistically significant covariate effects: FDC-LS on D1 and F1; 
other races and Hispanic/latino race on Ka; CRCL, HRR-negative and HRR-positive non-BRCA on CL; 
Asian race on Q and Vp. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 79/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The pcVPCs of the final popPK model demonstrates the adequacy of the mathematical framework to 
characterise the central tendency across the different studies. A slight underprediction at initial 
sampling times in the FDC1-LS data is observed, which may explain the large IIV on Ka and D1 due to 
deficiencies in the characterisation of the absorption phase. 
The clinical relevance of statistically significant covariates and non-included covariates was assessed 
over exposure metrics (AUC0-24h,ss and Ctrough,ss), suggesting that clinically relevant changes in 
exposure (>20%) are expected in patients with moderate renal impairment with the proposed dosing 
regimen.  
Abiraterone PPK model 
The popK model was a 2-compartment disposition model with zero-order input in a depot compartment 
followed by first-order absorption in a series of transit compartments and finally into the central 
compartment, and first-order elimination as previously developed in subjects with mCRPC. No 
covariates were included in the final model, and the relatively high IIV (61-76%) observed in 
absorption PK parameters could thus not be explained. The overall model performance (pcVPC) 
suggests that the final popPK model of abiraterone slightly over-predicts the inter-individual random 
effects, since prediction intervals of the 5th and 95th percentiles are above and below the corresponding 
experimental percentiles.  
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Niraparib 
It has been previously shown that hepatobiliary clearance and renal excretion are the major routes of 
elimination of niraparib in humans. No formal dedicated PK study was performed to investigate the effect 
of renal impairment on niraparib PK as monotherapy. 
Based on the population PK modelling, CrCl was identified as a significant covariate in the final niraparib 
PopPK model (patients with prostate cancer).  
Abiraterone 
In  a  previous  dedicated  study  (abiraterone  monotherapy),  systemic  exposure  to  abiraterone  did  not 
increase in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis 
Based on the Abiraterone PopPK analysis, CrCl was not included as a covariate in the final model. The 
recommendations  for  use  of  niraparib+abiraterone  in  patients  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe  renal 
impairment appear appropriate from a PK and safety perspective based on current knowledge. 
Hepatic impairment 
The  recommendations  for  use  of  niraparib+abiraterone  in  patients  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe 
hepatic impairment appear appropriate from a PK and safety perspective based on current knowledge.  
Race 
Race was identified as a covariate in the niraparib popPK analysis, but the expected impact on exposure 
is small. In a previous abiraterone popPK analysis in subjects with mCRPC (primarily white males), race 
was not formally investigated as a significant covariate. Race was not re-investigated as a covariate in 
the current popPK analysis, despite the increased number of patients with race other than white in the 
current patient population (including 17.1% Asians). A new covariate search would have been useful to 
formally investigate the effect of Asian vs White ethnic origin on abiraterone PK, however, the issue was 
not further pursued 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 80/196 
 
 
  
 
 
Weight 
The  Applicant  conducted  a  model-based  approach  using  a  forest  plot  analysis  in  order  to  assess  the 
impact  of  body  weight  over  the  exposure  metrics  (Ctrough,ss,  Cmax,  ss  and  AUC0-24,ss)  comparing 
patients with weights ≥ 82 kg versus patients with weights ≤82 kg for niraparib and comparing patients 
with  weights  ≥  83.5  kg  versus  patients  with  weights  ≤83.5  kg  for  abiraterone.  The  clinical  relevance 
analysis stratified by body-weight quartiles did not suggest any relevant change in exposure metrics for 
niraparib nor abiraterone. 
Elderly 
Niraparib 
Based  on  the  population  PK  modelling,  age  was  not  identified  as  a  significant  covariate  in  the  final 
niraparib PopPK model. The Applicant conducted a model-based approach using a forest plot analysis in 
order  to  assess  the  impact  age  over  the  exposure  metrics  (Ctrough,ss,  Cmax,  ss  and  AUC0-24,ss) 
comparing patients aged ≥ 69 years versus patients <69 years. No relevant changes were found.  
Abiraterone 
Based on previous population PK modelling, age was not identified as a significant covariate. Age was 
not re-investigated as a covariate in the current popPK analysis. The Applicant conducted a model-
based approach using a forest plot analysis in order to assess the impact age over the exposure 
metrics (Ctrough,ss, Cmax, ss and AUC0-24,ss). AUCss 24h changed 10-25% and Cmin 12-20% when 
comparing patients aged ≥ 70 years versus patients <70 years. 
Section 5.2 adequately describes the effects of intrinsic factors on PK of niraparib and abiraterone as 
single agents as well as recommendations for use of the FDC in special populations.  
Pharmacokinetics interactions studies 
No formal characterisation of the interaction effects of niraparib and abiraterone on different enzymatic 
pathways have been conducted for the FDC formulation. Recommendations for the FDC formulation have 
been  incorporated  based  on  the  previous  evidence  on  the  in  vivo  interactions  of  each  component  as 
monotherapy, which is considered acceptable.  
Overall, no major differences in exposure were observed for niraparib and abiraterone at multiple dose 
regimen between monotherapy and combination, suggesting that the metabolic pathways may not be 
altered due to the simultaneous co-administration of niraparib or abiraterone. Minor differences could be 
observed, especially on Cmax, after single dose administration between monotherapy and combination 
therapy, which may be more related on changes in the dissolution/absorption process of each drug rather 
than differences in the metabolic profile.  
Secondary pharmacology: QTc prolongation 
No clinically relevant QTc prolongation was identified for niraparib and abiraterone as monotherapy. 
The results suggest that niraparib and abiraterone exposure is not statistically linked to changes in 
QT/QTc prolongation. No additional information was provided regarding the effect of combination 
therapy of niraparib and abiraterone on QT/QTc prolongation. However, no clinically relevant changes 
in QT/QTc interval prolongation are expected for the combination therapy based on previous evidence 
as monotherapy of each active principle.  
Exposure-Response analysis 
The exposure-response analysis was based on data from the MAGNITUDE study. The objective was to 
explore the relationship between niraparib exposure and the efficacy and safety endpoints. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 81/196 
 
 
  
 
 
Exposure-efficacy 
Only subjects with HRR gene alteration (Cohort 1) were included. The efficacy outcome used was rPFS. 
Cavg derived from the PPK analysis was used as the measure of exposure. The Kaplan-Meier analysis 
identified a statistically significant improvement in the niraparib plus AAP group with a reduction in the 
risk of rPFS compared to the placebo plus AAP group. When the exposure of niraparib was categorised 
by quartiles, no statistically significant exposure-efficacy relationship could be established. 
In the HRR+ non-BRCA subgroup, the treatment with Nira+AAP showed no benefit compared to placebo, 
with a HR of 0.986 (95% CI: 0.675, 1.442, p=0.94). 
During  the  assessment  additional  E-R  analyses  based  on  exposure  metrics  (AUC0-24h,ss)  associated 
with the first dose were submitted. In the non-stratified univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis with niraparib 
exposure categorised by quartiles, no clear exposure-response relationship was evident, but the median 
rPFS  was  apparently  shorter  in  the  highest  exposure  quartile  (Q4).  This  was  also  the  case  in  the 
multivariate  analysis  adjusted  for  significant  prognostic  factors  (baseline  PSA,  baseline  LDH,  baseline 
ALP and presence of visceral disease). No clear E-R relationship could be seen in subgroup univariate 
analyses  for  subjects  with  BRCA  gene  alteration  and  non-BRCA  gene  alterations.  The  reason  for  the 
seemingly poorer outcome observed in Q4 for exposure metrics based on both average daily dose and 
first dose is not known and could not, based on available data, be interpreted as a result of the higher 
exposure per se. The analyses were exploratory and should be interpreted with caution. There was a 
small  number  of  patients  (~50)  in  each  exposure  quartile.  A  relatively  narrow  exposure  range  was 
studied  as  all  patients  received  the  same  starting  dose,  and  there  is  uncertainty  in  the  estimated 
individual exposure metrics as a consequence of sparse sampling and eta-shrinkage. Also, the analyses 
across quartiles may have been influenced by other unbalanced prognostic factors not accounted for.  
Exposure-safety 
Subjects enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2 from MAGNITUDE study were included. AUC0-24h up to the time of 
the event or end of treatment was used as the exposure metric. The key safety endpoints included were 
selected  based  on  an  occurrence  higher  than  10%  and  a  severity  grade  3  of  higher,  therefore  only 
anaemia was included. Statistically significant relationships between AUC0-24h of niraparib and anaemia 
and haematological toxicity were established, suggesting that patients at the third and fourth quartiles 
would show a 40% and 60% probability, respectively, of developing anaemia or haematological toxicity.  
The Applicant has used steady-state exposure metrics (Cavg or AUC0-24h) derived based on the post-
hoc estimates from the final PopPK models scaled by the average daily dose up to the time of the first 
event  of  interest  (rPFS  event,  end  of  treatment,  or  censoring  date).  While  the  use  of  time-variant 
exposure accounts for dose modifications, bias may be introduced in the ER analyses because exposure 
(independent variable) will no longer be independent of the response (dependent variable). During the 
assessment,  the  Applicant  has  submitted  additional  E-R  analyses  based  on  exposure  metrics  (AUC0-
24h,ss)  associated  with  the  first  dose.  The  results  were  similar  to  those  previously  reported  using 
exposure  metrics  based  on  average  dose  and  demonstrated  an  increasing  risk  of  anaemia  and 
haematological toxicity with increasing niraparib exposure. However, the analyses were exploratory and 
should be interpreted with caution.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology documentation is considered adequate. The pharmacokinetic properties of 
niraparib and abiraterone as a fixed-dose combination have been characterised using several clinical 
studies in healthy subjects and cancer patients, and bioequivalence has been demonstrated for the 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 82/196 
 
 
  
 
 
FDC-RS compared to SAC. An uncertainty still remains regarding the potential higher exposure of 
abiraterone with the LS-FDC, which is adequately communicated in the SmPC. 
The exposure-response relationship of niraparib in patients with metastatic prostate cancer has been 
conducted evaluating exposure metrics with several response endpoints. No statistically significant 
relationship was established between niraparib exposure and PFS, indicating that differences in 
exposure are not expected to predict differences in efficacy at the proposed dose. A positive and steep 
exposure-safety relationship has been established between niraparib AUC0-24h and haematological 
toxicity, suggesting that patients above the median exposure would show a probability >40% of 
developing haematological safety events. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The dose of niraparib (200 mg once daily) was selected based on data from the completed Phase 1b 
Study 64091742PCR1001 (BEDIVERE). This was a Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-
selection study with dose expansion that enrolled adult subjects with mCRPC, with or without DNA-
repair anomalies, who received at least 1 line of prior taxane-based chemotherapy and 1 line of 
androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy. The primary objectives were to evaluate the safety and to 
establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of niraparib, when administered in combination with 
an AR-targeted therapy. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the PK of niraparib in combination 
with apalutamide or abiraterone acetate and the PK of apalutamide and abiraterone acetate in 
combination with niraparib. 
The study was comprised of a standard 3+3 dose selection (Part 1), followed by a dose expansion 
(Part 2) once a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of niraparib in combination with AAP was 
determined. Only two dose levels (the 200-mg and 300-mg doses) of niraparib were tested. A total of 
33 subjects were enrolled and treated, 6 into the niraparib+apalutamide group and 27 into the 
niraparib+AAP group. During the DLT period, 4 subjects were enrolled into the 200-mg niraparib+AAP 
cohort, and 8 subjects were enrolled into the 300-mg niraparib+AAP cohort. An additional 15 subjects 
were subsequently enrolled into the expansion cohort.  In the niraparib+AAP group, no subjects in the 
200-mg cohort experienced a DLT. One subject (12.5%) in the 300-mg cohort experienced 2 DLTs of 
fatigue and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased. Two additional subjects in the 300-mg 
cohort experienced Grade 4 neutropenia at Cycle 2 Day 1, which contributed to the selection of the 
200-mg cohort as the MTD for nira+AAP. Comparable exposures of niraparib between the 2 doses 
when coadministered with AAP were observed.  
Based on all these data, niraparib 200 mg was chosen as dose for use in combination with AAP.

2.6.5.2.  Main study 
Study MAGNITUDE (64091742PRC3001): a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 
study of niraparib in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus abiraterone acetate 
and prednisone for treatment of subjects with metastatic prostate cancer 
Figure 17. Study design MAGNITUDE 
Subjects were prospectively screened for HRR alterations and then enrolled into either Cohort 1 
(presence of HRR gene alterations) or Cohort 2 (absence of HRR gene alterations). After completion of 
enrolment into Cohort 1 and 2, a separate open-label cohort (Cohort 3) was enrolled for subjects with 
HRR gene alterations to obtain clinical experience with the FDC tablet formulation of niraparib and AA. 
Subjects in Cohort 3 were enrolled under the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and underwent the 
same study procedures as Cohort 1, except that subjects in Cohort 3 received open-label niraparib/AA 
as a FDC tablet plus prednisone instead of niraparib, AA, and prednisone as single agents 
The study consisted of a Pre-screening phase to assess biomarker eligibility prior to other screening 
evaluations, a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, an Extension Phase, and a Follow-up Phase.

b.  Haemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL, independent of transfusions for at least 30 days.  
c.  Platelet count ≥100 x 109 /L. 
Key exclusion criteria 
1.  Had prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor.  
2.  Had systemic therapy (i.e., novel second generation AR targeted therapy such as enzalutamide, 
apalutamide, or darolutamide; taxane-based chemotherapy, or more than 4 months of abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone [AAP] prior to randomization) in the mCRPC setting; or AAP outside of the 
mCRPC setting. 
3.  Subjects who had received 2 to 4 months of AAP prior to randomization for the treatment of 
mCRPC should have had no evidence of progression by PSA (per PCWG3) during screening. These 
potential subjects were required to have 2 PSA values during the Pre-screening and Screening 
Phases. The second PSA value was to be within 2 weeks of randomization and PSA rise was 
thought to be due to flare, the Investigator was to confirm that there was no radiographic 
progression.  
4.  Had presence of uncontrolled hypertension (persistent systolic BP ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP 
≥100 mmHg). Subjects with a history of hypertension were allowed, if BP was controlled to within 
these limits by anti-hypertensive treatment.  
5.  Subjects who are receiving opioid analgesics at the time of screening. 
6.  Subjects who had the following ≤28 days prior to randomization:  
a)  A transfusion (platelets or red blood cells). 
b)  Hematopoietic growth factors.  
c)  An investigational agent for prostate cancer.  
d)  Major surgery (Sponsor should be consulted regarding what constitutes major surgery).  
e)  Radiation therapy 
Treatments 
Subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 200 mg niraparib, 1,000 
mg AA, and 10 mg prednisone (nira+AAP) and or matching placebo, 1,000 mg AA, and 10 mg 
prednisone (PBO+AAP) daily. Subjects in Cohort 3 received 200 mg niraparib/1,000 mg AAP (referred 
to hereafter as FDC) and 10 mg prednisone daily (FDC+P).  
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 85/196 
 
 
  
 
 
Background therapy with a GnRHa for patients who had not previously undergone surgical castration 
was mandatory to maintain castrate concentrations of testosterone (≤50 ng/dL). The choice of GnRHa 
was at the discretion of the investigator. 
Two FDC tablet formulations were available to treat subjects in Cohort 3. The regular strength FDC 
formulation was designed for the full-dose regimen of 200 mg niraparib and 1,000 mg of AA (plus 
prednisone) daily, comprised of 2 tablets, each containing 100 mg niraparib and 500 mg AA. 
Prednisone was given separately. For subjects who required a dose reduction of niraparib, a low 
strength formulation containing 50 mg niraparib and 500 mg AA was available, with 2 tablets taken 
daily (plus prednisone) to achieve a total daily dose of niraparib 100 mg and AA 1,000 mg. Subjects 
who required a dose interruption of either agent, or who required a dose reduction of AA were allowed 
to take single agent medications to comprise the dose prescribed by the investigator in accordance 
with the protocol. 
Subjects took daily treatment orally on a continuous basis. Treatment began at Cycle 1 Day 1 in the 
treatment phase and continued in 28-day cycles until the study drug was discontinued.

Table 30. Objectives and endpoints 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), as assessed by BICR and 
defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of radiographic progression or death, 
whichever occurred first.  
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 87/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Radiographic progression is determined by first occurrence of progression by bone scan (according to 
PCWG3 criteria) or progression of soft tissue lesions by CT or MRI (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria), 
both assessed by BICR. 
Secondary endpoints 
o  Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (TCC) defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer. 
o  Time to symptomatic progression (TSP) defined as the time from the date of randomization to 
the date of the first of any of the following: 
−  The use of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for skeletal symptoms; 
−  The need for tumour-related orthopaedic surgical intervention; 
−  Other cancer-related procedures (e.g. nephrostomy insertion, bladder catheter 
insertion, EBRT, or surgery for tumour symptoms other than skeletal); 
−  Cancer-related morbid events (e.g., fracture [symptomatic and/or pathologic], cord 
compression, urinary obstructive events); or  
− 
Initiation of the new anti-cancer therapy for cancer pain. 
o  Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death 
from any cause. 
Other efficacy endpoints 
o  Time to PSA progression (TPSA) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first 
date of documented PSA progression, according to PCWG3 criteria.  
There will be a PSA progression when after decline from baseline: PSA increase ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 
ng/mL above the nadir, and which is confirmed by a second value ≥ 3 weeks later (ie, a 
confirmed rising trend); And when no decline from baseline: PSA increase ≥25% and ≥ 2 
ng/mL from baseline beyond 12 weeks. 
o  Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), defined as the time from randomization to the date of first 
progression (radiographic, clinical, or PSA progression) on the first subsequent therapy or 
death from any cause, whichever occurred first. 
o  Time to pain progression defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the 
first observation of pain progression (an increase by at least 2 points from baseline in BPI-SF 
worst pain intensity [item 3] observed at 2 consecutive evaluations ≥3 weeks apart). 
Sample size 
Cohort 1: Approximately 400 subjects with mCRPC and HRR gene alterations were to be randomized 
1:1 to receive nira+AAP or PBO+AAP to provide 87% power in detecting a HR of 0.65 in subjects with 
mCRPC and HRR gene alterations at a 2-tailed level of significance of 0.05. Assuming approximately 
50% of subjects in Cohort 1 belong to the BRCA subgroup, with the proposed sample size 
approximately 102 rPFS events are planned to be observed in the BRCA subgroup to provide 93% 
power to detect a HR of 0.5 at a 2-tailed level of significance of 0.05.  
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 88/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Cohort 2: Approximately 600 subjects with mCRPC and no HRR gene alteration were to be randomized 
1:1 to receive nira+AAP or PBO+AAP if futility was not met.  
Cohort 3: Approximately 100 subjects with HRR gene alterations were to be enrolled into Cohort 3, 
50% of whom had BRCA alterations. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either nira+AAP or PBO+AAP. 
Randomization was performed across all study sites using the interactive web response system 
(IWRS). Subjects were stratified by past taxane-based chemotherapy exposure (yes versus no), past 
AR targeted therapy exposure (prior novel anti-androgen therapy, such as enzalutamide, apalutamide, 
darolutamide versus no prior novel anti-androgen therapy), and prior AAP use (yes versus no). For 
Cohort 1, stratification by gene alteration group (i.e., BRCA1 or BRCA2 versus all other HRR gene 
alterations) was also performed. Cohort 3 was open label and not randomized. 
Cohorts 1 and 2 are conducted in double-blind fashion. Cohort 3 is open label, although the 
independent central imaging reviewers remain blinded to which cohort the subjects are assigned 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis populations were used in the evaluation of safety and efficacy: 
−  Randomized Analysis Set for Cohort 1: Randomized subjects in Cohort 1 were used in 
efficacy analysis for Cohort 1.   
−  Safety Analysis Set: The safety analysis set included all randomized subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of study treatment in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. The safety analysis set was used for 
evaluating safety. Safety analysis was performed separately by Cohort.  
−  FDC Analysis Set: All subjects who were enrolled into Cohort 3 will be used for baseline and 
demographic data analysis, and their clinical experience will be described. All subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of study treatment in Cohort 3 will be evaluated for safety. 
Efficacy analyses 
The final analysis of the primary endpoint rPFS was performed when approximately 220 rPFS events 
were observed in Cohort 1 and approximately 102 rPFS events were observed in the BRCA subgroup 
within Cohort 1. Pre-specified sensitivity analyses were performed in accordance with the SAP. 
Efficacy analysis began by testing rPFS in the BRCA subgroup of Cohort 1 using a 2-sided alpha level of 
0.05. If significance was met in the BRCA subgroup, then rPFS in all of Cohort 1 was to be tested, also 
at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 based on the pre-defined testing hierarchy. If rPFS in Cohort 1 was 
significant, then the secondary endpoints were to be tested using group sequential method with 2 
interim analyses and the final analysis. After testing for the primary endpoint of rPFS in the BRCA 
subgroup and Cohort 1, alpha of 0.05 was split between the secondary endpoints, which were analysed 
for all of Cohort 1 with an alpha of 0.025 allocated to OS and an alpha of 0.0125 allocated to TCC and 
TSP separately. The alpha for the secondary endpoints was further subdivided between the 2 planned 
interim analyses and the final analysis. For the secondary endpoints, the O’Brien-Fleming (OBF) 
boundaries as implemented by the Lan-DeMets alpha spending method were utilized, and interim 
boundary cut-offs were calculated using the information fraction for the OS endpoint.  
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 89/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The boundary for significance for TCC and TSP at the IA1 was 0.0001 and for OS 0.0005. The IA2 and 
the final analysis will be performed when approximately 170 OS events and 246 OS events have been 
observed, respectively. 
Figure 18. Graphical Approach for Testing Key Efficacy Endpoints 
Futility analysis for Cohort 2 
A non-binding futility analysis was planned for Cohort 2 after approximately 200 subjects were enrolled 
and approximately 125 composite progression events had been observed; where composite 
progression events were the first of either radiographic progression, PSA progression, or death. 
Enrolment in this cohort was held after 247 subjects had been enrolled. The quantitative decision 
criterion for evaluating futility was derived based on the estimated HR using the composite progression 
events through a Cox proportional-hazard model. Cohort 2 would be considered futile if the observed 
HR for time to composite progression events was greater than or equal to 1.  
The pre-planned futility analysis for Cohort 2 was performed on 13 August 2020, assessing data from 
233 subjects with 113 composite progression events observed. With a HR=1.087 for the composite 
progression endpoint, the pre-specified criteria for futility of HR >1 was met, and futility was declared 
for this cohort. Based upon the IDMC recommendation, the Sponsor permanently halted enrolment in 
Cohort 2, and this cohort was unblinded. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 3,283 subjects screened for eligibility for the MAGNITUDE Study.  
During the pre-screening process, 2,337 subjects failed pre-screening and did not proceed to study 
screening. The primary reason for pre-screen failure was subjects testing negative for HRR gene 
alterations after Cohort 2 (non-HRR) had been closed to enrolment. Of the 946 subjects who entered 
screening, 765 subjects were enrolled in the study: 423 subjects in Cohort 1, 95 subjects in Cohort 3, 
and 247 subjects in Cohort 2. 
A total of 423 subjects with HRR gene alterations were randomized into Cohort 1: 212 into the 
nira+AAP group and 211 into the PBO+AAP group. All subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and were included in the Safety Analysis Set.

Brazil (19 sites); Bulgaria (1 site); Canada (5 sites); China (10 sites); Czech Republic (5 sites); France 
(9 sites); Germany (3 sites); Hungary (7 sites); Italy (9 sites); Malaysia (6 sites); Mexico (3 sites); 
Netherlands (4 sites); Poland (9 sites); Portugal (1 site); Russian Federation (16 sites); South Korea 
(14 sites); Spain (11 sites); Sweden (2 sites); Taiwan (8 sites); Turkey (10 sites); Ukraine (11 sites); 
United Kingdom (4 sites); United States (15 sites). 
Conduct of the study 
There were 6 global amendments to the original protocol (22 October 2018). The first protocol 
amendment was adopted after subject enrolment began. A summary of the changes included in each 
global amendment is provided below. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 92/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Global Amendment 1 (10 April 2019) included the following changes:  
•  Clarified collection of BPI-SF #3 assessments during the screening period,  
•  Added PRO-CTCAE assessments for subjects in the US,  
•  Modified text regarding MDS/AML evaluation to clarify that the tests, as clinically indicated, 
were to be done locally and not centrally, and  
• 
Implemented administrative changes based on local regulations, and some minor editorial 
changes.  
Global Amendment 2 (30 September 2019) included the following changes:  
•  Changed the secondary endpoints of the study and minor editorial changes. The secondary 
endpoints of time-to-chronic opioid use and time-to-pain progression were removed and 
replaced with time-to symptomatic progression.  
•  Changed collection of pain using the BPI-SF #3 from daily collection on a handheld device, to 
monthly collection on a site tablet, or by using interview mode.  
Global Amendment 3 (12 February 2020) included the following changes:  
•  Stopped enrolment of subjects with ATM mutations into Cohort 1 and added that at least 50% 
of subjects randomized into Cohort 1 were to have BRCA mutations. 
Global Amendment 4 (03 July 2020) included the Following Changes:  
•  Updated the statistical analysis of the study to specify that subjects with BRCA1 or 2 gene 
alterations (the BRCA subgroup) of Cohort 1 were to be analysed first. If statistical significance 
was reached in the BRCA subgroup, then the entire population of subjects with HRR gene 
alterations (Cohort 1) was to be tested. If statistical significance in Cohort 1 was reached and 
futility had not been met in Cohort 2, then the combined population of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 
(ITT population) was to be tested. Otherwise, if futility analysis was met, the ITT analysis was 
not to be performed. 
• 
Enrolled a new Cohort of subjects (Cohort 3) who would receive niraparib/AA FDC tablet 
formulation plus prednisone with the objective of describing the clinical experience with the 
FDC tablets in subjects with mCRPC and HRR gene alterations.  
•  An additional biomarker, CDK12, was added to the panel of genes that determined eligibility 
for Cohorts 1 and 3, and the wording “DRD” was updated to “HRR gene alteration” given that 
subjects whose tumours had mutations in genes outside of the DNA-repair pathway could be 
included for enrolment.  
Global Amendment 5 (29 January 2021) Included the Following Changes:  
•  Revised safety monitoring and guidance based on updates to the niraparib core safety 
information.  
•  Clarified the procedures for subjects moving into the Extension Phase (open-label or long 
term), and the limited data collection phase for Cohort 2 subjects remaining on treatment. 
Global Amendment 6 (30 September 2021) Included the Following Changes:  
•  Aligned with the SAP, the analysis approach for testing secondary endpoints (OS, TCC, and 
TSP) in Cohort 1 was updated to a group sequential method, and a second interim analysis, 
hereafter referred to as IA2, was added.

Protocol deviations 
All protocol deviations of eligibility criteria and those deviations that could impact subject safety or 
primary endpoints were considered major protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations were identified 
in 16 subjects overall: 6 (2.8%) subjects in the nira+AAP group and 10 (4.7%) subjects in the 
PBO+AAP group.

HRR gene alterations 
Cohort 1 included 229 (54.1%) subjects with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene alterations, either singly or with 
another co-occurring mutation, and 194 (45.8%) subjects with Other HRR gene alterations. The BRCA 
and Other HRR subgroups were based on Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) classification. All 
subjects who had a BRCA gene alteration, whether singly or as part of a co-occurring alteration, were 
considered part of the BRCA subgroup. Of note, 4 subjects who were randomized/stratified into the Other 
HRR subgroup were later found to have co-occurring BRCA gene alterations and were kept as per their 
original stratification in the primary and secondary analyses.

Cohort 1 
Primary endpoint 
This primary analysis of the rPFS primary efficacy endpoint by BICR was performed after 217 rPFS events 
had  been  observed  in  the  All  HRR  population,  with  109  rPFS  events  observed  in  the  BRCA  subgroup, 
which met the minimum requirement for rPFS events needed per the SAP. 
The CCO for this analysis was 08 October 2021, at which time the median duration of survival follow-
up for all subjects in Cohort 1 was 18.6 months.

The initial submission was based on the final analysis for the primary endpoint of rPFS which coincided 
with the first interim analysis for the secondary endpoints (PA-IA1). Since the initial submission the 
MAGNITUDE study accrued the required number of events to trigger the pre-specified second interim 
analysis for the secondary endpoints (IA2). All of the secondary endpoints (TSP, TCC, and OS) were 
formally statistically assessed at IA2. These results are presented below, with a clinical cut-off 17 
June 2022.

Other efficacy endpoints 
Updated data were provided for time to PSA progression, PFS2 and time to pain progression based on 
a 2IA (data cut-off 17 June 2022). Results of other efficacy endpoints presented below are based on 
the 1IA (08 October 2021).  
o  Time to PSA progression 
In the All HRR population (Cohort 1), substantial prolongation was observed in TPSA in subjects 
treated with nira+AAP group compared to the PBO+AAP group at IA2 (median 18.37 months nira+AAP 
vs 9.33 months PBO+AAP). The HR for the TPSA was 0.602 (95% CI: 0.462, 0.785); nominal 
p=0.0002.

o  Duration of response  
In the All HRR population, the median duration of response for subjects with a CR or PR as assessed by 
BICR among subjects with measurable disease at baseline was prolonged in the nira+AAP group; 
median 11.07 months in the nira+AAP group compared to 8.67 months in the PBO+AAP group. 
Results in the BRCA subgroup were consistent with the All HRR population, with a longer duration of 
response observed in the nira+AAP group compared the PBO+AAP group.

As patients with CDK12 alterations were initially enrolled into Cohort 2, a pre-planned sensitivity 
analysis including those 14 subjects with CDK12 gene alterations from Cohort 2 with all Cohort 1 
subjects was performed. While the results (by BICR) showed a statistically significant benefit for 
treatment with nira+AAP with a HR of 0.745; 95% CI: 0.572, 0.970; nominal p=0.0282 for rPFS, with 
a median rPFS of 15.70 months for the nira+AAP group and 13.67 months for the PBO+AAP group, the 
inclusion of these 14 subjects weakened the positive results slightly.  
Analyses of rPFS in the BRCA Subgroup by investigator 
An evaluation of the concordance between independent-BICR and investigator-assessed rPFS showed 
agreement in 89.4% of events in the nira+AAP group and 87.5% of events in the PBO+AAP group.

2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
A summary of subjects enrolled in controlled and non-controlled prostate cancer trials of niraparib (200 
mg) and AA (1,000 mg) plus prednisone/prednisolone in subjects with mCRPC by age group is 
provided in the table below. The only study to evaluate subjects in first-line mCRPC was MAGNITUDE. 
All other studies (QUEST, BEDIVERE, BA/BE) evaluated subjects receiving second-line or higher 
treatment for mCRPC.

2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
The Applicant has partnered with Foundation Medicine Inc. (FMI) and Agilent - Resolution Bioscience 
(RB) to develop two companion diagnostic assays (CDx), one tissue (FMI) and one plasma based (RB), 
to identify HRR gene alterations in patients who may be eligible for therapy. Both assays are next 
generation sequencing based in vitro diagnostic devices. The FMI FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx) 
diagnostic assay is CE-marked under the IVD Directive 98/79/EC (IVDD) and according to the 
Applicant is legally placed on the market. The Resolution Bioscience HRD diagnostic assay RB is also 
CE-marked under IVDD. These assays were used in the selection of patients for niraparib in the clinical 
studies within this application.  
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This application is mainly based on the pivotal Phase 3 Study 64091742PRC3001 (MAGNITUDE), a 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study that evaluated the efficacy and safety 
of niraparib in combination with AA and prednisone daily (nira+AAP) compared with placebo plus AAP 
(pbo+AAP) daily in subjects with mCRPC who had not received prior systemic therapy in the mCRPC 
setting. 
The study consisted of three cohorts. In Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 patients were randomised (1:1) to 
receive either nira+AAP (as monocomponents) or pbo+AAP. Cohort 1 included patients with HRR gene 
alterations while Cohort 2 included patients without HRR gene alterations. Both cohorts were double-
blind. There was a third cohort, Cohort 3, to assess the FDC of nira+AAP. This was open-label and 
enrolled patients with HRR gene alterations. In the context of the currently applied indication, the most 
relevant one is Cohort 1. Cohort 3 is planned to provide evidence on efficacy and safety of the FDC.  
Determination of HRR gene alteration status was required before randomisation (pre-screening). The 
panel of genes tested for inclusion in Cohort 1 was based on its higher frequency in prostate cancer 
and the biological plausibility to show benefit with the combination of niraparib and AAP.  
The comparator AA is considered appropriate in the context of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic men 
with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC since AAP is one of the SoC therapies in this setting and it is in fact 
one of the components of the FDC. The choice of the comparator was agreed during a scientific advice 
(SA) procedure in 2018 (EMEA/H/SA/3872/1/2018/HTA/II). However, the comparator would not be 
appropriate for patients with visceral metastases and/or asymptomatic disease. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 139/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The design of the MAGNITUDE trial seems to be adapted to the indication in asymptomatic/mildly 
symptomatic mCRPC patients with or without visceral metastases, who may have received 
chemotherapy in the hormone sensitive setting only.  
All patients enrolled in the study were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic at screening as required by 
the protocol of the study. However, at baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1), there were 36 (8.6%) patients with a 
BPI>3, that can be considered symptomatic. Efficacy data in the subgroup of patients with visceral 
metastasis and/or symptomatic disease who had not received prior chemotherapy, and in whom 
chemotherapy would therefore have been the most relevant comparator (i.e., instead of abiraterone), 
were provided during the assessment. Based on the submitted data no apparent differences in rPFS 
were observed between treatment arms neither in the HRR population (HR 0.958; 95% CI: 0.594, 
1.547), nor in the subgroup of BRCA mutated patients (HR 1.007; 95% CI: 0.501,2.023). In the OS 
analysis, data suggested no benefit and possibly a trend in disfavour of study treatment (HR 1.274; 
95% CI: 0.720,2.255) which seems more evident in the subgroup of patients with BRCA mutations (HR 
2.172; 95% CI: 0.971,4.855). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by the low 
number of study subjects involved and by the arbitrary subgroups based on multiple factors.  In any 
case, mCRPC patients in whom chemotherapy is clinically indicated are excluded from treatment with 
nira+AAP by the indication wording.  
Patients received 200 mg niraparib + 1000 mg AA + 10 mg prednisone in the nira+AAP arm and 
matching placebo plus AA and prednisone at the same doses in the pbo+AAP arm. The selected dose 
for abiraterone is the recommended dose in the currently approved indications of Zytiga. With regards 
to niraparib, a dose of 200 mg was chosen based on the results of the Phase 1 study 
64091742PCR1001 (BEDIVERE) in which doses of 200 mg and 300 mg of niraparib were tested in 
combination with abiraterone 1000 mg+ prednisone 10 mg. Since DLTs were reported with the 300 mg 
dose, while not with the 200 mg dose, and no significant differences in exposure were observed 
between both doses, the 200 mg dose was finally chosen as the RP2D for niraparib when administered 
in combination with abiraterone plus prednisone.  
Background  therapy  with  a  GnRHa  was  mandatory  for  patients  who  had  not  previously  undergone 
surgical castration. If, during the study, either study drug was permanently discontinued due to toxicity, 
the other study drug (niraparib/placebo or AA) could be continued. In the same way also in Cohort 3 
(FDC cohort), the use of the single agent medications was allowed in case of discontinuation of one of 
the drugs and if a dose reduction of AA was required (currently not reflected in the PI). Nevertheless, it 
is not believed that these adjustments of mono-components have impacted the efficacy outcome. It is 
noted that the proposed FDC allow limited flexibility in terms of dosing and management of treatment-
related toxicities by dose modification. 
In Cohort 1 randomisation was stratified by past exposure to taxane-based chemotherapy, AR targeted 
therapy, prior AAP use (yes or no) and by gene alteration group (i.e., BRCA1 or BRCA2 versus all other 
HRR gene alterations). 
The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  rPFS  as  assessed  by  BICR  according  to  RECIST  1.1.  for  soft 
tissues and PCWG3 criteria to assess changes in bone. OS was a secondary endpoint of the study. Other 
(key)  secondary  endpoints  were  time  to  initiation  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  (TCC)  and  time  to 
symptomatic progression (TSP). Other efficacy endpoints were time to PSA progression (TPSA), PFS2, 
time to pain  progression, ORR,  duration of  response,  PSA  response  rate  and  time  to  first-subsequent 
anticancer therapy. Overall, the primary and secondary endpoints are considered adequate. Even if OS 
would be the preferred primary endpoint, rPFS is also acceptable as agreed during the above mentioned 
SA procedure. The importance of collecting OS data and the need to provide sufficiently mature OS data 
at the time of submission was however also highlighted by the CHMP at that time. The fact that rPFS is 
assessed by a BIRC is reassuring.

Statistical methods 
A multiple testing procedure was employed across the primary endpoint of rPFS and the key secondary 
endpoints to preserve the family-wise type I error rate at the 2-sided 5% level. The primary endpoint 
was initially tested in the BRCA subgroup and if statistically significant then in the all Cohort 1 population. 
Since no interim analyses have been performed for the first 2 comparisons of the hierarchy (i.e., rPFS 
for BCRA and rPFS for Cohort 1), the full 5% of alpha was considered. Overall, the approach is considered 
acceptable.  
Two  interim  analyses  and  one  final  analysis  for  the  secondary  endpoints  of  TCC,  TSP  and  OS  were 
considered approximately when 100, 170 and 246 OS events had been observed. The Lan-DeMets alpha 
spending function with the O’Brien-Fleming approach is considered acceptable. The approach to control 
the overall type I error through different interim analyses is also endorsed.  
The  hypothesis  for  the  estimation  of  the  sample  size  in  the  different  cohorts  can  be  considered 
acceptable.  
Conduct of the study 
There have been 6 global amendments of the original version of the protocol (dated 22 Oct 2018). Of 
these,  Amendment  4  and  Amendment  6  are  considered  the  most  relevant  ones.  Of  note,  with 
Amendment 3 enrolment of subjects with ATM alterations was stopped, according to the Applicant due 
to external data that suggested limited benefit in these patients, but no further information has been 
provided in this regard. 
With protocol amendment 4 (dated 3 Jul 2020) the statistical analysis plan was modified and the BRCA 
mutated population became the primary efficacy population (i.e. population to be analysed first). Further, 
an additional biomarker (CKK12) was added to the panel of genes and Cohort 3 was included. Regarding 
amendment 6 (dated 30 Sep 2021), the analysis testing for the secondary endpoints was changed and 
a  2nd  IA  was  added.  Justification  on  the  reason/s  that  motivated  all  these  changes  provided  by  the 
Applicant was acknowledged.  
The number of major protocol deviations was low and balanced between treatment arms so it is unlikely 
that these deviations could have had an impact on the reported results.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Cohort 1 
At  the  time  of  the  DCO  for  the  primary  analysis  (8  October  2021),  48%  of  patients  were  ongoing 
treatment (54% in the nira+AAP arm and 42% in the pbo+AAP arm). The main reason for treatment 
discontinuation in both treatment arms was disease progression (34% and 51%, respectively). 
Baseline characteristics 
Patients included in the study had a median age of 69 years (range: 43, 100). Most of them were White 
(74%) and had an EOCG PS of 0 or 1. Around half of the patients was diagnosed in a metastatic stage 
and 68% had a Gleason score ≥8 at initial diagnosis. Testosterone levels (median) at baseline were 1.21 
(range: 0.1, 3.1) which suggest that some patients do not have castrate levels of testosterone (i.e. ≤50 
ng/dL  ≈  1.74  nmol/L).  According  to  the  Applicant  there  were  7  patients  with  testosterone  levels  >50 
ng/dL  as  per  central  laboratory  (6  in  the  control  arm  and  1  in  the  experimental  arm)  but  who  had 
testosterone  castrate  levels  as  per  local  laboratory  and  therefore  they  did  not  violate  the  inclusion 
criteria. Considering the low number of patients, it appears unlikely this may have had an impact on the 
results. 
EMA/126335/2023

At study entry most patients had bone metastases (83.5%), 21.3% had visceral metastases and 49.2% 
nodal metastases. Of note, the proportion of patients with visceral metastasis was slightly higher in the 
nira+AAP arm (24.1% vs 18.5%). BFI-SF pain score was 0 in 50% of patients and 1 to 3 in 41.3% of 
patients, as per the inclusion criteria. However, pain scores were reassessed at Cycle 1 Day 1, at which 
time 36 (8.6%) subjects had a pain score>3. Overall baseline characteristics were comparable between 
BRCA and non-BRCA subgroups. Of note, patients in the BRCA-mutated subgroup were slightly younger 
and a higher proportion of patients had received prior taxane-based chemotherapy and AAP. No other 
relevant differences have been observed. 
All patients included in Cohort 1 had a HRR gene alteration. There were 229 (54.1%) patients with BRCA1 
or  BRCA2  gene  alteration,  of  which  39  had  co-occurring  gene  alterations.  Regarding  other  HRR  gene 
alterations, ATM was the most common (85 [20.1%]). With Amendment 3 of the protocol, patients with 
ATM  alteration  were  no  longer  included  in  the  study.  Information  on  whether  these  mutations  were 
somatic or germline was not available since the assays used in the study were not able to distinguish 
between germline and somatic mutations.  
Regarding concomitant treatment, more than half of patients received analgesics in both treatment arm, 
including  opioids  but  the  number  of  patients  that  received  opioids  was  low  and  comparable  between 
treatment arms.  
Use of antihypertensive was higher in the nira+AAP arm, which is not unexpected taking into account 
the added toxicity of both niraparib and AAP. Approximately 29% of patients received drugs for treatment 
of bone disorders (including bisphosphonates and denosumab). Of note, the proportion of patients that 
received denosumab was almost double in the nira+AAP arm (15% vs 8%). 
At the cut-off date among patients who had discontinued study treatment (97 in the nira+AAP arm and 
123 in the pbo+AAP arm), 47% and 63% had received subsequent treatment, mainly chemotherapy. Of 
note, 13 patients in the pbo+AAP arm received subsequent treatment with a PARPi while only 1 in the 
nira+AAP arm.  
Outcomes  
As per the SAP, the primary endpoint rPFS, was assessed first in patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation 
(n=225) and if statistically significant then in the overall population (All HRR population; n=423)  
In  the  All  HRR  population  the  combination  of  nira+AAP  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant 
improvement in rPFS (BICR assessment) compared with pbo+AAP (HR 0.729; 95% CI: 0.556, 0.956), 
with a median rPFS of 16.46 months in the nira+AAP arm and 13.70 months in the pbo+AAP arm. At 
the time of DCO for the primary analysis (8 Oct 2021) the number of censored patients was 53% in the 
nira+AAP arm and 44.5% in the pbo+AAP arm. While the total number of rPFS events was higher in the 
placebo  arm,  there  was  a  notable  unbalance  in  the  number  of  early  deaths,  which  may  disfavour 
treatment with nira+AAP (16 deaths vs 8 deaths in the placebo arm, with only a few subjects censored, 
which correspond to approx. 4%-points). A discussion of this apparent imbalance, and any crossings of 
the survival curves (violation of proportional hazard assumption), was requested. After examining the 
reasons for the deaths that occurred during the first six months of treatment, no discernible pattern was 
found. Regarding proportional hazards no firm conclusions could be drawn. 
Despite radiological progression 52 (24.5%) patients in the niraparib arm and 66 (31.3%) patients in 
the placebo arm continued treatment beyond soft tissue disease progression. Median (range) treatment 
duration after progression was 2.91 (0.1, 12.0) months and 1.99 (0.0, 16.5) months, in the niraparib 
and  placebo  arm,  respectively.  Further,  there  were  29  (13.3%)  patients  in  the  niraparib  arm  and  39 
(18.5%) in the placebo arm that continued treatment beyond bone progression, with a median (range) 
treatment  exposure  of  4.60  (0.9,  13.0)  and  3.81  (0.5,  10.3)  months,  respectively.  Of  note,  bone 
progression  required  to  be  confirmed  ≥6  weeks  after  the  initial  scan.  The  proportion  of  patients  that 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 142/196 
 
 
  
 
 
received treatment beyond progression was comparable between treatment arms, although treatment 
exposure beyond progression was slightly longer in the niraparib arm. 
A sensitivity analysis of rPFS by the investigator was overall consistent with the primary analysis (HR 
0.644; 95% CI: 0.486, 0.855). Sensitivity analyses including patients CDK12 and without censoring for 
subsequent therapy were also consistent with the primary analysis.  
In the BRCA subgroup, the benefit of nira+AAP over pbo+AAP in terms of rPFS (BICR) was higher than 
in  the  overall  population  (HR  0.533;  95%  CI:  0.361,  0.789).  Median  rPFS  was  16.56  months  in  the 
nira+AAP arm and 10.87 months in the pbo+AAP arm.  
While a clear benefit was observed in BRCA mutated patients, the effect of the addition of niraparib to 
AAP was less clear in non-BRCA patients, in whom no apparent benefit was observed for rPFS (HR 0.994; 
95% CI: 0.681, 1.452). Median rPFS in this subgroup of patients was of 14.75 months in the nira+AAP 
arm and 16.36 months in the pbo+AAP arm and no separation of the KM curves was observed. Moreover, 
OS  data  in  the  non-BRCA  subgroup  based  on  the  2IA  suggested  a  potential  detrimental  effect  with 
nira+AAP  compared  with  placebo+AAP  (HR  1.162;  95%  CI:  0.761,  1.774),  with  median  OS  of  29.31 
months in the nira+AAP arm and not reached in the placebo+APP, although statistical significance was 
not reached. The reported results posed concerns on the potential benefit of nira+AAP in patients with 
non-BRCA  mutations,  which  represented  a  heterogeneous  subgroup  of  patients  with  different  type  of 
HRR  gene  alterations.  An  analysis  of  efficacy  data  by  gene  alteration  in  the  non-BRCA  subgroup  was 
provided.  However,  the  interpretation  of  results  was  hampered  by  the  small  size  of  the  subgroups. 
Moreover,  no  preclinical  data  have  been  presented  supporting  beneficial  effect  of  the  combination  of 
nira+AAP in castrate resistant tumour models harbouring other HRR alterations than BRCA. As a result, 
the  indication  was  restricted  to  the  population  with  a  BRCA  mutation,  in  whom  a  clear  benefit  was 
observed (see the finally agreed indication below). 
Key  secondary  endpoints  included  TCC,  TSP  and  OS.  Results  presented  at  the  time  of  submission, 
based on the first interim analysis (IA), showed a trend in favour of the nira+AAP arm for TCC and TSP 
in  the  HRR  population  although  statistical  significance  was  not  reached.  Regarding  OS  in  the  overall 
population, with 55 (25.9%) events in the nira+AAP arm and 59 (28.0%) in the pbo+AAP arm and a 
median  follow-up  of  18.6  months,  no  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  between 
treatment arms (HR 0.938; 95% CI: 0.648, 1.358); p=0.7333. The median OS was not reached in either 
treatment group and overlapping KM curves were observed. Results in the key secondary endpoint in 
the BRCA subgroup, were overall consistent with the observed in the overall population. 
Updated efficacy data of these secondary endpoints based on the 2IA (DCO 17 June 2022). showed a 
statistically significant improvement in TSP with nira+AAP over placebo+AAP in the HRR population (HR 
0.596; 95% CI: 0.422, 0.841; p=0.0029). Median TSP was not reached for nira+AAP and was of 30.62 
months for placebo+AAP. Results were consistent in the subgroup of BRCA-mutated patients (HR 0.544; 
95% CI: 0.347, 0.853).  
For TCC, positive results in favour of the nira+AAP arm were shown (HR 0.666; 95% CI 0.471, 0.942; 
p=0.0206),  although  statistical  significance  was  not  reached.  Median  TCC  was  not  reached  in  either 
treatment  arm.  An  improvement  in  TCC  was  seen  in  the  BRCA  subgroup  favouring  treatment  with 
nira+AAP (HR 0.558; 95% CI: 0.346, 0.900; nominal p=0.0152).  
At the time of the 2IA the number of OS events in the HRR population was of 90 (42.5%) in the nira+AAP 
arm and 89 (42.2%) in the placebo arm, with a high number of patients censored (around 57% in both 
treatment  arms).  Median  follow-up  was  26.8  months.  In  the  HRR  population  no  differences  were 
observed between treatment arms (HR 1.010; 95% CI: 0.751, 1.357) with longer median OS reported 
in the placebo arm (29.31 months nira+AAP vs. 32.2 months placebo+AAP). In the subgroup of BRCA-
mutated patients (n=225), with 38.1% events in the nira+AAP arm and 43.8% in the placebo+AAP arm, 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 143/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
a trend in favour of the nira+AAP was observed, although statistical significance was not reached (HR 
0.881;  95%  CI:  0.582,  1.335).  Median  OS  was  29.27  months  in  the  nira+AAP  arm  and  28.55  in  the 
placebo+AAP arm. Median follow-up was 24.80 months. The final analysis is expected to be submitted 
as Post approval efficacy study in 1Q 2024 (PAES).  
With regards to other secondary endpoints, at 1IA, positive results in favour of the experimental arm 
were  observed  in  TPSA  (HR  0.569;  95%  CI:  0.425,  0.760),  with  a  median  of  18.51  months  in  the 
nira+AAP  arm  vs  9.33  months  in  the  pbo+AAP  arm.  ORR  was  also  higher  in  patients  treated  with 
nira+AAP compared with pbo+AAP (59.8% vs 28.0%, respectively). However, no statistically significant 
differences between treatment arms were observed in PFS2 (HR 0.990; 95% CI: 0.698, 1.403) and time 
to initiation of subsequent therapy (HR 0.871; 95% CI: 0.614, 1.237),  
Updated efficacy data provided for TPSA, PFS2 and TTPP for both HRR population and BRCA population 
showed a delay in TPSA in the nira+AAP group compared with placebo+AAP (HR 0.602; 95% CI: 0.462, 
0.785), with a median TPSA of 18.33 months in the nira+AAP arm vs 9.33 months in the placebo+AAP 
arm. The improvement was higher in the subgroup of BRCA-mutated patients (HR 0.478; 95% CI: 0.328, 
0.696).  No  differences  were  observed  between  treatment  arms  in  the  HRR  population  for  PFS2  (HR 
0.964;  95%  CI:  0.723,  1.285).  In  the  BRCA-mutated  subgroup,  the  effect  on  PFS2  was  more 
pronounced,  although  statistical  significance  was  not  reached  (HR  0.785;  95%  CI:  0.528,  1.166). 
Consistent with PA-IA1, a trend towards prolongation in TTPP was observed with nira+AAP in the HRR 
population  (HR  0.894;  95%  CI:  0.647,  1.236)  and  the  BRCA  subgroup  (HR  0.701;  95%  CI:  0.439, 
1.118), although results were not statistically significant. 
With  regards  to  the  subgroup  analysis,  no  apparent  benefit  appears  to  be  derived  from  nira+AAP 
treatment over pbo+AAP in HRR population for patients <65 years, patients with visceral metastases 
and patients who received prior AAP treatment. However, due to the small number of patients included 
in these subgroups results should be interpreted with caution.  
Cohort 3 
The patient population included in Cohort 3 was overall comparable with patients enrolled in Cohort 1 
except  for  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  with  ECOG  1  (23%)  and  patients  with  visceral  metastases 
(14%). 
Results of key efficacy endpoints have been provided. However, at the time of the DCO, with a median 
follow-up of 5.5 months, data were immature with high censoring. Submission of 1-year efficacy data 
from Cohort 3  showed that primary endpoint and secondary endpoints were comparable to Cohort 1. 
However,  as  data  were  still  immature  (35-45%  maturity  in  rPFS  and  20-25%  in  OS)  the  Applicant  is 
recommended to submit the efficacy data (i.e., rPFS by BICR, TSP, TCC and OS) post-approval (PAM-
REC).  
Biomarker 
Blood and tumour tissue were required to be collected for determination of HRR gene alterations using 
one tissue and one plasma assay. Both next generation sequencing based in vitro diagnostic devices. 
Information  regarding  clinical  and  analytical  validation  of  biomarker  tests  was  provided.  Moreover, 
information on the concordance of HRR gene alteration status between tumour DNA and plasma ctDNA 
was provided. Discordances between tissue and ctDNA assays were observed. Of the number of patients 
tested (n=423), 291 and 277 were HRR positive as determined by tumour and ctDNA, respectively.  
The description of primary endpoint and relevant secondary endpoints according to central biomarker 
analytic  method  (tissue  vs  ctDNA),  including  K-M  plots,  has  been  provided.  Trends  in  primary  and 
secondary  endpoints  are  considered  comparable  in  both  biomarker  methods  to  overall  findings,  with 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 144/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
most  convincing  data  in  the  BRCA  subgroup.  A  notable  resemblance  in  numbers  was  seen  between 
tissue-based and ctDNA-based assays, since discordances between the tests are expected. The clinical 
validity  of  the  test  of  ctDNA  will  be  determined  when  the  survival  data  are  mature.  This  strategy  is 
according to SA [EMA/CHMP/SAWP/481577/2018] and considered acceptable. 
According  to  the  protocol,  exploratory  biomarker  assays  may  be  performed  (where  allowed  by  local 
regulations) to better define changes in tumour status over time. Results of these exploratory analyses 
should be provided once available (PAM-REC). 
The indication has been restricted to patients with BRCA 1/2 mutations. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In  the  study  MAGNITUDE,  the  combination  of  niraparib  +  AAP  showed  a  statistically  significant 
improvement in rPFS (BICR) compared with AAP alone in patients with mCRPC with HRR gene alterations 
(Cohort 1). An improvement in TSP and TCC was observed, although the latter did not reach statistical 
significance. Regarding (interim) OS data, although still relatively immature, no statistically significant 
differences  were  observed  between  treatment  arms.  Results  appeared  to  be  driven  by  patients  with 
BRCA 1/BRCA 2 mutations. In the subgroup of non-BRCA patients no apparent benefit in terms of rPFS 
and potential detrimental effect in OS was observed.  Consequently, the indication has been restricted 
to patients with BRCA 1/2 mutations and to those ‘in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated’. The 
final indication is (in combination with prednisone or prednisolone) for the treatment of adult patients 
with  metastatic  castration  resistant  prostate  cancer  (mCRPC)  and  BRCA1/2  mutations  in  whom 
chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety profile of the niraparib/AA fixed-dose combination + prednisone was established 
from the MAGNITUDE study Cohort 1. 
Cohort 1 provides the pivotal safety data and Cohort 3 provides a description of the clinical experience 
with the FDC tablet (DCO was 08-Oct-2021).  
Additionally, supportive safety data were provided from the Combined Single Agent Combination (SAC) 
Group (niraparib and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone single-agent combination), where data were 
integrated from studies MAGNITUDE Cohorts 1 and 2, QUEST Combination 2, and BEDIVERE. As 
different combinations and dosages were tested in these studies, safety data were only integrated from 
subjects whose starting dose was the intended registration dose of 200 mg niraparib and 1,000 mg AA 
plus 10 mg prednisone as SAC. Additional supportive safety data for the FDC tablets was provided from 
MAGNITUDE Cohort 3 to allow for a comparison to SAC.  
Safety data includes 473 subjects who received combination therapy with niraparib and abiraterone 
acetate plus prednisone: 378 subjects received individual products, referred to as niraparib and AAP 
single-agent combination (nira+AAP SAC) and 95 subjects received niraparib/AA fixed-dose 
combination tablets plus prednisone (FDC+P).  
During the procedure the Applicant submitted updated safety data based on the most recent DCO (17 
June 2022). Unless otherwise specified, all the safety data mentioned in the assessment report refer to 
the initial DCO (08 October 2021), which was overall in line with the safety data from the initial 
submission. Tables with the updated safety data are included after the tables provided in the initial 
assessment.

Deaths 
On-study treatment deaths were defined as a death occurring within 30 days of the last dose of study 
drug.  
As of the DCO date, 19 subjects (9%) in each treatment group had died while on treatment or within 
30 days of the last dose of study drug in Cohort 1. The most common cause of death on study 
treatment was progressive disease, with 12 deaths in the PBO+AAP group and 8 in the nira+AAP 
group. 
Of note, 12 subjects (5.7%) in the nira+AAP group and 7 subjects (3.3%) in the PBO+AAP group had 
TEAEs leading to death. The most common AE leading to death within 30 days of last dose of study 
drug was COVID-19. 
In addition to older age and prostate cancer, almost all patients who died due to COVID-19 had co-
morbidities and no patients had documentation that they were immunized to COVID-19. At the last 
recording of haematological lab values, none of the patients had clinically relevant leukopenia, 
neutropenia, or lymphopenia with the exception of one subject (in the PBO+AAP group), who had 
anaemia at the time of death due to COVID-19.   
According to the subject narratives presented in the SCS, only one of the non-COVID-19 related deaths 
in the niraparib/AAP arm was attributed to a TEAE of niraparib (pneumonia) by the investigators.

Haematology 
The majority of patients had no haematologic test abnormalities during treatment (Grade 0: 51.9% -
100%) across both arms of the MAGNTUDE cohort 1 study and the supportive studies, with the 
exception of anaemia (Grade 0: 14.0% - 28.4%).

Vital signs and Physical Examination Findings 
Vital signs were measured at baseline and regularly during treatment, according to the schedule noted 
in the protocol. Among the vital signs collected, only BP was noted as markedly abnormal. 
In the nira+AAP group, there were 46 subjects (21.8%) with systolic BP of >160 mm Hg and with a >20 
mm  Hg  increase  from  baseline  (classified  as  Grade  3  by  CTCAE  criteria),  however  only  31  subjects 
(14.6%) were considered to have a clinically significant value for a TEAE of hypertension to be reported 
as Grade 3. Alternatively, in the PBO+AAP group, there were 31 subjects (14.8%) with systolic BP of 
>160 mm Hg and with a >20 mm Hg increase from baseline (classified as Grade 3 by CTCAE criteria), 
with 26 subjects (12.3%) considered clinically significant for a TEAE of hypertension to be reported as 
Grade 3. No Grade 4 or 5 hypertension events were reported.

Age 
Age distribution in the different studies was comparable with only a slightly lower age distribution in 
the placebo + AAP arm of the MAGNITUDE cohort 1. In general, the incidence of AEs including Grade 3 
and 4 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of a study agent was higher in the age group > 75 
years within the niraparib + AAP arm and placebo + AAP arm in the MAGNITUDE cohort 1 and across

the supportive studies (Combined SAC group and MAGNITUDE cohort 3) compared to the younger age 
groups. The safety profiles in the different age categories in the Combined SAC group were consistent 
with the safety profile in the niraparib + AAP arm of cohort 1.

Hepatic impairment 
The assessment of treatment with niraparib + AAP in patients with hepatic impairment was based on 
PK studies which were conducted with the individual agents as part as their respective monotherapy 
program. No PK studies were conducted for the niraparib + AAP combination in this patient population. 
For further details on the assessment of clinical pharmacology, see section 2.6.2.

Adverse events leading to dose interruption 
In  MAGNITUDE  Cohort  1,  dose  interruption  of  any  study  agent  occurred  more  frequently  in  the 
niraparib/AAP arm compared with the placebo/AAP arm in the pivotal MAGNITUDE cohort 1 study (45.8% 
vs. 23.2%). 
In  MAGNITUDE  Cohort  3,  the  most  common  TEAEs  leading  to  dose  interruption  was  anaemia  in  14 
patients (15%).  
With nira+AAP treatment, the majority of patients (>90%) with dose interruptions due to the preferred 
term  of  anaemia  was  able  to  remain  on  treatment.  In  MAGNITUDE  Cohort  1,  anaemia  caused  dose 
interruption in 49 patients but only led to treatment discontinuation in 5 patients. (Table 131).

Adverse events leading to dose reduction 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction of any component of combination therapy (niraparib/placebo, AA, or 
prednisone) occurred in 58 patients in the nira+AAP arm (27%) and 20 patients in the PBO+AAP arm 
(9.5%) in MAGNITUDE Cohort 1.  
In the nira+AAP arm, anaemia caused dose reduction in 28 patients (13.2%) only for niraparib 
(without modification of AAP) and led to treatment discontinuation in 5 patients (2.4%).

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
At the DCO (8th October 2021), a higher proportion of patients remained on treatment in the niraparib 
arm of MAGNITUDE Cohort 1 compared with the placebo arm: 54.2% vs. 41.7% . The most frequently 
reported reason for treatment discontinuation in both arms was progressive disease (34.0% in the 
niraparib arm vs. 51.2% in the placebo arm). This suggests that the addition of niraparib has a 
positive impact in terms of decreasing the probability of experiencing progressive disease. However, it 
should be noted that a considerably higher proportion of patients in the niraparib arm discontinued the 
treatment due to AEs in comparison with the placebo arm (9.0% vs. 3.8%), which implies that the 
addition of niraparib, although apparently decreasing the percentage of patients suffering from 
progressive disease, it also significantly increases the toxicity of the combination.   
The duration of study treatment (median) was slightly longer in the niraparib arm compared to the 
placebo arm: 13.8 months vs. 12.1 months. Only 16 patients (7.5%) received the study treatment for 
24 months or longer. Considering that the proposed fixed-dose combination is intended for long term 
treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity, the Applicant was requested to submit updated 
safety data from the MAGNITUDE study, with a longer follow up to clarify remaining uncertainties 
concerning unfavourable effects. The submitted safety data included 378 subjects, who received 
individual products, referred to as niraparib and AAP single-agent combination (nira+AAP SAC) and 95 
subjects, who received niraparib/AA FDC tablets plus prednisone (FDC+P). Taking into account the 
available information on the SAC and the established safety profiles of the single agents, the submitted 
safety data for the FDC is considered acceptable.  
Regarding baseline characteristics, overall, the demographic characteristics were balanced between the 
treatment arms, except for a slightly higher proportion of patients ≥ 75 years old (29.7% vs. 23.2%), 
ECOG PS of 1 and with visceral disease in the niraparib arm compared to the placebo arm.

Adverse events 
Safety data supporting the current application are based on studies in a low number of patients, 
restricting the possibility to detect less common ADRs. Further, due to the overall short treatment 
duration, especially in the FDC cohort, long-term safety data are limited. This translates in 
uncertainties when characterising the safety profile of Akeega however these limitations are to a 
certain extent counterbalanced by the well-characterized safety profiles of the individual compounds 
(abiraterone and niraparib) which are comparable, in terms of ADRs, with the safety profile of Akeega. 
Of note, only two new ADRs have been identified in the present application (lymphophenia and 
pulmonary embolism), which is indicative of this consistency. The percentages experiencing an AE or 
AEs considered as related by the investigator in the MAGNITUDE Cohort 3 (FDC) were similar or lower 
than the percentages reported in the niraparib arm of MAGNITUDE Cohort 1, which is reassuring 
because it suggests that the administration of the FDC does not translate into a worse tolerability 
profile. However, the significantly shorter treatment exposure in Cohort 3, should be taken into 
account in this respect. The percentages of patients who reported causally-related AEs, SAEs and 
causally-related SAEs, and G3-4 AEs were considerably higher in the niraparib arm compared to the 
placebo arm. The difference between arms was around 10% in the case of SAEs, and around 20% in 
the case of causally-related AEs and G3-4 AEs. 
Concerning treatment-related adverse events, no major changes were identified, between the two 
arms, regardless of causality assessment. The safety profile remained consistent with already known 
safety profile of the individual components of the FDC.   
The higher frequency of Grade 3-4 TEAEs in the niraparib arm compared to the placebo arm (67% vs. 
46.4%) in MAGNITUDE Cohort 1 was mainly due to higher incidences of TEAEs in the SOC ‘Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders’ (33% vs. 9.0%) and in particular anaemia (30% vs. 7.6%) and 
neutropenia (6.6% vs. 1.4%). Haematological adverse events, including anaemia and neutropenia, are 
well-known ADRs associated with niraparib and other PARP inhibitors. Similar findings were observed in 
the Combined SAC Group and MAGNITUDE Cohort 3.  
There were 99.1% of patients in the niraparib arm vs. 94.3% in the placebo arm that reported 1 or 
more AEs occurring with frequency of at least 5%. AEs belonging to “Gastrointestinal disorders” SOC 
were the AEs most commonly reported in the niraparib arm, accounting for 59.0% in this arm, vs. 
45.5% in the placebo arm. The differences were especially marked in the following PTs: constipation 
(30.7% in the niraparib arm vs. 13.7% in the placebo arm), nausea (23.6% vs. 13.7%) and vomiting 
(13.2% vs. 6.6%). AEs belonging to “Blood and lymphatic system disorders” were the second AEs 
most commonly reported in the niraparib arm, accounting for 56.1% in this arm, vs. 28% in the 
placebo arm. Of note, some of the differences between arms were considerably marked: anaemia was 
reported in 46.2% patients in the niraparib arm vs. 20.4% patients in the placebo arm, 
thrombocytopenia in 21.2% vs. 8.5% patients, neutropenia in 13.7% vs. 5.7% patients, leukopenia in 
10.4% vs. 2.4% patients, and lymphopenia in 9.0% vs. 1.9% patients. Other common (≥20%) adverse 
events reported in the niraparib arm were hypertension (31.1% in the niraparib arm vs. 20.9% in the 
placebo arm) and fatigue (26.4% vs. 16.6%). 
It should be noted that TEAEs in the SOC “Infections and infestations” were more frequent (39.6%) in 
the niraparib arm of (Cohort 1) than in the placebo arm (26.1%), which was also consistent with the 
higher incidence of grade 3-4 TEAEs (14.6% vs. 6.2%). Therefore, it seems that patients in the 
niraparib arm were more vulnerable to infections and had a more serious outcome than patients in the 
placebo group. While hematological toxicities associated with PARP inhibitors (in particular neutropenia 
and leukopenia) may increase the risk of infections and exacerbate disease progression, no clinical link 
between haematological events (neutropenia) and the higher incidence of infections, including with 
serious outcomes, in the niraparib arm of the MAGNITUDE study, was identified. However, scientific 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 182/196 
 
 
  
 
 
research has established critical roles of the PARP enzyme family including PARP1, the main target of 
niraparib, in regulating innate and adaptive immune responses, in particular viral infections by 
multifaceted mechanisms. Consequently, a causative mechanistic link between niraparib and the 
increased risk of serious infections, which is not related to neutropenia or leukopenia events, could 
theoretically be plausible. Therefore, a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC, including 
mitigating measures concerning this risk.  
Generally, common AEs experienced by mCRPC patient treated with niraparib and abiraterone were 
consistent with the known ADRs of niraparib and abiraterone monotherapies, as described in their 
respective SmPCs, and potential symptoms of the underlying disease. However, two new ADRs were 
identified: lymphophenia and pulmonary embolism.  
Lymphopenia was included as an ADR due to the significantly higher frequency occurring in the 
niraparib arm compared with the placebo arm in MAGNITUDE Cohort 1 (9.0% vs. 1.9%). No 
concurrent event of infection was reported within 7 days. 
Pulmonary embolism was reported with a higher frequency in the niraparib arm (4.7%) as compared 
with the placebo arm (0.9%) in MAGNITUDE Cohort 1. Pulmonary embolism occurred approximately 5 
times more frequently in the niraparib arm of the MAGNITUDE cohort 1 study, which is further 
reflected in the higher incidence of serious cases of pulmonary embolism in the treatment arm 
compared with the placebo arm (1.9% vs. 0.5 %). Likewise, other forms of embolism were more 
frequent in the niraparib arm than the placebo arm; TEAEs: 4 patients (1.9%) vs 1 (0.5%); and SAEs: 
1 patient (0.5%) vs. no patient. However, it does not seem that any other thromboembolic event in 
particular was reported with a marked higher frequency in the niraparib arm vs. the placebo arm. 
Since pulmonary embolism can constitute a serious to life-threatening condition if not discovered and 
treated timely, a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
In MAGNITUDE Cohort 1 SAEs were reported with more than 10% of difference between arms: 35.8% 
vs. 24.6%. In the context of an aged population (median age: 69.0) this increase is not negligible and 
highlights the fact that the addition of niraparib implies a considerable worse toxicity profile.  
In MAGNITUDE Cohort 1, the higher incidence of serious TEAEs in the niraparib arm compared with the 
placebo arm was mainly driven by the SOC “Infections and infestations” (11.3% in the niraparib arm 
vs. 6.6% in the placebo arm), “Blood and lymphatic systems disorders” (8% vs. 1.9%) and “Cardiac 
disorders” (4.7% vs. 3.8%). The most frequently reported SAE in the niraparib arm was anaemia 
(5.7% vs. 0.9% in the placebo arm) and pneumonia (3.3% vs. 1.9% in the placebo arm). In the 
placebo arm only two SAEs occurred >1% (pneumonia: 1.9% and myocardial infarction: 1.4%). 
The higher incidence of pulmonary embolism in the MAGNITUDE cohort 3 (3.2%) compared to 
MAGNITUDE Cohort 1 (1.9%) and the Combined SAC Pool (2.1%) is noted.

Deaths during treatment were reported with a similar frequency in both arms (9.0%). However, there 
were more subjects who had TEAEs leading to death in the niraparib arm than in the placebo arm: 
5.7% vs. 3.3%. Of those deaths, only one ,in the niraparib arm, was considered as related to the study 
agent,. Of note, there were no on-treatment deaths due to “unknown cause” in any arm.  
In terms of SOCs, no particular trend was observed. Importantly, deaths belonging to “cardiac 
disorders” SOC were balanced between the two arms. However, it should be noted that an imbalance 
in the “infections and infestations” SOC is observed (3.3% vs. 0.9%), mainly driven by COVID-19 
deaths. The trend towards a higher rate of infections with severe outcome (including deaths) was 
further confirmed by the updated safety data provided by the Applicant during the assessment, where 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 183/196 
 
 
  
 
 
8 additional FU months were provided. Of note, during the period of time between October 2021 and 
June 2022 there were 6 additional deaths reported in this SOC in the niraparib arm, vs. no additional 
death reported in the placebo arm; and 4 of those additional deaths were due to “COVID-19” or 
“COVID-19 pneumonia”. As such, it is clear that there is an imbalance between the two arms, which 
has been further confirmed after a longer follow-up (6.1% vs. 0.9%). A warning has been included in 
in section 4.4. 
Additionally, in the niraparib arm there was a death due to completed suicide which suggested a 
potential link to niraparib, also taking into account that “depression” is listed in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC of niraparib. However, after reviewing additional evidence provided by the Applicant, it has been 
considered very complicated to isolate niraparib’s contribution to the occurrence of suicidal behaviours 
/ thoughts, considering the emotional impact that metastatic cancer can have on patients’ mental well-
being.     
A death caused by pulmonary embolism (accompanied by acute heart failure and acute pulmonary 
failure) occurred in the Combine SAC Pool, which was not categorised as related to the study 
treatment by the investigator. After further assessment, it was agreed that there were too many 
confounding factors to draw any conclusion on the causal role of niraparib. Its potential role or at least 
partial contribution could not be fully discarded. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)  
AESIs were more common with combination therapy compared to the monotherapies, occurring in 
80% of the niraparib+abiraterone arm and 58% of the placebo+abiraterone arm in MAGNITUDE 
Cohort 1, 79% of the Combined SAC Group, and 60% of MAGNITUDE Cohort 3. 
Overall, the AESIs are sufficiently addressed in the section “Description of selected adverse reactions” 
in 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Cerebrovascular events were initially reported with a higher frequency in the niraparib arm than in the 
placebo arm (2.8% vs. 0.9%). With the safety update, these events were reported in 3.3% patients in 
the niraparib arm vs. 1.9% in the placebo arm. 2 out of 7 incidences of cerebrovascular events in the 
niraparib arm were considered serious, however not related to the study drug. The remaining 5 
incidences of cerebrovascular events were considered non-serious, and all except one were assessed to 
be not related.  
Despite some differences, the safety profile of BRCA and Non-BRCA subgroups was overall comparable.  
Discontinuation due to AEs 
As expected, treatment discontinuations were higher in the niraparib+abiraterone arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Regarding haematology laboratory abnormalities during treatment, all parameters (including G1-2 and 
G3-4 events) were significantly increased in the niraparib arm compared with the placebo arm. 
Anaemia was the most commonly reported G3-abnormality in the niraparib arm.  
Chemistry laboratory abnormalities that occurred during treatment were mostly Grade 1 or 2. It is 
noted that grade 3 increased ALT was markedly more frequent in the placebo arm (5.2%) than in the 
niraparib arm (0.5%). In general, there was a higher frequency of the grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity 
laboratory findings (“ALT increased” and “AST increased”) in the placebo than in the niraparib arm. 
Regarding these data, the Applicant confirmed that no additional toxicity was observed with the 
combination of nira+AAP compared to placebo+AAP and found the difference to be coincidental.  
Safety in special populations 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 184/196 
 
 
  
 
 
Concerning age, no significant differences were observed among subgroups. As expected, the 
percentage of SAEs and AEs leading to death increases in both arms as patients are older. It is noted 
that the number of patients especially in the higher age groups are low, which makes the results 
uncertain.  
Regarding race and geographical region no conclusion could be drawn due to the difference in the size 
of subgroups.  
Regarding hepatic impairment, no PK studies were conducted for the niraparib+abiraterone 
combination in patient with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Based on the SmPC of the 
mono-component Niraparib (Zejula) and Abiraterone (Zytiga), in line with the Guideline On Summary 
Of Product Characteristics (SmPC) Rev.2, a contraindication in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
is reflected in the SmPC of Akeega.   
Updated safety data 
Updated safety data have been provided for Cohort 1, with 8.2 months of additional follow-up (median 
treatment duration 17.9 months in the nira+AAP arm and 15.2 months in the placebo+AAP arm). 
Overall, the updated safety data are in line with the data already provided, although frequencies were 
overall higher than previously reported and some increased considerably in the niraparib arm (AEs 
leading to death, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, G3-4 AEs, COVID AEs and 
COVID SAEs). An increase in the incidence of infections and infestations was observed (24.1% in the 
niraparib arm and 15.2% in the placebo arm in IA2, compared with 17.5% in the niraparib arm and 
10.0% in the placebo arm). This difference was mainly driven by COVID cases.  
The  Applicant  submitted  updated  safety  data  from  Cohort  3  of  the  MAGNITUDE  study  with  a  median 
duration of the study treatment of 17.5 months. Data submitted were consistent with the data previously 
reported for this cohort with overall only a very slight increase in overall AEs, grade 3 and 4 AEs, SAEs 
and  AESIs  compared  to  the  previous  CCO  (IA2)  and  in  line  with  the  reported  data  for  Cohort  1.  The 
Applicant  is  recommended  to  provide  the  final  safety  data  from  MAGNITUDE  Cohort  3  post-approval 
(PAM-REC). 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The addition of niraparib to abiraterone translates into a worse tolerability profile, with an increase in 
treatment-related AEs, SAEs, Aes of grade 3-4 and Aes leading to treatment discontinuation.  
Overall, the safety profile of the combination appears quite consistent with the already known safety 
profile of the mono-components. Of note, several of the well-known toxicities of both agents overlap, 
while some haematological events, such as anaemia, considerably exacerbated. However, overall, it 
seems that G4 events / SAEs due to this overlapping toxicity are not frequent, and that they can be 
properly managed by means of dose modifications or interruptions. Two new ADRs have been 
identified for the combination: pulmonary embolism and lymphopenia.  
In terms of deaths no particularly worrisome trend is observed, apart from the imbalance of COVID-
related deaths for which a warning is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  The combination of 
niraparib and abiraterone/prednisone is associated with a worsening of the toxicity profile of 
abiraterone/prednisone alone, although it seems to be acceptable and manageable.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
It is considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The active substance is not included in the EURD list and a new entry will be required. The new EURD 
list entry uses the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. The requirements for 
submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, 
Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request an alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is not determined yet. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A full user consultation has been performed on the Akeega 100mg/500 mg film-coated tablets patient 
leaflet. Three rounds of testing have been performed. Based on the results from round 2, amendments 
to the package leaflet to improve readability of one of the key safety messages was implemented. 
These amendments were tested in round 3, meeting the requirements set. 
A bridging report was submitted for the 50mg/500mg patient leaflet. Overall, the user consultation 
presented by the Applicant met the requirements for user testing and is considered acceptable 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The finally approved indication for the fixed-dose combination (FDC) of niraparib plus abiraterone 
acetate is the following:   
“Akeega is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and BRCA1/2 mutations (germline and/or 
somatic) in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.”   
Disease or condition 
Worldwide, prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer 
death in men (IARC 2020). In Europe, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, 
representing 20.2% of all cancers in men and 10% of cancer deaths in 2020. 
Patients diagnosed at an early stage are amenable to curative therapy, however advanced stages are 
life-threatening. For patients diagnosed with metastatic disease, the 5-year survival rate is 30% 
(American Cancer Society 2021, Siegel 2021). 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 190/196 
 
 
  
 
 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment options for patients with mCRPC include abiraterone acetate (with prednisone or 
prednisolone) and enzalutamide for chemotherapy naïve patients who are asymptomatic or mildly 
symptomatic and in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated (ESMO 2020; NCCN 2022). For 
symptomatic patients or patients with signs of rapid progression or visceral metastases despite lack of 
symptoms, initial use of docetaxel may be preferred. The radionuclide radium-223 may be used in 
patients with bone-predominant symptomatic metastatic CRPC. In the post-docetaxel setting, 
cabazitaxel is also a treatment option, as well as abiraterone and enzalutamide. 
In patients with bone metastasis, use of bisphosphonate or denosumab is recommended to prevent 
skeletal-related events.  
Patients with HRR gene alterations who have not received therapy for mCRPC (first line treatment) and 
are currently managed in the same manner as other patients with mCRPC who do not harbour an HRR 
alteration. Of note, olaparib, a PARPi, is currently approved in the EU in the second line setting (i.e., 
following prior therapy with new hormonal agents) in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations and in 
combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of patients with mCRPC in 
whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
The evidence in support of this application is based on the results of the Study 64091742PRC3001 
(MAGNITUDE). This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of niraparib 
in combination with AA and prednisone daily (nira+AAP) compared with placebo plus AAP (pbo+AAP) 
daily in subjects with mCRPC who had not received prior systemic therapy in the mCRPC setting. 
The study consists of three cohorts. Data presented below correspond to the 225 patients with 
BRCA1/2 mutations included in Cohort 1, who were randomised (1:1) to receive either nira+AAP 
(n=113) or pbo+AAP (n=112). Cohort 3 (n=95), open-label, provides evidence on the efficacy and 
safety of the fixed-dose combination (FDC). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the BRCA subgroup, the primary endpoint rPFS (BICR) showed a statistically significant effect 
favouring nira+AAP over pbo+AAP (HR 0.533; 95% CI: 0.361, 0.789). Median rPFS was 16.56 
months in the nira+AAP arm and 10.87 months in the pbo+AAP arm. 
Secondary endpoints TCC and TSP also favoured the nira+AAP arm, with a HR of 0.558(95% CI: 
0.346,0.900) and 0.544 (95% CI: 0.347, 0.853), respectively. For what concern OS, no statistically 
significant differences were observed between treatment arms for OS in the BRCA subgroup (HR 
0.961; 95% CI: 0.565, 1.633) at the 1IA but a trend in favour of the nira+AAP was observed at 2IA 
(~42% maturity) although statistical significance was not reached.   
In Cohort 3 (FDC), which included a proportion of BRCA mutations were comparable in Cohort 1 
(approx. 53%) and Cohort 3 (approx. 55%), the event-free rates for rPFS by BICR and OS at 1 year 
were comparable to those obtained for Cohort 1. 'The  
With regards to the relevance of the FDC formulation, bioequivalence of the regular strength (niraparib 
100 mg/abiraterone acetate 500 mg) to single agent combination has been adequately demonstrated. 
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 191/196 
 
 
  
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
At the time of the DCO for the primary analysis OS data were immature (25.9% events in the 
nira+AAP arm and 28.0% in the pbo+AAP arm) and no statistically significant differences were 
observed between treatment arms in the BRCA subgroup (HR 0.961; 95% CI: 0.565, 1.633). Updated 
data, based on the 2IA for OS (~42% maturity) showed a trend in favour of the nira+AAP, although 
statistical significance was not reached and uncertainties remain on the long term efficacy.  To further 
evaluate the efficacy of Akeega, the MAH should submit the final clinical study report, including the 
final analysis of overall survival results and other long-term endpoints from the MAGNITUDE study 
(PAES). 
For what concern the biomarker assessment, the description of primary endpoint and relevant secondary 
endpoints according to central biomarker analytic method (tissue vs ctDNA), including K-M plots, has 
been provided. Trends in primary and secondary endpoints are considered comparable in both biomarker 
methods (tissue vs ctDNA) to overall findings, nevertheless the clinical validity of ctDNA test of will be 
determined when the survival data are mature. According to the protocol, exploratory biomarker assays 
may be performed (where allowed by local regulations) to better define changes in tumour status over 
time. Results of these exploratory analyses should be provided once available (REC). 
For what concern the results of key efficacy endpoints provided for Cohort 3 of Magnitude study (FDC), 
at the time of the DCO, with a median follow-up of 5.5 months, data were immature with high 
censoring. To address this uncertainty the Applicant is recommended to submit the efficacy data (i.e., 
rPFS by BICR, TSP, TCC and OS) post-approval (REC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of the combination appears quite consistent with the already known safety 
profile of the mono-components. Of note, several of the well-known toxicities of both agents overlap, 
leading to an increased frequency of some AEs, especially haematological toxicities and hypertension: 
anaemia was reported in 46.2% patients vs. 20.4% patients, thrombocytopenia in 21.2% vs. 8.5% 
patients, neutropenia in 13.7% vs. 5.7% patients, leukopenia in 10.4% vs. 2.4% patients, 
lymphopenia in 9.0% vs. 1.9% patients, and hypertension in 31.1% vs. 20.9% patients. However, 
overall it seems that G4 events / SAEs due to this overlapping toxicity are not frequent, and that they 
can be properly managed by means of dose modifications or interruptions.  
Two new ADRs were identified for the combination treatment in the MAGNITUDE study (niraparib vs 
placebo-arm): lymphopenia (9.0% vs 1.9%)) and pulmonary embolism (4.7% vs 0.9%)). Pulmonary 
embolism has also been previously reported for other PARP inhibitors. 
The percentages of patients who reported causally-related AEs, SAEs and causally-related SAEs, and 
G3-4 AEs were markedly higher in the niraparib arm than in the placebo arm. 
The incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs was of 67% in the niraparib arm and 46.4% in the placebo arm. 
Anaemia (30% vs. 7.6%) and hypertension (15% vs. 12%) were the most commonly reported in the 
niraparib arm (≥10%). SAEs were reported 36% in the niraparib arm vs. 25% in the placebo arm. By 
PT, the most frequently reported SAE in the niraparib arm was anaemia (5.7% vs. 0.9%), followed by 
pneumonia (3.3% vs. 1.9%) and COVID-19 (4.72% vs. 1.4%; including COVID-19 pneumonia). 
Regarding deaths, treatment emergent adverse events leading to death occurred in 12 (5.7%) patients 
in the niraparib arm and 7 (3.3%) patients in the placebo arm. Of note, an imbalance in the “infections 
and infestations” SOC is observed (3.3% vs. 0.9%), mainly driven by COVID-19 deaths.  
EMA/126335/2023  
Page 192/196 
 
 
  
 
 
A higher percentage of patients in the niraparib arm had 1 or more AEs leading to discontinuation of 
any component of the combination: 10.8% vs. 6.2%. The most frequently reported SOC in the 
niraparib arm was “Infections and infestations” (3.8%), mainly driven by “COVID-19” and “COVID-19 
pneumonia”. Of note, “anaemia” was the reason for discontinuation of 2.4% of patients in the niraparib 
arm vs. 0.5% in the placebo arm. 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction and interruption of any study treatment (niraparib, placebo, 
abiraterone or prednisone/prednisolone), were more frequent in the niraparib arm than in the placebo 
arm of MAGNITUDE cohort 1 (27.4% vs. 9.5%; 45.8% vs. 23.2%, respectively), driven mainly by 
haematologic events with anaemia accounting for dose interruptions in 49 patients (23%) and for dose 
reductions in 28 patients (13%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties about unfavourable effects remain for the FDC treatment due to the premature nature of 
the safety data set in the MAGNITUDE FDC cohort 3. Updated safety data are expected to be provided 
post-approval (REC). 
The pharmacokinetic properties of niraparib and abiraterone as a fixed-dose combination have been 
characterised using several clinical studies in healthy subjects and cancer patients. Several issues were 
identified regarding the demonstration of bioequivalence for the LS-FDC and some uncertainties remain 
regarding the potential higher exposure of abiraterone with the LS-FDC. This potential higher exposure 
is adequately communicated in the SmPC.

Notes:  
a p-value is from a log-rank test stratified by stratification factors: past taxane-based chemotherapy exposure (yes 
versus no) and prior AAP use (yes versus no). 
b Hazard ratio is from stratified proportional hazards model. Hazard ratio <1 favours niraparib + AAP treatment. 
c p-value is from a log-rank test stratified by stratification factors: past taxane-based chemotherapy exposure (yes 
versus no), prior AAP use (yes versus no), and gene alteration group (BRCA1 or BRCA2 versus all other HRR). 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the MAGNITUDE study the combination of niraparib + AAP demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in rPFS (BICR) compared with AAP alone in patients with mCRPC with BRCA 1/BRCA 2 
mutations. A trend in favour of the experimental arm was also observed in the key secondary 
endpoints of TCC and TSP, although statistical significance was only reached for TSP. Sensitivity 
analyses were overall consistent with the primary analysis.   
Even if OS data were still immature no differences were observed between treatment arms at the 1IA 
and a trend in favour of the nira+AAP was observed in the updated OS data submitted.  To further 
characterize the efficacy of niraparib in combination with abiraterone acetate, the Applicant will provide 
the final clinical study report, including the final analysis of overall survival results and other long-term 
endpoints from the MAGNITUDE study by 1 Q of 2024 (see Annex II).

The submitted efficacy and safety data for the FDC (MAGNITUDE cohort 3) showed results in line with 
Cohort 1, however, updated efficacy and safety data are recommended to be submitted post-approval 
(REC). 
From a safety point of view, the safety profile of the combination appears consistent with the already 
known safety profile of the mono-components nevertheless the addition of niraparib to abiraterone 
translates into a worse tolerability profile, with an increase in treatment-related AEs, SAEs, AEs of 
grade 3-4 and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and overlapping of toxicities. Two new ADRs 
have been identified and included in the SmPC (pulmonary embolism and lymphopenia).  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Niraparib + abiraterone has demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement 
in rPFS in patients with mCRPC and BRCA1/2 mutations supported by secondary endpoints. Even 
though there are currently uncertainties on the magnitude of the benefit in terms of OS, the results are 
considered clinically relevant and sufficient to conclude on clinical benefit in the intended treatment 
setting. 
The safety profile of niraparib plus abiraterone is well characterize and is consistent with the safety 
profile of the mono-components except for two new ADRs identified and included in the SmPC. It can 
be concluded that the benefits outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Establishing the benefit of the combination in HRR subgroups is challenging, due to the small sample 
that leads to wide CIs. Although data are still immature, a detrimental effect in OS cannot be ruled out 
in the non-BRCA patients. Therefore, the indication has been restricted to the population with BRCA 
alterations, in which a clear benefit is established. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of Akeega with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and BRCA1/2 mutations in 
whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated is positive. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
In order to further characterise the efficacy of Akeega to be used in combination with prednisone or 
prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC) and BRCA1/2 mutations (germline and/or somatic) in whom chemotherapy is not clinically 
indicated, the MAH should submit the final overall survival data and other long-term endpoints from 
the MAGNITUDE study.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of AKEEGA is favourable in the following indication:

Extension application to introduce a new strength (45/200 mg film-coated tablets) and a new pharmaceutical 
form (granules) associated with new strengths (33.75/150 and 45/200 mg). The new presentations are 
indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in patients aged 3 to <12 years.  
The extension application is grouped with a type II variation (C.I.6.a) to include paediatric use in patients 
aged 3 to < 12 years to the existing presentations of 90/400 mg film-coated tablets. Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated to support the extended indication. The RMP (version 5.3) is updated in 
accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial updates and linguistic 
corrections throughout the Product Information. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
2.1.1.1.  Epidemiology 
Hepatitis C virus infection is a global health challenge with an estimated global prevalence of 1%, for a total 
of 71 million individuals worldwide chronically infected with HCV (The Polaris Observatory HCV Collaborators 
2017), (World Health Organization (WHO) 2018b). In the US, over 3 million people are estimated to be 
chronically infected with HCV (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2016), and in Europe an estimated 
Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 7/51 
  
  
 
 
10 to 14 million people have chronic HCV infection (The Polaris Observatory HCV Collaborators 2017), (World 
Health Organization (WHO) 2018c). Up to 85% of individuals infected with HCV fail to clear the virus and 
progress to chronic infection; over the ensuing 20 years, as many as 20% of patients with chronic HCV 
infection are estimated to develop complications, including cirrhosis, end stage liver disease, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Curing HCV infection is associated with numerous health benefits, including 
more than 70% reduction in the risk of HCC and 90% reduction in the risk of liver-related mortality and liver 
transplantation (Morgan 2013), (van der Meer 2012), (Veldt 2007), (Poynard 2002). 
The estimated prevalence of HCV infection in children is up to 0.4% in Europe and the US and up to 6% in 
resource-limited countries (El-Shabrawi 2013), (Khaderi 2014). Globally, it is estimated that approximately 
2.1 to 3.5 million individuals 15 years of age or younger are chronically infected with HCV (Nwaohiri 2018), 
(European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2018). 
2.1.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The primary mechanism of HCV infection in children is vertical transmission, with parenteral transmission 
secondary. Following vertical transmission of HCV, in the absence of treatment, approximately 20% to 40% 
of children clear the infection spontaneously, usually in the first 4 to 7 years of life, whereas the remaining 
60% to 80% develop chronic infection that persists into adulthood (Mack 2012), (Indolfi 2018). 
2.1.1.3.  Clinical presentation 
The natural history of chronic HCV infection in children is generally similar to that in adults, although HCV 
infection in children is typically relatively mild (Squires 2017). Most children chronically infected with HCV are 
asymptomatic or have mild, nonspecific symptoms. Clinical symptoms are present in approximately 20% of 
children in the first 4 years of life, with hepatomegaly being the most frequent sign (10%). Many, but not all, 
perinatally-infected children will have intermittently or persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
or aspartate aminotransferase levels, particularly in the first 2 years of life. In children with vertical HCV 
infection who have undergone liver biopsy, the histological spectrum is usually mild, although severe liver 
disease is encountered {Mohan 2010}. Despite the overall more favorable prognosis compared with adults, 
approximately 4% to 6% of children with chronic HCV infection have evidence of advanced fibrosis or 
cirrhosis and some children eventually require liver transplantation as a consequence of HCV infection (Hu 
2010), (Wirth 2012). In addition, HCV infection has been reported to negatively affect both the health-related 
quality of life and cognitive functioning of paediatric patients (Nydegger 2008), (Rodrigue 2009), (Abu 
Faddan 2015), (Annunziato 2017). 
2.1.1.4.  Management 
The goal of HCV treatment in both paediatric and adult populations is viral eradication, thereby preventing 
progressive hepatic inflammation, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure that result in the need for liver 
transplantation. Over the past 7 years, the development and approval of safe and effective direct-acting 
antivirals (DAAs) have transformed the treatment and course of HCV infection in adults. Several DAA 
therapies containing sofosbuvir have been approved for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV infection 
(Sovaldi, Harvoni, Epclusa and Vosevi). 
In 2017, Sovaldi and Harvoni were approved in the US and EU for the treatment of patients 12 years of age 
and older or weighing ≥ 35 kg (in the US only). As such, per current international guidelines, pegylated 
interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) are no longer recommended for treatment of children 12 years of 
Assessment report

age and older (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2018), (European Association 
for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2018), (World Health Organization (WHO) 2018a), (Indolfi 2018). For 
patients younger than 12 years of age (and, in certain countries, weighing < 35 kg), however, there are no 
approved DAA treatments; currently, the only approved HCV treatment option is Peg-IFN and weight-based 
RBV for 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Harvoni (LDV/SOF) is an all oral, once-daily, fixed-dose combination (FDC) of LDV, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
non-structural protein (NS) 5A inhibitor, and SOF, an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor. Harvoni was first 
approved in the United States (US) on 10 October 2014 and in the European Union (EU) on 17 November 
2014. Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of genotype 1, 3 (EU only), 4, 5 or 6 HCV infection. In 2017, 
Harvoni was approved in the US and EU for the treatment of patients 12 years of age and older, or weighing 
≥ 35 kg (in the US only). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
In the EU, a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for LDV/SOF was agreed on 10 October 2013 (European 
Medicines Evaluation Agency [EMEA]-001411-PIP01-12). Minor modifications to the original PIP have been 
agreed since this time, with the most recent European Medicines Agency Decision received on 17 March 2017 
(EMEA-001411-PIP01-12-M04). The design of GS-US-337-1116 reflected the PIP Decision agreed with the 
Paediatric Development Committee (PDCO) as part of the assessment of the PIP. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a line extension to add two paediatric formulations containing lower doses of the 
active substances, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, than the already authorised 90/400 mg film-coated tablets: 
45/200 mg film-coated tablets and 33.75/150 mg and 45/200 mg coated granules in sachet. 
Other ingredients in the film-coated tablets are: 
Tablet core: copovidone, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal 
anhydrous silica, magnesium stearate. 
Film-coating: partially hydrolysed polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol and talc. 
Other ingredients in the granules are: 
Granule cores: copovidone, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal 
anhydrous silica and magnesium stearate. 
Film-coating: hypromellose, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, macrogol, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, 
basic butylated methacrylate copolymer, talc and colloidal anhydrous silica. 
The film-coated tablets are available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with polypropylene (PP) 
child-resistant closures and the granules are available in sachets consisting of 
polyester/aluminium/polyethylene film as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
This application is a line extension and contains the same active substances, sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, used 
to manufacture the already-approved film-coated tablets. The information presented by the applicant in the 
dossier as was already assessed in the original submission and includes updates from any subsequent 
variations. The active substances are sourced from the same manufacturers, are manufactured by the same 
processes and are released in accordance with the same active substance specifications. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product – film-coated tablets 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The new presentation of Harvoni film-coated tablets contain 45 mg ledipasvir and 200 mg sofosbuvir. They 
are white, capsule-shaped tablets debossed with GSI on one side and HRV on the other. The composition of 
the tablet core is dose-proportional to the already-commercialised 90/400 mg strength tablet. The only 
differences are the amount and colour of film-coating and the tablet size and shape which provide sufficient 
distinction. 
The aim of development was to identify a lower strength immediate release solid oral dosage form for use in 
paediatric patients. Development was based on the already approved 90/400 mg tablets, including the use of 
the same manufacturing process, adapted to the smaller tablet size. 
The active substances are the same as those used in the approved higher strength tablets. Sofosbuvir is a 
crystalline solid, routinely manufactured as the most stable polymorphic form containing small quantities of 
an equivalent polymorphic form. Sofosbuvir exhibits pH-independent solubility across the physiological pH 
range. Sofosbuvir is highly soluble but has low apparent intestinal permeability (BCS class III). Particle size 
was found to be critical for dissolution rate, so sofosbuvir is sieved, or screen-milled and particle size is 
controlled in the active substance specification. 
Ledipasvir exhibits low, but pH-dependent, solubility and high apparent permeability (BCS class II). It is 
susceptible to the influence of gastrointestinal pH and fed state and so an amorphous spray-dried dispersion 
of ledipasvir and copovidone (LDV-SDD) was developed in order to mitigate these food effects. LDV-SDD is 
an amorphous solid powder. It is hygroscopic and photosensitive, but physically and chemically stable for up 
to 6 months if protected from light and moisture in a sealed container. The physicochemical properties of 
LDV-SDD are amenable to formulation in a solid oral tablet. 
The excipients used in the 45/200 mg tablets are the same as those used in the 90/400 mg tablets and their 
compatibility with the active substance was demonstrated. They are well known pharmaceutical ingredients 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of 
this report. 
The dissolution method is the same as used for the already-approved 90/400 mg tablets.  
Two reduced strength tablets (45/200 mg and 22.5/100 mg) with dose-proportional compositions were 
developed for use in paediatric patients. Dissolution behaviour of both active substances was shown to be 
equivalent to the 90/400 mg table in the QC dissolution medium. A waiver for in vivo bioequivalence studies 
was requested for the 45/200 mg tablets based on fulfilment of criteria outlined in Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 rev 1./corr.). Dissolution profiles of 90/400 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 10/51 
  
  
45/200 mg tablets were measured at pH 2, 4.5 and 6. The comparison of f2 factors indicated that they were 
>50 at all measured time-points. Therefore, the biowaiver is considered justified. 
The primary packaging is HDPE bottles with a polypropylene child-resistant closure with a silica gel desiccant 
and polyester coil. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of two parts: production of the LDV-SDD and then production of the film-
coated tablets. 
The manufacturing process for the LDV-SDD is identical to that used for the approved 90/400 mg tablets. The 
controls applied to the LDV-SDD intermediate have previously been assessed in the context of the original 
MAA and are considerde appropriate. 
The tablet manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: blending of LDV-SDD and sofosbuvir with intra-
granular excipients followed by granulation; blending of granules with extra-granular excipients followed by 
compression to form tablet cores; film-coating; packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. IPCs are carried out to monitor the critical steps of the manufacturing process. The 
IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Process validation was completed for the approved 90/400 mg tablets prior to commercialisation. The 
robustness of the process for the 45/200 mg tablets was demonstrated by manufacture of representative 
batches up to the planned 40 kg production scale. Formal process validation will be completed on at least 
three batches of 45/200 mg tablets prior to commercialisation and will include an extended sampling and 
testing plan. An adequate process validation scheme has been presented in the dossier. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance, identity (HPLC, UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of class 1, 2A and select class 3 elemental impurities in the finished product has been 
assessed following a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch 
analysis data on 15 batches of the 90/400 mg demonstrate that the amount of each relevant elemental 
impurity was well below the respective control threshold. Therefore, no specific controls for elemental 
impurities are required in the finished product specification. 
The limits for degradation products are aligned with those of the approved 90/400 mg tablets and are 
considered acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for three production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 11/51 
  
  
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production scale batches of the 45/200 mg tablets stored for up to 12 months under long 
term  conditions  (30  ºC  /  75%  RH)  and  for  up  to 6 months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed 
for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples  were  tested  for 
appearance, assay, degradation products, water content and dissolution. No significant changes were observed 
to any of the measured parameters under any conditions and the results were comparable to the data from the 
approved 90/400 mg tablets at each time-point. 
A further consideration is that the already-marketed 90/400 mg tablets have a 72-month shelf-life based on 
extensive stability data which revealed little or no change in any of the measured quality attributes, and that 
the two strengths of tablet are manufactured from a common blend. Photostability data was generated for the 
90/400 mg tablets indicating that Harvoni tablets are not photosensitive. Additional stability data reveals that 
the product is not impacted by freezing or temporary exposure to high temperature (60 ºC), which means that 
temperature excursions outside the normal temperature range which may be encountered during shipping will 
not have an adverse effect on product quality. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 6 years without any special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable.

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Finished Medicinal Product – coated granules in sachet 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Harvoni coated granules in sachet are an immediate-release taste-masked oral dosage form available in 
sachets for single use containing either 33.75 mg ledipasvir and 150 mg sofosbuvir or 45 mg ledipasvir and 
200 mg sofosbuvir and as active substances. 
The granules are orange, approximately 2 mm in diameter and packaged into 
polyester/aluminum/polyethylene (PET/ALU/PE) heat-sealed sachets. The sachet has a length of 25 mm and 
a height of 70 mm. A 33.75/150 mg sachet contains 90 granules and a 45/200 mg sachet contains 120 
granules.  
The aim of development was to identify an immediate release dosage form for those paediatric patients 
unable to swallow the 200 mg tablet. The same sources of active substance form are used as for the tablets. 
Their relevant physicochemical properties are discussed in section 2.2.3. Ledipasvir is incorporated as an 
amorphous component of LDV-SDD to improve its solubility. 
Chosen excipients had to be suitable for use in paediatric patients. In addition, due to the bitter taste of 
sofosbuvir, the granules are formulated to provide sufficient taste-masking. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel 
Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 12/51 
  
  
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
The impact of mixing the granules with soft foods prior to ingestion was also evaluated. Granules were mixed 
with various soft foods. The granules were found to be chemically stable with no increase in degradation 
products after 2 hours. In addition, there was no impact on dissolution rate of either active substance. It is 
not considered likely that paediatric patients in this indication will require feeding tubes. Therefore, feeding 
tube administration was not investigated. 
The dissolution method was modified slightly from that used in the tablet formulation. The manufacturing 
process was developed using the same principles as for the tablet formulation. 
The primary packaging is a unit dose PET/alu/PE sachet. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The first part if the manufacturing process is production of the LDV-SDD. The subsequent manufacturing 
process comprises six main steps: blending of intra-granular excipients followed by roller compaction and 
milling; bending with extra-granular excipients and compression; sub-coating; taste-mask coating; addition 
of glidant; packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Process validation for the LDV-SDD step has already been completed in the context of the already approved 
90/400 mg tablets. For the rest of the process, process validation will be conducted on 3 consecutive 
production scale batches prior to commercialisation, including the packaging step. The process validation 
scheme provided is considered suitable. 
The IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. Critical steps have 
been defined and the applied control strategy consisting of process controls, intermediate specifications as 
well as IPCs is suitable.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance, identity (HPLC, UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), residual ethanol (GC), assay (HPLC), degradation 
products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological enumeration 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of class 1, 2A and select class 3 elemental impurities in the finished product has been 
assessed following a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch 
analysis data on six bulk and four packaged batches of the coated granules demonstrate that the amount of 
each relevant elemental impurity was well below the respective control threshold. Therefore, no specific 
controls for elemental impurities are required in the finished product specification. 
The release and shelf-life limits for degradation products, many of which are also metabolites, are set in line 
with batch data, stability data, and the approved 90/400 mg tablets. The limits for ethanol used in the 
production process are set acceptably given the intended paediatric patient population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 13/51 
  
  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 4 pilot to production scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of each strength of finished product stored for up to 12 months 
under long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, degradation products and dissolution. The analytical 
procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  No  significant  changes  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  were 
observed. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. A small decrease in assay and increase in a known photodegradation product 
was observed in exposed samples. However, no changes to assay or degradation products was observed in 
packaged product, indicating that the primary packaging provides sufficient protection from light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without specific storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Satisfactory information has been provided in 
regard of both new presentations intended for treatment of paediatric patients. 
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of

the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.7.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted for this extension procedure. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
2.3.1.1.  Ledipasvir 
In the original Harvoni ERA assessment from 2014, the worst case PECsurfacewater (Phase I estimation, 
based on the daily dose of 90mg) was estimated to 0.45μg/L and exceeds the action limit of 0.01 μg/L – 
making a Phase II assessment necessary. In the Phase II assessment, the risk quotients (RQ) for all 
compartments of concern (sludge/effluent, surface water, ground water and sediment) were RQ<0.10. Based 
on the risk assessment, it is considered unlikely that the extension of Harvoni in the present procedure will 
increase environmental exposure to LDV.  
With regard to the PBT assessment, the CHMP concluded that ledipasvir is not a PBT substance. The NOEC of 
0.74 µg/l for Daphnia magna is the highest concentration tested (mean measured conc.) and the NOEC is 
actually >0.74 µg/l. The real concentration where no effects are observed might be higher if higher 
concentrations had been tested. Hence, the NOEC of 0.74 µg/l might overestimate the toxicity due to the low 
water toxicity. Overall, ledipasvir is considered persistent and bioaccumulative but not toxic, based on the 
data provided. Sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been amended accordingly. 
2.3.1.2.  Sofosbuvir 
It is considered unlikely that the extension of Harvoni will increase environmental exposure to SOF in relation 
to the previously accepted environmental risk assessment. Regarding the properties of SOF, it is a pro-drug 
with the active substance being the triphosphate GS-461203. Neither the pro-drug/SOF nor the active 
moiety/GS-461203 enter the environment at >10% of the administered dose. The focus of the environmental 
risk assessment of SOF is instead GS-331007, the only drug residue detected in total excreta at >10% of the 
applied radioactive dose (GS-331007 accounted for 79.6%). 
The mean partition coefficient was 0.398, 0.286 and 0.0593, at pH 4, 7 and 9, respectively, (log Kow -0.417, 
-0.576 and -1.28, respectively) and GS-331007 is therefore not a PBT-substance. A refined market 
penetration of 3.5% (the highest relevant nationwide estimated prevalence) was used to calculate a refined 
PEC surface water value. The refined PEC surface water of 7.0μg/L is significantly higher than the action limit 
of 0.01 μg/L. A Phase IIA assessment has therefore been performed and since a partition to sediment was 
indicated (>10% AR shifted after 14 days) a further assessment with a sediment dweller in Phase IIB has 
also been initiated. Since results indicate that GS-331007 does not adsorb to soils or activated sludges, 
aquatic toxicity has been the focus of Phase IIA analysis. 
None of the ratios between the predicted environmental concentrations and predicted no effect levels for the 
Sewage treatment plant-, Surface water- or Groundwater-compartment were above 1 and no further studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 15/51 
  
  
are therefore required. In the Phase IIB analysis on sediment dweller the risk quotient was also found to be 
below 1. Based on the data presented it is concluded that the environmentally relevant residue of sofosbuvir, 
GS-331007, is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In line with the completed Harvoni paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and as stated in Paediatric Committee 
(PDCO) compliance report and decision document EMEA-001411PIP01-12-P/0063/2017, no additional non-
clinical safety pharmacology and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were required as part of the Harvoni PIP. 
During this assessment, it was determined that the non-clinical programme comprehensively evaluated and 
characterized the toxicity profile of LDV/SOF, and there is no expectation that the toxicity profile seen in 
adult animals will be different to that in juvenile animals. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted for this procedure, which is acceptable.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects

a  Only data for subjects 6 to < 12 years old and 3 to < 6 years old are discussed in this summary. 
b  According to the study design, subjects received 1 of 3 different treatment regimens based on country of enrollment, HCV genotype, 
c 
prior HCV treatment experience, and cirrhosis status, as described in Table 6. 
The doses and formulations of LDV/SOF were based on age group and weight as follows: 
• 
Subjects 6 to < 12 years old received LDV/SOF 45/200 mg orally once daily (2 × 22.5/100-mg tablets or 4 × 11.25/50-mg 
packets containing granules). The selection of the LDV/SOF formulation was based on a swallowability assessment using 
matching placebo tablet at screening or baseline. 
Subjects 3 to < 6 years old who weighed ≥ 17 kg received LDV/SOF 45/200 mg orally once daily (4 × 11.25/50-mg packets 
containing granules). Subjects 3 to < 6 years old who weighed < 17 kg received LDV/SOF 33.75/150 mg orally once daily 
(3 × 11.25/50-mg packets containing granules). 
• 
d  RBV was administered orally with LDV/SOF in subjects with genotype 3 HCV infection. The dose of RBV was a weight-based dose 
of 15 mg/kg/day (< 47 kg), 600 mg/day (47−49 kg), 800 mg/day (50−65 kg), 1000 mg/day (66−80 kg), 1200 mg/day (81−105 kg), or

2.4.2.  Clinical Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics part of this application is supported by one Phase 2 clinical study (GS-US-337-1116) 
that provides information relevant to the PK (steady state), efficacy, and safety of LDV/SOF in paediatric 
subjects (aged 3 to < 18 years) with Chronic HCV-Infection, and one Phase 1 relative bioavailability and food 
effect study (GS-US-337-2091) of the paediatric oral granule formulation of LED/SOF in healthy adult 
subjects, relative to the FDC 90/400-mg approved tablet.  
The LDV/SOF FDC (45/200-mg) tablet is not bridged to the FDC 90/400-mg approved tablet in a 
bioequivalence study, as the formulation and manufacturing processes used for the 45/200-mg tablet are the 
same as those used for the approved LDV/SOF FDC (90/400-mg) tablet and the criteria for obtaining a 
Biowaiver outlined in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 rev 
1./corr) are fulfilled.  
The descriptive summary and statistical comparison of PK parameters for LDV, SOF, GS-566500, and GS-
331007 following the administration of single oral doses of LDV/SOF as a tablet (90/400 mg; 1 x 90/400 mg 
tablet) and as oral granules (90/400 mg; 8 x 11.25/50 mg units) under fasted conditions are presented in 
the table below.

Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 18/51 
  
  
 
GS-331007 exposure in the LDV/SOF oral granules was bioequivalent to the LDV/SOF tablets. Exploratory 
analyses showed that the AUC and Cmax of SOF and GS-566500 were also comparable between the 2 
formulations, with the 90% CIs for the %GLSM ratios contained within the range of 78% to 120% and 89% 
to 117%, respectively. 
The results demonstrated modestly lower LDV exposure (approximately 12%) in the LDV/SOF oral granules 
compared with the LDV/SOF tablet formulation, with the lower bounds of the 90% CI being approximately 
75% to 78%. These modest decreases in exposure are not considered to be clinically relevant, as the 
exposure was within the predefined equivalence boundaries of 50 to 200% selected for extrapolation of adult 
safety and efficacy data to children as part of a previous Harvoni extension of indication to add adolescents 
aged 12 to < 18 years (EMA/CHMP/246998/2017). 
Thus, the granule formulation gives similar systemic exposure in healthy volunteers in the fasted state as the 
already approved LDV/SOF tablet. 
The descriptive summary and statistical comparison of PK parameters for LDV, SOF, GS-566500, and GS-
331007 following the administration of single oral doses of LDV/SOF as oral granules (90/400 mg; 8 x 
11.25/50 mg units) under fasted and fed conditions are presented in the Table 3.

conditions)

With regards to food effect, the primary analysis demonstrated that the prespecified equivalence criteria for 
AUC of LDV (70% to 143%) and GS-331007 (80% to 125%) after administration of LDV/SOF oral granules 
under fed conditions compared with fasted conditions were met. Exploratory analyses showed the 
administration of the oral granules formulation under fed conditions compared with fasted conditions resulted 
in < 2-fold increase in AUC of SOF, and AUC and Cmax of GS-566500, with no alteration in SOF Cmax. These 
observations are consistent with historical data (Study GS-US-337-0101) on the effect of a high-fat/high-
calorie meal on the approved LDV/SOF tablet formulation, which can be administered without regard to food. 
In addition, the slight decrease (13%) of LDV exposure (AUC) with food, compared to fasted state, is still 
within the equivalence boundaries of 50 to 200% used for extrapolation of adult safety and efficacy data to 
children as part of a previous Harvoni extension of indication to add adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years 
(EMA/CHMP/246998/2017). 
Taken together, the results from study GS-US-337-2091 indicate that the oral granule formulation of 
LDV/SOF gives similar systemic exposure as the approved LDV/SOF tablet and can be administered without 
regard to food. 
Pharmacokinetics in Paediatric Subjects, 3-12 years  
Sofosbuvir and metabolites 
The PK of SOF and SOF’s major circulating metabolite GS-331007, and intermediate metabolite GS-566500 
were evaluated through population pharmacokinetic modelling. The population PK data included 226 subjects 
who received LDV/SOF±RBV in Study GS-US-337-1116, and 105 subjects who received SOF+RBV in Study 
GS-US-334-1112. A total of 160 subjects in Study GS-US-337-1116 and 69 subjects in Study GS-US-334-
1112 had SOF samples included in the analysis population used for SOF joint model development (see 
schematic diagram in Figure 1). A total of 197 and 198 subjects in Study GS-US-337-1116 had valid GS-
566500 and GS-331007 samples, respectively, and a total of 70 and 85 subjects in Study GS-US-334-1112 
had valid GS-566500 and GS-331007 samples, respectively. In the analysis population, 11 subjects in Study 
GS-US-337-1116 and 4 subjects in Study GS-US-334-1112 had all BLQ concentrations for SOF, while 13 
subjects in Study GS-US-337-1116 and 2 subjects in Study GS-US-334 1112 had all BLQ concentrations for 
GS-566500.

Figure 1 Population PK Model Diagram for SOF and SOF Metabolites.
Plasma concentrations of SOF, GS-566500, and GS-331007 were best described by a joint 1 compartment 
(SOF and GS-566500) and a 2-compartment (GS-331007) model, including first order absorption with zero-
order input for SOF and a lag-time for both SOF and GS-331007, followed by first-order elimination. The 
model included, a priori, the effect of weight (WT; allometric exponents fixed to 0.75 and 1 for clearances 
and volumes, respectively) on clearance and volume for SOF, GS-566500, and GS-331007; coadministration 
of LDV on the SOF relative fraction absorbed; and coadministration of RBV on clearance of the metabolites. 
In addition, the model included statistically significant covariates of age on on clearance of the metabolites 
and sex on clearance for GS-331007. The following covariates were tested in the analysis: baseline age, sex, 
race, ethnicity, creatinine clearance, food, and interleukin-28 status. The model performance is presented as 
prediction corrected visual predictive checks in Figure 2.

Ledipasvir 
The ledipasvir PK was evaluated in a population PK analysis. The population PK dataset for LDV analysis 
included 1271 observations from 198 subjects. The final paediatric LDV model was described by a 2-
compartment model including a zero-order input followed by a first-order absorption model, with 
interindividual variability on CL/F and Vc/F. Weight on CL/F and weight on Vc/F were included using fixed 
allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. In addition, age and sex were found as statistically 
significant covariates on CL/F. The following covariates were tested in the analysis: baseline age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, creatinine clearance, food, and interleukin-28 status. The model performance is presented as

Model Predicted Steady-State Exposure Parameters 
Population PK analyses of all paediatric subjects 3 to < 12 years old in the PK lead-in and treatment phases 
confirmed that SOF, GS-331007, and LDV exposures were similar to in HCV-infected adult subjects from 
Phase 2/3 studies. The AUCtau and Cmax for SOF, GS-331007, and LDV were within the predefined PK 
equivalence boundaries of 50% to 200% (Table 4).

Simulated SOF exposures are largely contained within the range observed in the adult Phase 2/3 population. 
In subjects with the lowest body weight within each identified weight band (ie, 11, 17, and 35 kg), 
approximately ≤ 6% are expected to achieve maximum exposures greater than those observed in the adult 
Phase 2/3 population. In addition, < 5% of subjects, including those with the highest body weight, are 
expected to have exposures lower than the range of adult exposures.  
Simulated GS-331007 exposures are largely contained within the range observed in the adult Phase 2/3 
population. In subjects with the lowest body weight within each identified weight band, < 2% of subjects are

Due to the high SVR rates in subjects 3 to < 12 years old, exposure-response relationships for efficacy were 
not evaluated. 
The PK/PD Analysis Set for PK-safety included all paediatric subjects 3 to < 12 years old with chronic HCV 
infection who received LDV/SOF and had evaluable population-based AUCtau estimates for SOF (N = 95), GS-
331007 (N = 124), and LDV (N = 124). Overall, SOF, GS-331007, and LDV exposures in paediatric subjects 
were similar regardless of the presence or absence of the evaluated AEs (headache, pyrexia, abdominal pain, 
fatigue, vomiting, cough, or rhinorrhoea), both overall and by age group treatment strata. The exposure-
response analyses are viewed as supportive evidence and hence the provided graphical analyses are 
accepted. No obvious trends with regards to exposure and safety could be detected. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Population PK analysis has been used to describe the sofosbuvir PK data in the paediatric population 3-18 
years of age. A joint model has been developed where sofosbuvir and metabolites GS-566500 and GS-
331007 have been simultaneously analysed. Furthermore, all sofosbuvir PK data, administered as Sovaldi or 
in the fixed-dose combination Harvoni (sofosbuvir+ledipasvir) have been pooled together to make use of all 
available data. This approach is highly encouraged. The following covariates were tested in the analysis: 
baseline age, sex, race, ethnicity, creatinine clearance, food, and interleukin-28 status. The only statistically 
significant covariates were age on clearance of both metabolites and sex on clearance for GS-331007. The 
effect of ledipasvir on sofosbuvir bioavailability, as well as the ribavirin effect on metabolite clearance was 
incorporated in the model. The joint model was able to describe the three analytes well and the model is 
considered adequate to be used for predicting the exposure (AUC and Cmax) in the paediatric population. 
The ledipasvir PK model described the data well and is adequate for exposure predictions and dose selection. 
The population PK predicted exposures metrics have been compared with the corresponding observed 
exposure ranges in the adult population. The MAH had predefined PK equivalence boundaries of 50% to 
200% and all the exposure metrics, and all analytes, meet the criteria and the exposure comparisons are 
largely contained within the predefined boundaries. The CHMP noted that the AUC and Cmax for the 
metabolite GS-331007 were clearly higher than the adult exposures. However, given the safety profile of SOF 
and associated metabolites these exposure levels were considered acceptable. 
The proposed body weight bands seem reasonable. Although there is a peak at the 35 kg switch, it is 
considered that an additional weight band would not be of added value. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the population PK analysis provided an adequate description of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir exposure in 
children 3-12 years of age. The CHMP concluded that the dosing recommendations can be endorsed.

2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.5.1.  Main study 
GS-US-337-1116 
GS-US-337-1116 was a Phase 2 study evaluating the PK, safety, and antiviral activity of LDV/SOF±RBV in 
paediatric subjects aged 3 to < 18 years old. This update to the marketing application presents data from all 
subjects 3 to < 12 years old who completed the posttreatment Week 24 visit or prematurely discontinued 
from the study. Data for adolescent subjects 12 to < 18 years old were previously presented in the 
GS-US-337-1116 Interim CSR, and final data through posttreatment Week 24 are presented in the 
GS-US-337-1116 Final CSR. Only data for paediatric subjects 3 to < 12 years old are presented below. 
2.4.5.2.  Methods 
• 
Study participants  
Although the GS-US-337-1116 study allowed for inclusion of HCV multiple genotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 
subsequently 2) the population studied was predominantly GT1 patients (121/126). In line with the 
pharmacokinetic bridging, this is acceptable given that the pharmacological targets of SOF and LDV are HCV-
specific (NS5B and NS5A, respectively). 
Subjects 6 to < 12 Years Old 
A total of 92 subjects aged 6 to < 12 years were enrolled into the study (70 subjects in the US, 11 subjects 
in the United Kingdom (UK), 7 subjects in Australia, and 4 subjects in New Zealand). 
Overall, the mean age of subjects was 9 years. The majority of subjects had been infected through vertical 
transmission (96.7%). 
The majority of subjects had genotype 1 HCV infection (95.7%, 88 subjects [77 with the genotype 1a 
subtype, 10 with the genotype 1b subtype, and 1 with undetermined subtype]); 2 subjects (2.2%) had 
genotype 3 HCV infection; and 2 subjects (2.2%) had genotype 4 HCV infection. Subjects with host and viral 
factors that have been traditionally predictive of or associated with lower rates of SVR in 
Peg-IFN+RBV-containing regimens were included, such as non-CC (CT or TT) IL28B alleles (73.9%), and high 
viral load (58.7% with HCV RNA ≥ 800,000 IU/mL). Two subjects (2.2%) had known cirrhosis based on prior 
biopsy. The majority of subjects were treatment-naive (78.3%). 
Subjects 3 to < 6 Years Old 
A total of 34 subjects aged 3 to < 6 years were enrolled into the study (29 subjects in the US, 3 subjects in 
the UK, and 2 subjects in Australia). 
Overall, the mean age of subjects was 4 years. All subjects had been infected through vertical transmission 
(100.0%). 
The majority of subjects had genotype 1 HCV infection (97.1%, 33 subjects [28 with the genotype 1a 
subtype and 5 with the genotype 1b subtype]); 1 subject (2.9%) had genotype 4 HCV infection. Subjects 
with host and viral factors that have been traditionally predictive of or associated with lower rates of SVR in 
Assessment report

Peg-IFN+RBV-containing regimens were included, such as non-CC (CT or TT) IL28B alleles (64.7%), and high 
viral load (55.9% with HCV RNA ≥ 800,000 IU/mL). No subjects had known cirrhosis based on prior biopsy. 
All subjects were treatment-naive (100.0%). 
• 
Treatments 
According to the study design, subjects received 1 of 3 different treatment regimens based on country of 
enrolment, HCV genotype, prior HCV treatment experience, and cirrhosis status, as described in Table 6.

The non-controlled study design, similar to the adult phase 3 studies, is endorsed as the primary endpoint 
(SVR12) is objective, the natural course of disease is well known and spontaneous clearance of HCV within 
the time frame in questions is very rare.  
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The key efficacy endpoint for Study GS-US-337-1116 was SVR12, defined as HCV RNA < the lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ) 12 weeks following treatment completion. The choice of SVR12 as a primary endpoint is 
endorsed. In contrast to interferon-containing regimens, HCV relapses between week 12 and 24 has not been 
seen with DAA-only treatment.

2.4.5.3.  Results  
• 
Baseline data 
Patients in both age groups were predominantly vertically HCV infected, GT1 non-cirrhotic(or with unknown 
cirrhosis status). This is acceptable, given that the efficacy can be bridged from adult pivotal studies given 
that drug exposure is comparable. 
Subjects 6 to < 12 years old 
Overall, the majority of subjects were male (58.7%), white (79.3%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (84.8%), with 
a mean age of 9 years. The mean (SD) baseline BMI value for subjects was 18.2 (3.47) kg/m2. Table 7 
presents a summary of the baseline disease characteristics for subjects 6 to < 12 years old overall and by

SVR12 
Subjects 6 to < 12 Years Old 
Table 9 presents the proportion of subjects 6 to < 12 years old who achieved SVR12 and virologic outcomes, 
overall and by treatment group. No subject had on-treatment virologic failure (ie, breakthrough, rebound, or 
nonresponse). One treatment-naive subject with genotype 1a HCV infection and cirrhosis completed 
12 weeks of LDV/SOF and relapsed at the posttreatment Week 4 visit; the subject was reported to have 
97.6% study drug adherence.

It is clear that LDV/SOF is highly effective in the patient population studied. Due to the close to 100% SVR12 
rate (98.9 and 97.1%, respectively), subgroup analyses are futile.  
• 
Ancillary analyses 
Resistance Findings 
Given the very few non-SVR12 patients, resistance analyses in relation to efficacy are of limited value. 
Subjects 6 to < 12 Years Old 
Pre-treatment NS5A and NS5B NI resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were observed in 14.1% (13 of 92) 
and 3.2% (3 of 92) of subjects 6 to < 12 years old, respectively. The presence of pre-treatment NS5A and/or 
NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome, as all subjects with pre-treatment RAVs achieved SVR12 and 
SVR24. One subject infected with genotype 1a HCV failed to achieve SVR12 and SVR24. This subject had no 
pre-treatment NS5A or NS5B NI RAVs at baseline and had emergent NS5A RAV Y93H at relapse. 
Subjects 3 to < 6 Years Old 
Pre-treatment NS5A and NS5B NI RAVs were observed in 12.1% (4 of 33) and 6.1% (2 of 33) of subjects 3 
to < 6 years old with virologic outcome, respectively. The presence of pre-treatment NS5A and/or NS5B RAVs 
did not impact treatment outcome as all subjects with pre-treatment RAVs achieved SVR12 and SVR24.

2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The GS-US-337-1116 study has been designed and conducted in line with previous studies in the field of HCV 
treatment. The efficacy results in the age groups at question (3 to <6 and 6 to <12 years) were reassuring, 
with SVR12 rates close to 100%, but were limited mainly to non-cirrhotic GT1 patients treated for 12 weeks 
with LDV/SOF without ribavirin. Given that exposure is comparable, efficacy across genotypes and into the 
subset of cirrhotic patients can be extrapolated from the adult phase 3 programme. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that LDV/SOF is effective in the treatment of chronic HCV in children aged 3 to < 12 
years of age. 
2.4.8.  Clinical safety 
2.4.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Subjects 6 to < 12 Years Old 
Overall, 92 subjects 6 to < 12 years old were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) duration of exposure to study drug for subjects 6 to < 12 years old was 12.1 
(0.25) weeks for the 89 subjects in the LDV/SOF 12 Week group, 24.0 weeks for the single subject in the 
LDV/SOF 24 Week group, and 24.2 (0.10) weeks for the 2 subjects in the LDV/SOF+RBV 24 Week group. All 
but 1 subject (LDV/SOF 12 Week group) completed their assigned treatment duration. One subject in the 
LDV/SOF 12-week treatment group was considered to have completed study treatment by the investigator; 
however, study drug administration data indicate that the subject took study drug until Day 79 when the last 
on-treatment study visit was performed, rather than continuing until Day 84. 
Subjects 3 to < 6 years old 
Overall, 34 subjects 3 to < 6 years old were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The mean 
(SD) duration of exposure to study drug for subjects 3 to < 6 years old was 11.7 (1.96) weeks. The majority 
of subjects (94.1%, 32 of 34 subjects) completed their assigned treatment duration. Two subjects were 
counted as not having completed the assigned treatment duration; however, study drug accountability data 
indicate that one of these subjects did actually complete all 84 days of treatment (GS-US-337-1116 Final, 
Listing 16.2.5.2). The remaining subject prematurely discontinued study drug on Day 5 due to an AE of 
product taste abnormal. 
The size of the study groups allows for a limited safety assessment which is, given that exposure is 
comparable, acceptable given the established safety profile of LDF/SOF in adults. 
2.4.8.2.  Adverse events 
Subjects 6 to < 12 years old 
The majority of subjects (70.7%, 65 of 92 subjects) experienced at least 1 AE (69.7% [62 of 89] of subjects 
in the LDV/SOF 12 week group; all 3 subjects in the LDV/SOF±RBV 24 week groups experienced at least 1 
AE). 
Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 37/51 
  
  
 
 
All AEs were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severity. One subject in the LDV/SOF 12 week group 
experienced SAEs that were assessed by the investigator as not related to study drug (tooth abscess, 
abdominal pain, and gastroenteritis). No deaths were reported. No subjects prematurely discontinued 
LDV/SOF or RBV due to an AE, and no subjects had AEs that led to interruption of LDV/SOF dosing or 
modification or interruption of RBV dosing. There were no AEs consistent with progression of liver disease, 
such as AEs of HCC or hepatic decompensation. 
No notable effects of study treatment on development or growth as assessed by changes from baseline 
through posttreatment Week 24 in Tanner pubertal stages, bone age, height, weight, and BMI percentiles 
were observed in either treatment group. No notable changes from baseline in vital signs (systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or pulse) were observed during the study.

were headache (18.0%), pyrexia (16.9%), and abdominal pain (15.7%). For the 3 subjects in the 
LDV/SOF±RBV 24 week groups, the only AE reported in > 1 subject was cough.

Subjects 3 to < 6 years old 
Table 13 presents an overall summary of AEs for subjects 3 to < 6 years old. The majority of subjects 
(73.5%, 25 of 34) experienced at least 1 AE. All AEs were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severity. 
No subjects experienced SAEs. No deaths were reported. One subject prematurely discontinued LDV/SOF due 
to an AE (Section 11.3.5). No subjects had AEs that led to interruption of LDV/SOF dosing. There were no 
AEs consistent with progression of liver disease such as AEs of HCC or hepatic decompensation. 
No notable effects of study treatment on development or growth as assessed by changes from baseline 
through posttreatment Week 24 in Tanner pubertal stages, bone age, height, weight, and BMI percentiles 
were observed in either treatment group. No notable changes from baseline in vital signs (systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or pulse) were observed during the study.

Table 14 presents a summary of AEs reported for at least 10% of subjects 3 to < 6 years old by PT. The most 
3 commonly reported AEs were vomiting (23.5%), and pyrexia and cough (each 20.6%). 
Table 14 GS-US-337-1116: Adverse Events Reported for at Least 10% of Subjects in Any 
Treatment Group (3 to < 6 years Old) (Safety Analysis Set) 
The adverse events presented are in line with the currently established favourable safety profile of LDV/SOF. 
In comparison to the terms listed in SmPC section 4.8, it is clear that gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, 
vomiting and diarrhoea are quite common. The lack of a control arm makes assessment of causality difficult 
and the data should be seen in the context that GI symptoms are overall relatively common in children.

2.4.8.3.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the group of subjects 6 to < 12 years old, three treatment-emergent SAEs and 1 nontreatment-emergent 
SAE were reported in 1 subject in the LDV/SOF 12 week group. The subject experienced treatment-emergent 
SAEs of Grade 2 tooth abscess on Day 13, Grade 2 abdominal pain on Day 25, and Grade 2 gastroenteritis on 
Day 89, and a nontreatment-emergent SAE of allergic oedema 167 days after the end of treatment. None of 
the events were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug or led to dose modification. All events 
resolved. 
No treatment-emergent SAEs were reported during the study for subjects 3 to < 6 years old and  
There were no deaths in the study. 
The low level of treatment-emergent SAEs (1/126 study subjects aged 3-12 years), absence of deaths and 
overall high adherence to treatment is in line with the established favourable safety profile of LDV/SOF. 
2.4.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Subjects 6 to < 12 years old 
The majority of subjects 6 to < 12 years old (57.6%, 53 of 92) had at least 1 laboratory abnormality 
reported (57.3% [51 of 89] of subjects in the LDV/SOF 12 week group, 100.0% [1 of 1] of subjects in the 
LDV/SOF 24 week group, and 50.0% [1 of 2] of subjects in the LDV/SOF+RBV 24 week group). For all but 4 
subjects, the maximum laboratory abnormality grade was Grade 1 (43.5% [40 of 92 subjects]) or Grade 2 
(9.8% [9 of 92 subjects]). Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported for 4.3% (4 of 92) of 
subjects, all of whom were in the LDV/SOF 12 week group. 
Haematology 
Table 15 presents a summary of subjects 6 to < 12 years old with Grade 3 or 4 Haematology laboratory 
abnormalities by treatment group. Among subjects in the LDV/SOF 12 week group, Grade 3 and 4 
Haematology laboratory abnormalities were reported for decreased haemoglobin and decreased neutrophils. 
No Grade 3 or 4 Haematology laboratory abnormalities were reported for the 3 subjects in the LDV/SOF±RBV 
24 week groups. 
A Grade 3 decrease in haemoglobin (defined as a > 4.5-g/dL decrease from baseline) was reported for 1 
subject (LDV/SOF 12 week group) at Weeks 1, 8, and the posttreatment visits. The subject’s haemoglobin 
value at baseline was 18.3 g/dL, and was within normal range at all postbaseline time points (range: 13.0 to 
14.4 g/dL).  
A Grade 4 decrease in neutrophils was reported for 1 subject (LDV/SOF 12 week group) at Week 1. At all 
other visits, the subject had normal values for neutrophils, except for Grade 1 decreased neutrophils on 
posttreatment Day 85. 
Overall, 1 subject experienced postbaseline haemoglobin < 10 g/dL, and no subject had postbaseline 
haemoglobin values < 8.5 g/dL. One subject (LDV/SOF 12 week group) with a history of celiac disease had a 
Grade 2 decrease in haemoglobin to 9.3 g/dL at Week 2 followed by return to normal haemoglobin level at 
Week 4 and for the remainder of the study.

Table 15 GS-US-337-1116: Grade 3 Hematology Laboratory Abnormalities (6 to <12 years old) 
(Safety Analysis Set) 
Chemistry 
Table 16 presents a summary of subjects 6 to < 12 years old with Grade 3 or 4 coagulation or chemistry 
laboratory abnormalities by treatment group. 
Grade 3 chemistry laboratory abnormalities were reported for amylase (2.2%, 2 of 92 subjects). No Grade 4 
chemistry laboratory abnormalities or Grade 3 or 4 coagulation laboratory abnormalities were reported.  
One subject (LDV/SOF 12 week group) had a transient and asymptomatic Grade 3 increase in serum amylase 
at Week 1. The subject’s serum amylase values were Grade 2 at all other time points, including screening 
and baseline. Another subject (LDV/SOF 12 week group) had asymptomatic Grade 3 increases in serum 
amylase at Weeks 1, 2, 8, 12, and posttreatment visits. The subject had Grade 3 increased amylase at 
screening and Grade 2 increased amylase at baseline. No AEs of clinical pancreatitis were reported for either 
subject.

Table 16 GS-US-337-1116: Grade 3 or 4 Coagulation or Chemistry Laboratory Abnormalities (6 to 
< 12 Years Old) (Safety Analysis Set) 
Subjects 3 to < 6 years old 
The majority of subjects 3 to < 6 years old had at least 1 laboratory abnormality reported (70.6%, 24 of 34). 
The maximum laboratory abnormality grades for all subjects were Grade 1 or Grade 2. 
Haematology 
No Grade 3 or 4 Haematology laboratory abnormalities were reported in subjects 3 to < 6 years old. There 
were no subjects with postbaseline haemoglobin < 10 g/dL. 
Chemistry 
No Grade 3 or 4 coagulation or chemistry laboratory abnormalities were reported in subjects 3 to < 6 years 
old. 
Overall, the haematology and chemistry data appear to be in line with the currently established safety profile 
of LDV/SOF. However, when viewing the chemistry data in detail it seems that amylase abnormalities of 
grade 1-2 are relatively common which suggests that the grade 3 abnormality described is not a random 
finding (see Table 17 below).

Table 17 Treatment-emergent graded laboratory abnormalities 
Amylase abnormalities did not appear to be related to GI symptoms, indicating that pancreatitis and no such 
AEs were reported in the paediatric study. Given that comparable numbers of patients normalised their 
pancreatic enzymes from baseline, compared to those who had abnormalities emerging on treatment, it is 
reasonable to assume that this reflects the underlying disease. 
2.4.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the LDV/SOF safety data set in patients aged 3-<6 and 6-<12 years is in line with the established 
favourable safety profile in adults. Gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were 
observed quite commonly. However, considering that gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively common in 
children regardless of treatment as well as given the lack of a control causal relationship has not been 
established. Therefore, the CHMP did not request their addition to the Product Information. 
The low level of treatment-emergent SAEs (1/126 study subjects aged 3-<12 years), no deaths and overall 
high adherence to treatment was also in line with the established favourable safety profile of LDV/SOF. 
Overall, the haematology and chemistry data did not provide cause of concern regarding any age-specific 
issues.  
2.4.10.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of LDV/SOF is overall favourable in HCV patients between 3-<12 years of age.

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Harvoni film-coated tablets. The bridging report submitted by the MAH 
has been found acceptable. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Harvoni (ledipasvir / sofosbuvir) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it had a PASS imposed at the time of authorisation.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hepatitis C virus infection is a global health challenge with an estimated global prevalence of 1%, for a total 
of 71 million individuals worldwide chronically infected with HCV (The Polaris Observatory HCV Collaborators 
2017), (World Health Organization (WHO) 2018b). In the US, over 3 million people are estimated to be 
chronically infected with HCV (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2016), and in Europe an estimated 
10 to 14 million people have chronic HCV infection (The Polaris Observatory HCV Collaborators 2017), (World 
Health Organization (WHO) 2018c). Up to 85% of individuals infected with HCV fail to clear the virus and 
progress to chronic infection; over the ensuing 20 years, as many as 20% of patients with chronic HCV 
infection are estimated to develop complications, including cirrhosis, end stage liver disease, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Curing HCV infection is associated with numerous health benefits, including 
more than 70% reduction in the risk of HCC and 90% reduction in the risk of liver-related mortality and liver 
transplantation (Morgan 2013), (van der Meer 2012), (Veldt 2007), (Poynard 2002). 
The estimated prevalence of HCV infection in children is up to 0.4% in Europe and the US and up to 6% in 
resource-limited countries (El-Shabrawi 2013), (Khaderi 2014). Globally, it is estimated that approximately 
Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 46/51 
  
  
2.1 to 3.5 million individuals 15 years of age or younger are chronically infected with HCV (Nwaohiri 2018), 
(European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2018). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In 2017, Sovaldi (SOF) and Harvoni were approved in the US and EU for the treatment of patients 12 years 
of age and older, or weighing ≥ 35 kg (in the US only). As such, per current international guidelines, 
pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) are no longer recommended for treatment of children 12 
years of age and older (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2018), (European 
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2018), (World Health Organization (WHO) 2018a), (Indolfi 
2018). For patients younger than 12 years of age (and, in certain countries, weighing < 35 kg), there are no 
approved DAA treatments; currently, the only approved HCV treatment option is Peg-IFN and weight-based 
RBV for 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
GS-US-337-1116 was a Phase 2 study evaluating the PK, safety, and antiviral activity of LDV/SOF±RBV in 
paediatric subjects aged 3 to < 18 years old. This update to the marketing application presents data from all 
subjects 3 to < 12 years old who completed the post-treatment Week 24 visit or prematurely discontinued 
from the study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Population PK analysis has been used to describe the sofosbuvir PK data in the paediatric population 3-18 
years of age. A joint model has been developed where sofosbuvir and metabolites GS-566500 and GS-
331007 have been simultaneously analysed. Furthermore, all sofosbuvir PK data, administered as Sovaldi or 
in the fixed-dose combination Harvoni (sofosbuvir+ledipasvir) have been pooled together to make use of all 
available data. The joint model was able to describe the three analytes well. A separate population PK 
analysis for ledipasvir provided an adequate description of ledipasvir data. The population PK predicted 
exposures metrics (AUCtau, Cmax, and Cav[LDV]) have been compared with the corresponding observed 
exposure ranges in the adult population. The % geometric mean ratio between the paediatric patient 
population and the adult phase 2/3 population were largely contained within the predefined PK equivalence 
boundaries of 50% to 200%. 
In the GS-US-337-1116 study, SVR12 was achieved in 33/34 (97.1%) patients in the group 3 to <6 years old 
and 91/92 (98.9%) in the group 6 to <12 years old. SVR12 is widely accepted as a surrogate endpoint for 
cure of HCV and halt of further progress of liver disease. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The GS-US-337-1116 study has been performed mainly in non-cirrhotic patients with HCV GT1 and hence 
paediatric efficacy data in other genotypes and clinical subgroups were missing. However, given that 
exposure of LDV/SOF is comparable, efficacy across genotypes and into the subgroup of cirrhotic patients can 
be extrapolated from adult efficacy data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/270141/2020 
Page 47/51 
  
  
 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the LDV/SOF safety data set in patients aged 3-<6 and 6-<12 years is in line with the established 
favourable safety profile in adults. Gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were 
observed quite commonly. However, considering that gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively common in 
children regardless of treatment as well as given the lack of a control causal relationship has not been 
established. 
The low level of treatment-emergent SAEs (1/126 study subjects aged 3-<12 years), no deaths and overall 
high adherence to treatment was also in line with the established favourable safety profile of LDV/SOF. 
Overall, the haematology and chemistry data did not provide cause of concern regarding any age-specific 
issues.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The paediatric dataset is of limited size, particularly in patients aged 3 to <6 years (34 subjects). However, 
given the established safety profile of LDV/SOF and that the exposure is comparable, this remaining 
uncertainty is acceptable.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Adequate population PK analyses of sofosbuvir and selected metabolites, and ledipasvir, respectively, has 
been performed and the models were considered adequate to provide predicted exposure metrics in the 
paediatric population. The model predicted sofosbuvir, GS-331007, and ledipasvir plasma exposures display 
sufficiently similar levels between the adult and paediatric populations across all body weights. The proposed 
body weight band dosing is supported. 
Overall, safety of the product in the paediatric population is in line with the established favourable safety 
profile in adults. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The described similarity of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, and ledipasvir PK in adults and children is considered 
sufficient to support the efficacy and safety results to the new paediatric population (3-12 years). The 
efficacy estimate (SVR12) showed a very high cure rate also in the paediatric setting and there were no 
indications of any age-specific safety concerns.  
Given the natural course of chronic HCV infection in comparison to the high cure rate and favourable safety 
profile of LDV/SOF, the favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Harvoni is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Harvoni 45 mg / 200 mg film-coated tablets, 45 mg / 200 mg coated granules and  
33.75 mg / 150 mg  coated granules is favourable in the following indication: 
•  Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in adult and paediatric patients aged 
3 years and above. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Harvoni subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

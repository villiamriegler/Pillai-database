approved indications for RoActemra 162 mg solution 
for injection in pre-filled syringe to include active 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and 
juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis from the age of 12 
years; the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder took 
the opportunity to make minor editorial changes in 
Sections 3, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC for 
RoActemra 162 mg solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringe and the Annex II.

systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in patients 1 
year of age and older and juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis 
(pJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older. 
Sub-Cutaneous (SC) injections administered via the pre-
filled pen deliver bioequivalent exposures to the pre-filled 
syringe. Literature review has indicated that some 
paediatric patients are at potential risk of inadvertent IM 
injection with the pre-filled pen, especially younger patients 
weighing < 30 kg thus the use of the pre-filled pen has 
been restricted to adolescent patients (aged >12 years) the 
vast majority of whom will be ≥ 30 kg in weight. Therefore, 
the SmPC for RoActemra 162 mg solution for injection in 
pre-filled pen has been aligned with the approved 
indications for RoActemra 162 mg solution for injection in 
pre-filled syringe to include active systemic juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and juvenile idiopathic 
polyarthritis. The use of the pre filed pen is from the age of 
12 years. 
The SmPC section 4.1 has been updated as follows:  
“RoActemra is indicated for the treatment of active 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in patients 12 
Page 10/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
years of age and older, who have responded inadequately 
to previous therapy with NSAIDs and systemic 
corticosteroids (see Section 4.2). 
RoActemra can be given as monotherapy (in case of 
intolerance to MTX or where treatment with MTX is 
inappropriate) or in combination with MTX.  
RoActemra in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is 
indicated for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic 
polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative 
and extended oligoarthritis) in patients 12 years of age and 
older, who have responded inadequately to previous 
therapy with MTX (see Section 4.2). 
RoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of 
intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX 
is inappropriate.” 
The PL have been updated accordingly.

WA22480- (ARTIS) registry study was a Phase IV,

data from the use of tocilizumab in Sweden for RA 
patients. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission

prospective observational cohort study. This was a 
nationwide safety monitoring of tocilizumab (TCZ) 
treatment in patients with rheumatic diseases in Sweden. 
The rationale and study objectives were to provide long 
term safety data from the use of TCZ in Sweden for 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. 
The relative occurrence of a series of pre-defined safety 
outcomes in Swedish patients with RA treated with 
tocilizumab, or with other anti-rheumatic treatments, 
compared to the general Swedish population, were

n/a 
Final report from study WA28119 (GiACTA) including Part 2 
assessed. No new safety signals for TCZ emerged from the 
study. No updates to the Product Information are 
warranted. 
This is a Phase III, multicenter,randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy 
and safety of tocilizumab in subjects with giant cell 
arteritis. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
and the 3-year results of the entire study was submitted. 
Overall, the Part 1 and 2 combined efficacy analyses 
demonstrated that 1 year of RoActemra treatment during 
Part 1 had prolonged benefits in terms of sustained disease 
control and GC sparing over the course of the 3-year study. 
Time to giant cell arteritis (GCA) flare was longer, and the 
cumulative glucocorticoids (GC) dose was lower, for 
patients who had received RoActemra during Part 1 than 
for patients who had received placebo, particularly for 
patients who had received RoActemra QW. Although 
approximately half of the RoActemra patients in clinical 
remission at Week 52 experienced flare after stopping 
treatment with RoActemra, indicating a potential need for 
RoActemra therapy beyond 1 year, retreatment with 
RoActemra appeared to be effective in treating patients 
who flared. 
No new safety signals were reported over the 3-year study 
period for patients that received RoActemra and the results 
were consistent with the established safety profile of 
RoActemra, and the safety results obtained for GCA 
patients in Part 1 of the study. No new safety concerns 
were identified. Overall, based on these efficacy and safety 
results no change to the product information was deemed

Based on post-marketing exposure data, the MAH has re-

calculated the frequencies for “Anaphylaxis (Fatal)” and 
Grouping of 3 variations: 
Two variations C.I.11.z supporting RMP updates:  
Submission of an updated RMP version 25.2 in order 
to: 
- 
Remove the reference to the Neutropenia 
Guided Questionnaire from the RMP. 
- 
Remove all references to the US Claims 
Database from the RMP.  
The MAH also took the opportunity to make the 
following minor changes to the RMP: 
- 
Removal of study WA22479 (British Society 
of Rheumatology Biologics Register (BSRBR)) in 
response to the fulfilment of PAM MEA-045. 
- 
Removal of OTIS registry from additional 
pharmacovigilance activities which was erroneously 
retained in EU-RMP version 24.1 approved with the 
variation procedure EMEA/H/C/00955/II/76.  
- 
Inclusion of the ZUMA-8 (KTE-X19-108) 
study in routine pharmacovigilance activities in line 
with previous PRAC/CHMP request as part of 
variation procedure EMEA/H/C/000955/II/0076. 
- 
Removal of study WA29358 which was 
erroneously introduced into RMP v24.1 as an 
additional PV activity 
“Stevens Johnsons Syndrome” (SJS) as per the SmPC 
Guideline (2009). These adverse reactions were identified 
through post marketing surveillance but not observed in 
controlled clinical trials. The frequency category was 
estimated as the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval 
calculated on the basis of the total number of patients 
exposed to tocilizumab in clinical trials. As a result of those 
calculations, Anaphylaxis (fatal) has been determined to 
occur with a frequency of ‘Rare’ and SJS has been 
determined to occur with a frequency of ‘Rare’. Section 4.8 
of the SmPC and the PL  have been updated accordingly.  
In addition, the following changes were introduced in the 
RMP with the present application: 
As per the Guidance on the format of the RMP in EU 
EMA/164014/2018 Rev.2.0.1 accompanying GVP Module V 
Rev.2, “For some adverse reactions (e.g. lab abnormalities) 
the identified risk may be the clinical outcome of the 
adverse reaction if these have been observed (e.g. 
associated with such laboratory abnormality)”. The clinical 
outcome of neutropenia is infections. Hence, in line with 
this guidance, the Guided Questionnaire (GQ) for 
neutropenia was removed from the RMP as neutropenia 
follow-up information is covered in the GQ for serious 
infection.

Johnson Syndrome to “rare” and list them in the

In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder

The event rate in tocilizumab-treated patients did not 
exceed the event rate those in patients exposed to other 
biological therapies for autoimmune conditions. SJS is a 
rare but severe hypersensitivity reaction. Based on the 
strength of the evidence in the medically confirmed SJS

aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) 
elevations of > 1 to 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), 
regardless of whether levels had decreased from > 3 to 5 x 
ULN or not.  The CHMP concluded that the 
recommendations for the clinical management of liver 
enzyme elevations remain essentially unchanged and are 
accepted.  However it should be emphasised that the 
patients should be carefully monitored while being treated 
with the reduced dose of RoActemra or after restarting the 
full dose treatment or the treatment after interruption. 
There is no information available at the time being that the 
proposed dose amendment is safe for the patients with 
impaired liver function especially during long term 
treatment.

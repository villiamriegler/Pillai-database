2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a gonadotropic hormone produced by the anterior lobe of the 
mammalian pituitary gland. It is indispensable for normal female and male gamete growth and 
maturation, and normal gonadal steroid production. Deficient endogenous production of FSH is a 
known cause of infertility and administration of exogenous gonadotropins is used to treat this 
condition.  
About the product  
Bemfola is presented as an aqueous solution intended for subcutaneous administration. The 
product is available in a pre-filled pen. There are 5 different pre-filled pens available (75 IU/0.125 
ml (5.5 micrograms/ 0.125 ml) solution for injection, 150 IU/0.25 ml (11 micrograms/ 0.25 ml) 
solution for injection, 225 IU/0.375 ml (16.5 micrograms/ 0.375 ml) solution for injection, 300 
IU/0.50 ml (22 micrograms/ 0.5 ml) solution for injection and 450 IU/0.75 ml (33 micrograms/ 0.75 
ml) solution for injection). 
The concentration of follitropin alfa is identical for all pre-filled pens, i.e. 600 IU follitropin alfa/1 ml 
solution for injection. The cartridges have the same concentration as the solution for injection in the 
pre-filled pens of Gonal-f, i.e. 600 IU/1 ml. The Bemfola pen is for single-use application only. 
Therefore, there are no preservatives present in Bemfola. In contrast, the reference product 
Gonal-f is multi-use and includes the preservative m-cresol in the formulation. 
The Bemfola pen offers fine-tuning of dosing of 12.5 IU increments. This is similar to the new 
Gonal-f pen that was approved in 2011 with type II variation EMEA/H/C/000071/II/0109/G. The 
Applicant states that benefits of the single use pen are volume and injection control mechanisms 
and visual aids that enhance therapy compliance. Additionally, an inbuilt lock prevents re-use of the 
pen device, which enhances patient safety. 
The dossier is submitted to support the approval of Bemfola with the same indications as Gonal-f. 
The indications requested are as follows: 
In adult women 
─ 
Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been 
unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1

─ 
Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for 
assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete 
intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). 
─ 
BEMFOLA in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for 
the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In 
clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. 
In adult men 
─ 
Bemfola is indicated in the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or 
acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) therapy.”  
The clinical development program was based on relevant guidelines particularly 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 (Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues). 
The clinical program consists of a Phase I study in healthy subjects and a Phase III study in infertile 
ovulatory women undergoing ART. 
Currently approved recFSH 
The currently approved recombinant follicle stimulating hormones (FSH) in Europe are:  
  Gonal-f (EU/1/95/001/001-035, MAH: Serono Europe Ltd.), the reference product in this 
biosimilar application. 
  Puregon (EU/1/96/008/001-041, MAH: N.V. Organon). Puregon has the same indications as 
Gonal-f, except for the indication concerning the “stimulation of follicular development in women 
with severe LH and FSH deficiency in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation”, 
which is only approved for Gonal-f. In section 4.2 the starting dose for the Assisted Reproduction 
Techniques (ART) indication is 100-225 IU. 
Background on mechanism of action FSH within the Assisted Reproduction Techniques 
(ART) 
Secretion of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) is controlled by GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) 
produced in the hypothalamus. 
FSH, like LH, is synthesized and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. It is a heterodimeric 
glycoprotein consisting of two non-covalently bound subunits; alpha and beta. All glycopeptides 
(FSH, LH, TSH, and hCG) share a common -chain, an identical structure containing 92 amino acids. 
It has two N-glycosylation sites. The -subunit, which is specific for r-hFSH, consists of 111 amino 
acids, and has also two N-glycosylation sites. Due to extensive post-translational glycosylation the 
hormone exists in a variety of isoforms. 
FSH is essential for normal female gamete growth and maturation, and induction of normal gonadal 
steroid production. In the first protocols used in ART (standard “long” protocol), a GnRH agonist was 
used to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary ovarian axis (pituitary down-regulation) for controlled 
ovarian stimulation and additionally to prevent a premature LH surge. When desensitization has 
been achieved, controlled (= exogenous) ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (FSH alone or FSH 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 11/76 
 
  
  
 
 
+ LH) is started, while the use of the GnRH agonist is continued until the time when hCG will be 
administered. HCG is administered for final follicular maturation and triggering of ovulation after 
confirmation of adequate follicular development. 
Another option to achieve desensitization is the use of a GnRH antagonist. In contrast to the 
long-acting GnRH-agonists that after an initial stimulation (flare-up effect) inhibit pituitary 
gonadotropin secretion by desensitizing gonadotropins to GnRH via receptor down-regulation, the 
antagonists block the GnRH receptor in a dose-dependent competitive fashion and have no flare 
effect1; gonadotropin suppression is almost immediate. 
FSH is available as a recombinant peptide produced by cultured chinese hamster ovary cells 
(Gonal-f, Puregon). FSH derived from human menopausal urine is also available on the European 
market in combination with LH (hMG = human menopausal gonadotropin (e.g. Menopur)), or in 
purified forms derived from human menopausal urine. These different formulations are equally 
effective in achieving pregnancy2,3. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Bemfola contains recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (rhFSH; follitropin alfa) and was 
developed as a “similar biological medicinal product” using Gonal-f as a reference product, 
authorised in the EU (EMEA/H/C/71). 
The finished product is a solution for subcutaneous injection and is supplied in five different volume 
presentations in 1.5 ml glass cartridges, i.e. between 75 IU (0.125 ml) and 450 IU (0.75 ml) of a 
solution of 600 IU FSH/ml. The glass cartridge is assembled into a disposable pen-injector device. 
FSH is a glycoprotein hormone that is produced in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. FSH is 
indispensable for normal female and male gamete growth and maturation, and normal gonadal 
steroid production. Exogenous FSH is administered to stimulate multifollicular development in 
women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment (ART) or to induce ovulation in women with 
anovulatory infertility. 
The mechanism of action involves binding of the hormone with a specific cell surface receptor 
present only in reproductive organs. In females, FSH initiates follicular growth, specifically affecting 
granulosa cells. FSH levels vary with the follicular phase, thus determining the maturation of 
follicles to ovulation, FSH stimulates follicular development via binding to a specific FSH receptor.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance of Bemfola is follitropin alfa. 
Follitropin alfa consists of two non-covalently linked, non-identical glycoproteins designated as the 
alfa- and beta-subunits. The alfa- and beta-subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids, respectively. 
The alfa-subunit is identical to that of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), luteinizing hormone 
(LH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The beta-subunit is specific, and confers its specific 
biologic action and is responsible for interaction with the FSH receptor.  The molecular weight of the 
heterodimeric and glycosylated molecule is in the range of 30-34 KDalton, with the carbohydrate 
content being approximately 25-30%.   
The alfa chain has two N-glycosylation sites (Asn 52 and Asn 78) and the beta chain has two 
N-glycosylation sites (Asn 7 and Asn 24).   
Manufacture 
The active substance is produced by Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH, 
Klosterneuburg (KNB), Austria.   
Development genetics 
The transfection of the pre-adapted host cell line dihydrofolate reductase deficient Chinese Hamster 
Ovary cells (CHO DHFR-) with the plasmids coding for the alfa and beta-chain was performed under 
serum-free culture conditions, and was therefore free from materials of animal origin. 
The manufacturing process from an ampoule of the working cell bank does not contain any starting 
materials of biological origin. 
Cell banking system  
A two-tiered cell banking system of Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) was 
developed and maintained in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and 
ICH guidelines. The preparation of the MCB and the current WCB is sufficiently described. A range 
of tests was performed for their characterisation, in accordance with ICH guidelines, including tests 
for identity, viability, stability, and adventitious agents.

Figure 1 
General Overview of the active substance manufacturing process 
Fermentation process 
Each production run is carried out with production cells generated from one vial of the WCB. The 
cultivation system for cell propagation and production consists of two bioreactors, a first stirred 
tank bioreactor (up to 15 L) and a second perfusion bioreactor (up to 90 L) with an ultrasonic cell 
retention system. 
The fermentation process is sufficiently described and consists of a two-step batch process followed 
by a continuous harvesting from the second bioreactor operated in cell retention mode. Collection 
of supernatant is initiated after a cell density of at least 2 x 106 cells/ml is reached. Harvesting is 
performed in three-day intervals. Clarification is performed with a depth filter followed by 0.2 µm 
filtration.

A sample of cell suspension, the end of production cells (EOPCs), is taken from the second 
bioreactor at the day of the last production harvest to generate the end of production cell bank 
(EOPCB). Genetic stability of the production cell line/ EOPCs is sufficiently addressed. 
Purification process 
The downstream process is sufficiently described and consists of ultradiafiltration, anion exchange 
chromatography, ammonium sulphate precipitation and filtration, hydrophobic interaction 
chromatography followed by a second ultradiafiltration, hydroxyapatite chromatography and a 
terminal nanofiltration and sterile filtration.   
The purified active substance in 20mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 is stored under appropriate 
conditions until formulation into the finished product.   
Critical steps and intermediates 
The control strategy is based on parameters identified in a process parameter identification report, 
describing one (full-scale) pilot batch and three clinical batches, and a risk assessment report.  
The control strategy has been brought in line with principles and definitions described in ICH 
Q8(R2). Process parameters have been adequately identified and appropriate ranges for Critical 
Process Parameters (CPPs) have been laid down in the dossier. These ranges are linked to the virus 
validation studies. The control strategy is acceptable. 
The CHMP recommends conducting a full review of the CPPs and associated Normal Operating 
Ranges (NORs)/Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs) when 30 batches have been manufactured, and 
to submit these updated data. 
Process validation 
Process validation is based on a traditional approach, comprising the successful manufacture of 
three validation batches. This validation is extensively described and actual numerical data are 
given for all CPPs, Key Process Parameter (KPPs), and Non-Key Process Parameters (NKPPs). All 
parameters are within the predefined (set) limits. The validation is acceptable.  
Manufacturing process development 
It is noted that this dossier is a ‘traditional development’ according to ICH Q8 terminology. No 
Design Space or other Quality-by-Design elements are claimed. One version of the process has 
been presented in the dossier. This process was transferred from one site (Vienna) to the other 
(Klosterneuburg) with technical adaptations only. 
There were two production campaigns, where the first three consecutive batches were produced in 
the former facility located in Vienna and the second three consecutive batches were produced in the 
new facility located in Klosterneuburg, Austria. No significant changes were made to the production 
process other than the re-location to the new production site. An extensive comparability exercise 
was performed between active substance batches from both production sites and finished products 
thereof, including also new batches of reference medicinal finished product Gonal-f. No significant 
alterations to the product quality parameters were observed.

Characterisation and Impurities  
The elucidation of structure of Bemfola rhFSH, both in absolute terms and in comparison with 
Gonal-f, has been extensively investigated in the context of a series of three independent 
comparability studies (see also section on comparability) using orthogonal state-of-the-art 
methods which demonstrate that the active substance is well characterised.  
The following analytical methods were employed during characterisation: 
- 
Identity: polypeptide structure analysis and sequence verification by proteolytic cleavage 
and  MS  analysis,  polypeptide  mass  determination  of  both  subunits  prior  to  and  after 
deglycosylation,  C-terminus  and  N-terminus  integrity  by  proteolytic  cleavage  and  MS 
analysis, peptide mapping, Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE), Western Blotting, higher order protein structure by Circular Dichroism (CD) 
and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR). 
-  Glycans:  isoform  distribution  profile  by  Isoelectric  Focusing  (IEF)-Western  Blot,  relative 
quantification  of  isoforms  of  the  intact  protein  by  IEF,  comparison  of  isoforms  for  each 
subunit  by  2-dimensional  difference  in  gel  electrophoresis  (2D-DIGE),  carbohydrate 
structures of individual subunits by mass spectrometry (MS), monosaccharide composition 
including  sialic  acid,  sialic  acid  analysis  (N-Acetylneuraminic  acid  (NeuGc),  O-acetylated 
sialic  acids),  oligosaccharide  composition  by  mass  spectrometry,  mapping  of  native 
oligosaccharide  structures  by  High-Performance  Anion-Exchange  Chromatography  with 
Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD), including calculation of z-number, mapping 
of  neutral  oligosaccharide  structures  by  HPAEC-PAD,  site-specific  glycans  by  mass 
spectrometry. 
-  Content  per  container:  quantitative  Size-exclusion  chromatography  High-Performance 
Liquid Chromatography (SEC-HPLC), in vivo biological activity. 
- 
Purity:  aggregates  and  fragments  by  SEC-HPLC,  oxidized  species  by  Reversed  Phase 
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC), deamidated forms by RP-HPLC/MS. 
-  Other physicochemical tests: pH, osmolality, endotoxins. 
- 
Pharmacodynamics:  (in  vivo)  dose-response  curves  in  immature  rats,  specific  biological 
activity (IU/mg),  (in-vitro)  cAMP response  in CHO cell line transfected  with  human FSH 
receptor. 
The  process-related impurities  include  residual chemicals and  buffer components  present in  the 
upstream and downstream operations, the contact surfaces in their respective unit operations and 
contaminants like Host Cell Protein (HCP), residual DNA, endotoxins and microbial contamination. 
The  product-related  impurities  range  from  modifications  of  the  protein  backbone  (truncations, 
deamidation,  oxidation),  tri-  and  quaternary  structures  (aggregates  and  fragments)  to 
modifications of the glycan structures (N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA)).

Upon request by the CHMP, the applicant has introduced active substance specifications for the 
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA) content with a limit of ≤ 2.0%, for oxidized follitropin with a limit 
of ≤ 6.0%, for distribution of sialylated species (Z-number) by HPAEC-PAD with a limit  of 178-274, 
and for free subunits by non-reducing SDS-PAGE with a limit of≤ 3%.  
Additional justification for the specifications was provided, and the limits for purity by SEC-HPLC, 
and for endotoxins were amended in line with the new Ph. Eur. monograph Follitropin concentrated 
solution (01/2014:2286).  
Finally, the applicant has introduced Isoelectric Focus (IEF) as a routine test method for both 
identification and to control product-related impurities as already employed in the course of stability 
testing. 
Analytical methods are deemed sufficiently described and validated.  
Batch analysis data are limited to six batches, from two different facilities. At each facility, three 
batches were manufactured in one campaign. In addition, data from one full-scale pilot batch is 
available. This number does not constitute a firm basis for a statistical analysis. Therefore, it is 
recommended that the applicant submits updated batch analysis data and performs a full review of 
the active substance specifications when 30 batches have been manufactured. 
Several issues were identified in relation to the establishment of the Reference Standards (RS), 
which were sufficiently addressed. It is recommended that the applicant performs a comparison of 
the reference preparation to the follitropin Chemical Reference Standard (CRS) and inform the EMA 
of the outcome. 
Container closure system 
The active substance container closure system, i.e. sterile High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) 
narrow mouth bottles with polypropylene closures, is sufficiently described.  
Stability 
Stability data are available for 60 months from three batches manufactured in Vienna stored at 
2-8°C and ≤–20°C and 12 month data from three batches manufactured in Klosterneuburg stored 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 18/76 
 
  
  
 
at 2-8°C. An accelerated stability study at 25 ± 2°C for 12 months was completed for the 
aforementioned six GMP-batches of active substance. Additionally, stress testing at 37 ± 2°C for 3 
months was also completed for one GMP-batch of active substance from the first campaign and for 
one GMP-batch of active substance from the second campaign, where 6 months data are available. 
The stability data provided were within the specifications and support a shelf-life for Bemfola rhFSH 
active substance of 48 months, when stored at 2-8°C.  
Since stability studies are still on-going the applicant is obliged to finalise the stability studies and 
in accordance with EU GMP guidelines4, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant 
negative trends, should be reported to EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Bemfola is presented as a solution for injection in cartridge available in five different volume 
presentations of an identical concentration of 600 IU (44 mcg)/ml, i.e. 75 IU/0.125 ml, 150 IU/0.25 
ml, 225 IU/0.375 ml, 300 IU/ 0.5 ml and 450 IU/0.75 ml for subcutaneous administration (see 
Table below. The container closure system consist of a 1.5 ml Type I glass cartridges, sealed with a 
rubber disc with an aluminium over-seal (combi-seal) and containing a bromobutyl rubber plunger. 
The cartridges are assembled into disposable pen-injector devices as the delivery system.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The active substance is formulated with disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, sodium 
dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (buffer components), phosphoric acid (pH adjustment), sucrose 
(stabiliser), L-methionine (antioxidant), poloxamer 188 (stabiliser), and water for injections. 
Bemfola finished product has a nearly identical composition to the reference product Gonal-f. The 
only formulation difference to Gonal-f is that Bemfola does not contain the preservative m-cresol as 
Bemfola is a single-dose liquid preparation and inclusion of a preservative for a single dose 
preparation is unnecessary. The choice and function of the excipients are clearly described and 
justified. The cartridges, combination seals and plungers are standard components that were 
already in use at the manufacturer.

Adventitious Agents Safety Evaluation 
Control of materials of biological origin 
The manufacturing process starting from the WCB does not contain any starting materials of 
biological origin. The transfection of the CHO host cell line was performed under serum-free culture 
conditions. Only in the development of the cell line itself, thymidine purified from salmon sperm and 
porcine trypsin to disaggregate cells were used. The Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy 
(TSE) Risk Assessment Report summarizes all materials that are used in the production process. 
Most of the materials are from synthetic origin, from defined animal-free origin or from plant or 
microbial origin. No materials were derived from TSE-relevant animal species. The only materials 
derived from non TSE-relevant animal species are thymidine purified from salmon sperm and 
porcine trypsin. 
Testing of cell banks for adventitious agents 
The safety testing for adventitious agents in the MCB /WCB/ EOPCB is adequate and the results are 
satisfactory. 
In-process testing during manufacture 
In-process testing at appropriate steps in the manufacturing process for both the active substance 
and finished product are used to monitor for the presence of potential adventitious contamination 
that may be introduced from the manufacturing environment or raw materials used during 
manufacture. These controls are considered appropriate. 
Viral clearance studies 
For the viral clearance studies four model viruses according to guideline “Note for Guidance on Virus 
Validation Studies” (CPMP/BWP/268/95) were chosen and include: Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV, 
ssRNA, enveloped), Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV, ssRNA, enveloped), Reovirus Type 3 (REO, 
dsRNA, non-enveloped) and Murine Minute Virus (MMV, ssDNA, non-enveloped).  
For the evaluation of the capacity of the production process to remove or inactivate viruses, the 
following three production steps were validated: 
  Virus removal by anion exchange chromatography (AEX) (DEAE Sepharose FF);  
  Virus removal by combination of ammonium sulphate precipitation and hydrophobic 
interaction chromatography (HIC) (Phenyl-Sepharose 6FF);  
  Virus removal by duplicate nanofiltration using a 20 nm virus filter.  
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 20/76 
 
  
  
The double nanofiltration step is deemed sufficiently validated using a downscaled process and is 
the main process step to assure viral safety of the product. Together with the anion exchange two 
orthogonal effective steps are present. Virus removal by ammonium sulphate precipitation and HIC 
relies both on partition and the effect of high pH. Cumulative reduction factors are presented and 
sufficiently assure viral safety. Additional information is still sought on the role of high pH in the 
inactivation of MuLV and BVDV, therefore it is recommended that the applicant conducts a 
well-designed study (post-approval) that demonstrates that high pH robustly inactivates MuLV and 
BVDV. If necessary, a validated hold time will be introduced in the manufacturing process to ensure 
that demonstrated viral clearance is achieved in the routine manufacturing process. 
In conclusion, the safety of Bemfola in respect to viral contamination is adequately assured by the 
control materials, the chosen virus testing program and assessment of virus removal and 
inactivation by the manufacturing process. 
Control testing for release of active substance and finished product 
Following purification, the active substance is tested for bioburden and endotoxin and the finished 
product is tested for endotoxin and sterility.  
Overall, these controls assure that Bemfola finished product is free from adventitious agents and 
safe in its intended clinical use. 
Manufacture of the Product 
Finished product in cartridges is manufactured by CP Pharmaceuticals, Wrexham, UK. Assembly, 
labelling, packaging, testing and dispatching of pens is performed by AllPack AG, Reinach, 
Switzerland. The batch release for EU will be performed by Finox Biotech AG in Liechtenstein.  
The finished product manufacturing process is typical for filling of a biological product and is done by 
adding the active substance to the formulation buffer, sterilization of the formulated final bulk by 
filtration and filling into cartridges. A risk assessment study of relevant parts of the aseptic 
manufacturing processes was performed in order to justify that the final sterilising filter is not 
placed directly before the filling point. Appropriate in-process controls are in place. The 
manufacturing process was satisfactorily validated using three batches manufactured at 40, 58 and 
100% of the commercial batch size of 45 litres.

1 The in-vivo bioassay is only performed on the first filling lot of a new final formulated bulk. 
In general, the proposed specifications are sufficient to verify the quality of the finished product.  
Tests for free-subunits, glycan mapping and dose accuracy after assembly of cartridge and pen 
have been added to the finished product specifications. The applicant has properly justified that the 
establishment of a release specification for deamidation is not needed for this product. As 
recommended by the CHMP, the limits for protein content have been narrowed to the stated content

of ± 10% and the in vivo bioassay will only be performed on the first filling lot of a new final 
formulated bulk instead of on each filling lot. In addition, it is recommended that the applicant 
reviews the limits of a number of specifications (Z-number, free subunits, purity by SEC-HPLC, 
oxidized rhFSH) after manufacturing batch formulations of finished product from 30 different active 
substance batches.  
The analytical methods are clearly described and sufficiently validated.  
Sufficient batch analysis data have been provided in order to demonstrate the consistency of 
manufacture of the finished product. 
The same reference standards are used for the active substance and the finished product. 
Container closure system 
The finished product is filled into sterile Type I clear glass cartridges, sealed with a rubber disc with 
an aluminium over-seal (combi-seal) and containing a bromobutyl rubber plunger. Adequate 
information has been provided on the identity, properties and quality of the primary 
container/closure system. The components are manufactured from well-known materials and meet 
the Ph. Eur. criteria. 
The closed cartridge is irreversibly integrated in a disposable pen injector for self-administration.  
Once the cartridge and the pen device are assembled, the resulting pen injector is a sealed unit that 
cannot be disassembled without physically destroying the pen-injector. Although the pen injector is 
not a medical device by definition, it has been developed in accordance with the ISO standards for 
medical devices. 
Stability of the Product 
Long-term stability data at 2-8° C are available up the 36 months for three 75 IU rhFSH batches, 
one 150 IU rhFSH batch and three 450 IU rhFSH batches manufactured with active substance from 
the Vienna facility at 22% of the proposed formulated bulk full-scale. The bracketing approach for 
testing stability of Bemfola is considered acceptable. Recently, production of active substance was 
relocated to a new facility in Klosterneuburg, Austria. Twelve months stability results are available 
for finished product batches manufactured with active substance from this new facility. 
Comparability of both materials is sufficiently demonstrated to allow a shelf life of 36 months at 2-8 
°C. The experiments under stress conditions (37 ± 2°C) showed that Bemfola rhFSH solution for 
injection and Gonal-f alike are prone to deamidation and to lesser extent oxidation, but are 
otherwise stable for up to six months. 
The storage of the finished product at or below 25°C for 3 months within its shelf life has been 
properly substantiated by real-time/real-temperature data. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines5, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant 
negative trend, should be reported to EMA.

Comparability Exercise for Finished Medicinal Product  
Bemfola is a biosimilar product with Gonal-f as a reference medicinal product throughout the entire 
development program. Since the disposable Bemfola injector-pen is designed for administration of 
a single-dose of rhFSH, compared to the multiple-use injector pen presentations of Gonal-f, 
Bemfola finished product does not contain m-cresol. 
The applicant has clearly presented their analytical comparability exercises of Bemfola with Gonal-f. 
Three comparability exercises were performed. The first series of analyses were conducted in 2008, 
prior to the phase I clinical study on finished product formulated with m-cresol. This study 
encompasses only a limited number of analytical techniques. The second study was performed in 
2009/2010 and was more extensive. Besides comparability with Gonal-f as discussed hereinafter, 
the results of this study indicate comparability between the finished product formulation with and 
without m-cresol. The third study was performed in 2012, after the relocation of the active 
substance manufacturer from its Vienna-based facility to a new facility in Klosterneuburg (KNB). 
Extensive state-of-the-art characterisation studies using orthogonal methods were conducted on 
three active substance batches manufactured in the Vienna facility, three active substance batches 
manufactured in the Klosterneuburg facility, and three batches of Gonal-f RFF pens, 900 IU/1.5 ml 
(66 μg/1.5 ml) liquid formulation, European source. In addition, three batches of Bemfola finished 
product manufactured from Klosterneuburg active substance and one finished product batch 
manufactured from Vienna active substance were included in this study, albeit characterisation of 
these finished product batches is less extensive than the active substance batches. In general, the 
choice of the samples and design of the analytical comparability studies are considered adequate. 
The primary sequence of Bemfola and Gonal-f has been verified by proteolytic cleavage and ESI-ion 
trap-MS/MS analysis. Additional confirmation of comparability of the primary structure of Bemfola 
and Gonal-f was obtained by polypeptide mass determination of both subunits after deglycosylation 
and by peptide mapping of Lys-C digests. The alfa- and beta-subunits are each internally 
cross-linked with 5 disulphide bridges in the alfa-subunit and 6 disulphide bridges in the 
beta-subunit. The analysis of the disulfide bridges was hampered by the complex insoluble 
structures that were formed during analysis. Instead, indirect methods were used to confirm the 
conformational similarity, including CD-spectroscopy and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H 
NMR) data. 
N-terminal truncation of the FSH alfa-chain, lacking the first 2 amino acids AP, and N-terminal 
truncation of the FSH beta chain, lacking the first 2 amino acids NS, were observed for both Gonal-f 
and Bemfola batches. The level of truncation of the beta chain (around 55%) was similar for Gonal-f 
and Bemfola batches, irrespectively of the site of Bemfola active substance manufacture. The 
percentage of truncated alfa chain was similar for Bemfola active substance batches manufactured 
in the new KNB facility (4-5%) and Gonal-f (6-8%), but was higher in active substance batches 
manufactured in the Vienna location (11-22%), including the batch used in clinical trials (22%). 
According to the applicant it is unlikely that this difference has any impact on the efficacy and/or 
safety. No C-terminal truncation was observed. 
The level of oxidized FSH species and the level of deamidated FSH were comparable for Bemfola 
batches manufactured in both facilities and Gonal-f. Circular dichroism (far-UV-CD) analysis of 
Bemfola batches of both manufacturing sites and Gonal-f batches showed identical spectroscopic 
features of all batches. No aggregates and no fragments were detected in Gonal-f batches and

Bemfola batches by SEC-HPLC. Also SDS-PAGE and Western blotting revealed no differences 
between Bemfola batches manufactured with active substance from the Vienna and KNB facilities. 
However, Bemfola active substances and corresponding finished products appear at a slightly 
higher molecular weight than Gonal-f batches in the SDS-PAGE analysis as a result of minor 
differences in the micro heterogeneity of the glycan profile (see below). 
Isoform distribution profiles and a relative quantification of isoforms of the entire protein following 
fluorescent labelling showed batch-to-batch variability for both Bemfola and Gonal-f. Both methods 
reveal only minor differences in the IEF pattern of Bemfola Vienna, Bemfola KNB and Gonal-f with 
respect to relative distribution. This was also found by comparison of isoforms for each subunit by 
a sensitive two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis method. The slightly lower molecular 
weight of Gonal-f compared to Bemfola active substances and finished product was also observed 
by this method.   
Determination of monosaccharide composition and sialic acid analysis (N-acetyl- and N-glycolyl 
neuraminic acid) clearly demonstrate a similar composition of monosacharides, NeuAc and NeuGC 
in both products. Glycan structures on the alfa- or the beta-chain were studied by mass 
spectrometry. Similar glycan structures were found in both products for the alfa-chain. For the 
beta-chain the fingerprint and glycan structures were also similar to Gonal-f, but higher antennarity 
detected for Bemfola. Analysis of isolated oligosaccharides from the protein backbone by 
HPAEC-PAD indicates a slight shift from disialo to tetrasialo structures for Bemfola KNB relatively to 
Gonal F (see Table below).  Mapping of neutral sugars also indicates that Bemfola displays slightly 
more of higher antennary structures than Gonal-f. However, considering the batch-to-batch 
variation, these differences can be regarded as small. For instance, the differences in Z numbers (a 
measure of the relative amounts of asialo,  mono- di-, tri, and tetrasialylated N-glycans) in the two 
comparability studies (study V02: Bemfola: Z = 229–233; Gonal-f: Z = 225–227; study V3: 
Bemfola 227-246; Gonal-f: 221 – 233) are much smaller than the variation allowed in the Ph. Eur. 
monograph for follitropin (178 – 274 when using the PAD method). Differences in the antennarity 
between the two products could be assigned to glycosylation site 2 (N78 on the alfa-chain) and 
glycosylation site 3 (N7 on the beta-chain). The most complex glycosylation site N7 also revealed 
the highest batch-to-batch variation within both product groups.

Bemfola 
  Gonal-f  
The applicant pointed out that 2.5% of the sialic acid residues of the alfa-subunit of Gonal-f samples 
contain an O-acetyl group. This was based on a low signal in the ES I-MS spectrum of the Gonal-f 
FSH, whereas the signal for Bemfola was below the level of detection. The applicant sufficiently 
justified that this difference does not have any relevance.  
No differences were observed on the stated biological activity of 600 IU/ml (526 – 648 IU/ml for 
Bemfola finished product, 555 – 595 IU/ml for Gonal-f and the specific biological activity, indicating 
an identical specific biological activity.  
In many studies it was necessary to concentrate the (Gonal-f) finished product samples. The 
suitability of these systems in preserving the structural integrity and overall quality of rhFSH 
(extracted from finished product versus active substance) was satisfactorily addressed. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
During the evaluation procedure a number of Other Concerns has been raised related to the 
manufacture of active substance and the associated control strategy, active substance and finished 
product specifications and their justification, analytical method validation of both active substance 
and finished product, the Duopen and to the reference standards.  
The applicant has provided responses and, with regards to the biological and pharmaceutical 
aspects of Bemfola, the CHMP considers that all issues have been satisfactorily addressed by the 
applicant and a list of recommendations has been agreed as listed below.  
Conclusions on comparability exercise 
The applicant has clearly presented their analytical comparability exercises of Bemfola with Gonal-f. 
The choice of the samples and design of the analytical comparability studies are considered 
adequate. Powerful modern techniques were employed for elucidating and comparing the 
polypeptide backbone, the heterogeneity of the backbone and its degradation products. Also the 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1

complex carbohydrate structure of FSH was extensively studied in Bemfola active substance 
batches manufactured in the former Vienna facility and the current KNB facility and FSH isolated 
from Gonal-f batches using orthogonal techniques.  
No qualitative differences in rhFSH were observed between Bemfola and Gonal-f and evidence for a 
highly similar physicochemical quality profile was obtained. Bemfola is not claimed to be fully 
identical to Gonal-f and, as can be expected for complex molecules manufactured by two processes, 
some minor differences were observed with regard to the glycosylation profile:  
- the ratio of tetra-antennary to di-antennary structures is for Bemfola slightly higher 
compared to Gonal-f  
- for the most complex glycosylation site 3 (beta subunit), slight differences in distribution 
of fucosyl residues in relation to antennarity were observed between Bemfola and Gonal-f. 
- a small amount of the sialic acid residues  of the alfa-subunit of Gonal-f samples contain 
an O-acetyl group, whereas the level in Bemfola was below detection. 
These minor differences are in line with the similarity principle. A major impact on the efficacy and 
safety profile is not expected. 
In summary, it is concluded that Bemfola and Gonal-f show a highly similar physico-chemical and 
biological quality profile. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Overall, the quality of Bemfola is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved 
recombinant DNA products. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active 
substance are adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well 
characterised with regard to its physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of 
the-art methods, and appropriate specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished 
product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is 
controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. Viral safety and the safety concerning other 
adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
Biosimilarity with the reference medicinal product Gonal-f has been sufficiently demonstrated. From 
a quality point of view, the observed differences and levels of these differences have been well 
documented and are acceptable. 
The overall quality of Bemfola is considered acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 29/76 
 
  
  
 
 
 
1. 
To conduct a full review of the CPPs and associated NORs/PARs when 30 batches have been 
manufactured, and to submit these updated data. 
2. 
To perform a review of the active substance specification (individual tests and limits applied) 
as soon as analytical data for the release of 30 batches of Bemfola rhFSH active substance 
are available. 
3. 
To perform a comparison of the reference preparation to the follitropin CRS and inform the 
EMA/CHMP of the outcome. 
4. 
To conduct at a well-designed study that demonstrates that high pH robustly inactivates 
MuLV and BVDV. If necessary, a validated hold time will be introduced in the manufacturing 
process to ensure that demonstrated viral clearance is achieved in the routine 
manufacturing process. 
5. 
To perform a review of the finished product acceptance criteria for purity by SEC-HPLC, 
oxidised rhFSH forms, N-glycans (Z-number) and free subunits after manufacturing batch 
formulations of finished product from 30 different active substance batches. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant claims Bemfola to be similar to Gonal-f, used as the reference product and registered 
via the centralised procedure on 20 October 1995 by Merck Serono Europe Ltd. 
The  development  strategy  was  based  on  demonstrating  the  physicochemical  and  biological 
comparability of Bemfola with Gonal-f. 
The  non-clinical  testing  includes  a  demonstration  of  similar  receptor  “binding”  and  activation 
properties of Bemfola and Gonal-f and induction of a functional response in human FSH-receptor 
bearing cells (study FSHR/DR/001-01). In vivo tests of biological activity by the Steelman-Polhey 
assay were used to compare both compounds. Pharmacokinetic (Study 23326), single-dose toxicity 
(Study 23325) and repeat-dose toxicity (Study 23327) studies were conducted in order to evaluate 
differences in the pharmacokinetic and toxicological profile of the two FSH formulations. 
Scientific  advice  regarding  the  non-clinical  evaluation  program  was  obtained  from  the  EMA 
(EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/  593346/2008;  Procedure  EMEA/H/SA/1147/1/2008/SME/III)  and  from  the 
Austrian Health Authority, AGES (31 July 2008). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro

Receptor affinity was studied using a HEK293 cell line expressing the hFSHR. In this assay three 
batches of Bemfola (KD 0.808 – 0.862) showed comparable affinity as three Gonal-f batches (KD 
0.687 - 0.962 nM). The Applicant conducted an in vitro study to compare the pharmacological 
activity of Bemfola and Gonal-f (Study report FSHR/DR/001-01) in which CHO cells stably 
expressing rhFSH receptor were used. Formation of cAMP was measured by a commercial 
competitive enzyme immunoassay. Three Gonal-f and three Bemfola batches were evaluated. Each 
batch was assayed over a range from 0.1 to 5000 mIU/mL. Four replicates for each concentration 
were assayed. A mean value of maximum cAMP concentration of 1189 fmol was obtained for 
Bemfola and 1130 fmol for Gonal-f, respectively. The mean value of ED50 was 94.4 mIU/ml for 
Bemfola and 73.7 mIU/ml for Gonal-f, indicating a similar binding to the hFSH receptor and 
triggering the second messenger cascade. 
In vivo 
The Applicant also conducted the Steelman-Pohley assay to determine the potency of three drug 
substance batches and 3 drug product batches. The same was done for Gonal-f (drug product) 
batches. The results from the Steelman-Pohley assay indicate that the potency of Bemfola drug 
substance is consistent and comparable to Gonal-f before and after the production site-switch.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with Bemfola. The pharmacological 
profile of hFSH is well known and it is considered unnecessary to investigate any secondary 
pharmacodynamic effects of Bemfola. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted with Bemfola. No pharmacological effects on 
other organ systems except the gonads would be anticipated with Bemfola. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with Bemfola. 
Recombinant hFSH has been available clinically for a number of years and possible interactions 
based on its pharmacological activity are well recognised and reflected in the Summaries of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) for the existing r-hFSH products, Gonal-f and Puregon (Merck-Serono, 
1995; Organon, 1996).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Determination of FSH in application solutions and rat sera 
The determination of Bemfola and Gonal-f concentrations in rat serum samples was performed with 
an FSH-specific solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The FSH ELISA is based 
on the sandwich principle. The validation study showed acceptable accuracy, precision, sensitivity 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1

and stability of samples after three freeze-thaw cycles or storage for 4 weeks at -20˚C. The method 
was considered suitable for determination of Bemfola and Gonal-f in application solutions and rat 
sera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
Absorption 
The single dose pharmacokinetics study comprised 4 groups, each with 5 female rats. The amounts 
of the test item and the reference item were adjusted to each animal’s current body weight on the 
day  of  administration.  Intravenous  and  subcutaneous  routes  of  administration  were  selected 
because the subcutaneous route is the anticipated route for human clinical use, but also to assess 
the bioavailability. 
Absorption of Bemfola was compared to Gonal-f after single subcutaneous application to rats. Cmax 
was reached after 6 h for both products and was 72.29 mIU/ml and 65.81 mIU/ml for Bemfola and 
Gonal–f, respectively. The absolute bioavailability of Bemfola and Gonal-f were 73.2 and 61.9%, 
respectively. No significant differences were detected in the absorption of the two products. 
Distribution 
No specific distribution studies have been conducted with Bemfola. Given the absence of any 
indication of differences in pharmacokinetic behaviour between Bemfola and Gonal-f, it is 
considered acceptable not to have conducted specific distribution studies with Bemfola.   
Metabolism 
No specific metabolism studies have been conducted with Bemfola. Given the absence of any 
indication of differences in pharmacokinetic behaviour between Bemfola and Gonal-f, it is 
considered acceptable not to have conducted specific metabolism studies with Bemfola.   
Excretion 
The excretion of follitropin alfa, including the half-lives after i.v. administration and after s.c. 
administration have been measured as a part of single dose pharmacokinetics study. The routes of 
excretion are not expected to be different from Gonal-f. The main mechanisms of clearance appear 
to be the hepatic or the renal routes [Rose et al 2000]. Excretion in milk has not been described, but 
r-hFSH will not be used during lactation. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No specific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted with Bemfola. Given the 
absence of any indication of differences in pharmacokinetic behaviour between Bemfola and 
Gonal-f, it is considered acceptable not to have conducted specific drug interaction studies with 
Bemfola.   
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Comparative single dose and repeated dose toxicity studies with Bemfola and Gonal-f were 
performed in rats. The Applicant followed guidance in accordance with the original version (released 
in 2005) of the guideline CHMP/42832/05 (Similar Biological Medicinal Products containing 
Biotechnology-Derived Proteins as Active Substance: Non-Clinical and Clinical Issues), although 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 32/76 
 
  
  
single dose toxicity studies are not advised in this document. Furthermore, the recently released 
Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products 
containing recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) 
(EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010) states that generally, separate repeated dose toxicity studies 
are not required. 
Single dose toxicity 
A single subcutaneous administration of 600 IU Bemfola/kg or 600 IU of Gonal-f/kg to rats did not 
reveal any signs of toxicity. No mortality occurred during the 14 day-observation period. All animals 
gained the expected body weight throughout the whole study period. There were no macroscopic 
findings during necropsy. No local intolerance reactions were noted. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
In the repeated dose toxicity study in male and female rats no local or systemic adverse effects 
were noted after administration of either FSH up to 300 IU/kg/day for 28 days. Only minimal effects 
on the ovarian were noted (increased number of follicles). Also, at the end of the study 4 out 10 
animals in the high dose Bemfola group showed vaginal tissue in proestrus, whereas placebo control 
animals showed none. 
FSH serum levels were dose-dependently increased on the first day of dosing and no differences 
between Bemfola and Gonal-f were observed. At the end of the study FSH levels were generally 
very low, which is explained by the formation of anti-hFSH antibodies. The observed antigenicity in 
rats is not considered predictive for humans. 
Genotoxicity, Carcinogenicity and Reproductive toxicity  
Genotoxicity  studies  are  not  required  for  a  biosimilar  medicinal  product.  Genotoxic  effects  of 
gonadotropins are not expected because of their mechanism of action. This is in accordance with 
both the ICH S6 guideline on the development of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (Note for 
guidance  on  preclinical  safety  evaluation  of  biotechnology-derived  pharmaceuticals; 
CPMP/ICH/302/95) and the CHMP guideline on the development of biosimilar products (Guideline 
on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  biotechnology-derived  proteins  as  active 
substances: non-clinical and clinical issues; EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005). 
Studies on Reproductive Toxicity have not been performed, both for the well-known mechanism of 
action of FSH and in accordance with the CHMP guideline on the development of biosimilar products 
(Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as 
active substances: non-clinical and clinical issues; EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005). 
Toxicokinetics 
Toxicokinetic  evaluation  was  carried  in  satellite  rats  of  the  4  week-repeat  dose  toxicity  study. 
Serum FSH concentrations were determined after the first administration of Bemfola or Gonal-f on 
day 1 – 2 and after the last administration of each compound on day 28. Toxicokinetic parameters 
following sc administration of  Bemfola or Gonal-f on day 1-2 are given in the following table as 
mean values. On study day 28 serum FSH levels were extremely variable between animals and 
ranged from below the quantification limit (<12.5 mIU/mL) to 4208 mIU/mL. These differences 
were demonstrated to be connected to the development of immune response. There were a higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 33/76 
 
  
  
number  of  male  rats  having  undetectable  FSH  levels  compared  to  female  rats.  The  number  of 
animals with low or undetectable serum FSH levels was comparable for Bemfola and Gonal-f in all 
study groups. The available data did not allow for calculation of PK parameter. 
Local tolerance 
Local tolerance was investigated in the course of the repeated dose toxicity study. In the repeated 
dose toxicity study in male and female rats no local adverse effects were noted after administration 
of either FSH up to 300 IU/kg/day for 28 days.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bemfola has the same structure and activity as endogenous FSH. FSH is a pituitary hormone that 
controls the reproductive system in both males and females. Given the characteristics above, the 
performance of specific studies for Environmental Risk Assessment was not requested as proteins 
are biodegradable in the environment.  
Therefore, Bemfola is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Bemfola and Gonal-f have been shown to have similar receptor binding. Similar pharmacological 
effects have been verified in an in vitro receptor activation assay in which CHO cells stably 
expressing the FSH receptor were used, where both FSH formulations showed equivalent activation 
after binding to the FSH receptor as measured by cAMP production.  
Bemfola was shown to exhibit comparable in vivo biological activity to Gonal-f. These data were 
obtained in the in-vivo model according to the method published by Steelman and Pohley 1953, 
which measures the increase in ovary weights in female rats.  
In summary, the pharmacology results thus far suggest that the pharmacological effects of Bemfola 
and Gonal-f are similar. Although it has not been resolved why it was not possible to demonstrate 
the presence of the hFSHR in the CHO cell line used to compare functional activity of Bemfola and 
Gonal-f, the Applicant provided evidence to accept this assay for a comparability exercise. 
Additional data from a HEK293 cell assay are less convincing, but in view of the CHO cell assay data 
which are in line with the quality data showing high similarity and other non-clinical and clinical data 
confirming biosimilarity we conclude that the issue needs not be pursued any further. 
No significant differences in exposure were noted for Bemfola and Gonal-f following single dose 
subcutaneous or intravenous administration.  
Comparative single dose and repeated dose toxicity studies with Bemfola and Gonal-f were 
performed in rats. The Applicant followed guidance in accordance with CHMP/42832/05 (Similar 
Biological Medicinal Products containing Biotechnology-Derived Proteins as Active Substance: 
Non-Clinical and Clinical Issues) and CHMP’s Scientific Advice, although single dose toxicity studies 
are not advised in these documents. Furthermore, the recently released Guideline on non-clinical 
and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 34/76 
 
  
  
follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010) states that generally, 
separate repeated dose toxicity studies are not required.  
Single dose subcutaneous administration of 600 IU/kg of either FSH did not cause any toxicity in 
rats and in the repeated dose toxicity study in male and female rats no local or systemic adverse 
effects were noted after administration of either FSH up to 300 IU/kg/day for 28 days. Only minimal 
effects on the ovaria were noted (increased number of follicles), whereas a more prominent 
pharmacological effect was expected. Probably this is a consequence of the young age (36-38 days) 
of the rats at the start of dosing. FSH serum levels were dose-dependently increased on the first day 
of dosing and no differences between Bemfola and Gonal-f were observed. At the end of the study 
FSH levels were generally very low, which is explained by the formation of anti-hFSH antibodies. 
The observed antigenicity in rats is not considered predictive for humans. 
No studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity or other 
toxicity were conducted, which is considered acceptable for a biosimilar FSH. 
The non-clinical data support the view that the active substance of Bemfola is the same or highly 
similar to the active substance of Gonal-f.  
Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view Bemfola and Gonal-f are considered biosimilar.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
According to the applicant, all clinical trials were conducted in compliance with the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki (as amended in Tokyo, Venice, and Hong Kong, Somerset West, Edinburgh, 
Washington). All studies were performed in compliance with the CHMP/ICH “Note for Guidance on 
Good Clinical Practice” (CPMP/ICH/135/95). Additionally, the development program was carried out 
considering the CHMP “Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products” (CHMP/437/04) and is 
consistent with the draft CHMP “Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar 
biological medicinal products containing recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone 
(r-hFSH)”. 
The Applicant has filed two GCP serious breach reports to the MHRA about one of the UK sites (8200) 
in the FIN3001 study. The MHRA was notified on 31 October 2012. Protocol violations that were 
identified were inclusion of non-eligible patients, and the blind of the ultrasound scans was 
potentially compromised. Site 8200 included 42 patients. Based on these findings, the Applicant 
indicated that there was a potential impact to scientific value/data credibility. 
A routine GCP inspection was agreed on by the EMA, investigating three sites, including Site 8200.

Site 8200 
Several findings were identified by the inspectors during this GCP inspection that have an impact on 
the reliability and validity of the dataset for this site (a number of the areas of non-compliance 
presented in the inspection report for site 8200 had already been identified by the NHS Trust in an 
internal audit and associated report and/or the sponsor in their serious breach report submitted to 
MHRA prior to the inspection). The conclusion of the GCP inspection report is that the trial cannot be 
considered to have been conducted in accordance with ICH GCP at this site. 
The Rapporteurs agreed with the IIR conclusions and the fact that the quality and integrity of the 
data might have been affected at site 8200. 
As a result of the GCP inspection, the applicant was requested during the clockstop to provide a 
re-analysis of the Efficacy and Safety data of the Phase III study without the inclusion of site 8200 
data (of 42 patients). The applicant was requested to submit the results of this new analysis along 
with the responses to the LOQ (D121).  
Site 4000 and site 7000  
The GCP inspection performed at site 4000 and site 7000 showed that the data recorded and 
reported by these sites are in general trustworthy and reliable and that the subjects did receive 
adequate information and that they were well taken care off.  Therefore, in the Rapporteurs opinion, 
another GCP-inspection was not necessary, as the inspectors concluded that the data collected at 
the sites 4000 and 7000 could be used for evaluation and assessment of the application. 
Due to GCP issues identified at the UK site 8200, it was decided to exclude the subjects from this 
site from all analyses. Without site 8200, 372 patients were randomized.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant characterised the pharmacokinetics of Bemfola in the phase I study FIN1001. Study 
FIN1001 was a comparative study to compare the pharmacokinetics of Bemfola and Gonal-f after 
single subcutaneous application, in healthy volunteers. In this study, the increase in 17ß-estradiol 
(E2) serum concentration and the immunogenicity of Bemfola and Gonal-f were also assessed and 
compared, safety was monitored descriptively. Repeat-dose PK studies have not been conducted 
because repeated administration of FSH to healthy volunteers would not be acceptable for ethical 
reasons. Such a study is also not required according to the guideline on biosimilar rFSH. 
Study FIN1001 was conducted as a single centre study in Austria under the sponsorship of Polymun 
Scientific GmbH between January and August 2009. The study is a randomised, open label, two 
period, two treatment cross-over study in 24 healthy female volunteers, with a duration of 11 
weeks. A single dose of the test product Bemfola and reference product Gonal-f, both containing 
300 IU/0.5 ml, follitropin alfa were administered subcutaneously after down-regulation of the 
endogenous production of FSH. Down-regulation was performed with a GnRH agonist, leuprorelin 
(Enantone-Gyn). Eligible subjects received Enantone-Gyn (day 15-21 of contraception) for the 
down regulation of their endogenous FSH levels. After 10 days (study day 1) blood was collected 
and serum E2 and FSH were analysed to confirm down regulation.  
In study FIN1001 the pharmacokinetic serum samples were collected until 192 hours after the first 
FSH injection. The analytical assessment of serum r-h FSH levels was performed at the central 
laboratory of the university hospital Vienna (KIMCL) using bioanalytical method FSH/V001R/0309. 
The r-hFSH concentrations in human serum were analysed with a COBAS test system. 
The r-h FSH PK parameters were assessed by non-compartmental analysis. Standard 
pharmacokinetic variables AUC, Cmax, tmax and t1/2 were estimated for r-h FSH. 
The statistical method used was the difference method.

In study FIN1001, the protocol was amended by an additional secondary study objective, namely 
the increase in 17ß-estradiol (E2) serum concentration (AUC) after single application of Bemfola 
and Gonal-f. The exposure (AUC0-120h) to 17ß-estradiol (E2) were 3304.3 ± 2252.88 pg. h/ml after 
administration of a single dose of Bemfola compared to 2624 ± 1750.60 pg. h/ml after a single dose 
of Gonal-f. The results of the pharmacokinetic analysis of E2 are summarised in figure PK02.

The administration of both follitropin alfa formulations was well tolerated, a total of 4 adverse 
events were assessed as related to either follitropin alfa or the combination of follitropin alfa and 
Enantone-Gyn. One adverse event (abnormal ultrasound) led to the discontinuation of a subject. 
No specific antibodies to FSH were detected.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Follitropin alfa consists of two non-covalently linked, non-identical glycoproteins designated as the 
α- and β- subunits. The α- and β- subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids, respectively. The empirical 
formula is C975H1513N267O304S26. The molecular weight of the heterodimeric and glycosylated 
molecule is in the range of 30000-34000 Dalton, with the carbohydrate content being 
approximately 25-30%. The basic building blocks of FSH are amino acids and sugars, which are 
chiral molecules. Bemfola is produced biologically and will only contain natural (L-)amino acids and 
sugars. 
The mechanism of action of FSH is the same in all indications and FSH binds either to the ovarian or 
testicular FSH receptor. No separate pharmacodynamic study was conducted. The 
pharmacodynamic parameters were taken into account in one Phase III trial FIN3001 comparing 
Bemfola with Gonal-f in patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. The measured serum 
levels were: FSH and estradiol. 
In addition, other pharmacodynamic parameters that were taken into account were ‘total r-hFSH 
dose’, ‘number of days of r-hFSH stimulation’ and ‘number and size of follicles’. These parameters 
are discussed in section “Clinical Efficacy”, as these are closely linked to the primary endpoint of the 
Phase III trial ‘number of oocytes retrieved’. 
In trial FIN3001 pituitary down-regulation was achieved with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
(GnRH) agonist. The GnRH-agonist was administered according to center’s procedures (e.g. 
Decapeptyl 0.1 mg/day; other formulations were allowed by the protocol according to the 
corresponding SPCs. GnRH depot formulations or nasal sprays were not allowed). The patient 
received a fixed subcutaneous dose of 150 IU of rFSH (either Gonal-f or Bemfola) once daily for at 
least 6 days. This fixed dose of 150 IU was maintained throughout the study period unless there was 
a risk of imminent OHSS (as judged by the investigator, no definition was provided in the protocol 
for imminent OHSS). Following confirmation of adequate follicular development (at least 1 follicle ≥ 
18 mm and 2 additional follicles ≥16 mm), hCG (Ovitrelle) was to be administered for final follicular 
maturation and triggering of ovulation. 
Based on FSH levels, adequate down-regulation was achieved at baseline in both groups (see table 
below).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The relative pharmacokinetic properties of the Bemfola and Gonal-f were determined in a single 
dose cross-over study FIN1001. Based on study FIN1001 bioequivalence may be concluded.  
The sampling scheme of study FIN1001 was not appropriate for a reliable estimate of peak 
exposure. Misspecification of the Cmax may have occurred due to the fact that the there was a 8 hour 
interval around tmax. However, because both the shape of the concentration time curves (see figure 
PK02) and the total exposure (AUC0-192h) to r-hFSH are similar in both treatment groups no major 
differences in Cmax are expected. Therefore the potential misspecification of Cmax is not expected to 
be an indication of clinical differences between Bemfola and Gonal-f. 
Figure 4 
Mean 192-hour profiles of Bemfola vs Gonal-f 
The analytical report of study FIN1001 and the validation report for the analytical method 
FSH/V001R/0309 were submitted. The analytical method FSH/V001R/0309 has been validated 
according to ICH Guideline Q2R1 and ISO 5725. The applicant showed that there is no 
cross-reactivity to be expected from structurally related compounds, such as LH, TSH, hCG, hGH 
and hPL. An acceptable justification has been provided concerning the selectivity and carry-over: 
endogenous interferences have been tested during the IVD certification of the test kit with different 
types of plasma and as no concomitant medications were allowed, interference with exogenous 
compounds is excluded; carry-over was reduced to a minimum due to intensive washing steps in 
combination with the relatively low concentrations measured during this study. A certificate of 
analysis for Bemfola and Gonal-f was submitted in order to adequately document the reference 
material. Only one batch of FSH calibrator (#182187) was used for all assays and therefore the 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 41/76 
 
  
  
 
 
 
analytical performance of the method when changing reagent batches have not been investigated. 
The precision and accuracy has not been evaluated according to the current guideline, however the 
applicant provided additional information showing that the accuracy of the applied assay is to be 
expected within acceptable limits. Furthermore the applicant has demonstrated that the results of 
study FIN1001 are in line with routine FSHs tests performed at the central laboratory of the 
university hospital Vienna (KIMCL). Parallelism has also not been tested in accordance with the 
current guideline; however, no interferences are to be expected and concentrations measured were 
relatively low.  
Random fluctuations of the (endogenous) FSH concentrations are observed in the last three time 
points of the pharmacokinetic curve. Therefore the applicant also determined the AUC over the first 
120h after administration and compared both treatments. The analysis of the AUC0-120h data 
supports the bioequivalence conclusions. 
Endogenous FSH production has a circadian rhythm and is fluctuating throughout the day. The 
diurnal rhythm was not taken into account since all drug applications were performed at the same 
time of the day (± one hour) and therefore the variation in FSH concentration due to endogenous 
FSH production is expected to be similar for all subjects. The baseline FSH values subtracted for the 
calculation of PK parameter were obtained at visit 3 and visit 13 directly before drug administration.  
The range of doses used in stimulation protocols is large and five presentations between 75 IU and 
450 IU are proposed by the applicant. The bioequivalence study was conducted with the 225 IU 
dose, as the 225 IU dose is a commonly used, effective and safe dosage. The 225 IU dose was 
shown to lie within the linear dose range of the comparator product (Gonal-f) and is considered 
suitable to detect differences in the PK profiles between the test and reference product. 
Plasmon Surface Resonance method used to detect antibodies to FSH is considered appropriate and 
the applicant sufficiently justified not complying with the guideline EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 
(especially for the determination of selectivity, dilutional linearity, parallelism and ISR).  
Pharmacodynamics 
Investigating the PD parameters as part of the phase III trial is acceptable, and in line with the 
‘Draft guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products 
containing recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-FSH; 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010)’. 
In the draft guideline EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010 also inhibin-B, luteinizing hormone (LH) and 
progesterone are indicated as one of the pharmacodynamics parameters that should be taken into 
account. The guideline, however, appeared after the Phase III trial was conducted by the Applicant. 
Inhibin-B, as well as estradiol, correlates with the number of follicles seen on an ovarian ultrasound. 
As sufficient other pharmacodynamic parameters were measured (estradiol levels, FSH levels, 
number and size of follicles), the lack of inhibin-B, LH and progesterone levels is not considered an 
issue. 
Based on the estradiol and FSH concentrations, Bemfola is considered slightly more potent than 
Gonal-f, e.g. on the day of hCG administration the median estradiol level for Bemfola was slightly 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 42/76 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher compared to Gonal-f: 7090.4 pmol/L and 6606.0 pmol/L, respectively. However, these 
differences are considered small in light of the range of the estradiol concentrations on the Day of 
hCG administration varying from 107.9 pmol/L to 39669.0 pmol/L. Furthermore, on Stimulation 
Day 8 the median E2 levels were similar in both treatment groups. 
The Applicant has provided the E2 serum concentration profiles for the Phase III trial for treatment 
cycle 1. The E2 serum levels are not statistically significantly different from each other in both 
treatment groups. The E2 measurements in the local and central laboratories were in agreement 
with each other. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant provided the analytical report in which the most relevant details on the methodology 
and the study results were presented. The applicant has also demonstrated that the results of study 
FIN1001 are in line with routine FSHs tests performed at KIMCL. The applicant provided the KIMCL 
proficiency testing data which were obtained for the intra-laboratory test program in 2009 and also 
compare these data to the results of study FIN1001. 
FSH and estradiol concentrations were slightly higher on the day of hCG administration in FIN3001. 
However, these differences are considered small in light of the range of the estradiol and FSH 
concentrations on the Day of hCG administration, and are in accordance with the concept of 
biosimilarity.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No specific dose-response studies were undertaken in the light of this application. In general ART 
stimulation therapies take 7 to 19 days, and the dose of 150 IU / day FSH was chosen on the basis 
of the results of previous studies in which the differences in efficacy between lower and higher daily 
doses did not appear to negatively impact the outcome of treatment. Furthermore, this dose is 
consistent with the approved dose of the reference medicinal product (Gonal-f) in the studied 
indication. The Applicant also refers to the Phase 1 study results, were they feel that the safe use of 
the proposed dose and the bioequivalence of these two FSH formulations was demonstrated. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Proof of clinical efficiency was based on one phase III FIN3001 study to support efficacy and safety.

Treatments  
In eligible patients, the endogenous FSH production was down-regulated with a GnRH-agonist 
(Figure 1). The GnRH-agonist was administered according to center’s procedures (e.g. Decapeptyl 
0.1 mg/day; other formulations were allowed by the protocol according to the corresponding SPCs. 
Depot formulations or nasal sprays were not allowed). 
Down-regulation was performed within 14 to 21 days at the latest. Patient’s treatment with the 
GnRH agonist was allowed to be extended until down-regulation was confirmed by E2 level or 
ultrasound, but not more than 35 days. GnRH-agonist administration continued until end of 
r-hFSH-administration. The patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio (Bemfola:Gonal-f), and 
received a fixed subcutaneous dose of 150 IU of rFSH once daily for at least 6 days; afterwards 
ultrasonic assessment and E2 level measurements for patient’s safety reasons were performed. 
This fixed dose of 150 IU throughout the study period was maintained unless in case of risk of 
imminent OHSS (as judged by the principal investigator, no definition was provided in the protocol). 
The maximum days of rFSH administration according to the protocol was 16 days. 
Ovulation was induced by hCG (Ovitrelle, 250 µg) administration if at least 1 follicle reached a 
diameter of ≥ 18 mm and 2 additional follicles reached a diameter of ≥ 16 mm. If the E2 level raised 
concern about the safety status of the patient, the investigator was allowed to reduce the hCG dose. 
The administration of hCG was done the same evening or within 24 hours after the criteria for 
induction of ovulation had been met. Oocyte retrieval was taken place 36 to 38 hours after 
administration hCG. 
Utrogestan (micronized progesterone) was used as luteal support at a concentration of 3 x 200 
mg/day, vaginally administered. The support treatment was started at the day of oocyte retrieval or 
embryo/blastocyst  transfer until after the confirmation  of  clinical  pregnancy up  to visit 11 after 
oocyte retrieval or upon a negative serum β-hCG test at visit 10.

A maximum of two embryos were transferred 2 to 5 days after oocyte retrieval. Pregnancy rate was 
determined  biochemically  (β-hCG  test)  and  clinically  (intrauterine  gestational  sac  with  heart 
activity). 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  the  equivalence  of  Bemfola  compared  to  Gonal-f  in 
infertile but ovulatory women undergoing superovulation for ART.

Randomisation 
Randomistion was performed using a central randomisation system. Since the average number of

applied.  
Blinding 
Due to the different visual appearance of the two pens (Gonal-f pen and the Bemfola pen), a 
double-blind design of the Phase III study was not feasible. All laboratory personnel was blinded as 
was all the other study personnel, including the ultrasonic assessor. Only the patients and study 
nurse were not blinded. The assessment of the local and systematic adverse events was not 
performed by the unblinded study nurse, but by the blinded investigator. The patients had to record 
their symptoms in a patient diary. The blinded investigator had to make the assessment based on 
the symptoms recorded by the patient.  
Statistical methods 
Statistical approach for the primary endpoint (number of oocytes retrieved) 
Equivalence  of  means  within  the  set  difference  was  analysed  using  Schuirmann’s  TOST  (two 
one-sided tests, p=0.025) test. The mean number of  oocytes retrieved was a random  variable, 
which is asymptomatically normally distributed, but in case of a lot of poor responders (i.e. greater

than 30%) a Mann-Whitney TOST test and Bootstrap-T for non-normal data will be performed. The 
95% interval for the mean number of number of oocytes in each treatment group was computed. 
Rationale equivalence margin 
A difference of less than 3 retrieved oocytes between the two treatments was considered to be 
clinically not meaningful.

categorical data were planned. Continuous secondary outcomes will be compared using Student’s 
t-test. In case of non-normality, t-test will be replaced by nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
Comparison between categorical secondary outcomes will be done using Chi² test. If expected cell 
frequency is lower than 5, Chi² test will be replaced by exact Fisher test. Time to event parameters 
will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank test. 
Sample size  
‘Number of oocytes retrieved’ was the primary endpoint on which the comparison was based in 
order to establish equivalence versus Gonal-f. The mean number of oocytes was taken from a 
pooled analysis of Frydman et al., 2000 (Hum Reprod), Bergh et al., 1997 (Hum Reprod) and Schats 
et al., 2000 (Hum Reprod). The number of oocytes of poor responders, i.e. number of retrieved 
oocytes <5, was set to zero. The clinical equivalence would be declared if the mean difference 
between number of oocytes retrieved was less than 3 with a SD of 7.06. To demonstrate the 
equivalence between the two treatment groups using two one-sided tests (TOST approach) with 
regards to the number of ooctyes retrieved with a power of 90%, an alpha error of 2.5% and a poor 
responder rate of 5%, a sample size of 351 patients with a 2:1 ratio (234/117) was calculated under 
the hypothesis (± 2.9 is the considered IC for the mean difference): 
H0:  <-2.9 or  >2.9 null hypothesis 
H1: -2.9≤≤2.9 alternative hypothesis 
The sample size was increased by 12% for dropouts and evaluated to 393 patients.

Participant flow  
A total of 502 patients were enrolled in the study at 16 centers in 6 countries. After screening 410 
patients were randomized: Austria (5 centers), Denmark (3 centers), Germany (2 centers), Spain 
(2 centers), Switzerland (1 center) and UK (3 centers). However, center 8200 in the UK has been 
excluded, because of GCP issues. When excluding center 8200, 372 patients were randomized. 
Two analysis populations were identified: 
- 
Full analysis set, which includes all patients who received at least one study drug dose 
according to protocol. 
- 
Per protocol set, i.e. all patients who completed the study according to the protocol. 
Recruitment 
The date of first enrolment was 1 July 2010; the date of the last study visit completed was 22 
November 2011. 
Conduct of the study  
The protocol was dated 9 March 2010 and required changes were included in amendment 01 of the 
protocol, dated 21 October 2010. The global amendment 01 addressed the following:  
- 
- 
administrative changes, 
clarifications of certain procedures (visit assessments, ultrasound parameters, laboratory 
parameters, clinical parameters), 
- 
concerns raised by the competent authorities and Ethics Committees during the review 
process (extension of exclusion criteria, safety reporting requirements, statistical analysis). 
Due to local regulatory requirements, local protocol amendments were made for Germany (21 July 
2010), Switzerland (23 September 2010), Denmark (21 December 2010) and UK (15 February 
2011).  
-  Germany: These amendments included the inclusion of additional exclusion criteria and 
reasons for discontinuation. 
-  Switzerland: the amendment was related to the text on treatment compliance. 
-  Denmark and United Kingdom: Utrogestan was replaced by the general term ‘progesterone 
treatment’ in the protocol.

Based on an audit performed by the sponsor at center 8200 (St. Bart’s and the London Trust) two 
patients were found who had been ineligible to enter the trial and additional queries had to be 
raised. As a result of these findings, the database was reopened and queries were resolved by the 
principle investigator. The corresponding correction of the database set was followed by a new 
database lock on 19 September 2012. 
Major protocol violations  
Major violations occurred in 32 patients (11.6%) in the Bemfola group and 10 patients (7.4%) in 
the Gonal-f group. See also Table 13 below. The highest percentages were due to “No documented 
oocytes assessment form” and “Termination date before date of punction”. 
Minor protocol violations  
Patients with minor protocol deviations were not excluded from the per-protocol population. An 
overview is lacking from these minor protocol violations. 
An overview of the minor protocol violations in study FIN3001 is provided in Table 10.

Baseline data  
No clinically relevant differences were observed in the antral follicle count (15.1 for Bemfola vs. 
15.3 for Gonal-f), mean age (31.8 years vs. 32.1 years), and mean body weight (62.5 kg for 
Bemfola vs. 62.7 kg for Gonal-f. Ethnic origin was Caucasian in the majority of the patients. The 
baseline characteristics on infertility were not part of the approved protocol, though the Applicant 
has made efforts to collect the data after study closure. Information could be collected from 56% 
patients in the Bemfola and Gonal-f arms. The baseline characteristics of these patients (137 
patients in the Bemfola group and 69 patients in the Gonal-f group) did not show clinically relevant 
differences between both groups. The duration of infertility was in both groups 3.1 years. The 
causes of infertility were male factor (45.3% for Bemfola vs. 50.7% for Gonal-f), idiopathic (34.3% 
for Bemfola vs. 33.3% for Gonal-f), tubal factor (12.4% for Bemfola vs. 4.3% for Gonal-f) and 
endometriosis (2.2% for Bemfola vs. 0% for Gonal-f). 
Numbers analysed  
All randomised patients received active drug and were included in the Safety Analysis Set (SAS) 
population. Two patients were randomised to Gonal-f, but received Bemfola. These patients were 
randomised in the Bemfola group.

Discontinuation 
The most common reasons for premature termination of treatment were: Failure to become 
pregnant and increased risk of severe OHSS (2.8% for Bemfola vs. 0.8% for Gonal-f).

Outcomes and estimation  
Primary efficacy analysis 
The mean (SD) number of oocytes retrieved in the PP group was 10.8 (5.11) for the Bemfola group 
and 10.6 (6.06) for the Gonal-f group. 
The estimated treatment difference was 0.27 oocytes in favour of Bemfola, while the 95% 
confidence interval was [-1.34; 1.32] for analysis for non-normal data. This indicates that the two 
treatment groups were equivalent based on the pre-defined equivalence range of (-2.9, +2.9) 
oocytes. Results for the FAS population were comparable (0.29, 95% CI -129; 1.34). 
The treatment effect was analysed in the PP population adjusting for age in years at randomization 
and FSH concentration at baseline. No treatment effect was demonstrated for the number of 
oocytes retrieved.

Secondary efficacy analysis 
 
The mean (median) total dose of r-FSH was 1555.7 (1512.5) IU in the Bemfola group and 
1569.2 (1500) IU in the Gonal-f group. 
 
The mean number of days of r-FSH stimulation was 10.6 for Bemfola and 10.7 for Gonal-f 
At least 70% of patients in both treatment groups had 10 days of treatment.  
 
The proportion of patients requiring dose reductions was higher in the Bemfola group 
(10.6%) than in the Gonal-f group (7.3%). 
 
The range of the time to dose reduction due to OHSS was in the Bemfola group (7.0 – 16.0 
days) and in the Gonal-f group (8.0 to 12.0 days). 
 
The mean (SD) number of follicles ≥ 12 mm on Stimulation Day 8 (Visit 5) was slightly 
higher for Bemfola 7.1 (5.11) compared to Gonal-f 6.5 (4.65). 
 
The mean (SD) number of follicles (≥ 12 mm, ≥ 15 mm and ≥ 17 mm) on the Day of hCG 
administration was slightly higher for Bemfola compared to Gonal-f in all three size 
categories. 
  Median estradiol levels on Stimulation Day 8 were 2818 pmol/L for Bemfola vs. 2870 pmol/L 
for Gonal-f. 
  Median estradiol levels on the Day of hCG administration (7090 pmol/L for Bemfola vs. 
6606 pmol/L for Gonal-f). 
 
Patients with cycle cancellations were 13 patients (5.3%) for Bemfola and 5 patients (4.1%) 
for Gonal-f. Cycle cancellations were mostly due to OHSS. 
 
The proportion of good responders was 91.4% for Bemfola and 89.4% for Gonal-f. The 
proportion of poor responders, defined as oocyte retrieval <5 oocytes, was 8.6% for 
Bemfola and 10.6% for Gonal-f. 
The ICSI method was more applied for the oocytes retrieved in the Gonal-f group (59.3% 
versus 55.31%) and the IVF method was more applied in the Bemfola group (44.7% versus 
40.7%). 
 
The profiles of cumulus oophorus maturity were similar for the three classifications (very 
mature, mature, immature). Also, the oocyte nuclear maturity was similar in all three 
classifications (G, M1 and M2) for both treatment groups. The highest count was observed 
for metaphase II oocytes, which are preferably used: 83.4% in the Bemfola group and 
83.3% in the Gonal-f group. 
  Quality of Embryos (Day 2 and Day 3) 
On Day 2 and Day 3 small differences were found in the Quality of the Embryos retrieved in 
“Blastomere uniformity” and “Degree of Fragmentation”.

EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 56/76 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The “Blastomere uniformity” had a higher percentage of equally sized blastomeres in the 
Gonal-f group compared to Bemfola: on Day 2 59.8% for Bemfola vs. 65.6% for Gonal-f, 
and on Day 3 53.2% for Bemfola vs. 64.8% for Gonal-f.  
Staessen et al. (Hum Reprod 1005;10:3305-12) reported a threshold of 20% 
fragmentation to demonstrate a difference in implantation rates. A small difference is 
observed in the percentage of embryos with “0-20% fragmentation”: on Day 2 83.0% for 
Bemfola and 88.3% for Gonal-f, and 73.3% for Bemfola and 87.4% for Gonal-f. 
It is however reassuring that the implantation rates are comparable between both 
treatment groups: for Bemfola 110/346 (31.8%) and for Gonal-f 66/180 (36.7%). 
  Quality of Embryos (Day 5) 
On Day 5 blastocysts were assessed in both groups on blastocoel cavity, inner cell mass (ICM) 
and trophectoderm. Only at the inner cell mass a small difference was observed between 
Bemfola and Gonal-f, which was in favour of Bemfola as more blastocysts were graded B in 
comparison to Gonal-f. Gardner et al. 2000 (Fertil Steril 73:1155-1158) has shown that an 
expanded blastocyst with a tightly packed highly cellular ICM has a higher implantation rate 
compared with a blastocyst with a scarce ICM with very few cells. 
 
 The fertilization rate of oocytes per patient was similar between the treatment groups 
(66.0% for Bemfola versus 66.79% for Gonal-f). 
 
The mean number of embryos transferred was comparable: 1.5 for Bemfola and 1.6 for 
Gonal-f. Also, the proportion of patents with 1, 2 or 3 embryos transferred was similar. 
 
The implantation rate in the Bemfola and Gonal-f treatment group on day 1 (31.8% vs. 
36.7%), 2 (28.3% vs. 26.7%), 3 (33.7% vs. 38.3%) and 5 (36.4% vs. 48.4%) were 
similar. 
Second treatment cycle 
The objective of the second treatment cycle was to assess the immunogenicity and safety of 
Bemfola. Patients who did not become pregnant after a completed first study cycle could undergo a 
second cycle of FSH treatment at least 4 weeks after termination of the first treatment cycle. 
Patients remained allocated to the study group arm Bemfola or Gonal-f, respectively. The design of 
the study was similar to the design of the first treatment cycle. 
Study center 8200 was also excluded from the analysis of the second treatment cycle. Out of the 
129 patients who gave informed consent, 19 patients were screening failures and 110 patients were 
included in cycle 2 of this study and treated with Bemfola (n=72) or Gonal-f (n=38). The reasons for 
screening failure differed, such as too high FSH level, failed downregulation, spontaneously 
pregnancy or withdrawal of the informed consent. The results of the second treatment cycle were 
analysed descriptively only, which is acceptable, as the primary aim was to assess immunogenicity 
and the number of patients included was small.

 
The mean total dose of r-hFSH was similar for both treatment groups (1612 IU for Bemfola 
and 1605 IU for Gonal-f), though higher than used in the Main study (1556 IU for Bemfola 
and 1569 for Gonal-f). 
Differences were noted between treatment cycles 1 and 2: 
 
The OHSS incidence were comparable for Bemfola and Gonal-f in treatment cycle 2, 
whereas in treatment cycle 1 the OHSS incidence were higher for Bemfola compared to 
Gonal-f. These differences could be due to the fact that patients who experienced OHSS 
in the first treatment cycle or did not complete the first treatment cycle were not 
included in the second treatment cycle. The patient population is therefore likely less 
sensitive to FSH compared to the patient population in the first treatment cycle. This is 
also apparent from the patients who had dose reductions; in treatment cycle 1 (10.6% 
for Bemfola vs. 7.3% for Gonal-f) this percentage was higher than in treatment cycle 2 
(4.2% for Bemfola vs. 5.3% for Gonal-f). 
 
The percentage of M2 mature oocytes was similar in treatment cycle 1 (83.4% for 
Bemfola vs. 83.3% for Gonal-f), whereas in treatment cycle 2 it was slightly lower in the 
Bemfola group (81.3% vs. 85.4% for Gonal-f). More patients received ICSI procedures 
in the Gonal-f group in treatment cycle 2, which may have resulted in a disbalance 
between both treatment groups in the percentage of M2 mature oocytes.

No differences were observed between the treatment groups in the secondary endpoints in the 
second treatment cycle, except for the clinical pregnancy rate per started IVF cycle, which was 
higher in the Bemfola group (34.7%) compared to the Gonal-f group (26.3%). However, it should 
be noted that the number of patients in the second treatment cycle was very small (72 in Bemfola 
vs. 38 in Gonal-f) compared to the first treatment cycle (246 in Bemfola vs. 123 in Gonal-f), and this 
difference could therefore be the result of chance. The results of the second treatment cycle are in 
support of biosimilarity. 
2.5.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy 
One pivotal Phase III study (FIN3001) was conducted in 410 patients to document the equivalent 
efficacy of Bemfola compared to Gonal-f in the stimulation of multifollicular development in patients 
undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART), which is acceptable, as it 
is in accordance with the ‘Draft guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar 
biological medicinal products containing recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-FSH, 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010)’. Due to GCP issues identified at the UK site 8200, it was decided 
to exclude the subjects from this site from all analyses. Without site 8200, 372 patients were 
randomized. 
The study was designed as a randomized, assessor-blind, multi-national, multi-center, controlled, 
parallel group equivalence trial involving centers in Europe. Gonal-f is appropriate as the reference 
product. The number of patients included is acceptable. Infertile women aged 20-38 years and 
having a BMI between 18-30 kg/m2 were included. The women needed to have a regular menstrual 
cycle length (25- 35 days and presumed to be ovulatory). Patients with a history of severe OHSS, 
or polycystic ovaries were excluded for safety reasons. The applied inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are adequate and in line with other ART studies. The design of the study had several flaws (e.g. 
dose adjustment was only possible in case of risk of imminent OHSS, in which imminent OHSS was 
not further specified in the study protocol) and infertility characteristics of the patient population 
were collected post-hoc. 
The primary endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ for establishing equivalence is in accordance 
with the draft guideline EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010. This endpoint is an adequate endpoint, as 
it is strongly influenced by the effect of FSH on the ovaries. 
The equivalence margin for the primary endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ was -2.9 and +2.9 
oocytes and is adequately justified, as 3 oocytes usually result in one good quality embryo for 
transfer or freezing. The equivalence margin for Bemfola [-2.9, +2.9] is tighter than has been used 
in the registered Elonva (modified r-hFSH with a longer half-life) equivalence trial comparing Elonva 
with r-hFSH (Puregon [-3, +5]). The sample size has a 90% power for rejecting the null hypothesis 
that Bemfola is different to Gonal-f with an equivalence margin of -2.9, +2.9, which is appropriate. 
The statistical approach for the primary analysis, using Schuirmann’s TOST in the PP population 
supported by the FAS population or, in case of a lot of poor responders, a Mann-Whitney TOST with 
bootstrap-T simulation for determining the 95% CI, is considered appropriate. The statistical 
analyses of secondary outcomes is also appropriate, using t-tests and chi2-tests, or in case of 
Assessment report

non-normality or expected cell frequencies below 5 respectively, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Fisher 
tests. 
No clinically relevant differences were observed in the baseline characteristics between both 
groups. Further to the GCP inspection, the applicant has submitted an updated Study Report of 
FIN3001 without centre 8200. After exclusion of centre 8200 also equivalence for the primary 
endpoint was achieved. Furthermore, exclusion of centre 8200 did not result in clinically relevant 
differences in the secondary endpoints compared to the analyses when study centre 8200 was 
included. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Therapeutic equivalence for the primary efficacy endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ has been 
established for Bemfola and the reference product Gonal-f. The secondary endpoints ‘total r-hFSH 
dose’, ‘number of days of r-hFSH stimulation’, ‘mean number of follicles on Stimulation Day 8 and 
Day of hCG administration’, ‘median estradiol levels on Stimulation Day 8’, and ‘number of 
patients with cycle cancellation’ were comparable between both treatment groups. 
Differences were noted in the first treatment cycle in the ‘proportion of patients requiring dose 
reductions due to risk of imminent OHSS’ and ‘median estradiol levels on the Day of hCG 
administration’. However, these differences are considered small, i.e. 3.3% difference between 
Bemfola and Gonal-f in proportion of patients with dose reductions. Further, the difference in 
median estradiol levels is also considered small considering the range in estradiol concentrations. 
Thus, the results of the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints are in accordance with the 
concept of biosimilarity (Article 10(4) of directive 2001/83/EC). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety data presented summarized adverse events for all subjects who were included in the 
Phase I trial and the active-controlled Phase III trial (FIN3001). As it concerns a biosimilar, the 
submission of two studies, from which one efficacy/safety study for a r-hFSH biosimilar is sufficient 
provided that Bemfola fulfils all requirements for a biosimilar, including quality and non-clinical 
requirements. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 273 subjects received at least one dose of Bemfola. A total of 24 healthy subjects were 
treated with a single dose in the Phase I trial (FIN1001). In the Phase III trial FIN3001, 249 patients 
were randomised to Bemfola. In the second treatment cycle 72 patients received Bemfola. Medical 
history was collected from 56% patients in the Bemfola and Gonal-f arms. No clinically relevant 
differences were present between both treatment groups. 
Adverse events 
In the first treatment cycle the incidence of possibly, probably or definitely drug-related 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was higher for the Bemfola treatment group (64.3%) 
compared to the Gonal-f treatment group (53.7%).

Drug-related TEAEs that were most frequently reported were injection site erythema (23.7% 
Bemfola vs. 28.5% Gonal-f), injection site haematoma (20.9% Bemfola vs. 10.6% Gonal-f), OHSS 
(22.1% Bemfola vs. 13.0% Gonal-f), and headache (20.9% Bemfola vs. 17.9% Gonal-f). 
Treatment differences in the incidence of individual events were reported for OHSS (9% more 
frequent in the Bemfola group) and injection site haematoma (10% more frequent in the Bemfola 
group). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in the completed studies. The frequency of SAEs was higher in the Bemfola 
group (11 patients, 4.4%) than in the Gonal-f group (3 patients, 2.4%). This difference is largely 
attributable to the higher incidence of OHSS in the Bemfola group compared to the Gonal-f group 
(2.8% vs. 1.6%).  
Validation of the antibody assay 
ADA (antidrug-antibodies) was measured using SPR (surface plasmon resonance). The method was 
thoroughly and properly validated using commercially available mAbs. Purified mAbs can be 
expected to be different qualitatively from polyclonal antibodies as a result of immunogenicity. 
Normally polyclonal antibody preparations (mostly from rabbit or rat immunisation) were also used 
as positive control. The FSH used as an antigen is the Bemfola FSH in both the Gonal-f and the 
Bemfola treated patients. The assay range was considered adequate. 
Immunogenicity testing in clinical trials 
No anti-FSH antibodies were detected in the phase III study in both treatment cycles nor in the 
Phase I study, which is in line with the statement in the draft Guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/BWMP/671292/2010) that immunogenicity of r-FSH is generally low and that 
neutralizing antibodies were not reported after administration of r-hFSH. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant effects were observed between the treatment groups in the completed Phase 
III study in biochemistry variables, haematology variables and urinalysis variables. 
Safety in special populations 
Not applicable. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with Bemfola. As Bemfola is a biosimilar, it 
is acceptable that no formal drug interaction studies have been performed.

Discontinuation due to AEs 
The frequencies of drug-related AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were not 
balanced between the two treatments: 10 patients (4.0%) in the Bemfola group and 1 (0.8%) in the 
Gonal-f group. This difference was mainly due to the higher incidence of OHSS (3.6% vs. 0.8%). All 
cases of OHSS were classified as moderate in severity, except for one case in the Bemfola group, 
which was classified as mild in severity. 
AE of special interest – Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
OHSS is an iatrogenic complication of controlled ovarian stimulation with potentially serious 
outcomes. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome, 
previous history of OHSS, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels (>11,000 pmol/l in 
ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (≥20 follicles of ≥12 mm in diameter in ART; 
Gonal-f SmPC). 
Two forms of OHSS have been described. 
1) 
The early-onset pattern (early OHSS) occurs within 9 days after oocyte retrieved after hCG 
administration and appears to be associated with an excessive ovarian response to 
gonadotropin stimulation. 
2) 
On the contrary, the late-onset pattern (late OHSS) occurs after the initial 10-day period, as 
a consequence of the endogenously produced hCG from an implanting pregnancy6,7,8. 
Methods to prevent OHSS 
To minimise the risk of OHSS, ultrasonographic assessments of follicular development and/or 
determination of serum estradiol level should be performed prior to ART treatment and at regular 
intervals during treatment, with the dose adjusted according to the patient’s response. 
Depending on the ovarian response, the following measurements can be used to prevent OHSS: 
1)  Coasting, i.e. withholding FSH administration at the end of ovarian stimulation before hCG 
administration, for a maximum of 3 days; 
2)  Delay triggering final oocyte maturation with hCG administration until estradiol levels 
stabilize or decrease; 
3)  Administer a lower hCG dose; 
4)  Withhold hCG and cancel the treatment cycle.

Measurements taken in the Phase III FIN3001 study 
The following exclusion criteria were included in the pivotal study to exclude patients at risk for 
OHSS, which is acceptable: 1) Antral follicle count (AFC) ≥ 10 to ≤ 25 follicles; 2) presence of 
polycystic ovaries; 3) previous history or presence of severe OHSS. 
The FSH dose in the FIN 3001 study was fixed during the entire treatment period and could only be 
decreased when there was a risk of imminent OHSS (definition not provided in the protocol, to be 
decided by the investigator). The FSH dose was not adjusted based on the individual patient’s 
ovarian response (as measured by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or 
ultrasound examination). This study design could have resulted in a higher overall incidence of 
OHSS. 
1)  Coasting: Coasting (withholding FSH treatment) was allowed for more than 1 day. Coasting 
between last FSH and hCG for 2 days or more was performed in 7 (2.8%) patients in the 
Bemfola group and 3 (2.4%) patients in the Gonal-f group. 
2)  Delay oocyte maturation: Final oocyte maturation could not be delayed. The administration 
of hCG had to be done the same evening or within 24 hours after the criteria for induction 
of ovulation had been met. 
3)  Reduce hCG dose: The investigator was not allowed to reduce the hCG dose if E2 levels 
raised concern. Nevertheless, one patient received 200 µg rather than 250 µg. 
4)  Withhold hCG and cancel treatment cycle: The protocol did not specify when to withhold 
hCG. For safety reasons, i.e. risk of OHSS, it would have been advisable to indicate in the 
protocol that no hCG should be given if the estradiol level was above a certain serum level 
and/or if there were more than a certain number of follicles in total.  
Classification of OHSS 
The OHSS cases were classified according to severity by the investigator (mild, moderate, severe). 
In addition, study discontinuation due to the adverse event OHSS was reported. Further, OHSS was 
additionally classified according to the recommendations of “The Practice Committee of the 
American Society for Reproductive Medicine”. 
First treatment cycle 
OHSS was reported in the first treatment cycle in 55 patients (22.1%) in the Bemfola group and 
with a lower frequency in the Gonal-f group (16 patients (13.0%). This is due to an imbalance 
between study arms in the first treatment cycle in the incidence of mild and moderate OHSS, and 
OHSS leading to study discontinuation: mild OHSS 12.4% vs. 8.1%, moderate OHSS 8.8% vs. 
2.4%, OHSS leading to study discontinuation 3.6% vs. 0.8%.  
There was a discrepancy between the patients with threatened OHSS (40 for Bemfola vs. 14 for 
Gonal-f) and the patients with dose reductions (38 for Bemfola vs. 16 for Gonal-f), because there 
were 9 patients in the Bemfola group and 2 patients in the Gonal-f group who did not receive a dose 
reduction according to protocol despite the fact that they experienced threatened OHSS. On the 
other hand, there were 7 patients in the Bemfola group and 4 patients in the Gonal-f group who 
received a dose reduction although they did not experience a threatened OHSS.

Also differences were noted in: 
  Average day of onset of dose reduction in patients with dose reductions was later (8.8 days) 
in the Bemfola group vs. 6.8 days in the Gonal-f group. 
  Average duration of dose reduction in patients with dose reductions was 2.7 days in the 
Bemfola group vs. 4.1 days in the Gonal-f group.

In the study protocol of the FIN3001 study no definition had been provided ‘a priori’ from 
“threatened OHSS” and “real OHSS”. Moreover, the difference between “threatened OHSS” and 
“real OHSS” has not been used previously in registration studies for ART, nor are these terms used 
in public literature. It could therefore easily be that OHSS cases have been misclassified by the 
investigators – i.e. “threatened OHSS” should be “real OHSS” or the other way around, which was 
also indicated by the Applicant in their response. Therefore, both groups were combined, and 
looked at the adverse event classified as OHSS as a whole without making a subsequent distinction 
in “real” and “threatened”.  
The OHSS incidence in both treatment arms reported in the first treatment cycle in the pivotal 
phase III study FIN3001 is much higher than the incidence that is reported in the SmPC of Gonal-f 
(mild or moderate OHSS classified as common, i.e. between 1% and below 10%; severe OHSS 
classified as uncommon, i.e. 0.1% and below 1%), and for the other r-FSH formulation Puregon 
(approximately 4% overall OHSS incidence). This could be due to the study design of FIN3001, 
which did not allow dose decrease based on the individual response unless there was a risk of 
imminent OHSS (no definition provided, to be decided by the investigator). Further, the fact that 
the adverse event OHSS also includes “threatened OHSS”, which is according to the Applicant the 
expectation of the investigator that OHSS can develop, but not yet OHSS, could have led to the 
higher incidence rates of OHSS observed in both treatment groups in study FIN3001 when 
compared to other registration studies, e.g. for Elonva or Ovaleap. 
The Applicant provided a possible explanation for the difference in OHSS incidence between both 
arms. The Applicant explained that the Phase III trial was not powered to detect differences in 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1

OHSS, which was agreed with. Further, the Applicant discussed several differences between both 
treatment groups that could have led to the difference in OHSS between both treatment groups. 
These are: 
1. Imbalance in AMH level of ≥24 pmol/L  
2. Inconsistent reporting of mild/moderate OHSS incidence  
3. Inaccurate reporting of real OHSS 
4. Imbalance in dose reductions 
In the Phase III trial the primary endpoint was equivalent compared to Gonal-f, and no differences 
were present in the other secondary endpoints that could explain this higher OHSS incidence. The 
higher proportion of AMH levels ≥ 24 pmol/L in the baseline characteristics of the Bemfola group 
could have contributed to this higher OHSS incidence in the Bemfola group. However, as the 
difference in proportion of patients with an AMH level of ≥24 pmol/L between Bemfola and Gonal-f 
is only 4.4%, the imbalance cannot completely explain the difference of 22.1% for Bemfola vs. 
13.0% for Gonal-f in OHSS incidence. Further, dissimilarities in dose reduction were observed 
between the Bemfola and Gonal-f arms, which also could have resulted in a higher incidence of 
OHSS for Bemfola. 
Second treatment cycle 
Patients who experienced OHSS in the first treatment cycle or did not complete the first treatment 
cycle were not included in the second treatment cycle. The patient population is therefore likely less 
sensitive to FSH compared to the patient population in the first treatment cycle. This is in 
correspondence with the lower OHSS incidences observed in the second treatment cycle compared 
to the first treatment cycle: i.e. Bemfola and Gonal-f, 6.9% and 5.3%, respectively.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The OHSS incidence in both treatment arms reported in the first treatment cycle in the pivotal 
phase III study FIN3001 is higher than the incidence reported in the SmPC of Gonal-f (mild or 
moderate OHSS classified as common i.e. between 1% and below 10%; severe OHSS classified as 
uncommon i.e. 0.1% and below 1%) and for the other r-FSH formulation Puregon (4% overall 
OHSS incidence). These higher incidences might be due to the strict fixed dose regimen, in which 
dose reduction was only possible in case of risk of imminent OHSS. Further, the fact that the 
adverse event OHSS also includes “threatened OHSS”, which is according to the Applicant the 
expectation of the investigator that OHSS can develop, but not yet OHSS, could have also 
contributed to the higher incidence of OHSS in FIN3001.  
A higher incidence of OHSS was noted for Bemfola: Bemfola (22.1%) vs. Gonal-f (13.0%). Also, 
the discontinuation due to OHSS was higher in the Bemfola group versus the Gonal-f group, 9 
(3.6%) vs. 1 (0.8%). The Applicant was requested to discuss these differences between treatment 
arms. The higher proportion of AMH levels ≥ 24 pmol/L in the baseline characteristics of the 
Bemfola group could have contributed to this higher OHSS incidence in the Bemfola group. Further, 
dissimilarities in dose reduction were observed between the Bemfola and Gonal-f arms, which also 
Assessment report  
EMA/65507/2013 rev. 1 
Page 65/76 
 
  
  
 
 
 
could have resulted in a higher incidence of OHSS for Bemfola. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
OHSS incidence, withdrawal due to OHSS, and proportion of patients requiring dose reductions due 
to risk of imminent OHSS were ample explain by the applicant. In their response, the Applicant has 
adequately discussed the observed differences in the Phase I and Phase III trial. The small 
differences in FSH and estradiol concentrations are in accordance with the concept of biosimilarity 
considering the wide range in FSH and estradiol concentrations, and the pulsatile release of 
endogenous FSH. To explain the difference in OHSS incidence, the Applicant evaluated several 
parameters. The higher proportion of AMH levels ≥  24 pmol/L in the baseline characteristics of the 
Bemfola group could have contributed to this higher OHSS incidence in the Bemfola arm. Further, 
dissimilarities in dose reduction were observed between the Bemfola and Gonal-f arms, which also 
could have resulted in a higher incidence of OHSS for Bemfola. 
Overall, the AE profile of Bemfola is comparable with Gonal-f.

Bemfola (also referred to as Bemfola) contains the active substance follitropin alfa. Follitropin alfa 
is a recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) that is produced in Chinese Hamster 
Ovary Cells (CHO DHFR-) by recombinant DNA technology. 
This application is a centralised procedure made according to Article 10(4), Directive 2001/83/EC, 
biosimilar application. Bemfola has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product 
(biosimilar) with Gonal-f as the reference product. 
The claimed indications are similar to the indications of Gonal-f: 
“In adult women 
-  Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been 
unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. 
-  Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian 
transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). 
-  Bemfola in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the 
stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical 
trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. 
In adult men 
-  Bemfola is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or 
acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) therapy.” 
The dose recommendations are also identical to those of Gonal-f. 
Bemfola is provided in 5 different single-use pre-filled pens of 75 IU, 150 IU, 225 IU, 300 IU and 450 
IU. In contrast, for Gonal-f 3 pre-filled multidose preparations are available of 300 IU, 450 IU and 
900 IU. 
Beneficial effects 
Quality 
In the analytical comparability exercises no qualitative differences in rh-FSH were observed 
between Bemfola and Gonal-f and evidence for a similar quality profile was obtained. However, as 
can be expected for complex molecules, some minor differences were observed in glycosylation 
between Bemfola and Gonal-f, and the percentage of truncated alpha chain between Bemfola 
batches. These differences are only small, and can be expected for products derived from a 
biological production process.

Non-clinical 
Non-clinical studies showed similar activity of Bemfola and Gonal-f in a functional cell assay in which 
the human FSH receptor was expressed. Both products also showed similar potency in rat bioassay 
were increase in ovary weight was assessed (Steelman-Pohley assay). 
Clinical pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic properties of Bemfola and Gonal- were determined in a single dose cross-over 
study FIN1001. Based on study FIN1001 bioequivalence may be concluded. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
One pivotal Phase III study (FIN3001) was conducted in 410 patients to document the efficacy of 
Bemfola in the stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for 
assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Due to GCP issues at center 8200, this site was excluded. 
With the exclusion of site 8200, 372 patients were randomized. Treatment ratio was 2:1. 
Performing a study for the ART indication is appropriate, as it is the most sensitive indication with 
regard to detection of product-specific differences. The study was designed as a randomized, 
multi-national, parallel group trial. The study had an assessor-blind design. Due to the different 
visual appearance of the two pens (Gonal-f pen and Bemfola pen), a double-blind design was not 
feasible. All laboratory personnel and other study personnel, including the ultrasonic assessor, were 
blinded. Only the patients and study nurse were not blinded. The reference product was the 
registered r-hFSH Gonal-f, which is appropriate. The dose of 150 IU r-hFSH was fixed throughout 
treatment, and could only be lowered in case of risk of imminent OHSS. Six European countries 
participated. The women included were aged 20-38 years, with a BMI between 18-30 kg/m2 and 
having a regular menstrual cycle length (25- 35 days).  
The results for the primary efficacy endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ were 10.9 in the Bemfola 
group compared to 10.6 oocytes retrieved in the Gonal-f group. Equivalence was shown by the 
Mann-Whitney U test. The 95% confidence intervals for the difference between Bemfola and Gonal-f 
(0.52, 95% CI -1.34, +1.32) were well within the pre-defined equivalence margin of [-2.9, +2.9] 
that is adequately justified. 
The following key secondary endpoints were considered comparable: 
  Median total dose of r-hFSH (15132 IU for Bemfola vs. 1500 for Gonal-f) 
  Number of days of r-hFSH stimulation (10.6 for Bemfola vs. 10.7 for Gonal-f) 
  Median estradiol levels on Stimulation Day 8 (2818 pmol/L for Bemfola vs. 2870 pmol/L for 
Gonal-f) 
  Mean number of follicles on Stimulation Day 8 ≥ 12 mm for Bemfola (7.1) and Gonal-f (6.5) 
  Mean number of follicles on the Day of hCG administration for Bemfola vs. Gonal-f in all 
three size categories was: ≥ 12 mm (11.8 vs. 11.1), ≥ 15 mm (8.3 vs. 7.7) and ≥ 17 mm 
(4.9 vs. 4.5) 
  Number of patients with cycle cancellation was 13 patients (5.3%) for Bemfola and 5 
patients (4.1%) for Gonal-f. Cycle cancellations were mostly due to OHSS

The percentages of women with ≥ 12 mm, ≥ 15 mm and ≥ 17 mm with 0 follicles, 1 to 5

administration. 
• 
Pregnancy follow-up. Birth weight was similar between treatment groups. Also the adverse 
events in the group ‘Congenital, familial and genetic disorders’ were similar in both arms. 
In the other key secondary endpoints slight differences were noted: 
 
Proportion of patients requiring dose reductions due to risk of imminent OHSS was higher in 
the Bemfola group (10.6%) than in the Gonal-f group (7.3%) 
  Median estradiol levels were higher on the Day of hCG administration for Bemfola (7090 
pmol/L; range 107.9 to 39669.0 pmol/L) compared to Gonal-f (6606 pmol/L; range 566.6 
to 29855.5 pmol/L). 
  Ongoing pregnancy rate per randomized patient was 34.1% (84/246) for Bemfola vs. 
41.4% (51/123) for Gonal-f.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Usability 
Dose increase is inconvenient compared to the reference product. For instance, when a woman uses 
the 150 IU pen and she needs to increase the dose, she will need to use a different pen, i.e. 225 IU, 
300 IU or 450 IU. In contrast, with the 900 IU/1.5 ml Gonal-f pen this is not necessary, as multiple 
different doses can be administered with the same pen within 28 days after opening. Consequently, 
with the single-use system more unused medicinal product will be discarded.  
Clinical pharmacokinetics 
The relative pharmacokinetic properties of Bemfola and Gonal-f were determined in a single dose 
cross-over bioequivalence study (study FIN1001). In the original documentation only the method 
validation report and the analytical results were provided, not a full analytical report. In the 
responses to the D180 CHMP LoOI, the applicant submitted the requested analytical report in which 
the most relevant details on the methodology and the study results were presented. In this regards, 
the applicant was asked to provide the KIMCL proficiency testing data that were obtained for the 
intra-laboratory test program in 2009 and to compare these data with the results of study FIN1001. 
The submitted KIMCL Proficiency Testing Data and the results of routine intra-laboratory test 
program show that it can be concluded that the accuracy of the analytical method used in Study 
FIN1001 is appropriate. Therefore the analytical method used in study FIN1001 is considered 
acceptable. 
Routine GCP inspection 
The Applicant has filed two GCP serious breach reports to the MHRA about one of the UK sites (8200) 
in the FIN3001 study. The MHRA was notified on 31 October 2012. Protocol violations that were 
identified were inclusion of non-eligible patients, and the blind of the ultrasound scans was 
potentially compromised. Site 8200 included 42 patients. Based on these findings, the Applicant 
indicated that there is a potential impact to scientific value/data credibility.

A routine GCP inspection was agreed on by the EMA, investigating three sites, including Site 8200. 
As a result of the GCP inspection of site 8200, the applicant was requested to provide a re-analysis 
of the Efficacy and Safety data of the Phase III study without the inclusion of site 8200 data (of 42 
patients). The applicant submitted these data together with the responses to the D120 LoQ. 
A GMP certificate for Vela Labs has been provided. 
Dosing 
The FSH dose in the pivotal clinical study has not been adjusted based on the patient’s ovarian 
response (as measured by monitoring of serum oestrogen concentrations and/or ultrasound 
examination) by increasing or decreasing the dose, which is not in line with clinical practice in 
Europe and the rest of the world, and is not in accordance with the draft guideline 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/671292/2010, and the draft European Scientific Advice (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/ 
593346/2008). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In the first treatment cycle the incidence of possibly, probably or definitely drug-related 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was higher for the Bemfola treatment group (64.3%) 
compared to the Gonal-f treatment group (53.7%). Drug-related TEAEs that were most frequently 
reported were injection site erythema (23.7% Bemfola vs. 28.5% Gonal-f), injection site 
haematoma (20.9 Bemfola vs. 10.6% Gonal-f), OHSS (22.1% Bemfola vs. 13.0% Gonal-f), and 
headache (20.9% Bemfola vs. 17.9% Gonal-f). 
No deaths were reported. SAEs were reported in 11 (4.4%) patients in the Bemfola group and 3 
(2.4%) in the Gonal-f group. 
OHSS 
Both the patient and study nurse were aware of the treatment. The assessment of the local and 
systematic adverse events was not performed by the unblinded study nurse, but by the blinded 
investigator. The patients had to record their symptoms in a patient diary. The blinded investigator 
had to make the assessment based on the symptoms recorded by the patient. OHSS was classified 
by the investigator in mild, moderate and severe, which is acceptable. In addition, study 
discontinuation due to the adverse event OHSS was reported. 
In the first treatment cycle, OHSS was reported in 55 patients (22.1%) in the Bemfola group, and 
with a lower frequency in the Gonal-f group (16 patients; 13.0%). This is due to an imbalance 
between study arms in the first treatment cycle in the percentage of mild and moderate OHSS, and 
OHSS leading to study discontinuation: mild OHSS 12.4% vs. 8.1%, moderate OHSS 8.8% vs. 
2.4%, OHSS leading to study discontinuation 3.6% vs. 0.8%. No differences were noted in 
percentage of patients with severe OHSS (0.8% in each group). 
In the second treatment cycle, the incidence of OHSS was comparable for Bemfola and Gonal-f, 
6.9% and 5.3%, respectively, but lower than in the first treatment cycle. As patients who 
experienced OHSS in the first treatment cycle or did not complete the first treatment cycle were not 
included in the second treatment cycle, the patient population was therefore less sensitive to FSH 
compared to the patient population in the first treatment cycle.

Immunology 
The ADA (anti-drug antibody) assay was thoroughly and properly validated. No anti-FSH antibodies 
were detected in the confirmatory assay in the main phase III study in both treatment cycles and 
phase I study. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
OHSS 
The patient needed to report local and systemic adverse events. The blinded investigator had to 
make the assessment based on the symptoms recorded by the patient in the Patient Diary. It is 
agreed that the diagnosis between mild or moderate OHSS is heavily influenced by the Patient Diary 
assessment done by the patient. As the patient was aware whether they received Gonal-f or 
Bemfola it cannot be excluded that this has impacted their reporting of symptoms, especially the 
mild OHSS. However, it remains unknown whether the unblinding of the patient impacted the 
reporting of OHSS, and if so, what the impact has been. 
The Applicant discussed the possible role of the strict dosing regimen on the overall higher incidence 
of OHSS found in the study. In the protocol of the Phase III study the following was indicated: “Only 
dose reduction allowed in case of imminent OHSS.” This may have led to too late dose adaptations, 
and an overall high OHSS incidence in the Phase III study. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Quality 
In the analytical comparability exercises sufficient evidence for a highly similar quality profile for 
Bemfola and Gonal-f was obtained. Bemfola is not claimed to be fully identical to Gonal-f and, as can 
be expected for complex molecules manufactured by two processes, some minor differences were 
observed with regard to the glycosylation profile:  
- the ratio of tetra-antennary to di-antennary structures is for BEMFOLA slightly higher compared to 
Gonal-f. 
- for the most complex glycosylation site 3 (beta subunit), slight differences in distribution of 
fucosyl residues in relation to antennarity were observed between Bemfola and Gonal-f. 
- a small amount of the sialic acid residues  of the alpha –subunit of Gonal-f samples contain an 
O-acetyl group, whereas the level in Bemfola was below detection. 
These minor differences are in line with the similarity principle. A major impact on the efficacy and 
safety profile is not expected. In summary, it is concluded that Bemfola and Gonal-f show a highly 
similar physico-chemical and biological quality profile. 
Non-Clinical 
The non-clinical data support the view that the active substance of Bemfola is the same or highly 
similar compared to the active substance of Gonal-f.

Clinical pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic properties of of Bemfola and Gonal- were determined in a single dose 
cross-over study FIN1001. Based on study FIN1001 bioequivalence may be concluded. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Therapeutic equivalence for the primary efficacy endpoint ‘number of oocytes retrieved’ has been 
established between Bemfola and the reference product Gonal-f in the pivotal study FIN3001. 
Several secondary endpoints were taken into account that investigated possible differences 
between the Bemfola and the reference product Gonal-f. The secondary endpoints ‘total r-hFSH 
dose’, ‘number of days of r-hFSH stimulation’, ‘mean number of follicles on Stimulation Day 8 and 
Day of hCG administration’,  ‘number of patients with cycle cancellation’ and ‘ ongoing pregnancy 
rate’ were comparable between both treatment groups. However, slight differences were seen 
between the following secondary endpoints between Bemfola and the reference product Gonal-f: E2 
levels (both Phase I and Phase III, FSH levels in Phase III, OHSS incidence, withdrawal due to OHSS, 
and proportion of patients requiring dose reductions due to risk of imminent OHSS. The Applicant 
was therefore asked to discuss these differences. 
In their response, the Applicant has adequately discussed the observed differences in the Phase I 
and Phase III trial. The small differences in FSH and estradiol concentrations are in accordance with 
the concept of biosimilarity considering the wide range in FSH and estradiol concentrations, and the 
pulsatile release of endogenous FSH. To explain the difference in OHSS incidence, the Applicant 
evaluated several parameters. The higher proportion of AMH levels ≥ 24 pmol/L in the baseline 
characteristics of the Bemfola group could have contributed to this higher OHSS incidence in the 
Bemfola arm. Further, dissimilarities in dose reduction were observed between the Bemfola and 
Gonal-f arms, which also could have resulted in a higher incidence of OHSS for Bemfola. 
Benefit-risk balance 
A similar quality profile was obtained for Bemfola and Gonal-f. In addition, non-clinical data and 
clinical pharmacokinetics are in support of biosimilarity with Gonal-f. In the Phase III study 
equivalence was obtained for the primary endpoint, and for the secondary endpoints only a higher 
OHSS incidence was observed to which the imbalance in AMH levels and dissimilarities in dose 
reductions could have contributed. Taken all data into account, including the quality and 
non-clinical package, Bemfola can be considered biosimilar to Gonal-f. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  CHMP  requested  a  routine  GCP  inspection  of  the  one  pivotal  study  FIN3001.  Based  on  the 
reporting inspector there have been persistent departures from GCP and the protocol at site 8200, 
having impact on the majority of aspects of the conduct of the trial. For that reason, the Applicant 
submitted a revised analysis of the Phase III trial excluding center 8200 and the data presented in 
this overview AR exclude this center.

3.1.1.1.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus/majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of Bemfola in the following indications: 
In adult women 
• 
Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been 
unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.   
• 
Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for 
assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian 
transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT).   
• 
Bemfola in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for 
the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical 
trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level <1.2 IU/l.   
In adult men 
• 
Bemfola is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or 
acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin 
(hCG) therapy.  
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the  marketing authorisation subject to 
the following conditions: 


2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common disease that accounts for 5% 
of deaths globally [World Health Organisation (WHO) 2012]. As a leading cause of morbidity 
and  mortality  worldwide,  COPD  produces  a  substantial,  and  growing,  economic  and  social 
burden.  COPD  is  characterised  by  persistent,  usually  progressive,  airflow  limitation 
associated with an enhanced inflammatory response in the airways and the lung. The goals 
of pharmacologic therapy in COPD are the reduction in symptoms and in the frequency and 
severity  of  exacerbations,  and  the  improvement  of  health  status  and  exercise  tolerance. 
Bronchodilators, such as a long acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) and long-acting beta2 
agonist  beta2-agonists  (LABA),  are  central  for  improving  lung  function  and  managing 
symptoms in COPD. In patients not adequately controlled with bronchodilators, the addition 
of  a  ICS  (Inhaled  corticosteroid)  usually  leads  to  reductions  in  the  frequency  of 
exacerbations, improves symptoms and quality of life and produces small improvements in 
lung function [GOLD, 2013].  
About the product 
The application concerns Incruse, Inhalation powder, pre-dispensed. The active ingredient is 
umeclidinium  bromide,  a  novel  long  acting  muscarinic  antagonist  (LAMA)  that  exerts 
bronchodilatory  activity  by  competitively  inhibiting  the  binding  of  acetylcholine  with 
muscarinic cholinergic receptors on airway smooth muscle. 
Incruse  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  COPD.  The  recommended  posology  is  one 
inhalation of Incruse 55 micrograms delivered dose once daily.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Marketing Authorisation Application is submitted in accordance to article Article 3(2)(a) 
of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004) (New active substance).  
Umeclidinium  bromide  has  been  evaluated  in  a  clinical  development  programme  for  the 
maintenance  treatment  of  patients  with  COPD  as  a  monotherapy  (Incruse)  and  as 
umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol combination product (Anoro). This dossier only pertains to 
the  development  as  monotherapy.  Two  relevant doses  were tested in  phase  III  (62.5  mcg 
and 125 mcg). The applicant states that the development program complied with regulatory 
guidelines.  Advice  on  the  development  program  was  sought  from  regulatory  authorities  in 
the  United  States  (US),  European  Union  (EU),  Japan  and  Canada.  Though  the  advice 
received  at  the  agency  meetings  was  specific  to  UMEC/VI  and  positioning  of  the 
combination  product,  the  program  as  designed  included  both  the  combination  and 
monotherapy  arms  and  some  of  the  advice  is  equally  applicable  for  UMEC  monotherapy. 
The resultant Phase  III  clinical development program was consistent with guidance for the 
development of medicinal products for the treatment of patients with COPD in place at the 
time. 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  dossier  referred  to  Incruse 
62.5  μg  as  the  finished  medicinal  product,  which  corresponds  to  the  metered  dose  of  the 
active substance. This was the basis used during the assessment of this application.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 10/144 
 
  
  
However in accordance with the “Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
and  QRD  Recommendations  on  the  expression  of  strength  in  the  name  of  Centrally 
Authorised Human Medicinal Products” (as stated in Section 1 of the SmPC and in the name 
section  of  the  Labelling  and  Package  Leaflet),  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  strength  should 
refer to the delivered dose of the active substance and therefore the name of the medicinal 
product finally approved by the Committee was expressed as follows: 
Incruse 55 micrograms, in all official approved documents (CHMP opinion/future EC decision 
and CHMP assessment report). Since 62.5 μg (metered dose) were the strengths referred to 
throughout the non-clinical and clinical development of this medicinal product and the data 
submitted in the application, this has been left unchanged in the sections of this assessment 
report relating to the non-clinical and clinical development. 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) obtained scientific advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products 
for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  for  UMEC/VI.  CHMP  agreed  that  the  dose  ranging  studies  were 
appropriately designed to support dose selection. CHMP agreed that the proposed Phase III 
clinical development program was sufficient to support the development of both the UMEC 
combination  and  monotherapy  products.  CHMP  endorsed  the  inclusion  of  a  broad  patient 
population and agreed with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) as a lung function 
measure  while  emphasizing  the  importance  of  measuring  symptomatic  benefit.  Following 
CHMP advice, a  symptomatic endpoint (Transition Dyspnea Index [TDI],  which is accepted 
by CHMP) was specified as the key secondary endpoint for the analysis of the results of the 
placebo-controlled studies for the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product contains umeclidinium bromide as the active substance, the active moiety 
being  umeclidinium.    It  is  a  pre-dispensed  inhalation  powder  which  is  presented  in  a  plastic 
inhaler. The inhaler contains a multi-dose blister strip, having either 7 or 30 doses. Each blister 
contains a pre-dispensed dose of 62.5 micrograms of umeclidinium (as bromide). 
When actuated, the inhaler delivers the contents of a single blister of the blister strip. Each 
actuation  provides  a  delivered  dose  of  55  micrograms  of  umeclidinium  (as  bromide).  The 
inhaler is packaged in a sealed tray with a desiccant. 
Other ingredients are lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Incruse contains umeclidinium bromide a novel long acting muscarinic antagonist. 
Umeclidinium bromide 
The chemical name of umeclidinium bromide (INN) is 1-[2-(Benzyloxy)ethyl]-4-
(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bromide and has the following 
structure:

OH
Umeclidinium  bromide  (INN)  is  a  white  crystalline,  non-hygroscopic  powder  that  is 
practically  insoluble  in  water  and  heptane,  very  slightly  soluble  in  toluene  and  t-methyl 
butyl ether, slightly soluble in acetonitrile, ethanol and 2-propanol, soluble in methanol and 
freely soluble in dichloromethane and dimethyl sulfoxide. 
The  molecular  structure  has  been  fully  characterised  by  elemental  analysis,  proton  and 
carbon  NMR,  MS,  IR,  X-ray  crystallography.  Umeclidinium  bromide  has  a  non-chiral 
molecular  structure.  Polymorphism  has  been  observed  but  the  synthesis  process 
consistently yields one polymorphic form. 
Manufacture 
Non-micronised  active  substance  is  supplied  by  one  manufacturer.  The  starting  materials 
and reagents are well defined and with acceptable specifications.  
Umeclidinium  bromide  was  developed  using  a  ‘quality  by  design’  (QbD)  approach  which 
involved the identification of potential critical process parameters (CPPs) that might have an 
impact on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the drug substance. Ranges were set for 
those  process  parameters  that  were  found  to  be  critical.  The  available  development  data, 
the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully 
support the proposed ranges. 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the 
EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances.  
Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well  discussed  with  regards  to  their  origin  and 
characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  description  (visual),  identity  and  solid 
state form (IR), umeclidinium bromide content by HPLC), related impurities (HPLC), residual 
solvent  (GC),  water  content  (Karl  Fischer  titration),  residue  on  ignition  and  particle  size 
distribution  (laser  diffraction).  The  absence  of  a  microbial  limit  test  and  heavy  metals  has 
been satisfactorily justified. 
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  results  for  assay,  related  impurities,  residual  solvents, 
water content and residue on ignition tests are not affected by micronisation. Therefore, it 
was  found  acceptable  to  perform  these  tests  on  the  non-micronised  drug  substance.  The 
limits  for  impurities  have  been  qualified  for  the  inhalation  route  in  safety  assessment 
studies.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Batch  analyses  data  on  eight  production  scale  batches  of  micronised  active  substance  and 
three batches of the non-micronised active substance have been provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  commercial  batches  of  micronised  active  substance  from  the 
proposed  manufacturer  stored  in  the  intended  commercial  package  for  18  months  under 
intermediate  conditions  at  30  ºC  /  65%  RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH  were submitted. Additionally, stability data for one batch of 
the non-micronised active substance under intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 65% RH and 
for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines were provided. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  content,  drug-related  impurities,  water 
content,  particle  size  distribution  (for  micronised  umeclidinium  bromide)  and  solid  state 
form by XRPD (for micronised umeclidinium bromide). The analytical tests used are stability 
indicating. 
Photostability  testing  following  the  ICH  guideline  Q1B  was  also  performed.  Stress  testing 
was  performed  on  one  batch  of  micronised  and  on  one  batch  of  non-micronised 
umeclidinium  bromide  under  50°C/ambient  humidity  for  3  months,  freeze/thaw  conditions 
of -20°C and 30°C under 7 day cycles and under 40°C/75% RH for 3 months with storage 
in a low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag, maintained in an upright orientation.  
Forced  degradation  studies  were  also  conducted  in the  solid  state  (14  days  at  80ºC  under 
ambient and 75% relative humidity), and under exposure to UV/visible light; and in solution 
at  80 ºC  and  under  acidic,  basic  and  oxidative  conditions,  in  order  to  identify  potential 
degradation pathways. 
All stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier 
is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed 
container and proposed storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The  goal  was  to  develop  a  dry  powder  inhaler  that  would  deliver  a  long  acting  muscarinic 
antagonist  (umeclidinium  bromide)  via  the  orally  inhaled  route  of  administration  to  the 
lungs,  with  acceptable  chemical  and  physical  stability.  Umeclidinium  bromide  exhibits 
appropriate  functional  characteristics,  is  chemically and  physically  stable  and  is,  therefore, 
suitable  for  formulation  as  a  dry  powder  inhaler  for  oral  inhalation.  It  was  also  found  to 
exhibit no undesirable taste.  The inhaler, a novel dry powder inhaler capable of delivering 
pre-metered  doses  form  the  blister  strip,  has  been  designed  to  provide  up  to  thirty  days 
therapy and it incorporates a counter which shows the number of doses remaining.  
A quality by design (QbD) approach was adopted for product development.

The excipients used in Incruse are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality 
is compliant with Ph. Eur  standards and additional in-house standards. There  are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The excipients are magnesium stearate 
and lactose monohydrate.  
A  novel  inhalation  device  containing  a  blister  strips  has  been  developed  to  allow  optimal 
inhalation of the active substance. Appropriate studies have been conducted in accordance 
with the EU ‘Guideline on the pharmaceutical quality of inhalation and nasal drug products’ 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005  Corr)  demonstrating  the  performance  of  the  device.  The 
blister strips are made of a formed silver coloured base foil laminate, sealed with a peelable 
lid  foil  laminate.  Confirmation  that  the  packaging  materials  comply  with  the  current  EU 
requirements has been provided. 
The inhaler has a light grey body and a light green mouthpiece cover and a dose counter. It 
is packed in a foil tray which also contains a desiccant. Adequate information on the design 
and composition of the inhaler has been included in the product information. 
Adventitious agents 
Lactose monohydrate is of animal origin and magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. 
It  is  confirmed  that  the  lactose  is  produced  from  milk  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same 
condition  as  those  used  to  collect  milk  for  human  consumption  and  that  the  lactose  has 
been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the

Manufacture of the product 
Incruse is manufactured by a manufacturing process that involves the following operations: 
umeclidinium blending, filling of the strip, and assembly of the inhaler and packing.   
A ‘quality by design’ (QbD) approach was adopted for product development.  
The data collected as part of process qualification indicate that the manufacturing process is 
robust  and  will  consistently  yield  a  product  of  acceptable  quality.    The  process  has  been 
validated  for  twenty-six  production-scale  batches  of  inhalers  manufactured  at  the  applied 
site.  The  data  collected  indicate  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  robust  and  will 
consistently  yield  a  product  of  intended  quality.  The  manufacturing  process  is  adequately 
described and critical steps are under control.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  appearance, 
identification  umeclidinium  (UV,  HPLC),  mean  umeclidinium  content,  umeclidinium 
uniformity of delivered dose (HPLC), fine particle mass (by next generation impaction) and 
microbiological quality. The analytical methods have been adequately validated.    
Batch analysis data have been presented for eleven production-scale batches. Results have 
been  presented  for  eight  batches  in  the  30-dose  and  three  batches  in  the  7-dose 
presentations. The batches were all produced at the intended site of manufacture.  
CHMP assessment report

All  batches  for  which  results  have  been  provided  complied  fully  with  the  release 
specification presented above. The data confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture 
and  indicate  that  the  process  is  capable  of  consistently  producing  a  finished  product  that 
meets the predefined specifications and that the manufacturing process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data have been generated under long-term (25ºC/60%RH), intermediate (30ºC/75 
%RH),  and  accelerated  (40ºC/75%RH)  conditions  in  line  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Up  to 
18 months primary stability data for umeclidinium inhalation powder are presented for three 
batches. These batches were produced at production-scale and assembled at the proposed 
commercial site using a representative commercial process. The primary pack (blister strip) 
is identical to the one intended for commercialisation, and the tray and inhaler used in the 
stability  studies  are  representative  of  the  commercial  ones.  The  tests  performed  are  the 
same as those performed at release and are considered to be stability indicating.  
Three months in-use stability data for both initial and aged product are presented. Testing 
has  been  performed  from  the  initial  time  point  and  after  storage  for  6  and  9  months  at 
25°C/60%  RH.  Following  removal  of  the  secondary  packaging  and  desiccant  packet,  the 
inhaler  was  replaced  on  storage  at  25°C/75%  RH.  The  results  of  the  stability  studies 
demonstrate the chemical and physical stability of the finished product when stored for the 
proposed in-use  storage  period  at 25°C/75%  RH.  No  significant  changes  were  observed  in 
description,  drug-related  impurity,  content  of  umeclidinium  or  particle  size  distribution.  All 
results comply with the proposed commercial specification up to the proposed patient in-use 
period. 
In  addition,  photostability  and  stress  testing  was  performed:  freeze/thaw  studies,  high 
temperature and UV-visible light exposure. 
The shelf-life specifications include the same tests as for release with the exception of the 
following three additional tests: drug-related impurities (HPLC) and mean moisture content. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in 
the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Information  on  the  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and 
finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner and adequate information has 
been provided on the design and testing of the inhalation device. The results of tests carried 
out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and 
these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in the clinic.  
The  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  active  substance  and 
finished product and their manufacturing. Process. However, no design spaces were claimed 
for the manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant has conducted a nonclinical toxicological evaluation to support the long-term 
clinical use of UMEC, with in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies, safety 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and general toxicity evaluation. Genotoxicity, reproductive 
toxicology and carcinogenic potential have also been evaluated, along with the potential for 
eye and dermal irritancy. 
GLP aspects 
All safety pharmacology studies, a number of pharmacokinetic studies and all pivotal 
general toxicity studies, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies, 
including the toxicokinetic evaluation of each study, were conducted in compliance with 
Good Laboratory Practice regulations. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The  primary  pharmacology  studies  conducted  with  UMEC  (GSK573719)  showed  that  the 
product  have  an  antagonist  activity  against  all 5  human  mAChRs  in  CHO  cells  with  affinity 
values  in  the  sub-nM  range.  In  addition,  saturation,  association  and  dissociation  binding 
studies  showed  that  UMEC  display  a  high  affinity  for  receptor  subtypes  mAChR-3  and 
mAChR-2.  3H-UMEC  associated  faster  and  had  a  faster  t½  with  the  mAChR-2  receptor 
compared with the mAChR-3 receptor. In studies conducted with mAChR-1, -2 and -3 it was 
shown that UMEC is a competitive inhibitor of the three receptor subtypes in vitro. Lastly, a 
study  conducted  with  the  human  metabolites  GSK1761002  (M33)  and  GSK339067  (M14) 
showed that M33 is a functional inhibitor of mAChR-1 and mAChR-3 in vitro, about ~10-fold 
less  potent  than  UMEC,  while  GSK339067  has  negligible  pharmacological  activity. 
GSK1761002A  (M33)  and  GSK339067A  (M14)  were  shown  to  have  no  direct  stimulatory 
effect at any of the mAChR tested. 
In vivo, UMEC was able to block the MCh-induced bronchoconstriction in a dose-dependent 
and  sustained  manner  with  UMEC  producing  50%  or  greater  inhibition  for  up  to  72  hours 
when  administered 
intranasally.  In  addition,  UMEC  dose-dependently  blocked  the 
bronchoconstriction  in  guinea  pigs  after  intratracheal  instillation,  in  a  sustained  and  dose-
dependent manner. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 16/144 
 
 
  
  
Studies  were  performed  to  investigate  whether  inhaled  administration  of  the  excipient 
magnesium  stearate  affected  pulmonary  function.  Regarding  the  studies  conducted  in 
conscious  rats  and  guinea  pigs,  acute  inhaled  exposure  to  a  dry  powder  formulation  of 
magnesium stearate for 60 minutes did not produce overt pharmacological effects. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  vitro  secondary  pharmacodynamics  studies  were  conducted  with  a  battery  of  50 
receptors,  ion  channels,  enzymes  and  transporters.  UMEC  showed  affinity  for  the  kappa 
opioid receptor, sigma receptor, Ca2+ channel, Na+ channel and dopamine transporter. In 
guinea  pigs,  UMEC  did  not  consistently  affect  ACh-induced  bradycardia.  Considering  the 
high  selectivity  of  UMEC  for  the  mAChRs  and  the  low  plasma  concentrations  (as  a 
consequence  of  the  low  concentration  of  inhaled  dose),  it  is  unlikely  that  UMEC  would 
interact  in  vivo  with  these  receptor  proteins.  Furthermore,  the  neurobehavioral  effects 
associated  with  activity  at  opioid  and  dopamine  receptors  have  not  been  observed  in 
preclinical safety studies. 
As UMEC is a pan-active mAChR antagonist there is a potential for UMEC to have activity at 
extra-pulmonary  muscarinic  receptors  (e.g.,  cardiac  mAChR-2).  However,  based  on  local 
delivery to the lungs, the proposed low dose and the poor oral bioavailability of UMEC, the 
Applicant’s  conclusion  that  activity  will  likely  be  restricted  to  the  airway  is  plausible. 
Available  in  vivo  data  support  this  as  no  effect  on  ACh-induced  bradycardia  was  seen 
following  intratracheal  dosing  of  UMEC  (0.25  or  2.5  mcg)  in  guinea  pigs  suggesting  that 
there  was  little  or  no  systemic  exposure  to  M2  receptors on  the  myocardium of  the  heart.  
Based  on  these  data  the  Applicant  calculated  that  UMEC  had  a  therapeutic  window  of  at 
least  10  fold  between  the  desired  bronchodilatory  effect  (mAChR-3)  and  adverse 
cardiovascular effects (mAChR-2) such as bradycardia.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
The  in  vivo  safety  pharmacology  study  on  central  and  peripheral  effects  in  rats  showed 
dilated pupils in few animals. A single inhaled dose of UMEC (215 or 2206 μg/kg) produced 
reversible  increases  in  respiratory  rate  (18  to  45%)  and  concurrent  decreases  in  tidal 
volume  (3  to  17%)  with  no  apparent  effect  on  minute  volume  during  the  exposure.  The 
Applicant considers that this finding could be related to the pharmacology of UMEC. As it is 
known  that  increasing  bronchoconstriction  generally  causes  a  slower  deeper  breathing 
pattern, it would be reasonable to assume that bronchodilation could lead to a more rapid, 
shallow  breathing  pattern  to  optimize  mechanical  efficiency.    Direct  lung  function  was  not 
measured during the repeat dose inhaled toxicity program on UMEC in both rats and dogs. 
However,  given  that  the  changes  observed  were  minimal  and  reversible,  an  altered 
breathing pattern was only detected at high doses in the dog in dose ranging studies and is 
considered  to  be  procedure-related  and  no  histological  changes  in  the  lung  indicative  of 
altered lung compliance or airway obstruction were observed. The Applicant considers that 
the reversible minimal effect observed is not of concern for humans. As expected, changes 
in ventilatory parameters with UMEC are observed in clinical trials in COPD patients and are 
regarded as beneficial. 
UMEC inhibited hERG channel tail current in vitro and, as expected from the pharmacology 
of  muscarinic  antagonists,  caused  a  number  of  cardiovascular  effects  (increases  in  heart 
rate,  prolongation  of  PR  together  with  transient  second  degree  AV  block  of  Mobitz  Type  I 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014

followed  by  a  decrease  of  RR  interval).  In  the  general  toxicology  studies,  treatment  with 
UMEC caused tachycardia in dogs. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific nonclinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed with 
UMEC. Based on the high selectivity of the UMEC to its native receptors, and the low plasma 
concentrations within the efficacious dose range (as a consequence of the low inhaled  dose 
and  its  subsequent  high  rate  of  clearance    from  the  bloodstream  as  well  as  the  poor  oral 
bioavailability),  the  potential  for  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  is  considered  small. 
The  use  of  LAMAs  as  human  medicines  is  well  documented  and  known  potential  drug 
interactions  are  described  in  the  prescribing  information.  Considering  the  clinical  data,  no 
additional PD drug interactions studies are necessary 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A  comprehensive  set  of  pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic  studies  have  been  conducted  with 
UMEC  and  the  data  presented  is  considered  to  adequately  characterise  the  PK  profile  of 
UMEC.  The  PK  parameters  of  UMEC  were  studied  in the  rat,  dog  and  human.  The  PK  after 
intravenous  administration  were  similar  across  the  species  investigated  including  human, 
with  a  high  clearance,  indicating  extrahepatic  clearance  routes  such  as  direct  renal 
secretion,  and  a  large  volume  of  distribution,  indicating  extensive  distribution  into  tissues. 
Subcutaneous  and  intravenous  administrations  were  considered  appropriate  surrogates  for 
inhalation  administration  to  achieve  systemic  exposure  in  safety  pharmacology  and 
preliminary embryofetal studies. 
The Applicant included TK measurements of UMEC in most repeated dose inhalation toxicity 
studies in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. Inter-animal and inter-study variability of systemic 
exposure was relatively high as is typical for inhalation administration, especially in the dog. 
Generally,  systemic  exposure  to  UMEC  following  inhalation  administration  to  mice,  rats, 
rabbits, dogs and humans increased with increasing dose in an approximately proportional 
manner.  Cmax  was  usually  detected  immediately  after  the  administration  in  all  species, 
indicating rapid absorption across the lung. 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of UMEC  was moderate in animals and human. Protein 
binding  data  obtained  using  plasma  from  renally  or  hepatically  impaired  human  subjects 
was slightly higher to that in plasma from healthy subjects. Blood cell association of UMEC 
was  low  in  nonclinical  species  and  human.  Protein  binding  and  blood  cell  association  for 
UMEC  were  independent  of  concentration  over  the  range  investigated.  In  addition,  UMEC 
was shown to be a substrate of human P-gp and of human organic cation transporter OCT1 
and  OCT2.  These  transporters  are  predominantly  located  in  the  liver  and  kidney, 
respectively. This data is contraindicative of distribution into tissues, and suggestive of the 
involvement of an active transport mechanism in the distribution of UMEC. However, further 
test  on  UMEC  as  a  substrate  for  OATP1B1  and  OATP1B3,  as  a  possible  hepatic  uptake 
transporters,  and  BCRP  and  BSEP  for  their  possible  involvement  in  the  biliary  excretion 
should  be  considered  and  have  been  requested  as  further  data  to  be  provided  post-
authorisation.  
Studies  in  rats  showed  that  radioactivity  was  rapidly  and  widely  distributed  following 
intravenous  administration.  Tissue  concentrations  decreased  with  time  and  were  generally 
below  the  limit  of  quantification  by  10  days  after  dosing.  Highest  concentrations  or 
radioactivity  were  observed  in  liver  and  kidneys,  the  organs  associated  with  clearance  of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014

UMEC. Some accumulation in the uveal tract and retina was detected. In addition, retention 
of  UMEC  in  the  lungs  of  mice  was  demonstrated  for  up  to  24  hours  following  a  single 
intranasal administration. 
The metabolite profile of UMEC was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in several species, as well 
as  in  humans.  The  main  routes  of  metabolism  were  oxidation  followed by  conjugation  and 
O-dealkylation.  All  the  metabolites  in  human  were  also  observed  in  at  least  one  species 
used for nonclinical toxicology testing. In addition, the production of metabolites in human 
liver microsomes was shown to be mediated primarily by CYP2D6, with CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 
playing minor roles. 
The  elimination  of  14C-UMEC  was  investigated  following  a  single  administration  to  mice, 
rats  and  dogs  by  oral  and/or  intravenous  dosing.  Following  oral  administration,  the 
excretion  of  radioactivity  was  almost  entirely  via  the  faeces  in  rat  and  dog,  which  is 
consistent with humans and with the very low oral bioavailability observed in rat and dog.  
On the other hand, elimination after i.v. administration to mice, rats and dogs was both via 
the faeces (49-66%) and urine (8-17%). Not all the dose was recovered in the excreta over 
the  collection  period,  being  some  prolonged  retention  of  radioactivity,  with  quantifiable 
amounts  in  the  carcass  of  mice  and  rats,  and  radioactivity  being  present  in  excreta  at  the 
last  collection  time  point  in  all  species,  including  humans.  However,  the  majority  of  the 
radioactivity  was  eliminated  moderately  rapid  with  over  half  the  dose  excreted  within  24 
hours in the rat and mouse, and 48 hours in the dog. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
An adequate package of toxicity studies has been conducted with UMEC in relevant species. 
NOAELs were identified in each of the nonclinical species which provide good safety margins 
compared to the maximum proposed commercial dose of UMEC (55 μg/day delivered dose). 
Single dose toxicity 
No specific single dose toxicity studies were conducted with UMEC. Dose escalation in the 7 
day  dose  range  finding  inhalation  studies  in  the  rat  and  the  dog  identified  dose-limiting 
toxicity in the respiratory tract. In the in vivo genotoxicity micronucleus test, rats tolerated 
two intravenous doses of 10,000 or 20,000 mcg/kg (dose limited by solubility). Single oral 
doses up to 1,000,000 mcg/kg were well tolerated in the mouse. In the rat, a single dose of 
50  mcg/kg  and  60  mcg/kg  was  well  tolerated  using  the  intravenous  and  subcutaneous 
routes respectively. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In  repeat  dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies,  the  principal  toxicities  seen  with  UMEC  were 
irritant  effects  in  the  respiratory  tract  and  pharmacology-related  cardiovascular  effects,  as 
well as a reduction in body weight gain. 
According  to  the  Applicant,  the  spectrum  of  microscopic  changes  observed  in  the  upper 
respiratory  tract  of  mice,  rats  and  dogs  are  considered  to  be  indicative  of  a  local  irritant 
effect to UMEC, which could have been exacerbated by the drying of the mucosa associated 
with  the  antimuscarinic  pharmacological  action  of  UMEC.  This  justification  is  considered 
acceptable.  In  addition,  the  NOAELs  in  the  inhalation  rodent  studies  were  determined 
according  to  the  severity  of  upper  respiratory  tract  irritancy.  The  Applicant  considers  that 
these  clinical  observations  are  of  little  relevance  to  humans  as  the  larynx  is  a  particularly 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 19/144 
 
  
  
sensitive area of the respiratory tract in rodents and the duration and method in which the 
rodents were dosed (nose-only inhalation for 60 minutes) is very different to the short oral 
inhalation  method  of  administration  in  humans.  In  humans,  local  irritancy  (e.g.  cough, 
nasopharyngitis,  oropharyngeal  pain)  were  commonly  reported  during  clinical  trials  across 
all  treatment  arms  which  included  placebo.    However,  they  were  not  associated  with  any 
sequelae.   
On  the  other  hand,  tachycardia  is  a  common  effect of  LAMAs,  as  well  as  alterations  in  ion 
channel  activities  in  vitro  and  it  is  expected  from  the  pharmacology  of  muscarinic 
antagonists. 
Granuloma formation in the lung was observed in one dog study and was considered to be 
secondary to excessive antimuscarinic pharmacology. Gall bladder distension and myofibre 
degeneration detected in one 14-day dog study was not observed in pivotal studies in dogs, 
and  available  clinical  data  indicate  no  increased  risk  for  gall  bladder  distension  or  clinical 
symptoms. The test article relationship of the arterial changes in the heart and lungs in the 
39 week study in dogs could not be established; however, it was considered to be incidental 
or  an  exacerbation  of  an  underlying  idiopathic  disease.  Therefore,  all  these  findings  are 
considered of less importance and without clinical significance which is acceptable.  
Genotoxicity 
The  study’s  results  indicate  that  UMEC  does  not  pose  a  genotoxicity  risk  to  patients.  An 
assessment of the route of synthesis for UMEC (as the bromide salt) has been conducted to 
determine  whether  any  impurities  might  be  present  which  are  known  or  suspected  DNA-
reactive mutagens, and to assess the likelihood of any such impurities being present in final 
drug product. There were no impurities of mutagenic concern at a level that would exceed 
the  threshold  of  toxicological  concern  (TTC)  as  defined  by  guidelines  on  the  limits  for 
genotoxic impurities. 
Carcinogenicity 
Administration of UMEC did not increase the incidence of neoplastic findings in mice or rats. 
An  apparent  increase  in  the  incidence  of  two  rare  tumor  types  in  rats  was  not  considered 
treatment-related because it appeared only in one group/sex. 
The non-neoplastic findings associated with administration of UMEC by inhalation for up to 
104  weeks  to  mice  and  rats  included  upper  respiratory  tract  irritancy,  accumulations  of 
eosinophilic  inclusions,  accumulation  of  alveolar  macrophages  and  effects  on  the  eye  and 
Harderian glands. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  in  the  rat  and  rabbit,  UMEC  had  no 
effects on male or female mating performance or fertility at inhaled doses of up to 180 and 
294  mcg/kg/day,  respectively.  In  addition,  no  effects  on  embryofetal  survival  and 
development were seen in either the rat or rabbit following inhaled doses up to 278 and 306 
mcg/kg/day,  respectively  or  in  the  rabbit  following  subcutaneous  doses  up  to  180 
mcg/kg/day.  In  a  rat  pre-and  post-natal  study,  slightly  decreased  pre-weaning  pup  body 
weights  in  litters  was  related  to  a  decreased  maternal  body  weight  gain  and  food 
consumption. There were no other effects on pre-natal or post-natal development.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 20/144 
 
  
  
The  male  fertility  study  and  the  pre-and  post-natal  study  in  rats  were  conducted  by 
subcutaneous  administration;  however,  considering  the  high  exposure  observed  by  this 
route of administration, this is not considered an issue. Systemic exposure at the NOAEL in 
maternal  rats  was  approximately  80  times  the  exposure  in  humans  at  the  proposed 
commercial  dose  of  62.4  μg/kg/day.Based  on  the  proposed  indication  and  associated 
patient  population,  the  lack  of  juvenile  toxicity  studies  is  acceptable.  UMEC  is  being 
developed as a therapy for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease which 
was added to the list of class waivers following an EMEA decision on 3rd December 2007. 
Local Tolerance  
UMEC  was  shown  to  be  a  non-sensitiser  of  the  skin  in  a  mouse  local  lymph  node  assay.  
When  tested  in  a  SkinEthic  Reconstituted  Human  Epidermal  model  it  was  considered  as  a 
mild-moderate irritant.  Similarly, in a SkinEthic Reconstituted Human Corneal model, UMEC 
was considered to be a mild-moderate ocular irritant. 
Other toxicity studies 
All specified impurities greater than the 0.15% threshold have been appropriately qualified 
in the 13 week study in mice, 26 week study in rats or 39 week study in dogs. In addition, 
none  of  the  specified  impurities  are  present  at  a  level  above  1.5  μg/day,  the  threshold  of 
toxicological concern. Regarding the genotoxic impurities, none of them are at a level that 
would exceed the threshold of toxicological concern (>1.5 μg/day). 
In vitro studies, UMEC showed no evidence of hemolysis in rat, dog or human blood. 
Magnesium stearate 
The repeated dose toxicity studies conducted with the excipient magnesium stearate at very 
high  doses  in  rats  and  dogs  did  not  show  clinically  relevant  findings  at  the  dose 
administered  in  the  proposed  commercial  dose  of  UMEC.  In  addition,  numerous  toxicology 
studies,  as  well  as  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  studies,  have  confirmed  that 
magnesium  stearate  was  not  associated  with  any  toxicological  or  local  respiratory  tract 
tolerance  issues,  did  not  affect  the  pharmacology  or  pharmacokinetics  of  the  active 
substances  and  is  therefore  considered  an  acceptable  inhalation  formulation  excipient  for 
clinical use.  Moreover, magnesium stearate use in general is well characterised and widely 
used  as  a  pharmaceutical  excipient  in  inhalation  formulations  for  marketed  respiratory 
medicines throughout the world. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Umeclidinium PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT 
substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore umeclidinium is not expected to pose 
a  risk  to  the  environment.  Some  environmental  fate  and  effects  studies  have  been 
conducted  with  umeclidinium  and  the  results  and  associated  study  reports  have  been 
provided in the non-clinical dossier.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A  comprehensive  non-clinical  package  has  been  conducted  with  umeclidinium  bromide 
which  has  adequately  characterised  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and toxicology  of 
umeclidinium  bromide.  Further  information  for  UMEC  on  protein  interaction  should  be 
considered  and  UMEC  should  be  tested  as  a  substrate  for  OATP1B1  and  OATP1B3,  as  a 
possible hepatic uptake transporters, and BCRP and BSEP for their possible involvement in 
the  biliary  excretion.  The  applicant  has  agreed  to  provide  the  required  data  and  this  is 
captured in the risk management plan.  
Umeclidinium was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was  not carcinogenic 
in lifetime inhalation studies in mice or rats at exposures ≥ 26 or ≥ 22-fold, times the human 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014

clinical  exposure  of  umeclidinium  55 micrograms  delivered  dose,  based  on  AUC, 
respectively.  
Umeclidinium  was  not  teratogenic  in  rats  or  rabbits.  In  a  pre-  and  post-natal  study, 
subcutaneous administration of umeclidinium to rats resulted in lower maternal body weight 
gain  and  food  consumption  and  slightly  decreased  pre-weaning  pup  body  weights  in  dams 
given 180 micrograms/kg/day dose (approximately 80-times the human clinical exposure of 
umeclidinium 55 micrograms delivered dose, based on AUC).  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  overall  non-clinical  development  programme  of  the  umeclidinium  was  considered 
adequate  to  support  the  recommendation  for  a  marketing  authorisation  for  Incruse.  The 
available  non-clinical  data  and  the  environmental  risk  assessment  did  not  raise  any 
particular  safety  issue.  The  observed  toxic  effects  are  known  class  effects  and  primarily 
considered  to  be  related  to  an  exacerbated  pharmacological  activity  of  the  product  and 
indicative  of  its  local  irritant  effects.  The  use  of  this  class  of  compound  in  COPD  is  well 
established  and  the  margins  of  safety  between  exposures  at  which  effects  were  seen  and 
exposures achieved at the clinical dose are considered adequate.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
A  total  of  21  clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  supporting  the  clinical  pharmacology  of 
UMEC.  Studies  conducted  with  UMEC  alone  included  administration  by  the  inhaled  (IH), 
intravenous, and oral (PO) routes.

Table 1.  All Clinical Studies Referenced Herein by Treatment 
A total of 10 clinical studies have been conducted to investigate efficacy and safety of UMEC 
described  in  this  application:  3  Phase  IIb  studies  (AC4113073,  AC4115321,  and 
AC4113589)  to  support  dose  selection  and  dosing  interval  of  UMEC  in  COPD  subjects,  as 
well as 7 Phase III studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of UMEC in which a total of 
2564 subjects were treated with UMEC monotherapy or Placebo. Of these 7 studies, 1 is a 
12-week  and  3  are  24-week  Efficacy  Studies,  2  are  12-week  Exercise  Endurance  Studies, 
and  1  is  a  52-week  safety  study  that  provides  long-term  data  supportive  of  efficacy 
(DB2113359).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of UMEC were studied after 
oral  and  intravenous  administration  of  radiolabeled  drug  (Study  AC4112014).  Supportive 
ADME data for intravenous UMEC and primary ADME data for inhaled UMEC were provided 
in Study AC4112008. 
Study AC4112014 was a single-centre, open-label study in 6 healthy male subjects. Each 
subject  participated  in  two  separate  dosing  periods.  In  the  first  period,  each  subject 
received  a  65  μg  single  dose  of  IV  infusion  containing  7.1  μCi  (approximately  0.3  MBq)  of 
[14C]-GSK573719. In the second period, each subject received a single 1000 μg oral dose 
containing  50  μCi  (approximately  2  MBq)  of  [14C]-GSK573719.  The  two  dosing  periods 
were  separated  by  a  washout  of  at  least  28  days.  The  duration  of  the  study  was 
approximately  11–12  weeks  for  each  subject.  Plasma  concentrations  of  unchanged  UMEC 
following  single  PO  dose  administration  of  [14C]-UMEC  were  all  not  quantifiable  (NQ). 
Plasma  total  radioactivity  pharmacokinetic  parameter  estimated  following  both  IV  and  PO 
administrations of [14C]-GSK573719 are summarised in the table below.

Table 3.  Summary  of  plasma  14C-  radioactivity  pharmacokinetic  parameters 
following both intravenous and oral administration of [14C]-GSK573719 
Mean  PO  bioavailability  estimates  of  plasma  14C-radioactivity  following  PO  administrations 
of  [14C]-UMEC  calculated  based  on  AUC(0-∞)  were  similar  to  those  calculated  based  on 
AUC(0-t) and were approximately 5.4% (95% CI: 1.8%, 15.9%) and 4.7% (95% CI: 2.1%, 
10.3%),  respectively.  Since  PO  bioavailability  of  unchanged  UMEC  was  negligible,  these 
data suggest that the majority of the dose was not absorbed and that there were low levels 
of  metabolites  in  the  systemic  circulation.  This  was  also  supported  by  <1%  total 
radioactivity in urine following PO administration. These data support very low absorption of 
radiolabelled drug with negligible absolute bioavailability of UMEC following PO dose. 
Study  AC4112008  (module  5.3.1.1)  was  a  single-centre,  open-label,  sequential,  cross-
over study to evaluate examine the pharmacokinetics of three ascending single intravenous 
doses (20, 50 and 65 mcg), a single 1000 μg oral dose and a single 1000 μg inhaled dose of 
GSK573719  in  10  healthy  male  volunteers.  This  study  is  the  primary  study  for  defining 
biovailibility of inhaled UMEC. 
Following  a  single  inhaled  dose  administration,  UMEC  was  rapidly  absorbed  with  the  Cmax 
values  occurring  at  approximately  5  to  15  minutes  postdose.  Plasma  concentrations 
declined rapidly following the occurrence of Cmax. Plasma concentrations of UMEC following 
single  PO  dose  administration  of  UMEC  were  all  non-quantifiable  (NQ)  (bioanalytical  assay 
LLQ was 0.02 ng/mL). Therefore the maximal possible oral bioavailability was calculated as 
<1%. Selected plasma PK parameters of this study are summarized in the table below. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 27/144 
 
 
  
  
Table 4.  Summary  of  Selected  UMEC  Pharmacokinetic  Parameters  Following  a 
Single Dose Administration in Healthy Subjects (study AC4112008) 
Absolute  bioavailability  of  UMEC  following  inhaled  administration  was  calculated  using 
plasma data following 1000 mcg IH which averaged 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
9.0%,  18.2%).  Results  were  similar  for  urine  data,  with  F  averaging  13.1%  (95%  CI: 
10.5%, 16.3%). Absolute bioavailability of UMEC following PO administration using plasma 
data  was  reported  as  negligible  (<1%)  since  all  plasma  concentrations  of  UMEC  were  NQ 
following PO administration. Assuming that drug not accounted for by inhaled bioavailability 
is  swallowed  (87%)  and  that  the  oral  bioavailability  for  the  swallowed  portion  of  the  dry 
powder  dose  is  similar  to  that  observed  following  oral  solution  administration;  the  highest 
possible  contribution  of  the  swallowed  portion  of  the  inhaled  dose  to  the  total  systemic 
exposure would be approximately 7% for UMEC. Since it is unlikely that oral absorption for 
the dry powder would be as high as that for the solution, the contribution of the swallowed 
dose to total systemic exposure is considered to be negligible.  
Bioequivalence 
No  bioequivalence  studies  were  performed  with  UMEC  since  there  were  no  changes  to  the 
formulation after the start of the Phase III studies. 
Data from food-interaction studies  
No  study  to  investigate  possible  effects  of  food on  the  bioavailability  of  inhaled  UMEC  was 
conducted.  The  per  oral  (PO)  bioavailability  of  UMEC  is  negligible  (<1%).  Even  if  co-
administration  with  food  were  to  affect  the  rate  and/or  extent  of  absorption  of  UMEC,  it 
would  not  be  expected  to  significantly  impact  the  systemic  exposure,  compared  with  the 
fasted state, at the proposed clinical doses of UMEC. Therefore it is acceptable to the CHMP 
that no food effect study was performed. 
Distribution 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 28/144 
 
 
 
  
  
Following intravenous dosing, UMEC was rapidly and extensively distributed with an average 
last  of  1  hour  (Study  AC4112014  described  above).  The  average  volume  of  distribution  at 
steady state was 86.2 L, which is greater than the total body water for a 70 kg man (42 L). 
Blood cell association of UMEC was low in humans with a blood to plasma ratio ranging from 
0.67  at  45  minutes  post  dose  to  0.82  up  to  24  hours  post  dose  (Study  AC4112014).    In 
vitro  plasma  protein  binding  of  UMEC  in  human  plasma  was  moderate  with  an  average 
value of 88.9% and was similar in plasma from males and females (Study 07DMW030 and 
Study  QBR113236).  Both  plasma  protein  binding  and  blood  cell  binding  for  UMEC  were 
independent of concentration (Study 07DMW030). 
Elimination 
Excretion 
The  plasma  clearance  of  UMEC  is  rapid  and  extensive  and  was  reported  to  be  around  151 
litres/hour.  After  radiolabelled  administration  of  IV  UMEC,  it  is  mainly  excreted  in  faeces 
(58% of radiolabelled dose) and secondarily in urine (22% of the radiolabelled dose). This 
indicates  secretion  in  to bile.    Following  oral  administration  of  radiolabelled  UMEC,  92%  of 
the  radiolabelled  dose  is  excreted  in  the  faeces  and  less  than  1%  is  excreted  in  urine, 
suggesting  negligible  absorption  following  oral  administration.  The  half-life  of  UMEC  after 
inhalation  was  calculated  to  be  19  hours.  In  the  radiolabelled  studies  of  UMEC  (after  IV 
administration),  recovery  in  the  human  ADME  study  is  low  with  only  81%  of  the  dose 
recovered. The guideline suggests that recovery should be greater than 90%, however it is 
accepted that this is a low dose compound. The applicant suggests that the low recovery in 
the  human  radiolabeled  study  is  due  to  the  low  radioactive,  and  chemical,  dose  and 
therefore a greater contribution of non specific binding during analysis.  This is considered a 
reasonable explanation. 
Metabolism 
The  human  metabolism  of  UMEC  was  investigated  using  fecal,  urine,  plasma,  and  bile 
samples  collected  following  intravenous  (65  mcg)  and  oral  (1000  mcg)  administration  of 
(14C)-UMEC  in  Study  AC4112014.  Metabolic  profiles  were  reported  in  a  separate  study 
(Study  11DMW019).  The  proposed  metabolic  pathway  of  UMEC  in  animals  and  humans  is 
illustrated in Figure below.

EMA/175100/2014 
Page 29/144 
 
  
  
Figure 1.  Putative Metabolic Scheme for the Major Metabolites of UMEC in Animals and 
Humans 
In vitro studies showed that umeclidinium bromide is principally metabolised by cytochrome 
P450  2D6  (CYP2D6)  and  is  a  substrate  for  the  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)  transporter.  The 
primary  metabolic  routes 
for  umeclidinium  bromide  are  oxidative  (hydroxylation, 
O-dealkylation)  followed  by  conjugation  (glucuronidation,  etc),  resulting  in  a  range  of 
metabolites  with  either  reduced  pharmacological  activity  or  for  which  the  pharmacological 
activity  has  not  been  established.  Systemic  exposure  to  the  metabolites  is  low.  The 
information  on  the  major  elimination,  including  enzymes/transport  proteins  involved,  is 
unclear.  The  applicant  has  agreed  to  provide  the  required  data  and  this  is  captured  in  the 
risk management plan.  Estimated submission is 1Q2015. 
Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Based  on  the  results  of  in-vitro  studies,  the  applicant  has  conducted  appropriate  clinical 
studies  to  address  any  potential  efficacy/safety  issues  in  patients  with  relevant  genetic 
polymorphism  to  CYP2D6  (Study  AC4110106).  Plasma  and  urine  PK  data  suggested  no 
evidence of a difference in GSK573719 systemic exposure between healthy volunteers and 
CYP2D6  PM  population.  Following  GSK573719  500  μg  on  Day  7,  plasma  AUC(0-τ) 
(hr*ng/mL) and Cmax (ng/mL) ratios (90% CI) between PM vs healthy volunteer were 1.03 
(0.79,  1.34)  and  0.80  (0.59,  1.08)  respectively  and  urine  Ae(0-24)  (ng)  ratio  was  1.01 
(0.82,  1.26)  and  similar  ratios  were  observed  following  other  single  and  repeat  dose 
regimen.  The  proposed  action  (no  dose  adjustment  is  recommended)  is  supported  by  the 
results of the study.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The PK results show that systemic exposure is dose-proportional in the dose ranges tested. 
However given the large inter-subject variability for all parameters, this should be accepted 
with caution. In terms of the time dependency of PK, the accumulation looks consistent with 
what  would  be  expected  based  on  the  half-life  (AUC(0-inf)/AUC(0-tau).  The  applicant  has 
explained  that  AUC(inf)  could  not  be  used  in  calculations  of  R  because  UMEC  lambda  z 
(which is required to calculate AUC(inf)) and t1/2 could not be accurately determined due to 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 30/144 
 
 
 
  
  
one  or  more  of  the  following  reasons:  limited  sampling,  a  large  number  of  NQ  samples 
associated with low dose, and a flat elimination phase. Therefore, different derivable AUC0-
t’ (where t’ is the latest time at which concentrations were quantified) following single dose 
and repeat dose were used to calculate R based on AUC. In conclusion, although observed 
data  show  high  inter-study  variability,  dose  strengths,  and  extent  of  sampling  during  the 
elimination  phase,  the  results  indicate  that,  on  average,  the  accumulation  appears 
consistent with that expected based on the calculated half-life. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In the studies carried out in healthy subjects, a large inter-subject co-efficient of variation 
(%)  for  Cmax  was  seen:  39%  (Study  DB2114635);  46%  (DB2113950)  and  35% 
(AC4110106) for UMEC 500 mcg dose. For the UMEC 1000 mcg dose a CV of 64% is shown 
in  study  AC4110106.  Similar  results  were  obtained  from  the  studies  performed  in  patients 
with COPD. The large inter-subject variability for the estimation of the PK of UMEC may be 
due  to  the  low  systemic  exposures  and  the  variability  in  estimation  near  the  limit  of 
quantification.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The  most  pertinent  data  on  PK  in  COPD  subjects  was  estimated  by  population 
pharmacokinetic  modeling  of  data  from  Phase  3a  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  studies. 
However,  the  PK  profile  of  UMEC  in  subjects  with  COPD  has  also  been  established  in  one 
Phase I study, two Phase 2a, and three Phase 2b studies.  
The  table  below  compares  UMEC  systemic  exposure  in  terms  of  steady  state  Cmax,  AUC, 
and  percent  of  UMEC  dose  excreted  unchanged  in  urine  over  24  hours  between  healthy 
subjects and subjects with COPD:  
Table 5.  Comparisin  of  UMEC  Systemic  Exposure  in  Healthy  Subjects  vs.  Subjects 
with COPD following Repeat Dosing with UMEC 
Plasma  data  appear  to  show  somewhat  lower  UMEC  systemic  exposure  in  subjects  with 
COPD compared with healthy subjects at doses of 500 mcg and lower. At UMEC 1000 mcg, 
systemic exposure does not appear to be different between the 2 populations. The applicant 
argues  this  result  is  skewed  due  to  the  lack  of  steady  state  systemic  exposure  data  in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 31/144 
 
 
 
  
  
healthy subjects at low doses since higher numbers of healthy subject studies used higher 
doses  while  a  greater  number  of  studies  in  subjects  with  COPD  used  lower  doses.  In 
subjects with COPD, studies with the NDPI assessed dose proportionality over the proposed 
therapeutic  dose  range  in  Study  AC4115321  (proposed  therapeutic  and  lower  doses)  and 
Study AC4113073 (proposed therapeutic and higher doses). The obtained values for Cmax 
at  supra-therapeutic  doses  in  the  last  one  are  in  accordance  with  the  expected  dose-
proportionality  response.  However,  data  from  other  studies  (AC4105211  and  AC4113589) 
are  far  from  the  expected  values  according  a  dose-proportionality  response.  The  applicant 
argued  that  the  higher  Cmax  in  Study  AC4105211at  1000  mcg  QD  could  be  attributed  to 
the  study  differences  and  low  subject  numbers  and  is  not  a  particular  concern,  which  is 
agreed. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Study  DB2114636  was  a  single-blind,  non-randomised,  single-dose  study  to  investigate 
the  PK  and  safety  of  UMEC  alone  (125  mcg)  and  UMEC/VI  (125/25  mcg)  in  subjects  with 
severe  renal  impairment  compared  with  healthy  subjects.  Nine  subjects  with  severe  renal 
impairment were enrolled with nine matched healthy control subjects. All subjects received 
a  single  dose  of  UMEC 125 mcg  followed  by  a  single  dose  of  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg, 
separated  by  a  washout  of  at  least  7  days.  Table  below  shows  the  absorption 
pharmacokinetic results by renal function status. 
Table 6.  Summary of Results from Statistical Analysis of Derived UMEC Plasma PK 
Parameters (DB2114636) 
There was no effect of renal impairment on urine t 1/2 (healthy subjects: 9.66 hours (95% CI 
4.44, 20.99); severe renal impairment: 8.03 hours (95% CI: 6.49, 9.94). 
In conclusion, there is no need for dose adjustment when UMEC is administered to patients 
with impaired renal function.

Impaired hepatic function  
Study  DB2114637  (Module  5.3.3.3)  was  an  open-label,  non-randomised  study  to 
investigate the PK and safety of single- and repeat-doses of UMEC alone (125 mcg) and a 
single  dose  of  UMEC/VI  (125/25  mcg)  in  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment 
compared with healthy subjects.  
Hepatic impairment was classified using the Child-Pugh system –moderate: Child-Pugh B (7 
to  9  points).  Eligible  subjects  were  males  or  females  aged  18–70  years,  inclusive,  with  a 
body  weight  ≥45  kg  and  a  body  mass  index  within  the  range  18–  33  kg/m2.  Healthy 
subjects  had  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT),  alkaline  phosphatase  and  bilirubin  ≤1.5  x 
upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN).  Subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  had  a  known 
medical  history  of  liver  disease  with  or  without  a  known  history  of  alcohol  abuse;  and  a 
Child-  Pugh  score  of  7–9  points.  Nine  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  were 
enrolled  and  9 matched  healthy  control  subjects.    All  subjects  received  a  single  dose  of 
UMEC/VI  125/25 mcg,  followed  by  a  7-  to  14-day  washout  and  a  subsequent  second 
treatment period with UMEC 125 mcg once-daily for 7 days.

Parameters (DB2114637) 
Following single-dose administration, plasma UMEC exposure was average lower in subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Table 8.  Summary  of  Results  from  Statistical  Analysis  of  Derived  UMEC  Urine  PK 
Parameters (DB2114637) 
Following single-dose administration, plasma UMEC exposure was average lower in subjects 
with moderate hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects. 
In  conclusion,  administration  of  UMEC  125  mcg  to  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic 
impairment led to exposures that were on average lower for both UMEC in the subjects with 
moderate  hepatic  impairment  than  in  the  healthy  subjects.  These  observed  effects  on 
systemic  exposure  are  not  believed  to  be  clinically  relevant,  and  therefore  no  dose 
adjustment for UMEC is warranted in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. UMEC was

not  studied  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  and  this  is  adequately  reflected  in 
the SmPC. 
Gender 
Population PK analyses showed that gender is not a significant covariate in the PK of UMEC 
and hence dose adjustments are not warranted based on gender (Study DB2116975). 
Race 
UMEC  dataset  primarily  consisted  of  Caucasian  subjects  (87%),  but  there  were  78  (5%) 
Japanese subjects and 67 (4%) South East Asian subjects in the UMEC group. There were 
no  racial  differences  in  apparent  clearance  or  apparent  volume  of  distribution  for  UMEC 
(Study DB2116975). 
Weight 
In  the  population  PK  analyses,  weight  was  found  to  be  significant  covariate  of  apparent 
inhaled clearance of UMEC, and weight was also a significant covariate of apparent volume 
of  distribution.  The  analyses  however  demonstrated  that  the  effect  of  weight  on  PK  is 
marginal  and  no  dose  adjustment  is  warranted  based  on  weight  from  the  final  PK  model 
(Study DB2116975). 
Elderly 
In the population PK analyses, age was found to be significant covariate of apparent inhaled 
clearance  of  UMEC.  The  analyses  however  demonstrated  that  the  effect  of  age  on  PK  is 
marginal and no dose adjustment is warranted based on age from the final PK model.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Interactions 
In  vitro  studies  conducted  using  human  recombinant  cytochrome  P450  (CYP)  enzymes 
showed that UMEC was metabolized mainly by CYP2D6. In a clinical study conducted in both 
healthy  extensive/normal  and  CYP2D6  poor  metaboliser  subjects,  there  was  no  clinically 
significant difference in the systemic exposure to UMEC following 7 days repeat dosing with 
8  to  16-fold  higher  supra-therapeutic  IH  doses.  No  dose  adjustment  for  use  of  CYP2D6 
inhibitors  concomitant  with  UMEC  administration  appears  warranted.  In  vitro  studies  also 
indicated  UMEC  as  a  substrate  of  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp).  Separate  pre-clinical  studies  in 
mdr1a/b  knockout  (P-gp  knockout)  mice  indicated  the  potential  for  increased  systemic 
exposure  to  UMEC  with  potent  P-gp  inhibitors.  However,  there  was  no  evidence  for  UMEC 
inhibiting  P-gp.  Since  P-gp  is  a  relatively  high  capacity  transporter,  a  P-gp  based  clinical 
interaction  is  unlikely  due  to  the  low  inhalation  dose.  No  dose  adjustment  is  therefore 
warranted  for  UMEC  administered  concomitantly  with  P-gp  inhibitors.  UMEC  is  an  in  vitro 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (IC50 values between 0.1 and 1 microM). At clinical doses, 
the highest anticipated Cmax in humans (<0.2 ng/mL or 0.5 nM) is at least 200-fold lower 
than  the  lowest  IC50  value  (0.1  microM)  as  a  worst  case  for  all  CYPs  and  transporters 
investigated.  
In  vivo,  the  study  DB2113950  (Module  5.3.3.4)  was  conducted to  investigate  the  effect  of 
verapamil  on  the  PK  of  UMEC  (administered  as  UMEC  and  as  UMEC/VI  combination).  The 
CHMP assessment report

results did not show any significant effect on the PK of UMEC, except for a 40% increase in 
AUC  of  UMEC  which  is  not  considered  significant.  Results  from  this  study  support  the 
position  that  no  dose  adjustment  is  recommended  in  patients  using  concomitant  P-gp 
transporter inhibitors. Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Exposure relevant for safety information 
A  total  of  8498  PK  observations  from  1635  subjects  contributed  to  the  UMEC  PK  analyses 
(Study  DB2116975).  There  was  no  apparent  pharmacokinetic  –pharmacodynamic 
relationship between maximum heart rate and model predicted UMEC Cmax at steady state. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Umeclidinium  is  an  inhaled  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist  (LAMA)  that  acts  locally  on 
airways  to  produce  bronchodilation.  The  compound  has  activity  across  multiple  muscarinic 
receptor  subtypes.  Umeclidinium  competitively  inhibits  binding  of  acetylcholine  with 
muscarinic  receptors  on  airway  smooth  muscle.  Umeclidinium  demonstrates  slow 
reversibility  at  the  human  M3  muscarinic  receptor  subtype  in  vitro  and  long  duration  of 
action in vivo when administered directly to the lungs in pre-clinical models. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Study AC4105209  
The  Primary  Study  Objective  is  to  investigate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  single  inhaled 
doses of UMEC in healthy male subjects. The key secondary objective was to investigate the 
bronchodilatory  effect  and  duration  of  action  of  single  inhaled  doses  of  GSK573719  as 
measured  by  plethysmography  (specific  airways  conductance  [sGaw],  airways  resistance 
[Raw])  and  spirometry  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  second  (FEV1)  endpoints  in  healthy

male subjects. The treatment phase of the study included 2 interlocking cohorts (Cohorts I 
and II) of 10 healthy male subjects in each cohort. 
Effective  bronchodilatory  activity  was  demonstrated  for  UMEC  as  indicated  in  the  following 
figure.

Analysis of sGaw (1/kPa*s) Data (AC4105209) 
 Higher  sGaw  (mid)  values  were  observed  at  all  time  points  for  UMEC  350  mcg  and 
tiotropium  compared  with  placebo.  At  12  hours,  on  average,  values  showed  a  34% 
improvement over placebo and at 24 hours they showed a 13% and 17% improvement over 
placebo for UMEC 350 mcg and tiotropium, respectively.  
For the UMEC 100 and 250 mcg groups, higher sGaw (mid) values were observed compared 
with placebo at all time points except 24 hours (although the 24-hour results for the UMEC 
250  mcg  were  borderline  to  being  significant).  At  12  hours,  improvements  over  placebo 
were 34% and 24% greater for the UMEC 100 and 250 mcg groups, respectively. 
A display of FEV1 values over time in Study AC4105209 is presented in the plot.

Higher  FEV1  values  were  observed  compared  with  placebo,  for  UMEC  350  mcg  at  all  time 
points  except  at  15  minutes,  and  at  all  time  points  except  for  15  minutes  and  1  hour  for 
UMEC 100 mcg. 
With  regard  to  the  comparison  versus  tiotropium,  at  most  time  points,  the  UMEC  100  and 
350  mcg  groups  showed  increases  in  FEV1  compared  with  tiotropium;  however,  these 
increases  were  not  statistically  significant  (except  at  the  1-hour  time  point  for  the  UMEC 
350 mcg group). 
Study AC4108123 (COPD) 
Study AC4108123 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-
dummy,  dose-ascending,  4-way  crossover,  incomplete  block  study  in  ipratropium 
responsive subjects with COPD. Subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of 4 out 
of  the  5  possible  treatments  (UMEC  (250,  500,  and  1000  mcg),  tiotropium  (18  mcg),  or 
placebo).  In  subjects  with  COPD,  values  of  sGaw  were  on  average  higher  for  all  active 
treatment groups (UMEC 250, 500, and 1000 mcg, and tiotropium 18 mcg) compared with 
placebo  over  the  24-hour  assessment  period,  with  UMEC  doses  of  500  and  1000  mcg 
consistently showing the greatest differences relative to placebo. All 3 UMEC doses resulted 
in higher average sGaw values compared with tiotropium 18 mcg.  
Trends  in  values  of  FEV1  were  similar  to  those  of  sGaw;  higher  values  were  seen  for  all 
active treatment groups compared with placebo, with UMEC 500 and 1000 mcg showing the 
largest differences in adjusted means relative to placebo.

Dose-Effect Relationships for Subjects with COPD 
The  following  dose-ranging  studies  have  been  performed:  1)  AC  4113073  (FIIa);  2)  AC 
4115321 (FIIa); 3) AC 4116689 (combined Study AC4113073 and Study AC4115321).

Two  Phase  2a  dose  ranging  studies  with  UMEC  were  conducted  in  subjects  with  COPD 
(Study  AC4113073  and  Study  AC4115321).  Population  model-based  dose  response 
analyses  were  performed  for  individual  studies.  In  addition,  an  integrated  model-based 
pooled analysis of the data from both studies was undertaken (AC 4116689). The rationale 
for the pooled analysis (combined Study AC4113073 and Study AC4115321) was due to the 
wide dose range of 15.6 mcg to 1000 mcg once-daily, similarity of both studies with respect 
to subject population, and crossover design. The primary endpoint was trough FEV1 at the 
end  of  the  treatment  phase.  Model-based  dose  response  evaluation  was  the  primary 
analysis  in  Study  AC4115321  and  for  the  pooled  analysis  in  Study  AC4116689.  A 
physiological  maximum  effect  (Emax)  model  adequately  characterized  the  dose-trough 
FEV1  response  for  UMEC  over  the  once-daily  dose  range  of  15.6  to  1000  mcg,  with  an 
estimated dose that would yield 50% of Emax (ED50) of 33 mcg (95% CI: 25 - 41) with a 
predicted  maximum  effect  [Emax]  for  trough  FEV1  of  187  ml  [95%  CI  (170,  210].  The 
once-daily  proposed  UMEC  doses  of  62.5  mcg  and  125  mcg  have  shown  dose  related 
increases in trough FEV1. There was no marked difference between the once-versus twice-
daily  regimen  of  the  same  total  daily  dose  for  UMEC.  This  translates  into  UMEC  33  mcg 
providing  50%  of  the  maximum  trough  FEV1  effect  compared  with  30%  for  the  15.6  mcg 
dose, 46% for the 31.25 mcg dose, 63% for the 62.5 mcg dose and 77% for the 125 mcg 
UMEC  dose.  Based  on  simulation,  the  expected  response  at  a  certain  dose  adjusted  for 
placebo  is  given  in  the  below  table.  Further  the  results  indicate  no  advantage  of  a  twice-
daily dosing interval over a once-daily dosing of UMEC.

Effects on QT interval, blood pressure and heart rate 
Thorough QT study DB 2114635 
It  was  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  incomplete  block,  four  period  crossover,  repeat 
dose  study  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  the  inhaled  GSK573719/vilanterol  combination  and 
GSK573719  monotherapy  on  electrocardiographic  parameters,  with  moxifloxacin  as  a 
positive control, in healthy subjects. At least 100 subjects were planned to be enrolled (at

least  50  of  each  gender)  to  ensure  at  least  83  evaluable  subjects  (i.e.,  subjects  who 
complete all treatment periods). The actual number of subjects enrolled was 103 (48 female 
and 55 male), with 86 subjects completing the study. The study was conducted according to 
ICH  recommendations.  The  effect  of  an  eight-fold,  supra-therapeutic  dose  of  UMEC  (500 
mcg  QD)  on  QT  prolongation  was  investigated.  Single-dose  oral  moxifloxacin  400  mg 
(positive  control)  demonstrated  assay  sensitivity  with  mean  increases  in  time-matched 
QTc(F) compared with placebo greater than 5 msec at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after dosing. 
The upper 90% CI exceeded 10 msec at 4 and 8 hours. The following results were found: 
- Effects on QT interval: No categorical QTc (F) effects were observed in the UMEC 500 mcg 
group.  The  study  was  negative  for  UMEC  500  mcg  and  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  in  that  the 
adjusted  mean  treatment  difference  did  not  exceed  5  msec,  and  the  upper  bound  of  the 
90%  CI  for  the  estimated  treatment  difference  did  not  exceed  10  msec  at  any  time  point 
out  to  24  hours  after  dosing.  At  the  supra-therapeutic  dose  of  UMEC/VI  (500/100),  there 
was  evidence  of  an  effect  on  QTc  during  the  first  hour  after  dosing.  The  time-matched 
difference  from  placebo  exceeded  5  msec  at  10  min  and  30  min  post-dose.  The  90%  CI 
exceeded 10 msec only at the 30 min time point. 
- Effects on blood pressure were evaluated for UMEC at 250 mcg, 500 mcg and 1000 mcg. 
For 250 and 500 mcg showed decrease. However UMEC at 1000 mcg showed an increase in 
systolic and diastolic BP of around 3 mmHg. 
-  Efects  on  heart  rate:  In  the  TQT  study,  heart  rate  for  UMEC  500  mcg  was  similar  to 
placebo.  The  maximum  time  matched  change  in  heart  rate  for  UMEC  500  mcg  compared 
with placebo was 2.1 bpm at 8 hours post dose. 
Study AC4108123: 
Study  AC4108123  was  a  randomised,  double  blind,  placebo-controlled,  double  dummy,  4-
way  crossover,  dose  ascending  study  to  assess  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacodynamics 
and  pharmacokinetics  of  single  inhaled  doses  of  GSK573719  (250,  500  and  1000  μg)  and 
tiotropium bromide (18 μg) via DPI in COPD patients.

For  maximum  and  weighted  mean  (0–4  h)  heart  rate,  treatment  differences  relative  to 
placebo  were  close  to  0  for  the  GSK573719  250  μg  and  500  μg  groups.  Increases  were 
observed for GSK573719 1000 μg, and decreases for tiotropium bromide 18 μg. For systolic 
blood pressure, the GSK573719 250 μg and 500 μg groups showed decreases in maximum 
and  weighted  mean  (0–4  h)  and  GSK573719  1000  μg  and  tiotropium  bromide  18 μg  both 
showed  increases.  Maximum  and  weighted  mean  (0–4  h)  diastolic  blood  pressure,  in 
general,  showed  decreases  relative  to  placebo,  except  for  GSK573719  1000  mcg,  where 
increases  were  seen.  Generally,  maximum  and  weighted  mean  (0–4  h)  QTcB  decreased 
relative  to  placebo  in  all  treatment  groups,  apart  from  GSK573719  500  μg,  which  showed 
increases relative to placebo. Maximum (0-4 h) QTcF showed differences to placebo close to 
0  for  all  treatment groups.  Weighted  mean  (0-4  h)  QTcF  was  close  to  0  in  the  lower  dose 
groups,  however,  a  decrease  was  seen  for  GSK573719  1000  μg  and  an  increase  for 
tiotropium.  For  maximum  heart  rate  from  Holter  monitoring  (0–24  h),  all  treatments 
showed  decreases  relative  to  placebo.  Mean  and  maximum  heart  rate  from  Holter 
monitoring  (0–24  h)  followed  similar  patterns,  but  point  estimates  were  closer  to  zero  for 
mean  heart  rate.  Clinically  significant  findings  on  Holter  ECG  were  noted  in  two  subjects 
(9%)  following  GSK573719  250  μg,  one  subject  (5%)  following  GSK573719  500  μg,  one 
subject  (8%)  following  GSK573719  1000  μg,  one  subject  (13%)  following  tiotropium 
bromide 18 μg and no subject following placebo. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Unlike the effect at the site of action (lungs) which cannot be modelled using systemic drug 
concentration as a surrogate of effect site concentration, cardiovascular effects show direct 
correlation with systemic drug concentration. Therefore, throughout clinical development of 
UMEC, heart rate (HR) was considered to be one of the most sensitive markers for systemic 
PD  response.  Concentration-QT  analysis  discussed  before  also  explored  the  concentration-
heart  rate  relationship  in  Study  DB2114635.  The  analysis  for  UMEC  indicated  no  obvious 
trends  between  UMEC  Cmax  and  change  from  baseline  in  heart  rate.  No  relationship  was 
observed  between  UMEC  plasma  concentrations  and  heart  rate  at  doses  up  to  1000  mcg 
UMEC  in  subjects  with  COPD.  Similarly,  the  relationship  between  plasma  UMEC 
concentrations and changes in QTcF was modelled. Predicted mean QTcF changes at all time 
points  were  <5  msec  and  none  of  the  95%  CIs  showed  upper  95%  CI  greater  than  10 
msec. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
PD  drug-drug  interaction  studies  with  other  drugs  that  may  be  co-administered  have  not 
been performed but inhaled umeclidinium bromide has been used concomitantly with other 
COPD medicinal products including short and long acting sympathomimetic bronchodilators 
and  inhaled  corticosteroids  without  clinical  evidence  of  drug  interactions.  This  is 
appropriately reflected in the Product Information. 
The  co-administration  of  UMEC  with  other  anticholinergic  containing  drugs  has  not  been 
studied  and  therefore  should  not  be  recommended.  As  a  PD  interaction  is  likely  to  occur, 
this  statement  has  been  included  in  section  4.5  the  SPC,  in  line  with  the  SPC  of  other 
LAMA.. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
From  the  results  of  the  PK  studies,  the  absolute  bioavailability  in  healthy  volunteers  after 
inhalation of 1000 mcg UMEC was around 13%. UMEC was rapidly absorbed with the Cmax 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 40/144 
 
  
  
values  occurring  at  approximately  5  to  15  minutes  post  dose  declining  rapidly  after 
Cmax.The  inhaled  dose  used  for  UMEC  was  near  10  times  the  proposed  therapeutic  dose. 
Despite  using  larger  doses  plasma  UMEC  concentrations  were  not  quantifiable  in  all 
subjects.  As  for  other  drugs  used  in  low  doses  by  the  inhaled  route    the  applicability  of 
these  results  to  the  lower  therapeutic  doses  cannot  be  concluded  with  certainty  but  the 
applicant  has  used  oral,  IV  and  inhaled  formulations  as  well  as  radio-labelled  drug  to 
characterise  reasonably  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  of  UMEC  in 
healthy subjects and the PK of metabolites. 
The  absolute  bioavailability  after  oral  administration  (oral  solution)  was  negligible  (<  1%) 
for UMEC (1000mcg oral dose). Under this circumstances co-administration with food is not 
be expected to significantly impact the systemic exposure, compared with the fasted state, 
at the proposed clinical doses of UMEC  and no food effect study is needed. 
Results of clinical studies in patients with relevant genetic polymorphism to CYP2D6 Plasma 
and  urine  PK  data  suggested  no  evidence  of  a  difference  in  UMEC  systemic  exposure 
between healthy volunteers and CYP2D6 PM population and therefore no dose adjustment is 
recommended in the product information. 
In vitro (HLM) UMEC was primarily metabolised by CYP2D6. CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 were also 
involved but to a lesser degree. However, considering that no evidence of a difference was 
seen in exposure of UMEC in PM versus IM/URM CYP2D6 metabolizers indicate that CYP2D6 
might be of only minor importance in the total elimination of UMEC. The need for additional 
studies to clarify major elimination pathways and enzymes/transport proteins involved has 
been captured in the risk management plan, and will be provided post-authorisation.  
The PK results show that systemic exposure is dose-proportional in the dose ranges tested. 
In terms of the time dependency of PK, the accumulation looks consistent with what would 
be expected based on the half-life. 
Study  results  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  with  moderate  hepatic 
impairment  didn’t  show  clinically  relevant  differences  in  systemic  exposure  and  no  dosage 
adjustment  is  required.  UMEC  was  not  studied  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment 
and this information is reflected in the Product information. 
The  population  PK  modelling  ascertain  the  effects  of  different  co-variates  like  age,  weight, 
gender and race and none of these co-variates has a clinically significant impact on the PK. 
Therefore no dose-adjustments are required for these variates. Overall the characterisation 
of  PK  in  relevant  special  populations  is  adequate  and  appropriate  recommendations  have 
been made based on the results. 
UMEC is relatively potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (IC50's=1.0 mcM) and is mainly metabolised 
through  CYP2D6.  However,  as  systemic  concentrations  are  low  interactions  through 
systemic  exposure  are  unlikely.  The  results  of  the  interaction  study  with  verapamil,  a 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and potent P-gp inhibitor did not show any significant effect on 
the  PK  of  UMEC,  except  for  a  40%  increase  in  AUC  of  UMEC  which  is  not  considered 
significant. Therefore no dose adjustment is recommended in patients using concomitant P-
gp transporter inhibitors. 
Umeclidinium  is  an  inhaled  LAMA  that  acts  locally  on  airways  to  produce  bronchodilation 
which mechanism of action is similar to other anticholinergics in the class. The applicant has 
submitted five studies related to therapeutic effect in both, healthy and COPD subjects and 
3 dose-ranging studies. Effective bronchodilatory activity has been demonstrated for UMEC.

The  dose  range  is  generally  adequate  to  support  the  model  that  predicts  the  response  for 
any particular dose. 
Although  no  formal  PD  interaction  studies  with  other  drugs  that  may  be  co-administered 
have  been  performed,  the  potential  for  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  is  considered 
small.  However,  the  co-administration  of  UMEC  with  other  anticholinergic  containing  drugs 
has  not  been  studied.  As  a  PD  interaction  is  likely  to  occur,  appropriate  statements  were 
included in the product information, in line with other LAMAs. 
Regarding  secondary  pharmacology,  the  effects  of  UMEC,  on  QT  interval,  blood  potassium 
levels,  heart  rate,  and  blood  pressure  have  been  assessed.  Thorough  QT  study 
(DB2114635)  was  negative  for  UMEC  500  mcg.  Along  with  the  recorded  data,  clinically 
significant effects on secondary pharmacology were not seen at the used concentrations. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme is deemed appropriate to investigate the PK and PD 
characteristics  of  UMEC  for  the  proposed  indication.  All  relevant  information  has  been 
included in the Product information.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Three  dose-finding  studies  (studies  AC4113073,  AC4115321  and  AC4113589),  all  in  COPD 
patients evaluated UMEC doses ranging from 15.6 mcg once daily to 1000 mcg once daily. 
All  of  them  used  change  in  trough  FEV1  as  the  primary  endpoint  (see  also  chapter  on 
primary pharmacology of this report).  
Across  these  studies,  doses  of  62.5  and  125  mcg  once-daily  provided  improvements  in 
trough FEV1 at or near the level offered by higher doses. The additional increase in trough 
FEV1  with  doses  above  125  mcg  was  not  considered  to  provide  sufficient  benefit  to  offset 
the increase in AEs. 
The change in trough FEV1 as compared to placebo for 62.5 is available from 2 studies and 
the range of 0.124 -0.128 L is consistent across the studies. The change in trough FEV1 as 
compared to placebo for 125 mcg is in the range of 0.147-0.183. At doses higher than 125 
mcg,  it  is  seen  that  the  response  of  trough  FEV1  increases  slightly  (one  study)  or  is 
decreased  in  comparison  to  125  mcg,  which  suggest  that  the  dose  of  125  mcg  is  at  the 
peak  of  the  dose-response  curve.  Therefore,  the  selected  doses  of  62.5mcg  and  125  mcg 
are considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The  applicant  provided  a  dose  response  model  incorporating  data  from  the  two  crossover 
studies (Study AC4113073 and Study AC4115321) showing that doses of 62.5 and 125 mcg 
produce  63%  and  77%  of  the  maximal  predicted  response  on  trough  FEV1  compared  to 
30% for the 15.6 mcg dose and 46% for the 31.25 mcg dose. The dose of 15.6 mcg (lowest 
dose tested) produced a clinically relevant and significant change of (0.113 L) as compared 
to placebo. In the dose response studies the lowest dose evaluated 15.6 mcg of UMEC also 
showed a clinically relevant effect on trough FEV1. 
Evaluation of the dosing interval:  
The  evaluation  of  once-  and  twice-daily  dosing  was  performed  in  the  Phase  IIb  studies 
AC4115321 and AC4113073. In these studies, once-daily doses of UMEC were administered 
in  the  morning  and  twice-daily  doses  were  administered  in  the  morning  and  evening, 
approximately  12  hours  apart.  To  maintain  blinding,  a  double-dummy  design  was  used 
where subjects using once-daily treatments took placebo in the evening.  
In  both  studies,  the  24-hour  serial  FEV1  response  profiles  with  once-daily  dosing  showed 
consistent  improvements  in  FEV1  relative  to  placebo  over  24  hours  and  twice-daily  dosing 
of UMEC at the same nominal dose did not provide greater benefit over once-daily dosing in 
the latter 12 hours of the dosing interval.  
Data from study AC4115321 are displayed in Figure 5 below comparing 15.6 mcg BID and 
31.25  mcg  BID  to  31.25  mcg  OD  and  62.5mcg  OD.  The  BID  regimen  for  the  clinically 
relevant dose of 31.25 mcg BID performs only marginally better especially with differences 
between  twice-daily  and  once-daily  ranging  between  +24  ml  and  +15  ml  for  the  low  and 
high  doses,  respectively.  This  is  not  considered  a  significant  difference  and  therefore  the 
once-daily administration of UMEC is considered acceptable.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
In  total  there  are  7  main  clinical  studies  with  UMEC  in  support  of  this  application  for  the 
62.5 mcg dose-strength (pre-dispensed dose of UMEC; the corresponding delivered dose is 
55 mcg). These 7 clinical studies include: 
• 
Three  placebo-controlled  studies:  one  12-week  study  (AC4115408)  and  two  24-week 
studies (DB2113361 and DB2113373). 
•  One active controlled (tiotropium) 24-week study (DB2113374). 
• 
Two supportive exercise 12-week studies (DB2114417 and DB2114418) and 
•  One  52-week  extension  study  that  provides  long-term  data  supportive  of  efficacy 
(DB2113359). 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The  subjects  included  in  the  Efficacy  Studies  were  selected  to  be  representative  of  the 
intended broad COPD patient population suitable for treatment with a LAMA. Thus, inclusion 
criteria for these studies were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
male and female subjects ≥40 years of age, 
clinical  history  of  COPD  (in  accordance  with  the  definition  of  the  American  Thoracic 
Society/European Respiratory Society [Celli, 2004]), 
a current or prior history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking (a major risk 
factor for COPD), 
airflow  limitation,  defined  by  a  measured  post-salbutamol  FEV1/forced  vital  capacity 
(FVC) ratio of <0.70, which is in accordance with the level of airflow limitation stated 
in the GOLD guidelines for COPD [GOLD, 2009; GOLD, 2010]. 
Post-salbutamol FEV1 of ≤70% of predicted normal values ensuring that all subjects 
had at least moderate airflow limitation (GOLD II), and 
a  modified  Medical  Research  Council  (mMRC)  score  ≥2  to  demonstrate  symptom 
burden. 
ICS use at a stable dose throughout the duration of the treatment period was allowed in all 
studies as long as it was started at least 30 days prior to screening. 
For  the  supportive  Exercise  Studies  (DB2114417  and  DB2114418),  the  patient  population 
differed  from  the  Efficacy  Studies  described  above  in  that  there  was  a  lower  limit  of  post-
salbutamol FEV1 of ≥ 35% predicted due to safety concerns regarding the use of exercise in 
very  severe  COPD  subjects  (<30%  FEV1  predicted)  and  an  inclusion  requirement  of 
functional  residual  capacity  (FRC)  of  ≥120%  predicted  in  order  to  ensure  patients  had 
evidence  of  hyperinflation  as  hyperinflation  is  a  significant  limitation  to  exercise  capacity. 
Unlike  for  the  Efficacy  Studies  and  the  Long-term  Safety  study,  participation  in  previous 
studies involving UMEC was not exclusionary since sufficient exposure was obtained in other 
studies and insignificant overlap was expected with the other study populations. 
For  the  Long-term  Safety  study  (DB2113359),  the  patient  population  differed  from  the 
Efficacy Studies described above in that there was a lower limit of post salbutamol FEV1 of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 45/144 
 
  
  
≥35%  predicted  due  to  safety  concerns  of  having  subjects  with  very  severe  airflow 
obstruction  on  placebo  treatment  for  52  weeks.  In  addition,  there  was  an  upper  limit  for 
post-salbutamol  FEV1  of  <80%  predicted  in  line  with  similar  studies  of  recently  approved 
LAMAs. Subjects were also not required to have an mMRC ≥2 as this was primarily a safety 
study without any symptomatic endpoints. 
Similar  exclusion  criteria  for  clinically  significant  medical  conditions  as  determined  by  the 
investigator  and  other  respiratory  conditions  including  a  current  history  of  asthma  which 
could  confound  assessment  of  efficacy  or  safety  were  applied  across  all  studies.  The 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  these  studies  were  similar  to  those  used  in  registration 
programs  for  other  LAMAs  [Center  for  Drug  Evaluation  and  Research  (CDER),  Medical 
Reviews, aclidinium bromide, 25 May 2012]. 
Key  withdrawal  criteria  in  all  studies  except  the  Long-term  Safety  study  included  COPD 
exacerbation,  as  a  recent  COPD  exacerbation  could  result  in  treatment  with  additional 
medications  that  may  affect  the  study  endpoints.  In  the  Long-term  Safety  study,  patients 
who had a COPD exacerbation were allowed to continue in the study at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
Treatments 
The treatments that were tested in each of the seven main studies are depicted in the table 
below. 
The  clinical  development  program  evaluated  2  dosage  strengths  of  UMEC  and  2  dosage 
strengths of UMEC as part of the UMEC/VI combination (i.e., 62.5/25 mcg and 125/25 mcg) 
and was designed to support registration of both UMEC monotherapy and UMEC/VI.

Objectives 
Study AC4115408 
The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  evaluate  the  safety  of  UMEC 
Inhalation Powder (62.5 mcg and 125 mcg) with placebo when administered once-daily via 
a  Novel  Dry  Powder  Inhaler  (NDPI)  over  12  weeks  for  treatment  of  subjects  with  Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 
Secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of UMEC (62.5 mcg and 125 
mcg once-daily) compared with placebo on quality of life assessments and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) evaluation over 12 weeks in subjects with COPD.

Studies DB2113361, DB2113373 and DB2113374 
The primary objective of these studies was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UMEC/VI, 
UMEC and VI once daily for 24 weeks in subjects with COPD. While studies DB2113361 and 
DB2113371 were placebo controlled studies, the study DB2113373 was an active tiotropium 
controlled study. 
The placebo controlled studies also had secondary objectives like pharmacokinetics and PK-
PD analyses 
Studies DB2114417 and DB2114418 
The primary objectives of these studies was to evaluate the effect of UMEC/VI administered 
once-daily  on  exercise  endurance  time  (EET)  measured  using  the  endurance  shuttle  walk 
test (ESWT) and trough FEV1 over 12 weeks in subjects with COPD.  
The  secondary  objectives  of  these  studies  were  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  UMEC/VI,  its 
components,  and  placebo  administered  once-daily  on  lung  volumes  and  post-dose  lung 
function over 12 weeks in subjects with COPD 
Study DB2113359 
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  UMEC/VI  125/25 
mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg  compared  with  placebo  administered  once-daily  for  52  weeks  in 
subjects with COPD 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Study AC4115408 
Trough FEV1 on Day 85 was the primary endpoint and Weighted mean (WM) FEV1 over 0 to 
6 hours postdose at Day 1, 28, and 84, as well as Serial FEV1 at 1, 3, 6, 23, and 24 hours 
post-dose at Day 1 and 84 were the two secondary endpoints. 
Other endpoints included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•

• 
• 
Trough FEV1 at other time points 
Serial FEV1 at 1, 3 and 6 hours postdose at Day 28

Trough FEV1 on day 169 was the primary endpoint and TDI focal score at Day 168 was the 
key  secondary  symptomatic  endpoint.  A  minimum  clinically  important  difference  for  these 
two  endpoints  were  pre-specified  as  an  increase  of  100  ml  and  +1  unit  TDI  score 
respectively as compared to the pre-treatment baseline. 
Other endpoints included:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
0-6h weighted mean FEV1 
Reduction in rescue salbutamol use 
St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) excluding the exercise and long-term 
safety studies 
Time to first COPD exacerbation 
Studies DB2114417 and DB2114418 
Trough  FEV1  and  Exercise  endurance  time  (EET)  as  measured  by  Exercise  endurance 
shuttle  walk  test  (ESWT)  were  the  co-primary  endpoints  for  the  exercise  studies.  An 
improvement in EET of 45-85 seconds was considered a clinically significant improvement. 
In  addition  changes  in  lung  volume  measures  like  inspiratory  capacity  (IC),  functional 
residual  capacity  (FRC)  and  residual  volume  (RV)  were  included  as  secondary  endpoints. 
The sample size was calculated in order to provide at least 90% power for the comparisons 
of  each  UMEC/VI  dose  with  placebo  for  each  of  the  co-primary  endpoints  of  Exercise 
Endurance  Time  (EET)  and  trough  FEV1.  For  the  UMEC  versus  placebo  comparison,  the 
power  was  64%  and  61%  for  EET  and  trough  FEV1,  respectively.  In  these  two-period 
incomplete  block  crossover  studies  involving  six  treatments,  there  are  30  possible 
treatment sequences, and the power is affected by the treatment sequences which are used 
and  the  number  of  subjects  who  are  randomized  to  each  treatment.  A  SAS  program  was 
used  to  simulate  data  and  calculate  the  theoretical  power  using  various  sequences  and 
numbers of subjects assigned to each. The exercise studies were designed primarily for the 
comparison  of  UMEC/VI  vs  placebo  and  the  strength  of  conclusions  for  UMEC  vs  placebo 
from  these  studies  are  much  lower.  However  as  no  claims  are  being  made  based  on  the 
results of these studies and as these studies are not considered pivotal to establish efficacy 
of UMEC, this is acceptable. 
Study DB2113359 
Long-term safety study did not have any pre-specified efficacy endpoints. However as pre-
specified  safety  endpoints  included  trough  FEV1,  rescue  medication  use  and  COPD 
exacerbations, these provide additional data supporting the long-term efficacy. 
Sample size 
The  primary  endpoint  for  the  12-week  Efficacy  Study  (AC4115408)  was  trough  FEV1,  on 
Day 85 with 0-6 hr post-dose weighted mean and serial FEV1 as secondary endpoints. The 
sample  size  for  this  study  was  calculated  in  order  to  provide  at  least  90%  power  on  the 
primary endpoint for the treatment comparison between each UMEC dose and placebo. 
The  primary  endpoint  for each  24-week  Efficacy  Study  was  trough  FEV1  on  Day  169,  with 
0-6  hr  post-dose  weighted  mean  FEV1  at  Day  168  as  a  secondary  endpoint.  In  the  24-
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014

week, placebo-controlled studies, TDI score was included as the key symptomatic endpoint 
as required for the EMA. The sample size for these placebo-controlled studies was calculated 
in order to provide at least 90% power on the primary and secondary endpoints, including 
TDI, for the five primary treatment comparisons between UMEC/VI and placebo, UMEC and 
placebo, VI and placebo, UMEC/VI and VI, and UMEC/VI and UMEC. 
The 24-week TIO study (DB2113374) evaluated UMEC 125 mcg once-daily for 24 weeks. No 
placebo  arm  was  included  in  this  study.  TIO  was  a  treatment  arm,  although  no  direct 
statistical  comparisons  between  UMEC  and  TIO  were  performed.  The  co-primary  endpoints 
in the Exercise Studies were EET at Week 12 and trough FEV1 at Week 12 and the sample 
size  was  calculated  to  provide  at  least  90%  power  on  these  two  endpoints  for  the 
comparisons between UMEC/VI and placebo. 
Randomisation 
Generally  the  randomization  code  was  generated  by  GSK  using  a  validated  computerized 
system RandALL version 2.5. Subjects were assigned to study treatment in accordance with 
the  randomization  schedule,  using  RAMOS,  an  interactive  voice  response  system  (IVRS). 
This  is  a  telephone  based  system  used  by  the  investigator  or  designee.  Once  a 
randomization  number  was  assigned  to  a  subject  it  could  not  be  reassigned  to  any  other 
subject in the study. 
The  randomization  ratio  differed  for  the  two  24-week  placebo-controlled  (3:2  actives: 
placebo)  vs.  the  12-week  placebo-controlled  and  active  comparator  (1:1  actives:  control) 
studies to allow for additional exposure to the active treatments for evaluation of safety in 
the two 24-week placebo-controlled studies. 
In the exercise endurance studies, the subjects were randomized to receive a sequence of 2 
of the 6 possible treatments. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 26 different sequences and 
the sequences were selected to optimize power for the comparisons between UMEC/VI and 
placebo.  
For  the  long-term  safety  study,  the  randomization  ratio  was  2:2:1,  again  to  ensure 
additional exposure to active treatments. 
Blinding (masking) 
All  7  main  studies  that  support  efficacy  had  a  double-blind  design.  No  problems  of 
unblinding  were  found  in  the  three  placebo-controlled  studies  [one  12-week  study 
(AC4115408)  and  two  24-week  studies  (DB2113361  and  DB2113373)]  or  in  the  active 
controlled  (tiotropium)  24-week  study  (DB2113374).  A  double-dummy  design  was  used  in 
DB2113374  because  UMEC  was  delivered  by  an  NDPI  and  the  active  comparator  was 
delivered by Handihaler. 
Statistical methods 
Studies DB2113361 and DB2113373 
These  were  24-week  randomised,  placebo-controlled  studies  with  COPD  patients 
randomised in a ratio of 3:3:3:2 to one of the following treatments:

subjects receiving each treatment (ITT poplation) was a follows: 
Statistical methods for Studies DB2113361 and DB2113373 
The  details  of  the  planned  statistical  methods  were  specified  in  the  reporting  and  analysis 
plan  (RAP)  for  the  four  main  Phase  III  studies  completed  before  the  database  freeze  and 
the unblinding of the treatment codes of all four studies.  No interim analyses were carried 
out. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the trough FEV1 on Day 169 defined as the mean of the 
FEV1  values  obtained  23  and  24  hours  after  dosing  on  Day  168  after  24  weeks  of 
treatment.    The  key secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  the  mean  TDI  focal  score  at  Week 
24 and the weighted mean FEV1 over 0 to 6 hours post dose at Week 24.  For each study a 
number of additional secondary efficacy endpoints were specified. 
The following efficacy analyses populations were defined for the primary and key secondary 
endpoints: 
• 
• 
Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  comprising  all  subjects  randomised  who  received  at 
least one dose of study medication; 
Per  protocol  (PP)  population  comprising  all  subjects  in  the  ITT  population  who  were 
not identified as full protocol deviators; the PP population was used for confirmatory 
analyses  of  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  irrespective  of  how  many 
subjects were in the PP population. 
For each test on each efficacy endpoint the null hypothesis was that there was no difference 
between treatments with the alternative hypothesis that there was a difference.   
The following treatment comparisons were performed for the primary endpoint and the two 
key secondary endpoints: 
•  UMEC/VI 
versus   
placebo; 
•  UMEC 
versus   
placebo; 
•  VI 
versus   
placebo; 
•  UMEC/VI 
versus   
VI; 
•  UMEC/VI 
versus   
UMEC.

To account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a step-down closed 
testing  procedure  was  applied  using  a  hierarchy  consisting  of  the  five  treatment 
comparisons  described  above  performed  in  that  order  on  the  primary  and  then  the 
secondary endpoints. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  analysed  for  the  ITT  population  using  a  mixed  model  repeated 
measures  (MMRM)  analysis  including  covariates  of  baseline  FEV1,  smoking  status,  day, 
centre group, treatment, day by baseline interaction and day by treatment interaction.  The 
model used all available trough FEV1 values recorded on Days 2, 28, 56, 84, 112, 168 and 
169.    Two  models  were  fitted,  one  with  a  response  variable  of  trough  FEV1  and  another 
with a response variable of change from baseline in trough FEV1.   
The  least  square  (LS)  means  from  the  model  for  change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  for 
each  treatment  on  Days  2,  28,  56,  84,  112,  168  and  169,  along  with  the  corresponding 
95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs),  were  plotted.  The  LS  mean  treatment  differences,  along 
with  the  corresponding  95%  CIs,  for  change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  on  Days  2,  28, 
56, 84, 112, 168 and 169 were also plotted for the treatment comparisons of interest. 
A  thorough  investigation  of  the  patterns  of  missing  data  was  planned.    In  addition 
sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation (MI) methods were conducted. Firstly, within 
each treatment arm a Bayesian multivariate normal model for the data (including the same 
covariates as for the primary MMRM analysis) was fitted using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
approach  and  quasi-independent  samples  drawn  from  the  posterior  distributions  for  the 
parameters  of  the  multivariate  normal  distribution  for  each  arm.  Non-informative  priors 
were  used.  This  allowed  all  missing  observations  to  be  imputed,  whether  a  subject  had  a 
monotone  or  non-monotone  pattern  of  missingness.    The  following  multiple  imputation 
methods  were  used:  the  ‘missing  at  random’  (MAR)  approach,  the  ‘copy  differences  from 
control’  (CDC)  approach  and  the  ‘last  mean  carried  forward’  (LMCF)  approach.    For  each 
imputation  dataset,  an  analysis  of  covariance  was  carried  out  using  Day  169  data,  both 
actual  and  imputed,  using  the  same  covariates  as  in  the  primary  analysis.    Contrasts  of 
interest were estimated, and then combined across imputations using standard MI rules. 
A similar MMRM analysis was carried out for the key secondary endpoint, the TDI focal score 
on  Day  168.    An  investigation  of  missing  data  and  sensitivity  analyses  similar  to  those 
carried  out  on  the  primary  endpoint  was  used.    The  second  secondary  endpoint  was 
analysed using the same overall approach. 
Study AC4115408 
This was a 12-week randomised, placebo-controlled study in COPD patients randomised in a 
ratio of 1:1:1 to one of the following treatments: 
•  UMEC 62.5mcg 
•  UMEC 125mcg, 
• 
placebo  
administered  once  daily  by  a  novel  dry  powder  inhaler.    A  total  of  69  subjects  were 
randomised to each active treatment with 68 to placebo. 
Statistical methods for Study AC4115408 
This was a Phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study that compared the 
efficacy  of  62.5  mcg  and  125  mcg  of  UMEC  to  placebo  after  12  weeks  of  treatment.  The 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 51/144 
 
  
  
primary  endpoint  was  trough  FEV1  as  Day  85.  0-6  hours  post-dose  weighted  mean  and 
serial  FEV1  were  specified  as  secondary  endpoints.  TDI  and  SGRQ  were  defined  amongst 
the other endpoints.  
The  following  treatment  comparisons  were  performed  on  trough  FEV1  on  Treatment  Day 
85:  UMEC  125  mcg  vs.  placebo  and  UMEC  62.5  mcg  vs.  placebo.  In  order  to  account  for 
multiplicity  across  treatment  comparisons  for  the  primary  endpoint,  a  step-down  closed 
testing  procedure  was  applied,  whereby  inference  for  the  comparison  of  UMEC  62.5  mcg 
with  placebo  was  dependent  on  statistical  significance  having  been  achieved  for  the 
comparison of UMEC 125 mcg with placebo. 
The primary endpoint of trough FEV1 on Day 85 was analyzed for the ITT population using a 
mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis including covariates of baseline FEV1, 
smoking  status  at  screening,  Day,  center  group,  treatment,  Day  by  baseline  interaction, 
and  Day  by  treatment  interaction,  where  Day  was  nominal.  The  model  used  all  available 
trough  FEV1  values  recorded  on  Days  2,  14,  28,  56,  84,  and  85.  Missing  data  were  not 
directly  imputed  in  this  analysis;  however,  all  non-missing  data  for  a  subject  were  used 
within the analysis to estimate the treatment effect for trough FEV1 on Day 85. 
The analysis of 0 to 6 hour weighted mean FEV1 on Days 1 and Weeks 4 , 8 and 12 used 
the same methodology as that for the primary endpoint . Serial FEV1 at 1, 3, 6, 23, and 24 
hours  after  dosing  was  analysed  using  a  repeated  measures  model,  with  pre-defined 
variables,  including  baseline  FEV1  fitted  as  covariates.  Treatment,  time  and  a  time  by 
treatment interaction term was included. This analysis was performed for Day 1 and Week 
12 separately. 
Study DB2113374 
This was a 24-week randomised active-controlled study with COPD patients randomised in a 
ratio of 1:1:1:1 to the following treatments: 
•  UMEC/VI 125/25mcg, 
•  UMEC/VI 62.5/25mcg, 
•  UMEC 125mcg 
• 
tiotropium 18mcg 
administered once daily by a novel dry powder inhaler or, in the case of tiotropium, by the 
HandiHaler.   
Statistical methods for Study DB2113374 
The  details  of  the  planned  statistical  methods  were  specified  in  the  reporting  and  analysis 
plan  (RAP)  for  the  four  main  Phase  III  studies  completed  before  the  database  freeze  and 
the unblinding of the treatment codes of all four studies.  No interim analyses were carried 
out. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the trough FEV1 on Day 169 defined as the mean of the 
FEV1  values  obtained  23  and  24  hours  after  dosing  on  Day  168  after  24  weeks  of 
treatment.  For each study a number of secondary efficacy endpoints were specified. 
For  the  efficacy  analyses,  the  ITT  and  PP  populations  were  defined  as  for  the  placebo-
controlled  studies  (DB2113361  and  DB2113373).    However  serious  GCP  problems  were 
identified at one investigator site for Study DB2113374 and so the ITT population used for 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 52/144 
 
  
  
the primary analysis excluded patients from investigator site 040688.  A sensitivity analysis 
was also conducted including these patients in the ITT population. 
For Study DB2113374 the following treatment comparisons were performed for the primary 
endpoint and the key secondary endpoint, weighted mean FEV1 over 0 to 6 hours post dose 
at Week 24: 
•  UMEC/VI 125/25mcg  versus   
tiotropium; 
•  UMEC/VI 125/25mcg  versus   
UMEC. 
A similar hierarchical procedure to that used for the placebo-controlled studies was specified 
with  the  comparisons  above  performed  for  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  following 
by the same comparisons for the same endpoints for the lower dose of the combination. 
The  statistical  methods  used  to  analyse  the  primary  endpoint  were  the  same  as  for  the 
placebo  controlled-studies  (DB2113361  and  DB2113373).    The  same  investigation  of 
missing  data  and  the  same  sensitivity  analyses  were  used  as  in  the  placebo-controlled 
studies. 
Studies DB2114417 and DB2114418 
These  were  two  Phase  III  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  combination  and 
component,  two-period  incomplete  block  design  cross-over  studies  using  UMEC  and  VI.    A 
10-12 day washout period between treatments was planned.  The objective was to evaluate 
lung  function  and  exercise  endurance  time  after  12  weeks  of  once-daily  administration  of 
the following treatments: 
•  UMEC/VI 125/25mcg (A), 
•  UMEC/VI 62.5/25mcg (B), 
•  UMEC 125mcg (C), 
•  UMEC 62.5mcg (D), 
•  VI 25mcg (E), 
• 
placebo (F), 
delivered by the novel dry powder inhaler.  In each study approximately 312 subjects with 
moderate/severe COPD were randomised in order to achieve 208 subjects completing both 
treatment periods. 
Statistical methods for Studies DB2114417 and DB2114418 
The  details  of  the  planned  statistical  methods  were  specified  in  the  reporting  and  analysis 
plan  (RAP)  for  these  two  Phase  III  studies  completed  before  the  database  freeze  and  the 
unblinding of the treatment codes of all four studies.  No interim analyses were carried out. 
Subjects were randomised to one of 26 possible treatment sequences which were selected 
to optimise power for comparisons between UMEC/VI and placebo and therefore the number 
of subjects in each treatment was unbalanced. 
Each study had two co-primary endpoints: 
• 
exercise endurance time (EET) post-dose at Week 12 defined as the EET obtained 3 
hours after dosing at Week 12; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 53/144 
 
 
  
  
• 
clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at Week 12. 
The following efficacy analyses populations were defined for the co-primary endpoints: 
• 
• 
Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  comprising  all  subjects  randomised  who  received  at 
least one dose of study medication in either treatment period; 
Per  protocol  (PP)  population  comprising  all  subjects  in  the  ITT  population  who  were 
not  identified  as  full  protocol  deviators.    In  addition  subjects  with  deviations 
considered to affect trough FEV1 or EET in one or more treatment periods had those 
periods excluded from the PP analyses. 
For each test on each efficacy endpoint the null hypothesis was that there was no difference 
between treatments with the alternative hypothesis that there was a difference.   
The following treatment comparisons were designated primary: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
post-dose EET:  
UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg   versus  placebo; 
trough FEV1: 
UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg   verses   placebo; 
post-dose EET:  
UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg  versus  placebo; 
trough FEV1: 
UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg  verses   placebo. 
These  four  treatment  comparisons,  in  this  order,  comprised  a  pre-defined  hierarchy  of 
testing in a step-down procedure in order to account for multiple testing. 
The  co-primary  endpoint  of  3-hour  post-dose  EET  at  Week  12  was  analysed  for  the  ITT 
population  using  an  MMRM  analysis,  including  covariates  of  period  walking  speed,  mean 
walking  speed,  period,  treatment,  visit,  smoking  status,  centre  group,  visit  by  period 
walking  speed  interaction,  visit  by  mean  walking  speed  interaction,  and  visit  by  treatment 
interaction. The response variable was change from baseline in 3-hour post-dose EET. 
The  co-primary  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1  at  Week  12  was  analysed  for  the  ITT  population 
using  an  MMRM  analysis,  including  covariates  of  period  baseline,  mean  baseline,  period, 
treatment, visit, smoking status, centre group, visit by period baseline interaction, and visit 
by mean baseline interaction, and visit by treatment interaction.  
The  analyses  were  repeated  for  the  PP  population  and  additional  pre-defined  sensitivity 
analyses  were  carried  out  using  the  ‘missing  at  random’  (MAR)  approach  and  the  ‘copy 
differences from control’ (CDC) approach. 
Multiplicity:  
To  account  for  multiplicity  across  treatment  comparisons  and  endpoints  in  each  study,  a 
step-down  closed  testing  procedure  was  applied  whereby  inference  for  a  test  in  the  pre-
defined  hierarchy  was  dependent  upon  statistical  significance  having  been  achieved  for 
previous tests in the hierarchy.  
In  the  12-week,  placebo-controlled  study,  the  hierarchy  consisted  of  the  comparison  of 
UMEC 125 mcg with placebo performed on the primary endpoint (trough FEV1) followed by 
the comparison of UMEC 62.5 mcg with placebo performed on the primary endpoint.  
In  the  24-week,  placebo-controlled  studies,  the  testing  hierarchy  consisted  of  the  five 
primary  treatment  comparisons  (UMEC/VI,  UMEC  and  VI  vs.  placebo,  UMEC/VI  vs.  VI  and 
UMEC/VI vs. UMEC) for the primary endpoint (trough FEV1), the same comparisons for the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 54/144 
 
 
 
  
  
key symptomatic endpoint of TDI, and the same comparisons for the secondary endpoint of 
0-6 hr weighted mean FEV1.  
In the Exercise Studies, the hierarchy consisted of the comparison of UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg 
with placebo performed on the co-primary endpoints (EET and trough FEV1) followed by the 
comparison of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg with placebo performed on the co-primary endpoints. 
These studies also included UMEC comparisons which were not included in the hierarchy. If 
all  primary  treatment  comparisons  of  UMEC/VI  vs  placebo  in  the  pre-defined  testing 
hierarchy  achieved  statistical  significance,  inference  was  drawn  from  all  other  treatment 
comparisons  on  the  co-primary  and  other  endpoints,  so  in  this  case  any  comparison  of 
UMEC vs. placebo with p<0.05 is considered statistically significant. 
If at any point in the hierarchy a comparison did not demonstrate statistical significance, all 
further  statistical  analyses  pre-specified  in  the  hierarchy  were  fully  described  but  are  not 
strictly  inferential.  If  statistical  significance  was  demonstrated  for  all  comparisons  pre-
specified  in  the  testing  hierarchy,  then  inference  is  drawn  from  all  defined  treatment 
comparisons on all other efficacy endpoints, without adjustment for multiplicity. 
For  the  studies  including  UMEC/VI  and  UMEC,  a  non-statistically  significant  result  for  a 
UMEC/VI comparison will affect inference to be drawn from subsequent UMEC comparisons. 
Data integration: 
Integration  was  performed  for  the  four  Efficacy  Studies  as  the  designs  were  very  similar. 
Two sets of integration were performed:  
• 
• 
a  12-week  integration  of  Study  AC4115408  and  the  first  12  weeks  from  Studies 
DB2113361, DB2113363 and DB2113374 (Note that the primary efficacy endpoint for 
study AC4115408 was trough FEV1 on Day 85, but this time point was not assessed 
in the 24-week studies. The trough FEV1 at Day 84, which was collected in all studies, 
has been integrated.),  
a  24-week  integration  of  Studies  DB2113361,  DB2113363  and  DB2113374.  A 
separate integration was performed for the two Exercise Studies as the designs were 
identical.  The  Efficacy  and  Exercise  Studies  were  not  integrated  together  due  to 
differences in design and patient population. 
Efficacy data from the Long-term Safety study were not integrated with the data from other 
studies as the study was of a different duration and had a different objective.  
In  addition,  a  post-hoc  Integration  was  undertaken  to  further  explore  the  efficacy  of  the 
62.5  mcg  and  125  mcg  dose  from  the  three  12-week  studies  that  included  both  doses  of 
UMEC.  This  Post-hoc  Integration  included  data  from  AC4115408  and  the  first  treatment 
period  only  of  two  Exercise  Studies  (DB2114417  and  DB2114418).  The  treatment 
comparisons performed for each endpoint in the integrated data were of each dose of UMEC 
and  placebo.  No  adjustment  for  multiplicity  was  made  in  the  integrated  analysis.  Analyses 
were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized subjects 
who received at least one dose of study medication. In individual studies, a supportive Per 
Protocol analysis was also performed and gave similar results to the ITT analysis. Individual 
study  analyses  were  defined  in  the  study  protocol  with  further  details  finalized  prior  to 
breaking the blind on the study, and all were adjusted for covariates of geographical region, 
smoking  status  and  baseline  (if  appropriate).  The  impact  of  missing  data  was  explored  in 
the  individual  studies  (AC4115408,  DB2113361,  DB2113373,  DB2113374)  using  multiple 
imputation  methods  (Missing  at  Random,  Copy  Difference  from  Control  and  Last  Mean 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014

Carried Forward) to impute data missing following withdrawal from the study. In each case, 
the  results  from  analysis  of  the  imputed  dataset  were  very  similar  to  those  from  the 
primary mixed model repeated measures analysis. 
Although  the  24-week,  placebo-controlled  studies  did  not  use  co-primary  endpoints  (as 
recommended in CHMP guidance), the level of statistical evidence provided using the closed 
testing  hierarchy  is  not  very  different.  Considering  just  treatment  comparisons  for  the 
trough  FEV1  and  TDI  endpoints,  there  are  a  total  of  five  significance  tests  (UMEC/VI  vs. 
placebo,  UMEC  vs.  placebo,  VI  vs.  placebo,  UMEC/VI  vs.  VI,  and  UMEC/VI  vs.  UMEC)  for 
each endpoint. If the endpoints were considered co-primary, all ten tests would be required 
to be statistically significant to claim a positive study and to progress to drawing inference 
on  further  endpoints.  By  having  a  single  primary  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1  and  introducing 
the hierarchy, the progression has not been changed (for regulatory agencies which include 
TDI  in  the  hierarchy,  inferences  should  not  be  drawn  on  further  endpoints  unless  all  10 
tests  are  statistically  significant),  but  a  positive  study  can  be  claimed  if  statistical 
significance is achieved only on comparisons on the trough endpoint. 
No  statistical  adjustments  of  the  FEV1  values  were  made  to  account  for  use  of  rescue 
salbutamol during the studies. The precautions were taken in the conduct of the study such 
that  a  key  lung  function  measure  could  not  be  taken  within  4  hours  of  rescue  medication 
use. This is acceptable. 
Analysis populations:  
All  integrated  analyses  for  the  12-  and  24-week  Efficacy  Studies  and  the  Exercise  Studies 
used  the  ITT  Population  from  the  individual  studies.  The  ITT  Population  is  defined  as  all 
subjects  who  were  randomized  to  treatment  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study 
medication  in  the  treatment  period.  Randomized  subjects  were  assumed  to  have  received 
study  medication  unless  definitive  evidence  to  the  contrary  existed.  Outcomes  were 
reported according to the randomized treatment allocation.

All studies were multi-centre studies conducted across many countries all over the world. All 
studies  included  study  centres  from  Europe.  Generally  the  6  month  studies  have  been 
completed in a year and the long-term study in 18 months. All these studies have begun in 
early 2011 and have been completed by mid-2012, which suggest they were well-managed 
and well-run.

There  was  one  amendment  which  clarified  the  timings  of  assessments  and  procedure,  the 
ECG inclusion and exclusion criteria and permitted medications. 
Study DB2114418 
There  was  one  amendment  which  was  essentially  in  line  with  the  above  amendment  for 
study DB2114417. 
Study DB2113359 
There  was  one  amendment  which  included  clarification  of  timepoints  for  study  visits  and 
clarification of ECG withdrawal criteria and permitted medications  
Significant deviations from GCP for investigator site 040688 were identified by GSK during 
the  conduct of  the  clinical  development  program,  which  affects  28 patients included in  the 
phase IIb study AC4115321 and 10 patients recruited into the study DB2113359 (long-term 
safety).  Sensitivity  analyses  of  efficacy  data  with  and  without  these  subjects  were 
conducted  for  Study  AC4115321.  Results  of  the  analyses  with  and  without  these  subjects 
were  generally  consistent and  are  included in  the  AC4115321  Clinical  Study Report  (CSR). 
No  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  on  the  safety  data  or  in  the  safety  study 
(DB2113359).  
Baseline data 
12-Week Integration: Demographic characteristics of subjects in the 12-Week Integration 
were  generally  similar  across  all  treatment  groups  (see  table  below).  Overall, the  majority 
of subjects were White (85%) and male (67%); the mean age was 63.2 years. Six percent 
of  the  population  were  Hispanic  or  Latino.  The  mean  BMI  of  26.58  kg/m2  indicated  that 
subjects tended to be slightly overweight.

24-Week Integration: Demographic characteristics of subjects in the 24-Week Integration 
were  generally  similar  across  all  treatment  groups  (see  table  below).  Overall, the  majority 
of  subjects  were  White  (85%)  and  male  (68%);  the  mean  age  was  63.2  years.  Seven 
percent  of  subjects  were Hispanic  or  Latino.  The  mean  BMI  of  26.53  kg/m2  indicated  that 
subjects tended to be slightly overweight.

Table 18.  Summary  of  Demographic  Characteristics  (24-Week  Integration,  ITT 
Population) 
The  study  patient  population  was  well  defined  (GOLD  combined  assessment  of  COPD 
category B or D) and predominantly (88%) included type B. The applicant clarified that the 
initial  estimate of  88%  of subjects  falling  in  to  Group  B  was  based  on  partial  data  (mMRC 
score and exacerbations). When all relevant data (including airflow limitation) was added it 
is  seen  that  58%  subjects  were  group  D  and  42%  were  Group  B.  This  suggests  that  a 
reasonable  representation  of  subjects  across  the  grade  II-IV  (GOLD  grading  based  on 
spirometry),  was  represented  in  the  study  population.  Therefore  it  is  accepted  that  the 
results are likely to be relevant to the broad COPD population.  
Exercise Integration: Overall, most subjects were White (96%) and a greater proportion 
were  male  (56%);  the  mean  age  was  62.1  years.  No  subjects  were  of  Hispanic  or  Latino 
ethnicity.  The  mean  BMI  of  26.90  kg/m2  indicated  that  subjects  tended  to  be  slightly 
overweight.

within the outcomes in the efficacy results tables below. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Study AC4115408 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  trough  FEV1  on  Day  85.  Trough  FEV1  at  Day  85  was 
defined  as  the  mean  of  the  FEV1  values  obtained  23  and  24  hours  after  dosing  on 
Treatment Day 84 (i.e., at the Week 12 Visit). Both UMEC doses demonstrated statistically 
and  clinically  relevant  (>100ml)  change  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  as  compared  with 
placebo (p<0.001). 
There  were  statistically  significant  improvements  in  LS  mean  0  to  6  hour  weighted  mean 
FEV1  for  both  the  UMEC  62.5  and  125  mcg  treatment  groups  compared  with  placebo  at 
Days 1, 28, and 84 (p<0.001).  
Statistically  significant  improvements  in  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  in  FEV1  over  time 
were also demonstrated for both the UMEC 62.5 and 125 mcg treatment groups compared 
with placebo at all serial timepoints over 24 hours on Day 1 and Day 84 (p<0.003). 
Supportive  results  for  TDI  focal  score  and  SGRQ  score  was  demonstrated.    Similarly  the 
proportion of responders according to TDI focal score was also supportive. 
Study DB2113361,  
The UMEC 125 mcg treatment group demonstrated statistically significant greater LS mean 
changes  from  baseline  in  trough  FEV1  at  Day  169  compared  with  placebo  (0.160  L,  p 
<0.001).  This  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  met  the  clinically  relevant  change  of  100ml  as 
compared to placebo. 
Clinically  meaningful  mean  improvements  in  TDI  scores  from  baseline  (i.e.,  >1; 
demonstrating  an  improvement  in  dyspnoea)  were  observed  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg 
treatment groups at Day 168. However when compared to placebo, the change in TDI score 
was  not  clinically  meaningful.  The  LS  mean  treatment  difference  between  UMEC  125mcg 
and placebo was also not statistically significant. (0.4, p =0.108) 
A  statistically  significant  greater  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  in  0  to  6  hour  weighted 
mean  FEV1  was  demonstrated  for  the  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment  group  compared  with 
placebo  at  Day  168  (0.178  L,  p<0.001).  However  in  terms  of  the  heirarachal  testing  pre-
specified, as the comparison for the key secondary endpoint (TDI) did not achieve statistical 
significance, this is not conclusive statistically.  
Analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  trough  FEV1  at  Day  169,  demonstrated  that  statistical 
significance  was  obtained  for  all  treatment  comparisons  in  the  testing  hierarchy.  For  TDI 
score  at  Day  168,  statistical  significance  was  obtained  for  the  comparison  of  UMEC/VI 
125/25 mcg with placebo, but not for UMEC 125 mcg compared with placebo. Therefore the 
statistical results for the comparison of UMEC 125 mcg with placebo on all other endpoints 
should be interpreted only descriptively 
Study DB2113373 
The UMEC 62.5 mcg treatment group demonstrated statistically significant greater LS mean 
changes  from  baseline  in  the  primary  endpoint  of  trough  FEV1  at  Day  169  compared  with 
placebo. (0.115L, p<0.001). This was also clinically relevant as it is above 100ml.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 65/144 
 
  
  
Clinically  meaningful  mean  improvements  in  TDI  scores  from  baseline  (i.e.,  >1; 
demonstrating  an  improvement  in  dyspnea)  were  observed  in  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg 
treatment  group  at  Day  168.  As  compared  to  placebo  also  the  change  in  the  UMEC  group 
was  clinically  meaningful  and  statistically  significant.  (1.0,  P<  0.001).  Statistically 
significant greater LS mean change from baseline in 0 to 6 hour weighted mean FEV1 was 
demonstrated for the UMEC 62.5 mcg treatment group compared with placebo at Day 168. 
Analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  trough  FEV1  at  Day  169,  demonstrated  that  statistical 
significance was obtained for all comparisons in the testing hierarchy. For TDI score at Day 
168,  statistical  significance  was  obtained  for  comparisons  of  UMEC/VI  62.5/25  mcg,  UMEC 
62.5 mcg, and VI 25 mcg with placebo but not for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg compared with VI 
25 mcg. Therefore, for EMA purposes the statistical results for the comparison of UMEC with 
placebo on all other endpoints should be interpreted only descriptively. 
Study DB2113374 
This  study  was  not  powered  for  formal  statistical  comparisons  of  UMEC  125  mcg  and  TIO. 
Only indirect comparisons can be made between these 2 treatment arms in this study. No 
formal statistical comparisons were performed between UMEC 125 mcg and TIO. The study 
was not powered nor designed to compare these 2 treatment arms. Results are presented 
as LS mean change from baseline for UMEC 125 mcg and TIO and are included for indirect 
within-study comparison 
The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline trough FEV1 was 0.186 L for the UMEC 
125 mcg group, and 0.149 L for the TIO group.  
The 0 to 6 hour weighted mean FEV1 at Day 168 increased from baseline with both UMEC 
125 mcg (0.206 L) and TIO (0.180L).  
The change in TDI focal score from baseline was 1.9 for UMEC 125mcg and 2.1 for 
tiotropium.  
Study DB2114417 
To account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a step-down closed 
testing procedure was applied whereby inference for a test in the predefined hierarchy was 
dependent  upon  statistical  significance  having  been  achieved  for  previous  tests  in  the 
hierarchy. The hierarchy only included treatment comparisons for the 2 UMEC/VI doses with 
placebo and comparisons for the UMEC doses with placebo were considered secondary. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were EET postdose at Week 12 and trough FEV1 at Week 
12.    The  comparison  of  UMEC/VI  125/25  mcg  against  placebo  did  not  achieve  statistical 
significance at the 5% level for the co-primary endpoint of EET at Week 12; therefore, the 
restrictions  of the  step-down  testing  procedure  were  not  met  and  the  results  of  all  further 
statistical  analyses  are  described  but  are  not  strictly  inferential.  Therefore  this  is  a  failed 
study.  
The change from baseline trough FEV1 was  0.054 L for the UMEC 62.5mcg mcg group, and 
0.108 L for the UMEC 125 mcg group.  In comparison to placebo, the difference was 0.087 
L for the UMEC 62.5mcg group and 0.108 for the UMEC 125 group. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
The difference from placebo in LS mean change from baseline in trough IC was 0.027 L for 
UMEC 62.5 mcg (p=0.587) and 0.189 L for UMEC 125 mcg (p<0.001). The differences from 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 66/144 
 
  
  
placebo in LS mean change from baseline in 3-hour postdose IC was 0.114 L for UMEC 62.5 
mcg (p=0.024) and 0.221 L for UMEC 125 mcg (p<0.001). 
The difference from placebo in LS mean change from baseline in trough FRC was -0.282 L 
for UMEC 62.5 mcg (p=0.005) and -0.261 L for UMEC 125 mcg (p=0.008). The difference 
from  placebo  in  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  in  3-hour  post  dose  FRC  was  -0.276  L  for 
UMEC 62.5 mcg (p=0.005) and -0.375 L for UMEC 125 mcg (p<0.001). 
The difference from placebo in LS mean change from baseline in trough RV was -0.376 L for 
UMEC 62.5 mcg (p<0.001) and -0.288 L for UMEC 125 mcg (p=0.006). The difference from 
placebo in LS mean change from baseline in 3 hour postdose RV changes was -0.289 L for 
UMEC 62.5 mcg (p=0.006) and -0.365 L for UMEC 125 mcg (p<0.001). 
The differences from placebo in LS mean change from baseline in 3 hour postdose FEV1 was 
0.129 L (p<0.001) for UMEC 62.5 mcg and 0.163 L for UMEC 125 mcg (p<0.001). 
Study DB2114418 
To account for multiplicity across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a step-down closed 
testing procedure was applied whereby inference for a test in the predefined hierarchy was 
dependent  upon  statistical  significance  having  been  achieved  for  previous  tests  in  the 
hierarchy.  The hierarchy only included treatment comparisons for the 2 UMEC/VI doses and 
comparisons for the UMEC doses were considered secondary. 
Statistical  significance  was  demonstrated  for  all  comparisons  in  the  testing  hierarchy,  so 
inference has been drawn for all treatment comparisons in this study. 
In DB2114418, the difference in LS mean change from baseline in the 3-hour EET post-dose 
at  week  12  as  compared  with  placebo  was  statistically  significant  for  the  UMEC  125  mcg 
treatment but not for UMEC 62.5 mcg. 
Study DB2113359 
This  study  did  not  have  any  pre-specified  efficacy  endpoints  but  the  pre-specified  safety 
endpoint  of  trough  FEV1  was  evaluated  throughout  the  52-week  treatment  period  and 
provides  additional  data  supporting  the  efficacy  of  UMEC  125  mcg.  The  UMEC  125  mcg 
group demonstrated greater LS mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 compared with 
placebo  at  6  months  (0.160  L;  CI:  0.083,  0.236)  and  12  months  (0.178  L;  CI:  0.098, 
0.258). 
In addition, greater LS mean changes from baseline in trough FEV1 were demonstrated for 
the UMEC 125 mcg group compared with placebo at all additional visits (i.e. at months 1, 3, 
and 9)

Notes   
In  order  to  account  for  multiplicity  across  treatment  comparisons  and  co-primary  endpoints,  a 
step-down  closed  testing  procedure  was  applied,  whereby  inference  for  a  test  in  the  predefined 
hierarchy  was  dependent  upon  statistical  significance  having  been  achieved  for  previous  tests  in 
the hierarchy.  The hierarchy consisted of the following 4 treatment comparisons, performed in the 
order listed: 3-h postdose EET for UMEC/VI 125/25 mcg vs. PLA; trough FEV 1 for UMEC/VI 125/25 
mcg vs. PLA; 3-h postdose EET for UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg vs. PLA; and trough FEV1 for UMEC/VI 
62.5/25  mcg  vs.  PLA.  Analyses  of  the  3-h  postdose  EET  at  Week 12  demonstrated  statistical 
significance  for  both  comparisons  in  the  testing  hierarchy.  Only  the  comparison  of  the  UMEC/VI 
62.5/25 and 125/25 mcg treatments vs. PLA were powered.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Integration  was  performed  for  the  four  Efficacy  Studies  as  the  designs  were  very  similar. 
Two sets of integration were performed: 1) a 12-week integration of Study AC4115408 and 
the  first  12  weeks  from  Studies  DB2113361,  DB2113363  and  DB2113374  (Note  that  the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint for  study  AC4115408  was  trough  FEV1  on  Day 85, but  this time 
point  was  not  assessed  in  the  24-week  studies.  The  trough  FEV1  at  Day  84,  which  was 
collected  in  all  studies,  has  been  integrated.),  2)  a  24-week  integration  of  Studies 
DB2113361, DB2113363 and DB2113374. 
Trough  FEV  -  12-Week  Integration:  For  the  integrated  analysis,  both  doses  of  UMEC 
demonstrated  statistically  significant  improvements  in  LS  mean  changes  from  baseline  in 
trough FEV1 at Day 84 compared with placebo (130 ml and 133 ml, respectively; p<0.001; 
see table below).

Integration, ITT Population) 
Trough  FEV1  -  24-Week  Integration:  For  the  integrated  analysis,  both  doses  of  UMEC 
demonstrated  statistically  significantc  improvements  in  LS  mean  changes  from  baseline  in 
trough  FEV1  at  Day  169  compared  with  placebo  (146  ml  and  125  ml,  respectively; 
p<0.001; see table below).

Integration, ITT Population). 
Temporal  pattern  of  increases  in  trough  FEV1:  For  the  24-Week  Integration  there  were 
statistically significant improvements in LS mean changes from baseline in trough FEV1 for 
both doses of UMEC compared with placebo at all visits (p<0.001; Figure E-03).

Weighted mean FEV1 0-6h post-dose - 12-week integration: Both UMEC doses (125 
mcg  and  62.5  mcg  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  LS  mean  change 
from  baseline  compared  with  placebo  (169  and  165  ml  respectively;  p<0.001  for  both 
comparisons).  The  results  were  similar  in  the  24-week  integration  (180  ml  and  163  ml; 
p<0.001 for both comparisons). 
TDI  –  24-week 
integration:  Both  doses  demonstrated  statistically  significant 
improvements in LS mean TDI focal score compared with placebo (p≤0.007). However, the 
differences  were  not  clearly  above  1-point  considered  clinically  relevant  for the  differences 
between  UME  125  and  PBO  (0.6;  0.2  to  1.00)  or  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  PBO  (0.9;  95%CI: 
0.5,1.4)  
TDI responder analysis - 24-Week Integration: The number of responders according to 
TDI focal sore for UMEC 62.5 mcg was 207/394 (53%) and for UMEC 125 mcg was 255/579 
(44%) compared with 176/494 (36%) for placebo. The odds of being a TDI responder vs. a 
non-responder were statistically significantly greater compared with placebo for both UMEC 
doses  (UMEC  125  vs  PBO:  1.6;  95%CI:  1.2,  2.2)  (UMEC  62.5  vs  PBO  Odds  Ratio  1.6; 
95%CI: 1.2, 2.2; p<0.001 for both comparisons. 
Mean  number  of  puffs  of  rescue  medication  per  day  -  24-Week  Integration: 
Statistical analysis of the integrated data demonstrated that treatment with UMEC 125 mcg 
(Diff:  -0.72;  p<0.001)  but  not  the  62.5  mcg  dose  (Diff.:  -0.29;  p=0.180),  resulted  in  a 
statistically significant reduction from baseline over Weeks 1 to 24 in the mean number of 
puffs of rescue medication per day compared with placebo. 
SGRQ – 24-week integration: The comparisons with placebo in the 24-Week Integration 
of the Efficacy Studies were also statistically significant for both UMEC doses at Day 168 (-
3.71 [95% CI -5.64, -1.77] p<0.001 for UMEC 62.5 mcg and -2.23 [95% CI -4.03, -0.43] 
p=0.015 for UMEC 125 mcg). 
SGRQ  responders:  In  the  12-Week  Integration,  the  ratio  of  the  odds  of  being  an  SGRQ 
responder vs. a nonresponder compared with placebo was 1.5 (95% CI 1.2, 2.0; p=0.002) 
for UMEC 62.5 mcg and 1.9 (95% CI1.4, 2.4 p<0.001) for UMEC 125 mcg at Day 84. In the 
24-Week Integration, the ratio of the odds of being a SGRQ responder vs. a non-responder 
compared  with  placebo  was  1.5  (95%  CI  1.1,  2.0;  p=0.010)  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  1.4 
(95% CI1.1, 1.8 p=0.021) for UMEC 125 mcg at Day 168. 
COPD exacerbations - 24-Week Integration: both doses of UMEC demonstrated a lower 
risk of COPD exacerbation compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.6 [95% CI 0.4, 0.9] and 
0.5 [95% CI 0.4, 0.8] for the UMEC 62.5 and 125 mcg doses, indicating a risk reduction of 
40% and 50%, respectively).

Subgroup Analyses 
The  results  of  subgroup  analyses  of  both  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  factors  that  included  age, 
gender,  race,  geographical  region,  treatment-naïve status,  ICS  use,  GOLD  status  (I/II  and 
III/IV),  smoking  status,  reversibility  to  salbutamol,  and  reversibility  to  salbutamol  and 
ipratropium  indicated  that  there  was  no  clinically  significant  impact  of  these  factors  on 
treatment effects.  
While  interactions  of  treatment  were  statistically  significant  for  some  of  the  subgroups  for 
trough  FEV1,  Weighted  Mean  FEV1,  and  TDI  at  either  Day  84  and/or  Day  168/169,  the 
response  to  treatment  with  both  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg  doses  were 
greater than placebo and differences in magnitude across the subgroups based on intrinsic

reversibility  groups  and  the  differences  in  the  magnitude  of  treatment  response  between 
reversibility groups were not considered clinically relevant. 
The  interactions  of  treatment  with  reversibility  to  salbutamol  and  ipratropium  were 
• 
statistically  significant  for  all  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  tested.  The  response  to 
UMEC  in  reversible  subjects  was  greater  than  that  in  non-reversible  subjects  for  all 
endpoints, but both UMEC doses were consistently better than placebo in both reversibility 
groups  and  the  differences  in  the  magnitude  of  treatment  response  between  reversibility 
groups were not considered clinically relevant. 
Severe and very severe COPD: The proportion of severe GOLD stage III subjects in the 
Efficacy  Studies  (45%;  n=  723)  and  very  severe  GOLD  stage  IV  subjects  (10%;  n  =  124; 
24-week  integration)  is  representative  of  what  is  expected  from  clinical  practice  (Jones  et 
al.  Respir  Med.  2011,  105:57-66),  and  compares  favourably  with  the  GOLD  stage  IV 
representation  in  recent  applications  (e.g.:  aclidinium  bromide;  glycopyrronium  bromide). 
In  general,  the  relative  improvements  in  lung  function  compared  with  placebo  were 
consistent with both doses of UMEC across all of the GOLD stages. In absolute term, as the 
GOLD  I-IV  staging  is  based  on  lung  function  (percentage  predicted  FEV1),  it  is  not 
unexpected  that  there  was  a  decrease  in  the  magnitude  of  the  change  from  baseline  in 
trough and 0-6 hour weighted mean FEV1 from GOLD stage II to GOLD stage IV. However, 
for  the  symptomatic  endpoint  of  TDI  focal  score  and  for  the  respiratory-related  quality  of 
life measured with SGRQ, the improvements seen in the GOLD stage IV subjects tended to 
be  comparable  to  those  seen  in  the  severe  GOLD  stage  III  subjects,  suggesting  that 
subjects with very severe GOLD stage IV also experienced a benefit with UMEC treatment in 
addition to improvements in lung function. There was variation with the TDI focal score and 
SGRQ  endpoints  at  a  few  timepoints  which  may  have  been  driven  partly  by  the  endpoints 
themselves  which  are  more  subjective  and  partly  by  the  relatively  small  numbers  of 
subjects at some timepoints. The number of subjects experiencing an exacerbation, split by 
GOLD  stage,  was  relatively  small  and  increased  from  GOLD  stage  II  to  IV.  However, 
irrespective  of  GOLD  stage,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  an  exacerbation  was  lower  in 
the  active  treatment  groups  compared  with  placebo.  There  were  no  trends  or  patterns  in 
the treatment response based on GOLD stage to suggest there was a difference in efficacy 
between UMEC 62.5 mcg and 125 mcg. 
History of cardiovascular disease at baseline:  
In  the  24-Week  Integration,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  CV  risk  factors  present  at 
screening  was  58%  in  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  group,  55%  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group,  and 
58%  in  the  placebo  group.  Conditions  that  were  included  under  the  Cardiovascular  Risk 
Factors  category  were  ‘Angina  pectoris’,  ‘Myocardial  Infarction’,  ‘Stroke’,  ‘Diabetes’, 
‘Hypertension’  and  ‘Hyperlipidemia’.  Overall  there  were  no  consistent  differences  in  the 
effect  of  UMEC  on  any  of  the  efficacy  endpoints  between  the  groups  of  subjects  with  and 
without CV risk factors at screening.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
All  studies  have  been  conducted  in  a  generally  broad  GOLD  category  Type  II  to  IV  COPD 
patient  population.  There  are  no  other  studies  in  special  populations.  Any  particular 
population  which  is  not  adequately  covered  in  this  development  is  addressed  by  suitable 
restrictions in the labelling.

Supportive studies 
There  are  no  other  studies  other  than  the  ones  mentioned  above  which  are  supportive  of 
the efficacy of UMEC alone in COPD. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  four  primary  efficacy  studies  (12-week  AC4115408  and  24-week  DB2113361, 
DB2113363  and  DB2113374)  were  all  double-blind,  randomized,  controlled  parallel  group 
studies.  Three  were  placebo  controlled  and  one  was  active  controlled  study.  The  studies 
were  all  multicentre  and  all  started  around  the  beginning  of  2011  and  were  completed  by 
mid-2012. The studies appear to be well conducted and only one study centre was detected 
a deviation from GCP resulting in unblinding. However, only 20 subjects were recruited in to 
one  primary  efficacy  study  from  this  centre  and  the  removal  of  the  20  subjects  did  not 
impact  on  the  results.  Therefore  it  is  accepted  that  this  does  not  affect  the  conclusions 
drawn from the primary efficacy studies. All the four primary efficacy studies evaluated the 
lung  function  endpoint  of  change  in  trough  FEV1  from  baseline  as  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint. The symptomatic endpoint of TDI focal score was a secondary endpoint in all the 
primary  efficacy  studies.  The  treatment  duration  in  these  studies  was  12-24  weeks.  The 
primary efficacy studies all had at least three treatment groups and there were a number of 
statistical  comparisons  planned.  Therefore,  to  avoid  multiplicity,  a  hierarchal  system  of 
statistical testing was pre-specified for each study.  
Two  exercise  studies  have  been  submitted  as  additional  evidence  of  efficacy.  These  were 
double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled, 
incomplete-block,  2-period  cross-over 
studies, where each treatment period was for 12 weeks. These studies were also conducted 
around  the  same  time  as  the  primary  efficacy  studies  and  appear  to  be  well  conducted. 
These  studies  had  co-primary  endpoints  of  change  in  exercise  endurance  time  and  trough 
FEV1. The exercise studies also had a number of parallel treatment arms in each study and 
different comparisons were planned. Therefore to avoid multiplicity, a hierarchal system of 
statistical testing was pre-specified for each study.  
In  addition  a  long-term  safety  study  which  also  collected  data  on  trough  FEV1  was 
performed  to  provide  evidence  on  maintenance  of  treatment  effects  over  the  long-term. 
This was a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study for 52 weeks.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Lung function 
The  efficacy  data  from  the  primary  efficacy  studies  indicate  that  both  doses  of  UMEC 
produce  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  as 
compared  to  placebo  (24-week  integration:  146  ml  improvement  with  UMEC  125  and  125 
ml with UMEC 62.5, respectively; p<0.001).  
Symptoms 
TDI: not always the differences versus PBO reached the minimally important difference (> 1 
unit).  In  individual  studies  statistically  and  clinically  relevant  improvements  in  TDI  focal 
score were found in study AC4115408 and in the TIO study, but not in study  DB2113361. 
In the 24-week integration, both doses demonstrated statistically significant improvements 
in  LS  mean  TDI  focal  score  compared  with  placebo  (p≤0.007).  However,  the  differences 
CHMP assessment report

were  not  clearly  above  1-point  considered  clinically  relevant  for  the  differences  between 
UMEC 125 and PBO (0.6; 0.2 to 1.00) or UMEC 62.5 mcg and PBO (0.9; 95%CI: 0.5,1.4). 
The  number  of  responders  according  to  TDI  focal  sore  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  was  207/394 
(53%)  and  for  UMEC  125  mcg  was  255/579  (44%)  compared  with  176/494  (36%)  for 
placebo.  The  odds  of  being  a  TDI  responder  vs.  a  non-responder  were  statistically 
significantly greater compared with placebo for both UMEC doses (UMEC 125 vs PBO: 1.6; 
95%CI: 1.2, 2.2) (UMEC  62.5 vs PBO Odds Ratio 1.6; 95%CI: 1.2, 2.2; p<0.001 for both 
comparisons.  These  results  are  in  line  with  the  results  obtained  for  other  LAMA  recently 
authorised in the EU (aclidinium bromide).  
SGRQ:  The  comparisons  with  placebo  in  the  24-Week  integration  of  the  Efficacy  Studies 
were  statistically  significant  for  both  UMEC  doses  for  change  in  SGRQ  at  Day  168  (-3.71 
[95%  CI  -5.64,  -1.77]  p<0.001  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  -2.23  [95%  CI  -4.03,  -0.43] 
p=0.015 for UMEC 125 mcg), but were below the 4 points considered clinically relevant. In 
the  24-Week  Integration,  the  ratio  of  the  odds  of  being  a  SGRQ  responder  vs.  a  non-
responder compared with placebo was 1.5 (95% CI 1.1, 2.0; p=0.010) for UMEC 62.5 mcg 
and 1.4 for UMEC 125 mcg (95% CI1.1, 1.8 p=0.021). Results were very similar in the 12-
week integration. These results are in line with the results obtained for other LAMA recently 
authorised in the EU (aclidinium bromide). 
Rescue medication use: Treatment with UMEC 125 mcg (Diff: -0.72; p<0.001) but not the 
62.5 mcg dose (Diff.: -0.29; p=0.180), resulted in a statistically significant reduction from 
baseline  over  Weeks  1  to  24  in  the  mean  number  of  puffs  of  rescue  medication  per  day 
compared with placebo. 
COPD exacerbations: Both doses of UMEC demonstrated a lower risk of COPD exacerbation 
compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.6 [95% CI 0.4, 0.9] and 0.5 [95% CI  0.4, 0.8] for 
the  UMEC  62.5  and  125  mcg  doses,  indicating  a  risk  reduction  of  40%  and  50%, 
respectively).  
Studies with active comparators: 
Only the 24-week study DB2113374 included an active-controlled group (TIO), but neither 
formal  statistical  comparisons  were  planned  nor  conducted  post-hoc  between  UMEC  mcg 
and TIO. In addition, only the UMEC 125 mcg dose was tested. For FEV1, the least squares 
(LS) mean change from baseline trough FEV1 was 186 ml for the UMEC 125 mcg group and 
149  ml  for  the  TIO  group.  The  weighted  mean  FEV1  0-6  h  at  Day  168  increased  from 
baseline  with  both  UMEC  125  mcg  (206  ml)  and  TIO  (180  ml). The  LS  mean  change  from 
baseline  TDI  focal  score  was  1.9  for  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group  and  2.1  for  the  TIO  group. 
COPD  exacerbation  rate  was  12%  (26  of  222  patients)  with  UMEC  125  mcg  and  7% 
(14/215)  with  TIO.  The  study  was  not  either  powered  or  designed  to  compare  these  2 
treatment arms. Therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made. 
According  to  the  EMA  COPD  guideline  (Guideline  on  the  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal 
products 
in  the  treatment  of  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  - 
EMA/CHMP/483572/2012 -corr1), “for symptomatic treatment, the most useful comparators 
are either a placebo and an active comparator or an active comparator alone depending on 
the type of drug being studied and its place in the therapeutic armamentarium.” 
No direct formal comparison of the efficacy of UMEC 62.5 mcg against tiotropium has been 
conducted. However, the DB2113374 study showed that the efficacy of UMEC 125 mcg was 
similar  to  TIO  18  mcg.  Given  the  similarity  in  the  efficacy  profile  of  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and 
UMEC  125  mcg,  the  results  of  this  study  may  be  an  indirect  estimation  of  the  expected 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 103/144 
 
  
  
effect  size  of  UMEC  62.5  mcg  in  relation  to  tiotropium.  Comparisons  with  published 
literature  also  suggest  that  the  improvements  seen  with  UMEC  62.5  mcg  in  efficacy  (e.g.: 
FEV1, SGRQ, TDI score) are similar to what has been observed in studies with other LAMAs 
(e.g.:  aclidinium  bromide,  glycopyrronium  bromide)  in  COPD  patients  [Karabis  et  al.  Int  J 
COPD. 2013;8:405-23]. 
Long-term efficacy 
Long-term effects of UMEC 125 mcg (for approximately 52-weeks) were assessed in study 
DB2113359.  The  UMEC  125  mcg  group  demonstrated  greater  LS  mean  change  from 
baseline in trough FEV1 compared with placebo at 6 months (160 ml; CI: 83 to 236) and 12 
months  (178  ml;  CI:  98  to  258).  In  addition,  greater  LS  mean  changes  from  baseline  in 
trough FEV1 were demonstrated for the UMEC 125 mcg group compared with placebo at all 
additional visits (i.e. at months 1, 3, and 9). In this long term study, analysis of time to first 
COPD exacerbation indicated that treatment with UMEC 125 mcg resulted in a lower risk of 
COPD  exacerbation  (with  marginal  significance)  compared  with  placebo  (hazard  ratio  0.6, 
[95% CI: 0.3, 1.0], risk reduction 40%). 
The study was not designed to assess the long-term effects of the UMEC 62.5 mcg dose but 
available  data  from  the  24-Week  Integration  of  the  Efficacy  Studies  suggest  that  the 
efficacy  of  UMEC  is  maintained  for  both  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  125  mcg  over  the  entire  6-
month  treatment  period  across  measures  of  lung  function,  dyspnea,  health-related  quality 
of  life,  and  COPD  exacerbation.  Given  the  similarity  in  efficacy  observed  between  the  2 
UMEC doses during the 6 month studies and the persistence of effect observed with UMEC 
125  mcg  in  the  long-term  safety  study,  it  is  expected  that  UMEC  62.5  mcg  would 
demonstrate sustained efficacy at 1 year, similar to that observed with UMEC 125 mcg. 
Efficacy by disease severity 
The  patient  population  selected  for  the  primary  efficacy  studies  included  patients  with 
moderate to very severe COPD, according to GOLD classification based on airflow limitation 
whereas  in  the  Long-term  Safety  study  (DB2113359)  patients  with  severe  COPD  were 
excluded due to safety concerns of having subjects with very severe airflow obstruction on 
placebo treatment for 52 weeks. 
Therefore  the  applicant  provided  additional  data  by  disease  severity  showing  that  the 
proportion  of  severe  GOLD  stage  III  subjects  in  the  Efficacy  Studies  (45%;  n=  723)  and 
very severe GOLD stage IV subjects (10%; n = 124; 24-week integration) is representative 
of  what  is  expected  from clinical practice  (Jones  et al.  Respir  Med.  2011, 105:57-66),  and 
compares  favourably  with  the  GOLD  stage  IV  representation  in  recent  applications  (e.g.: 
aclidinium bromide; glycopyrronium bromide). 
In  general,  the  relative  improvements  in  lung  function  compared  with  placebo  were 
consistent with both doses of UMEC across all of the GOLD stages. In absolute term, as the 
GOLD  I-IV  staging  is  based  on  lung  function  (percentage  predicted  FEV1),  it  is  not 
unexpected  that  there  was  a  decrease  in  the  magnitude  of  the  change  from  baseline  in 
trough and 0-6 hour weighted mean FEV1 from GOLD stage II to GOLD stage IV. However, 
for  the  symptomatic  endpoint  of  TDI  focal  score  and  for  the  respiratory-related  quality  of 
life measured with SGRQ, the improvements seen in the GOLD stage IV subjects tended to 
be  comparable  to  those  seen  in  the  severe  GOLD  stage  III  subjects,  suggesting  that 
subjects with very severe GOLD stage IV also experienced a benefit with UMEC treatment in 
addition to improvements in lung function. There was variation with the TDI focal score and 
SGRQ  endpoints  at  a  few  timepoints  which  may  have  been  driven  partly  by  the  endpoints 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 104/144 
 
  
  
themselves  which  are  more  subjective  and  partly  by  the  relatively  small  numbers  of 
subjects at some timepoints. 
The  number  of  subjects  experiencing  an  exacerbation,  split  by  GOLD  stage,  was  relatively 
small  and  increased  from  GOLD  stage  II  to  IV.  However,  irrespective  of  GOLD  stage,  the 
percentage  of  subjects  with  an  exacerbation  was  lower  in  the  active  treatment  groups 
compared with placebo. There were no trends or patterns in the treatment response based 
on GOLD stage to suggest there was a difference in efficacy between UMEC 62.5 mcg and 
125 mcg. 
Exercise studies 
The  results  in  the  exercise  endurance  time  of  the  first  study  (study  DB2114417)  did  not 
show  a  statistical  or  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  the  UMEC/VI  arm  as  compared  to 
placebo  (first  step  of  the  hierarchal  testing)  and  hence  this  was  a  failed  study  and  no 
inferences  can  be  drawn  from  it.  In  the  other  exercise  study  (DB2114418),  the  3-h 
postdose LS mean increase from baseline in EET (s) was 74.8 seconds for UMEC 125 mcg, 
25.1 seconds with UMEC 62.5 mcg and 0.1 seconds with placebo, which suggests a relevant 
increase in exercise endurance time with UMEC 125 mcg but not with UMEC 62.5 mcg. The 
results  of  the  two  exercise  endurance  studies,  Studies  DB2114417  and  DB2114418,  are 
very  different  in  terms  of  both  the  pattern  of  significance  and  the  size  of  the  treatment 
differences.  For example the estimated treatment difference for EET for the comparison of 
UMEC/VI  125/25mcg  and  placebo  is  approximately  32  seconds  in  the  first  study  but  66 
seconds in the second.   
In study DB2114418 as well as in study DB2113361, it is noted that the change in trough 
FEV1 from baseline in the placebo group is large (- 43 ml and -31 ml respectively), which is 
not  usually  expected  over  the  12  weeks  and  24  weeks  period  respectively.  Generally  the 
treatment effect size on trough FEV1 was large for all treatment groups in the DB2114418 
study  and  this  study  showed  a  large  difference  in  effect  size  between  UMEC  125  and  62.5 
which  was  not  seen  in  other  studies.  The  Applicant  has  explained the  inconsistency  in  the 
results of the primary efficacy endpoint in the two exercise studies based on the higher than 
anticipated  response  in  the  placebo  group  only  in  one  study.  However  despite  a  thorough 
analysis  of  the  data  and  factors  that  might  affect  the  data,  it  has  not  been  possible  to 
identify a cause for this placebo response. 
However the applicant has not made any claims on exercise tolerance in the SmPC. These 
studies  are  therefore  only  supportive  studies  and  not  considered  pivotal  for  deciding  the 
risk-benefit of this application.  The remaining studies do provide a sufficiently robust basis 
to conclude on the efficacy of UMEC. 
Dosing 
UMEC 62.5 mcg is the only dose proposed for registration by the applicant. From the Phase 
IIIa  studies,  both  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  125  mcg  were  shown  to  be  efficacious.  Although 
greater  differences  from  placebo  with  UMEC  125  mcg  compared  to  UMEC  62.5  mcg  were 
noted  in  some  studies in  the  efficacy  endpoints  related  to lung  function  and  rescue  use  at 
several  time  points,  these  differences  were  not  observed  consistently  at  each  time  point 
measured  and  tended  to  be  modest.  Confidence  intervals  for  these  endpoint  differences 
were  often  overlapping  suggesting  that  there  were  no  substantial  clinical  benefits  with  the 
UMEC  125  mcg  dose  over  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  dose.  In  the  analyses  of  subgroups  by,  for 
example,  gender,  age,  geographical  region,  GOLD  stage,  and  ICS  use,  no  subgroup 
appeared  to  benefit  to  a  greater  extent  with  125  mcg  dose  compared  with  the  62.5  mcg 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014

dose.  There  was  an  indication  that  subjects  reversible  to  salbutamol  and  reversible  to 
salbutamol followed by ipratropium achieved slightly higher trough FEV1 values with UMEC 
125 mcg than with 62.5 mcg, but the differences were generally small and not considered 
clinically relevant and were not shown consistently at every time point (i.e. not at Day 84 in 
the integrations).  
The  data  overall  suggest  that  both  doses  were  efficacious  with  no  substantial  clinically 
meaningful differentiation in efficacy between them.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results of the Phase III studies are considered to provide adequate consistent evidence 
of efficacy of both doses of UMEC versus placebo in terms of improvement of lung function 
(trough FEV1). 
Outcome measures on symptomatic improvement did not always reach a clinically relevant 
difference  versus  PBO  (e.g.:  TDI  score,  SGRQ  score)  but  are  in  general  in  line  with  the 
results  obtained  for  other  LAMA  recently  authorised  in  the  EU  (aclidinium  bromide).  Also 
acceptable consistency has been shown across patients’ subgroups. 
Although  greater  differences  from  placebo  with  UMEC  125  mcg  compared  to  UMEC  62.5 
mcg  were  noted  in  some  studies  in  the  efficacy  endpoints  related  to  lung  function  and 
rescue use at several timepoints, these differences were not observed consistently at each 
timepoint  measured  and  tended  to  be  modest.  Confidence  intervals  for  these  endpoint 
differences  were  often  overlapping  suggesting  that  there  were  no  substantial  clinical 
benefits  with  the  UMEC  125  mcg  dose  over  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  dose.  In  the  analyses  of 
subgroups by, for example, gender, age, geographical region, GOLD stage, and ICS use, no 
subgroup  appeared  to  benefit  to  a  greater  extent  from  125  mcg  dose  compared  with  the 
62.5 mcg dose.  
On  the  other  hand  a  dose-trend  in  some  adverse  events  (e.g.:  CV  adverse  events  and 
respiratory infections) could be seen (see also discussion on safety) and no authorisation of 
the higher dose was sought by the applicant.  
The  overall  documentation  of  efficacy  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  (55mcg  delivered  dose)  is 
considered to be satisfactory. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 2706 subjects with COPD were treated with at least one dose of UMEC or placebo 
in  the  8  studies  comprising  the  “All  Clinical  Studies”  grouping.  A  total  of  1663  subjects 
received  UMEC  (576  subjects  received  62.5  mcg  and  1087  subjects  received  125  mcg), 
representing  approximately  656  subject-years  of  exposure  compared  with  1124  subjects 
receiving placebo.

Table 30.  Summary of Subjects Exposure (All Clinical Studies ITT Population) 
Median exposure duration across the UMEC groups was 165 days (UMEC 62.5 mcg) and 166 
days  (UMEC  125  mcg)  compared  with  88  days  for placebo;  with  mean  days:  128  and 153 
days  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg  respectively  compared  with  122  days  in  the 
placebo  group.  The  number  of  patients  treated  for  >24  weeks  was  154  (27%)  for  UMEC 
62.5 mcg dose and 370 (34%) for UMEC 125 mcg. Exposure to study drug for >48 weeks 
was reported for 133 (12%) subjects in the UMEC 125 mcg treatment group. There were no 
data for UMEC 62.5 mcg. This exposure came from the Long-term Safety Study. 
Adverse events 
All Clinical Studies 
In the All Clinical Studies grouping, the incidence of any on-treatment AEs reported for the 
UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment  groups  was  45%  and  52%  respectively, 
compared  with  41%  for  placebo.  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  or  withdrawal 
were  reported  at  a  slightly  higher  incidence  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg  (6%) 
compared  with  placebo  (5%).  The  incidences  of  any  on-  or  post-treatment  fatal  AEs  were 
low and the same across the two UMEC treatment groups (<1%) and placebo (<1%). The 
incidence of any on-treatment SAE was slightly higher in the UMEC groups (UMEC 62.5mcg 
5%  and  UMEC  125mcg  6%)  compared  with  placebo  (4%),  and  the  incidence  of  any  drug-
related AEs was slightly higher in the UMEC 125 mcg (9%) treatment group compared with 
UMEC  62.5  mcg  (6%)  and  placebo  (6%).  An  overall  summary  of  AE  in  the  All  Clinical 
Studies grouping is provided in the below table:

Efficacy studies (AC4115408, DB2113361, DB2113373 and DB2113374) 
In the Efficacy studies, the incidence of any on-treatment AEs reported for the UMEC 62.5 
mcg and UMEC 125 mcg treatment groups was 50% and 54% respectively, compared with 
46% for placebo. AEs leading to permanent discontinuation or withdrawal were reported at 
a  slightly  higher  incidence  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  (7%)  and  UMEC  125  mcg  (6%)  compared 
with placebo (4%). The incidences of any on- or post-treatment fatal AEs were low and the 
same across the two UMEC treatment groups (<1% both groups) and placebo (<1%). The 
incidence  of  any  on-treatment  SAE  was  slightly  higher  in  both  the  UMEC  groups  (6%) 
compared  with  placebo  (4%),  and  the  incidence  of  drug-related  AEs  was  slightly  higher  in 
the  UMEC  125  mcg  (9%)  and  UMEC  62.5  mcg  (7%)  treatment  groups  compared  with 
placebo (5%).

Long-term safety study (DB2113359) 
In  the  long-term  safety  study,  at  least  one  on-treatment  AE  was  reported  by  58%  of 
subjects  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment  group  compared  with  52%  for  placebo  (Table 
below). The incidences of drug-related AEs (UMEC 125 mcg: 12%; Placebo: 13%) and on-
treatment SAEs (UMEC 125 mcg: 7%; Placebo: 6%) were similar across the two treatment 
groups.  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  or  withdrawal  were  reported  for  9%  of 
subjects in the UMEC 125 mcg treatment group compared with 12% for placebo. Four fatal 
AEs  were  reported  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment  group,  two  of  which  (<1%)  were 
classified as on-treatment; two were classified as post-treatment. One fatal AE (<1%) was 
reported in the placebo group, which was classified as post-treatment.

In  the  Exercise  Studies,  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  AEs  was  higher  on  UMEC  125  mcg 
treatment  (40%)  compared  with  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  placebo  treatment  (20%  and  33%, 
respectively,  Table  below).  The  incidences  of  drug-related  AEs  were  the  same  (4%)  for 
UMEC 125 mcg and placebo, with no drug-related events reported for UMEC 62.5 mcg. The 
incidences of AEs leading to withdrawal were slightly lower for subjects on UMEC treatment 
(2%  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  3%  for  UMEC  125  mcg)  compared  with  5%  for placebo.  The 
incidences  of  on-treatment  SAEs  were  lowest  on  UMEC  62.5  mcg  treatment  (1%)  and 
similar for UMEC 125 mcg (4%) and placebo (3%). No post-treatment SAEs were reported 
for  subjects  on  UMEC  treatments  compared  with  2  subjects  (<1%)  on  placebo.  No  drug-
related SAEs were reported for subjects on UMEC treatments or placebo. One fatal AE (1%), 
which was classified as on-treatment, was reported in the UMEC 125 mcg group.

In  the  Exercise  Studies,  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  AEs  (by  PT)  reported  by  3%  of 
subjects was similar for UMEC 125 mcg and placebo and lower for UMEC 62.5 mcg, with the 
exception  of  nasopharyngitis).  No  noteworthy  differences  in  the  incidence  of  AEs  (by  PT) 
reported by >3% of subjects for any treatments were observed between subjects on either 
UMEC  treatments  or  placebo.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  nasopharyngitis  and 
headache, with incidences across the UMEC treatments and placebo ranging from 5% to 6% 
and 1% to 5%. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
On-treatment Serious Adverse Events 
For  the  All  Clinical  Studies  group,  the  incidence  of  at  least  one  on-treatment  SAE  was 
reported for 5% and 6% of subjects for the UMEC 62.5 mcg and UMEC 125 mcg treatment 
groups respectively; compared with 4% for the placebo group. The only SAE reported by at 
least 1% of subjects in any treatment group was COPD, reported in 1% of subjects in the 
UMEC  125  mcg  and  placebo  groups  and  2%  of  subjects  in  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  treatment 
group.  The  exposure-adjusted  frequency  of  subjects  with  on-treatment  SAEs  was  143 
subjects with an event per 1000 subject-years of exposure and 134 subjects with an event 
per  1000  subject-years  in  the  in  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg  groups, 
respectively, compared with 118 subjects with an event per 1000 subject-years of exposure 
in the placebo group.  
On-treatment Drug-related Serious Adverse Events 
A  total  of  5  on-treatment  drug-related  SAEs  were  reported  among  4  subjects  receiving 
UMEC in the All Clinical Studies grouping. The incidence of on-treatment drug-related SAEs 
was  <1%  for  the  UMEC  treatment  groups  compared  with  0%  for  the  placebo  treatment 
group.  Of  the  5  SAEs  reported,  4  events  were  reported  in  the  Cardiac  Disorders  SOC:  1 
event  each  of  atrial  fibrillation,  rhythm  idioventricular  and  ventricular  extrasystoles  was 
reported  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group  and  1  event  of  tachycardia  in  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg 
group.  A  drug-related  SAE  of  chest  pain  in  the  General  Disorders  and  Administrative  site 
conditions SOC was also reported for UMEC 125 mcg. 
Adjudicated Serious Adverse Reports 
All  serious  adverse  report  narratives,  including  deaths  and  hospitalisations,  were 
adjudicated by an external independent, adjudication committee in a blinded manner for the 
Phase  IIIa  studies  in  subjects  with  COPD  treated  with  UMEC  or  placebo  for  at  least  12 
weeks. The adjudication was carried out on the case/report as a whole; thus, the case was 
adjudicated on the primary event (i.e., the event of the greatest medical significance, such 
as death, or hospitalisation, or other reason for seriousness). Fatal events were categorised 
on  pre-defined  composite  endpoints  of  respiratory,  cardiovascular,  cancer,  other  cause  of 
death,  or  unknown.  Non-fatal  events  were  categorised  to  pre-defined  composite  endpoints 
of respiratory, cardiovascular, other, or unknown. 
A summary of adjudicated serious adverse reports is presented for the following Phase IIIa 
studies or combination of studies: 
•  Efficacy Studies: AC4115408, DB2113361, DB2113373 and DB2113374 
•  Long-term Safety Study: DB2113359

Efficacy studies (AC4115408, DB2113361, DB2113373 and DB2113374) 
In  the  Efficacy  Studies,  the  respiratory  category  had  the  highest  incidence  of  non-fatal 
serious  adverse  reports:  3%  in  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  group  and  2%  in  UMEC  125  mcg  and 
placebo (Table below). In each treatment group, the most common respiratory subcategory 
was COPD exacerbation without evidence of pneumonia, which was reported at an incidence 
of  2%  and  <1%  of  subjects  in  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment  groups 
respectively, compared with 1% of subjects in placebo.

Long-term Safety Study (DB2113359) 
In  the  Long-term  Safety  Study,  the  “other”  causes  (i.e.,  not  of  a  cardiovascular  or 
respiratory nature) category had the highest incidence of non-fatal serious adverse reports: 
3%  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group  and  2%  in  the  placebo  group.  Nonfatal  serious  adverse 
reports  assigned  to  respiratory  causes  and  cardiovascular  causes  had  higher  incidences  in 
the  placebo  group  (3%  and  2%,  respectively)  than  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group  (2%  and 
1%,  respectively).  Serious  adverse  reports  that  were  categorized  to  “other  cardiovascular 
cause” had a similar incidence (<1%) across all both treatment groups.

In  the  Exercise  Studies,  the  “other”  causes  (i.e.,  not  of  a  cardiovascular  or  respiratory 
nature)  category  had  the  highest  incidence  of  non-fatal  serious  adverse  reports:  3%  on 
UMEC 125 mcg, 2% on placebo and no reports categorized with UMEC 62.5 mcg. Non-fatal 
serious adverse reports were assigned to respiratory causes in 1% of subjects in the UMEC 
62.5 mcg and placebo groups and none for UMEC 125mcg. There were no serious adverse 
reports  categorized  as  cardiovascular  in  nature  for  either  of  the  UMEC  treatment  groups, 
compared  with  <1%  for  placebo.  Two  non-fatal  serious  adverse  reports  in  the  placebo 
group (<1%) were categorised to the “other cardiovascular cause” with no reports for either 
UMEC treatment groups. No reports were categorized as respiratory in nature for UMEC 125 
mcg, compared with 1% for UMEC 62.5mcg and placebo.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
The main safety concerns with UMEC relate to the known LAMA effects. Pharmacologic class 
effects  of  LAMAs  include  cardiovascular  effects  (atrial  arrhythmias),  ocular  disorders  (e.g., 
blurred  vision),  urinary  retention,  gastrointestinal  disorders,  and  gallbladder  disorders, 
along  with  anticholinergic  effects  including  dry  mouth  and  cough.  In  addition,  pneumonia 
and  Lower  Respiratory  Tract  Infections  (LRTIs)  are  commonly  reported  in  patients  with 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 115/144 
 
 
 
  
  
COPD.  These  Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  (AESI)  were  proactively  assessed  (i.e., 
defined a priori) in the clinical development program. 
Appropriate  Standardized  MedDRA  Queries  (SMQs)  or  MedDRA  Higher  Level  Terms  (HLTs) 
were selected for AESI categorisations. When MedDRA SMQs or HLTs were not available, an 
appropriate selection of MedDRA PTs was used. 
Cardiovascular AESIand MACE 
In the clinical development program, cardiovascular safety was monitored via AE reporting 
with  categorization  and  analysis  of  AESI  including  acquired  long  QT,  cardiac  arrhythmias, 
cardiac failure, cardiac ischemia, hypertension, sudden death, and stroke subgroups. ECGs 
and  vital  signs  were  measured  in  all  patients  and  Holter  monitoring  was  performed  in  a 
predefined  subset.    In  addition,  an  analysis  of  Major  Adverse  Cardiac  Events  (MACE)  was 
performed. 
In  the  Long-Term  Safety  Study  (DB2113359),  a  higher  incidence  of  dropouts  due  to 
protocol-defined stopping criteria was reported in the UMEC 125 mcg (16%) compared with 
placebo  (7%),  particularly  for  ECG  abnormalities  (UMEC  125  mcg:  5%;  placebo:  0%)  and 
Holter abnormalities (UMEC 125 mcg: 11%; placebo: 7%). However only one of the event 
was  due  to  increase  in  QTc  >  60msec  and  none  of  the  patients  in  the  UMEC  arm  met  the 
QTc  >  450  msec,  which  was  another  criteria  for  withdrawal.  The  ECG/holter  abnormalities 
had no specific pattern and also did not have any clinically significant symptom associated 
with  the  abnormality,  and  so  this  imbalance  is  not  a  significant  concern.  In  addition,  the 
thorough  QTc  study  and  the  remaining  ECG  data  from  the  clinical  efficacy  studies  also  do 
not raise any specific concern on the QTc prolongation potential of UMEC. Therefore taking 
the overall data in to consideration it is accepted that the risk of QTc prolongation by UMEC 
is low. 
Although a higher number of subject withdrawals due to ECG and Holter abnormalities were 
noted in the UMEC 125 mcg group compared with placebo in the Long-term Safety Study, 
the  majority  of  these  withdrawals  were  associated  with  asymptomatic  cardiac  arrhythmias 
and  unlikely  to  have  led  to  more  severe  cardiovascular  events.  Appropriate  risk 
minimisation  includes  atrial  fibrillation  and  tachycardia  in  the  SmPC,  and  a  patient 
appropriate equivalent message is also included in the patient information leaflet, similar to 
other  marketed  anticholinergics.  It  is  agreed  that  UMEC  treatment  does  not  pose  a 
particular  risk  of  arrhythmias  and  therefore  it  is  agreed  to  include  a  equivalent  SPC 
information  (e.g.:  warnings  about  CV  effects)  to  that  of  other  recently  approved 
anticholinergics,  as  proposed  by  the  applicant,  which  does  not  include  the  need  for 
ECG/Holter monitoring (e.g.: aclidinium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide). 
Cardiovascular AESI 
-  In  All  Clinical  Studies    grouping,  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  cardiovascular  AESI  was 
7%  for  placebo  (209  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000-subject  years),  8%  for  UMEC  62.5 
mcg  (222  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000-subject  years)  and  10  %  for  UMEC  125  mcg 
(236 subjects with an event per 1000-subject years). 
- The incidence of post-treatment cardiovascular AESIs was <1% for both UMEC treatment 
groups adn placebo.

Table 45.  On-Treatment  Cardiovascular  Serious  AESI  Incidence  by  Special 
Interest Subgroup and Preferred Term (All Clinical Studies ITT Population) 
In the All Clinical Studies Grouping, the overall incidence of serious cardiovascular AESI was 
<1%  in  the  placebo  group  and  1%  in  both  UMEC  treatment  groups.  A  higher  incidence  of 
cardiac arrhythmias was seen in the UMEC groups (<1%) compared with placebo (0%). 
Three  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  hypertension  subgroup;  1  event  of  accelerated 
hypertension  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group  and  1  event  of  hypertension  each  in  the  UMEC 
125 mcg and placebo groups.  
Three subjects had fatal AEs in the cardiovascular special interest group; sudden death in 1 
subject  on  UMEC  62.5  mcg,  cardiac  failure  acute  in  1  subject  on  UMEC  125  mcg  and 
coronary artery insufficiency in 1 subject on placebo. 
Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) 
The broad criteria were defined a priori as follows (and the group of events meeting these 
criteria are referenced in the results as “broad-definition MACE”): 
•  Cardiac  Ischemia  Special  Interest  AE  Subgroup  (Myocardial  Infarction  SMQ  and  Other 
Ischaemic Heart Disease SMQ) excluding fatalities 
•  Stroke  Special  Interest  AE  Subgroup  (Central  Nervous  System  Haemorrhages  and 
Cerebrovascular Conditions SMQ) excluding fatalities, and 
•  Adjudicated cardiovascular deaths. 
To investigate events relating specifically to myocardial infarction rather than other cardiac 
ischaemic  events,  the  narrow  MACE  definition  included  only  the  PTs  of  “myocardial 
infarction” and “acute myocardial infarction”. The following table shows the MACE results for 
combined Efficacy Studies, Exercise Studies and Long-term Safety Study..

Table 46.  Major  Adverse  Cardiac  Events  (Efficacy  Studies  and  Exercise  Studies 
Integrations, Long-Term Safety-Study – ITT Population)  
The  following  observations  were  made  with  respect  to  each  category  of  events  within  the 
MACE definitions: 
• 
• 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  non-fatal  MI  was  similar  across  treatment  groups 
including  placebo  (<1%).  The  exposure-adjusted  frequency  of  subjects  with  non-fatal 
MI was lower for placebo (3 subjects with events per 1000 subject-years of exposure) 
than for the UMEC 62.5 mcg and UMEC 125 mcg groups (5 and 9 subjects with events 
per 1000 subject-years of exposure, respectively). 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  non-fatal  cardiac  ischemia  (from  broad-definition 
MACE)  was  the  same  across  treatment  groups  (all  1%,  including  placebo).  Exposure 
adjusted  frequencies  for  UMEC  treatment  groups  were  similar  to  or  less  than  that  for 
placebo  (40,  25,  and  38  subjects  with  events  per  1000  subject-years  of  exposure  for 
UMEC 62.5 mcg, UMEC 125 mcg and placebo respectively). 
•  Non-fatal  stroke:  The  exposure-adjusted  frequencies  for  the  UMEC  treatments  were 
less  than  that  for  placebo  (5  subjects  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg)  with 
events per 1000 subject years of exposure, compared with 11 subjects for placebo). 
Urinary retention AESI 
Pharmacologic class effects of LAMAs include urinary retention. 
In the Efficacy Studies and the All Clinical Studies grouping, 2 subjects (<1%) in the UMEC 
125 mcg group reported 3 AEs (one AE of urinary hesitation and 2 AEs of urinary retention) 
in the urinary retention AESI category. No events were reported in the UMEC 62.5 mcg or 
placebo groups. No events in this AESI group were reported for subjects in the Long-term 
Safety  Study  or  the  Exercise  Studies.  No  on-treatment  or  post-treatment  deaths  or  other 
on-treatment  SAEs  in  the  urinary  retention  AESI  group  were  reported  for  subjects  in  the 
Efficacy  Studies,  Long-term  Safety  Study,  Exercise  Studies  or  All  Clinical  Studies

groupings.Post-hoc summaries of on-treatment AESI were provided for the combined UMEC 
treatment  doses  (62.5  mcg  and  125  mcg  for  “Combined  UMEC  Doses”)  in  the  Efficacy 
Studies. The incidence of urinary retention AESI was 0% in the placebo group and <1% in 
the combined UMEC treatment groups, with 1 AE of urinary hesitation and 2 AEs of urinary 
retention reported in the combined UMEC treatment doses. 
Ocular Effects AESI 
Pharmacologic  class  effects  of  LAMAs  also  include  ocular  disorders  including  worsening 
narrow-angle glaucoma. 
The  incidence of  on-treatment  ocular  effects  AESI  in  the  Efficacy  Studies,  Exercise  Studies 
and All Clinical Study Groupings, was <1% in the UMEC 62.5 mcg and placebo groups and 
1%  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group.  In  the  Longterm  Safety  Study,  the  incidence  of  on-
treatment  ocular  effects  AESI  was  <1%  in  both  the  UMEC  125  mcg  and  placebo  groups. 
Similar  exposure-adjusted  frequencies  were  observed  in  the  Efficacy  Studies  and  Exercise 
Studies  for  UMEC  125  mcg  and  placebo,  with  lower  frequencies  observed  for  UMEC  62.5 
mcg. 
In  the  All  Clinical  Studies    grouping,  the  incidence  of  post-treatment  events  in  the  ocular 
effects  AESI  group  was  <1%  in  teh  UMEC  125mcg  treatment  group  with  no  events  in  the 
UMEC  62.5mcg  and  placebo  groups.  One  subject  (<1%)  receiving  UMEC  125  mcg  in  the 
Efficacy Studies (and All Clinical Studies Grouping) reported a post-treatment ocular effect 
AESI with a PT of cataract. 
Gallbladder Disorders AESI 
In the All Clinical Studies grouping, the incidence of on-treatment events in the gallbladder 
disorders  special  interest  group  was  <1%  in  any  treatment  group  including  placebo.  No 
clinically noteworthy dose- or treatment-related patterns were identified in either incidence 
or exposure-adjusted frequencies of on-treatment AEs in this AESI group. 
One  subject  (<1%)  receiving  UMEC  62.5  mcg  in  the  Efficacy  Studies  (and  All  Clinical 
Studies  Groupings)  reported  a  post-treatment  gallbladder  disorders  AESI  with  a  PT  of 
cholecystitis. 
Intestinal Obstruction AESI 
Pharmacologic class effects of LAMAs include effects on the gastrointestinal system such as 
reduced peristalsis and complications that may result from inhibition of gastrointestinal tract 
activity.  No  on-treatment  AEs  were  reported  in  the  intestinal  obstruction  AESI  in  either 
UMEC  dose  group  for  any  study  grouping,  nor  were  any  post-treatment  intestinal 
obstruction AESI reported for subjects randomized to UMEC or placebo 
Anticholinergic Effects AESI 
In  the  Efficacy  Studies,  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  anticholinergic  effects AESI  was  4% 
for  each  UMEC  treatment  group  and  placebo.  In  the  Long-term  Safety  Study,  both  the 
placebo  and  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment  groups  had  AESI  incidence  rates  of  2%.  In  the 
Exercise Studies, the incidence of on-treatment anticholinergic effects AESI was low (3% in 
UMEC  125  mcg  compared  with  2%  in  placebo  and  0%  in  UMEC  62.5  mcg);  the  pattern  of 
exposure-adjusted frequency was similar. In the All Clinical Studies Grouping, the incidence 
was  3%  in  both  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  placebo  groups  and  4%  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg 
group.  The  exposure  adjusted  frequencies  were  lower  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group 
compared  with  placebo  and  UMEC  62.5  mcg.  In  the  All  Clinical  Studies    grouping,  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 120/144 
 
  
  
incidence of post-treatment events in the anticholinergic effects special interest group were 
<1%  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  placebo,  and  no  AESI  in  this  special  interest  group  were 
recorded for any subjects receiving UMEC 125 mcg. 
Pneumonia and LRTI AESI 
Pneumonia  and  LRTI  are  commonly  reported  in  patients  with  COPD.  There  are  risk  factors 
for  development  of  pneumonia  independent  of  treatment  in  patients  with  COPD  including 
older  age  (especially  >65  years),  lower  %  predicted  FEV1  (especially  <30%  predicted), 
COPD  exacerbations  in  the  year  prior,  worse  MRC  dyspnoea  score  (especially  categories  4 
and  5)  and  lower  BMI  [Crim  et  al    Eur  Respir  J.  2009;34:641-7].  Although  impairment  of 
respiratory  function  does  not  in  itself  make  patients  susceptible  to  infection,  it  does 
influence  the  outcome  of  a  LRTI  [Wilson  et  al.  Eur  Respir  J.  2001;17:995-1007].  The 
pneumonia  and  LRTI  group  was  therefore  further  categorized  to  subgroups  that  describe 
pneumonia-associated  events  and  lower  respiratory  tract  infection-associated  terms 
(excluding pneumonia). 
Pneumonia 
A  summary  of  the  incidences  and  exposure-adjusted  frequencies  of  subjects  in  the 
Pneumonia AESI subgroup is presented by study grouping in the table below. 
Table 47.  On-Treatment  Pneumonia  AESI  by  Incidence  Exposure-Adjusted 
Frequency by Study Grouping (ITT Population)  
In  the  Efficacy  Studies,  a  higher  incidence  was  reported  for  the  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment 
group (1%; 38 subjects with an event per 1000 subject-years of exposure) compared with 
<1%  in  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  group  (16  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000  subject-years  of 
exposure)  and  placebo  group  (18  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000  subject-years  of 
exposure). In the Long-term Safety Study, the incidence of Pneumonia-associated AESI was 
3%  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group  (42  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000  subject-years  of 
exposure), compared with 0% in the placebo group. In the Exercise studies, the incidence 
of  Pneumonia-associated  AESI  was  1%  in  the  UMEC  62.5  mcg  group  and  0%  in  both  the 
UMEC  125  mcg  and  placebo  groups.  In  the  All  Clinical  Studies  Grouping,  the  highest 
incidence  and  exposure-adjusted  frequency  of  Pneumonia  AESI  subgroup  was  with  UMEC 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 121/144 
 
 
  
  
125  mcg  (2%;  37  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000  subject-years  of  exposure),  compared 
with  <1%  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  (20  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000  subject-years  of 
exposure) and placebo (11 subjects with an event per 1000 subject-years of exposure).  
LRTI 
In  the  Efficacy  Studies,  2%  of  subjects  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group  (46  subjects  with  an 
event  per  1000  subject-years  of  exposure)  reported  an  LRTI-associated  AESI,  compared 
with <1% in the UMEC 62.5 mcg group (22 subjects with an event per 1000 subject-years 
of  exposure)  and  placebo  group  (18  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000  subject-years  of 
exposure). In the Long-term Safety Study, the incidence of LRTI-associated AESI was 3% in 
the UMEC 125 mcg group (36 subjects with an event per 1000 subject-years of exposure) 
compared with 2% in the placebo group (25 subjects with an event per 1000 subject-years 
of exposure). In the Exercise studies, the incidence of LRTI-associated AESI was 0% in the 
UMEC treatments, compared with <1% in placebo. In the All Clinical Studies Grouping, the 
highest  incidence  and  exposure-adjusted  frequency  of  LRTI-associated  AESI  occurred  in 
subjects  treated  with  UMEC  125  mcg  (2%;  40  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000  subject-
years  of  exposure,  compared  with  <1%  for  UMEC  62.5  mcg  group  (20  subjects  with  an 
event per 1000 subject-years of exposure) and placebo (24 subjects with an event per 1000 
subject-years of exposure). 
A  summary  of  the  incidences  and  exposure-adjusted  frequencies  of  subjects  in  the  LRTI 
AESI subgroup is presented by study grouping in table below:  
Table 48.  On-Treatment  LRTI  AESI  by  Incidence  and  Exposure-Adjusted 
Frequency by Study Grouping (ITT Population) 
There  is  a  consistent  dose-trend  in  the  increase  in  risk  of  pneumonia/LRTI  with  UMEC. 
However, the events are commonly associated to COPD and the incidence of on-treatment 
serious  events  observed  in  both  UMEC  doses  is  low  is  similar  to  that  reported  with  other 
LAMAs.

Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry and hematology parameters were measured in all clinical studies. 
Based  on  the  review  of  shifts  with  respect  to  the  normal  reference  range  for  hematology 
and  clinical  chemistry  analytes,  no  trends  were  observed  suggesting  an  effect  of  UMEC  on 
the occurrence of laboratory values outside the normal range.  
Safety in special populations 
Elderly:  In  clinical  studies,  235  total  patients  were  ≥75  years,  of  which  183  received 
treatment with UMEC. There were no remarkable differences in the pattern of incidence of 
on-treatment AE, serious individual case reports, or AEs leading to drop-out across the age 
subgroupings and treatment groups. There were no remarkable differences in the pattern of 
incidence  of  on-treatment  AEs  related  to  Psychiatric  disorders,  Nervous  system  disorders, 
Accidents  and  injuries,  Vascular  disorders,  Cerebrovascular  disorders,  or  Infections  and 
infestations across the age subgroupings and treatment groups. A higher incidence of AEs in 
the Cardiac disorders SOC was noted in the older subjects (75 - <80 years, and 80 - <85 
years) in the UMEC treatment groups compared with the placebo group and compared with 
the  other  age  groups,  but  the  analyses  are  hampered  by  the  low  number  of  subjects  and 
low frequency of events. Current safety database is very limited for patients ≥75 years. The 
applicant  will  ensure  that  PASS  includes  a  sufficient  representation  of  patients  aged  ≥75 
years  to  allow  for  an  appropriate  assessment  of  relevant  adverse  events,  particularly  of 
cardio- and cerebral-vascular adverse events. 
Table 49.  Number of Elderly Patients Involved in the Specified Studies for UMEC 
COPD severity: Regarding the representation of severe/very severe COPD patients, a total 
of  362  subjects  and  149  subjects,  classified  as  GOLD  stage  III,  were  exposed  to  either 
UMEC  62.5  mcg  or  UMEC 125  mcg  for  greater than  20  weeks  and  24  weeks,  respectively. 
For  subjects  classified  as  GOLD  stage  IV,  79  subjects  and  33  subjects  were  exposed  to 
either  UMEC  62.5  mcg  or  UMEC  125  mcg  for  greater  than  20  weeks  and  24  weeks, 
respectively.  The  distribution  of  COPD  subjects  by  GOLD  staging  in  the  UMEC  studies  was 
consistent with the prevalence reported in standard practice [Jones et al, Respir Med. 2011; 
105:57-66; Mapel DW, Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis. 2011; 6:573-81]. GOLD stage IV 
patients  represented  about  9-14%  of  all  patients  included  in  umeclidinium  studies,  which 
compares  favourably  with  the  GOLD  stage  IV  representation  in  recent  applications  (e.g.: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 123/144 
 
 
 
 
  
  
aclidinium  bromide;  glycopyrronium  bromide).  Subjects  with  GOLD  stage  I  disease  were 
excluded  from  the  UMEC  Phase  III  studies,  as  maintenance  treatment  with  long-acting 
bronchodilators  is  not  recommended  for  this  patient  population  [GOLD,  Updated  2013; 
http://www.goldcopd.org].  This  is  endorsed.  An  assessment  of  the  safety  profile  (any  on-
treatment AE, SAE, or fatal SAE) of UMEC in the Efficacy Studies and the Long-term Safety 
Study  showed  no  remarkable  differences  in  the  overall  pattern  of  AEs  across  treatment 
groups  based  on  GOLD  grade.  There  was  no  dose-  or  treatment-related  patterns  in  the 
incidence of AEs in the CV AESI categories (acquired long QT, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac 
failure, cardiac ischaemia, hypertension, sudden death, and stroke) in any GOLD stage. The 
most  commonly  reported  CV  AESI  category  for  all  GOLD  stages  was  cardiac  arrhythmias 
followed by hypertension in the UMEC and placebo groups.  
Concomitant  CV  disease:  In  the  Efficacy  Studies,  58%  of  subjects  reported  at  least  one 
cardiovascular  risk  factor  (e.g.,  hypertension  [49%],  hyperlipidaemia  [27%],  or  diabetes 
[13%]);  20%  reported  a  current  cardiac  disorder  and  approximately  half  (51%)  of  the 
subjects  were  current  smokers.  In  addition,  subjects  with  a  past  medical  history  of 
myocardial infarction (5%) and stroke (3%) were included in the Efficacy Studies. Similarly, 
the majority of subjects enrolled in the UMEC 125 mcg (68%) and placebo (64%) groups in 
the Long-term Safety Study reported a concurrent cardiovascular risk factor at Screening. A 
total of 35% and 34% of subjects in the UMEC 125 mcg and placebo groups, respectively, 
presented  with  a  current  cardiac  disorder  at  Screening.  Subjects  with  a  prior  history  of 
myocardial infarction (6% in UMEC 125 mcg and 5% in the placebo group) and stroke (4% 
in  both  the  UMEC  125  mcg  and  placebo  groups)  were  included  in  the  Long-term  Safety 
Study.  
Therefore,  it  is  endorsed  that  there  was  a  sufficient  representation  of  patients  with 
concomitant  CV  disease.  That  patients  with  significant  uncontrolled  cardiovascular  disease 
were excluded from pivotal trials is reflected appropriately in the product information. 
An  analysis  of  CV  AESI  by  the  presence/absence of cardiovascular  risk  factor at  Screening 
showed some increases with UMEC versus placebo in the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, 
hypertension, and cardiac ischaemia in subjects with CV risk factors at baseline, which was 
not apparent in subjects without CV risk factors at baseline (see tables below).

treatment  CV  AESs  of  Special  Interest  Group/Subgroup  by  Cardiovascular 
Risk Factor at Screening (Efficacy Studies, ITT Population)

Table 51.  Summary  of  Incidence  and  Exposure-adjusted  Frequency  of  On-
treatment  AEs  of  Special  Interest  Group/Subgroup  by  Cardiovascular  Risk 
Factor at Screening (Long-term Safety Study, ITT Population) 
The increase was more apparent for the low UMEC dose intended for authorisation than for 
the  high  UMEC  dose.  This  can  be  at  least  partly  explained  with  the  more  severe  patient 
population  (based  on  COPD  disease  severity  and  CV  disease  at  baseline)  compared  with 
UMEC 125 mcg and placebo. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Patients  with  COPD  usually  receive  combination  therapies.  Drug-drug  interaction  studies 
with  common  drugs  used  for  treating  COPD  drug  have  not  been  performed.  Although  no 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 125/144 
 
 
 
 
  
  
formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed, inhaled umeclidinium bromide 
has been used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including short and long 
acting  sympathomimetic  bronchodilators  and  inhaled  corticosteroids  without  clinical 
evidence  of  drug  interactions.  Co-administration  of  umeclidinium  bromide  with  other  long-
acting  muscarinic  antagonists  or  medicinal  products  containing  this  agent  has  not  been 
studied  and  is  not  recommended  due  to  the  potential  for  synergistic  effects.  This 
information is appropriately labelled in accordance with other LAMA. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
For the All Clinical Studies group, the incidence of at least one on-treatment AE leading to 
permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  or  withdrawal  from  a  study  was  similar  across 
treatment  groups:  6%  for  both  UMEC  treatment  groups  and  5%  for  placebo  (as  shown  in 
Table  15,  under  the  epigraph  “Subject  disposition”.  Overall,  the  exposure-adjusted 
frequencies of subjects withdrawn were lower in the UMEC treatment groups compared with 
placebo,  which  was  mainly  at  expenses  of  a  higher  rate  of  withdrawals  due  to  lack  of 
efficacy  with  placebo.  There  were  no  significant  differences  for  withdrawals  due  to  AEs 
across all treatment groups in the overall study population.  
Table 52.  Summary of Withdrawal Study Record (Exposure Adjusted) (All Clinical 
Studies – ITT Population) 
As expected, overall withdrawal rates increased as severity of the disease increased (from 
GOLD stage II to IV), but consistently favoured UMEC groups versus placebo regardless 
disease severity. 
Post marketing experience 
At the time of submission umeclidinium bromide was not marketed in any country in the 
world. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  database  comprises  1663  subjects  that  received  UMEC  (576  subjects  received 
62.5 mcg and 1087 subjects received 125 mcg), representing approximately 656 subject-
years  of  exposure,  compared  with  1124  subjects  receiving  placebo.  Median  exposure 
duration  across  the  UMEC  groups  was  165  days  (UMEC  62.5  mcg)  and  166  days  (UMEC 
125  mcg)  compared  with  88  days  for  placebo;  with  mean  days:  128  and  153  days  for 
UMEC  62.5  mcg  and  UMEC  125  mcg  respectively  compared  with  122  days  in  the  placebo 
group. Patient exposure is in line with the minimum exposure recommendations of ICH-E1 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 126/144 
 
 
 
  
  
(e.g.: at least 300 patients treated for a minimum of 6 months, and at least 100 patients 
treated for a minimum of 1 year). 
Regarding the representation of severe/very severe COPD patients in the Efficacy Studies, 
a  total  of  362  subjects  and  149  subjects,  classified  as  GOLD  stage  III,  were  exposed  to 
either  UMEC  62.5  mcg  or  UMEC  125  mcg  for  greater  than  20  weeks  and  24  weeks, 
respectively.  For  subjects  classified  as  GOLD  stage  IV,  79  subjects  and  33  subjects  were 
exposed  to  either  UMEC  62.5  mcg  or  UMEC  125  mcg  for  greater  than  20  weeks  and  24 
weeks,  respectively.  The  distribution  of  COPD  subjects  by  GOLD  staging  in  the  UMEC 
studies  was  consistent  with  the  prevalence  reported  in  standard  practice  [Jones  et  al, 
Respir Med. 2011; 105:57-66; Mapel DW, Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis. 2011; 6:573-
81].  GOLD  stage  IV  patients  represented  about  9-14%  of  all  patients  included  in 
umeclidinium  studies,  which  compares  favourably  with  the  GOLD  stage  IV  representation 
in recent applications (e.g.: aclidinium bromide; glycopyrronium bromide). 
In  the  Efficacy  Studies,  58%  of  subjects  reported  at  least  one  cardiovascular  risk  factor 
(e.g.,  hypertension  [49%],  hyperlipidaemia  [27%],  or  diabetes  [13%]);  20%  reported  a 
current  cardiac  disorder  and  approximately  half  (51%)  of  the  subjects  were  current 
smokers.  In  addition,  subjects  with  a  past  medical  history  of  myocardial  infarction  (5%) 
and stroke (3%) were included in the Efficacy  Studies. Similarly, the majority of subjects 
enrolled in the UMEC 125 mcg (68%) and placebo (64%) groups in the Long-term Safety 
Study  reported  a  concurrent  cardiovascular  risk  factor  at  Screening.  A  total  of  35%  and 
34% of subjects in the UMEC 125 mcg and placebo groups, respectively, presented with a 
current cardiac disorder at Screening. Subjects with a prior history of myocardial infarction 
(6%  in  UMEC  125  mcg  and  5%  in  the  placebo  group)  and  stroke  (4%  in  both  the  UMEC 
125 mcg and placebo groups) were included in the Long-term Safety Study. 
A  higher  proportion  of  subjects  on  UMEC  62.5  mcg,  with  a  CV  risk  factor  at  Screening, 
reported a CV event compared with subjects on UMEC 125 mcg and placebo.  
Occasional  differences  were  observed  in  the  incidence  or  exposure-adjusted  frequency  in 
subjects  with  a  CV  risk  factor  at  Screening  in  the  cardiac  arrhythmias,  hypertension,  and 
cardiac  ischaemia  categories.  However,  few  individual  events  were  reported  across 
treatment  groups  and  the  data  showed  no  consistent  trend  in  the  events  reported  with 
either the UMEC 62.5 mcg or UMEC 125 mcg treatments in subjects with a CV risk factor 
at Screening. 
Furthermore  the  observed  numerical  differences  in  the  CV  events  reported  between  the 
treatment  groups  in  the  cardiac  arrhythmias,  cardiac  ischaemia  and  hypertension  AESI 
categories  could  be  at  least  in  part  explained  by  differences  in  baseline  characteristics. 
Overall, the UMEC 62.5 mcg treatment group had a more severe patient population (based 
on COPD disease severity and CV disease at baseline) compared with UMEC 125 mcg and 
placebo.  
In  the  All  Clinical  Studies  grouping,  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  cardiovascular  AESI 
showed a dose-trend for UMEC, being 8% for UMEC 62.5 mcg (222 subjects with an event 
per 1000-subject years), 10 % for UMEC 125 mcg (236 subjects with an event per 1000-
subject  years)  and  7%  for  placebo  (209  subjects  with  an  event  per  1000-subject  years). 
Cardiac  arrhythmias  were  the  most  frequently  reported  subgroup  of  cardiovascular  AESI, 
followed  by  hypertension  and  cardiac  ischemia  in  all  clinical  studies  (ITT  population). 
Arrhythmias 
included  supraventricular 
tachycardia  (SVT),  atrial 
fibrillation,  and 
supraventricular  extrasystoles,  as  assessed  by  AE  reports  and  ECG  and  Holter  findings, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 127/144 
 
  
  
which  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  in  the  UMEC  treatment  groups  compared  with 
placebo.  Appropriate  risk  minimisation  includes  atrial  fibrillation  and  tachycardia  in  the 
SmPC,  and  a  patient  appropriate  equivalent  message  is  also  included  in  the  patient 
information leaflet, similar to other marketed anticholinergics. 
The  ECG/holter  abnormalities  had  no  specific  pattern  and  also  did  not  have  any  clinically 
significant  symptom  associated  with  the  abnormality,  and  so  this  imbalance  is  not  a 
significant concern. In addition, the thorough QTc study and the remaining ECG data from 
the clinical efficacy studies also do not raise any specific concern on the QTc prolongation 
potential of UMEC. Therefore taking the overall data in to consideration it is accepted that 
the risk of QTc prolongation by UMEC is low. 
However  and  in  the  context  of  being  a  possible  class  effect  of  LAMAs  cardio  and 
cerebrovascular  events  were  included  as  an  important  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  As  it  is 
considered  that  UMEC  treatment,  compared  to  other  recently  approved  LAMA,  does  not 
pose  a  particular  risk  of  arrhythmias  the  product  information  outlines  the  risk  of 
cardiovascular effects in accordance with other LAMA. 
In order to assess if the presence/absence of CV risk factors at screening is a factor linked 
to the  development of  CV  adverse  events  the  applicant  will  evaluate  overall  absolute  and 
relative  risks  relating  to  cardio-  and  cerebrovascular  disorders  in  two  post  authorisation 
safety  studies  (201038  and  WWE117397)  in  patients  with  and  without  CV  risk  factor  at 
screening,  and  will  provide  with  interaction  p-values.  As  the  current  safety  database  is 
very  limited  for  patients  ≥75  years  the  applicant  will  also  ensure  sufficient  representation 
of this age group. 
The overall safety profile of UMEC was generally consistent with the known class effects of 
LAMAs  and  comorbidities  often  present  in  patients  with  COPD.  However,  although  UMEC 
belongs  to  a  well-established  and  known  class  of  molecules  (LAMA),  it  is  a  new  active 
substance and safety data from this class may not be necessarily applicable. 
In  addition  the  only  active  24-week  tiotropium  controlled  study  was  not  designed  to 
compare  the  safety  of  UMEC  and  tiotropium  and  no  direct  comparisons  with  other  LAMA 
are  available.  The  imposed  Post-Authorisation  Safety  Observational  study  and  the  DUS 
(described in the RMP) will provide further data to compare safety of these products. 
A  higher  incidence  of  pneumonia-associated  AESIs  and  LRTI  was  noted  in  the  UMEC 
treatment groups compared with placebo. In the Long-term Safety Study, the incidence of 
Pneumonia-associated  AESI  was  3%  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  group  (42  subjects  with  an 
event per 1000 subject-years of exposure), compared with 0% in the placebo group. The 
corresponding incidences for LRTI were 3% in the UMEC 125 mcg group (36 subjects with 
an event per 1000 subject-years of exposure) compared with 2% in the placebo group (25 
subjects  with  an event  per  1000  subject-years  of exposure).  These  events  are  commonly 
associated  to  COPD  and  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  serious  events  observed  in  both 
UMEC doses is low and similar to that reported with other LAMAs.  
The  magnitude  of  the  difference  is  not  enough  to  suggest  a  causal  relationship  but 
considering  the  indication  of  a  dose  trend  the  important  potential  risk  of  pneumonia  and 
LRTI  will  be  followed  up  within  the  imposed  non-interventional  PASS  as  outlined  in  the 
RMP. 
In the Long-term Safety Study, the following adverse events occurred with an incidence in 
the  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment  group  3%  higher  than  the  incidence  in  the  placebo  group:

headache,  nasopharyngitis,  cough,  supraventricular 
tachycardia,  supraventricular 
extrasystoles  and  sinus  tachycardia,  with  an  incidence  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment 
group 3% higher than the incidence in the placebo group. Rash and rhythm idioventricular 
occurred  with  an  incidence  in  UMEC  group  2%  higher  than  the  incidence  in  the  placebo 
group  with  no  events  reported  in  the  placebo  group.  These  adverse  reactions  have  been 
included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.. 
Also the current safety database is very limited for patients ≥75 years. The applicant will 
ensure that both PASS will include a sufficient representation of patients aged ≥75 years 
to  allow  for  an  appropriate  assessment  of  relevant  adverse  events,  particularly  in  the 
cardio- and cerebrovascular category. 
From  the  safety  database  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  have  been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of UMEC was generally consistent with the known class effects of 
LAMAs  and  comorbidities  often  present  in  patients  with  COPD.  However,  although  UMEC 
belongs  to  a  well-established  and  known  class  of  molecules  (LAMA),  it  is  a  new  active 
substance and safety data from this class may not be necessarily applicable.  
The  Post-Authorisation  Safety  Observational  study  (201038)  and  the  DUS  (WWE117397) 
will  complement  the  safety  profile  with  a  comparison  on  cardiovascular  safety  with  other 
LAMAs and follow up on the important potential risk of LRTI as described in the RMP.  
In  line  with  the  safety  follow  up  of  other  LAMA (aclidinium  and  glycopyrronium)  and 
LAMA/LABA  (umeclidinium/vilanterol)  further  investigation  of  the  potential  risk  of  cardio- 
and  cerebrovascular  events  is  considered  to  be  key  to  benefit  risk  and  therefore  the 
prospective non-interventional PASS (study 20103) is made a condition of the MA

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The results of the Phase III studies are considered to provide adequate consistent evidence 
of efficacy UMEC versus placebo in terms of improvement of lung function (trough FEV1). In 
terms of clinically relevant symptomatic improvement (TDI focal score, SGRQ), not always 
the  differences  versus  PBO  reached  the  minimally  important  difference  (e.g.:  TDI  score, 
SGRQ  score).  However,  in  terms  of  TDI  score  responders  and  SGRQ  responders  versus 
placebo,  the  odds  ratio  of  being  responder  was  statistically  significant  and  in  line  with  the 
results  obtained  in  comparison  with  placebo  for  other  LAMA  recently  authorised  in  the  EU 
(aclidinium bromide). UMEC 62.5 mcg (55 mcg delivered dose) demonstrated a lower risk of 
COPD exacerbation compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.6 [95% CI 0.4, 0.9] indicating a 
risk reduction of 40%. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Long-term effects of UMEC 125 mcg (for approximately 52-weeks) were assessed in study 
DB2113359. The study was not designed to study the long-term effects of UMEC 62.5 mcg 
(55  mcg  delivered  dose)  for  which  the  company  is  seeking  approval.  However,  available 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 140/144 
 
 
 
 
  
  
data at 6 months suggest that the efficacy of UMEC is maintained for both UMEC 62.5 mcg 
and  125  mcg  over  the  entire  6-month  treatment  period  across  measures  of  lung  function, 
dyspnea,  health-related  quality  of  life,  and  COPD  exacerbation.  Given  the  similarity  in 
efficacy  observed  between  the  2  UMEC  doses  during  the  6  month  studies  and  the 
persistence  of  effect  observed  with  UMEC  125  mcg  in  the  long-term  safety  study,  it  is 
expected  that  UMEC  62.5  mcg  (55  mcg  delivered  dose)  would  demonstrate  sustained 
efficacy  at  1  year,  similar  to  that  observed  with  UMEC  125  mcg  and  no  further  efficacy 
follow up is required by the CHMP. 
No  direct  comparisons  between  UMEC  62.5  mg  (55  mcg  delivered  dose)  and  TIO  or  other 
established  bronchodilators  have  been  conducted.  However,  the  DB2113374  study  showed 
that  the  efficacy  of  UMEC  125  mcg  was  similar  to  TIO  18  mcg.  Given  the  similarity  in  the 
efficacy profile of UMEC 62.5 mcg and UMEC 125 mcg, the results of this study are accepted 
as  an  indirect  estimation  of  the  expected  effect  size  of  UMEC  62.5  mcg  in  relation  to 
tiotropium. Comparisons with published literature also suggest that the improvements seen 
with UMEC 62.5 mcg in efficacy (e.g.: FEV1, SGRQ, TDI score) are similar to what has been 
observed in studies with other LAMAs (e.g.: aclidinium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide) in 
COPD  patients  [Karabis  et  al.  Int  J  COPD.  2013;8:405-23].  Therefore  extrapolation  to  the 
62.5 mcg dose is considered acceptable for the efficacy evaluation. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In  the  Long-Term  Safety  study,  the  following  adverse  events  events  occurred  with  an 
incidence  in  the  UMEC  125  mcg  treatment  group  3%  higher  than  the  incidence  in  the 
placebo  group:  headache,  nasopharyngitis,  cough,  supraventricular 
tachycardia, 
supraventricular  extrasystoles  and  sinus  tachycardiaRash  and  rhythm  idioventricular 
occurred  with  an  incidence  in  UMEC  group  2%  higher  than  the  incidence  in  the  placebo 
group  with  no  events  reported  in  the  placebo  group.  All  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in 
clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. With respect to 
risks,  common  adverse  events  were  in  line  with  the  expected  safety  profile  of  a  LAMA  in 
COPD. 
In  all  study  groupings,  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  cardiovascular  AESI  showed  a  dose-
trend  for  UMEC.  Cardiac  arrhythmias  were  the  most  frequently  reported  subgroup  of 
cardiovascular  AESI,  followed  by  hypertension  and  cardiac  ischemia  in  all  clinical  studies 
(ITT  population).  The  ECG/holter  abnormalities  had  no  specific  pattern  and  also  did  not 
have  any  clinically  significant  symptom  associated  with  the  abnormality,  and  so  this 
imbalance is not a significant concern.  
Therefore UMEC treatment is not considered to pose a particular risk of arrhythmias and the 
product  information  outlines  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  effects  in  accordance  with  other 
LAMAs. In the context of being a possible class effect of LAMAs cardio and cerebrovascular 
events were included as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be followed up with 
two post authorisation safety studies 201038 and WWE117397. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A higher incidence of pneumonia-associated AESIs and LRTI was noted in the UMEC 125mcg 
treatment groups compared with placebo. In the Long-term Safety Study, the incidence of 
Pneumonia-associated AESI was 3% in the UMEC 125 mcg group (42 subjects with an event 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 141/144 
 
 
  
  
per  1000  subject-years  of  exposure),  compared  with  0%  in  the  placebo  group.  The 
corresponding incidences for LRTI were 3% in the UMEC 125 mcg group (36 subjects with 
an event per 1000 subject-years of exposure) compared with 2% in the placebo group (25 
subjects  with  an  event  per  1000  subject-years  of  exposure).  These  events  are  commonly 
associated  to  COPD  and  the  incidence  of  on-treatment  serious  events  observed  in  both 
UMEC  doses  is  low  and  similar  to  that  reported  with  other  LAMAs.  The  magnitude  of  the 
difference is not enough to suggest a causal relationship but considering the indication of a 
dose  related  trend  in  incidence,  pneumonia  and  LRTI  will  be  followed  up  within  the  non-
interventional PASS and as important potential risk as outlined in the RMP. 
An  analysis  of  CV  AESI  by  the  presence/absence of cardiovascular  risk  factor at  Screening 
showed some increases with UMEC versus placebo in the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, 
hypertension, and cardiac ischaemia in subjects with CV risk factors at baseline, which was 
not apparent in subjects without CV risk factors at baseline. In efficacy studies, the increase 
was  much  more  apparent  for  the  low  UMEC  dose  intended  for  authorisation  than  for  the 
high  UMEC  dose.  The  warning  about  cardiovascular  effects  in  the  SmPC  has  further  been 
complemented  with  the  information  that  patients  with  clinically  significant  uncontrolled 
cardiovascular disease were excluded from the clinical studies. 
Although UMEC belongs to a well-established and known class of molecules (LAMA), it is a 
new active substance.  In  this light further investigation of the potential risk of cardio- and 
cerebrovascular  events  and  LTRI  including  pneumonia  in  comparison  to  tiotropium  is 
considered  to  be  key  to  benefit  risk  and  will  be  studied  in  an  imposed  prospective  post-
authorisation  safety  study  (Study  201038)  to  allow  for  an  appropriate  assessment  of 
relevant adverse events, particularly in the cardio- and cerebral-vascular category. 
As  the  current  safety  database  is  very  limited  for  patients  ≥75  years  the  applicant  will 
ensure that the PASS will include a sufficient representation of patients aged ≥75 years. 
Data  from  this  study  will  be  complemented  by  a  second  PASS  (Drug  utilisation  study)  as 
outlined in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
COPD  is  a  chronic,  progressive  condition  with  high  morbidity.  The  efficacy  data  from 
primary  efficacy  studies  indicate  that  UMEC  62.5  mcg  (55  mcg  delivered  dose)  produce  a 
statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in lung function as  compared to 
placebo.  With  regards to COPD  symptoms,  the  differences  versus  PBO  reached  not  always 
the  minimally  important  difference  in  the  transition  dyspnoea  score  (>  1  unit).  However, 
the responders’ analyses for TDI score were consistently in favour of UMEC vs. placebo.  
UMEC 62.5 mcg (55 mcg delivered dose) demonstrated a lower risk of COPD exacerbation 
compared  with  placebo  (hazard  ratio  0.6  [95%  CI  0.4,  0.9]  indicating  a  risk  reduction  of 
40%. These results overall are considered clinically relevant. 
Comparisons with published literature also suggest that the improvements seen with UMEC 
62.5 mcg (55 mcg delivered dose)  in efficacy (e.g.: FEV1, SGRQ, TDI score) are similar to 
what  has  been  observed  in  studies  with  other  LAMAs  (e.g.:  aclidinium  bromide, 
glycopyrronium bromide) in COPD patients [Karabis et al. Int J COPD. 2013;8:405-23]. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/175100/2014 
Page 142/144 
 
 
 
  
  
With  respect  to  unfavourable  effects,  the  nature  and  incidence  of  common  adverse  events 
are in line with the expected safety profile of a LAMA in the COPD population. UMEC is not 
considered to pose a particular risk of arrhythmias and cardiovascular side effects, overall in 
line with other LAMAs, are appropriately manageable with the approved labelling and RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
UMEC  has  shown  clinically  relevant  effects  on  lung  function  and  symptoms  in  comparison 
with  placebo  similar  to  what  has  been  observed  in  studies  with  other  LAMAs.  Common 
adverse  events  are  in  line  with  the  expected  safety  profile  of  a  LAMA  in  COPD.  It  is 
considered  that  UMEC  treatment  does  not  pose  a  particular  risk  of  arrhythmias  and  the 
potential  risks  of  cardiovascular  adverse  events  and  LRTI  including  pneumonia  can  be 
balanced  with  the  appropriate  risk  minimisation  measures  in  accordance  with  other 
approved  LAMAs  as  discussed  in  detail  above.  Further  data  to  allow  comparative  safety 
assessment to other LAMA will be generated through two post authorisation safety studies. 
Balancing  favourable  and  unfavourable  effects  and  in  accordance  with  the  companies 
proposed  posology  for  authorisation  the  risk  benefit  balance  for  the  62.5  mcg  dose 
(equivalent to 55 mcg delivered dose) once daily is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  umeclidinium  bromide  as  a  maintenance 
bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve  symptoms  in  adult  patients  with  chronic  obstructive 
pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

2.  Scientific discussion                  
2.1.  Introduction 
Basal Cell Cancer or Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is a slow-growing, locally invasive, malignant 
epidermal skin tumour predominantly affecting Caucasians.  Although it is the most common 
malignancy worldwide, it is very difficult to estimate the incidence and prevalence of BCC because 
cases typically have been designated as non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), which include both 
basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers (SCCs), and these cases, unlike melanoma, are not required 
to be reported to cancer registries. Furthermore, there is no standardized staging system for BCC. As a 
result, the epidemiology and natural history of advanced BCC have been poorly described. Estimates 
suggest an annual incidence of 234 per 100,000 for Europe1. 
Most BCCs are small and are treated by dermatologists using various surgical methods, photodynamic 
therapy, and approved topical treatments. Treatment modalities of localised disease include 
imiquimod, photodynamic therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, including Moh’s micrographic surgery, the 
latter normally reserved for high risk facial lesions2. Cure rates are generally high irrespective of 
modality if properly applied. A very small proportion of BCCs may progress to an advanced state that is 
no longer amenable to available treatments. In these cases progressive disease results in morbidity 
from local tissue invasion and destruction particularly on the face, head and neck.  These lesions 
include both locally advanced BCCs, that are either inoperable or in patients who have medical 
contraindications to surgery and for whom radiotherapy was unsuccessful or contraindicated, or very 
rarely, metastatic BCC, in whom BCC has spread to distant sites 3, 4, 5. There are no published data on 
prevalence and life expectancy for locally advanced BCC because of its absence from major registries 
and databases. Based on published data the incidence of metastatic BCC is believed to be significantly 
lower than 0.1% of cases of BCC. Radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy have been used 
to treat it. Median survival has been reported to be about 8 to 10 months.  
In the late 1990s it was shown that BCC appears to be driven by the activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) 
pathway. This gene was initially discovered in 1980 and has a role in pattern formation in limb bud and 
ventral neural tube, but also other processes in embryonal development. It is also associated with cell 
proliferation and migration, stem cell renewal and tissue regeneration and repair 6, 7.  
In short, the signalling cascade in humans is initiated in the target cell by the Hh ligand binding to the 
Patched-1 (PTCH) protein. When the Hh ligand is absent, the PTCH protein inhibits the activity of the 
protein SMO by localising it to the cell surface. When the Hh ligand binds to PTCH the inactivation of 
SMO is lost and the Hh signal is transduced to the cytoplasm. The signal is transmitted via the Glioma-
Associated Oncogene (GLI) transcription factors. The expression of GLI1 is highly dependent upon 
active Hh signaling and often used as a read-out of pathway activation8. 
There is a rare hereditary syndrome associated with aberrant Hh signalling; Gorlin syndrome, also 
known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS). Gorlin syndrome is caused by germ-line 
mutations in the PTCH1 gene. The main clinical manifestations include multiple BCCs, odontogenic 
keratocysts of the jaws, hyperkeratosis of palms and soles, skeletal abnormalities, intracranial ectopic 
calcifications, and facial dysmorphism (macrocephaly, cleft lip/palate and severe eye anomalies)9. BCC 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report

most often appear between puberty and 35 years of age, but cases have been reported in 3 or 4 year-
old patients. 
Hh signalling has also been identified as an important signalling pathway in human cancers. Mutations 
in components of the Hh pathway has been identified both in basal cell carcinoma and 
medulloblastoma, but are also implicated in the development of other cancer such as lung, breast and 
pancreas6,8.  In basal cell carcinoma a high frequency (about 90%) of inactivating mutations in PTCH1 
or to a lesser extent (about 10%) activating mutations in SMO is identified. 
Vismodegib is a small molecule inhibitor of the Hh signalling pathway, which acts by binding to 
SMO10,11. Specific mutations within SMO have been identified that alter the ability of vismodegib to 
bind and to inhibit the activity of SMO, directly linking the action of vismodegib to SMO. 
This is an application for Erivedge (vismodegib) proposed for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced basal cell carcinoma for whom surgery is inappropriate, as one 150 mg hard capsule taken 
once daily. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Erivedge is presented as hard gelatine capsules containing 150 mg of vismodegib as the active 
substance. The capsules consist of pink coloured opaque body marked “150 mg” and a grey opaque 
cap marked “VISMO” with black ink. The size of the capsule is ‘size 1’ (dimensions 19.0 x 6.6 mm). 
Excipients used in the preparation of Erivedge are well known excipients, commonly used in oral solid 
dosage forms. The capsule content is composed of microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, 
sodium lauryl sulfate, povidone, sodium starch glycolate (Type A), talc and magnesium stearate. 
Capsule shells are made of gelatine, iron oxide black (E172), iron oxide red (E172) and titanium 
dioxide (E171). The printing ink contains shellac, iron oxide black (E172) and solvents which are 
removed during imprinting. 
The capsules are packed in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles fitted with white child resistant 
polypropylene (PP) screw cap. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Vismodegib (INN) is chemically designated as 2-Chloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-4-
(methylsulfonyl)benzamide (chemical name), and has the following structure: 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 7/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vismodegib is a crystalline free base, appearing as a white to tan solid. The substance is non-
hygroscopic and achiral. It is practically insoluble in water, soluble in acetone, sparingly soluble in 
acetonitrile and slightly soluble in ethanol.  
In Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) vismodegib is classified as a Class 2 compound 
(expressing low solubility and high permeability). 
Vismodegib primarily exists as polymorph B, the most thermodynamically stable polymorph observed 
to date. Formation of the desired polymorphic form during manufacture of vismodegib is assured by 
seeding with crystals of Polymorph B and by drying to ensure low solvate and thus low residual solvent 
levels. In addition, the crystal form is confirmed by an X-ray powder diffraction analysis on the final 
active substance. Form B of vismodegib is the only form that has been used in clinical development. 
Sufficient evidence was provided to demonstrate that Form B is obtained by the employed 
manufacturing process of the active substance. 
Particle size was considered a critical quality attribute of the active substance as vismodegib is not 
dissolved in the dosage form. Therefore an appropriate test on particle size determination was included 
in the active substance specification. 
Manufacture 
A Quality by Design (QbD) approach was employed during the development. However, no design space 
has been claimed for the active substance. Consequently, the manufacturing processes of the active 
substance is expected to run in the set target values (within the approved ranges) and with traditional 
control strategy (including in-process controls). 
During development, the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance were established 
based on the potential to impact the performance and manufacturability of the finished product and 
these include impurities (organic and inorganic impurities, residual solvents, water, and metals), 
polymorph form, and particle size. Process development efforts have focused on the identification and 
control of active substance CQAs and the Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) that impact them. The 
CQAs of the active substance requiring investigation have been determined and an appropriate control 
strategy for the manufacturing process has been employed. 
The synthesis of vismodegib involves three steps which comprise formation and/or breaking of 
chemical bonds. The substance is produced from commercially available starting materials. Two 
intermediates are isolated. 
The particle size of the dried vismodegib is reduced by milling to obtain the desired particle size 
distribution. The manufacturing process has been suitably described in flow charts and a narrative 
description. The length of the synthesis was justified in terms of control of purity profile of the starting 
materials. 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report

Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their origin (raw material, manufacturing 
process and degradation products) and potential carry-over into the final active substance. Impurities 
derived from starting materials as well as process impurities formed in the manufacturing process have 
been demonstrated to be sufficiently controlled by the applied analytical methods, the specifications, 
and the manufacturing process. 
The possibility of genotoxic impurities was also addressed during the development. A scientific 
rationale that it is not necessary to monitor genotoxic impurities in vismodegib due to their reactive 
nature and the purging power of the synthesis and evidence supporting such rationale have been 
provided. Satisfactory purging data for potential genotoxic impurities has been provided.  
In general, sufficient information regarding the manufacturing process, starting materials, critical steps 
and intermediates, process validation and manufacturing process development have been provided. 
The synthesis and process parameters have been well characterised and described.  
Confirmation of the chemical structure of vismodegib was provided by elemental analysis (confirmation 
of the determined elementary composition by evaluation of C, H, N, Cl, O and S content), 
1
spectroscopic methods as UV, FITR, 
13
H-NMR, 
C-NMR as well as by mass spectral (MS) analysis XRPD 
and single crystal X ray diffraction. The IR, NMR and MS spectrum assignations were consistent with 
the declared chemical structure. 
The  potential  for  polymorphism  has  been  investigated  to  identify  polymorphic  forms  of  vismodegib. 
Many  polymorphs  of  vismodegib  were  observed  as  part  of  extensive  polymorph  screening,  however 
only  two  polymorphs  (Form  A  and  B)  have  been  observed  during  manufacturing  at  any  scale. 
Polymorph A was discovered as the initial crystalline form, but could not be reproduced. Polymorph B is 
the  thermodynamically  most  stable  polymorph  observed  to  date  and  its  formation  is  induced  by 
seeding during crystallization. Other polymorphic forms of vismodegib (Forms C and E) are also known. 
Forms C and E were observed only in the extensive polymorph screening study with a low frequency of 
occurrence.  The  crystallization  solvents  and  conditions  to  generate  Forms  C  and  E  are  drastically 
different  from  the  conditions  used  in  vismodegib  processing.  Form  B  is  the  most  thermodynamically 
stable  polymorph  discovered,  it  is  monotropically  more  stable  than  Forms  A  and  C,  and  is 
enantiotropically more stable than Form E at lower temperature. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (FTIR, HPLC and XRPD), 
assay (HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), water content (Karl Fischer), residual solvents (GC), 
particle size (Light Scattering) heavy metals and residue on ignition. 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Complete method validation data was 
provided for the non compendial (in-house) analytical methods. 
In general specification limits and analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the 
active substance.  
Batch  analysis  results  for  vismodegib  have  been  presented.  All  batches  were  manufactured  by  the 
proposed  commercial  manufacturers  according  to  the  proposed  process.  Batches  were  used  in 
preclinical and clinical studies during development, clinical scale-up, and process validation. In total 29 
batches  of  vismodegib  have  been  manufactured  during  the  development  phase.  All  batches  showed 
comparable  impurity  profile.  It  can  be  concluded  that  the  batch  analysis  results  indicate  that  the 
manufacturing process is reproducible and under control.

Stability 
Primary stability studies according to ICH guidelines have been initiated on pilot and commercial scale 
batches of the active substance stored in the commercial package. 
Primary stability program involves testing on 3 commercial scale batches placed at long term 
conditions (30°C/65 % RH) and accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH). Six months of accelerated data 
are available for all batches and up to 24 months of data have been reported for the 30°C/65% RH 
condition. The batches are monitored for appearance, water content, assay, and impurities and 
physical form. All results reported are within proposed specifications. No trends are seen in the primary 
and supportive studies. 
The active substance has also been subjected to forced degradation with regards to acid, base, 
peroxide (oxidant), heat, humidity, and light stress conditions. Vismodegib is stable under light, heat, 
and humidity, with some degradation observed under acidic and basic stress conditions. Degradation 
was also observed when vismodegib was exposed to oxidative reagent (H2O2) for a longer period. In 
the photostability study the appearance of the substance was changed from white to light orange, no 
changes were seen for the other parameters. 
The  results  of  the  forced-degradation  study  and  of  the  long-term  and  accelerated  primary  stability 
studies,  as  presented  in  the  dossier,  show  that  vismodegib  is  chemically  and  physically  stable  under 
stress conditions. 
Based on the available stability data, vismodegib showed to be a stable when packaged in the 
proposed container closure system. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain a solid, oral dosage form that would deliver 
the required dose of the active substance. 
The development of the capsule formulation and manufacturing process was based on prior knowledge. 
It followed a classic development approach and adopted elements of QbD and risk-based methodology. 
An in-depth understanding of the effects of formula components, process intermediates and process 
parameters was obtained from design of experiment studies (DoEs), scale-up studies and analysis of 
batches manufactured for clinical studies. Based on these studies, appropriate control strategy has 
been implemented to mitigate the risks identified initially and to ensure that the characteristics 
specified in the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) will be met consistently. However, no design 
space has been claimed for the finished product. Consequently, the manufacturing processes of the 
finished product is expected to run in the set target values (within the approved ranges) and with 
traditional control strategy (including in-process controls). 
During the development of the finished product risk assessment was performed with regards to 
formulation and manufacturing development to establish the critical quality attributes (CQA) and 
critical process parameters (CPP). The approach and the conclusions (in terms of CQA and CPP) were 
considered acceptable. The proposed process description is adequately detailed and includes all 
parameters that are needed to be monitored or controlled during the process to ensure the intended 
quality of the finished product. 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 10/99 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase I clinical trial was conducted on a dry blend capsule formulation with 25 mg, 125 mg, and 
270 mg of vismodegib whereas Phase II clinical trials was conducted on an earlier wet granulation 
capsule formulation of 150 mg. The same 150 mg hard capsule formulation as developed for the 
clinical studies will also be used for the commercial capsule.  
In the risk assessment performed prior to the development of the wet granulated formulation focus 
was set on compendial capsule dosage form parameters (dissolution, content uniformity (UoC) and 
stability), active substance physical characteristics and the excipients sodium lauryl sulfate and 
magnesium stearate, since the drug substance was considered to be a BCS Class 2 compound. Factors 
not considered to be critical or having a significant effect were e.g. water content, stability of drug 
substance (stable), polymorphic form (since it was established that the B form was achieved in the 
manufacturing and it is thermodynamically stable) and level of disintegrant since the microcrystalline 
cellulose filler also act as disintegrant. The primary goal of the initial risk assessment was to prioritize 
optimization studies, where high risk factors were prioritized; factors that were assigned an uncertain 
effect were subject to further data collection and evaluation and low risk factors monitored and studied 
selectively. 
A final risk assessment was conducted based on the knowledge gained from the development studies. 
Initial  potential  risks  were  reviewed  and  reduced  due  to  proposed  process  parameter  settings  and 
control measures in place. 
The manufacturing process development has been well documented. A wet-granulation process was 
selected after experimentally comparing it with a direct blending and a dry granulation process. The 
study showed that the high shear wet-granulation process produced granules with the best flow quality. 
Additionally, the granule particle size produced by high shear wet granulation was significantly smaller 
than that produced by the roller compaction process, which reduced capsule weight variation during 
encapsulation. The selection of the wet-granulation process also took into consideration the high 
process robustness, the availability of equipment at varying scales, and the stability of the active 
substance against heat and moisture. Choice of the process was considered justified and the critical 
process parameters and process equipment were generally satisfactorily identified. It has been shown 
that the manufacturing process was robust. 
It can be concluded that the formulation development of the product was satisfactorily described. The 
key critical parameters were identified and successfully evaluated.  
Adventitious agents 
Among excipients used in the medicinal product gelatine (component of the capsule shell) and lactose 
(component of the capsule fill) are of animal origin. 
Ph. Eur. TSE Certificates of Suitability were provided for gelatine. 
It has been certified by the supplier that lactose is produced in compliance with the Note for Guidance 
on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform  Encephalopathy  Agents  via  Human  and 
Veterinary  Medicinal  Products”  (EMEA/410/01).  Lactose  is  produced  from  milk  obtained  from  healthy 
cattle under the same conditions as milk intended for human consumption. 
Magnesium stearate is of vegetal origin and relevant certificates from manufacturers of this excipient 
have been provided.

Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is sufficiently described as well as a process flow diagram provided. The 
hard capsules are manufactured by a standard process comprising wet granulation in high-shear 
granulator where the active substance, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, sodium lauryl 
sulfate, and part of sodium starch glycollate is granulated with the granulation solution consisting of 
povidone and purified water. The granules are dried in a fluid-bed, milled and mixed with sodium 
starch glycollate and talc followed by mixing with magnesium stearate and filling. 
Overall, description of manufacturing process is adequate and includes all the relevant critical and non-
critical process parameters. Critical steps have been identified and properly evaluated at the 
commercial scale. The reproducibility of the process has been suitably demonstrated during the 
development of the manufacturing process. Formal validation will be performed post-approval on the 
first three consecutive commercial batches. An acceptable validation plan for this activity has been 
provided. 
During manufacturing process development, process parameters settings have been optimized through 
the use of multivariate DoEs (full factorial and fractional factorial). Considering the limited extent of 
the ranges explored (normal operating ranges), it is considered that these studies demonstrate the 
robustness of the process. Although no formal validation has been performed yet, robustness of the 
process and consistency of the quality was further confirmed by the data collected from the verification 
batches manufactured at commercial scale. 
Product specification 
The finished product is controlled by testing attributes relevant for this dosage form. The finished 
product specification includes tests for appearance, identity of the active (HPLC and UV), uniformity of 
content, assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution, water content (Karl Fischer). The 
capsules comply with Ph. Eur. criteria for microbiological quality. 
The proposed specifications were justified based on the batch and stability results and are generally 
adequate for assuring the product quality and therefore were accepted.  
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was 
provided for the non compendial (in-house) analytical methods.  
Batch results are provided for 19 batches produced from 2006 to the present and used in clinical 
studies, process development studies and primary stability studies. Batch analysis results 
demonstrated compliance with the proposed specifications and confirmed consistency and uniformity of 
the product. The results were consistent from batch to batch and proved that the product can be 
manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been initiated according to ICH guidelines on production scale batches of the 
finished product packaged in its commercial HDPE bottle package. Data from six months of accelerated 
conditions (40°C/75% RH) and 24 months of long term conditions (30°C/65 % RH) are available for 
three batches. At both long term and accelerated conditions no significant changes or trends in any of 
the parameters monitored have been seen and all data are within proposed specifications. 
Freeze/thaw studies and samples stored in an open container up to 12 months did not show trending, 
and a photostability study in ICH conditions shows that the finished product is not sensitive to light.

The overall stability data showed that Erivedge was stable under all tested conditions. The results 
generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined 
in the SmPC. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Growth of Primary Human Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Xenograft Model D5124 
Vismodegib inhibited Hh signalling with an IC50 of 12.7 nM in a mouse 10T1/2 cell line and with an IC50 
of 2.8 nM in the human embryonic palatal mesenchymal (HEPM) Hh responsive cell line. Vismodegib 
exerts this activity through binding to and inhibiting SMO. 
Vismodegib was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the growth of subcutaneous (SC) murine 
medulloblastoma allografts that are driven by constitutive Hh pathway activation caused by mutation 
of the Ptch1 gene. When dosed twice daily at 100 mg/kg, vismodegib caused regressions of 
established Ptch1+/- medulloblastoma tumor allografts. The PD effect of vismodegib on Gli1 expression 
was determined following a single PO dose of 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg in this model. In general, the PD 
effect of vismodegib appeared to be dose and plasma concentration dependent. Expression of Gli1 in 
tumours was maximally repressed at concentrations > 1 μM.  
Vismodegib was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the growth of SC xenograft tumours through 
inhibition of paracrine Hh signalling between tumour and the surrounding stroma. Dosed twice a day 
(BID) significantly delayed growth in a patient-derived human colorectal xenograft model, D5123 in 
nude mice with a minimal effective dose (MED) of 69 mg/kg. The MED for anti-tumour activity 
correlated with the dose needed for maximum Hh signalling in tumours for 12-18 hours. A similar MED 
for vismodegib when dosed twice daily was also observed in a subcutaneous LS180 human CRC 
xenograft model.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
A PK/PD study was performed to validate the use of hair follicles and/or skin as surrogate tissues to 
monitor vismodegib activity. Oral administration of 100 mg/kg vismodegib BID for 5 total doses 
resulted in significant suppression of mouse Gli1 (mGli1) RNA in hair follicles and skin biopsies during

anagen harvested 4 hours following the final dose.  Pathway suppression was observed to a greater 
extent in skin than in hair follicles regardless of the phase of the hair cycle.  A greater fold reduction in 
Gli1 expression was detected in anagen (9.3-fold) vs telogen (3.6-fold) in skin whereas Gli1 was 
repressed similarly during telogen and anagen in hair follicles (1.5-fold).

Vismodegib was evaluated for its ability to inhibit 
radioligand binding to 43 receptors from recombinant 
and non-recombinant cells identified as potential 
mediators of unintended pharmacologic activity. At a 
concentration of 9.2 µM, vismodegib did not have a 
biologically significant effect on radioligand binding to 
any of the off-target receptors. 
The in vitro effects of vismodegib on the hERG 
channel mediated ion current (IKr; rapidly activating, 
delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current) were 
evaluated in voltage-clamped HEK293 cells that 
stably express hERG potassium channels. At 
concentrations of 3 µM, 10 µM, 30 µM, and 80 µM, 
vismodegib inhibited hERG potassium current by 
(mean ± SEM) 4.9 ± 0.5%, 14.4 ± 0.3%, 40 ± 0.4%, 
and 77 ± 0.8%, respectively, compared to 0.2 ± 0.1% 
in vehicle-treated controls.  The IC50 for the effect of 
vismodegib on hERG potassium current was 37.2 µM, 
which is approximately 340-fold greater than typical 
free plasma drug concentration in patients at steady 
state (0.11 µM based on a typical total drug plasma 
concentration of 22.3 µM). 
Administration of vismodegib at 600 or 2000 mg/kg 
had no toxicologically relevant effects on ECG results 
(RR interval, QT interval, or QT interval corrected for 
variations in heart rate), blood pressure 
measurements including heart rate, systolic, diastolic 
and mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure 
(systolic-diastolic), or on body temperatures.  A 
complete scan of the lead II ECG waveforms after 
dose administration revealed no abnormalities. 
In a single-dose pilot dog toxicity study, the peak 
concentration of vismodegib in dogs given 
2000 mg/kg is approximately 4-fold greater than the 
typical plasma drug concentration in patients at 
steady state (22.3 µM). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No Pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been performed (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
Vismodegib concentrations in GLP studies were quantitated using a liquid chromatographic-tandem 
mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) assay method that was developed and validated in both rat and dog 
plasma. 
Absorption 
Single-dose PK studies were performed in mice (Study 05-0547), rats (Study 05-0657), dogs 
(Study 05-1405), and monkeys (Study 04-0745). Animals were given single PO doses of vismodegib in 
0.5% methylcellulose with 0.2% Tween-80 (MCT) at 2 (dog and monkey) or 5 mg/kg (mouse and rat) 
and single IV doses at 1 mg/kg.  Vismodegib was administered as its free base in all PK studies except 
the Cynomolgus monkey PK study in which animals were given the hydrochloride salt. PK parameters 
are summarised in the following table.

Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of vismodegib was evaluated by equilibrium dialysis using 
[14C]vismodegib (Study 06-0526). Protein binding was assessed at vismodegib concentrations of 1, 10, 
and 100 µM in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cynomolgus monkey, and human pooled plasma.  Vismodegib 
appeared to be highly protein bound (> 95% in all species). Values were between 98.1 and 98.44% 
(rat), 95.8 to 95.9% (dog) and between 96.0 and 97.0% (human). 
Vismodegib binds to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, 
binding to human serum albumin was independent of drug concentration but dependent on protein 
concentrations (Study 10-2576). 
Vismodegib did not appear to preferentially distribute to red blood cells, with blood-plasma partition 
ratios ranging from 0.608 to 0.881 in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human pooled whole blood (Study 
06-0599). 
[14C]-vismodegib was widely distributed to tissues in a quantitative whole-body autoradiography study 
in rats (Study 08-0915). The highest concentrations of radioactivity in tissues at t max were found in: 
liver, eye uvea, adrenal gland, white adipose, Harderian gland, kidney cortex and medulla, aorta, 
ovary, and small intestine. The highest concentration of drug-derived radioactivity at t max was 
observed in the contents of the alimentary canal. Elimination was not complete at 144 hours post-dose 
from all tissues. However, as radioactivity was still declining, it was anticipated that drug would have 
been cleared if the study had been conducted over a longer period. 
Metabolism 
Major metabolic pathways of vismodegib identified from in vitro (rat, dog, and human liver microsomes 
or in vivo studies (rat and dog) involve primary oxidations followed by sequential glucuronidation or 
sulfation. No human specific metabolites were identified in vitro in the human mass balance study, 
parent compound represented > 98% of circulating drug-related material. 
The metabolism of vismodegib was investigated in both in vitro and in vivo investigations. The major 
metabolic pathways involved oxidations of the 4-chloro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)-phenyl moiety followed by 
sequential glucuronidation or sulfation. Three additional metabolites were identified from in vivo 
studies that resulted from an uncommon pyridine ring opening.  Two minor GSH conjugates were also 
identified in rat bile, but not in dog bile.  A minor glucose conjugate was identified in dog bile.  
Excretion 
In mass balance studies in rat and dog, drug derived radioactivity was recovered largely in feces 
followed by bile.

CHMP assessment report

Metabolic profiling (Study 07-1010 A) was performed on plasma, urine, feces, and bile from rats 
following a single PO dose of 50 mg/kg (100 µCi/kg) of [14C]vismodegib. Unchanged vismodegib 
accounted for > 95% of radioactivity in rat plasma up to 24 hours post-dose. Approximately 90% of the 
dose was recovered in rat faeces in intact rats.  Unchanged vismodegib accounted for 44.7% (male) 
and 40.2% (female) of the dose in rat faeces. The most abundant metabolite was M3, representing 
15.9% (male) or 10.2% (female) of the dose.  M9 was the second most abundant metabolite detected 
in rat faeces, accounting for 1.7% and 5.7% of the dose in male and female rats, respectively. 
Metabolic profiling (Study 09-0830) was performed on plasma, urine, faeces, and bile from dogs 
following a single PO dose of approximately 5 mg/kg (17 µCi/kg) of [14C]vismodegib. Vismodegib was 
the predominant radioactive component detected in dog plasma, accounting for > 94% of the 
circulating radioactivity exposure. An average of 62.9% (male) and 79.9% (female) of the dose was 
recovered in faeces during the 144-hour collection period.  Unchanged vismodegib accounted for 
23.0% (male) or 13.2% (female) of the dose in dog faeces.  The most abundant faecal metabolite was 
M3, a mono-oxidation metabolite, accounting for 18.9% (male) or 28.0% (female) of the dose in dog 
faeces.  Another predominant faecal metabolite was M13, accounting for 7.1% (male) and 12.1% 
(female) of the dose. 
Radioactivity recovered in bile was mainly in the form of metabolites. Recovery of drug-derived 
radioactivity in urine from both species occurred to a lesser extent (<9% of dose).

Single dose toxicity 
Vismodegib produced no evidence of adverse effects in mice, rats, or dogs following a single PO dose ≤ 
2000 mg/kg in the single dose toxicity studies referenced in the above table. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In all repeat dose toxicity studies, vismodegib dosing was by oral gavage. Dosing was either once daily 
(QD) or twice daily (BID), with doses separated by 6 hours. 
Administration of repeated doses of vismodegib was associated with clinical observations of reversible 
tremors, jerking and/or ataxia in rats. Reversible decreases in platelet counts were observed in dogs 
given 150 mg/kg/day vismodegib, with clinical manifestations of platelet-related toxicity limited to 1 
dog euthanized as moribund in association with thrombocytopenia in the 13-week toxicity study. 
Decreased hematocrit was observed in 1 dog (high-dose group, 50 mg/kg/day). Administration of 
vismodegib produced reversible increases in serum cholesterol in rats and dogs, with no corresponding 
effects on serum triglycerides. 
Additional significant findings considered to be related to the pharmacologic mode of action included 
irreversible alteration/loss of incisors (erupting teeth) and closure of the femoral epiphysis (growth 
plate) in rats, alopecia in rats and dogs and follicular cysts in rats, reversible swelling of the paws in 
dogs with histopathologic correlates of follicular hyperkeratosis and dermal inflammation and reduced 
number of taste buds in rats.

Toxicokinetic analysis showed that systemic exposure in both rats and dogs reached the clinical 
exposure but no substantial (> 5-fold) exposure multiples were achieved in the pivotal repeat-dose 
toxicity studies.

Main findings 
Weight loss. Slight decrease in total white blood cell counts (HD F). 
Increase in serum cholesterol, decrease in serum triglycerides. In 
high dose animals, the stomach was enlarged and filled with food and 
white material. Ingestion and impaction of bedding or other material 
may have contributed to the observed effects on body weight and 
white blood cell counts. Similar observations were not seen in the 4 
week toxicity study where wire-bottom cages were used. 
Body weight loss during first week of dosing (possibly related to 
ingestion of bedding as in 5 day study). Up to 2-fold increase in total 
serum cholesterol. Dose-dependent decreases in alkaline 
phosphatase.  
Mild body tremors (HD males + 1 M MD), reversed within first week 
of recovery phase. Thin and hunched appearance and rough haircoat 
(HD), persisted during recovery phase. Increased incidence of 
malocclusion during recovery phase (all doses). 
Reversible up to 2-fold increases in serum total cholesterol (MD, HD). 
Increased protein and decreased alkaline phosphatase (MD, HD). 
Microscopic findings were limited to effects on incisor teeth: 
degradation of dentin with scattered sequestrate and 
degeneration/necrosis of odontoblasts; secondary findings of fluid-
filled cysts in dental pulp, hyperplasia of the periodontal ligament, 
ossification of the root canal, regeneration of the dental organ and 
scattered haemorrhage. Primary findings were generally dose 
responsive and persisted in recovery animals. No abnormalities were 
observed in the molar teeth, suggesting that these effects were 
related to the continuously growing nature of the rodent incisors. 
Dosing of animals given 500 mg/kg/day was discontinued on Study 
Day 44 due to a substantial body weight loss and associated clinical 
signs of hunched and thin appearance, clear oral discharge, and 
rough haircoat. At the 150 mg/kg dose level, 2 toxicity-study males 
were necropsied at an unscheduled interval (Study Days 67 and 71) 
due to general debilitation attributed to vismodegib. 
A dose-related increase in the incidence of malocclusion was present 
for males and females given 50 or 150 mg/kg/day.  Missing incisors 
were noted for males and females given 150 or 500 mg/kg/day and 
females given 50 mg/kg/day. A dose-related increase in the incidence 
of leg-twitching and/or tremors (limb and body) was present for 
animals given 50 or 150 mg/kg/day during the dosing phase. Test 
article−related clinical signs that persisted through the completion of 
the recovery phase were limited to malocclusion and/or missing teeth 
in animals given ≥ 50 mg/kg/day.  No test article−related clinical 
signs were present in the 10 mg/kg/day dose group during the dosing 
or recovery phases. 
Minimally to mildly higher total and HDL-cholesterol for animals given 
500 mg/kg/day.  Minimally to mildly lower alkaline phosphatase 
activity for animals given 500 mg/kg/day and males given 150 
mg/kg/day may have been test article related.

Histopathologic, dose response-related effects were seen in the upper 
incisor teeth of male and female rats given ≥ 50 mg/kg/day.  
Microscopic changes consisted of loss/atrophy of odontoblasts and 
ameloblasts, degradation of dentin with scattered sequestrae, 
formation of fluid-filled cysts in the dental pulp, hyperplasia of the 
periodontal ligament, ossification of the root canal, regeneration of 
the dental organ, occasional fibrometaplasia, and scattered 
haemorrhage and subacute inflammation. The majority of these 
changes persisted in recovery animals. 
A dose-related, reversible decrease in body weight gain observed 
during the dosing phase in males given 50 or 100 mg/kg/day was 
correlated with a decrease in food consumption.  Clinical signs of 
malocclusion/missing incisors were observed at all dose levels with 
additional findings of red ocular discharge and red discoloration of the 
skin or haircoat.  Additional test article−related effects in animals 
given 50 or 100 mg/kg/day included previously observed tremors as 
well as squinted or protruding eyes, alopecia, and rough or thinning 
haircoat. Clinical signs noted only in animals given 100 mg/kg/day 
included myoclonic jerking. Tremors and myoclonic jerking were 
rapidly reversible following the cessation of dosing, and the increased 
incidence of squinted or protruding eyes was reversible during the 
recovery phase.  Test article−related findings in the functional 
observational battery were limited to animals given 100 mg/kg/day 
and included excessive lacrimation, low carriage, myoclonic jerking of 
the limbs, and reduced grip strength. These findings were reversible 
by the end of the recovery phase, and the reduced physical and 
nutritional status of animals given 100 mg/kg/day may have 
contributed to some of these observations. 
Test article−related effects on clinical pathology parameters were 
limited to minimally to mildly lower alkaline phosphatase activity and 
minimally to mildly higher total, LDL, and HDL-cholesterol in animals 
given ≥ 50 mg/kg/day and were reversible. 
Test article−related microscopic findings were noted in bone, teeth, 
skin/subcutis, taste buds, and ovaries. 
Alterations in the femoral epiphyseal plate were observed in animals 
given ≥ 50 mg/kg and were characterized by loss and disorganization 
of chondrocytes and cartilaginous matrix making up the epiphyseal 
plate and loss of spongiotic and trabecular bone.  These changes 
resulted in partial to complete closure of the epiphysis and were not 
reversible. 
Effects on incisors at ≥ 15 mg/kg were consistent with those observed 
in previous studies and consisted of loss/atrophy of odontoblasts and 
ameloblasts, with secondary degradation of dentin with scattered 
sequestra, formation of fluid-filled cysts in the dental pulp, 
hyperplasia of the periodontal ligament, and subacute inflammation. 
Follicular cysts were observed at 100 mg/kg/day and persisted at a 
low incidence at the end of the recovery phase. Pilomatricoma, a 
benign cutaneous neoplasm arising from the hair follicle, was 
observed at the recovery necropsy in 1 male and 1 female given 100 
mg/kg/day. Pilomatricoma is an uncommon tumor in laboratory rats, 
and its occurrence in animals treated with vismodegib may have been 
related to the pharmacologically mediated effects on hair follicles, as 
evidenced by the observation of alopecia and follicular cysts at the 
same dose level. 
Taste buds were specifically evaluated in this study because of 
reports of dysgeusia in patients.  A decrease in the number of taste 
buds was observed at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day at the end of dosing, with 
evidence of reversibility. 
A decrease in the number of corpora lutea at the terminal and 
recovery necropsies in females given 100 mg/kg/day was suggestive 
of an effect on ovarian activity.  Decreases in percent motile sperm 
(not statistically significant) with no effects on sperm count or 
morphology were observed at the

end of the dosing phase at 100 mg/kg/day and at the end of the 
recovery phase at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day. The differences in sperm motility 
were not associated with effects on sperm count or any 
histopathology findings. 
Increases in serum cholesterol were noted in animals 
given ≥ 150 mg/kg/day. Minimal to mild prolongation of QTc at 
1200 mg/kg/day. Mild degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous 
tubules in one terminal male at 1200 mg/kg/day 
Transient, moderate (counts <100,000/µL) to marked (counts 
<60,000/µL) decreases in platelet counts were observed in some dogs 
given 150 or 400 mg/kg/day. These values returned to predose levels 
prior to the end of treatment and were not associated with changes in 
coagulation parameters. Reversible increases in serum total 
cholesterol (up to approximately 3-fold) were observed in all 
vismodegib-treated groups throughout the dosing phase, and effects 
on both LDL and HDL cholesterol contributed to these differences. 
Histopathologic findings were limited to the testes and epididymides 
and were observed in the majority of vismodegib–treated males at all 
doses. Findings were characterized by the appearance of increased 
numbers of degenerating germ cells within the seminiferous tubules 
and were generally reflected in the epididymides by a relative paucity 
of spermatozoa and abnormal accumulation of cellular debris. At the 
end of the recovery phase, these changes were observed with lower 
incidence and severity, suggesting reversibility of these effects. 
Peracute multi-organ hemorrhage that was associated with a severe 
decrease in platelet count was observed in one high-dose (150 
mg/kg/day) female. Decreases in platelet counts were also observed 
in several other high-dose animals at various intervals during the 
study but were reversible and were not associated with effects on 
coagulation parameters. 
Decreases in food consumption and decreases in body weight 
occurred at the 50 and 150 mg/kg/day dose levels in the initial part 
of the dosing phase and necessitated a 1-week dosing holiday 
beginning on Study Day 19. However, these effects were mitigated by 
offering canned food, and mean body weights in all groups were 
comparable by the end of the dosing phase. 
Test article−related, reversible clinical signs included areas of alopecia 
on the paws of all dogs given vismodegib (see correlating microscopic 
findings below) and alopecia on the muzzle (lips, periorbital) and/or 
dorsal area of 1 or more dogs in each of the vismodegib-treated 
groups.  An increased incidence of discolored (black) liquid and/or 
mucoid feces was observed during the dosing phase in males and 
females given ≥50 mg/kg/day; however, this observation was not 
correlated with gross or microscopic pathology findings. 
Hematology findings were limited to transient, slight to moderate 
decreases in individual platelet values (counts <200,000/µL) at 150 
mg/kg/day.  With the exception of the high-dose group female that 
was euthanized on Day 15, platelet decreases resolved within 1 week 
of discontinuation of dosing. Alterations in the serum chemistry data 
observed in dogs given ≥15 mg/kg/day included the previously 
characterized, dose-dependent increases in LDL and HDL cholesterol 
that resulted in approximately 2- to 5-fold increases in total 
cholesterol. Increases in cholesterol values were observed at all 
intervals during the dosing phase; however, values decreased 
progressively during the recovery phase and were generally similar to 
or only slightly higher than those of control dogs at the end of the 
recovery phase. 
Vismodegib-related macroscopic findings were limited to alopecia on 
the paws, muzzle, or dorsal area. Alopecia was observed at all dose 
levels and was associated with microscopic correlates of focal 
hyperkeratosis and/or inflammation. Alopecia and the associated 
Page 23/99 
 
 
 
 
 
microscopic changes resolved in all animals by the end of the 
recovery period. Other test article−related microscopic changes in 
dogs surviving to terminal euthanasia were present in the kidney and 
adrenal glands but were of uncertain toxicological significance.  In the 
kidneys, increased vacuolation of tubular epithelium was observed in 
females at all dose levels; this change persisted at the end of the 
recovery period.  Decreased vacuolation of the adrenal cortex was 
observed in animals at all dose levels at the end of the dosing phase 
but demonstrated evidence of reversibility and was not correlated 
with any changes in clinical pathology parameters.  In contrast to the 
findings observed at ≥50 mg/kg/day in relatively young animals in the 
4-week dog toxicity study, no microscopic changes in the testes or 
epididymides or other effects on male reproductive parameters were 
observed in the sexually mature dogs in this study. 
No vismodegib-related effects on organ weights, electrocardiographic 
parameters, blood pressure measurements, respiratory parameters, 
body temperature, or ophthalmic parameters were observed. 
Test article−related clinical signs observed in all vismodegib-treated 
groups included swollen or erythematous paws and alopecia.  
Sporadic incidences of fever, hypoactivity, dehydration, and body 
weight loss were observed in 1 animal given 15 mg/kg/day and 2 
animals given 50 mg/kg/day. These effects were mitigated by 
offering additional canned food, by placing animals on dosing 
holidays, or by treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 
or antibiotics. Swollen paws were observed as early as Study Week 
10, but the severity and time-to-onset of this finding were not dose 
dependent. In some cases, swelling progressed to erythematous or 
broken skin on the paw pads and/or limited use of the affected legs. 
Alopecia was observed at high incidences in all vismodegib-treated 
groups and was most evident on the paws, muzzle, periorbital area, 
or hind legs. 
Clinical pathology findings associated with vismodegib administration 
included mildly to markedly increased total, HDL, and LDL-cholesterol 
at all dose levels. The increase in LDL-cholesterol was of higher 
magnitude than the relative increase in total or HDL-cholesterol. 
Minor test article−related effects included mildly lower albumin and 
minimally higher globulin resulting in a lower albumin-to-globulin 
ratio in males given 50 mg/kg/day. These clinical pathology findings 
were generally observed at all intervals during the dosing phase 
intervals and exhibited reversibility. 
Test article-related macroscopic findings included swollen paws and 
alopecia. These findings were observed at a high frequency in all 
vismodegib-treated groups at terminal necropsy but were generally 
reversible by the end of the recovery phase. Test article−related 
microscopic findings were limited to the skin/subcutis or paws and 
included follicular hyperkeratosis in the skin and paws and dermal 
inflammation in the paws. These changes were observed in all 
vismodegib-treated groups at the terminal necropsy and were 
partially reversed by the end of recovery phase. Increases in the 
mean absolute and relative adrenal weight at 50 mg/kg/day at the 
terminal necropsy were considered to be potentially secondary to 
stress. The adrenal weight change was not associated with 
microscopic findings and was not observed at the end of the recovery 
period. 
In contrast to the 4-week dog toxicity study, in which relatively 
young animals were used (approximately 6 to 7 months old at 
initiation of treatment), no test article-related microscopic effects on 
male reproductive organs were observed in the older (approximately 
12 to 15 months old at initiation of treatment), sexually mature dogs 
used in this study.  There were no effects on male reproductive 
assessments (sperm motility, count, and morphology) or female 
reproductive organs, and there were no vismodegib-related changes 
in ECG parameters, vital signs, blood pressure, or ophthalmic

Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed (see discussion on pre-clinical aspects).   
A risk of tumorigenesis, based on the occurrence of pilomatricoma (a benign cutaneous neoplasm) in 
recovery group animals, was identified in the 26-week rat toxicity study and was considered to be 
potentially secondary to the effects of vismodegib on hair follicle morphogenesis. Pilomatricoma was 
observed in 1/9 male rats and 1/10 female rats in the highest dose group (100 mg/kg/day) at the end 
of the 13-week recovery period. Day 182 mean AUC0−24hr exposures (239,000 ng•hr/mL for males and 
251,000 ng•hr/mL for females) were comparable to the exposures typically observed in patients at 
steady state (approximately 225,000 ng•hr/mL based on a steady-state plasma concentration of 
22.3 µM).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No study on fertility or peri/postnatal development has been performed (see discussion on pre-clinical 
aspects). Reproductive assessments were integrated in repeat-dose GLP rat and dog toxicity studies 
and included organ weights and histopathologic evaluation of reproductive organs and detailed male 
reproductive (spermatogenesis) assessments. 
Germ cell degeneration was observed in young male dogs given vismodegib for 4 weeks, but not in 
sexually mature males dosed for 13 weeks or 26 weeks. The effects of vismodegib on male and female 
reproductive parameters in the 26-week rat toxicity study included decreased sperm motility (with no 
effects on sperm count or associated testicular findings) and decreased number of corpora lutea.  
An embryo-foetal development study was performed in rats to assess the teratogenic potential of 
vismodegib.  In this study, rats were given vismodegib once daily by PO gavage on Gestation Days 
6−17 (organogenesis period) at 10, 60, or 300 mg/kg/day.  Maternal body weight gain was 
significantly reduced at 60 mg/kg/day (body weight 24% lower than control on Day 21) and 
300 mg/kg/day (body weight 31% lower than control on Day 21), and maternal food consumption was 
significantly reduced at 300 mg/kg/day.  No effect on maternal body weight gain or food consumption 
was observed at 10 mg/kg/day.  Vismodegib was severely embryotoxic as evidenced by 100%

post-implantation loss at 60 or 300 mg/kg/day.  Findings from foetuses of dams given the low dose of 
10 mg/kg/day were consistent with the anticipated teratogenic properties of a Hh pathway antagonist.  
Morphologic examination of 70 foetuses from 5 pregnant dams given 10 mg/kg/day revealed 21 
foetuses with malformations distributed among 4 litters. Malformations consisted primarily of absent 
and/or fused digits of the hind limb.  In addition, major patterning defects were observed in one foetus 
that had an open perineum (gap between genital and presumed location of anus) and one foetus of a 
different litter that exhibited multiple craniofacial anomalies.  The incidence of foetal retardations or 
variations (such as dilated renal pelvis or dilated ureter) and incompletely or unossified sternal 
elements, centra of cervical vertebrae, or proximal phalanges and claws was also increased at 
10 mg/kg/day, indicative of foetotoxicity.

An assessment of phototoxicity was conducted in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts as described by the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 432 [10191] guidance document (Good 
Laboratory Practice Study 12-1121).  When tested up to the highest achievable concentration of 
17.1 mg/L, vismodegib demonstrated no cytotoxic effect (in the absence of ultraviolet radiation [UVR] 
exposure) or no phototoxic effect (with UVR exposure) in the assay by either the photo-irritancy factor 
or mean photo-effect criteria.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In vitro studies show potent inhibition of hedgehog signalling. The activity at rat hedgehog appears to 
be somewhat lower than on human hedgehog (4 to 5-fold lower). There are no data on activity at dog 
hedgehog, but the number of expected toxicological findings in dog studies would suggest relevant 
pharmacological activity also in dogs. Most studies on anti-tumour activity have been performed with 
the murine Ptch 1+/- medulloblastoma cell line, driven by mutational activation of the Hh-pathway. 
Anti-tumour activity has also been shown in xenograft models with human colon carcinoma cells and 
primary human adenocarcinoma cells. There are no studies with basal cell carcinoma, however this is 
not considered a deficiency, given the established role for hedgehog signalling in BCC. 
Pharmacodynamic / pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate the importance of continuous exposure to 
vismodegib for maintaining Hh inhibition and achieving optimal anti-tumour activity. 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed and as vismodegib is expected to 
be given to patients as monotherapy in advanced basal cell carcinoma, the lack of such studies is 
justified. 
Although the exposure margin achieved in the dog studies was limited (about 4-fold), cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology studies do not suggest a concern for arrhythmic properties of vismodegib. The 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 28/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non-clinical pharmacokinetics profile of vismodegib is sufficiently characterised. There are pronounced 
differences in pharmacokinetic behaviour between species. The terminal half-life in rats is about 1 
hour, in dogs about 2 days and in humans about 11 days. This has implications on the interpretation of 
toxicity studies. While in both dogs and humans, daily or twice daily dosing will lead to accumulation, 
resulting in a flat steady state after a number of days; in rats the plasma exposure will be fluctuating 
and in all rat studies, the exposure will fall substantially before the first dose next day. As a result of 
this it is unlikely that continuous inhibition of hedgehog signalling was achieved in any of the rat 
studies. There may be adverse effects resulting from continuous pharmacological activity which will not 
be revealed in the rat studies. 
Vismodegib exhibits high protein binding. There are some differences between rats, dogs and humans 
with respect to protein binding, but these are considered to be of minor importance when assessing 
exposure margins in the toxicity studies. 
The metabolism appears to be very similar between humans, rats and dogs. In all three species, 
vismodegib represents >94% of drug-derived material in plasma. 
No data have been generated on excretion of vismodegib in milk. However, given the very potent 
developmental toxicity of vismodegib, a strict contraindication against breast-feeding is warranted (see 
SmPC section 4.3). 
Systemic exposures in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs did approximate clinical 
exposure but no substantial (> 5-fold) exposure multiples were achieved in the pivotal repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. However, it appears that the maximum tolerated dose was reached in both species, 
and in addition further increases in doses would not be likely to increase the exposure substantially, 
based on the data from the toxicokinetics studies. Thus, no formal deficiencies with the repeat-dose 
toxicity program have been identified. 
In general, the tolerability of vismodegib in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs was limited by 
nonspecific manifestations of toxicity including decreased body weight gain and food consumption. 
Additional findings at clinically relevant exposures included faecal changes; skeletal muscle twitching or 
tremors; alopecia; swelling, follicular hyperkeratosis, and inflammation in paw pads; and increased 
LDL and HDL cholesterol. Decreased haematocrit or platelet count were observed in some dogs at 
clinically relevant exposures; however, there was no evidence of a primary effect on bone marrow in 
affected animals. 
Toxicity findings were in many cases clearly related to the pharmacological activity, such as findings on 
effects on growing teeth (incisors) and epiphyseal plate in rats, alopecia in rats and dogs and reduction 
of taste buds in rats. Similar effects have been observed or would be expected in humans.  
There was no evidence of genotoxicity in in vitro assays (reverse bacterial mutagenesis [Ames] and 
human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assays) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus 
assay. 
As the proposed indication concerns patients which in most cases do not have a life-threatening 
disease, carcinogenicity studies are warranted (see section on Benefit-Risk).  Pilomatricoma, a benign 
cutaneous tumour was observed in the chronic rat toxicity study. Pilomatricoma has not been reported 
in clinical trials with Erivedge, and the relevance of this finding to humans is therefore uncertain. In 
humans, pilomatricoma is a relatively common cutaneous neoplasm that occurs most frequently in 
children. The lesion is almost exclusively considered to be benign and is readily excisable. Because 
pilomatricoma is believed to originate with hair matrix cells, it is possible that the development of this 
neoplasm is related to pharmacologically mediated disruption of hair follicle morphogenesis (see 
Discussion on Clinical Safety and SmPC section 5.3).

Dedicated nonclinical trials to assess the potential of vismodegib to affect fertility have not been 
performed. However, data from studies in rats and dogs indicate that male and female fertility may be 
irreversibly compromised by treatment with vismodegib. This concern is included in the SmPC. Germ 
cell degeneration and hypospermia were observed in the 4 week dog toxicity study but not in longer-
duration studies with older dogs. Decreased number of corpora lutea in the ovary and decreased mean 
percent motile sperm in the 26 week rat toxicity study were not demonstrated to be reversible by the 
end of the 8 week recovery period. Longer duration nonclinical studies on male and female fertility will 
be submitted post approval (see RMP). 
Severe embryotoxicity and malformations observed in teratogenicity studies were considered directly 
related to vismodegib treatment because of the minimal nature of the maternal effects. In an 
embryo-foetal development study in which pregnant rats were administered vismodegib daily during 
organogenesis, vismodegib crossed the placenta and was severely toxic to the conceptus. 
Malformations, including craniofacial anomalies, open perineum, and absent and/or fused digits, were 
observed in foetuses of dams at a dose which corresponded to 20 % of the typical steady-state 
exposure in patients, and a 100 % incidence of embryolethality was observed at higher doses. Based 
on the strong teratogenic potential, and the likely importance of hedgehog signalling also in later 
developmental stages, vismodegib is expected to exhibit pronounced foetal toxicity throughout the 
pregnancy and also to disturb postnatal development. Dedicated studies to assess the potential of 
vismodegib to affect post-natal development have not been performed. However, irreversible defects 
in growing teeth and premature closure of the femoral epiphyseal plate, observed in rat toxicity studies 
at clinically relevant exposures, represent risks to post-natal development. Erivedge should not be 
used in children and adolescents aged below 18 years. Adequate contraindications, warnings and 
information are provided in the SmPC (see sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.3). 
Based on the intended route of administration (oral), and absence of relevant effects from toxicological 
studies no local tolerance studies were performed and this was considered acceptable. Vismodegib was 
not phototoxic.  
Considering PECs based on the maximum daily dose and environmental-fate-relevant data as well as 
PNECs based on chronic ecotoxicological properties for Vismodegib, no indication for risk is apparent 
for the environmental compartments sewage treatment, surface waters, groundwater and sediment, 
hence no exposure levels of concern to the environment are to be expected. Moreover, while 
vismodegib is very persistent and toxic based on mammalian evidence, it is not bioaccumulative and 
therefore not a PBT substance. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Preclinical data demonstrate that vismodegib is highly teratogenic. This is translated into strict 
contraindications in the SmPC and the need for an Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention Programme. 
Nonclinical carcinogenicity studies and studies on male and female fertility will be submitted post 
approval (see RMP). 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical pharmacology of vismodegib was characterised in several Phase I, II and dedicated clinical 
pharmacology studies to assess single- and multiple- dose pharmacokinetics, absolute bioavailability,

mass balance, drug-drug interaction potential, food effect, QTc prolongation potential, dose schedule, 
and drug product bridging. These studies and assessments were conducted in patients with advanced 
solid tumours or advanced BCC and in healthy volunteers (female subjects of non-childbearing 
potential).  
Clinical trials with vismodegib are listed in table 10. Study SHH4476g was the pivotal efficacy study. 
Efficacy and safety information from Study SHH3925g, safety data from randomized Phase II trials in 
other oncology indications (i.e., Studies SHH4489g in ovarian cancer and SHH4429g in colorectal 
cancer), and from the clinical pharmacology program, can be considered supportive.  
The applicant received Scientific Advice on clinical aspects for treatment of BCC in patients with Gorlin 
syndrome from the CHMP on 16 December 2010. The Scientific Advice pertained to the methodological 
aspects, definition of the cohorts, dose selection, challenges related to the study design, proposed 
statistical analysis plan, proposed safety monitoring plan, endpoints, use of supportive assessments 
including quality of life.

The applicant claimed the approval for the following indication: 
Erivedge is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma for whom 
surgery is inappropriate. 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is: 
Erivedge is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: 
• 
• 
symptomatic metastatic basal cell carcinoma 
locally advanced basal cell carcinoma inappropriate for surgery or radiotherapy. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Total vismodegib in plasma was measured using a solid phase extraction liquid chromatography/ 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. A method for measurement of unbound vismodegib 
was developed, using equilibrium dialysis followed by solid-phase extraction and LC-MS/MS.  
Formulations 
In phase I studies, a dry blend capsule (25 mg, 125 mg and 270 mg) was used. In addition to the 
capsule formulations, an iv solution (5 μg/ml) and an oral suspension (150 mg/30 ml) of vismodegib 
were prepared for use in the human ADME study. 
Differences on bioavailability between the dry blend capsule and the wet granulation capsule were 
observed however this did not have an impact on the results from pivotal studies as the dry blend 
capsule was not used in the pivotal studies. The data may indicate that a difference in formulation can 
affect bioavailability, which needs to be taken into account if changes in the formulation of the product 
are proposed in the future. The manufacturing processes for the phase 2 pivotal study formulation 
versus the to-be-marketed formulation are identical in terms of granulation. In summary, sufficient 
evidence demonstrating that results obtained during development with different formulations employed 
are relevant to the product to be marketed was provided.

Absorption  
Erivedge is a highly permeable compound with low aqueous solubility (BCS Class 2). It is only soluble 
at low pH, around 1. While in simulated gastric fluid, vismodegib is practically insoluble. The partition 
coefficient (log D) is 2.7. Absorption is saturable as evidenced by the lack of dose proportional increase 
in exposure after a single dose of 270 mg and 540 mg Erivedge. Under clinically relevant conditions 
(steady state), the PK of vismodegib is not affected by food. 
After oral administration of a 150 mg capsule, a wide range of Tmax values was seen in different 
studies (1 hr to 7 days). Vismodegib plasma concentrations rose relatively fast, but the initial 
absorption phase was followed by a broad peak. According to a population pharmacokinetic analysis 
cancer patients had slower drug absorption than healthy volunteers, but with at most 5% impact on 
unbound vismodegib concentrations at steady-state.  
The absolute oral bioavailability of vismodegib in fasting healthy volunteers was determined by 
administration of a single 14C tracer 10 μg intravenous (IV) dose administered 2 hr after a single oral 
unlabelled 150 mg dose administered as the proposed commercial formulation. Absolute bioavailability 
(%F) was calculated by dividing the dose-normalised mean AUC0-inf from unlabeled vismodegib 
administered orally by the mean dose-normalised AUC0-inf for 14C-vismodegib administered IV. The 
single dose mean (CV %) absolute bioavailability of vismodegib was 31.8 (14.5) %after a single 150 
mg dose.  
Data from food interaction studies 
The effect of food on vismodegib bioavailability was evaluated in a study in patients with advanced 
malignancies, including a single-dose part (studying high-fat meal and low-fat meal compared to the 
fasting state) and a multiple-dose part (comparing fasting state to a “healthy breakfast”). 
Administration under fed conditions (high-fat meal) resulted in an 84 % increase in degree of 
absorption (AUCtotal) compared to the fasting state in the single-dose part of the study, while a low-fat 
meal only resulted in a 3% increase in AUCtotal. At steady-state, administration of a healthy breakfast 
resulted in an 18% increase in total AUC. Due to the sparse sampling and high variability, no statistical 
evaluation was performed on unbound concentrations, but data indicate a 37% increase in unbound 
steady-state concentrations.  
Distribution 
Vismodegib volume of distribution was determined by administration of an intravenous 
tracer 14C-vismodegib dose of 10 μg 2 hr after administration of a single oral 150 mg dose and after 7 
days of daily administration of 150 mg oral doses. The evaluation was part of the mass-balance study 
in healthy volunteers. Intravenous volume of distribution was, based on total concentration, 
determined to be 16.4 L after a single dose and 26.8 L at steady state. Thus, volume of distribution 
was about 60% greater at steady state than after a single dose, which may be explained by saturation 
of protein binding at the about 3- to 4-fold higher plasma concentrations at steady state.  
The in vitro blood-plasma ratio for vismodegib ranged between 0.61 and 0.82 in human blood at 
vismodegib concentrations of 1 – 100 μM.  
In pooled plasma, the in vitro binding of vismodegib to human plasma proteins was high (97%) and 
was independent of vismodegib concentration between 1 and 100 μM. However, in blank plasma spiked 
with AAG or human serum albumin (HSA) within their physiological concentration ranges, binding to 
AAG was saturable over the vismodegib concentration range tested (5-120 μM). Vismodegib plasma 
concentrations at steady state (150 mg daily) are in the range of 20-30 μM. Thus, saturation of AAG 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 33/99 
 
 
 
 
 
binding in vitro was seen within the clinically and physiologically relevant concentration range for 
vismodegib and AAG, respectively.  
In clinical study samples, fraction unbound (fu) was considerably lower (<1%) than the fu determined 
in vitro. Thus, the in vitro experiments seem to have underestimated in vivo protein binding.   
Plasma data across clinical studies demonstrated a strong correlation between vismodegib total 
concentrations and AAG plasma levels, while there was no significant correlation between unbound 
vismodegib plasma concentration and AAG, exemplified below by data from study SHH4610. In 
individual patients, the total plasma concentration of vismodegib varied with AAG concentration over 
time. Moreover, the clinical study data show an increase in fu with increased plasma concentrations of 
vismodegib. Together, these data indicate that one mechanism behind the observed non-linearity in 
total concentration of vismodegib is saturable binding to AAG.  
Figure 1. Relationship between total vismodegib (A) and unbound vismodegib (B), respectively, and 
AAG concentration (150 mg vismodegib once daily) in study SHH4610g 
Elimination 
After oral administration, vismodegib is slowly eliminated, by a combination of metabolism and biliary 
excretion of parent drug. The t 1/2 was around 12 days after a single dose, while based on the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, effective t 1/2 was about 4 days at steady state. Following a single 
150 mg oral dose in the mass-balance study, the majority of drug-related material was recovered in 
the faeces (82% of the administered dose). In the early faecal samples (0-72 hr) vismodegib was the 
predominating compound, accounting for 22% of the dose, which may to some extent be due to 
unabsorbed drug. In later faecal samples (72-312 hr), which may to greater extent mirror the relative 
importance of metabolism and biliary excretion of parent, metabolite M3 accounted for 12%, M1 for 
1%, M13 for 3%, M18 for 2% and vismodegib for 9% of the dose. Thus, metabolism may be more 
important than biliary excretion. However, altogether only 52% of the recovered dose could be 
quantified as vismodegib and metabolites in faeces. Detectable levels of other identified metabolites 
were observed in urine and faeces, but these could not be quantified.   
Urinary excretion of vismodegib and metabolites accounted for about 4.4% of a single oral dose. If the 
absolute bioavailability of 32% approximates the fraction absorbed (which is unclear), urinary 
excretion may be estimated to account for at most about 14% of the elimination of absorbed drug. 
Thus, urinary excretion appears to be a minor elimination pathway for vismodegib. 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 34/99 
 
 
 
 
 
In a human mass-balance study, vismodegib was predominant in plasma, corresponding to > 98% of 
the total circulating radioactivity at 4, 24, 168, and 312 hours. Only trace levels of M3, M4 and M5 
were detected in plasma. Radioactivity was largely recovered in feces, where M3 was the most 
abundant metabolite (15%).  
Metabolic pathways of vismodegib in humans include oxidation (M1, M3 and M14), glucuronidation (M4 
and M5), and pyridine ring cleavage (M13 and M18). The major oxidative metabolite recovered in 
faeces (M3) is produced by CYP2C9 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A4/5, while another oxidative 
metabolite (M1) is formed primarily by recombinant CYP3A4/5, but multiple isoforms are capable of 
forming both metabolites.  
In vitro data indicate that vismodegib is a substrate for the efflux transporter Pgp and possibly for 
BCRP. These transporters may be of importance for the elimination of vismodegib.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Vismodegib displays non-linear pharmacokinetics in total as well as unbound concentrations, with less 
than dose-proportional increases in exposure. The Applicant suggests that this is due to two different 
mechanisms, saturable binding to AAG and solubility-limited absorption.  
Over studies with once daily administration, steady state was reached within 7-21 days and 
accumulation was around 3- to 4-fold for total concentrations and 7- to 11-fold for unbound 
concentrations.  
In a dose-finding study in patients, study SHH 3925g, vismodegib pharmacokinetics after single-dose 
and once daily multiple-dose administration of Erivedge 150 mg, 270 mg or 540 mg capsules was 
evaluated. After a single dose, mean total and unbound Cmax increased with dose escalation from 
150 mg to 270 mg. However, at 540 mg, the mean total and unbound plasma Cmax values were similar 
to those observed at 270 mg and steady state levels of total and unbound vismodegib, respectively, 
were the same across all dosing cohorts, i.e. there was no further increase in vismodegib exposure at 
doses higher than 150 mg. For total concentrations, the plateau can partly be explained by the 
saturable protein binding. However, saturable protein binding should not affect unbound 
concentrations, as unbound concentrations are not dependent on fraction unbound (fu), but on fraction 
absorbed and intrinsic clearance (CLu). The data from study SHH3925 therefore supports the 
assumption that there is also another non-linear mechanism, possibly solubility-limited absorption.  
In study SHH4610 different doses were achieved by prolonging the dose interval for the 150 mg dose, 
instead of administering higher doses per occasion. Therefore, concentration dependency in 
vismodegib pharmacokinetics could be evaluated without the confounding factor of a different 
bioavailability (F) due to solubility-limited absorption (dose dependency).  The trend for total 
concentrations was the same, i.e. with less-than dose proportional increases in dose, although a 
plateau was not reached. Total concentrations were highly correlated with AAG levels and fu increased 
with increasing vismodegib concentrations, confirming that the non-linearity in total concentrations is 
to some extent determined by saturable protein binding. However, also in this study, a non-linearity in 
unbound concentrations was seen. At a 7-fold decrease in dose, from once daily to once weekly 
administration, the unbound AUC only decreased 3.5-fold, while trough levels decreased dose-
proportionally.   
The peak-trough fluctuation at steady state was about 1.6-fold and 1.2-fold for unbound and total 
concentrations, respectively, i.e. the plasma-concentration time curve is relatively flat.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Combined data from clinical studies were used to quantitatively describe the pharmacokinetics of 
vismodegib and evaluate the effects of relevant covariates that might affect vismodegib exposure in a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis. Both total and unbound vismodegib were analysed 
simultaneously where available. Because of the strong impact of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) on 
vismodegib pharmacokinetics and the fluctuation of AAG levels in cancer patients, individual AAG 
concentration from corresponding time points was included in the analysis. 
Moderate inter-subject variability was estimated for vismodegib disposition parameters in the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis (approximately 50% for CL unbound and Vc, 20% for KD AAG). Intra-
subject variability estimates were 27% and 42% for total and unbound plasma vismodegib, 
respectively. No difference in the degree of PK variability between cancer patients and healthy subjects 
was identified. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the typical patient was 60 years old patient with a body 
weight of 75 kg and AAG of 30 μM. Modelling and simulations suggested that time to steady-state is 
approximately 7 days in the typical population with continuous daily dosing of 150-mg vismodegib.  
AAG concentration was the most important factor influencing steady-state plasma concentrations of 
vismodegib.  Variability of total vismodegib concentration at steady-state was predominantly explained 
by the range of AAG concentration, with extreme AAG concentrations corresponding to 47–101% 
variation of total vismodegib concentrations.  While AAG was also the most influential factor for the 
steady-state concentration of unbound vismodegib, extreme AAG values corresponded to only ± 21% 
variation of unbound vismodegib concentrations.  
Cancer patients showed slower drug absorption (lower first-order absorption rate constant [ka]) than 
did healthy volunteers, but with no significant impact on vismodegib exposure at steady-state. 
Estimated duration of pregnancy prevention 
As there is no pharmacokinetic data beyond 56 days after vismodegib treatment discontinuation, the 
Applicant used a modelling approach to estimate the recommended duration of pregnancy prevention 
in female patients, and female sexual partners of male patients after the last dose of vismodegib. As a 
safe threshold vismodegib plasma level, 1/10 of the estimated NOEL in the rat embryo foetal 
development study was used (which gives 0.0037 μM for total concentration). The simulation was 
made for a typical patient and adding a ±50% variability. For a female partner to a male patient the 
plasma exposure was estimated by calculating a daily dose assuming similar vismodegib levels in 
semen as in plasma, exposure to 6 ml semen daily and 100% bioavailability from the vagina. Based on 
these simulations, the time to reach plasma levels below 0.0037 μM was estimated to be 7 months 
post-treatment in females treated with vismodegib and 2 months post-treatment in female partners to 
males treated with vismodegib. Limited data obtained thereafter indicated that vismodegib levels in 
semen are less than 10% of those in plasma, adding a 10-fold safety factor to the estimation for 
female partners to male patients. Because of a case report of suspected prolonged vismodegib 
exposure beyond 7 months post-treatment, the Applicant performed new pharmacokinetic simulations, 
using the population pharmacokinetic model. A total of 4000 patients were simulated, and a not 
negligible fraction of vismodegib-treated patients may still have levels above 0.0037 μM at 7 months 
after treatment discontinuation.

Special populations 
An updated population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that vismodegib CLu/F was dependent on 
age but not on weight or gender.  The effect of age on CLu/F was modest, <20%, and is not likely to 
be clinically relevant.  
Data were insufficient to evaluate effect of race. Paediatric pharmacokinetic data are at present only 
available from a single patient and are not further discussed here, as there is currently no relevant 
indication for vismodegib in children. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
A clinical DDI study was conducted to evaluate the effect of vismodegib on the cytochrome P2C8 
(CYP2C8) substrate, rosiglitazone.

Vismodegib inhibited CYP2C8 and 2C9 in vitro at Ki levels lower than 50*Cmax,unbound, indicating that an 
in vivo interaction may be possible. However, the in vivo study with the CYP2C8 substrate rosiglitazone 
showed no relevant effect on rosiglitazone pharmacokinetics. Therefore, there should be no risk for 
clinically relevant effects on CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 substrates. The in vitro data suggest that vismodegib is 
not a relevant in vivo inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6, as Ki or IC50 for these 
enzymes was higher than 50*Cmax,unbound. There was an in vitro signal of mechanism-based CYP3A4 
inhibition but it is considered too weak to be clinically relevant.

Based upon hepatocyte induction studies, vismodegib does not appear to be a potent P450 inducer. In 
addition, it does not appear to be a potent binder of pregnane X receptor (PXR). However, at 
concentrations superior to 10µM, a decrease of enzymatic activity was observed, without cellular 
toxicity. No studies were performed to investigate the interaction potential related to UGTs.   
A study on P-glycoprotein transport and inhibition and 2 studies on BCRP transport and inhibition are 
submitted (described in tables 15 and 16)

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Pharmacodynamic down-modulation in the hedgehog pathway shown by a decrease in GLI1 expression 
by more than a factor of two, as compared with pre-treatment biopsy-sample analysis, in 10 of 13 
patients has been reported (Von Hoff et al., 2009).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  potential  for  vismodegib  to  prolong  the  QTc  interval  was  assessed  in  two  clinical  studies, 
SHH3925g  (Phase  I  study  in  cancer  patients)  and  SHH4871g  (dedicated  QTc  study  in  healthy 
volunteers) discussed in Clinical Safety section.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Vismodegib pharmacokinetics is characterised by high-affinity binding to alfa-1-acid glycoprotein 
(AAG), slow elimination via hepatic mechanisms, a very long half-life (about 11-12 days after a single 
dose) and non-linearity, with less than dose proportional increases in total as well as unbound 
concentrations. The non-linearity in total concentrations is explained by saturable protein binding, 
while the mechanisms behind the non-linearity in unbound concentrations can largely be explained by 
solubility-limited absorption. There appear to be two different non-linear mechanisms in vismodegib 
pharmacokinetics, saturable protein binding (affecting total concentrations) and solubility-limited 
absorption (affecting also unbound concentrations). There are also some indications of time-dependent 
pharmacokinetics as absolute bioavailability appeared to decrease at multiple dosing. 
Altogether, the pharmacokinetic data indicate that total concentration is not a good marker for 
unbound concentration. Although at higher doses (270 mg, 540 mg) in study SHH3925 total and 
unbound concentrations appeared to be parallel (possibly due to solubility-limited absorption), this was 
not the case in study SHH4610, and may not be the case in situations where elimination (CLu) is 
affected, such as at organ impairment or an interaction. However, the concentration-effect 
relationships for efficacy and safety were primarily determined using total concentrations of 
vismodegib, which proved to be of limited value due to non-linear and AAG-dependent 
pharmacokinetics. Further PK/PD analysis, indicated that unbound concentration is more suitable than 
total concentration for detecting potential exposure-response relationships, which was also supported 
by basic pharmacokinetic theory.  
Erivedge is suggested to be a highly permeable compound with low aqueous solubility (BCS Class 2), 
but high permeability cannot be definitely concluded. The single dose mean (CV %) absolute 
bioavailability of Erivedge is 31.8 (14.5) %. After multiple doses absolute bioavailability appears to 
decrease to around 7%.  Absorption is saturable as evidenced by the lack of dose proportional increase 
in exposure after a single dose of 270 mg and 540 mg Erivedge. 
The effect of a high-fat meal on unbound concentration is unknown, but might be larger compared to 
the observed effect on total concentrations. However, the healthy breakfast administered in the 
multiple-dose part of the study is probably more representative of the real-life situation.  Under these 
clinically relevant conditions (steady state), the PK of vismodegib is not affected by food. Therefore, 
Erivedge may be taken without regard to meals. 
Due to the pH-dependent solubility, an interaction study with a proton pump inhibitor is planned. Until 
data are available the SmPC contains a relevant interaction warning that medicinal products that alter 
the pH of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, 
and antacids) may alter the solubility of vismodegib and reduce its bioavailability.  
Due the current uncertainties regarding the disposition of vismodegib, the incompletely evaluated 
elimination and interaction potential is included as missing information in the RMP. 
The elimination of vismodegib appears to be primarily via hepatic routes. A combined renal/hepatic 
impairment study is included in the RMP. As a difference in elimination capacity (intrinsic CL) at organ 
impairment might not be seen in total concentrations but only in unbound concentrations due to the 
saturable protein binding of vismodegib free concentrations will be determined. Awaiting the study 
results, a warning of caution has been introduced in the SmPC for moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment, as vismodegib is primarily eliminated via hepatic routes. Based on the low urinary 
excretion of vismodegib, mild-moderate renal impairment would not be expected to lead to clinically 
relevant increases in unbound concentrations of vismodegib. However, severe renal impairment might 
affect also metabolism and transport, and a warning of caution at severe renal impairment has been 
implemented in the SmPC.

In vitro studies indicate that vismodegib is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
and the drug metabolising enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, but involvement of these enzymes 
transporters has not yet been confirmed in vivo.  When vismodegib is co-administered with medicinal 
products that inhibit P-gp (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin, azithromycin, verapamil, cyclosporin), 
CYP2C9 (amiodarone, fluconazole or miconazole), or CYP3A4 (boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telaprevir, telithromycin, or voriconazole), systemic exposure of vismodegib and incidence of adverse 
events of vismodegib may be increased. When vismodegib is administered with CYP inducers 
(rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John´s wort), exposure to vismodegib may be decreased. 
Relevant warnings and contraindications are also reflected in the SmPC. Studies with a CYP2C9 and a 
CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor, are included in the RMP. If the results of these studies do not support 
involvement of those enzymes/transporters, additional data might be needed to elucidate the 
elimination mechanisms for vismodegib.  
In vitro studies to investigate whether vismodegib is substrate to or inhibitor of additional transport 
proteins will be performed and are included in the RMP. 
Determining the effect of vismodegib on oral contraceptives is important due to the teratogenic 
potential of vismodegib. An interaction study with an oral contraceptive has been submitted, 
demonstrating no effect on ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone upon 7 days pre-treatment with 
vismodegib. However, as the vismodegib treatment period might have been too short to obtain an 
induction effect, data on whether vismodegib may give rise to reduced plasma levels of hormonal 
contraceptives are not reassuring. Hormonal contraceptive methods that may be sensitive to induction 
can therefore presently not be recommended as highly effective. Two contraceptive methods are 
recommended in the SmPC, one highly effective method of contraception, and one barrier method.  
An interaction study with rosiglitazone confirmed that clinically relevant effects of vismodegib on 
concomitant substrates of CYP2C8 or 2C9 are unlikely. However, data are not sufficient to exclude a 
risk for time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Therefore, further in vitro data or a study with 
midazolam is included in the RMP. As vismodegib is likely to be a BCRP inhibitor, a study with a BCRP 
substrate is recommended.  
A case report of suspected prolonged vismodegib exposure beyond 7 months post-treatment triggered 
the need for additional PK simulations, using the population pharmacokinetic model and thereby taking 
into account the distribution of co-variates for vismodegib PK in the population (as opposed to the 
previous simulation for a typical, “average” patient). Due to limitations of the pharmacokinetic model, 
it is not considered possible to base predictions of the time needed to reach plasma levels below 
0.0037 μM in all patients using this model. Nevertheless, the simulation raises concern that the 
previously proposed 7 month period is too short and it was finally considered that the duration of 
pregnancy prevention should be 24 months post-treatment for female patients of child bearing 
potential. Additional pharmacokinetic observed data from patients who have discontinued vismodegib 
is necessary to clearly establish the time period needed for vismodegib washout. To avoid potential 
foetal exposure during pregnancy, male patients must always use a condom (with spermicide, if 
available), even after a vasectomy, when having sex with a female partner while taking Erivedge and 
for 2 months after the final dose.  Patients should not donate blood while taking Erivedge and for 24 
months after the final dose. Male patients should not donate semen while taking Erivedge and 
for 2 months after the final dose. In order to assist health care providers and patients to avoid 
embryonic and foetal exposure to Erivedge the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational 
materials (Erivedge Pregnancy Prevention Programme) to reinforce the potential risks associated with 
the use of Erivedge (see RMP).

No data have been generated on excretion in milk, and given the very potent developmental toxicity of 
vismodegib, breast-feeding is contraindicated for women treated with Erivedge.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
As discussed above, uncertainties in the pharmacology of vismodegib is addressed by strict 
recommendations in the SmPC until further data requested to the Applicant will be available. 
Due to the risk of embryo-foetal death or severe birth defects caused by vismodegib, women of child 
bearing potential (WCBP) treated with it must be able to comply with the Erivedge Pregnancy 
Prevention Programme using effective contraceptive measures; these consist of two methods of 
recommended contraception including one highly effective method and a barrier method during 
Erivedge therapy and for 24 months after the final dose. WCBP, whose periods are irregular or stopped, 
must follow all the advice on effective contraception. Erivedge is contraindicated in WCBP who do not 
comply. As vismodegib is contained in semen, to avoid potential foetal exposure during pregnancy, a 
male patient must use the recommended contraception during treatment and for 2 months after his 
final dose (see SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6). 
The CHMP considered RMP measures necessary to address issues related to pharmacology (see RMP). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
The application is based on data from the pivotal study SHH4476g, supportive efficacy and safety 
information from study SHH3925g, supportive safety data from randomized Phase II trials in other 
oncology indications (studies SHH4489g in ovarian cancer and SHH4429g in colorectal cancer), and 
from the clinical pharmacology program.11,12

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The starting dose of 150 mg/day (92.5 mg/m2/day) of vismodegib for the Phase I trial SHH3925g in 
cancer patients was determined based on animal toxicity studies. This was estimated as corresponding 
to a 32-fold safety margin over the STD10 in rats (500 mg/kg/day or 3000 mg/m2/day), as well as a 
32-fold safety margin over the HNSTD in dogs (150 mg/kg/day or 3000 mg/m2/day). In the Phase I 
dose-escalation  study,  vismodegib  was  administered  daily  at  a  150-,  270-,  or  540-mg  dose  level. 
Because  no  dose-limiting  toxicities  or  other  significant  toxicities  were  observed  at  the  150-mg/day 
Phase  I  starting  dose,  administration  of  a  lower  dose  was  not  expected  to  provide  any  additional 
benefit to patients, and doses lower than 150 mg were therefore not evaluated in Phase I. 
Following  a  single  dose  of  270  or  540  mg  vismodegib  with  a  7-day  observation  period,  vismodegib 
plasma exposure was greater than that observed following the 150-mg dose. However, upon continued 
daily  dosing  in  the  same  patients,  steady-state  plasma  concentrations  of  vismodegib  were  equivalent 
for  the  three  dose  levels.  No  additional  dose  escalations  were  conducted  because  of  the  lack  of  an 
increase  in  steady-state  concentrations  with  dose  and  the  absence  of  dose-limiting  toxicities  at  the 
270- or 540-mg dose levels. No association between increased response rates and daily dose level was 
observed  in  this  study,  an  observation  consistent  with  the  finding  of  similar  steady-state  plasma 
concentrations across dose levels. The recommended Phase II dose was 150 mg/day.  
In the Phase II study SHH4476g, no relationship was observed between tumour response (complete 
response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease) and steady-state total plasma 
concentration of vismodegib (see Clinical efficacy section). 
In addition, no obvious relationship was observed between weight loss, alopecia, dysgeusia, fatigue, or 
muscle spasms and total (studies SHH3925g and SHH4476g combined) or unbound (SHH3925g only) 
vismodegib plasma concentration.

the patient at high risk from treatment complications. 
Treatments 
Patients  received  150  mg  of  vismodegib  daily  by  mouth,  beginning  on  Day  1,  and  continuously  until 
unequivocal disease progression, intolerable toxicity attributable to vismodegib or withdrawal from the 
study.  No  dose  modification  or  reductions  in  study  drug  were  allowed  per  protocol.  Treatment  with 
vismodegib  may  have  been  interrupted  for  up  to  4  weeks  for  evaluation  of  an  intolerable  toxicity 
finding or up to 8 weeks for a planned surgical procedure. In addition, treatment with vismodegib may 
have been interrupted for up to 4 weeks if a patient became temporarily unable to swallow capsules. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to estimate the clinical benefit of vismodegib given as therapy for patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic BCC, as measured by objective response rate (ORR). 
Secondary  objectives  included  estimation  of  the  duration  of  objective  response,  progression-free 
survival  (PFS),  and  overall  survival  (OS),  assessment  of  the  safety,  tolerability  of  vismodegib  in  this 
patient  population,  PK  of  vismodegib  in  this  population  (at  participating  sites  only),  assessment  of 
patient-reported outcomes, assessment of the histopathologic effect of vismodegib in tumour biopsies 
obtained  at  baseline  and  following  vismodegib  treatment  in  patients  with  locally  advanced  BCC, 
evaluation  of  the  status  of  the  Hh  signalling  pathway  using  quantitative  reverse  transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in archival tissue. 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 44/99 
 
 
 
 
Exploratory objectives included the evaluation of the effect of vismodegib treatment on the Hh 
signalling pathway using qRT-PCR and/or other approaches in tissue obtained at baseline and following 
vismodegib treatment in patients with locally advanced BCC, evaluation of the relationship between the 
effects of vismodegib treatment on the Hh signalling pathway and efficacy in patients with locally 
advanced BCC. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint was ORR as assessed by independent review facility (IRF). 
Secondary endpoints were: Duration of response, PFS assessed by IRF and by investigator.  
Additional secondary endpoints were included: Patient-reported outcomes, effect of vismodegib in 
tumour biopsies, status of the Hh signalling pathway using quantitative reverse transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in archival tissue.  
During treatment, tumour assessments were conducted every 8 weeks and at study completion or 
early termination visit as appropriate. Patients assessed as having an objective response (defined as a 
complete or partial response, RECIST1) underwent confirmatory tumour assessments ≥ 4 weeks after 
the initial documentation of the objective response.  
Progressive disease was defined according to RECIST or new ulceration of target lesion without 
evidence of healing for at least 2 weeks per IRF. Per investigator assessed non-target lesion 
progression was also defining PD. 
Sample size 
The sample size was chosen to 100 patients, as with respect to efficacy, this study had approximately 
80% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (see Statistical methods) given a true ORR of 37% in 
the metastatic BCC cohort (with 20 treated patients) and 34% in the locally advanced BCC cohort (with 
80 treated patients).  
Randomisation 
Patients were not randomized in this study.  
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
The  magnitude  of  ORR  (determined  as  a  function  of  a  radiographic  IRF,  photographic  IRF,  and 
pathological IRF) was  formally tested in two parallel analyses  using one-sided exact binomial tests in 
the metastatic and locally advanced BCC cohorts.  
The following hypothesis was tested at the one-sided α = 0.025 level in the metastatic BCC cohort: 
Ho: ORR ≤ 0.10 versus Ha: ORR > 0.10 
Similarly, the following hypothesis was tested at the one-sided α = 0.025 level in the locally advanced 
BCC cohort: 
Ho: ORR ≤ 0.20 versus Ha: ORR > 0.20

Efficacy analyses were performed on the efficacy-evaluable patient population. Analyses of primary and 
key secondary efficacy parameters were repeated for all enrolled patients by IRF and by investigator. 
Data  are  also  presented  for  the  tissue-confirmed  population  that  consisted  of  all  treated  patients  for 
whom  either  a  baseline  biopsy  or  archival  tissue  showed  evidence  of  BCC.  The  primary  analysis 
population  for  efficacy  consisted  of  all  treated  patients  for  whom  the  independent  pathologist’s 
interpretation  of  archival  tissue  or  baseline  biopsies  was  consistent  with  BCC  (the  efficacy-evaluable 
population).  In  locally  advanced  BCC  cases  when  there  was  a  conflicting  interpretation  of  archival 
tissue  versus  a  baseline  biopsy  by  the  independent  pathologist,  the  baseline  biopsy  was  used  to 
determine inclusion in the efficacy analyses. 
Patients  without  interpretable  baseline  or  archival  tissue,  as  determined  by  the  independent 
pathologist,  or  by  pathology  report  from  the  study  site  documenting  a  pathologist’s  determination  of 
BCC, were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Patients who have received at least one dose and who 
discontinued  for  any  reason  prior  to  undergoing  one  post-baseline  response  evaluation  were 
considered  non-responders  in  the  primary  analysis  and  disease  progression  was  be  censored  at  the 
date of baseline tumour assessment +1 day. Duration of objective response and PFS were censored at 
the last tumour assessment date for patients without disease progression who had not died within 30 
days of last exposure to study treatment.

Recruitment 
A total of 104 patients were enrolled at 31 study sites in the United States (72), England (2), France 
(7), Germany (14), Belgium (7), and Australia (2). 
The  study  was  activated  on  10  February  2009  (first  patient  in)  and  enrolment  was  completed  on  26 
February 2010 (last patient in).  The study Period was from 10 February 2009 to 26 November 2010, 
data cut off; with follow-up updates and data cut off on 26 May 2011, report date 2 November 2011.  
Conduct of the study 
As of the database cut-off date (November 2010), protocol had been amended twice.  
Baseline data 
Demographic and Baseline characteristics for the efficacy-evaluable patients are given in the following 
tables 19 and 20.

For patients with locally advanced BCC, the most frequent sites of target lesions were the 
scalp (18), forehead (15), and “other” sites (19). Sites on the face, including those on the 
nose (9), ear (8), and cheek (8), were also frequent sites of target lesions. Altogether 22 
patients with a medical history of Gorlin syndrome or suspected Gorlin syndrome were 
enrolled in Study SHH4476g.

The efficacy-evaluable population consisted of 96 patients (all enrolled 33 patients with mBCC and 63 
patients with laBCC). In 8 pts with laBCC, the pathologic diagnosis was not confirmed histologically 
based on biological biopsy, these were excluded from efficacy-evaluable population.

included; if more than one sample at a given timepoint was free of residual BCC, the earliest timepoint 
was used.  For patients with more than one target lesion, biopsies from all target lesions had to be free 
of residual BCC.

Independent review of Clinical Benefit 
The Applicant has undertaken an Independent review of Clinical Benefit in patients with laBCC. This 
review was done by three experts in dermato-oncology independently classifying baseline severity and 
clinical benefit followed by a consensus review.  
Baseline severity was graded from 1 to 5, where 5 was defined as “disfigurement without possibility for 
reconstruction or prosthetics” (see table 31) and clinical benefit from 1 to 5, where 5 was defined as 
“significant clinical benefit”.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Locally advanced BCC not amenable to alternative therapies is rare and metastatic BCC is an extremely 
rare condition. Obviously, a long-term placebo-controlled trial without cross-over would have provided 
the ideal data set for a benefit (and risk) assessment in patients with metastatic BCC. Also in the 
locally advanced setting such a study would be informative, not only about the benefit of therapy in 
terms of tumour response and duration of response, it would also make possible an assessment of 
benefit in terms of time to progression and delay in progression until disfiguring lesions. However, the 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 63/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
difficulties to perform comparative trials in this very limited population are acknowledged and the 
proposed clinical trial design appears justified. Despite the non-randomised design of the pivotal trial, 
the antitumor activity in terms of tumour shrinkage (ORR) observed in the pivotal trial can reasonably 
be attributed to vismodegib in view of the natural history of the disease, without the need for a parallel 
control. In case of locally advanced disease and symptomatic metastatic diseases, tumour shrinkage as 
measured by objective partial or complete response is considered to be of clinical relevance. Historical 
comparisons cannot be reliable to interpret survival data. Thus, the chosen endpoint appears justified. 
In the November 2011 analysis for locally advanced disease the ORR by IRF was 30/63 (48%) and the 
median duration of response of about 9.5 months. A review of the photo documentation was 
undertaken by three experienced oncology-dermatologists independently grading severity of lesions at 
baseline and grading outcome in terms of clinical benefit, followed by consensus assessment.  The 
results are considered credible and the “significant clinical benefit” rate in patents with the highest 
severity score at baseline was reported as 21/37 (57%).   
The ORR (IRF) was 11/33 and median duration about 8 months, investigator 16/33 and 15 months, 
respectively.  
The majority of responses were reported at the first scheduled visit, i.e. after 8 weeks. Median time to 
maximum tumour shrinkage was about 7 months.    
Altogether, patient benefit as measured by durable tumour responses and “significant clinical benefit” 
has been documented in at least 50% of patients with locally advanced BCC enrolled.   
Additional expert consultation 
Following the CHMP request, a Scientific Advisory Group meeting was convened on 9 January 2013 to 
provide advice on the following issues on efficacy and optimal treatment duration: 
1.  Evidence of efficacy of vismodegib in the proposed indication treatment of locally advanced basal 
cell carcinoma inappropriate for surgery or radiotherapy. The following issues were discussed;  
- 
 A post hoc analysis of patient benefit was undertaken independently by three experts followed 
by a consensus statement. This review was done with the aim to complement conventional 
tumour response data. The SAG was asked if these “patient benefit data” can be considered 
credible. 
SAG answer: Based on the good concordance between investigators and the independent 
experts, the review is considered reproducible and therefore credible. However, the 
adjudication of presence or absence of clinical benefit is a subjective judgement that was not 
assessed using a validated scale. Thus, although this clinical expert judgement is likely to be 
related to favourable cosmetic and possibly functional outcomes, the precise quantitative 
interpretation of clinical benefit in terms of e.g., symptom improvement, health-related quality 
of life, is unknown. 
-  The SAG was asked if -in combination with tumour response and duration of response data-, 
the available data are altogether considered to be quantitatively and qualitatively sufficient to 
estimate patient benefit. 
SAG answer: For locally advanced disease, the observation of major responses including a high 
number of complete responses in exposed areas of the skin, the long response duration, the 
frequent healing of ulceration and the investigators’ and clinical experts’ assessment of clinical 
benefit allow concluding that treatment with vismodegib is associated with a clinically relevant 
benefit. For metastatic disease, however, the clinical relevance of the antitumour activity 
associated with vismodegib is questionable although not necessarily absent. This is due to the 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 64/99 
 
 
 
 
relatively low response rate, the absence of complete responses, the unlikely clinical relevance 
of an effect on asymptomatic lesions, and the varying cosmetic importance of tumour 
shrinkage depending on the site of the lesion. Due to the relatively low response rate, it is also 
not possible to assume that the observed activity could result in a clinically relevant benefit in 
terms of progression-free survival or overall survival. In addition, the effects observed for 
locally advanced disease cannot be easily extrapolated to the metastatic setting as the biology 
of the two conditions is likely to be different. Thus, the potential clinical importance of the 
observed activity in the metastatic setting warrants further characterisation before reliable 
conclusions can be drawn. 
2.  metBCC is an extremely rare condition and attempts from the Applicant to provide historical data 
enabling an assessment of putative survival benefit is judged to be non-informative.  The SAG was 
asked if in the absence of a randomized control and informative historical data, an estimation of 
patient benefit can be based solely on ORR and duration of response. 
SAG answer: Although this is in principle not excluded, there is a need to establish the clinical 
relevance of the effect observed in terms of response rate and duration of response. See 
answer to previous question. 
3.  It is suggested that treatment should continue until stable response, followed by a treatment-free 
interval until progression with the aim to improve tolerability without loss in efficacy. This 
recommendation is not based on the design of the study, only on rapid reversibility of adverse 
reactions when treatment was withdrawn and apparent slow development of resistance.   The SAG-
O was asked if it is supportive of this recommendation. 
SAG answer: Individual decisions about continuing treatment, based on perceived benefits and 
tolerability as well as other considerations, are common in clinical practice. However, it is 
currently difficult to recommend a different approach from the one used in the pivotal study 
due to the lack of data about other approaches.  
Although the proposed approach has some merit in terms of avoiding unnecessary toxicity 
when maximal benefit appears to have been reached, one cannot exclude that this might lead 
to loss of efficacy or even acquiring of resistance. The optimal treatment duration aiming to 
further improve the benefit-risk is currently uncertain. It is recommended to further assess the 
proposed intermittent schedule in a prospective clinical trial. In addition, the value of dose 
escalation for patients not responding and in the absence of unacceptable toxicity should be 
explored. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Conditional approval is warranted with reference to the need to provide further efficacy data in patients 
with metastatic BCC (see Benefit-Risk Balance, Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial 
effects). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In locally advanced BCC, patient benefit has been established.  Given the difficulties to evaluate 
efficacy in mBCC, established benefit can be considered in those metastatic patients who are 
symptomatic. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA:

Patient exposure 
The assessment of safety is mainly based on data from the pivotal study SHH4476g. Supportive safety 
information is presented from the exploratory study SHH3925g, supportive safety data from 
randomized Phase II trials in other oncology indications (i.e., Studies SHH4489g in ovarian cancer and 
SHH4429g in colorectal cancer), and from a comprehensive clinical pharmacology program.

In the pivotal study 104 patients were treated. The pooled safety population consist of a total of 138 
advanced BCC patients from study SHH4476g (n = 104, 75.4%), SHH3925g (n = 33), and SHH4610g 
(n = 1; 0.7%).   
The median duration of treatment was almost 10 months in the pivotal study.  
Information was provided in the first update and 72 patients in the pooled safety population was 
treated >12 months and 49 patients were treated >18 months. 
As of the last update per 28 May 2012, 56 (54%) and 37 (36%) of the population in the pivotal study 
have been treated >12 and >18 months respectively. The median duration of treatment is almost 13 
months (12.93 months in the total population, 13.27 in the metastatic group and 12.68 in the locally 
advanced group.)

Adverse events 
All patients in the pivotal study population experienced at least one AE, the majority 57.7 % were of 
grade 1-2. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were muscle spasms (68.3%), 
alopecia (63.5%), dysgeusia (51.0%), weight decreased (46.2%), fatigue (35.6%), and nausea 
(28.8%).  
 The events clearly related to vismodegib seem to be rather late in appearance with muscle spasms 
with a median first appearance around day 200 and alopecia around day 100.  Other common events 
are diarrhoea and constipation in around 20% of the patients. The majority of the events, 57%, are of 
grade 1-2. The most common events of grade > 3 were weight loss in 7.2%, fatigue in 5.8% and 
muscle spasms in 3.6% of the patients. Grade 3-5 events were reported somewhat more often in the 
locally advanced group (46.5% vs. 33.3%), this could be attributed to longer duration of treatment. 
Although no explicit information regarding the clinical appearance of muscle spasms has been 
provided, there seems to be a reversibility and most patients seem to endure the muscle spasms as 
only few quit explicitly due to this adverse event, however in a not negligible number of patients 
muscle spasms are contributing in some way to study termination. 
Twelve cases of squamous epithelial carcinoma of the skin were reported in the pivotal study. Although 
the intended population is at increased risk for this malignancy the lack of control group makes it hard 
to evaluate the potential impact of treatment. In total there were 28 cases detected reported on days 
96-614, however the majority of events were detected around day 200-300. No cases of squamous 
epithelial carcinomas are detected in other patients than the BCC population. These patients have risk 
factors for CuSCC, hence a connection is even more difficult to establish.  
In the pivotal study, as well in the other studies, a few additional other cancers are reported; in the 
pivotal study one case each of oesophageal carcinoma and sarcoma and in the pooled safety 
population two adenocarcinoma pancreas. There is no obvious pattern with regards to timing or type of 
malignancies, although the significance of these findings is not yet established. 
As the safety population is small the relevance of less common events is hard to establish. One 
relatively common event was eye disorders reported in 17% in the pivotal study. Events such as 
keratitis, keratopathy, ulcerative keratopathy, conjunctivitis were reported and although these are 
different events, eye disorders could be of concern. However, as a comparison the only eye disorder 
event reported in the colorectal study was increased lacrimation (see discussion), therefore these 
events are not considered to be translated into ADRs for the moment. 
Other events that could be of concern are osteonecrosis and fractures, Hedgehog pathway inhibitors 
has in pre-clinical studies  shown impairment on bone and teeth development. Apart from the apparent 
risk in case of off label use in children, this could be of concern also in adults as bone is constantly 
remodelling. Data provided are inconclusive both with regards to preclinical and clinical data, although 
findings are not clearly indicative of an effect, it cannot be completely ruled out (see discussion). 
Arthralgias (15%) and other musculoskeletal events and muscle related events like muscle pain events 
were commonly reported. As with muscle spasms no clear mechanism of action is described. 
In total four thromboembolic events were reported, also syncope/presyncope, hypotension and cardiac 
events are reported in a few patients. 
One study suggests importance of Hh signalling in maintenance of cardiac musculature, furthermore 
Hh signalling is believed to have a role in maintaining the stemcell niche in the subventricular zone and 
hippocampus. The clinical implications especially with regards to long-term treatment are not known.

Events occurring after 12 and 18 months of treatment 
In the pooled safety population, adverse events occurring ≥ 12 months after treatment initiation with 
vismodegib were consistent with the overall safety profile of vismodegib, with common adverse events 
being muscle spasms (36.1%), diarrhoea (25.0%), weight decreased (23.6%), nausea (18.1%), 
fatigue and constipation (each 13.9%), alopecia (12.5%), and decreased appetite (11.1%) 
Adverse events occurring ≥ 18 months after treatment initiation with vismodegib were also consistent 
with the overall safety profile of vismodegib, with the most common adverse events being muscle 
spasms (24.5%), diarrhoea (18.4%), weight decreased (12.2%), nausea (8.2%), fatigue (14.3%), 
constipation (10.2%), and alopecia (10.2%) 
The majority of events both after 12 and 18 months were of grade 1-2.

In the safety update (data cut off date, 28 Nov 2011; pooled safety population), further information 
was added from the expanded access study SHH4811g and 150 patients from the global safety study 
MO25616.  
Table 40: 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the pivotal study as of data cut off date, 26 November 2010, serious adverse events occurred in 26 
patients overall (25%), of these seven (21.2%) in the metastatic population and 19 (26.8%) in the 
locally advanced population.

In the pivotal study also other cardiac serious adverse events like acute myocardial infarction, angina 
pectoris, myocardial infarction, restrictive cardiomyopathy and vascular/ neurologic events such as 
hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, syncope and hypovolemic shock occurred in singular cases.  In 
total six tumours were reported in four patients (malignant melanoma, metastatic malignant 
melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma and 
sarcoma). 
Deaths 
Seven metastatic BCC patients and nine locally advanced patients had died as of the primary cutoff 
date, in metastatic patients’ progressive disease was the most frequent cause of death (n = 5).  In the 
locally advanced cohort four died from adverse events and one patient because of progressive disease 
within 30 days of treatment.  The corresponding Grade 5 serious adverse events were hypovolemic 
shock, acute myocardial infarction, meningeal disorder and “death of unknown cause”.  Four patients 
died >30 days post-treatment.  Two were deaths of unknown cause and one ischaemic stroke, one 
patient died from disease progression. 
At the last update, cut-off date 29 May 2012, there were in total 27 deaths reported, 15 in the 
metastatic population and 12 in the locally advanced group. In total 6 deaths were reported on or 
within 30 days of treatment and 21 were reported in follow up.  The majority of events were 
progressive disease (11 in the metastatic group and 4 in the locally advanced group). Seven of the 
deaths were due to adverse events (one in the metastatic group and six in the locally advanced group.  
Laboratory findings 
A number of anaemias were reported as AEs. In preclinical data decreased platelets were observed. 
An increase in cholesterol was seen in both rats and dogs. In total cholesterol was recorded in 42 
patients and hypercholesterolemia was found in 3. 
Hyponatraemia seems to be the most common laboratory abnormality grade 1 and was reported in 
about 30 % of the patients and grade > 3 (Na 120-130mmol/l) in about 5% of the patients.  
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 73/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is an increase in hepatic parameters in about 20% of the patients; however no patient met the 
criteria for Hy’s law. 
The major finding in vital signs is weight loss, with a median decrease of 5.7 kg. 
The QT study in 61 women did not show any meaningful change in QTc compared to baseline. The 
dosing was discussed and deemed sufficient. There were no preclinical signals with regards to QT. 
The QT study in 61 women dosed with 150 mg vismodegib once daily for seven days did not show any 
meaningful change in QTc compared to baseline. The dosing was discussed and deemed sufficient. 
There were no preclinical signals with regards to QT. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In the pooled safety population the majority of patients were <65 years old.

The most common events had a higher incidence in younger patients (<65 years old), but the grade 
>3 events were more common in the older age group. More squamous epithelial carcinoma, cough and 
cardiac events are reported in the older age group. This could in part be related to age. Overall no 
major differences were seen.  
Sex 
About one third of the patients were female. 
More nausea and vomiting is reported in the female population, in general regarding chemotherapies 
women have a higher degree of nausea and vomiting. Furthermore more pain in extremities is seen in 
the female group. More female patients experienced grade >3 adverse events. No major clinically 
relevant differences were shown. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Not studied, data from a study in renal and hepatic impairment will be available in March 2015 (see 
conditions). 
Children 
Not studied. Children are not affected by BCC if they do not have Gorlin syndrome.

There are limited data on bone and teeth formation of uncertain significance from a paediatric study 
(PBTC-025) on medulloblastoma.  
Immunological events 
This part was not specifically analysed by the applicant. However, especially in study SHH4489g some 
AEs as rash and pruritus were reported. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There are currently no relevant in vivo interaction data for vismodegib, but only in vitro data and the 
metabolism of vismodegib has not been fully elucidated. A reduced concentration of contraceptive 
hormones of 10-20% cannot be excluded. With regards to teratogenicity this is of concern.   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 43: Reasons for discontinuations pivotal study all patients 
Muscle spasms accounted for discontinuation in 2 patients. All other events were singular.  However 
there are about 20% of the patients leaving study due to “own decision”. A total of 30 patients in 
Study SHH4476g discontinued treatment because of “patient decision” or “physician decision.”   In 
these cases site interviews were conducted to determine the underlying reasons for discontinuations. 
Based on the interviews, the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were described as 
“prolonged AEs are intolerable” (36.7%), “other” (26.7%), and “logistic challenges with travel and 
treatment” (20.0%).

MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
Additional information  
A case report was received informing of a female patient of non-child-bearing potential, enrolled on an 
investigator-sponsored study who experienced persistent alopecia. Upon analysis, blood concentration 
of vismodegib at 11 months post-treatment was 2.5 μM. A second sample from the same patient at 14 
months post-treatment showed no quantifiable vismodegib levels (see Clinical Pharmacology). Based 
on the analysis of the second sample, it was considered that results from the first sample was unlikely 
to have occurred 11 months post-treatment discontinuation. No postmarketing data were submitted. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As vismodegib is a first in class compound, no background data can be drawn from class effects. The 
safety data base is limited with regards to numbers treated in the sought indication, the pivotal study 
is a single arm study that included 104 patients and further 34 further patients with advanced BCC are 
included in the pooled safety population.  
Information regarding 150 patients from the global safety study MO25616 and about 97 patients from 
expanded access study SHH4811 is provided. Both grade 1-2 and grade 3-4 events as well as SAEs are 
reported in a markedly lower frequency compared to the pivotal study. This could have different 
explanations one of which is shorter duration of therapy. The safety information that could be obtained 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 76/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from other oncologic studies is of limited importance mainly because of the much shorter duration of 
the treatment (5 vs. 10 months), but also with regards to clearly different populations.  
The dose intensity was high, over 95% in the pivotal study, and only about 11% discontinued 
treatment due to adverse events indicating that the regimen is tolerable. However adverse events 
were a contributing factor also in cases reported as patient´s decision. 
In humans a defect in Hedgehog signalling can give rise to severe foetal malformations such as failure 
of forebrain development, microcencephaly, cyclopia or absent nose. The teratogenicity is of great 
concern although the women in the intended population are mainly of non-reproductive potential. As 
vismodegib is found in semen, warnings on pregnancy prevention concern also female partners of men 
treated with vismodegib. The indication sought may also include patients with locally advanced 
tumours that can be inoperable due to location, but small and not life threatening per se. It is expected 
that the majority of patients will have a locally advanced disease and not metastatic disease. As a 
consequence, a contraindication in pregnancy and a pregnancy prevention plan are included (see also 
Clinical Pharmacology). 
The most common adverse events in the pivotal study were muscle spasms 68.3%, alopecia 63.5%, 
dysguesia 51.0%, weight decreased 46.2%, fatigue 35.6% and nausea 35.6%.  Also similar events as 
ageusia (11.5%), hypogeusia (10.6%) and asthenia 8.7% were common. The vast majority of these 
events were of grade 1-2. Weight decrease in 7.2% of the patients was the most common grade 3 
event. Other common events were constipation, diarrhoea and decreased appetite, reported in about 
20% each and arthralgia reported in 15% in the pivotal study. Further muscular events like muscle 
pain, myalgia, back pain and similar were reported in 3-6% of patients each.  Preclinical data has also 
shown impaired fertility. In the safety population about 30% premenopausal women became 
amennorhoic.  
Neoplasms were reported in 19 patients (18.3%) in the pivotal study, the absolute majority were 
squamous epithelial carcinomas of the skin. Compared to the 3-year risk of developing a SCC after a 
BCC of about 6% at 3 years or lower 13 the numbers detected in the studies was higher, furthermore 
there are preclinical findings with regards to pilomatricomas in rats that could be related to effect on 
hair follicles but this is not fully elucidated. Squamous epithelial carcinomas are when detected early 
amenable to surgical excision. Recommendations are included in the SmPC to alert the treating 
physician to this event. 
Both in the pivotal study and in other studies malignancies have been reported such as pancreatic 
carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, sarcoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung. Second primary 
malignancies are added as a potential risk in the RMP and will be followed in the safety study 
MO25616. 
Eye disorders were reported in 17.3% in the pivotal study. Many different events were reported both 
symptomatic like “eye irritation”, “eye pain” and “eye swelling” and diagnoses like keratitis, 
keratopathy and ulcerative keratitis. Hedgehog signalling has been proposed to be involved in corneal 
epithelial cell proliferation. Keratitis is addressed as a potential risk in the RMP and will be adjudicated 
by the data safety monitoring board in the safety study MO25616. 
With regards to preclinical data on bone and teeth development, rare events of “pain in jaw” 1.9%, 
osteonecrosis (1.9%) and fractures were observed. There were clear data on impaired bone 
development in the postnatal period in animals and as bone is constantly remodelling this could 
tentatively also have impact in adult bone tissue. Fractures are addressed as potential risk in the RMP, 
including additional pharmacovigilance activities (see Pharmacovigilance). There are data on bone and 
teeth of uncertain significance from a paediatric study (PBTC-025) on medulloblastoma. Exposure to 
vismodegib in the post-natal period in children may have effects on dentition, but any effect on teeth 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 77/99 
 
 
 
 
may not be apparent until eruption of the adult teeth. Information regarding preclinical findings is 
added in the SmPC. 
In total four thromboembolic events were reported, also syncope/presyncope and cardiac events are 
reported in a few patients, these events are discussed in the context of hedgehog signalling. As an 
example Hedgehog signalling has been implicated to have a complex role in ischaemic tissue repair for 
example in myocardial ischaemia. Venous thromboembolic events are included as potential risks in the 
RMP (see Pharmacovigilance). 
There did not seem to be any clinically relevant differences with regards to sex or age >/< 65 years. 
Other ethnic populations apart from white and special populations with hepatic or renal impairment 
were not studied. Data on cancer patients with hepatic or renal impairment will be available post-
authorisation  (see Pharmacovigilance). 
With regards to laboratory abnormalities, the most common event was hyponatremia reported in about 
30% of the patients, and of grade >3 (<130-120 mmol /l) in about 5% of the patients. In about 20% 
of the patients there was an increase in transaminases, this was mostly grade 1-2, the issue is 
addressed in the RMP. The adverse events associated with vismodegib treatment have been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Additional expert consultations 
The following questions related to safety were posed to the SAG-Oncology meeting of 9 January 2013.  
Vismodigib targets fundamental mechanisms related to stem cell proliferation, largely of unknown 
importance in adults. To this should be added a very small safety database, especially with 
respect to number of patients treated long-term.  
-  The SAG-O was asked if the available safety data are considered sufficient to support licensure  
SAG-O Answer: The available data are considered sufficient for assessing the overall toxicity 
profile and the benefit-risk balance. Overall, in view of the established clinical benefit in locally 
advanced disease, the toxicity profile is considered acceptable. 
-  The SAG-O was asked if it would be acceptable to achieve further safety data post marketing in 
the context of a post-approval safety study. 
Additional post marketing toxicity data, including longer term data are necessary due to the new 
mechanism of action, the limited safety database, the observed toxicity and risks. The post-
approval safety study should include careful assessment of the risk of developing second 
malignancies based on a sufficiently long follow-up. In addition, relatively infrequent symptoms for 
other anticancer therapies, such as muscle spasm and keratitis, necessitate comprehensive clinical 
and biological characterization. Also, the possible interference with stem cell function and 
regeneration of damaged tissues requires thorough evaluation, including long-term follow-up. 
Lastly, it is recommended to assess if an intermittent schedule could be associated with a more 
favourable toxicity profile, including long-term toxicity. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The applicant should provide a safety update of the pooled safety population, a final report from 
SHH4476g (pivotal study) and an interim analysis of a global safety MO25616 of 500 patients with a 
final report after projected enrolment of 800 patients.  The initial primary objective is to assess the 
safety of vismodegib (GDC-0449) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BCC. Cases of 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 78/99 
 
 
 
 
 
squamous cell carcinoma, death, fracture and keratitis will be monitored and patients with amenorrhea 
will be evaluated. 
Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The available data are considered sufficient for assessing the overall toxicity profile and the benefit-risk 
balance. Overall, in view of the established clinical benefit in locally advanced disease, the toxicity 
profile is considered acceptable. 
To increase the safety data base the global safety study MO25616 is planned to include more than 
1000 patients over 3.5 years with a projected analysis of 500 patients treated > 12 months by 2014. 
The common side effects like muscle spasms, alopecia, taste disorders and weight decreased seem to 
be manageable/ tolerable in the proposed dosing. 
With regards to more uncommon side effects, including neoplasms (particularly squamous epithelial 
carcinoma of the skin), eye disorders, syncope, thromboembolic events and cardiac events will be 
further followed in the RMP as potential risks and in the safety study MO25616.  
Hedgehog signalling is of known importance in embryonal development. Severe teratogenicity is well 
established in preclinical models, in humans a defect in Hedgehog signalling can give rise to severe 
foetal malformations such as failure of forebrain development, microcencephaly and cyclopia.  This 
important identified risk requires additional pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation activities 
(see Pharmacovigilance).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
Further data on long-term safety: 
-  The applicant should provide a safety update of the pooled safety population, a final SHH4476g 
(pivotal study) and an interims analysis of study MO25616 of 500 patients with a potential one 
year follow up by June 2014.  
Further data on safety: 
-  Final analysis of MO25616.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considers that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a qualified person 
responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Most BCC lesions are small and are treated using various surgical methods, photodynamic therapy, and 
approved topical treatments. Cure rates are generally high irrespective of modality if properly applied.  
However, a very small proportion of BCC may progress to an advanced stage that is no longer 
amenable to available treatments. In these cases progressive disease results in morbidity from local 
tissue invasion and destruction particularly on the face, head and neck. These lesions include both 
locally advanced BCC, that is either inoperable or in patients who have medical contraindications to 
surgery and for whom radiotherapy was unsuccessful or contraindicated, or very rarely, metastatic 
BCC. Vismodegib is a small molecule inhibitor of the Hh signalling pathway, which is an important 
signalling pathway in BCC.  
The pivotal efficacy data presented are based on a single-arm trial in which ORR by IRF in locally 
advanced BCC patients was 30/63 (48%) with 14 (22%) complete responses, and median duration of 
response was 9.5 months. For locally advanced disease, the observation of major responses including 
a high number of complete responses in exposed areas of the skin, the long response duration, the 
frequent healing of ulceration and the investigators’ and clinical experts’ assessment of clinical benefit 
allow concluding that treatment with vismodegib is associated with a clinically relevant benefit. 
For metastatic disease, the ORR by IRF was 11/33 (33%) with no complete responses, and median 
duration of response of 7.6 months. In case of symptomatic disease, similarly to locally advanced 
disease, it is possible to conclude that treatment with vismodegib will be associated with a clinically 
relevant benefit. However, the efficacy data in this group were limited (see Uncertainty in the 
knowledge about the beneficial effects). 
An assessment was undertaken independently by three dermato-oncologists followed by consensus 
assessment, provided credible qualitative information in support of conventional tumour response data. 
The overall “significant clinical benefit” response rate was 65% and in patients with worst baseline 
severity 21/37 (57%).   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
For metastatic disease, the demonstration of efficacy is based on a very small subgroup of 33 patients. 
Although it is acknowledged that this is a very small proportion of BCC, additional data are needed to 
confirm the benefit for symptomatic metastatic patients. In view of the observed benefits, the high 
unmet need in the target indication that includes patients with a severely mutilating disease, it is 
acceptable for such data to be submitted post-approval (see Specific Obligation to complete post-
authorisation measures for the conditional marketing authorisation).

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common adverse events associated with vismodegib are muscle spasms, alopecia, taste 
disorders and weight loss.  Muscle spasms and taste disorders were reported in almost 70% of the 
patients, alopecia in 60 % and weight loss in 45%, these events are clearly defined also with regards 
to preclinical findings. were tolerable and only very few patients stop treatment due to side effects. 
Other common side effects were fatigue/asthenia in about 40% of the patients, gastrointestinal events 
such as nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, and constipation and musculoskeletal events such as 
arthralgia and muscle pain in about 20-30% of the patients. The most common grade >3 events were 
weight decrease, fatigue, muscle spasms and hyponatremia occurring in 7, 6, 3 and 4% of the patients 
based on most recent safety update, respectively. The most common SAEs in the pivotal study were 
neoplasms, vascular disorders, infections, cardiac disorders and nervous system disorders all reported 
in less than 5%. More uncommon events were relatedness cannot be ruled out will be followed as 
potential risks in the RMP and more data provided in the safety study MO 25616. 
An established serious unfavourable effect is teratogenicity. Hedgehog signalling is of known 
importance in embryonal development. Preclinical data has shown malformations and foetal death. 
Although there is no human exposure of vismodegib in pregnancy, defective hedgehog signalling in 
human has shown severe embryo- and foetotoxicity with mid line defects, cyclopia, ancephali and 
death. There are also preclinical findings on impairment of fertility which could be irreversible. 
Impairment of fertility is addressed in the RMP. Contraindication in pregnancy, warnings and 
recommendations on contraception for both male and female patients are included in the SmPC and a 
pregnancy prevention program is to be implemented.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As the proposed indication concerns patients which in most cases do not have a life-threatening 
disease, carcinogenicity studies are warranted.  Squamous epithelial skin cancers and other second 
malignancies will also be further followed. In view of the observed benefits, the high unmet need in the 
target indication that includes patients with a severely mutilating disease, it is acceptable for such data 
to be submitted post-approval (see RMP).  
The safety data in BCC patients are limited. The pivotal single-arm study included 104 patients; 
furthermore 34 patients from phase 1 studies are added in the pooled safety data base. Given the 
small number studied, the knowledge in particular with regards to less common events is limited.  
Missing information identified include use in hepatic impairment, use in renal impairment, interaction 
with other medications, and long-term use of vismodegib in patients with advanced BCC (locally 
advanced and metastatic BCC). However, in view of the observed benefits, the high unmet need in the 
target indication that includes patients with a severely mutilating disease, it is acceptable for such data 
to be submitted post-approval (see Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
conditional marketing authorisation). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Moderate to high anti-tumour activity in terms of ORR and durable responses in the locally advanced 
as well as in the metastatic setting have been proven. In locally advanced disease and symptomatic 
metastatic disease, this activity is considered to be of clinical relevance. 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 92/99 
 
 
 
 
The most common side effects as muscle spasms, taste disorders and weight loss are considered to be 
manageable.  Contraindication and warnings against pregnancy are included in the SmPC and a 
pregnancy prevention program is agreed. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, in patients with locally advanced or symptomatic metastatic BCC, clinical benefit is considered 
established. The toxicity is considered manageable and adequate pharmacovigilance activities and risk 
minimisation measures have been described. 
The benefit/risk of vismodegib in the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic metastatic basal 
cell carcinoma, or locally advanced basal cell carcinoma inappropriate for surgery or radiotherapy is 
considered favourable.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The clinical benefit of vismodegib is demonstrated in locally advanced basal cell carcinoma and in 
symptomatic metastatic BCC patients with manageable toxicity. In view of the unmet medical need 
and recognised difficulties to perform comparative trials in this population it is considered important 
that the product is available. However, with respect to the limited efficacy and safety data, further 
clinical studies are warranted to provide comprehensive data on the benefit-risk balance.  
The applicant will provide a safety update of the pooled safety population, the final updated analysis of 
the pivotal study SHH4476g, an interim analysis of study MO25616 of 500 patients in June 2014 with a 
potential one year follow up and a final report from the study in June 2015.  
Study MO25616 is planned to enrol a total of more than 800 patients over 3.5 years, projected as 630 
patients in EU, it is estimated that 70 metastatic patients will be included. The primary objective is to 
assess the safety of vismodegib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BCC. Secondary 
objectives will be overall response in those patients with measurable disease as permitted by local 
regulatory requirement and other efficacy parameters such as time to response, duration of response, 
progression-free survival and overall survival and QoL. 
The CHMP considered that Erivedge falls under the scope of Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 507/2006:  
- Medicinal products which aim at the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of 
seriously debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases  
and is thus eligible for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation. 
Furthermore, all the requirements listed in Article 4(1) of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
507/2006 apply to vismodegib on the basis of the following reasons: 
a) The risk-benefit balance of the product is positive.  
See Discussion on benefit-risk balance. 
b) It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive clinical data: 
The applicant will provide further comprehensive clinical data to confirm efficacy and safety of 
vismodegib in the proposed indications from the update of the pivotal clinical trial and interim and final 
reports from trial MO25616. The study is currently ongoing. Thus, it is likely that the applicant will be 
able to provide comprehensive clinical data. 
c) Fulfilment of unmet medical need in the proposed indications: 
Erivedge 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 93/99 
 
 
 
 
Currently there are no approved treatment options for the patients that fit the proposed indication.  
The target population of advanced basal cell carcinoma concerns patients no longer amenable to 
available treatments. In these cases progressive disease results in morbidity from local tissue invasion 
and destruction particularly on the face, head and neck.  These lesions include both locally advanced 
BCCs, that are either inoperable or in patients who have medical contraindications to surgery and for 
whom radiotherapy was unsuccessful or contraindicated, or symptomatic metastatic BCC.  
d) The benefits to patients of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required: 
In view of the favourable benefit-risk profile and the unmet medical need (see above), the immediate 
availability of vismodegib outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
The applicant was consulted and agreed with the proposal of the CHMP recommending the granting of 
a conditional MA.

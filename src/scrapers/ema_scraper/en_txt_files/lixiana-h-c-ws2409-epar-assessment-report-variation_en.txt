2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance
This variation application intends to update sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC with available 
paediatric data based on final results from study DU176b-D-U312. This is a phase 3, open-label, 
randomised, multicentre, controlled trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
edoxaban and to compare the efficacy and safety of edoxaban with standard-of-care anticoagulant 
therapy in paediatric subjects from birth to less than 18 years of age with confirmed venous 
thromboembolism (VTE). The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated accordingly. The RMP version 
17.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial 
changes in the SmPC and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.3. 
The pharmacokinetics of edoxaban was evaluated in 208 paediatric subjects across 3 clinical studies 
(Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS, ENNOBLE-ATE, and a single-dose PK/PD study) using a population 
pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model. The pharmacokinetic data of 141 paediatric subjects enrolled in 
Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS and ENNOBLE-ATE were included in the PopPK analysis. The median 
exposure of edoxaban in paediatric subjects patients tended to be within the range of exposures 
observed in adult patients, but there was a 20-30% underexposure in children adolescents aged 12 to 
<18 years compared to adults who received the edoxaban 60 mg once daily (QD) dose. In Hokusai 
VTE PEDIATRICS and ENNOBLE-ATE, the observed geometric mean trough exposures of edoxaban in 
the paediatric population were 7.8 ng/mL in subjects 0 to <6 months of age (N = 9), 8.6 ng/mL in 
subjects 6 months to <2 years of age (N = 19), 7.4 ng/mL in subjects 2 to <6 years of age (N = 36), 
13.7 ng/mL in subjects 6 to <12 years of age (N = 38), and 10.8 ng/mL in subjects 12 to <18 years of 
age (N = 39). Overall, the PK-PD relationships were similar between paediatric patients from birth to 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 7/195
18 years of age and adult VTE patients. However, the variability in PD generated considerable 
uncertainty in the assessment of this relationship.
The applicant did not propose a paediatric indication or posology for edoxaban arguing that study 
DU176b-D-U312 did not meet the primary objective of showing non-inferiority of edoxaban versus 
SOC on a primary endpoint including symptomatic and VTE. This approach was not endorsed initially, 
as the pivotal study did not show apparently a lack of efficacy of edoxaban or safety signal in children, 
and EMA rules allow extrapolation of the efficacy of a medicinal product from adults to children by 
means of an extrapolation exercise (EMA/199678/2016). In addition, the Paediatric Addendum on VTE 
prophylaxis and treatment does not require a formal hypothesis of non-inferiority at the time of 
designing VTE paediatric phase III trials (EMA/CHMP/763438/2017). Therefore, it was considered 
during the first round that a paediatric indication and posology might be feasible even if study 
DU176b-D-U312 did not meet its primary objective. 
In the response to CHMP questions, the applicant provided and discussed some key pitfalls of the 
paediatric development of edoxaban in children. Regarding dose and posology, similar exposure as 
obtained in adults was NOT achieved using the proposed dose regimen of edoxaban tablets in subjects 
12 to <18 years of age (rather, it could lead to an approximately 20% to 30% underexposure). This 
was translated into a higher annualized rate of recurrent symptomatic VTE with edoxaban vs. SOC in 
the meta-analysis provided in response to Q10 of the RSI (15.6% vs. 6.4% in the study U312 in 
children), while in the adult study U305, the trend was the opposite in favour of edoxaban (3.5% vs. 
3.9%). In addition, in sensitivity analyses, using the endpoint of symptomatic recurrent VTE as defined 
in the EINSTEIN-Jr study, edoxaban would have been declared inferior to SOC with statistical 
significance (HR: 2.34; 95% CI: 0.453 to 12.054) (see also assessment of the MAH answer to Q11). 
Therefore, a potential lack of efficacy of edoxaban due to underexposure in children at the doses 
tested in study U312 is a real possibility. 
In addition, it is unknown whether the tablet and granule formulations are bioequivalent in patients 
younger than 12 years.  There are inadequate PK/PD, efficacy, or safety data to support the use of the 
edoxaban 30 mg or 15 mg tablets in patients younger than 12 years of age. As a result, establishing a 
paediatric posology is challenging and subject to significant uncertainty with the data available, and an 
extrapolation exercise of the efficacy from adults is fraught with risk. Finally, there are several 
treatment options for paediatric VTE (i.e.: rivaroxaban, dabigatran, heparins and VKAs). Given the 
treatment options available for paediatric patients and the uncertainty that edoxaban offers at least an 
equivalent benefit to SOC in this patient population, the MAH does not consider that a recommendation 
for formulation development is warranted (see assessment of the MAH answer to Q10 of the RSI).
It is unfortunate that the paediatric PIP has failed in achieving the goal of establishing an appropriate 
effective and safe dose that provides a similar edoxaban exposure as in adults. Given the uncertainties 
about the benefit-risk profile of edoxaban in the paediatric population and the difficulties in 
establishing an appropriate paediatric dose, the CHMP shares the MAH proposal of not recommending 
the use of edoxaban in children.
Regarding changes to the product information, the CHMP agrees with the MAH proposal of not pursuing 
a paediatric indication and posology, as well as not proposing a line extension for a paediatric 
formulation (granules for oral suspension used in paediatric trials in children aged < 12 years). 
However, some ammendments have been implemented by the MAH in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
The benefit-risk balance of Lixiana/Roteas, remains positive.

is recommended for approval.
Paediatric data
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan for Lixiana/Roteas (Decision number: P/0423/2021) (PIP number: EMEA-
000788-PIP02-11-M11) and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation
In view of the data submitted with the worksharing procedure, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and 
IIIB and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended.
4.  EPAR changes
The table in Module 8b of the EPAR will be updated as follows:
Scope
Please refer to the Recommendations section above 
Summary
Following the review of paediatric data it was concluded that edoxaban is not recommended for use in 
children and adolescents from birth to 18 years of age with confirmed VTE (PE and/or DVT) event as 
the efficacy has not been established. Available data in VTE patients are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2. For more information, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

5.  Introduction
Edoxaban (as tosilate) is an orally active, selective, direct, and reversible inhibitor of activated 
coagulation factor X (FXa) that was developed as an anticoagulant agent.
The edoxaban (Lixiana®) Marketing Authorisation was granted by the European Commission on 19 Jun 
2015.  In addition, Roteas® was approved on 19 Apr 2017 as informed consent approval to Lixiana.  
Lixiana and Roteas are approved for the following indications in the European Union:


Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation with 1 or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 
≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke, or transient ischaemic attack 
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of 
recurrent DVT and PE in adults
Currently, edoxaban is authorised in 67 countries and is marketed in 59 countries worldwide.  
Cumulatively, from the international birth date through to the end of first quarter 2022, a total of 
884,920 patients are estimated to have received edoxaban for the orthopaedic surgery indication 
(approved in Japan) and 7,885,754 patient-years of edoxaban exposure for nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation and venous thromboembolic event (VTE) indications.
This Clinical Overview Addendum provides data to support the Type II variation application in order to 
update the Summary of Product Characteristics with clinical paediatric data.
The current standard of care for the treatment of VTE in children is unfractionated heparin (UFH) or 
low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administered for 5-7 days usually followed by (at least) three 
months of LMWH or oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [4,10,11]. The duration of 
anticoagulation treatment must take into consideration the differences in risk and benefit that may 
vary with the cause of the VTE (e.g.: idiopatic versus CVC-associated VTE), the age of the patient, and 
whether or not the conditions that triggered the VTE are still present (e.g.: removal of the CVC line). 
In the absence of large randomized controlled trials, and with much of our current understanding of PK 
extrapolated from adult studies, ideal dosing for anticoagulation in critically ill neonates remains 
uncertain.
The important disadvantage of LMWHs, particularly in children, is administration by subcutaneous 
injections [Bidlingmaier et al.  Semin Thromb Hemost. 2011;37:814-25].  Vitamin K antagonists have 
a delayed onset of action, narrow therapeutic index, unpredictable pharmacologic response, and 
multiple food and drug interactions and therefore require frequent therapeutic monitoring [Monagle et 
al. Hematology Am Soc Hematol. 2018;2018:399-404].  Direct oral anticoagulants overcome many of 
the above limitations.  Direct oral anticoagulants, including edoxaban, can be administered orally, are 
antithrombin independent, have a rapid onset and offset of action, have few drug and food 
interactions, and have predictable pharmacokinetics (PK) with no need for routine monitoring of 
anticoagulation activity [Albisetti et al. Hämostaseologie. 2020;40:64-73]. 
Although paediatric patients are at less risk than adults for the development of a VTE, embolic disease 
does occur and is well described in children and adolescents with or without risk factors.  Thrombosis is 
an increasingly recognised complication occurring primarily in children with serious underlying 
conditions and most often associated with intravenous catheters [Young et al. Pediatr Blood Cancer. 
2006].

6.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects
The  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  for  edoxaban  includes  two  Phase  3  safety  and  efficacy  studies  and 
one supporting Phase 1 PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) study conducted in paediatric subjects:
•
Study  DU176b-D-U312  (Hokusai-VTE  Paediatrics  Study,  hereafter  referred  to  as  Study 
U312),  a  pivotal  Phase  3,  open-label,  event-driven,  randomised,  multicentre,  controlled  study  aiming 
to  evaluate  the  PK  and  PD  of  edoxaban  and  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  edoxaban  with 
standard  of  care  (SOC)  anticoagulant  therapy  in  paediatric  subjects  from  birth  to  <18  years  of  age 
with confirmed VTE
•
Study  DU176b-C-U313  (ENNOBLE-ATE  Study,  hereafter  referred  to  as  Study  U313),  a 
supporting Phase 3, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, observational study aiming to 
evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  edoxaban  in  children  from  birth  (38  weeks  of  gestation)  to  <18 
years of age with cardiac diseases at risk of thromboembolic events (TEs).
•
Study  DU176b-A-U157  (hereafter  referred  to  as  Study  U157),  a  supporting  Phase  1,  open-
label, single-dose, nonrandomised, multicentre study in paediatric subjects <18 years of age aiming to

Four randomised subjects did not receive study drug; 2 subjects 12 to <18 years, 1 subject 6 to <12 
years, and 1 subject 6 months to <2 years; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Listing 16.2.1.2.
One subject 2 to <6 years did not receive study drug (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 
14.1.2.1)
In Study U313, age cohort 6 months to <2 years comprised 2 sub-cohorts: age 1 to <2 years of age 
and 6 months to <1 year of age.
A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PopPK/PD) analyses of paediatric data from 3 clinical 
studies (DU176b-D-U312, DU176b-C-U313 and DU176b-A-U157,) were conducted to characterise 
paediatric  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  PK/pharmacodynamic  (PD)  and  to  compare  the  PK  and  PK/PD 
data between paediatric patients and adult VTE patients from Study DU176b-D-U305.
In  addition,  a  bioavailability  and  food  effect  study  using  edoxaban  granules  for  oral  suspension  and 
edoxaban tablets was conducted in healthy adult subjects:
•
Study  DU176b-A-U154,  a  Phase  1,  open-label,  randomised,  3-treatment,  3-way  crossover 
study  in  healthy  adult  subjects  conducted  to  assess  the  relative  bioavailability  and  food  effect  for  a 
novel liquid oral suspension of edoxaban.
6.1.  Bioanalytical methods
The bioanalytical method employed in the submitted bioequivalence and food effect study (DU176b-A-
U154) is not defined because the bioanalytical report has not been submitted. This deficiency is not 
relevant at this stage because that formulation is not intended to be marketed.
The conducted population PKPD analyses of edoxaban involves paediatric patients in Studies DU176b-
A-U157, DU176b-D-U312, and DU176b-C-U313. In study DU176b-A-U157 (Edoxaban Population 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis To Support Dose Selection in Pediatric Study) the plasma concentrations of 
DU-176b (edoxaban) and the metabolite D21-2393 (edoxaban 4-carboxylic acid) were analysed, but 
also those of other analytes (D21-3231, D21-1402, and D21-2135) that have not been considered in

the PopPK analysis and, therefore, they are not considered relevant and are not described in this 
report. In studies DU176b-D-U312 and DU176b-C-U313 the plasma concentrations of DU-176b 
(edoxaban) and the metabolite D21-2393 (edoxaban 4-carboxylic acid) were analysed. Therefore, the 
bioanalytical method for the measurement of these two analytes is described in the present report.
The plasma concentrations of DU-176b (edoxaban) and the metabolite D21-2393 (edoxaban 4-
carboxylic acid) were measured in these three studies with the bioanalytical method no. 
140524DEN176HPL_S_V5, which had been validated in the Validation Report 07670VDAC_DEN_R1 and 
Partial Validation Reports 080091PVKLN_DEN_R2 and 140524PVRM_DEN_R1. The first two report have 
been assessed previously during the initial marketing authorisation application. The metabolites D21-
3231, D21-1402 and D21-2135 were measured with the bioanalytical (Summary 
140523DEN176HPL_S_V4. 09 December 2015, 151259DEN176HPL_S_V1. 12 February 2016 and 
151259DEN176HPL_S_V2. 19 April 2017) that had been validated in the Validation Report 
080272VDMW_DEN_R1, which was assessed in the initial marketing authorisation application (see Day 
80 report).
As the validation of these methods have been previously assessed, the present report describes the in-
study validations or the analyses of the study samples in these studies.
Study DU176b-A-U157(Edoxaban Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis To Support Dose Selection in 
Pediatric Study)
The bioanalytical report 141052AKR_DEN for the parent and the metabolite D21-2393 is dated on the 
15 December 2021. The Quality assurance unit of the CRO conducted audits on this study and the 
Quality Assurance (QA) Statement is submitted.
The objective of this study was to determine the concentrations of DU-176 (free form of DU-176b) and 
D21-2393 (M4 main active metabolite) in human plasma samples collected during the clinical study 
DU176b-A-U157. Lithium heparinized human plasma samples were analysed using a specific solid-
phase extraction procedure and turbo ion spray liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC/MS/MS) according to method 140524DEN176HPL_S_V5, which is attached as Appendix A. DU-176-
d6 and D21-2393-d3 were used as Internal Standard (IS).
Twenty-nine runs were employed for the analysis of DU176b and 5 runs were rejected. Thirty runs 
were employed for the analysis of D21-2393 and 5 runs were rejected. The calibration range was 
0.764 to 382 ng/mL for DU-176 and 0.0792 to 7.92 ng/mL for D21-2393, respectively.
All samples of the same subject were assayed in the same batch and in order of ascending time point 
(PK profile order) when possible. Prior to conducting a sample analysis run, a system suitability test, 
consisting of a 15-μL system suitability sample, and a carryover evaluation, consisting of an extracted 
zero sample, an extracted sample at the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), an extracted sample at the 
upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ), and a double blank sample, were injected to check the 
chromatographic performance of the system. The injection sequence consisted of one set (complete 
range of concentrations) of calibration standards at the beginning and one at the end of each analytical 
batch (i.e., duplicates of each concentration, one at the beginning and one at the end). Quality Control 
(QC) samples were distributed throughout the study samples. Study samples and QC samples were 
bracketed between the two sets of calibration standards. Matrix blanks (n≥2) and matrix blank 
samples containing internal standard (n≤10) were included in each run. Selectivity samples were 
positioned after the carryover samples at the beginning of a run.
The within-run carryover evaluation did not meet acceptance criteria in the following runs: Runs 37, 
38, and 56 for DU-176, and Run 51 for D21-2393. In each case, a sample-by-sample carryover 
assessment was conducted for the relevant analyte. These assessments found no study samples 
showing >2.0% possible contribution from the preceding sample.
In Runs 11, 12, and 57, the Carryover LLOQ injection did not meet acceptance for D21-2393 only. Per 
Bioanalysis Study Plan, sample by sample carryover assessments were performed, and no samples 
were affected. Overall carry-over for these runs was acceptable.
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 16/195
Per Bioanalysis Study Plan, a sample by sample carryover assessment was performed following the in-
run carryover assessment for Run 19. One sample was identified as being impacted by carryover. 
However, the sample had a BLQ result. Therefore, carryover was considered acceptable and controlled.
The in-run carryover assessment for Run 20 found a sample isolated from impact by carryover with the 
mitigation zeroes surrounding the sample successfully mitigating carryover to acceptable levels. 
However, pre- and post- run carryover assessments failed; therefore, a sample by sample carryover 
assessment was performed, and no study samples were found to be impacted by carryover.
Carryover in the zero sample immediately following the first standard curve in Run 30 was >20.0% of 
the mean LLOQ response for D21-2393 prompting a sample by sample carryover assessment. No 
study samples showing >2.0% possible contribution from the preceding sample were identified.
The last five wells of the carryover assessment for Run 35 had no acquired data. As a precaution, a 
sample by sample assessment was performed assuming worst case scenario based on carryover data 
produced. No potential impact on study samples was observed.
Assay carryover was appropriately assessed throughout the study and found to be justifiable for batch 
acceptance. Samples were assayed in the order of PK time points. Thus, there was no significant 
sample-to-sample concentration change, which helped to limit the impact of any carryover effect.
The average response of the IS was determined for the standards and QC samples in each run. Any 
study sample with an IS response that was greater than 150.0% of the mean IS response or less than 
50.0% of the mean IS response in the standard and QC samples was evaluated to determine if repeat 
analysis was necessary. No IS-associated repeat analysis was needed.
There were no unexpected experimental results during this study.
There were no modified integrations performed for the current study.
Run 18 was rejected for D21-2393 and DU-176b with assignable cause due to unacceptable 
chromatography. This run successfully re-extracted and repeated as Run 19, following a column 
change and instrument troubleshooting.
Run 24 was rejected for DU-176b with unassignable cause due to QC failure. The calibration standard 
curve exhibited a somewhat exaggerated quadratic fit which may have impacted the QC1 level. Study 
samples from Run 24 were repeated in Run 25, which was acceptable.
Run 37 was rejected for D21-2393 with unassignable cause. QC5 was unacceptable and the IS failed to 
adequately track with the analyte. Study samples from Run 37 were repeated with new QC 
preparations.
Run 39 was rejected for D21-2393 with unassignable cause due to QC failure. The root cause of the 
failure was unknown. Study samples from Run 39 were repeated in Run 40, which was acceptable.
Run 42 was rejected for DU-176b with assignable cause. The analyte was overly quadratic, causing the 
failure of QC5. The cause of failure was determined to be due to extraction. Study samples from Run 
42 were repeated in Run 43, which was acceptable.
Run 45 was rejected for DU-176b with assignable cause due to a curve preparation error. Additionally, 
the dilution QCs in the run failed for both analytes. All diluted study samples were deactivated and 
repeated in a subsequent run.
Run 50 was rejected for D21-2393 with no assignable cause. QC4 failed with no cause of failure 
determined. Run 52 was rejected for both analytes with no assignable cause. There was a positive 
curve bias observed for DU-176b relative to pre-qualified QCs. It was hypothesized that a Carryover 
LLOQ QC may have been aliquoted in place of QC1, contributing to the overall QC failure.
A total of 45 samples for DU-176b and 44 samples for D21-2393 were re-assayed for Incurred Sample 
Reanalysis (ISR). Results for the parent drug were acceptable, with 43 out of 45 samples (95.6%) 
providing acceptable ISR results. The results of the incurred sample reanalysis for D21-2393 were 
acceptable, with 41 out of 44 samples (93.2%) providing acceptable ISR results.

Chromatograms from Runs 1 and 33 for at least 20% of the study subjects (along with the 
corresponding standards and quality control samples) are shown in Appendix E.
Assessor’s comments:
585 samples (including 259 duplicates) were received from 4 May 2017 to 27 Sep 2021 from  Samples 
were stored at -20ºC. 320 samples (including 37 samples of cohort 5) were analysed. Samples were 
analysed as received, within the established freezer stability limit of 793 days at -20 °C. The longest 
storage duration as calculated on an individual sample basis was: 22 August 2015 (collection date) to 
25 July 2017 (sample analysis date) = 703 days.
All lots of compounds used in Study DU176b-A-U157 were used within established expiration dates as 
noted on the Certificates of Analysis.
The calibration curves of DU-176b contained 10 concentration levels in duplicate. One calibrator failed 
in two runs (25 and 39) and both calibrators of the standard (STD), 3 failed in run31. None was the 
LLOQ or the ULOQ. The Inter-run accuracy and precision of the valid calibrators was acceptable.
The calibration curves of D21-2393 contained 7 concentration levels in duplicate. Both calibrators of 
the STD 3 failed in two runs (31 and 40). In run 56 one replicate of STD 1 and 2 failed. But the range 
was not changed since one was acceptable. The Inter-run accuracy and precision of the valid 
calibrators was acceptable. 
The regression was quadratic (Response = A * (Concentration**2) + B * Concentration + C) for DU-
176b and linear for D21-2393.
The QCs of the valid runs passed the acceptance criteria. Four QC levels were tested with three or four 
replicates per concentration level. The failed QCs have not been highlighted but it has been checked 
that not more than 50% per QC level failed (e.g. run 39, 27, 50) and more then 2/3 of QCs are within 
the 15% acceptance range. However, for dilution QCs there were several failures. In run 6, 2 out 3 
failed. In run 30 and 31, 3 out 3 Dilution QC failed. In run 50, 4 out 4 Dilution QC failed. Therefore, the 
4-fold dilution is not valid in those runs. In Runs 6, 30, 31, and 50, DilQC4 did not meet acceptance 
criteria for DU-176b. All diluted samples in the runs were deactivated and repeated at the appropriate 
dilution in a subsequent run. Therefore, this deficiency was handled appropriately.
The number of samples per run is not defined and in some runs there is mixture of subjects samples, 
reanalysis and ISR, which makes impossible to know the number of samples per run in all runs. Later 
on during the procedure, the applicant confirmed that the number of QCs included per run was 
sufficient to cover the number of study samples analysed per run.  
Five samples were repeated for DU-176b because of the concentration was >ULOQ in 2 cases or 
original diluted concentration <LLOQ in 3 cases. These reasons are considered acceptable. Eighteen 
samples were repeated for D21-2393 because of the concentration was >ULOQ in 7 cases or original 
diluted concentration <LLOQ in 11 cases. These reasons are considered acceptable.
The number of samples that needed to be repeated because concentrations were >ULOQ was low. 
However, this is because dilution of samples was conducted also during the original analysis of study 
samples. Some of them were <LLOQ because of excessive dilution. The number of samples that were 
reported after dilution has not been reported. The range may not be optimal for the analytes. It could 
be questioned if the calibration range covered the concentrations of the study adequately, but this 
deficiency is not critical as to reject the study. The QC levels were representative of the calibration 
range since two MQCs were used at 45.8 and 153 ng/ml in addition to the LQC of 2.29 ng/ml and 306 
ng(ml for the HQC for the parent and for the metabolite LQC: 0.238 ng/ml, MQC1: 0.950 ng/ml , 
MQC2: 3.17 ng/ml and HQC: 6.34 ng/ml.
No sample was re-injected or re-integrated in this study.
ISR was conducted in 45 and 44 out of 320 samples, respectively. 14% is more than the 10% required 
by the guideline. In addition ISR is not necessary in all studies, like this one. 95.6% and 93.2%, 
respectively, of the samples differed less than 20%, which is more than the acceptance limit of 66.7%.

Runs 1 and 33 contains chromatograms from subjects. 11 subjects are 16.6% of the 66 subjects of 
study DU176b-A-U157. This value does not represent 20%, but can be considered acceptable because 
20% is required only for bioequivalence studies. For other studies only representative chromatograms 
should be appended to the report. This representative chromatograms have been submitted.
During the procedure, the MAH provided a list of the FDA inspections conducted in the bioanalytical 
site located at 19 Brown Road, Ithaca, New York. The latest inspection was conducted in June 2018, 
and concluded with no findings. This is acceptable.
In study DU176b-D-U312 (A Phase 3, Open-Label, Randomized, Multi-Center, Controlled Trial to 
Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban and to Compare the Efficacy and 
Safety of Edoxaban with Standard of Care Anticoagulant Therapy in Pediatric Subjects from Birth to 
Less Than 18 Years of Age with Confirmed Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)) the plasma 
concentrations of DU-176 and D21-2393 were measured with the bioanalytical method 
140524DEN176HPL_S_V5, which is the same bioanalytical method employed in the previous study.
The bioanalytical report 160607ASMG_DEN for the parent and the metabolite D21-2393 is dated on 
the 15 July 2022. The Quality assurance unit of the CRO conducted audits on this study and the QA 
Statement is submitted.
The objective of this study was to determine the concentrations of DU-176 (free form of DU-176b) and 
D21-2393 in human plasma samples collected during the clinical study DU176b-D-U312. Lithium 
heparinized human plasma samples were analysed using a specific solid-phase extraction procedure 
and turbo ion spray liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). according to 
method 140524DEN176HPL_S_V5, which is attached as Appendix A. DU-176-d6 and D21-2393-d3 were 
used as IS.
Nineteen runs were employed for the analysis of DU176b and D21-2393. The calibration range was 
0.764 to 382 ng/mL for DU-176 and 0.0792 to 7.92 ng/mL for D21-2393, respectively.
All samples of the same subject were assayed in the same batch and in order of ascending time point 
(PK profile order) when possible. Prior to conducting a sample analysis run, a system suitability test, 
consisting of a 30-μL system suitability sample, and a carryover evaluation, consisting of an extracted 
zero sample, an extracted sample at the LLOQ, an extracted sample at the ULOQ, and a double blank 
sample, were injected to check the chromatographic performance of the system. The injection 
sequence consisted of one set (complete range of concentrations) of calibration standards at the 
beginning and one at the end of each analytical batch (i.e., duplicates of each concentration, one at 
the beginning and one at the end). QC samples were distributed throughout the study samples. Study 
samples and QC samples were bracketed between the two sets of calibration standards. Matrix blanks 
(n≥2) and matrix blank samples containing internal standard (n≤10) were included in each run. 
Selectivity samples were positioned after the carryover samples at the beginning of a run.
Extra zero samples (mitigation zero samples) were inserted into the Watson worklist after the high 
standards and QC samples as a precaution against the impact of carryover on the data. Additionally, 
the study samples were assayed in pharmacokinetic (PK) order.
The within-run carryover evaluation did not meet acceptance criteria in Runs 7, 9, 14, 16, 18, and 19 
for D21-2393. In each case, a sample-by-sample carryover assessment was conducted for the relevant 
analyte. One sample in Run 16, Day 5 0h, was determined to have >2.0% possible contribution from 
the preceding sample. This sample was deactivated and repeated in a Run 18.
In Runs 20 and 21, carryover >20.0% of the mean LLOQ response was observed for D21-2393 in the 
first reconstitution blank in the run, prompting a sample-by-sample carryover assessment. No study 
samples reported from these runs had >2.0% possible contribution from the preceding sample.
Assay carryover was appropriately assessed throughout the study and found to be justifiable for batch 
acceptance. Samples were assayed in the order of PK time points. Thus, there was no significant 
sample-to-sample concentration change, which helped to limit the impact of any carryover effect.
The average response of the IS was determined for the standards and QC samples in each run. Any 
study sample with an IS response that was greater than 150.0% of the mean IS response or less than 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 19/195
50.0% of the mean IS response in the standard and QC samples was evaluated to determine if repeat 
analysis was necessary.
In Run 13, one sample, Day 5 0.5h, included as an analytical repeat, had D21-2393 internal standard 
response >150.0%. This sample was deactivated and repeated in Run 16.
A total of 43 samples for DU-176 and D21-2393 were re-assayed for ISR.
In Run 1, ten pre-dose study samples had >LLOQ results for both analytes. At the request of the 
sponsor these samples were repeated in duplicate in Run 3, and again using the back-up samples in 
Run 4. The original results were confirmed and reported.
In Run 6 the QC5 sample did not meet acceptance criteria for D21-2393. This QC had been previously 
qualified for use in sample analysis but had been showing a trend toward increasing positive bias. A 
new QC5 sample was prepared and qualified following this run using a preparation scheme that 
minimized the amount of organic solvent in the preparation. All samples from this run were repeated 
for D21-2393 in Run 7.
The QC3 sample in Run 10 did not meet acceptance criteria for DU-176. The DU-176 calibration curve 
was atypically quadratic in this run and this contributed to the QC failure.
In Run 11, the QC5 sample did not meet acceptance criteria for D21-2393 and the run was rejected for 
this analyte. There was a drop in internal standard response at this QC level which is typical for the 
method but was more pronounce in this run. The impacted samples were reanalyzed for D21-2393 in 
Run 13.
In Run 13 it appears the third and fourth replicates of the QC2 and DilQC4 samples were aliquoted in 
reverse order however this could not be confirmed. The run was analytically acceptable. A similar 
aliquoting issue appears to have occurred in Run 15 for the fourth replicate of the QC2 sample and the 
third replicate of the QC3 sample. This run was also analytically acceptable. This had no impact on the 
results for this study.
In Run 14, review of the run data indicated the calibration standard curve was prepared high for DU-
176 and QC samples showed a negative bias. The run was rejected for this analyte. All samples from 
this run were repeated for this analyte in Run 15.
Run 20 was rejected for DU-176 as the QC1 sample did not meet the acceptance criteria. No cause 
was determined. 
Run 22 was rejected for D21-2393. The QC1 sample did not meet acceptance criteria and no cause 
was determined. It was noted that overall signal for this analyte was low in the run. All samples from 
this run were repeated for D21-2393 in Run 22.
All samples were repeated for DU-176 in Run 11.
There were no modified integrations performed for the current study.
The results of the incurred sample reanalysis for DU-176 were acceptable, with 37 out of 43 samples 
(86.0%) providing acceptable ISR results. The results of the incurred sample reanalysis for D21-2393 
were acceptable, with 42 out of 42 samples (100.0%) providing acceptable ISR results.
The total number of ISR included for D21-2393 analysis was 43; however, when ISR was assessed in 
Run 8, one sample, Day 5, 0.5 hour, which was diluted for the original analysis but analyzed undiluted 
for the ISR assessment, had a result >ULOQ. This sample was considered unreportable for ISR. The 42 
remaining ISR met the total number for assessment as required. Overall ISR was acceptable for both 
analytes.

Oct 2019 to 8 Feb 2021, and the 13 Jan 2020, from 13 Oct 2021 to 8 Dec 2021 Samples were stored 
at -20ºC. 147 samples were analysed. Samples were analysed as received, within the established 
freezer stability limit of 793 days at -20 °C. The longest storage duration as calculated on an individual 
sample basis was: 23 January 2018 (collection date) to 08 November 2018 (sample analysis date) = 
289 days.
All lots of compounds used in Study DU176b-D-U312 were used within established expiration dates as 
noted on the Certificates of Analysis (see Appendix B) with the exception of internal standard D21-
1553, lot D21-1553-01. Internal standard reference compounds do not require expiration or retest 
dates and may be used beyond any such dates if no interferences are observed in blank and zero 
samples and chromatographic peak response is adequate for the method. The internal standard 
reference compound for DU-176 (D21-1553; DU-176-d6) was used beyond its expiration date to 
prepare the internal standard working solution used in Runs 23 and 24 of this study. DU-176 internal 
standard response was typical and no interferences were observed.
The calibration curves of DU-176b contained 10 concentration levels in duplicate. One calibrator was 
removed due to low analyte response and IS response, but the other replicate of the LLOQ was valid. 
In run 22 the two replicates of STD 8failed, which did not affect the range. The Inter-run accuracy and 
precision of the valid calibrators was acceptable.
The calibration curves of D21-2393 contained 7 concentration levels in duplicate. One of the replicates 
of the LLOQ failed in 2 runs and in another it was removed due to low analyte and IS response. The 
other replicate was valid and the range was not altered. The Inter-run accuracy and precision of the 
valid calibrators was acceptable. 
The regression was quadratic (Response = A * (Concentration**2) + B * Concentration + C) for DU-
176b and linear for D21-2393.
The QCs of the valid runs passed the acceptance criteria both for the analyte and the metabolite. Four 
QC levels were tested with three or four replicates per concentration level. The failed QCs have not 
been highlighted but it has been checked that not more than 50% per QC level failed (e.g. run 11, 13, 
15, 17) and more then 2/3 of QCs are within the 15% acceptance range. However, for dilution QCs 
(ten-fold dilution) in run 16, 3 out of 4 QCs failed. In run 13 only 2 out of 4. That run dilution was then 
acceptable. The inter-run precision failed for the metabolite QC2 and DilQC. This was due to outlier 
values. After excluding these few values the precision and accuracy was acceptable.
It is not possible to know if the number of QCs are adequate with respect to the total number of study 
samples because although 12 or 16 QCs are used per run, the number of study samples per run are 
not defined in the bioanalytical study report. Later on during the procedure, the applicant confirmed 
that the number of QCs included per run was sufficient to cover the number of study samples analysed 
per run.
Eleven samples were repeated for DU-176 because of the concentration was >ULOQ in 1 case or 10 
because reanalysis was requested by the sponsor due to PK outlier, but the initial values were reported 
finally. Then, the reported results are considered valid.
Twenty samples were repeated for D21-2393 because of the concentration was >ULOQ in 8 cases or 
original diluted concentration <LLOQ in 2 cases. In 10m cases the PK repeat was caused by the outlier 
values, but the initial results were finally reported. This is considered acceptable.
The number of samples that needed to be repeated because concentrations were >ULOQ was low. 
However, this is because dilution of samples was conducted also during the original analysis of study 
samples. Some of them were <LLOQ because of excessive dilution. The number of samples that were 
reported after dilution has not been reported. The range may not be optimal for the analytes. It could 
be questioned if the calibration range covered the concentrations of the study adequately, but this 
deficiency is not critical as to reject the study.
The QC levels were representative of the calibration range since two MQCs were used at 45.8 and 153 
ng/ml in addition to the LQC of 2.29 ng/ml and 306 ng(ml for the HQC for the parent and for the 
metabolite LQC: 0.238 ng/ml, MQC1: 0.950 ng/ml , MQC2: 3.17 ng/ml and HQC: 6.34 ng/ml.
No sample was re-injected or re-integrated in this study.

In study DU176b-D-U313 (An Open-Label, Randomized, Parallel-Group, Multicentre, Observational 
Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of Edoxaban Tosylate in Children from 38 Weeks Gestational Age 
to Less Than 18 Years of Age with Cardiac Diseases at Risk of Thromboembolic Events) the plasma 
concentrations of DU-176b (edoxaban tosylate) and the metabolite D21-2393 (edoxaban 4-carboxylic 
acid) were measured with the bioanalytical method no. 140524DEN176HPL_S_V5, which is the same 
bioanalytical method employed in the previous studies.
The bioanalytical report 180260AKR_DEN for the parent and the metabolite D21-2393 is dated on the 
15 14 April 2022. The Quality assurance unit of the CRO conducted audits on this study and the QA 
Statement is submitted.
The objective of this study was to determine the concentrations of DU-176 (free form of DU-176b) and 
D21-2393 in human plasma samples collected during the clinical study DU176b-C-U313. Lithium 
heparinized human plasma samples were analyzed using a specific solid-phase extraction procedure 
and turbo ion spray liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) according to 
method 140524DEN176HPL_S_V5, which is attached as Appendix A. DU-176-d6 and D21-2393-d3 
were used as IS.
Eight runs were employed for the analysis of DU176b and D21-2393 and 1 run was rejected. The 
calibration range was 0.764 to 382 ng/mL for DU-176 and 0.0792 to 7.92 ng/mL for D21-2393, 
respectively.
All samples of the same subject were assayed in the same batch and in order of ascending time point 
(PK profile order) when possible. Prior to conducting a sample analysis run, a system suitability test, 
consisting of a 30-μL system suitability sample, and a carryover evaluation, consisting of an extracted 
zero sample, an extracted sample at the LLOQ, an extracted sample at the ULOQ, and a double blank 
sample, were injected to check the chromatographic performance of the system. The injection 
sequence consisted of one set (complete range of concentrations) of calibration standards at the 
beginning and one at the end of each analytical batch (i.e., duplicates of each concentration, one at 
the beginning and one at the end). QC samples were distributed throughout the study samples. Study 
samples and QC samples were bracketed between the two sets of calibration standards. Matrix blanks 
(n≥2) and matrix blank samples containing internal standard (n≤10) were included in each run. 
Selectivity samples were positioned after the carryover samples at the beginning of a run.
The within-run carryover evaluation did not meet acceptance criteria in the following runs: Run 2 for 
D21-2393. In each case, a sample-by-sample carryover assessment was conducted for the relevant 
analyte. These assessments found no study samples showing >2.0% possible contribution from the 
preceding sample.
A sample by sample carryover assessment was performed following the in-run carryover assessment 
for Run 8. Three samples were identified as being impacted by carryover in Run 8. The affected 
samples were repeated in Run 9. Though carryover did not meet acceptance in Run 9 and a sample by 
sample carryover assessment was performed, none of the repeat samples showed >2.0% possible 
contribution from the preceding sample.
A sample by sample carryover assessment was performed following the in-run carryover assessment 
for Run 9. Two samples were identified as being impacted by carryover. The affected samples were 
repeated in Run 10 in which carryover met acceptance.
Assay carryover was appropriately assessed throughout the study and found to be justifiable for batch 
acceptance. Samples were assayed in the order of PK time points. Thus, there was no significant 
sample-to-sample concentration change, which helped to limit the impact of any carryover effect.

Run 6 was rejected for DU-176b (D21-2393 was not assessed in the run) with unassignable cause. The 
data suggest that the failure was extraction related as instrument parameters and thepeak area ratio 
were consistent with passing runs.
No IS-associated repeat analysis was needed.
There were no unexpected experimental results during this study.
There were no modified integrations performed for the current study.
A total of 20 samples for DU-176b and 32 samples for D21-2393 were reassayed for ISR. The results 
of the incurred sample reanalysis for DU-176b were acceptable, with 19 out of 20 samples (95.0%) 
providing acceptable ISR results. The results of the incurred sample reanalysis for D21-2393 were 
acceptable, with 30 out of 32 samples (93.8%) providing acceptable ISR results.
Chromatograms from Runs 1 for at least 20% of the study subjects (along with the corresponding 
standards and quality control samples) are shown in Appendix E.
Assessor’s comments:
274 samples (including 120 duplicates) were received from 7 Sep 2018 to 22 Jul 2022 from 4 May 
2017 to 27 Sep 2021 from, on 04 Apr 2019 and 16 Jul 2021 and on the 29 Jul 2019 and 3 Sep 2019. 
Samples were stored at -20ºC. 152 samples were analysed. Samples were analysed as received, 
within the established freezer stability limit of 793 days at -20 °C. The longest storage duration as 
calculated on an individual sample basis was: 17 April 2019 (collection date) to 16 September 2020 
(sample analysis date) = 518 days.
All lots of compounds used in Study DU176b-C-U313 were used within established expiration dates as 
noted on the Certificates of Analysis
The calibration curves of DU-176b contained 10 concentration levels in duplicate. No calibrator failed. 
The Inter-run accuracy and precision of the valid calibrators was acceptable.
The calibration curves of D21-2393 contained 7 concentration levels in duplicate. The Applicant 
claimed that there were 8 valid or accepted calibration curves, but 9 are reported. Both calibrators of 
the STD 3 failed in run 5 and one failed run 8 but the other calibrator of the same concentration was 
valid. The range was not changed. The Inter-run accuracy and precision of the valid calibrators was 
acceptable.
The regression was quadratic (Response = A * (Concentration**2) + B * Concentration + C) for DU-
176b and linear for D21-2393.
The QCs of the valid runs passed the acceptance criteria. Four QC levels were tested with four 
replicates per concentration level. The failed QCs have not been highlighted but it has been checked 
that not more than 50% per QC level failed since only Qc failed in total for the parent and none for the 
metabolite. However, for runs 8 of the parent, all Dilution QCs failed. Two dilution QCs failed in run 2 
and 7. During the procedure, the MAH indicated that there were samples analysed with dilution for DU-
176b in Run 8. However, due to dilution QC failure in this run, the results for those samples were 
deactivated (those affected samples were subsequently repeated within Run 9). 
The number of samples per run is not defined and in some runs there is mixture of subjects samples, 
reanalysis and ISR, which makes impossible to know the number of samples per run in all runs. Later 
on during the procedure, the applicant confirmed that the number of QCs included per run was 
sufficient to cover the number of study samples analysed per run.
Three samples were repeated for DU-176b and D21-2393 because of the concentration was >ULOQ in 
1 case or original diluted concentration <LLOQ in 2 cases. These reasons are considered acceptable.
The number of samples that needed to be repeated because concentrations were >ULOQ was low. 
However, this is because dilution of samples was conducted also during the original analysis of study 
samples. Some of them were <LLOQ because of excessive dilution. The number of samples that were 
reported after dilution has not been reported. The range may not be optimal for the analytes. It could 
be questioned if the calibration range covered the concentrations of the study adequately, but this

deficiency is not critical as to reject the study. The QC levels were representative of the calibration 
range since two MQCs were used at 45.8 and 153 ng/ml in addition to the LQC of 2.29 ng/ml and 306 
ng(ml for the HQC for the parent and for the metabolite LQC: 0.238 ng/ml, MQC1: 0.950 ng/ml , 
MQC2: 3.17 ng/ml and HQC: 6.34 ng/ml.
No sample was re-injected or re-integrated in this study.
ISR was conducted in 20 out of 152 samples, respectively. These are more than the 10% required by 
the guideline. In addition ISR is not necessary in all studies, like this one. ISR passed the acceptance 
criterion.
Representative chromatograms have been submitted. In addition, the chromatograms of 1 run 
containing 23 subjects have been submitted. It is not necessary to submit chromatograms of 20% of 
the subjects since this is not a bioequivalence study.
6.2.  Bioequivalence (and food effect)
A Phase 1 relative bioavailability and food effect study (Study DU176b-A-U154) has been conducted in 
healthy adult subjects for the paediatric formulation, edoxaban oral granules. According to the 
applicant, the CSR of Study DU176b-A-U154 was included in the application for Marketing 
Authorisation for Lixiana submitted to the EMA on 07 January 2014. However, in the initial submission 
only the synopsis was submitted and the full study report was requested on day 120. This study was 
not described in the assessment report since it was not considered essential for the initial marketing 
authorisation. In the present submission, this study supports the granulate for oral suspension 
formulation administered to the paediatric population, but the marketing authorisation of this 
formulation is not applied for. Therefore, this study is only descriptive and supportive. The deficiencies 
identified in this study should be solved if this product was applied for marketing. However, these 
deficiencies are not critical currently.
Study title: An Open-Label, Randomized, 3-Way Crossover Study in Healthy Adult Subjects to Assess 
the Relative Bioavailability and Food Effect for a Novel Liquid Oral Suspension of Edoxaban.
Study code: Study DU176b-A-U154.
Dates of the clinical phase: First subject first visit date: 09 Jun 2013. Last subject last follow-up date: 
10 Jul 2013. Dosing days can be deduced to be 9, 16 and 23 June 2013 based on the check-in dates.
Dates of the bioanalytical phase: Not available.
Primary objective: 
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of edoxaban when dosed as a liquid oral suspension under 
fasting conditions
• To evaluate the relative bioavailability of the liquid oral suspension with respect to the 30 mg oral 
tablet, both dosed at 60 mg under fasting conditions
• To evaluate the effect of food on the rate and extent of exposure of edoxaban dosed as a liquid oral 
suspension
Design: This was an open-label, 3-treatment, 3-way crossover study. Subjects were randomised to 1 
of 6 treatment sequences. Each treatment period was separated by a washout of at least 7 days 
between dosing days.
Treatments: On Day 1 of each treatment period, following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, 
subjects were administered 1 of the following treatments according to the assigned sequence:
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 24/195
• Treatment A: Single oral dose of 2 × 30-mg tablets of edoxaban dosed under fasting conditions; Lot 
No.: DU176F1H12T10. Expiration Date: Jun 2017.
• Treatment B: Single oral dose of 10 mL of 6-mg/mL edoxaban oral suspension dosed under fasting 
conditions. Lot No.: 3318V13009. Expiration Date: Mar 2014.
• Treatment C: Single oral dose of 10 mL of 6-mg/mL edoxaban oral suspension dosed after a Food 
and Drug Administration standard high-fat, high-calorie breakfast (i.e., approximately 800 to 1000 
calories total with approximately 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and 
fat, respectively). Lot No.: 3318V13009. Expiration Date: Mar 2014.
Wash-out period: 7 days.
Sample size: 24 healthy adult subjects. Twenty-three subjects completed the study, and 1 subject 
withdrew consent prior to completion. Subject 1013 withdrew consent prior to receiving Treatment B. 
This subject received Treatment C in Period 1 and did not receive Treatments A or B.
Sampling times: at predose (0) and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 24, 30, 36, 
48, and 52 hours after dosing of each period.
Analytes: Edoxaban and its metabolite D21-2393
PK methods: Plasma concentration time data were analyzed using non-compartmental methods. The 
following parameters were estimated for edoxaban: Cmax, tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, t½, CL/F, Vz/F, 
and Frel (Treatment B vs Treatment A; Treatment C vs Treatment B). For D21-2393, the following 
parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods, as data permitted: Cmax, tmax, 
AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, t½, and metabolite to parent drug ratio for AUC0-inf. Pharmacokinetic data were 
analyzed using noncompartmental methods in Phoenix WinNonlin® (Version 6.3, Pharsight 
Corporation).
Statistical methods: The peak (Cmax) and total exposures (AUC0-last, AUC0-inf) were compared 
between Treatments A and B (bioavailability) and Treatments B and C (food effect), using a mixed 
effect model for the ln-transformed values of Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf with fixed effects for 
treatment sequence, period and treatment, and subject nested sequence fitted as a random effect. A 
90% confidence interval (CI) was constructed for the ratio of geometric least squares means for each 
comparison.
Assessor’s comments:
The suspension is actually a granulate for oral suspension.
The appendices to the clinical study report are not submitted. The Applicant should have submitted all 
appendices of the clinical study report, including the bioanalytical study report as well as the method 
validation report of the bioanalytical method employed in study DU176b-A-U154.
Due to the lack of the study appendices it is not possible to confirm the date of the protocol and its 
potential amendments, the date of IRB approval, the dates of product administration, the dates of the 
bioanalytical phase, etc.
Version 1.0 of the protocol, dated 28 Mar 2013, was amended and Version 2.0 of the protocol was 
released on 31 May 2013 (prior to subject dosing).
The Applicant should have submittted the monitoring reports of study DU176b-A-U154 and the list of 
regulatory inspections conducted in the clinical and bioanalytical centres.
The Applicant should have clarified if the QA unit of the CRO audited this study

The Applicant should have submitted the Certificate of Analysis of the batches investigated in study 
DU176b-A-U154.
The Clinical study report does not define the non-compartmental method employed to calculate AUC. 
As the protocol is not submitted, it is not possible to know if at least the protocol identifies the planned 
method for AUC estimation.
The software employed for PK calculations is considered acceptable.
The mean and individual concentration – time curves have been submitted within the CSR in the 
original scale and semi-log-scale. The values of the concentration – times profiles as also been 
submitted in tabulated form.
Concentrations at time zero were BLOQ, but as the BLOQ or sensitivity of the bioanalytical method has 
not been included in the CSR the adequacy of the bioanalytical method cannot be known. The LLOQ 
should be lower than 4.72 ng/ml in order to be able to detect concentrations of 5% of the minimum 
Cmax of the parent drug.
Sampling frequency was adequate since Tmax was not observed in the first sampling time and the 
percentage of extrapolated AUC was lower than 20% in all cases.
Actual sample times were used for calculation of all plasma PK parameters.
The CSR does not define the statistical software employed for the analysis of the study results, but it 
seems to be SAS. This statistical software is considered adequate.
The ANOVA model included the conventional sources of variation: treatment, period, sequence and 
subjects(sequence). The PROC MIXED (i.e. mixed effect model) was used. As subjects with missing 
data were excluded, the obtained results should agree with those obtained with PROC GLM. As the 
Statistical appendix has not been attached and the CSR does not include the SAS output, it is not 
possible to know if the correct analysis was conducted. The comparisons (suspension vs. tablet and fed 
vs. fasted) should have been conducted by excluding the other third treatment of the study.
Results
Twenty-four subjects were enrolled and completed the study, according to the Summary of Clinical 
Pharmacology Studies, but only 23 completed the study according to the CSR.
The geometric least square means for exposure parameters and statistical comparisons between the 2 
× 30-mg reference tablets and 60-mg test oral granules are summarised in Table 3.3. The total 
exposure (AUC from time zero to the last measurable concentration [AUC0-last] and AUC0-inf) of 
edoxaban was comparable for the 60-mg oral granules (Treatment B) and the 2 × 30-mg tablets 
(Treatment A), but the Cmax was approximately 13% lower, with the lower bound of 90% CI outside 
the 80% to 125% bioequivalence range.
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 26/195
Overall systemic exposure to the metabolite (D21-2393) relative to that observed for the parent 
(edoxaban), based on AUC0-inf, was 9.64% for Treatment A and 9.65% for Treatment B under fasting 
conditions.
The geometric least square means for exposure parameters and statistical comparisons between the 
60 mg oral granules fed conditions (Treatment C and test product) and fasting conditions (Treatment B 
and reference product) are summarised in Table 3.4. The geometric mean ratios and 90% CIs for 
Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf were within the 80% to 125% range, indicating an absence of food 
effect on edoxaban exposure following administration of the oral granules.
The median tmax for Edoxaban 60 mg Suspension under fed conditions (2.50 h) was delayed by 1 h, 
relative to that for the fasting state (1.50 h).

EMA/564306/2023
Page 27/195
Overall systemic exposure to the metabolite (D21-2393) relative to that observed for the parent 
(edoxaban), based on AUC0-inf, was 8.04% for of edoxaban 60 mg suspension Treatment C, which 
was slightly lower than that observed for Treatments A and B.
Safety: Edoxaban was well tolerated in healthy subjects. There were no deaths, serious AEs (SAEs), or 
discontinuations due to an AE. All treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) resolved without sequelae. A total 
of 9 TEAEs were reported by 7 (29.2%) of the 24 subjects in this study. Overall, 2 subjects (8.7%) 
reported 2 TEAEs following Treatment A, 3 subjects (13.0%) reported 3 TEAEs following Treatment B, 
and 4 subjects (16.7%) reported 4 TEAEs following Treatment C. Most TEAEs were mild in severity 
with the exception of disturbance of attention (moderate, related to edoxaban) reported in 1 subject 
following Treatment C. None of the TEAEs reported following Treatment A or Treatment B was 
considered related to edoxaban; 3 TEAEs reported following Treatment C were considered related to 
edoxaban. No clinically significant laboratory values, ECG values, or vital sign abnormalities were 
reported.
Palatability Results: Overall, Treatment B was highly palatable, with mean scores >80 mm for 
palatability, bitterness, and sweetness, and mean score of 79.3 mm for overall taste. Eleven (47.8%) 
of the 23 subjects who received Treatment B scored aroma as neutral (approximately 50 mm); with 
the exception of 1 subject (9.7 mm), all other individual scores were in the upper half of the possible 
score range.
Protocol deviations: All deviations were considered minor and were not expected to have a significant 
impact on the clinical and PK assessments. Minor protocol deviations included excursions from the 
sample collection and sample processing time windows.
Assessor’s comments:
The results reported by the company cannot be reproduced in PROC GLM in SAS is employed. No 
matter if all the data is combined in a single ANOVA or if the comparisons are conducted deleting the 
data from the other third treatment.

The results are similar and the conclusions are the same.
The suspension has shown to be bioequivalent with respect to extent of absorption and exhibits a 
lower Cmax. The clinical relevance of this difference should be addressed in the PK/PD or efficacy 
analysis.
The high-fat high-calorie meal does not affect the bioavailability of the suspension significantly. The 
oral suspension could be taken with or without food.
The deviations do not seem to affect the validity of the study conclusions.
The limit sample size of a bioequivalence study cannot detect any difference in the safety or tolerability 
profile. However, due to similar extent of exposure and lower Cmax, the systemic safety profile is 
expected to be similar.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Single-Dose Edoxaban in Paediatric Patients 
(DU176b-A-U157)
Study  DU176b-A-U157  was  a  Phase  1,  open-label,  single-dose,  nonrandomised,  multiple  centre,  PK, 
and PD study in paediatric patients. 
The goal of Study DU176b-A-U157 was to provide information related to the following objectives:
Primary:
• To characterize the PK of edoxaban in pediatric patients following single-dose oral administration
Secondary:
• To evaluate the PD effects of edoxaban in pediatric patients following single-dose oral administration
•  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  single-dose  oral  administration  of  edoxaban  in  pediatric 
patients
•  To  assess  metabolite  exposure  (D21-2393,  D21-3231,  D21-1402,  and  D21-2135)  in  pediatric 
patients
•  To  evaluate  the  palatability  (bitterness,  sweetness,  and  overall  taste  or  aroma)  of  the  liquid  oral 
suspension of edoxaban
The study included 5 paediatric age cohorts with evaluation of 2 different doses within each age cohort 
(low and high doses), as listed below (Table 3.6). Each patient received a single oral dose on Day 1. 
In each age cohort, appropriate doses were selected to achieve exposures comparable to adult doses 
of 30 mg (low-dose groups) and 60 mg (high-dose groups). The doses (mg/kg) for patients younger 
than 6 years were based on patients’ body weight. Patients in 12 to <18 years of age cohort received 
multiple  edoxaban  tablets  of  15-  or  30-mg  strength.  Patients  younger  than  12  years  received 
edoxaban granules for oral suspension. Patients were asked to fast for at least 4 hours before dosing 
and for an additional 2 hours after dosing.
Table 3.6: Edoxaban Dose by Cohort in Study DU176b-A-U157
Seven  serial  blood  PK  samples  were  collected  from  Cohort  1  on  the  basis  of  a  sampling  window 
approach: 0.25 to 1, 1.5 to 3, 3.5 to 6, 6.5 to 8, 8.5 to 14, 24 to 36, and 48 to 54 hours after dosing.

Five sparse blood PK samples were collected from Cohorts 2 and 3. Four and three blood PK samples 
were  collected  from  Cohorts  4  and  5,  respectively.  Sampling  scheme  could  have  been  adjusted  for 
various  age  cohorts  based  on  emerging  PK  and  safety  data.  PD  sampling  was  concurrent  with  PK 
sampling.
Edoxaban  was  absorbed  rapidly  and  the  highest  plasma  concentration  of  edoxaban  was  observed 
within 0.5 to 3 hours after oral administration in all age cohorts in both the high- and low-dose groups. 
The  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  for  different  age  cohorts  were  found  to  be  visually  similar 
(Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2).

Across  all  cohorts,  mean  PT,  aPTT,  and  anti-FXa  values  increased  following  edoxaban  administration 
with peak values observed approximately 1.5 to 3 hours after dosing followed by a rapid decrease until 
4 to 8 hours after dosing and a slower decline after 8 hours.
The PD (anti-FXa, aPTT, and PT) versus edoxaban plasma concentration relationships were compared 
among 5 paediatric cohorts (Figure 3.4).

PopPK analysis
Analysis objectives:


To establish a preliminary edoxaban population PK (PopPK) model in pediatric patients aged 0 - 
<18 years of age
To  conduct  PK  simulations  and  propose  dose  regimens  for  each  subsequent  dose  cohort  and 
also for the same age cohort in study DU176b-A-U312
A  PopPK  model  has  been  established  previously  for  edoxaban  in  the  adult  patient  population.  The 
current  PK  analysis  for  the  ongoing  pediatric  studies  used  a  Bayesian  estimation  approach  [software 
Stan® with Torsten, a collection of Stan functions to facilitate analysis of pharmacometrics data (2, 3)] 
by incorporating the information from the edoxaban adult PK model as well as the experts’ cumulative

Page 34/195
belief in certain PK parameters (Figure 1). Initially the adult PopPK model was modified to derive the 
PK model for pediatric subjects age 2– <18 years.
Subsequently,  the  model  was  further  modified  to  fit  the  data  from  younger  subjects.  Using  Stan, 
Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  sampling  of  the  posterior  distribution  of  the  PopPK  model 
parameters was implemented. Diagnostics such as trace plots were used to determine if convergence 
was reached.
Based on the adult exposure response analysis, it was proposed that the pediatric dose for a specific 
age  cohort  will  be  considered  appropriate  if  the  median  estimated  exposure  at  the  pediatric  dose  is 
within the 0.5 to 1.5-fold of the median predicted exposure in adult VTE subjects at 60 mg QD dose.
Table 3 presents that number of subjects in each age cohort by study. Table 4 presents the summary 
of the continuous covariates of interest.

The edoxaban pediatric PK was best described by a 2-compartment model with allometric body weight 
exponents (0.75 for clearances and 1 for volumes). The model that incorporated a maturation function 
for clearance (via a post-menstrual age (PMA) effect on CL) demonstrated an improved fit to the data 
(Table 2). The final population PK parameters are presented in Table 5.

The individual estimates of AUC0-inf are summarised by cohort and dose level in Table 3.7. The CL/F 
increased with age/body weight and the mean PK exposures for different age cohorts were similar. For 
each age cohort, the mean exposure increased proportionally with dose in a dose range of 30 to 60 mg 
in patients of 12 to <18 years, 24 to 45 mg in patients of 6 to <12 years, 0.7 to 1.4 mg/kg in patients 
of  2  to  <6  years,  0.75  to  1.5  mg/kg  in  patients  of  6  months  to  <2  years,  and  0.4  to  0.8  mg/kg  in 
patients of 0 to < 6 months old. Across all cohorts, the median exposure was within the 0.5- to 1.5-
fold of the exposure in adults VTE patients receiving corresponding doses (30 mg QD for low dose and 
60 mg QD for high dose) (Figure 3.3).

Pharmacokinetics  and  Pharmacodynamics  of  Edoxaban 
in  Paediatric  Patients  with 
Confirmed Venous Thromboembolism (DU176b-D-U312)
Study  DU176b-D-U312  was  an  event-driven  Phase  3,  prospective,  randomised,  open-label,  blinded 
endpoint  evaluation  (PROBE),  parallel-group  study  in  paediatric  subjects  with  confirmed  VTE.  This 
study was designed to evaluate the PK and PD of edoxaban and to compare the efficacy and safety of 
edoxaban with standard of care (standard of care, including LMWH, vitamin K antagonist, or synthetic 
pentasaccharide Xa inhibitors) in paediatric subjects with confirmed VTE.
Sequential enrollment of age cohorts was used for randomisation. The order of enrolment was from the 
oldest age cohort to the youngest age cohort. Starting doses of edoxaban for each age cohort in this 
study (Table 3.8) was selected on the basis of edoxaban exposure for age-matched subjects and safety 
data  from  DU176b-A-U157  study  and  on  PopPK  analyses.  Edoxaban  was  supplied  on  a  1-month 
treatment interval as tablets (15- and/or 30-mg strengths) or granules for oral suspension 60 mg (6

same time every day, with or without food.

Sparse  PK/PD  samples  were  collected  on  the  day  of  the  fifth  dose  of  edoxaban  (Day  5  +  3  days). 
Predose PK samples were collected from all participating subjects. Postdose PK samples were taken at 
either  any  time  between  0.5  to  3  hours  after  dosing  or  any  time  between  3  to  8  hours  after  dosing. 
The PD sampling time on Day 5 for measurement of PT, aPTT, and anti-FXa was the same time as the 
PK sampling time.
Plasma concentrations for edoxaban are summarised in Table 3.9.

Compared with predose levels, edoxaban treatment increased the levels of PT, aPTT, and anti-FXa in 
patients  from  birth  to  <18  years  old.  A  plot  of  plasma  edoxaban  concentration  and  anti-FXa

Study  DU176b-C-U313  was  a  Phase  3,  open-label,  randomised,  parallel-group,  multicenter, 
observational  study  to  evaluate  and  to  compare  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  edoxaban  against  SOC 
anticoagulants  [LMWH,  unfractionated  heparin,  and  vitamin  K  antagonists]  in  subjects  with  cardiac 
conditions at risk of thromboembolic events who require anticoagulation.
The  doses  of  edoxaban  for  each  age  cohort  in  this  study were  selected  based  on  edoxaban  exposure 
for  age-matched  subjects  and  safety  data  from  DU176b-A-U157  study  and  on  PopPK  analyses.  The 
age-  and  body  weight-based  doses  were  the  same  as  that  used  in  Study  DU176b-  D-U312  (Table 
3.8).  Edoxaban  was  supplied  in  1-month  treatment  intervals  as  tablets  (15  mg  and/or  30  mg 
strengths)  or  granules  for  oral  suspension  (60  mg,  6  mg/mL).  Subjects  were  instructed  to  take 
edoxaban  (tablets  or  granules)  orally  once  a  day  (QD),  at  the  same  time  every  day,  with  or  without 
food.
Predose PD samples for measurement of PT, aPTT, and anti-FXa were collected from study participants 
on  Day  1.  Sparse  PK/PD  samples  were  collected  during  Month  1  visit  (Day  30  ±  5  days).  During  the 
visit,  one  predose  PK  sample  was  collected  and  one  postdose  PK  sample  was  taken  at  any  time 
between  1  to  3  hours  after  dosing.  For  an  individual  subject,  PD  samples  and  PK  samples  were 
collected at the same time points during Month 1 visit.
Plasma concentrations for edoxaban are summarised in Table 3.11.

Population PK-PD and Exposure-Response Modeling with Simulations of Edoxaban
The objectives of the analysis were as follows:
• To develop a population PK model for edoxaban that describes data pooled from pediatric patients
• To compare the exposure of edoxaban in pediatric and adult patient populations
•  To  develop  a  population  PKPD  model  to  describe  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (APTT) 
behavior due to edoxoban administration in pediatric patients
•  To  develop  a  population  PKPD  model  to  describe  prothrombin  time  (PT)  behavior  due  to  edoxoban 
administration in pediatric patients
•  To  develop  a  population  PKPD  model  to  describe  anti-activated  factor  X  (AFXA)  behavior  due  to 
edoxoban administration in pediatric patients
• To compare the PK-PD relationships in pediatric and adult patient populations
•  To  use  population  PK,  PKPD,  and  exposure-response  analyses  to  evaluate  dosing  options  in  the 
pediatric patients
The following clinical studies were included in the pharmacometrics analyses of edoxaban:

Table: Clinical Studies Included in the Analysis
For the population PK analysis, an individual was defined as evaluable if both of the following criteria 
were satisfied:
1. Received at least one dose of Edoxaban
2. Had at least one measurable Edoxaban concentration observation with associated sampling time and 
dosing information
For the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis, an individual was defined as evaluable if 
both of the following criteria were satisfied:
1. Had at least one PD measurement with associated sampling time
2. Had individual PK parameter estimates from the population PK analysis
The PK analysis of edoxaban data included 208 subjects with 589 measurable PK observations.
The  edoxaban  dose  was  adjusted  depending  on  age.  In  the  U157  study,  patients  were  each  given  a 
single dose, while U312 and U313 utilized QD dose regimens. The dose normalized concentration-time

Since all the studies in the analysis included only pediatric subjects, the effects of postmenstrual age 
(PMA) on clearance were tested for possible inclusion in the population PK (popPK) model. The effects 
of  PMA  and  eGFR  on  clearance  were  each  significant.  Therefore,  both  the  PMA  and  eGFR  effects  on 
clearance were added to the base model.
The effects of body weight on CL, Q, V2, and V3 were also tested in the model, both by estimating the 
exponents  and  by  using  body  weight  allometric  exponents  (V2  and  V3  body  weight  exponents  were 
fixed to 1; CL and Q body weight exponents were fixed to 0.75). The change in the fit and the change 
in the OFV (decrease of 4 pts) from estimating the body weight exponents to using the fixed allometric 
model exponents was negligible. Adding allometric exponents of body weight to the model represents 
an overall improvement to the model. Additionally, there is a physiological and historical precedent of 
allometry, and therefore, the parsimonious reduced allometric model was taken forward.
Covariate selection
A systematic univariate search was performed.
The fed status was not tested as a covariate in the univariate search because of the 208 subjects with 
PK data only 14 (6.7%) received edoxaban under fed state. In the univariate search only one covariate 
effect (formulation on KA) was shown to be statistically significant at the 0.01 level, with a P-value of 
0.000692.  Since  the  Pvalue  is  <  0.001,  this  covariate  was  added  to  the  final  model.  The  univariate 
search results are presented in the Table 7. Since only one covariate effect had a P-value < 0.001, a 
full stepwise covariate modeling was not run.
Final Model 
The parameter estimates for the final popPK model are presented in Table 8.

The source data was used to establish a covariance matrix to obtain a minimum of 1000 participants 
from each age group (0 to <0.5 years, 0.5 to <2 years, 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 
years) including the covariates like age, body weight, and eGFR.
The purpose of the simulations is to compare the pediatric exposures with the adult exposures and to 
assess if the age-, weight-, and eGFR-based pediatric doses are appropriate. The dosing regimen used 
for simulations is described in Table 9.

Across the five age groups, the simulated 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile of AUC0-24h,ss values 
with the proposed clinical dose fell within the adult reference range (0.5- to 1.5-fold of median AUC0-
24h,ss of adult VTE patients receiving 60 mg QD dose). The median AUC0-24h,ss values for 0 to <0.5 
year, 0.5 to <2 years, 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years cohorts are 1250, 1310,

ng*h/mL) of adult VTE patients receiving 60 mg QD dose.
The body weight-based dose adjustments for adolescent patients were assessed by simulations (Table 
10). The 30 mg QD dose generated a steady-state exposure (median AUC0-24h,ss = 1470 ng*h/mL) 
comparable to that of adult VTE patients receiving 60 mg QD dose. The proposed doses for adolescents 
with  body  weight  of  30  kg  to  <60  kg  and  ≥60  kg  resulted  in  median  AUC0-24h,ss  values,  27%  and 
31%,  respectively,  lower  than  that  of  adult  VTE  patients  receiving  60  mg  QD  dose.  The  eGFR-based

weight  was  significant  on  EMAX  and  EC50.  Because  of  the  high  uncertainty  of  body  weight  effect  on 
EMAX (41% RSE), it was removed. Body weight effect on EC50 was included in the final AFXA model.
Final Model
AFXA  data  was  best  fit  with  an  Emax  model  with  IIV  on  EMAX.  E0  was  fixed  to  0.1  IU/mL  as  there 
were only 9 of 207 that had evaluable pre-treatment measurements. Body weight effect on EC50 was 
included  in  the  final  model.  The  covariate  effect  of  body  weight  on  EC50  is  generally  minimal  (15%) 
and is not expected to be clinically relevant.

6.5.  Discussion
The pharmacology of edoxaban has been extensively described in adults. The current submission aims 
to characterise the PK and PD of edoxaban in paediatric patients.
The Phase I single-dose DU176b-A-U157 study included 5 paediatric age cohorts (12 to <18 years, 6 
to <12 years, 2 to <6 years, 6 months to <2 years and 0 months to <6 months) and 2 different doses 
in each age cohort. The main objective was to select the dosing regimen in pediatric patients that 
achieves exposures comparable to approved adult doses (30 and 60 mg). Two different formulations 
were used, tablets and suspensions in subjects older and younger, respectively, than 12 years of age.
A previous Population PK analysis was developed using adult data in order to propose dose regimens 
for each paediatric dose cohort in the Phase 3 studies. The previous Population PK model incorporated 
a 2-compartment model with theoretical allometric body weight exponents, 0.75 for clearance and 1 
for volume. The model also incorporates a post-menstrual age (PMA) effect on CL/F. Pediatric dose for 
specific age cohort was selected if the median estimated exposure at the pediatric dose was within the 
0.5 to 1.5-fold of the median exposure in adult VTE subjects at 60 and 30 mg QD dose, respectively. 
The population PK analysis was based on a pooled dataset from the 3 paediatric studies, which 
includes data of paediatric patients who were under risk of thromboembolic events and needed 
anticoagulant treatment (Phase 1 single-dose study DU176b-A-U157), paediatric patients with 
confirmed VTE (Phase 3 Study DU176b-D-U312) and paediatric subjects with cardiac diseases at risk 
of thromboembolic events (Phase 3 Study DU176b-C-U313). The dataset includes 208 subjects from 4 
days through 18 years of age. The Applicant updated the population PK model by keeping the same 
structural definition of the PK model (two compartment model with linear absorption and disposition, 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 69/195
fixed allometric effects on CL/Q and V1/V2) together with PMA and eGFR effects on clearance. During 
the covariate analysis, a formulation effect on Ka was incorporated. The PK analysis of edoxaban data 
included 208 subjects with 589 measurable PK observations.
When comparing the population PK model of edoxaban in adult and pediatric patients, despite similar 
structural definition was assumed among both populations, large differences were detected on ka 
(3.36 vs 0.365), V2/F (209 vs 44), V3/F (93.2 vs 262) and Q/F (5.9 vs 15.7) that suggest that 
differences in the PK properties of edoxaban exist on absorption and distribution that were not 
explained by allometric effects.
The Applicant has partially provided the explanation of these differences, although no clear justification 
regarding additional factors to allometry has been given.
Regarding the differences in CL/F, eGFR was included to estimate renal function in the paediatric Pop 
PK model, on the other hand, CrCl was used in the adult model. The CL/F parameters were calculated 
for a subject of 70 kg and CrCL and eGFR of 110ml/min/1.73m2. Despite the differences in the 
covariate selected for renal function between both populations, adolescents patients of 70 kg show 
higher CL/F value compared to adults of 70 kg. Such relationship is age, body-weight and renal 
function dependent, so additional evidence should be provided in case dose recommendations in 
younger pediatric patients.
Concerning the Vc/F, the sparse PK sampling in the paediatric studies makes it difficult to properly 
characterize the Cmax in this population, and makes it difficult to properly calculate the Vc/F. In the 
paediatric population, Vc/F is 4-fold lower than the Vc/F in the adult population, which may bias the 
Vp/F. For that reason Q/F is higher in the paediatric population due to the high value of Vp/F. In 
general, the lack of adequate experimental characterization of the alpha- and beta-disposition phases 
may compromise the estimation of Vp/F and Q/F. 
The differences in the Ka are explained by the different formulation used as well as the differences in 
physiological characteristics, although a 10-fold difference is observed.
Additional efforts would be required to fully understand whether the hypothesis is plausible. As a 
consequence, paediatric doses for each paediatric subgroup should be based on age, weight and renal 
function in order to investigate if those patients achieve edoxaban exposures that are comparable to 
adult
Based on the GOF and pcVPC plots, a moderately adequate description of the data is observed. 
According to the DV vs PRED plot, a relevant dispersion is observed in the high concentration range, 
perhaps due to poor characterization of the absorption mechanisms due to lack of experimental values. 
On the other hand, DV vs IPRED plot shows an under-prediction of inter-individual variability, since 
data points are not aligned around the identity line. The overall performance of the final population PK 
model seems moderately adequate based on the stratified analysis of the pcVPC across the different 
age cohorts. No relevant deviations were observed across the different age cohorts. 
Then, a simulation-based analysis was conducted in order to predict the overall exposure (AUC) across 
the different age cohorts using the final population PK model with the dosing regimens selected.  
Although the AUC results are within the 0.5-1.5 range of the adult population, the results show that 
the proposed dosing regimens in pediatric patients would lead to an under-exposure in pediatric 
patients compared to adult patients. Moreover, Figure 7 does not allow to fully understand whether 
pediatric patients within the same age cohort but different body weight would achieve similar exposure 
than the adult population. Moreover, a simulation-based analysis was conducted (Table 11) in order to 
explore different dosing regimens by age and eGFR cohorts, but no comparison with the adult 
exposure was provided. For that reason, the Applicant was asked to provide the simulated exposure 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023

for each age, eGFR and body weight cohort with the proposed dosing regimens, including the median 
(50th percentile) and extreme percentiles (5th and 95th) of the pediatric (simulated) and adult patients 
(observed) in order to clarify whether similar exposure would be achieved. The paediatric doses tested 
in the studies lead to an under-exposure in paediatric patients compared to adult patients, especially in 
adolescent patients with high body weight and paediatric patients across different age and eGFR 
values. Due to the absence of an exposure-safety analysis in pediatric patients, dose selection should 
be established based on achieving similar exposure range compared to the adult patients. In that 
sense, additional simulation-based analyses would be needed in order to justify the dose selection 
regimen in paediatric patients able to achieve similar exposure compared to the adult patients. 
A PK/PD analysis was conducted using several  PD endpoints: anti-FXa activity, prothrombin time (PT) 
and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which have been measured in the 3 paediatric 
studies. The PK/PD relationship of edoxaban was compared for the 5 paediatric cohort and adult VTE 
patients. The use of direct PK/PD relationships suggest that there is no time delay between the PK 
observations in plasma and the PD outcome, which is expected based on the mechanism of action of 
edoxaban. Overall, a similar PK/PD relationship across the different age cohorts for each PD endpoint is 
observed, and it suggests that no PK/PD differences due to age effect are expected. Three PK/PD 
models have been developed (for each PD endpoint) with an adequate description of the observed data 
based on the GOF and pcVPC. The AFXA model incorporates an Emax model with baseline and weight 
effect on EC50. Adequate final parameter estimates and low RSE was estimated. The PK/PD 
relationship for APTT and PT endpoints incorporates a linear PD model with baseline and covariate 
effects on baseline parameters (APTT and PT) with good description of the data. Linear models for 
APTT and PT should be considered with caution and no extrapolation analysis out of the PK range 
evaluated should be performed. Based on the PK/PD relationships that have been established across 
the three PD endpoints, showing that a moderate-to-high PD response of anti-FXa activity, 
prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time is expected in the exposure range of 150-
300 ng/mL of edoxaban. This is not supported by the previous adult VTE program or the exposure-
response analysis for safety, where higher bleeding events were predicted as Cave increases. 
Therefore, the selection of the exposure range of 60 mg QD of edoxaban for pediatric patients is 
endorsed, despite the efficacy could be compromised.

Title: “A Phase 3, Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter, Controlled Trial to Evaluate the 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Edoxaban and to Compare the Efficacy and 
Safety of Edoxaban with Standard-of-Care Anticoagulant Therapy in Pediatric Subjects from 
Birth to Less Than 18 Years of Age with Confirmed Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)”
Overview of Design
This was an event-driven Phase 3, prospective, randomised, multicentre, open-label, blinded-endpoint-
evaluation, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy and safety of edoxaban with SOC 
anticoagulant therapy, and to evaluate the PK and PD of edoxaban in paediatric subjects from birth to 
<18 years of age with confirmed VTE.  
The study was designed to demonstrate the noninferiority of edoxaban to SOC, including LMWH, VKA, 
or synthetic pentasaccharide (SP)-FXa inhibitors, in the treatment and secondary prevention of VTE in 
paediatric subjects.

The study included 2 periods: the Main Treatment Period with, and the Extension Period without, 
multiple-dose PK/PD assessment.

The Main Treatment Period was defined as the time from randomisation until the end of 
Month 3 of treatment.  The Main Treatment Period for subjects <6 months old (Cohort 5) 
was defined as the time from randomisation until the end of anticoagulant therapy for at 
least 6 to 12 weeks. 
The Extension Period was discretionary for the investigator and included treatment from 
the end of the Main Treatment Period (Month 3) up through the end of Month 12.  
Subjects who required anticoagulant treatment after discontinuation of the study drug at 
any time were transitioned to therapy as determined by the investigator.
Approximately 274 subjects were planned to be included in this randomised study (137 subjects in 
each treatment group), which was conducted at clinical sites located worldwide.  Randomisation was 
stratified by age cohorts and by region (North America, European Union, Middle East, North Africa, and 
the rest of the world).  After subjects were assessed for eligibility and underwent bridging treatment 
for at least 5 days of heparin (LMWH, SP-FXa inhibitors, or unfractionated heparin [UFH; with 
overlapping VKAs if needed]) prior to randomisation, the subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either edoxaban (subjects received selected dose of edoxaban) or SOC anticoagulant according 
to study site’s SOC treatment (LMWH alone or followed with VKA, SP-FXa inhibitors alone or followed 
with VKA, or VKA).
The subjects were recruited into 1 of the 5 age cohorts, which were similar to those of Study U157, but 
the distribution of subjects across age cohorts was different (ie, more subjects were enrolled in the 
older age cohorts).  Sequential enrolment of age cohorts was used for randomisation.  The order of 
enrolment was from the oldest age cohort to the youngest age cohort.

Study U312. Subject Population
To be enrolled, subjects had to be aged between birth (defined as 38 weeks gestational age) and <18 
years of age, with documented VTE confirmed by appropriate diagnostic imaging and requiring 
anticoagulant therapy for at least 90 days (or at least 6 to 12 weeks subjects for <6 months old 
[Cohort 5]).  Subjects must have received at least 5 days of heparin therapy prior to randomisation to 
treat the newly identified index VTE.  In addition, prior to being randomised to edoxaban or SOC, 
subjects initially treated with VKA were recommended to have an international normalised ratio ≤2.5.
Key exclusion criteria included the following: active bleeding or high risk of bleeding, contraindicating 
treatment with LMWH, SP-FXa inhibitors, VKAs, or direct oral anticoagulants; current or previous 
treatment with thrombolytic agents, thrombectomy, or insertion of a caval filter for the newly identified 
index VTE; severe hepatic impairment or hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy; estimated 
glomerular filtration rate <30% of normal for age and size; stage 2 hypertension; thrombocytopenia; 
life expectancy <3 months; a history of thrombosis; and subjects diagnosed with antiphospholipid 
syndrome who were triple positive.

Rifampin was prohibited during the study, subjects on concomitant use of rifampin were excluded, and 
antiplatelet therapy was contraindicated in both arms except for low-dose aspirin, defined as 1 to 5 
mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 100 mg/day.
Study U312. Efficacy Endpoints
Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite endpoint of incidence of symptomatic recurrent 
venous thromboembolic disease, death as a result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic 
burden (defined below) during the first 3-month period (for Cohort 5, the intended duration of 
treatment was 6 to 12 weeks).
All efficacy endpoints described below were adjudicated in a blinded manner by the Clinical Events 
Committee (CEC).
Radiologic examination
 Utilising the same diagnostic technique at Baseline and Follow-up to determine the thrombotic 
burden.
Diagnosis of new/recurrent PE required meeting 1 or more of the following criteria:
 A (new) intraluminal filling defect in segmental or more proximal branches of the pulmonary 
artery on spiral computed tomography (CT) scan
 A mismatched defect on a nuclear ventilation/perfusion scan compared with the prior imaging
 A nondiagnostic lung scan accompanied by documentation of new DVT by (Doppler) 
ultrasonography or venography.
Diagnosis of symptomatic recurrent VTE required the confirmation by appropriate diagnostic 
imaging (see imaging criteria of recurrent VTE) and at least 1 of the symptoms of VTE.
Imaging criteria of recurrent VTE

 Abnormal compression ultrasonography where compression had been normal or, if 
noncompressible during screening, an increase in diameter of the thrombus during full 
compression
 An extension of the echogenic intraluminal thrombus or absence of flow in the central venous 
system on Doppler ultrasonography
 An extension of an intraluminal filling defect, a new intraluminal filling defect, or an extension of 
nonvisualisation of veins in the presence of a sudden cut-off on venography
 An extension of an intraluminal filling defect or a new intraluminal filling defect on CT angiogram
Diagnosis of fatal VTE was based on 1 or more of the following:
 Objective diagnostic testing
 Autopsy
 Death that cannot be attributed to a documented cause and for which VTE cannot be ruled out
Thrombotic burden was assessed by comparison of the diagnostic method used at Baseline and at 
Month 3 ± 5 days (for Cohort 5, at 6 to 12 weeks ± 5 days) in the absence of symptomatic recurrent 
VTE. Hence, the same imaging technique that was used at the enrolment of the subject into the study 
was required to be used at the end of the observational period ± 3 days. A thrombotic burden endpoint 
was registered if there was no regression of the thrombus size or extension of the thrombus at Month 
3 Visit ± 3 days (for Cohort 5, at 6 to 12 weeks ± 3 days) after randomisation.
Additionally, thrombotic burden was assessed at Month 12 ± 5 days/Discontinuation Visit for those 
subjects who participated in the Extension Period.
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints included the following:
 A composite endpoint of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, death as a result 
of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic burden from randomisation to the date of the 
last dose of study drug plus 30 days
 The individual components of the primary efficacy endpoint during the first 3-month treatment 
period are as follows:
 Symptomatic recurrent VTE
 Death as a result of VTE
 No change or extension of thrombotic burden.
 All-cause mortality from randomisation to the date of the last dose of study drug plus 30 days
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 74/195
 Deep vein thrombosis, catheter-related thrombosis, sinovenous thrombosis, and PE events within 
and after the first 3-month treatment period (For Cohort 5, the intended duration of treatment 
was 6 to 12 weeks.)
Clinical Outcome Endpoint
The clinical outcome endpoint is defined as follows:
A composite combination of major and clinically relevant nonmajor (CRNM) bleedings, symptomatic 
recurrent VTEs, and death as a result of VTE that occurred from the first to the last dose plus 30 days. 
Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was defined as an acute or subacute clinically overt bleed that 
does not meet the criteria for a major bleed but prompts a clinical response, in that it leads to at least 
1 of the following:
 A hospital admission for bleeding
 A physician-guided medical or surgical treatment for bleeding or
 A change in antithrombotic therapy (including interruption or discontinuation of study drug)
Study U312. Efficacy Analyses
Analysis Sets
As detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), the efficacy analyses were conducted on the following 
analysis sets:
 The Randomised Analysis Set that included all enrolled subjects who signed the informed consent 
form and were randomised.
 The modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set that included all randomised subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of randomised study drug.
 The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set that included all subjects in the mITT Analysis Set who were 
sufficiently compliant with the protocol. Criteria of sufficiently compliant were detailed in SAP.
Methods
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the mITT Analysis Set using the randomised group even if 
a subject inadvertently received the incorrect study drug. In this analysis, the time to the first event of 
the composite primary efficacy outcome was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards regression 
model including treatment group and age cohorts as covariates.
The time to first event was defined as the time (days) from the date of randomisation to the date of 
the first event experienced by a subject during the first 3-month period. Subjects who did not have a 
primary efficacy outcome during the 3 months plus 3 days period were censored at 3 months plus 3 
days or the last day the subject had a complete assessment for study outcomes, whichever came first. 
Subjects who did not have a primary efficacy outcome during the first 3-month period and did not 
have an image taken in the first 3-month period were censored at the date of randomisation.
The edoxaban-to-comparator hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of HR were computed 
based on this Cox proportional hazard regression model. Edoxaban was considered noninferior to 
comparator if the upper limit of the 95% CI was <1.5.
If noninferiority of edoxaban was established, edoxaban was tested for superiority to comparator. 
Edoxaban was considered superior to comparator if the upper limit of the 95% CI from above analysis 
was <1.0. Two-sided P values for superiority were also reported from the same model. To control 
study-wise type I error, fixed-sequence testing procedure was used for testing noninferiority and 
superiority for the primary efficacy analysis.
The following secondary efficacy analyses were conducted:
 A composite endpoint, including symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, death as 
a result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic burden from randomisation to the date 
of the last dose of study drug plus 30 days, was calculated with the same Cox proportional 
hazards regression model used for the primary efficacy analysis. The time to first event was 
defined as the time (days) from the date of randomisation to the first event experienced by a 
subject. Subjects who did not have a primary efficacy outcome during the study period were 
censored at the last day the subject had a complete assessment for study outcomes or the last 
dose of study drug plus 30 days, whichever came first. These efficacy analyses were based on the 
mITT and PP Analysis Sets. The incidence of this composite endpoint was also summarised by 
treatment arm for the mITT and PP Analysis Sets. 
Incidence of all-cause mortality from randomisation to the date of the last dose of study drug plus 
30 days was also summarised by treatment arm for the Mitt Analysis Set.

Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Edoxaban Tosylate in Children From 38 Weeks 
Gestational Age to Less than 18 Years of Age with Cardiac Diseases at Risk of 
Thromboembolic Events”
Study U313. Overview of Design
This was a Phase 3, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, observational study to 
evaluate and to compare the safety and efficacy of edoxaban against SOC anticoagulants in subjects at 
risk of TEs.
This study was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of edoxaban with SOC anticoagulants in 
paediatric subjects with cardiac conditions at risk of TEs who require anticoagulation and to evaluate 
the PK and PD of edoxaban in this population. 
The study included 2 periods: 



The Main Treatment Period was defined as the time from randomisation until the end of 
Month 3 of treatment. 
The Extension Period was discretionary for the subject based on the investigator’s 
judgment of risk burden and included treatment from the end of the Main Treatment Period 
(Month 3) up through the end of Month 12.  All subjects who entered the Extension Period 
were given edoxaban for the duration of the Extension Period (Protocol Version 3.0).  
Subjects who enrolled in the protocol earlier than Version 3.0 and continued to the 
Extension Period with SOC anticoagulants were given edoxaban once the site approved 
Protocol Version 3.0.
Subjects who required anticoagulant treatment after discontinuation of the study drug at 
any time were transitioned to a therapy as determined by the investigator.
Approximately 150 subjects were planned be included in this randomised study (100 subjects in the 
edoxaban group and 50 subjects in the SOC group), which was conducted at clinical sites located in 
North America, European Union, Middle East, and North Africa.  After subjects were assessed for 
eligibility, they were randomised to receive either edoxaban (subjects received selected dose of 
edoxaban) or SOC anticoagulant according to study site’s SOC treatment (UFH, LMWH alone or 
followed with VKA, or VKA).

Study U313. Efficacy Endpoints
Primary Efficacy Endpoint
Not applicable.
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows:
 The combination of symptomatic TE in the systemic arterial or venous pathways, including DVT, 
PE, stroke, intracardiac thrombus, systemic embolic event (SEE), and myocardial infarction (MI), 
and asymptomatic intracardiac thrombus identified by cardiac imaging that occurred from 
randomisation to the Month 3 Visit
 Deaths as a result of TE that occurred from randomisation to the Month 3 Visit
 All-cause mortality from randomisation to the Month 3 Visit
 The combination of symptomatic TE in the systemic arterial or venous pathways including DVT, 
PE, stroke, intracardiac thrombus, SEE, and MI, and asymptomatic intracardiac thrombus 
identified by cardiac imaging that occurred from the day after the Month 3 Visit to the date of the 
last dose of study drug plus 30 days for subjects who participated in the Extension Period
 Deaths as a result of TE that occurred from the day after the Month 3 Visit to the date of the last 
dose of study drug plus 30 days for subjects who participated in the Extension Period
 All-cause mortality from the day after the Month 3 Visit to the date of the last dose of study drug 
plus 30 days for subjects who participated in the Extension Period
Study U313. Efficacy Analyses
Analysis Sets: The efficacy analyses were conducted on the mITT Analysis Set.
 The Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set that included all subjects who signed the informed consent form 
and were randomised.
 The mITT Analysis Set that included all subjects in the ITT Analysis Set who received at least 1 
dose of randomised study drug.
Methods: The following secondary efficacy endpoints were summarised using incidence and 
annualised event rate by treatment group for the Main Treatment Period and in the edoxaban group for 
the Extension Period plus 30 days for subjects who participated in the Extension Period, as well the 
rate difference between edoxaban and the comparator with the corresponding 95% CI for the Main 
Treatment Period. The incidence of each component was summarised by treatment group.
This analysis was based on CEC adjudication-confirmed events, which are as follows:
 The combination of symptomatic TE in the systemic arterial or venous pathways, including DVT, 
PE, stroke, SEE, intracardiac thrombus, and MI, and asymptomatic intracardiac thrombus 
identified by cardiac imaging
 Deaths as a result of TE
 All-cause mortality
The exploratory endpoints combination of symptomatic TE and asymptomatic intracardiac thrombus, 
death as a result of TE, and all-cause mortality were analysed on the basis of CECadjudicated results 
for periods and subjects below:
 Events from randomisation to the date of last dose of study drug plus 30 days for subjects who 
did not participate in the Extension Period
 Events from the day after the Month 3 Visit to the date of the last dose of study drug for subjects 
who participated in the Extension Period
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 78/195
 Events that occurred from randomisation to the Month 3 Visit or to the date of the last dose of 
study drug plus 3 days if study drug was discontinued in the Main Treatment Period, whichever 
was earlier.
Subgroup analysis based on CEC-adjudicated results was conducted for the combination of 
symptomatic TE in the systemic arterial or venous pathways, including DVT, PE, stroke, SEE, 
intracardiac thrombus, and MI, and asymptomatic intracardiac thrombus identified by cardiac imaging 
by treatment group for the Main Treatment Period and in the edoxaban group only for the Extension 
Period. Predefined subgroups are as follows:
 Sex
 Region
 Underlying disease (Kawasaki, Fontan, Heart Failure, and other)
 Concomitant aspirin usage (yes, no)
Dose Recommendation in Studies U312 and U313
The dose recommendations for Studies U312 and U313 (Table E01) were based on the PK and safety 
data from Study U157 and on population PK (PopPK) and were reviewed on an ongoing basis by an 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee.  Edoxaban doses were selected to achieve exposures 
comparable to adult doses of 60 mg (recommended dose) and 30 mg (dose reduction based on clinical 
factors, including renal function, low body weight, and concomitant use of P-glycoprotein [P-gp] 
inhibitors), referred to as a high-dose and a low-dose regimen (for details, refer to Module 2.7.2 
Section 4.7).
The PK results from Studies U312 and U313 indicate that the doses administered in paediatric subjects 
were comparable across the 5 age cohorts from birth to <18 years and were aligned with those in 
adult VTE subjects administered with edoxaban at 60 mg once daily (QD; Module 2.7.2 Section 4.5).  
Likewise, PD data (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], and anti-FXa) 
for the doses in paediatric subjects were consistent with those in adult subjects with VTE administered 
with edoxaban at 60 mg QD (Module 2.7.2 Section 4.6.2).

a Subjects were instructed to take edoxaban (tablets or granules) orally once a day, at the same time 
every day, with or without food.  Tablets were to be swallowed with a glass of water.
Measurement of treatment compliance
The total duration of study participation for any individual subject was a maximum of 13 months. 
In both studies, edoxaban compliance was assessed by calculating the percentage of time the subject 
was receiving edoxaban during the treatment period. In the SOC groups, warfarin and VKA compliance 
were measured and assessed by summarising INR and time in therapeutic range levels (in Study U313 
only). Enoxaparin, UFH, and LMWH compliance was measured and assessed by summarising the anti-
FXa levels (no subjects received fondaparinux).

The primary efficacy analysis of the composite endpoint (consisting of symptomatic recurrent VTE, 
death as a result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic burden; defined in Section 
1.3.1.3.1) during the Main Treatment Period is presented in Table E10 for the mITT Analysis Set. The 
Kaplan-Meier estimate for this analysis is presented in Figure E03. A total of 26 (17.9%) subjects in 
the edoxaban group and 31 (22.0%) subjects in the SOC group had primary efficacy events during the 
Main Treatment Period. Symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in a total of 5 (3.4%) subjects in the 
edoxaban group compared with 2 (1.4%) subjects in the SOC group.

Five subjects had nonfatal DVT (4 subjects in the edoxaban group [2.8%]) or PE (1 subject in the SOC 
group [0.7%]). None of these events were considered related to study drug.
There was 1 unexplained death in each group (0.7%) for which VTE could not be ruled out. Neither 
was considered to be related to study drug.
In the summary of clinical pharmacology is stated that the PopPK modelestimated edoxaban mean 
AUC0-24h,ss in 3 patients with VTE (2060 ng*h/mL) was higher than that in patients without VTE 
(1310 ng*h/mL). Among the 3 patients with VTE, only subject  had edoxaban exposure (1207 
ng*h/mL) slightly lower than the mean exposure in patients without VTE (Table E11). The data 
indicate that the three VTE events were not associated with a low PK exposure of edoxaban.

There was no change or extension of thrombotic burden based on imaging in 21 (14.5%) subjects in 
the edoxaban group and 29 (20.6%) subjects in the SOC group. The HR for the edoxaban group 
versus the SOC group for the Main Treatment Period was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.594 to 1.719). The upper 
bound of the 95% CI (1.719) was above the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.5, and the 
noninferiority of edoxaban versus SOC was not confirmed for the Main Treatment Period.
There were no subjects who had multiple VTEs during the Main Treatment Period in the mITT Analysis 
Set (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.2.1.5).
In the PP Analysis Set, a total of 5 (3.9%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 2 (1.8%) subjects in

Study U312. All-cause Mortality
The incidence of adjudicated all-cause mortality during the Overall Treatment Period is summarised in 
Table E15. All-cause mortality occurred in 2 (1.4%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 3 (2.1%) 
subjects in the SOC group. There was 1 (0.7%) VTE-related death in each group. The VTE events with 
fatal outcome were endocarditis in the edoxaban group and pneumococcal sepsis in the SOC group 
(Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.2.1.25).
Refer to Section 3.2.1.2.1 for additional details. Full details of the deaths are provided in the narratives 
in Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR, Section 14.3.3.

Clinical Benefit Analysis
A summary of net clinical outcome, defined as the composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE events, 
death as a result of VTE, and major and CRNM bleeding that occurred during the Overall Treatment 
Period, was analysed by using the proportional hazard model similar to that in the primary efficacy 
analysis for the mITT Analysis Set (Table E18).
A total of 16 (11.0%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 7 (5.0%) subjects in the SOC group had an 
event. Major and CRNM bleeding was experienced by 10 (6.9%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 
(3.5%) subjects in the SOC group.

Study U312. Exploratory Endpoint Quality of Life
A paediatric quality of life questionnaire was issued at randomisation and at the end of the Main  
Treatment Period to assess categories of physical, emotional, social, and school functional behaviors.
The Psychosocial Health Summary score is the calculated mean of the Emotional, School, and Social 
Functioning subscales of the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory. The Physical Summary score is 
computed from the physical functioning score. The Total Summary score is the computed mean of the 
Emotional, Social and School Functioning, and Physical scales.
The Physical Health summary score increased (improved) for all age groups in the edoxaban group and 
for the 12 to <18 years of age group in the SOC group (Table 3.19). The Psychosocial Health Summary 
score increased (improved) for the 6 to <12 years and 2 to <6 years of age groups in the edoxaban 
group and for the 2 to <6 years of age group in the SOC group. The Total Summary score (decreased) 
for all age groups in the SOC group.
Study U313. Adjudication-confirmed Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Main Treatment Period
During the Main Treatment Period, 1 (1.7%) subject in the SOC group experienced 2 TE events 
(annualised rate of 0.07; Table E19).

Adjudication-confirmed Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Extension Period (mITT Analysis Set)
During the Extension Period, 4 (2.8%) subjects experienced an adjudication-confirmed TE event as 
shown in Table E20. Of the 4 subjects with an endpoint event, 2 subjects experienced an adjudication-
confirmed stroke, and 2 subjects experienced an MI.

During the Extension Period plus 30-day Follow-up (all patients received edoxaban during extension), 
5 (3.5%) subjects of a total of 144 participants experienced a TE event. Of the 5 subjects, 2 subjects 
experienced a stroke, 2 subjects experienced an MI, and 1 subject experienced an intracardiac 
thrombus (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 14.2.1.2). The 2 events of MI are poorly 
documented and were considered to be related to study drug by the investigators. 
During the Overall Treatment Period plus 30-day Follow-up for subjects who did not participate in the 
Extension Period (n=141), no subjects experienced a TE event (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR

7.2.  Discussion
This variation application intends to update sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC with available 
paediatric data based on final results from study U312 (Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS; n = 290). This is a 
phase 3, open-label, randomised, multicentre, controlled trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of edoxaban and to compare the efficacy and safety of edoxaban with standard-of-
care anticoagulant therapy in paediatric subjects from birth to less than 18 years of age with confirmed 
venous thromboembolism (VTE). The Package also includes the study U313 (ENNOBLE-ATE; n=168) as 
supportive for efficacy that included paediatric subjects with cardiac diseases at risk of TE 
complications who requires primary or secondary anticoagulant prophylaxis. 
In the pivotal study (Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS), a Phase 3, open-label, randomised, multi-
centre, controlled study to evaluate the PK and PD of edoxaban and compare the efficacy and safety of 
edoxaban with standard of care (SOC) anticoagulant therapy in paediatric subjects from birth to less 
than 18 years of age with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE), a total of 290 subjects were 
randomised into the study: 147 in the edoxaban group and 143 in the SOC group, of which 286 
subjects took at least one dose of study medication (mITT: edoxaban 145 subjects vs. SOC 141 
subjects). The primary efficacy endpoint (the composite endpoint of symptomatic recurrent VTE, death 
as result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic burden during the first 3-month period) 
occurred in 26 of 145 patients (17.9) in the edoxaban group and 31 of 141 patients (22%) of the SOC 
group (HR: 1.01; 95%CI: 0.59 to 1.72). The upper bound of the 95% CI (1.72) exceeded the 
predefined non-inferiority margin of 1.5, hence the non-inferiority of edoxaban versus SOC was not 
confirmed. Nevertheless, looking at the key secondary endpoint (same as the primary endpoint but 
assessed during the main treatment period plus extension period and 30-day follow up), the HR for the 
edoxaban group versus the SOC group in this analysis would have met the noninferiority criteria for 
edoxaban vs. SOC. in the mITT (HR: 0.71; 95%CI: 0.47 to 1.07), and also in the PP Analysis Set (HR: 
0.67; 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.08). The study was powered to achieve 68 primary endpoints, whereas 57 
were achieved.  Therefore, the failure to achieve non-inferiority seems related to insufficient number of 
primary events and not to a lack of efficacy of edoxaban in children. Additionally, the HR of ≥1.0 was 
mainly driven by the specified “time-to-event” analysis, as edoxaban recurrent primary events tended 
toward early occurrence vs. SOC recurrent primary events.
The analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints revealed that during treatment periods that 
extended beyond 3 months (for both on-treatment and overall study populations), the HR for 
edoxaban vs. SOC was numerically favourable (HRs: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.548, 1.342] and 0.71 [95% CI: 
0.469, 1.074], respectively), concluding that edoxaban, when indicated and given for >3 months, may 
provide an alternative treatment option over SOC therapy, especially considering the inconvenience of 
long-term injectable therapy (UFH, heparin) or continued need for therapeutic monitoring VKA 
(warfarin).Regarding recurrent symptomatic VTE in study U312, it is reassuring that all four non-fatal 
events reported in the edoxaban arm were recurrent DVTs. Three cases corresponded to adolescents 
who had concomitant cancer treated with chemotherapy, and only 1 recurrent DVT was reported in a 
younger children. No relationship was found between edoxaban levels and the development of 
symptomatic VTE. In fact, most patients with VTE had edoxaban levels above the median, suggesting 
that the recurrence was related more likely to underlying disease and risk factors. There were two 
patients that developed symptomatic recurrent DVT while on edoxaban (subjects  iliac DVT, CVC DVT) 
that are not mentioned in the table 4.8 of the Summary of Clinical Pharmacology in relationship with 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 101/195
edoxaban levels. The MAH clarified that there were noPK data available for these two patients (see 
assessment of Q13 in the RSI). In study U312, 21 of 26 primary recurrent VTE events in the edoxaban 
group and 29 of the 31 recurrent VTE events in the SOC group corresponded to “no change or 
extension of thrombotic burden”. The MAH clarified that one subject of 21 children (4.8%) with “no 
change or extension of thrombotic burden” in the edoxaban group started additional anticoagulation 
before the primary efficacy outcome assessment. In the SOC group, 3 of 29 children (10.3%) with “no 
change or extension of thrombotic burden” started additional anticoagulation before the primary 
efficacy outcome assessment and 1 additional subject in the SOC started additional anticoagulation on 
the same day as the primary efficacy outcome assessment. On the other hand, Among the 26 subjects 
with primary efficacy events in the edoxaban group, PK samples were collected from 14 subjects (2 
subjects with symptomatic recurrent VTE, 1 death where VTE could not be ruled out and 11 subjects 
with no change or extension of thrombotic burden). The median and average exposures of edoxaban of 
the 14 subjects were slightly higher than that of subjects enrolled in Study U312 and comparable to 
that of subjects enrolled in Study U313.  No relationship between edoxaban levels and primary efficacy 
events was observed (see assessment of Q14 in the RSI).
The dossier also includes data from study U313 (ENNOBLE-ATE; n=168) as supportive for 
efficacy. In paediatric subjects with cardiac diseases at risk of TE complications who requires primary 
or secondary anticoagulant prophylaxis, no TE were reported in 109 patients on edoxaban during the 3 
month main observation period, while one of 58 patients in the SOC group (1.7%) experienced a DVT 
followed by PE. During the Extension Period, 4 subjects in the edoxaban group experienced a TE event.  
Of the 4 subjects with an event, 2 subjects experienced a stroke, and 2 subjects experienced an MI. 
Although Study U313 was neither designed nor powered to test superiority or noninferiority of 
edoxaban in comparison to SOC anticoagulants, it supports the conclusion that edoxaban may be an 
appropriate alternative to SOC (VKA or UFH/LMWH) in paediatric subjects with cardiac diseases at risk 
of TE complications who require primary or secondary anticoagulant prophylaxis. Overall, the results of 
both studies continue to support the findings to date that edoxaban is effective in children ages 0 to 
<18 years. 
There is an unmet clinical need in paediatric thrombosis for having alternatives to parenteral 
anticoagulants (mainly LMWH) and VKA (requiring regular monitoring and subject to a broad number 
of drug-drug and drug-food interactions that need regular anticoagulant monitoring). In studies 
Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS and ENNOBLE-ATE, edoxaban has shown to improve treatment compliance 
compared with SOC, without the need for parenteral administration or regular control its anticoagulant 
effect, and also positive trends were found on a exploratory endpoint of QoL. Edoxaban could be a 
useful addition to rivaroxaban and dabigatran for oral anticoagulation for treating thrombosis in 
children. 
The applicant does not propose a paediatric indication or posology for edoxaban arguing that 
study DU176b-D-U312 did not meet the primary objective of showing non-inferiority of edoxaban 
versus SOC on a primary endpoint including symptomatic VTE. This approach was not endorsed initially 
by the CHMP. The pivotal study did not apparently show a lack of efficacy of edoxaban, while EMA rules 
allow extrapolation of the efficacy of a medicinal product from adults to children (EMA/199678/2016). 
In addition, paediatric addendum on VTE prophylaxis and treatment does not require a formal 
hypothesis of non-inferiority or superiority at the time of designing paediatric phase III trials in 
children with acute VTE (EMA/CHMP/763438/2017). The number of children recruited is expected to be 
low and comparative trials in the treatment of VTE versus standard of care will normally not be 
focussing on formal hypothesis testing of non-inferiority or superiority due to lack of statistical power, 
but rather on descriptive analyses [EMA/CHMP/763438/2017]. The sponsors are advised to consider 
analysis methods that capitalise on all available data, for example using statistical modelling (see 
CHMP Guideline on clinical trials in small populations: CHMP/EWP/83561/2005).

In the response to CHMP RSI, the applicant provided and discussed some key pitfalls of the paediatric 
development of edoxaban in children (see assessment of the answer to Q10 of the RSI). Regarding 
dose and posology, similar exposure as obtained in adults was not achieved using the proposed dose 
regimen of edoxaban tablets in subjects 12 to <18 years of age (rather, it could lead to an 
approximately 20% to 30% underexposure). This was translated into a higher annualized rate of 
recurrent symptomatic VTE with edoxaban vs. SOC in the meta-analysis provided in response to the 
list of questions (15.6% vs. 6.4% in the study U312 in children), while in the adult study U305, the 
trend was the opposite in favour of edoxaban (3.5% vs. 3.9%). In addition, in sensitivity analyses, 
using the endpoint of symptomatic recurrent VTE as defined in the EINSTEIN-Jr study, edoxaban would 
have been declared inferior to SOC with statistical significance (HR: 2.34; 95% CI: 0.453 to 12.054) 
(see also assessment of Q11 of the RSI). Therefore, a potential lack of efficacy of edoxaban due to 
underexposure in children at the doses tested in study U312 is a real possibility. In addition, it is 
unknown whether the tablet and granule formulations are bioequivalent in patients younger than 12 
years. There are inadequate PK/PD, efficacy, or safety data to support the use of the edoxaban 30 mg 
or 15 mg tablets in patients younger than 12 years of age. As a result, establishing a paediatric 
posology is challenging and subject to significant uncertainty with the data available, and an 
extrapolation exercise of the efficacy from adults is fraught with risk ((see assessment to the MAH 
answer to Q10 of the RSI). Finally, there are several treatment options for paediatric VTE (i.e.: 
rivaroxaban, dabigatran, heparins and VKAs (see assessment to the MAH answer to Q10 of the RSI). 
Given the treatment options available for paediatric patients and the uncertainty that edoxaban offers 
at least an equivalent benefit to SOC in this patient population, the MAH does not consider that a 
recommendation for formulation development is warranted.
It is unfortunate that the paediatric PIP has failed in achieving the goal of establishing an appropriate 
effective and safe dose that provides a similar edoxaban exposure as in adults. Given the uncertainties 
about the benefit-risk profile of edoxaban in the paediatric population and the difficulties in 
establishing an appropriate paediatric dose, the Rapporteur finally shares the MAH proposal of not 
recommending the use of edoxaban in children.
The U312 study population was poorly characterized for essential clinical data, like age ranges (e.g.: 
12 to < 18 years; 6 to < 12 years; 2 to < 6 years; and < 2 years), type of index VTE (e.g.: DVT 
related to central venous catheter, cerebral venous sinus, lower limbs, PE) and type of risk factors 
(persistent, transient or both, cancer yes/no, CVC yes/no) in the initial submission. The applicant 
provided these data after the CHMP request (see assessment of Q15 in the RSI). As stated in the 
paediatric addendum of the EMA VTE guideline, the presence of cancer and chemotherapy with 
asparaginase are major prothrombotic risk factors that coud result in different VTE rates and/or 
treatment effects. The applicant clarified how many patients were recruited into the U312 study with 
cancer and/or asparaginase chemotherapy by treatment group and provided subgroup analyses of 
efficacy and safety depending on the presence/absence of a history of neoplasms at baseline. Due to 
the low number of events, no conclusions can be made (see assessment of the response to Q15 in the 
RSI).. The index VTE events in study U312 were also poorly characterized in the documentation. The 
description of VTE location is rather scarce (VTE is only differentiated into DVT or PE). The MAH was 
invited to describe locations of index DVTs (i.e.: lower limbs, upper limbs, catheter-associated DVT, 
cerebral venous thrombosis, etc) and to provide subgroup analyses of recurrent VTE according to 
location of index DVT/PE (see assessment of the MAH answer to Q12 of the RSI). There were 46 cases 
where VTE was not confirmed but most cases were included in the efficacy analyses. These patients 
should have been excluded from the mITT and PP populations and the main analysis, and only included 
in sensitivity analyses. The MAH provided efficacy analyses including only confirmed cases of VTE 
(240: 129 in the edoxaban group and 111 in the SOC group) (see assessment of the MAH answer to 
Q12a in the RSI). The MAH indicated that the imbalance in the number of unconfirmed cases of the 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 103/195
index VTE (30 in the SOC group and 16 in the edoxaban group is likely due to chance (see assessment 
of the MAH answer to Q12b in the RSI. The MAH also provided, after the CHMP request, a description 
of VTE location (see assessment of the MAH answer to Q12c). The type of index event was DVT with or 
without PE in 125 (86.2%) of 145 children of the edoxaban group and 121 (85.8%) of 141 children in 
the SOC group, while the remaining cases, 20 (13.8%) in the edoxaban group and 20 (14.2%) in the 
SOC group were PE without DVT. DVTs were most frequently localized in the lower extremities (50 and 
44 cases in the edoxaban and SOC groups, respectively), upper extremities (22 vs 24), and cerebral 
venous sinus (27 vs. 21). The number of catheter-related thrombosis as index VTE event was low in 
the edoxaban and SOC groups (8 vs. 9).  
 The company also provided subgroup analyses of recurrent VTE according to location of index 
DVT/PE, but due to the low number of subjects with events, it is not possible to draw any conclusions. 
(see assessment of the MAH answer to Q12d).
The MAH also clarified that discrepancies found in the net clinical benefit analysis (Table 3.16 of 
the summary of clinical efficacy), which disfavoured edoxaban in study U312, and the analysis of VTE 
events, major bleeding and CRNM bleeding events described in other sections, which were numerically 
in favour of edoxaban versus SOC were due to different time-points for assessment (see assessment of 
the MAH answer to Q16 in the RSI). 
In study U313 the results seemed worse for patients who switched from SOC to edoxaban (i.e.: 
SOC-edoxaban arm) than for those who continued with edoxaban since the start of the study (i.e.: 
edoxaban-edoxaban arm). The MAH provided brief narratives of the 5 subjects developing TE events 
during the extension period +30 days follow-up in study U313. All reported events were unrelated to 
the study medication but were attributed to progression of the underlying medical condition. Therefore, 
it is considered unlikely that switching from SOC treatment to edoxaban in the extension period was 
the fundamental cause of the increased reporting in TE events (see assessment of the MAH answer to 
Q17 in the RSI).
8.  Clinical Safety aspects
8.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted
Safety data are available from the two Phase 3 studies and the supporting Phase 1 study conducted in 
paediatric subjects.  Results from Studies U312, U313, and U157 have been presented in the Clinical 
Overview Addendum. Safety data were not pooled across these studies because of the differences in 
the study designs and subject populations.
For all studies, safety analyses were conducted in the Safety Analysis Set (SAS; ie, all subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug).  Safety data were analysed with descriptive statistics, except 
when otherwise specified.  For details on the statistical analyses, please refer to the SAP of the 
individual studies (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Appendix 16.1.9; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-
U313 CSR Appendix 16.1.9; Module 5.3.4.2 DU176b-A-U157 CSR Appendix 16.1.9).
Definition, Adjudication, and Analysis of Bleeding in Studies U312 and U313: 
In Studies U312 and U313, all investigator-reported bleeding events and potential safety endpoints 
were adjudicated by an independent CEC blinded to the treatment group and categorised as major 
bleeding, CRNM, and minor bleeding (nuisance bleeding).  Bleeding definitions were based on 
presentations/discussions at the Perinatal and Paediatric Haemostasis Subcommittee meetings during 
the 56th-58th Scientific and Standardization Committee Meeting of the International Society on 
Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Schulman S, et al.  J Thromb Haemost. 2005;3:692–4).  Minimal criteria 
defining a significant bleeding were according to the International Society on Thrombosis and 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 104/195
Haemostasis (Rodeghiero F, et al. J Thromb Haemost. 2010; 8:2063–5). Bleeding events were 
summarised and analysed according to the following categories: major and CRNM bleeding events 
combined, major bleeding event, and all bleeding events (major, CRNM, and minor bleeding 
combined). 
In Study U312, the analysis of the composite endpoint of major and CRNM bleeding events was based 
on an “on-treatment” approach.  An event was considered as an “on-treatment” event if it occurred 
while on study drug or within 3 days of study drug interruption or discontinuation.  The time to “on-
treatment” major or CRNM bleeding was compared between treatment groups by using a Cox 
proportional hazards regression model including treatment and age groups as covariates; the 
edoxaban-to-comparator HR was computed with 95% CIs based on this model.  Similar analyses were 
conducted for each bleeding category occurring from the date of randomisation to the date of the last 
dose of study drug plus 30 days (ie, Overall Treatment Period).  The incidence of bleeding events was 
also summarised by treatment group for On-treatment Period up to 3 months plus 3 days (ie, Main 
Treatment Period and On-treatment), On-treatment up to the date of last dose of study drug plus 3 
days (ie, Main Treatment Period plus Extension Period and On-treatment), and from the date of 
randomisation to the date of the last dose of study drug plus 30 days (ie, Overall Treatment Period).  
Further details on the statistical analyses of bleeding events, including sensitivity analyses and 
subgroup analyses, can be found in the SAP (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Appendix 16.1.9).
In Study U313, the time to major or CRNM bleeding occurring during the Main Treatment Period was 
compared between the treatment groups using a Cox proportional hazards regression model with 
treatment group, concomitant usage of aspirin at Baseline, and underlying disease (Kawasaki disease, 
Fontan surgery, heart failure, or other) as covariates.  Hazard ratios between the edoxaban and the 
SOC groups were calculated with the corresponding 95% CIs.  Incidence, annualised event rate, and 
rate difference between edoxaban and SOC groups with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated for the 
Main Treatment Period for the bleeding event category.  In addition, incidence and annualised event 
rate were calculated occurring from the day after the Month 3 Visit to the date of last dose of study 
drug plus 30 days, from the day after the Month 3 Visit to the date of last dose of study drug, and for 
events occurring in the Extension Period plus 3 days.  Further details on the statistical analyses of 
bleeding events, including exploratory and subgroup analyses, can be found in the SAP (Module 
5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Appendix 16.1.9).
8.2.  Results
Study U312. Extent of Exposure
The SAS included 286 subjects overall: 145 subjects in the edoxaban group and 141 subjects in the 
SOC group.
The median duration of treatment was 147.0 (range: 1 to 400) days in the edoxaban group.  In the 
SOC group, median duration of treatment was 95.5 (range: 1 to 412) days for subjects treated with 
LMWH, 87.0 (range: 3 to 162) days for subjects treated with SP-FXa inhibitor, and 112.0 (range: 2 to 
368) days for subjects treated with VKA (Table S01).  Study drug interruptions were required in 24 
(16.6%), 17 (14.7%), 0 (0%), and 13 (31.7%) of subjects treated with edoxaban, LMWH, SP-FXa 
inhibitor, and VKA, respectively (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.2.2.3).

Study U313. Extent of Exposure
The SAS included 167 subjects overall: 109 subjects in the edoxaban group and 58 subjects in the 
SOC group.
The median duration of treatment during the Main Treatment Period was 92.0 (range: 30 to 121) days 
for the subjects in the edoxaban group.  In the SOC group, the median duration of treatment during 
the Main Treatment Period was 89.5 (range: 10 to 101) days for subjects treated with UFH/LMWH and 
91.0 (range: 27 to 158) days for subjects treated with VKA (Table S02).  Study drug interruptions 
during the Main Treatment Period were required in 3.7% (4/109), 16.7% (2/12), and 16.0% (8/50) of 
subjects treated with edoxaban, UFH/LMWH, and VKA, respectively (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 
CSR Table 14.2.2.3).
The median duration of exposure to edoxaban in the Extension Period was 273.0 (range: 17 to 
552) days (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 14.2.2.2).

Safety Endpoints: Bleeding
Study U312
Safety endpoints were as follows:



A combination of major and CRNM bleedings occurring during treatment or within 3 days of 
completing or interrupting or stopping study during the first 3 month treatment period (ie, 
Main Treatment Period).  For subjects in Cohort 5, (ie,<6 months old), the primary safety 
endpoint was a combination of major and CRNM bleedings occurring during treatment or 
within 3 days of completing or interrupting or stopping study within 6 to 12 weeks period 
plus 3 days.
All bleedings from the first to the last dose of study drug plus 30 days (ie, Overall 
Treatment Period).
A combination of major and CRNM bleedings from the first to the last dose of study drug 
plus 30 days (ie, Overall Treatment Period).
Adjudicated Major and Clinically Relevant Nonmajor Bleeding Events
During the Main Treatment Period and On-treatment, 3 (2.1%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 
(3.5%) subjects in the SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudication-confirmed major/CRNM bleeding 
event (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.139, 2.597; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 10.2 (Table S03).

During the Main Treatment Period and On-treatment, all major/CRNM bleeding events were localised in 
noncritical sites (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding, vaginal bleeding, epistaxis, and other 
bleeding; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.19).  All subjects experienced clinically 
overt bleeding events; in addition, 1 (0.7%) subject in the edoxaban group had a decrease in 
haemoglobin level of ≥2 g/dL, and 1 (0.7%) subject in the edoxaban group and 3 (2.1%) subjects in 
the SOC group had bleeding events that required surgery in an operating room or suite. 
During the Main Treatment Period plus Extension Period and On-treatment, 8 (5.5%) subjects in the 
edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) subjects in the SOC group experienced at least 
1 adjudication-confirmed major/CRNM bleeding event (HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 0.484, 4.503; Module 
5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.7).   
During the Main Treatment Period plus Extension Period and On-treatment, 1 bleeding event occurred 
in a critical site (pulmonary haemorrhage in 1 subject in the edoxaban group), while all other bleeding 
events were localised in noncritical sites (upper and lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding, vaginal 
bleeding, epistaxis, and other bleeding; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.25).  All 
subjects experienced clinically overt bleeding events; in addition, 1 (0.7%) subject in the edoxaban 
group had a decrease in haemoglobin level of ≥2 g/dL, 1 (0.7%) subject in the edoxaban group 
required transfusion(s), and 4 (2.8%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 3 (2.1%) subjects in the 
SOC group required surgery in an operating room or suite. 
During the Overall Treatment Period, 10 (6.9%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) subjects 
in the SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudication-confirmed major/CRNM bleeding event (HR: 
1.85, 95% CI: 0.637, 5.370; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.14).

Adjudicated Major Bleeding Events
During the Main Treatment Period and On-treatment, 1 (0.7%) subject in the edoxaban group 
experienced a major bleeding event (ie, a clinically overt event of epistaxis with a decrease in 
haemoglobin level of ≥2 g/dL; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.3 and 
Table 14.3.1.21).  During the Main Treatment Period and On-treatment, there were no major bleeding 
events in the SOC group. 
During the Main Treatment Period plus Extension Period and On-treatment, 2 (1.4%) subjects in the 
edoxaban group and no subjects in the SOC group experienced an adjudication-confirmed major 
bleeding event (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.9).  The 2 major bleeding events 
were the event of epistaxis described above and a clinically overt event of pulmonary haemorrhage 
(Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.27).  The same number of major bleeding events 
were observed during the Overall Treatment Period (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 
14.3.1.16 and Table 14.3.1.36).
Adjudicated Clinically Relevant Nonmajor Bleeding Events
During the Main Treatment Period, 3 (2.1%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) subjects in 
the SOC group experienced an adjudication-confirmed CRNM bleeding event (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 
0.140, 2.527; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.2).   
During the Main Treatment Period plus Extension Period and On-treatment, 7 (4.8%) subjects in the 
edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) subjects in the SOC group experienced an adjudication-confirmed CRNM 
bleeding event.  All CRNM bleeding events occurred at noncritical sites (ie, upper and lower 
gastrointestinal tract bleeding, vaginal bleeding, epistaxis, and other bleeding) and were clinically overt 
(Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.29).  In addition, 1 (0.7%) subject in the edoxaban 
group required transfusion(s), and 4 (2.8%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 3 (2.1%) subjects in 
the SOC group required surgery in an operating room or suite.
Adjudicated All Bleeding Events
During the Main Treatment Period and On-treatment, 21 (14.5%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 
24 (17.0%) subjects in the SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudication-confirmed bleeding event 
(HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.479, 1.569; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.5).  All bleeding 
events were clinically overt and occurred in noncritical sites (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR 
Table 14.3.1.23). 
During the Main Treatment Period plus Extension Period and On-treatment, 25 (17.2%) subjects in the 
edoxaban group and 24 (17.0%) subjects in the SOC group experienced an adjudication-confirmed 
bleeding event (HR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.570, 1.755; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 
14.3.1.11).  All events but one (ie, pulmonary haemorrhage) were located in noncritical sites, and all 
events but one were clinically overt (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.31). 
During the Overall Treatment Period, 26 (17.9%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 24  (17.0%) 
subjects in the SOC group experienced an adjudication-confirmed bleeding event (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 
0.596, 1.806; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.18).  All events but one (ie,

Adjudicated Bleeding Events – Main Treatment Period
There was 1/109 (0.9%) subject in the edoxaban group and 1/58 (1.7%) subject in the SOC group 
who experienced a CRNM bleeding event during the Main Treatment Period (annualised rate: 0.04, 
edoxaban group; 0.07, SOC group).  The proportion of subjects with all bleeding event was similar in 
the edoxaban and SOC groups: 3.7% and 3.4%, respectively (Table S04).

The CRNM bleeding events were as follows: epistaxis in 1 subject in the edoxaban group and lower 
gastrointestinal tract bleeding (haematochezia) in 1 subject in the SOC group. 
Minor bleeding events were reported in 3 subjects in the edoxaban group: 1 subject had 1 event of 
epistaxis, 1 subject had 3 events of epistaxis, and 1 subject had 1 event of vaginal bleed 
(metrorrhagia).  In addition, 1 subject in the SOC group had a minor event of epistaxis 
(Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 14.3.1.5 and Table 14.3.2.55).

One of the subjects who did not enter the Extension Period experienced a CRNM bleeding event of 
epistaxis during the Main Treatment Period plus 30 days (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 
14.3.1.8).
One subject in the edoxaban group and 1 subject in the SOC group had a CRNM bleeding event that 
required a change in antithrombotic therapy (including interruption or discontinuation of study drug; 
Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 14.3.1.9).  The remaining 3 (2.8%) subjects in the 
edoxaban group and 1 (1.7%) subject in the SOC group had clinically overt bleeding events (non-
CRNM). 
For the aforementioned subjects who did not enter the Extension Period with a CRNM bleeding event of 
epistaxis during the Main Treatment Period plus 30-day Follow-up, a change in antithrombotic therapy 
(including interruption or discontinuation of study drug) was required (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 
CSR Table 14.3.1.12).
Adjudicated Bleeding Events – Extension Period
During the Extension Period plus 3 days, 4 (2.8%) subjects experienced a major, CRNM, or minor 
bleeding event (ie, 3 minor events and 1 major event; Table S05).  No further events were reported in 
the Extension Period plus 30-day Follow-up (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 14.3.1.4). 
Notably, post-database lock, upon query by the Steering Committee chair, 1 adjudicated TE (fatal 
haemorrhagic stroke [in Subject], which occurred 25 days after the last edoxaban dose) was 
subsequently defined by the CEC chair as consistent with the protocol definition of a major bleeding 
event.  When this additional event was considered in the major bleeding category, the total number 
(rate) of major bleeding events in the Extension Period plus 3 days and 30-day Follow-up was 2 
(1.4%) subjects.

Four (2.8%) subjects experienced a total of 6 major, CRNM, or minor bleeding events, including 
cutaneous/soft tissue (haematoma <2.5 cm2), epistaxis, lower gastrointestinal tract (haematochezia), 
oral/pharyngeal (aphthous ulcer), other (haematoma), and vaginal bleeding (menorrhagia) (Module 
5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 14.3.1.6, Table 14.3.1.7, Table 14.3.2.56, and Table 14.3.2.57).

Of the 4 subjects with bleeding events, 1 (0.7%) subject required a change in antithrombotic therapy 
(including interruption or discontinuation of study drug), 3 (2.1%) subjects had clinically overt 
bleeding events (non-CRNM), and 1 (0.7%) subject had a decrease in haemoglobin level of ≥2 g/dL or 
leading to transfusion of the equivalent of ≥2 units of whole blood or red blood cells (Module 5.3.5.1 
DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 14.3.1.10 and Table 14.3.1.11).
Analysis of Adverse Events
In all studies, AEs were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 23.0 
and according to study-specific rules detailed in Module 2.7.4 Table 1.3.  Treatment-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) were defined as events that started on or after the initial dose of study drug or started prior to 
but then worsened after the initial dose of study drug.  For details regarding the assessment of 
seriousness, intensity, and relationship to study drug, refer to Module 2.7.4 Section 1.1.1.2.
Of note, liver function is an area of special interest.  In Studies U312 and U313, critical liver laboratory 
assessments included alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total 
bilirubin (TBL), and alkaline phosphatase.  Particular attention was paid to subjects with ALT or AST ≥3 
× upper limit of normal (ULN) and TBL ≥2 ULN simultaneously without evidence of cholestasis (alkaline 
phosphatase ≥2 × ULN was considered evidence of possible cholestasis) and without alternative 
aetiology for hepatocellular damage.  Hepatic events were adjudicated in a blinded manner by the 
CEC.
Overview of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events
Study U312
Overall, 622 and 386 TEAEs were reported in 103 (71.0%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 95 
(67.4%) subjects in the SOC group, respectively (Table S06).  The proportion of subjects with TEAEs 
leading to premature discontinuation of study drug was higher in the edoxaban group than in the SOC 
group: 5.5% vs. 2.1%.  Other differences in frequency between treatment groups were ≤2.8%.  
Notably, there were 2 deaths in each treatment group.

There were no Hy’s law cases in either group.  None of the subjects had an adjudicated hepatic event 
(Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 14.3.1.16). 
During the Extension Period plus 3 days, there was 1 adjudicated hepatic event (ie, ALT or AST ≥8 × 
ULN; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176-C-U313 CSR Table 14.3.1.17).  
Study U157
No TEAEs leading to discontinuation or other significant TEAEs were reported during the study.
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Clinical laboratory assessments (haematology and serum chemistry) were conducted as detailed in 
Module 2.7.4 Table 1.4.  There were no notable safety observations; mean baseline values and mean 
changes from Baseline were similar between the edoxaban group and SOC group.  
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety
Vital signs and physical examination were conducted in Studies U312, U313, and U157 (for details, 
refer to Module 2.7.4 Section 1.1.1.4 and Section 1.1.1.5).  There were no notable safety observations 
in Studies U312, U313, and U157.  In Studies U312 and U313, mean baseline values and mean 
changes from Baseline were similar between the edoxaban group and SOC group.  
Safety in Special Groups and Situations
Subgroup analyses of adjudicated major or CRNM bleeding events (Studies U312 and U313), major 
bleeding events (Study U312 only), and all bleeding events (Study U312 only) should be interpreted 
with caution because of the small numbers in each subgroup.
Postmarketing Data
A cumulative search of postmarketing reports for edoxaban use in the paediatric population 
(age <18 years) was conducted from the Global Safety Database.  Nine serious and 24 nonserious 
cases were identified; the age range was from neonate to 18 years. 
The serious cases included 1 fatal case (stillbirth).  The father of the neonate started therapy with 
Lixiana 60 mg for DVT and clotting disorder (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome).  Therapy with 
Lixiana was interrupted 3 to 4 days prior to sperm donation for in vitro fertilization in 2017.  The 
mother gave stillbirth in 2018 in the eighth month of pregnancy.  No further information is available for 
this case.
For the other 8 serious cases, there were no bleeding events involved, and company causality was not 
related for all except one.  In that case, a 17-year-old female patient took Lixiana for an unknown 
indication and experienced vomiting, blurred vision, and headache.
Overall, the limited number of off-label use or medication error cases did not show any new safety 
signals or impact on the overall benefit-risk of edoxaban.
8.3.  Discussion on clinical safety
In Study U312, results were comparable between the edoxaban and SOC groups for the primary safety 
objective.  Edoxaban was generally safe and well tolerated in paediatric subjects for the treatment and 
secondary prevention of VTE.  A total of 3 (2.1%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) 
subjects in the SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudication-confirmed major and CRNM bleeding 
Assessment report

Page 123/195
event during the Main Treatment Period and On-treatment (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.139, 2.597). On the 
contrary, during the Overall Treatment Period, 10 (6.9%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 
5 (3.5%) subjects in the SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudication-confirmed major/CRNM 
bleeding event (HR: 1.85, 95% CI: 0.637, 5.370), which means that during follow-up there were 7 
major/CRNM bleedings in the edoxaban group and none in the SOC group. A time-varying risk of 
bleeding with edoxaban could not be confirmed based on the data presented. This is in line with data 
from other studies, such as ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 with a mean study drug exposure of 806 days in the 
edoxaban 60 mg group or post-authorisation safety study ETNA-AF Europe, with a median treatment 
duration of 97.5 weeks during the 48-month follow-up period (see assessment of Q18 of the RSI).
Treatment-emergent AEs in study U312 occurred in 71.0% (103/145) of subjects in the edoxaban 
group and 67.4% (95/141) of subjects in the SOC group.  The most frequently reported TEAEs (ie, 
≥4% of subjects in either group) were headache, vomiting, and pyrexia.  The TEAEs of 
nasopharyngitis, vomiting, headache, dizziness, musculoskeletal chest pain, and rash occurred more 
frequently in the edoxaban group. The TEAEs of ecchymosis and drug hypersensitivity occurred more 
frequently in the SOC group.  The incidences of all other reported TEAEs differed between the groups 
by ≤2.2%.  Overall, no new safety signals related to edoxaban use were observed. In study U312, 
three subject deaths were reported in the edoxaban group, and 3 subject deaths were reported in the 
SOC group.  The deaths in the edoxaban group included cardiogenic shock and endocarditis (1 
subject), seizure and respiratory failure (1 subject), and pleural effusion (1 subject).  The deaths in the 
SOC group included adrenal insufficiency (1 subject); pneumococcal sepsis (1 subject); and 
cardiopulmonary failure, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, and noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema (1 subject).  None of the deaths were considered 
related to study drug. The mean values for the serum chemistry and haematology parameters 
evaluated were generally similar between the 2 groups at Baseline, and the mean changes from 
Baseline for each parameter were generally similar between the groups during the study.  There were 
no clinically meaningful differences in vital signs between the groups (at Baseline and post-Baseline). 
During the Overall Treatment Period, the percentage of subjects who experienced serious TEAEs was 
30.3% (44/145) in the edoxaban group and 26.2% (37/141) in the SOC group.  Overall, 8 
(5.5%) subjects in the edoxaban group experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug vs. 
3 (2.1%) subjects in the SOC group during the Main Treatment Period.
In study U313, results were similar between the 2 treatment groups for the primary safety objective.  
Two subjects, 1 in each treatment group, experienced a CRNM bleeding event in the Main Treatment 
Period (annualised rate: 0.04, edoxaban group; 0.07, SOC group).  Edoxaban was generally safe and 
well tolerated in paediatric subjects with cardiac diseases at risk of TE complications.  No new safety 
signals in this paediatric study population were observed.  During the Main Treatment Period, TEAEs 
occurred in 46.8% of subjects in the edoxaban group and 41.4% of subjects in the SOC group.  
Treatment-emergent AEs considered drug related occurred in 6.4% of subjects in the edoxaban group 
and 1.7% of subjects in the SOC group.  Two subjects died during the Extension Period of the study.  
Both events were severe and considered not related to study drug.  During the Main Treatment Period, 
the percentage of subjects who experienced serious TEAEs was 4.6% (5/109) of subjects in the 
edoxaban group and 5.2% (3/58) in the SOC group.  No subjects in either treatment group 
experienced a study drug-related serious TEAE.  Overall, 2.8% (3/109) of subjects in the edoxaban 
group experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug during the Main Treatment Period.  
One subject had a TEAE of arterial thrombosis leading to discontinuation of study drug that was 
considered by the investigator as study drug related. There were two children with Kawasaki disease in 
the U313 study that developed MI considered related to study medication by the investigator (1 
Subject: who received warfarin 3 mg during main treatment period switched to edoxaban 45 mg 
during extension treatment; Another Subject on SOC (details unknown; active ingredient not

defined)31 mg during main period received edoxaban (dose not recorded in the narrative) The events 
were poorly documented with respect to study medications, doses and narratives. The MAH  provided 
narratives including study medications and doses given at the start of the trial and former medications 
the patients were taken at the onset of the MI (see assessment of Q18 of the RSI).  The events were 
considered as not related to edoxaban (see assessment of Q18 of the RSI).
In Study U157, edoxaban was safe and well tolerated when administered orally in a single low dose or 
single high dose to paediatric subjects from 38 weeks gestation (0 months) to <18 years of age.  Four 
subjects in Cohorts 1a/1b, 6 subjects in Cohorts 2a/2b, 1 subject in Cohorts 3a/3b, and 4 subjects in 
Cohorts 4a/4b experienced TEAEs, of which the majority were mild, resolved without any sequelae, 
and did not require any medical intervention.  Given the small number of subjects in each group, the 
number of TEAEs in the low and high dose groups in each cohort was comparable.  No severe TEAEs 
were observed.  One subject in Cohorts 1a/1b, 2 subjects in Cohorts 2a/2b, 1 subject in Cohorts 
3a/3b, and 1 subject in Cohorts 4a/4b experienced study drug-related TEAEs, of which all were mild.  
No subjects in Cohorts 5a/5b experienced any TEAEs.  In the 12 to <18 years age cohort, 1 subject 
treated with high dose of edoxaban (Cohort 1b) had PT prolonged (without bleeding), which was 
considered to be related to edoxaban.  In the 6 to <12 years age cohort, 1 subject treated with high 
dose of edoxaban (Cohort 2b) had aPTT prolonged (without clinical impact), which was considered to 
be related to edoxaban.  There were no deaths during the study. No subjects experienced serious 
TEAEs or study drug-related serious TEAEs during the study, and there were no TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug. Two subjects experienced 3 serious AEs in the Screening Period and did 
not receive the study drug. No clinically meaningful changes in serum chemistry, haematology 
laboratory evaluations, or vital signs were observed.
In summary, during paediatric studies, edoxaban was generally safe and well tolerated, which is in line 
with the results reported in adults. No major safety issues arose.

PART I Product Overview
The MAH proposes to update text for paediatric population in SmPC section 4.2
“Paediatric population
Edoxaban is not recommended for use in children and adolescents from birth to 18 years of age with 
confirmed VTE (PE and/or DVT) event as the efficacy has not been established. Available data in VTE 
patients are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.”
Assessor’s comments: In light of the available paediatric data based on final results from Study 
DU176b-D-U312, the MAH has proposed to update the SMPC of Edoxaban in several sections. The 
proposed updated mention in the RMP is identical to that proposed in the SmPC in section 4.2.

Assessor’s comments: The DLP of the new version 15.0 of the RMP dated the 30 September 2022. 
In the PSUSA  covering  the  period from  22  oct  2021  to 21 oct  2022, it is indicated  that  “edoxaban  is 
approved in 69 countries and is marketed in 60 countries worldwide”. The difference in dates between 
the DLPs of the PSUR and the RMP may explain the differences in the number of countries where the 
product is authorized and marketed.

SV VII.3.1 Presentation of important Identified Risk and Important potential risks
Bleeding events
DU176b-D-U312 (Hokusai VTE Paediatrics Study):
During  the  Main  Treatment  Period  (randomization  until  the  end  of  Month  3)  and  On-treatment  (on 
study  drug  or  within  3  days  of  interruption  or  discontinuation)  ,  3  (2.1%)  subjects  in  the  edoxaban 
group  and  5  (3.5%)  subjects  in  the  SOC  experienced  at  least  1  adjudicated  confirmed  major/CRNM 
bleeding  event  (HR:  0.60,  95%  CI:  0.139,  2.597;  Module  5.3.5.1  DU176b-D-U312  CSR  Table 
14.3.1.1).
During the Main Treatment Period and On-treatment, all major/CRNM bleeding events were localised in 
noncritical  sites  (upper  and  lower  gastrointestinal  tract  bleeding,  vaginal  bleeding,  epistaxis,  and 
“other”  bleeding;  Module  5.3.5.1  DU176b-D-U312  CSR  Table  14.3.1.19).    All  subjects  experienced 
clinically overt bleeding events; in addition, 1 (0.7%) subject in the edoxaban group had a decrease in 
haemoglobin level of ≥2 g/dL, and 1 (0.7%) subject in the edoxaban group and 3 (2.1%) subjects in 
the SOC group had bleeding events that required surgery in an operating room or suite.
During  the  Main  Treatment  Period  plus  Extension  Period  and  On-treatment,  8  (5.5%)  subjects  in  the 
edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) subjects in the SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudicated confirmed 
major/CRNM  bleeding  event  (HR:  1.48,  95%  CI:  0.484,  4.503;  Module  5.3.5.1  DU176b  D-U312  CSR 
Table 14.3.1.7).  
During the Main Treatment Period plus Extension Period and On-treatment, 1 bleeding event occurred 
in a critical site (pulmonary haemorrhage in 1 subject in the edoxaban group), while all other bleeding 
events  were  localised  in  noncritical  sites  (upper  and  lower  gastrointestinal  tract  bleeding,  vaginal 
bleeding,  epistaxis,  and  “other”  bleeding;  Module  5.3.5.1  DU176b  D  U312  CSR  Table  14.3.1.25).    All 
subjects  experienced  clinically  overt  bleeding  events;  in  addition,  1  (0.7%)  subject  in  the  edoxaban 
group  had  a  decrease  in  haemoglobin  level  of  ≥2  g/dL,  1  (0.7%)  subject  in  the  edoxaban  group 
required  transfusion(s),  4  (2.8%)  subjects  in  the  edoxaban  group  and  3  (2.1%)  subjects  in  the  SOC 
group required surgery in an operating room or suite.

During the Overall Treatment Period, 10 (6.9%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) subjects 
in the SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudicated confirmed major/CRNM bleeding event (HR: 1.85, 
95% CI: 0.637, 5.370; Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.3.1.14).
DU176b-C-U313 (ENNOBLE-ATE Study):
As  shown  in  Table 11  (0.9%)  subject  in  the  edoxaban  group  and  1  (1.7%)  in  the  SOC  group 
experienced  a  CRNM  bleeding  event  (HR  [95%  CI]:  1.24  [0.88,  1.73];  p=0.2184;  Module  5.3.5.1  
DU176b-C-U313  CSR  Table  14.3.1.1).    Annualised  rates  were  0.04  for  the  edoxaban  group  and  0.07 
for the SOC group.
The proportion of subjects with all bleeding event was similar in the edoxaban and SOC groups: 3.7% 
and 3.4%, respectively.

10.4.  Annexes
The annexes have been updated appropriately.
10.5 Overall conclusion on the RMP
The changes to the RMP are not acceptable. RMP version 14.1 remains as the latest approved.
Assessor’s  comments:  Due  to  the  concerns  raised  in  the  framework  of  the  Type  II  Procedure  No. 
EMEA/H/C/WS2409  by  the  CHMP  Rapporteur  and  the  request  to  send  a  new  proposal  for  paediatric 
indication  and  posology  for  the  tablets  (i.e.:  adolescents),  the  proposed  changes  to  the  SmPC  in 
section 4.2 
Paediatric population 
Edoxaban is not recommended for use in children and adolescents from birth to 18 years of age with 
confirmed VTE (PE and/or DVT) event as the efficacy has not been established. Available data in VTE 
patients are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2." 
will likely be modified.
Therefore, the proposed amendment to the RMP "PART I PRODUCT OVERVIEW" can only be validated 
once the conclusions of WS2409 have been approved.
All other proposed changes in the sections of the new RMP version 15.0 are acceptable. Consequently 
RMP version 14.1 remains approved.
New RMP following RSI August 2023
Regarding  this  type  II  Variation  (RSI),  the  MAH  submitted  an  updated  RMP  (version  16.1),  based  on 
the recently approved version 16.0 from procedure EMEA/H/C/XXXX/WS2483.
The main proposed RMP changes (version 16.1) were the following:

patients are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2.”
Assessor’s comments: In view of the responses provided by the MAH, the applicant’s intention of not 
pursuing a paediatric indication and posology is finally endorsed by the Rapporteur. 
The proposed updated mention in the RMP is identical to that proposed in the SmPC in section 4.2. The 
other  minor  changes  concern  updates  to  Annex  8  (summary  of  changes  to  the  RMP)  concerning  the 
latest versions of the RMP 15.0/15.1/16.0/16.1.
Other changes regarding paediatric data included in the last RMP (version 16.0) have been approved 
from procedure EMEA/H/C/XXXX/WS2483.
Consequently, the proposed amendment RMP version 16.1 is acceptable. At the end of the procedure 
the applicant submitted version 17.0 identical with version 16.1 to provide format of the major version 
in line with the "Guidance on the format of the risk management plan (RMP) in the EU – in integrated 
format". 
MS1 comments:
The PRAC Rapporteur’s assessment is supported. In particular, it is supported to remove paediatric use 
from the summary of safety concerns, as this is not an indicated population and as the paediatric study 
is now completed.
MS2 comments:
We support Rapp's AR and have no further comments.
11.  Changes to the Product Information
In light of the paediatric data described in the dossier, the MAH proposes updates to Sections 4.2, 4.8, 
5.1, and 5.2 of the edoxaban Summary of Product Characteristics as follows:




Section 4.2: This section has been updated to confirm edoxaban is not recommended in 
the paediatric population.
Section 4.8: This section has been updated to confirm that no new adverse reactions were 
observed in paediatric clinical studies.
Section 5.1: A summary of results from available efficacy and safety data of the pivotal 
paediatric clinical Study U312 has been implemented.
Section 5.2: This section has been updated to include overall PK conclusions from 
paediatric clinical Studies U312, U313, and U157.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
edoxaban in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of arterial thrombosis, 
treatment of thromboembolism and prevention of thromboembolism (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use).
The safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of edoxaban in paediatric 
subjects from birth to 18 years of age with VTE and cardiac diseases at risk of thrombotic 
events were evaluated in two Phase 3 studies (Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS and ENNOBLE-
ATE). The pivotal paediatric study, Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS, is described below.
In the pivotal study (Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS), a Phase 3, open-label, randomised, multi-
centre, controlled study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
edoxaban and compare the efficacy and safety of edoxaban with standard of care (SOC) 
anticoagulant therapy in paediatric subjects from birth to less than 18 years of age with 
confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE), a total of 290 subjects were randomised into 
the study: 147 in the edoxaban group and 143 in the SOC group, of which 286 subjects took 
at least one dose of study medication (mITT); 145 subjects in the edoxaban group and 141 
subjects in the SOC group.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite endpoint of symptomatic recurrent venous 
thromboembolic disease, death as result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic 
burden during the first 3-month period (intended duration of treatment was 6 to 12 weeks 
for paediatric patients from birth to less than 6 months of age).
The HR for the edoxaban group versus the SOC group was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.594 to 1.719). 
The upper bound of the 95% CI (1.719) exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 
1.5, hence the non-inferiority of edoxaban versus SOC was not confirmed (see Table 12).

Assessor’s comments.
In response to MS comments on the SmPC, the Company has sent a modified version of sections 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 on 06 October 2023. All changes detailed below are acceptable for the Rapporteur.
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 136/195
Section 4.8. Undesirable effects. 
The Applicant proposes to maintain the text related to the primary safety endpoint and CRNM bleeding 
events in section 5.1., as this is consistent with the current SmPC guideline and the other DOAC’s 
labels such as Xarelto, Pradaxa and Apixaban. This would further support harmonisation across the 
labels in the DOAC’s class.
In order to accommodate the MS comment, the MAH has proposed to add information to Section 4.8, 
which is similar to Pradaxa EU SmPC (please see above, text highlighted in yellow): “Overall, the 
safety profile in children was similar as in the adult patient population (see Table 3). In total, 16.6% of 
paediatric patients treated with edoxaban for VTE experienced adverse reactions.  
Section 5.1. Pharmacodynamic properties. 
In response to MS comments, the Rapp has replaced the abbreviation SOC (standard of care) by 
“standard of care” and/or “control group”, in order to avoid confusion with the same abbreviation 
included in section 4.8 for SOC (System Organ Class).
Also, the MAH has included two decimals instead of three in the description of the HR and 
corresponding 95% CIs for the primary endpoint.
The posology used for edoxaban in the paediatric pivotal trial is a relevant information, and therefore a 
description of the edoxaban doses used in the HOKUSAI-VTE paediatrics was added.
Section 5.2. Pharmacokinetic properties
“Children” has been be replaced by “adolescents” (highlighted in yellow) after a comment from NL. 
NL also commented that the PK information in section 5.2 would be as informative as possible for PK 
people and others involved. It was asked to the applicant to mention more specifically the age 
categories studied down to 0-<6 months, and 6-12 months and with which administered doses the 
same exposure as in adults was attained.
Per the Agency’s comment, the MAH has added more detailed paediatric PK data to section 5.2. The 
number of paediatric subjects (N = 141) included in the population PK analysis and the related number 
per age category are provided. The observed geometric mean trough exposures in each age group in 
the two Phase 3 trials (Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS and ENNOBLE-ATE) are added. In accordance to the 
SmPC Guideline results of pharmacokinetic studies in the different paediatric age groups are 
summarized and compared to adults, and uncertainties due to the large inter-individual variability and 
small sample size of paediatric pharmacodynamic data are also stated.
The implemented changes are appropriate for the Rapporteur.
Finally, in accordance to the SmPC Guideline, the MAH has included a reference to the uncertainty of 
the paediatric pharmacodynamics date due to the large inter-individual.
The implemented changes are appropriate for the Rapporteur.

Clinical aspects
Bioanalytical methods
1. The Applicant should submit a list with the GCP regulatory inspections conducted by US FDA or 
members States of the European Union in the clinical and the bioanalytical centre 
2. For the bioanalytical report 141052AKR_DEN of study DU176b-A-U157, the bioanalytical report 
160607ASMG_DEN of study DU176b-D-U312 and the bioanalytical report 180260AKR_DEN of 
study DU176b-D-U313, the applicant should clarify the number of subject samples in each run, 
since this information has not been found in the bioanalytical reports, and comment if the number 
of QCs is at least 5% of the analysed study samples
3. For the bioanalytical report 160607ASMG_DEN of study DU176b-D-U312, the applicant should 
discuss if in run 16 any sample was diluted for the parent compound DU-176 since dilution QCs 
failed in that run.
4. For the bioanalytical report 180260AKR_DEN of study DU176b-D-U313, the applicant should clarify 
if any sample was diluted in run 8 for the parent compound DU-176b.
5. The applicant should clarify the actual analyte that is measured, DU-176 (edoxaban) or DU-176b 
(edoxaban tosylate). As the same bioanalytical method is employed for the analysis of the study 
samples of the three studies (DU176b-A-U157, DU176b-D-U312 and DU176b-D-U313), the 
bioanalytical report should be consistent in the analyte that is measured. However, bioanalytical 
reports 141052AKR_DEN and 180260AKR_DEN refer to the quantitative determination of DU-176b 
and the bioanalytical report 160607ASMG_DEN refers to quantitative determination of DU-176. It 
is expected that the free form of the salt is being measured, but this would imply that two 
bioanalytical reports are incorrect. The Applicant should clarify if this may have impacted the 
accuracy of the reported concentrations (e.g. by using the wrong molecular weight of the analyte).
Pharmacokinetics & Pharmacodynamics
6. When comparing the population PK model of edoxaban in adult and pediatric patients, despite 
similar structural definition was assumed among both populations, large differences were detected 
on the estimates of the structural parameters of both models, that suggest that differences in the 
PK properties of edoxaban exist on absorption and distribution not explained by allometric effects.  
The Applicant is requested to discuss the possible mechanisms (covariates) that can explain these 
differences.
7. DV vs IPRED plot shows an under-prediction of inter-individual variability, since data points are not 
aligned around the identity line. The Applicant should clarify whether additional inter-individual 
random effects were tested on other PK parameters of the model.
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 138/195
8. The Applicant should provide the simulated exposure for each age, eGFR and body weight cohort 
with the proposed dosing regimens, including the median (50th percentile) and extreme 
percentiles (5th and 95th) of the pediatric (simulated) and adult patients (observed) in order to 
clarify whether similar exposure would be achieved.
9. Based on the PK/PD relationships that have been established across the three PD endpoints, 
showing that a moderate-to-high PD response of anti-Xa activity, prothrombin time and activated 
partial thromboplastin time is expected in the exposure range of 150-300 ng/mL of edoxaban, it 
would be highly informative to evaluate the optimal dosing regimens proposed able to achieve the 
PK range of 150-300 ng/mL in at least the 80% of the pediatric population for each age, eGFR and 
body weight cohort. 
Efficacy
10. A paediatric indication could be potentially approvable on the basis of an extrapolation exercise 
from adults (EMA/199678/2016) (indication same as in adults: treatment and secondary 
prevention of VTE), a popPK model able to establish a paediatric dose (see OC of PK/PD) and 
exploratory efficacy and safety data from study U312 in children with VTE (the paediatric 
addendum on VTE prophylaxis and treatment, EMA/CHMP/763438/2017, does not require a formal 
hypothesis of non-inferiority at the time of designing VTE paediatric phase III trials).  In this 
respect:
a. An extrapolation exercise should be proposed. The applicant is invited to justify that the 
consequences of inhibiting FXa is comparable in children and adults (i.e.: similar 
pharmacodynamics in adults and children). Also please address whether the exploratory 
results of efficacy in children are not heterogeneous compared with those reported in 
adults. For this purpose, a meta-analysis may be conducted in order to explore potential 
heterogeneity in efficacy between adults and children including HOKUSAI-VTE adults and 
Hokusai VTE PEDIATRICS, using total recurrent VTE as primary efficacy endpoint and Major 
and CRNMB as primary safety endpoint, for overall study period with rates adjusted by 
length of follow up (i.e.: events per month or per year).
b. The objective of this paediatric development should be to find a pediatric dose that 
provides a similar exposure than in adults for the tablets (in children aged 12 years and 
above) and granules (in children of less than 12 years) following a refinement of the pop-
PK and PK/PD models (see also OCs of PK/PD). A paediatric posology should be proposed 
for the tablets (i.e.: adolescents) in the context of current WS procedure. A further 
extension application for the granules for oral suspension should be considered in the 
event of a potential positive outcome of current procedure in order to address the 
possibility of extending the VTE indication for children less than 12 years old. The applicant 
should also discuss whether the edoxaban 15 mg dose tablets could be suitable for children 
in the eventual absence of a paediatric formulation (i.e.: granules for suspension).
11. The applicant should also provide sensitivity analyses of Hokusai VTE pediatrics using as primary 
endpoints those used in EINSTEIN Junior with rivaroxaban (symptomatic recurrent VTE) [Male et 
al. Lancet Haematol. 2020;7:e18-e27] and DIVERSITY study with dabigatran (combined endpoint 
of complete thrombus resolution, absence of recurrent VTE and absence of death related to VTE) 
[Halton et al. Lancet Haematol. 2021;322-e33] in order to put into context comparable paediatric 
studies that have used different endpoints and hypotheses.
12. In the phase III U312 study (Hokusai VTE paediatrics) a significant number of index events (46 
events) were not confirmed, but were included in the main analysis. These patients should have 
been excluded from the mITT and PP populations and the main analysis, and only included in 
sensitivity analyses. In this respect: 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 139/195
a. Please, provide efficacy analyses including only confirmed cases of VTE at baseline 
(240: 129 in the edoxaban group and 111 in the SOC group). 
b. An explanation why there are two-fold more unconfirmed cases of the index VTE in the 
SOC group (n= 30) than in the edoxaban group (n=16) would be welcomed. 
c. The description of VTE location of index events is rather scarce (VTE is only 
differentiated into DVT or PE). Please, describe locations of index DVTs (i.e.: lower 
limbs, upper limbs, catheter-associated DVT, cerebral venous thrombosis, etc). 
d. Please provide subgroup analyses of recurrent VTE according to location of index 
DVT/PE.
13. There are two patients that developed symptomatic recurrent DVT while on edoxaban (subjects  
iliac DVTCVC DVT) that are not mentioned in the table 4.8 of the Summary of Clinical 
Pharmacology in relationship with edoxaban levels. The applicant should provide PK data and 
discussions about these two cases if edoxaban levels were available.
14. In study U312, 21 of 26 primary efficacy events in the edoxaban group and 29 of the 31 events in 
the SOC group corresponded to “no change or extension of thrombotic burden”. 
c. The applicant is invited to clarify how many of these events in each group required 
additional treatment (i.e.: a course of parenteral anticoagulation if the children were on 
oral anticoagulation, or an increase in the intensity of parenteral anticoagulation if the 
children were already on parenteral anticoagulation).
d. The applicant should also provide PK data (i.e.: edoxaban levels) in all primary efficacy 
events (not only for the symptomatic ones), and to discuss about a potential relationship 
between edoxaban levels and cases of “no change or extension of thrombotic burden”.
15. The U312 study population is poorly characterized for essential clinical datain relationship with 
main efficacy and safety endpoint results, like efficacy/safety by age ranges (e.g.: 12 to < 18 
years; 6 to < 12 years; 2 to < 6 years; and < 2 years), type of index VTE (e.g.: DVT related to 
central venous catheter, cerebral venous sinus, lower limbs, PE) and type of risk factors 
(persistent, transient or both, cancer yes/no, CVC yes/no). In addition, the presence of cancer and 
chemotherapy with asparaginase are major prothrombotic risk factors that coud result in different 
VTE rates and/or treatment effects. In this respect:
e. The applicant is requested to clarify how many patients were recruited into the U312 
study with cancer and/or asparaginase chemotherapy by treatment group and to 
analyse any potential imbalances between treatments. 
f. All these subpopulations mentioned in the heading should be further analyzed in 
subgroups for efficacy and safety. In particular, recurrent VTE events and 
major/CRNMB should be described in these importants subgroups and summarized in 
tables, despite it is acknowledged that the number of events in subgroups will be low. 
16. The net clinical benefit analysis (Table 3.16 of the summary of clinical efficacy) disfavoured 
edoxaban in study U312, but looking at the VTE events, major bleeding and CRNM bleeding events 
described in other sections, numbers were numerically lower in the edoxaban group versus SOC. 
Please, explain this apparent discrepancy. 
17. In study U313 the results seem worse for patients who switched from SOC to edoxaban (i.e.: SOC-
edoxaban arm) than for those who continued with edoxaban since the start of the study (i.e.: 
edoxaban-edoxaban arm). Please discuss whether switching from edoxaban to SOC could be 
inappropriate for patients well controlled on SOC. 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 140/195
Safety
18. In Study U312, a total of 3 (2.1%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) subjects in the 
SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudication-confirmed major and CRNM bleeding event during 
the Main Treatment Period and On-treatment (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.139, 2.597). On the contrary, 
during the Overall Treatment Period, 10 (6.9%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) 
subjects in the SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudication-confirmed major/CRNM bleeding 
event (HR: 1.85, 95% CI: 0.637, 5.370), which means that during follow-up there were 7 
major/CRNM bleedings in the edoxaban group and none in the SOC group. Please discuss whether 
the risk of bleeding with edoxaban could be time-varying and try to identify any other cause that 
could explain this finding.
19. There were two children with Kawasaki disease in the U313 study that developed MI considered 
related to study medication by the investigator (one subject: warfarin 3 mg switched to edoxaban 
45 mg during extension treatment; one subject: SOC 31 mg, active ingredient not defined, 
followed by edoxaban dose not recorded in the narrative). The events are poorly documented with 
respect to study medications, doses and narratives. Please provide narratives including study 
medications and doses given at the start of the trial and former medications the patients were 
taken at the onset of the MI. An assessment by the Sponsor about causality relationship should 
also be tempted including a discussion about a potential relationship between edoxaban and MI 
from adult and paediatric studies.

The MAH provided a list of the FDA inspections conducted in the bioanalytical site located at. The latest 
inspection was conducted in June 2018, and concluded with no findings. This is acceptable. 
Additionally, the MAH has clarified that no EU inspections have been conducted. 
Conclusion
Issue solved.
Question 2. For the bioanalytical report 141052AKR_DEN of study DU176b-A-U157, the 
bioanalytical report 160607ASMG_DEN of study DU176b-D-U312 and the bioanalytical 
report 180260AKR_DEN of study DU176b-D-U313, the applicant should clarify the number 
of subject samples in each run, since this information has not been found in the 
bioanalytical reports, and comment if the number of QCs is at least 5% of the analysed 
study samples
Summary of the WSA’s response
The key SOPs that governed the sample analysis at the Q 2 Solutions bioanalytical laboratory are 
shown in Table 2.
All 3 SOP versions that were applicable required the number of quality control (QC) samples to be 
≥5% of the study samples within a run. 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 142/195
The minimum number of QC samples analysed within a run would be 12 (4 QC levels, with replicates of 
at least 3 for each level). The 12 QC samples would cover up to 240 samples. The maximum number 
of injections for a sample analysis run does not exceed 192 injections (comprising two 96-well plates), 
which includes calibrators, QC samples, matrix blanks, and study samples. 
The Applicant can therefore confirm that the number of QC samples included would exceed 5% of the 
subject samples analysed in each run.
Assessment of the WSA’s response
The MAH has not provided a clear list of the total number of samples analysed per run for each 
bioanalytical report. However, the MAH has clarified that for each analytical run, the maximum number 
of injections was 192 (comprising two 96-well plates). Thus, the number of QCs included per run (12), 
exceeded 5% of the sample studies analysed per run. This is acceptable according to the 
recommendations of the ICH M10 Guideline. 
Conclusion
Issue solved.
Question 3. For the bioanalytical report 160607ASMG_DEN of study DU176b-D-U312, the 
applicant should discuss if in run 16 any sample was diluted for the parent compound DU-
176 since dilution QCs failed in that run.
Summary of the WSA’s response
The objective of Run 16, as summarised in report 160607ASMG_DEN Table 1, was to analyse samples 
from 3 subjects. The dilution QC results did not pass for DU-176 (160607ASMG_DEN Table 2), while 
they were acceptable for D21-2393 (160607ASMG_DEN Table 3). The failed dilution QC results did not 
impact the DU-176 results reported. Detailed explanations are provided below:


Case 1, 1 sample was re-analysed in Run 16 for D21-2393 since the initial analysis in Run 12 
had a result of below quantitation limit (BLQ) due to dilution (see 160607ASMG_DEN Table 10, 
which describes the repeat analysis of D21-2393). The failed dilution QC results for DU-176 
had no impact for this sample.
Case 2  DU-176 first pass analysis was conducted for 2 samples without dilution in Run 16. The 
results were 18.1 and 54.4 ng/mL (160607ASMG_DEN Table 8) and were BLQ (382 ng/mL) of 
the assay. The failed dilution QC results for DU-176 had no impact for these 2 samples.
Case 3, DU-176 first pass analysis was conducted for 2 samples without dilution in Run 16. The 
results were 8.68 ng/mL and 245 ng/mL (160607ASMG_DEN Table 8) and were BLQ (382 
ng/mL) of the assay. The failed dilution QC results for DU-176 had no impact for these 2 
samples.
Assessment of the WSA’s response
The MAH has clarified that, for Run 16, the dilution QCs failed for DU-176 (Report 160607ASMG_DEN - 
Table 2), but were acceptable for D21-2393 (Report 160607ASMG_DEN- Table 3). The MAH has 
provided a detailed explanation arguing that none of the five samples analysed in Run 16 were diluted 
for DU-176, and thus the failed QCs had no impact on the reported concentrations. This explanation is 
acceptable. 
Conclusion
Issue solved.

Question 4. For the bioanalytical report 180260AKR_DEN of study DU176b-D-U313, the 
applicant should clarify if any sample was diluted in run 8 for the parent compound DU-
176b.
Summary of the WSA’s response
The objective of Run 8, as summarised in 180260AKR_DEN Table 1, was to analyse samples from 
Subjects. Both first pass analysis and re-analysis samples were included in this run. The dilution QC 
results did not pass for DU-176 (180260AKR_DEN Table 2), while they were acceptable for D21-2393 
(180260AKR_DEN Table 3). 
The Sponsor asked Q2 Solutions bioanalytical laboratory whether there were any samples analysed 
with dilution in Run 8 for DU-176. The laboratory responded that there were samples analysed with 
dilution for DU-176b in Run 8. However, due to dilution QC failure in this run, the results for those 
samples were deactivated. Those affected samples were subsequently repeated within Run 9. The 7 
samples analysed with dilution in Run 8 are listed in Table 3.

When a run is rejected for not meeting the acceptance criteria for calibration standards or QC, the 
samples would be re-analysed in later runs. Typically, samples re-analysed for under such situations 
are not included in the repeat analysis table of the sample analysis report. However, the failure of the 
run and the reason of the failure should be reported.
Since Run 8 failed the dilution QCs, it was considered acceptable that the repeat analysis table 
(180260AKR_DEN Table 9) did not include those diluted samples that were not accepted in Run 8 but 
repeated later in Run 9. While the reported DU-176 concentration data were not affected, the Sponsor 
accepts that the run summary table (180260AKR_DEN Table 1) should indicate that 8 samples did not 
pass dilution QC acceptance criteria. The Sponsor proposes to implement this practice for future 
sample analysis studies performed at the laboratory

The MAH indicated that there were samples analysed with dilution for DU-176b in Run 8. However, due 
to dilution QC failure in this run, the results for those samples were deactivated. Those affected 
samples were subsequently repeated within Run 9, however, the reanalysis was not reported in the 
repeat analysis table of the sample analysis report. The MAH proposes to implement this practice for 
future sample analysis studies performed at the laboratory, and this is acceptable. 
Conclusion
Issue solved. 
Question 5. The applicant should clarify the actual analyte that is measured, DU-176 
(edoxaban) or DU-176b (edoxaban tosylate). As the same bioanalytical method is employed 
for the analysis of the study samples of the three studies (DU176b-A-U157, DU176b-D-U312 
and DU176b-D-U313), the bioanalytical report should be consistent in the analyte that is 
measured. However, bioanalytical reports 141052AKR_DEN and 180260AKR_DEN refer to 
the quantitative determination of DU-176b and the bioanalytical report 160607ASMG_DEN 
refers to quantitative determination of DU-176. It is expected that the free form of the salt 
is being measured, but this would imply that two bioanalytical reports are incorrect. The 
Applicant should clarify if this may have impacted the accuracy of the reported 
concentrations (e.g. by using the wrong molecular weight of the analyte).
Summary of the WSA’s response
The free form of edoxaban (DU-176) was measured in each study. The Analytical Method Summary 
document (appended to each bioanalytical report) describes the analytes measured. There is no impact 
to the accuracy of the reported concentrations. The Sponsor will ensure that in future bioanalysis of 
edoxaban, the analyte name will be consistent to reflect that the free form is measured.
Assessment of the WSA’s response
The MAH clarified that for all studies, the free form of edoxaban (DU-176) was measured, confirming 
that there is no impact to the accuracy of the reported concentrations. The MAH is encouraged to 
amend the bioanalytical reports 141052AKR_DEN and 180260AKR_DEN, so that they refer to DU-176 
instead of DU-176b. 
Conclusion
Issue solved. 
Question 6.  When comparing the population PK model of edoxaban in adult and pediatric 
patients, despite similar structural definition was assumed among both populations, large 
differences were detected on the estimates of the structural parameters of both models, 
that suggest that differences in the PK properties of edoxaban exist on absorption and 
distribution not explained by allometric effects. The Applicant is requested to discuss the 
possible mechanisms (covariates) that can explain these differences.
Summary of the WSA’s response
The MAH agrees with the Assessor that the paediatric and adult PopPK analyses (model estimates are 
summarised in Table 1 and Table 2) suggested that the difference between paediatric and adult 
subjects in absorption and distribution of edoxaban might not be well captured with the current 
absorption rate constant and the fixed body weight exponent for volume of 1.0.
Also, the edoxaban absorption rate of oral suspension in paediatric subjects might be different from 
that of tablets in adult subjects. The differences and possible mechanisms for major PK model 
parameter estimates are discussed below.

Apparent clearance (CL/F): Per the CHMP guideline on the evaluation of the PK of medicinal 
products in patients with decreased renal function (EMA/CHMP/83874/2014), it is preferred to estimate 
renal function with estimated eGFR as compared with CrCl. Therefore, eGFR was incorporated in the 
clearance equation of the paediatric PopPK model. In contrast, CrCl was used to estimate renal 
clearance of edoxaban in the adult PopPK model because the guideline was not available at the time of 
the adult PopPK model development. To simplify the comparison, a paediatric subject with a body 
weight of 70 kg and equal CrCl and eGFR of 110 mL/min/1.73 m2 was assumed. The CL/F estimated 
by the paediatric PopPK model is 44.19 L/h. The CL/F estimated by the adult PopPK model is 15.2 + 
0.202 × 110 = 37.42 L/h. The CL/F estimated by the paediatric model is only 18% higher than that 
estimated by the adult model. Actually, CrCl is slightly higher than eGFR because creatinine is secreted 
by the proximal tubule in addition to being filtered by the glomerulus. Thus, a paediatric subject with 
an eGFR of 110 mL/min/1.73 m2 should have a CrCl >110 mL/min/1.73 m2, which may explain the 
lower CL/F estimated by the adult PopPK model (37.42 L/h versus 44.19 L/h).
Central volume of distribution (Vc/F): The paediatric and adult PopPK model-estimated Vc/F 
values are 44 and 209 L, respectively. A 4-fold difference in Vc/F was observed between the models. It 
is recognised that Vc/F can be affected by many factors such as PK sampling time points and sampling 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 148/195
intensity. It is challenging to do intensive PK sampling in paediatric patients. In Study 157, only 4 to 7 
PK samples were collected from each paediatric patient. In Studies 312 and 313, only 2 sparse PK 
samples were collected from each patient. Because of the sparseness of the PK data during the initial 
absorption phase, the Cmax of edoxaban in paediatric patients might not be accurately characterised. 
Furthermore, the formulation may also affect the Cmax of edoxaban in paediatric patients and the 
model estimate of Vc/F. As shown in Figure 1, the paediatric subjects enrolled in the Study 157 high-
dose groups showed median AUC comparable to that in adult patients receiving a 60 mg QD dose but 
higher median Cmax than that in adult patients. The PopPK model-estimated AUC0-24h,ss values 
across 5 age cohorts were comparable to or lower than that observed in adult patients, and the model-
estimated Cmax,ss of children aged 12 to <18 years was lower than that observed in adult patients 
(Table 3). However, the model-estimated Cmax,ss values for the 4 younger cohorts who took oral 
suspension formulation were higher than that observed in adult patients. The PopPK and covariate 
analyses showed that the oral suspension formulation caused a faster oral absorption and higher Cmax 
of edoxaban in paediatric patients but did not affect the bioavailability. The higher Cmax of edoxaban 
in paediatric patients might result in a lower Vc/F. Based on the adult exposure-response analysis, it is 
not evident that Cmax is a predictor of efficacy or safety.

Apparent peripheral volume of distribution (Vp/F): The total volume of distribution (Vc/F + Vp/F) 
values estimated by the paediatric and adult PopPK models are 306 and 301 L, respectively, which are 
comparable. The paediatric and adult PopPK model-estimated Vp/F values are 262 and 92 L, 
respectively. The high estimate of Vp/F by the paediatric PopPK model might be caused by the low 
estimate of Vc/F.
Apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F): The paediatric and adult PopPK model estimated 
Q/F values are 15.7 and 5.9 L/h, respectively. The high estimate of Q/F by the paediatric PopPK model 
was likely caused by the high estimate of Vp/F.
Oral absorption rate constant (Ka): The paediatric and adult PopPK model-estimated Ka values are 
0.365 and 3.36 h-1, respectively. A lag time of 0.25 hours was included in the adult PopPK model 
while no lag time was included in the paediatric PopPK model. The different formulations used in adult 
and paediatric subjects and different physiological characteristics (ie, stomach volume and gastric pH) 
between adult and paediatric subjects might cause different oral absorption rates of edoxaban.
In summary, the PopPK analysis showed that differences in the PK properties of edoxaban exist on 
absorption and distribution between paediatric and adult subjects. Furthermore, the CL/F of edoxaban 
in paediatric subjects is substantially affected by body weight, renal function, and age.
Thus, it would require to develop weight-, age-, and renal function-based doses to achieve edoxaban 
exposures in paediatric patients comparable to those in adult patients.
Assessment of the WSA’s response
The Applicant acknowledge that the absorption and distribution of edoxaban does not seem to be 
properly captured with the current model as there are significant differences between absorption and 
distribution parameters between both adult and paediatric models.
When comparing the population PK model of edoxaban in adult and paediatric patients, there are 
differences on Apparent CL/F (37.42 vs 44.19), Ka (3.36 vs 0.365), Vc (209 vs 44), Vp (92.3 vs 262), 
and Q/F (5.9 vs 15.7). 
The Applicant has partially provided the explanation of these differences, although no clear justification 
regarding additional factors to allometry has been given. 
Regarding the differences in CL/F, eGFR was included to estimate renal function in the paediatric Pop 
PK model, on the other hand, CrCl was used in the adult model. The CL/F parameters were calculated 
for a subject of 70 kg and CrCL and eGFR of 110ml/min/1.73m2. Despite the differences in the 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 150/195
covariate selected for renal function between both populations, pediatric patients show higher CL/F 
value compared to adults. Such relationship is age, body-weight and renal function dependent, so 
additional evidence should be provided in case dose recommendations in younger pediatric patients.
Concerning the Vc/F, the sparse PK sampling in the paediatric studies makes it difficult to properly 
characterize the Cmax in this population, and makes it difficult to properly calculate the Vc/F. In the 
paediatric population, Vc/F is 4-fold lower than the Vc/F in the adult population, which may biased the 
Vp/F. For that reason Q/F is higher in the paediatric population due to the high value of Vp/F. In 
general, the lack of adequate experimental characterization of the alpha- and beta-disposition phases 
may compromise the estimation of Vp/F and Q/F. 
The differences in the Ka are explained by the different formulation used as well as the differences in 
physiological characteristics, although a 10-fold difference is observed.
Overall, the explanations are partially endorsed, although additional efforts would be required to fully 
understand whether the hypothesis are plausible. As a consequence, paediatric doses for each 
paediatric subgroup should be based on age, weight and renal function in order to investigate if those 
patients achieve edoxaban exposures that are comparable to adult (Please refer to question 8).
Conclusion
Issue solved
Question 7.  DV vs IPRED plot shows an under-prediction of inter-individual variability, since 
data points are not aligned around the identity line. The Applicant should clarify whether 
additional interindividual random effects were tested on other PK parameters of the model.
Summary of the WSA’s response
Inter-individual random effects were tested on 3 PK parameters: CL/F, Vc/F (V2/F), and Q/F. The eta-
shrinkages related to IIV for CL/F, Vc/F, and Q/F were 13.3%, 67.4%, and 53.7%, respectively (Table 
1). The high eta-shrinkages for Vc/F and Q/F indicate that the individual parameter estimates were 
considerably shrunken toward the typical values and had only limited value for usage as diagnostics. 
The high shrinkages were likely due to the sparse PK sampling design in the paediatric studies. High 
shrinkages for Vc/F (57.2%) and Q/F (58.7%) were also observed in the adult PopPK model of 
edoxaban (Table 2). Since shrinkage influences Bayesian individual exposure predictions, which 
depend on individual parameter estimates, predicted variability in some exposure measures (eg, 
Cmax) will likely be lower than observed variability in systemic exposure.
Due to the wide distribution of Cmax in paediatric patients, we have assessed IIV on Ka during base 
model development. The estimate of IIV on Ka was very small (0.000042) and did not improve the 
model. Thus, the IIV on Ka was fixed to 0 in the model.
Assessment of the WSA’s response
The Applicant has provided the required explanation. IIV was assessed on Ka during base model 
development, but its estimation was close to the null value and not significant.
Conclusion
Issue not futher pursued.
Question 8. The Applicant should provide the simulated exposure for each age, eGFR and 
body weight cohort with the proposed dosing regimens, including the median (50th 
percentile) and extreme percentiles (5th and 95th) of the paediatric (simulated) and adult 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 151/195
patients (observed) in order to clarify whether similar exposure would be achieved. 
Summary of the WSA’s response
The information is summarised in Table 4 and Table 5. The MAH agrees with the Assessor that the 
paediatric dosing regimens tested in Studies 312 and 313 may lead to an under-exposure in paediatric 
patients compared to adult patients. To accurately match the drug exposure in adult patients, a 20% 
to 50% dose increase may be needed for individual age-, eGFR-, and body weight-based subgroups.
Table 4: Simulated AUC0-24h,ss of Edoxaban for Adolescent Patients by Body Weight
Table 5: Simulated AUC0-24h,ss of Edoxaban for Paediatric Patients by Age and eGFR
Assessment of the WSA’s response
The Applicant provided the requested simulations. The paediatric doses tested in the studies lead to an 
under-exposure in paediatric patients compared to adult patients, especially in adolescent patients 
with high body weight (Table 4) and paediatric patients across different age and eGFR values (Table 
5). Due to the absence of an exposure-safety analysis in pediatric patients, dose selection should be 
established based on achieving similar exposure range compared to the adult patients. In that sense, 
additional simulation-based analyses should be conducted in order to justify the dose selection 
regimen in paediatric patients able to achieve similar exposure compared to the adult patients. 
However, given that the MAH is still not recommending the use of edoxaban in children and, from a 
clinical standpoint, there are reasons to agree on that, due to potential lack of efficacy (see 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 152/195
assessment of MAH answer to Q10 and Q11), these additional simulation-based analyses are not 
further pursued. On the other hand, given that one of the reasons given by the applicant not to 
recommend the use of edoxaban in children is that the use of tablets in children may be associated to 
a 20-30% underexposure compared to the use of edoxaban 60 mg in adults, section 5.2 of the SmPC 
should be amended to reflect this (see Rapporteur’s proposal in the attached PI with track changes). 
Conclusion
Issue solved (not further analyses pursued).
Question 9.  Based on the PK/PD relationships that have been established across the three 
PD endpoints, showing that a moderate-to-high PD response of anti-Xa activity, 
prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time is expected in the exposure 
range of 150-300 ng/mL of edoxaban, it would be highly informative to evaluate the optimal 
dosing regimens proposed able to achieve the PK range of 150-300 ng/mL in at least the 
80% of the paediatric population for each age, eGFR and body weight cohort.
Summary of the WSA’s response
The MAH agrees with the Assessor that a moderate-to-high pharmacodynamic response of anti- Xa 
activity, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time is expected in the plasma 
edoxaban concentration range of 150 to 300 ng/mL. As shown in Figure 2, according to the dose-
exposure relationship in adult patients, a dose >120 mg QD is needed to achieve steady state Cavg 
>150 ng/mL or AUC0-24h >3600 ng•h/mL in adult patients (the dose interval was 24 hours and Cavg 
= AUC0-24h/24). In the previous adult clinical programme, 60 mg QD was determined as the 
efficacious and safe dose in adult VTE patients. Therefore, in the current paediatric programme, the 
paediatric doses were proposed to match edoxaban exposure in adult VTE patients receiving a 60 mg 
QD dose. Achieving Cavg of edoxaban >150 ng in 80% of the paediatric population was not targeted.
Furthermore, the exposure-response analysis for safety (clinically relevant bleeding) conducted in 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients does not support a dose >60 mg. As shown in Figure 3, Cavg,ss 
>100 ng/mL or AUC0-24h,ss >2400 ng•h/mL is associated with an increased major bleeding risk.
Therefore, the paediatric doses of edoxaban were proposed to match 0.5- and 1.5-fold of the median 
exposure (AUC0-24h,ss = 806.5 to 2419.5 ng•h/mL or Cavg,ss = 33.6 to 101 ng/mL) in adult VTE 
patients receiving a 60 mg QD dose.

Assessment of the WSA’s response
The Applicant acknowledge that moderate-to-high PD response of anti-Xa activity, prothrombin time 
and activated partial thromboplastin time is expected in the exposure range of 150-300 ng/mL of 
edoxaban. In order to achieve that exposure a dose regimen greater than 120 mg QD is needed. This 
is not supported by the previous adult VTE program or the exposure-response analysis for safety, 
where higher bleeding events were predicted as Cave increases. Therefore, the selection of the 
exposure range of 60 mg QD of edoxaban for pediatric patients is endorsed, despite the efficacy could 
be compromised. The explanation given by the Applicant is endorsed.
Conclusion
Issue solved
Question 10. A paediatric indication could be potentially approvable on the basis of an extrapolation 
exercise from adults (EMA/199678/2016) (indication same as in adults: treatment and secondary 
prevention of VTE), a popPK model able to establish a paediatric dose (see OC of PK/PD) and 
exploratory efficacy and safety data from study U312 in children with VTE (the paediatric addendum on 
VTE prophylaxis and treatment, EMA/CHMP/763438/2017, does not require a formal hypothesis of 
non-inferiority at the time of designing VTE paediatric phase III trials).  In this respect:
a) An extrapolation exercise should be proposed. The applicant is invited to justify that the 
consequences of inhibiting FXa is comparable in children and adults (i.e.: similar 
pharmacodynamics in adults and children). Also please address whether the exploratory results 
of efficacy in children are not heterogeneous compared with those reported in adults. For this 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 154/195
purpose, a meta-analysis may be conducted in order to explore potential heterogeneity in 
efficacy between adults and children including HOKUSAI-VTE adults and Hokusai VTE 
PEDIATRICS, using total recurrent VTE as primary efficacy endpoint and Major and CRNMB as 
primary safety endpoint, for overall study period with rates adjusted by length of follow up 
(i.e.: events per month or per year).
b) The objective of this paediatric development should be to find a pediatric dose that provides a 
similar exposure than in adults for the tablets (in children aged 12 years and above) and 
granules (in children of less than 12 years) following a refinement of the pop-PK and PK/PD 
models (see also OCs of PK/PD). A paediatric posology should be proposed for the tablets (i.e.: 
adolescents) in the context of current WS procedure. A further extension application for the 
granules for oral suspension should be considered in the event of a potential positive outcome 
of current procedure in order to address the possibility of extending the VTE indication for 
children less than 12 years old. The applicant should also discuss whether the edoxaban 15 mg 
dose tablets could be suitable for children in the eventual absence of a paediatric formulation 
(i.e.: granules for suspension).
 Summary of the WSA’s response
The MAH acknowledges the suggestion from CHMP regarding the potential of filing for the paediatric 
indication; however, based on review of the data available, the MAH does not intend to seek a 
paediatric indication for edoxaban as the benefit-risk profile remains uncertain. 
The MAH would like to highlight that prior to initiating the paediatric development programme, the PIP 
was discussed and agreed with the PDCO.  The agreed PIP comprised 3 edoxaban clinical studies:
 One Phase 1 dose-finding study, DU176b-A-U157: “A phase 1, open-label, single-dose, 
non-randomized study to evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of edoxaban 
in pediatric patients” (referred to as Study U157)

Two Phase 3 studies: 

Treatment of VTE registrational study, DU176b-D-U312: “A Phase 3, open-label, 
randomized, multicenter, controlled trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of edoxaban and to compare the efficacy and safety of edoxaban 
with standard-of-care anticoagulant therapy in pediatric subjects from birth to less 
than 18 years of age with confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE)” (hereafter 
referred to as Study U312)

Prophylaxis of arterial thromboembolism study, DU176b-C-U313: “An open-label, 
randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, observational trial to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of edoxaban tosylate in children from 38 weeks gestational age to less than 18 
years of age with cardiac diseases at risk of thromboembolic events” (hereafter 
referred to as Study U313)
The pivotal study for the paediatric clinical programme, Study U312, was conducted in paediatric 
patients with confirmed VTE.  The study was designed with the agreement of the PDCO to demonstrate 
the NI of edoxaban versus SOC treatment and used an NI margin of 1.5 extrapolated from the adult 
Hokusai VTE study (Study DU176b-D-U305; hereafter referred to as Study U305).  As indicated in the 
Study U312 CSR, the study did not meet the primary efficacy objective of demonstrating the NI of 
edoxaban to SOC.  
A total of 26 (17.9%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 31 (22.0%) subjects in the SOC group had 
primary efficacy events during the Main Treatment Period.  Symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in a 
total of 5 (3.4%) subjects in the edoxaban group compared with 2 (1.4%) subjects in the SOC group.  
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 155/195
There was 1 (0.7%) unexplained death in each group for which VTE could not be ruled out.  There was 
no change or extension of thrombotic burden based on imaging in 21 (14.5%) subjects in the 
edoxaban group and 29 (20.6%) subjects in the SOC group.  The HR (edoxaban/SOC) was 1.01 with 
2-sided 95% CI of (0.594, 1.719).  The upper bound of the 95% CI (ie, 1.719) was above the 
prespecified NI margin of 1.5.  Therefore, the study failed to show NI of edoxaban compared with SOC.  
As the study did not achieve the primary efficacy objective, the benefit-risk profile of edoxaban could 
not be ascertained in the paediatric population studied.  
a. Extrapolation
Refinement of PopPK and PK/PD models for dose extrapolation
In Study 312, two sparse PK samples were collected on the day of the fifth dose of edoxaban (Day 5 
+ 3 days).  Predose PK samples were collected from all subjects participating in the PK/PD 
assessment (N = 69).  Postdose PK samples were taken at either any time between 0.5 and 3 hours 
after dosing or at any time between 3 and 8 hours after dosing.  In Study U313, two sparse PK 
samples (predose and any time between 1 and 3 hours after dosing) were collected from 73 subjects 
during the Month 1 Visit.  The PD sampling times for measurement of PT, aPTT, and anti-FXa were at 
the same time as the PK samples.
The sparse PK sampling design during the initial oral absorption phase in the paediatric studies did not 
permit precise estimation of several population- and individual-level PK parameters, as demonstrated 
by the high ETA shrinkage (shrinkage of ETA of approximately 60% for Vc/F and Q2/F; see response to 
Question 6 and Question 7).  The MAH attempted estimation of the IIV on the Ka during the 
development of the base model.  However, the estimate of IIV on Ka was very small (0.000042) and 
did not improve the model fit in a statistically significant manner.  Furthermore, the exposure-response 
analysis conducted in adult VTE subjects showed that the probability of recurrent VTE decreased with 
increasing edoxaban Cavg or AUC.1  On the other hand, no statistically significant exposure‐response 
relationships were found for clinically relevant bleeding or MACE in adult VTE subjects.  These findings 
justified the use of AUC instead of Cmax for extrapolation and exposure matching in the paediatric VTE 
population.  Since the edoxaban population and individual CL/F values needed for AUC calculation 
seemed to be well estimated in the paediatric PopPK model ETA-shrinkage for the IIV on CL/F = 13.3% 
and relative standard error of CL/F population estimate = 3%), further refinement of the model was 
deemed to be unnecessary.  
The MAH investigated the PK/PD relationship of edoxaban in paediatric subjects.  Anti-FXa activity, 
aPTT, and PT all exhibited exposure-dependent responses to edoxaban in children of different ages and 
adult subjects (Figure 1, Figure 3, and Figure 4, respectively).  Edoxaban exhibited similar PK 
relationships for anti-FXa activity between paediatric and adult subjects; however, anti-FXa activity is 
considered a marker of edoxaban (and DOACs) exposure (PK) and not directly related to clinical 
outcomes.2,3,4 
In contrast, both PT and aPTT are considered markers of the PD of edoxaban.  However, the 
considerable variation in the PD biomarkers PT and aPTT for edoxaban (see below), especially in the 
lower age cohort of subjects, contributes more uncertainty when considered alongside the Study U312 
results (ie, the low number of symptomatic recurrent VTE events in both groups in the study and the 
study not meeting the primary objective of demonstrating NI).  As such, the MAH concludes that the 
benefit-risk profile remains uncertain for edoxaban use in paediatric patients.

The relationship between anti-FXa activity or PT and plasma edoxaban concentration was compared 
between paediatric subjects across 5 age cohorts and adult subjects with VTE enrolled in the Hokusai 
VTE adult study (Study U305).  Because aPTT data were not collected in Study U305, the aPTT and PK 
data collected from healthy adult subjects enrolled in the Phase 1 studies were used for the paediatric 
and adult PK-aPTT relationship comparison.  
As shown in Figure 1, the anti-FXa activity data were generally comparable between paediatric 
subjects and adult subjects in the plasma edoxaban concentration range of 0 to 200 ng/mL.  It is 
expected to see a linear correlation for anti-FXa activity and plasma edoxaban concentrations in both 
paediatric and adult subjects.  A prior study showed that a commercially available anti-FXa 
chromogenic assay accurately estimated plasma edoxaban concentrations in adult healthy subjects 
taking edoxaban 60 and 90 mg QD doses.5  A good correlation was observed between plasma 
concentrations of edoxaban and its metabolite concentrations determined by anti-FXa assay and liquid 
chromatography-mass spectroscopy.  The slope and intercept of anti-FXa and plasma edoxaban 
concentration correlation curve are dependent on the anti-FXa chromogenic assay rather than the age 
or demographic characteristics of study subjects (Figure 2).

Thus, overlaid anti-FXa and plasma edoxaban concentration curves should not be used to support a 
similar PK/PD relationship between paediatric and adult subjects.  Anti-FXa level cannot be used as a 
direct marker of clinical efficacy for any specific oral direct Xa inhibitor.6  
To assess PD similarity between paediatric and adult subjects, aPTT and PT should be used.  However, 
due to the small sample size and large IIV in the paediatric aPTT and PT data, the similarity in the PD 
relationship for aPTT or PT between paediatric and adult subjects could not be formally evaluated 
(Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively).  
As described above, the considerable variation in the PD biomarkers PT and aPTT for edoxaban, 
especially in the lower age cohorts, contributes additional uncertainty when considered alongside the 
Study U312 results (ie, the low number of symptomatic recurrent VTE events in both groups in the 
study and the study not meeting the primary objective of demonstrating NI); hence, the benefit-risk 
profile remains uncertain for edoxaban use in paediatric patients.

Investigation of potential heterogeneity in efficacy between adults and children
To explore potential heterogeneity in efficacy and safety between adults and children included in the 
Hokusai-VTE adult study (Study U305) and Hokusai VTE paediatric study (Study U312), a meta-
analysis was performed using CEC-confirmed total recurrent VTE as the primary efficacy endpoint and 
major or CRNM bleeding as the primary safety endpoint for the overall study period, with rates 
adjusted by length of follow up (ie, percentage of subjects with events per year).  The meta-analysis 
was performed based on summary statistics, and a test of the heterogeneity between the 2 studies 
was performed.  
The distribution of VTE events in paediatric patients is bimodal, with the majority of events occurring in 
neonates and infants7,8 and in adolescents.9  In contrast to VTE in adults, VTE in children is rarely truly 
idiopathic in nature.10  Approximately ≥90% of children with VTE have a serious underlying disorder 
(eg, cancer, congenital heart disease, nephrotic syndrome, etc; a precipitation factor [CVC, infection, 
trauma, or surgery] and/or a hereditary prothrombotic condition).  Apart from better awareness for 
VTE, the widely observed increase in childhood VTE is mainly due to the medical progress in the 
treatment and/or interventions of critically ill children.  The typical location of VTE in neonates and 
infants differs from that in adults and adolescents.  In neonates and young children, VTE occurs more 
often (60%) in the upper extremity venous system (versus only 2% in adults).  This reflects the 
common placement of CVC (the most frequent precipitating factor of VTE in children) via the internal 
jugular or subclavian veins.  Loss of catheter patency and loss of central venous access have important 
consequences in children with cancer and other serious medical conditions.10  Non-extremity DVT (eg, 
cerebral sinus vein thrombosis and renal or portal VTE) is also more frequent in children than in 
adults.11,12  The location of the clots results in fewer classic VTE symptoms and may also impair the 
effective/precise diagnosis with standard measures (ie, compression ultrasound cannot be performed 
in these locations).
Although both studies have common efficacy endpoints of recurrent VTE events and death where VTE 
could not be ruled out, there are differences between them that should be noted.  The population in 
Study U305 included elderly patients with different comorbidities compared with Study U312, which 
was conducted in paediatric patients with different comorbidities (ie, hypercoagulability conditions, 
malignancy, genetic disorders, etc with different comedications including chemotherapy and 
predisposing factors for developing TE events).  For example,



In Study U305, 32.8% of subjects (2704/8240 subjects) were ≥65 years of age, and 
13.4% of subjects (1104/8240 subjects) were ≥75 years of age.  A history of hypertension 
was reported for 39.6% of subjects (3262/8240 subjects), dyslipidaemia for 22.1% of 
subjects (1817/8240 subjects), diabetes for 10.5% of subjects (864/8240 subjects), and 
cancer for 9.4% of subjects (771/8240 subjects; DU176b-D-U305 CSR Table 14.1.3.5), 
concluding different concomitant comorbidities and risk factors.  
In Study U312, hypertension was reported for 3.8% of subjects (11/286 subjects), 
diabetes mellitus for 0.3% of subjects (1/286 subjects), and hyperlipidaemia for 1.0% of 
subjects (3/286 subjects; dyslipidaemia was not reported; DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 
14.1.2.4), highlighting the different patient population with different comorbidities. 
It should also be recognised that the incidence and prevalence of VTE events is lower 
(much lower in the younger age cohorts) when compared with the incidence and 
prevalence of VTE in adult patients.13 
Performing a meta-analysis would provide limited information due to the huge difference in sample 
size between the 2 studies.  When pooling the studies, the final outcome would be reflective of the

findings for Study U305.  Noting these reservations, the MAH has provided the meta-analysis for 
information in an Annex to the response to question 10.
Alternatively, to investigate potential heterogeneity, Table 3 provides a summary of the annualised 
rates of adjudicated symptomatic recurrent VTE and major or CRNM bleeding in Studies U312 and 305.  
The annualised rate provides more validity, especially with the lower number of reported events in 
Study U312. 
The annualised rate of symptomatic recurrent VTE was higher for edoxaban in paediatric subjects in 
Study U312 than in adult subjects in Study U305 (15.6% versus 3.5%, respectively), whereas the 
annualised rate of symptomatic recurrent VTE was more similar for the SOC groups across the studies 
(6.4% and 3.9%, respectively).  The rate ratio estimate (95% CI) for the annualised rate of 
symptomatic VTE on SOC versus edoxaban was 0.41 (0.08, 2.13) for paediatric subjects in Study U312 
and 1.12 (0.89, 1.42) for adult subjects in Study U305.  
The annualised rate estimates of symptomatic recurrent VTE on edoxaban were compared between the 
2 studies. 

The ratio (Study U305/Study U312) for the symptomatic recurrent VTE was 0.22 with 95% 
CI (0.09, 0.54); P value = 0.0010.  These results show that the adult subjects on 
edoxaban had a significantly lower rate of symptomatic recurrent VTE compared with the 
paediatric subjects, indicating potential heterogeneity in efficacy between the 2 studies.
The annualised rate of major or CRNM bleeding was similar across both populations.  The rate ratio 
estimate (95% CI) for the annualised rate of major or CRNM bleeding on SOC versus edoxaban was 
1.70 (0.41, 7.13) for paediatric subjects in Study U312 and 1.15 (1.01, 1.32) for adult subjects in 
Study U305.  
The annualised rate estimates of major or CRNM bleeding on edoxaban were compared between the 2 
studies.  

The ratio (Study U305/Study U312) of major or CRNM bleeding on edoxaban was 1.24 with 
95% CI (0.40, 3.87); P value = 0.7062.  No potential heterogeneity was found in major or 
CRNM bleeding (the 95% CI for the ratio spanned unity), indicating similar rates in adults 
and children.  
Hence, the rate of symptomatic recurrent VTE on edoxaban appeared different (ie, higher) in children 
compared with adults, whereas the risk of bleeding was similar in children and adults.

Notes: The Main Treatment Period is defined as from randomisation to the Month 3 Visit + 3 days.
Annualised rate = # subject with event/Total time at risk (years). Total time at risk is the sum, across 
subjects, of the number of "at risk" years. For each subject, the "at risk" years = (the event or 
censoring – date of randomisation + 1)/365.25. If a subject has multiple events, the time of the first 
event is used.
There is still a scarcity of data on the relationship between age and long-term clinical outcomes of 
patients with VTE.  In the current real-world VTE registry, there was no significant difference in the risk 
of major bleeding depending on different age groups, while younger patients showed an excess risk for 
recurrent VTE compared with older patients.14 
Overall, comparing across the studies shows that the risk of symptomatic recurrent VTE on edoxaban 
appears different (ie, higher) in children compared with adults (mainly due to different 
etiopathogenesis for VTE occurrence and different underlying medical comorbidities), indicating 
heterogenicity in the incidence of VTE between the adult and the paediatric populations; whereas the 
risk of major or CRNM bleeding was similar in the 2 populations. 
These results indicate that there is potential heterogeneity in efficacy outcome between adults and 
children on edoxaban.  A full assessment of the risk given this discrepancy between children and adults 
is difficult given the very low number of symptomatic recurrent events observed in children in Study 
U312.  As such, the MAH concludes that the benefit-risk profile for edoxaban remains uncertain for the 
paediatric indication.
b. Proposal for Paediatric Dose and Posology 
The MAH agrees with the Assessors that the proposed dosing regimens in paediatric patients could lead 
to an underexposure in paediatric patients compared with adult patients (Figure 5).  
Per the post hoc PopPK simulation, the median AUC0-24h,ss values for 0 to <0.5 years, 0.5 to 
<2 years, 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years of age cohorts are 1250, 1310, 1270, 
1210, and 1160 ng*h/mL, respectively, which are 19% to 28% lower than the median AUC0-24h,ss 
(1613 ng*h/mL) of adult VTE subjects receiving the 60 mg QD dose.  The proposed doses for 
adolescents with body weight of 30 to <60 kg and ≥60 kg resulted in median AUC0-24h,ss values of 
27% and 31%, respectively, lower than that of adult VTE subjects receiving the 60 mg QD dose.
To accurately match the drug exposure in adult patients, a 20% to 50% dose increase could be needed 
for individual age-, eGFR-, and body weight-based subgroups.

The relative oral bioavailability of granules for oral suspension versus tablets was assessed in healthy 
adult subjects (Study DU176b-A-U154).  As shown in Table 4, two 30-mg tablets and a 10-mL oral 
suspension (6 mg/mL) had similar exposure in healthy adult subjects, but the Cmax of the oral 
suspension was 13% lower than that of the tablets.  The relative bioavailability of oral suspension and 
tablets was not evaluated in any paediatric studies.  The pooled PopPK analysis using data from 3 
paediatric studies estimated the oral absorption rate of tablets to be 23% lower than that of oral 
suspension, but the formulation had no statistically significant effect on the oral bioavailability in the 
model.  In the whole paediatric clinical development programme, only 6 children aged 6 to <12 years 
were administered at least 1 edoxaban dose as tablets (30 mg tablets and/or 15 mg tablets); however, 
PK data were not collected from these subjects (Table 5 and Table 6).  No children under 6 years of 
age were administered the tablet formulation.  Therefore, it is unknown whether the tablet and granule 
formulations are bioequivalent in subjects younger than 12 years.

weight-calculated dose via administration of tablets, leading to overdosing or underdosing in some 
subjects.  The target dose for subjects aged 6 to <12 years is 1.2 mg/kg.  Only subjects weighing 18 
or 36 kg would receive the correct dose when administered edoxaban tablets, as illustrated in Table 7.

Overall, regarding dose and posology, similar exposure as obtained in adults was not achieved using 
the proposed dose regimen of edoxaban tablets in subjects 12 to <18 years of age (rather, it could 
lead to an approximately 20% to 30% underexposure in paediatric compared to adult patients).  It is 
unknown whether the tablet and granule formulations are bioequivalent in patients younger than 12 
years.  There are inadequate PK/PD, efficacy, or safety data to support the use of the edoxaban 30 mg 
or 15 mg tablets in patients younger than 12 years of age.

Overall Summary
The MAH does not recommend edoxaban to be used for a paediatric indication due to uncertainty 
about benefit-risk profile of edoxaban in the paediatric population as summarised below.  




Study U312 was specifically designed to compare edoxaban to SOC in a paediatric 
population.  Its failure to demonstrate NI provides uncertainty with regard to the use of 
edoxaban in this population.  
A comparison of Studies U305 and U312 shows a lower annualised rate of symptomatic 
recurrent VTE occurrence in adults compared to children on edoxaban (annualised rate 
ratio [adults/paediatric] of 0.22 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.54]; P value = 0.0010), which also adds 
uncertainty that edoxaban would offer at least an equal benefit to approved SOC in 
children.  A full assessment of the risk given this discrepancy between children and adults 
is difficult given the very low number of symptomatic recurrent events observed in children 
in Study U312.  The risk of major or CRNM bleeding was similar in the 2 populations.
As expected, edoxaban exhibits similar PK relationships for anti-FXa activity between 
paediatric and adult subjects.  Anti-FXa level cannot be used as a direct marker of clinical 
efficacy for any specific oral direct Xa inhibitor.6
The PD biomarkers PT and aPTT show considerable variation for edoxaban in paediatric 
subjects, especially in the lower age cohorts, which contributes further uncertainty when 
considered alongside the study results (the low number of symptomatic recurrent VTE 
events reported in the Study U312 and the study not meeting the primary objective of 
demonstrating NI).  Therefore, the MAH concludes that the benefit-risk profile for 
edoxaban in the paediatric indication remains uncertain. 
Currently, numerous treatment options are available for paediatric VTE, including the direct oral 
anticoagulants rivaroxaban and dabigatran, in addition to the traditional therapy with heparin (eg, 
enoxaparin/unfractionated heparin/fondaparinux, etc) and the VKAs (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, 
etc).  Given the treatment options available for paediatric patients and the uncertainty that edoxaban 
offers at least an equivalent benefit to SOC in this patient population, the MAH does not consider that a 
recommendation for formulation development is warranted.
Edoxaban does not fulfil an unmet medical need in terms of treatment options for paediatric VTE.  The 
benefit-risk profile for edoxaban in children remains uncertain with the results of Study U312; 
therefore, the MAH does not support an edoxaban paediatric indication.
The MAH proposes to include relevant information regarding outcomes for the paediatric clinical 
studies, which were performed in compliance with the PIP in the product information as part of this 
variation application.

Assessment of the WSA’s response
The applicant has provided and discussed some key pitfalls of the paediatric development of edoxaban 
in children. Regarding dose and posology, similar exposure as obtained in adults was NOT achieved 
using the proposed dose regimen of edoxaban tablets in subjects 12 to <18 years of age (rather, it 
could lead to an approximately 20% to 30% underexposure). This was translated into a higher 
annualized rate of recurrent symptomatic VTE with edoxaban vs. SOC in the meta-analysis provided 
(15.6% vs. 6.4% in the study U312 in children), while in the adult study U305, the trend was the 
opposite in favour of edoxaban (3.5% vs. 3.9%). In addition, in sensitivity analyses, using the 
endpoint of symptomatic recurrent VTE as defined in the EINSTEIN-Jr study, edoxaban would have 
been declared inferior to SOC with statistical significance (HR: 2.34; 95% CI: 0.453 to 12.054) (see 
also assessment of Q11). Therefore, a potential lack of efficacy of edoxaban due to underexposure in 
children at the doses tested in study U312 is a real possibility. 
In addition, it is unknown whether the tablet and granule formulations are bioequivalent in patients 
younger than 12 years. There are inadequate PK/PD, efficacy, or safety data to support the use of the 
edoxaban 30 mg or 15 mg tablets in patients younger than 12 years of age. Therefore, establishing a 
paediatric posology is challenging and subject to significant uncertainty with the data available. 
Finally, there are several treatment options for paediatric VTE (i.e.: rivaroxaban, dabigatran, heparins 
and VKAs. Given the treatment options available for paediatric patients and the uncertainty that 
edoxaban offers at least an equivalent benefit to SOC in this patient population, the MAH does not 
consider that a recommendation for formulation development is warranted.
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 167/195
It is unfortunate that the paediatric PIP has failed in achieving the goal of establishing an appropriate 
effective and safe dose that provides a similar exposure as in adults. Given the uncertainties about the 
benefit-risk profile of edoxaban in the paediatric population and the difficulties in establishing an 
appropriate paediatric dose, the Rapporteur finally shares the MAH intention of not recommending the 
use of edoxaban in children.
Conclusion
Issue solved (no further information pursued).
Question 11. The applicant should also provide sensitivity analyses of Hokusai VTE 
pediatrics using as primary endpoints those used in EINSTEIN Junior with rivaroxaban 
(symptomatic recurrent VTE) [Male et al. Lancet Haematol. 2020;7:e18-e27] and DIVERSITY 
study with dabigatran (combined endpoint of complete thrombus resolution, absence of 
recurrent VTE and absence of death related to VTE) [Halton et al. Lancet Haematol. 
2021;322-e33] in order to put into context comparable paediatric studies that have used 
different endpoints and hypotheses.
Summary of the WSA’s response
The requested sensitivity analyses for edoxaban are provided in Table 8 and Table 9, with the 
corresponding results from the published studies.  
For the endpoint of symptomatic recurrent VTE as used in the EINSTEIN-Jr study, the comparison of 
edoxaban versus SOC was HR: 2.34; 95% CI: (0.453, 12.054) and for rivaroxaban versus SOC was 
HR: 0.40; 95% CI: (0.11, 1.41).
For the composite endpoint of complete thrombus resolution, absence of recurrent VTE, and absence of 
VTE-related death as used in the DIVERSITY study, the difference between SOC vs edoxaban was -
0.0115; 90% CI: (-0.1022, 0.0792) and the difference between SOC versus dabigatran was -0.04; 
90% CI: (-0.14 to 0.07).

Assessment of the WSA’s response
The applicant has provided the sensitivity analyses requested. For the endpoint of symptomatic 
recurrent VTE as used in the EINSTEIN-Jr study, the comparison of edoxaban versus SOC was HR 2.34 
(95% CI: 0.453 to 12.054) and for rivaroxaban versus SOC was HR: 0.40; 95% CI: (0.11, 1.41). 
Therefore, by using symptomatic VTE as primary endpoint, edoxaban would have been declared 
inferior to SOC with statistical significance. 
For the composite endpoint of complete thrombus resolution, absence of recurrent VTE, and absence of 
VTE-related death as used in the DIVERSITY study, the difference between SOC vs edoxaban was -
1.15%; 90% CI: (-10,22 to 7.92; non-inferiority margin of absolute differences of 20% was used; 
non-inferiority P = 0.00031) and the difference between SOC versus dabigatran was -4% (90% CI: 
-14% to 0). Therefore, using the primary endpoint of the DIVERSITY study, edoxaban would have 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023

been declared non-inferior to SOC in HOKUSAI-VTE paediatrics study, while dabigatran was declared 
non-inferior to SOC, and almost superior to SOC with borderline statistical significance to SOC in the 
DIVERSITY study, as the upper 90%CI for the absolute difference in the primary endpoint was 0.
These sensitivity analyses highlight the heterogeneity in conclusions about benefit-risk that are 
apparent depending on the efficacy endpoint used in children. In general, the efficacy of edoxaban vs 
SOC in study U312 in children using different primary endpoints seems lower than that achieved by 
rivaroxaban in the EINSTEIN-Jr study and by dabigatran in the DIVERSITY study. In fact, edoxaban 
would have been declared inferior to SOC using the primary endpoint of symptomatic VTE as defined in 
the EINSTEIN-JR study 
Conclusion

Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

Question 12. In the phase III U312 study (Hokusai VTE paediatrics) a significant number of 
index events (46 events) were not confirmed, but were included in the main analysis. These 
patients should have been excluded from the mITT and PP populations and the main 
analysis, and only included in sensitivity analyses. In this respect: 
a) Please, provide efficacy analyses including only confirmed cases of VTE at baseline 
(240: 129 in the edoxaban group and 111 in the SOC group). 
b) An explanation why there are two-fold more unconfirmed cases of the index VTE in 
the SOC group (n= 30) than in the edoxaban group (n=16) would be welcomed. 
c) The description of VTE location of index events is rather scarce (VTE is only 
differentiated into DVT or PE). Please, describe locations of index DVTs (i.e.: lower 
limbs, upper limbs, catheter-associated DVT, cerebral venous thrombosis, etc). 
d) Please provide subgroup analyses of recurrent VTE according to location of index 
DVT/PE.
Summary of the WSA’s response
The MAH would like to clarify that in-line with the Study DU176b-D-U312 Study Protocol (Version 4.0) 
and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP; Version 3.0), the primary efficacy analysis was based on the mITT 
Analysis Set, which included all subjects in the Randomised Analysis Set who received at least 1 dose 
of randomised study drug.  The mITT Analysis Set comprised 286 subjects (edoxaban 145 subjects and 
SOC 141 subjects).  
A Per Protocol analysis was prespecified as a sensitivity analysis in the SAP.  The Per Protocol Analysis 
Set was defined as all subjects in the mITT Analysis Set who were sufficiently compliant with the 
protocol (ie, without major protocol deviations).  Per the SAP, major deviations from the protocol 
included: taking the incorrect treatment during the entire study period, not satisfying the eligibility 
criteria, index VTE not confirmed by the CEC, delayed SAE reporting or informed consent etc.  Full 
details of the major protocol deviations were documented in the protocol deviations plan version 9.0, 
dated 06 May 2022.  
In total, 47 subjects in the mITT Analysis Set were excluded from the Per Protocol Analysis Set, which 
comprised 239 subjects (edoxaban 129 and SOC 110).  Subjects whose index events were not 
confirmed by CEC adjudication were excluded from the Per Protocol Analysis Set.  The results for the 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 170/195
Per Protocol Analysis Set were provided in the U312 CSR and were consistent with the results for the 
mITT Analysis Set (see DU176b-D-U312 CSR Table 14.2.1.2).
a) Efficacy Analyses Including Only Confirmed Cases of VTE at Baseline 
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH has provided an analysis excluding the subjects whose index 
events were not confirmed by CEC adjudicators (edoxaban 129 subjects versus SOC 111 subjects).  
During the Main Treatment Period, the frequency of subjects meeting the composite primary endpoint 
was 19 (14.7%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 19 (17.1%) subjects in the SOC group.  The HR 
of the composite primary efficacy endpoint was 0.95; 95% CI: (0.500, 1.818).  The upper bound of 
the 95% CI was 1.818, which was above the prespecified NI margin of 1.5.  
The frequency of CEC adjudication-confirmed symptomatic recurrent VTE was 5 (3.9%) subjects in the 
edoxaban group and 2 (1.8%) subjects in the SOC group (Table 10).

b) Reasons for Unconfirmed Cases of the Index VTE 
Study U312 was an event-driven Phase 3, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint 
evaluation (PROBE), parallel-group study in subjects with confirmed VTE. The independent adjudication 
CEC was blinded to study treatment for event adjudication. The distribution of investigator-reported 
VTE events as unconfirmed events by the CEC (30 cases in the SOC group and 16 cases in the 
edoxaban group) is likely a chance finding.
c) Location of Index DVT 
The requested summary is provided in Table 11.  The distribution of locations of index VTE was similar 
across the treatment groups in Study U312.  
Index DVTs were most commonly located in the lower extremities.  Overall, 43.2% of subjects with 
DVT (54/125 subjects; 50 with DVT only, and 4 with DVT and PE) in the edoxaban group and 38.8% of 
subjects with DVT (47/121 subjects; 44 with DVT only, and 3 with DVT and PE) in the SOC group had 
DVT located in the lower extremities.  The next most common locations were cerebral venous sinus 
thrombosis reported for 21.6% of subjects with DVT (27/125 subjects; all with DVT only) in the 
edoxaban group and 17.4% of subjects with DVT (21/121 subjects; all with DVT only) in the SOC 
group, and upper extremities for 18.4% of subjects with DVT (23/125 subjects; 22 with DVT only, and 
1 with DVT and PE) in the edoxaban group and 20.7% of subjects with DVT (25/121 subjects; 24 with 
DVT only, and 1 with DVT and PE) in the SOC group.

Assessment of the WSA’s response
The MAH has provided an analysis excluding the subjects whose index events were not confirmed by 
CEC adjudicators (i.e.: including edoxaban 129 subjects versus SOC 111 subjects). During the Main 
Treatment Period, the frequency of subjects meeting the composite primary endpoint was 19 (14.7%) 
subjects in the edoxaban group and 19 (17.1%) subjects in the SOC group. The HR of the composite 
primary efficacy endpoint was 0.95; 95% CI: (0.500, 1.818). The upper bound of the 95% CI was 
1.818, which was above the prespecified NI margin of 1.5. Therefore, the analysis excluding patients 
with an index event not confirmed by CEC adjudicators yielded very similar results to those included in 
the main analysis. The frequency of CEC adjudication-confirmed symptomatic recurrent VTE was 5 
(3.9%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 2 (1.8%) subjects in the SOC group. On the other hand, 
the applicant states that the imbalance between groups in the distribution of investigator-reported VTE 
events as unconfirmed events by the CEC (30 cases in the SOC group and 16 cases in the edoxaban 
group) is likely a chance finding. 
The MAH has clarified that the type of index event was DVT with or without PE in 125 (86.2%) of 145 
children of the edoxaban group and 121 (85.8%) of 141 children in the SIC group, while the remaining 
cases, 20 (13.8%) in the edoxaban group and 20 (14.2%) in the SOC group were PE without DVT. 
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 173/195
DVTs were most frequently localized in the lower extremities (50 and 44 cases in the edoxaban and 
SOC groups, respectively), upper extremities (22 vs 24), and cerebral venous sinus (27 vs. 21). The 
number of catheter-related thrombosis as index VTE event was low in the edoxaban and SOC groups 
(8 vs. 9).  A summary of adjudication-confirmed VTE by location of index event and DVT characteristics 
(catheter and not catheter-related) has been provided, but due to the low number of subjects with 
events, it is not possible to draw any conclusions.
Conclusion
Issue solved.
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance 
Question 13. There are two patients that developed symptomatic recurrent DVT while on 
edoxaban (case 1 iliac DVT, case 2CVC DVT) that are not mentioned in the table 4.8 of the 
Summary of Clinical Pharmacology in relationship with edoxaban levels. The applicant 
should provide PK data and discussions about these two cases if edoxaban levels were 
available.
 Summary of the WSA’s response
Among the 145 subjects in the edoxaban group of Study U312, PK samples were collected from 
69 subjects (per the protocol, samples were not required to be collected from all subjects).  
Unfortunately, PK samples were not collected from Case 1 or Case 2 (Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-D-U312 
CSR Listing 16.2.2.3).  Based on their age (17 years), body weight (54.7 kg and 55.9 kg, 
respectively), and normal renal function, both subjects received the 45 mg QD dose when they 
developed DVT.

Question 14. In study U312, 21 of 26 primary efficacy events in the edoxaban group and 29 
of the 31 events in the SOC group corresponded to “no change or extension of thrombotic 
burden”.

a) The applicant is invited to clarify how many of these events in each group required 
additional treatment (i.e.: a course of parenteral anticoagulation if the children were 
on oral anticoagulation, or an increase in the intensity of parenteral anticoagulation 
if the children were already on parenteral anticoagulation).
b) The applicant should also provide PK data (i.e.: edoxaban levels) in all primary 
efficacy events (not only for the symptomatic ones), and to discuss about a potential 
relationship between edoxaban levels and cases of “no change or extension of 
thrombotic burden”.
Summary of the WSA’s response
a) Events Requiring Additional Treatment 
The subjects with no change or extension of thrombotic burden during the Main Treatment Period are 
listed in Table 13 together with details of anticoagulant use.  One subject  started additional 
anticoagulation before the primary efficacy outcome assessment in the edoxaban group.  In the SOC 
group, 3 subjects started additional anticoagulation before the primary efficacy outcome assessment 
and 1 subject started additional anticoagulation on the same day as the primary efficacy outcome 
assessment.

b) Edoxaban Levels in Subjects with Primary Efficacy Events
Plasma edoxaban levels are not available for all subjects in Study U312 (the PK Analysis Set included 
69 subjects of the 145 subjects treated with edoxaban).  As noted by the Assessors, the majority of 
subjects with an efficacy outcome had no change or extension of thrombotic burden.  Among the 26 
subjects with primary efficacy events in the edoxaban group, PK samples were collected from 14 
subjects (2 subjects with symptomatic recurrent VTE, 1 death where VTE could not be ruled out and 11 
subjects with no change or extension of thrombotic burden).  
The PopPK model-estimated steady-state AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough of the 14 subjects with PK data are 
summarised in Figure 6 and Table 14.  The median and average exposures of edoxaban of the 
14 subjects were slightly higher than that of subjects enrolled in Study U312 and comparable to that of 
subjects enrolled in Study U313.  No relationship between edoxaban levels and primary efficacy events 
was observed.

Assessment of the WSA’s response
The MAH has provided the data requested. One subject (Case 13) of 21 children (4.8%) with “no 
change or extension of thrombotic burden” in the edoxaban group started additional anticoagulation 
before the primary efficacy outcome assessment. In the SOC group, 3 of 29 children (10.3%) with “no 
change or extension of thrombotic burden” started additional anticoagulation before the primary 
efficacy outcome assessment and 1 additional subject in the SOC started additional anticoagulation on 
the same day as the primary efficacy outcome assessment. 
On the other hand, Among the 26 subjects with primary efficacy events in the edoxaban group, PK 
samples were collected from 14 subjects (2 subjects with symptomatic recurrent VTE, 1 death where 
VTE could not be ruled out and 11 subjects with no change or extension of thrombotic burden). The 
median and average exposures of edoxaban of the 14 subjects were slightly higher than that of 
subjects enrolled in Study U312 and comparable to that of subjects enrolled in Study U313.  No

Conclusion
Issue solved.
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance 
Question 15. The U312 study population is poorly characterized for essential clinical data in 
relationship with main efficacy and safety endpoint results, like efficacy/safety by age 
ranges (e.g.: 12 to < 18 years; 6 to < 12 years; 2 to < 6 years; and < 2 years), type of index 
VTE (e.g.: DVT related to central venous catheter, cerebral venous sinus, lower limbs, PE) 
and type of risk factors (persistent, transient or both, cancer yes/no, CVC yes/no). In 
addition, the presence of cancer and chemotherapy with asparaginase are major 
prothrombotic risk factors that coud result in different VTE rates and/or treatment effects. 
In this respect:
a) The applicant is requested to clarify how many patients were recruited into the U312 
study with cancer and/or asparaginase chemotherapy by treatment group and to 
analyse any potential imbalances between treatments. 
b) All these subpopulations mentioned in the heading should be further analyzed in 
subgroups for efficacy and safety. In particular, recurrent VTE events and 
major/CRNMB should be described in these importants subgroups and summarized 
in tables, despite it is acknowledged that the number of events in subgroups will be 
low. 
Summary of the WSA’s response
a. Subjects in Study U312 with Cancer and/or Asparaginase Chemotherapy
Table 15 summarises the numbers of subjects with each medical history reported in the neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified system organ class.  A medical history in the neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified system organ class was reported for 19.3% of subjects (28/145 subjects) in 
the edoxaban group and 22.0% of subjects (31/141 subjects) in the SOC group.  Similar proportions of 
subjects had a history of cancer in the edoxaban and SOC groups of Study U312.
The subjects who received either prior or concomitant treatments in the ATC class Other antineoplastic 
agents are listed in Table 16.
Overall, 6.9% of subjects in the edoxaban group (10/145 subjects) had received asparaginase (or 
pegaspargase/crisantaspase), whereas 3.5% of subjects in the SOC group (5/141 subjects) had 
received asparaginase (or pegaspargase). 
Table 17 summarises the number of subjects receiving asparaginase, pegaspargase, or crisantaspase 
by prior and concomitant use during the study.

Assessment of the WSA’s response
Approximately 19.3% of children in the edoxaban group and 22% in the SOC group had a medical 
history  of neoplasms. Overall, 6.9% of subjects in the edoxaban group and 3.5% of subjects in the 
SOC group had received asparaginase (or pegaspargase). Results for the requested subgroups have 
been summarised in Table 16 (documented symptomatic recurrent VTE) and in Table 17 (major and 
CRNM bleeding). Some HRs in Table 16 seem to be inconsistent with events rates used, but these 
calculations are not relevant for the application. Due to the low number of subjects with events, it is 
not possible to draw any conclusions for either symptomatic recurrent VTE or major or CRNM bleeding 
events across the subgroups. Therefore, the issue is no further pursued.
Conclusion
Issue solved
Question 16. The net clinical benefit analysis (Table 3.16 of the summary of clinical efficacy) 
disfavoured edoxaban in study U312, but looking at the VTE events, major bleeding and 
CRNM bleeding events described in other sections, numbers were numerically lower in the 
edoxaban group versus SOC. Please, explain this apparent discrepancy. 
Summary of the WSA’s response
The noted discrepancies are due to the different periods considered most appropriate for the various 
endpoints.  

The primary efficacy events were summarised for the Main Treatment Period (defined as 
from randomisation to the Month 3 visit + 3 days).  
 Major and CRNM bleeding was summarised for the Main Treatment Period and on-
treatment, where on-treatment was defined as on study drug, within 3 days of study drug 
interruption, discontinuation and last dose of study drug.

The net clinical outcome analysis considers the Overall Treatment Period (from 
randomisation to the date of the last dose of study drug + 30 days) and therefore includes 
the primary efficacy events that occurred during the extension period, during periods of 
drug interruptions of more than 3 days, or during the additional 27 days after the last dose 
of study treatment compared with the analyses of the primary efficacy and safety events.  
The major driver for the different results between the net clinical outcome and the primary safety and 
efficacy endpoints was an additional 5 subjects in the edoxaban group with major or CRNM bleeding 
that occurred during the extension period, and 2 subjects in the edoxaban group with major or CRNM 
bleeding that occurred while the subjects were not on-treatment (Table 20).

Assessment of the WSA’s response
The MAH has clarified that the noted discrepancies are due to the different periods considered most 
appropriate for the various endpoints. The major driver for the different results between the net clinical 
outcome and the primary safety and efficacy endpoints was an additional 5 subjects in the edoxaban 
group with major or CRNM bleeding that occurred during the extension period, and 2 subjects in the 
edoxaban group with major or CRNM bleeding that occurred while the subjects were not on-treatment 
(see also assessment of Q18).  
Conclusion
Issue solved.

Question 17. In study U313 the results seem worse for patients who switched from SOC to 
edoxaban (i.e.: SOC-edoxaban arm) than for those who continued with edoxaban since the 
start of the study (i.e.: edoxaban-edoxaban arm). Please discuss whether switching from 
edoxaban to SOC could be inappropriate for patients well controlled on SOC. 
Summary of the WSA’s response
The design of the Study U313 protocol was randomisation for the main period to either edoxaban or 
SOC.  All subjects who entered the extension period were given edoxaban for the duration of the 
extension period (Protocol Version 3.0).  Subjects who enrolled in the protocol earlier than Version 3.0 
and continued to the extension period with SOC anticoagulants were given edoxaban once the site 
approved Protocol Version 3.0.  The intent of the extension period was to gather additional safety data 
on edoxaban (Study U313 CSR Section 6.1.2).  
For the efficacy endpoints during the Main Treatment Period, 1 (1.7%) subject in the SOC treatment 
group experienced 2 TE (annualised rate of 0.07).  These events were a DVT with a PE.  During the 
extension period + 30-day follow-up, 5 subjects experienced TEs; 2 subjects experienced an 
adjudication-confirmed stroke, 2 subjects experienced an MI, and 1 subject experienced intracardiac 
thrombus (Table 21).  The events were a DVT with a PE.  
The annualised rate of TE in the extension period of Study U313 was 0.06 events per year (including 1 
subject who had not switched from SOC to edoxaban), which was similar to that reported for SOC 
during the Main Treatment Period (0.07 events per year).  Therefore, the MAH considers that there is 
no evidence to suggest that switching from SOC to edoxaban would be inappropriate.

Annualised rate = number of subjects with event/total time at risk (years).  Total time at risk is the sum, across 
subjects, of the number of “at risk” years.  For each subject, the “at risk” years = (the event or censoring – date 
of randomisation + 1)/365.25.  If a subject has multiple events, the time of the first event is used.
The 95% CI for rate difference was calculated by using Wald’s method.  Details are described in the SAP 
Addendum (27 Jul 2020).
The extension period is defined as from the day after the Month 3 Visit to the date of the last dose of study drug.
Source: Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Table 14.2.1.1, Table 14.2.1.2.
Details of the 5 subjects developing TE events during the extension period +30 days follow-up are 
presented in the detailed narrative in Module 5.3.5.1 DU176b-C-U313 CSR Section 14.3.3.
It should be noted that all subjects who developed the events in the Extension Period developed due to 
the progression of their underlying medical conditions transitioning from SOC to edoxaban and can be 
explained by the following:



Development of MI in patients with Kawasaki’s disease, a known complication irrespective of the 
anticoagulant therapy 
Subjects with congenital tricuspid valve atresia, transposition of the great vessels, Fontan 
surgery, and basal ganglia infarction, subject developing cerebellar infarction (acute infarction of 
the left cerebellar hemisphere and right inferior occipital lobe, and vermis) 
Subject with Fontan surgery, pulmonary atresia with intact septum, partial cavopulmonary 
bypass, intraventricular right thrombus, cerebral thrombosis, embolic stroke, and total 
cavopulmonary bypass developing severe right atria thrombosis.
Due to the rarity of the TE phenomenon in this patient population, TE episodes during the extension 
period were rare.  This study was unique as a substantial portion of the cohort were at risk for arterial 
thrombosis within GCA.  These GCA’s are themselves relatively rare in the Kawasaki disease population 
(4 to 8%) treated during the acute episodes with intravenous gamma globulin.  The development of 
intimal hyperplasia primarily at the proximal and distal ends of the GCA exacerbates abnormal fluid 
haemodynamics, which promotes clotting.  Thus, patients with GCA carry the highest risk classification 
for the development of coronary artery thrombosis and myocardial ischaemia and or infarction.  In this 
study, 2 subjects with GCA at very high risk developed treatment emergent TE episodes both with MI 
during the extension period.  There was no comparative SOC group.  However, an observational study 
showed that the cumulative incidence of coronary artery thrombosis with LMWH was 5.7 ± 3.0%, with 
warfarin 6.7 ± 3.7%, and with no anticoagulation 20.6 ± 3.0% (P < 0.001) at 2.5 years after the start 
of thromboprophylaxis.0  Thus, the incidence of coronary artery thrombosis in subjects with GCA in the 
extension period falls within these parameters.  
The Study U313 trial results should be considered with respect to study limitations.  Due to the rarity 
of heart disease in children compared to adult populations, the study was not adequately powered for 
any efficacy assessment.  For the same reason, the study cohort was heterogenous and subjects with 
varying types of heart disease were included.  Although enrolment was stratified for specific diagnoses 
to maintain similarity between treatment groups in the main period, subgroups were too small for 
reliable independent analyses.  Furthermore, thrombosis risk varies substantially among these 
subgroups.
Overall, Study U313 showed high tolerability in children without major bleeding and showed rare 
occurrence of thrombosis in patients on warfarin-maintained INR within therapeutic range only 40% of 
the time, similar to findings in other studies.  Of note, all reported events were unrelated to the study 
medication but were attributed to progression of the underlying medical condition.  Switching from

SOC treatment to edoxaban in the extension period did not result in any increased reporting of the TE 
events.

Assessment of the WSA’s response
The MAH has provided brief narratives of the 5 subjects developing TE events during the extension 
period +30 days follow-up in study U313. All reported events were unrelated to the study medication 
but were attributed to progression of the underlying medical condition. Therefore, it is unlikely that 
switching from SOC treatment to edoxaban in the extension period is the fundamental cause of the 
increased reporting in TE events.
Conclusion
Issue solved.
SAFETY
Question 18. In Study U312, a total of 3 (2.1%) subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 
(3.5%) subjects in the SOC group experienced at least 1 adjudication confirmed major and 
CRNM bleeding event during the Main Treatment Period and On-treatment (HR: 0.60, 95% 
CI: 0.139, 2.597). On the contrary, during the Overall Treatment Period, 10 (6.9%) subjects 
in the edoxaban group and 5 (3.5%) subjects in the SOC group experienced at least 1 
adjudication confirmed major/CRNM bleeding event (HR: 1.85, 95% CI: 0.637, 5.370), 
which means that during follow-up there were 7 major/CRNM bleedings in the edoxaban 
group and none in the SOC group. Please discuss whether the risk of bleeding with 
edoxaban could be time-varying and try to identify any other cause that could explain this 
finding.
Summary of the WSA’s response
The results of the safety analysis for Study U312 revealed that during the Main Treatment Period (from 
randomisation to Month 3 visit + 3 days) and On-treatment, at least 1 adjudication-confirmed major 
and CRNM bleeding event occurred in 3 subjects in the edoxaban group and in 5 subjects in the SOC 
group. Meanwhile, there were 10 subjects in the edoxaban group and 5 subjects in the SOC group who 
experienced at least 1 adjudication-confirmed major/CRNM bleeding event during the Overall 
Treatment Period (from randomisation to the date of the last dose of study drug + 30 days, which 
therefore includes the extension period, periods of drug interruptions of more than 3 days, and the 
additional 27 days after the last dose of study drug).
With increasing duration, over the study period, a higher incidence of bleeding events was observed 
with edoxaban than with SOC. However, compliance data indicated that compliance with edoxaban 
dosing was higher than with SOC. For the edoxaban group, 92.4% of subjects had 80% to 120% 
treatment compliance during the Overall Treatment Period (Table 14.1.4.1). For the 38 subjects who 
received treatment with warfarin, a mean percent time of 44.5% was within the INR therapeutic range 
of 2.0 to 3.0, approximately 46% was within the INR ranges of >2.0, and approximately 9% had an 
INR range >3.0 (Table 14.1.4.3). For the 52 subjects who received treatment with enoxaparin, the 
mean percent times with anti-FXa levels of <0.5, 0.5 to 1.0, and >1.0 were 24.98%, 59.48%, and 
15.54%, respectively (Table 14.1.4.4).

Figure 1 shows the rate of major and CRNM bleeding events over the course of the study days for 
edoxaban and SOC treatments. During periods of edoxaban interruption or after discontinuation by the
investigator for TE events, subjects were prescribed other anticoagulants (ie, LMWH or unfractionated 
heparin). Thus, safety endpoints were assessed using the On-treatment Period to allow an assessment 
of the relationship of the event to edoxaban.
Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier Plot for Time to First Event of Major and CRNM Bleeding Event – 
Overall Treatment Period
The Overall Treatment Period covers the period from randomisation to the date of the last dose of 
study drug (Main Treatment Period and Extension Period) plus 30 days (Follow-up).
Review of the patient profiles and of the details of the bleeding events allows allocation of the 
occurrence of major/CRNM bleeding events by period. Most of the identified bleeding events were 
assessed as not related to edoxaban.


In the edoxaban group, during the Main Treatment Period, a total of 5 major/CRNM bleeding 
events occurred in 3 subjects. During the Extension Period (treatment from the end of the Main 
Treatment Period in Month 3 up through the end of Month 12), a total of 6 major/CRNM 
bleeding events occurred in 6 subjects during the edoxaban treatment. In the Follow-up 
period, 2 major/CRNM bleeding events occurred in 2 subjects (approximately 100 days after 
the last dose of edoxaban). One subject   had major/CRNM bleeding events in the Main 
Treatment Period and in the Extension Period.
In the SOC group, 5 major/CRNM bleeding events occurred in 5 subjects during the Main 
Treatment Period. No major/CRNM bleeding events occurred in the Extension Period or Follow-
up period in the SOC group.
The number of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set completing the study (Treatment Period plus 30-day 
Follow-up or Main Treatment Period and Extension Period plus 30-day Follow-up) was higher in the 
edoxaban group: 131 subjects (90.3%) compared with 119 subjects (84.4%) in the SOC group. The 
same was true for the number of subjects completing the 3-month Main Study Period, the Extension 
Period, and the 30-day Follow-up: 77 subjects (53.1%) in the edoxaban group compared with 64 
subjects (45.4%) in the SOC group.
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 191/195
Thus, in the edoxaban group, more subjects were included in the Overall Treatment Period. As shown 
in Figure 1, at each time point from Study Day 100, more subjects were treated with edoxaban than 
with SOC. This may be a reason for more major/CRNM bleeding events with edoxaban in the Overall 
Treatment Period.
Analysis of the subjects’ profile data (eg, medical history and concomitant medications) did not reveal 
any abnormalities or patterns that could explain the increased major/CRNM bleeding events with 
edoxaban that occurred after the Main Treatment Period. Although as was reported in the U312 CSR, 
subjects in the edoxaban group were sicker subjects than those in the SOC group (history of 
metastatic malignancy or underlying medical conditions predisposing them to an increased risk of 
developing TE events). The higher level of compliance with edoxaban compared with SOC may also 
have contributed to the higher number of major/CRNM bleeding on edoxaban.
During the Main Treatment Period, a change of study drug dosing (study drug interrupted or 
discontinuation of the drug) was required for 4 of the 5 major/CRNM bleeding events in the SOC
group. In the edoxaban group, only one (tracheal bleeding, assessed as not related) of the 5 
major/CRNM bleeding events during the Main Treatment Period required a change of study drug dosing 
(study drug interrupted). Amongst the additional major/CRNM bleeding events in the edoxaban group 
after the Main Treatment Period and during Extension Period or Follow-up, only 2 of the total 8 
major/CRNM bleeding events required interruption of the study drug. The drug interruptions due to 
these events were brief, and in both cases, edoxaban was resumed after the events subsided. Of note, 
the 2 affected subjects were taking concomitant medications that may have contributed to an 
increased risk of bleeding (Clexane [enoxaparin sodium] and acetylsalicylic acid).
Although major/CRNM bleeding events were slightly lower in the edoxaban group compared with the 
SOC group in the Main Treatment Period of Study U312 (3 vs 5 events, respectively), major/CRNM 
bleeding events occurred more frequently with edoxaban compared with SOC in the Extension Period 
(6 vs 0 [1 of these subjects had also experienced a CRNMB in the Treatment Period]. Two subjects had 
major CRNMB in the follow-up period. However, the type and location of the major/CRNM bleeding 
events varied, and these events were not considered severe enough to warrant discontinuation of 
study medication. A time-varying risk of bleeding with edoxaban could not be confirmed based on the 
data presented. This is in line with data from other studies, such as ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 with a mean 
study drug exposure of 806 days in the edoxaban 60 mg group or post-authorisation safety study 
ETNA-AF Europe, with a median treatment duration of 97.5 weeks during the 48-month follow-up 
period. There was no indication of an increased bleeding risk with longer duration of edoxaban 
treatment.
Assessment of the WSA’s response
Major/CRNM bleeding events were slightly lower in the edoxaban group compared with the SOC group 
in the Main Treatment Period of Study U312 (3 vs 5 events, respectively), but major/CRNM bleeding 
events occurred more frequently with edoxaban compared with SOC in the Extension Period (6 vs 0 [1 
of these subjects had also experienced a CRNMB in the Treatment Period]. However, the type and 
location of the major/CRNM bleeding events varied, and these events were not considered severe 
enough to warrant discontinuation of study medication, which is reassuring. 
A potential explanation of the higher number of bleedings with edoxaban during the extension period is 
that treatment compliance was higher with edoxaban and also more patients completed the extension 
phase in the edoxaban group [77 subjects (53.1%) in the edoxaban group compared with 64 subjects 
(45.4%) in the SOC group]. Thus, in the edoxaban group, more subjects were included in the Overall 
Treatment Period. This may be a reason for more major/CRNM bleeding events with edoxaban in the 
Overall Treatment Period.
A time-varying risk of bleeding with edoxaban could not be confirmed based on the data presented. 
This is in line with data from other studies, such as ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 with a mean study drug 
exposure of 806 days in the edoxaban 60 mg group or post-authorisation safety study ETNA-AF

was no indication of an increased bleeding risk with longer duration of edoxaban treatment.

Question 19. There were two children with Kawasaki disease in the U313 study that 
developed MI considered related to study medication by the investigator (one subject: 
warfarin 3 mg switched to edoxaban 45 mg during extension treatment; one ubject: SOC 31 
mg, active ingredient not defined, followed by edoxaban dose, not recorded in the 
narrative). The events are poorly documented with respect to study medications, doses and 
narratives. Please provide narratives including study medications and doses given at the 
start of the trial and former medications the patients were taken at the onset of the MI. An 
assessment by the Sponsor about causality relationship should also be tempted including a 
discussion about a potential relationship between edoxaban and MI from adult and 
paediatric studies.
Summary of the WSA’s response
Overall Discussion:
Due to the rarity of the TE phenomenon in this patient population, TE episodes during the extension 
period were rare. This study was unique as a substantial portion of the cohort were at risk for arterial 
thrombosis within giant coronary aneurysms (GCAs). These GCAs are themselves relatively rare in the 
Kawasaki disease (4% to 8%) population treated during the acute episodes with intravenous gamma 
globulin. Development of intimal hyperplasia primarily at the proximal and distal ends of the GCA 
exacerbates abnormal fluid haemodynamics, which promotes clotting. Thus, patients with GCA carry 
the highest risk classification for development of coronary artery thrombosis and myocardial ischemia 
and or infarction. In this study, two GCA patients at very high risk developed treatment-emergent TE 
episodes both with MI during the extension study.
There was no comparative SOC group. However, an observational study showed that cumulative 
incidence of coronary artery thrombosis with LMWH was 5.7% ± 3.0%, with warfarin was 6.7% ± 
3.7%, and with no anticoagulation was 20.6 ± 3.0% (P < 0.001) at 2.5 years after the start of 
thromboprophylaxis (Manlhoit et al., 2020). Thus, incidence of coronary artery thrombosis in the GCA 
patients in the extension study falls within these parameters.
The paediatric study, Study DU176b-C-U313, was an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, 
observational study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of edoxaban as a prophylaxis treatment in 
children with cardiac diseases at risk of TE. The Study U313 paediatric study results should be 
considered with respect to study limitations. Due to the rarity of heart disease in children compared to 
adult populations, the study was not adequately powered for efficacy. For the same reasons, the study 
cohort was heterogenous and patients with varying types of heart disease were included. Although 
enrolment was stratified for specific diagnoses to maintain similarity between treatment groups in the 
main period, subgroups were too small for reliable independent analyses. Furthermore, thrombosis risk 
varies substantially among these subgroups.
The adult study, DU176b-C-U301 (Study U301) entitled “ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48,” was a Phase 3, 
randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational study for the 
evaluation of the efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin in subjects with atrial fibrillation 
effective anticoagulation with FXa next generation in atrial fibrillation. The primary objective was to 
compare edoxaban to warfarin with regard to the composite primary endpoint of stroke and SEE. A 
secondary objective was the comparison of edoxaban to warfarin with regard to MACE, a composite of 
non-fatal MI, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal SEE, and death due to cardiovascular cause or bleeding, as well 
as each component separately.
Myocardial Infarction
In the Study U301 mITT analysis set Overall Study Period, fewer subjects in the edoxaban 60 mg 
group experienced an MI than the warfarin group (0.70% per year and 0.75% per year, respectively), 
with a HR of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.741, 1.190). For the mITT Analysis Set On-Treatment Period, the HR for 
MI was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.635, 1.120) for the edoxaban 60 mg group compared with the warfarin group 
(Table 2).
Table 2: Key Components of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints in Study U301 (ENGAGE AF-
TIMI 48)
Assessment report 
EMA/564306/2023
Page 193/195
Overall, the median age for the study population in Study U301 was 72 years, and the average 
CHADS2 score was 2.8, with prior medical history of stroke, hypertension, congestive heart failure, 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, stroke, and hyperlipidaemia. The secondary efficacy endpoints demonstrated 
that subjects in the edoxaban 60 mg group had a reduced risk of experiencing the MACE events (HR 
0.89, 95% CI: 0.806, 0.972) compared with subjects in the warfarin group. The MI events in adults 
could be attributed to aggravating factors such as history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, stroke, ischaemic heart disease, coronary heart disease, and 
hyperlipidaemia. In children, MI is related to the cardiac conditions including genetic disorders or 
illness such as Kawasaki disease leading to coronary aneurysm or Fontan’s surgery.

The applicant has provided extensive narratives of two children with Kawasaki disease experiencing MI

This study was unique as a substantial portion of the cohort were at risk for arterial thrombosis within

Development of intimal hyperplasia primarily at the proximal and distal ends of the GCA exacerbates 
abnormal fluid haemodynamics, which promotes clotting. Thus, patients with GCA carry the highest 
risk classification for development of coronary artery thrombosis and myocardial ischemia and or 
infarction. The applicant states that the two patients with Kawasaki disease who experienced MI during 
the extension phase had concomitant GCA. Both patients were at very high risk developed treatment-
emergent TE episodes both with MI during the extension study. There was no comparative SOC group 
during the extension phase. However, an observational study showed that cumulative incidence of 
coronary artery thrombosis with LMWH was 5.7% ± 3.0%, with warfarin was 6.7% ± 3.7%, and with 
no anticoagulation was 20.6 ± 3.0% (P < 0.001) at 2.5 years after the start of thromboprophylaxis 
(Manlhoit, et al, 2020). Thus, incidence of coronary artery thrombosis in the GCA patients treated with 
edoxaban in the extension phase of study U313 falls within these parameters, and no signal of 
increased risk of MI with edoxaban is apparent in children.
The adult study, DU176b-C-U301 (Study U301) entitled “ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48,” (n=) included MACE 
events as secondary endpoints, and the subjects on the edoxaban 60 mg group had a reduced risk of 
experiencing the MACE events than those on the warfarin group (HR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.806, 0.972) 
compared with subjects in the warfarin group. Therefore, no signal of increased risk of MI with 
edoxaban is apparent also in adults.

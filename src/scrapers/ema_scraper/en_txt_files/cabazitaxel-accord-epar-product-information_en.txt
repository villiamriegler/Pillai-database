CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Cabazitaxel Accord in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer previously treated with a 
docetaxel-containing regimen (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The use of cabazitaxel should be confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxics and it 
should only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
chemotherapy. Facilities and equipment for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions like 
hypotension and bronchospasm must be available (see section 4.4). 
Premedication 
The recommended premedication regimen should be performed at least 30 minutes prior to each 
administration of cabazitaxel with the following intravenous medicinal products to mitigate the risk and 
severity of hypersensitivity: 
• 
• 
• 
antihistamine (dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg or diphenhydramine 25 mg or equivalent), 
corticosteroid (dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent), and 
H2 antagonist (ranitidine or equivalent) (see section 4.4). 
Antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended and can be given orally or intravenously as needed.  
Throughout the treatment, adequate hydration of the patient needs to be ensured, in order to prevent 
complications like renal failure. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of cabazitaxel is 25 mg/m2 administered as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 
3 weeks in combination with oral prednisone or prednisolone 10 mg administered daily throughout 
treatment. 
Dose adjustments 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose modifications should be made if patients experience the following adverse reactions (Grades refer 
to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE 4.0]): 
Table 1 - Recommended dose modifications for adverse reaction in patients treated with cabazitaxel 
Adverse reactions 
Dose modification 
Prolonged grade ≥3 neutropenia (longer than 
1 week) despite appropriate treatment including 
G-CSF 
Febrile neutropenia or neutropenic infection 
Grade ≥3 diarrhoea or persisting diarrhea despite 
appropriate treatment, including fluid and 
electrolytes replacement 
Grade >2 peripheral neuropathy 
Delay treatment until neutrophil count is 
>1,500 cells/mm3, then reduce cabazitaxel dose 
from 25 mg/m2 to 20 mg/m2. 
Delay treatment until improvement or resolution, 
and until neutrophil count is >1,500 cells/mm3, 
then reduce cabazitaxel dose from 25 mg/m2 to 
20 mg/m2. 
Delay treatment until improvement or resolution, 
then reduce cabazitaxel dose from 25 mg/m2 to 
20 mg/m2. 
Delay treatment until improvement, then reduce 
cabazitaxel dose from 25 mg/m2 to 20 mg/m2. 
If patients continue to experience any of these reactions at 20 mg/m2, further dose reduction to 
15 mg/m2 or discontinuation of cabazitaxel may be considered. Data in patients below the 20 mg/m2 
dose are limited. 
Concomitant medicinal products use 
Concomitant medicinal products that are strong inducers or strong inhibitors of CYP3A should be 
avoided. However, if patients require co-administration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, a 25% cabazitaxel 
dose reduction should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Cabazitaxel is extensively metabolised by the liver. Patients with mild hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) >1.5 x ULN), 
should have cabazitaxel dose reduced to 20 mg/m2. Administration of cabazitaxel to patients with mild 
hepatic impairment should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring of safety. 
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to ≤ 3.0 x ULN), the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was 15 mg/m2. If the treatment is envisaged in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment the dose of cabazitaxel should not exceed 15 mg/m2. However, limited efficacy data are 
available at this dose. 
Cabazitaxel Accord should not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 
> 3  x ULN) (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Patients with renal impairment 
Cabazitaxel is minimally excreted through the kidney. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with 
renal impairment, not requiring hemodialysis. Patients presenting end stage renal disease (creatinine 
clearance (CLCR< 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), by their condition and the limited amount of data available 
should be treated with caution and monitored carefully during treatment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Elderly 
No specific dose adjustment for the use of cabazitaxel in elderly patients is recommended (see also 
sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of cabazitaxel in the paediatric population. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety and the efficacy of cabazitaxel in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not 
been established (see section 5.1). 
Method of administration 
Cabazitaxel Accord is for intravenous use. 
For instructions on preparation and administration of the product, see section 6.6. 
PVC infusion containers and polyurethane infusion sets should not be used. 
Cabazitaxel must not be mixed with any other medicinal products than those mentioned in section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to cabazitaxel, to other taxanes, to polysorbate 80 or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
Neutrophil counts less than 1,500/mm3. 
Severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN). 
Concomitant vaccination with yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
All patients should be pre-medicated prior to the initiation of the infusion of cabazitaxel (see section 
4.2). 
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions especially during the first and second 
infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation of the 
infusion of cabazitaxel, thus facilities and equipment for the treatment of hypotension and 
bronchospasm should be available. Severe reactions can occur and may include generalized 
rash/erythema, hypotension and bronchospasm. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate 
discontinuation of cabazitaxel and appropriate therapy. Patients with a hypersensitivity reaction must 
stop treatment with cabazitaxel (see section 4.3). 
Bone marrow suppression 
Bone marrow suppression manifested as neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, or pancytopenia may 
occur (see “Risk of neutropenia” and “Anaemia” in section 4.4 below). 
Risk of neutropenia 
Patients treated with cabazitaxel may receive prophylactic G-CSF, as per American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) guidelines and/or current institutional guidelines, to reduce the risk or manage 
neutropenia complications (febrile neutropenia, prolonged neutropenia or neutropenic infection). 
Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features 
(age >65 years, poor performance status, previous episodes of febrile neutropenia, extensive prior 
radiation ports, poor nutritional status, or other serious comorbidities) that predispose them to increased 
complications from prolonged neutropenia. The use of G-CSF has been shown to limit the incidence 
and severity of neutropenia. 
Neutropenia is the most common adverse reaction of cabazitaxel (see section 4.8). Monitoring of 
complete blood counts is essential on a weekly basis during cycle 1 and before each treatment cycle 
thereafter so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed.  
The dose should be reduced in case of febrile neutropenia, or prolonged neutropenia despite appropriate 
treatment (see section 4.2). 
Patients should be re-treated only when neutrophils recover to a level ≥ 1,500/mm3 (see section 4.3). 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Symptoms such as abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, persistent constipation, diarrhoea, with or 
without neutropenia, may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be 
evaluated and treated promptly. Cabazitaxel treatment delay or discontinuation may be necessary. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration 
If patients experience diarrhoea following administration of cabazitaxel they may be treated with 
commonly used anti-diarrhoeal medicinal products. Appropriate measures should be taken to re-hydrate 
patients. Diarrhoea can occur more frequently in patients that have received prior abdomino-pelvic 
radiation. Dehydration is more common in patients aged 65 or older. Appropriate measures should be 
taken to rehydrate patients and to monitor and correct serum electrolyte levels, particularly potassium. 
Treatment delay or dose reduction may be necessary for grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea (see section 4.2). If 
patients experience nausea or vomiting, they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics. 
Risk of serious gastrointestinal reactions 
Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage and perforation, ileus, colitis, including fatal outcome, have been 
reported in patients treated with cabazitaxel (see section 4.8). Caution is advised with treatment of 
patients most at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications: those with neutropenia, the elderly, 
concomitant use of NSAIDs, anti-platelet therapy or anti-coagulants, and patients with a prior history of 
pelvic radiotherapy or gastrointestinal disease, such as ulceration and GI bleeding. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Cases of peripheral neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy (e.g., paraesthesias, dysaesthesias) and 
peripheral motor neuropathy have been observed in patients receiving cabazitaxel. Patients under 
treatment with cabazitaxel should be advised to inform their doctor prior to continuing treatment if 
symptoms of neuropathy such as pain, burning, tingling, numbness, or weakness develop. Physicians 
should assess for the presence or worsening of neuropathy before each treatment. Treatment should be 
delayed until improvement of symptoms. The dose of cabazitaxel should be reduced from 25 mg/m2 to 
20 mg/m2 for persistent grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy (see section 4.2). 
Anaemia 
Anaemia has been observed in patients receiving cabazitaxel (see section 4.8). Haemoglobin and 
haematocrit should be checked before treatment with cabazitaxel and if patients exhibit signs or 
symptoms of anaemia or blood loss. Caution is recommended in patients with haemoglobin <10 g/dl 
and appropriate measures should be taken as clinically indicated. 
Risk of renal failure 
Renal disorders, have been reported in association with sepsis, severe dehydration due to diarrhoea, 
vomiting and obstructive uropathy. Renal failure including cases with fatal outcome has been observed. 
Appropriate measures should be taken to identify the cause and intensively treat the patients if this 
occurs. 
Adequate hydration should be ensured throughout treatment with cabazitaxel. The patient should be 
advised to report any significant change in daily urinary volume immediately. Serum creatinine should 
be measured at baseline, with each blood count and whenever the patient reports a change in urinary 
output. Cabazitaxel treatment should be discontinued in case of any degradation of renal function to 
renal failure ≥ CTCAE 4.0 Grade 3. 
Respiratory disorders 
Interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease have been reported and may be 
associated with fatal outcome (see section 4.8). 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop, patients should be closely monitored, promptly 
investigated, and appropriately treated. Interruption of cabazitaxel therapy is recommended until 
diagnosis is available. Early use of supportive care measures may help improve the condition. The 
benefit of resuming cabazitaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated. 
Risk of cardiac arrhythmias 
Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported, most commonly tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (see section 
4.8). 
Elderly 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions 
including neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (see section 4.8). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with liver impairment 
Treatment with Cabazitaxel Accord is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin > 3 x ULN) (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). 
Dose should be reduced for patients with mild (total bilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 x ULN or AST >1.5 x ULN), 
hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Interactions 
Co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided since they may increase the plasma 
concentrations of cabazitaxel (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). If co-administration with a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor cannot be avoided, close monitoring for toxicity and a cabazitaxel dose reduction should be 
considered (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided since they may decrease plasma 
concentrations of cabazitaxel (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Excipients 
This medicine contains 1185 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each vial, which is equivalent to 395 mg/ml. 
The amount in each vial of this medicine is equivalent to 30 ml of beer or 12 ml of wine. 
The amount of alcohol in this medicine is not likely to have an effect in adults and adolescents, and its 
effects in children are not likely to be noticeable.  
It may have some effects in younger children, for example feeling sleepy. The alcohol in this medicine 
may alter the effects of other medicines. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other 
medicines. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine.  
If you are addicted to alcohol, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking this medicine. 
A dose of 60 mg of this medicinal product administered to an adult weighing 70 kg would result in an 
exposure to 17mg/kg of ethanol which may cause a rise in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of about 
2,8 mg/100 ml. For comparison, for an adult drinking a glass of wine or 500 ml of beer, the BAC is 
likely to be about 50 mg/100 ml. 
Contraception measure 
Men should use contraceptive measures during treatment and for 4 months after cessation of treatment 
with cabazitaxel (see section 4.6). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In vitro studies have shown that cabazitaxel is mainly metabolised through CYP3A (80% to 90%) (see 
section 5.2). 
CYP3A inhibitors 
Repeated administration of ketoconazole (400 mg once daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in a 
20% decrease in cabazitaxel clearance corresponding to a 25% increase in AUC. Therefore concomitant 
administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, 
nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) should be avoided as an 
increase of plasma concentrations of cabazitaxel may occur (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Concomitant administration of aprepitant, a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, had no effect on cabazitaxel 
clearance. 
CYP3A inducers 
Repeated administration of rifampin (600 mg once daily), a strong CYP3A inducer, resulted in an 
increase in cabazitaxel clearance of 21% corresponding to a decrease in AUC of 17%. 
Therefore concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital) should be avoided as a decrease of plasma concentrations 
of cabazitaxel may occur (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). In addition, patients should also refrain from taking 
St. John’s Wort. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OATP1B1 
In vitro, cabazitaxel has also been shown to inhibit the transport proteins of the Organic Anion 
Transport Polypeptides OATP1B1. The risk of interaction with OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. statins, 
valsartan, repaglinide) is possible, notably during the infusion duration (1 hour) and up to 20 minutes 
after the end of the infusion. A time interval of 12 hours is recommended before the infusion and at 
least 3 hours after the end of infusion before administering the OATP1B1 substrates. 
Vaccinations 
Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients immunocompromised by 
chemotherapeutic agents may result in serious or fatal infections. Vaccination with a live attenuated 
vaccine should be avoided in patients receiving cabazitaxel. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be 
administered; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Contraception measure 
Due to the genotoxic risk of cabazitaxel (see section 5.3), men should use effective method of 
contraception during treatment and for 4 months after cessation of treatment with cabazitaxel. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of cabazitaxel in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity at maternotoxic doses (see section 5.3) and that cabazitaxel crosses the placenta 
barrier (see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, cabazitaxel may cause foetal harm 
in exposed pregnant women. 
Cabazitaxel is not indicated for use in women. 
Breastfeeding 
Available pharmacokinetics data in animals have shown excretion of cabazitaxel and its metabolites in 
milk (see section 5.3).  
Fertility 
Animal studies showed that cabazitaxel affected reproductive system in male rats and dogs without any 
functional effect on fertility (see section 5.3). Nevertheless, considering the pharmacological activity of 
taxanes, their genotoxic potential by an aneugenic mechanism and effect of several compounds of this 
class on fertility in animal studies, effect on male fertility could not be excluded in human. 
Men being treated with cabazitaxel are advised to seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to 
treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cabazitaxel has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines as it may cause fatigue and 
dizziness. Patients should be advised not to drive or use machines if they experience these adverse 
reactions during treatment. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The safety of cabazitaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone was evaluated in 3 
randomized, open label, controlled studies (TROPIC, PROSELICA and CARD), totaling 1092 patients 
with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who were treated with 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel once 
every 3 weeks. Patients received a median of 6 to 7 cycles of cabazitaxel. 
The incidences from the pooled analysis of these 3 trials are presented below and in the tabulated list. 
The most common all grades adverse reactions  were anaemia (99.0%), leukopenia (93.0%), 
neutropenia (87.9%), thrombocytopenia (41.1%), diarrhoea (42.1%), fatigue (25.0%) and asthenia 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(15.4%).The most common grade ≥3 adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients were 
neutropenia (73.1%), leukopenia (59.5%), anaemia (12.0%), febrile neutropenia (8.0%) and diarrhoea 
(4.7%).  
Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred with similar frequencies across the 3 
studies (18.3% in TROPIC, 19.5% in PROSELICA and 19.8% in CARD) in patients receiving 
cabazitaxel. The most common adverse reactions (> 1.0%) leading to cabazitaxel discontinuation were 
hematuria, fatigue and neutropenia. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are listed in table 2 according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency 
categories. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness. Intensity of the adverse reactions is graded according to CTCAE 4.0 (grade ≥3 = G≥3). 
Frequencies are based on all grades and defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Neutropenia, and associated clinical events 
The use of G-CSF has been shown to limit the incidence and severity of neutropenia (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4). 
Incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia based on laboratory data varied depending on use of G-CSF from 
44.7% to 76.7%, with the lowest incidence reported when G-CSF prophylaxis was used. Similarly, the 
incidence of grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia ranged from 3.2% to 8.6%.  
Neutropenic complications (including febrile neutropenia, neutropenic infection/sepsis and neutropenic 
colitis) which in some cases resulted in a fatal outcome, were reported in 4.0% of the patients when 
primary G-CSF prophylaxis was used, and in 12.8% of the patients otherwise. 
Cardiac disorders and arrhythmias 
In the pooled analysis, cardiac events were reported in 5.5% of the patients of which 1.1% had grade ≥3 
cardiac arrhythmias. The incidence of tachycardia on cabazitaxel was 1.0%, of which less than 0.1% 
were grade ≥3. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was 1.3%. Cardiac failure events were reported for 
2 patients (0.2%), one of which resulted in a fatal outcome. Fatal ventricular fibrillation was reported in 
1 patient (0.3%), and cardiac arrest in 3 patients (0.5%). None were considered related by the 
investigator.  
Haematuria 
In the pooled analysis, haematuria all grades frequency was 18.8% at 25 mg/m2 (see section 5.1). 
Confounding causes when documented, such as disease progression, instrumentation, infection or 
anticoagulation/NSAID/acetylsalicylic acid therapy were identified in nearly half of the cases. 
Other laboratory abnormalities 
In pooled analysis, the incidence of grade ≥3 anaemia, increased AST, ALT, and bilirubin based on 
laboratory abnormalities were 12.0%, 1.3%, 1.0%, and 0.5%, respectively. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Colitis (including enterocolitis and neutropenic enterocolitis),  and gastritis, have been observed. 
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, and ileus (intestinal obstruction) have also 
been reported (see section 4.4).

Respiratory disorders 
Cases of interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease, sometimes fatal have been 
reported with an unknown frequency (cannot be estimated from the available data) (see section 4.4). 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Cystitis due to radiation recall phenomenon, including haemorrhagic cystitis, were reported 
uncommonly. 
Paediatric population  
See section 4.2 
Other special populations 
Elderly 
Of the 1092 patients treated with cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 in the prostate cancer studies, 755 patients were 
65 years or over including 238 patients older than 75 years. The following non hematologic adverse 
reactions were reported at rates ≥5% higher in patients 65 years of age or greater compared to younger 
patients: fatigue (33.5% vs. 23.7%), asthenia (23.7 vs. 14.2%), constipation (20.4% vs. 14.2%) and 
dyspnoea (10.3% vs. 5.6%) respectively. Neutropenia (90.9% vs. 81.2%) and thrombocytopenia (48.8% 
vs. 36.1%) were also 5% higher in patients 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients. 
Grade ≥3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were reported with the highest difference rates between 
both groups of age (respectively 14% and 4% higher in patients ≥ 65 years old compared to patients < 
65 years old) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed 
in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no known antidote to cabazitaxel. The anticipated complications of overdose would consist of 
exacerbation of adverse reactions as bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal disorders. 
In case of overdose, the patient should be kept in a specialised unit and closely monitored. Patients 
should receive therapeutic G-CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose. Other appropriate 
symptomatic measures should be taken.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, taxanes, ATC code: L01CD04 
Mechanism of action 
Cabazitaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells. 
Cabazitaxel binds to tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into microtubules while 
simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly. This leads to the stabilisation of microtubules, which 
results in the inhibition of mitotic and interphase cellular functions. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cabazitaxel demonstrated a broad spectrum of antitumour activity against advanced human tumours 
xenografted in mice. Cabazitaxel is active in docetaxel-sensitive tumours. In addition, cabazitaxel 
demonstrated activity in tumour models insensitive to chemotherapy including docetaxel.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone were evaluated 
in a randomised, open-label, international, multi-center, phase III study (EFC6193 study), in patients 
with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel containing 
regimen. 
Overall survival (OS) was the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. 
Secondary endpoints included progression free survival [PFS (defined as time from randomization to 
tumour progression, prostatic specific antigen (PSA) progression, pain progression, or death due to any 
cause, whichever occurred first], tumour response rate based on response evaluation criteria in solid 
tumours (RECIST), PSA progression (defined as a ≥25% increase or >50% in PSA non-responders or 
responders respectively), PSA response (declines in serum PSA levels of at least 50%), pain 
progression [assessed using the present pain intensity (PPI) scale from the McGill-Melzack 
questionnaire and an analgesic score (AS)] and pain response (defined as 2-point greater reduction 
from baseline median PPI with no concomitant increase in AS, or reduction of ≥50% in analgesic use 
from baseline mean AS with no concomitant increase in pain). 
A total of 755 patients were randomised to receive either cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 intravenously every 
3 weeks for a maximum of 10 cycles with prednisone or prednisolone 10 mg orally daily (n=378), or to 
receive mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of 10 cycles with 
prednisone or prednisolone 10 mg orally daily (n=377). 
This study included patients over 18 years of age with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer 
either measurable by RECIST criteria or non-measurable disease with rising PSA levels or appearance 
of new lesions, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2. Patients 
had to have neutrophils >1,500/mm3, platelets >100,000/mm3, haemoglobin >10 g/dl, 
creatinine <1.5 x ULN, total bilirubin <1 x ULN, AST and ALT <1.5 x ULN. 
Patients with a history of congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within last 6 months, or 
patients with uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, and/or hypertension were not included 
in the study. 
Demographics, including age, race, and ECOG performance status (0 to 2), were balanced between the 
treatment arms. In the cabazitaxel group, the mean age was 68 years, range (46-92) and the racial 
distribution was 83.9% Caucasian, 6.9% Asian/Oriental, 5.3% Black and 4% Others. 
The median number of cycles was 6 in the cabazitaxel group and 4 in the mitoxantrone group. The 
number of patients who completed the study treatment (10 cycles) was respectively 29.4% and 13.5% in 
the cabazitaxel group and in the comparator group. 
Overall survival was significant longer with cabazitaxel compared to mitoxantrone (15.1 months versus 
12.7 respectively), with a 30% reduction in the risk of death compared to mitoxantrone (see table 3 and 
figure 1). 
A sub-group of 59 patients received prior cumulative dose of docetaxel <225 mg/m2 (29 patients in 
cabazitaxel arm, 30 patients in mitoxantrone arm). There was no significant difference in overall 
survival in this group of patients (HR (95%CI) 0.96 (0.49-1.86)).

There was an improvement in PFS in the cabazitaxel arm compared to mitoxantrone arm, 2.8 (2.4-3.0) 
months versus 1.4 (1.4-1.7) respectively, HR (95%CI) 0.74 (0.64-0.86), p<0.0001. 
There was a significant higher rate of tumour response of 14.4% (95%CI: 9.6-19.3) in patients in the 
cabazitaxel arm compared to 4.4% (95%CI: 1.6-7.2) for patients in the mitoxantrone arm, p=0.0005. 
PSA secondary endpoints were positive in the cabazitaxel arm. There was a median PSA progression of 
6.4 months (95%CI: 5.1-7.3) for patients in cabazitaxel arm, compared to 3.1 months (95%CI: 2.2-4.4) 
in the mitoxantrone arm, HR 0.75 months (95%CI: 0.63-0.90), p=0.0010. The PSA response was 39.2% 
in patients on cabazitaxel arm (95%CI: 33.9-44.5) versus 17.8% of patients on mitoxantrone (95%CI: 
13.7-22.0), p=0.0002. 
There was no statistical difference between both treatment arms in pain progression and pain response. 
In a non-inferiority, multicenter, multinational, randomised, open label phase III study (EFC11785 
study), 1200 patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, previously treated with a 
docetaxel-containing regimen, were randomized to receive either cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 (n=602) or 
20 mg/m2 (n=598) dose. Overall survival (OS) was the primary efficacy end-point. 
The study met its primary objective of demonstrating the non-inferiority of cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 in 
comparison with 25 mg/m2 (see table 4). A statistically significantly higher percentage (p<0.001) of 
patients showed a PSA response in the 25 mg/m2 group (42.9%) compared to the 20 mg/m2 group 
(29.5%). A statistically significantly higher risk of PSA progression in patients with the 20 mg/m2 dose 
with respect to the 25 mg/m2 dose was observed (HR 1.195 ; 95%CI: 1.025 to 1.393). There was no 
statistically difference with regards to the other secondary endpoints (PFS, tumour and pain response, 
tumour and pain progression, and four subcategories of FACT-P).

In a prospective, multinational, randomized, active-controlled and open-label phase IV study 
(LPS14201/CARD study) 255 patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), 
previously treated in any order with a docetaxel containing regimen and with an AR-targeted agent 
(abiraterone or enzalutamide, with disease progression within 12 months of treatment initiation), were 
randomized to receive either CABAZITAXEL 25 mg/m2 every 3 week plus prednisone/prednisolone 10 
mg daily (n=129) or AR-targeted agents (abiraterone 1000 mg once daily plus prednisone/prednisolone 
5 mg twice daily or enzalutamide 160 mg once daily) (n=126). Radiographic progression free-survival 
(rPFS) as defined by Prostate Cancer Working Group-2 (PCWG2) was the primary endpoint. Secondary 
endpoints included overall survival, progression-free survival, PSA response and tumour response. 
Demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. At baseline, the 
overall median age was 70 years, 95% of patients had an ECOG PS of 0 to 1 and median Gleason score 
was 8. Sixty one percent (61%) of the patients had their prior treatment with an AR-targeted agent after 
prior docetaxel. 
The study met its primary endpoint: rPFS was significantly longer with CABAZITAXEL compared to 
AR-targeted agent (8.0 months versus 3.7 respectively), with a 46% reduction in the risk of 
radiographic progression compared to AR-targeted agent (see table 6 and figure 2).

Tick marks indicate censored data. 
Planned subgroup analyses for rPFS based on stratification factors at randomization yielded a hazard 
ratio of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.39 to 0.96) in patients who received a prior AR-targeted agent before docetaxel 
and a hazard ratio of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.70) in patients who received a prior AR-targeted agent 
after docetaxel. 
CABAZITAXEL was statistically superior to the AR-targeted comparators for each of the alpha-
protected key secondary endpoints including overall survival (13.6 months for CABAZITAXEL arm 
versus 11.0 months for AR-targeted agent arm, HR 0.64, 95%CI: 0.46 to 0.89; p=0.008), progression-
free survival (4.4 months for CABAZITAXEL arm versus 2.7 months for AR-targeted agent arm, HR 
0.52; 95%CI: 0.40 to 0.68), confirmed PSA response (36.3% for CABAZITAXEL arm versus 14.3% 
for AR-targeted agent arm, p=0.0003) and best tumour response (36.5% for CABAZITAXEL arm 
versus 11.5% for AR-targeted agent arm, p=0.004). 
The safety profile of CABAZITAXEL 25 mg/m2 observed in CARD study was overall consistent with 
that observed in TROPIC and PROSELICA studies (see section 4.8). The incidence of grade ≥ 3 
adverse events was 53.2% in CABAZITAXEL arm versus 46.0% in the AR-targeted agent arm. The 
incidence of grade ≥ 3 serious adverse events were 31.7% in CABAZITAXEL arm versus 37.1% in the 
AR-targeted agent arm. The incidence of patients who permanently discontinued study treatment due to 
adverse events was 19.8% in CABAZITAXEL arm versus 8.1% in the AR-targeted agent arm. The 
incidence of patients having an adverse event leading to death was 5.6% in CABAZITAXEL arm 
versus 10.5% in the AR-targeted agent arm.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
cabazitaxel in all subsets of the paediatric population in the indication of prostate cancer (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
Cabazitaxel was evaluated in an open label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study conducted in a total of 39 
paediatric patients (aged between 4 to18 years for the phase 1 part of the study and between 3 to 16 
years for the phase 2 part of the study). The phase 2 part did not demonstrate efficacy of cabazitaxel as 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
single agent in paediatric population with recurrent or refractory diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma 
(DIPG) and high grade glioma (HGG) treated at 30 mg/m². 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out in 170 patients including patients with advanced 
solid tumours (n=69), metastatic breast cancer (n=34) and metastatic prostate cancer (n=67). These 
patients received cabazitaxel at doses of 10 to 30 mg/m2 weekly or every 3 weeks. 
Absorption 
After 1-hour intravenous administration at 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic prostate 
cancer (n=67), the Cmax was 226 ng/ml (Coefficient of Variation (CV): 107%) and was reached at the 
end of the 1-hour infusion (Tmax). The mean AUC was 991 ng.h/ml (CV: 34%). 
No major deviation to the dose proportionality was observed from 10 to 30 mg/m2 in patients with 
advanced solid tumours (n=126). 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution (Vss) was 4870 l (2640 l/m2 for a patient with a median BSA of 1.84 m2) at 
steady state. 
In vitro, the binding of cabazitaxel to human serum proteins was 89-92% and was not saturable up to 
50,000 ng/ml, which covers the maximum concentration observed in clinical studies. Cabazitaxel is 
mainly bound to human serum albumin (82.0%) and lipoproteins (87.9% for HDL, 69.8% for LDL, and 
55.8% for VLDL). The in vitro blood-to-plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.90 
to 0.99 indicating that cabazitaxel was equally distributed between blood and plasma. 
Biotransformation 
Cabazitaxel is extensively metabolised in the liver (>95%), mainly by the CYP3A isoenzyme (80% to 
90%). Cabazitaxel is the main circulating compound in human plasma. Seven metabolites were detected 
in plasma (including 3 active metabolites issued form O-demethylations), with the main one accounting 
for 5% of parent exposure. Around 20 metabolites of cabazitaxel are excreted into human urine and 
faeces. 
Based on in vitro studies, the potential risk of inhibition by cabazitaxel at clinically relevant 
concentrations is possible towards medicinal products that are mainly substrate of CYP3A. However a 
clinical study has shown that cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 administered as a single 1-hour infusion) did not 
modify the plasma levels of midazolam, a probe substrate of CYP3A. Therefore, at therapeutic doses, 
co-administration of CYP3A substrates with cabazitaxel to patients is not expected to have any clinical 
impact. 
There is no potential risk of inhibition of medicinal products that are substrates of other CYP enzymes 
(1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C8, 2C19, 2E1, and 2D6) as well as no potential risk of induction by cabazitaxel on 
medicinal products that are substrates of CYP1A, CYP2C9, and CYP3A. Cabazitaxel did not inhibit 
in vitro the major biotransformation pathway of warfarin into 7-hydroxywarfarin, which is mediated by 
CYP2C9. Therefore, no pharmacokinetic interaction of cabazitaxel on warfarin is expected in vivo. 
In vitro cabazitaxel did not inhibit Multidrug-Resistant Proteins (MRP): MRP1 and MRP2 or Organic 
Cation Transporter (OCT1). Cabazitaxel inhibited the transport of P-glycoprotein (PgP) (digoxin, 
vinblastin), Breast-Cancer-Resistant-Proteins (BCRP) (methotrexate) and Organic Anion Transporting 
Polypeptide OATP1B3 (CCK8) at concentrations at least 15 fold what is observed in clinical setting 
while it inhibited the transport of OATP1B1 (estradiol-17β-glucuronide) at concentrations only 5 fold 
what is observed in clinical setting. Therefore the risk of interaction with substrates of MRP, OCT1, 
PgP, BCRP and OATP1B3 is unlikely in vivo at the dose of 25 mg/m2. The risk of interaction with 
OATP1B1 transporter is possible, notably during the infusion duration (1 hour) and up to 20 minutes 
after the end of the infusion (see section 4.5). 
Elimination 
After a 1-hour intravenous infusion [14C]-cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 in patients, approximately 80% of 
the administered dose was eliminated within 2 weeks. Cabazitaxel is mainly excreted in the faeces as 
numerous metabolites (76% of the dose); while renal excretion of cabazitaxel and metabolites account 
for less than 4% of the dose (2.3% as unchanged medicinal product in urine). 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cabazitaxel had a high plasma clearance of 48.5 1/h (26.4 1/h/m2 for a patient with a median BSA of 
1.84 m2) and a long terminal half-life of 95 hours. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis in 70 patients of 65 years and older (57 from 65 to 75 and 13 
patients above 75), no age effect on the pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel was observed. 
Paediatric patients 
Safety and effectiveness of cabazitaxel have not been established in children and adolescents below 18 
years of age. 
Hepatic impairment 
Cabazitaxel is eliminated primarily via liver metabolism. 
A dedicated study in 43 cancer patients with hepatic impairment showed no influence of mild (total 
bilirubin >1 to ≤1.5 x ULN or AST >1.5 x ULN) or moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to ≤3.0 x ULN) 
hepatic impairment on cabazitaxel pharmacokinetics. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
cabazitaxel was 20 and 15 mg/m2, respectively. 
In 3 patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 ULN), a 39% decrease in clearance was 
observed when compared to patients with mild hepatic impairment, indicating some effect of severe 
hepatic impairment on cabazitaxel pharmacokinetics. The MTD of cabazitaxel in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment was not established. 
Based on safety and tolerability data, cabazitaxel dose should be reduced in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (see sections 4.2, 4.4). Cabazitaxel Accord is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.3). 
Renal impairment 
Cabazitaxel is minimally excreted via the kidney (2.3% of the dose). A population pharmacokinetic 
analysis carried out in 170 patients that included 14 patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance in the range of 30 to 50 ml/min) and 59 patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance in the range of 50 to 80 ml/min) showed that mild to moderate renal impairment did not have 
meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel. This was confirmed by a dedicated 
comparative pharmacokinetic study in solid cancer patients with normal renal function (8 patients), 
moderate (8 patients) and severe (9 patients) renal impairment, who received several cycles of 
cabazitaxel in single intravenous infusion up to 25 mg/m2. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in dogs after single dose, 5-day and weekly 
administation at exposure levels lower than clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to 
clinical use were arteriolar/periarterolar necrosis in the liver, bile ductule hyperplasia and/or 
hepatocellular necrosis (see section 4.2). 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in rats during repeat-dose toxicity studies at 
exposure levels higher than clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were eye 
disorders characterized by subcapsular lens fiber swelling/degeneration. These effects were partially 
reversible after 8 weeks. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with cabazitaxel. 
Cabazitaxel did not induce mutations in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test. It was not 
clastogenic in an in vitro test in human lymphocytes (no induction of structural chromosomal aberration 
but it increased number of polyploid cells) and induced an increase of micronuclei in the in vivo test in 
rats.These genotoxicity findings (by an aneugenic mechanism) are inherent to the pharmacological 
activity of the compound (inhibition of tubulin depolymerization). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cabazitaxel did not affect mating performances or fertility of treated male rats. However, in repeated-
dose toxicity studies, degeneration of seminal vesicle and seminiferous tubule atrophy in the testis were 
observed in rats, and testicular degeneration (minimal epithelial single cell necrosis in epididymis), was 
observed in dogs. Exposures in animals were similar or lower than those seen in humans receiving 
clinically relevant doses of cabazitaxel. 
Cabazitaxel induced embryofoetal toxicity in female rats treated intravenously once daily from 
gestational days 6 through 17 linked with maternal toxicity and consisted of foetal deaths and decreased 
mean foetal weight associated with delay in skeletal ossification. Exposures in animals were lower than 
those seen in humans receiving clinically relevant doses of cabazitaxel. Cabazitaxel crossed the placenta 
barrier in rats. 
In rats, cabazitaxel and its metabolites are excreted in maternal milk at a quantity up to 1.5% of 
administered dose over 24 hours. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Results of environmental risk assessment studies indicated that use of cabazitaxel will not cause 
significant risk to the aquatic environment (see section 6.6 for disposal of unused product).

For storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
3 ml of concentrate in a 6 ml clear tubular glass vial (type I) closed with a 20 mm grey siliconized 
rubber closure (type I) with teflon film on plug surface and sealed by an aluminium cap covered with a 
violet plastic flip-off cap. 
Each carton contains one single use vial. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handing 
Cabazitaxel should only be prepared and administered by personnel trained in handling cytotoxic 
agents. Pregnant staff should not handle the medicinal product. As for any other antineoplastic agent, 
caution should be exercised when handling and preparing cabazitaxel solutions, taking into account the 
use of containment devices, personal protective equipment (e.g. gloves), and preparation procedures. If 
cabazitaxel, at any step of its handling, should come into contact with the skin, wash immediately and 
thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous membranes, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with water. 
Preparation for the intravenous administration  
DO NOT use together with other cabazitaxel medicinal products with a different concentration 
cabazitaxel. Cabazitaxel Accord contains 20 mg/ml of cabazitaxel (at least 3 ml deliverable volume). 
Each vial is of single use and should be used immediately. Discard any unused solution. 
More than one vial of Cabazitaxel Accord may be necessary to administer the prescribed dose. 
The dilution process must be carried out in an aseptic manner for preparing the solution for infusion. 
Preparation of the infusion solution  
Step 1 
Aseptically withdraw the required volume of 
Cabazitaxel Accord (which contains 20 mg/ml of 
cabazitaxel), with a graduated syringe fitted with a 
needle. As an example, a dose of 45 mg cabazitaxel 
would require 2.25 ml of the Cabazitaxel Accord. 
Step 2 
Inject in a sterile PVC-free container of either 5% 
glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) 
solution for infusion. The concentration of the 
infusion solution should be between 0.10 mg/ml and 
0.26 mg/ml. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3 
Remove the syringe and mix the content of the 
infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking 
motion. The infusion solution is clear colourless 
solution. 
Step 4 
As with all parenteral products, the resulting 
infusion solution should be visually inspected prior 
to use. As the infusion solution is supersaturated, it 
may crystallize over time. In this case, the solution 
must not be used and should be discarded. 
The infusion solution should be used immediately. However, in-use storage time can be longer under 
specific conditions mentioned in section 6.3. 
An in-line filter of 0.22 micrometer nominal pore size (also referred to as 0.2 micrometer) is 
recommended during administration. 
Do not use PVC infusion containers or polyurethane infusion sets for the preparation and administration 
of cabazitaxel. 
Cabazitaxel must not be mixed with any other medicinal products than those mentioned. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cabazitaxel Accord is and what it is used for 
The name of your medicine is Cabazitaxel Accord. Its common name is cabazitaxel. It belongs to a 
group of medicines called “taxanes” used to treat cancers. 
Cabazitaxel Accord is used to treat adults with prostate cancer that has progressed after having had 
other chemotherapy. It works by stopping cells from growing and multiplying. 
As part of your treatment, you will also take a corticosteroid medicine (prednisone or prednisolone) by 
mouth every day. Ask your doctor to give you information about this other medicine. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Cabazitaxel Accord 
Do not use Cabazitaxel Accord if 
• 
you are allergic (hypersensitive) to cabazitaxel, to other taxanes, or polysorbate 80 or any of the 
other excipients of this medicine (listed in section 6), 
the number of your white blood cells is too low (neutrophil counts less than or equal to 
1,500/mm3), 
you have severe abnormal liver function, 
you have recently received or are about to receive a vaccine against yellow fever. 
• 
• 
• 
You should not be given Cabazitaxel Accord if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, 
talk to your doctor before having Cabazitaxel Accord. 
Warnings and precautions 
Before each treatment with Cabazitaxel Accord, you will have blood tests to check that you have 
enough blood cells and sufficient liver and kidney functions to receive Cabazitaxel Accord. 
Tell your doctor immediately if: 
• 
you have fever. During treatment with Cabazitaxel Accord, it is more likely that your white blood 
cell count may be reduced. Your doctor will monitor your blood and general condition for signs 
of infections. He/she may give you other medicines to maintain the number of your blood cells. 
People with low blood counts can develop life-threatening infections. The earliest sign of 
infection may be fever, so if you experience fever, tell your doctor right away. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you have ever had any allergies. Serious allergic reactions can occur during treatment with 
Cabazitaxel Accord. 
you have severe or long-lasting diarrhoea, you feel sick (nausea) or you are being sick 
(vomiting). Any of these events could cause severe dehydration. Your doctor may need to treat 
you. 
you have feeling of numbness, tingling, burning or decreased sensation in your hands or feet. 
you have any bleeding problems from the gut or have changes in the colour of your stool or 
stomach pain. If the bleeding or pain is severe, your doctor will stop your treatment with 
Cabazitaxel Accord. This is because Cabazitaxel Accord may increase the risk of bleeding or 
developing holes in the gut wall. 
you have kidney problems. 
• 
•  you have yellowing of the skin and eyes, darkening of the urine, severe nausea (feeling sick) or 
vomiting, as they could be signs or symptoms of liver problems.  
• 
•

you have blood in your urine. 
If any of the above applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. Your doctor may reduce the dose of 
Cabazitaxel Accord or stop the treatment. 
Other medicines and Cabazitaxel Accord 
Please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. 
This includes medicines obtained without a prescription. This is because some medicines can affect the 
way Cabazitaxel Accord works or Cabazitaxel Accord can affect how other medicines work. These 
medicines include the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ketoconazole, rifampicin (for infections); 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin (for seizures); 
St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) (herbal remedy for depression and other conditions);

How to use Cabazitaxel Accord  
Instructions for use 
Anti-allergic medicines will be given to you before you have Cabazitaxel Accord to reduce the risk 
of allergic reactions. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Cabazitaxel Accord will be given to you by a doctor or a nurse. 
Cabazitaxel Accord must be prepared (diluted) before it is given. Practical information for 
handling and administration of Cabazitaxel Accord for doctors, nurses and pharmacists is 
provided with this leaflet. 
Cabazitaxel Accord will be given by a drip (infusion) into one of your veins (intravenous use) in 
hospital for about an hour. 
As part of your treatment, you will also take a corticosteroid medicine (prednisone or 
prednisolone) by mouth every day. 
How much and how often to have 
• 
The usual dose depends on your body surface area. Your doctor will calculate your body surface 
area in square meters (m²) and will decide the dose you should have. 
You will usually have an infusion once every 3 weeks. 
• 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Your 
doctor will discuss these with you and will explain the potential risks and benefits of your treatment. 
See a doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects: 
• 
• 
• 
fever (high temperature). This is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
severe loss of body fluids (dehydration). This is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
This can occur if you have severe or long-lasting diarrhoea, or fever, or if you are being sick

Cabazitaxel Accord solutions, taking into account the use of containment devices, personal protective 
equipment (e.g. gloves), and preparation procedures. 
If Cabazitaxel Accord, at any step of its handling, should come into contact with the skin, wash 
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If it should come into contact with mucous 
membranes, wash immediately and thoroughly with water. 
Cabazitaxel Accord should only be prepared and administered by personnel trained in handling

Preparation of the infusion solution  
Step 1 
Aseptically withdraw the required volume of 
Cabazitaxel Accord (which contains 20 mg/ml of 
cabazitaxel), with a graduated syringe fitted with a 
needle. As an example, a dose of 45 mg 
cabazitaxel would require 2.25 ml of the 
Cabazitaxel Accord. 
Step 2 
Inject in a sterile PVC-free container of either 5% 
glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9%) solution for infusion. The concentration of 
the infusion solution should be between 
0.10 mg/ml and 0.26 mg/ml. 
Step 3 
Remove the syringe and mix the content of the 
infusion bag or bottle manually using a rocking 
motion. The infusion solution is clear colourless 
solution. 
Step 4 
As with all parenteral products, the resulting 
infusion solution should be visually inspected prior 
to use. As the infusion solution is supersaturated, it 
may crystallize over time. In this case, the solution 
must not be used and should be discarded. 
The infusion solution should be used immediately. Information on shelf life and special precautions 
for storage are above. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Method of administration 
Cabazitaxel Accord is administered as a 1 hour infusion. 
An in-line filter of 0.22 micrometer nominal pore size (also referred to as 0.2 micrometer) is 
recommended during administration. 
PVC infusion containers or polyurethane infusion sets should not be used for the preparation and 
administration of the infusion solution.

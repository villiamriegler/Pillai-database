Introduction 
On 24 February 2016, the MAH submitted a completed study that included paediatric patients for 
Lucentis, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
Study CRFB002G2302 (PROMETHEUS, EudraCT No. 2012-005418-20), “A 12-month, randomized, 
double-masked, sham-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg 
ranibizumab intravitreal injections in patients with visual impairment due to vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) driven macular edema (ME)” is part of a clinical development program in the 
adult population. Since some ocular conditions that cause ME in adults can also occur in the paediatric 
population, during the conceptual discussion of the Lucentis Paediatric Investigation plan (PIP) with 
CHMP, before the PIP waiver was granted on 06 August 2014 [EMEA-000527-PIP03-13], it was agreed 
that the study should be open also for the inclusion of paediatric patients ≥12 years of age. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Lucentis 10 mg/ml ranibizumab solution for injection as the currently marketed formulation in the EU 
has been used. The formulation contains: 
 
Trehalose 10% (w/v) (provides an isotonic solution) for the intravitreal injection of 
ranibizumab.  
  Histidine HCl 10 mM (buffer) 
 
Polysorbate 20, 0.01% w/v (surfactant to minimize the risk of aggregation). 
During review of PIP [EMEA-000527-PIP03-13], the formulation working group concluded that “the 
formulation is already optimized so there is no concern for its intravitreal injection to the pediatric 
population.” 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 κ isotype monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) that 
selectively binds and neutralises vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. Binding of VEGF-A to its 
receptors triggers angiogenesis and neovascularisation by promoting vascular endothelial cell 
proliferation/ migration and an increased vascular permeability resulting in leakage. The neutralisation 
of VEGF results in a reduced vascular leakage. 
Lucentis (ranibizumab), was approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age related macular 
degeneration (wAMD) in 2007, for the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema 
(DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in 2011 and for choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to 
pathologic myopia (PM) in 2013. Vascular leakage occurs in CNV that lead to exudation of intra- and 
subretinal fluids with subsequent atrophic changes (e.g. wAMD and PM) as well as in macular oedema

(DME and RVO). Subsequently, vision is impaired. The objective of the current procedure is to report a 
summary of the data obtained in adolescent patients from study CRFB002G2302. 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
  Study CRFB002G2302 (PROMETHEUS, EudraCT No. 2012-005418-20), “A 12-month, 
randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal injections in patients with visual impairment due to 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) driven macular edema (ME)”. 
1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study CRFB002G2302 (PROMETHEUS, EudraCT No. 2012-005418-20):  
“A 12-month, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal injections in patients with visual 
impairment due to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) driven macular edema (ME)” 
Description 
Methods 
This was a randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, multicenter study of ranibizumab in adult 
patients, with a non-randomized, open-label ranibizumab-treated cohort of adolescent patients. At 
Month 2, all adult patients assigned to the sham group were switched to individualized ranibizumab 
open-label treatment. Thus, as of Month 2, both adult and adolescent patients received open-label 
individualized ranibizumab intravitreal injections based on evidence of disease activity.  
Evidence of disease activity (eg, visual acuity impairment, intra-/sub-retinal fluid, cysts or leakage) 
was assessed clinically or based on imaging and functional testing. All assessments had equal weight 
for decision making. Study design components including all study procedures and assessments for 
adult and adolescent patients were presented in the 6-month CSR for completeness. This final CSR 
includes the results up to the Month 12 for adults and adolescent patients. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that an individualized regimen of intravitreal 
injection of ranibizumab 0.5 mg has superior efficacy compared to sham treatment in adult patients 
with visual impairment due to ME. The primary objective was assessed by the best-correct visual 
acuity (BCVA) change from baseline to Month 2 (letters in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRA) charts). 
The primary objective in the adolescent patients was to describe the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab 
in adolescent patients by assessing the same efficacy and safety objectives as chosen for adult patients 
where applicable and depending on the number of adolescent patients enrolled.

Study design 
For an outline of the study, see below figure. 
Study population /Sample size 
The main inclusion criteria were as follows: 
  Written informed consent (from adult patients and parents/guardians of adolescent patients) 
and written assent (from adolescents patients only) was to be obtained before any assessment 
was performed 
  Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age (adults) and male or female patients ≥ 12 and < 18 
years (adolescents) 
  Diagnosis of active ME secondary to any causes (for adult patients: except DME, wAMD and 
RVO) that was primary, chronic (ie, ME was present for > 3 months) or recurrent 
  BCVA was to be between ≥ 24 and ≤ 83 letters tested at 4 meters starting distance using 
 
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity (VA) charts 
(approximate Snellen chart equivalents of 20/25 and 20/320) 
  Visual loss in the study eye was to be mainly due to the presence of any eligible types of ME 
(for adult patients: non-DME, non-AMD, and non-RVO) based on ocular clinical, as well as FA 
and OCT findings 
Main exclusion criteria were as follows: 
  Any type of advanced, severe or unstable systemic disease or its treatment, that could 
interfere with primary and/or secondary outcome evaluations

  Active malignancies 
  Uncontrolled systemic inflammation or infection 
  Uncontrolled blood pressure defined as systolic value of ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic value of ≥ 100 
mmHg 
  History of stroke less than 6 months prior to screening 
The study population was planned to consist of approximately 177 patients.  
Treatments 
All eligible adolescent patients were treated in an open-label manner with a ranibizumab 0.5 mg 
intravitreal injection at baseline, followed by an individualized treatment regimen based on evidence of 
disease activity (judged clinically or based on morphology/imaging) as assessed by the investigator at 
each individual visit. 
Eligible adult patients were randomized at 2:1 ratio to receive ranibizumab or sham injection until 
Month 2. At Month 2, all adult patients (in both sham and ranibizumab arms) could receive 
ranibizumab open-label treatment. Thus, as of Month 2, both adult and adolescent patients received 
open-label individualized ranibizumab intravitreal injections based on evidence of disease activity.  
Evidence of disease activity (e.g., visual acuity (VA) impairment, intra-/sub-retinal fluid, cysts or 
leakage) was assessed clinically or based on imaging and functional testing. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The assessments performed for activity of ranibizumab on retinal structure and visual function were 
BCVA with ETDRS-like chart at 4 meters. 
 
The primary endpoint was the mean change in BCVA from baseline to Month 2. 
  Secondary evaluations of BCVA included evaluations of mean changes at various time points 
(e.g. 6 and 12 months) and responder analyses (e.g. proportion of patients gaining or loosing 
≥ 5, 10 or 15 letters in BCVA). 
Changes in retinal structures including the oedema (e.g. as central subfield thickness, CSFT) were 
conducted with optical coherence tomography (OCT), colour fundus photography, and fluorescein 
angiography. 
Health-related quality of life was assessed using the National Eye Institute Visual Function 
Questionnaire – 25 (NEI-VFQ-25). 
Safety assessments consisted of collecting all AEs, SAEs, ophthalmic examinations, intraocular 
pressure, vital signs, and laboratory parameters. 
No pharmacokinetic data were generated. 
Statistical Methods 
Data for adult and adolescent patients are presented separately. Data for adult patients were analysed 
and listed. Data for adolescent patients were listed only due to the small number.  
The last assessment collected just prior to start of treatment was considered to be the baseline value. 
All assessments performed after the first study treatment were considered to be post-baseline.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Overall, 178 adult and 3 adolescent patients were recruited.  
The 3 adolescent patients finalised the 12-month treatment period.  
For comparison, in the adult population, 106/118 (89.8%) and 50/60 (83.3%) in the ranibizumab and 
sham treatment arms, respectively finalised the 12 month treatment period. Discontinuations were 
mainly due to physician’s decision or lost to follow up (ranibizumab group) or due to withdrew consent 
(sham group).

As retinitis pigmentosa was prohibited ocular disorders in the study eye, patient 2171-20001 was 
recorded as a protocol deviation related to the inclusion criteria. 
For comparison, the adult population was in average 63 years old, somewhat more males (62%) and 
the majority were Caucasians. The mean baseline BCVA was 65 letters and the mean CSFT was 466 
μm. Baseline aetiologies were as follows: Inflammatory/Post-uveitis (12%), Pseudophakic/Aphakic 
(33%), CSC (14%), Idiopathic Retinopathy/Retinochoroidopathy (29%) and Miscellaneous (12%).

* A 5 letter improvement was reported in the patient’s treated fellow eye. 
In the adult population, at month 2, 6 and 12, the mean changes in BCVA were 5.7, 6.4 and 7.5 
letters, respectively in the ranibizumab treatment arm. The corresponding figures at months 2, 6 and 
12 were 2.9, 4.5 and 5.8 letters in the sham treatment arm (note that subjects in the sham treatment 
arm crossed over to receive ranibizumab from month 2). 
Safety results 
Adolescent population 
No patient died. No serious adverse events (SAEs), no severe adverse events (AEs) and no AEs 
suspected to be related to study drug were reported. No clinically notable abnormal vital signs were 
identified. No ocular AEs were reported. There were no patients with Intraocular pressure (IOP) of 30 
mmHg or greater in the study eye at any time post-baseline. 
Two episodes of epilepsy were reported for patient 2042-20001. Both events were of mild intensity, 
resolved without any action to the study medication and the investigator evaluated both events as not 
suspected to be related to the injection or medication. The reported non-ocular AE of epilepsy was 
consistent with the medical history of the patient (tuberous sclerosis, epilepsy and surgery for benign 
brain tumour). 
Adult population 
The most common ocular AEs were conjunctival haemorrhage (39.5%), eye pain (8.5%) and visual 
acuity reduced (5.6%). The most common non-ocular AEs were nasopharyngitis (53.1%), 
hypertension (7.9%) and influenza (4.5%). Three patients died during the 12-month study period, one 
patient in the sham arm died due to a brain stem stroke and basilar artery thrombosis (up to Month 2) 
and two patients in the ranibizumab treatment arm died due to a cardio-respiratory arrest and a 
cerebral haemorrhage. None of the deaths was considered by the investigator to be related to study 
treatment. A total of 3 patients experienced ocular SAEs in the ranibizumab treatment eye up to Month 
12; one event each of endophthalmitis (related to injection), worsening of glaucoma (not suspected 
related) and conjunctivitis allergic (not suspected related).

1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Three adolescent patients with different diagnoses (macular oedema secondary to pre-papillary benign 
tumour, idiopathic macular oedema and retinitis pigmentosa) were included in Study CRFB002G2302. 
During the 12 months of the study, they received 7 – 12 injections. A 45 and 8 letter improvement in 
BCVA was observed in the two subjects with idiopathic oedema and retinitis pigmentosa, respectively 
while the subject with a pre-papillary benign tumour lost 10 letters over the course of the study. The 
efficacy data from the three adolescent patients are too limited to draw any conclusions.  
With regards to safety, the narratives provided for the three patients did not report any related AEs, 
but again, the number of patients is too limited to draw any conclusions with regards to potential 
differences in the AE profile between the paediatric and the adult population. 
However, with regards to adolescent patients, the eye is fully developed and it would not be expected 
that the efficacy or the ocular AE profile would differ from that in the adult population.

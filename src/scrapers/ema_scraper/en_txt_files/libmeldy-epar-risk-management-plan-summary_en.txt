PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Libmeldy (a CD34+ cell enriched population that contains 
haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector 
encoding the human arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene). 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Libmeldy. The RMP details 
important risks of Libmeldy, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Libmeldy 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Libmeldy 's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Libmeldy should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Libmeldy should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Libmeldy 's 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Libmeldy is authorised for the treatment of patients with Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) 
(see SmPC for the full indication). It contains a CD34+ cell enriched population that contains 
haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector 
encoding the human arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene as the active substance and it is given by 
intravenous infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Libmeldy’s benefits can be found in Libmeldy’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage <link to product’s EPAR summary landing page on the EMA webpage> 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
II. 
the risks 
Important risks of Libmeldy, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Libmeldy’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Libmeldy, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Libmeldy is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II. 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Libmeldy are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Libmeldy. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Delayed platelet engraftment 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
During the clinical development of OTL-200, busulfan was used as 
a conditioning agent to promote efficient engraftment of the 
genetically modified autologous cells. When used at typical 
myeloablative doses in both adults and children, very commonly 
reported adverse reactions with busulfan include thrombocytopenia 
(Busulfan SmPC). 
During the clinical development of OTL-200, platelet engraftment 
was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days with platelet values ≥ 
20 x 109/L obtained on different days after Libmeldy infusion, with 
no platelet transfusion administered for 7 days immediately 
preceding and during the evaluation period (up to 60 days post gene 
therapy). 
Four subjects out of 35 (twins MLD-HE01 and MLD-HE02, MLD-
12 and MLD-22) experienced delayed platelet engraftment which 
was not correlated with an increased incidence of bleeding. 
The median number of days until platelet engraftment in the 
integrated safety population treated with the fresh formulation of 
OTL-200 (N=29) was 41 days (range:  14-109 days). The median 
number of days until platelet engraftment in the population treated 
with the cryopreserved (commercial) formulation of OTL-200 at 
the time of the MAA (N=6) was 37 days to platelet engraftment 
(range 23 to 47 days).  
Overall, during the clinical development of OTL-200 the report of 
delayed platelet engraftment was not correlated with an increased 
incidence of bleeding. However, all patients treated with OTL-200 
received transfusion support with platelets. Most of these 
transfusions were considered part of the standard of 
care/prophylaxis for these subjects, were received during the peri-
transplant period and mainly within the three months post gene 
therapy (≤ 100 days post-GT).  
The important identified safety concern of delayed platelet 
engraftment will be further characterised after the treatment of new 
patients in the context of clinical trials open to recruitment (Study 
205756 and Study OTL-200-07), and the treatment of patients after 
OTL-200 marketing authorisation (MA) approval and followed up 
as part of the LongTERM-MLD study (Part III.2). 
Overall, although delayed platelet engraftment was not correlated 
with an increased incidence of bleeding, this risk bears a potential 
for development of bleeding events due to prolonged 
thrombocytopenia, which can be serious.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Libmeldy consists of CD34+ cells transduced ex vivo with a LVV 
which integrates permanently into the host genome. The risk of 
insertional mutagenesis and consequent tumourigenicity has been 
evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo non-clinical studies. 
Integration site (IS) analysis performed on genomic DNA from 
whole peripheral blood (PB) and BM samples harvested at different 
time points after therapy showed a highly polyclonal pattern of 
vector integration in mice with no indication of abnormal clonal 
expansion. Hepatocellular tumours were observed in in vivo non-
clinical studies but they were considered related to the conditioning 
regimen and genetic background of the mice. Overall there was no 
evidence of preferential expansion of IS near proto-oncogenes in all 
analysed mice, with no increase in tumourigenesis found in a 
tumour prone mouse model.  
To date, no cases of malignancy or AEs indicative of oncogenic 
transformation have been reported. There was no evidence of 
abnormal clonal proliferation as assessed by clinical and laboratory 
surveillance and BM examination. These findings are similar to 
those reported in other LVV based HSPC gene therapy trials for 
X-adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome 
(WAS) (Biffi, 2013; Aiuti, 2013). 
Clinical trials, alongside data reported in the literature, can provide 
an estimate of the frequency of malignancies that are expected to 
occur in clinical practice.  
Factors thought to be important in contributing to the risk of 
oncogenesis (EMA/CAT/190186/2012): 
a) Vector design (including backbone and regulatory elements) 
b) Insertion profile 
c) Vector copy number (VCN) 
d) Transgene product 
e) Target cell population/organ 
f) Risk of malignancy for the underlying disease

Important potential risk: Anti-ARSA antibodies 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In the clinical development programme of Libmeldy including the 
integrated data set (N=29) and the available information from the 
Study 205756 (N=6) at the time of the RMP data cut, AAAs were 
detected transitorily, with low titres in a limited number of patients 
(4/35 patients, 11.4%). All the events resolved spontaneously or 
after treatment with one cycle of rituximab with no obvious impact 
on the clinical outcomes. 
In May 2020, after DLP of this RMP, data has emerged from two 
further AAA positive tests. One of these is the re-emergence of 
AAA in MLDCUP05 (titre 1:800; at Year 2), who previously had 
positive AAA which resolved spontaneously; and secondly, patient 
MLDCRY09 (titre 1:400 at Day 30).  
There was no evidence of a negative clinical effect observed in the 
post-treatment ARSA activity of PB/BM (or any other relevant 
cellular subpopulations) nor in the ARSA activity within CSF, 
which was quantifiable by 3 months post treatment and reached 
normal range in all patients by 12 months. In addition, from a 
mechanistic perspective, AAAs are not anticipated to interfere with 
the functionality of ARSA activity in brain due to the limitations of 
antibodies to cross the blood-brain barrier However, as further 
information is needed to characterize the potential impact of the 
presence of AAAs on the clinical and safety profile of Libmeldy, 
AAAs are considered an important potential risk.

Important potential risk: Engraftment failure 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
For successful engraftment in stem cell transplantation the body 
needs to accept the transplanted stem cells, and to produce new 
cells of all the normal lineages. Busulfan was used as a 
conditioning agent in the Libmeldy clinical development 
programme to enhance engraftment of the genetically modified 
autologous cells particularly given its capacity to cross the blood-
brain barrier, get access to the brain and remove resident microglia. 
In Study 201222 and in the EAPs all MLD patients treated with 
fresh formulation achieved sustained levels of engraftment and 
demonstrated good haematological recovery following busulfan 
conditioning. Engraftment was observed from 1-month following 
treatment and persisted at stable levels throughout the follow-up 
period. 
There is a theoretical risk that sub-optimal engraftment may occur 
with cryopreserved formulation due to cell loss or damage related 
to the cryopreservation but to date this has not been observed in 
patients treated with cryopreserved (commercial) formulation in 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Study 205756, in other clinical trials using cryopreserved drug 
products or in commercial patients using Libmeldy. 
The benefits and associated efficacy of Libmeldy are likely 
dependent on the stage of MLD at which it is given. 
In Study 201222 patients with advanced MLD symptoms were 
excluded because they are considered unlikely to obtain clinical 
benefit from Libmeldy. Additionally, patients with early-
symptomatic LI MLD were excluded from participation because 
this population is characterised by rapid disease progression 
(Biffi 2008a; Keher 2011a), leaving insufficient time for transduced 
cells to engraft, to start producing ARSA in the nervous system, 
and to influence clinical parameters (a process that can take several 
months). The exclusion of subjects with advanced symptoms in the 
current study is further reinforced by clinical experience with 
HSCT (Martin, 2013; van Rappard, 2015; Boelens, 2010; 
Boucher, 2015), which has shown that disease progression is not 
slowed in patients with moderate to severe neurological symptoms 
at the time of transplantation. 
To date there is no evidence of engraftment failure with either fresh 
or cryopreserved (commercial) formulations. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Information that no patients failed to engraft bone marrow in 
SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1 
Information that following successful and stable engraftment 
the effects of Libmeldy are expected to be persistent  in SmPC 
section 5.1 
Information in PL section 3 that the stem cells collected from 
the blood will be divided into a treatment sample, used to make 
Libmeldy and a backup sample, to be given as replacement 
stem cells if Libmeldy cannot be given. The backup sample may 
also be collected from the bone marrow.  
Instructions to obtain a CD34+ stem cell back-up harvested 
either through mPB apheresis or bone marrow harvest for use 
as rescue treatment in SmPC section 4.2 
•  Guidance that myeloablative conditioning is required before 
infusion of Libmeldy to promote engraftment in SmPC 
section 4.2 
•  Warning that in case of cytopenia symptoms, red blood cells 
and platelet counts should be monitored until engraftment of 
these cells and recovery are achieved in SmPC section 4.4 
•  Guidance to infuse the non-transduced back-up cells if 
cytopenia persists beyond six to seven weeks in SmPC section 
4.4.  
•  Guidance that in case of engraftment failure, the non-
transduced back-up cells should be infused in SmPC section 4.4

Important potential risk: Off label use in other MLD subgroups 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
During the clinical development, treatment failure was seen in four 
subjects treated outside of the currently proposed label. As a result, 
the indication statement was restricted.  
OTL-200 is indicated for the treatment of metachromatic 
leukodystrophy (MLD) characterized by biallelic mutations in the 
arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene leading to a reduction of the ARSA 
enzymatic activity 
- in children with late infantile or early juvenile forms without 
clinical manifestations of the disease 
- in children with the early juvenile form with early clinical 
manifestations of the disease who still have the ability to walk 
independently and before the onset of cognitive decline (see section 
5.1). 
Clinical trials can show the treatment failure that has occurred to 
date as a result of use outside of the proposed label and further 
analyses of these cases can continue to guide recommendations for 
treating MLD patients in clinical practice. 
Risk factors and risk groups

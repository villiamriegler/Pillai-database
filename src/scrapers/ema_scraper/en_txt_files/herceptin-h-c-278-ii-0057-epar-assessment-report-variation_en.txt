1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Trastuzumab is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of:   
Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) 
- 
as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two 
chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at 
least an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. 
Hormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are 
unsuitable for these treatments. 
- 
- 
- 
in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. 
in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with 
hormone-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, not previously treated with trastuzumab.  
Early Breast Cancer (EBC) 
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable)  
following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with 
paclitaxel or docetaxel. 
in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin.  
in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Herceptin therapy, for 
locally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter. 
Herceptin should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have 
either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated 
assay. 
The MAH applied for an additional indication in early breast cancer in combination with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy – as follows: 
Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive EBC in combination with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant Herceptin therapy, for locally advanced 
(including inflammatory) breast cancer or tumours > 2 cm in diameter. 
To support this claim, the MAH has submitted data from one pivotal study MO16432/NOAH.   
Information on Paediatric requirements  
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006, the application included an EMA decision 
P/17/2008 on the granting of a class waiver.

1.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects  
No new information on clinical pharmacology is submitted with this application 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data specific for trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting 
or data on the influence of shed-HER2 in this patient population is currently not available. 
At the request of the CHMP the MAH provided an overview on available PK data of trastuzumab in EBC 
adjuvant patient populations (previously submitted in the context of variation applications and follow 
up measures).  
The mean serum concentration-time profiles for trastuzumab administered every three weeks in EBC 
(study BO16348/HERA), and in MBC as monotherapy (study WO16229) or in combination with 
paclitaxel (study BO15935), are shown in Figure 1.

In the EBC patient population, the geometric mean values for trastuzumab Cmin concentrations were 
higher than that for MBC; 59% higher in Cycle 2 and 84% in Cycle 3. In the EBC group, there were 
approximately 30 patients with concentration data, which showed less variability as noted by a CV% 
value of approximately 30%, in contrast to approximately 67% for the MBC patient population. 
Consistent with these findings, the values for the range of concentrations were also higher for the EBC 
patients as compared to the MBC patients, with the observed ranges in Cycle 3 of 28-110 and 0.18-
203 μg/mL, for the EBC and MBC groups, respectively.  
In addition to the Cmin evaluations described above, trastuzumab pharmacokinetic parameters have 
been derived using non-compartmental methods at selected cycles of treatment where rich PK 
sampling was obtained in patients administered trastuzumab on an every three weeks schedule in 
early breast cancer (study BO16348/HERA), and in metastatic breast cancer as monotherapy (study 
WO16229) or in combination with paclitaxel (study BO15935); these data are shown in Table 2.

Since the full PK profiles in the three studies were measured at different cycles, to allow a comparison 
across studies, the steady-state clearance and AUCτ values obtained by non-compartmental analysis of 
Cycle 13 data in EBC (HERA study) were compared to simulated values using a population PK model 
derived from data which included three studies in metastatic breast cancer (BO15935, WO16229 and 
M77004) and one study in non-small cell lung cancer (BO15899). In this comparison, the mean AUCτ 
and clearance at steady-state for every three weeks dosing of trastuzumab in patients with MBC, were 
1793 mg.day/L and 0.226 L/day, compared to those obtained in EBC of 2255 mg.day/L and 0.181 
L/day, an approximate 25% difference between the two patient populations. The predicted median 
Cmin steady-state estimates in MBC were estimated to be 47.3 μg/mL compared to 63.2 μg/mL at 
Cycle 13 in the EBC HERA study. In the population PK analysis in MBC, serum shed-HER2 has been 
shown to influence trastuzumab clearance; in the HERA study, the effect shed-HER2 on the PK was not 
available for assessment. 
Altogether, with respect to predicted or measured exposure levels of trastuzumab during steady state 
the following order can be stated:

1.2.1.  Discussion 
The MAH has not provided pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data of trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant 
treatment setting. In particular data on shed Ag levels and usual PK parameters (such as dose Cmin, 
Cmax, AUC, T1/2,..) would be of interest, however such data are currently not available.  
Instead the MAH provided an overview on available PK data of trastuzumab in EBC and MBC adjuvant 
patient populations including full PK data of the HERA study. Interestingly, the comparison of all full 
Procedure No.: EMEA/H/C/000278/II/57

Page 5/58
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
profile PK data in MBC and EBC confirms that exposure in EBC is 25% higher than in MBC patients in 
terms of steady state AUC and Ctrough, whereas steady state Cmax is merely affected. Data on Cmin 
values suggest a more consistent exposure in the EBC patient population above a target concentration 
of 20 μg/mL, in contrast to the MBC patient population. The higher Cmin values in the EBC patients are 
likely explained by the lack of known factors in the EBC patients which are present in the MBC patient, 
such as a higher number of metastatic sites or other factors which have been identified in population 
pharmacokinetic analyses to be associated with a higher drug clearance. It would be expected that in 
the neoadjuvant setting, trastuzumab would have similar pharmacokinetic behavior to that observed in 
the EBC/adjuvant setting, given that the tumor load of neoadjuvant patients is only small.  
The difference between the populations is lower than might be expected from the difference in tumor 
load.  On the other hand, the difference in tumor load is suggested to be a reason for the lower (30-
50%) trastuzumab exposure in AGC versus MBC patients. This is not plausible.  
Data indicate that when the EBC patient population in the study BO16348/HERA study is compared to 
the MBC patient population, the geometric mean ratios for the Cmin concentrations in the EBC patients 
are higher, less variable, and show a more consistent exposure above a minimum target serum 
concentration of 20 μg/mL. There is likely no difference in the PK of trastuzumab  between the 
adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment setting since key factors known to influence clearance in the 
MBC patient population are absent. 
The PK profile of trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant-adjuvant setting is being investigated in the ongoing 
HannaH study (BO22227). This data will be submitted in the context of the upcoming line extension 
(tentative filing date 2nd March 2012). The HannaH study will provide intra-patient trastuzumab PK 
data in the neoadjuvant as well as adjuvant setting. Data available will include rich sampling during 
cycles 8 (neoadjuvant) and adjuvant (cycle 13) of treatment, where Cmin, Cmax, AUC, T 1/2 and CL 
will be determined by non-compartmental analysis. In addition, Cmin and Cmax will be available at 
each cycle through to cycle 13.  
1.2.2.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has not submitted new data on clinical pharmacology and this is acceptable given the 
extensive study of the pharmacology of trastuzumab over the years through a number of variation 
submissions and relevant follow-up measures. 
An overview of PK data in EBC and MBC data indicate that when the EBC patient population in the 
study BO16348/HERA study is compared to the MBC patient population, the geometric mean ratios for 
the Cmin concentrations in the EBC patients are higher, less variable, and show a more consistent 
exposure above a minimum target serum concentration of 20 μg/mL. There is likely no difference in 
the PK of trastuzumab  between the adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment setting since key factors 
known to influence clearance in the MBC patient population are absent. 
Additional PK data aiming to complement the understanding of trastuzumab PK.in the EBC population 
will be generated in an ongoing study and will be filled in the context of a line extension for a 
subcutaneous formulation in March 2012. 
1.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Neoadjuvant therapy has become a standard treatment option for many patients with newly diagnosed 
breast  cancer  and  is  given  prior  to  surgery.    Although  originally  developed  for  patients  with  large 
and/or  inoperable  tumours  to  enable  definitive  surgery  to  be  performed,  neoadjuvant  therapy  is  also 
now  used  in  patients  with  operable  EBC  to  try  to  avoid  a  mastectomy  and  enable  breast-conserving 
surgery  (BCS)  to  take  place.    Neoadjuvant  therapy  is  also  indicated  for  patients  with  inflammatory 
breast cancer (IBC), a sub-type characterised by erythema and oedema (peau d’orange) of a third or 
more of the skin of the breast with a palpable border, and an aggressive clinical course.  IBC is always 
considered  stage  T4  disease  (T4d).    Whether  in  patients  with  early,  operable  breast  cancer,  locally 
advanced  breast  cancer  (LABC)  or  IBC,  administration  of  systemic  therapy  before  definitive  surgery 
also  has  the  potential  advantages  of  treating  systemic  micrometastatic  disease  with  minimal  delay

after diagnosis and of enabling clinicians to detect and stop or change ineffective systemic therapy by 
directly observing the effects of treatment on the breast tumour. 
The  adverse  prognostic  significance  of  HER2-positivity  is  recognized  by  both  European  (St.  Gallen 
Consensus  Guidelines  –  2007  &  2009)  and  US  (National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  [NCCN]  - 
2010)  guidelines.    Both  sets  of  guidelines  justify  neoadjuvant  systemic  chemotherapy  in  invasive 
breast  cancer,  primarily  to  enhance  the  possibility  of  breast-conservative  surgery,  and  this  includes 
trastuzumab in HER-2 positive disease.  For example, the regimen recommended in NCCN guidelines is 
trastuzumab  in  combination  first  with  paclitaxel  then  with  CEF  (cyclophosphamide,  epirubicin, 
fluorouracil). 
This assessment primarily focuses on the data provided in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) of the single 
pivotal  trial  MO16432/NOAH.    The  MAH  has  also  submitted  additional  data  from  supportive  trials  as 
advised by the rapporteurs during pre-submission meetings. 
GCP 
The MAH confirms that the trials meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. Local 
Institutional Review Boards reviewed and approved the protocol and the Informed Consent Forms. 
Study sites were audited according to a published NCI guideline.  
1.3.1.  Clinical trial MO16432/NOAH 
The MO16432/NOAH study was conducted in 25 centres from 6 countries: Italy, Spain/Portugal, 
Germany/Austria, and Russia.   
This study was conducted by the Michelangelo (Milan, Italy) and SOLTI (Madrid, Spain) collaborative 
groups and independent centres. 
Patients were recruited between 2002 and 2005.  In 2005, Roche Clinical Quality Assurance group 
conducted audits at 5 centres.  Major finding(s) involving non-compliance with GCP were observed.  
Between November 26, 2009 and September 2010, Roche performed a re-monitoring of the study with 
complete source data verification. Importantly, source data were no longer available for 6% of the 
patients. Three patients had to be excluded from the analysis due to major GCP violation (late protocol 
approval by the Ethics Committee and missing informed consent). A relatively high number of patients 
(59) required a change of the disease stage category as recorded at randomisation; 44 of these 
patients were from the largest Russian site (47296).  During the Roche re-monitoring, it was 
discovered that, for these patients, the source data did not correspond to the disease stage used for 
stratification.  In most of these patients, the disease stage was changed from IBC to either T4 non-
inflammatory or any TN2.  Additionally, hormone receptor status as recorded at randomisation was 
later changed for a total of 5 patients. 
Clinical Study MO16432 was an international, open-label, phase III trial in women with newly 
diagnosed locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) defined as TNM 
stage T3N1 or T4 (skin or nipple invasion, peau d’orange, extension into chest wall or inflammatory 
carcinoma); any T plus N2 or N3; or any T plus involvement of ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes.  
Patients with HER2-positive disease (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ and/or HER2 amplification) were 
randomized to receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant 
trastuzumab (HER2+TC group), or neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (HER2+C group). 
A parallel observational cohort of patients with HER2-negative disease was included in the study. 
Patients with HER2-negative disease (IHC 0 or 1+) were randomly allocated to a parallel observation 
group (HER2–C) in a ratio of 1:3 (on-study/offstudy). These patients received the same chemotherapy 
regimen as patients with HER2-positive disease, but without trastuzumab. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of study MO16432 was:

EMA/36190/2012Rev10.11 
Page 7/58
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• To compare event-free survival (EFS) in patients with HER2-positive disease who received 
chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. 
The secondary objectives of study MO16432 were: 
1. To compare the following in patients with HER2-positive disease who received chemotherapy alone 
or chemotherapy plus trastuzumab: 
• Pathological complete response (pCR) rate 
• Overall clinical response rate (ORR) including: 
– Complete response (CR) rate 
– Partial response (PR) rate 
• Overall Survival (OS) 
• Safety and tolerability 
• Changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)  
2. To document the same efficacy (EFS, ORR, OS) and safety parameters (safety, tolerability and 
LVEF) in patients with HER2-negative disease who received the same chemotherapy regimen without 
trastuzumab. 
3. To describe the biological characteristics of tumors that might predict tumor response. 
Primary efficacy parameter 
The primary efficacy variable was event-free survival (EFS). This was defined as the time between 
randomization and date of documented occurrence of an event, defined as disease recurrence or 
progression (local, regional, distant or contralateral), or death due to any cause. For patients with 
HER2-negative disease, ‘randomization’ was defined as the date of study registration. 
If there was any tumor assessment prior to surgery satisfying the criteria for progressive disease, the 
patient was evaluated as having an event even if the investigator did not judge the patient as having 
progressed. For these cases, the date of progression was set to the date of the examination. 
For patients who did not undergo surgery and thus were not free of breast cancer at any time in the 
study, only disease progression or death was considered as an event during follow-up. 
All events up to and including the cut-off date of March 30, 2009 were included in the analysis 
irrespective of whether there was missing follow-up information for the patient prior to the event. 
Patients without event up to the cut-off date and with follow-up information after the cut-off date were 
censored at the cut-off date. 
Secondary Efficacy Parameters 
Secondary efficacy variables were as follows: 
• Pathological Complete Response Rate 
– Pathological complete response of the primary tumor (breast pathological complete response [bpCR]) 
was defined as the absence of any invasive cancer cell of the primary tumor at major surgery after 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± trastuzumab. 
− Pathological complete response of the primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes (total pathological 
complete response [tpCR]): bpCR was associated with the presence or absence of positive axillary 
nodes at pathology.  
• Overall Clinical Response Rate 
During the study, response was assessed clinically, by mammogram and ultrasound after each of the 
chemotherapy phases of the treatment period (doxorubicin + paclitaxel, paclitaxel alone, CMF). For the 
overall clinical response assessment, only the findings from the clinical evaluation were used. 
The response categories (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD] and 
progressive disease [PD]) were calculated according to modified RECIST Criteria.

For assessing response in inflammatory carcinoma (T4d; ie, extent of breast edema or erythema), the 
NOAH Protocol Steering Committee defined the following criteria 
Overall response rate was defined as CR plus PR. 
• Overall Survival 
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due 
to any cause. If patients had not been reported as having died at the time of the cut-off date of March 
30, 2009, they were censored at the last date of `last tumor measurement`, ‘last follow-up’ or ‘last 
drug intake’.

× ULN, alkaline phosphatase > 1.25 × ULN, serum creatinine > 1.5 × ULN. Hepatic metastases were 
excluded as a cause of abnormal liver function tests. 
Cross over 
After positive results from adjuvant trastuzumab trials became available, HER2-positive patients 
randomized to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone were offered one year of postoperative 
adjuvant trastuzumab and 20 patients crossed over to adjuvant therapy. 
Sample size 
Sample size calculation was based on a 50% EFS rate at 3 years in HER2 positive subjects receiving 
chemotherapy alone compared to a 68,5% EFS rate in HER2 positive subjects receiving chemotherapy  
and trastuzumab (HR = 0.545). Based on these assumptions it was calculated that a Log- Rank test on 
EFS required 86 EFS events in the two HER2-positive arms to achieve 80% power to detect a hazard 
ratio of 0.545 at a 2-sided significance level of 5%. It was estimated that about 116 patients per 
HER2-positive treatment were needed to observe 86 within a reasonable time frame. 
In addition, 100 patients with HER2-negative disease were planned as a control arm. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were centrally randomized applying a minimization technique according to Taves (Taves, DR 
et al; Minimization: a new method of assigning patients to treatment and control group. Clin Pharmacol 
Ther. 1974; 15: 443-453)  to assign HER2-positive patients to the two treatment groups. 
Randomization was stratified for geographical area (Germany/Austria; Italy; Russia; Spain/Portugal; 
other), disease stage (T3N1M0 or T4 non inflammatory, N0-1, M0; inflammatory disease, M0; any T, 
Procedure No.: EMEA/H/C/000278/II/57

N2 or ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes) and hormone receptor status (ER and/or PgR positive; both 
negative).  
Patients with HER2-negative tumours were stratified according to the same pre-specified variables and 
randomly allocated to the parallel study cohort or not, using the same minimization technique and a 
ratio of 1 (study):3 (off-study).  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label trial. Pathological response assessment was performed by the local pathologist 
because this has been standard practice in neoadjuvant trials to date. Central pathology review has not 
yet become a standard procedure in this setting. Also, the local pathologist was not formally blinded as 
to the study treatment. However, treatment information was usually not included in the pathology 
request form, so it can be assumed that most pathologists were unaware of the study treatment. 
Statistical methods 
The confirmatory statistical analysis was done for both HER2+ groups, descriptive analyses were used 
to compare the HER2+ and HER2- groups of patients receiving only chemotherapy.  
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were tabulated and presented by treatment group.  
Kaplan-Meier estimates were applied to estimate the distribution of time-to-event variables. An 
unstratified log-rank test was used to compare both HER2+ groups with respect to the primary and 
secondary time-to-event efficacy endpoints. COX regression was applied to estimate hazard ratios 
including the pertinent 95% confidence intervals. Response rates where compared by means of the 
chi-squared test. All statistical tests were conducted at the 2-sided 5% level of significance. 
The primary efficacy analysis was done for the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population (excluding patients 
with significant GCP problems or missing informed consent). In order to assess the robustness of the 
study results, sensitivity analyses were performed: censoring EFS for patients from the HER2+C arm 
who crossed over to trastzumab and COX regression analyses (in case of event data) as well as logistic 
regression analyses (in case of response data) using the stratification factors as covariates. 
1.3.2.  Results 
The first patient was randomized in the study on June 2002 and the last patient on December 12, 
2005. The clinical cut-off date for the analysis presented in this report was March 30, 2009.  After data 
transfer and further data cleaning conducted, the database was locked on July 27, 2010. 
At this time the median duration of follow-up was 45.9 months (range 2.1-76.8 months) in the 
HER2+TC arm, 42.1 months (range 0.0-77.5 months) in the HER2+C and 48.1 months (range 0.9-
75.5 months) in the HER2–C arm. 
Study conduct and Protocol amendments 
Three committees were involved in the MO16432 study: 
• An International Advisory Committee 
• A Protocol Steering Committee 
• A NOAH Biomarker (BM) Steering Committee reporting to NOAH Protocol Steering Committee 
Details of the duties, meeting frequencies etc  of these committees are documented.  Essentially, the 
International Advisory Committee was responsible for providing general advice related to emerging 
data from other trials, reviewing safety data, including LVEF data, on an ongoing basis. The Protocol 
Steering Committee was responsible for running the MO16432 trial and implementing 
recommendations from International Advisory Committee, as appropriate. 
The study protocol was amended six times (version B to version G).

Protocol Amendment Version B, dated March 13, 2002 
Cardiac data from the NCCTG N9831 study were reviewed by the NOAH Protocol Steering Committee 
and the protocol was modified to improve the cardiac safety of patients in the trial 
Protocol Amendment Version C, dated June 1, 2004 
Revision of the entry criteria in order to increase recruitment; e.g. also inclusion of patients with T3N1 
disease (previously only patients with T4 disease or patients with N2 or N3 disease or ipsilateral 
supraclavicular lymph nodes were allowed in the study). 
Protocol Amendment Version D, dated November 9, 2005 
Announcement of positive interim results from several adjuvant trastuzumab studies (study BO16348 
[HERA], the BCIRG006 study, and a joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 trials) 
necessitated that patients with HER2-positive disease randomized to the comparator arm of the 
MO16432 trial were to be offered adjuvant trastuzumab. 
Protocol Amendment Version E, dated June 30, 2006 
Change in the number of events required for the primary analysis. Instead of 106 events, 86 events 
were required. This change was based on the observation that a higher percentage of patients than 
expected crossed over to receive trastuzumab as part of their treatment regimen. 
Protocol Amendment Version F, dated July 21, 2008 
Clarification on when the full clinical study report would be written (at the time of the primary 
analysis). 
Protocol Amendment Version G, dated August 20, 2009 
At the time of the primary analysis, median EFS had not been reached in either arm, and the number 
of deaths was low. It was therefore decided to extend follow-up for another three years. Based on data 
simulations, approximately 60% of patients would be expected to have experienced an EFS event and 
32% of patients to have died after an additional 3 years of follow-up. 
  Treatments 
The following chemotherapy regimen was used for all patients: 
o Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and paclitaxel 150 mg/m2, every three weeks for 3 cycles, followed by 
o Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, every three weeks for 4 cycles, followed by 
o CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluoracil) every 4 weeks for 3 cycles. 
Surgery and radiotherapy were scheduled after completion of CMF chemotherapy. Adjuvant tamoxifen 
(Tam) was also to be started in patients with tumors that were estrogen receptor (ER) and/or 
progesterone receptor (PgR) positive.  
In patients randomized to receive trastuzumab, treatment was to start at the beginning of 
chemotherapy (with doxorubicin plus paclitaxel), and to be given throughout chemotherapy and up 
until surgery. Trastuzumab was to be given at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 3 weeks after an 
initial 8 mg/kg loading dose. After surgery, trastuzumab was to recommence before or during 
radiotherapy treatment, and to continue until 1 year after starting. Depending on when trastuzumab 
was re-started after surgery, up to 17 cycles of trastuzumab would be received in total. 
Patient disposition 
A total of 333 patients were enrolled in the study: 234 with HER2-positive disease (116 randomized to 
the HER2+TC arm, 118 to the HER2+C arm) and 99 with HER2-negative disease (HER2-C arm). The 
number of patients screened but not enrolled was not collected. 
Patients were recruited from 25 centers in 6 countries: Russia, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria and 
Portugal. The majority of the patients were enrolled in Russia (178 patients, 53.5% of the total). Spain 
and Portugal enrolled 71 patients (21.3%), Italy enrolled 57 (17.1%) and the rest were enrolled in 
Germany and Austria (27 patients, 8.1%). 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
A total of 3 patients were excluded from all statistical analyses. Thus, the primary efficacy population 
(FAS) consisted of 330 patients (115 in HER2+TC, 116 in HER2+C, 99 in HER2-C).

Safety Analysis Population (SAP) 
Overall, six patients did not receive any study treatment (1 in HER2+TC, 5 in HER2+C).  
Patient Disposition across study periods (FAS) 
A total of 84.5% [279/330] of patients (112 pts in HER2+TC, 20 pts in HER2+C→T, 68 pts in HER2+C, 
79 pts in HER2-C) was considered to enter the post-operative phase ie, they received at least one dose 
of study medication and had at least one safety assessment after surgery.

Distribution of patients by stratification variables as corrected in the CRF (FAS) 
As a consequence of the re-monitoring, a relatively high number of patients (59 patients in FAS, 28 in 
the HER2+C arm and 31 in the HER2+TC arm) required a change of the disease stage category as 
recorded at randomization.  
This imbalance arose due to a change to the initial disease stage category for 59/231 HER2-positive 
patients during the Roche re-monitoring (44 of these patients were from centre 47296). It was 
discovered that, for these patients, the source data did not correspond to the disease stage used for 
stratification. In most of these patients, the disease stage was changed from IBC to either T4 non-
inflammatory or any TN2

Results: Primary Efficacy Parameter:  
Event free survival 
Fewer patients in the HER2+TC arm than in the HER2+C arm experienced an EFS event (disease 
progression, recurrence or death): 46 patients (40%) vs 59 patients (51%). The risk of having an EFS 
event was reduced by 35% for HER2-positive patients who received trastuzumab plus chemotherapy 
compared with those who received chemotherapy alone, and this difference was statistically significant 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65; 95% CI [0.44,0.96]; p = 0.0275). 
Summary of event free survival 
Summary of composition of events 
Most of the events reported were disease recurrence (31 pts in HER2+TC, 43 pts in HER2+C) and 
disease progression (11 pts in HER2+TC, 12 pts in HER2+C).  
Of these 74 patients who had disease recurrence, 57 of them had distant disease recurrence (25 pts in 
HER2+TC, 32 pts in HER2+C).  
In the disease progression category, five patients were classified as “other”: 
in the HER2+TC arm, a patient had an edema,in the HER2+C arm, a patient had a cerebral progressive 
disease and  in the HER2-C arm, a patient had metastases to the liver and new axillary  lymph node, 
and two patients had both new lesion and progression of the existing lesion.

Event-Free Survival Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses of patients were performed based on age (≤ 49 yrs vs > 49 yrs; < 65 yrs vs ≥ 65 
yrs), type of breast cancer (non-inflammatory/inflammatory), nodal status (cN = 0 vs cN ≥ 1), 
pathological response and surgery

(FAS) 
Sensitivity analysis EFS: Censoring of data from patients who crossed over  
Of the 20 patients who were originally randomized to the HER2+C arm and subsequently crossed over 
to receive adjuvant trastuzumab, 5 patients experienced an EFS event after cross-over.    
When data from these 19 patients (1 patient of 20 had an EFS event prior to cross-over) were 
censored at the time of their first trastuzumab infusion, the reduction in risk of an EFS event was 41% 
(unadjusted HR 0.59; 95% CI [0.40, 0.88]; p = 0.0084, Log-Rank test). At 3 years, 65% of the 
patients in the HER2+TC arm and 48% of those in the HER2+C arm survived event-free  
Sensitivity analysis EFS: Exclusion of patient data from Site CRTN 47296 
An exploratory analysis of EFS was performed excluding the patients from the site CRTN 47296.  
A high number of patients from this site did not undergo surgery and the complete clinical response 
rate was unusually high for that site. In this analysis, the hazard ratio was the same as for the FAS 
population (HR 0.65; 95% CI [0.42, 1.00]; 0.0467, Log-Rank test) with the confidence interval 
including 1.

Results: Secondary Efficacy Parameters 
Surgery 
A total of 266 patients (80.6% [266/330]) underwent surgery (85.2% [98/115] in HER2+TC, 74.1% 
[86/112] in HER2+C, 82.8% [82/99] in HER2-C). Therefore, 64 patients did not undergo surgery, the 
majority of these patients being from a Russian centre: CRTN 47296; 13 patients in HER2+TC, 15 
patients in HER2+C 
Summary of Surgeries (FAS) 
More patients in the HER2+TC arm underwent surgery than in the HER2+C arm (85.2% vs 74.1%, 
respectively), and more patients in the HER2+TC arm (21.4% [21/98]) had a quadrantectomy, 
lumpectomy or wide excision (less radical procedures than a mastectomy) than patients in the HER2+C 
arm (10.5% [9/86]).  
Fewer patients in the HER2-C arm had a radical mastectomy (12.2%) compared with the two HER2-
positive arms of patients (31.6% HER2+TC and 39.5% HER2+C). 
A high number of patients did not undergo surgery (14.8% [17/115]) in HER2+TC, 25.9% [30/116] in 
HER2+C, 17.2% [17/99] in HER2-C); the majority of patients in the HER2+TC and HER2+C arms not 
undergoing surgery were from one site CRTN 47296 (13 patients in HER2+TC, 15 patients in HER2+C) 
As expected, patients who did not undergo surgery had a worse outcome for EFS than patients who 
underwent surgery, irrespective of the treatment arm (Table 34).  For the HER2-positive patients, a

consistent reduction of the risk of having an EFS event was found for trastuzumab-treated patients 
(estimated HR < 1) who underwent surgery or not.  
In contrast to the EFS result according to surgery or not with all HER2-positive patients, the EFS 
hazard ratio among trastuzumab-treated patients was lower in the subgroup of patients not 
undergoing surgery compared to the subgroup of patients undergoing surgery (HR 0.51 vs 0.72). 
Summary of event-free survival: surgery versus no surgery 
Pathological Complete Response 
Pathological complete response rates were higher in patients with HER2-positive disease receiving 
trastuzumab compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone.  
The pathological complete response rate of the primary tumour (bpCR) was 44.3% vs 26.7%; the 
pathological complete response of the primary tumour and lymph nodes (total pathological response 
[tpCR]) was 40.0% vs 20.7%. The differences in the bpCR and tpCR rates were associated with a p-
value of 0.0051 and 0.0014, respectively. Subgroup analyses of patients were performed based on age 
(≤ 49 yrs vs > 49 yrs), type of breast cancer (non-inflammatory/inflammatory), nodal status (cN = 0 
vs cN ≥ 1), and hormone receptor status and generally confirmed overall results.

Pathological examination of surgical specimens revealed that almost twice as many patients in the 
HER2+TC arm achieved a pathological complete response in breast and axilla (tpCR) and in breast 
(bpCR) compared with the HER2+C arm (tpCR: 40.0% HER2+TC vs. 20.7% HER2+C, p = 0.0014, Chi-
squared test; bpCR: 44.3% HER2+TC vs. 26.7% HER2+C, p = 0.0051, Chi-squared test).

Subgroup analyses of EFS by tpCR response achieved showed that the group of HER2-positive patients 
who had a tpCR on average also had a longer duration of EFS than HER2-positive patients without 
tpCR (HR = 0.43; 95% CI [0.26, 0.72]; p = 0.0010). The analyses of the EFS by bpCR subgroups 
showed similar results. 
Secondary Endpoint – Overall Clinical Response 
The overall clinical response to treatment was determined in all patients who had measurable disease 
at baseline. The proportion of patients with an overall clinical response (complete response and partial 
response) was slightly higher in the HER2+TC arm than in the HER2+C arm.   
However, the 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rates included zero [-6.4%, 
19.1%], p-value 0.3077, indicating no treatment effect. 
Summary of Overall Clinical Response (MO16432 FAS) 
Overall survival 
At the time of the analysis (clinical cut-off March 30, 2009), a total of 55 randomized patients had died 
in the HER2-positive arms: 22 patients (19.1%) in the HER2+TC arm and 33 patients (28.4%) in the 
HER2+C arm.  Twenty-one patients (21.2%) had died in the parallel HER2-C arm. 
Most of the deaths observed were cancer related, with 90.9% (20/22) of deaths in the HER2+TC arm, 
100% (33/33) of deaths in the HER2+C arm and 90.5% (19/21) of deaths in the HER2-C arm due to 
breast cancer progression. 
Three –year overall survival (based on Kaplan-Meier estimates) was 85.0% in the HER2+TC arm 
versus 78.0% in the HER2+C arm (85.0% in HER2-C). The hazard ratio indicates a 41% reduction in 
the risk of death (HR 0.59; 95% CI [0.35, 1.02]; p = 0.0555, Log-Rank test)

An exploratory analysis of OS was performed excluding the patients from the site CRTN 47296. In this 
analysis, the hazard ratio was slightly better (HR = 0.52, 95% CI [0.28, 0.96]) 
As part of the responses to the RSI the applicant provided an update on OS. There are 5 and 8 
additional events in the HER2+TC arm and HER2+C arm, respectively. The hazard ratio for the 
updated overall survival data is 0.58 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.94; p-value of log-rank test: 0.0241),

Summary of the Main Efficacy Results in HER2-Positive Patients 
In the published data, patients had been followed for a median follow-up of 3.2 years, whereas in the 
present CSR analysis, patients had been followed for a median follow-up of 3.8 years in the HER2+TC 
arm, 3.5 years in the HER2+C arm and 4.0 years in the HER2-C arm. 
In order to be able to compare the two analyses, it is important to note that Roche made some 
significant changes to the Statistical Analysis Plan that was used for the publication. The number of 
patients included in the published analysis was slightly different from the number of patients included 
in the CSR analysis. Four patients were excluded from the Roche FAS analysis, two in each HER2-
positive arm due to missing informed consent, one patient in the HER2+C arm for late protocol 
approval and a patient in the HER2+TC arm who was not included in Roche database because she 
withdrew informed consent prior to randomization but was randomized by mistake. 
Key efficacy and safety results of the present analysis are very similar to the published data: in both 
analyses, the addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in a clinically relevant 
and statistically significant improvement in EFS. Improvements were also observed in OS, bpCR and 
tpCR rates.

Supportive studies 
  MDACC Study (Buzdar et al) 
This was a randomised phase III trial investigating the role of trastuzumab when given concurrently 
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel followed by FEC) in patients with operable non-
inflammatory early breast cancer  
The treatment consisted of: four cycles of paclitaxel at 225 mg/m2 as a 24-h infusion at 3-week 
intervals. Patients were then treated with four cycles of FEC therapy, which consisted of 500 mg/m2 
fluorouracil on days 1 and 4, 500 mg/m2 i.v. cyclophosphamide on day 1 only, and 75 mg/m2 
epirubicin on day 1 only. The patients who had been randomized (in the original study) and assigned 
(additional study patients) to receive trastuzumab received 4 mg/kg trastuzumab i.v. over 90 min on 
day 1 of the first cycle of paclitaxel. These patients received 2 mg/kg trastuzumab weekly, 
administered i.v. over 30 min during the 24 weeks of chemotherapy. 
One hundred and sixty-four patients were originally planned to be enrolled, but after only 42 patients 
were enrolled (23 randomised to chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and 19 to chemotherapy alone), the 
data monitoring committee requested an extraordinary interim analysis based on Bayesian principles 
because of the very high pCR rate observed in trastuzumab-treated patients at the time. Of the 
patients with efficacy data available then,26.3% in the chemotherapy alone arm achieved a pCR 
compared with 65.2% in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm. The difference was highly clinically 
relevant. An update to the Bayesian analysis, incorporating results for all 42 patients, indicated a 96% 
probability that the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm would be found superior if accrual were 
continued to 164 patients. Accordingly, recruitment to the chemotherapy alone arm was discontinued, 
and an additional 22 patients were recruited to the chemotherapy plus trastuzumab arm. 
At the end of the study, the pCR rate was 60% in the 45 patients who received trastuzumab plus 
chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 36 months from study entry, the 3-year disease-free survival 
(DFS) rate in the trastuzumab arm was 100% compared to 85% in the control arm (p = 0.041). 
None of the 45 patients treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy experienced clinical cardiac 
dysfunction, and there were no cardiac deaths in the study.  
  GeparQuattro Study 
The GeparQuattro study enrolled 1509 patients with early breast cancer including inflammatory breast 
cancer,  445  of  whom  had  HER2-positive  disease.  Patients  with  HER-2–positive  tumors  received 
trastuzumab 6 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks concomitantly to cytotoxic treatment, starting 
with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV on day 1 of the first EC cycle.  
In this 3-arm trial, HER2-positive patients were randomised to receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab 
concurrently with either 
a) 4 cycles of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel, or  
b) 4 cycles of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel plus concomitant 
capecitabine, or  
c) 4 cycles of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel followed by 4 cycles 
of q3w capecitabine.  
d) HER2-negative patients received chemotherapy without trastuzumab and were used as a reference 
group.  
Pathological complete response (defined as no invasive or in situ residual tumours in the breast) rate 
was 31.7%, compared to 15.7% in the reference group. HER2-positive patients without response to 
the first 4 cycles of EC showed an unexpectedly high pCR rate of 16.6% (3.3% in the reference group). 
Breast conservation rate was 63.1% and comparable to that of the reference group (64.7%). 
Chemotherapy plus trastuzumab was associated with more febrile neutropenia and conjunctivitis, but 
with a comparable short-term cardiac toxicity profile as the reference group. 
  Study WO20697 (NeoSphere) 
NeoSphere is a randomised phase II study in patients with operable (T2-3, N0-1,M0) or locally 
advanced/inflammatory (T4d, any N, M0) HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer who 
have not received prior chemotherapy. A total of 417 patients were randomised to one of 4 
neoadjuvant treatment arms:  
Arm A: trastuzumab and docetaxel (n = 107)

EMA/36190/2012Rev10.11 
Page 26/58
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Arm B: trastuzumab, pertuzumab and docetaxel (n = 107)  
Arm C: trastuzumab and pertuzumab (n = 107)  
Arm D: pertuzumab and docetaxel (n = 96) 
All patients were treated every 3 weeks (q3w) for 4 cycles prior to breast surgery. The primary 
endpoint of the study was pCR. The pCR rate in arm B (45.8%) was significantly greater than that in 
arm A (29.0%; p = 0.0141), which in turn was significantly greater than the pCR rate in arm C 
(16.8%;p = 0.0198). The pCR rate in arm B was also significantly greater than that in arm D (24.0%; 
p = 0.003). An exploratory subset analysis showed that a higher proportion of patients with ER/PgR-
negative tumours had a pCR compared with patients with ER/PgRpositive tumours. The treatments had 
an acceptable safety profile. 
  NeoALTTO Study 
This is an international, multicentre, randomised study comparing the efficacy of lapatinib (L), 
trastuzumab (T), and their combination (L+T), each in combination with paclitaxel, given as  
neoadjuvant treatment in women with HER2-positive operable invasive breast cancer (size of primary 
tumour > 2 cm) The primary endpoint was pCR defined as no invasive or only non-invasive in situ 
cancer in the breast specimen. 
A total of 455 patients were randomised (L: n = 154; T: n = 149; L+T: n = 152). The primary 
objective of the trial was met with a significantly higher pCR rate in the L+T arm compared to the T 
arm (51.3% vs. 29.5%; p = 0.0001), while the pCR rate in the L arm (24.7%) was not statistically 
different from the T arm (29.5%). There were no new safety findings reported in patients receiving 
trastuzumab.  
  GeparQuinto Study 
GeparQuinto is a randomised phase III study comparing trastuzumab versus lapatinib, each in 
combination with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (4 cycles) followed by docetaxel (4 cycles) as 
neoadjuvant therapy for patients with untreated, uni-/bilateral HER2-positive early or locally advanced 
breast cancer  
Trastuzumab was given concurrently with all 8 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (presurgery) and 
for an additional 6 months following after surgery. Lapatinib was given concurrently with 
chemotherapy, followed by trastuzumab for 12 months postsurgery.  
The primary endpoint was pCR defined as no microscopic evidence of residual viable tumour cells (no 
invasive/non-invasive) in any resected specimens of the breast and axillary nodes. A total of 620 
patients were randomised, and 615 were treated (EC-D+T: n = 307;EC-D+L: n = 308). In the EC-D+T 
arm 31.3%  of patients achieved a pCR compared with 21.7% in the EC-D+L arm (p < 0.05). 
Additional analyses using less stringent definitionsfor pathological response showed a more 
pronounced difference between  treatment arms in favour of trastuzumab: 45.0% vs 29.9% (p < 0.05; 
no invasive residual in breast  andnodes) and 50.4% vs 35.2% (p < 0.05; no invasive residual in 
breast alone). A predefined  subgroup analysis showed odds ratios below zero for all subtypes/strata 
(ER/PgR±, T1-3and N0-2, T4  or N3) favouring EC-D+T over EC-D+L. No new safety signals were 
reported, including cardiac safety. 
  TECHNO Study 
The Taxol Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide Herceptin NeOadjuvant (TECHNO) study investigated the 
efficacy and safety of 4 cycles of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of 
paclitaxel/trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer 
. Eighty-four of 217 enrolled patients (39%) achieved a pCR (defined as no invasive tumour in the 
breast and in axillary nodes), and breast-conserving surgery was performed in 64% of patients. The 
OSrate in patients achieving a pCR was 96.3% (3 deaths in 84 patients) compared to 85.0%  
(20 deaths in 133 patients) in patients without pCR (log-rank test p-value = 0.0074). The DFS rate at 
3  years was superior in patients with a pCR compared with patients without a pCR (88% vs 73%,  
respectively; p = 0.01). In addition, the rate of 3-year overall survival was greater in patients with a  
pCR than in patients without a pCR (96%vs 86%, respectively; p = 0.025). In a multivariate analysis,  
pCR was a significantprognostic factor for DFS (HR = 2.5; 95% CI [1.2,5.1]; p = 0.013) and OS (HR =  
4.9;95% CI [1.4,17.4]; p = 0.012).  
Six patients (2.8%) had an LVEF dec rease and two (0.9%) developed clinical congestiveheart failure.

Supporting Her2+ studies: Comparison of pCR rates 
1.3.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data in this submission are mainly derived from one pivotal phase III study, MO16432 
(NOAH), investigating the clinical benefit of neoadjuvant-adjuvant trastuzumab (T) in combination with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER2+ locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer.  
The applicant has provided the requested sensitivity analyses to address methodological issues of the 
study as part of the responses. The results of these analyses do not raise any concerns of bias in favor 
of the treatment arm. 
The chemotherapy regimen used in the NOAH trial is questionable as it was acceptable ten years ago 
but since then clinical practice has changed with taxane- and anthracycline-containing chemotherapies 
considered standard treatment in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant EBC setting . Cyclophosphamide 
and/or fluorouracil are now being combined with the anthracycline, reducing the number of cycles to 
only 8 instead of 10 as used in study MO16432 (St Gallen international expert consensus on the 
primary therapy of early breast cancer 2009.). Furthermore, additional CMF chemotherapy is no longer 
recommended. 
However, several supportive studies which showed efficacy regarding pathological complete response, 
employed regimens which are in line with current guidelines, i.e. employing  treatment regimens 
containing a taxane plus anthracycline combined with cyclophosphamide +/-fluorouracil for a total of 8 
(and not 10) cycles.  
In the pivotal trial, significant reduction in the risk of obtaining an event of 35% (unadjusted HR 0.65; 
95% CI [0.44, 0.96]; p = 0.0275, Log-Rank test) was observed for the entire population (FAS), even 
though 20/116=17% of patients in the control arm crossed over to treatment with trastuzumab after 
positive results of treatment with Herceptin in the adjuvant setting were known. 
In a sensitivity analysis, in which patients who crossed over to adjuvant trastuzumab were censored at 
the time of their first trastuzumab infusion, the resulting EFS hazard ratio was slightly better than in 
the primary analysis (unadjusted HR 0.59; 95% CI [0.40, 0.88]; p = 0.0084, Log-Rank test). 
Results of subgroup analyses of EFS were generally consistent with those in the full analysis set. The 
only subgroup in which a benefit could not be shown was the group of patients ≤ 49 years of age, 
which may be due to the smaller patient numbers in the analysis or a chance event.

DFS is acceptable as a primary efficacy endpoint for registration trials, particularly in situations such as 
EBC where further lines of treatment following relapse may hamper the detection of a relevant 
treatment effect on OS. As an example, in the HERA trial, DFS was the primary endpoint.  However, 
the primary endpoint of EFS should be supported by secondary efficacy endpoints of pCR, ORR and OS 
(Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Med. Products in Man;CPMP/EWP/205/95/Rev3/Corr) to 
provide validity and clinical relevance to the primary endpoint.   
Supportive evidence of clinical efficacy in this trial comes from pCR and OS data. Pathological 
examination of surgical specimens revealed that almost twice as many patients in the HER2+TC arm 
achieved a pathological complete response in breast and axilla (tpCR) and in breast (bpCR) compared 
with the HER2+C arm (tpCR: 40.0% HER2+TC vs. 20.7% HER2+C, p = 0.0014, Chi-squared test and 
bpCR: 44.3% HER2+TC vs. 26.7% HER2+C, p = 0.0051, Chi-squared test). Since pCR rate is widely 
regarded as a short term efficacy parameter which is highly correlated with EFS and OS, these data are 
reassuring. 
The strongest evidence of benefit is provided by OS results.  While the difference did not quite achieve 
statistical  significance  in  the  whole  population,  it  did  when  the  centre  CRTN  47296  (for  which  issues 
were raised) was excluded with a hazard ratio of 0.52 (p = 0.034). Median survival time could not yet 
be estimated for patients in any of the arms due to the long survival duration of patients in the trial. 
This  is  not  unexpected,  since  EBC  is  either  curable  or  a  disease  with  a long  time  course.  An  updated 
survival analysis provided as part of the responses confirmed the observed trend for OS 0.58 (95% CI: 
0.35, 0.94; p-value of log-rank test: 0.0241) 
Trials in the adjuvant setting have shown an overall  survival benefit with the addition of one year of 
trastuzumab to chemotherapy (Smith I, et al  2007) which could not be shown in this trial.  
Results obtained for ORR and also frequency/ type of surgery are somewhat peculiar with atypically 
high overall response rates and high numbers of patients not undergoing surgery which casts doubt on 
the validity of the data. However, reanalysis of the study data excluding the specific centre mostly 
responsible for these unexpected findings (ORR, surgery) with regard to the primary efficacy 
parameter, EFS, reconfirmed the study results and added robustness (HR 0.65; 95% CI [0.42, 1.00]; 
p= 0.0467, Log-Rank test). 
Interestingly -though not a secondary endpoint-, twice as many patients had breast conserving 
surgery in the trastuzumab arm than in the chemo only arm (21.4% versus 10.5%). 
Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant treatment was not compared with adjuvant treatment alone. Therefore, it 
cannot be concluded that the neoadjuvant component of trastuzumab treatment led to the 
improvement in event-free survival. In the product information it is reflected that the combination of 
one year of neoadjuvant-adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab led to the observed results. 
The MAH provided additional supportive information to justify a broad therapeutic indication (ie, early 
as well as locally advanced breast cancer and inflammatory breast cancer) and the addition of 
trastuzumab to a broad range of neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens (ie, current standard of care 
regimens, not just that employed in study MO16432).  Thus, the relevance of supportive data from 
published trials was significant to the submission. 
Supportive data are provided from six published randomized phase II or III studies of trastuzumab in 
the neoadjuvant setting. The additional supportive studies demonstrate that trastuzumab may be 
combined with different regimens in the neo-adjuvant/adjuvant setting and that combination therapy 
with trastuzumab leads to improved and consistent pCR rates.  The supportive data provide also a 
positive correlation of the pathological response with DFS and OS and support the use of neoadjuvant 
trastuzumab in various disease stages with various chemotherapy regimens. 
A consequence of the approval of the indicaton in the neoadjuvant indication would be the possibility of 
a continuum of treatment with Herceptin from beginning of diagnosis of early breast cancer until after 
progression of disease, with both indications being covered in the updated SmPC.   
2. 3. 5. Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The pivotal trial met its primary endpoint of EFS (including both pre- and postoperative events), with a 
hazard ratio of 0.65 (p = 0.0275); this was essentially due to lower recurrence rates.

A  compelling  effect  of  trastuzumab  was  observed  on  pathological  response  which  was  reflected  in  a 
doubling  of  operations  with  more  breast-conservative  surgery  (21%  vs.  10%),  but  the  strongest 
evidence  of  benefit  was  provided  by  OS  results,  which  -after  the  exploratory  analyses  requested  to 
resolve  methodological  issues,-  achieved  a  statistical  significance  with  a  hazard  ratio  of  0.52  (p  = 
0.034). 
In summary, the combined evidence of the supportive studies plus the NOAH trial support the general 
use of neoadjuvant-adjuvant trastuzumab in combination with clinically proven neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy regimens for HER2-positive breast cancer.  
1.4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
In study MO16432, 115 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were exposed to trastuzumab (6 
mg/kg every three weeks, three weeks after an initial 8 mg/kg loading dose) in combination with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
In the MDACC study, 45 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer received trastuzumab (2 mg/kg 
every week, after an initial 4 mg/kg loading dose) in combination with chemotherapy. 
In the GeparQuattro study, 443 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer received trastuzumab (6 
mg/kg every three weeks, three weeks after an initial 8 mg/kg loading Herceptin (trastuzumab)  
concomitantly to all chemotherapy cycles: 
In the MO16432 and GeparQuattro studies, trastuzumab treatment was continued after surgery as 
adjuvant therapy for a total treatment duration of 1 year. Additionally, patients with HER2-positive 
disease randomized to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone in study MO16432 were offered one 
year of post-operative adjuvant trastuzumab (protocol MO16432 amendment D). 
The safety data presented here focuses primarily on study MO16432 and are supported by data from 
the two supportive publications where feasible and appropriate. 
1.4.1.  Clinical safety Results (NOAH trial)  
All patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had documented informed consent 
and documented approval of protocol amendments were included in the safety analysis population 
(SAP) for the analysis of all assessments prior to and including surgery. Treatment arms were defined 
by the actual study medication received prior to surgery.  
The SAP comprised 326 patients (HER2+TC: 115 patients; HER2+C: 112 patients; HER2–C: 99 
patients). 
SAP-P: A second safety population was defined for the safety analyses of assessments/events after 
surgery: all patients in the SAP who had at least one safety assessment after surgery, or who did not 
undergo surgery but had at least one safety assessment starting more than 28 days after the last dose 
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or after the first dose of adjuvant trastuzumab, were included in the 
post-surgery safety analysis population (SAP-P).  
Forty-seven patients from the SAP were excluded from the SAP-P as they had no safety assessment 
after surgery (3 patients in the HER2+TC arm, 24 patients in the HER2+C arm, and 20 patients in the 
HER2–C arm). Twenty patients in the HER2+C arm crossed over to receive adjuvant trastuzumab and 
were analyzed separately as a fourth treatment group (HER2+C ->T). The SAP-P comprised 279 
patients (HER2+TC: 112 patients; HER2+C->T: 20 patients; HER2+C: 68 patients; HER2–C: 79 
patients).

At the time of the clinical cut-off, the median duration of overall follow-up for the SAP was 45.9 
months (range 2.1-76.8 months) in the HER2+TC arm, 42.55 months (range 2.1-77.5 months) in the 
HER2+C and 48.13 months (range 0.9-75.5 months) in the HER2-C arm 
Extent of exposure 
The number of patients in the full analysis set who received at least one dose of study medication was 
115 in the HER2+TC arm, 112 in the HER2+C arm, and 99 in the HER2–C arm. 
Exposure to Trastuzumab:  
All patients treated with trastuzumab received at least two cycles. The median number of cycles 
administered to HER2+TC patients was 16 out of a planned number of 17. The median number of 
trastuzumab cycles administered during the pre-operative period was 11 (range 2-11), ie, the planned 
number of cycles. 
The 20 patients who crossed over to receive adjuvant trastuzumab received a median of 17 
trastuzumab infusions (range 11-18).

A large proportion of patients across the 3 treatment arms received the planned number of 10 cycles 
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy; 3 cycles of doxorubicin and paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles of paclitaxel 
alone followed by 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (110/115 HER2+TC 
patients [95.7%], 103/116 HER2+C patients [88.8%], 84/99 HER2–C patients [84.8%]). Although 
dose delays were relatively common (reported in up to 41% of patients per treatment), the majority of 
patients received the planned doses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (dose adjustments of ≥ 10% were 
required in < 7% of patients per treatment across treatment arms).  
The mean and median cumulative doses for each chemotherapy drug were the same or very similar 
across treatment arms, as was the frequency of dose delays. This indicates that chemotherapy dose 
intensity was similar with or without trastuzumab. 
Exposure to Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel 
More than 98% of patients across the treatment arms received the three cycles of doxorubicin and 
paclitaxel as planned. Exposure was similar in the three groups of patients, as indicated by the median 
cumulative dose of doxorubicin (306-312 mg), and paclitaxel (774-780 mg). 
Exposure to Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel during  the Pre-Operative Period (All Cycles, SAP) 
Exposure to Paclitaxel Alone 
More than 96% of patients across the treatment arms received the four cycles of paclitaxel alone as 
planned. Exposure was similar in the three groups of patients, as indicated by similarities in the

median cumulative dose of paclitaxel (1200 mg). However, one patient in the HER2+TC arm, 2 
patients, in the HER2+C arm and 4 patients in the HER2-C arm (based on the SAP) did not receive at 
least one cycle of paclitaxel alone. 
Exposure to Paclitaxel Alone during the Pre-Operative Period (All Cycles, SAP) 
Exposure to Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate and Fluorouracil 
Two patients in the HER2+TC arm, 8 patients in the HER2+C arm and 9 patients in the HER2-C arm 
(based on the SAP) did not receive at least one cycle of CMF. Of patients who received at least one 
cycle of CMF, more than 93% across the treatment arms received the 3 cycles of CMF as planned. 
Exposure was similar in the three groups of patients, as indicated by the median cumulative dose of 
cyclophosphamide (6120-6198 mg), methotrexate (414-420 mg) and fluorouracil (6102-6162 mg).

Overview of all grade adverse events by body system 
Pre-operative period 
During the pre-operative period, almost all patients experienced at least one treatment emergent 
adverse event (HER2+TC: 113 patients, 98.3%; HER2+C: 112 patients, 100%; HER2–C: 98 patients, 
99.0%). However, the majority of events across all three treatment arms were Grade 1/2 in severity

The most common AEs (in at least 50% of patients) by system organ class were as follows: 
• Gastrointestinal disorders (HER2+TC: 92.2%; HER2+C: 88.4%; HER2–C: 80.8%): 
nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and constipation. 
• Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (HER2+TC: 92.2%; HER2+C: 90.2%; HER2–C: 91.9%): 
alopecia, and nail disorder.

• General disorders and administration site conditions (HER2+TC: 75.7%; HER2+C: 69.6%; 
HER2–C: 52.5%): asthenia, influenza-like illness, pyrexia, fatigue, and mucosal inflammation. 
• Nervous system disorders (HER2+TC: 73.0%; HER2+C: 75.9%; HER2–C: 68.7%): peripheral 
neuropathy, paresthesia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, dysgeusia, and headache. 
• Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (HER2+TC: 67.0%; HER2+C: 50.0%; HER2–
C: 58.6%): myalgia, arthralgia, bone pain, and pain in extremity. 
Adverse events which occurred with ≥ 5% higher incidence in the HER2+TC arm compared 
with the HER2+C arm included  
conjunctivitis (29.6% vs 19.6%)  
myalgia (27.8% vs 22.3%) 
pyrexia (20.0% vs 11.6%) 
hot flush (13.0% vs 5.4%) 
rhinorrhea (18.3% vs 8.0%)  
epistaxis (13.9% vs 1.8%)  
lacrimation increase (13.0% vs 4.5%)  
cough (10.4% vs 2.7%)  
pharyngitis (6.1% vs 0.9%) and  
rhinitis (6.1% vs 0.9%).  
The higher incidence of events in the SOC investigations for patients in the HER2+TC arm compared 
with the HER2+C arm (16.5% vs 8.0%) was contributed to by higher incidences of increased weight 
(5.2% vs 2.7%), increased ALT (2.6% vs 1.8%), increased AST (2.6% vs 0.9%), and increased heart 
rate (2.6% vs 0.9%)  
Among blood and lymphatic system disorders, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was slightly higher 
among patients in the HER2+TC arm (7.0%) compared with the HER2+C arm (3.6%).  
Importantly, the incidence of AEs in the SOC cardiac disorders was similar in the two groups of 
patients with HER2+ disease (12.2% vs 13.4%)  
Post-operative period 
More adverse events were reported for patients in the HER2+TC and HER2+C→T arms compared with 
the HER2+C and HER2–C arms during the post-operative period (HER2+TC: 76/112 patients, 67.9%; 
HER2+C→T: 17/20 patients, 85%; HER2+C: 34/68 patients, 50%; HER2–C: 40/79 patients, 50.6%) 
The majority of adverse events reported during the post-operative period were Grade 1/2 in severity 
(HER2+TC: 259/286 events, 90.5%; HER2+C→T: 85/87 events, 97.7%; HER2+C: 70/78 events, 
89.7%; HER2-C: 58/73 events, 79.5%) 
There was one fatal adverse event in a patient in the HER2-negative parallel control arm and there 
were no fatal cardiac events.

Grade 3 and 4 Adverse Events 
During the pre-operative period, the proportion of patients reporting Grade 3 or 4 AEs was relatively 
similar across the treatment arms (HER2+TC: 39.1%; HER2+C: 41.1%; HER2–C: 34.3%).

The most common Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported (≥10% in at least one treatment arm) were in the 
system organ classes skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (HER2+TC: 15.7%; HER2+C: 11.6%; 
HER2–C: 3.0%), reproductive system and breast disorders (HER2+TC: 9.6%; HER2+C: 8.9%; HER2–
C: 16.2%), and gastrointestinal disorders (HER2+TC: 3.5%; HER2+C: 11.6%; HER2–C: 5.1%).  
Treatment-emergent adverse events with a Grade 4 intensity were infrequent. 
In the HER2+TC arm, Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was experienced by two patients (1.7%; pts 
32078/003, 32086/020) 
In the HER2+C arm, 5.4% of patients (6/112) had at least one Grade 4 event: 
febrile neutropenia (pt 32057/008) 
neutropenia (pts 32074/022, 33810/001) 
nausea and vomiting (pt 32065/021) 
pyrexia (pt 32059/004) and back pain(pt 32065/004).  
In the HER2-C arm, 5.1% (5/99) of patients experienced a Grade 4 event: 
febrile neutropenia (pts 33810/005, 32057/007),  
neutropenia (pt 33809/001),  
stomatitis(pt 32062/004) and pulmonary embolism (pt 32086/009). 
Grade 3 AEs were reported in 43 patients (37.4%) in the HER2+TC arm, 44 patients (39.3%) in the 
HER2+C arm, and 32 patients (32.3%) in the HER2–C arm.

Summary of MedDRA Terms Suggestive of Infusion-Related Reactions 
Of these potential infusion-related reactions, all are considered to be listed adverse reactions for 
trastuzumab. There was no increase in frequency and there were no unexpected outcomes.  
Cardiac Safety 
Pre-operative period,  
Thirty-four patients experienced 53 cardiac adverse events (13.9% [16/115] pts with 27 AEs in 
HER2+TC, 13.4% [15/112] pts with 21 AEs in HER2+C, 3.0% [3/99] pts with 5 AEs in HER2-C) . The 
incidence was similar in the two HER2-positive arms (13.9% of patients in HER2+TC vs 13.4% in 
HER2+). 
Reported cardiac adverse events in at least 2 patients (cardiac disorders SOC) were as follows:  angina 
pectoris (5 patients in each of the HER2-positive arms) tachycardia (5 patients in each of the HER2-
positive arms and 1 patient in the HER2-negative arm) and  palpitations (3 patients in each of the 
HER2-positive arms and 1 patient in the HER2-negative arm)  
None of these cardiac events were reported as Grade 3 or 4 AEs  or as an SAE.   
The myocardial ischemia in the HER2+TC arm was of Grade 2 intensity at worst and recovered on the 
same day without sequelae. 
In the SOC investigations, two HER2+TC patients, had a decrease of ejection fraction. One patient had 
a Grade 3 decrease of ejection fraction which was also reported as an SAE. Approximately 8 weeks 
after starting treatment this 64-year old patient’s LVEF decreased to 42% (from 65% at baseline) and 
she was withdrawn from the study. Her cardiac decompensation then recovered with Captopril 
treatment.

Treatment-Emergent Cardiac Events in the Pre-Operative Period (SAP) 
During the post-operative period 
Sixteen patients experienced 22 cardiac adverse events (8.9% [10/112] pts with 15 AEs in HER2+TC, 
10.0% [2/20] pts with 2 AEs in HER2+C→T, 5.9% [4/68] pts with 5 AEs in HER2+C).  
In the HER2+C arm, patient 32065/013 experienced a Grade 3 pericardial effusion and in the 
HER2+TC arm, a patient had a Grade 3 decreased ejection fraction considered related to study 
medication and reported as an SAE . Two days after completing her 1-year course of trastuzumab, this 
59-year old patient experienced pneumonia. This resolved after 13 days. Seven days after onset her 
LVEF decreased to 42% from 56% at baseline. With treatment her LVEF began to increase (following 
an initial decrease to 30% recorded 4 months later) and the last known measurement was 53% 
(recorded approximately 2 years after onset). 
A Grade 1 restrictive cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in a patient from the HER2+TC arm. The LVEF 
value at the time of diagnosis was 45%. This patient received 17 cycles of trastuzumab with a 
cumulative dose of 3724 mg. The diagnosis was made 9 months after the last dose of trastuzumab had 
been administered. At subsequent visits, the patient was not reported to have any significant cardiac 
disease, but no LVEF values are available. Thirty-four months after the diagnosis of the Grade 1 
restrictive cardiomyopathy, and 43 months after the last trastuzumab dose, the patient experienced a 
fatal myocardial infarction. The patient had several cardiovascular risk factors (smoker, hyperlipidemia, 
insulin-dependent diabetes).

Treatment-Emergent Cardiac Events in the Post-Operative Period (SAP) 
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction 
At study entry, a LVEF value of 55% or more (measured by ECHO or MUGA) was required after 
amendment B. At baseline, the median LVEF value was 63% (range 55-82) in the HER2+TC arm, 63% 
(range 55-89) in the HER2+C arm and 63% (range 56-78) in the HER2-C arm.

As expected, more patients in the HER2+TC arm had a decline in LVEF during the chemotherapy 
period, compared with patients in the other two arms who did not receive trastuzumab.  
Overall, only 13.3% of patients in the HER2+TC arm showed no change or an increase in LVEF during 
chemotherapy, compared with 27.5% of patients in the HER2+C arm and 20.8% in the HER2-C arm. 
Most of the declines in LVEF were < 10% points compared with baseline.  
However,  combination  therapy  with  trastuzumab  led  to  a  significantly  higher  number  of  patients  with 
significant LEVF decrease (defined as decline of > 10 points from baseline and decrease to < 50%) in 
the HER2+TC arm (5/113=4,4%) preoperatively and also postoperatively (5/90=5,6%) 
Pre-operative period  
Four (4) patients in the HER2+TC arm had a decline in LVEF of ≥ 10% points to an LVEF of < 50%  
versus one in the HER2+C arm and none in the HER2-C arm and in one patient in the HER2+TC arm 
the LVEF declined to < 45%  
Declines in LVEF were seen during each stage of chemotherapy (doxorubicin + paclitaxel, paclitaxel 
alone and CMF) with no marked difference in incidence (in any of the treatment arms) between these 
periods. 
Post operative period 
After surgery, 4 patients in the HER2+TC arm had a decline in LVEF of ≥ 10% points to an LVEF of < 
50%, and in one of the patients did the LVEF decline to < 45%. No such declines were observed in the 
control groups. 
One patient had the decline in LVEF during the pre- and post-operative period. 
In the postoperative combination therapy arm, two patients had a Grade 3 decreased ejection fraction 
considered related to study medication and reported as an SAE, months later she developed 
pneumonia and also a decrease in LVEF which resolved upon therapy.  One patient is already listed 
above as one of those with LVEF decreases, however another patient listed as having the grade 3 
event needs to be added, bringing the total up to six. 
The MAH states that LVEF values improved again over time in all three treatment arms and presents 
data at 24- months follow-up, the median LVEF values were similar across the three treatment arms: 
60% (range 40–78) in the HER2+TC arm, 61% (range 50–71) in the HER2+C arm, and 59% (range 
51–72) in the HER2–C arm. 
Deaths 
At the time of clinical data cut-off, 76 patients had died. The main cause of death was disease 
progression in all 3 treatment arms:  
20 patients (17.2% [20/116]) in the HER2+TC arm,  
33 patients (28.0% [33/118]) in the HER2+C arm, and  
19 patients (19.2% [19/99]) in the HER2-C arm 
In the HER2-C arm, patient 33810/007 died of a Grade 4 thromboembolism of the lung arteria (a 
surgical complication) that was reported as an SAE  
In the HER2+TC arm, one patient died of ‘other’ cause: cardiac infarction. This patient had a fatal 
myocardial infarction 34 months after being diagnosed with a Grade 1 restrictive cardiomyopathy, and 
43 months after the last trastuzumab dose. These deaths were not reported as AEs or SAEs because 
they all occurred after the mandatory AE/SAE reporting period (up to 4 weeks after the last dose of 
study medication for AEs/SAEs regardless of causality, thereafter only SAEs considered related to 
study medication were reported). No treatment-related deaths were reported in the study.

Summary of the Main Safety Results in HER2-Positive Patients During Pre-Operative Period 
Overall, the safety results from the published and CSR data were similar. 
It has to be noted that the published results were only based on the events occurring during the pre-
operative phase. During the pre-operative period, 13 cases of Grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia were 
reported by Roche monitoring (7 in the HER2+TC arm, 3 in the HER2+C arm and 3 in the HER2-C arm) 
compared with 6 cases by Michelangelo (2 in each arm). 
1.4.2.   Clinical safety data from supportive trials 
The MDACC study is of interest since trastuzumab was administered in the weekly trastuzumab 
posology. 
In the MDACC study, there were no new safety concerns observed among patients treated 
concomitantly with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. No clinical cardiac dysfunction was reported under 
neoadjuvant treatment.  
In the GeparQuattro study, the combined use of chemotherapy and trastuzumab as neoadjuvant 
treatment did not lead to a clinically relevant increase in toxic events. The short-term cardiac toxicity 
profile was comparable across the two treatment groups. 
1.4.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
MO16432 is the only MAH-sponsored study investigating the safety of concurrent trastuzumab and an 
anthracycline in patients not pretreated with anthracyclines and allows comparison of the cardiac 
safety of concurrent administration of trastuzumab and chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in HER2-
positive and negative patients.

Overall, there were no new or unexpected safety findings when patients with LABC were treated with 
trastuzumab in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Almost all patients experienced at least 
one AE but the majority of patients experienced only Grade 1/2 AEs.  
The addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant doxorubicin, paclitaxel and CMF was well-tolerated and the 
proportion of trastuzumab-treated patients who discontinued neoadjuvant therapy due to an AE was 
similar to that in the patients with HER2-positive disease treated with chemotherapy alone (0.9% 
discontinuations in each HER2-positive arm). The incidence of all grade AEs (98.3% HER2+TC vs 
100.0% HER2+C), Grade 3 AEs (37.4% vs 39.3%) and Grade 4 AEs (1.7% vs 5.4%), and SAEs 
(10.4% vs 7.1%) was also similar in HER2-positive patients treated with and without trastuzumab, 
during the neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) part of the trial 
The following specific AEs (preferred terms) were reported in at least 5% more patients in the 
HER2+TC arm than the HER2+C arm during the neoadjuvant part of the trial: increased lacrimation, 
conjunctivitis, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia, pyrexia, myalgia, cough, 
pharyngitis, rhinitis and hot flush. Conjunctivitis and hot flush are now added to the SmPC. 
The incidence and severity of trastuzumab infusion-related events were within the expected 
frequencies and severities during the neoadjuvant part of the trial. No serious infusion-reactions 
occurred.  
There were no new or unexpected safety findings during post-operative monotherapy with 
trastuzumab.  
Cardiac safety showed no unexpected results.  Despite concurrent administration of trastuzumab with 
doxorubicin, the incidence of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction was low in the HER2+TC arm. The 
incidence of cardiac AEs was similar in the preoperative period for the two HER2-positive arms; 13.9% 
of patients in HER2+TC vs 13.4% in HER2+. None of these cardiac events were reported as Grade 3 or 
4 AEs or as an SAE. The number of patients and AEs during the postoperative period were about the 
same (8.9% pts with 15 AEs in HER2+TC, 10.0% pts with 2 AEs in HER2+C→T) 
Combination therapy with trastuzumab led to a significantly higher number of patients with significant 
LVEF  decrease  (defined  as  decline  of  >  10  points  from  baseline  and  decrease  to  <  50%  or  grade  3 
decreased ejection fraction) in the HER2+TC arm (5/113=4,4% versus 1/112= 1%) preoperatively and 
also postoperatively (5/90=5,5% versus none) 
An increase in the absolute magnitude of significant drops in LVEF could be observed in the pre- and 
postoperative period of patients treated with trastuzumab and long term follow up data should be 
submitted for all affected patients.  
An attempt to compare these results with those obtained in early breast cancer in the adjuvant setting, 
where trastuzumab was administered after completion of anthracycline therapy, indicates that less 
patients suffer from significant drops in LVEF when the anthracycline is administered at the reduced 
dose together with trastuzumab. However, in view of the narratives provided, it may be questioned 
whether regular LVEF measurements were indeed performed, and in any case, no long-term follow-up 
was planned in the protocol.  Therefore, the data collected in this small trial and in the available 
literature are not considered sufficient to establish the safety profile of the concomitant administration 
of trastuzumab with an anthracycline. However, with the proposed restrictions based on the supporting 
trials, an opening to concomitant administration of trastuzumab and anthracyclines is acceptable, 
The MAH has evaluated the possibility of extending the OHERA (BO20652) trial by re-opening the 
recruitment to include patients with neoadjuvant therapy and concludes that this would not be an 
appropriate approach for evaluating cardiac safety in the neoadjuvant setting as this would either not 
be feasible or would result in very low recruitment. 
This assessment has been made based upon actual recruitment rates in neoadjuvant studies including 
the HannaH study (BO22227), which enrolled HER2+ patients with clinical stage I to III early breast 
cancer, including inflammatory disease.  Even with wider eligibility as compared to the proposed label 
(i.e. including tumors > 1cm), the maximum recruitment rate was 500 patients per year. Recruitment 
into an observational study in the proposed label population would be considerably lower, and is 
estimated at a maximum of 300 patients per year.   
Furthermore, an observational study (as opposed to a clinical trial) may have several disadvantages 
when addressing this type of specific cardiac monitoring question, as compliance with reporting of

cardiac events (treatment information, date of event resolution)  may not been optimal. Most 
importantly, it is not possible to obtain complete information on LVEF measurements in an 
observational study as these assessments are not performed as rigorously in a clinical practice setting 
as in a clinical trial.  
In conclusion, it was considered that an observational study, whether re-opening enrollment in the 
OHERA trial or a new study, would not be an adequate instrument to collect more data on  the cardiac 
safety of  Herceptin given concurrently with low-dose anthracyclines in the neoadjuvant setting 
Such data will be available from the HannaH study. In this study, a total of 595 patients have been 
treated with neoadjuvant-adjuvant Herceptin (either the IV or the new subcutaneous formulation for a 
total duration of 1 year) concurrently with epirubicin (4 cycles of 75mg/m2). LVEF and cardiac event 
data have been collected. Three-year follow-up data is anticipated to be available in Q 3 2014 and 
analysis results will subsequently be provided to CHMP.  
Conclusion on Clinical Safety 
No unexpected new safety signals during treatment with neoadjuvant trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 
or adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab alone were observed. 
Cautionary wording regarding cardiac safety has been implemented in the Product Information. To 
highlight the need of cardiac assessments in patients with early breast cancer, at baseline, and every 3 
months during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months 
from the last administration of Herceptin. In patients who receive anthracycline containing 
chemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur yearly up to 5 years from the last 
administration of Herceptin, or longer if a continuous decrease of LVEF is observed. Details on 
cardiological assessment and management of patients in whom there are cardiovascular concerns 
following baseline screening is included.  
In the SPC section 4.4 it is also stated that the safety of continuation or resumption of Herceptin in 
patients who experience cardiotoxicity has not been prospectively studied. However, most patients 
who developed heart failure in the pivotal (H0648g, H0649g, M77001, BO16216, BO16348, BO18255, 
NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, BCIRG 006, MO16432) trials improved with standard medical treatment. 
This included diuretics, cardiac glycosides, beta-blockers and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors. The majority of patients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of 
Herceptin treatment continued on therapy without additional clinical cardiac events. 
Further cardiac safety follow-up data in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting especially with regard to 
concomitant use of Herceptin with low dose anthracyclines can be available from the HannaH study, a 
detailed proposal on this will be included in the next RMP to be submitted 2nd March 2012. In this study, 
a total of 595 patients have been treated with neoadjuvant-adjuvant Herceptin (either the IV or the 
new subcutaneous formulation for a total duration of 1 year) concurrently with epirubicin (4 cycles of 
75mg/m2). LVEF and cardiac event data have been collected. Three-year follow-up data is anticipated 
to be available in Q 3 2014 and analysis results will subsequently be provided to CHMP. The current 
product information contains a statement that Herceptin and anthracyclines should not be given 
concurrently in combination in the adjuvant treatment setting and in patients with early breast cancer 
eligible for neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment, Herceptin should only be used concurrently with 
anthracyclines in chemotherapy-naive patients and only with low-dose anthracycline regimens 
(maximum cumulative doses: doxorubicin 180 mg/m2 or epirubicin 360 mg/m2). 
.  
Additionally, in the SPC section 4.8 conjuctivitis and hot flush were added to the table of adverse 
reactions per System- organ- class, where as the frequencies of the adverse drug events of lacrimation, 
cough, epistaxis and rhinorrhoea were upgraded from “common” to “very common”. 
1.5.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan within this variation procedure which included a 
risk minimisation plan. 
Based on the safety conclusions, the CHMP requested the submission of an updated Risk Management 
Plan which included a risk minimisation plan within this procedure.

Method 
Section 
4.2 
Administration 
Trastuzumab is administered as a 90-
minute  intravenous  infusion.  Patients 
should  be  observed  for  at  least  six 
hours  after  the  start  of  the  first 
infusion  and  for  two  hours  after  the 
start  of  the  subsequent  infusions  for 
symptoms  like  fever  and  chills  or 
other infusion-related symptoms (see 
4.4  and  4.8).  Interruption  of  the 
infusion  may  help  control  such 
symptoms.  The 
infusion  may  be 
resumed when symptoms abate. 
If  the  initial  loading  dose  was  well 
tolerated,  the  subsequent  doses  can 
be  administered  as  a  30-minute 
infusion.  Emergency  equipment  must 
be available.

whether Herceptin® can affect 
reproductive capacity. As animal 
reproduction studies are not always 
predictive of human response, 
Herceptin® should be avoided during 
pregnancy unless the potential 
benefit for the mother outweighs the 
potential risk to the foetus.  
In the post-marketing setting, cases 
of oligohydramnios, some associated 
with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of 
the foetus, have been reported in 
pregnant women receiving 
Herceptin®. Women of childbearing 
potential should be advised to use 
effective contraception during 
treatment with Herceptin® and for at 
least 6 months after treatment has 
concluded. Women who become 
pregnant should be advised of the 
possibility of harm to the foetus. If a 
pregnant woman is treated with 
Herceptin®, close monitoring by a 
multidisciplinary team is desirable.

Description 
Due date 
in the next RMP to be submitted 2nd March 2012.  
This pharmacovigilance activity is in addition to those already requested. 
In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should take the following minor points into 
consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted : 
 
 
The MAH has amended section 1.4.1 as requested.  Section 1.4.2 includes actual post-
authorisation usage data based on experience in the USA but no information has been provided 
on the actual post-authorisation usage in Europe.   The MAH should provide a breakdown of 
usage by indication and country in the EU and include this in the next update to the RMP. 
The objective of study ML20529 in Table 83 should be updated to be consistent with the title of 
the protocol “A prospective, randomized, pharmacological intervention study; evaluating the 
effect of the angiotensin II-receptor (AT1) blocker candesartan versus placebo in prevention of 
trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity in patients with primary breast cancer treated with 
trastuzumab.”  This minor change should be implemented in the next update to the RMP. 
 
In the new version of the RMP, table 58 is not completely readable; the right part of the table 
is not printed on the page. This should be solved with the next update of the RMP. 
The MAH is requested to submit an RMP by 2nd March 2012 in order to properly reflect the safety 
profile of the product and the following important safety concerns:  
 
Long term cardiac safety evaluation – detailed plan (see above) 
1.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed to update sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect the change in the 
indication.  The  PL  has  been  updated  accordingly.    Finally,  Annex  II  has  been  updated  in  order  to 
include the new version number of the Risk Management Plan. 
The CHMP agreed with the proposed changes. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Neoadjuvant-adjuvant trastuzumab in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy has a statistically 
significant and clinically relevant effect on event free survival, defined as recurrence, progression or 
death, in HER2-positive early breast cancer patients.  In addition, pathological complete response in 
breast and axilla (tpCR) and in breast (bpCR) doubled under trastuzumab therapy compared with the 
HER2+C arm and a clinically relevant improvement in overall survival was observed, even though 
results were not statistically significant at 3 years median follow up time. The results were obtained 
with 17% of patients in the control arm having crossed over to trastuzumab therapy after results 
obtained with trastuzumab therapy in the adjuvant setting were known. 
Procedure No.: EMEA/H/C/000278/II/57  
EMA/36190/2012Rev10.11 
Page 55/58
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The observed effects have been supported by other randomized phase 2 and 3 trials with regard to the 
short term efficacy parameter pCR and in one study (MDACC) also the 3 year-event free survival rate 
was significantly reduced.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
All efficacy (methiodology) concerns have been resolved, there is no uncertainty in the evaluation of 
the benefit of trastuzumab in the claimed indication. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Important risks that have been identified in the neoadjuvant-adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab are 
cardiac events including death due to cardiac injury, infusion reactions, febrile neutropenia, infection 
and pulmonary reactions. An increase in CHF and also in significant LVEF was observed under 
trastuzumab therapy. These risks were already known for trastuzumab therapy in early breast cancer. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Safety aspects are well known and there is no uncertainty in the safety of trastuzumab in the 
population reflected by this indication.  
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The demonstration of improved event-free and overall survival is of great importance to the patient 
and is therefore clinically meaningful. This must be weighed against cardiac safety risks, especially in 
long term use. Careful monitoring of cardiac safety is emphasized in the product information. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The pivotal data shows that neoadjuvant trastuzumab has a clinically relevant benefit in terms of 
complete pathological response and event-free survival.  Importantly, these data are supported by 
pathological response rates from the literature in the neoadjuvant setting and by robust evidence of 
benefit for trastuzumab in adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer.   
These significant benefits for the patient outweigh the safety risks which are well studied from past 
experience with trastuzumab and manageable in the clinical setting. 
The proposed indication for neoadjuvant-adjuvant trastuzumab includes patients with HER2-positive 
early breast cancer (stage II, if the tumour is larger than 2 cm in diameter) as well as patients with 
HER2-positive locally advanced (stage III), and/or inflammatory breast cancer.  This is supported by 
the pivotal trial supplemented by the literature and is considered acceptable. 
Conclusion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Herceptin in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the 
treatment of patients with locally advanced (including inflammatory) breast cancer or tumours > 2 cm 
in diameter is considered positive.

3.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change(s): 
Variation(s) accepted 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Type 
II 
The Extension of indication to include treatment of patients with HER2-positive EBC in combination 
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant trastuzumab monotherapy, for locally advanced 
(including inflammatory) breast cancer or tumours > 2 cm in diameter 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II and Package Leaflet. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Risk management system  
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the 
marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. 
The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as 
agreed in version 10 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing 
authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
  When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
  Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached  
  at the request of the EMA 
The PSUR cycle for the product will follow a half yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by the CHMP.

1.  RECOMMENDATION 
Two  studies  N01280  and  N01281  were  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC) 
No1901/2006  (Paediatric  Regulation),  as  amended,.  After  review  of  the  study  data,  the  CHMP 
considered that there is no impact on either the Product Information or on the benefit-risk balance of 
the EU authorised formulations. 
2.  INTRODUCTION 
This  assessment  report  concerns  two  study  reports  submitted  under  Article  46  of  the  Paediatric 
Regulation. Both studies focused on the extended release (XR) formulation of Keppra, which is licensed 
in the US but not in the EU. 
Keppra  XR  comes  in  tablets  with  strengths  of  500  and  750mg,  and  is  indicated  in  the  US  as  an 
adjunctive therapy in treatment of partial onset seizures in epileptic patients ≥ 16 years of age. 
As this formulation is not authorised at this time in the EU, the Company only submits these studies in 
accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation. No changes on the EU Product Information will 
result from the study outcomes, and thus there will be no influence on the benefit-risk balance for the 
approved Keppra formulations. 
3.  STUDIES 
3.1.  Study N01280 
3.1.1.  Introduction 
Study  N01280  was  a  Phase  III  double-blind,  historically  controlled  multicentre  trial  investigating 
randomised conversion to monotherapy with Keppra XR for treatment of partial onset seizures. 
A total of 60 investigators in 57 centres in the USA, Mexico, Poland and Russia participated. 
The  study  took  29  weeks  to  complete,  including  an  8  week  baseline  period,  and  18  week  evaluation 
period, a 1 week down titration period and a 2 weeks treatment free period prior to the final visit. 
3.1.2.  Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  assessment  of  the  efficacy  of  Keppra  XR  compared  to  a 
historical control in conversion to monotherapy treatment of partial onset seizures. 
The secondary objective entailed assessment of the safety and tolerability of 2 doses of Keppra XR is 
said conversion. 
Direct medical resource use and indirect cost parameters were exploratory objectives.

3.1.3.  Study Methodology 
The  study  was  double-blind,  parallel,  randomized,  2-arm,  historical-  controlled,  multicenter  design.  A 
participating  subject  went  through  a  number  of  periods  during  the  study  duration:  Screening  Visit, 
Baseline Period (8 weeks during which time subjects remained on a stable dose of maximally 2 of their 
existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and maintained a seizure diary), Evaluation Period, Down-Titration 
Phase, and Follow-Up Visit. 
Patients  were  randomized  through  a  3:1  scheme  to  either  receive  Keppra  XR  2000mg/day  or  Keppra 
XR 1000mg/day. 
The  Evaluation  Period  consisted  of  18  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment,  administered  in  3  phases: 
Titration  (2  weeks  during  which  subjects  were  titrated  to  their  targeted  Keppra  XR  dose  in  a  double-
blind  fashion),  Concomitant  AED  Discontinuation  Phase  (6  weeks  in  which  subjects  were  tapered  and 
discontinued  from  their  previous  AEDs),  and  a  Monotherapy  Phase  (10  weeks  in  which  subjects 
remained  on  their  assigned  dosage  of  Keppra  XR  monotherapy  until  either  study  completion  or 
occurrence of any 1 of 4 exit criteria). 
Subjects who completed the study or met protocol-defined exit criteria after the 2-week titration phase, 
had  their  dosage  down-titrated  and  received  1000mg/day  open-label  Keppra  XR  for  1  week.  Final  or 
follow-up visit assessments were required for all subjects who were randomized to treatment. 
A  total  of  223  subjects  needed  to  be  randomised  (167  in  2000mg/day  group  and  56  in  1000mg/day 
group), assuming a 10% drop-out rate, in order to ensure that 200 total subjects were included in the 
EFF (efficacy analysis) population with 3:1 ratio in 2 treatment arms. 
3.1.4.  Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria 
Only  subjects  between  12  to  75  years  of  age  with  inadequately  controlled  partial  onset  epilepsy  with 
observable  partial  seizures  that  may  have  been  classified  as  simple,  complex  or  partial  seizures 
evolving  to  secondarily  generalized  seizures  could  participate.  In  addition,  subjects  had  to  have  been 
experiencing 2 to 40 acute seizures (auras not included) per 4-week period while being maintained on 
at least 1, but no more than 2 standard AEDs. Subjects had to be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks 
before screening (visit 1) of at least 1, but no more than 2 other concomitant AEDs. If taking 2 AEDs, 
1  of  the  Baseline  AEDs  should  have  been  taken  at  less  than  or  equal  to  50%  of  the  minimum 
recommended dose. 
A  history  of  status  epilepticus  in  the  6  months  preceding  randomization,  seizures  that  were 
uncountable due to clustering during the 8-week  period prior to screening (visit 1) and during the 8-
week Baseline Period or taking neuroleptics and/or traditional herbal AEDs were grounds for exclusion 
from  participation.  Lactating  or  pregnant  women  were  also  barred  from  entry,  as  were  patients 
suffering from problems which could impact absorption of Keppra XR.

3.1.5.  Endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  cumulative  exit  rate  at  112  days  after  the  beginning  of 
concomitant  AED  discontinuation  phase.  Subjects  who  prematurely  withdrew  from  the  study  for  any 
reason  other  than  the  protocol-defined  exit  criteria  were  censored  as  of  the  last  dose  of  study 
medication during the combined Concomitant AED Discontinuation and Monotherapy Phases. 
These four protocol-defined exit-criteria were: 
1.  Two-fold  increase  in  the  average  28-day  partial  seizure  frequency  (PSF)  in  any  28-day  period 
during  the  combined  Concomitant AED  Discontinuation  and  Monotherapy  Phases  compared  to  the 
average 28-day PSF over the Baseline Period  
2.  Two-fold  increase  in  the  highest  consecutive  2-day  PSF  during  the  combined  Concomitant  AED 
Discontinuation and Monotherapy Phases compared to the highest 2-day PSF observed during the 
last 56 days of the Baseline Period  
3.  Occurrence of a generalized seizure if none had occurred in the 6 months prior to randomization  
4.  An  episode  of  status  epilepticus,  a  prolongation  of  seizure  duration,  a  worsening  of  seizure 
frequency,  or  emergence  of  a  new  seizure  type  considered  by  the  investigator  to  require 
intervention  
The secondary efficacy analyses were conducted on the EFF population and were meant for descriptive 
purposes only: 
• 
• 
• 
The cumulative rate of exit and its 95% CI for 1000mg/day group was calculated and descriptively 
compared to the historical control exit rate as the secondary efficacy analysis. 
The  cumulative  rate  of  exit  events,  which  included  meeting  a  protocol-defined  exit  criteria, 
discontinuation due to AE, and discontination due to lack of efficacy, at 112 days after entering the 
Concomitant  AED  Discontinuation  Phase.  For  this  endpoint,  subjects  who  discontinued  from  the 
study during the combined AED D/C and Monotherapy Phases due to other reasons (not due to exit 
criteria, AE, or lack of efficacy) were censored as of the last dose of study medication during the 
combined periods  
The cumulative rate of exit or discontinuation events due to any reason at 112 days after entering 
the  Concomitant  AED  Discontinuation  Phase.  For  this  endpoint,  subjects  who  completed  through 
the Final/Completion Visit (Week 26) and did not meet any pre- specified exit criterion of the study 
were censored at Day 112. 
The exploratory endpoints were as follows: 
•  Average 7-day normalized PSF for the Baseline and Evaluation Periods  
•  Average 7-day normalized PSF by visit during the Evaluation Period  
•  Seizure-free days over the Evaluation Period  
• 
The global evaluation of disease evolution using a GES assessed by the investigator at the end of 
the Evaluation Period  
•  Medical resources used over the Baseline and Evaluation Period, including healthcare provider 
consultations not foreseen by the protocol, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations  
•  Number of working or school days lost by the subject and the number of days with help from a 
caregiver  
•  Socio-professional data (driving status, employment status)  
3.1.6.  Subject Disposition 
Out  of  a  total  of  303  subjects  screened,  228  were  randomized  to  treatment,  57  to  the  Keppra  XR 
1000mg group and 171 to the Keppra XR 2000mg group. A total of 191 (83.8%) completed the study, 
defined as either completed the Final Visit (Week 26) or withdrawn because they met an exit criterion. 
Thirty seven (16.2%) subjects withdrew from the study; the most common reason for discontinuation 
was protocol violation, followed by adverse event (AE), withdrawal of consent, other, lost to follow-up, 
and lack of efficacy.

3.1.7.  Efficacy Results 
The main efficacy results are summarized in table 1: 
Table 1: Main Efficacy Results 
*Keppra XR 2000mg/day predicted exit rate is significantly lower than historical control. 
a. A subject may be counted under more than 1 exit criteria. 
b. Exit rate and time to exit were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. 
As can be seen, the exit rate at Day 112 for the Keppra XR 2000mg group was significantly lower than 
the historical control exit rate of 0.678. When comparing the KM (Kaplen-Meier) curves for time to exit, 
the Keppra XR 2000mg group had a longer time to exit when compared to the same KM curve for the 
historical control pseudo placebo population based on visual comparison of the slope of the curves. 
In both the EFF and PP populations, the estimated rate of exit at Day 112 was significantly lower than 
that  of  the  historical  control.  Sensitivity  analyses  demonstrated  that  the  cumulative  exit  rate  was 
significantly lower than that of the historical control under each of the conditions tested. 
Based on the subgroup analyses, Mexico had a markedly higher proportion of subjects meeting an exit 
criterion  compared  to  other  countries.  Subjects  withdrawing  from  carbamazepine  as  a  concomitant 
AED had a higher rate of exit. 
Secondary analyses confirmed the results of the primary analyses. 
3.1.8.  Safety Results 
A total of 177 subjects reported 575 TEAEs during the overall treatment period. Somnolence (21.9% of 
subjects)  was  the  most  commonly  reported  TEAE,  followed  by  headache  (19.7%  of  subjects).  Most 
reported  TEAEs  were  judged  as  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Severe  TEAEs  were  reported  by  16 
subjects  overall  (7.0%).  There  were  no  apparent  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  the 
incidence of TEAEs. The AE profile was similar to that reported in the US package insert. 
There  was  no  evidence  for  any  effect  of  Keppra  XR  treatment  on  laboratory  parameters,  vital  signs, 
weight, ECG evaluations, physical examinations, or neurological examinations. 
3.1.9.  Conclusions 
In both the EFF and PP populations, the estimated rate of exit at Day 112 (primary efficacy endpoint) 
was significantly lower than that of the historical control based on the original exit rate of 67.8% and 
the revised exit rate of 65.3%.

Sensitivity  analyses,  conducted  on  the  primary  endpoint  to  evaluate  the  robustness  of  the  effect  of 
Keppra XR 2000mg, demonstrated that the cumulative exit rate was significantly lower than that of the 
historical control under each of the conditions tested. 
Based  on  the  subgroup  analyses,  Mexico  had  a  markedly  higher  proportion  of  subjects  (59.0%) 
meeting  an  exit  criterion  compared  to  other  countries  (US,  36.0%;  Poland,  24.5%;  Russia,  26.7%). 
Subjects  withdrawing  from  carbamazepine  as  a  concomitant  AED  had  a  higher  rate  of  exit.  Other 
subgroups did not appear to have an influence on the exit rate.  
Secondary efficacy analyses confirmed the results of the primary analyses. 
Keppra  XR  was  safe  and  well-tolerated  when  administered  as  monotherapy  to  subjects  with 
inadequately  controlled  partial  onset  epilepsy  with  observable  partial  seizures,  with  an  AE  profile 
similar to that reported in the package insert. 
3.2.  Study N01281 
3.2.1.  Introduction 
Study N01281 was a Phase III open-label, long-term follow-up study with Keppra XR for treatment of 
partial-onset  seizures.  Forty-three  investigators  in  61  centres  in  the  USA,  Mexico,  Poland  and  Russia 
enrolled subjects in the study. 
The  study  took  6  months  to  3  years  to  complete,  depending  on  the  time  that  a  subject  completed 
study N01280. 
3.2.2.  Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  was  to  provide  continued  treatment  of  Keppra  XR  for  subjects  who 
participated  in  the  pivotal  conversion  to  monotherapy  study  (N01280)  and  to  assess  the  long-term 
safety of Keppra XR in patients with partial onset seizures. 
There were no secondary or exploratory objectives planned. 
3.2.3.  Study Methodology 
The study, an open-label multicentredesign, consisted of three distinct phases: Entry Visit, Treatment 
Period, and Final/Early Discontinuation Visit. 
•  The Entry Visit coincided with a subjects last study visit in study N01280. 
•  The Treatment Period consisted of all subjects receiving a daily dose of 2000mg or less, depending 
on the tolerability in a subject, open-label Keppra XR for at least 2 weeks. After the initial 2 weeks, 
the  dose  of  Keppra  XR  could  be  adjusted  if  necessary.  If  possible  Keppra  XR  monotherapy  was 
mainained, but addition of other AEDs was allowed if needed. 
•  The Final/Early Discontinuation Visit was done approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of Keppra 
XR. 
There  were  a  total  of  190  enrolled  subjects  in  the  ITT  (Intent  To  Treat)  Population.  A  total  of  189 
(99.5%)  subjects  received  treatment  and  were  included  in  the  Safety  Population.  The  same  189 
(99.5%) subjects had at least 1 efficacy measurement reported, and were included in the EFF (Efficacy 
Analysis) population. 
3.2.4.  Exclusion and Inclusion Criteria 
Subject wishing to participate had to have been randomised into the N01280 study and completed its 
2-week Up-Titration Period. 
Screening  failures  of  N01280  or  subjects  whom  discontinued  from  N01280  prior  to  the  end  of  the  2-
week  Up-Titration  Period,  or  whom  were  taking  neuroleptics  and/or  traditional  herbal  AEDs  were  not 
eligible for  participation. Lactating  or pregnant  women  were  also  barred  from  entry,  as were  patients 
suffering from problems which could impact absorption of Keppra XR.

3.2.5.  Statistical Methods 
Summary  statistics  consisted  of  frequency  and  percentage  for  categorical  variables,  and  descriptive 
statistics. 
3.2.6.  Subject Disposition 
A total of 190 subjects were enrolled in this study. Of these, 189 (99.5%) received medication. A total 
of 166 (87.4%) completed the study, defined as all subjects who did not discontinue. 
Twenty four (12.6%) subjects withdrew from the study; the most common reason for discontinuation 
was withdrawal of consent and other reason, followed by AE and protocol violation. 
3.2.7.  Efficacy Results 
Of  the  subjects  who  entered  the  study  on  Keppra  XR  monotherapy,  65.3%  remained  on  Keppra  XR 
monotherapy  for  at  least  12  months  and  47.1%  remained  on  monotherapy  at  least  18  months.  Two 
subjects even remained on Keppra XR monotherapy for at least 24 months. 
Subjects who remained in the study had a reduction in seizure frequency at all study visits relative to 
Baseline  of  the  N01280  study,  as  measured  by  the  median  7-day  PSF  and  the  median  7-day  seizure 
frequency based on all seizure types. 
3.2.8.  Safety Results 
Keppra  XR  was  well-tolerated  when  administered  as  long-term  monotherapy  or  in  combination  with 
other  AEDs  in  subjects  with  inadequately  controlled  partial  onset  seizures.  A  total  of  126  subjects 
(66.7%) reported 588 TEAEs. Headache (13.8% of subjects) was the most commonly reported TEAE, 
followed by nasopharyngitis and somnolence (7.9% for each), influenza (5.3%) and dizziness (7.4%). 
Most reported TEAEs were judged as mild or moderate in severity. 
A  total  of  5  subjects  (2.6%)  had  a  TEAE  that  led  to  discontinuation.  This  included  2  subjects  (1.1%) 
who became pregnant. Twenty two subjects (11.6% of the overall population) had a SAE; Convulsion 
(4 subjects, 2.1%) was the most common treatment-emergent SAE. There was one death (drowning) 
in a subject aged 18 years. This death was judged to be unrelated to the study medication. A total of 
26  subjects  (13.8%)  experienced  at  least  one  psychiatric  TEAE  during  the  overall  treatment  period. 
Insomnia  (4.8%)  was  the  most  commonly  reported  psychiatric  TEAE,  followed  by  depression  (2.6%) 
and anxiety (2.1%). 
Table 2 on the next page gives a summary on the TEAEs. 
There  was  no  evidence  for  any  effect  of  Keppra  XR  treatment  on  laboratory  parameters,  vital  signs, 
weight, ECG evaluations, physical examinations, or neurological examinations.

Table 2: summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
3.2.9.  Conclusions 
Keppra  XR  was  safe  and  well-tolerated  when  administered  as  long-term  treatment  to  subjects  with 
inadequately  controlled  partial  onset  epilepsy,  with  an  AE  profile  similar  to  that  reported  in  the  US 
package insert for Keppra XR. 
Subjects  in  the  study  appeared  to  have  maintenance  of  efficacy  as  evidenced  by  the  percentage  of 
subjects who remained on Keppra X R monotherapy for at least 12 months. 
4.  OVERALL CONCLUSIONS 
The CHMP considered that the results of the two studies presented by the MAH showed that Keppra XR 
was  effective  and  safe  in  long-term  treatment  of  subjects  with  inadequately  controlled  partial  onset 
epilepsy. 
Nevertheless,  Keppra  XR  is  not  a  registered  formulation  in  the  EU,  therefore  no  changes  to  the 
approved Product Information for Keppra were proposed following the completion of these studies. The 
MAH considered that the standard immediate release formulations of Keppra allows for appropriate use 
of  levetiracetam  in  paediatric  patients  in  the  EU.  These  studies  were  solely  submitted  in  accordance 
with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulations. 
However, in case the MAH should one day consider registering the XR formulation in the EU, the CHMP 
noted  that  the  data  as  collected  in  both  studies  was  nowhere  near  robust  enough  to  support  an 
extension of the approved monotherapy indication of the currently available formulations in the EU. For 
that to be possible, additional studies and more data were considered to be needed.
